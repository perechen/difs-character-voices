864	868	855	856	Martin Lister	179	" the Squire . "
1143	1192	1198	1204	a portly genial - looking old man	399	" there was such a light and glory about it at some moments . Gilbert Fenton thought so to - night , as he saw it in the full radiance of the western sunlight , the lips parted as the girl sang , the clear gray eyes looking upward .
1268	1272	1255	1255	Gilbert	178	" Introduce me . "
1273	1285	1255	1255	Gilbert	178	" My brother Mr. Fenton , Captain Sedgewick , Miss Nowell . "
1293	1326	1286	1287	The Captain	404	" Delighted to know you , Mr. Fenton ; delighted to know any one belonging to Mrs. Lister . You are going to stop down here for some time , I hope . "
1327	1360	1255	1255	Gilbert	178	" I fear not for very long , Captain Sedgewick . I am a business man , you see , and ca n't afford to take a long holiday from the City . "
1365	1375	1376	1376	she	181	" My brother is utterly devoted to commercial pursuits , "
1379	1397	1376	1376	she	181	" I think he believes every hour wasted that he spends out of his counting - house . "
1398	1445	1514	1514	he	405	" And yet I was thinking in church this evening , that a man 's life might be happier in such a place as this , drifting away in a kind of dreamy idleness , than the greatest successes possible to commerce could ever make it . "
1446	1458	1460	1461	his sister	386	" You would very soon be tired of your dreamy idleness , "
1463	1473	1460	1461	his sister	386	" and sigh for your office and your club . "
1474	1496	1498	1499	the Captain	404	" The country suits old people , who have played their part in life , and made an end of it , "
1501	1513	1514	1514	he	405	" It suits my little girl here very well , too , "
1554	1554	1545	1545	she	408	"
1555	1561	1563	1564	the girl	5090	" Never , uncle George , "
1629	1637	1639	1639	Gilbert	178	" What a lovely girl she is ! "
1646	1656	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" Lovely is rather a strong word , Gilbert , "
1683	1683	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	"
1684	1728	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" There is no fear of that . A man may admire a girl 's face without being in any danger of losing his heart . But why not in that direction , Belle ? Is there any special objection to the lady ? "
1729	1754	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" Only that she is a nobody , without either money or position and I think you ought to have both when you marry . "
1755	1796	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" Thanks for the implied compliment ; but I do not fancy that an Australian merchant can expect to secure a wife of very exalted position ; and I am the last man in the world to marry for money . "
1797	1831	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" I do n't for a moment suppose you would marry any one you did n't like , from mercenary considerations ; but there is no reason you should make a foolish match . "
1832	1866	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" Of course not . I think it very doubtful whether I shall ever marry at all . I am just the kind of man to go down to my grave a bachelor . "
1867	1873	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" Why so , Gilbert ? "
1874	1986	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" Well , I can hardly tell you , my dear . Perhaps I am rather difficult to please just a little stony - hearted and invulnerable . I know that since I was a boy , and got over my schoolboy love affairs , I have never seen the woman who could touch my heart . I have met plenty of pretty women , and plenty of brilliant women , of course , in society ; and have admired them , and there an end . I have never seen a woman whose face impressed me so much at first sight as the face of your friend , Miss Nowell . "
1987	1995	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" I am very sorry for that . "
1996	2002	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" But why , Belle ? "
2003	2025	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" Because the girl is a nobody less than nobody . There is an unpleasant kind of mystery about her birth . "
2026	2043	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" How is that ? Her uncle , Captain Sedgewick , seems to be a gentleman . "
2044	2069	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" Captain Sedgewick is very well , but he is not her uncle ; he adopted her when she was a very little girl . "
2070	2086	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" But who are her people , and how did she fall into his hands ? "
2087	2135	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" I have never heard that . He is not very fond of talking about the subject . When we first came to know them , he told us that Marian was only his adopted niece ; and he has never told us any more than that . "
2136	2157	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" She is the daughter of some friend , I suppose . They seem very much attached to each other . "
2158	2187	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" Yes , she is very fond of him , and he of her . She is an amiable girl ; I have nothing to say against her but "
2188	2194	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" But what , Belle ? "
2195	2208	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" I should n't like you to fall in love with her . "
2209	2216	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" But I should , mamma ! "
2234	2296	2218	2232	the damsel in scarlet stockings , who had absorbed every word of the foregoing conversation	415	" I should like uncle Gil to love Marian just as I love her . She is the dearest girl in the world . When we had a juvenile party last winter , it was Marian who dressed the Christmas - tree every bit ; and she played the piano for us all the evening , did n't she , mamma ? "
2297	2333	1657	1658	Mrs. Lister	181	" She is very good - natured , Lucy ; but you must n't talk nonsense ; and you ought not to listen when your uncle and I are talking . It is very rude . "
2334	2345	2218	2232	the damsel in scarlet stockings , who had absorbed every word of the foregoing conversation	415	" But I ca n't help hearing you , mamma . "
2760	2765	2766	2766	he	179	" Well , Toddlekins , "
2773	2863	2766	2766	he	179	" I hope you were very attentive to the sermon ; listened for two , and made up for your lazy dad . That 's a vicarious kind of devotion that ought to be permitted occasionally to a hard - working fellow like me . I 'm glad you 've come back to give us some tea , Belle . Do n't go upstairs ; let Susan carry up your bonnet and shawl . It 's nearly nine o'clock . Toddlekins wants her tea before she goes to bed . "
2864	2874	2876	2877	Mrs. Lister	181	" Lucy has had her tea in the nursery , "
2890	2900	2902	2902	Martin	179	" But she will have some more with papa , "
3148	3160	3162	3162	Gilbert	178	" It 's almost too warm an evening for the house , "
3164	3173	3162	3162	Gilbert	178	" I think I 'll take a stroll . "
3174	3199	3204	3205	Martin Lister	179	" I 'd come with you , old fellow , but I 've been all round the farm , and I 'm dead beat , "
3207	3243	3244	3244	He	178	" Thanks , Martin ; I would n't think of disturbing you . You look the picture of comfort in that easy - chair . I shall only stay long enough to finish a cigar . "
4132	4161	4162	4162	he	178	" If I had gone to the Bar , as I intended to do before my father 's death , I should have had an object in life , "
4173	4226	4166	4166	he	178	" but a commercial man has nothing to hope for in the way of fame nothing to work for except money . I have a good mind to sell the business , now that it is worth selling , and go in for the Bar after all , late as it is . "
4942	4952	4953	4953	he	178	" Good - evening once more , Miss Nowell , "
4974	5020	4956	4956	She	183	" Good - evening , Mr. Fenton . I did not see you till this moment . I was looking for my uncle . He has gone out for a little stroll while he smokes his cigar , and I expect him home every minute . "
5021	5032	5034	5034	Gilbert	178	" I have been indulging in a solitary cigar myself , "
5036	5112	5034	5034	Gilbert	178	" One is apt to be inspired with an antipathy to the house on this kind of evening . I left the Listers yawning over their tea - cups , and came out for a ramble . The aspect of the lane at which we parted company this evening tempted me down this way . What a pretty house you have ! Do you know I guessed that it was yours before I saw you . "
5113	5125	4956	4956	She	183	" Indeed ! You must have quite a talent for guessing . "
5126	5152	5034	5034	Gilbert	178	" Not in a general way ; but there is a fitness in things . Yes , I felt sure that this was your house . "
5153	5161	5162	5162	she	519	" I am glad you like it , "
5166	5191	5162	5162	she	519	" Uncle George and I are very fond of it . But it must seem a poor little place to you after Lidford House . "
5192	5236	5034	5034	Gilbert	178	" Lidford House is spacious , and comfortable , and commonplace . One could hardly associate the faintest touch of romance with such a place . But about this one might fancy anything . Ah , here is your uncle , I see . "
5734	5753	5754	5754	he	404	" I have not been able to afford so much as a visit to London for my darling , "
5757	5798	5754	5754	he	404	" but I do not know that she is any the worse for her ignorance of the great world . The grand point is that she should be happy , and I thank God that she has been happy hitherto . "
5799	5813	5814	5815	the girl	5090	" I should be very ungrateful if I were not , uncle George , "
5872	5884	5885	5885	he	178	" I have stayed a most unconscionable time , I fear , "
5888	5900	5885	5885	he	178	" but I had really no idea it was so late . "
5901	5909	5911	5912	the Captain	404	" Pray , do n't hurry away , "
5914	5936	5911	5912	the Captain	404	" You ought to help me to finish that bottle . Marian and I are not the earliest people in Lidford . "
6045	6053	6054	6054	he	178	" Is this love at first sight ? "
6086	6301	6056	6056	himself	178	" Is it ? I should have been the last of men to believe such a thing possible yesterday ; and yet to - night I feel as if that girl were destined to be the ruling influence of my future life . Why is it ? Because she is lovely ? Surely not . Surely I am not so weak a fool as to be caught by a beautiful face ! And yet what else do I know of her ? Absolutely nothing . She may be the shallowest of living creatures the most selfish , the falsest , the basest . No ; I do not believe she could ever be false or unworthy . There is something noble in her face something more than mere beauty . Heaven knows , I have seen enough of that in my time . I could scarcely be so childish as to be bewitched by a pair of gray eyes and a rosy mouth ; there must be something more . And , after all , this is most likely a passing fancy , born out of the utter idleness and dulness of this place . I shall go back to London in a week or two , and forget Marian Nowell . Marian Nowell ! "
6417	6430	6459	6459	her	181	" Why , what could have taken you that way , Gilbert ? "
6431	6452	6459	6459	her	181	" A truant fancy , I suppose , my dear . It is as good a way as any other . "
6463	6470	6471	6471	she	181	" What fools you men are , "
6474	6480	6471	6471	she	181	" about a pretty face ! "
6481	6497	6459	6459	her	181	" Including Martin , Belle , when he fell in love with your fair self ? "
6498	6522	6471	6471	she	181	" Martin did not stare me out of countenance in church , sir . But you have almost kept us waiting for prayers . "
7368	7381	7382	7383	Mrs. Lister	181	" They are pleasant people to have at a dinner - party , "
7419	7419	7417	7417	Gilbert	178	"
7420	7442	7399	7399	I	0	" My folly , as you are kind enough to call it , is not dependent on your encouragement , Belle . "
7443	7455	7457	7457	Martin	179	" Then it is really a serious case , I suppose , "
7459	7486	7399	7399	I	0	" I really admire Miss Nowell more than I ever admired any one before , if that is what you call a serious case , Martin . "
7487	7495	7496	7497	the other	595	" Rather like it , I think , "
7778	7789	7790	7791	Gilbert Fenton	178	" My holiday is very nearly over , Miss Nowell , "
7797	7828	7790	7791	Gilbert Fenton	178	" I shall have to go back to London and the old commercial life , the letter - writing and interview - giving , and all that kind of thing . "
7829	7846	7847	7847	she	183	" Your sister said you were very fond of the counting - house , Mr. Fenton , "
7851	7881	7847	7847	she	183	" I daresay , if you would only confess the truth , you are heartily tired of the country , and will be delighted to resume your business life . "
7882	7891	7790	7791	Gilbert Fenton	178	" I should never be tired of Lidford . "
7892	7906	7847	7847	she	183	" Indeed ! and yet it is generally considered such a dull place . "
7907	7935	7790	7791	Gilbert Fenton	178	" It has not been so to me . It will always be a shining spot in my memory , different and distinct from all other places . "
8086	8097	8098	8098	he	611	" I have come to spoil your afternoon 's amusement , "
8101	8128	8098	8098	he	611	" I have not many days more to spend in Lidford , you know , and I want to make the most of a short time . "
8129	8137	8138	8139	Miss Nowell	183	" The book is not particularly interesting , "
8144	8174	8138	8139	Miss Nowell	183	" I 'll go and tell my uncle you are here . He is taking an afternoon nap ; but I know he 'll be pleased to see you . "
8175	8183	8185	8186	Mr. Fenton	178	" Do n't tell him just yet , "
8191	8285	8185	8186	Mr. Fenton	178	" I have something to say to you this afternoon , something that it is wiser to say at once , perhaps , though I have been willing enough to put off the hour of saying it , as a man may well be when all his future life depends upon the issue of a few words . I think you must know what I mean , Miss Nowell . Marian , I think you can guess what is coming . I told you last night how sweet Lidford had been to me . "
8286	8289	8290	8290	she	183	" Yes , "
8302	8312	8299	8299	her	183	" But what have I to do with that ? "
8313	8375	8376	8376	He	616	" Everything . It is you who have made the little country village my paradise . O Marian , tell me that it has not been a fool 's paradise ! My darling , I love you with all my heart and soul , with an honest man 's first and only love . Promise that you will be my wife . "
8414	8424	8425	8425	she	183	" You do not know what you are asking , "
8428	8461	8425	8425	she	183	" you can not know . Captain Sedgewick is not my uncle . He does not even know who my parents were . I am the most obscure creature in the world . "
8462	8493	8376	8376	He	616	" Not one degree less dear to me because of that , Marian ; only the dearer . Tell me , my darling , is there any hope for me ? "
8494	8498	8499	8499	she	183	" I never thought "
8502	8507	8499	8499	she	183	" I had no idea "
8508	8633	8376	8376	He	616	" That to know you was to love you . My life and soul , I have loved you from the hour I first saw you in Lidford church . I was a doomed man from that moment , Marian . O my dearest , trust me , and it shall go hard if I do not make your future life a happy one . Granted that I am ten years more than ten years your senior , that is a difference on the right side . I have fought the battle of life , and have conquered , and am strong enough to protect and shelter the woman I love . Come , Marian , I am waiting for a word of hope . "
8634	8642	8643	8643	she	617	" And do you really love me ? "
8647	8658	8643	8643	she	617	" It seems so strange after so short a time . "
8659	8674	8376	8376	He	616	" I loved you from that first evening in the church , my dear . "
8675	8683	8684	8684	she	617	" I am very grateful to you , "
8688	8722	8684	8684	she	617	" and I am proud I have reason to be proud of your preference . But I have known you such a short time . I am afraid to give you any promise . "
8723	8734	8376	8376	He	616	" Afraid of me , or of yourself , Marian ? "
8735	8739	8684	8684	she	617	" Of myself . "
8740	8745	8376	8376	He	616	" In what way ? "
8746	8806	8684	8684	she	617	" I am only a foolish frivolous girl . You offer me so much more than I deserve in offering me your love like this . I scarcely know if I have a heart to give to any one . I know that I have never loved anybody except my one friend and protector , my dear adopted uncle . "
8807	8864	8376	8376	He	616	" But you do not say that you can not love me , Marian . Perhaps I have spoken too soon , after all . It seems to me that I have known you for a lifetime ; but that is only a lover 's fancy . I seem almost a stranger to you , perhaps ? "
8865	8868	8869	8869	she	618	" Almost , "
8880	8906	8376	8376	He	616	" That is rather hard upon me , my dear . But I can wait . You do not know how patient I can be . "
9065	9091	9092	9093	Gilbert Fenton	178	" I think a woman can scarcely help returning a man 's love , if he is only as thoroughly in earnest as I am , "
9153	9160	9161	9161	he	198	" She did n't reject you ? "
9171	9266	9161	9161	he	198	" Not in plain words . But there was not much to indicate hope . And yet I cling to the fancy that she will come to love me in the end . To think otherwise would be utter misery to me . I can not tell you how dearly I love her , and how weak I am about this business . It seems contemptible for a man to talk about a broken heart ; but I shall carry an empty one to my grave unless I win Marian Nowell for my wife . "
9267	9273	9275	9276	the Captain	404	" You shall win her ! "
9279	9312	9313	9313	he	404	" You are a noble fellow , sir , and will make her an excellent husband . She will not be so foolish as to reject such a disinterested affection . Besides , "
9320	9348	9313	9313	he	404	" I have a very shrewd notion that all this apparent indifference is only shyness on my little girl 's part , and that she loves you . "
9349	9354	9356	9356	Gilbert	178	" You believe that ! "
9359	9450	9161	9161	he	198	" It is only guesswork on my part , of course . I am an old bachelor , you see , and have had very little experience as to the signs and tokens of the tender passion . But I will sound my little girl by and by . She will be more ready to confess the truth to her old uncle than she would to you , perhaps . I think you have been a trifle hasty about this affair . There is so much in time and custom . "
9451	9466	9467	9467	Gilbert	178	" It is only a cold kind of love that grows out of custom , "
9471	9492	9467	9467	Gilbert	178	" But I daresay you are right , and that it would have been better for me to have waited . "
9493	9506	9508	9509	the Captain	404	" You may hope everything , if you can only be patient , "
9511	9559	9508	9509	the Captain	404	" I tell you frankly , that nothing would make me happier than to see my dear child married to a good man . I have had many dreary thoughts about her future of late . I think you know that I have nothing to leave her . "
9560	9592	9467	9467	Gilbert	178	" I have never thought of that . If she were destined to inherit all the wealth of the Rothschilds , she could be no dearer to me than she is . "
9593	9626	9508	9509	the Captain	404	" Ah , what a noble thing true love is ! And do you know that she is not really my niece only a poor waif that I adopted fourteen years ago ? "
9627	9659	9467	9467	Gilbert	178	" I have heard as much from her own lips . There is nothing , except some unworthiness in herself , that could make any change in my estimation of her . "
9660	9726	9508	9509	the Captain	404	" Unworthiness in herself ! You need never fear that . But I must tell you Marian 's story before this business goes any farther . Will you come and smoke your cigar with me to - night ? She is going to drink tea at a neighbour 's , and we shall be alone . They are all fond of her , poor child . "
9727	9783	9467	9467	Gilbert	178	" I shall be very happy to come . And in the meantime , you will try and ascertain the real state of her feelings without distressing her in any way ; and you will tell me the truth with all frankness , even if it is to be a deathblow to all my hopes ? "
9784	9819	9508	9509	the Captain	404	" Even if it should be that . But I do not fear such a melancholy result . I think Marian is sensible enough to know the value of an honest man 's heart . "
9891	9897	9898	9898	he	198	" She must like him , "
9903	9986	9898	9898	he	198	" Why should not she like him ? good - looking , generous , clever , prosperous , well - connected , and over head and ears in love with her . Such a marriage is the very thing I have been praying for . And without such a marriage , what would be her fate when I am gone ? A drudge and dependent in some middle - class family perhaps tyrannised over and tormented by a brood of vulgar children . "
10007	10017	10018	10018	she	183	" My dear uncle , what is the matter ? "
10034	10050	10018	10018	she	183	" I know you never walk about like that unless you are worried by something . "
10051	10068	10070	10071	the Captain	404	" I am not worried to - day , my love ; only a little perplexed , "
10100	10115	10081	10081	himself	404	" Marian , I thought you and I had no secrets from each other ? "
10116	10122	10018	10018	she	183	" Secrets , uncle George ! "
10123	10158	10081	10081	himself	404	" Yes , my dear . Have n't you something pleasant to tell your old uncle something that a girl generally likes telling ? You had a visitor yesterday afternoon while I was asleep . "
10159	10163	10018	10018	she	183	" Mr. Fenton . "
10164	10189	10081	10081	himself	404	" Mr. Fenton . He has been here with me just now ; and I know that he asked you to be his wife . "
10190	10197	10018	10018	she	183	" He did , uncle George . "
10198	10208	10081	10081	himself	404	" And you did n't refuse him , Marian ? "
10209	10256	10018	10018	she	183	" Not positively , uncle George . He took me so much by surprise , you see ; and I really do n't know how to refuse any one ; but I think I ought to have made him understand more clearly that I meant no . "
10257	10264	10081	10081	himself	404	" But why , my dear ? "
10265	10307	10018	10018	she	183	" Because I am sure I do n't care about him as much as I ought to care . I like him very well , you know , and think him clever and agreeable , and all that kind of thing . "
10308	10332	10081	10081	himself	404	" That will soon grow into a warmer feeling , Marian ; at least I trust in God that it will do so . "
10333	10339	10018	10018	she	183	" Why , dear uncle ? "
10340	10413	10081	10081	himself	404	" Because I have set my heart upon this marriage . O Marian , my love , I have never ventured to speak to you about your future the days that must come when I am dead and gone ; and you can never know how many anxious hours I have spent thinking of it . Such a marriage as this would secure you happiness and prosperity in the years to come . "
10463	10528	10414	10414	She	631	" But my dear love , ' afterwards ' will make the greater part of your life . We must consider these things seriously , Marian . A good man 's affection is not to be thrown away rashly . You have known Mr. Fenton a very short time ; and perhaps it is only natural you should think of him with comparative indifference . "
10529	10574	10592	10592	She	633	" I did not say I was indifferent to him , uncle George ; only that I do not love him as he seems to love me . It would be a kind of sin to accept so much and to give so little . "
10575	10591	10414	10414	She	631	" The love will come , Marian ; I am sure that it will come . "
10598	10609	10610	10610	she	633	" What a darling match - making uncle it is ! "
10751	10767	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" When I came back from India fourteen years ago on the sick - list , "
10772	10936	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" I went down to Brighton , a place I had been fond of in my young days , to recruit . It was in the early spring , quite out of the fashionable season , and the town was very empty . My lodgings were in a dull street at the extreme east , leading away from the sea , but within sight and sound of it . The solitude and quiet of the place suited me ; and I used to walk up and down the cliff in the dusk of evening enjoying the perfect loneliness of the scene . The house I lived in was a comfortable one , kept by an elderly widow who was a pattern of neatness and propriety . There were no children ; for some time no other lodgers ; and the place was as quiet as the grave . All this suited me very well . I wanted rest , and I was getting it .
10937	11050	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" I had been at Brighton about a month , when the drawing - room floor over my head was taken by a lady , and her little girl of about five years old . I used to hear the child 's feet pattering about the room ; but she was not a noisy child by any means ; and when I did happen to hear her voice , it had a very pleasant sound to me . The lady was an invalid , and was a good deal of trouble , my landlady took occasion to tell me , as she had no maid of her own . Her name was Nowell .
11051	11178	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" Soon after this I encountered her on the cliff one afternoon with her little girl . The child and I had met once or twice before in the hall ; and her recognition of me led to a little friendly talk between me and the mother . She was a fragile delicate - looking woman , who had once been very pretty , but whose beauty had for the most part been worn away , either by ill - health or trouble . She was very young , five - and - twenty at the utmost . She told me that the little girl was her only child , and that her husband was away from England , but that she expected his return before long .
11179	11270	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" After this we met almost every afternoon ; and I began to look out for these meetings , and our quiet talk upon the solitary cliff , as the pleasantest part of my day . There was a winning grace about this Mrs. Nowell 's manner that I had never seen in any other woman ; and I grew to be more interested in her than I cared to confess to myself . It matters little now ; and I may freely own how weak I was in those days .
11271	11436	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" I could see that she was very ill , and I did not need the ominous hints of the landlady , who had contrived to question Mrs. Nowell 's doctor , to inspire me with the dread that she might never recover . I thought of her a great deal , and watched the fading light in her eyes , and listened to the weakening tones of her voice , with a sense of trouble that seemed utterly disproportionate to the occasion . I will not say that I loved her ; neither the fact that she was another man 's wife , nor the fact that she was soon to die , was ever absent from my mind when I thought of her . I will only say that she was more to me than any woman had ever been before , or has ever been since . It was the one sentimental episode of my life , and a very brief one .
11437	11609	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" The weeks went by , and her husband did not come . I think the trouble and anxiety caused by his delay did a good deal towards hastening the inevitable end ; but she bore her grief very quietly , and never uttered a complaint of him in my hearing . She paid her way regularly enough for a considerable time , and then all at once broke down , and confessed to the landlady that she had not a shilling more in the world . The woman was a hard creature , and told her that if that was the case , she must find some other lodgings , and immediately . I heard this , not from Mrs. Nowell , but from the landlady , who seemed to consider her conduct thoroughly justified by the highest code of morals . She was a lone unprotected woman , and how was she to pay her rent and taxes if her best floor was occupied by a non - paying tenant ?
11610	11709	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" I was by no means a rich man ; but I could not endure to think of that helpless dying creature thrust out into the streets ; and I told my landlady that I would be answerable for Mrs. Nowell 's rent , and for the daily expenses incurred on her behalf . Mr. Nowell would in all probability appear in good time to relieve me from the responsibility , but in the mean while that poor soul upstairs was not to be distressed . I begged that she might know nothing of this undertaking on my part .
11710	11846	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" It was not long after this when our daily meetings on the cliff came to an end . Mild as the weather was by this time , Mrs. Nowell 's doctor had forbidden her going out any longer . I knew that she had no maid to send out with the child , so I sent the servant up to ask her if she would trust the little one for a daily walk with me . This she was very pleased to do , and Marian became my dear little companion every afternoon . She had taken to me , as the phrase goes , from the very first . She was the gentlest , most engaging child I had ever met with a little grave for her years , and tenderly thoughtful of others .
11847	11928	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" One evening Mrs. Nowell sent for me . I went up to the drawing - room immediately , and found her sitting in an easy - chair propped up by pillows , and very much changed for the worse since I had seen her last . She told me that she had discovered the secret of my goodness to her , as she called it , from the landlady , and that she had sent for me to thank me .
11929	11991	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" ' I can give you nothing but thanks and blessings , ' she said , ' for I am the most helpless creature in this world . I suppose my husband will come here before I die , and will relieve you from the risk you have taken for me ; but he can never repay you for your goodness . '
11992	12030	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" I told her to give herself no trouble on my account ; but I could not help saying , that I thought her husband had behaved shamefully in not coming to England to her long ere this .
12031	12046	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" ' He knows that you are ill , I suppose ? ' I said .
12047	12280	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" ' O yes , he knows that . I was ill when he sent me home . We had been travelling about the Continent almost ever since our marriage . He married me against his father 's will , and lost all chance of a great fortune by doing so . I did not know how much he sacrificed at the time , or I should never have consented to his losing so much for my sake . I think the knowledge of what he had lost came between us very soon . I know that his love for me has grown weaker as the years went by , and that I have been little better than a burden to him . I could never tell you how lonely my life has been in those great foreign cities , where there seems such perpetual gaiety and pleasure . I think I must have died of the solitude and dulness the long dreary summer evenings , the dismal winter days if it had not been for my darling child . She has been all the world to me . And , O God ! ' she cried , with a look of anguish that went to my heart , ' what will become of her when I am dead , and she is left to the care of a selfish dissipated man ? '
12281	12329	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" ' You need never fear that she will be without one friend while I live , ' I said . ' Little Marian is very dear to me , and I shall make it my business to watch over her career as well as I can . '
12330	12365	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" The poor soul clasped my hand , and pressed her feverish lips to it in a transport of gratitude . What a brute a man must have been who could neglect such a woman !
12366	12462	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" After this I went up to her room every evening , and read to her a little , and cheered her as well as I could ; but I believe her heart was broken . The end came very suddenly at last . I had intended to question her about her husband 's family ; but the subject was a difficult one to approach , and I had put it off from day to day , hoping that she might rally a little , and would be in a better condition to discuss business matters .
12463	12529	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" She never did rally . I was with her when she died , and her last act was to draw her child towards her with her feeble arms and lay my hand upon the little one 's head , looking up at me with sorrowful pleading eyes . She was quite speechless then , but I knew what the look meant , and answered it .
12530	12560	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" ' To the end of my life , my dear , ' I said , ' I shall love and cherish her to the end of my life . '
12561	12674	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" After this the child fell asleep in my arms as I sat by the bedside sharing the long melancholy watch with the landlady , who behaved very well at this sorrowful time . We sat in the quiet room all night , the little one wrapped in a shawl and nestled upon my breast . In the early summer morning Lucy Nowell died , very peacefully ; and I carried Marian down to the sofa in the parlour , and laid her there still asleep . She cried piteously for her mother when she awoke , and I had to tell her that which it is so hard to tell a child .
12675	12869	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" I wrote to Mr. Nowell at an address in Brussels which I found at the top of his last letter to his wife . No answer came . I wrote again , after a little while , with the same result ; and , in the mean time , the child had grown fonder of me and dearer to me every day . I had hired a nursemaid for her , and had taken an upper room for her nursery ; but she spent the greater part of her life with me , and I began to fancy that Providence intended I should keep her with me for the rest of her days . She told me , in her innocent childish way , that papa had never loved her as her mamma did . He had been always out of doors till very , very late at night . She had crept from her little bed sometimes when it was morning , quite light , and had found mamma in the sitting - room , with no fire , and the candles all burnt out , waiting for papa to come home .
12870	12940	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" I put an advertisement , addressed to Mr. Percival Nowell , in the Times and in Galignani , for I felt that the child 's future might depend upon her father 's acknowledgment of her in the present ; but no reply came to these advertisements , and I settled in my own mind that this Nowell was a scoundrel , who had deliberately deserted his wife and child .
12941	13159	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" The possessions of the poor creature who was gone were of no great value . There were some rather handsome clothes and a small collection of jewelry some of it modern , the rest curious and old - fashioned . These latter articles I kept religiously , believing them to be family relics . The clothes and the modern trinkets I caused to be sold , and the small sum realised for them barely paid the expense of the funeral and grave . The arrears of rent and all other arrears fell upon me . I paid them , and then left Brighton with the child and nurse . I was born not twenty miles from this place , and I had a fancy for ending my days in my native county ; so I came down to this part of the world , and looked about me a little , living in farm - house lodgings here and there , until I found this cottage to let one day , and decided upon settling at Lidford . And now you know the whole story of Marian 's adoption , Mr. Fenton . How happy we have been together , or what she has been to me since that time , I could never tell you . "
13160	13177	13179	13180	Gilbert Fenton	178	" The story does you credit , sir ; and I honour you for your goodness , "
13182	13187	13189	13190	the Captain	404	" Goodness , pshaw ! "
13194	13253	13189	13190	the Captain	404	" it has been a mere matter of self - indulgence on my part . The child made herself necessary to me from the very first . I was a solitary man , a confirmed bachelor , with every prospect of becoming a hard , selfish old fogey . Marian Nowell has been the sunshine of my life ! "
13254	13265	10769	10770	the Captain	404	" You never made any farther discoveries about Mr. Nowell ? "
13266	13392	13189	13190	the Captain	404	" Never . I have sometimes thought , that I ought to have made some stronger efforts to place myself in communication with him . I have thought this , especially when brooding upon the uncertainties of my darling 's future . From the little Mrs. Nowell told me about her marriage , I had reason to believe her husband 's father must have been a rich man . He might have softened towards his grandchild , in spite of his disapproval of the marriage . I sometimes think I ought to have sought out the grandfather . But , you see , it would have been uncommonly difficult to set about this , in my complete ignorance as to who or what he was . "
13393	13445	13464	13465	Captain Sedgewick	182	" Very difficult . And if you had found him , the chances are that he would have set his face against the child . Marian Nowell will have no need to supplicate for protection from an indifferent father or a hard - hearted grandfather , if she will be my wife .
13446	13463	13464	13465	Captain Sedgewick	182	" Heaven grant that she may love you as you deserve to be loved by her ! "
14152	14163	14164	14164	he	178	" My darling , I can not live without you ! "
14173	14181	14164	14164	he	178	" Tell me that you love me . "
14204	14210	14211	14211	she	183	" I think I do , "
14215	14223	14225	14225	Gilbert	178	" That is quite enough , Marian ! "
14229	14240	14225	14225	Gilbert	178	" I knew you were destined to be my wife . "
14291	14302	14304	14304	Gilbert	178	" Your niece has brought you a nephew , sir , "
14324	14340	14341	14341	he	404	" My dear boy , I can not tell you how happy this makes me ! "
14344	14377	14341	14341	he	404	" Did n't I promise you that all would go well if you were patient ? My little girl is wise enough to know the value of a good man 's love . "
14378	14387	14389	14389	Marian	183	" I am very grateful , uncle George , "
14399	14414	14389	14389	Marian	183	" only I do n't feel that I am worthy of so much thought . "
14415	14450	14341	14341	he	404	" Nonsense , child ; not worthy ! You are the best girl in Christendom , and will make the brightest and truest wife that ever made a man 's home dear to him . "
14682	14687	14689	14690	the matron	677	" Well , Gilbert , "
14707	14798	14689	14690	the matron	677	" I can only say , that if you must marry at all and I am sure I thought you had quite settled down as a bachelor , with your excellent lodgings in Wigmore Street , and every possible comfort in life I think you might have chosen much better than this . Of course , I do n't want to be rude or unpleasant ; but I can not help saying , that I consider any man a fool who allows himself to be captivated by a pretty face . "
14799	14817	14689	14690	the matron	677	" I have found a great deal more than a pretty face to admire in Marian Nowell . "
14818	14831	14689	14690	the matron	677	" Indeed ! Can you name any other advantages which she possesses ? "
14832	14845	14689	14690	the matron	677	" Amiability , good sense , and a pure and refined nature . "
14846	14889	14689	14690	the matron	677	" What warrant have you for all those things ? Mind , Gilbert , I like the girl well enough ; I have nothing to say against her ; but I can not help thinking it a most unfortunate match for you . "
14890	14894	14689	14690	the matron	677	" How unfortunate ? "
14895	14905	14689	14690	the matron	677	" The girl 's position is so very doubtful . "
14906	14909	14911	14911	Gilbert	178	" Position ! "
14914	14962	14911	14911	Gilbert	178	" That sort of talk is one of the consequences of living in such a place as Lidford . You talk about position , as if I were a prince of the blood - royal , whose marriage would be registered in every almanac in the kingdom . "
14963	14980	14982	14983	Mrs. Lister	181	" If she were really the Captain 's niece , it would be a different thing , "
14991	15019	14982	14983	Mrs. Lister	181	" but to marry a girl about whose relations nobody knows anything ! I suppose even you have not been told who her father and mother were . "
15020	15038	14689	14690	the matron	677	" I know quite enough about them . Captain Sedgewick has been candour itself upon the subject . "
15039	15049	14982	14983	Mrs. Lister	181	" And are the father and mother both dead ? "
15050	15061	14689	14690	the matron	677	" Miss Nowell 's mother has been dead many years . "
15062	15067	14982	14983	Mrs. Lister	181	" And her father ? "
15068	15081	14689	14690	the matron	677	" Captain Sedgewick does not know whether he is dead or living . "
15082	15085	15087	15088	Mrs. Lister	181	" Ah ! "
15094	15119	15087	15088	Mrs. Lister	181	" I should have thought as much . And you are really going to marry a girl with this disreputable mystery about her belongings ? "
15120	15161	14689	14690	the matron	677	" There is nothing either disreputable or mysterious . People are sometimes lost sight of in this world . Mr. Nowell was a bad husband and an indifferent father , and Captain Sedgewick adopted his daughter ; that is all . "
15162	15189	15087	15088	Mrs. Lister	181	" And no doubt , after you are married , this Mr. Nowell will make his appearance some day , and be a burden upon you . "
15190	15239	14689	14690	the matron	677	" I am not afraid of that . And now , Belle , as this is a subject upon which we do n't seem very likely to agree , I think we had better drop it . I considered it only right to tell you of my engagement . "
15264	15279	15280	15280	she	386	" You wo n't be married for some time to come , of course , "
15283	15302	15087	15088	Mrs. Lister	181	" I do n't know about that , Belle . There is nothing to prevent a speedy marriage . "
15303	15344	15252	15252	she	386	" O , surely you will wait a twelvemonth , at least . You have known Marian Nowell such a short time . You ought to put her to the test in some manner before you make her your wife . "
15345	15371	15087	15088	Mrs. Lister	181	" I have no occasion to put her to any kind of test . I have a most profound and perfect belief in her goodness . "
15372	15396	15252	15252	she	386	" Why , Gilbert , this is utter infatuation about a girl whom you have only known a little more than three weeks ! "
15609	15627	15628	15628	he	178	" You will have to come to town to choose our house , you know , Marian , "
15653	15746	15628	15628	he	178	" I could never venture upon such an important step without you : apart from all sentimental considerations , a woman 's judgment is indispensable in these matters . The house might be perfection in every other point , and there might be no boiler , or no butler 's pantry , or no cupboard for brooms on the landing , or some irremediable omission of that kind . Yes , Marian , your uncle must bring you to town for a week or so of house - hunting , and soon . "
15756	15759	15760	15760	she	687	" Soon ! "
15763	15819	15747	15747	She	687	" Yes , dear , very soon . There is nothing in the world to hinder our marriage . Why should we delay longer than to make all necessary arrangements ? I long so for my new home , Marian , I have never had a home in my life since I was a boy . "
15820	15826	15827	15827	she	687	" O Mr. Fenton Gilbert , "
15842	15928	15827	15827	she	687	" remember how short a time we have known each other . It is much too soon to talk or think of marriage yet . I want you to have plenty of leisure to consider whether you really care for me , whether it is n't only a fancy that will die out when you go back to London . And we ought to have time to know each other very well , Gilbert , to be quite sure we are suited to one another . "
15945	15960	15961	15961	he	178	" Have you any fear that we shall not suit each other , Marian ? "
15965	15977	15978	15978	she	386	" I know that you are only too good for me , "
17406	17411	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" Why , Jack , "
17435	17472	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" this is an agreeable surprise ! I was asking for you at the Pnyx last night , and Joe Hawdon told me you were away up the Danube he thought , on a canoe expedition . "
17473	17695	17764	17765	John Saltram	246	" It is only under some utterly impossible dispensation that Joseph Hawdon will ever be right about anything . I have been on a walking expedition in Brittany , dear boy , alone , and have found myself very bad company . I started soon after you went to your sister 's , and only came back last night . That scoundrel Levison promised me seventy - five this afternoon ; but whether I shall get it out of him is a fact only known to himself and the powers with which he holds communion . And was the rustic business pleasant , Gil ? Did you take kindly to the syllabubs and new milk , the summer sunrise over dewy fields , the pretty dairy - maids , and prize pigs , and daily inspections of the home - farm ? or did you find life rather dull down at Lidford ? I know the place well enough , and all the country round about there . I have stayed at Heatherly with Sir David Forster more than once for the shooting season . A pleasant fellow Forster , in a dissipated good - for - nothing kind of way , always up to his eyes in debt . Did you happen to meet him while you were down there ? "
17696	17708	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" No , I do n't think the Listers know him . "
17709	17733	17764	17765	John Saltram	246	" So much the better for them ! It is a vice to know him . And you were not dull at Lidford ? "
17734	17756	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" Very far from it , Jack . I was happier there than I have ever been in my life before . "
17757	17762	17764	17765	John Saltram	246	" Eh , Gil ! "
17767	17799	17764	17765	John Saltram	246	" that means something more than a quiet fortnight with a married sister . Come , old fellow , I have a vested right to a share in all your secrets . "
17800	17827	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" There is no secret , Jack . Yes , I have fallen in love , if that 's what you mean , and am engaged . "
17828	17845	17764	17765	John Saltram	246	" So soon ! That 's rather quick work , is n't it , dear boy ? "
17846	17898	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" I do n't think so . What is that the poet says ? ' If not an Adam at his birth , he is no love at all . ' My passion sprang into life full - grown after an hour 's contemplation of a beautiful face in Lidford church . "
17899	17905	17764	17765	John Saltram	246	" Who is the lady ? "
17906	17936	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" O , her position is not worth speaking of . She is the adopted niece of a half - pay captain an orphan , without money or connections . "
17937	17940	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" Humph ! "
17951	17969	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" not a very advantageous match for you , Gilbert , from a worldly point of view . "
17970	17983	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" I have not considered the matter from that point of view . "
17984	17997	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" And the lady is all that is charming , of course ? "
17998	18005	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" To my mind , yes . "
18006	18010	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" Very young ? "
18011	18014	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" Nineteen . "
18015	18142	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" Well , dear old follow , I wish you joy with all heartiness . You can afford to marry whom you please , and are very right to let inclination and not interest govern your choice . Whenever I tie myself in the bondage of matrimony , it will be to a lady who can pay my debts and set me on my legs for life . Whether such a one will ever consider my ugly face a fair equivalent for her specie , is an open question . You must introduce me to your future wife , Gilbert , on the first opportunity . I shall be very anxious to discover whether your marriage will be likely to put an end to our friendship . "
18143	18195	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" There is no fear of that , Jack . That is a contingency never to arise . I have told Marian a great deal about you already . She knows that I owe my life to you , and she is prepared to value you as much as I do . "
18196	18261	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" She is very good ; but all wives promise that kind of thing before marriage . And there is apt to come a day when the familiar bachelor friend falls under the domestic taboo , together with smoking in the drawing - room , brandy - and - soda , and other luxuries of the old , easy - going , single life . "
18262	18423	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" Marian is not very likely to prove a domestic tyrant . She is the gentlest dearest girl , and is very well used to bachelor habits in the person of her uncle . I do n't believe she will ever extinguish our cigars , Jack , even in the drawing - room . I look forward to the happiest home that ever a man possessed ; and it would be no home of mine if you were not welcome and honoured in it . I hope we shall spend many a summer evening on the lawn , Jack , with a bottle of Pomard or St. Julien between us , watching the drowsy old anglers in their punts , and the swift outriggers flashing past in the twilight . I mean to find some snug little place by the river , you know , Saltram somewhere about Teddington , where the gardens slope down to the water 's edge . "
18424	18473	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" Very pleasant ! and you will make an admirable family man , Gil . You have none of the faults that render me ineligible for the married state . I think your Marian is a very fortunate girl . What is her surname , by the way ? "
18474	18477	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" Nowell . "
18478	18496	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" Marian Nowell a very pretty name ! When do you think of going back to Lidford ? "
18497	18522	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" In about a month . My brother - in - law wants me to go back to them for the 1st of September . "
18523	18556	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" Then I think I shall run down to Forster 's , and have a pop at the pheasants . It will give me an opportunity of being presented to Miss Nowell . "
18557	18578	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" I shall be very pleased to introduce you , old fellow . I know that you will admire her . "
18579	18617	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" Well , I am not a very warm admirer of the sex in general ; but I am sure to like your future wife , Gil , if it is only because you have chosen her . "
18618	18632	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" And your own affairs , Jack how have they been going on ? "
18633	18662	17942	17943	John Saltram	246	" Not very brightly . I am not a lucky individual , you know . Destiny and I have been at odds ever since I was a schoolboy . "
18663	18671	17413	17413	Gilbert	178	" Not in love yet , John ? "
18672	18675	18676	18677	the other	595	" No , "
18728	18741	18742	18742	he	595	" You see , the fact of the matter is , Gil , "
18747	18865	18742	18742	he	595	" as I told you just now , if ever I do marry , mercenary considerations are likely to be at the bottom of the business . I do n't mean to say that I would marry a woman I disliked , and take it out of her in ill - usage or neglect . I am not quite such a scoundrel as that . But if I had the luck to meet with a woman I could like , tolerably pretty and agreeable , and all that kind of thing , and weak enough to care for me a woman with a handsome fortune I should be a fool not to snap at such a chance . "
18866	18870	18872	18872	Gilbert	178	" I see , "
18874	18883	18872	18872	Gilbert	178	" you have met with such a woman . "
18884	18888	18742	18742	he	595	" I have . "
18923	19034	18872	18872	Gilbert	178	" But you are not in love with her ; I see that in your face , Jack . You 'll think me a sentimental fool , I daresay , and fancy I look at things in a new light now that I 'm down a pit myself ; but , for God 's sake , do n't marry a woman you ca n't love . Tolerably pretty and agreeable wo n't do , Jack , that means indifference on your part ; and , depend upon it , when a man and woman are tied together for life , there is only a short step from indifference to dislike . "
19035	19045	19054	19054	his	736	" No , Gilbert , it 's not that , "
19057	19239	19054	19054	his	736	" I really like the lady well enough love her , I daresay . I have not had much experience of the tender passion since I was jilted by an Oxford barmaid whom I would have married , by Jove . But the truth is , the lady in question is n't free to marry just yet . There 's a husband in the case a feeble old Anglo - Indian , who ca n't live very long . Do n't look so glum , old fellow ; there has been nothing wrong , not a word that all the world might not hear ; but there are signs and tokens by which a man , without any vanity and heaven knows I have no justification for that may be sure a woman likes him . In short , I believe that if Adela Branston were a widow , the course would lie clear before me , and I should have nothing to do but go in and win . And the stakes will be worth winning , I assure you . "
19240	19266	18872	18872	Gilbert	178	" But this Mr. Branston may live for an indefinite number of years , during which you will be wasting your life on a shadow . "
19267	19378	19054	19054	his	736	" Not very likely . Poor old Branston came home from Calcutta a confirmed invalid , and I believe his sentence has been pronounced by all the doctors . In the mean time he makes the best of life , has his good days and bad days , and entertains a great deal of company at a delightful place near Maidenhead with a garden sloping to the river like that you were talking of just now , only on a very extensive scale . You know how often I have wanted you to run down there with me , and how there has been always something to prevent your going . "
19379	19430	18872	18872	Gilbert	178	" Yes , I remember . Rely upon it , I shall contrive to accept the next invitation , come what may . But I ca n't say I like the idea of this prospective kind of courtship , or that I consider it quite worthy of you , Saltram . "
19431	19608	19054	19054	his	736	" My dear Gilbert , when a fellow is burdened with debt and of a naturally idle disposition , he is apt to take rather a liberal view of such means of advancement in life as may present themselves to him . But there is no prospective courtship nothing at all resembling a courtship in this case , believe me . Mrs. Branston knows that I like and admire her . She knows as much of almost every man who goes to Rivercombe ; for there are plenty who will be disposed to go in against me for the prize by - and - by . But I think that she likes me better than any one else , and that the chances will be all in my favour . From first to last there has not been a word spoken between us which old Branston himself might not hear . As to Adela 's marrying again when he is gone , he could scarcely be so fatuous as not to foresee the probability of that . "
19609	19614	18872	18872	Gilbert	178	" Is she pretty ? "
19615	19708	19054	19054	his	736	" Very pretty , in rather a childish way , with blue eyes and fair hair . She is not my ideal among women , but no man ever marries his ideal . The man who has sworn by eyes as black as a stormy midnight and raven hair generally unites himself to the most insipid thing in blondes , and the idolater of golden locks takes to wife some frizzy - haired West Indian with an unmistakable dip of the tar - brush . When will you go down to Rivercombe ? "
19709	19714	18872	18872	Gilbert	178	" Whenever you like . "
19715	19764	19054	19054	his	736	" The nabob is hospitality itself , and will be delighted to see you if he is to the fore when you go . I fancy there is some kind of regatta a race or two , at any rate on Saturday afternoon . Will that suit you ? "
19765	19770	18872	18872	Gilbert	178	" Very well indeed . "
19771	19850	19054	19054	his	736	" Then we can meet at the station . There is a train down at 2.15 . But we are going to see something of each other in the meantime , I hope . I know that I am a sore hindrance to business at such an hour as this . Will you dine with me at the Pnyx at seven to - night ? I shall be able to tell you how I got on with Levison . "
19851	19855	18872	18872	Gilbert	178	" With pleasure . "
20309	20322	20323	20323	he	246	" I am afraid she is rather a namby - pamby person , "
20326	20353	20323	20323	he	246	" with nothing but her beauty to recommend her . That wonderful gift of beauty has such power to bewitch the most sensible man upon occasion . "
20717	20729	20730	20730	she	214	" I have heard so much of you from Mr. Saltram , "
20733	20754	20730	20730	she	214	" He is always praising you . I believe he cares more for you than anyone else in the world . "
20755	20765	20767	20768	John Saltram	246	" I have not many people to care for , "
20770	20780	20767	20768	John Saltram	246	" and Gilbert is a friend of long standing . "
20800	20814	20815	20815	she	214	" I am sorry you will not see my husband to - day , "
20823	20832	20815	20815	she	214	" It is one of his bad days . "
21706	21722	21723	21724	Mr. Saltram	808	" Well , Gilbert , old fellow , what do you think of the lady ? "
21739	21813	21723	21724	Mr. Saltram	808	" I think her very pretty , Jack , and well yes upon the whole fascinating . But I do n't like the look of the thing altogether , and I fancy there 's considerable bad taste in giving parties with an invalid husband upstairs . I was wondering how Mr. Branston liked the noise of all that talk and laughter in the dining - room , or the music that came afterwards . "
21814	21910	21723	21724	Mr. Saltram	808	" My dear fellow , old Branston delights in society . He is generally well enough to sit in the drawing - room and look on at his wife 's parties . He does n't talk much on those occasions . Indeed , I believe he is quite incapable of conversing about anything except the rise and fall of Indian stock , or the fluctuations in the value of indigo . And , you see , Adela married him with the intention of enjoying her life . She confesses as much sometimes with perfect candour . "
21911	21924	21926	21927	Gilbert Fenton	178	" I daresay she is very candid , and just as shallow , "
21944	22037	21723	21724	Mr. Saltram	808	" Well yes , I suppose she is rather shallow . Those pretty pleasant little women generally are , I think . Depth of feeling and force of mind are so apt to go along with blue spectacles and a rugged aspect . A woman 's prettiness must stand for something . There is so much real pleasure in the contemplation of a charming face , that a man had need rescind a little in the way of mental qualifications . And I do not think Adela Branston is without a heart . "
22038	22055	22056	22057	his friend	734	" You praise her very warmly . Are you really in love with her , John ? "
22061	22148	21723	21724	Mr. Saltram	808	" No , Gilbert , upon my honour . I heartily wish I were . I wish I could give her more by - and - by , when death brings about her release from Michael Branston , than the kind of liking I feel for her . No , I am not in love with her ; but I think she likes me ; and a man must be something worse than a brute if he is not grateful for a pretty woman 's regard . "
22987	22990	22991	22991	he	178	" Well , "
23001	23146	22994	22994	himself	178	" a man can take this fever but once in his life , and it is only wise in him to surrender himself utterly to the divine delirium . I shall have no excuse for neglecting business by - and - by , when my little wife and I are settled down together for the rest of our days . Let me be her lover while I may . Can I ever be less than her lover , I wonder ? Will marriage , or custom , or the assurance that we belong to each other for the rest of our days , take the poetry out of our lives ? I think not ; I think Marian must always be to me what she has seemed to me from the very first something better and brighter than the common things of this life . "
23756	23765	23767	23768	the Captain	404	" What , have you never been here ? "
23770	23781	23767	23768	the Captain	404	" then you have never seen Heatherly , I suppose ? "
23782	23798	23800	23800	Gilbert	178	" Never . By the way , is not that Sir David Forster 's place ? "
23845	23936	23767	23768	the Captain	404	" Yes . It is something of a show - place , too ; and we think a good deal of it in these parts . There are some fine Sir Joshuas among the family portraits , painted in the days when the Forsters were better off and of more importance in the county than they are now . And there are a few other good pictures Dutch interiors , and some seascapes by Bakhuysen . Decidedly you ought to see Heatherly . Shall we push on there this afternoon ? "
23937	23944	23800	23800	Gilbert	178	" Is it far from here ? "
23945	24016	23767	23768	the Captain	404	" Not much more than a mile . This wood joins the park , and there is a public right of way across the park to the Lidford road , so the gate is always open . We ca n't waste our walk , and I know Sir David quite well enough to ask him to let you see the pictures , if he should happen to be at home . "
24017	24026	24028	24028	Gilbert	178	" I should like it of all things , "
24031	24079	24028	24028	Gilbert	178	" My friend John Saltram knows this Sir David Forster , and he talked of being down here at this time : I forgot all about it till you spoke of Heatherly just now . I have a knack of forgetting things now - a - days . "
24080	24095	24097	24097	Marian	183	" I wonder that you should forget anything connected with Mr. Saltram , Gilbert , "
24099	24138	24097	24097	Marian	183	" that Mr. Saltram of whom you think so much . I can not tell you how anxious I am to see what kind of person he is ; not handsome you have confessed as much as that . "
24139	24236	24028	24028	Gilbert	178	" Yes , Marian , I admit the painful fact . There are people who call John Saltram ugly . But his face is not a common one ; it is a very picturesque kind of ugliness a face that Velasquez would have loved to paint , I think . It is a rugged , strongly - marked countenance with a villanously dark complexion ; but the eyes are very fine , the mouth perfection ; and there is a look of power in the face that , to my mind , is better than beauty . "
24237	24256	24097	24097	Marian	183	" And I think you owned that Mr. Saltram is hardly the most agreeable person in the world . "
24257	24421	24028	24028	Gilbert	178	" Well , no , he is not what one could well call an eminently agreeable person . And yet he exercises a good deal of influence over the men he knows , without admitting many of them to his friendship . He is very clever ; not a brilliant talker by any means , except on rare occasions , when he chooses to give full swing to his powers ; he does not lay himself out for social successes ; but he is a man who seems to know more of every subject than the men about him . I doubt if he will ever succeed at the Bar . He has so little perseverance or steadiness , and indulges in such an erratic , desultory mode of life ; but he has made his mark in literature already , and I think he might become a great man if he chose . Whether he ever will choose is a doubtful question . "
24422	24438	24440	24440	Marian	183	" I am afraid he must be rather a dissipated , dangerous kind of person , "
24442	24632	24634	24635	Gilbert Fenton	178	" Well , yes , he is subject to occasional outbreaks of dissipation . They do n't last long , and they seem to leave not the faintest impression upon his herculean constitution ; but of course that sort of thing does more or less injury to a man 's mind , however comparatively harmless the form of his dissipation may be . There are very few men whom John Saltram can not drink under the table , and rise with a steady brain himself when the wassail is ended ; yet I believe , in a general way , few men drink less than he does . At cards he is equally strong ; a past - master in all games of skill ; and the play is apt to be rather high at one or two of the clubs he belongs to . He has a wonderful power of self - restraint when he cares to exert it ; will play six or seven hours every night for three weeks at a stretch , and then not touch a card for six months . Poor old John , "
24644	24657	24634	24635	Gilbert Fenton	178	" under happy circumstances , he might be such a good man . "
24658	24672	24674	24674	Marian	183	" But I fear he is a dangerous friend for you , Gilbert , "
24684	24722	24634	24635	Gilbert Fenton	178	" No , darling , I have never shared his wilder pleasures . There are a few chosen spirits with whom he consorts at such times . I believe this Sir David Forster is one of them . "
24723	24738	24740	24741	the Captain	404	" Sir David has the reputation of leading rather a wild life in London , "
24743	24873	24740	24741	the Captain	404	" and of bringing a dissipated set down here every autumn . Things have not gone well with him . His wife , who was a very beautiful girl , and whom he passionately loved , was killed by a fall from her horse a few months after the birth of her first child . The child died too , and the double loss ruined Sir David . He used to spend the greater part of his life at Heatherly , and was a general favourite among the county people ; but since that time he has avoided the place , except during the shooting season . He has a hunting - box in the shires , and is a regular daredevil over a big country they tell me . "
25301	25309	25311	25311	Gilbert	178	" Rather a hideous style of place , "
25320	25390	25311	25311	Gilbert	178	" but I think show - places , as a general rule , excel in ugliness . I daresay the owners of them find a dismal kind of satisfaction in considering the depressing influence their dreary piles of bricks - and - mortar must exercise on the minds of strangers ; may be a sort of compensation for being obliged to live in such a gaol of a place . "
26271	26288	26289	26289	he	625	" I want you to think of me as a kind of brother , Miss Nowell , "
26298	26392	26289	26289	he	625	" Gilbert and I have been something like brothers for the last twelve years of our lives , and it would be a hard thing , for one of us at least , if our friendship should ever be lessened . You shall find me discretion itself by - and - by , and you shall see that I can respect Gilbert 's altered position ; but I should n't like to lose him , and I do n't think you look capable of setting your face against your husband 's old friend . "
26443	26473	26474	26474	she	183	" I do n't believe I should ever have the power to diminish Gilbert 's regard for you , Mr. Saltram , even were I inclined to do so , "
26477	26512	26474	26474	she	183	" O yes , you would ; your power over him will be illimitable , depend upon it . But now I have seen you , I think you will only use it wisely . "
26521	26537	26538	26538	she	183	" I am much more fitted to be ruled than to rule , Mr. Saltram , "
26541	26563	26538	26538	she	183	" I am utterly inexperienced in the world , you know , and Mr. Fenton is my superior in every way . "
26564	26578	26513	26513	Marian	183	" Your superior in years , I know , but in what else ? "
26579	26611	26538	26538	she	183	" In everything else . In intellect and judgment , as well as in knowledge of the world . You could never imagine what a quiet changeless life I have led . "
26612	26649	26513	26513	Marian	183	" Your intellect is so much the clearer for that , I think . It has not been disturbed by all the narrow petty influences of a life spent in what is called ' society . ' "
26847	26852	26853	26853	he	178	" Well , John ? "
26856	26898	26833	26833	he	178	" Well , dear old boy , she is all that is beautiful and charming , and I can only congratulate you upon your choice . Miss Nowell 's perfection is a subject about which there can not be two opinions . "
26899	26909	26833	26833	he	178	" And you think she loves me , Jack ? "
26910	26938	26833	26833	he	178	" Do I think she loves you ? Why , surely , Gil , that is not a question upon which you want another man 's judgment ? "
26939	26970	26833	26833	he	178	" No , of course not , but one is never tired of receiving the assurance of that fact . And you could see by her way of speaking about me "
26971	26992	26833	26833	he	178	" She spoke of you in the prettiest manner possible . She seems to consider you quite a superior being . "
26993	27034	26833	26833	he	178	" Dear girl , she is so good and simple - hearted . Do you know , Jack , I feel as if I could never be sufficiently grateful to Providence for my happiness in having won such an angel . "
27035	27134	26833	26833	he	178	" Well , you certainly have reason to consider yourself a very lucky fellow ; but I doubt if any man ever deserved good fortune better than you do , Gilbert . And now , good - bye . It 's getting unconscionably late , and I shall scarcely get back in time to change my clothes for dinner . We spend all our evenings in pious devotion to billiards , with a rubber or two , or a little lansquenet towards the small hours . Do n't forget your engagement to - morrow ; good - bye . "
27815	27825	27801	27801	he	178	" Farewell , but whenever you welcome the hour , "
27961	27969	27970	27970	he	178	" Is there anything amiss , Jack ? "
27973	27997	27970	27970	he	178	" I know high spirits are not always a sign of inward contentment with you . Is there anything wrong to - night ? "
27998	28001	27937	27938	John Saltram	246	" No . "
28002	28009	27970	27970	he	178	" Are you sure of that ? "
28010	28027	27937	27938	John Saltram	246	" Quite sure . I may be a little knocked up perhaps ; that 's all . "
28071	28201	27937	27938	John Saltram	246	" MY DEAR GILBERT , I find myself obliged to leave this place for London at once , and have not time to thank anyone for the kindness I have received during my stay . Will you do the best to repair this omission on my part , and offer my warmest expressions of gratitude to Captain Sedgewick and Miss Nowell for their goodness to me ? Pray apologise for me also to Mr. and Mrs. Lister for my inability to make my adieux in a more formal manner than this , a shortcoming which I hope to atone for on some future visit . Tell Lister I shall be very pleased to see him if he will look me up at the Pnyx when he is next in town .
28202	28209	28245	28246	Gilbert Fenton	178	" Ever yours , JOHN SALTRAM . "
28270	28282	28283	28283	he	178	" His money matters may have fallen into a desperate condition , "
28286	28303	28283	28283	he	178	" or perhaps that woman that Mrs. Branston , is at the bottom of the business . "
28360	28378	28379	28379	he	178	" I suppose it is because I lectured him a little about Mrs. Branston the other day , "
28384	28445	28379	28379	he	178	" The business is connected with her in some way , I daresay , and poor Jack does not care to arouse my virtuous indignation . That comes of taking a high moral tone with one 's friend . He swallows the pill with a decent grace at the time , and shuts one out of his confidence ever afterwards . "
29561	29573	29574	29574	he	178	" A few months more or less can make little difference , "
29587	29721	29574	29574	he	178	" Marian will be quite safe in her old uncle 's care ; and I do not suppose either of you will love each other any the less for the delay . I have such perfect confidence in you , Gilbert , you see ; and it is such a happiness to me to know that my darling 's future is in the hands of a man I can so thoroughly trust . Were you reduced to absolute poverty , with the battle of life to fight all over again , I would give you my dear girl without fear of the issue . I know you are of the stuff that is not to be beaten ; and I believe that neither time nor circumstance could ever change your love for her . "
29722	29769	29819	29819	he	178	" You may believe that . Every day makes her dearer to me . I should be ashamed to tell you how bitterly I feel this parting , and what a desperate mental struggle I went through before I could make up my mind to go . "
29814	29818	29819	29819	he	178	" My darling , "
29839	29861	29819	29819	he	178	" how ill you are looking ! I fear I made my letter too dismal , and that it frightened you . "
29862	29885	29819	29819	he	178	" Oh no , no . I am very sorry you should have this bad fortune , Gilbert , that is all . "
29886	29924	29819	29819	he	178	" There is nothing which I do not hope to repair , dear . The losses are not more than I can stand . All that I take to heart is the separation from you , Marian . "
29925	29934	29935	29935	she	183	" I am not worth so much regret , "
29956	29965	29966	29966	he	178	" Not worth so much regret , Marian ! "
29969	29986	29966	29966	he	178	" You are all the world to me ; the beginning and end of my universe . "
30246	30269	30270	30270	he	182	" I do n't suppose my little girl ever showed you her mother 's jewel - case , did she , Gilbert ? "
30273	30276	30226	30226	he	182	" Never . "
30277	30383	30384	30384	Marian	183	" I thought as much . It contains that old - fashioned jewelry I spoke of family relics , which I have sometimes fancied might be of use to her , if ever her birthright were worth claiming . But I doubt if that will ever happen now that so many years have gone by , and there has been no endeavour to trace her . Run and fetch the case , Marian . There are some of its contents which Gilbert ought to see before he leaves England papers which I intended to show him when I first told him your mother 's story . "
30518	30520	30554	30555	Lucy Geoffry	229	" M.G. "
30593	30621	30623	30624	the Captain	404	" I have read them carefully ever so many times , with the notion that they might throw some light upon Mr. and Mrs. Nowell 's antecedents , "
30647	30747	30627	30627	Gilbert	178	" but they tell very little . I fancy that Miss Geoffry was a governess in some family in London the envelopes are missing , you see , so there is no evidence as to where she was living , except that it was in London and that she left her employment to marry this Percival Nowell . You 'd like to read the letters yourself , I daresay , Gilbert . Put them in your pocket , and look them over at your leisure when you get home . You can bring them back before you leave Lidford . "
30783	30797	30798	30798	he	178	" You do n't mind my reading your father 's letters , Marian ? "
30801	30816	30766	30766	She	183	" Not at all . Only I think you will find them very uninteresting . "
30817	30827	30828	30828	He	178	" I am interested in everything that concerns you . "
30968	30980	30981	30982	Mr. Nowell	201	" If you loved me , as you pretend , Lucy , "
30988	31029	30981	30982	Mr. Nowell	201	" you would speedily exchange this degrading slavery for liberty and happiness with me , and would be content to leave the future utterly in my hands , without question or fear . A really generous woman would do this . "
31391	31411	31373	31373	Marian	183	" Gilbert , there is something which I think I ought to say to you before you go away . "
31412	31420	31373	31373	Marian	183	" What is that , my darling ? "
31421	31503	31373	31373	Marian	183	" It is rather hard to say . I fear it will give you pain . I have been thinking about it for a long time . The thought has been a constant reproach to me . Gilbert , it would be better if we were both free ; better if you could leave England without any tie to weigh you down with anxieties when you are out yonder , and will have so much occasion for perfect freedom of mind . "
31504	31507	31373	31373	Marian	183	" Marian ! "
31508	31564	31373	31373	Marian	183	" O , pray , pray do n't think me ungrateful or unmindful of your goodness to me . I am only anxious for your happiness . I am not steady enough , or fixed enough , in my mind . I am not worthy of all the thought and care you have given me . "
31565	31577	31373	31373	Marian	183	" Marian , have I done anything to forfeit your love ? "
31578	31584	31373	31373	Marian	183	" O no , no . "
31585	31604	31373	31373	Marian	183	" Then why do you say these things to me ? Do you want to break my heart ? "
31605	31621	31373	31373	Marian	183	" Would it break your heart if I were to recall my promise , Gilbert ? "
31622	31627	31628	31628	he	1065	" Yes , Marian , "
31648	31701	31628	31628	he	1065	" but if you do not love me , if you can not love me and God knows how happy I have been in the belief that I had won your love long ago let the word be spoken . I will bear it , my dear , I will bear it . "
31702	31708	31709	31709	she	1066	" O no , no , "
31726	31797	31709	31709	she	1066	" I will try to be worthy of you . I will try to love you as you deserve to be loved . It was only a fancy of mine that it would be better for you to be free from all thoughts of me . I think it would seem very hard to me to lose your love . I do n't think I could bear that , Gilbert . "
31848	31861	31862	31862	he	1065	" My dearest , my life is bound up with your love , "
31865	31877	31862	31862	he	1065	" Nothing can part us except your ceasing to love me . "
31880	31884	31862	31862	he	1065	" GOOD - BYE "
32018	32027	32028	32028	he	178	" She may die while I am away , "
32031	32070	32028	32028	he	178	" O God , if that were to happen ! If I were to come back and find her dead ! Such things have been ; and men and women have borne them , and gone on living . "
32372	32383	32384	32384	he	178	" Who is it ? and what do you want ? "
32406	32425	32384	32384	he	178	" Why , Jack , I do n't think I ever caught you so hard at work before . "
32455	32506	32443	32443	He	246	" No , I do n't generally go at it quite so hard ; but you know I have a knack of doing things against time . I have been giving myself a spell of hard work in order to pick up a little cash for the children of Israel . "
32558	32566	32550	32551	Gilbert Fenton	178	" What is the matter , Gil ? "
32567	32621	32741	32741	He	1083	" You are the matter . You are looking as worn and haggard as if you 'd had a long illness since I saw you last . I never remember you looking so ill . This kind of thing wo n't do , John . You 'd soon kill yourself at this rate . "
32622	32718	32550	32551	Gilbert Fenton	178	" Not to be done , my dear fellow . I am the toughest thing in creation . I have been sitting up all night for the last week or so , and that does rather impair the freshness of one 's complexion ; but I assure you there 's nothing so good for a man as a week or two of unbroken work . I have been doing an exhaustive review of Roman literature for one of the quarterlies , and the subject involved a little more reading than I was quite prepared for . "
32719	32728	32786	32786	Gilbert	178	" And you have really not been ill ? "
32729	32740	32550	32551	Gilbert Fenton	178	" Not in the least . I am never ill . "
32830	32836	32837	32837	he	1083	" This is strange news , "
32840	32854	32837	32837	he	1083	" and it will cause the postponement of your marriage , I suppose ? "
32855	32873	32809	32809	He	1083	" Unhappily , yes ; that is unavoidable . Hard lines , is n't it , Jack ? "
32874	32906	32837	32837	he	1083	" Well , yes ; I daresay the separation seems rather a hardship ; but you are young enough to stand a few months ' delay . When do you sail ? "
32907	32912	32809	32809	He	1083	" To - morrow . "
32913	32917	32837	32837	he	1083	" So soon ? "
32918	32994	32809	32809	He	1083	" Yes . It is a case in which everything depends upon rapidity of action . I leave Liverpool to - morrow afternoon . I came up from Lidford to - day on purpose to spend a few farewell hours with you . And I have been thinking , Jack , that you might run down to Liverpool with me to - morrow , and see the last of me , eh , old fellow ? "
33005	33044	32837	32837	he	1083	" It would be only a kind thing to do , Jack , and a wholesome change for yourself into the bargain . Anything would be better for you than being shut up in these chambers another day . "
33045	33056	33058	33059	Mr. Saltram	1084	" Well , Gilbert , I 'll go with you , "
33067	33150	33058	33059	Mr. Saltram	1084	" It is a small thing to do for friendship . Yes , I 'll see you off , dear boy . Egad , I wish I could go to Australia with you . I would , if it were not for my engagements with the children and sundry other creditors . I think a new country might do me good . But there 's no use in talking about that . I 'm bound hand and foot to the old one . "
33151	33212	32837	32837	he	1083	" That reminds me of something I had to say to you , John . There must have been some reason for your leaving Lidford in that sudden way the other day , and your note explained nothing . I thought you and I had no secrets from each other , It 's scarcely fair to treat me like that . "
33213	33221	33223	33224	the other	595	" The business was hardly worth explaining , "
33227	33251	33223	33224	the other	595	" A bill that I had forgotten for the time fell due just then , and I hurried off to set things straight . "
33252	33263	32837	32837	he	1083	" Let me help you somehow or other , Jack . "
33264	33419	33223	33224	the other	595	" No , Gilbert ; I will never suffer you to become entangled in the labyrinth of my affairs . You do n't know what a hopeless wilderness you would enter if you were desperate enough to attempt my rescue . I have been past redemption for the last ten years , ever since I left Oxford . Nothing but a rich marriage will ever set me straight ; and I sometimes doubt if that game is worth the candle , and whether it would not be better to make a clean sweep of my engagements , offer up my name to the execration of mankind and the fiery indignation of solvent journalists , who would find subject for sensation leaders in my iniquities , emigrate , and turn bushranger . A wild free life in the wilderness must be a happy exchange for all the petty worries and perplexities of this cursed existence . "
33420	33450	32837	32837	he	1083	" And how about Mrs. Branston , John ? By the way , I thought that she might have had something to do with your sudden journey to London . "
33451	33474	33223	33224	the other	595	" No ; she had nothing to do with it . I have not seen her since I came back from Lidford . "
33475	33478	32837	32837	he	1083	" Indeed ! "
33479	33492	33494	33495	Mr. Saltram	1086	" No . Your lecture had a potent effect , you see , "
33503	33513	33494	33495	Mr. Saltram	1086	" You have almost cured me of that passion . "
33514	33559	32837	32837	he	1083	" My opinion would have very little influence if you were far gone , John . The fact is , Mrs. Branston , pretty and agreeable as she may be , is not the sort of woman to acquire any strong hold upon you . "
33560	33565	33494	33495	Mr. Saltram	1086	" You think not ? "
33566	33573	32837	32837	he	1083	" I am sure of it . "
33730	33741	33742	33742	he	178	" You refuse the help of my purse , Jack , "
33745	33811	33742	33742	he	178	" and forget that I owe you my life . I should never have been to the fore to navigate the good ship Fenton and Co. , if it had n't been for your care . The doctor fellow at Cairo told me as much in very plain terms . Yes , John , I consider myself your debtor to the amount of a life . "
33812	33863	34068	34069	John Saltram	246	" Saving a man 's life is sometimes rather a doubtful boon . I think if I had a fever , and some officious fool dragged me through it when I was in a fair way to make a decent end , I should be very savagely disposed towards him . "
33864	33912	33742	33742	he	178	" Why , John Saltram , you are the last man in the world from whom I should expect that dreary kind of talk . Yet I suppose it 's only a natural consequence of shutting yourself up in these rooms for ten days at a stretch . "
33913	33929	33931	33933	the other bitterly	1091	" What good use have I made of my life in the past , Gilbert ? "
33935	34062	33931	33933	the other bitterly	1091	" and what have I to look forward to in the future ? To marry , and redeem my position by the aid of a woman 's money . That 's hardly the noblest destiny that can befall a man . And yet I think if Adela Branston were free , and willing to marry me , I might make something of my life . I might go into Parliament , and make something of a name for myself . I could write books instead of anonymous articles . I should scarcely sink down into an idle mindless existence of dinner - giving and dinner - eating . Yes , I think the best thing that could happen to me would be to marry Adela Branston . "
34162	34225	34148	34148	they	1092	" Good - bye , Gilbert , and God bless you ! If if anything should happen to me if I should have gone to the bad utterly before you come back , you must try to remember our friendship of the past . Think that I have loved you very dearly as well as one man ever loved another , perhaps . "
34226	34313	34337	34338	John Saltram	246	" My dear John , you have no need to tell me to think that . Nothing can ever weaken the love between us . And you are not likely to go to the bad . Good bye , dear old friend . I shall remember you every day of my life . You are second only to Marian in my heart . I shall write you an account of my proceedings , and shall expect to hear from you . Once more , good bye . "
34471	34474	34475	34475	He	246	" Lidford . "
34488	34491	34493	34494	the Baronet	1108	" DEAR SALTRAM "
34496	34628	34493	34494	the Baronet	1108	" What do you mean by this iniquitous conduct ? You only obtained my consent to your hurried departure the other day on condition you should come back in a week , yet there are no signs of you . Foljambe and the lawyer are gone , and I am alone with Harker , whose stupidity is something marvellous . I am dying by inches of this dismal state of things . I ca n't tell the man to go , you see , for he is really a most worthy creature , although such a consummate fool . For pity 's sake come to me . You can do your literary work down here as well as in London , and I promise to respect your laborious hours . Ever yours ,
34629	34633	34634	34635	John Saltram	246	" DAVID FORSTER . "
34658	34662	34663	34663	he	246	" Go back ! "
34667	34695	34663	34663	he	246	" go back , when I thought I did such a great thing in coming away ! No , I am not weak enough for that folly . "
35931	35949	35950	35950	she	5214	" Were you wishing to make any inquiries about the last occupants of Hazel Cottage , sir ? "
35953	35956	35957	35957	Gilbert	178	" Yes , "
36092	36114	36116	36117	this lady	1163	" Perhaps you would be so good as to walk into my sitting - room for a few moments , sir , "
36125	36140	36116	36117	this lady	1163	" I shall be most happy to afford you any information about your friends . "
36141	36147	36149	36149	Gilbert	178	" You are very good , "
36190	36196	36198	36199	the lady	389	" My name is Dodd , "
36208	36297	36198	36199	the lady	389	" Miss Letitia Dodd . I had the pleasure of seeing you very often during your visits next door . I was not on visiting terms with Captain Sedgewick and Miss Nowell , although we bowed to each other out of doors . I am only a tradesman 's daughter indeed my brother is now carrying on business as a butcher in Fairleigh and of course I am quite aware of the difference in our positions . I am the last person to intrude myself upon my superiors . "
36298	36314	36315	36315	Gilbert	178	" If you will be so kind as to tell me where they have gone ? "
36331	36337	36338	36338	she	232	" Where they have gone ! "
36341	36351	36338	36338	she	232	" Dear , dear ! Then you do not know "
36352	36359	36198	36199	the lady	389	" I do not know what ? "
36360	36367	36338	36338	she	232	" Of Captain Sedgewick 's death . "
36368	36382	36198	36199	the lady	389	" Good God ! My dear old friend ! When did he die ? "
36383	36441	36338	36338	she	232	" At the beginning of the year . It was very sudden a fit of apoplexy . He was seized in the night , poor dear gentleman , and it was only discovered when the servant went to call him in the morning . He only lived two days after the seizure ; and never spoke again . "
36442	36462	36198	36199	the lady	389	" And Miss Nowell what made her leave the cottage ? She is still at Lidford , I suppose ? "
36463	36484	36338	36338	she	232	" O dear no , Mr. Fenton . She went away altogether about a month after the Captain 's death . "
36485	36491	36198	36199	the lady	389	" Where did she go ? "
36492	36594	36338	36338	she	232	" I can not tell you that , I did not even know that she intended leaving Hazel Cottage until the day after she left . When I saw the shutters closed and the board up , you might have knocked me down with a feather . Miss Nowell was so much liked in Lidford , and she had more than one invitation from friends to stay with them for the sake of a change after her uncle 's death ; but she would not visit anywhere . She stayed quite alone in the cottage , with only the old servant . "
36595	36613	36615	36615	Gilbert	178	" But there must surely be some one in the place who knows where she has gone ! "
36617	36693	36338	36338	she	232	" I think not . The landlord of Hazel Cottage does not know . He is my landlord also , and I was asking him about Miss Nowell when I paid my rent the other day . He said he supposed she had gone away to be married . That has been the general impression , in fact , at Lidford . People made sure that Miss Nowell had left to be married to you . "
36694	36729	36788	36788	He	178	" I have only just returned from Australia . I have come back to fulfil my engagement to Miss Nowell . Can you suggest no one from whom I am likely to obtain information ? "
36730	36769	36338	36338	she	232	" There is the family at the Rectory ; they knew her very well , and were extremely kind to her after her uncle 's death . It might be worth your while to call upon Mr. Marchant . "
36770	36777	36778	36778	Gilbert	178	" Yes , I will call , "
36781	36787	36778	36778	Gilbert	178	" thanks for the suggestion . "
36927	36940	36941	36941	Gilbert	178	" I have come to you full of care , Mr. Marchant , "
36944	36960	36941	36941	Gilbert	178	" and the pressing nature of my business must excuse the lateness of my visit . "
36961	37048	36941	36941	Gilbert	178	" There is no occasion for any excuse . I am very glad to see you at this time . Pray help yourself to some wine , there are clean glasses near you ; and take some of those strawberries , on which my wife prides herself amazingly . People who live in the country all their days are obliged to give their minds to horticulture . And now , what is this care of yours , Mr. Fenton ? Nothing very serious , I hope . "
37049	37071	36941	36941	Gilbert	178	" It is very serious to me at present . I think you know that I am engaged to Miss Nowell . "
37072	37151	36941	36941	Gilbert	178	" Perfectly . I had imagined until this moment that you and she were married . When she left Lidford , I concluded that she had gone to stay with friends of yours , and that the marriage would , in all probability , take place at an early period , without any strict observance of etiquette as to her mourning for her uncle . It was natural that we should think this , knowing her solitary position . "
37152	37166	36941	36941	Gilbert	178	" Then you do not know where she went on leaving this place ? "
37167	37246	36941	36941	Gilbert	178	" Not in the faintest degree . Her departure was altogether unexpected by us . My wife and daughters called upon her two or three times after the Captain 's death , and were even anxious that she should come here to stay for a short time ; but she would not do that . She seemed grateful , and touched by their anxiety about her , but they could not bring her to talk of her future . "
37247	37260	37279	37280	the Rector	600	" And she told them nothing of her intention to leave Lidford ? "
37261	37266	36941	36941	Gilbert	178	" Not a word . "
37681	37709	37710	37711	Sarah Down	235	" The poor dear young lady felt the Captain 's loss dreadfully ; as well she might , when they had been so fond of each other , "
37723	38249	37710	37711	Sarah Down	235	" I never knew any one grieve so deeply . She would n't go anywhere , and she could n't bear to see any one who came to see her . She used to shut herself up in the Captain 's room day after day , kneeling by his bedside , and crying as if her heart would break . I have looked through the keyhole sometimes , and seen her there on her knees , with her face buried in the bedclothes . She did n't care to talk about him even to me , and I had hard work to persuade her to eat or drink enough to keep life in her at this time . When the days were fine , I used to try and get her to walk out a little , for she looked as white as a ghost for want of air ; and after a good deal of persuasion , she did go out sometimes of an afternoon , but she would n't ask any one to walk with her , though there were plenty she might have asked the young ladies from the Rectory and others . She preferred being alone , she told me , and I was glad that she should get the air and the change anyhow . She brightened a little after this , but very little . It was all of a sudden one day that she told me she was going away . I wanted to go with her , but she said that could n't be . I asked her where she was going , and she told me , after hesitating a little , that she was going to friends in London . I knew she had been very fond of two young ladies that she went to school with at Lidford , whose father lived in London ; and I thought it was to their house she was going . I asked her if it was , and she said yes . She made arrangements with the landlord about selling the furniture . He is an auctioneer himself , and there was no difficulty about that . The money was to be sent to her at a post - office in London . I wondered at that , but she said it was better so . She paid every sixpence that was owing , and gave me a handsome present over and above my wages ; though I did n't want to take anything from her , poor dear young lady , knowing that there was very little left after the Captain 's death , except the furniture , which was n't likely to bring much . And so she went away about two days after she first mentioned that she was going to leave Lidford . It was all very sudden , and I do n't think she bade good - bye to any one in the place . She seemed quite broken down with grief in those two last days . I shall never forget her poor pale face when she got into the fly . "
38250	38261	38849	38849	He	1201	" How did she go ? From the station here ? "
38262	38307	37710	37711	Sarah Down	235	" I do n't know anything about that , except that the fly came to the cottage for her and her luggage . I wanted to go to the station with her , to see her off , but she would n't let me . "
38308	38323	38849	38849	He	1201	" Did she mention me during the time that followed Captain Sedgewick 's death ? "
38324	38462	37710	37711	Sarah Down	235	" Only when I spoke about you , sir . I used to try to comfort her , telling her she had you still left to care for her , and to make up for him she 'd lost . But she used to look at me in a strange pitiful sort of way , and shake her head . ' I am very miserable , Sarah , ' she would say to me ; ' I am quite alone in the world now my dear uncle is gone , and I do n't know what to do . ' I told her she ought to look forward to the time when she would be married , and would have a happy home of her own ; but I could never get her to talk of that . "
38463	38487	38849	38849	He	1201	" Can you tell me the name and address of her friends in London the young ladies with whom she went to school ? "
38488	38539	37710	37711	Sarah Down	235	" The name is Bruce , sir ; and they live , or they used to live at that time , in St. John's - wood . I have heard Miss Nowell say that , but I do n't know the name of the street or number of the house . "
38540	38665	38849	38849	He	1201	" I daresay I shall be able to find them . It is a strange business , Sarah . It is most unaccountable that my dearest girl should have left Lidford without writing me word of her removal and her intentions with regard to the future that she should have sent me no announcement of her uncle 's death , although she must have known how well I loved him . I am going to ask you a question that is very painful to me , but which must be asked sooner or later . Do you know of any one else whom she may have liked better than me any one whose influence may have governed her at the time she left Lidford ? "
38666	38673	38675	38676	the woman	5298	" No , indeed , sir , "
38680	38713	38675	38676	the woman	5298	" Who else was there ? Miss Nowell knew so few gentlemen , and saw no one except the Rector 's family and two or three ladies after the uncle 's death . "
38714	38752	38849	38849	He	1201	" Not at the cottage , perhaps . But she may have seen some one out - of - doors . You say she always went out alone at that time , and preferred to do so . "
38753	38780	38675	38676	the woman	5298	" Yes , sir , that is true . But it seemed natural enough that she should like to be alone on account of her grief . "
38781	38848	38849	38849	He	1201	" There must have been some reason for her silence towards me , Sarah . She could not have acted so cruelly without some powerful motive . Heaven only knows what it may have been . The business of my life will be to find her to see her face to face once more , and hear the explanation of her conduct from her own lips . "
38972	38975	38946	38947	The auctioneer	1212	" London . "
39096	39102	39103	39103	he	178	" She never loved me , "
39109	39289	39103	39103	he	178	" I shut my eyes obstinately to the truth , or I might have discovered the secret of her indifference by a hundred signs and tokens . I fancied that a man who loved a woman as I loved her must succeed in winning her heart at last . And I accepted her girlish trust in me , her innocent gratitude for my attentions , as the evidence of her love . Even at the last , when she wanted to release me , I would not understand . I did not expect to be loved as I loved her . I would have given so much , and been content to take so little . What is there I would not have done what sacrifice of my own pride that I would not have happily made to win her ! O my darling , even in your desertion of me you might have trusted me better than this ! You would have found me fond and faithful through every trial , your friend in spite of every wrong . "
39313	39325	39326	39326	he	1218	" I owe it to the dead to discover her fate , "
39339	39371	39326	39326	he	1218	" I owe it to the dead to penetrate the secret of her new life , to assure myself that she is happy , and has fallen under no fatal influence . "
39656	39707	39635	39635	He	178	" Miss MARIAN NOWELL , late of Lidford , Midlandshire , is requested to communicate immediately with G.F. , Post - office , Wigmore - street , to whom her silence has caused extreme anxiety . She may rely upon the advertiser 's friendship and fidelity under all possible circumstances . "
39858	39865	39866	39866	he	178	" You took me by surprise , "
39869	39879	39866	39866	he	178	" I did n't know you were in England . "
39880	39888	39890	39890	Gilbert	178	" I only landed two days ago , "
39897	39943	39890	39890	Gilbert	178	" I daresay I startled you a little , dear old fellow , coming in upon you without a moment 's notice , when you fancied I was at the Antipodes . But , you see , I hunted you up directly I was free . "
39944	39957	39866	39866	he	178	" You have done well out yonder , I hope , Gilbert ? "
39958	39981	39890	39890	Gilbert	178	" Yes ; everything has gone well enough with me in business . But my coming home has been a dreary one . "
39982	39987	39866	39866	he	178	" How is that ? "
39988	40000	39890	39890	Gilbert	178	" Captain Sedgewick is dead , and Marian Nowell is lost . "
40001	40011	39866	39866	he	178	" Lost ! What do you mean by that ? "
40028	40040	40041	40041	he	178	" I come to you for counsel and help , John , "
40051	40083	40085	40086	John Saltram	246	" I will give you my help , so far as it is possible for one man to help another in such a business , and my counsel in all honesty , "
40088	40101	40085	40086	John Saltram	246	" but I doubt if you will be inclined to receive it . "
40102	40109	40085	40086	John Saltram	246	" Why should you doubt that ? "
40110	40123	40085	40086	John Saltram	246	" Because it is not likely to agree with your own ideas . "
40124	40130	40085	40086	John Saltram	246	" Speak out , John . "
40131	40212	40085	40086	John Saltram	246	" I think that if Miss Nowell had really loved you , she would never have taken this step . I think that she must have left Lidford in order to escape from her engagement , perhaps expecting your early return . I believe your pursuit of her can only end in failure and disappointment ; and although I am ready to assist you in any manner you wish , I warn you against sacrificing your life to a delusion . "
40213	40234	40085	40086	John Saltram	246	" It is not under the delusion that Marian Nowell loves me that I am going to search for her , "
40246	40377	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" I am not so weak as to believe that after what has happened , though I have tried to argue with myself , only this afternoon , that she may still be true to me and that there may have been some hidden reason for her conduct . Granted that she wished to escape from her engagement , she might have trusted to my honour to give her a prompt release the moment I became acquainted with the real state of her feelings . There must have been some stronger influence than this at work when she left Lidford . I want to know the true cause of that hurried departure , John . I want to be sure that Marian Nowell is happy , and in safe hands . "
40378	40389	40085	40086	John Saltram	246	" By what means do you hope to discover this ? "
40390	40426	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" I rely a good deal upon repeated advertisements in the Times . They may bring me tidings of Marian if not directly , from some person who has seen her since she left Lidford . "
40427	40446	40085	40086	John Saltram	246	" If she really wished to hide herself from you , she would most likely change her name . "
40447	40528	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" Why should she wish to hide herself from me ? She must know that she might trust me . Of her own free will she would never do this cruel thing . There must have been some secret influence at work upon my darling 's mind . It shall be my business to discover what that influence was ; or , in plainer words still , to discover the man who has robbed me of Marian Nowell 's heart . "
40529	40537	40539	40540	John Saltram	246	" It comes to that , then , "
40542	40549	40539	40540	John Saltram	246	" You suspect some unknown rival ? "
40550	40575	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" Yes ; that is the most natural conclusion to arrive at . And yet heaven knows how unwillingly I take that into consideration . "
40576	40586	40539	40540	John Saltram	246	" There is no particular person whom you suspect ? "
40587	40591	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" No one . "
40592	40608	40539	40540	John Saltram	246	" If there should be no result from your advertisement , what will you do ? "
40609	40683	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" I can not tell you just yet . Unless I get some kind of clue , the business will seem a hopeless one . But I can not imagine that the advertisements will fail completely . If she left Lidford to be married , there must be some record of her marriage . Should my first advertisements fail , my next shall be inserted with a view to discover such a record . "
40684	40715	40539	40540	John Saltram	246	" And if , after infinite trouble , you should find her the wife of another man , what reward would you have for your wasted time and lost labour ? "
40716	40744	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" The happiness of knowing her to be in a safe and honourable position . I love her too dearly to remain in ignorance of her fate . "
40745	40858	40539	40540	John Saltram	246	" Well , Gilbert , I know that good advice is generally thrown away in such a case as this ; but I have a fixed opinion on the subject . To my mind , there is only one wise course open to you , and that is , to let this thing alone , and resign yourself to the inevitable . I acknowledge that Miss Nowell was eminently worthy of your affection ; but you know the old song ' If she be not fair to me , what care I how fair she be . ' There are plenty of women in the world . The choice is wide enough . "
40859	40885	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" Not for me , John . Marian Nowell is the only woman I have ever loved , the only woman I ever can love . "
40886	40913	40539	40540	John Saltram	246	" My dear boy , it is so natural for you to believe that just now ; and a year hence you will think so differently ! "
40914	41019	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" No , John . But I am not going to make any protestations of my constancy . Let the matter rest . I knew that my life is broken that this blow has left me nothing to hope for or to live for , except the hope of finding the girl who has wronged me . I wo n't weary you with lamentations . My talk has been entirely of self since I came into this room . Tell me your own affairs , Jack , old friend . How has the world gone with you since we parted at Liverpool last year ? "
41020	41102	40539	40540	John Saltram	246	" Not too smoothly . My financial position becomes a little more obscure and difficult of comprehension every year , as you know ; but I rub on somehow . I have been working at literature like a galley - slave ; have contributed no end of stuff to the Quarterlies ; and am engaged upon a book , yes Gil , positively a book , which I hope may do great things for me if ever I can finish it . "
41103	41109	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" Is it a novel ? "
41110	41116	41118	41119	John Saltram	246	" A novel ! no ! "
41126	41216	41118	41119	John Saltram	246	" it is the romance of reality I deal with . My book is a Life of Jonathan Swift . He was always a favourite study of mine , you know , that brilliant , unprincipled , intolerant , cynical , irresistible , miserable man . Scott 's biography seems to me to give but a tame picture , and others are only sketches . Mine will be a pre - Raphaelite study faithful as a photograph , careful as a miniature on ivory , and life - size . "
41217	41232	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" I trust it will bring you fame and money when the time comes , "
41236	41250	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" And how about Mrs. Branston ? Is she as charming as ever ? "
41251	41286	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" A little more so , if possible . Poor old Michael Branston is dead went off the hooks rather suddenly about a month ago . The widow looks amazingly pretty in her weeds . "
41287	41307	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" And you will marry her , I suppose , Jack , as soon as her mourning is over ? "
41308	41319	40235	40236	Gilbert Fenton	178	" Well , yes ; it is on the cards , "
41329	41348	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" Why , how you say that ! Is there any doubt as to the lady 's fortune ? "
41349	41406	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" O no ; that is all square enough . Michael Branston 's will was in the Illustrated London News ; the personalty sworn under a hundred and twenty thousand , all left to the widow , besides real property a house in Cavendish Square , the villa at Maidenhead , and a place near Leamington . "
41407	41419	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" It would be a splendid match for you , Jack . "
41420	41485	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" Splendid , of course . An unprecedented stroke of luck for such a fellow as I. Yet I doubt very much if I am quite the man for that sort of life . I should be apt to fancy it a kind of gilded slavery , I think , Gil , and there would be some danger of my kicking off the chains . "
41486	41499	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" But you like Mrs. Branston , do n't you , Jack ? "
41500	41570	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" Like her ? Yes , I like her too well to deceive her . And she would expect devoted affection from a second husband . She is full of romantic ideas , school - girl theories of life which she was obliged to nip in the bud when she went to the altar with old Branston , but which have burst into flower now that she is free . "
41571	41583	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" Have you seen her often since her husband 's death ? "
41584	41607	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" Only twice ; once immediately after the funeral , and again yesterday . She is living in Cavendish Square just now . "
41608	41651	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" I hope you will marry her . I should like to see you safe in smooth water , and with some purpose in life . I should like to see you turn your back upon the loneliness of these dreary chambers . "
41652	41715	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" They are not very brilliant , are they ? I do n't know how many generations of briefless barristers these chairs and tables have served . The rooms have an atmosphere of failure ; but they suit me very well . I am not always here , you know . I spend a good deal of my time in the country . "
41716	41719	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" Whereabouts ? "
41720	41791	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" Sometimes in one direction , sometimes in another ; wherever my truant fancy leads me . I prefer such spots as are most remote from the haunts of men , unknown to cockneys ; and so long as there is a river within reach of my lodging , I can make myself tolerably happy with a punt and a fishing - rod , and contrive to forget my cares . "
41792	41807	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" You have not been to Lidford since I left England , I suppose ? "
41808	41886	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" Yes ; I was at Heatherly a week or two in the winter . Poor old David Forster would not let me alone until I went down to him . He was ill , and in a very dismal condition altogether , abandoned by the rest of his cronies , and a close prisoner in the house which has so many painful associations for him . It was a work of charity to bear him company . "
41887	41903	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" Did you see Captain Sedgewick , or Marian , while you were down there ? "
41904	41934	41234	41234	Gilbert	178	" No . I should have liked to have called upon the kind old Captain ; but Forster was unconscionably exacting , there was no getting away from him . "
42111	42116	42117	42117	he	178	" Dear old John , "
42127	42165	42117	42117	he	178	" I can not tell you what a happiness it has been to me to see you again . We were never separated so long before since the day when I ate my first dinner at Balliol . "
42192	42272	42437	42440	CHAPTER X JACOB NOWELL	173	" My dear Gilbert , it ought to be very pleasant to me to hear that . But I doubt if I am worthy of so much . As far as my own liking for you goes , there is no inequality between us ; but you are a better fellow than I am by a long way , and are not likely to profit much in the long - run by your friendship for a reprobate like me . "
42273	42346	42437	42440	CHAPTER X JACOB NOWELL	173	" That 's all nonsense , John . That kind of vague self - accusation means nothing . I have no doubt I shall live to see you a great man , and to be proud enough of being able to claim you as the chosen friend of my youth . Mr. Branston 's death has cleared the way for you . The chances of a distinguished future are within your grasp . "
42347	42377	42437	42440	CHAPTER X JACOB NOWELL	173	" The chances within my grasp ! Yes . My dear Gilbert , I tell you there are some men for whom everything in this world comes too late . "
42378	42386	42437	42440	CHAPTER X JACOB NOWELL	173	" What do you mean by that ? "
42387	42403	42437	42440	CHAPTER X JACOB NOWELL	173	" Only that I doubt if you will ever see me Adela Branston 's husband . "
42404	42413	42437	42440	CHAPTER X JACOB NOWELL	173	" I ca n't understand you , John . "
42414	42436	42437	42440	CHAPTER X JACOB NOWELL	173	" My dear fellow , there is nothing strange in that . There are times when I can not understand myself . "
42666	42695	42713	42714	the writer	752	" The person advertising for Marian Nowell is requested to call at No . 5 , Queen Anne 's Court , Wardour Street , any evening after seven . "
43109	43132	43133	43138	The sallow - faced young man	1264	" I wish to see Mr. Nowell , the writer of a letter addressed to the post - office in Wigmore Street . "
43505	43549	43493	43495	the old man	1283	" That will do , Tulliver ; you can go back to the shop . If Abrahams brings that little lot again to - night , tell him I 'll give five - and - nine an ounce , not a fraction more . "
43577	43594	43595	43595	he	1283	" Will you be so good as to shut that door , sir , quite securely ? "
43600	43675	43595	43595	he	1283	" That young man is very inquisitive ; I 'm afraid I 've kept him too long . People talk of old servants ; but half the robberies in the world are committed by old servants . Be seated , if you please , sir . You find this room rather close , perhaps . Some people do ; but I 'm old and chilly , and I ca n't live without a fire . "
43676	43688	43690	43690	Gilbert	178	" I have come to you in great anxiety of mind , "
43705	43730	43690	43690	Gilbert	178	" and with some hope that you may be able to set my mind at ease by affording me information about Miss Marian Nowell . "
43731	43741	43595	43595	he	1283	" I can give you no information about her . "
43742	43745	43747	43747	Gilbert	178	" Indeed ! "
43756	43764	43747	43747	Gilbert	178	" and yet you answered my advertisement . "
43765	43784	43595	43595	he	1283	" I did , because I have some reason to suppose this Marian Nowell may be my granddaughter . "
43785	43791	43747	43747	Gilbert	178	" That is quite possible . "
43792	43802	43595	43595	he	1283	" Can you tell me her father 's name ? "
43803	43815	43747	43747	Gilbert	178	" Percival Nowell . Her mother was a Miss Lucy Geoffry . "
43816	43819	43821	43823	the old man	1283	" Right , "
43825	44638	43821	43823	the old man	1283	" Percival Nowell was my only son my only child of late years . There was a girl , but she died early . He was my only son , and his mother and I were foolish enough to be proud of his good looks and his clever ways ; and we brought him up a gentleman , sent him to an expensive school , and after that to the University , and pinched ourselves in every way for his sake . My father was a gentleman ; and it was only after I had failed as a professional man , through circumstances which I need not explain to you now , that I took to this business . I would have made any sacrifice in reason for that boy of mine . I wanted him to be a gentleman , and to make his way in one of the learned professions . After a great deal of chopping and changing , he fixed upon the Bar , took chambers in the Temple , made me pay all the fees , and pretended to study . But I soon found that he was leading a wild dissipated life , and was never likely to be good for anything . He got into debt , drew bills upon me , and behaved altogether in a most shameful manner . When I sent for him , and remonstrated with him upon his disgraceful conduct , he told me that I was a miser , that I spent my life in a dog - kennel for the sake of hoarding money , and that I deserved nothing better than his treatment of me . I may have been better off at this time than I had cared to let him know , for I had soon found out what a reckless scoundrel I had to deal with ; but if he had behaved decently , he would have found me generous and indulgent enough . As it was , I told him to go about his business , and never to expect another sixpence from me as long as he lived . How he managed to exist after this , I hardly know . He was very much mixed up with a disreputable lot of turf - men , and I believe he made money by betting . His mother robbed me for him , I found out afterwards , and contrived to send him a good deal of money at odd times . My business as a dealer in second - hand silver was better then than it is now , and I had had so much money passing through my hands that it was pretty easy for my wife to cheat me . Poor soul ! she has been dead and gone these fifteen years , and I have freely forgiven her . She loved that young man to distraction . If he had wanted a step to reach the object of his wishes , she would have laid herself down in the dust and let him walk over her body . I suppose it is in the nature of mothers to love their sons like that . Well , sir , I never saw my gentleman after that day . I had plenty of letters from him , all asking for money ; threatening letters , pitiful letters , letters in which he swore he would destroy himself if he did n't receive a remittance by return of post ; but I never sent him a shilling . About a year after our last meeting , I received the announcement of his marriage with Miss Geoffry . He wrote to tell me that , if I would allow him a decent income , he would reform and lead a steady life . That letter I did answer : to the effect that , if he chose to come here and act as my shopman , I would give him board and lodging for himself and his wife , and such wages as he should deserve . I told him that I had given him his chance as a gentleman , and he had thrown it away . I would give him the opportunity now of succeeding in a humbler career by sheer industry and perseverance as I had succeeded myself . If he thought that I had made a fortune , there was so much the more reason for him to try his luck . This was the last letter I ever wrote to him . It was unanswered ; but about a year and a half afterwards there came a few lines to his mother , telling her of the birth of a daughter , which was to be called Marian , after her . This last letter came from Brussels . "
44639	44652	44653	44653	Gilbert	178	" And did you hear no more of your son after this ? "
44656	44787	43821	43823	the old man	1283	" Nothing . I think his mother used to get letters from him in secret for some time ; that these failed suddenly at last ; and that anxiety about her worthless son anxiety which she tried to hide from me shortened her life . She never complained , poor soul ! never mentioned Percy 's name until the last , when she begged me to be kind to him if he should ever come to throw himself upon my kindness . I gave her my promise that , if that came to pass , he should find me a better friend to him than he deserved . It is hard to refuse the last prayer of a faithful wife who has done her duty patiently for nearly thirty years . "
44788	44800	43821	43823	the old man	1283	" Have you any reason to suppose your son still living ? "
44801	45004	43821	43823	the old man	1283	" I have no evidence of his death . Often and often , after my poor wife was gone , I have sat alone here of a night thinking of him ; thinking that he might come in upon me at any moment ; almost listening for his footstep in the quiet of the place . But he never came . He would have found me very soft - hearted at such times . My mind changed to him a good deal after his mother 's death . I used to think of him as he was in his boyhood , when Marian and I had such great hopes of him , and would sit and talk of him for hours together by this fireside . An old man left quite alone as I was had plenty of time for such thoughts . Night after night I have fancied I heard his step , and have looked up at that door expecting to see him open it and come in ; but he never came . He may be dead . I suppose he is dead ; or he would have come to make another attempt at getting money out of me . "
45005	45016	45018	45018	Gilbert	178	" You have never taken any measures for finding him ? "
45020	45194	43821	43823	the old man	1283	" No . If he wanted me , he knew where I was to be found . I was a fixture . It was his business to come to me . When I saw the name of Marian Nowell in your advertisement a week ago , I felt curious to know whether it could be my grandchild you were looking for . I held off till this morning , thinking it was n't worth my while to make any inquiries about the matter ; but I could n't get it out of my head somehow ; and it ended by my answering your advertisement . I am an old man , you see , without a creature belonging to me ; and it might be a comfort to me to meet with some one of my own flesh and blood . The bit of money I may leave behind me when I die wo n't be much ; but it might as well go to my son 's child as to a stranger . "
45195	45242	45279	45281	The old man	1283	" If your son 's child can be found , you will discover her to be well worthy of your love . Yes , though she has done me a cruel wrong , I believe her to be all that is good and pure and true . "
45243	45254	43821	43823	the old man	1283	" What is the wrong that she has done you ? "
45327	45342	45343	45343	he	178	" You do not know what a worthless thing money is to me now , "
45346	45361	45343	45343	he	178	" or now lightly I hold my own trouble or loss in this matter . "
45702	45705	45678	45678	man	526	" Ebenezer ; "
45997	46008	46010	46011	Mr. Stoneham	248	" The world might get on pretty well without bishops , "
46026	46041	46014	46014	he	248	" but what would become of a parish in which there was no clerk ? "
46096	46104	46106	46106	Gilbert	178	" I believe you are Mr. Stoneham , "
46108	46124	46106	46106	Gilbert	178	" and the writer of a letter in answer to an advertisement in the Times . "
46125	46175	46179	46179	his	248	" My name is Stoneham , sir ; I am the clerk of this parish , and have been for twenty years and more , as I think I may have stated in the letter to which you refer . Will you be so kind as to step inside ? "
46313	46326	46327	46327	Gilbert	178	" I want to know all about this marriage , Mr. Stoneham , "
46349	46369	46331	46331	he	178	" First and foremost , I want you to tell me where Mr. and Mrs. Holbrook are now living . "
46382	46390	46391	46391	he	1316	" Not to be done , sir , "
46394	46485	46391	46391	he	1316	" when Mr. and Mrs. Holbrook left here they went the Lord knows where . They went away the very day they were married . There was a fly waiting for them at the church - door , with their luggage upon it , when the ceremony was over , ready to drive them to Grangewick station . I saw them get into it and drive away ; and that 's every mortal thing that I know as to what became of them after they were married in yonder church . "
46486	46497	46370	46373	The parish - clerk	1316	" You do n't know who this Mr. Holbrook is ? "
46498	46670	46391	46391	he	1316	" No more than the babe unborn , sir . He was a stranger in this place , was only here long enough to get the license for his marriage . I should take him to be a gentleman ; but he was n't a pleasant person to speak to rather stand - off - ish in his manners . He was n't the sort of man I should have chosen if I 'd been a pretty young woman like Miss Nowell ; but there 's no accounting for taste , and she seemed uncommonly fond of him . I never saw any one more agitated than she was when they were married . She was crying in a quiet way all through the service , and when it was over she fainted dead - off . I daresay it did seem hard to her to be married like that , without so much as a friend to give her away . She was in mourning , too , deep mourning . "
46671	46685	46370	46373	The parish - clerk	1316	" Can you give me any description of this man this Mr. Holbrook ? "
46686	46750	46391	46391	he	1316	" Well , no , sir : he was an ordinary kind of person to look at ; might be any age between thirty and forty ; not a gentleman that I should have taken a fancy to myself , as I said before ; but young women are that wayward and uncertain like , there 's no knowing where to have them . "
46751	46762	46370	46373	The parish - clerk	1316	" Was Miss Nowell long at Wygrove before her marriage ? "
46763	46807	46391	46391	he	1316	" About three weeks . She lodged with Miss Long , up the town , a friend of my daughter 's . If you 'd like to ask any questions of Miss Long , our Jemima might step round there with you presently . "
46808	46818	46819	46819	Gilbert	178	" I should be very glad to do so , "
46971	47027	46960	46960	himself	178	" to Miss Long 's domicile with him , in the hope of obtaining fuller information from that lady . While Miss Stoneham was engaged in putting on her bonnet for this expedition , the clerk proposed to take Gilbert across to the church and show him the entry of the marriage in the register . "
47039	47069	46960	46960	himself	178	" Mr. Stoneham added in a fat voice , and with the air of a man to whom twenty pounds more or less was an affair of very little moment .
47644	47655	47656	47656	she	1163	" A sweeter young lady never lived than Miss Nowell , "
47659	47729	47656	47656	she	1163	" I 've had a great many people occupying these apartments since my father 's death left me thrown upon my own resources . I 've had lodgers that I might call permanent , in a manner of speaking ; but I never had any one that I took to as I took to Miss Nowell , though she was hardly with me three weeks from first to last . "
47730	47742	47743	47743	Gilbert	178	" Did she seem happy in her mind during that time ? "
47746	48027	47656	47656	she	1163	" Well , no ; I can not say that she did . I should have expected to see a young lady that was going to be married to the man she loved much more cheerful and hopeful about the future than Miss Nowell was . She told me that her uncle had not been dead many weeks , and I thought at first that this was the only grief she had on her mind ; but after some time , when I found her very low and downhearted , and had won upon her to trust me almost as if I had been an old friend , she owned to me that she had behaved very badly to a gentleman she had been engaged to , and that the thought of her wickedness to him preyed upon her mind . ' I do n't think any good can ever come of my marriage , Miss Long , ' she said to me ; ' I think I must surely be punished for my falsehood to the good man who loved me so truly . But there are some things in life that seem like fate . They come upon us in a moment , and we have no strength to fight against them . I believe it was my fate to love John Holbrook . There is nothing in this world I could refuse to do for his sake . If he had asked me for my life , I must have given it to him as freely as I gave him my love . From the first hour in which I saw him he was my master . ' "
48028	48041	47656	47656	she	1163	" This Mr. Holbrook was very fond of her , I suppose ? "
48042	48151	47656	47656	she	1163	" I daresay he was , sir ; but he was not a man that showed his feelings very much . They used to go for long walks together , though it was March and cold windy weather , and she always seemed happier when he brought her home . He came every evening to drink tea with her , and I used to hear them talking as I sat at work in the next room . She was happy enough when he was with her . It was only when she was alone that she would give way to low spirits and gloomy thoughts about the future . "
48152	48182	47656	47656	she	1163	" Did she ever tell you anything about Mr. Holbrook his position or profession ? how long she had known him ? how and where they had first met ? "
48183	48226	47656	47656	she	1163	" No , sir . She told me once that he was not rich ; I think that is about all she ever said of him , except when she spoke of his influence over her , and her trust in him . "
48227	48242	47656	47656	she	1163	" Have you any idea where they were going to live after their marriage ? "
48243	48351	47656	47656	she	1163	" I can not tell you the name of the place . Miss Nowell said that a friend of Mr. Holbrook 's was going to lend him an old farm - house in a very pretty part of the country . It would be very lonely , she said , and her husband would have sometimes to leave her to attend to his business in London ; but she would not mind that . ' Some day , I daresay , he will let me live in London with him , ' she said ; ' but I do n't like to ask him that yet . ' "
48352	48371	47656	47656	she	1163	" Did she drop no hint as to the whereabouts of this place to which they were going ? "
48372	48386	47656	47656	she	1163	" It was somewhere in Hampshire ; that is all I can remember . "
48387	48398	48399	48399	Gilbert	178	" I would give a great deal to know more , "
48405	48443	48399	48399	Gilbert	178	" In what manner did this Mr. Holbrook impress you ? You were interested in the young lady , and would therefore naturally be interested in her lover . Did he strike you as worthy of her ? "
48444	48455	48456	48457	Miss Long	253	" I can not say that he did , sir , "
48461	48564	48456	48457	Miss Long	253	" I could see that he had great power over her , though his manner to her was always very gentle ; but I can not say that I took to him myself . I daresay he is a very clever man ; but he had a cold proud way that kept one at a distance from him , and I seemed to know no more of him at the last than I had known on the first day I saw him . I believe he loved Miss Nowell , and that 's about all the good I do believe of him . "
49166	49181	49182	49182	he	905	" My dear Mr. Fenton , how good of you to come to me ! "
49192	49231	49182	49182	he	905	" Here I am , laid by the heels in this dreary old place , and quite alone . You ca n't imagine what a treat it is to see a friendly intelligent face from the outer world . "
49232	49339	49340	49342	Sir David Forster	209	" The purpose of my visit is such a purely selfish one , that I am really ashamed to receive such a kindly greeting , Sir David . If I had known you were here and an invalid , I should have gladly come to see you ; but I did n't know it . I have been at Lidford on a matter of business for the last two days ; and I came here on the hazard of finding you , and with a faint hope that you might be able to give me some help in an affair which is supremely important to me . "
49418	49424	49425	49426	Sir David	209	" What is the business ? "
49430	49441	49425	49426	Sir David	209	" and how can I be of use to you ? "
49442	49465	49466	49466	Gilbert	178	" I think you knew all about my engagement to Miss Nowell , when I was here last September , Sir David , "
49470	49498	49425	49426	Sir David	209	" Yes , Saltram told me you were engaged ; not but what it was easy enough to see how the land lay , without any telling . "
49499	49603	49425	49426	Sir David	209	" Miss Nowell has jilted me . I love her too dearly to be able to entertain any vindictive feeling against her ; but I do feel vindictively disposed towards the man who has robbed me of her , for I know that only a very powerful influence would have induced her to break faith with me ; and this man must needs have known the dishonourable thing he was doing when he tempted her away from me . I want to know who he is , Sir David , and how he came to acquire such an influence over my plighted wife . "
49604	49637	49425	49426	Sir David	209	" My dear Fenton , you are going on so fast ! You say Miss Nowell has jilted you . She is married to some one else , then , I suppose ? "
49638	49711	49425	49426	Sir David	209	" She is married to a Mr. Holbrook . I came to Lidford the night before last , with the hope of finding out something about him ; but all my endeavours have resulted in failure . It struck me at last , as a kind of forlorn hope , that this Mr. Holbrook might possibly be one of your autumnal visitors ; and I came here to ask you that question . "
49712	49715	49717	49718	the baronet	1108	" No , "
49720	49737	49717	49718	the baronet	1108	" I have had no visitor called Holbrook . Is the name quite strange to yourself ? "
49738	49742	49425	49426	Sir David	209	" Entirely strange . "
49743	49768	49717	49718	the baronet	1108	" And this Mr. Holbrook is now Miss Nowell 's husband ? and you want to know who he is ? With what end ? "
49769	49789	49425	49426	Sir David	209	" I want to find the man who has done me the deadliest wrong one man can do another . "
49790	49954	49717	49718	the baronet	1108	" My dear fellow , do n't you see that it is fate , and not Mr. Holbrook , that has done you this wrong ? If Miss Nowell had really loved you as she ought to have loved you , it would have been quite impossible for her to be tempted away from you . It was her destiny to marry this Holbrook , rely upon it ; and had you been on the spot to protect your own interests , the result would have been just the same . Believe me , I am very sorry for you , and can fully sympathise with your feelings in this business ; but I can not see what good could possibly arise out of a meeting between you and your fortunate rival . The days of duelling are past ; and even if it were not so , I think you are too generous to seek to deprive Miss Nowell of her husband . "
49955	50029	49425	49426	Sir David	209	" I do not know about that . There are some wrongs which all a man 's Christianity is not wide enough to cover . I think if that man and I were to meet , there would be very little question of mercy on my side . I hold a man who could act as he has acted unworthy of all consideration utterly unworthy of the woman he has won from me . "
50030	50113	49717	49718	the baronet	1108	" My dear fellow , you know the old saying . A man who is in love thinks everything fair . There is no such thing as honour in such a case as this . Of course , I do n't want to defend this Holbrook ; I only want to awaken your senses to the absurdity of any vindictive pursuit of the man . If the lady did not love you , believe me you are well out of the business . "
50114	50129	50130	50130	Gilbert	178	" Yes , that is what every one would tell me , I daresay , "
50134	50202	50130	50130	Gilbert	178	" But is there to be no atonement for my broken life , rendered barren to me by this man 's act ? I tell you , Sir David , there is no such thing as pardon for a wrong like this . But I know how foolish this talk must seem to you : there is always something ridiculous in the sufferings of a jilted lover . "
50203	50268	50130	50130	Gilbert	178	" Not at all , my dear Fenton . I heartily wish that I could be of use to you in this matter ; but there is very little chance of that ; and , believe me , there is only one rational course open to you , which is , to forget Miss Nowell , or Mrs. Holbrook , with all possible assiduity . "
50476	50490	50491	50491	he	1283	" I would give a great deal to see her before I die , "
50494	50564	50491	50491	he	1283	" Whatever I have to leave will be hers . It may be little or much I wo n't speak about that ; but I 've lived a hard life , and saved where other men would have spent . I should like to see my son 's child ; I should like to have some one of my own flesh and blood about me in my last days . "
50565	50611	50465	50465	himself	1283	" Would it not be a good plan to put an advertisement into the Times , addressed to Mrs. Holbrook , from a relation ? She would be likely to answer that , when she would not reply to any appeal coming directly from me . "
50612	50615	50617	50618	Jacob Nowell	173	" Yes , "
50620	50701	50617	50618	Jacob Nowell	173	" and her husband would let her come to me for the sake of what I may have to leave her . But that ca n't be helped , I suppose ; it is the fate of a man who lives as I have lived , to be cared for at last only for what he has to give . I 'll put in such an advertisement as you speak of ; and we 'll see what comes of it . "
50743	50748	50741	50741	he	246	" out of town , "
51307	51330	51331	51331	Gilbert	178	" Does that young man expect you to leave him money ? and does he look upon me as a possible rival ? "
51343	51347	51348	51349	Mr. Nowell	201	" Very likely , "
51357	51392	51348	51349	Mr. Nowell	201	" One gets good service from a man who expects his reward in the future . Luke Tulliver serves me very well indeed , and of course I am not responsible for his delusions . "
51393	51425	51348	51349	Mr. Nowell	201	" Do you know , Mr. Nowell , that is a man I should scarcely care to trust . To my mind there is a warning of danger in his countenance . "
51426	51441	51443	51444	the silversmith	1289	" My dear sir , I have never trusted any one in my life , "
51447	51534	51443	51444	the silversmith	1289	" I do n't for a moment suppose that Luke Tulliver would be honest if I gave him an opportunity to cheat me . As to the badness of his countenance , that is so much the better . I like to deal with an obvious rogue . The really dangerous subject is your honest fool , who goes on straight enough till he has lulled one into a false security , and then turns thief all at once at the instigation of some clever tempter . "
51535	51549	51348	51349	Mr. Nowell	201	" That young man lives in the house with you , I suppose ? "
51550	51664	51443	51444	the silversmith	1289	" Yes ; my household consists of Luke Tulliver , and an old woman who does the cooking and other work . There are a couple of garrets at the top of the house where the two sleep ; my own bedroom is over this ; and the room over the shop is full of pictures and other unsaleable stuff , which I have seldom occasion to show anybody . My business is not what it once was , Mr. Fenton . I have made some rather lucky hits in the way of picture - dealing in the course of my business career , but I have n't done a big line lately . "
51789	51820	51761	51761	He	246	" My dear Jack , I began to think I should never see you again . What have you been doing all this time , and where have you been ? "
51821	51880	51773	51773	his	246	" I have been hard at work , as usual , for the reviews , down Oxford way , at a little place on the river . And how has the world been going with you , Gilbert ? I saw your advertisement offering a reward for evidence of Miss Nowell 's marriage . Was there any result ? "
51881	51904	51905	51905	Gilbert	178	" Yes ; I know all about the marriage now , but I do n't know who or what the man is , "
51933	51939	51941	51942	John Saltram	246	" My dear foolish Gilbert , "
51944	52017	51941	51942	John Saltram	246	" how much useless trouble you have given yourself ! Was it not enough to know that this girl had broken faith with you ? I think , were I in your place , that would be the end of the story for me . And now you know more than that you know that she is another man 's wife . If you find her , nothing can come of it . "
52018	52045	51905	51905	Gilbert	178	" It is the man I want to find , John ; the man whom I shall make it the business of my life to discover . "
52046	52051	51941	51942	John Saltram	246	" For what good ? "
52052	52060	52061	52061	Gilbert	178	" For the deadliest harm to him , "
52065	52103	52061	52061	Gilbert	178	" If ever he and I meet , I will have some payment for my broken life ; some compensation for my ruined hopes . We two should not meet and part lightly , rely upon it . "
52104	52159	51941	51942	John Saltram	246	" You can make no excuse for his love , that fatal irresistible passion , which outweighs truth and honour when they are set in the opposite scale . I did not think you could be so hard , Gilbert ; I thought you would have more mercy on the man who wronged you . "
52160	52175	52061	52061	Gilbert	178	" I could pardon any injury but this . I will never forgive this . "
52186	52196	52197	52197	he	246	" It is a mistake , my dear fellow , "
52200	52285	52197	52197	he	246	" Life is not long enough for these strong passions . There is nothing in the world worth the price these bitter hatreds and stormy angers cost us . You have thrown away a great deal of deep feeling on a lady , whose misfortune it was not to be able to return your affection as she might have done as you most fully deserved at her hands . Why waste any further emotion in regrets that are as useless as they are foolish ? "
52286	52297	52298	52298	Gilbert	178	" You may as well ask me why I exist , "
52302	52316	52298	52298	Gilbert	178	" Regret for all I have lost is a part of my life . "
52390	52407	52408	52409	John Saltram	246	" I have seen nothing and heard very little of her while I have been away , "
52421	52476	52408	52409	John Saltram	246	" but I called in Cavendish - square this afternoon , and was fortunate enough to find her at home . She wants me to dine with her next Sunday , and I half promised to do so . Will you come too ? I know that she would be glad to see you . "
52477	52489	52707	52708	John Saltram	246	" I can not see that I am wanted , John . "
52490	52527	52408	52409	John Saltram	246	" But I tell you that you are wanted . I wish you to go with me . Mrs. Branston likes you amazingly , if you care to know the opinion of so frivolous a person . "
52528	52581	52707	52708	John Saltram	246	" I am very much flattered by Mrs. Branston 's kindly estimate of me , but I do not think I have any claim to it , except the fact that I am your friend . I shall be happy to go with you on Sunday , if you really wish it . "
52582	52660	52408	52409	John Saltram	246	" I do really wish it . I shall drop Mrs. Branston a line to say you will come . She asked me to bring you whenever I had an opportunity . The dinner - hour is seven . I 'll call for you here a few minutes before . I do n't promise you a very lively evening , remember . There will only be Adela , and a lady she has taken as her companion . "
52661	52692	52707	52708	John Saltram	246	" I do n't care about lively evenings . I have been nowhere in society since I returned from Melbourne . I have done with all that kind of thing . "
52693	52706	52707	52708	John Saltram	246	" My dear Gilbert , that sort of renunciation will never do , "
52712	52750	52707	52708	John Saltram	246	" A man can not turn his back upon society at your age . Life lies all before you , and it rests with yourself to create a happy future . Let the dead bury their dead . "
52751	52926	52707	52708	John Saltram	246	" Yes , John ; and what is left for the living when that burial is over ? I do n't want to make myself obnoxious by whining over my troubles , but they are not to be lessened by philosophy , and I can do nothing but bear them as best I may . I had long been growing tired of society , in the conventional acceptation of the word , and all the stereotyped pleasures of a commercial man 's life . Those things are less than nothing when a man has nothing brighter and fairer beyond them no inner life by which the common things of this world are made precious . It is only dropping out of the arena a little earlier than I might have done otherwise . I have a notion that I shall wind up my affairs next year , sell my business , and go abroad . I could manage to retire upon a very decent income , in spite of my losses the other day . "
52927	53029	52707	52708	John Saltram	246	" Do n't dream of that , Gilbert ; for heaven 's sake , do n't dream of anything so mad as that . What would a man of your age be without some kind of career ? A mere purposeless wanderer on the face of the earth . Stick to business , dear old fellow . Believe me , there is nothing like work to make a man forget any foolish trouble of this kind . And you will forget it , Gilbert , be assured of that . If I were not certain it would be so , I should "
53044	53052	53030	53030	He	1463	" You would do what , John ? "
53053	53139	52707	52708	John Saltram	246	" Hate this man Holbrook almost as savagely as you hate him , for having come between you and your happiness . Yet , if Marian Nowell did not love you as a wife should love her husband , with all her heart and soul it was ten thousand times better that the knot should be cut in time , however roughly . Think what your misery would have been if you had discovered after your marriage that her heart had never been really yours . "
53140	53203	53216	53217	John Saltram	246	" I can not imagine that possible . I have no shadow of doubt that I should have succeeded in winning her heart if this man had not robbed me of her . My absence gave him his opportunity . Had I been at hand to protect my own interests , I do not think his influence could have prevailed against me . "
53204	53215	53216	53217	John Saltram	246	" It is quite natural that you should think that , "
53221	53252	53216	53217	John Saltram	246	" Yet you may be mistaken . A woman 's love is such a capricious thing , and so often bestowed upon the least deserving amongst those who seek it . "
53296	53310	53311	53311	he	1468	" Then you fancy there is a good bit of money in question ? "
53320	53395	53291	53292	Mr. Saltram	1468	" I fancy so . But I have no actual ground for the belief . The place in which the old man lives is poor enough , and he has carefully abstained from any hint as to what he might leave his granddaughter . Whatever it is , Marian ought to have it ; and there is very little chance of that , unless she comes forward in response to Mr. Nowell 's advertisements . "
53396	53412	53414	53415	Mr. Saltram	1469	" It is a pity she should lose the chance of this inheritance , certainly , "
53458	53463	53464	53464	he	246	" Poor old Gilbert , "
53469	53570	53464	53464	he	246	" this business has touched him more deeply than I could have thought possible . I wish things had happened otherwise . What is it Lady Macbeth says ? ' Naught 's had , all 's spent , when our desire is got without content . ' I wonder whether the fulfilment of one 's heart 's desire ever does bring perfect contentment ? I think not . There is always something wanting . And if a man comes by his wish basely , there is a taint of poison in the wine of life that neutralizes all its sweetness . "
54419	54438	54439	54439	she	212	" Adela tells me that you and Mr. Saltram are friends of very long standing , Mr. Fenton , "
54469	54486	54451	54451	she	212	" Yes ; we were at Oxford together , and have been fast friends ever since . "
54487	54555	54451	54451	she	212	" Indeed ! how really delightful ! The young men of the present day appear to me generally so incapable of a sincere friendship . And you and Mr. Saltram have been friends all that time ? He is a literary man , I understand . I have not had the pleasure of reading any of his works ; but Adela tells me he is extremely clever . "
54556	54562	54451	54451	she	212	" He is very clever . "
54563	54598	54451	54451	she	212	" And steady , I hope . Literary men are so apt to be wild and dissipated ; and Adela has such a high opinion of your friend . I hope he is steady . "
54599	54613	54614	54614	Gilbert	178	" I scarcely know what a lady 's notion of steadiness may involve , "
54619	54675	54614	54614	Gilbert	178	" but I daresay when my friend marries he will be steady enough . I can not see that literary tastes and dissipated habits have any natural affinity . I should rather imagine that a man with resources of that kind would be likely to lead a quieter life than a man without such resources . "
54676	54730	54451	54451	she	212	" Do you really think so ? I fancied that artists and poets and people of that kind were altogether a dangerous class . And you think that Mr. Saltram will be steady when he is married ? He is engaged to be married , I conclude by your manner of saying that . "
54731	54755	54614	54614	Gilbert	178	" I had no idea my words implied anything of the kind . No , I do not think John Saltram is engaged . "
54954	54961	54962	54962	she	171	" My son Theobald Mr. Fenton , "
54965	54998	54962	54962	she	171	" My son is a medical practitioner , residing at Maida - hill ; and it is a pleasure to him to spend an occasional evening with his cousin Adela and myself . "
54999	55014	55015	55016	Mr. Pallinson	258	" Whenever the exigencies of professional life leave me free to enjoy that happiness , "
55026	55050	55015	55016	Mr. Pallinson	258	" Adela has been giving you some music , I see . I heard one of Handel 's choruses as I came upstairs . "
55107	55126	55127	55128	Mrs. Pallinson	171	" I am blessed , as I daresay you perceive , Mr. Fenton , in my only son , "
55142	55204	55127	55128	Mrs. Pallinson	171	" It was my misfortune to lose an admirable husband very early in life ; and I have been ever since that loss wholly devoted to my son Theobald . My care has been amply rewarded by his goodness . He is a most estimable and talented young man , and has already attained an excellent position in the medical profession . "
55205	55215	55216	55216	Gilbert	178	" You have reason to be proud of him , "
55220	55278	55127	55128	Mrs. Pallinson	171	" I am proud of him , Mr. Fenton . He is the sole delight and chief object of my life . His career up to this hour has been all that the fondest mother could desire . If I can only see him happily and advantageously married , I shall have nothing left to wish for . "
55279	55282	55284	55284	Gilbert	178	" Indeed ! "
55286	55343	55284	55284	Gilbert	178	" Then I begin to perceive the reason of Mrs. Pallinson 's anxiety about John Saltram . She wants to secure Mrs. Branston 's handsome fortune for this son of hers . Not much chance of that , I think , fascinating as the doctor may be . Plain John Saltram stands to win that prize . "
55360	55364	55127	55128	Mrs. Pallinson	171	" Hallelujah Chorus , "
56033	56046	56047	56047	she	214	" I suppose you will be running away from town again directly , "
56050	56129	56047	56047	she	214	" without giving any one the faintest notice of your intention . I ca n't think what charm it is that you find in country life . I have so often heard you profess your indifference to shooting , and the ordinary routine of rustic existence . Perhaps the secret is , that you fear your reputation as a man of fashion would suffer were you to be seen in London at such a barbarous season as this . "
56130	56141	56142	56143	Mr. Saltram	1551	" I have never rejoiced in a reputation for fashion , "
56161	56217	56147	56147	his	1551	" and I think I like London in the autumn better than at any other time . One has room to move about . I have been in the country of late because I really do appreciate rural surroundings , and have found myself able to write better in the perfect quiet of rural life . "
56218	56236	56264	56264	Adela	212	" It is rather hard upon your friends that you should devote all your days to literature . "
56237	56263	56147	56147	his	1551	" And still harder upon the reading public , perhaps . But , my dear Mrs. Branston , remember , I must write to live . "
56912	56923	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" I thought she was really charming to - night , "
56927	56975	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" in spite of that fellow 's efforts to absorb her attention . It is pretty easy to see how the land lies in that direction ; and if such a rival were likely to injure you , you have a very determined one in Mr. Pallinson . "
56976	57003	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" Yes ; the surgeon has evidently fixed his hopes upon poor old Michael Branston 's money . But I do n't think he will succeed . "
57004	57017	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" You will not allow him to do so , I hope ? "
57018	57036	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" I do n't know about that . Then you really admire the little woman , Gilbert ? "
57037	57054	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" Very much ; as much as I have ever admired any woman except Marian Nowell . "
57055	57107	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" Ah , your Marian is a star , single and alone in her brightness , like that planet up yonder ! But Adela Branston is a good little soul , and will make a charming wife . Gilbert , I wish to heaven you would fall in love with her ! "
57128	57143	57117	57117	he	178	" Why , John , you must be mad to say such a thing . "
57144	57299	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" No , it is by no means a mad notion . I want to see you cured , Gilbert . I do like you , dear boy , you know , as much as it is possible for a selfish worthless fellow like me to like any man . I would give a great deal to see you happy ; and I am sure that you might be so as Adela Branston 's husband . I grant you that I am the favourite at present ; but she is just the sort of woman to be won by any man who would really prove himself worthy of her . Her liking for me is a mere idle fancy , which would soon die out for want of fuel . You are my superior in every way younger , handsomer , better . Why should you not go in for this thing , Gil ? "
57300	57377	57485	57485	Gilbert	178	" Because I have no heart to give any woman , John . And even if I were free , I would not give my heart to a woman whose affection had to be diverted from another channel before it could be bestowed upon me . I ca n't imagine what has put such a preposterous idea into your head , or why it is that you shrink from improving your own chances with Mrs. Branston . "
57378	57411	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" You must not wonder at anything that I do or say , Gilbert . It is my nature to do strange things my destiny to take the wrong turning in life ! "
57412	57420	57421	57421	Gilbert	178	" When shall I see you again ? "
57433	57451	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" I can scarcely tell you that . I must go back to Oxford to - morrow . "
57452	57456	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" So soon ? "
57457	57479	56924	56924	Gilbert	178	" Yes , my work gets on better down there . I will let you know directly I return to London . "
57902	57922	57923	57923	he	5127	" The place looks just as dull and dingy as it used to look when I was a lad , "
57928	58031	57923	57923	he	5127	" I daresay I shall find the old court unchanged in all these years . But shall I find the old man alive ? I doubt that . Dead more likely , and his money gone to strangers . I wonder whether he had much money , or whether he was really as poor as he made himself out . It 's difficult to say . I know I made him bleed pretty freely , at one time and another , before he turned rusty ; and it 's just possible I may have had pretty nearly all he had to give . "
58096	58107	58108	58108	he	5127	" The court is still here , at any rate , "
58113	58123	58108	58108	he	5127	" and I shall soon settle the other question . "
58550	58564	58565	58565	he	243	" Did you wish to look at anything in antique silver , sir ? "
58569	58582	58565	58565	he	243	" We have some very handsome specimens of the Queen Anne period . "
58583	58606	58661	58662	Luke Tulliver	243	" No , I do n't want to look at anything . I want to know whether Jacob Nowell is still living ? "
58607	58641	58565	58565	he	243	" Yes , sir . Mr. Nowell is my master . You might have noticed his name upon the door - plate if you had looked ! Do you wish to see him ? "
58642	58660	58661	58662	Luke Tulliver	243	" I do . Tell him that I am an old friend , just come from America . "
58690	58713	58683	58685	the old man	1283	" I have no friend in America ; but you may tell the person to come in ; I will see him . "
58782	58789	58790	58790	he	173	" You can go , Tulliver , "
58797	58807	58790	58790	he	173	" I wish to be alone with this gentleman . "
58876	58883	58884	58884	he	1283	" Yes , yes , yes , "
58888	58919	58884	58884	he	1283	" at last ! It is you , Percival , my only son . I thought you were dead long ago . I had a right to consider you dead . "
58920	58963	58854	58856	the old man	1283	" If I had thought my existence could be a matter of interest to you , I should hardly have so long refrained from all communication with you . But your letters led me to suppose you utterly indifferent to my fate . "
58964	58974	58884	58884	he	1283	" I offered you and your wife a home . "
58975	59029	58854	58856	the old man	1283	" Yes , but on conditions that were impossible to me . I had some pride in those days . My education had not fitted me to stand behind a counter and drive hard bargains with dealers of doubtful honesty . Nor could I bring my wife to such a home as this . "
59030	59044	59046	59048	the old man	1283	" The time came when you left that poor creature without any home , "
59051	59099	58854	58856	the old man	1283	" Necessity has no law , my dear father . You may imagine that my life , without a profession and without any reliable resources , has been rather precarious . When I seemed to have acted worst , I have been only the slave of circumstances . "
59100	59125	58854	58856	the old man	1283	" Indeed ! and have you no pity for the fate of your wife , no interest in the life of your only child ? "
59126	59143	58854	58856	the old man	1283	" My wife was a poor helpless creature , who contrived to make my life wretched , "
59153	59339	59144	59145	Mr. Nowell	201	" I gave her every sixpence I possessed when I sent her home to England ; but luck went dead against me for a long time after that , and I could neither send her money nor go to her . When I heard of her death , I heard in an indirect way that my child had been adopted by some old fool of a half - pay officer ; and I was naturally glad of an accident which relieved me of a heavy incubus . An opportunity occurred about the same time of my entering on a tolerably remunerative career as agent for some Belgian ironworks in America ; and I had no option but to close with the offer at once or lose the chance altogether . I sailed for New York within a fortnight after poor Lucy 's death , and have lived in America for the last fifteen years . I have contrived to establish a tolerably flourishing trade there on my own account ; a trade that only needs capital to become one of the first in New York . "
59340	59343	59345	59346	Jacob Nowell	173	" Capital ! "
59348	59379	59345	59346	Jacob Nowell	173	" I thought there was something wanted . It would have been a foolish fancy to suppose that affection could have had anything to do with your coming to me . "
59380	59445	58854	58856	the old man	1283	" My dear father , it is surely possible that affection and interest may sometimes go together . Were I a pauper , I would not venture to present myself before you at all ; but as a tolerably prosperous trader , with the ability to propose an alliance that should be to our mutual advantage , I considered I might fairly approach you . "
59446	59457	59458	59460	the old man	1283	" I have no money to invest in your trade , "
59464	59505	59458	59460	the old man	1283	" I am a very poor man , impoverished for life by the wicked extravagance of your youth . If you have come to me with any hope of obtaining money from me , you have wasted time and trouble . "
59506	59514	59515	59516	Percival Nowell	201	" Let that subject drop , then , "
59520	59550	59515	59516	Percival Nowell	201	" I suppose you have some remnant of regard for me , in spite of our old misunderstanding , and that my coming is not quite indifferent to you . "
59551	59554	59555	59556	the other	595	" No , "
59565	59678	59555	59556	the other	595	" it is not indifferent to me . I have waited for your return these many years . You might have found me more tenderly disposed towards you , had you come earlier ; but there are some feelings which seem to wear out as a man grows older , affections that grow paler day by day , like colours fading in the sun . Still , I am glad to see you once more before I die . You are my only son , and you must needs be something nearer to me than the rest of the world , in spite of all that I have suffered at your hands . "
59679	59691	59692	59694	the young man	666	" I could not come back to England sooner than this , "
59698	59709	59692	59694	the young man	666	" I had a hard battle to fight out yonder . "
59761	59776	59777	59779	the old man	1283	" You do not ask any questions about the fate of your only child , "
59788	59826	59777	59779	the old man	1283	" My dear father , that is of course a subject of lively interest to me ; but I did not suppose that you could be in a position to give me any information upon that point . "
59827	59842	59843	59844	Jacob Nowell	173	" I do happen to know something about your daughter , but not much . "
59880	59896	59897	59897	Percival	201	" And this fellow whom she has jilted is pretty well off , I suppose ? "
59901	59918	59853	59853	he	173	" He is an Australian merchant , and , I should imagine , in prosperous circumstances . "
59919	59955	59853	59853	he	173	" Foolish girl ! And this Holbrook is no doubt an adventurer , or he would scarcely have married her in such a secret way . Have you any wish that she should be found ? "
59956	59997	59853	59853	he	173	" Yes , I have a fancy for seeing her before I die . She is my own flesh and blood , like you , and has not injured me as you have . I should like to see her . "
59998	60019	59853	59853	he	173	" And if she happened to take your fancy , you would leave her all your money , I suppose ? "
60020	60031	60033	60035	the old man	1283	" Who told you that I have money to leave ? "
60038	60056	60033	60035	the old man	1283	" Have I not said that I am a poor man , hopelessly impoverished by your extravagance ? "
60057	60219	59853	59853	he	173	" Bah , my dear father , that is all nonsense . My extravagance is a question of nearly twenty years ago . If I had swamped all you possessed in those days which I do n't for a moment believe you have had ample time to make a fresh fortune since then . You would never have lived all those years in Queen Anne 's Court , except for the sake of money - making . Why , the place stinks of money . I know your tricks : buying silver from men who are in too great a hurry to sell it to be particular about the price ; lending money at sixty per cent , a sixty which comes to eighty before the transaction is finished . A man does not lead such a life as yours for nothing . You are rolling in money , and you mean to punish me by leaving it all to Marian . "
60234	60241	60242	60242	he	1289	" You are a consummate scoundrel , "
60245	60288	60242	60242	he	1289	" and are at liberty to think what you please . I tell you , once for all , I am as poor as Job . But if I had a million , I would not give you a sixpence of it . "
60289	60294	60295	60296	the other	595	" So be it , "
60300	60344	60295	60296	the other	595	" I have not performed the duties of a parent very punctually hitherto ; but I do n't mind taking some trouble to find this girl while I am in England , in order that she may not lose her chances with you . "
60345	60366	60242	60242	he	1289	" You need give yourself no trouble on that score . Mr. Fenton has promised to find her for me . "
60367	60379	60295	60296	the other	595	" Indeed ! I should like to see this Mr. Fenton . "
60380	60417	60242	60242	he	1289	" You can see him if you please ; but you are scarcely likely to get a warm reception in that quarter . Mr. Fenton knows what you have been to your daughter and to me . "
60418	60443	60295	60296	the other	595	" I am not going to fling myself into his arms . I only want to hear all he can tell me about Marian . "
60444	60455	60242	60242	he	1289	" How long do you mean to stay in England ? "
60456	60548	60549	60549	he	1649	" That is entirely dependent upon the result of my visit . I had hoped that if I found you living , which I most earnestly desired might be the case , I should find in you a friend and coadjutor . I am employed in starting a great iron company , which is likely I may say certain to result in large gains to all concerned in it ; and I fancied I should experience no difficulty in securing your co - operation . There are the prospectuses of the scheme "
60563	60638	60549	60549	he	1649	" and there is not a line in them that I can not guarantee on my credit as a man of business . You can look over them at your leisure , or not , as you please . I think you must know that I always had an independent spirit , and would be the last of mankind to degrade myself by any servile attempt to alter your line of conduct towards me . "
60639	60645	60647	60649	the old man	1283	" Independent spirit ! Yes ! "
60655	60837	60647	60649	the old man	1283	" a son extorts every sixpence he can from his father and mother ay , Percy , from his weak loving mother ; I know who robbed me to send you money and then , when he can extort no more , boasts of his independence . But that will do . There is no need that we should quarrel . After twenty years ' severance , we can afford to let bygones be bygones . I have told you that I am glad to see you . If you come to me with disinterested feelings , that is enough . You may take back your prospectuses . I have nothing to embark in Yankee speculations . If your scheme is a good one , you will find plenty of enterprising spirits willing to join you ; if it is a bad one , I daresay you will contrive to find dupes . You can come and see me again when you please . And now good - night . I find this kind of talk rather tiring at my age . "
60838	60846	60848	60848	Percival	201	" One word before I leave you , "
60850	60912	60848	60848	Percival	201	" On reflection , I think it will be as well to say nothing about my presence in England to this Mr. Fenton . I shall be more free to hunt for Marian without his co - operation , even supposing he were inclined to give it . You have told me all that he could tell me , I daresay . "
60913	60919	60647	60649	the old man	1283	" I believe I have . "
60920	60950	60848	60848	Percival	201	" Precisely . Therefore no possible good could come of an encounter between him and me , and I shall be glad if you will keep my name dark . "
60951	60968	60647	60649	the old man	1283	" As you please , though I can see no reason for secrecy in the matter . "
60969	60984	60848	60848	Percival	201	" It is not a question of secrecy , but only of prudential reserve . "
60985	60993	60995	60997	the old man	1283	" It may be as you wish , "
61001	61006	60995	60997	the old man	1283	" Good - night . "
61056	61063	61064	61064	he	1283	" The girl must be found , "
61069	61155	61067	61067	himself	1283	" I am convinced there has been a great fortune made in that dingy hole . Better that it should go to her than to a stranger . I 'm very sorry she 's married ; but if this Holbrook is the adventurer I suppose him , the marriage may come to nothing . Yes ; I must find her . A father returned from foreign lands is rather a romantic notion the sort of notion a girl is pretty sure to take kindly to . "
61287	61300	61301	61301	she	1660	" Have you seen much of your friend Mr. Saltram since Sunday ? "
61321	61366	61279	61279	she	1660	" I have not seen him at all since Sunday . He told me he was going back to Oxford or the neighbourhood of Oxford , I believe almost immediately ; and I have not troubled myself to hunt him up at his chambers . "
61367	61372	61373	61374	Mrs. Branston	214	" Gone back already ! "
61392	61470	61373	61374	Mrs. Branston	214	" I can not imagine what charm he finds in a dull village on the banks of the river . He has confessed that the place is the dreariest and most obscure in the world , and that he has neither shooting nor any other kind of amusement . There must be some mysterious attraction , Mr. Fenton . I think your friend is a good deal changed of late . Have n't you found him so ? "
61471	61521	61373	61374	Mrs. Branston	214	" No , Mrs. Branston , I can not say that I have discovered any marked alteration in him since my return from Australia . John Saltram was always wayward and fitful . He may have been a little more so lately , perhaps , but that is all . "
61522	61535	61373	61374	Mrs. Branston	214	" You have a very high opinion of him , I suppose ? "
61536	61589	61373	61374	Mrs. Branston	214	" He is very dear to me . We were something more than friends in the ordinary acceptation of the word . Do you remember the story of those two noble young Venetians who inscribed upon their shield Fraires , non amici ? Saltram and I have been brothers rather than friends . "
61590	61599	61600	61600	Adela	212	" And you think him a good man ? "
61604	61668	61373	61374	Mrs. Branston	214	" Most decidedly ; I have reason to think so . I believe him to be a noble - hearted and honourable man ; a little neglectful or disdainful of conventionalities , wearing his faith in God and his more sacred feelings anywhere than upon his sleeve ; but a man who can not fail to come right in the long - run . "
61669	61761	61373	61374	Mrs. Branston	214	" I am so glad to hear you say that . I have known Mr. Saltram some time , as you may have heard and like him very much . But my cousin Mrs. Pallinson has quite an aversion to him , and speaks against him with such a positive air at times , that I have been almost inclined to think she must be right . I am very inexperienced in the ways of the world , and am naturally disposed to lean a little upon the opinions of others . "
61762	61782	61373	61374	Mrs. Branston	214	" But do n't you think there may be a reason for Mrs. Pallinson 's dislike of my friend ? "
61796	61805	61806	61806	she	212	" I think I know what you mean , "
61809	61879	61806	61806	she	212	" Yes , it is just possible that Mrs. Pallinson may be jealously disposed towards any acquaintance of mine , on account of that paragon of perfection , her son Theobald . I have not been so blind as not to see her views in that quarter . But be assured , Mr. Fenton , that whatever may happen to me , I shall never become Mrs. Theobald Pallinson . "
61880	61908	61373	61374	Mrs. Branston	214	" I hope not . I am quite ready to acknowledge Mr. Pallinson 's merits and accomplishments , but I do not think him worthy of you . "
61909	62027	61806	61806	she	212	" It is rather awful , is n't it , for me to speak of marriage at all within a few months of my husband 's death ? But when a woman has money , people will not allow her to forget that she is a widow for ever so short a time . But it is quite a question if I shall ever marry again . I have very little doubt that real happiness is most likely to be found in a wise avoidance of all the perils and perplexities of that foolish passion which we read of in novels , if one could only be wise ; do n't you think so , Mr. Fenton ? "
62028	62042	62043	62043	Gilbert	178	" My own experience inclines me to agree with you , Mrs. Branston , "
62054	62091	61806	61806	she	212	" Your own experience has been unfortunate , then ? I wish I were worthy of your confidence . Mr. Saltram told me some time ago that you were engaged to a very charming young lady . "
62092	62102	61806	61806	she	212	" The young lady in question has jilted me . "
62103	62117	61806	61806	she	212	" Indeed ! And you are very angry with her , of course ? "
62118	62143	61806	61806	she	212	" I loved her too well to be angry with her . I reserve my indignation for the scoundrel who stole her from me . "
62144	62158	61806	61806	she	212	" It is very generous of you to make excuses for the lady , "
63313	63329	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" I have been thinking over what you were asking me last night , sir , "
63345	63376	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" and though I ca n't say that I ever heard the name of Holbrook , I fancy I may have seen the lady and gentleman you are looking for . "
63377	63380	63382	63382	Gilbert	178	" Indeed ! "
63397	63491	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" I hope you wo n't let me spoil your dinner , sir ; I know that sole 's fresh . I 'm a pretty good judge of those things , and choose every bit of fish that 's cooked in this house . But as I was saying , sir , with regard to this lady and gentleman , I think you said that the people you are looking for were strangers to this part of the country , and were occupying a farm - house that had been lent to them . "
63492	63495	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" Precisely . "
63496	63521	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" Well , sir , I remember some time in the early part of the year , I think it must have been about March "
63522	63537	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" Yes , the people I am looking for would have arrived in March . "
63538	63647	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" Indeed , sir ! That makes it seem likely . I remember a lady and gentleman coming here from the railway station we 've got a station close by our town , as you know , sir , I daresay . They wanted a fly to take them and their luggage on somewhere I ca n't for the life of me remember the name of the place but it was a ten - mile drive , and it was a farm that I could swear to Something Farm . If it had been a place I 'd known , I think I should have remembered the name . "
63648	63658	63659	63659	Gilbert	178	" Can I see the man who drove them ? "
63663	63752	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" The young man that drove them , sir , has left me , and has left these parts a month come next Tuesday . Where he has gone is more than I can tell you . He was very good with horses ; but he turned out badly , cheated me up hill and down dale , as you may say though what hills and dales have got to do with it is more than I can tell and I was obliged to get rid of him . "
63753	63838	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" That 's provoking . But if the people I want are anywhere within ten miles of this place , I do n't suppose I should be long finding them . Yet the mere fact of two strangers coming here , and going on to some place called a farm , seems very slight ground to go upon . The month certainly corresponds with the time at which Mr. and Mrs. Holbrook came to Hampshire . Did you take any particular notice of them ? "
63839	63911	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" I took particular notice of the lady . She was as pretty a woman as ever I set eyes upon quite a girl . I noticed that the gentleman was very careful and tender with her when he put her into the carriage , wrapping her up , and so on . He looked a good deal older than her , and I did n't much like his looks altogether . "
63912	63918	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" Could you describe him ? "
63919	63970	63330	63335	the host of the White Swan	1708	" Well no , sir . The time was short , and he was wrapped up a good deal ; the collar of his overcoat turned up , and a scarf round his neck . He had dark eyes , I remember , and rather a stern look in them . "
64175	64210	64211	64211	he	178	" I should have fancied that , as a settled inhabitant of the place , you would be likely to know every farm and farm - house within ten miles or within twenty miles , "
64214	64435	64169	64169	Gilbert	178	" Well , sir , I daresay I do know the neighbourhood pretty well , in a general way . But I think , if I 'd known the name of the place this lady and gentleman were going to , it would have struck me more than it did , and I should have remembered it . I was uncommonly busy through that afternoon , for it was market - day , and there were a mort of people going in and out . I never did interfere much with the fly business ; it was only by taking the gentleman out some soda - and - brandy that I came to take the notice I did of the lady 's looks and his care of her . I know it was a ten - mile drive , and that I told the gentleman the fare , so as there might be no bother between him and William Tyler , my man , at the end ; and he agreed to it in a liberal off - hand kind of way , like a man who does n't care much for money . As to farms within ten miles of here , there are a dozen at least , one way and another some small , and some large . "
64436	64461	64169	64169	Gilbert	178	" Do you know of any place in the ownership of a gentleman who would be likely to lend his house to a friend ? "
64462	64651	64169	64169	Gilbert	178	" I ca n't say I do , sir . They 're tenant - farmers about here mostly , and rather a roughish lot , as you may say . There 's a place over beyond Crosber , ten miles off and more ; I do n't know the name of it , or the person it belongs to ; but I 've noticed it many a time as I 've driven by ; a curious old - fashioned house , standing back off one of the lanes out of Crosber , with a large garden before it . A queer lonesome place altogether . I should take it to be two or three hundred years old ; and I should n't think the house had had money spent upon it within the memory of man . It 's a dilapidated tumbledown old gazabo of a place , and yet there 's a kind of prettiness about it in summer - time , when the garden is full of flowers . There 's a river runs through some of the land about half a mile from the house . "
64652	64661	64169	64169	Gilbert	178	" What kind of a place is Crosber ? "
64662	64741	64169	64169	Gilbert	178	" A bit of a village on the road from here to Portsmouth . The house I 'm telling you about is a mile from Crosber at the least , away from the main road . There 's two or three lanes or by - roads about there , and it lies in one of them that turns sharp off by the Blue Boar , which is about the only inn where you can bait a horse thereabouts . "
64742	64783	64169	64169	Gilbert	178	" I 'll ride over there to - morrow morning , and have a look at this queer old house . You might give me the names of any other farms you know about this neighbourhood , and their occupants . "
65619	65636	65601	65601	her	5090	" And I suppose all the letters for people in this neighbourhood pass through your hands ? "
65637	65663	65601	65601	her	5090	" Yes , sir , all of them ; I could n't have failed to notice if there had been any one of that name . "
65774	65786	65787	65787	he	178	" There is an old house about a mile from here , "
65793	65827	65787	65787	he	178	" a house belonging to a farm , in the lane yonder that turns off by the Blue Boar . Have you any notion to whom it belongs , or who lives there ? "
65828	65839	65840	65841	the girl	5090	" An old house in that lane across the way ? "
65846	65892	65840	65841	the girl	5090	" That 's Golder 's lane , and leads to Golder's - green . There 's not many houses there ; it 's rather a lonesome kind of place . Do you mean a big old - fashioned house standing far back in a garden ? "
65893	65907	65840	65841	the girl	5090	" Yes ; that must be the place I want to know about . "
65908	65989	65840	65841	the girl	5090	" It must be the Grange , surely . It was a gentleman 's house once ; but there 's only a bailiff lives there now . The farm belongs to some gentleman down in Midlandshire , a baronet ; I ca n't call to mind his name at this moment , though I have heard it often enough . Mr. Carley 's daughter Carley is the name of the bailiff at the Grange comes here for all they want . "
66024	66045	66046	66046	he	178	" Do you know if these people at the Grange have had any one staying with them lately any lodgers ? "
66051	66092	66048	66049	the girl	5090	" Yes ; they have lodgers pretty well every summer . There were some people this year , a lady and gentleman ; but they never seemed to have any letters , and I ca n't tell you their names . "
66093	66100	66048	66049	the girl	5090	" Are they living there still ? "
66101	66152	66048	66049	the girl	5090	" I ca n't tell you that . I used to see them at church now and then in the summer - time ; but I have n't seen them lately . There 's a church at Golder's - green almost as near , and they may have been there . "
66153	66163	66164	66164	Gilbert	178	" Will you tell me what they were like ? "
66218	66241	66197	66198	the innkeeper	1788	" The lady is very pretty and very young quite a girl . The gentleman older , dark , and not handsome . "
66242	66264	66197	66198	the innkeeper	1788	" Yes . Has the lady gray eyes , and dark - brown hair , and a very bright expressive face ? "
66265	66270	66197	66198	the innkeeper	1788	" Yes , sir . "
66271	66298	66197	66198	the innkeeper	1788	" Pray try to remember the name of the gentleman to whom the Grange belongs . It is of great importance to me to know that . "
66299	66308	66309	66310	the girl	5090	" I 'll ask my father , sir , "
66316	66324	66309	66310	the girl	5090	" he 's pretty sure to know . "
66359	66369	66370	66370	he	1283	" I 've heard the name times and often , "
66373	66440	66370	66370	he	1283	" though I never set eyes upon the gentleman . William Carley has been bailiff at the Grange these twenty years , and I do n't believe as the owner has ever come nigh the place in all that time . Let me see , it 's a common name enough , though the gentleman is a baronight . Forster that 's it Sir something Forster . "
66441	66445	66447	66447	Gilbert	178	" Sir David ? "
66449	66465	66447	66447	Gilbert	178	" You 've hit it , sir . Sir David Forster that 's the gentleman . "
67503	67515	67516	67516	he	178	" This is Sir David Forster 's house , I believe , "
67519	67535	67516	67516	he	178	" Yes , sir , it be ; but Sir David does n't live here . "
67536	67553	67554	67554	He	178	" I know that . You have some lodgers here a lady and gentleman called Holbrook . "
67594	67599	67600	67601	the woman	5298	" Yes , sir , "
67614	67637	67600	67601	the woman	5298	" Mrs. Holbrook is here , but Mr. Holbrook is away up in London . Did you wish to see the lady ? "
67688	67691	67692	67692	he	178	" Yes , "
67696	67728	67692	67692	he	178	" I wish to see her . You can take me to her at once . I am an old friend . There is no occasion to carry in my name . "
68497	68501	68502	68502	she	183	" You here ! "
68505	68520	68502	68502	she	183	" O , how did you find this place ? Why did you come ? "
68596	68636	68546	68547	Mrs. Branston	214	" Did you imagine that I should rest until I had seen you once more , Marian ? Did you suppose I should submit to lose you without hearing from your own lips why I have been so unfortunate ? "
68637	68660	68661	68661	she	183	" I did not think you would waste time or thought upon any one so wicked as I have been towards you , "
68677	68720	68661	68661	she	183	" I fancied that whatever love you had ever felt for me and I know how well you did love me would perish in a moment when you found how basely I had acted . I hoped that it would be so . "
68721	68764	68546	68547	Mrs. Branston	214	" No , Marian ; love like mine does not perish so easily as that . O , my love , my love , why did you forsake me so cruelly ? What had I done to merit your desertion of me ? "
68765	68961	68661	68661	she	183	" What had you done ! You had only been too good to me . I know that there is no excuse for my sin . I have prayed that you and I might never meet again . What can I say ? From first to last I have been wrong . From first to last I have acted weakly and wickedly . I was flattered and gratified by your affection for me ; and when I found that my dear uncle had set his heart upon our marriage , I yielded against my own better reason , which warned me that I did not love you as you deserved to be loved . Then for a long time I was blind to the truth . I did not examine my own heart . I was quite able to estimate all your noble qualities , and I fancied that I should be very happy as your wife . But you must remember that at the last , when you were leaving England , I asked you to release me , and told you that it would be happier for both of us to be free . "
68962	68969	68546	68547	Mrs. Branston	214	" Why was that , Marian ? "
68970	68984	68661	68661	she	183	" Because at that last moment I began to doubt my own heart . "
68985	69010	68546	68547	Mrs. Branston	214	" Had there been any other influence at work , Marian ? Had you seen your husband , Mr. Holbrook , at that time ? "
69028	69036	69037	69037	she	1892	" I can not answer that question , "
69042	69080	68661	68661	she	183	" That is quite as good as saying ' yes . ' You had seen this man ; he had come between us already . O , Marian , Marian , why were you not more candid ? "
69081	69129	68661	68661	she	183	" Because I was weak and foolish . I could not bear to make you unhappy . O , believe me , Gilbert , I had no thought of falsehood at that time . I fully meant to be true to my promise , come what might . "
69130	69139	69140	69140	he	1892	" I am quite willing to believe that , "
69144	69218	69140	69140	he	1892	" I believe that you acted from first to last under the influence of a stronger will than your own . You can see that I feel no resentment against you . I come to you in sorrow , not in anger . But I want to understand how this thing came to pass . Why was it that you never wrote to me to tell me the complete change in your feelings ? "
69219	69226	69227	69227	Marian	183	" It was thought better not , "
69234	69238	69140	69140	he	1892	" By you ? "
69239	69246	69140	69140	he	1892	" No ; by my husband . "
69247	69267	69140	69140	he	1892	" And you suffered him to dictate to you in that matter . Against your own sense of right ? "
69268	69273	69274	69274	she	183	" I loved him , "
69278	69368	69274	69274	she	183	" I have never refused to obey him in anything . I will own that I thought it would be better to write and tell you the truth ; but my husband thought otherwise . He wished our marriage to remain a secret from you , and from all the world for some time to come . He had his own reasons for that reasons I was bound to respect . I can not think how you came to discover this out - of - the - world place . "
69369	69494	69140	69140	he	1892	" I have taken some trouble to find you , Marian , and it is a hard thing to find you the wife of another ; but the bitterness of it must be borne . I do not want to reproach you when I tell you that my life has been broken utterly by this blow . I want you to believe in my truth and honour , to trust me now as you might have trusted me when you first discovered that you could not love me . Since I am not to be your husband , let me be the next best thing your friend . The day may come in which you will have need of an honest man 's friendship . "
69501	69507	69508	69508	she	1893	" You are very good , "
69511	69587	69508	69508	she	1893	" but there is no possibility of friendship between you and me . If you will only say that you can forgive me for the great wrong I have done you , there will be a heavy burden lifted from my heart ; and whatever you may think now , I can not doubt that in the future you will find some one far better worthy of your love than ever I could have been . "
69588	69661	69495	69495	She	1893	" That is the stereotyped form of consolation , Marian , a man is always referred to that shadowy and perfect creature who is to appear in the future , and heal all his wounds . There will be no such after - love for me . I staked all when I played the great game ; and have lost all . But why can not I be your friend , Marian ? "
69662	69692	69508	69508	she	1893	" Can you forgive my husband for his part in the wrong that has been done you ? Can you be his friend , knowing what he has done ? "
69693	69696	69697	69697	Gilbert	178	" No ! "
69705	69719	69701	69701	his	178	" I can forgive your weakness , but not the man 's treachery . "
69720	69728	69729	69729	Marian	183	" Then you can never be mine , "
69733	69833	69701	69701	his	178	" Remember , I am not talking of a common friendship , a friendship of daily association . I offer myself to you as refuge in the hour of trouble , a counsellor in perplexity , a brother always waiting in the background of your life to protect or serve you . Of course , it is quite possible you may never have need of protection or service God knows , I wish you all happiness but there are not many lives quite free from trouble , and the day may come in which you will want a friend . "
69834	69846	69847	69847	Gilbert	178	" If it ever does , I will remember your goodness . "
70118	70131	70132	70132	he	178	" I want you to tell me about your husband , Marian , "
70138	70145	70132	70132	he	178	" who and what he is . "
70146	70153	70154	70154	she	169	" Why should I do that ? "
70169	70190	70154	70154	she	169	" You have said that you will never forgive him . What interest can you possibly feel in his affairs ? "
70191	70201	70132	70132	he	178	" I am interested in him upon your account . "
70202	70225	70154	70154	she	169	" I can not tell you anything about him . I do not know how you could have discovered even his name . "
70226	70241	70132	70132	he	178	" I learned that at Wygrove , where I first heard of your marriage . "
70242	70251	70154	70154	she	169	" Did you go to Wygrove , then ? "
70252	70317	70132	70132	he	178	" Yes ; I have told you that I spared no pains to find you . Nor shall I spare any pains to discover the history of the man who has wronged me . It would be wiser for you to be frank with me , Marian . Rely upon it that I shall sooner or later learn the secret underlying this treacherous business . "
70318	70368	70154	70154	she	169	" You profess to be my friend , and yet are avowedly say husband 's enemy . Why can not you be truly generous , Gilbert , and pardon him ? Believe me , he was not willingly treacherous ; it was his fate to do you this wrong . "
70369	70424	70132	70132	he	178	" A poor excuse for a man , Marian . No , my charity will not stretch far enough for that . But I do not come to you quite on a selfish errand , to speak solely of my own wrongs . I have something to tell you of real importance to yourself . "
70425	70430	70154	70154	she	169	" What is that ? "
70448	70485	70132	70132	he	178	" It is my impression that this old man is rich , Marian ; and there is little doubt that he would leave all he possesses to you , if you went to him at once . "
70486	70500	70501	70501	she	1901	" I do not care very much about money for my own sake , "
70509	70561	70501	70501	she	1901	" but we are not rich , and I should be glad of anything that would improve my husband 's position . I should like to see my grandfather : I stand so much alone in the world that it would be very sweet to me to find a near relation . "
70562	70574	70575	70575	Gilbert	178	" Your husband must surely have seen Mr. Nowell 's advertisement , "
70581	70604	70575	70575	Gilbert	178	" It was odd that he did not tell you about it that he did not wish you to reply to it . "
70605	70628	70629	70629	Marian	169	" The advertisement may have escaped him , or he may have looked upon it as a trap to discover our retreat , "
70633	70644	70501	70501	she	1901	" I can not understand the motive for such secrecy . "
70645	70690	70575	70575	Gilbert	178	" There is no occasion that you should understand it . Every life has its own mystery its peculiar perplexities . When I married my husband , I was prepared to share all his troubles . I have been obedient to him in everything . "
70691	70702	70501	70501	she	1901	" And has your marriage brought you happiness , Marian ? "
70703	70709	70710	70710	she	169	" I love my husband , "
70732	70750	70710	70710	she	169	" I do not suppose that there is such a thing as perfect happiness in the world . "
70812	70822	70823	70823	he	178	" I will not prolong my visit , Marian , "
70827	70860	70823	70823	he	178	" It was altogether a foolish one , perhaps ; but I wanted so much to see you once more , to hear some explanation of your conduct from your own lips . "
70861	70872	70873	70873	she	568	" My conduct can admit of neither explanation nor justification , "
70877	70910	70873	70873	she	568	" I know how wickedly I have acted . Believe me , Gilbert , I am quite conscious of my unworthiness , and how little right I have to expect your forgiveness . "
70911	70971	70823	70823	he	178	" It is my weakness , rather than my merit , not to be able to cherish any angry feeling against you , Marian . Mine has been a slavish kind of love . I suppose that sort of thing never is successful . Women have an instinctive contempt for men who love them with such blind unreasonable idolatry . "
70972	70994	70995	70995	she	1905	" I do not know how that may be ; but I know that I have always respected and esteemed you , "
71003	71046	70823	70823	he	178	" I am grateful to you even for so much as that . And now I suppose I must say good - bye rather a hard word to say under the circumstances . Heaven knows when you and I may meet again . "
71047	71114	70998	70998	her	1905	" Wo n't you stop and take some luncheon ? I dine early when my husband is away ; it saves trouble to the people of the house . The bailiff 's daughter always dines with me when I am alone ; but I do n't suppose you will mind sitting down with her . She is a good girl , and very fond of me . "
71115	71150	70823	70823	he	178	" I would sit down to dinner with a chimney - sweep , if he were a favourite of yours , Marian or Mrs. Holbrook ; I suppose I must call you that now . "
71265	71282	71283	71283	she	169	" I am sure I 'm very glad any visitor should come to see Mrs. Holbrook , "
71286	71322	71283	71283	she	169	" for she has had a sad lonely time of it ever since she has been here , poor dear . There are not many young married women would put up with such a life . "
71323	71326	71327	71327	Marian	169	" Nelly , "
71331	71351	71327	71327	Marian	169	" you know that I have had nothing to put up with that I have been quite happy here . "
71352	71503	71283	71283	she	169	" Ah , it 's all very well to say that , Mrs. Holbrook ; but I know better . I know how many lonely days you 've spent , so downhearted that you could scarcely speak or look up from your book , and that only an excuse for fretting . If you 're a friend of Mr. Holbrook 's , you might tell him as much , sir ; that he 's killing his pretty young wife by inches , by leaving her so often alone in this dreary place . Goodness knows , it is n't that I want to get rid of her . I like her so much that I sha'n't know what to do with myself when she 's gone . But I love her too well not to speak the truth when I see a chance of its getting to the right ears . "
71504	71514	71515	71515	Gilbert	178	" I am no friend of Mr. Holbrook 's , "
71518	71531	71515	71515	Gilbert	178	" but I think you are a good generous - hearted girl . "
71532	71540	71541	71541	Marian	169	" You are a very foolish girl , "
71544	71604	71541	71541	Marian	169	" and I am extremely angry with you for talking such utter nonsense about me . I may have been a little out of spirits sometimes in my husband 's absence ; but that is all . I shall begin to think that you really do want to get rid of me , Nell , say what you will . "
71605	71739	71740	71741	The girl	5090	" That 's a pretty thing , when you know that I love you as dearly as if you were my sister ; to say nothing of father , who makes a profit by your being here , and would be fine and angry with me for interfering . No , Mrs. Holbrook ; it 's your own happiness I 'm thinking of , and nothing else . And I do say that it 's a shame for a pretty young woman like you to be shut up in a lonely old farm - house while your husband is away , enjoying himself goodness knows where ; and when he is here , I ca n't see that he 's very good company , considering that he spends the best part of his time "
71801	71818	71819	71819	Marian	169	" I will not have my affairs talked about in this foolish way , Ellen Carley , "
71966	71973	71974	71974	he	178	" Good - bye , Marian , "
71977	71988	71974	71974	he	178	" I suppose we are never likely to meet again . "
71989	72013	71974	71974	he	178	" One never knows what may happen ; but I think it is far better we should not meet , for many reasons . "
72014	72027	71974	71974	he	178	" What am I to tell your grandfather when I see him ? "
72028	72049	71974	71974	he	178	" That I will come to him as soon as I can get my husband 's permission to do so . "
72050	72076	71974	71974	he	178	" I should not think there would be any difficulty about that , when he knows that this relationship is likely to bring you fortune . "
72077	72082	71974	71974	he	178	" I daresay not . "
72083	72105	71974	71974	he	178	" And if you come to London to see Mr. Nowell , there will be some chance of our meeting again . "
72106	72114	71974	71974	he	178	" What good can come of that ? "
72115	72163	71974	71974	he	178	" Not much to me , I daresay . It would be a desperate , melancholy kind of pleasure . Anything is better than the idea of losing sight of you for ever of leaving this room to - day never to look upon your face again . "
72312	72316	72317	72317	he	178	" My darling , "
72320	72337	72317	72317	he	178	" I forgive you with all my heart ; and I will pray for your happiness . "
72338	72348	72349	72349	she	169	" Will you try to forgive my husband also ? "
72357	72389	72352	72352	her	169	" I do not know what I am capable of in that direction . I promise that , for your sake , I will not attempt to do him any injury . "
72390	72447	72317	72317	he	178	" God bless you for that promise ! I have so dreaded the chance of a meeting between you two . It has often been the thought of that which has made me unhappy when that faithful girl , Nelly , has noticed my low spirits . You have removed a great weight from my mind . "
72448	72459	72352	72352	her	169	" And you will trust me better after that promise ? "
72460	72479	72317	72317	he	178	" Yes ; I will trust you as you deserve to be trusted , with all my heart . "
72480	72509	72352	72352	her	169	" And now , good - bye . It is a hard word for me to say ; but I must not detain you here in the cold . "
72638	72655	72656	72656	he	1927	" And she loves this man well enough to endure the dullest existence for his sake , "
72688	72702	72656	72656	he	1927	" She could forget all our plans for the future at his bidding . "
72810	72829	72830	72830	he	1927	" But I will have some explanation from Sir David Forster as to that lie he told me , "
72835	72847	72830	72830	he	1927	" and I will question John Saltram about this man Holbrook . "
74949	74951	74945	74945	him	270	" grumpy "
75394	75400	75402	75403	the bailiff	6494	" If you must marry , "
75405	75589	75402	75403	the bailiff	6494	" and it 's what girls like you seem to be always thinking about , you ca n't do better than take up with Steph Whitelaw . He 's a warm man , Nell , and a wife of his will never want a meal of victuals or a good gown to her back . You 'd better not waste your smiles and your civil words on a beggar like young Randall , who wo n't have a home to take you to for these ten years to come not then , perhaps for there 's not much to be made by law in Malsham now - a - days . And when his father dies supposing he 's accommodating enough to die in a reasonable time , which it 's ten to one he wo n't be the young man will have his mother and sisters to keep upon the business very likely , and there 'd be a nice look - out for you . Now , if you marry my old friend Steph , he can make you a lady . "
75642	75659	75660	75660	Nelly	176	" Stephen Whitelaw had need be a gentleman himself before he could make me a lady , "
75665	75737	75660	75660	Nelly	176	" I do n't think fine clothes can make gentlefolks ; no , nor farming one 's own land , either , though that sounds well enough . I am not in any hurry to leave you , father , and I 'm not one of those girls who are always thinking of getting married ; but come what may , depend upon it , I shall never marry Mr. Whitelaw . "
75738	75744	75745	75746	the bailiff	6494	" Why not , pray ? "
75779	75785	75786	75786	she	176	" Because I detest him , "
75789	75877	75786	75786	she	176	" a mean , close , discontented creature , who can see no pleasure in life except money - making . I hate the very sight of his pale pinched face , father , and the sound of his hard shrill voice . If I had to choose between the workhouse and marrying Stephen Whitelaw , I 'd choose the workhouse ; yes , and scrub , and wash , and drudge , and toil there all my days , rather than be mistress of Wyncomb Farm . "
75878	75885	75887	75888	the father	5422	" Well , upon my word , "
75910	75976	75894	75894	his	5422	" you 're a pretty article ; you 're a nice piece of goods for a man to bring up and waste his substance upon a piece of goods that will turn round upon one and refuse a man who farms his own land . Mind , he has n't asked you yet , my lady ; and never may , for aught I know . "
75977	75986	75987	75987	Nelly	176	" I hope he never will , father , "
76000	76048	75894	75894	his	5422	" If he does , and you do n't snap at such a chance , you need never look for a sixpence from me ; and you 'd best make yourself scarce pretty soon into the bargain . I 'll have no such trumpery about my house . "
76049	76074	76079	76080	the girl	5090	" Very well , father ; I daresay I can get my living somewhere else , without working much harder than I do here . "
77406	77417	77418	77418	he	272	" Will she come to me , do you think ? "
77421	77488	77531	77531	He	2141	" I have no doubt that she will do so , directly she hears how ill you have been . She was very much pleased at the idea of seeing you , and only waited for her husband 's permission to come . But I do n't suppose she will wait for that when she knows of your illness . I shall write to her immediately . "
77489	77492	77493	77494	Jacob Nowell	173	" Do , "
77498	77520	77493	77494	Jacob Nowell	173	" I want to see her before I die . You did not meet the husband , then , I suppose ? "
77521	77530	77531	77531	He	2141	" No ; Mr. Holbrook was not there . "
77649	77659	77660	77660	he	1283	" I shall make my will to - morrow , "
77668	77736	77660	77660	he	1283	" I do n't mind owning to you that I have something considerable to bequeath ; for I think I can trust you . And if I should die before my grandchild comes to me , you will see that she has her rights , wo n't you ? You will take care that she is not cheated by her husband , or by any one else ? "
77737	77762	77660	77660	he	1283	" I shall hold it a sacred charge to protect her interests , so far as it is possible for me to do so . "
77763	77786	77660	77660	he	1283	" That 's well . I shall make you one of the executors to my will , if you 've no objection . "
77787	77850	77660	77660	he	1283	" No . The executorship will bring me into collision with Mr. Holbrook , no doubt ; but I have resolved upon my line of conduct with regard to him , and I am prepared for whatever may happen . My chief desire now is to be a real friend to your granddaughter ; for I believe she has need of friends . "
78048	78067	78069	78070	Mr. Medler	276	" Of course , if she has children , you 'd like the money to go to them , "
78075	78131	78069	78070	Mr. Medler	276	" that 's clear enough , and had better be set out in your will . But suppose she should have no children , you 'd scarcely like all you leave to go to her husband , who is quite a stranger to you , and who may be a scoundrel for aught you know . "
78132	78146	78337	78337	his	5706	" No ; I certainly should n't much care about enriching this Holbrook . "
78147	78201	78069	78070	Mr. Medler	276	" Of course not ; to say nothing of the danger there would be in giving him so strong an interest in his wife 's death . Not but what I daresay he 'll contrive to squander the greater part of the money during her lifetime . Is it all in hard cash ? "
78202	78226	78337	78337	his	5706	" No ; there is some house - property at Islington , which pays a high interest ; and there are other freeholds . "
78227	78292	78069	78070	Mr. Medler	276	" Then we might tie those up , giving Mrs. Holbrook only the income . It is essential to provide against possible villany or extravagance on the part of the husband . Women are so weak and helpless in these matters . And in the event of your granddaughter dying without children , would n't you rather let the estate go to your son ? "
78293	78297	78299	78300	Jacob Nowell	173	" To him ! "
78302	78314	78299	78300	Jacob Nowell	173	" I have sworn that I would not leave him sixpence . "
78315	78332	78334	78335	the lawyer	5706	" That 's a kind of oath which no man ever considers himself bound to keep , "
78342	78478	78337	78337	his	5706	" Remember , it 's only a remote contingency . The chances are that your granddaughter will have a family to inherit this property , and that she will survive her father . And then , if we give her power to make a will , of course it 's pretty certain that she 'll leave everything to this husband of hers . But I do n't think we ought to do that , Mr. Nowell . I think it would be a far wiser arrangement to give this young lady only a life interest in the real estate . That makes the husband a loser by her death , instead of a possible gainer to a large amount . And I consider that your son 's name has a right to come in here . "
78479	78527	78337	78337	his	5706	" I can not acknowledge that he has any such right . His extravagance almost ruined me when he was a young man ; and his ingratitude would have broken my heart , if I had been weak enough to suffer myself to be crushed by it . "
78528	78564	78337	78337	his	5706	" Time works changes amongst the worst of us , Mr. Nowell , I daresay your son has improved his habits in all these years and is heartily sorry for the errors of his youth . "
78565	78573	78574	78576	the old man	1283	" Have you seen him , Medler ? "
78580	78604	78574	78576	the old man	1283	" Seen your son lately ? No ; indeed , my dear sir , I had no notion that he was in England . "
78904	78930	78935	78935	himself	276	" I do n't suppose Nowell will thank me much for what I 've done , though I 've had difficulty enough in doing it , "
78952	78990	78935	78935	himself	276	" For of course the chances are ten to one against his surviving his daughter . Still these young women sometimes go off the hooks in an unexpected way , and he may come into the reversion . "
79028	79057	79090	79093	one of the witnesses	2177	" To attending at your own house with relation to drawing up the rough draft of your will , and consultation of two hours and a half thereupon ; "
79230	79244	79250	79250	himself	2188	" I think I might work round the governor if I had time , "
79266	79322	79253	79253	he	2188	" but I fancy the old chap has taken his ticket for the next world booked through per express train , and the chances are that he 'll keep his word and not leave me sixpence . Rather hard lines that , after my taking the trouble to come over here and hunt him up . "
79627	79631	79618	79618	he	201	" the other side "
79917	79935	79936	79936	he	5706	" And if she should die childless , I should get all the free - hold property ? "
79959	79970	79952	79952	his	5706	" Yes ; all the real estate would be yours . "
79971	79982	79952	79952	his	5706	" Have you any notion what the property is worth ? "
79983	80044	79952	79952	his	5706	" Not an exact notion . Your father gave me a list of investments . Altogether , I should fancy , the income will be something handsome between two and three thousand a year , perhaps . Strange , is n't it , for a man with all that money to have lived such a life as your father 's ? "
80045	80049	79952	79952	his	5706	" Strange indeed , "
80057	80071	80072	80072	he	5706	" And my daughter will step into two or three thousand a year , "
80076	80193	80072	80072	he	5706	" very pleasant for her , and for her husband into the bargain . Of course I 'm not going to say that I would n't rather have had the income myself . You 'd scarcely swallow that , as a man of the world , you see , Medler . But the girl is my only child , and though circumstances have divided us for the greater part of our lives , blood is thicker than water ; and in short , since there was no getting the governor to do the right thing , and leave this money to me , it 's the next best thing that he should leave it to Marian . "
80194	80216	80218	80219	Mr. Medler	276	" To say nothing of the possibility of her dying without children , and your coming into the property after all , "
80236	80239	80241	80241	Percival	201	" Sir , "
80244	80261	80241	80241	Percival	201	" do you imagine me capable of speculating upon the untimely death of my only child ? "
80319	80395	80308	80308	he	5706	" Remember , if ever by any strange chance you should come into this property , you have me to thank for getting your name into the will , and for giving your daughter only a life interest . She would have had every penny left to her without reserve , if I had n't fought for your interests as hard as ever I fought for anything in the whole course of my professional career . "
80396	80454	80457	80458	Percival Nowell	201	" You 're a good fellow , Medler ; and if ever fortune should favour me , which hardly seems on the cards , I sha'n't forget what I promised you the other day . I daresay you did the best you could for me , though it does n't amount to much when it 's done . "
80478	80487	80488	80488	he	276	" I ca n't half understand his coolness , "
80493	80598	80488	80488	he	276	" I expected him to be as savage as a bear when he found that the old man had left him nothing . I thought I should hear nothing but execrations and blasphemies ; for I think I know my gentleman pretty well of old , and that he 's not a person to take a disappointment of this kind very sweetly . There must be something under that quiet manner of his . Perhaps he knows more about his daughter than he cares to let out ; knows that she is sickly , and that he stands a good chance of surviving her . "
81028	81041	81042	81042	Gilbert	178	" Why , John , you are as pallid as a ghost ! "
81072	81089	81060	81060	he	178	" You have been at the old work , I suppose overdoing it , as usual ! "
81090	81155	81316	81317	John Saltram	246	" No , I have been working very little for these last few days . The truth is , I have not been able to work . The divine afflatus would n't come down upon me . There are times when a man 's brain seems to be made of melted butter . Mine has been like that for the last week or so . "
81156	81170	81060	81060	he	178	" I thought you were going back to your fishing village near Oxford . "
81171	81212	81316	81317	John Saltram	246	" No , I was not in spirits for that . I have dined two or three times in Cavendish Square , and have been made much of , and have contrived to forget my troubles for a few hours . "
81213	81247	81248	81248	Gilbert	178	" You talk of your troubles as if you were very heavily burdened ; and yet , for the life of me , I can not see what you have to complain of , "
81252	81302	81248	81248	Gilbert	178	" Of course not . That is always the case with one 's friends even the best of them . It 's only the man who wears the shoe that knows why it pinches and galls him . But what have you been doing since I saw you last ? "
81303	81310	81316	81317	John Saltram	246	" I have been in Hampshire . "
81311	81314	81316	81317	John Saltram	246	" Indeed ! "
81326	81338	81316	81317	John Saltram	246	" And what took you into that quarter of the world ? "
81339	81370	81248	81248	Gilbert	178	" I thought you took more interest in my affairs than to have to ask that question . I went to look for Marian Holbrook , and I found her . "
81371	81376	81377	81378	Mr. Saltram	2235	" Poor old fellow ! "
81382	81394	81377	81378	Mr. Saltram	2235	" And was there any satisfaction for you in the meeting ? "
81395	81416	81248	81248	Gilbert	178	" Yes , and no . There was a kind of mournful pleasure in seeing the dear face once more . "
81417	81427	81377	81378	Mr. Saltram	2235	" She must have been surprised to see you . "
81428	81515	81248	81248	Gilbert	178	" She was , no doubt , surprised unpleasantly , perhaps ; but she received me very kindly , and was perfectly frank upon every subject except her husband . She would tell me nothing about him neither his position in the world , nor his profession , if he has one , as I suppose he has . She owned he was not rich , and that is about all she said of him . Poor girl , I do not think she is happy ! "
81516	81526	81377	81378	Mr. Saltram	2235	" What ground have you for such an idea ? "
81527	81637	81248	81248	Gilbert	178	" Her face , which told me a great deal more than her words . Her beauty is very much faded since the summer evening when I first saw her in Lidford Church . She seems to lead a lonely life in the old farm - house to which her husband brought her immediately after their marriage a life which few women would care to lead . And now , John , I want to know how it is you have kept back the truth from me in this matter ; that you have treated me with a reserve which I had no right to expect from a friend . "
81638	81645	81377	81378	Mr. Saltram	2235	" What have I kept from you "
81646	81654	81248	81248	Gilbert	178	" Your knowledge of this man Holbrook . "
81655	81668	81377	81378	Mr. Saltram	2235	" What makes you suppose that I have any knowledge of him ? "
81669	81704	81248	81248	Gilbert	178	" The fact that he is a friend of Sir David Forster 's . The house in which I found Marian belongs to Sir David , and was lent by him to Mr. Holbrook . "
81705	81741	81377	81378	Mr. Saltram	2235	" I do not know every friend of Forster 's . He is a man who picks up his acquaintance in the highways and byways , and drops them when he is tired of them . "
81742	81761	81248	81248	Gilbert	178	" Will you tell me , on your honour , that you know nothing of this Mr. Holbrook ? "
81762	81765	81377	81378	Mr. Saltram	2235	" Certainly . "
81866	81870	81871	81871	he	178	" O Jack , "
81875	81906	81871	81871	he	178	" I could bear anything in this world better than the notion that you could betray me that you could break faith with me for the sake of another man . "
81907	81985	81871	81871	he	178	" I am not likely to do that . There is no man upon this earth I care for very much except you . I am not a man prone to friendship . In fact , I am a selfish worthless fellow at the best , Gilbert , and hardly merit your serious consideration . It would be wiser of you to think of me as I really am , and to think very little of me . "
81986	82010	81871	81871	he	178	" You did not show yourself remarkably selfish when you nursed me through that fever , at the hazard of your own life . "
82011	82095	81871	81871	he	178	" Pshaw ! that was nothing . I could not have done less in the position in which we two were . Such sacrifices as those count for very little . It is when a man 's own happiness is in the scale that the black spot shows itself . I tell you , Gilbert , I am not worth your friendship . It would be better for you to go your own way , and have nothing more to do with me . "
82142	82153	82154	82154	he	178	" I could not do without your friendship , Jack , "
82157	82175	82154	82154	he	178	" Remember how barren the world is to me now . I have nothing left but that . "
82176	82222	81871	81871	he	178	" A poor substitute for better things , Gilbert . I am never likely to be much good to you or to myself . By the way , have you seen anything lately of that old man you told me about Miss Nowell 's grandfather ? "
82223	82271	82154	82154	he	178	" I saw him the other night . He is very ill dying , I believe . I have written to Marian to tell her that if she does not come very quickly to see him , there is a chance of her not finding him alive . "
82272	82280	81871	81871	he	178	" And she will come of course . "
82281	82376	82154	82154	he	178	" I suppose so . She talked of waiting for her husband 's consent ; but she will scarcely do that when she knows her grandfather 's precarious state . I shall go to Queen Anne 's Court after I leave you , to ascertain if there has been any letter from her to announce her coming . She is a complete stranger in London , and may be embarrassed if she arrives at the station alone . But I should imagine her husband would meet her there supposing him to be in town . "
82574	82583	82584	82584	he	178	" You came to town alone , Marian ? "
82619	82685	82604	82604	his	1283	" Yes , I came alone . My husband had not come back , and I would not delay any longer after receiving your letter . I am very glad I came . My poor grandfather seemed so pleased to see me . He was wandering a little when I first came in , but brightened wonderfully afterwards , and quite understood who I was . "
82830	82836	82837	82837	he	1283	" Is that Mr. Fenton ? "
82840	83016	82837	82837	he	1283	" the room 's so dark , I ca n't see very well . She has come to me , you see . She 's a good girl . Her eyes are like my wife 's . Yes , she 's a good girl . It seems a hard thing that I should have lived all these years without knowing her ; lived alone , with no one about me but those that were on the watch for my money , and eager to cheat me at every turn . My life might have been happier if I 'd had a grandchild to keep me company , and I might have left this place and lived like a gentleman for her sake . But that 's all past and gone . You 'll be rich when I 'm dead , Marian ; yes , what most people would count rich . You wo n't squander the money , will you , my dear , as your father would , if it were left to him ? "
83017	83034	83035	83036	the girl	5090	" No , grandfather . But tell me about my father . Is he still living ? "
83040	83047	83049	83050	Jacob Nowell	173	" Never mind him , child , "
83052	83124	83049	83050	Jacob Nowell	173	" He has n't troubled himself about you , and you ca n't do better than keep clear of him . No good ever came of anything he did yet , and no good ever will come . Do n't you have anything to do with him , Marian . He 'll try to get all your money away from you , if you give him a chance depend upon that . "
83125	83170	83229	83230	The doctor	6141	" He is living , then ? O , my dear grandfather , do tell me something more about him . Remember that whatever his errors may have been , he is my father the only relation I have in the world except yourself . "
83171	83181	83183	83184	Jacob Nowell	173	" His whole life has been one long error , "
83186	83202	83183	83184	Jacob Nowell	173	" I tell you , child , the less you know of him the better . "
83456	83459	83412	83412	her	2273	" Robinson Crusoe "
84514	84519	84520	84520	he	1283	" Who 's that ? "
84532	84541	84542	84543	the widow	5832	" It 's only Mr. Tulliver , sir , "
84546	84558	84542	84543	the widow	5832	" He 's so anxious about you , poor young man . "
84559	84566	84568	84569	Jacob Nowell	173	" I do n't want him , "
84572	84589	84568	84569	Jacob Nowell	173	" I do n't want his anxiety ; I want to be alone with my granddaughter . "
84590	84599	84600	84601	Mr. Tulliver	243	" Do n't send me away , sir , "
84608	84630	84600	84601	Mr. Tulliver	243	" I do n't deserve to be sent away like a stranger , after serving you faithfully for the last ten years "
84631	84640	84642	84644	the old man	1283	" And being well paid for your services , "
84646	84663	84642	84644	the old man	1283	" I tell you I do n't want you . Go downstairs and mind the shop . "
84664	84673	84675	84676	Mr. Tulliver	243	" It 's not open yet , sir , "
84678	84721	84600	84601	Mr. Tulliver	243	" Then it ought to be . I 'll have no idling and shirking because I 'm ill . Go down and take down the shutters directly . Let the business go on just as if I was there to watch it . "
84722	84729	84731	84733	the young man	666	" I 'm going , sir , "
84735	84764	84731	84733	the young man	666	" but it does seem rather a poor return after having served you as I have , and loved you as if you 'd been my own father . "
84765	84939	84940	84942	The old man	1283	" Very much men love their fathers now - a - days ! I did n't ask you to love me , did I ? or hire you for that , or pay you for it ? Pshaw , man , I know you . You wanted my money like the rest of them , and I did n't mind your thinking there was a chance of your getting it . I 've rather encouraged the notion at odd times . It made you a better servant , and kept you honest . But now that I 'm dying , I can afford to tell the truth . This young lady will have all my money , every sixpence of it , except five - and - twenty pounds to Mrs. Mitchin yonder . And now you can go . You 'd have got something perhaps in a small way , if you 'd been less of a sneak and a listener ; but you 've played your cards a trifle too well . "
85005	85022	85023	85023	he	173	" You do n't know what a deep schemer that young man has been , Marian , "
85026	85039	85023	85023	he	173	" and how I have laughed in my sleeve at his manoeuvres . "
85424	85449	85450	85450	she	183	" If the end is so near as the doctor says , it would be cruel to leave my grandfather till all is over , "
85453	85471	85472	85472	Gilbert	178	" I wonder that your husband has not come to you , if he is in London , "
85495	85503	85504	85504	she	183	" He may not be in London , "
85515	85528	85504	85504	she	183	" I am quite sure that he will do whatever is best . "
85529	85584	85485	85485	her	183	" But if he should not come to you , and if your grandfather should die while you are alone here , I trust you will send for me and let me give you any help you may require . You can scarcely stay in this house after the poor old man 's death . "
85585	85625	85504	85504	she	183	" I shall go back to Hampshire immediately ; if I am not wanted here for anything to make arrangements for the funeral . O , how hard it seems to speak of that while he is still living ! "
85626	85655	85485	85485	her	183	" You need give yourself no trouble on that account . I will see to all that , if there is no more proper person to do so . "
85656	85676	85504	85504	she	183	" You are very good . I am anxious to go back to the Grange as quickly as possible . "
85776	85779	85781	85782	this gentleman	572	" Well , "
85792	85798	85781	85782	this gentleman	572	" how 's the governor ? "
85799	85810	85785	85785	his	572	" Very ill ; going fast , the doctor says . "
85811	85831	85781	85782	this gentleman	572	" Eh ? As bad as that ? Then there 's been a change since I was here last . "
85832	85879	85785	85785	his	572	" Yes ; Mr. Nowell was taken much worse yesterday morning . He had a kind of fit , I fancy , and could n't get his speech for some time afterwards . But he got over that , and has talked well enough since then , "
85894	85908	85910	85910	Percival	201	" I 'll step upstairs and have a look at the old gentleman , "
85912	85921	85922	85923	Mr. Tulliver	243	" There 's a young lady with him , "
85932	85937	85938	85939	the other	595	" A young lady ! "
85942	85947	85938	85939	the other	595	" What young lady ? "
85948	85952	85922	85923	Mr. Tulliver	243	" His granddaughter . "
85953	85956	85938	85939	the other	595	" Indeed ! "
85957	86024	86026	86027	Mr. Tulliver	243	" Yes ; she came up from the country yesterday evening , and she 's been sitting with him ever since . He seems to have taken to her very much . You 'd think she 'd been about him all her life ; and she 's to have all his money , he says . I wonder what his only son will say to that , "
86052	86052	86026	86027	Mr. Tulliver	243	"
86053	86056	86057	86058	the other	595	" Uncommonly , "
86104	86123	86124	86124	he	243	" I should like to see this young lady before I go up to Mr. Nowell 's room , "
86128	86142	86124	86124	he	243	" Will you step upstairs and ask her to come down to me ? "
86143	86163	86188	86189	Luke Tulliver	243	" I can go if you wish , but I do n't suppose she 'll leave the old gentleman . "
86164	86187	86124	86124	he	243	" Never mind what you suppose . Tell her that I wish to say a few words to her upon particular business . "
86270	86285	86286	86286	he	201	" To be cheated out of every sixpence by my own flesh and blood ! "
86291	86302	86286	86286	he	201	" That seems too much for any man to bear . "
86461	86475	86476	86476	she	183	" You wish to speak to me on business , I am told , "
86498	86514	86515	86515	he	201	" Yes , I have to speak to you on very serious business , Marian , "
86519	86537	86480	86480	her	183	" You are an utter stranger to me , and yet call me by my Christian name . "
86538	86563	86480	86480	her	183	" I am not an utter stranger to you . Look at me , Mrs. Holbrook . Have you never seen my face before ? "
86564	86567	86480	86480	her	183	" Never . "
86568	86585	86480	86480	her	183	" Are you quite sure of that ? Look a little longer before you answer again . "
86586	86589	86590	86590	she	1282	" Yes ! "
86599	86605	86590	86590	she	1282	" You are my father ! "
86839	86850	86851	86851	she	1282	" I was asking my grandfather about you this morning , "
86860	86871	86851	86851	she	1282	" but he would not tell me where you were . "
86872	87003	86851	86851	she	1282	" Indeed ! I am surprised to find you felt so much interest in me ; I 'm aware that I do n't deserve as much . Yet I could plead plenty of excuses for my life , if I cared to trouble you with them ; but I do n't . It would be a long story ; and when it was told , you might not believe it . Most men are , more or less , the slave of circumstances . I have suffered that kind of bondage all my life . I have known , too , that you were in good hands better off in every way than you could have been in my care or I should have acted differently in relation to you . "
87004	87015	87016	87016	Marian	183	" There is no occasion to speak of the past , "
87020	87074	86851	86851	she	1282	" Providence was very good to me ; but I know my poor mother 's last days were full of sorrow . I can not tell how far it might have been in your power to prevent that . It is not my place to blame , or even to question your conduct . "
87075	87083	86851	86851	she	1282	" You are an uncommonly dutiful daughter , "
87093	87138	87084	87085	Mr. Nowell	201	" I thought that you would have repudiated me altogether perhaps ; would have taken your tone from my father , who has grown pig - headed with old age , and can not forgive me for having had the aspirations of a gentleman . "
87139	87161	87162	87162	Marian	183	" It is a pity there should not be union between my grandfather and you at such a moment as this , "
87165	87222	87084	87085	Mr. Nowell	201	" O , we are civil enough to each other . I bear no malice against the old man , though many sons in my position might consider themselves hardly used . And now I may as well go upstairs and pay my respects . Why is not your husband with you , by the bye ? "
87223	87242	87301	87301	her	183	" He is not wanted here ; and I do not even know that he is in London . "
87243	87260	87084	87085	Mr. Nowell	201	" Humph ! He seems rather a mysterious sort of person , this husband of yours . "
87979	88003	87972	87972	He	1283	" Mr. Fenton , a gentleman I knew at Lidford in my dear uncle 's lifetime . My grandfather liked him very much . "
88004	88061	87972	87972	He	1283	" Mr. Fenton ! Yes , my father told me all about him . You were engaged to him , and jilted him for this man you have married very foolishly , as it seems to me ; for he could certainly have given you a better position than that which you appear to occupy now . "
88062	88070	88071	88071	Marian	183	" I chose for my own happiness , "
88075	88147	88071	88071	Marian	183	" and I have only one subject for regret ; that is , that I was compelled to act with ingratitude towards a good man . But Mr. Fenton has forgiven me ; has promised to be my friend , if ever I should have need of his friendship . He has very kindly offered to take all trouble off my hands with respect to to the arrangements for the funeral . "
88148	88154	88156	88157	Percival Nowell	201	" He is remarkably obliging , "
88162	88184	88156	88157	Percival Nowell	201	" but as the only son of the deceased , I consider myself the proper person to perform that final duty . "
88185	88223	87972	87972	He	1283	" I do not wish to interfere with your doing so . Of course I did not know how near at hand you were when Mr. Fenton made that offer , or I should have told him . "
88224	88238	88156	88157	Percival Nowell	201	" You mean to remain until the funeral is over , I suppose ? "
88239	88297	87972	87972	He	1283	" I think not ; I want to go back to Hampshire as soon as possible by an early train to - morrow morning , if I can . I do not see that there is any reason for my remaining . I could not prove my respect or affection for my grandfather any more by staying . "
88298	88302	88156	88157	Percival Nowell	201	" Certainly not , "
88308	88329	88156	88157	Percival Nowell	201	" I think you will be quite right in getting away from this dingy hole as quick as you can . "
88330	88351	88156	88157	Percival Nowell	201	" It is not for that . But I have promised to return directly I was free to do so . "
88352	88366	88156	88157	Percival Nowell	201	" And you go back to Hampshire ? To what part of Hampshire ? "
88416	88433	88434	88434	he	463	" I may have to write to you , or to come to you , perhaps , "
88437	88449	88434	88434	he	463	" It 's as well to be prepared for the contingency . "
88458	88462	88434	88434	he	463	" Railway Guide , "
88778	88784	88785	88785	he	201	" How pious she is ! "
88794	88868	88785	88785	he	201	" Did the half - pay Captain teach her that , I wonder ? or does church - going , and psalm - singing , and Bible - reading come natural to all women ? I know my mother was good at it , and my wife too . She used to fly to her Bible as a man flies to dram - drinking , or his pipe , when things go wrong . "
88939	88948	88949	88950	Mr. Nowell	201	" You 're an uncommonly cautious young man , "
88955	88992	88949	88950	Mr. Nowell	201	" You 'll never stand in your own light by being too anxious to oblige other people . I daresay , though , you could speak fast enough , if it was made worth your while . "
88993	89007	89008	89009	Luke Tulliver	243	" I do n't see what is to make it worth my while , "
89013	89133	89008	89009	Luke Tulliver	243	" My duty is to my dead master , and those that are to come after him . I do n't want strangers coming sniffing and prying into the stock . Mr. Nowell 's books were kept so that I could n't cheat him out of a sixpence , or the value of a sixpence ; and I mean to hand 'em over to the lawyer in a manner that will do me credit . My master has not been a generous master to me , considering how I 've served him , and I 've got nothing but my character to look to ; but that I have got , and I do n't want it tampered with . "
89134	89143	89145	89146	Mr. Nowell	201	" Who is going to tamper with it ? "
89148	89199	89145	89146	Mr. Nowell	201	" So you 'll hand over the stock - books to the lawyer , will you , without a leaf missing , or an erasure , or an item marked off as sold that never was sold , or any little dodges of that kind , eh , Mr. Tulliver ? "
89200	89204	89206	89207	the shopman	1450	" Of course , "
89237	89277	89008	89009	Luke Tulliver	243	" Then you are a very remarkable man . I should have thought such a chance as a death as unexpected as my as old Mr. Nowell 's would have made the fortune of a confidential clerk like you . "
89278	89285	89287	89288	Mr. Tulliver	243	" I 'm not a thief , "
89296	89408	89287	89288	Mr. Tulliver	243	" and you ca n't know much about old Jacob Nowell if you think that anybody could cheat him , living or dead . There 's not an entry in the book that is n't signed with his initials , in his own hand . When a thing was sold and crossed off the book , he put his initials to the entry of the sale . He went through the books every night till a week ago , and he 'd as soon have cut his own head off as omit to do it , so long as he could see the figures in the book or hold his pen . "
89645	89657	89658	89658	he	201	" I suppose you know all about your grandfather 's will ? "
89732	89735	89736	89736	she	183	" Yes , "
89739	89784	89736	89736	she	183	" my grandfather told me that he had left all his money to me . I know that must seem unjust to you , papa ; but I hope my husband will allow me to do something towards repairing that injustice in some measure . "
89785	89790	89791	89792	Mr. Nowell	201	" In some measure ! "
89796	89826	89791	89792	Mr. Nowell	201	" That means a pittance that would serve to keep life in a pauper , I suppose ; and that is to be contingent upon her husband 's permission . "
90003	90026	90027	90027	Marian	183	" How could I expect that he would care for me in the smallest degree , after his desertion of my mother ? "
90391	90401	90402	90403	Mr. Nowell	201	" And what has he done with the books ? "
90406	90425	90402	90403	Mr. Nowell	201	" They 're all in the desk yonder , and that fellow Medler has taken away the keys . "
90426	90430	90432	90433	Mr. Nowell	201	" Sharp practice , "
90435	90461	90432	90433	Mr. Nowell	201	" but to a man with your purity of intention it ca n't matter what precautions are taken to insure the safety of the property . "
90462	90470	90471	90472	the other	595	" Of course it do n't matter , "
90476	90487	90471	90472	the other	595	" but I like to be treated as a gentleman . "
90488	90510	90402	90403	Mr. Nowell	201	" Humph ! And you expect to retain your place here , I suppose , if the business is carried on ? "
90511	90523	90525	90526	Mr. Tulliver	243	" It 's too good a business to be let drop , "
90528	90670	90525	90526	Mr. Tulliver	243	" but I should n't think that young lady upstairs would be much of a hand at trade . I would n't mind offering a fair price for the business , I 've got a tidy little bit of money put away , though my salary has been small enough , goodness knows ; but I 've lived with the old gentleman , and never wasted a penny upon pleasure ; none of your music - halls , or dancing - saloons , or anything of that kind , for me , or I would n't mind paying an annual sum out of the profits of the trade for a reasonable term . If you 've any influence with the young lady , perhaps you could put it to her , and get her to look at things in that light , "
90696	90707	90708	90709	Mr. Nowell	201	" I 'll do my best for you , Tulliver , "
90717	90736	90708	90709	Mr. Nowell	201	" I daresay the young lady will be quite willing to entertain any reasonable proposition you may make . "
91380	91384	91353	91353	her	282	" the girl . "
91726	91746	91747	91747	he	178	" I was a fool to think that I could ever be anything to her , even a friend , "
91753	91874	91747	91747	he	178	" women are incapable of friendship . It is all or nothing with them ; a blind self - abnegation or the coldest indifference . Devotion can not touch them , unless the man who gives it happen to be that one man out of a thousand who has the power to bewitch their senses . Truth and affection , of themselves , have no value with them . How many people spoke to me of this Holbrook as an unattractive man ; and yet he won my love away from me , and holds her with an influence so complete , that my friendship seems worthless to her . She can not give me a word or a thought . "
92095	92112	92113	92113	he	178	" I know how ignorant Mrs. Holbrook is of the world and of all business matters , "
92119	92132	92113	92113	he	178	" and I am naturally anxious that her interests should be protected . "
92133	92150	92151	92152	the lawyer	5706	" I should think there was very little doubt that her husband will see after those , "
92161	92178	92151	92152	the lawyer	5706	" husbands are generally supposed to do that , especially where there is money at stake . "
92179	92267	92113	92113	he	178	" I do not know Mr. Holbrook ; and he has kept himself in the background so persistently up to this point , and has been altogether so underhanded in his proceedings , that I have by no means a good opinion of him . Mr. Nowell told me that he intended to leave his money to his granddaughter in such a manner , that it would be hers and hers only free from the control of any husband . He has done so , I presume ? "
92268	92271	92151	92152	the lawyer	5706	" Yes , "
92290	92303	92272	92273	Mr. Medler	276	" he has left it for her own separate use and maintenance . "
92304	92317	92151	92152	the lawyer	5706	" And it is a property of some importance , I conclude ? "
92318	92324	92325	92326	the lawyer	5706	" Of some importance yes , "
92334	92350	92151	92152	the lawyer	5706	" Ought not Mrs. Holbrook to have remained to hear the reading of the will ? "
92351	92400	92151	92152	the lawyer	5706	" Well , yes , decidedly ; it would have been more in the usual way of things ; but her absence can have no ill effect upon her interests . Of course it will be my duty to make her acquainted with the contents of the will . "
92473	92491	92492	92492	Gilbert	178	" There is no one except Mrs. Holbrook interested in Mr. Nowell 's will , I suppose ? "
92496	92520	92492	92492	Gilbert	178	" No one directly and immediately , except an old charwoman , who has a legacy of five - and - twenty pounds . "
92521	92539	92492	92492	Gilbert	178	" But there is some one else interested in an indirect manner I infer from your words ? "
92540	92599	92492	92492	Gilbert	178	" Yes . Mrs. Holbrook takes the whole of the personalty , but she has only a life - interest in the real estate . If she should have children , it will go to them on her death ; if she should die childless , it will go to her father , supposing him to survive her . "
92600	92614	92492	92492	Gilbert	178	" To her father ? That is rather strange , is n't it ? "
92615	92638	92492	92492	Gilbert	178	" I do n't know that . It was the old man 's wish that the will should be to that effect . "
92639	92657	92492	92492	Gilbert	178	" I understood from him that he did not know whether his son was alive or dead . "
92658	92672	92492	92492	Gilbert	178	" Indeed ! I believe he had news of his son very lately . "
92673	92696	92492	92492	Gilbert	178	" Curious that he should not have told me , knowing as he did my interest in everything relating to Mrs. Holbrook . "
92697	92721	92723	92724	the lawyer	5706	" Old people are apt to be close ; and Jacob Nowell was about one of the closest customers I ever met with , "
93174	93185	93186	93186	she	181	" It was very different when Marian Nowell was here , "
93189	93201	93186	93186	she	181	" you thought it no trouble to come to us then . "
94462	94475	94476	94476	he	1108	" I 'm uncommonly glad to see you , my dear Fenton , "
94479	94611	94476	94476	he	1108	" Indeed , I have been pleased to see worse fellows than you lately , since this infernal gout has laid me up in this dreary old place . The house is pretty full now , I am happy to say . I have friends who will come to shoot my partridges , though they wo n't remember my solitude in a charitable spirit before the first of September . You 'll stop and dine , I hope ; or perhaps you can put up here altogether for a week or so . My housekeeper shall find you a good room ; and I can promise you pleasant company . Say yes , now , like a good fellow , and I 'll send a man to Lidford for your traps . "
94612	94747	94430	94431	the servant	5313	" Thanks no . You are very kind ; but I am staying with my sister for a few days , and must return to town before the end of the week . The fact of the matter is , Sir David , I have come here to - day to ask you for some explanation of your conduct at our last interview . I do n't want to say anything rude or disagreeable ; for I am quite willing to believe that you felt kindly towards me , even at the time when you deceived me . I suppose there are some positions in which a man can hardly expect fair play , and that mine was such a position . But you certainly did deceive me , Sir David , and grossly . "
94748	94768	94476	94476	he	1108	" That last is rather an unpleasant word , Mr. Fenton . In what respect did I deceive you ? "
94769	94806	94430	94431	the servant	5313	" I came here on purpose to ask you if Mr. Holbrook , the man who robbed me of my promised wife , were a friend of yours , and you denied all knowledge of him . "
94807	94818	94476	94476	he	1108	" Granted . And what then , my dear sir ? "
94819	94946	94430	94431	the servant	5313	" When I came to ask you that question , I had no special reason for supposing this Mr. Holbrook was known to you . It only struck me that , being a stranger in the village , as the result of my inquiries had proved to me , he might be one of your many visitors . I knew at that time that Mr. Holbrook had taken his wife to a farm - house in Hampshire immediately after their marriage a house lent to him by a friend ; but I did not know that you had any estate in that county . I have been to Hampshire since then , and have found Mrs. Holbrook at the Grange , near Crosber in your house . "
94947	95072	94476	94476	he	1108	" You have found her ! Well , Mr. Fenton , the circumstantial evidence is too strong for me , so I must plead guilty . Yes ; I did deceive you when I told you that Holbrook was unknown to me ; but I pledged my word to keep his secret to give you no clue , should you ever happen to question me , that could lead to your discovery of your lost love 's whereabouts . It was considered , I conclude , that any meeting between you two must needs result unpleasantly . At any rate , there was a strong desire to avoid you ; and in common duty to my friend I was compelled to respect that desire . "
95073	95087	95089	95089	Gilbert	178	" Not a very manly wish on the part of my successful rival , "
95091	95106	94476	94476	he	1108	" It may have been the lady 's wish rather than Mr. Holbrook 's . "
95107	95159	94476	94476	he	1108	" I have reason to know that it was otherwise . I have heard from Marian 's own lips that she would have written a candid confession of the truth had she been free to do so . It was her husband who prevented her giving me notice of my desertion . "
95160	95170	95171	95172	Sir David	209	" I can not pretend to explain his conduct , "
95176	95204	95171	95172	Sir David	209	" I only know that I pledged myself to keep his secret ; and felt bound to do so , even at the cost of a lie . "
95205	95279	94476	94476	he	1108	" And this man is your friend . You must know whether he is worthy to be Marian Nowell 's husband . The circumstances of her life do not seem to me favourable to happiness , so far as I have been able to discover them ; nor did I think her looking happy when we met . But I should be glad to know that she has not fallen into bad hands . "
95280	95314	95171	95172	Sir David	209	" And I suppose by this time your feelings have cooled down a little . You have abandoned those revengeful intentions you appeared to entertain , when you were last in this house ? "
95315	95389	94476	94476	he	1108	" In a great measure , yes . I have promised Marian that , should I and her husband meet , as we must do , I believe , sooner or later , she need apprehend no violence on my part . He has won the prize ; any open resentment would seem mere schoolboy folly . But you can not suppose that I feel very kindly towards him , or ever shall . "
95390	95410	95171	95172	Sir David	209	" Upon my soul , I think men are hardly responsible for their actions where a woman is concerned , "
95418	95601	95171	95172	Sir David	209	" We are the veriest slaves of destiny in these matters . A man sees the only woman in the world he can love too late to win her with honour . If he is strong enough to act nobly , he turns his back upon the scene of his temptation , all the more easily should the lady happen to be staunch to her affianced , or her husband , as the case may be . But if she waver if he sees that his love is returned heaven help him ! Honour , generosity , friendship , all go by the board ; and for the light in those fatal eyes , for the dangerous music of that one dear voice , he sacrifices all that he has held highest in life until that luckless time . I know that Holbrook held it no light thing to do you this wrong ; I know that he fought manfully against temptation . But , you see , fate was the stronger ; and he had to give way at the last . "
95602	95729	94476	94476	he	1108	" I can not agree with that way of looking at things , Sir David . The world is made up of people who take their own pleasure at any cost to others , and then throw the onus of their misdoings upon Providence . I have long ago forgiven the girl who jilted me , and have sworn to be her faithful and watchful friend in all the days to come . I want to be sure that her future is a bright one much brighter than it seemed when I saw her in your lonely old house near Crosber . She has had money left her since then ; so poverty can no longer be a reason for her being hidden from the world . "
95730	95747	95171	95172	Sir David	209	" I am very glad to hear that ; my friend is not a rich man . "
95748	95801	94476	94476	he	1108	" So Marian told me . But I want to learn something more than that about him . Up to this moment he has been the most intangible being I ever heard of . Will you tell me who and what he is his position in the world , and so on ? "
95802	95805	95807	95808	Sir David	209	" Humph ! "
95811	96125	95807	95808	Sir David	209	" I do n't know that I can tell you much about him . His position is like that of a good many others of my acquaintance rather vague and intangible , to use the word you employed just now . He is not well off ; he is a gentleman by birth , with some small means of his own , and he ' lives , sir , lives . ' That is about all I can say of him from a worldly point of view . With regard to his affection for Miss Nowell , I know that he loved her passionately , devotedly , desperately the strongest expression you can supply to describe a man 's folly . I never saw any fellow so far gone . Heaven knows , I did my best to argue him out of his fancy urged your claim , the girl 's poverty , every reason against the marriage ; but friendly argumentation of that kind goes very little way in such a case . He took his own course . It was only when I found the business was decided upon , that I offered him my house in Hampshire ; a place to which I never go myself , but which brings me in a decent income in the hands of a clever bailiff . I knew that Holbrook had no home ready for his wife , and I thought it would give them a pleasant retreat enough for a few months , while the honey and rose - leaves still sweetened the wine - cup of their wedded life . They have stayed there ever since , as you seem to know ; so I conclude they have found the place agreeable . Confoundedly dreary , I should fancy it myself ; but then I 'm not a newly married man . "
96395	96407	96408	96408	he	1108	" And you can tell me nothing more about Mr. Holbrook ? "
96414	96587	96988	96989	the Baronet	1108	" Upon my honour , nothing . I think you will do wisely to leave these two people to take their own way in the future without any interference on your part . You speak of watchful friendship and all that kind of thing , and I can quite appreciate your disinterested desire to befriend the woman whom you once hoped to make your wife . But , believe me , my dear Fenton , no manner of good can possibly come of your intervention . Those two have chosen their road in life , and must travel along it , side by side , through good or evil fortune . Holbrook would naturally be jealous of any friendship between his wife and you ; while such a friendship could not fail to keep alive bitter thoughts in your mind could not fail to sharpen the regret which you fancy just now is to be life - long . I have no doubt I seem to speak in a hard worldly spirit . "
96588	96601	96602	96603	the other	595	" You speak like a man of the world , Sir David , "
96607	96765	96602	96603	the other	595	" and I can not deny that there is a certain amount of wisdom in your advice . No , my friendship is not wanted by either of those two , supposing even that I were generous enough to be able to give it to both . I have learnt that lesson already from Marian herself . But you must remember that I promised her poor old grandfather the man who died a few days ago that I would watch over her interests with patient fidelity , that I would be her friend and protector , if ever the hour should come in which she would need friendship and protection . I am not going to forget this promise , or to neglect its performance ; and in order to be true to my word , I am bound to make myself acquainted with the circumstances of her married life , and the character of her husband . "
96766	96779	96988	96989	the Baronet	1108	" Can not you be satisfied with knowing that she is happy ? "
96780	96799	96602	96603	the other	595	" I have seen her , Sir David , and am by no means assured of her happiness . "
96800	96825	96988	96989	the Baronet	1108	" And yet it was a love - match on both sides . Holbrook , as I have told you , loved her passionately . "
96826	96872	96602	96603	the other	595	" That passionate kind of love is apt to wear itself out very quickly with some men . Your bailiff 's daughter complained bitterly of Mr. Holbrook 's frequent absence from the Grange , of the dulness and loneliness of my poor girl 's life . "
96873	96881	96882	96883	Sir David	209	" Women are apt to be exacting , "
96893	96951	96882	96883	Sir David	209	" My friend Holbrook has the battle of life to fight , and could not spend all his days playing the lover . If his wife has had money left her , that will make some difference in their position . A man is never at his best when he is worried by debts and financial difficulties . "
96952	96966	96882	96883	Sir David	209	" And Mr. Holbrook was in debt when he married , I suppose ? "
96967	96987	96988	96989	the Baronet	1108	" He was . I must confess that I find that complaint a very common one among my acquaintance , "
96995	97031	96602	96603	the other	595	" Will you tell me what this Holbrook is like in person , Sir David ? I have questioned several people about him , and have never obtained anything beyond the vaguest kind of description . "
97041	97156	96988	96989	the Baronet	1108	" What ! you want to know whether your rival is handsome , I suppose ? like a woman , who always commences her inquiries about another woman by asking whether she is pretty . My dear Fenton , all personal descriptions are vague . It is almost impossible to furnish a correct catalogue of any man 's features . Holbrook is just one of those men whom it is most difficult to describe not particularly good - looking , nor especially ill - looking ; very clever , and with plenty of expression and character in his face . Older than you by some years , and looking older than he really is . "
97157	97181	97286	97287	Sir David	209	" Thanks ; but there is not one precise statement in your description . Is the man dark or fair short or tall ? "
97182	97193	96988	96989	the Baronet	1108	" Rather dark than fair ; rather tall than short . "
97194	97202	97203	97203	Gilbert	178	" That will do , Sir David , "
97221	97285	97203	97203	Gilbert	178	" The man who robbed me of my promised wife is the man whom I introduced to her ; the man who has come between me and all my hopes , who hides himself from my just anger , and skulks in the background under a feigned name , is the one friend whom I have loved above all other men John Saltram ! "
97329	97347	97348	97349	Sir David	209	" In heaven 's name , what can have put such a preposterous notion into your head ? "
97353	97474	97348	97349	Sir David	209	" I can not tell you . The conviction has grown upon me , against my own will . Yes , I have hated myself for being able to suspect my friend . You do not know how I have loved that man , or how our friendship began at Oxford long ago with something like hero - worship on my side . I thought that he was born to be great and noble ; and heaven knows I have felt the disappointments and shortcomings of his career more keenly than he has felt them himself . No , Sir David , I do n't think it is possible for any man to comprehend how I have loved John Saltram . "
97475	97493	97348	97349	Sir David	209	" And yet , without a shred of evidence , you believe him guilty of betraying you . "
97494	97518	97348	97349	Sir David	209	" Will you give me your word of honour that Marian 's husband and John Saltram are not one and the same person ? "
97519	97522	97524	97525	Sir David	209	" No , "
97528	97641	97524	97525	Sir David	209	" I am tired of the whole business . You have questioned and cross - questioned me quite long enough , Mr. Fenton , and I have answered you to the best of my ability , and have given you rational advice , which you will of course decline to take . If you think your friend has wronged you , go to him , and tax him with that wrong . I wash my hands of the affair altogether , from this moment ; but , without wishing to be offensive , I can not help telling you , that to my mind you are acting very foolishly in this business . "
97642	97724	97725	97725	He	2632	" I daresay it may seem so to you . You would think better of me if I could play the stoic , and say , ' She has jilted me , and is dead to me henceforward . ' But I can not do that . I have the memory of her peaceful girlhood the happy days in which I knew her first the generous protector who sheltered her life . I am pledged to the dead , Sir David . "
98930	98955	98959	98959	himself	178	" How that poor little Anglo - Indian widow loves him , without any effort to win or hold her affection on his side ! "
98985	99193	98962	98962	he	178	" and can I doubt his power to supersede me if he cared to do so if he really loved Marian , as he never has loved Mrs. Branston ? What shall I do ? Go to him at once , and tell him my suspicion , tax him broadly with treachery , and force him to a direct confession or denial ? Shall I do this ? Or shall I bide my time , wait and watch with dull dogged patience , till I can collect some evidence of his guilt ? Yes , let it be so . If he has been base enough to do me this great wrong mean enough to steal my betrothed under a false name , and to keep the secret of his wrong - doing at any cost of lies and deceit let him go on to the end , let him act out the play to the last ; and when I bring his falsehood home to him , as I must surely do , sooner or later , yes , if he is capable of deceiving me , he shall continue the lie to the last , he shall endure all the infamy of his false position . "
99206	99284	99201	99201	he	2673	" And at the end , if my suspicions are confirmed , I shall have lost all I have ever valued in life since my mother died my plighted wife , and the one chosen friend whose companionship could make existence pleasant to me . God grant that this fancy of mine is as baseless as Sir David Forster declared it to be ! God grant that I may never find a secret enemy in John Saltram ! "
99501	99507	99508	99508	she	181	" Sit down , Gilbert , "
99528	99571	99512	99513	her brother	390	" I want to talk to you seriously , as a sister ought to talk to a brother , without any fear of offending . I 'm very sorry to see you have not yet forgotten that wicked ungrateful girl Marian Nowell . "
99572	99583	99508	99508	she	181	" Who told you that I have not forgotten her ? "
99584	99653	99512	99513	her brother	390	" Your own face , Gilbert . It 's no use for you to put on a pretence of being cheerful and light - hearted with me . I know you too well to be deceived by that kind of thing I could see how absent - minded you were all dinner - time , in spite of your talk . You ca n't hoodwink an affectionate sister . "
99654	99666	99508	99508	she	181	" I do n't wish to hoodwink you , my dear , "
99672	99791	99667	99668	Mr. Fenton	178	" or to affect a happiness which I do not feel , any more than I wish to make a parade of my grief . It is natural for an Englishman to be reticent on such matters ; but I do not mind owning to you that Marian Nowell is unforgotten by me , and that the loss of her will have an enduring influence upon my life ; and having said as much as that , Belle , I must request that you will not expatiate any more upon this poor girl 's breach of faith . I have forgiven her long ago , and I shall always regard her as the purest and dearest of women . "
99792	99846	99508	99508	she	181	" What ! you can hold her up as a paragon of perfection after she has thrown you over in the most heartless manner ? Upon my word , Gilbert , I have no common patience with such folly . Your weakness in this affair from first to last has been positively deplorable . "
99847	99883	99667	99668	Mr. Fenton	178	" I am sorry you disapprove of my conduct , Belle ; but as it is not a very pleasant subject , do n't you think we may as well avoid it now and henceforward ? "
99884	99892	99893	99894	the lady	389	" O , very well , Gilbert , "
99902	99946	99893	99894	the lady	389	" of course , if you choose to exclude me from your confidence , I must submit ; but I do think it rather hard that your only sister should not be allowed to speak of a business that concerns you so nearly . "
99947	99987	99667	99668	Mr. Fenton	178	" What good can arise out of any discussion of this subject , Belle ? You think me weak and foolish ; granted that I am both , you can not cure me of my weakness or my folly . "
99988	100012	99893	99894	the lady	389	" And am I never to hope that you will find some one else , better worthy of your regard than Marian Nowell ? "
100013	100028	99667	99668	Mr. Fenton	178	" I fear not , Belle . For me there is no one else . "
100587	100599	100600	100600	he	243	" O , it 's you , is it , sir ? "
100611	100621	100600	100600	he	243	" What can I do for you this evening ? "
100622	100635	100636	100636	Gilbert	178	" Is your late master 's granddaughter , Mrs. Holbrook , here ? "
100639	100665	100575	100575	his	243	" No ; Mrs. Holbrook went away on the morning after my master 's death . I told you that when you called here last . "
100666	100705	100575	100575	his	243	" I am quite aware of that ; but I thought it likely Mrs. Holbrook might return here with her husband , to take possession of the property , which I suppose you know now belongs to her . "
100706	100822	100575	100575	his	243	" Yes , I know all about that ; but she has n't come yet to take possession ; she does n't seem in such a desperate hurry about it . I daresay she knows that things are safe enough . Medler the lawyer is not the kind of party to be cheated out of sixpence . He has taken an inventory of every article in the place , and the weight and value of every article . Your friend Mrs. Holbrook need n't be afraid . I suppose she 's some relation of yours , by - the - bye , sir , judging by the interest you seem to take in her affairs ? "
100823	100826	100827	100827	Gilbert	178	" Yes , "
100838	100870	100827	100827	Gilbert	178	" I do take a warm interest in Mrs. Holbrook 's affairs , and I am very anxious to see her placed in undisputed possession of her late grandfather 's property . "
100871	100882	100883	100884	Mr. Tulliver	243	" I should think her husband would see after that , "
101512	101526	101527	101527	Gilbert	178	" I must ask you to excuse this untimely call , Mr. Medler , "
101531	101642	101527	101527	Gilbert	178	" but the fact of the matter is , I am a little anxious about my friend Mrs. Holbrook and her affairs , and I thought you the most likely person to give me some information about them . I should have called in business hours ; but I have only just returned from the country , and did not care to delay my inquiries until to - morrow . I have just come from Queen Anne 's Court , and am rather surprised to find that neither Mrs. Holbrook nor her husband has been there . You have seen or heard from them since the funeral , I suppose ? "
101643	101684	101790	101791	the lawyer	5706	" No , Mr. Fenton , I have neither seen nor heard of them . I wrote a formal letter to Mrs. Holbrook , setting out the contents of the will ; but there has been no answer as yet . "
101685	101692	101693	101693	Gilbert	178	" Strange , is it not ? "
101701	101745	101790	101791	the lawyer	5706	" Well , yes , it is certainly not the usual course of proceeding . However , there is time enough yet . The funeral has not been over much more than a week . The property is perfectly safe , you know . "
101746	101784	101790	101791	the lawyer	5706	" Of course ; but it is not the less extraordinary that Mr. Holbrook should hang back in this manner . I will go down to Hampshire the first thing to - morrow and see Mrs. Holbrook . "
101785	101788	101790	101791	the lawyer	5706	" Humph ! "
101793	101813	101790	101791	the lawyer	5706	" I ca n't say that I see any necessity for that . But of course you know best . "
102211	102226	102227	102227	he	178	" What am I , that I should measure the force of his temptation , "
102232	102304	102227	102227	he	178	" or the strength of his resistance ? Let me be sure that he loves my darling as truly as I love her , that the chief object of his life has been and will be her happiness , and then let me put away all selfish vindictive thoughts , and fall quietly into the background of my dear one 's life , content to be her brother and her friend . "
102363	102383	102384	102384	she	2766	" My young missus said I was to be sure and let her know if you came , sir , "
102396	102396	102384	102384	she	2766	"
102397	102408	102384	102384	she	2766	" Your young mistress ; do you mean Mrs. Holbrook ? "
102409	102421	102384	102384	she	2766	" No , sir ; Miss Carley , master 's daughter . "
102422	102467	102384	102384	she	2766	" Indeed ! I remember the young lady ; I shall be very happy to see her if she has anything to say to me ; but it is Mrs. Holbrook I have come to see . She is at home , I suppose ? "
102468	102504	102384	102384	she	2766	" O dear no , sir ; Mrs. Holbrook has left , without a word of notice , gone nobody knows where . That is what has made our young missus fret about it so . "
102505	102511	102512	102512	Gilbert	178	" Mrs. Holbrook has left ! "
102518	102521	102512	102512	Gilbert	178	" when ? "
102522	102534	102512	102512	Gilbert	178	" It 's more than a week ago now , sir . "
102535	102553	102512	102512	Gilbert	178	" And do none of you know why she went away , or where she has gone ? "
102554	102582	102512	102512	Gilbert	178	" No more than the dead , sir . But you 'd better see Miss Carley ; she 'll be able to tell you all about it . "
102799	102813	102814	102814	Gilbert	178	" For heaven 's sake tell me what this means , Miss Carley , "
102818	102843	102814	102814	Gilbert	178	" Your servant tells me that Mrs. Holbrook has left you in some mysterious way , I imagine , from what the woman said . "
102844	102896	102779	102779	She	176	" O , sir , I am so glad you have come here ; I should have written to you if I had known where to address a letter . Yes , sir , she has gone that dear sweet young creature and I fear some harm has come to her . "
102912	102919	102920	102920	Gilbert	178	" Pray , pray be calm , "
102924	102955	102920	102920	Gilbert	178	" and tell me all you can about this business . How did Mrs. Holbrook leave this place ? and why do you suspect that any harm has befallen her ? "
102956	103024	102779	102779	She	176	" There is every reason to think so , sir . Is it like her to leave us without a word of notice , knowing , as she must have known , the unhappiness she would cause to me , who love her so well , by such a step ? She knew how I loved her . I think she had scarcely a secret from me . "
103025	103038	103039	103039	Gilbert	178	" If you will only tell me the manner of her departure , "
103044	104141	102779	102779	She	176	" Yes , yes , sir ; I am coming to that directly . She seemed happier after she came back from London , poor dear ; and she told me that her grandfather had left her money , and that she was likely to become quite a rich woman . The thought of this gave her so much pleasure not for her own sake , but for her husband 's , whose cares and difficulties would all come to an end now , she told me . She had been back only a few days , when I left home for a day and a night , to see my aunt an old woman and a constant invalid , who lives at Malsham . I had put off going to her for a long time , for I did n't care about leaving Mrs. Holbrook ; but I had to go at last , my aunt thinking it hard that I could n't spare time to spend a day with her , and tidy up her house a bit , and see to the girl that waits upon her , poor helpless thing . So I started off before noon one day , after telling Mrs. Holbrook where I was going , and when I hoped to be back . She was in very good spirits that morning , for she expected her husband next day . ' I have told him nothing about the good fortune that has come to me , Nelly , ' she said ; ' I have only written to him , begging him to return as quickly as possible , and he will be here to - morrow by the afternoon express . ' Mr. Holbrook is a great walker , and generally walks from Malsham here , by a shorter way than the high - road , across some fields and by the river - bank . His wife used always to go part of the way to meet him when she knew he was coming . I know she meant to go and meet him this time . The way is very lonely , and I have often felt fidgety about her going alone , but she had n't a bit of fear ; and I did n't like to offer to go with her , feeling sure that Mr. Holbrook would be vexed by seeing me at such a time . Well , sir , I had arranged everything comfortably , so that she should miss nothing by my being away , and I bade her good - bye , and started off to walk to Malsham . I ca n't tell you how hard it seemed to me to leave her , for it was the first time we had been parted for so much as a day since she came to the Grange . I thought of her all the while I was at my aunt 's ; who has very fidgety ways , poor old lady , and is n't a pleasant person to be with . I felt quite in a fever of impatience to get home again ; and was very glad when a neighbour 's spring - cart dropped me at the end of the lane , and I saw the gray old chimneys above the tops of the trees . It was four o'clock in the afternoon when I got home ; father was at tea in the oak - parlour where we take our meals , and the house was as quiet as a grave . I came straight to this room , but it was empty ; and when I called Martha , she told me Mrs. Holbrook had gone out at one o'clock in the day , and had not been home since , though she was expected back to dinner at three . She had been away three hours then , and at a time when I knew she could not expect Mr. Holbrook , unless she had received a fresh letter from him to say that he was coming by an earlier train than usual . I asked Martha if there had been any letters for Mrs. Holbrook that day ; and she told me yes , there had been one by the morning post . It was no use asking Martha what kind of letter it looked , and whether it was from Mr. Holbrook , for the poor ignorant creature can neither read nor write , and one handwriting is the same as another to her . Mrs. Holbrook had told her nothing as to where she was going , only saying that she would be back in an hour or two . Martha let her out at the gate , and watched her take the way towards the river - bank , and , seeing this , made sure she was going to meet her husband . Well , sir , five o'clock struck , and Mrs. Holbrook had not come home . I began to feel seriously uneasy about her . I told my father so ; but he took the matter lightly enough at first , saying it was no business of ours , and that Mrs. Holbrook was just as well able to take care of herself as any one else . But after five o'clock I could n't rest a minute longer ; so I put on my bonnet and shawl and went down by the river - bank , after sending one of the farm - labourers to look for my poor dear in the opposite direction . It 's a very lonely walk at the best of times , though a few of the country folks do go that way between Malsham and Crosber on market - days . There 's scarcely a house to be seen for miles , except Wyncomb Farmhouse , Stephen Whitelaw 's place , which lies a little way back from the river - bank , about a mile from here ; besides that and a solitary cottage here and there , you wo n't see a sign of human life for four or five miles . Anybody might be pushed into the river and made away with in broad daylight , and no one need be the wiser . The loneliness of the place struck me with an awful fear that afternoon , and from that moment I began to think that I should never see Mrs. Holbrook again . "
104142	104159	105164	105165	Ellen Carley	176	" What of her husband ? He was expected on this particular afternoon , you say ? "
104160	104530	102779	102779	She	176	" He was , sir ; but he did not come till the next day . It was almost dark when I went to the river - bank . I walked for about three miles and a half , to a gate that opened into the fields by which Mr. Holbrook came across from Malsham . I knew his wife never went farther than this gate , but used to wait for him here , if she happened to be the first to reach it . I hurried along , half running all the way , and calling aloud to Mrs. Holbrook every now and then with all my might . But there was no answer . Some men in a boat loaded with hay stopped to ask me what was the matter , but they could tell me nothing . They were coming from Malsham , and had seen no one along the bank . I called at Mr. Whitelaw 's as I came back , not with much hope that I should hear anything ; but what could I do but make inquiries anywhere and everywhere ? I was almost wild with fright by this time . They could tell me nothing at Wyncomb Farm . Stephen Whitelaw was alone in the kitchen smoking his pipe by a great fire . He had n't been out all day , he told me , and none of his people had seen or heard anything out of the common . As to any harm having come to Mrs. Holbrook by the river - bank , he said he did n't think that was possible , for his men had been at work in the fields near the river all the afternoon , and must have seen or heard if there had been anything wrong . There was some kind of comfort in this , and I left the farm with my mind a little lighter than it had been when I went in there . I knew that Stephen Whitelaw was no friend to Mrs. Holbrook ; that he had a kind of grudge against her because she had been on some one else 's side in in something . "
104555	104707	104535	104535	she	176	" He did n't like her , sir , you see . I knew this , but I did n't think it possible he could deceive me in a matter of life and death . So I came home , hoping to find Mrs. Holbrook there before me . But there were no signs of her , nor of her husband either , though I had fully expected to see him . Even father owned that things looked bad now , and he let me send every man about the place some one way , and some another to hunt for my poor darling . I went into Crosber myself , though it was getting late by this time , and made inquiries of every creature I knew in the village ; but it was all no good : no one had seen anything of the lady I was looking for . "
104708	104713	104714	104714	Gilbert	178	" And the husband ? "
104718	104723	104714	104714	Gilbert	178	" what of him ? "
104724	104844	104535	104535	she	176	" He came next day at the usual hour , after we had been astir all night , and the farm - labourers had been far and wide looking for Mrs. Holbrook . I never saw any one seem so shocked and horrified as he did when we told him how his wife had been missing for more than four - and - twenty hours . He is not a gentleman to show his feelings much at ordinary times , and he was quiet enough in the midst of his alarm ; but he turned as white as death , and I never saw the natural colour come back to his face all the time he was down here . "
104845	104852	104714	104714	Gilbert	178	" How long did he stay ? "
104853	104996	104535	104535	she	176	" He only left yesterday . He was travelling about the country all the time , coming back here of a night to sleep , and with the hope that we might have heard something in his absence . The river was dragged for three days ; but , thank God , nothing came of that . Mr. Holbrook set the Malsham police to work not that they 're much good , I think ; but he would n't leave a stone unturned . And now I believe he has gone to London to get help from the police there . But O , sir , I ca n't make it out , and I have lain awake , night after night thinking of it , and puzzling myself about it , until all sorts of dreadful fancies come into my mind . "
104997	105001	104714	104714	Gilbert	178	" What fancies ? "
105002	105144	104535	104535	she	176	" O , sir , I scarcely dare tell you ; but I loved that sweet young lady so well , that I have been as watchful and jealous in all things that concerned her as if she had been my own sister . I have thought sometimes that her husband had grown tired of her ; that , however dearly he might have loved her at first , as I suppose he did , his love had worn out little by little , and he felt her a burden to him . What other reason could there be for him to keep her hidden away in this dull place , month after month , when he must have seen that her youth and beauty and gaiety of heart were slowly vanishing away , if he had eyes to see anything ? "
105145	105151	105152	105152	Gilbert	178	" But , good Heavens ! "
105170	105193	105164	105165	Ellen Carley	176	" you surely do not imagine that Marian 's husband had any part in her disappearance ? that he could be capable of "
105194	105205	105206	105207	the girl	5090	" I do n't know what to think , sir , "
105213	105339	105206	105207	the girl	5090	" I know that I have never liked Mr. Holbrook never liked or trusted him from the first , though he has been civil enough and kind enough in his own distant way to me . That dear young lady could not disappear off the face of the earth , as it seems she has done , without the evil work of some one . As to her leaving this place of her own free will , without a word of warning to her husband or to me , that I am sure she would never dream of doing . No , sir , there has been foul play of some kind , and I 'm afraid I shall never see that dear face again . "
105518	105528	105529	105529	he	178	" If she lives , I will find her , "
105564	105611	105541	105541	he	178	" Living or dead , I will find her . It shall be the business of my life from this hour . All my serious thoughts have been of her from the moment in which I first knew her . They will be doubly hers henceforward . "
105612	105620	105621	105622	Ellen Carley	176	" How good and true you are ! "
105626	105694	105621	105622	Ellen Carley	176	" and how you must have loved her ! I guessed when you were here last that it was you to whom she was engaged before her marriage , and told her as much ; but she would not acknowledge that I was right . O , how I wish she had kept faith with you ! how much happier she might have been as your wife ! "
105695	105709	105710	105710	Gilbert	178	" People have different notions of happiness , you see , Miss Carley , "
105717	105791	105710	105710	Gilbert	178	" Yes , you were right ; it was I who was to have been Marian Nowell 's husband , whose every hope of the future was bound up in her . But all that is past ; whatever bitterness I felt against her at first and I do not think I was ever very bitter has passed away . I am nothing now but her friend , her steadfast and constant friend . "
105792	105802	105803	105803	Ellen	176	" Thank heaven that she has such a friend , "
105807	105822	105803	105803	Ellen	176	" And you will make it your business to look for her , sir ? "
105823	105835	105710	105710	Gilbert	178	" The chief object of my life , from this hour . "
105836	105870	105803	105803	Ellen	176	" And you will try to discover whether her husband is really true , or whether the search that he has made for her has been a blind to hide his own guilt ? "
105871	105882	105884	105884	Gilbert	178	" What grounds have you for supposing his guilt possible ? "
105886	105936	105884	105884	Gilbert	178	" There are crimes too detestable for credibility ; and this would be such a one . You may imagine that I have no friendly feeling towards this man , yet I can not for an instant conceive him capable of harming a hair of his wife 's head . "
105937	106033	105803	105803	Ellen	176	" Because you have not brooded upon this business as I have , sir , for hours and hours together , until the smallest things seem to have an awful meaning . I have thought of every word and every look of Mr. Holbrook 's in the past , and all my thoughts have pointed one way . I believe that he was tired of his sweet young wife ; that his marriage was a burden and a trouble to him somehow ; that it had arisen out of an impulse that had passed away . "
106034	106047	105884	105884	Gilbert	178	" All this might be , and yet the man be innocent . "
106048	106096	106101	106101	she	5090	" He might be yes , sir . It is a hard thing , perhaps , even to think him guilty for a moment . But it is so difficult to account in any common way for Mrs. Holbrook 's disappearance . If there had been murder done "
106105	106182	106101	106101	she	5090	" a common murder , such as one hears of in lonely country places surely it must have come to light before this , after the search that has been made all round about . But it would have been easy enough for Mr. Holbrook to decoy his wife away to London or anywhere else . She would have gone anywhere with him , at a moment 's notice . She obeyed him implicitly in everything . "
106183	106200	106202	106202	Gilbert	178	" But why should he have taken her away from this place in a secret manner ? "
106204	106314	106202	106202	Gilbert	178	" he was free to remove her openly . And then you describe him as taking an amount of trouble in his search for her , which might have been so easily avoided , had he acted with ordinary prudence and caution . Say that he wanted to keep the secret of his marriage from the world in which he lives , and to place his wife in even a more secluded spot than this which scarcely seems possible what could have been easier for him than to take her away when and where he pleased ? No one here would have had any right to question his actions . "
106322	106330	106331	106331	she	176	" I do n't know , sir , "
106335	106439	106331	106331	she	176	" I daresay my fancies are very foolish ; they may have come , perhaps , out of thinking about this so much , till my brain has got addled , as one may say . But it flashed upon me all of a sudden one night , as Mr. Holbrook was standing in our parlour talking about his wife it flashed upon me that he was in the secret of her disappearance , and that he was only acting with us in his pretence of anxiety and all that ; I fancied there was a guilty look in his face , somehow . "
106440	106459	106101	106101	she	5090	" Did you tell him about his wife 's good fortune the money left her by her grandfather ? "
106460	106598	106331	106331	she	176	" I did , sir ; I thought it right to tell him everything I could about my poor dear young lady 's journey to London . She had told him of that in her letters , it seemed , but not about the money . She had been keeping that back for the pleasure of telling him with her own lips , and seeing his face light up , she said to me , when he heard the good news . I asked him about the letter which had come in the morning of the day she disappeared , and whether it was from him ; but he said no , he had not written , counting upon being with his wife that evening . It was only at the last moment he was prevented coming . "
106599	106610	106101	106101	she	5090	" You have looked for that letter , I suppose ? "
106611	106718	106331	106331	she	176	" O yes , sir ; I searched , and Mr. Holbrook too , in every direction , but the letter was n't to be found . He seemed very vexed about it , very anxious to find it . We could not but think that Mrs. Holbrook had gone to meet some one that day , and that the letter had something to do with her going out . I am sure she would not have gone beyond the garden and the meadow for pleasure alone . She never had been outside the gate without me , except when she went to meet her husband . "
106719	106722	106724	106724	Gilbert	178	" Strange ! "
107026	107043	107044	107044	he	178	" I shall spend a day or two in this neighbourhood before I return to town , "
107051	107114	107044	107044	he	178	" there are inquiries that I should like to make with my own lips . I shall be only going over old ground , I daresay , but it will be some satisfaction to me to do it for myself . Can you give me house - room here for a night or two , or shall I put up at Crosber ? "
107115	107156	107044	107044	he	178	" I 'm sure father would be very happy to accommodate you here , sir . We 've plenty of room now ; too much for my taste . The house seems like a wilderness now Mrs. Holbrook is gone . "
107157	107188	107044	107044	he	178	" Thanks . I shall be very glad to sleep here . There is just the chance that you may have some news for me , or I for you . "
107189	107206	107207	107208	the girl	5090	" Ah , sir , it 's only a very poor chance , I 'm afraid , "
107577	107594	107575	107575	she	5974	" opening dear Adela 's eyes about that dissipated good - for - nothing Mr. Saltram . "
107650	107664	107665	107665	she	212	" But O , how I wish that he would come to me ! "
107702	107854	107690	107691	Mrs. Pallinson	171	" My husband has been dead ever so long now , and what need have we to study the opinion of the world so much ? Of course I would n't marry him till a year , or more , after poor Michael 's death ; but I should like to see him often , to be sure that he still cares for me as he used to care yes , I am sure he used in the dear old days at Maidenhead . Why does n't he come to me ? He knows that I love him . He must know that I have no brighter hope than to make him the master of my fortune ; and yet he goes on in those dismal Temple chambers , toiling at his literary work as if he had not a thought in the world beyond earning so many pounds a week . "
107950	107953	107984	107984	Gluck	287	" recitals , "
109037	109056	109058	109067	this young person , who was of a vivacious temperament	2867	" I 'm sure the house itself seems lighter and more cheerful - like without her , ma'am , "
109083	109099	109058	109067	this young person , who was of a vivacious temperament	2867	" and you 're looking all the better already for not being worried by her . "
109100	109111	109112	109113	Mrs. Branston	214	" Berners , you really must not say such things , "
109117	109138	109112	109113	Mrs. Branston	214	" You ought to know that my cousin is most kind and thoughtful , and does everything for the best . "
109139	109162	109163	109164	the maid	2869	" O , of course , ma'am ; but some people 's best is quite as bad as other people 's worst , "
109168	109228	109163	109164	the maid	2869	" and as to kindness and thoughtfulness , Mrs. Pallinson is a great deal too kind and thoughtful , I think ; for her kindness and thoughtfulness wo n't allow you a moment 's rest . And then , as if anybody could n't see through her schemes about that precious son of hers with his finicking affected ways ! "
109579	109598	109599	109599	Adela	212	" I daresay it is my cousin Pallinson who has kept him away from me all this time , "
109613	109655	109599	109599	Adela	212	" I know how intolerant he is of any one he dislikes ; and no doubt he has taken a dislike to her ; she has done everything to provoke it , indeed , by her coldness and rudeness to him . "
109954	109967	109968	109968	he	2886	" Josephs has just been round asking about the carriage , mum , "
109978	110001	109968	109968	he	2886	" whether you 'd please to want the b'rouche or the broom , and whether you 'd drive before or after luncheon . "
110002	110040	110041	110043	The solemn Parker	294	" I shall not want the carriage this morning ; send for a cab , if you please , Parker . I am going into the City , and do n't care about taking the horses there . "
110110	110123	110124	110124	he	2886	" She 's a - going to her banker 's I suppose , "
110128	110151	110124	110124	he	2886	" going to make some new investments perhaps . Women are always a - fidgeting and chopping and changing with their money . "
110283	110295	110296	110297	the butler	2899	" Where shall I tell the man to drive , mum ? "
110322	110343	110319	110319	she	214	" The Union Bank , Chancery - lane . Tell him to go by the Strand and Temple - bar . "
110344	110356	110357	110358	Miss Berners	291	" I ca n't think what 's come to my mistress , "
110366	110420	110357	110358	Miss Berners	291	" Catch me driving in one of those nasty vulgar four - wheel cabs , if I had a couple of carriages and a couple of pairs of horses at my disposal . There 's some style about a hansom ; but I never could abide those creepy - crawley four - wheelers . "
110421	110444	110446	110447	Mr. Parker	294	" I admire your taste , Miss Berners ; and a dashing young woman like you 's a credit to a hansom , "
110450	110532	110446	110447	Mr. Parker	294	" But there 's no accounting for the vagaries of the female sex ; and I fancy somehow Mrs. B. did n't want any of us to know where she was going ; she coloured - up so when I asked her for the direction . You may depend there 's something up , Jane Berners . She 's going to see some poor relation perhaps Mile - end or Kentish - town way and was ashamed to give the address . "
110533	110551	110552	110553	Miss Berners	291	" I do n't believe she has any relations , except old Mother Pallinson and her son , "
111190	111194	111195	111195	he	246	" A lady ! "
111220	111227	111228	111228	he	246	" You here , Mrs. Branston ! "
111231	111248	111228	111228	he	246	" I you are the last person in the world I should have expected to see . "
111274	111287	111264	111264	he	246	" Of course I am not the less honoured by your visit . "
111331	111343	111344	111344	Adela	212	" You expected to see some one else , I think , "
111382	111396	111377	111377	he	246	" Scarcely ; but I expected to receive news of some one else . "
111397	111418	111420	111420	Adela	212	" Some one you are very anxious to hear about , I should imagine , from your manner just now , "
111432	111452	111420	111420	Adela	212	" Yes , Mrs. Branston , some one about whom I am anxious ; a relation , in short . "
111707	111718	111719	111719	she	212	" I have waited so anxiously for you to call , "
111730	111800	111719	111719	she	212	" and I began to fear that you must be ill , and I wished to consult you about the management of my affairs . My lawyers worry me so with questions which I do n't know how to answer , and I have so few friends in the world whom I can trust except you ; so at last I screwed up my courage to call upon you . "
111801	111813	111814	111815	John Saltram	246	" I am deeply honoured by your confidence , Mrs. Branston , "
111852	111884	111836	111836	his	246	" If my advice or assistance can be of any use to you , they are completely at your service . What is this business about which your solicitor bothers you ? "
111885	111894	111895	111895	Adela	212	" I 'll explain that to you directly , "
111907	111955	111902	111902	her	212	" How good you are ! I knew that you would help me ; but tell me first why you have never been to Cavendish - square in all this long time . I fear I was right ; you have been ill , have you not ? "
111956	111968	112010	112011	the Pallinsons	262	" Not exactly ill , but very much worried and overworked . "
112120	112131	112132	112132	she	212	" You are so kind to me , Mr. Saltram , "
112202	112241	112191	112191	you	246	" Her voice trembled a little as she said this , looking up at him all the while with soft confiding blue eyes , the fair delicate face looking its prettiest in the coquettish widow 's head - gear .
112315	112342	112302	112302	he	625	" My dear Mrs. Branston , you are too good to me ; I am unworthy , I am in every way unworthy of your kindness . "
112343	112456	112304	112304	his	625	" You are not unworthy , and that is no answer to my question ; only an excuse to put me off . We are such old friends , Mr. Saltram , you might trust me . You own that you have been worried overworked worried about money matters , perhaps . I know that gentlemen are generally subject to that kind of annoyance ; and you know how rich I am , how little employment I have for my money , though you can never imagine how worthless and useless it seems to me . Why wo n't you trust me ? why wo n't you let me be your banker ? "
112524	112531	112532	112532	he	1985	" The offer is like you , "
112538	112621	112532	112532	he	1985	" but the worries of which I spoke just now are not money troubles . I do not pretend to deny that my affairs are embarrassed , and have been for so long that entanglement has become their normal state ; but if they were ever so much more desperate , I could not afford to trade upon your generosity . No , Mrs. Branston , that is just the very last thing in this world that I could consent to do . "
112622	112633	112634	112634	Adela	212	" It is very cruel of you to say that , "
112672	112730	112666	112670	a man who loved her	2962	" There can be no reason for your saying this , except that you do not think me worthy of your confidence that you despise me too much to treat me like a friend . If I were that Mr. Fenton now , whom you care for so much , you would not treat me like this . "
112731	112818	112532	112532	he	1985	" I never borrowed a sixpence from Gilbert Fenton in my life , though I know that his purse is always open to me . But friendship is apt to end when money transactions begin . Believe me , I feel your goodness , Mrs. Branston , your womanly generosity ; but it is my own unworthiness that comes between me and your kindness . I can accept nothing from you but the sympathy which it is your nature to give to all who need it . "
112819	112903	112666	112670	a man who loved her	2962	" I do indeed sympathise with you ; but it seems so hard that you will not consent to make some use of all that money which is lying idle . It would make me so happy if I could think it were useful to you ; but I dare not say any more . I have said too much already , perhaps ; only I hope you will not think very badly of me for having acted on impulse in this way . "
112904	112932	112532	112532	he	1985	" Think badly of you , my dear kind soul ! What can I think , except that you are one of the most generous of women ? "
112933	112959	112666	112670	a man who loved her	2962	" And about these other troubles , Mr. Saltram , which have no relation to money matters ; you will not give me your confidence ? "
112960	112994	112532	112532	he	1985	" There is nothing that I can confide in you , Mrs. Branston . Others are involved in the matter of which I spoke , I am not free to talk about it . "
113088	113101	113102	113103	John Saltram	246	" And now about your own affairs , my dear Mrs. Branston ? "
113125	113146	113111	113111	his	246	" These tiresome letters of your lawyers ' ; let me see what use I can be in the matter . "
113413	113427	113428	113428	she	212	" You will come and dine with us very soon , I hope , "
113436	113513	113428	113428	she	212	" My cousin , Mrs. Pallinson , will be home in a day or two . She has been nursing her son for the last few days ; but he is much better , and I expect her back immediately . We shall be so pleased to see you ; you will name an early day , wo n't you ? Monday shall we say , or Sunday ? You ca n't plead business on Sunday . "
113514	113529	113428	113428	she	212	" My dear Mrs. Branston , I really am not well enough for visiting . "
113530	113565	113428	113428	she	212	" But dining with us does not come under the head of visiting . We will be quite alone , if you wish it . I shall be hurt if you refuse to come . "
113566	113590	113428	113428	she	212	" If you put it in that way , I can not refuse ; but I fear you will find me wretched company . "
113591	113624	113428	113428	she	212	" I am not afraid of that . And now I must ask you to forgive me for having wasted so much of your time , before I say good - morning . "
113625	113678	113428	113428	she	212	" There has been no time of mine wasted . I have learned to know your generous heart even better than I knew it before , and I think I always knew that it was a noble one . Believe me , I am not ungrateful or indifferent to so much goodness . "
113746	113751	113752	113752	he	2978	" Poor little soul , "
113758	113841	113752	113752	he	2978	" dear little soul ! There are men who would go to the end of the world for a woman like that ; yes , if she had not a sixpence . And to think that I , who thought myself so strong in the wisdom of the world , should have let such a prize slip through my fingers ? For what ? For a fancy , for a caprice that has brought confusion and shame upon me disappointment and regret . "
114395	114402	114403	114403	Gilbert	178	" Had he many books here ? "
114406	114410	114411	114412	the girl	5090	" Not many , "
114415	114440	114411	114412	the girl	5090	" but he was a very studious gentleman . He spent almost all his time shut up in his own room reading and writing . "
114441	114444	114403	114403	Gilbert	178	" Indeed ! "
114495	114517	114518	114518	he	178	" Do you know if he wrote books if he was what is called a literary man living by his pen ? "
114522	114661	114732	114733	the bailiff	6494	" I do n't know ; I never heard his wife say so . But Mrs. Holbrook was always reserved about him and his history . I think he had forbidden her to talk about his affairs . I know I used to fancy it was a dull life for her , poor soul , sitting in his room hour after hour , working while he wrote . He used not to allow her to be with him at all at first , but little by little she persuaded him to let her sit with him , promising not to disturb him by so much as a word ; and she never did . She seemed quite happy when she was with him , contented , and proud to think that her presence was no hindrance to him . "
114662	114674	114732	114733	the bailiff	6494	" And you think he loved her , do n't you ? "
114675	114729	114732	114733	the bailiff	6494	" At first , yes ; but I think a kind of weariness came over him afterwards , and that she saw it , and almost broke her heart about it . She was so simple and innocent , poor darling , it was n't easy for her to hide anything she felt . "
114939	114960	114961	114961	he	178	" I think I could have forgiven him if he had come between us in a bold and open way , "
114975	115098	114961	114961	he	178	" yes , I think I could have forgiven him , in spite of the bitterness of losing her . But to steal her from me with cowardly treacherous secrecy , to hide my treasure in an obscure corner , and then grow weary of her , and blight her fair young life with his coldness , can I forgive him these things ? can all the memory of the past plead with me for him when I think of these things ? O God , grant that I am mistaken ; that it is some other man who has done this , and not John Saltram ; not the man I have loved and honoured for fifteen years of my life ! "
115348	115351	115340	115340	They	3024	" Drownded . "
115352	115360	115361	115361	Gilbert	178	" But the river has been dragged , "
115365	115373	115361	115361	Gilbert	178	" and there has been nothing found . "
115409	115412	115414	115419	the chief of the local constabulary	3032	" Holes , "
115423	115485	115487	115488	the man	905	" there 's holes in that there river where you might hide half a dozen drownded men , and never hope to find 'em , no more than if they was at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean . Lord bless your heart , sir , you Londoners do n't know what a river is , in a manner of speaking , "
115516	115560	115487	115488	the man	905	" I 've known a many poor creatures drownded in that river , and never one of 'em to come to light not that the river was dragged for them . Their friends were n't of the dragging class , they were n't . "
115925	115936	115937	115938	the officer	3054	" She had a watch and chain , I suppose ? "
115941	115947	115937	115938	the officer	3054	" Ladies will wear 'em . "
116020	116023	116025	116026	the officer	3054	" Ah , "
116032	116113	116025	116026	the officer	3054	" quite enough to cost her her life , if she met with one of your ugly customers . I 've known a murder committed for the sake of three - and - sixpence in my time ; and pushing a young woman into the river do n't count for murder among that sort of people . You see , some one may come by and fish her out again ; so it ca n't well be more than manslaughter . "
116568	116584	116586	116586	Gilbert	178	" But a woman 's fancies sometimes mean a very deep feeling , Mr. Carley , "
116588	116622	116586	116586	Gilbert	178	" and what worldly - wise people call a good home , is not always a happy one . It 's a hard thing for a young woman to marry against her inclination . "
116623	116626	116628	116629	the bailiff	6494	" Humph ! "
116635	116811	116628	116629	the bailiff	6494	" It 's a harder thing for her to marry a pauper , I should think , and to bring a regiment of children into the world , always wanting shoes and stockings . But you 're a bachelor , you see , Mr. Fenton , and ca n't be expected to know what shoes and stockings are . Now there happens to be a friend of mine a steady , respectable , middle - aged man who worships the ground my girl walks on , and could make her mistress of as good a house as any within twenty miles of this , and give a home to her father in his old age , into the bargain ; for I 'm only a servant here , and it ca n't be expected that I am to go on toiling and slaving about this place for ever . I do n't say but what I 've saved a few pounds , but I have n't saved enough to keep me out of the workhouse . "
116847	116858	116859	116859	he	6494	" What a young woman wants is a good home , "
116863	116892	116859	116859	he	6494	" whether she has the sense to know it herself , or whether she has n't , that 's what she 's got to look for in life . "
116966	116986	116987	116987	he	178	" God forbid that frank warm - hearted girl should ever be sacrificed to such a fellow as this , "
117173	117190	117191	117191	he	178	" I fancy you and I must have met before to - night , Mr. Whitelaw , "
117194	117224	117191	117191	he	178	" or that you must have some notion to that effect . You 've looked at me with an amount of interest my personal merits could scarcely call for . "
117225	117232	117237	117237	his	3092	" No , no , sir , "
117243	117348	117237	117237	his	3092	" it is n't that ; I never set eyes on you before I came into this room to - night . But you see , Ellen , she 's interested in you , and I take an interest in any one she takes to . And we 've all of us thought so much about your searching for that poor young lady that 's missing , and taking such pains , and being so patient - like where another would have given in at the first set - off so , altogether , you 're a general object of interest , you see . "
117408	117418	117419	117419	he	178	" It has been sad work , so far , "
117422	117447	117419	117419	he	178	" I suppose you can give me no hint , no kind of advice as to any step to be taken in the future . "
117448	117503	117419	117419	he	178	" Lord bless you , no sir . Everything that could be done was done before you came here . Mr. Holbrook did n't leave a stone unturned . He did his duty as a man and a husband , sir . The poor young lady was drowned there 's no doubt about that . "
117504	117511	117512	117512	Gilbert	178	" I do n't believe it , "
117529	117550	117551	117551	he	178	" You do n't believe she was drowned ! You mean to say you think she 's alive , then ? "
117562	117586	117419	117419	he	178	" I have a firm conviction that she still lives ; that , with God 's blessing , I shall see her again . "
117587	117592	117593	117594	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" Well , sir , "
117619	117712	117609	117609	his	177	" of course it ai n't my place to go against any gentleman 's convictions far from it ; but if you see Mrs. Holbrook before the dead rise out of their graves , my name is n't Stephen Whitelaw . You may waste your time and your trouble , and you may spend your money as it was so much water , but set eyes upon that missing lady you never will ; take my word for it , or do n't take my word for it , as you please . "
118206	118219	118220	118220	Gilbert	178	" In London I shall have clever detectives always at my service , "
118223	118240	118220	118220	Gilbert	178	" in London I may be able to solve the question of John Holbrook 's identity . "
119104	119118	119119	119119	Gilbert	178	" I have come to you about a bad business , Mr. Medler , "
119162	119179	119393	119394	Ellen Carley	176	" but first let me ask you a question : Have you heard from Mrs. Holbrook ? "
119180	119185	119393	119394	Ellen Carley	176	" Not a line . "
119186	119203	119204	119204	Gilbert	178	" And have you taken no further steps , no other means of communicating with her ? "
119207	119242	119393	119394	Ellen Carley	176	" Not yet . I think of sending my clerk down to Hampshire , or of going down myself perhaps , in a day or two , if my business engagements will permit me . "
119243	119307	119393	119394	Ellen Carley	176	" Do you not consider the case rather an urgent one , Mr. Medler ? I should have supposed that your curiosity would have been aroused by the absence of any reply to your letters that you would have looked at the business in a more serious light than you appear to have done that you would have taken alarm , in short . "
119308	119315	119316	119317	the lawyer	5706	" Why should I do so ? "
119321	119371	119393	119394	Ellen Carley	176	" It is Mrs. Holbrook 's business to look after her affairs . The property is safe enough . She can administer to the will as soon as she pleases . I certainly wonder that the husband has not been a little sharper and more active in the business . "
119372	119385	119393	119394	Ellen Carley	176	" You have heard nothing of him , then , I presume ? "
119386	119389	119393	119394	Ellen Carley	176	" Nothing . "
119591	119599	119600	119600	he	178	" You are right , Mr. Fenton , "
119605	119650	119600	119600	he	178	" It is a bad business , a very bad business . May I ask you what is the common opinion among people in that part of the world in the immediate neighbourhood of the event , as to this poor lady 's fate ? "
119651	119707	119858	119859	the lawyer	5706	" An opinion with which I can not bring myself to agree an opinion which I pray God may prove as unfounded as I believe it to be . It is generally thought that Mrs. Holbrook has fallen a victim to some common crime that she was robbed , and then thrown into the river . "
119708	119718	119600	119600	he	178	" The river has been dragged , I suppose ? "
119719	119736	119858	119859	the lawyer	5706	" It has ; but the people about there seem to consider that no conclusive test . "
119737	119752	119600	119600	he	178	" Had Mrs. Holbrook anything valuable about her at the time of her disappearance ? "
119753	119764	119858	119859	the lawyer	5706	" Her watch and chain and a few other trinkets . "
119765	119810	119600	119600	he	178	" Humph ! There are scoundrels about the country who will commit the darkest crime for the smallest inducement . I confess the business has rather a black look , Mr. Fenton , and that I am inclined to concur with the country people . "
119811	119830	119831	119831	Gilbert	178	" An easy way of settling the question for those not vitally interested in the lady 's fate , "
119835	119857	119858	119859	the lawyer	5706	" The lady is my client , sir , and I am bound to feel a warm interest in her affairs , "
119876	119888	119890	119890	Gilbert	178	" The lady was once my promised wife , Mr. Medler , "
119892	119943	119890	119890	Gilbert	178	" and now stands to me in the place of a beloved and only sister . For me the mystery of her fate is an all - absorbing question , an enigma to the solution of which I mean to devote the rest of my life , if need be . "
119944	119966	119858	119859	the lawyer	5706	" A wasted life , Mr. Fenton ; and in the meantime that river down yonder may hide the only secret . "
119967	119971	119973	119973	Gilbert	178	" O God ! "
119976	120023	119973	119973	Gilbert	178	" how eager every one is to make an end of this business ! Even the men whom I paid and bribed to help me grew tired of their work , and abandoned all hope after the feeblest , most miserable attempts to earn their reward . "
120024	120037	120039	120040	the lawyer	5706	" What can be done in such a case , Mr. Fenton ? "
120050	120092	120043	120043	his	5706	" What can the police do more than you or I ? They have only a little more experience , that 's all ; they have no recondite means of solving these social mysteries . You have advertised , of course ? "
120093	120151	119973	119973	Gilbert	178	" Yes , in many channels , with a certain amount of caution , but in such a manner as to insure Mrs. Holbrook 's identification , if she had fallen into the hands of any one willing to communicate with me , and to insure her own attention , were she free to act for herself . "
120152	120170	120043	120043	his	5706	" Humph ! Then it seems to me that everything has been done that can be done . "
120171	120224	119973	119973	Gilbert	178	" Not yet . The men whom I employed in Hampshire they were recommended to me by the Scotland - yard authorities , certainly may not have been up to the mark . In any case , I shall try some one else . Do you know anything of the detective force ? "
120237	120265	120266	120266	He	276	" No , he did not know the name of a single detective ; his business did not bring him in contact with that class of people . "
120346	120354	120355	120355	Gilbert	178	" I can get the information elsewhere , "
120359	120373	120355	120355	Gilbert	178	" Believe me , I do not mean to let this matter drop . "
120374	120480	120355	120355	Gilbert	178	" My dear sir , if I might venture upon a word of friendly advice not in a professional spirit , but as between man and man I should warn you against wasting your time and fortune upon a useless pursuit . If Mrs. Holbrook has vanished from the world of her own free will a thing that often happens , eccentric as it may be she will reappear in good time of her own free will . If she has been the victim of a crime , that crime will no doubt come to light in due course , without any efforts of yours . "
120481	120493	120495	120495	Gilbert	178	" That is the common kind of advice , Mr. Medler , "
120497	120561	120495	120495	Gilbert	178	" Prudent counsel , no doubt , if a man could be content to take it , and well meant ; but , you see , I have loved this lady , love her still , and shall continue so to love her till the end of my life . It is not possible for me to rest in ignorance of her fate . "
120562	120573	120575	120576	the lawyer	5706	" Although she jilted you in favour of Mr. Holbrook ? "
120583	120671	120355	120355	Gilbert	178	" That wrong has been forgiven . Fate did not permit me to be her husband , but I can be her friend and brother . She has need of some one to stand in that position , poor girl ! for her lot is very lonely . And now I want you to explain the conditions of her grandfather 's will . It is her father who would profit , I think I gathered from our last conversation , in the event of Marian 's death . "
120672	120688	120355	120355	Gilbert	178	" In the event of her dying childless yes , the father would take all . "
120689	120704	120355	120355	Gilbert	178	" Then he is really the only person who could profit by her death ? "
120705	120710	120712	120713	the lawyer	5706	" Well , yes , "
120719	120771	120712	120713	the lawyer	5706	" under her grandfather 's will , yes , her father would take all . Of course , in the event of her father having died previously , the husband would come in as heir - at - law . You see it was not easy to exclude the husband altogether . "
120772	120788	120355	120355	Gilbert	178	" And do you believe that Mr. Nowell is still living to claim his inheritance ? "
120789	120832	120712	120713	the lawyer	5706	" I believe so . I fancy the old man had some tidings of his son before the will was executed ; that he , in short , heard of his having been met with not long ago , over in America . "
120833	120845	120847	120847	Gilbert	178	" No doubt he will speedily put in an appearance now , "
120849	120866	120847	120847	Gilbert	178	" now that there is a fortune to be gained by the assertion of his identity . "
120867	120870	120872	120873	the lawyer	5706	" Humph ! "
120875	120978	120872	120873	the lawyer	5706	" It would not be very easy for him to put his hand on sixpence of Jacob Nowell 's money , in the absence of any proof of Mrs. Holbrook 's death . There would be no end of appeals to the Court of Chancery ; and after all manner of formulas he might obtain a decree that would lock up the property for twenty - four years . I doubt , if the executor chose to stick to technicals , and the business got into chancery , whether Percival Nowell would live long enough to profit by his father 's will . "
120979	120986	120988	120988	Gilbert	178	" I am glad of that , "
120990	121044	120988	120988	Gilbert	178	" I know the man to be a scoundrel , and I am very glad that he is unlikely to be a gainer by any misfortune that has befallen his daughter . Had it been otherwise , I should have been inclined to think that he had had some hand in this disappearance . "
121057	121096	120872	120873	the lawyer	5706	" In other words , you would imply that Percival Nowell may have made away with his daughter . You must have a very bad opinion of human nature , Mr. Fenton , to conceive anything so horrible . "
121097	121109	121111	121111	Gilbert	178	" My suspicions do not go quite so far as that , "
121113	121155	121111	121111	Gilbert	178	" God forbid that it should be so . I have a firm belief that Marian Holbrook lives . But it is possible to get a person out of the way without the last worst crime of which mankind is capable . "
121156	121174	120872	120873	the lawyer	5706	" It would seem more natural to suspect the husband than the father , I should imagine , "
121184	121208	120872	120873	the lawyer	5706	" I can not see that . The husband had nothing to gain by his wife 's disappearance , and everything to lose . "
121209	121326	120872	120873	the lawyer	5706	" He might have supposed the father to be dead , and that he would step into the fortune . He might not know enough of the law of property to be aware of the difficulties attending a succession of that kind . There is a most extraordinary ignorance of the law of the land prevailing among well - educated Englishmen . Or he may have been tired of his wife , and have seen his way to a more advantageous alliance . Men are not always satisfied with one wife in these days , and a man who married in such a strange underhand manner would be likely to have some hidden motive for secrecy . "
121609	121621	121622	121622	Gilbert	178	" There shall be an end of these shapeless unspoken doubts , "
121627	121664	121622	121622	Gilbert	178	" I will see John Saltram to - day , and there shall be an explanation between us . I will be his dupe and fool no longer . I will get at the truth somehow . "
121697	121714	121715	121715	he	178	" You did not tell me the names of the executors to Jacob Nowell 's will , "
121718	121727	121729	121730	Mr. Medler	276	" You did n't ask me the question , "
121733	121741	121729	121730	Mr. Medler	276	" There is only one executor myself . "
121742	121763	121694	121694	he	178	" Indeed ! Mr. Nowell must have had a very high opinion of you to leave you so much power . "
121764	121832	121729	121730	Mr. Medler	276	" I do n't know about power . Jacob Nowell knew me , and he did n't know many people . I do n't say that he put any especial confidence in me for it was his habit to trust no one , his boast that he trusted no one . But he was obliged to name some one for his executor , and he named me . "
121833	121849	121851	121851	Gilbert	178	" Shall you consider it your duty to seek out or advertise for Percival Nowell ? "
121853	121886	121729	121730	Mr. Medler	276	" I shall be in no hurry to do that , in the absence of any proof of his daughter 's death . My first duty would be to look for her . "
121887	121935	121729	121730	Mr. Medler	276	" God grant you may be more fortunate than I have been ! There is my card , Mr. Medler . You will be so good as to let me have a line immediately , at that address , if you obtain any tidings of Mrs. Holbrook . "
121936	121942	121729	121730	Mr. Medler	276	" I will do so . "
122230	122233	122234	122234	Gilbert	178	" Ill , "
122272	122272	122264	122264	I	0	"
122333	122344	122345	122345	he	178	" O God , how fond I was of him ! "
122350	122400	122345	122345	he	178	" And if he has been a traitor ! If he were to die like this , before I have wrung the truth from him to die , and I not dare to cherish his memory to be obliged to live out my life with this doubt of him ! "
122431	122434	122435	122435	he	246	" Marian ! "
122438	122441	122435	122435	he	246	" Marian ! "
122442	122445	122447	122447	Gilbert	178	" Yes , "
122449	122461	122447	122447	Gilbert	178	" it is all true . He is calling his wife . "
122519	122531	122532	122534	the sick man	3190	" Marian , come here . Come , child , come , "
122541	122601	122532	122534	the sick man	3190	" What , are you afraid of me ? Is this death ? Am I dead , and parted from her ? Would anything else keep her from me when I call for her , the poor child that loved me so well ? And I have wished myself free of her God forgive me ! wished myself free . "
122714	122729	122730	122730	she	1183	" O , sir , what a providence it is that you 've come ! "
122733	122918	122730	122730	she	1183	" Poor dear gentleman , he has been that ill , and me not knowing what to do more than a baby , except in the way of sending for a doctor when I see how bad he was , and waiting on him myself day and night , which I have done faithful , and am that worn - out in consequence , that I shake like a haspen , and ca n't touch a bit of victuals . I had but just slipped round to the court , while he was asleep , poor dear , to give my children their dinner ; for it 's a hard trial , sir , having a helpless young family depending upon one ; and it would but be fair that all I have gone through should be considered ; for though I says it as should n't , there is n't one of your hired nurses would do more ; and I 'm willing to continue of it , provisoed as I have help at nights , and my trouble considered in my wages . "
122919	122940	123174	123175	The laundress	1421	" You need have no apprehension ; you shall be paid for your trouble . Has he been long ill ? "
122941	123173	122730	122730	she	1183	" Well , sir , he took the cold as were the beginning of his illness a fortnight ago come next Thursday . You may remember , perhaps , as it came on awful wet in the afternoon , last Thursday week , and Mr. Saltram was out in the rain , and walked home in it , not being able to get a cab , I suppose , or perhaps not caring to get one , for he was always a careless gentleman in such respects , and come in wet through to the skin ; and instead of changing his clothes , as a Christian would have done , just gives himself a shake like , as he might have been a New - fondling dog that had been swimming , and sits down before the fire , which of course drawed out the steam from his things and made it worse , and writes away for dear life till twelve o'clock that night , having something particular to finish for them magazines , he says ; and so , when I come to tidy - up a bit the last thing at night , I found him sitting at the table writing , and did n't take no more notice of me than a dog , which was his way , though never meant unkindly quite the reverse . "
123197	123443	122730	122730	she	1183	" Well , sir , the next day , he had a vi'lent cold , as you may suppose , and was low and languid - like , but went on with his writing , and it were n't no good asking him not . ' I want money , Mrs. Pratt , ' he said ; ' you ca n't tell how bad I want money , and these people pay me for my stuff as fast as I send it in . ' The day after that he was a deal worse , and had a wandering way like , as if he did n't know what he was doing ; and sat turning over his papers with one hand , and leaning his head upon the other , and groaned so that it went through one like a knife to hear him . ' It 's no use , ' he said at last ; ' it 's no use ! ' and then went and threw hisself down upon that bed , and has never got up since , poor dear gentleman ! I went round to fetch a doctor out of Essex Street , finding as he was no better in the evening , and awful hot , and still more wandering - like Mr. Mew by name , a very nice gentleman which said as it were rheumatic fever , and has been here twice a day ever since . "
123444	123458	123459	123459	Gilbert	178	" Has Mr. Saltram never been in his right senses since that day ? "
123462	123509	122730	122730	she	1183	" O yes , sir ; off and on for the first week he was quite hisself at times ; but for the last three days he has n't known any one , and has talked and jabbered a deal , and has been dreadful restless . "
123510	123520	122730	122730	she	1183	" Does the doctor call it a dangerous case ? "
123521	123615	122730	122730	she	1183	" Well , sir , not to deceive you , he ast me if Mr. Saltram had any friends as I could send for ; and I says no , not to my knowledge ; ' for , ' says Mr. Mew , ' if he have any relations or friends near at hand , they ought to be told that he 's in a bad way ; ' and only this morning he said as how he should like to call in a physician , for the case was a bad one . "
123616	123625	123626	123626	Gilbert	178	" I see . There is danger evidently , "
123630	123652	123626	123626	Gilbert	178	" I will wait and hear what the doctor says . He will come again to - day , I suppose ? "
123653	123667	122730	122730	she	1183	" Yes , sir ; he 's sure to come in the evening . "
123668	123718	123626	123626	Gilbert	178	" Good ; I will stay till the evening . I should like you to go round immediately to this Mr. Mew 's house , and ask for the address of some skilled nurse , and then go on , in a cab if necessary , and fetch her . "
123719	123744	122730	122730	she	1183	" I could do that , sir , of course , not but what I feel myself capable of nursing the poor dear gentleman . "
123745	123797	123626	123626	Gilbert	178	" You ca n't nurse him night and day , my good woman . Do what I tell you , and bring back a professional nurse as soon as you can . If Mr. Mew should be out , his people are likely to know the address of such a person . "
124073	124087	124088	124088	he	178	" Poor wretch ! he may have tried to be true to me , "
124205	124258	124259	124260	The sleeper	2318	" To take my hand in friendship , knowing what he had done , and how my life was broken ! to pretend sympathy ; to play out the miserable farce to the very last ! Great heaven ! that the man I have honoured could be capable of so much baseness ! "
124327	124332	124333	124333	he	178	" The man again ! "
124336	124342	124333	124333	he	178	" When will she come ? "
124355	124362	124351	124351	he	178	" Mother , you fetch her ! "
124422	124431	124432	124432	he	178	" I will see him safely through this , "
124437	124440	124432	124432	he	178	" and then "
124674	124679	124680	124681	John Saltram	246	" Who 's that ? "
124685	124695	124680	124681	John Saltram	246	" It seems like the touch of a friend . "
125002	125046	125048	125049	Mrs. Pratt	302	" It was all the way up at Islington , sir , and I paid the cabman three - and - six altogether , which he said it were his fare . And how has the poor dear been while I was away ? "
125064	125093	125052	125052	her	302	" Very much as you see him now . He has mentioned a name once or twice , the name of Marian . Have you ever heard that ? "
125094	125166	125052	125052	her	302	" I should say I have , sir , times and often since he 's been ill . ' Marian , why do n't you come to me ? ' so pitiful ; and then , ' Lost , lost ! ' in such a awful wild way . I think it must be some favourite sister , sir , or a young lady as he has kep ' company with . "
125167	125170	125052	125052	her	302	" Marian ! "
125190	125218	125052	125052	her	302	" Marian ! O no , no ; she is gone ; I have lost her ! Well , I wished it ; I wanted my freedom . "
125458	125468	125469	125469	he	178	" O God , it is hard to bear ! "
125474	125499	125469	125469	he	178	" it is a bitter trial to bear . If this illness should end in death , I may never know Marian 's fate . "
125598	125611	125612	125612	he	303	" It is a bad case , sir a very bad case , "
125629	125719	125612	125612	he	303	" There has been a violent cold caught , you see , through our poor friend 's recklessness in neglecting to change his damp clothes , and rheumatic fever has set in . But it appears to me that there are other causes at work mental disturbance , and so on . Our friend has been taxing his brain a little too severely , I gather from Mrs. Pratt 's account of him ; and these things will tell , sir ; sooner or later they have their effect . "
125720	125726	125617	125617	he	303	" Then you apprehend danger ? "
125727	125769	125612	125612	he	303	" Well , yes ; I dare not tell you that there is an absence of danger . Mr. Saltram has a fine constitution , a noble frame ; but the strain is a severe one , especially upon the mind . "
125770	125803	125804	125804	Gilbert	178	" You spoke just now of over - work as a cause for this mental disturbance . Might it not rather proceed from some secret trouble of mind , some hidden care ? "
125808	125846	125612	125612	he	303	" That , sir , is an open question . The mind is unhinged ; there is no doubt of that . There is something more here than the ordinary delirium we look for in fever cases . "
125847	125869	125612	125612	he	303	" You have talked of a physician , Mr. Mew ; would it not be well to call one in immediately ? "
125870	125922	125612	125612	he	303	" I should feel more comfortable if my opinion were supported , sir : not that I believe there is anything more can be done for our patient than I have been doing ; but the case is a critical one , and I should be glad to feel myself supported . "
125923	125950	125612	125612	he	303	" If you will give me the name and address of the gentleman you would like to call in , I will go for him immediately . "
125951	125979	125612	125612	he	303	" To - night ? Nay , my dear sir , there is no occasion for such haste ; to - morrow morning will do very well . "
125980	126002	125612	125612	he	303	" To - morrow morning , then ; but I will make the appointment to - night , if I can . "
126143	126158	126160	126161	the laundress	1421	" Why , you do n't mean that , sir , sure to goodness , "
126165	126180	126160	126161	the laundress	1421	" and not so much as a sofy bedstead , nor nothing anyways comfortable . "
126181	126283	126160	126161	the laundress	1421	" I could sleep upon three or four chairs , if it were necessary ; but there is an old sofa in the bedroom . You might bring that into this room for me ; and the nurse can have it in the day - time . She wo n't want to be lying down to - night , I daresay . I do n't suppose I shall sleep much myself , but I am a little knocked up , and shall be glad of some sort of rest . I want to be on the spot , come what may . "
126284	126327	126160	126161	the laundress	1421	" But , sir , with the new nurse and me , there surely ca n't be no necessity ; and you might be round the first thing in the morning like to see how the poor dear gentleman has slep ' . "
126328	126357	126160	126161	the laundress	1421	" I know that , but I would rather be on the spot . I have my own especial reasons . You can go home to your children . "
126358	126439	126160	126161	the laundress	1421	" Thank you kindly , sir ; which I shall be very glad to take care of 'em , poor things . And I hope , sir , as you wo n't forget that I 've gone through a deal for Mr. Saltram if so be as he should n't get better himself , which the Lord forbid to take my trouble into consideration , bein ' as he were always a free - handed gentleman , though not rich . "
126440	126477	126160	126161	the laundress	1421	" Your services will not be forgotten , Mrs. Pratt , depend upon it . Perhaps I 'd better give you a couple of sovereigns on account : that 'll make matters straight for the present . "
126478	126490	126492	126493	the laundress	1421	" Yes , sir ; and many thanks for your generosity , "
126510	126531	126507	126507	her	1421	" and Mr. Saltram shall want nothing as my care can provide for him , you may depend upon it . "
126532	126557	126160	126161	the laundress	1421	" That is well . And now I am going out to get some dinner ; I shall be back in half an hour . "
126720	126736	126737	126737	Gilbert	178	" Bring me a chop or a steak , and a pint of dry sherry , "
126741	126777	126737	126737	Gilbert	178	" Have a slice of turbot and lobster - sauce , sir the turbot are uncommon fine to - day ; and a briled fowl and mushrooms . It will be ready in five minutes . "
126778	126803	126737	126737	Gilbert	178	" You may bring me the fowl , if you like : I wo n't wait for fish . I 'm in a hurry . "
127457	127460	127461	127462	The nurse	7489	" Marian . "
127480	127483	127484	127484	he	246	" Marian , "
127487	127632	127484	127484	he	246	" Marian , why have you left me ? God knows I loved you ; yes , even when I seemed cold and neglectful . Everything was against me ; but I loved you , my dear , I loved you ! Did I ever say that you came between me and fortune was I mean enough , base enough , ever to say that ? It was a lie , my love ; you were my fortune . Were poverty and obscurity hard things to bear for you ? No , my darling , no ; I will face them to - morrow , if you will come back to me . O no , no , she is gone ; my life has gone : I broke her heart with my hard bitter words ; I drove my angel away from me . "
127692	127700	127701	127701	he	178	" Speak to me , John Saltram , "
127704	127723	127701	127701	he	178	" You know me , do n't you the man who was once your friend , Gilbert Fenton ? "
127733	127770	127724	127725	The other	595	" Gilbert Fenton my friend , the man who trusts me still ! Poor old Gilbert ! and I fancied that I loved him , that I would have freely sacrificed my own happiness for his . "
127771	127778	127779	127779	Gilbert	178	" And yet you betrayed him , "
127787	127828	127779	127779	Gilbert	178	" But that may be forgiven , if you have been guilty of no deeper wrong than that . John Saltram , as you have a soul to be saved , what have you done with Marian with your wife ? "
127847	127851	127852	127854	the sick man	3190	" Killed her ! "
127862	127944	127852	127854	the sick man	3190	" She was too good for me , you see ; and I grew weary of her calm beauty , and I sickened of her tranquil goodness . First I sacrificed honour , friendship , everything to win her ; and then I got tired of my prize . It is my nature , I suppose ; but I loved her all the time ; she had twined herself about my heart somehow . I knew it when she was lost . "
127945	127953	127955	127955	Gilbert	178	" What have you done with her ? "
127972	128016	128052	128052	he	178	" What have I done with her ? I forget . She is gone I wanted my freedom ; I felt myself fettered , a ruined man . She is gone ; and I am free , free to make a better marriage . "
128017	128021	128023	128023	Gilbert	178	" O God ! "
128025	128050	128023	128023	Gilbert	178	" is this man the blackest villain that ever cumbered the earth ? What am I to think , what am I to believe ? "
128180	128185	128186	128187	Mrs. Pratt	302	" Talk of friends , "
128198	128262	128186	128187	Mrs. Pratt	302	" never did I see such a friend as Mr. Fenting , sacrificing of himself as he do , day and night , to look after that poor creature in there , and taking no better rest than he can get on that old horsehair sofy , which brickbats or knife boards is n't harder , and never do you hear him murmur . "
128928	128941	128942	128942	she	5090	" Not quite so fast , if you please , Mr. Whitelaw , "
128945	129043	128942	128942	she	5090	" it takes two to make a bargain of that kind , just the same as it takes two to quarrel . There 's many curious changes may come in a person 's life , no doubt , and folks never know what 's going to happen to them ; but whatever changes may come upon me , that is n't one of them . I may live to see the inside of the workhouse , perhaps , when I 'm too old for service ; but I shall never sleep under the roof of Wyncomb Farmhouse . "
129052	129066	129067	129067	he	905	" What a spirited one she is , ai n't she , now ? "
129073	129127	129067	129067	he	905	" O , you wo n't , wo n't you , my lass ; you turn up that pretty little nose of yours it do turn up a bit of itself , do n't it , though ? at Wyncomb Farm and Stephen Whitelaw ; your father tells a different story , Nell . "
129128	129137	129139	129140	the girl	5090	" Then my father tells a lying story , "
129147	129252	129139	129140	the girl	5090	" and it is n't for want o ' knowing the truth . He knows that , if it was put upon me to choose between your house and the union , I 'd go to the union and with a light heart too , to be free of you . I did n't want to be rude , Mr. Whitelaw ; for you 've been civil - spoken enough to me , and I daresay you 're a good friend to my father ; but I ca n't help speaking the truth , and you 've brought it on yourself with your nonsense . "
129253	129271	129273	129274	the bailiff	6494	" She 's got a devil of a tongue of her own , you see , Whitelaw , "
129284	129318	129273	129274	the bailiff	6494	" but she do n't mean above a quarter what she says and when her time comes , she 'll do as she 's bid , or she 's no child of mine . "
129319	129326	129328	129329	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" O , I forgive her , "
129338	129406	129328	129329	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" I 'm not the man to bear malice against a pretty woman , and to my mind a pretty woman looks all the prettier when she 's in a passion . I 'm not in a hurry , you see , Carley ; I can bide my time ; but I shall never take a mistress to Wyncomb unless I can take the one I like . "
129514	129552	129553	129553	Ellen	176	" I suppose he means to sit in that room night after night , smoking his pipe and staring with those pale stupid eyes of his , till I change my mind and promise to marry him , "
129571	129694	129559	129559	she	176	" He may sit there till his hair turns gray if ever such red hair does turn to anything better than itself and he 'll find no change in me . I wish Frank were here to keep up my courage . I think if he were to ask me to run away with him , I should be tempted to say yes , at the risk of bringing ruin upon both of us ; anything to escape out of the power of that man . But come what may , I wo n't endure it much longer . I 'll run away to service soon after Christmas , and father will only have himself to thank for the loss of me . "
129839	129854	129856	129857	this matron	3336	" Young ladies do n't often forget to put up a bit of mistletoe , "
129859	129872	129874	129874	she	3336	" when there 's a chance of them they like being by ; "
129889	129901	129874	129874	she	3336	" Miss Carley is n't like the generality of young ladies , "
130001	130011	130013	130014	the matron	677	" He has been a good friend to me , "
130016	130239	130013	130014	the matron	677	" that I never have denied and never shall deny . But I have been a good servant to him ; ah ! there is n't a hired servant as would toil and drudge , and watch and pinch , as I have done to please him , and never have had payment from him more than a new gown at Christmas , or a five - pound note after harvest . And of course , if ever he marries , I shall have to look for a new home ; for I know too much of his ways , I daresay , for a wife to like to have me about her and me of an age when it seem a hard to have to go among strangers and not having saved sixpence , where I might have put by a hundred pounds easy , if I had n't been working without wages for a relation . But I 've not been called a servant , you see ; and I suppose Stephen thinks that 's payment enough for my trouble . Goodness knows I 've saved him many a pound , and that he 'll know when I 'm gone ; for he 's near , is Stephen , and it goes to his heart to part with a shilling . "
130240	130252	130253	130253	Ellen	176	" But why should you ever leave him , Mrs. Tadman ? "
130257	130269	130253	130253	Ellen	176	" I should n't think he could have a better housekeeper . "
130270	130274	130276	130277	the widow	5832	" Perhaps not , "
130286	130329	130331	130332	Mrs. Tadman	307	" but his wife wo n't think that ; and when he 's got a wife he 'll want her to be his housekeeper , and to pinch and scrape as I 've pinched and scraped for him . Lord help her ! "
130350	130358	130360	130360	Ellen	176	" But perhaps he never will marry , "
130363	130374	130376	130377	Mrs. Tadman	307	" O , yes , he will , Miss Carley , "
130387	130411	130376	130377	Mrs. Tadman	307	" he 's set his heart on that , and he 's set his heart on the young woman he means to marry . "
130412	130430	130432	130432	Ellen	176	" He ca n't marry her unless she 's willing to be his wife , any how , "
130438	130501	130376	130377	Mrs. Tadman	307	" O , he 'll find a way to make her consent , Miss Carley , depend upon that . Whatever Stephen Whitelaw sets his mind upon , he 'll do . But I do n't envy that poor young woman ; for she 'll have a hard life of it at Wyncomb , and a hard master in my cousin Stephen . "
130502	130521	130522	130522	Ellen	176	" She must be a very weak - minded young woman if she marries him against her will , "
130867	130886	130888	130889	the bailiff	6494	" And if you want a new gown , Nell , I do n't mind giving it you , "
130915	130930	130888	130889	the bailiff	6494	" You can walk over to Malsham and buy it any afternoon you like . "
131094	131109	131110	131110	Ellen	176	" I wo n't give him the trouble to turn me out of doors , "
131115	131186	131188	131189	the girl	5090	" When I know his mind , and that there 's no hope of turning him , I 'll get away quietly , and find some new home . He has no real power over me , and I have but to earn my own living to be independent of him . And I do n't suppose Frank will think any the worse of me for having been a servant , "
131632	131645	131646	131646	she	5090	" But it does concern me to see you downhearted , father , "
131650	131741	131646	131646	she	5090	" Does it really , my girl ? What ! your father 's something more than a stranger to you , is he ? I should n't have thought it , seeing how you 've gone again me in some things lately . Howsomedever , when I want your help , I shall know how to ask for it , and I hope you 'll give it freely . I do n't want fine words ; they never pulled anybody out of the ditch that I 've heard tell of . "
131911	131920	131921	131921	he	463	" You 'll do well enough , lass , "
131924	131995	131921	131921	he	463	" but I should like you to have had something smarter than that blue stuff . I would n't have minded a couple of pounds or so to buy you a silk gown . But you 'll be able to buy yourself as many silk gowns as ever you like by - and - by , if you play your cards well and do n't make a fool of yourself . "
132305	132327	132360	132360	she	176	" However lost you may be for lack of shelter , however weary for want of rest , come not here ! "
132347	132359	132360	132360	she	176	" The place just suits its master 's hard miserly nature , "
132363	132389	132360	132360	she	176	" One would think it had been made on purpose for him ; or perhaps the Whitelaws have been like that from generation to generation . "
133276	133288	133290	133291	Mrs. Tadman	307	" It 's a fine old place , is n't it ? "
133293	133308	133290	133291	Mrs. Tadman	307	" There 's not many farmers can boast of such a house as Wyncomb . "
133309	133315	133316	133316	Ellen	176	" It 's large enough , "
133329	133382	133316	133316	Ellen	176	" but it 's not a place I should like to live in . I 'm not one to believe in ghosts or such nonsense , but if I could have any such foolish thoughts , I should have them here . The house looks as if it was haunted , somehow . "
133402	133413	133414	133414	she	307	" You 're not easy to please , Miss Carley , "
133417	133562	133414	133414	she	307	" most folks think a deal of Wyncomb ; for , you see , it 's only them that live in a house as can know how dull it is ; and as to the place being haunted , I never heard tell of anything of that kind . The Whitelaws ai n't the kind of people to come back to this world , unless they come to fetch their money , and then they 'd come fast enough , I warrant . I used to see a good deal of my uncle , John Whitelaw , when I was a girl , and never did a son take after his father closer than my cousin Stephen takes after him ; just the same saving prudent ways , and just the same masterful temper , always kept under in that quiet way of his . "
133620	133636	133637	133637	she	307	" There 's the attics above ; but you wo n't care to see them , "
133640	133777	133637	133637	she	307	" The shepherd and five other men sleep up there . Stephen thinks it keeps them steadier sleeping under the same roof with their master ; and he 's able to ring them up of a morning , and to know when they go to their work . It 's wearying for me to have to get up and see to their breakfasts , but I ca n't trust Martha Holden to do that , or she 'd let them eat us out of house and home . There 's no knowing what men like that can eat , and a side of bacon would go as fast as if you was to melt it down to tallow . But you must know what they are , Miss Carley , having to manage for your father . "
133778	133781	133782	133782	Ellen	176	" Yes , "
133785	133793	133782	133782	Ellen	176	" I 'm used to hard work . "
133794	133797	133799	133800	the matron	677	" Ah , "
133806	133819	133799	133800	the matron	677	" you 'd have plenty of it , if you came here . "
133933	133942	133944	133945	Mrs. Tadman	307	" There 's nothing more to see here , "
133948	133986	133944	133945	Mrs. Tadman	307	" I had better go back . I do n't know what brought me here ; it was talking , I suppose , made me come without thinking . There 's nothing to show you this way . "
133987	133995	133996	133996	Ellen	176	" But there 's another room there , "
134016	134069	133996	133996	Ellen	176	" That room well , yes ; it 's a kind of a room , but has n't been used for fifty years and more , I 've heard say . Stephen keeps seeds there and such - like . It 's always locked , and he keeps the key of it . "
134111	134114	134115	134115	she	176	" Hark ! "
134125	134131	134115	134115	she	176	" did you hear that ? "
134132	134137	134101	134101	she	176	" What , child ? "
134138	134151	134115	134115	she	176	" Did you say there was no one in there no one ? "
134152	134183	134101	134101	she	176	" Lord bless your heart , no , Miss Carley , nor ever is . What a turn you did give me , grasping hold of my arm like that ! "
134184	134199	134115	134115	she	176	" I heard something in there a footstep . It must be the servant . "
134200	134237	134101	134101	she	176	" What , Martha Holden ! I should like to see her venturing into any room Stephen keeps private to himself . Besides , that door 's kept locked ; try it , and satisfy yourself . "
134269	134279	134280	134280	she	176	" Is there no other door to the room ? "
134283	134329	134115	134115	she	176	" None ; and only one window , that looks into the wood - yard , and is almost always blocked up with the wood piled outside it . You must have heard the muslin bags of seed blowing about , if you heard anything . "
134330	134336	134338	134338	Ellen	176	" I heard a footstep , "
134341	134357	134338	134338	Ellen	176	" a human footstep . I told you the house was haunted , Mrs. Tadman . "
134358	134414	134115	134115	she	176	" Lor , Miss Carley , I wish you would n't say such things ; it 's enough to make one 's blood turn cold . Do come downstairs and have a cup of tea . It 's quite dark , I declare ; and you 've given me the shivers with your queer talk . "
134415	134444	134338	134338	Ellen	176	" I 'm sorry for that ; but the noise I heard must have been either real or ghostly , and you wo n't believe it 's real . "
134445	134456	134115	134115	she	176	" It was the seed - bags , of course . "
134457	134489	134338	134338	Ellen	176	" They could n't make a noise like human footsteps . However , it 's no business of mine , Mrs. Tadman , and I do n't want to frighten you . "
134753	134759	134737	134737	he	269	" WHAT MUST BE SHALL BE "
134891	134910	134911	134911	she	176	" If I have to go out of this house to - night , I will not flinch , "
135042	135050	135051	135051	she	176	" It 's very late , father , "
135072	135092	135051	135051	she	176	" If you do n't want me for anything particular , I should be glad to go to bed . "
135093	135100	135101	135101	he	6494	" Would you , my lass ? "
135105	135140	135141	135141	he	6494	" But , you see , I do want you for something particular , something uncommon particular ; so there 's no call for you to be in a hurry . Sit down yonder , "
135152	135165	135141	135141	he	6494	" I 've got something to say to you , something serious . "
135166	135169	135171	135172	the girl	5090	" Father , "
135190	135206	135171	135172	the girl	5090	" I do n't think you 're in a state to talk seriously of anything . "
135207	135278	135171	135172	the girl	5090	" O , you do n't , do n't you , Miss Impudence ? You think I 'm drunk , perhaps . You 'll find that , drunk or sober , I 've only one mind about you , and that I mean to be obeyed . Sit down , I tell you . I 'm not in the humour to stand any nonsense to - night . Sit down . "
135380	135385	135386	135386	he	463	" Well , Nelly , "
135389	135419	135386	135386	he	463	" you 've had a rare day at Wyncomb , and a regular ramble over the old house with Steph 's cousin . What do you think of it ? "
135420	135487	135345	135345	he	463	" I think it 's a queer gloomy old place enough , father . I wonder there 's any one can live in it . The dark bare - looking rooms gave me the horrors . I used to think this house was dull , and seemed as if it was haunted ; but it 's lively and gay as can be , compared to Wyncomb . "
135488	135491	135493	135494	the bailiff	6494	" Humph ! "
135496	135609	135493	135494	the bailiff	6494	" You 're a fanciful young lady , Miss Nell , and do n't know a fine substantial old house when you see one . Life 's come a little too easy to you , perhaps . It might have been better for you if you 'd seen more of the rough side . Being your own missus too soon , and missus of such a place as this , has spoiled you a bit . I tell you , Nell , there ai n't a better house in Hampshire than Wyncomb , though it may n't suit your fanciful notions . Do you know the size of Stephen Whitelaw 's farm ? "
135610	135622	135345	135345	he	463	" No , father ; I 've never thought about it . "
135623	135641	135493	135494	the bailiff	6494	" What do you say to three hundred acres over three hundred , nigher to four perhaps ? "
135642	135661	135345	135345	he	463	" I suppose it 's a large farm , father . But I know nothing about such things . "
135662	135677	135679	135680	the bailiff	6494	" You suppose it 's large , and you know nothing about such things ! "
135689	135792	135679	135680	the bailiff	6494	" I do n't believe any man was ever plagued with such an aggravating daughter as mine . What do you say to being mistress of such a place , girl ? mistress of close upon four hundred acres of land ; not another man 's servant , bound to account for every blade of grass and every ear of corn , as I am , but free and independent mistress of the place , with the chance of being left a widow by and by , and having it all under your own thumb ; what do you say to that ? "
135793	135820	135345	135345	he	463	" Only the same that I have always said , father . Nothing would ever persuade me to marry Stephen Whitelaw . I 'd rather starve . "
135821	135833	135835	135836	William Carley	270	" And you shall starve , if you stick to that , "
135842	135901	135835	135836	William Carley	270	" But you wo n't be such a fool , Nell . You 'll hear reason ; you wo n't stand out against your poor old father and against your own interests . The long and the short of it is , I 've given Whitelaw my promise that you shall be his wife between this and Easter . "
135902	135905	135907	135907	Ellen	176	" What ! "
135916	135935	135907	135907	Ellen	176	" you do n't mean that you 've promised that , father ! You ca n't mean it ! "
135936	135946	135345	135345	he	463	" I can and do mean it , lass . "
135947	135985	135907	135907	Ellen	176	" Then you 've made a promise that will never be kept . You might have known as much when you made it . I 'm sure I 've been plain - spoken enough about Stephen Whitelaw . "
135986	136043	135345	135345	he	463	" That was a girl 's silly talk . I did n't think to find you a fool when I came to the point . I let you have your say , and looked to time to bring you to reason . Come , Nell , you 're not going against your father , are you ? "
136044	136073	135907	135907	Ellen	176	" I must , father , in this . I 'd rather die twenty deaths than marry that man . There 's nothing I would n't rather do . "
136074	136097	135345	135345	he	463	" Is n't there ? You 'd rather see your father in gaol , I suppose , if it came to that ? "
136098	136104	136106	136107	the girl	5090	" See you in gaol ! "
136110	136148	136149	136149	she	5090	" For heaven 's sake , what do you mean , father ? What fear is there of your being sent to prison , because I wo n't marry Stephen Whitelaw ? I 'm not a baby , "
136157	136166	136149	136149	she	5090	" you ca n't frighten me like that . "
136167	136363	135345	135345	he	463	" No ; you 're a very wise young woman , I daresay ; but you do n't know everything . You 've seen me downhearted and out of sorts for this last half - year ; but I do n't suppose you 've troubled yourself much about it , except to worry me with silly questions sometimes , when I 've not been in the humour to be talked to . Things have been going wrong with me ever since hay - harvest , and I have n't sent Sir David sixpence yet for last year 's crops . I 've put him off with one excuse after another from month to month . He 's a careless master enough at most times , and never over - sharp with my accounts . But the time has come when I ca n't put him off any longer . He wants money badly , he says ; and I 'm afraid he begins to suspect something . Any way , he talks of coming here in a week or so to look into things for himself . If he does that , I 'm ruined . "
136364	136388	136149	136149	she	5090	" But the money , father the money for the crops how has it gone ? You had it , have n't you ? "
136389	136392	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" Yes , "
136400	136409	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" I 've had it , worse luck . "
136410	136417	136149	136149	she	5090	" And how has it gone ? "
136418	136538	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" What 's that to you ? What 's the good of my muddling my brains with figures to - night ? It 's gone , I tell you . You know I 'm fond of seeing a race , and never miss anything in that way that comes - off within a day 's drive of this place . I used to be pretty lucky once upon a time , when I backed a horse or bet against one . But this year things have gone dead against me ; and my bad luck made me savage somehow , so that I went deeper than I 've been before , thinking to get back what I 'd lost . "
136539	136557	136149	136149	she	5090	" O , father , father ! how could you , and with another man 's money ? "
136558	136568	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" Do n't give me any of your preaching , "
136574	136604	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" I can get enough of that at Malsham Chapel if I want it . It 's in your power to pull me through this business if you choose . "
136605	136614	136149	136149	she	5090	" How can I do that , father ? "
136615	136676	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" A couple of hundred pounds will set me square . I do n't say there has n't been more taken , first and last ; but that would do it . Stephen Whitelaw would lend me the money give it me , indeed , for it comes to that the day he gets your consent to be his wife . "
136677	136692	136693	136694	the girl	5090	" And you 'd sell me to him for two hundred pounds , father ? "
136698	136708	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" I do n't want to go to gaol . "
136709	136725	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" And if you do n't get the money from Stephen , what will happen ? "
136726	136756	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" I ca n't tell you that to a nicety . Penal servitude for life , most likely . They 'd call mine a bad case , I daresay . "
136757	136777	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" But Sir David might be merciful to you , father . You 've served him for along time . "
136778	136858	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" What would he care for that ? I 've had his money , and he 's not a man that can afford to lose much . No , Nell , I look for no mercy from Sir David ; those careless easy - going men are generally the hardest in such a business as this . It 's a clear case of embezzlement , and nothing can save me unless I can raise money enough to satisfy him . "
136859	136873	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" Could n't you borrow it of some one else besides Stephen Whitelaw ? "
136874	136907	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" Who else is there that would lend me two hundred pounds ? Ask yourself that , girl . Why , I have n't five pounds ' worth of security to offer . "
136908	136921	136393	136394	the bailiff	6494	" And Mr. Whitelaw will only lend the money upon one condition ? "
136922	136928	136930	136931	William Carley	270	" No , curse him ! "
136934	137013	136930	136931	William Carley	270	" I 've been at him all this afternoon , when you and that woman were out of the room , trying to get it out of him as a loan , without waiting for your promise ; but he 's too cautious for that . ' The day Ellen gives her consent , you shall have the money , ' he told me ; ' I ca n't say anything fairer than that or more liberal . ' "
137014	137029	137030	137030	Ellen	176	" He does n't suspect why you want it , does he , father ? "
137039	137055	137057	137058	the bailiff	6494	" Who can tell what he may suspect ? He 's as deep as Satan , "
137083	137121	137065	137065	his	6494	" He knows that I want the money very badly ; I could n't help his knowing that ; and he must think it 's something out of the common that makes me want two hundred pounds . "
137122	137130	137131	137131	Ellen	176	" I daresay he guesses the truth , "
137247	137254	137255	137255	Ellen	176	" Is there no other way ? "
137266	137273	137255	137255	Ellen	176	" no other way , father ? "
137274	137277	137279	137280	William Carley	270	" None , "
137282	137437	137279	137280	William Carley	270	" You need n't ask me that question again ; there is no other way ; you can get me out of my difficulties if you choose . I should never have been so venturesome as I was , if I had n't made sure my daughter would soon be a rich woman . You can save me if you like , or you can hold - off and let me go to prison . There 's no good preaching about it or arguing about it ; you 've got the choice and you must make it . Most young women in your place would think themselves uncommon lucky to have such a chance as you 've got , instead of making a trouble about it , let alone being able to get their father out of a scrape . But you 're your own mistress , and you must do as you please . "
137438	137446	137447	137448	the girl	5090	" Let me have time to think , "
137452	137480	137481	137481	she	5090	" let me have only a little time to think , father . And you do believe that I 'm sorry for you , do n't you ? "
137493	137503	137481	137481	she	5090	" O father , I hope you believe that ! "
137504	137521	137522	137523	the bailiff	6494	" I shall know what to believe when I know what you 're going to do , "
137709	137716	137717	137717	she	5090	" Am I to read this ? "
137721	137737	137717	137717	she	5090	" Yes , read it , and see what I 've got to look to . "
137952	137962	137963	137963	she	176	" It must be as you wish , father , "
137967	137996	137963	137963	she	176	" there is no help for it ; I can not see you brought to disgrace . Stephen Whitelaw must have the price he asks for his money . "
137997	138004	138006	138007	the bailiff	6494	" That 's a good lass , "
138029	138066	138026	138026	his	6494	" that 's bravely spoken , Nell , and you never need repent the choice that 'll make you mistress of Wyncomb Farm , with a good home to give your father in his old age . "
138212	138222	138224	138225	the physician	3530	" If we could keep the mind at rest , "
138227	138291	138224	138225	the physician	3530	" we should have every chance of doing better ; but this constant restlessness , this hyper - activity of the brain , of which you and Mr. Mew tell me , must needs make a perpetual demand upon the patient 's physical powers . The waste is always going on . We can not look for recovery until we obtain more repose . "
138488	138496	138497	138497	he	3540	" I want to see your master , "
138518	138542	138510	138511	The clerk	5975	" I beg your pardon , sir , I do n't think Mr. Medler 's in ; but I 'll go and see . "
138543	138578	138510	138511	The clerk	5975	" You need n't give yourself the trouble . I saw your master let himself in at this door a minute ago . I suppose you were too busy to hear him come in . "
138592	138610	138579	138580	The clerk	5975	" Upon my word , sir , I believe he 's out ; but I 'll see . "
138611	138624	138625	138625	Gilbert	178	" Thanks ; I 'd rather see myself , if you please , "
138703	138708	138861	138862	Mr. Medler	276	" on the listen . "
138709	138717	138718	138718	Gilbert	178	" Good - morning , Mr. Medler , "
138722	138747	138718	138718	Gilbert	178	" your clerk had such a conviction of your being out , that I had some difficulty in convincing him you were at home . "
138748	138764	138662	138662	his	276	" I 've only just come in ; I suppose Lucas did n't hear me . "
138765	138798	138718	138718	Gilbert	178	" I suppose not ; I 've been here twice before in search of you , as I conclude you have been told . I have expected to hear from you daily . "
138799	138805	138807	138808	the lawyer	5706	" Well , yes yes , "
138814	138827	138807	138808	the lawyer	5706	" I am aware that I promised to write under certain circumstances . "
138828	138860	138718	138718	Gilbert	178	" Am I to conclude , then , that you were silent because you had nothing to communicate ? that you have obtained no tidings of any kind respecting Mrs. Holbrook ? "
138878	138887	138888	138888	he	276	" Why , you see , Mr. Fenton , "
138905	138958	138888	138888	he	276	" when I made that promise with reference to Mrs. Holbrook , I made it of course without prejudice to the interests or inclinations of my client . I might be free to communicate to you any information I received upon this subject or I might find myself pledged to withhold it . "
138967	138970	138971	138971	he	178	" What ! "
138974	139011	138971	138971	he	178	" do you mean to say that you have solved the mystery of Marian Holbrook 's fate ? that you know her to be alive safe well , and have kept back the knowledge from me ? "
139012	139057	138959	138959	Gilbert	178	" I have been compelled to submit to the wishes of my client . I will not say that I have not offered considerable opposition to her desire upon this point , but finding her resolution fixed , I was bound to respect it . "
139058	139075	138971	138971	he	178	" She is safe then all this alarm has been needless ? You have seen her ? "
139076	139087	138959	138959	Gilbert	178	" Yes , Mr. Fenton , I have seen her . "
139088	139128	138971	138971	he	178	" And she she forbade you to let me know of her safety ? She was willing that I should suffer all the anguish of uncertainty as to her fate ? I could not have believed her so unkind . "
139129	139159	138959	138959	Gilbert	178	" Mrs. Holbrook had especial reasons for wishing to avoid all communication with former acquaintances . She explained those reasons to me , and I fully concurred in them . "
139160	139181	138971	138971	he	178	" She might have such reasons with regard to other people ; she could have none with reference to me . "
139182	139196	138959	138959	Gilbert	178	" Pardon me , she mentioned your name in a very particular manner . "
139197	139211	138971	138971	he	178	" And yet she has had good cause to trust in my fidelity . "
139212	139256	138959	138959	Gilbert	178	" She has a very great respect and esteem for you , I am aware . She said as much to me . But her reasons for keeping her affairs to herself just now are quite apart from her personal feeling for yourself . "
139257	139282	138971	138971	he	178	" I can not understand this . I am not to see her then , I suppose ; not to be told her address ? "
139283	139298	138959	138959	Gilbert	178	" No ; I am strictly forbidden to disclose her address to any one . "
139299	139316	138971	138971	he	178	" Yet you can positively assure me that she is in safety her own mistress happy ? "
139317	139364	138959	138959	Gilbert	178	" She is in perfect safety her own mistress and as happy as it is possible she can be under the unfortunate circumstances of her married life . She has left her husband for ever ; I will venture to tell you so much as that . "
139365	139374	138971	138971	he	178	" I am quite aware of that fact . "
139375	139389	138959	138959	Gilbert	178	" How so ? I thought Mr. Holbrook was quite unknown to you ? "
139390	139401	138971	138971	he	178	" I have learnt a good deal about him lately . "
139402	139405	139407	139408	the lawyer	5706	" Indeed ! "
139417	139436	139437	139437	Gilbert	178	" But of course your client has been perfectly frank in her communications with you upon this subject ? "
139440	139549	139437	139437	Gilbert	178	" Yes ; I know that Mrs. Holbrook has left her husband , but I did not for a moment suppose she had left him of her own free will . From my knowledge of her character and sentiments , that is just the last thing I could have imagined possible . There was no quarrel between them ; indeed , she was expecting his return with delight at the very time when she left her home in Hampshire . The thought of sharing her fortune with him was one of perfect happiness . How can you explain her abrupt flight from him in the face of this ? "
139550	139562	139564	139565	the lawyer	5706	" I am not free to explain matters , Mr. Fenton , "
139567	139588	139564	139565	the lawyer	5706	" you must be satisfied with the knowledge that the lady about whom you have been so anxious is safe . "
139589	139596	139597	139597	Gilbert	178	" I thank God for that , "
139601	139647	139597	139597	Gilbert	178	" but that , knowledge of itself is not quite enough . I shall be uneasy so long as there is this secrecy and mystery surrounding her fate . There is something in this sudden abandonment of her husband which is painfully inexplicable to me . "
139648	139701	139564	139565	the lawyer	5706	" Mrs. Holbrook may have received some sudden revelation of her husband 's unworthiness . You are aware that a letter reached her a few hours before she left Hampshire ? There is no doubt that letter influenced her actions . I do not mind admitting a fact which is so obvious . "
139702	139721	139597	139597	Gilbert	178	" The revelation that could move her to such a step must have been a very startling one . "
139722	139732	139734	139735	the lawyer	5706	" It was strong enough to decide her course , "
139738	139751	139752	139752	Gilbert	178	" And you can assure me that she is in good hands ? "
139756	139771	139752	139752	Gilbert	178	" I have every reason to suppose so . She is with her father . "
139792	139795	139796	139796	he	178	" What ! "
139862	139862	139856	139857	Percival Nowell	201	"
139863	139901	139931	139932	the lawyer	5706	" A very short time ago . I have only been aware of his return within the last two or three weeks . His first step on arriving in this country was to seek for his daughter . "
139902	139916	139856	139857	Percival Nowell	201	" Yes ; when he knew that she was rich , no doubt . "
139917	139930	139931	139932	the lawyer	5706	" I do not think that he was influenced by mercenary motives , "
139941	139993	139931	139932	the lawyer	5706	" Of course , as a man of the world , I am not given to look at such matters from a sentimental point of view . But I really believe that Mr. Nowell was anxious to find his daughter , and to atone in some measure for his former neglect . "
139994	140000	140002	140002	Gilbert	178	" A very convenient repentance , "
140010	140052	140002	140002	Gilbert	178	" And his first act is to steal his daughter from her home , and hide her from all her former friends . I do n't like the look of this business , Mr. Medler ; I tell you so frankly . "
140053	140084	139931	139932	the lawyer	5706	" Mr. Nowell is my client , you must remember , Mr. Fenton . I can not consent to listen to any aspersion of his character , direct or indirect . "
140085	140101	140002	140002	Gilbert	178	" And you positively refuse to tell me where Mrs. Holbrook is to be found ? "
140102	140118	139931	139932	the lawyer	5706	" I am compelled to respect her wishes as well as those of her father . "
140119	140133	140002	140002	Gilbert	178	" She has been placed in possession of her property , I suppose ? "
140134	140165	139931	139932	the lawyer	5706	" Yes ; her grandfather 's will has been proved , and the estate now stands in her name . There was no difficulty about that no reason for delay . "
140166	140177	140178	140178	Gilbert	178	" Will you tell me if she is in London ? "
140182	140202	139931	139932	the lawyer	5706	" Pardon me , my dear sir , I am pledged to say nothing about Mrs. Holbrook 's whereabouts . "
140209	140225	140226	140226	he	178	" Well , I suppose it is useless to press the question , Mr. Medler , "
140229	140350	140226	140226	he	178	" I can only repeat that I do n't like the look of this business . Your client , Mr. Nowell , must have a very strong reason for secrecy , and my experience of life has shown me that there is very seldom mystery without wrong doing of some kind behind it . I thank God that Mrs. Holbrook is safe , for I suppose I must accept your assurance that she is so ; but until her position is relieved from all this secrecy , I shall not cease to feel uneasy as to her welfare . I am glad , however , that the issue of events has exonerated her husband from any part in her disappearance . "
140594	140600	140601	140601	Gilbert	178	" I must find her , "
140606	140629	140601	140601	Gilbert	178	" I must be certain that she is in safe hands . I shall know no rest till I have found her . "
140846	140849	140850	140850	he	243	" O ! "
140857	140874	140850	140850	he	243	" it 's you , is it , sir ? I thought it was a customer . "
140875	140905	140973	140974	Mr. Tulliver	243	" I am sorry to disappoint your expectation of profit . I have looked in to ask you two or three questions , Mr. Tulliver ; that is all . "
140906	140934	140850	140850	he	243	" Any information in my power I 'm sure I shall be happy to afford , sir . Wo n't you be pleased to take a seat ? "
140935	140952	140953	140953	Gilbert	178	" How long is it since you saw Mr. Nowell , your former employer 's son ? "
141000	141017	141018	141018	he	178	" How long is it since I 've seen Mr. Nowell Mr. Percival Nowell , sir ? "
141027	141049	141018	141018	he	178	" Yes ; you need not be afraid to speak freely to me ; I know Mr. Nowell is in London . "
141050	141067	141018	141018	he	178	" Well , sir , I 've not seen him often since his father 's death . "
141167	141181	141152	141152	Gilbert	178	" Not often since your master 's death : but how often before ? "
141182	141233	141152	141152	Gilbert	178	" Well , he used to come in pretty often before the old man died ; but they were both of 'em precious close . Mr. Percival never let out that he was my master 's son , but I guessed as much before he 'd been here many times . "
141234	141245	141152	141152	Gilbert	178	" How was it that I never came across him ? "
141246	141286	141152	141152	Gilbert	178	" Chance , I suppose ; but he 's a deep one . If you 'd happened to come in when he was here , I daresay he 'd have contrived to slip away somehow without your seeing him . "
141287	141295	141297	141297	Gilbert	178	" When did he come here last ? "
141299	141355	141152	141152	Gilbert	178	" About a fortnight ago . He came with Mr. Medler , the lawyer , who introduced him formally as my master 's son ; and they took possession of the place between them for Mrs. Holbrook , making an arrangement with me to carry on the business , and making precious hard terms too . "
141356	141379	141152	141152	Gilbert	178	" Have you seen Mrs. Holbrook since that morning when she left London for Hampshire , immediately after her grandfather 's death ? "
141380	141449	141152	141152	Gilbert	178	" Never set eyes on her since then ; but she 's in London , they told me , living with her father . She came up to claim the property . I say , the husband must be rather a curious party , must n't he , to stand that kind of thing , and part company with her just when she 's come into a fortune ? "
141450	141485	141152	141152	Gilbert	178	" Have you any notion where Mrs. Holbrook or her father is to be found ? I should be glad to make you a handsome present if you could enlighten me upon that point . "
141486	141560	141152	141152	Gilbert	178	" I wish I could , sir . No , I have n't the least idea where the gentleman hangs out . Oysters ai n't closer than that party . I thought he 'd get his paw upon his father 's money , somehow , when I used to see him hanging about this place . But I do n't believe the old man ever meant him to have a sixpence of it . "
141932	141941	141942	141942	she	5214	" How do you do , Mr. Fenton , "
141954	141974	141942	141942	she	5214	" What an age since I have seen you ! But you have not forgotten me , I hope ? "
141975	142017	142098	142099	Mrs. Branston	214	" That is quite impossible , Mrs. Branston . If I had not been very much absorbed in thought just now , I should have recognised you sooner . It was very kind of you to stop to speak to me . "
142018	142072	141942	141942	she	5214	" Not at all . I have something most particular to say to you . If you are not in a very great hurry , would you mind getting into the carriage , and letting me drive you round the Park ? I ca n't keep you standing in the road to talk . "
142073	142097	142098	142099	Mrs. Branston	214	" I am in no especial hurry , and I shall be most happy to take a turn round the Park with you . "
142140	142164	142172	142172	her	1660	" I have been expecting to see you for ever so long , Mr. Fenton . Why do you never call upon me ? "
142176	142209	142172	142172	her	1660	" I have been so closely occupied lately ; and even if I had not been so , I should have scarcely expected to find you in town at this unfashionable season . "
142210	142223	142224	142225	Mrs. Branston	214	" I do n't care the least in the world for fashion , "
142236	142296	142298	142299	the widow	5832	" That is only an excuse of yours , Mr. Fenton ; you completely forgot my existence , I have no doubt . All my friends desert me now - a - days older friends than you . There is Mr. Saltram , for instance . I have not seen him for O , not for ever so long , "
142481	142501	142502	142502	he	178	" You will not wonder that Mr. Saltram has not called upon you lately when you know the truth , "
142506	142513	142502	142502	he	178	" he has been very ill . "
142527	142535	142514	142515	Mrs. Branston	214	" Very ill that means dangerously ill ? "
142536	142576	142514	142515	Mrs. Branston	214	" Yes ; for some time he was in great danger . I believe that is past now ; but I am not quite sure of his safety even yet . I can only hope that he may recover . "
142758	142770	142771	142771	she	214	" Do let me see him , if it is possible , "
142774	142787	142771	142771	she	214	" it would be such a comfort to me to see him . "
142788	142815	142731	142732	John Saltram	246	" I do not say such a thing is not possible , my dear Mrs. Branston ; but I am sure it would be very foolish . "
142816	142856	142771	142771	she	214	" O , never mind that ; I am always doing foolish things . It would only be one folly more , and would hardly count in my history . Dear Mr. Fenton , do let me see him . "
142857	142953	142731	142732	John Saltram	246	" I do n't think you quite know what you are asking , Mrs. Branston . Such a sick - bed as John Saltram 's would be a most painful scene for you . He has been delirious from the beginning of his illness , and is so still . He rarely has an interval of anything like consciousness , and in all the time that I have been with him has never yet recognised me ; indeed , there are moments when I am inclined to fear that his brain may be permanently deranged . "
142954	142958	142960	142960	Adela	212	" God forbid ! "
142971	143025	142731	142732	John Saltram	246	" Yes , such a result as that would be indeed a sore calamity . I have every wish to set your mind at ease , believe me , Mrs. Branston , but in John Saltram 's present state I am sure it would be ill - advised for you to see him . "
143026	143040	143041	143041	Adela	212	" Of course I can not press the question if you say that , "
143045	143098	143041	143041	Adela	212	" but I should have been so glad if you could have allowed me to see him . Not that I pretend to the smallest right to do so ; but we were very good friends once before my husband 's death . He has changed to me strangely since that time . "
143157	143170	143171	143171	he	178	" There may be a reason for that change , Mrs. Branston , "
143174	143193	143171	143171	he	178	" Mr. Saltram may have formed some tie of a kind to withdraw him from all other friendships . "
143194	143201	143203	143204	the widow	5832	" Some attachment , you mean ! "
143211	143222	143203	143204	the widow	5832	" she added , forgetting how much the words betrayed . "
143247	143247	143232	143232	you	178	"
143248	143268	143232	143232	you	178	" I have some reason to suspect as much , from words that he has dropped during his delirium . "
143315	143325	143326	143326	she	6090	" Have you any idea who the lady is ? "
143343	143349	143326	143326	she	6090	" I have some idea . "
143350	143362	143326	143326	she	6090	" It is no one whom I know , I suppose ? "
143363	143373	143326	143326	she	6090	" The lady is quite a stranger to you . "
143374	143381	143382	143382	she	6090	" He might have trusted me , "
143386	143399	143382	143382	she	6090	" it would have been kinder in him to have trusted me . "
143400	143430	143326	143326	she	6090	" Yes , Mrs. Branston ; but Mr. Saltram has unfortunately made concealment the policy of his life . He will find it a false policy sooner or late . "
143431	143478	143382	143382	she	6090	" It was very cruel of him not to tell me the truth . He might have known that I should look kindly upon any one he cared for . I may be a very foolish woman , Mr. Fenton , but I am not ungenerous . "
143479	143486	143487	143487	Gilbert	178	" I am sure of that , "
143496	143514	143515	143515	Adela	212	" You must let me know every day how your friend is going on , Mr. Fenton , "
143521	143536	143515	143515	Adela	212	" I shall consider it a very great favour if you will do so . "
143537	143543	143515	143515	Adela	212	" I will not fail . "
143786	143794	143795	143795	she	212	" If he had only trusted me , "
143807	143889	143795	143795	she	212	" if he had only given me credit for some little good sense and generosity , I should not feel it as keenly as I do . He must have known that I loved him yes , I have been weak enough to let him see that and I think that once he used to like me a little in those old happy days when he came so often to Maidenhead . Yes , I believe he almost loved me then . "
144189	144488	144182	144182	himself	177	" I make no doubt , Miss Carley , that you have taken notice for some time past of my sentiments towards yourself . I have never made any secret of those sentiments , neither have I talked much about them , not being a man of many words . I used to fancy myself the very reverse of a marrying man , and I do n't say but what at this moment I think the man who lives and dies a bachelor does the wisest for his own comfort and his own prosperity . But we are not the masters of our feelings , Miss Carley . You have growed upon me lately somehow , so that I 've got not to care for my life without you . Ask Mrs. Tadman if my appetite has n't fell off within this last six months to a degree that has frightened her ; and a man of my regular habits must be very far gone in love , Miss Carley , when his appetite forsakes him . From the time I came to know you as a young woman , in the bloom of a young woman 's beauty , I said to myself , ' That 's the girl I 'll marry , and no other . ' Your father can bear me out in that , for I said the same to him . And finding that I had his approval , I was satisfied to bide my time , and wait till you came round to the same way of thinking . Your father tells me yesterday afternoon , and again this afternoon , that you have come round to that way of feeling . I hope he has n't deceived me , Miss Carley . "
144629	144635	144637	144638	the former	948	" Come , Miss Carley , "
144653	144677	144637	144638	the former	948	" I want to get an answer direct from your own lips . Your father has n't been deceiving me , has he ? "
144678	144681	144682	144682	Ellen	176	" No , "
144703	144736	144737	144737	she	176	" If my father has given you a promise for me , I will keep it . But I do n't want to deceive you , on my part , Mr. Whitelaw , "
144746	144792	144737	144737	she	176	" I will be your wife , since you and my father have settled that it must be so ; but I can promise no more than that . I will be dutiful and submissive to you as a wife , you may be sure only "
144838	144931	144828	144829	The bailiff	6494	" Lord bless the girl , what need is there of all this talk about what she will be and what she wo n't be ? She 'll be as good a wife as any woman in England , I 'll stake my life upon that . She 's been a good daughter , as all the world knows , and a good daughter is bound to make a good wife . Say no more about it , Nell . Stephen Whitelaw knows he 'll make no bad bargain in marrying you . "
144947	144955	144956	144956	he	3092	" Very likely not , William Carley , "
144959	145032	144956	144956	he	3092	" but it is n't every man that can make your daughter mistress of such a place as Wyncomb ; and such men as could do it would look for money with a wife , however young and pretty she might be . There 's two sides to a bargain , you see , William , and I should like things to be looked at in that light between you and me . "
145033	145044	145046	145047	the bailiff	6494	" You 've no call to take offence , Steph , "
145053	145087	145046	145047	the bailiff	6494	" I never said you was n't a good match for my girl ; but a pretty girl and a prudent clever housekeeper like Nell is a fortune in herself to any man . "
145088	145098	145100	145101	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" Then the matter 's settled , I suppose , "
145103	145157	145100	145101	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" and the sooner the wedding comes off the better , to my mind . If my wife that is to be wants anything in the way of new clothes , I shall be happy to put down a twenty - pound note or I 'd go as far as thirty towards 'em . "
145164	145170	145171	145171	she	176	" I want nothing new , "
145174	145186	145171	145171	she	176	" I have as many things as I care to have . "
145187	145192	145206	145206	his	463	" Nonsense , Nell , "
145229	145299	145194	145195	her father	463	" Every young woman likes new gowns , and of course you 'll take Steph 's friendly offer , and thank him kindly for it . He knows that I 'm pretty hard - up just now , and wo n't be able to do much for you ; and it would n't do for Mrs. Whitelaw of Wyncomb to begin the world with a shabby turn - out . "
145300	145305	145307	145308	the farmer	3092	" Of course not , "
145310	145388	145307	145308	the farmer	3092	" I 'll bring you the cash to - morrow evening , Nell ; and the sooner you buy your wedding - gown the better . There 's nothing to wait for , you see . I 've got a good home to take you to . Mother Tadman will march , of course , between this and my wedding - day . I sha'n't want her when I 've a wife to keep house for me . "
145389	145394	145396	145397	the bailiff	6494	" Of course not , "
145399	145417	145396	145397	the bailiff	6494	" Relations are always dangerous about a place ready to make mischief at every hand 's turn . "
145418	145457	145307	145308	the farmer	3092	" O , Mr. Whitelaw , you wo n't turn her out , surely your own flesh and blood , and after so many years of service . She told me how hard she had worked for you . "
145458	145467	145469	145470	the farmer	3092	" Ah , that 's just like her , "
145472	145492	145469	145470	the farmer	3092	" I give her a comfortable home for all these years , and then she grumbles about the work . "
145493	145499	145501	145501	Ellen	176	" She did n't grumble , "
145504	145516	145501	145501	Ellen	176	" She only told me how faithfully she had served you . "
145517	145552	145307	145308	the farmer	3092	" Yes ; that comes to the same thing . I should have thought you would have liked to be mistress of your house , Nell , without any one to interfere with you . "
145553	145561	145563	145563	Ellen	176	" Mrs. Tadman is nothing to me , "
145577	145592	145563	145563	Ellen	176	" but I should n't like her to be unfairly treated on my account . "
145593	145618	145307	145308	the farmer	3092	" Well , we 'll think about it , Nell ; there 's no hurry . She 's worth her salt , I daresay . "
145775	145787	145788	145788	he	177	" I 'm as good as my word , you see , "
145797	145842	145788	145788	he	177	" There 's the favour you asked me for ; I 'll take your IOU for it presently , if it 's all the same to you as a matter of form and to be given back to you upon my wedding - day . "
146089	146096	146097	146097	she	176	" The daughter of a thief ! "
146102	146122	146097	146097	she	176	" How he would despise himself for having ever loved me , if he knew me to be that ! "
146342	146353	146354	146354	he	322	" It 's a watching business , you see sir , "
146358	146419	146354	146354	he	322	" and is pretty sure to be tedious . I may put a man to hang about this Mr. Medler 's business all day and every day for a month at a stretch , and he may miss his customer at the last , especially as you ca n't give me any kind of description of the man you want . "
146420	146450	146354	146354	he	322	" Surely your agent could get some information out of Medler 's clerk ; it 's in his trade to do that kind of thing , is n't it ? "
146451	146501	146354	146354	he	322	" Well , yes , sir ; I do n't deny that I might put a man on to the clerk , and it might answer . On the other hand , such a gentleman 's clerk would be likely to be uncommon well trained and uncommon little trusted . "
146502	146511	146512	146512	Gilbert	178	" But we want to know so little , "
146516	146529	146512	146512	Gilbert	178	" only where this man lives , and who lives with him . "
146530	146533	146535	146536	Mr. Proul	322	" Yes , "
146543	146732	146535	146536	Mr. Proul	322	" it ai n't much , as you say , and it might be got out of the clerk , if the clerk knows it ; but as to Mrs. Holbrook having got away from Hampshire and come to London , that 's more than I can believe . I worked that business harder and closer than ever I worked any business yet . You told me to spare neither money nor time , and I did n't spare either ; though it was more a question of time than money , for my expenses were light enough , as you know . I do n't believe Mrs. Holbrook could have got away from Malsham station up to the time when I left Hampshire . I 'm pretty certain she could n't have left the place any other way than by rail ; I 'm more than certain she could n't have been living anywhere in the neighbourhood when I was hunting for her . In short , it comes to this I stick to my old opinion , that the poor lady was drowned in Malsham river . "
146778	146802	146803	146803	he	178	" We have this man Medler 's positive assertion , that Mrs. Holbrook is with her father , you see , Mr. Proul , "
146807	146814	146816	146817	the detective	3674	" That for Medler 's assertion ! "
146820	146940	146816	146817	the detective	3674	" there are lawyers in London who will assert anything for a consideration . Let him produce the lady ; and if he does produce her , I give him leave to say that Thomas Henry Proul is incapable of his business ; or , putting it in vulgar English , that T.H.P. is a duffer . Of course I shall carry out any business you like to trust me with , Mr. Fenton , and carry it out thoroughly . I 'll set a watch upon Mr. Medler 's offices , and I 'll circumvent him by means of his clerk , if I can ; but it 's my rooted conviction that Mrs. Holbrook never left Hampshire . "
147160	147242	147139	147139	he	246	" She was lured away from him , perhaps , by some specious lie of her father 's , some cruel slander of the husband . There had been bitter words between them . Saltram has betrayed as much in his wandering talk ; but to the last there was no feeling but love for him in her heart . Ellen Carley is my witness for that ; nothing less than some foul lie could have tempted her away from him . "
147789	147792	147793	147793	he	2318	" Gilbert , "
147798	147804	147793	147793	he	2318	" is it really you ? "
147941	147949	147932	147933	a traitor	7414	" Yes , John , it is I. "
147950	148058	148059	148059	he	3713	" And you have been here for a long time . O God , how many months have I been lying here ? The time seems endless ; and there have been so many people round me a crowd of strange faces all enemies , all against me . And people in the next room that was the worst of all . I have never seen them , but I have always known that they were there . They could not deceive me as to that hiding behind that door , and watching me as I lay here . You might have turned them out , Gilbert , "
148063	148080	148059	148059	he	3713	" it seems a hard thing that you could let them stay there to torment me . "
148081	148162	148059	148059	he	3713	" There has been no one in either of the rooms , John ; no one but myself and the hired nurse , the doctors , and Mrs. Pratt now and then . These people have no existence out of your sick fancy . You have been very ill , delirious , for a long time . I thank God that your reason has been restored to you ; yes , I thank God with all my heart for that . "
148163	148169	148170	148171	the other	595	" Have I been mad ? "
148174	148222	148059	148059	he	3713	" Your mind has wandered . But that has passed at last with the fever , as the doctors hoped it might . You are calm now , and must try to keep yourself quiet ; there must be no more talk between us to - night . "
148263	148266	148267	148267	he	3190	" Gilbert , "
148272	148290	148267	148267	he	3190	" what have they done with my wife ? Why has she been kept away from me ? "
148291	148297	148059	148059	he	3713	" Your wife ? Marian ? "
148298	148324	148267	148267	he	3190	" Yes Marian . You know her name , surely . Did she know that I was ill , and yet stayed away from me ? "
148325	148403	148059	148059	he	3713	" Was her place here , John Saltram ? that poor girl whom you married under a false name , whom you tried to hide from all the world . Have you ever brought her here ? Have you ever given her a wife 's license , or a wife 's place ? How many lies have you not told to hide that which any honest man would have been proud to confess to all the world ? "
148404	148544	148267	148267	he	3190	" Yes , I have lied to you about her , I have hidden my treasure . But it was for your sake , Gilbert ; it was for the sake of our old friendship . I could not bear to lose you ; I could not bear to stand revealed before you as the weak wretch who betrayed your trust and stole your promised wife . Yes , Gilbert , I have been guilty beyond all measure . I have looked you in the face and told you lies . I wanted to keep you for my friend ; I could not stand the thought of a life - long breach between us . Gilbert , old friend , have pity on me . I was weak wicked , if you like but I loved you very dearly . "
148578	148590	148591	148591	he	3717	" Anything would have been better than the course you chose , "
148601	148880	148591	148591	he	3717	" If she loved you better than me than me , who would have thought it so small a thing to lay down my life for her happiness , or to stand aloof and keep the secret of my broken heart while I blest her as the cherished wife of another if you had certain reason to be sure she loved you , you should have asserted your right to claim her love like a man , and should have been prompt to tell me the bitter truth . I am a man , and would have borne the blow as a man should bear it . But to sneak into my place behind my back , to steal her away from me , to marry her under a false name a step that might go far to invalidate the marriage , by the way and then leave me to piece - out the broken story , syllable by syllable , to suffer all the torture of a prolonged suspense , all the wasted passion of anger and revenge against an imaginary enemy , to find at last that the man I had loved and trusted , honoured and admired beyond all other men throughout the best years of my life , was the man who had struck this secret blow it was the conduct of a villain and a coward , John Saltram . I have no words to speak my contempt for so base a betrayal . And when I remember your pretended sympathy , your friendly counsel O God ! it was the work of a social Judas ; nothing was wanted but the kiss . "
148881	148884	148885	148886	the other	595	" Yes , "
148894	149155	148885	148886	the other	595	" it was very bad . Once having begun , you see , it was but to add one lie to another . Anything seemed better than to tell you the truth . I fancied your devotion for Marian would wear itself out much sooner than it did that you would marry some one else ; and then I thought , when you were happy , and had forgotten that old fancy , I would have confessed the truth , and told you it was your friend who was your rival . It might have seemed easy to you to forgive me under those happier circumstances , and so our old friendship might never have been broken . I waited for that , Gilbert . Do n't suppose that it was not painful to me to act so base a part ; do n't suppose that I did not suffer . I did in a hundred ways . You have seen the traces of that slow torture in my face . In every way I had sinned from my weak desire to win my love and yet keep my friend ; and God knows the burden of my sin has been heavy upon me . I will tell you some day if ever I am strong enough for so many words , and if you will hear me out patiently the whole story of my temptation ; how I struggled against it , and only gave way at last when life seemed insupportable to me without the woman I loved . "
149201	149206	149207	149207	he	3720	" Where is she ? "
149212	149228	149207	149207	he	3720	" why does n't she come to me ? You have not answered that question . "
149229	149241	149242	149242	Gilbert	178	" I have told you that her place is not here , "
149246	149265	149242	149242	Gilbert	178	" You have no right to expect her here , never having given her the right to come . "
149266	149344	149207	149207	he	3720	" No ; it is my own fault . She is in Hampshire still , I suppose . Poor girl , I would give the world to see her dear face looking down at me . I must get well and go back to her . When shall I be strong enough to travel ? to - morrow , or if not to - morrow , the next day ; surely the next day eh , Gilbert ? "
149414	149426	149427	149427	he	178	" How did you find out that Marian was my wife ? "
149435	149441	149427	149427	he	178	" Who betrayed my secret ? "
149442	149485	149486	149486	Gilbert	178	" Your own lips , in your delirious talk of her , which has been incessant ; and if collateral evidence were needed to confirm your words , this , which I found the other day marking a place in your Shakespeare . "
149545	149552	149553	149553	he	246	" Yes , it was hers , "
149758	149758	149748	149748	You	3723	"
149759	149775	149721	149721	her	169	" No , John Saltram ; God knows , I have never thought of that . "
149776	149812	149748	149748	You	3723	" And you knew I was a traitor you knew it was my work that had destroyed your scheme of happiness and yet have been beside me , watching me patiently through this wretched illness ? "
149813	149850	149721	149721	her	169	" That was a small thing to do You did as much , and a great deal more , for me , when I was ill in Egypt . It was a mere act of duty . "
149851	149894	149748	149748	You	3723	" Not of friendship . It was Christian charity , eh , Gilbert ? If thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink ; and so on . It was not the act of a friend ? "
149895	150000	149721	149721	her	169	" No , John Saltram , between you and me there can never again be any such word as friendship . What little I have done for you I think I would have done for a stranger , had I found a stranger as helpless and unfriended as I found you . I am quite sure that to have done less would have been to neglect a sacred duty . There is no question of obligation . Till you are on your feet again , a strong man , I will stand by you ; when that time comes , we part for ever . "
150051	150058	150071	150071	He	178	" A lame and impotent conclusion , "
150313	150320	150321	150321	he	178	" I have no fear now , "
150328	150368	150321	150321	he	178	" It is now only a question of getting back the physical strength , which has certainly fallen to a very low ebb . Perfect repose and an entire freedom from care are what we have to look to . "
150375	150384	150385	150385	she	7489	" He has been very restless all day , "
150388	150552	150385	150385	she	7489	" though I 've done what I could to keep him quiet . But he worries himself , now that his senses have come back , poor gentleman ; and it is n't easy to soothe him any way . He keeps on wondering when he 'll be well enough to move , and so on , over and over again . Once , when I left the room for a minute and went back again , I found him attempting to get out of bed only to try his strength , he said . But he 's no more strength than a new - born baby , poor soul , and it will be weeks before he 's able to stir . If he worries and frets , he 'll put himself back for a certainty ; but I daresay you 'll have more influence over him than I , sir , and that you may be able to keep him quiet . "
150553	150558	150560	150560	Gilbert	178	" I doubt that , "
150562	150578	150560	150560	Gilbert	178	" but I 'll do my best . Has he been delirious to - day ? "
150579	150597	150616	150616	its	3743	" No , sir , not once ; and of course that 's a great thing gained . "
150619	150687	150616	150616	its	3743	" Is that you , Gilbert ? Come in , for pity 's sake . I was sure of the voice . So you have come on your errand of charity once more . I am very glad to see you , though you are not my friend . Sit down , ministering Christian , sit by my side ; I have some questions to ask you . "
150688	150704	150616	150616	its	3743	" You must not talk much , John . The doctor insists upon perfect tranquillity . "
150705	150789	150616	150616	its	3743	" He might just as well insist upon my making myself Emperor of all the Russias ; one demand would be about as reasonable as the other . How long have I been lying here like a log a troublesome log , by the way ; for I find from some hints the nurse dropped to - day as to the blessing of my recovery , that I have been somewhat given to violence ; how long have I been ill , Gilbert ? "
150790	150796	150616	150616	its	3743	" A very long time . "
150797	150810	150616	150616	its	3743	" Give me a categorical answer . How many weeks and days ? "
150811	150833	150616	150616	its	3743	" You were taken ill about the middle of December , and we are now in the first week of February . "
150834	150919	150616	150616	its	3743	" Nearly two months ; and in all that time I have been idle ergo , no remittances from publishers . How have I lived , Gilbert ? How have the current expenses of my illness been paid ? And the children of Israel have they not been clamorous ? There was a bill due in January , I know . I was working for that when I got pulled up . How is it that my vile carcass is not in their hands ? "
150920	150935	150616	150616	its	3743	" You need give yourself no trouble ; the bill has been taken up . "
150936	151011	150616	150616	its	3743	" By you , of course ? Yes ; you do not deny it . And you have been spending your money day by day to keep me alive . But then you would have done as much for a stranger . Great heaven , what a mean hound I seem to myself , as I lie here and think what you have done for me , and how I have acted towards you ! "
151032	151041	151042	151042	he	3744	" Let me hide my face from you , "
151045	151052	151042	151042	he	3744	" I am a shameful creature . "
151053	151070	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Believe me , once more , there is not the faintest shadow of an obligation , "
151075	151139	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" I can very well afford anything I have done ; shall never feel myself the poorer for it by a sixpence . I can not bear that these things should be spoken of between us . You know how often I have begged you to let me help you in the past , and how wounded I have been by your refusal . "
151140	151203	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Yes , when we were friends , before I had ever wronged you . If I had taken your help then , I should hardly have felt the obligation . But , stay , I am not such a pauper as I seem . My wife will have money ; at least you told me that the old man was rich . "
151204	151263	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Yes , your wife will have money , plenty of money . You have no need to trouble yourself about financial matters . You have only to consider what the doctor has said . Your recovery depends almost entirely upon your tranquillity of mind . If you want to get well speedily , you must remember this . "
151264	151351	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" I do want to get well . I am in a fever to get well ; I want to see my wife . But my recovery will be evidently a tedious affair . I can not wait to see her till I am strong enough to travel . Why should she not come to me here ? She can she must come . Write to her , Gilbert ; tell her how I languish for her presence ; tell her how ill I have been . "
151352	151362	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Yes ; I will write by and by . "
151363	151466	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" By and by ! Your tone tells me that you do not mean what you say . There is something you are keeping from me . O , my God , what was that happened before I was ill ? My wife was missing . I was hunting for her without rest for nearly a week ; and then they told me she was drowned , that there was no hope of finding her . Was that real , Gilbert ? or only a part of my delirium ? Speak to me , for pity 's sake . Was it real ? "
151467	151487	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Yes , John ; your perplexity and trouble were real , but unnecessary ; your wife is safe . "
151488	151493	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Safe ? Where ? "
151494	151501	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" She is with her father . "
151502	151514	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" She did not even know that her father was living . "
151515	151541	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" No , not till very lately . He has come home from America , it seems , and Marian is now under his protection . "
151542	151582	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" What ! she could desert me without a word of warning without the faintest hint of her intention to go to a father of whom she knew nothing , or nothing that was not eminently to his discredit ! "
151583	151603	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" There may have been some strong influence brought to bear to induce her to take such a step . "
151604	151608	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" What influence ? "
151609	151638	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Do not worry yourself about that now ; make all haste to get well , and then it will be easy for you to win her back . "
151639	151750	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Yes ; only place me face to face with her , and I do not think there would be much question as to that . But that she should forsake me of her own free will ! It is so unlike my Marian my patient , long - suffering Marian ; I can scarcely believe such a thing possible . But that question can soon be put at rest . Write to her , Gilbert ; tell her that I have been at death 's door ; that my chance of recovery hangs upon her will . Father or no father , that will bring her to my side . "
151751	151763	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" I will do so , directly I know her address . "
151764	151773	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" You do not know where she is ? "
151774	151798	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Not yet . I am expecting to obtain that information every day . I have taken measures to ascertain where she is . "
151799	151812	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" And how do you know that she is with her father ? "
151813	151844	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" I have the lawyer 's authority for that ; a lawyer whom the old man , Jacob Nowell , trusted , whom he left sole executor to his will . "
151881	151889	151890	151891	the invalid	3745	" You believe this man , Gilbert ? "
151895	151907	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Of course . He has no reason for deceiving me . "
151908	151917	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" But why withhold the father 's address ? "
151918	151969	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" It is easy enough to conjecture his reasons for that ; a dread of your influence robbing him of his daughter . Her fortune has made her a prize worth disputing , you see . It is natural enough that the father should wish to hide her from you . "
151970	152046	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" For the sake of the money ? yes , I suppose that is the beginning and end of his scheme . My poor girl ! No doubt he has told her all manner of lies about me , and so contrived to estrange that faithful heart . Will you insert an advertisement in the Times , Gilbert , under initials , telling her of my illness , and entreating her to come to me ? "
152047	152110	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" I will do so if you like ; but I daresay Nowell will be cautious enough to keep the advertisement - sheet away from her , or to watch it pretty closely , and prevent her seeing anything we may insert . I am taking means to find them , John . I must entreat you to rest satisfied with that . "
152111	152136	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" Rest satisfied , when I am uncertain whether I shall ever see my wife again ! That is a hard thing to do . "
152137	152205	151071	151071	Gilbert	178	" If you harass yourself , you will not live to see her again . Trust in me , John ; Marian 's safety is as dear to me as it can be to you . I am her sworn friend and brother , her self - appointed guardian and defender . I have skilled agents at work ; we shall find her , rely upon it . "
152460	152490	152497	152498	the other	595	" To be chained here , Gilbert , lying on this odious bed like a dog , when she needs my help ! How am I to bear it ? "
152491	152496	152497	152498	the other	595	" Like a man , "
152502	152547	152497	152498	the other	595	" Were you as well as I am this moment , there 's nothing you could do that I am not doing . Do you think I should sit idly here , if the best measures had not been taken to find your wife ? "
152548	152594	152497	152498	the other	595	" Forgive me . Yes ; I have no doubt you have done what is best . But if I were astir , I should have the sense of doing something . I could urge on those people you employ , work with them even . "
152595	152655	152497	152498	the other	595	" You would be more likely to hinder than to assist them . They know their work , and it is a slow drudging business at best , which requires more patience than you possess . No , John , there is nothing to be done but to wait , and put our trust in Providence and in time . "
153093	153117	153118	153118	he	303	" Nothing but an iron constitution , and your admirable care , could have carried our friend through such an attack , sir , "
153122	153179	153118	153118	he	303	" And now that we are getting round a little , we must have change of air change of air and of scene ; that is imperatively necessary . Mr. Saltram talks of a loathing for these rooms ; very natural under the circumstances . We must take him away directly he can bear the removal . "
153180	153189	153190	153190	Gilbert	178	" I rather doubt his willingness to stir , "
153195	153208	153190	153190	Gilbert	178	" He has anxieties that are likely to chain him to London . "
153209	153223	153224	153225	Mr. Mew	303	" If there is any objection of that kind it must be conquered , "
153228	153246	153224	153225	Mr. Mew	303	" A change will do your friend more good than all the physic I can give him . "
153247	153257	153224	153225	Mr. Mew	303	" Where would you advise me to take him ? "
153258	153315	153224	153225	Mr. Mew	303	" Not very far . He could n't stand the fatigue of a long journey . I should take him to some quiet little place near town the more countrified the better . It is n't a very pleasant season for the country ; but in spite of that , the change will do him good . "
153361	153369	153371	153372	the surgeon	1540	" Hampton or Kingston by all means , "
153375	153446	153371	153372	the surgeon	1540	" Both very pleasant places in their way , and as mild as any neighbourhood within easy reach of town . Do n't go too near the water , and be sure your rooms are dry and airy that 's the main point . We might move him early next week , I fancy ; if we get him up for an hour or two every day in the interval . "
153567	153631	153632	153633	Mrs. Pallinson	171	" I wonder you can talk in such a way , when you know how friendless this poor Mr. Saltram is , and how little trouble it costs me to do as much as this for him . But I daresay the good Samaritan had some one at home who objected to the waste of that twopence he paid for the poor traveller . "
153656	153717	153632	153633	Mrs. Pallinson	171	" But the gospel was meant to be our guide in common things , was n't it , Mrs. Pallinson ? However , there 's not the least use in your being angry ; for I mean to do what I can for Mr. Saltram , and there 's no one in the world could turn me from my intention . "
153718	153721	153723	153725	the elder lady	3782	" Indeed ! "
153729	153771	153723	153725	the elder lady	3782	" and when he recovers you mean to marry him , I daresay . You will be weak enough to throw away your fortune upon a profligate and a spendthrift , a man who is certain to make any woman miserable . "
153779	153784	153786	153788	the two ladies	3783	" a very pretty quarrel "
153857	153870	153871	153873	the injured matron	3784	" and heaven knows how they have been trodden on this day , "
153952	153964	153965	153965	she	214	" The house is always kept in apple - pie order , "
153970	153986	153965	153965	she	214	" and I can send down more servants to make everything comfortable for the invalid . "
153987	153997	153998	153998	she	214	" I know he is fond of the place , "
154016	154072	153998	153998	she	214	" at least I know he used to like it , and I think it would please him to get well there . I can only say that it would make me very happy ; so do arrange it , dear Mr. Fenton , if possible , and oblige yours ever faithfully , ADELA BRANSTON . "
154073	154078	154080	154080	Gilbert	178	" Poor little woman , "
154088	154202	154080	154080	Gilbert	178	" No ; we will not impose upon her kindness ; we will go somewhere else . Better for her that she should see and hear but little of John Saltram for all time to come ; and then the foolish fancy will wear itself out perhaps , and she may live to be a happy wife yet ; unless she , too , is afflicted with the fatal capability of constancy . Is that such a common quality , I wonder ? are there many so luckless as to love once and once only , and who , setting all their hopes upon one cast , lose all if that be fatal ? "
154226	154235	154236	154236	he	246	" It is like her to wish it , "
154239	154399	154236	154236	he	246	" but no , I should feel myself a double traitor and impostor under her roof . I have done her wrong enough already . If I could have loved her , Gilbert , all might have been well for you and me . God knows I tried to love her , poor little woman ; and she is just the kind of woman who might twine herself about any man 's heart graceful , pretty , gracious , tender , bright and intelligent enough for any man ; and not too clever . But my heart she never touched . From the hour I saw that other , I was lost . I will tell you all about that some day . No ; we will not go to the villa . Write and give Mrs. Branston my best thanks for the generous offer , and invent some excuse for declining it ; that 's a good fellow . "
154416	154453	154412	154413	John Saltram	246	" I do not want to go out of town at all , Gilbert . It 's no use for the doctor to talk ; I ca n't leave London till we have news of Marian . "
154512	154524	154525	154525	he	322	" I am not asking you to go far , remember , "
154528	154565	154525	154525	he	322	" You will be within an hour 's journey of London , and the doctors declare this change is indispensable to your recovery . You have told us what a horror you have of these rooms . "
154566	154658	154483	154483	he	322	" Yes ; I doubt if any one but a sick man can understand his loathing of the scene of his illness . That room in there is filled with the shadows that haunted me in all those miserable nights when the fever was at its worst , and I lived amidst a crowd of phantoms . Yes , I do most profoundly hate that room . As for this matter of change of air , Gilbert , dispose of me as you please ; my worthless existence belongs to you . "
154949	154975	154981	154981	him	178	" It 's my belief the man knows nothing , or else I should have had it out of him by hook or by crook , "
155189	155201	155202	155203	Adela Branston	212	" Why will he not accept the smallest favour from me ? "
155207	155245	155202	155203	Adela Branston	212	" He ought to know that there is no arriere pensťe in any offer which I make him that I have no wish except for his welfare . Why does he not trust me a little more ? "
155246	155260	155261	155261	Gilbert	178	" He will do so in future , I think , Mrs. Branston , "
155265	155297	155261	155261	Gilbert	178	" I fancy he has learned the folly and danger of all underhand policy , and that he will put more faith in his friends for the rest of his life . "
155298	155317	155261	155261	Gilbert	178	" And he is really much better , quite out of danger ? Do the doctors say that ? "
155318	155379	155261	155261	Gilbert	178	" He is as much out of danger as a man can well be whose strength has all been wasted in a perilous illness . He has that to regain yet , and the recovery will be slow work . Of course in his condition a relapse would be fatal ; but there is no occasion to apprehend a relapse . "
155380	155401	155261	155261	Gilbert	178	" Thank heaven for that ! And you will take care of him , Mr. Fenton , will you not ? "
155402	155426	155261	155261	Gilbert	178	" I will do my very best . He saved my life once ; so you see that I owe him a life . "
155505	155519	155520	155520	he	3745	" Could you believe that a man would be so childish , Gilbert ? "
155524	155630	155520	155520	he	3745	" It might have been a good thing for me to have died in that dismal room , for heaven only knows what heavy sorrow lies before me in the future . Yet the sight of these common things touches me more keenly than all the glory of the Jungfrau touched me ten years ago . What a gay bright - looking world it is ! And yet how many people are happy in it ? how many take the right road ? I suppose there is a right road by which we all might travel , if we only knew how to choose it . "
155779	155789	155790	155790	he	246	" How good you are to me , Gilbert ! "
155822	155869	155790	155790	he	246	" How good ! and yet you are my friend no longer ; all friendship is at an end between us . Well , God knows I am as helpless as that man who fell among thieves ; I can not choose but accept your bounty . "
156134	156145	156146	156146	she	176	" You know that I hate this man , father ! "
156150	156252	156146	156146	she	176	" and that I hate myself for what I am going to do . You know that I have promised to be his wife for your sake , for your sake only ; and that if I could have saved you from disgrace by giving you my life , I should have done it gladly to escape this much greater sacrifice . Never speak to me about Stephen Whitelaw again , father , unless you want to drive me mad . Let me forget what sin I am going to commit , if I can ; let me go on blindfold . "
156666	156685	156686	156686	she	5090	" The time may come when all my life will depend upon the possession of a few pounds , "
156691	156706	156686	156686	she	5090	" when I may have some chance of setting myself free from that man . "
156988	157005	157011	157011	her	307	" A young woman like that will expect to see things bright and cheerful about her , "
157028	157149	157011	157011	her	307	" If you were going to marry a person of your own age , it would be different , of course ; but young women have such extravagant notions . I could see Miss Carley did not think much of the furniture when I took her over the house on new - year's - day . She said the rooms looked gloomy , and that some of them gave her the horrors , and so on . If you do n't have the place done up a bit at first , you 'll have to get it done at last , depend upon it ; a young wife like that will make the money spin , you may be sure . "
157150	157154	157156	157157	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" Will she ? "
157164	157193	157156	157157	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" That 's my look - out . I do n't think you 've had very much chance of making my money spin , eh , Mrs. Tadman ? "
157213	157229	157230	157230	she	5832	" Goodness knows I 've had precious little chance of doing that , Stephen Whitelaw , "
157233	157248	157277	157277	Wyncomb	274	" I should reckon not ; and my wife will have about as much . "
157402	157428	157429	157430	the farmer	3092	" I suppose she 's going to turn lazy as soon as she 's married , or she would n't have wanted to keep you , "
157453	157557	157439	157439	he	3092	" But if she is , we must find some way of curing her of that . I do n't want a fine lady about my place . There 's the dairy , now ; we might do more in that way , I should think , and get more profit out of butter - making than we do by sending part of the milk up to London . Butter fetches a good price now - a - days from year 's end to year 's end , and Ellen is a rare hand at a dairy ; I know that for certain . "
157813	157824	157825	157825	he	270	" I have had an uncommon narrow squeak of it , "
157838	157904	157825	157825	he	270	" and have been as near seeing the inside of Portland prison as ever a man was . But it 'll be a warning to me in future . And yet who could have thought that things would have gone against me as they did ? There was Sir Philip Christopher 's bay colt Pigskin , for instance ; that brute was bound to win . "
158230	158243	158244	158246	the unhappy girl	3639	" He will believe that I was a hypocrite at heart always , "
158251	158341	158244	158246	the unhappy girl	3639	" and that I value Stephen Whitelaw 's money more than his true heart that I can marry a man I despise and dislike for the sake of being rich . What can he think worse of me than that ? and how can he help thinking that ? He knows that I have a good spirit of my own , and that my father could not make me do anything against my will . He will never believe that this marriage has been all my father 's doing . "
158671	158677	158678	158678	he	3926	" Quite right , Nell , "
158681	158756	158678	158678	he	3926	" we do n't want any foolish fuss , or a pack of people making themselves drunk at our expense . You and your father can come quietly to Crosber church , and Mrs. Tadman and me will meet you there , and the thing 's done . The marriage would n't be any the tighter if we had a hundred people looking on , and the Bishop of Winchester to read the service . "
158889	158900	158901	158901	he	6494	" And yet it 's all for her own good , "
158905	159003	158903	158903	himself	6494	" quite as much as for mine . Better to marry a rich man than a pauper any day ; and to take a dislike to a man 's age or a man 's looks is nothing but a girl 's nonsense . The best husband is the one that can keep his wife best ; and if I had n't forced on this business , she 'd have taken up with lawyer Randall 's son , who 's no better than a beggar , and a pretty life she 'd have had of it with him . "
159191	159198	159199	159199	she	307	" Marriage is an expensive thing , "
159208	159227	159199	159199	she	307	" and young girls expect to see a man dressed ever so smart on his wedding - day . "
159228	159237	159238	159239	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" I do n't care for her expectations , "
159248	159280	159238	159239	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" and if I do n't want the clothes , I wo n't have 'em . Do you think I could get over next Christmas with them as I 've got ? "
159284	159286	159281	159282	Mrs. Tadman	307	" No "
160491	160523	160489	160489	herself	176	" For me the sun can never shine again , the world I live in can never more seem beautiful , or beautiful only in bitter contrast to my broken heart . "
161242	161262	161263	161263	she	307	" I ca n't for the life of me think what 's taken him to Malsham to - day , "
161284	161408	161267	161267	she	307	" I have n't known him go to Malsham , except of a market - day , not once in a twelvemonth . It must be a rare business to take him there in the middle of the week ; for he ca n't abide to leave the farm in working - hours , except when he 's right down obliged to it . Nothing goes on the same when his back 's turned , he says ; there 's always something wrong . And if it was an appointment with any one belonging to Malsham , why could n't it have stood over till Saturday ? It must be something out of the common that wo n't keep a couple of days . "
161532	161618	161509	161509	she	5832	" There was a letter that came for Stephen before dinner to - day ; he got it when he came in , but it was lying here for an hour first . Perhaps it was that as took him to Malsham ; and yet that 's strange , for it was a London letter and it do n't seem likely as any one could be coming down from London to meet Steph at Malsham . I ca n't make top nor tail of it . "
161907	161913	161914	161914	she	307	" Here comes Mr. Whitelaw , "
161924	161933	161914	161914	she	307	" and there 's some one with him . "
161934	161940	161942	161943	Mrs. Tadman	307	" Some one with him ! "
161945	161956	161942	161943	Mrs. Tadman	307	" Why , my goodness , who can that be ? "
162061	162070	162072	162073	Mrs. Tadman	307	" I never set eyes upon him before , "
162984	163011	162972	162972	he	1282	" Come , Whitelaw , if you mean to show me this house of yours , you may as well show it to me at once . "
163050	163057	163058	163059	the stranger	1282	" Be quick , man alive , "
163083	163104	163067	163081	the farmer , who was trimming an incorrigible wick with a pair of blunted snuffers	4071	" Remember , I 've got to go back to Malsham ; I have n't all the night to waste . "
163105	163116	163117	163118	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" I do n't want to set my house afire , "
163122	163141	163117	163118	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" though , perhaps , you might like that . It might suit your book , you see . "
163158	163165	163142	163143	The stranger	1282	" drop that sort of insolence . "
163166	163179	163180	163180	he	1282	" And now show the way , and look sharp about it , "
163223	163235	163236	163236	she	307	" I do n't like the look of it , Ellen , "
163239	163251	163236	163236	she	307	" I do n't at all like the look of it . "
163252	163258	163259	163260	the girl	5090	" What do you mean ? "
163264	163396	163259	163260	the girl	5090	" I do n't like the hold that man has got over Stephen , nor the way he speaks to him almost as if Steph was a dog . Did you hear him just now ? And what does he want to see the house for , I should like to know ? What can this house matter to him , unless he was going to buy it ? That 's it , perhaps , Ellen . Stephen has been speculating , and has gone and ruined himself , and that strange man is going to buy Wyncomb . He gave me a kind of turn the minute I looked at him . And , depend upon it , he 's come to turn us all out of house and home . "
163656	163681	163682	163682	she	307	" And Stephen 's just the man to have such a thing on his mind and keep it from everybody till the last moment , "
163686	163743	163682	163682	she	307	" And so many speculations as there are now - a - days to tempt a man to his ruin railways and mines , and loans to Turks and Red Indians and such - like foreigners ; and Steph might so easy be tempted by the hope of larger profits than he can make by farming . "
163744	163762	163763	163763	Ellen	176	" But it 's no use torturing yourself like that with fears that may be quite groundless , "
163787	163836	163769	163769	herself	176	" There 's no use in anticipating trouble . There may be nothing in this business after all . Mr. Whitelaw may have a fancy for showing people his house . He wanted me to see it , if you remember , that new - year 's afternoon . "
163837	163893	163930	163930	Ellen	176	" Yes ; but that was different . He meant to marry you . Why should he want to show the place to a stranger ? I ca n't believe but what that strange man is here for something , and something bad . I saw it in his face when he first came in . "
163989	164003	164004	164006	the young man	666	" How often have I heard you express your detestation of that fellow ! "
164010	164107	164004	164006	the young man	666	" How often have I heard you declare that no earthly persuasion should ever induce you to marry him ! And yet before my back has been turned six months , I hear that you are his wife . Without a word of warning , without a line of explanation to soften the blow if anything could soften it the news comes to me , from a stranger who knew nothing of my love for you . It is very hard , Ellen ; all the harder because I had so fully trusted in your fidelity . "
164108	164237	164004	164006	the young man	666	" I will own that the prospect I had to offer you was a poor one ; involving long delay before I could give you such a home as I wanted to give you ; but O , Nelly , Nelly , I felt so sure that you would be true to me ! And if you found yourself in any difficulty , worried beyond your power of resistance by your father though I did not think you were the kind of girl to yield weakly to persuasion a line from you would have brought me to your side , ready to defend you from any persecution , and only too proud to claim you for my wife , and carry you away from your father 's unkindness . "
164359	164370	164371	164371	she	176	" There are some things that can never be explained , "
164374	164566	164371	164371	she	176	" and my marriage is one of those . No one could save me from it , you least of all . There was no help for me ; and I believe , with all my heart , that , in acting as I did , I only did my duty . I had not the courage to write to you beforehand to tell you what was going to be . I thought it was almost better you should hear it from a stranger . The more hardly you think of me , the easier it will be for you to forget me . There is some comfort in that . I daresay it will be very easy for you to forget . But if , in days to come , when you are happily married to some one else , you can teach yourself to think more kindly of me , and to believe that in what I did I acted for the best , you will be performing an act of charity towards a poor unhappy girl , who has very little left to hope for in this world . "
164901	164906	164892	164892	Ellen	176	" What was that ? "
164907	164912	164941	164942	A woman	5214	" What was that ? "
165064	165070	165072	165073	the farmer	3092	" What 's the matter ? "
165084	165094	165095	165096	his wife	549	" That 's just what we want to know , "
165099	165113	165095	165096	his wife	549	" Who was it that screamed just now ? Who 's been hurt ? "
165114	165190	165095	165095	his	177	" My friend stumbled against a step in the passage yonder , and knocked his shin . He cried out a bit louder than he need have done , if that 's what you mean , but not loud enough to cause all this fuss . Get downstairs again , you two , and keep quiet . I 've no patience with such nonsense ; coming flying upstairs as if you 'd both gone mad . "
165191	165202	165095	165096	his wife	549	" It was not your friend 's voice we heard , "
165207	165225	165203	165203	Ellen	176	" it was a woman 's cry . You must have heard it surely , Stephen Whitelaw . "
165226	165236	165237	165238	the farmer	3092	" I heard nothing but what I tell you , "
165242	165250	165237	165238	the farmer	3092	" Get downstairs , ca n't you ? "
165251	165261	165262	165263	his wife	549	" Not till I know what 's the matter , "
165271	165284	165262	165263	his wife	549	" Give me your light , and let me go and see . "
165285	165313	165262	165262	his	3092	" You can go where you like , wench , and see what you can ; and an uncommon deal wiser you 'll be for your trouble . "
165354	165360	165361	165361	she	549	" Come , Mrs. Tadman , "
165365	165422	165361	165361	she	549	" we had better see into this . It was a woman 's voice , and must have been one of the girls , I suppose . It may be nothing serious , after all , these country girls scream out for a very little , but we 'd better get to the bottom of it . "
165444	165460	165461	165461	he	3092	" Ay , my wench , you 'd best get to the bottom of it , "
165490	165490	165461	165461	he	3092	"
165547	165550	165551	165551	he	177	" Yes , "
165554	165570	165551	165551	he	177	" come along , ca n't you ? do n't stand cawing here all night ; "
165812	165824	165825	165825	Ellen	329	" Was it either of you girls that screamed just now ? "
165829	165838	165839	165840	Martha Holden	286	" Screamed , ma'am ! no , indeed , "
165851	165877	165839	165840	Martha Holden	286	" What should we scream for ? I 've been sitting here at my work for the last hour , as quiet as could be . "
165878	165897	165839	165840	Martha Holden	286	" And , Sarah , was it you , Sarah ? For goodness ' sake tell the truth . "
165898	165922	165839	165840	Martha Holden	286	" Me , mum ! lor no , mum . I was up with master showing him and the strange gentleman a light . "
165923	165957	165839	165840	Martha Holden	286	" You were upstairs with your master ? And did you hear nothing ? A piercing shriek that rang through the house ; you must surely have heard it , both of you . "
165964	166017	165960	165960	her	286	" Not me , mum ; I did n't hear a sound . The kitchen - door was shut all the time Sarah was away , and I was busy at work , and thinking of nothing but my work . I was n't upon the listen , as you may say . "
166042	166048	166049	166049	Ellen	329	" It is most extraordinary , "
166058	166087	166049	166049	Ellen	329	" But you , Sarah ; if you were upstairs with your master , you must surely have heard that shriek ; it seemed to come from upstairs . "
166088	166094	166096	166097	the girl	5090	" Did master hear it ? "
166100	166105	166049	166049	Ellen	329	" He says not . "
166106	166133	166049	166049	Ellen	329	" Then how should I , mum ? No , mum , I did n't hear nothink ; I can take my Bible oath of that . "
166134	166174	166049	166049	Ellen	329	" I do n't want any oaths ; I only want to know the meaning of this business . There would have been no harm in your screaming . You might just as well speak the truth about it . "
166175	166185	166187	166188	Sarah Batts	332	" Lor , mum , but it warn't me , "
166194	166209	166187	166188	Sarah Batts	332	" Whatever could go to put it in your head as it was me ? "
166210	166273	166049	166049	Ellen	329	" It must have been one or other of you two girls . There 's no other woman in the house ; and as you were upstairs , it seems more likely to have been you . However , there 's no use talking any more about it . Only we both heard the scream , did n't we , Mrs. Tadman ? "
166274	166283	166285	166286	the widow	5832	" I should think we did , indeed , "
166292	166319	166285	166286	the widow	5832	" My flesh is all upon the creep at this very moment . I do n't think I ever had such a turn in my life . "
166547	166555	166556	166556	she	307	" Did n't I tell you so ? "
166617	166627	166629	166630	the stranger	1282	" I shall be late for the last train , "
166632	166642	166629	166630	the stranger	1282	" unless your man drives like the very devil . "
166643	166663	166664	166665	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" He 'll drive fast enough , I daresay , if you give him half - a - crown , "
166671	166694	166664	166665	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" but do n't let him go and do my horse any damage , or you 'll have to pay for it . "
166695	166725	166727	166728	the stranger	1282	" Of course . You 'd like to get the price of a decent animal out of me for that broken - kneed hard - mouthed brute of yours , "
166734	166857	166727	166728	the stranger	1282	" I think there never was such a money - grubbing , grinding , grasping beggar since the world began . However , you 've seen the last shilling you 're ever likely to get out of me ; so make the best of it ; and remember , wherever I may be , there are friends of mine in this country who will keep a sharp look - out upon you , and let me know precious quick if you do n't stick to your part of our bargain like an honest man , or as nearly like one as nature will allow you to come . And now good - night , Mr. Whitelaw . Ladies , your humble servant . "
166936	166940	166941	166941	she	307	" Stephen Whitelaw , "
166945	166982	166941	166941	she	307	" tell us the worst at once . It 's no good keeping things back from us . That man has come here to turn us out of house and home . You 've sold Wyncomb . "
166983	166996	166998	166999	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" Sold Wyncomb ! Have you gone crazy , you old fool ? "
167012	167022	166998	166999	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" What 's put that stuff in your head ? "
167023	167111	166941	166941	she	307	" Your own doings , Stephen , and that man 's . What does he come here for , with his masterful ways , unless it 's to turn us out of house and home ? What did you show him the house for ? Nigh upon an hour you were out of this room with him , if you were a minute . Why did money pass from him to you ? I saw you put it in your pocket a bundle of bank - notes . "
167112	167120	167122	167123	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" You 're a prying old catemeran ! "
167126	167257	167122	167123	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" and a drunken old fool into the bargain . Why do you let her muddle herself with the gin - bottle like that , Ellen ? You ought to have more respect for my property . You do n't call that taking care of your husband 's house . As for you , mother Tadman , if you treat me to any more of this nonsense , you will find yourself turned out of house and home a precious deal sooner than you bargained for ; but it wo n't be because of my selling Wyncomb . Sell Wyncomb , indeed ! I 've about as much thought of going up in a balloon , as of parting with a rood or a perch of my father 's land . "
167300	167323	167325	167326	Mrs. Tadman	307	" What was that man here for , then , Stephen ? It 's only natural I should want to know that , "
167340	167426	167435	167436	Mrs. Tadman	307	" What 's that to you ? Business . Yes , there has been money pass between us , and it 's rather a profitable business for me . Perhaps it was horse - racing , perhaps it was n't . That 's about all you 've any call to know . I 've made money by it , and not lost . And now , do n't let me be bothered about it any more , if you and me are to keep friends . "
167427	167434	167435	167436	Mrs. Tadman	307	" I 'm sure , Stephen , "
167444	167511	167435	167436	Mrs. Tadman	307	" I 've no wish to bother you ; there 's nothing farther from my thoughts ; but it 's only natural that I should be anxious about a place where I 've lived so many years . Not but what I could get my living easy enough elsewhere , as you must know , Stephen , being able to turn my hand to almost anything . "
167686	167693	167683	167683	him	177	" A bad job dangerous business . "
168265	168279	168280	168280	he	178	" I said once that I would tell you all about that business , "
168291	168538	168280	168280	he	178	" but , after all there is so little to tell . There is no excuse for what I did ; I know that better than you can know it . A man in my position , who had a spark of generosity or honour , would have strangled his miserable passion in its birth , would have gone away directly he discovered his folly , and never looked upon Marian Nowell 's face again . I did try to do that , Gilbert . You remember that last night we ever spent together at Lidford what a feverishly - happy night it was ; only a cottage - parlour with a girl 's bright face shining in the lamplight , and a man over head and ears in love , but a glimpse of paradise to that man . I meant that it should be the last of my weakness , Gilbert . I had pledged myself to that by all the outspoken oaths wherewith a man can bind himself to do his duty . And I did turn my back upon the scene of my temptation , as you know , heartily resolved never to approach the edge of the pit again . I think if you had stayed in England , Gilbert , if you had been on the spot to defend your own rights , all would have gone well , I should have kept the promise I had made for myself . "
168539	168554	168555	168555	Gilbert	178	" It was so much the more sacred because of my absence , John , "
168558	168786	168280	168280	he	178	" Perhaps . After all , I suppose it was only a question of opportunity . That particular devil who tempts men to their dishonour contrived that the business should be made fatally easy for me . You were away , and the coast was clear , you know . I loved you , Gilbert ; but there is a passion stronger than the love which a man feels for his dearest friend . I meant most steadfastly to keep my faith with you ; but you were away , and that fellow Forster plagued me to come to him . I refused at first yes , I held out for a couple of months ; but the fever was strong upon me a restless demon not to be exorcised by hard work , or dissipation even , for I tried both . And then before you were at the end of your journey , while you were still a wanderer across the desolate sea , happy in the thought of your dear love 's fidelity , my courage gave way all at once , and I went down to Heatherly . And so I saw her , and saw that she loved me all unworthy as I was ; and from that hour I was a lost man ; I thought of nothing but winning her . "
168787	168851	168280	168280	he	178	" If you had only been true to me , even then , John ; if you had written to me declaring the truth , and giving me fair warning that you were my rival , how much better it would have been ! Think what a torture of suspense , what a world of wasted anger , you might have saved me . "
168852	168866	168867	168868	the other	595	" Yes , it would have been the manlier course , no doubt , "
168871	169115	168867	168868	the other	595	" but I could not bring myself to that . I could not face the idea of your justifiable wrath . I wanted to win my wife and keep my friend . It was altogether a weak notion , that idea of secrecy , of course , and could n't hold water for any time , as the result has shown ; but I thought you would get over your disappointment quickly those wounds are apt to heal so speedily and fall in love elsewhere ; and then it would have been easy for me to tell you the truth . So I persuaded my dear love , who was easily induced to do anything I wished , to consent to our secret being kept from you religiously for the time being , and to that end we were married under a false name not exactly a false name either . You remember my asking you if you had ever heard the name of Holbrook before your hunt after Marian 's husband ? You said no ; yet I think you must have seen the name in some of my old college books . I was christened John Holbrook . My grandmother was one of the Holbrooks of Horley - place , Sussex , people of some importance in their day , and our family were rather proud of the name . But I have dropped it ever since I was a lad . "
169116	169144	168280	168280	he	178	" No , I do n't think I can ever have seen the name ; I must surely have remembered it , if I had seen it . "
169145	169327	168867	168868	the other	595	" Perhaps so . Well , Gilbert , there is no more to be said . I loved her , selfishly , after the manner of mankind . I could not bring myself to give her up , and pursued her with a passionate persistence which must plead her excuse . If her uncle had lived , I doubt whether I should ever have succeeded . But his death left the tender womanly heart weakened by sorrow ; and so I won her , the dearest , truest wife that ever man was blest withal . Yet , I confess to you , so wayward is my nature , that there have been moments in which I repented my triumph weak hours of doubt and foreboding , in which I fear that dear girl divined my thoughts . Since our wretched separation I have fancied sometimes that a conviction of this kind on her part is at the root of the business , that she has alienated herself from me , believing in plain words that I was tired of her . "
169328	169386	168280	168280	he	178	" Such an idea as that would scarcely agree with Ellen Carley 's account of Marian 's state of mind during that last day or two at the Grange . She was eagerly expecting your return , looking forward with delight to the pleasant surprise you were to experience when you heard of Jacob Nowell 's will . "
169387	169455	168867	168868	the other	595	" Yes , the girl told me that . Great heavens , why did I not return a few days earlier ! I was waiting for money , not caring to go back empty - handed ; writing and working like a nigger . I dared not meet my poor girl at her grandfather 's , since in so doing I must risk an encounter with you . "
169696	169699	169700	169700	he	178	" Strange , "
169788	169788	169796	169796	he	178	"
169953	169963	169964	169964	he	178	" I will make no further pretence of enmity , "
169969	170001	169964	169964	he	178	" I will not keep up this farce of estrangement . We two will be friends once more . Life is not long enough for the rupture of such a friendship . "
170142	170145	170146	170146	he	178	" John ! "
170176	170184	170158	170158	he	178	" John , what are you doing ? "
170231	170248	170249	170249	she	4227	" Oh , dear , sir , you did give me and missus such a turn ! "
170270	170283	170249	170249	she	4227	" We never heard you come in , and when the bell rung "
170284	170290	170291	170291	Gilbert	178	" Is Mr. Saltram worse ? "
170296	170369	170249	170249	she	4227	" Worse , poor dear gentleman ; no , sir , I should hope not , though he well may be , for there never was any one so imprudent , not of all the invalids I 've ever had to do with and Hampton is a rare place for invalids . And I feel sure if you 'd been here , sir , you would n't have let him do it . "
170370	170394	170249	170249	she	4227	" Let him do what ? Are you crazy , girl ? What , in heaven 's name , are you talking of ? "
170395	170429	170249	170249	she	4227	" You would n't have let him start off to London post - haste , as he did yesterday afternoon , and scarcely able to stand alone , in a manner of speaking . "
170430	170449	170249	170249	she	4227	" Gone to London ! Do you mean to say that my friend Mr. Saltram went to London ? "
170450	170462	170249	170249	she	4227	" Yes , sir ; yesterday afternoon between four and five . "
170463	170475	170249	170249	she	4227	" What utter madness ! And when did he come back ? "
170476	170608	170249	170249	she	4227	" Lor ' bless you , sir , he ai n't come back yet . He told missus as his coming back was quite uncertain , and she was not to worry herself about him . She did all she could , almost to going down on her knees , to hinder him going ; but it was no use . It was a matter of life and death as he was going upon , he said , and that there was no power on earth could keep him back , not if he was ten times worse than he was . The strange gentleman had n't been in the house much above a quarter of an hour , when they was both off together in a fly to the station . "
170609	170614	170249	170249	she	4227	" What strange gentleman ? "
170615	170786	170249	170249	she	4227	" A stout middle - aged man , sir , with gray whiskers , that came from London , and asked for you first , and then for Mr. Saltram ; and those two had n't been together more than five minutes , when Mr. Saltram rang the bell in a violent hurry , and told my missus he was going to town immediate , on most particular business , and would she pack him a carpet - bag with a couple of shirts , and so on . And then she tried all she could to turn him from going ; but it was no good , as I was telling you , sir , just now . Go he would , and go he did ; looking quite flushed and bright - like when he went out , so as you 'd have scarcely known how ill he 'd been . And he left a bit of a note for you on the chimbley - piece , sir . "
170810	170817	170819	170820	John Saltram	246	" She is found , Gilbert , "
170822	170939	170819	170820	John Saltram	246	" Proul has traced the father to his lair at last , and my darling is with him . They are lodging at 14 , Coleman - street , Tottenham - court - road . I am off this instant . Do n't be angry with me , true and faithful friend ; I could not rest an hour away from her now that she is found . I have no plan of action , but leave all to the inspiration of the moment . You can follow me whenever you please . Marian must thank you for your goodness to me . Marian must persuade you to forgive my sin against you Ever yours , J.S. "
171168	171177	171178	171178	Gilbert	178	" Providence will surely be good to him , "
171181	171213	171178	171178	Gilbert	178	" He bore the journey from town when he was much worse than he is now . Surely he will bear a somewhat rougher journey now , buoyed up by hope . "
171599	171616	171617	171617	he	178	" I feel as if I were the victim of some hoax , some miserable delusion , "
171622	171650	171617	171617	he	178	" Not till I see her , not till I clasp her by the hand , shall I believe that she is really given back to us . "
171964	171974	171975	171975	he	178	" You must have come to the wrong house , "
171985	171994	171975	171975	he	178	" No , sir , this is 14 . "
172031	172033	171975	171975	he	178	" Apartments "
172099	172102	172103	172103	Gilbert	178	" apartments . "
172229	172242	172243	172243	she	3885	" Did you please to wish to see the apartments , sir ? "
172247	172266	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" No ; I want to see Mr. and Mrs. the lady and gentleman who are lodging here . "
172294	172302	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" The lady and gentleman , sir ! "
172311	172329	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" There 's no one lodging here now . Mr. Nowell and his daughter left yesterday morning . "
172330	172335	172291	172292	Mrs. Holbrook	251	" Left yesterday morning ? "
172336	172356	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" Yes , sir . They went away to Liverpool ; they are going to America to New York . "
172357	172367	172291	172292	Mrs. Holbrook	251	" Mr. Nowell and his daughter , Mrs. Holbrook ? "
172368	172380	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" Yes , sir , that was the lady 's name . "
172381	172386	172388	172388	Gilbert	178	" It 's impossible , "
172390	172429	172388	172388	Gilbert	178	" utterly impossible that Mrs. Holbrook would go to America ! She has ties that would keep her in England ; a husband whom she would never abandon in that manner . There must be some mistake here . "
172430	172537	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" O no , indeed , sir , there 's no mistake . I saw all the luggage labelled with my own eyes , and the direction was New York by steam - packet Oronoco ; and Mrs. Holbrook had lots of dresses made , and all sorts of things . And as to her husband , sir , her father told me that he 'd treated her very badly , and that she never meant to go back to him again to be made unhappy by him . She was going to New York to live with Mr. Nowell all the rest of her life . "
172538	172564	172388	172388	Gilbert	178	" There must have been some treachery , some underhand work , to bring this about . Did she go of her own free will ? "
172565	172606	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" O , dear me , yes , sir . Mr. Nowell was kindness itself to her , and she was very fond of him , and pleased to go to America , as far as I could make out . "
172607	172616	172388	172388	Gilbert	178	" And she never seemed depressed or unhappy ? "
172617	172692	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" I never noticed her being so , sir . They were out a good deal , you see ; for Mr. Nowell was a gay gentleman , very fond of pleasure , and he would have Mrs. Holbrook always with him . They were away in Paris ever so long , in January and the beginning of February , but kept on the lodgings all the same . They were very good lodgers . "
172693	172699	172388	172388	Gilbert	178	" Had they many visitors ? "
172700	172747	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" No , sir ; scarcely any one except a gentleman who used to come sometimes of an evening , and sit drinking spirits - and - water with Mr. Nowell ; he was his lawyer , I believe , but I never heard his name . "
172748	172763	172388	172388	Gilbert	178	" Did no one come here yesterday to inquire for Mrs. Holbrook towards evening ? "
172764	172896	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" Yes , sir ; there was a gentleman came in a cab . He looked very ill , as pale as death , and was in a dreadful way when he found they were gone . He asked me a great many questions , the same as you 've asked me , and I think I never saw any one so cut - up as he seemed . He did n't say much about that either , but it was easy to see it in his face . He wanted to look at the apartments , to see whether he could find anything , an old letter or such - like , that might be a help to him in going after his friends , and mother took him upstairs . "
172897	172903	172388	172388	Gilbert	178	" Did he find anything ? "
172904	172943	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" No , sir ; Mr. Nowell had n't left so much as a scrap of paper about the place . So the gentleman thanked mother , and went away in the same cab as had brought him . "
172944	172953	172388	172388	Gilbert	178	" Do you know where he was going ? "
172954	172998	172303	172304	the girl	5090	" I fancy he was going to Liverpool after Mr. Nowell and his daughter . He seemed all in a fever , like a person that 's ready to do anything desperate . But I heard him tell the cabman Cavendish - square . "
172999	173021	172388	172388	Gilbert	178	" Cavendish - square ! Yes , I can guess where he was going . But what could he want there ? "
173057	173072	173074	173074	Gilbert	178	" Thank you for answering my questions so patiently , and good - night , "
173107	173110	173111	173111	he	178	" Stay , "
173121	173146	173111	173111	he	178	" if you should hear anything farther of these people , I should be much obliged by your sending me word at that address . "
173147	173177	173111	173111	he	178	" I wo n't forget , sir ; not that I think we 're likely to hear any more of them , they being gone straight off to America . "
173178	173193	173111	173111	he	178	" Perhaps not . But if you do hear anything , let me know . "
173395	173419	173420	173420	Gilbert	178	" Yet criminals have been traced upon the other side of the Atlantic , where the police have been prompt to follow them , "
173438	173498	173420	173420	Gilbert	178	" but not often where they 've got anything like a start . Did John Saltram really mean to follow those two to Liverpool , I wonder ? Such a journey would seem like madness , in his state ; and yet what a triumph if he should have been in time to prevent their starting by the Oronoco ! "
173510	173567	173506	173506	he	178	" What could he want with Mrs. Branston , at a time when every moment was precious ? Money , perhaps . He could have had none with him . Yes , money , no doubt ; but I shall discover that from her presently , and may learn something of his plans into the bargain . "
173814	173826	173827	173827	he	178	" John Saltram was with you yesterday evening , Mrs. Branston , "
173830	173854	173827	173827	he	178	" Pray tell me the purpose that brought him here , and anything you know of his plan of action after leaving you . "
173855	173897	173773	173774	Adela Branston	212	" I can tell you very little about that . He was going upon a journey he told me , that evening , immediately indeed ; a most important journey ; but he did not tell me where he was going . "
173898	173906	173908	173908	Gilbert	178	" I think I can guess that , "
173910	173917	173908	173908	Gilbert	178	" Did he seem much agitated ? "
173918	174036	173773	173774	Adela Branston	212	" No ; he was quite calm ; but he had a resolute air , like a man who has some great purpose to achieve . I thought him looking very white and weak , and told him that I was sure he was too ill to start upon a long journey , or any journey . I begged him not to go , if it were possible to avoid going , and used every argument I could think of to persuade him to abandon the idea of such a thing . But it was all no use . ' If I had only a dozen hours to live , I must go , ' he said . "
174037	174053	173908	173908	Gilbert	178	" He came to ask you for money for his journey , did he not ? "
174054	174115	173773	173774	Adela Branston	212	" He did . I suppose to so close a friend as you are to him , there can be no breach of confidence in my admitting that . He came to borrow any ready - money I might happen to have in the house . Fortunately , I had a hundred and twenty pounds by me in hard cash . "
174116	174129	174131	174131	Gilbert	178	" And he took that ? he wanted as much as that ? "
174134	174149	173773	173774	Adela Branston	212	" Yes , he said he was likely to require as much as that . "
174150	174161	173773	173774	Adela Branston	212	" Then he must have thought of going to America . "
174162	174176	174178	174179	Mrs. Branston	214	" To America ! travel to America in his weak state of health ? "
174183	174236	173773	173774	Adela Branston	212	" Yes . It seems like madness , does it not ? But there are circumstances under which a man may be excused for being almost mad . John Saltram has gone in pursuit of some one very dear to him , some one who has been separated from him by treachery . "
174237	174241	174242	174243	Adela Branston	212	" A woman ? "
174276	174293	174294	174294	Gilbert	178	" I can not stop to answer a single question now , my dear Mrs. Branston , "
174298	174350	174294	174294	Gilbert	178	" You shall know all by - and - by , and I am sure your generous heart will forgive any wrong that has been done you in this business . Good night . I have to catch a train at a quarter to eleven ; I am going to Liverpool . "
174351	174356	174250	174250	she	212	" After Mr. Saltram ? "
174357	174386	174294	174294	Gilbert	178	" Yes ; I do not consider him in a fitting condition to travel alone . I hope to be in time to prevent his doing anything rash . "
174387	174395	174250	174250	she	212	" But how will you find him ? "
174396	174416	174294	174294	Gilbert	178	" I must make a round of the hotels till I discover his head - quarters . Good night . "
174417	174430	174250	174250	she	212	" Let me order my carriage to take you to the station . "
174431	174477	174294	174294	Gilbert	178	" A thousand thanks , but I shall be there before your carriage would be ready . I can pick up a cab close by and shall have time to call at my lodgings for a carpet - bag . Once more , good night . "
175007	175021	175022	175022	he	246	" I shall take my passage in her in case of the worst , "
175025	175171	175022	175022	he	246	" and if I can not see Marian and persuade her to come on shore with me , I must go with her to New York . Heaven knows what power her father may use against me in the brief opportunity I shall have for seeing her before the vessel starts ; but he ca n't prevent my being their fellow - passenger , and once afloat it shall go hard with me if I can not make my dear girl hear reason . Do not be uneasy about my health , dear old friend ; you see how well I am keeping up under all this strain upon body and mind . You will see me come back from America a new man , strong enough to prove my gratitude for your devotion , in some shape or other , I trust in God . "
175332	175423	175290	175290	He	4332	" Mr. Nowell , sir ; upon my word , sir , I ca n't say . Yes , there is a gentleman of that name on board ; state - rooms number 5 and 7 ; got a daughter with him tall dark gentleman , with a moustache and beard . Yes , sir , he was on deck just now , on the bridge ; but I do n't see him , I suppose he 's gone below . Better look for him in the saloon , sir . "
175663	175671	175672	175673	John Saltram	246	" Slander and lies are very strong , "
175678	175731	175676	175676	himself	246	" but I do not think , when my dear love and I are once face to face , any power on earth can prevail against me . She must be changed indeed , if it can ; she must be changed indeed , if anything but a lie can part us . "
175989	175993	175985	175985	she	251	" waterproof cloak , "
175995	175998	175971	175971	she	251	" Maud , "
176000	176005	175971	175971	she	251	" travelling - bag , "
176007	176012	176013	176013	He	246	" dressing - case . "
176034	176037	176038	176038	she	251	" Yes , "
176042	176080	176038	176038	she	251	" Mrs. Holbrook was on board state - room number 7 . She had gone to her room at once , but would appear at dinner - time , no doubt , if she was n't ill . "
176099	176114	176081	176082	John Saltram	246	" I am here , Marian ; let me see you for God 's sake .
176115	176119	176081	176082	John Saltram	246	" JOHN HOLBROOK . "
176120	176139	176140	176140	he	246	" If you 'll take that to the lady in number 7 , I shall be exceedingly obliged , "
176161	176172	176081	176082	John Saltram	246	" Yes , sir , this very minute , sir . "
176472	176487	176488	176488	she	4355	" The lady says she is too ill to see any one , sir , "
176493	176505	176488	176488	she	4355	" but under any circumstances she must decline to see you . "
176506	176516	176458	176459	The stewardess	4355	" She said that my wife told you that ? "
176517	176554	176488	176488	she	4355	" Your wife , sir ! Good gracious me , is the lady in number 7 your wife ? She came on board with her father , and I understood they were only two in party . "
176555	176589	176458	176459	The stewardess	4355	" Yes ; she came with her father . Her father 's treachery has separated her from me ; but a few words would explain everything , if I could only see her . "
176630	176640	176641	176641	he	4370	" Did Mrs. Holbrook positively decline to see me ? "
176665	176672	176674	176675	the stewardess	4355	" She did indeed , sir , "
176677	176797	176674	176675	the stewardess	4355	" Nothing could be more positive than her manner . I told her how anxious you seemed for I could see it in your face , you see , sir , when you gave me the paper and I really did n't like to bring you such a message ; but it was no use . ' I decline to see him , ' the lady said , ' and be sure you bring me no more messages from this gentleman ; ' and with that , sir , she tore up the bit of paper , as cool as could be . But , dear me , sir , how ill you do look , to be sure ! "
176798	176817	176674	176675	the stewardess	4355	" I have been very ill . I came from a sick - room to follow my wife . "
176818	176849	176674	176675	the stewardess	4355	" Had n't you better go and lie down a little , sir ? You look as if you could scarcely stand . Shall I fetch the steward for you ? "
176850	176887	176674	176675	the stewardess	4355	" No , thanks . I can find my way to my berth , I daresay . Yes , I suppose I had better go and lie down . I can do no more yet awhile . "
176956	176980	176981	176981	he	4373	" As soon as I am able to stand again , I will see her father , and exact a reckoning from him , "
177139	177154	177155	177155	he	246	" For pity 's sake , do n't bore me with any more doctors ! "
177159	177207	177155	177155	he	246	" I have had enough of that kind of thing . The man can do nothing for me . I am knocked up with over exertion and excitement that 's all ; my strength will come back to me sooner or later if I lie quietly here . "
177482	177501	177503	177504	the doctor	6141	" He has evidently been suffering from serious illness lately , and has been over - exerting himself , "
177506	177538	177503	177504	the doctor	6141	" that seems very clear . We shall contrive to bring him round in a few days , I daresay , though he certainly has got into a very low state . "
177644	177655	177657	177658	the passenger	4397	" He 's not going to die , is he ? "
177665	177684	177686	177687	the surgeon	1540	" O dear , no , I should hope not . I have no apprehension of that sort , "
177712	177723	177724	177724	he	1540	" There is an extreme debility , that is all , "
177730	177753	177724	177724	he	1540	" and if we can induce him to take plenty of nourishment , we shall get on very well , I daresay . "
178010	178017	178018	178019	the steward	4360	" She 's a hard one ! "
178180	178180	178165	178166	his wife	549	"
178181	178190	178192	178193	the stewardess	4355	" I 've no common patience with her , "
178197	178249	178192	178193	the stewardess	4355	" the cold - hearted creature ! flaunting about like that , with a sick husband within a stone 's throw of her . Suppose he is to blame , Mr. Martin ; whatever his faults may have been , it is n't the time for a wife to remember them . "
178482	178508	178469	178470	Mr. Martin	338	" He 's in the saloon , sir , reading , quite alone . You could n't have a better opportunity of speaking to him . "
178509	178523	178432	178433	the steward	4360	" That 's a good fellow . Then I 'll go at once . "
178524	178553	178469	178470	Mr. Martin	338	" You 'd better take my arm , sir ; you 're as weak as a baby , and the ship lurches a good deal to - day . "
178554	178599	178432	178433	the steward	4360	" I 'm not very strong , certainly . I begin to think I never shall be strong again . Do you know , Martin , I was once stroke in a university eight . Not much vigour in my biceps now , eh ? "
178687	178694	178696	178698	the sick man	3190	" Mr. Nowell , I believe , "
178738	178754	178701	178702	the other	595	" Yes , my name is Nowell . But I have really not the honour to "
178755	178762	178764	178765	John Saltram	246	" You do not know me , "
178767	178788	178764	178765	John Saltram	246	" No , but it is time you did so . I am your daughter 's husband , John Holbrook . "
178789	178819	178701	178702	the other	595	" Indeed . I have heard that she has been persecuted by the messages of some person calling himself her husband . You are that person , I presume . "
178820	178847	178764	178765	John Saltram	246	" I have tried to persuade my wife to see me . Yes ; and I mean to see her before this vessel arrives in port . "
178848	178864	178701	178702	the other	595	" But if the lady in question refuses to have anything to say to you ? "
178865	178957	178764	178765	John Saltram	246	" We shall soon put that to the test . I have been too ill to stir ever since I came on board , or you would have heard of me before this , Mr. Nowell . Now that I can move about once more , I shall find a way to assert my claims , you may be sure . But in the first place , I want to know by what right you stole my wife away from her home by what right you brought her on this voyage ? "
178958	179056	178701	178702	the other	595	" Before I answer that question , Mr. Mr. Holbrook , as you choose to call yourself , I 'll ask you another . By what right do you call yourself my daughter 's husband ? what evidence have you to produce to prove that you are not a bare - faced impostor ? You do n't carry your marriage - certificate about with you , I daresay ; and in the absence of some kind of documentary evidence , what is to convince me that you are what you pretend to be my daughter 's husband ? "
179057	179082	178764	178765	John Saltram	246	" The evidence of your daughter 's own senses . Place me face to face with her ; she will not deny my identity . "
179083	179120	178701	178702	the other	595	" But how , if my daughter declines to see you , as she does most positively ? She has suffered enough at your hands , and is only too glad to be released from you . "
179121	179139	179141	179142	John Saltram	246	" She has suffered she is glad to be released ! Why , you most consummate scoundrel ! "
179144	179344	179141	179142	John Saltram	246	" there never was an unkind word spoken between my wife and me ! She was the best , most devoted of women ; and nothing but the vilest treachery could have separated us . I know not what villanous slander you have made her believe , or by what means you lured her away from me ; but I know that a few words between us would let in the light upon your plot . You had better make the best of a bad position , Mr. Nowell . As my wife 's father , you know , you are pretty sure to escape . Whatever my inclination might be , my regard for her would make me indulgent to you . You 'll find candour avail you best in this case , depend upon it . Your daughter has inherited a fortune , and you want to put your hand upon it altogether . It would be wiser to moderate your desires , and be content with a fair share of the inheritance . Your daughter is not the woman to treat you ungenerously , nor am I the man to create any hindrance to her generosity . "
179345	179356	179358	179359	Mr. Nowell	201	" I can make no bargain with you , sir , "
179376	179461	179358	179359	Mr. Nowell	201	" nor am I prepared to admit your claim to the position you assume . But if my daughter is your wife , she left you of her own free will , under no coercion of mine ; and she must return to you in the same manner , or you must put the machinery of the law in force to compel her . And that , I flatter myself , in a free country like America , will be rather a difficult business . "
179505	179512	179513	179513	he	246	" You are an outrageous scoundrel ! "
179541	179554	179532	179533	Mr. Nowell	201	" You are a most consummate villain , and you know it ! "
179555	179562	179564	179565	Mr. Nowell	201	" Hard words mean so little , "
179568	179666	179564	179565	Mr. Nowell	201	" and go for so little . That kind of language before witnesses would be actionable ; but , upon my word , it would be mere child 's play on my part to notice it , especially to a man in your condition . You 'd better claim your wife from the captain , and see what he will say to you . I have told him that there 's some semi - lunatic on board , who pretends to be Mrs. Holbrook 's husband ; so he 'll be quite prepared to hear your statement . "
180666	180669	180670	180670	he	246	" Marian , "
180678	180700	180670	180670	he	246	" let go that man 's arm . You will leave this vessel with me , and with no one else . "
180701	180710	180712	180713	Percival Nowell	201	" Stand out of the way , fellow , "
180715	180726	180712	180713	Percival Nowell	201	" my daughter can have nothing to say to you . "
180727	180764	180771	180771	his	246	" Marian , for God 's sake , obey me ! There is the vilest treachery in this man 's conduct . Let go his arm . My love , my darling , come with me ! "
180780	180783	180784	180784	he	246	" Marian ! "
180801	180810	180784	180784	he	246	" Marian , I will have some answer ! "
180811	180820	180822	180823	Percival Nowell	201	" You have had your answer , sir , "
180831	180881	180822	180823	Percival Nowell	201	" This lady does not know you . Do you want to make a scene , and render yourself ridiculous to every one here ? There are plenty of lunatic asylums in New York that will accommodate you , if you are determined to make yourself eligible for them . "
180882	180885	180887	180888	John Saltram	246	" Marian ! "
180899	180906	180887	180888	John Saltram	246	" Marian , speak to me ! "
180946	180953	180954	180954	he	246	" This must be some impostor , "
180957	180964	180954	180954	he	246	" this is not my wife . "
182205	182221	182222	182223	Mrs. Tadman	307	" He would always see to the fastenings of the house with his own eyes , "
182226	182264	182222	182223	Mrs. Tadman	307	" but up to last autumn he used to go upstairs with me and the servants . It 's a new thing for him to sit up drinking his glass of grog in the parlour by himself . "
182755	182787	182788	182788	Martha	286	" If it was n't for Mrs. Tadman driving and worrying after me all the time I 'm at work , I do n't think I could stay there , mum , "
182793	182818	182788	182788	Martha	286	" It is n't often I like to be fidgetted and followed ; but anything 's better than being alone in that unked place . "
182819	182831	182832	182832	Ellen	329	" It 's rather dark and dreary , certainly , Martha , "
182841	182862	182832	182832	Ellen	329	" but , as we have n't any of us got to live there , that does n't much matter . "
182863	182932	182788	182788	Martha	286	" It is n't that , mum . I would n't mind the darkness and the dreariness and I 'm sure such a place for spiders I never did see in my life ; there was one as I took down with my broom to - day , and scrunched , as big as a small crab but it 's worse than that : the place is haunted . "
182933	182939	182832	182832	Ellen	329	" Who told you that ? "
182940	182944	182788	182788	Martha	286	" Sarah Batts . "
182945	182977	182832	182832	Ellen	329	" Sarah Batts ! Why , how should she know anything about it ? She has n't been here so long as you ; and she came straight from the workhouse . "
182978	182989	182788	182788	Martha	286	" I think master must have told her , mum . "
182990	183038	182832	182832	Ellen	329	" Your master would never have said anything so foolish . I know that he does n't believe in ghosts ; and he keeps all his garden - seeds in the locked room at the end of the passage ; so he must go there sometimes himself . "
183039	183065	182788	182788	Martha	286	" O yes , mum ; I know that master goes there . I 've seen him go that way at night with a candle . "
183066	183099	182832	182832	Ellen	329	" Well , you silly girl , he would n't use the room if he thought it was haunted , would he ? There are plenty more empty rooms in the house . "
183100	183216	182788	182788	Martha	286	" I do n't know about that , I 'm sure , mum ; but anyhow I know Sarah Batts told me that passage was haunted . ' Do n't you never go there , Martha , ' she says , ' unless you want to have your blood froze . I 've heard things there that have froze mine . ' And I never should go , mum , if it was n't for moth Mrs. Tadman 's worrying and driving , about the place being cleaned once in a way . And Sarah Batts is right , mum , however she may have got to know it ; for I have heard things . "
183217	183221	182832	182832	Ellen	329	" What things ? "
183222	183273	182788	182788	Martha	286	" Moaning and groaning like , as if it was some one in pain ; but all very low ; and I never could make out where it came from . But as to the place being haunted , I 've no more doubt about it than about my catechism . "
183274	183295	182832	182832	Ellen	329	" But , Martha , you ought to know it 's very silly and wicked to believe in such things , "
183319	183341	183317	183317	her	329	" The moanings and groanings , as you call them , were only sounds made by the wind , I daresay . "
183342	183349	183350	183350	Martha	286	" O dear no , mum , "
183361	183404	183354	183354	her	286	" the wind never made such noises as I heard . But I do n't want to make you nervous , mum ; only I 'd sooner lose a month 's wages than stay for an hour alone in the west wing . "
183526	183532	183533	183533	she	307	" Ah , my dear , "
183550	183606	183533	183533	she	307	" when you 've lived as long as I have , and gone through what I 've gone through , and have got such a liver as I 've got , you 'll know what bad health means . But at your age , and with your constitution , it 's nothing more than fancy . "
183931	183945	183946	183946	he	463	" I 'll have it out of the mean hound sooner or later , "
184065	184074	184075	184075	Gilbert	178	" I have schooled myself to forgive him , "
184081	184171	184075	184075	Gilbert	178	" for I know that he loves her and that must needs condone my wrongs . I look forward anxiously to their return from America , and hope for a happy reunion amongst us all when your warm friendship shall not be forgotten . I am waiting impatiently for news from New York , and will write to you again directly I hear anything definite . We have suffered the torments of suspense for a long weary time , but I trust and believe that the sky is clearing . "
184321	184335	184336	184336	he	593	" So she 's gone to America with her father , has she ? "
184347	184392	184336	184336	he	593	" I should n't have thought anybody could have persuaded her to leave that precious husband of hers . And she 's gone off to America , and he after her ! That 's rather a queer start , ai n't it , Nell ? "
184424	184438	184439	184439	she	274	" I do n't suppose you care whether she 's alive or dead , "
184455	184455	184439	184439	she	274	"
184456	184507	184410	184410	his	593	" Need n't I ? O , she 's too grand a person to be talked of by such as me , is she ? Never mind , Nell ; do n't be cross . And when Mrs. Holbrook comes back to England , you shall go and see her . "
184508	184512	184514	184514	Ellen	176	" I will , "
184516	184528	184514	184514	Ellen	176	" if I have to walk to London to do it . "
184529	184568	184410	184410	his	593	" O , but you sha'n't walk . You shall go by rail . I 'll spare you the money for that , for once in a way , though I 'm not over fond of wasting money . "
186213	186224	186225	186225	he	273	" Why the have n't you got a fire here ? "
186229	186238	186240	186241	Mrs. Tadman	307	" It was your own wish , Stephen , "
186243	186352	186225	186225	he	273	" My own fiddlesticks ! Of course I did n't care to see my wood and coals burning to waste when the sun was shining enough to melt any one . But when a man comes home wet to the skin , he does n't want to come into a room like an ice - house . Call the girl , and tell her to light a blazing fire while I go and change my clothes . Let her bring plenty of wood , and put a couple of logs on top of the coals . I 'm frozen to the very bones driving home in the rain . "
186367	186374	186375	186375	she	307	" That 's just like Stephen , "
186378	186413	186375	186375	she	307	" if it was you or me that wanted a fire , we might die of cold before we got leave to light one ; but he never grudges anything for his own comfort ! "
186860	186872	186873	186875	the doleful Tadman	4679	" Not that I mean any unkindness to you , Ellen , "
186879	186942	186873	186875	the doleful Tadman	4679	" for you 've been a good friend to me , and if there 's one merit I can lay claim to , it 's a grateful heart ; but of course , when a man marries , he never is the same to his relations as when he was single . It is n't in human nature that he should be . "
187216	187227	187228	187228	he	177	" There 's nothing like being on the safe side , "
187239	187258	187228	187228	he	177	" I do n't want to be laid up with the rheumatics , if I can help it . "
187471	187474	187475	187475	she	176	" Stephen , "
187486	187491	187475	187475	she	176	" what was that ? "
187688	187691	187692	187692	she	176	" Stephen ! "
188038	188049	188050	188050	he	383	" Lord a mercy , mum , be that you ? "
188068	188088	188095	188095	he	383	" let me get ' ee out o ' this ; the old place'll burn like so much tinder ; "
188178	188181	188182	188182	Ellen	176	" Robert , "
188198	188240	188182	188182	Ellen	176	" for God 's sake , go and see what has become of your master . We left him drinking in the parlour last night . I 've called to him again and again , but there 's been no answer . "
188241	188320	188182	188182	Ellen	176	" Do n't you take on , mum ; master 's all right , I daresay . Here be the gals and Mrs. Tadman coming downstairs ; they 'll take care o ' you , while I go and look arter him . You 've no call to be frightened . If the fire should come this way , you 've only got to open yon door and get out into the yard . You 're safe here . "
188784	188788	188779	188779	she	307	" little all . "
188886	188889	189018	189019	Mrs. Tadman	307	" box . "
188890	188897	188898	188898	she	332	" There was money in it , "
188901	188921	188898	188898	she	332	" money ! Oh , do n't you think the men could get to my room and save it ? "
188922	188925	188927	188928	Mrs. Tadman	307	" Money ! "
188944	188982	188927	188928	Mrs. Tadman	307	" you must be cleverer than I took you for , Sarah Batts , to be able to save money , and yet be always bedizened with some new bit of finery , as you 've been . "
188983	188990	188991	188991	Sarah	332	" It was give to me , "
188995	189006	188991	188991	Sarah	332	" by them as had a right to give it . "
189007	189016	189018	189019	Mrs. Tadman	307	" For no good , I should think , "
189021	189030	189018	189019	Mrs. Tadman	307	" what should anybody give you money for ? "
189031	189059	188991	188991	Sarah	332	" Never you mind ; it was mine . O dear , O dear ! if one of the men would only get my box for me . "
189355	189358	189359	189359	she	329	" Stephen ! "
189362	189396	189359	189359	she	329	" O , thank God you are here ! I thought you were shut up in that burning house . I called with all my might , and the men searched for you . "
189397	189407	189409	189410	the farmer	3092	" It is n't much to be thankful for , "
189412	189540	189409	189410	the farmer	3092	" I do n't suppose there 's an hour 's life in me ; I 'm scorched from head to foot , and one arm 's helpless . I woke up all of a sudden , and found the room in a blaze . The flames had burst out of the great beam that goes across the chimney - piece . The place was all on fire , so that I could n't reach the door anyhow ; and before I could get out of the window , I was burnt like this . You 'd have been burnt alive in your bed but for me . I threw up a handful of gravel at your window . It must have woke you , did n't it ? "
189541	189579	189616	189616	She	549	" Yes , yes , that was the sound that woke me ; it seemed like a pistol going off . You saved my life , Stephen . It was very good of you to remember me . "
189580	189599	189409	189410	the farmer	3092	" Yes ; there 's men in my place who would n't have thought of anybody but themselves . "
189600	189611	189613	189614	his wife	549	" Can I do anything to ease you , Stephen ? "
189661	189682	189639	189639	She	549	" No , nothing ; till they come to carry me away somewhere . I 'm all one burning pain . "
190099	190104	190105	190105	he	344	" The west wing , "
190108	190113	190105	190105	he	344	" is that burnt ? "
190114	190136	190162	190163	His wife	549	" No , Stephen , not yet ; but there 's little hope they 'll save any part of the house . "
190137	190161	190105	190105	he	344	" They must save that ; the rest do n't matter I 'm insured heavily ; but they must save the west wing . "
190297	190308	190267	190267	He	273	" The west wing is the west wing afire yet ? "
190309	190342	190267	190267	He	273	" The wind blows that way , Stephen , and the flames are spreading . I do n't think they could save it not if the engine was to come this minute . "
190343	190351	190353	190354	Stephen Whitelaw	273	" But I tell you they must ! "
190356	190469	190353	190354	Stephen Whitelaw	273	" If they do n't , it 'll be murder cold - blooded murder . O , my God , I never thought there was much harm in the business and it paid me well but it 's weighed me down like a load of lead , and made me drink more to drown thought . But if it should come to this do n't you understand ? Do n't sit staring at me like that . If the fire gets to the west wing , it will be murder . There 's some one there some one locked up that wo n't be able to stir unless they get her out . "
190470	190486	190267	190267	He	273	" Some one locked up in the west wing ! Are you mad , Stephen ? "
190487	190524	190353	190354	Stephen Whitelaw	273	" It 's the truth . I would n't do it again no , not for twice the money . Let them get her out somehow . They can do it , if they look sharp . "
190646	190651	190652	190652	she	329	" In which room ? "
190751	190760	190761	190761	he	463	" Thank God you 're safe , lass ! "
190778	190802	190761	190761	he	463	" Our men saw the fire when they were going to their work , and I came across directly . Where 's Steph ? "
190803	190868	190772	190772	he	463	" Under the trees yonder , very much hurt ; I 'm afraid fatally . But there 's nothing we can do for him till the doctor comes . There 's someone in still greater danger , father . For God 's sake , help us to save her some one shut up yonder , in a room at that end of the house . "
190869	190884	190761	190761	he	463	" Some one shut up ! One of the servants , do you mean ? "
190885	190926	190772	190772	he	463	" No , no , no . Some one who has been kept shut up there hidden ever so long . Stephen told me just now . O , father , for pity 's sake , try to save her ! "
190927	190984	190761	190761	he	463	" Nonsense , lass . Your husband 's brain must have been wandering . Who should be shut up there , and you live in the house and not know it ? Why should Stephen hide any one in his house ? What motive could he have for such a thing ? It is n't possible . "
190985	191064	190772	190772	he	463	" I tell you , father , it is true . There was no mistaking Stephen 's words just now , and , besides that , I 've heard noises that might have told me as much , only I thought the house was haunted . I tell you there is some one some one who 'll be burnt alive if we 're not quick and every moment 's precious . Wo n't you try to save her ? "
191065	191090	190761	190761	he	463	" Of course I will . Only I do n't want to risk my life for a fancy . Is there a ladder anywhere ? "
191091	191101	190772	190772	he	463	" Yes , yes . The men have ladders . "
191102	191117	190761	190761	he	463	" And where 's this room where you say the woman is shut up ? "
191118	191126	191128	191128	Ellen	329	" At that corner of the house , "
191132	191165	190761	190761	he	463	" There 's a door at the end of the passage , but no window looking this way . There 's only one , and that 's over the wood - yard . "
191166	191178	190761	190761	he	463	" Then it would be easiest to get in that way ? "
191179	191206	190761	190761	he	463	" No , no , father . The wood 's all piled up above the window . It would take such a time to move it . "
191207	191240	190761	190761	he	463	" Never mind that . Anything 's better than the risk of going into yonder house . Besides , the room 's locked , you say . Have you got the key ? "
191241	191255	190761	190761	he	463	" No ; but I could get it from Stephen , I daresay . "
191256	191275	190761	190761	he	463	" We wo n't wait for you to try . We 'll begin at the wood - yard . "
191276	191292	190761	190761	he	463	" Take Robert Dunn with you , father . He 's a good brave fellow . "
191293	191301	190761	190761	he	463	" Yes , I 'll take Dunn . "
191636	191646	191648	191649	Mr. Carley	269	" We do n't want the fire - escape , "
191660	191695	191648	191649	Mr. Carley	269	" The room we want to get at is n't ten feet from the ground . You can give us a hand with this wood if you like . That 's all we want . "
191950	191966	191967	191967	he	270	" Help me to carry her away yonder , while Robert gets the cart ready , "
191978	191987	191967	191967	he	270	" And then he added in a whisper , "
192007	192007	192004	192005	Mrs. Holbrook	251	"
192349	192353	192354	192354	she	5298	" O God ! "
192357	192363	192354	192354	she	5298	" am I set free ? "
192364	192401	192305	192305	her	5298	" Yes , dear Mrs. Holbrook , you are free , never again to go back to that cruel place . O , to think that you should be used so , and I so near ! "
192421	192440	192404	192404	her	169	" Ellen , is it you ? Then I am safe ; I must be safe with you . "
192441	192479	192402	192402	Marian	169	" Safe ! yes , dear . I would die sooner than any harm should come to you again . Who could have brought this cruelty about ? who could have shut you up in that room ? "
192480	192484	192485	192485	Marian	169	" My father , "
192491	192514	192485	192485	Marian	169	" He wanted my money , I suppose ; and instead of killing me , he shut me up in that place . "
192582	192760	192573	192573	she	169	" O , Ellen , if I were to tell you what I have suffered ! But no , there are no words can tell that . It 's not that they ill - used me . The girl who waited on me brought me good food , and even tried to make me comfortable in her rough way ; but to sit there day after day , Ellen , alone , with only a dim light from the top of the window above the wood - stack ; to sit there wondering about my husband , whether he was searching for me still , and would ever find me , or whether , as was more likely , he had given me up for dead . Think of me , Ellen , if you can , sitting there for weeks and months in my despair , trying to reckon the days sometimes by the aid of some old newspaper which the girl brought me now and then , at other times losing count of them altogether . "
192761	192790	192573	192573	she	169	" Dear Mrs. Holbrook , I ca n't understand it even yet . Tell me how it all came about how they ever lured you into that place . "
192791	193108	192573	192573	she	169	" It was easy enough , Ellen ; I was n't conscious when they took me there . The story is very short . You remember that day when you left the Grange , how happy I was , looking forward to my husband 's return , and thinking of the good news I had to tell him . We were to be rich , and our lives free and peaceful henceforward ; and I had seen him suffer so much for the want of money . It was the morning after you left when the post brought me a letter from my father a letter with the Malsham post - mark . I had seen him in town , as you know , and was scarcely surprised that he should write to me . But I was surprised to find him so near me , and the contents of the letter were very perplexing . My father entreated me to meet him on the river - side pathway , between Malsham station and this house . He had been informed of my habits , he said , and that I was accustomed to walk there . That was curious , when , so far as I knew , he had never been near this place ; but I hardly thought about the strangeness of it then . He begged me so earnestly to see him ; it was a matter of life or death , he said . What could I do , Nelly ? He was my father , and I felt that I owed him some duty . I could not refuse to see him ; and if he had some personal objection to coming here , it seemed a small thing for me to take the trouble to go and meet him . I could but hear what he had to say . "
193109	193119	193121	193121	Ellen	329	" I wish to heaven I had been here ! "
193123	193139	193121	193121	Ellen	329	" you should n't have gone alone , if I had known anything about it . "
193140	193229	192573	192573	she	169	" I think , if you had been here , I should have told you about the letter , for it puzzled me a good deal , and I knew how well I could trust you . But you were away ; and my father 's request was so urgent the hour was named I could do nothing but accede to it . So I went , leaving no message for you or for my husband , feeling so sure of my return within an hour or two . "
193230	193240	193121	193121	Ellen	329	" And you found your father waiting for you ? "
193241	193515	192573	192573	she	169	" Yes , on the river - bank , within a short distance of Mr. Whitelaw 's house . He began by congratulating me on the change in my prospects , I was a rich woman , he said . And then he went on to vilify my husband in such hateful words , Ellen ; telling me that I had married a notorious scoundrel and profligate , and that he could produce ample evidence of what he affirmed ; and all this with a pretended pity for my weakness and ignorance of the world . I laughed his shameful slanders to scorn , and told him that I knew my husband too thoroughly to be alarmed even for a moment by such groundless charges . He still affected to compassionate me as the weakest and most credulous of women , and then came to a proposal which he said he had travelled to Hampshire on purpose to make to me . It was , that I should leave my husband , and place myself under his protection ; that I should go to America with him when he returned there , and so preserve my fortune from the clutches of a villain . ' My fortune ? ' I said ; ' yes , I see that it is that alone you are thinking of . How can you suppose me so blind as not to understand that ? You had better be candid with me , and say frankly what you want . I have no doubt my husband will allow me to make any reasonable sacrifice in your favour . ' "
193516	193524	193121	193121	Ellen	329	" What did he say to that ? "
193525	193596	192573	192573	she	169	" He laughed bitterly at my offer . ' Your husband ! ' he said ' I am not likely to see the colour of my father 's money , if you are to be governed by him . ' ' You do him a great wrong , ' I answered . ' I am sure that he will act generously , and I shall be governed by him . ' "
193597	193606	193121	193121	Ellen	329	" He was very angry , I suppose ? "
193607	193901	192573	192573	she	169	" No doubt of it ; but for some time he contrived to suppress all appearance of anger , and urged me to believe his statements about my husband , and to accept his offer of a home and protection with him . I can not tell you how plausible his words were what an appearance of affection and interest in my welfare he put on . Then , finding me firm , he changed his tone , and there were hidden threats mixed with his entreaties . It would be a bad thing for me if I refused to go with him , he said ; I would have cause to repent my folly for the rest of my life . He said a great deal , using every argument it is possible to imagine ; and there was always the same threatening under - tone . He could not move me in the least , as you may fancy , Nell . I told him that nothing upon earth would induce me to leave my husband , or to think ill of him . And in this manner we walked up and down for nearly two hours , till I began to feel very tired and faint . My father saw this , and when we came within sight of Wyncomb Farmhouse , proposed that I should go in and rest , and take a glass of milk or some kind of refreshment . I was surprised at this proposal , and asked him if he knew the people of the house . He said yes , he knew something of Mr. Whitelaw ; he had met him the night before in the coffee - room of the inn at Malsham . "
193902	193914	193121	193121	Ellen	329	" Then your father had slept at Malsham the night before ? "
193915	194149	192573	192573	she	169	" Evidently . His letter to me had been posted at Malsham , you know . I asked him how long he had been in this part of the country , and he rather evaded the question . Not long , he said ; and he had come down here only to see me . At first I refused to go into Mr. Whitelaw 's house , being only anxious to get home as quickly as possible . But my father seemed offended by this . I wanted to get rid of him , he said , although this was likely to be our last interview the very last time in his life that he would ever see me , perhaps . I could not surely grudge him half an hour more of my company . I could scarcely go on refusing after this ; and I really felt so tired and faint , that I doubted my capability of walking back to this house without resting . So I said yes , and we went into Wyncomb Farmhouse . The door was opened by a girl when my father knocked . There was no one at home , she told him ; but we were quite welcome to sit down in the parlour , and she would bring me a glass of fresh milk and a slice of bread - and - butter .
194150	194235	193121	193121	Ellen	329	" The house had a strange empty look , I thought . There was none of the life or bustle one expects to see at a farm ; all was silent as the grave . The gloom and quietness of the place chilled me somehow . There was a fire burning in the parlour , and my father made me sit down very close to it , and I think the heat increased that faintness which I had felt when I came into the house .
194236	194281	192573	192573	she	169	" Again and again he urged his first demand , seeming as if he would wear down all opposition by persistence . I was quite firm ; but the effect of all this argument was very wearisome , and I began to feel really ill .
194282	194536	193121	193121	Ellen	329	" I think I must have been on the point of fainting , when the door was opened suddenly , and Mr. Whitelaw came in . In the next moment , while the room was spinning round before my eyes , and that dreadful giddiness that comes before a dead faint was growing worse , my father snatched me up in his arms , and threw a handkerchief over my face . I had just sense enough to know that there was chloroform upon it , and that was all . When I opened my eyes again , I was lying on a narrow bed , in a dimly - lighted room , with a small fire burning in a rusty grate in one corner , and some tea - things , with a plate of cold meat , on a table near it . There was a scrap of paper on this table , with a few lines scrawled upon it in pencil , in my father 's hand : ' You have had your choice , either to share a prosperous life with me , or to be shut up like a mad woman . You had better make yourself as comfortable as you can , since you have no hope of escape till it suits my purpose to have you set free . Good care will be taken of you . You must have been a fool to suppose that I would submit to the injustice of J.N. 's will . '
194537	194695	192573	192573	she	169	" For a long time I sat like some stupid bewildered creature , going over these words again and again , as if I had no power to understand them . It was very long before I could believe that my father meant to shut me up in that room for an indefinite time for the rest of my life , perhaps . But , little by little , I came to believe this , and to feel nothing but a blank despair . O , Nelly , I dare not dwell upon that time ! I suffered too much . God has been very merciful to me in sparing me my mind ; for there were times when I believe I was quite mad . I could pray sometimes , but not always . I have spent whole days in prayer , almost as if I fancied that I could weary out my God with supplications . "
194696	194705	193121	193121	Ellen	329	" And Stephen ; did you see him ? "
194706	194984	192573	192573	she	169	" Yes , now and then once in several days , in a week perhaps . He used to come , like the master of a madhouse visiting his patients , to see that I was comfortable , he said . At first I used to appeal to him to set me free kneeling at his feet , promising any sacrifice of my fortune for him or for my father , if they would release me . But it was no use . He was as hard as a rock ; and at last I felt that it was useless , and used to see him come and go with hopeless apathy . No , Ellen , there are no words can describe what I suffered . I appealed to the girl who waited on me daily , but who came only once a - day , and always after dark . I might as well have appealed to the four walls of my room ; the girl was utterly stolid . She brought me everything I was likely to want from day to day , and gave me ample means of replenishing my fire , and told me that I ought to make myself comfortable . I had a much better life than any one in the workhouse , she said ; and I must be very wicked if I complained . I believe she really thought I was a harmless madwoman , and that her master had a right to shut me up in that room . One night , after I had been there for a time that seemed like eternity , my father came "
194985	194988	194990	194991	Ellen Whitelaw	329	" What ! "
194993	195044	194990	194991	Ellen Whitelaw	329	" the stranger ! I understand . That man was your father ; he came to see you that night ; and as he was leaving you , you gave that dreadful shriek we heard downstairs . O , if I had known the truth if I had only known ! "
195045	195056	195057	195057	Marian	169	" You heard me , Ellen ? You were there ? "
195109	195152	195062	195062	She	169	" Yes , yes , dear Mrs. Holbrook ; I was there , and I did not help you . But never mind that now ; tell me the rest of your story ; tell me how your father acted that night . "
195153	195284	195062	195062	She	169	" He was with me alone for about ten minutes ; he came to give me a last chance , he said . If I liked to leave my husband for ever , and go to America with him , I might do so ; but before he let me out of that place , he must have my solemn oath that I would make no attempt to see my husband ; that I would never again communicate with any one I had known up to that time ; that I would begin a new life , with him , my father , for my sole protector . I had had some experience of the result of opposing him , he said , and he now expected to find me reasonable .
195285	195524	195062	195062	She	169	" You can imagine my answer , Ellen . I would do anything , sacrifice anything , except my fidelity to my husband . Heaven knows I would have given twenty years of my life to escape from that dismal place , with the mere chance of being able to get back to my husband ; but I would not take a false oath ; I could not perjure myself , as that man would have made me perjure myself , in order to win my release . I knelt at his feet and clung about him , beseeching him with all the power I had to set me free ; but he was harder than iron . Just at the end , when he had the door open , and was leaving me , telling me that I had lost my last chance , and would never see him again , I clung about him with one wild desperate cry . He flung me back into the room violently , and shut the door in my face . I fancied afterwards that that cry must have been heard , and that , if there had been any creature in the house inclined to help me , there would have come an end to my sufferings . But the time passed , and there was no change ; only the long dreary days , the wretched sleepless nights . "
195689	195710	195711	195711	Ellen	329	" We will talk about everything , and arrange everything , by - and - by , dear Mrs. Holbrook , "
195715	195739	195711	195711	Ellen	329	" but for the present you must rest , and you must take everything that I bring you , and be very good . "
196305	196348	196349	196349	he	273	" And if I 've laid down a yard of drain - pipes since last year , I 've laid down a dozen mile . There 's not a bit of swampy ground or a patch of sour grass on the farm , "
196858	196877	196878	196878	he	6494	" Why , surely , Steph , you ca n't want a lawyer mixed up in the business ! "
196881	196940	196878	196878	he	6494	" Those sort of chaps only live by making work for one another . You know how to make your will well enough , old fellow , without any attorney 's aforesaids and hereinafters . Half a sheet of paper and a couple of sentences would do it , I should think ; the fewer words the better . "
196941	196956	196957	196958	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" I 'd rather have Pivott , and do it in a regular manner , "
196962	197051	196957	196958	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" I remember , in a forgery case that was in the papers the other day , how the judge said of the deceased testator , that , being a lawyer , he was too wise to make his own will . Yes , I 'd rather see Pivott , if you 'll send for him , Carley . It 's always best to be on the safe side . I do n't want my money wasted in a chancery suit when I 'm lying in my grave . "
197382	197404	197405	197405	he	270	" I think , Mr. Carley , it would be as well for our poor friend and I to be alone , "
197413	197416	197418	197419	the bailiff	6494	" Fiddlesticks ! "
197422	197472	197418	197419	the bailiff	6494	" It is n't likely that Stephen can have any secrets from his wife 's father . I 'm in nobody 's way , I 'm sure , and I 'm not going to put my spoke in the wheel , let him leave his money how he may . "
197473	197570	197405	197405	he	270	" Very likely not , my dear sir . Indeed , I am sure you would respect our poor friend 's wishes , even if they were to take a form unpleasing to yourself , which is far from likely . But still it may be as well for Mr. Whitelaw and myself to be alone . In cases of this kind the patient is apt to be nervous , and the business is done more expeditiously if there is no third party present . So , my dear Mr. Carley , if you have no objection "
197571	197574	197576	197577	the bailiff	6494	" Steph , "
197580	197598	197576	197577	the bailiff	6494	" do you want me out of the room ? Say the word , if you do . "
197612	197636	197599	197600	The patient	3251	" If it 's all the same to you , William Carley , I think I 'd sooner be alone with Mr. Pivott . "
197708	197721	197722	197722	he	270	" There 's some kind of devil 's work hatching up there , "
197727	197899	197722	197722	he	270	" Why should he want me out of the room ? He would n't , if he was going to leave all his money to Ellen , as he ought to leave it . Who else is there to get it ? Not that old mother Tadman , surely . She 's an artful old harridan ; and if my girl had not been a fool , she 'd have got rid of her out of hand when she married . Sure to goodness she can never stand between Stephen and his wife . And who else is there ? No one that I know of ; no one . Stephen would n't have kept any secret all these years from the folks he 's lived amongst . It is n't likely . He must leave it all to his wife , except a hundred or so , perhaps , to mother Tadman ; and it was nothing but his natural closeness that made him want me out of the way . "
197987	198012	198013	198014	the attorney	2155	" If you 'll step up here , and bring one of your men with you , I shall be obliged , Mr. Carley , "
198022	198037	198013	198014	the attorney	2155	" I want you to witness your son - in - law 's will . "
198193	198203	198204	198204	he	4943	" You 're wanted upstairs a minute , Joe , "
198296	198308	198309	198309	he	273	" I do n't think I could have done any better , "
198312	198342	198309	198309	he	273	" It 's a hard thing for a man of my age to leave everything behind him ; but I do n't see that I could have done better . "
198343	198363	198365	198366	the lawyer	5706	" You have done that , my dear sir , which might afford comfort to any death - bed , "
198381	198393	198394	198394	he	5706	" Our friend desires me to take charge of this document , "
198400	198435	198394	198394	he	5706	" You will have no reason to complain , on your daughter 's account , when you become familiar with its contents . She has been fairly treated I may say very fairly treated . "
198455	198464	198465	198465	he	5706	" I hope she has been well treated , "
198472	198535	198465	198465	he	5706	" She 's been a good wife to Stephen Whitelaw , and would continue so to be if he was to live twenty years longer . When a pretty young woman marries a man twice her age , she 's a right to expect handsome treatment , Mr. Pivott . It ca n't be too handsome for justice , in my opinion . "
198544	198553	198554	198554	he	5706	" As an interested party , Mr. Carley , "
198557	198678	198554	198554	he	5706	" your opinion is not as valuable as it might be under other circumstances . However , I do n't think your daughter will complain , and I am sure the world will applaud what our poor friend has done of his own accord , mind , Mr. Carley , wholly and solely of his own spontaneous desire . It is a thing that I should only have been too proud to suggest ; but the responsibility of such a suggestion is one which I could never have taken upon myself . It would have been out of my province , indeed . You will be kind enough to remember this by - and - by , my dear sir . "
198696	198706	198707	198707	he	6494	" I thought there was some devil 's work , "
198729	198762	198710	198710	himself	6494	" but what does it all mean ? and what has Stephen Whitelaw done with his money ? We shall know that pretty soon , anyhow . He ca n't last long . "
198867	198878	198879	198879	he	273	" It was Mrs. Holbrook 's father , you see , "
198887	199096	198879	198879	he	273	" that put it to me , how he might want his daughter taken care of for a time it might be a short time , or it might be rather a longish time , according to how circumstances should work out . We 'd met once before at the King 's Arms at Malsham , where Mr. Nowell was staying , and where I went in of an evening , once in a way , after market ; and he 'd made pretty free with me , and asked me a good many questions about myself , and told me a good bit about himself , in a friendly way . He told me how his daughter had gone against him , and was likely to go against him , and how some property that ought in common justice to have been left to him , had been left to her . He was going to give her a fair chance , he said , if she liked to leave her husband , who was a scheming scoundrel , and obey him . She might have a happy home with him , if she was reasonable . If not , he should use his authority as a father .
199097	199201	198879	198879	he	273	" He came to see me at Wyncomb next day dropped in unawares like , when mother Tadman was out of the way not that I had asked him , you see . He seemed to be quite taken with the place , and made me show him all over the house ; and then he took a glass of something , and sat and talked a bit , and went away , without having said a word about his daughter . But before he went he made me promise that I 'd go and see him at the King 's Arms that night .
199202	199316	198879	198879	he	273	" Well , you see , Nell , as he seemed to have taken a fancy to me , as you may say , and had told me he could put me up to making more of my money , and had altogether been uncommonly pleasant , I did n't care to say no , and I went . I was rather taken aback at the King 's Arms when they showed me to a private room , because I 'd met Mr. Nowell before in the Commercial ; however , there he was , sitting in front of a blazing fire , and with a couple of decanters of wine upon the table .
199317	199496	198879	198879	he	273	" He was very civil , could n't have been more friendly , and we talked and talked ; he was always harping on his daughter ; till at last he came out with what he wanted . Would I give her house - room for a bit , just to keep her out of the way of her husband and such - like designing people , supposing she should turn obstinate and refuse to go abroad with him ? ' You 've a rare old roomy place , ' he said . ' I saw some rooms upstairs at the end of a long passage which do n't seem to have been used for years . You might keep my lady in one of those ; and that fine husband of hers would be as puzzled where to find her as if she was in the centre of Africa . It would be a very easy thing to do , ' he said ; ' and it would be only friendly in you to do it . ' "
199497	199502	199504	199505	his wife	549	" O , Stephen ! "
199508	199520	199504	199505	his wife	549	" how could you ever consent to such a wicked thing ? "
199521	199532	199533	199534	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" I do n't know about the wickedness of it , "
199543	199729	199533	199534	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" a daughter is bound to obey her father , is n't she ? and if she do n't , I should think he had the power to do what he liked with her . That 's how I should look at it , if I was a father . It 's all very well to talk , you see , Nell , but you do n't know the arguments such a man as that can bring to bear . I did n't want to do it ; I was against it from the first . It was a dangerous business , and might bring me into trouble . But that man bore down upon me to that extent that he made me promise anything ; and when I went home that night , it was with the understanding that I was to fit up a room there was a double door to be put up to shut out sound , and a deal more ready for Mrs. Holbrook , in case her father wanted to get her out of the way for a bit . "
199730	199740	199741	199741	Ellen	329	" He promised to pay you , of course ? "
199762	199937	199533	199534	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" Well , yes , a man does n't put himself in jeopardy like that for nothing . He was to give me a certain sum of money down the first night that Mrs. Holbrook slept in my house ; and another sum of money before he went to America , and an annual sum for continuing to take care of her , if he wanted to keep her quiet permanently , as he might . Altogether it would be a very profitable business , he told me , and I ought to consider myself uncommonly lucky to get such a chance . As to the kindness or unkindness of the matter , it was better than shutting her up in a lunatic asylum , he said ; and he might have to do that , if I refused to take her . She was very weak in her head , he said , and the doctors would throw no difficulty in his way , if he wanted to put her into a madhouse . "
199938	199949	199951	199951	Ellen	329	" But you must have known that was a lie ! "
199954	199977	199951	199951	Ellen	329	" You had seen and talked to her ; you must have known that Mrs. Holbrook was as sane as you or I. "
199978	199992	199994	199995	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" I could n't be supposed to know better than her own father , "
200002	200189	199994	199995	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" he had a right to know best . However , it 's no use arguing about it now . He had such a power over me that I could n't go against him ; so I gave in , and Mrs. Holbrook came to Wyncomb . She was to be treated kindly and made comfortable , her father said ; that was agreed between us ; and she has been treated kindly and made comfortable . I had to trust some one to wait upon her , and when Mr. Nowell saw the two girls he chose Sarah Batts . ' That girl will do anything for money , ' he said ; ' she 's stupid , but she 's wise enough to know her own interest , and she 'll hold her tongue . ' So I trusted Sarah Batts , and I had to pay her pretty stiffly to keep the secret ; but she was a rare one to do the work , and she went about it as quiet as a mouse . Not even mother Tadman ever suspected her . "
200190	200204	200206	200206	Ellen	329	" It was a wicked piece of business wicked from first to last , "
200208	200218	200206	200206	Ellen	329	" I ca n't bear to hear about it . "
200262	200279	200280	200280	she	329	" Still I 'm grateful to you for telling me the truth at last , Stephen , "
200283	200327	200280	200280	she	329	" and , thank God , there 's no harm done that need last for ever . Thank God that dear young lady did not lose her life , shut up a prisoner in that miserable room , as she might have done . "
200328	200335	200337	200338	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" She had her victuals regular , "
200340	200345	200337	200338	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" and the best . "
200346	200363	200365	200365	Ellen	329	" Eating and drinking wo n't keep any one alive , if their heart 's breaking , "
200367	200395	200365	200365	Ellen	329	" but , thank heaven , her sufferings have come to an end now , and I trust God will forgive your share in them , Stephen . "
200605	200637	200638	200638	he	177	" If he could keep me alive as long as till next July , to see how those turnips answer with the new dressing , I 'd see him fast enough , "
200642	200658	200638	200638	he	177	" but he ca n't ; and I do n't want to hear his preaching . "
200659	200703	200581	200584	the vicar of Crosber	4965	" But it would be a comfort to you , surely , Stephen , to have him talk to you a little about the goodness and mercy of God . He wo n't tell you hard things , I 'm sure of that . "
200704	200721	200723	200724	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" No , I suppose he 'll try and make believe that death 's uncommon pleasant , "
200730	200796	200723	200724	Mr. Whitelaw	177	" as if it could be pleasant to any man to leave such a place as Wyncomb , after doing as much for the land , and spending as much labour and money upon it , as I have done . It 's like nurses telling children that a dose of physic 's pleasant ; they would n't like to have to take it themselves . "
200832	200849	200850	200850	he	177	" If it 's any satisfaction to you , Nell , I 'll see the parson , "
200853	200865	200850	200850	he	177	" His talk ca n't do me much harm , anyhow . "
201333	201349	201351	201352	the lawyer	5706	" Some degree of disappointment is perhaps excusable upon your part , my dear sir , "
201374	201508	201351	201352	the lawyer	5706	" but I am sure that in your calmer moments you will admit that the work to which your son - in - law has devoted the bulk of his accumulations is a noble one . For ages to come the sick and the suffering among our townsfolk will bless the name of Whitelaw . There is a touching reflection for you , Mr. Carley ! And really now , your amiable daughter , with an income of two hundred per annum to say nothing of that reversion which must fall in to her by - and - by on Mrs. Tadman 's decease is left in a very fair position . I should not have consented to draw up that will , sir , if I had considered it an unjust one . "
201509	201524	201526	201527	the bailiff	6494	" Then there 's a wide difference between your notion of justice and mine , "
201951	201964	201965	201965	Ellen	329	" He will come to - day , I have no doubt , "
202093	202098	202099	202099	he	178	" She is well ? "
202103	202180	202070	202070	her	329	" Yes , sir , she is as well as one could look for her to be , poor dear , after what she has gone through . But she is much changed since last you saw her . You must prepare yourself for that , sir . And she is very anxious about her husband . I do n't know how she 'll take it , when she hears that he has gone to America . "
202181	202193	202194	202194	Gilbert	178	" Yes , that is a bad business , Mrs. Whitelaw , "
202198	202229	202194	202194	Gilbert	178	" He was not in a fit state to travel , unfortunately . He was only just recovering from a severe illness , and was as weak as a child . "
202230	202248	202070	202070	her	329	" O dear , O dear ! But you wo n't tell Mrs. Holbrook that , sir ? "
202249	202343	202194	202194	Gilbert	178	" I wo n't tell her more than I can help ; of course I do n't want to alarm her ; but I am bound to tell her some portion of the truth . You did her husband a great wrong , you see , Mrs. Whitelaw , when you suspected him of some share in this vile business . He has shown himself really devoted to her . I thank God that it has proved so . And now tell me more about this affair ; your letter explains so little . "
202344	202353	202070	202070	her	329	" I will tell you all , sir . "
202505	202513	202514	202514	she	169	" How good of you to come ! "
202517	202534	202514	202514	she	169	" And you have brought me news of my husband ? I am sure of that . "
202535	202563	202654	202654	His	5016	" Yes , dear Mrs. Holbrook Mrs. Saltram ; may I not call you by that name now ? I know all ; and have forgiven all . "
202564	202608	202514	202514	she	169	" Then you know how deeply he sinned against you , and how much he valued your friendship ? He would never have played so false a part but for that . He could not bear to think of being estranged from you . "
202609	202653	202660	202660	he	5016	" We are not estranged . I have tried to be angry with him ; but there are some old ties that a man can not break . He has used me very ill , Marian ; but he is still my friend . "
202835	202841	202842	202842	Marian	169	" Thank God for that , "
202846	202877	202842	202842	Marian	169	" thank God that you are still friends . But why did he not come with you to - day ? You have told him about me , I suppose ? "
202878	202912	202915	202915	he	5016	" Not yet , Marian ; I have not been able to do that . Nor could he come with me to - day . He has left England on a false scent . "
202950	202970	202971	202971	Gilbert	178	" He will come back at once , of course , when he finds how he has been deceived , "
203011	203021	203022	203022	she	169	" He will be back soon , you say , "
203025	203044	203022	203022	she	169	" but soon is such a vague word ; and you have not told me when he went . "
203142	203151	203152	203152	he	178	" My dear Mrs. Saltram , be reasonable , "
203156	203224	203152	203152	he	178	" Finding such a cheat put upon him , your husband would naturally be anxious to bring your father to some kind of reckoning , to extort from him the real secret of your fate . He would no doubt stay in New York to do this ; and we can not tell how difficult the business might prove , or how long it would occupy him . "
203225	203243	203245	203245	Marian	169	" But if he had been detained like that , he would surely have written to you , "
203247	203260	203245	203245	Marian	169	" and you have heard nothing from him since he left England . "
203261	203279	203152	203152	he	178	" Unhappily nothing . But he is not the best correspondent in the world , you know . "
203280	203309	203310	203310	Her	169	" Yes , yes , I know that . Yet , in such a case as this , he would surely have written , if he were well . "
203331	203340	203341	203341	she	169	" You are hiding some misfortune from me , "
203344	203361	203341	203341	she	169	" I can see it in your face . You have had bad news of him . "
203362	203395	203430	203430	she	169	" Upon my honour , no . He was not in very strong health when he left England , that is all ; and , like yourself , I am naturally anxious . "
203532	203546	203547	203547	she	169	" Your friendship for us has given you nothing but trouble and pain , "
203550	203573	203547	203547	she	169	" but if you will do this for me , I shall be grateful to you for the rest of my life . "
203681	203686	203687	203687	he	178	" My dear Gilbert , "
203690	203962	203687	203687	he	178	" I have been duped . This man Nowell is a most consummate scoundrel . The woman with him is not Marian , but some girl whom he has picked up to represent her his wife perhaps , or something worse . I was very ill on the passage out , and only discovered the trick at the last . Since then I have traced the scoundrel to his quarters , and have had an interview with him rather a stormy one , as you may suppose . But the long and short of it is that he defies me . He tells me that my wife is in England , and safe , but will admit no more . I have consulted a lawyer here , but it seems I can do nothing against him or nothing that will not involve a more complicated and protracted business than I have time or patience for . I do n't want this wretch to go scot - free . It is evident that he has hatched this plot in order to get possession of his daughter 's money , and I have little doubt the lawyer Medler is in it . But of course my first duty , as well as my most ardent desire , is to find Marian ; and for this purpose I shall come back to England by the first steamer that will convey me , leaving Mr. Nowell 's punishment to the chances of the future . My dear girl 's property , as well as herself , will be best protected by my presence in England . "
203979	204061	204070	204071	the writer	752	" If I have strength to come , I shall return by the next steamer ; but the fact is , my dear Gilbert , I am very ill have been completely prostrate since writing the above and a doctor here tells me I must not think of the voyage yet awhile . But I sha n't allow his opinion to govern me . If I can crawl to the steamer , which starts three days hence , I shall come . "
204088	204295	204070	204071	the writer	752	" My dear Gil , it 's nearly a week since I wrote the last lines , and I 've been in bed ever since . I 'm afraid there 's no hope for me ; in plain words , I believe I 'm dying . To you I leave the duty I am not allowed to perform . Marian is living , and in England . I believe that scoundrelly father of hers told me the truth when he declared that . You will not rest till you find her , I know ; and you will protect her fortune from that wretch . God bless you , faithful old friend ! Heaven knows how I yearn for the sight of your honest face , lying here among strangers , to be buried in a foreign land . See that my wife pays Mrs. Branston the money I borrowed to come here ; and tell her that I was grateful to her , and thought of her on my dying bed . To my wife I send no message . She knows that I loved her ; but how dear she has been to me in this bitter time of separation , she can never know .
204296	204375	204070	204071	the writer	752	" You will find a bulky MS . at my chambers , in the bottom drawer on the right side of my desk . It is my Life of Swift unfinished as my own life . If , after reading it , you should think it worth publishing , as a fragment , with my name to it , I should wish you to arrange its publication . I should be glad to leave my name upon something . "
204399	204533	204070	204071	the writer	752	" Sir , I regret to inform you that your friend Mr. Saltram expired at eleven o'clock last night Wednesday , May 2nd , after an illness of a fortnight 's duration , throughout which I gave him my best attention as his medical adviser . He will be buried in the Cypress - hill Cemetery , on Long Island , at his own request ; and he has left sufficient funds for the necessary expenses , and the payment of his hotel bill , as well as my own small claim against him . Any surplus which may be left I shall forward to you , when these payments have been made . I enclose a detailed account of the case for your satisfaction , and have the honour to be , sir ,
