1216	1241	1242	1242	She	269	" Dear Mr Hamlin , I must kiss the hands that have opened the paradise of body and soul to so many of us . "
1309	1313	1314	1314	Perry	94	" You see , "
1318	1354	1314	1314	Perry	94	" I must paint things well not the sort of things I exactly admire , because , you see , there s Mrs Perry and the children five girls , and last year s baby . "
1881	1905	1841	1841	Perry	94	" I am gone to sketch at the Lake of Massaciuccoli ; shan t be back till lunch ; please look after Hamlin . "
1906	1910	1912	1912	Hamlin	93	" Confound it ! "
1914	1929	1912	1912	Hamlin	93	" am I to be left in t?te???t?te with Mrs Perry all the morning ? "
2122	2129	2131	2131	Hamlin	93	" This looks more like it , "
2457	2463	2465	2465	Hamlin	93	" I beg your pardon , "
2545	2551	2553	2553	Hamlin	93	" I beg your pardon , "
2556	2569	2553	2553	Hamlin	93	" but can you tell me how I may get some breakfast ? "
2593	2599	2601	2602	the children	1713	" It s Mr Hamlin , "
2650	2662	2663	2663	She	330	" I don t know anything about your breakfast , sir . "
2682	2720	2663	2663	She	330	" Mr Perry went to sketch at Massaciuccoli early this morning , and took the boy with him ; Mrs Perry may never be disturbed till nine ; and the cook is gone to Lucca for provisions . "
2721	2727	2729	2729	Hamlin	93	" That s very sad , "
2762	2773	2774	2774	she	330	" I suppose the cook has orders about your breakfast , "
2799	2820	2791	2791	she	330	" Mrs Perry did not think you would want anything so early ; the cook will be back about nine . "
2857	2862	2863	2863	he	93	" Nine o clock ! "
2866	2894	2863	2863	he	93	" that s a long time to wait . Couldn t you give me something to eat ? I saw a table spread in the next room . "
2910	2920	2921	2921	she	327	" It s the children s breakfast , sir , "
2924	2932	2921	2921	she	327	" we have neither tea nor coffee . "
2933	2938	2940	2945	the eldest of the little girls	333	" We have milk , "
2948	2952	2940	2945	the eldest of the little girls	333	" and figs . "
2953	2958	2960	2960	Hamlin	93	" Milk and figs ! "
2962	2978	2979	2979	he	93	" why , that s a breakfast for the gods ! and won t you , "
2984	2996	2979	2979	he	93	" won t you share a little of it with me ? "
2997	3005	3007	3008	the girl	327	" You are Mrs Perry s guest , "
3014	3026	3007	3008	the girl	327	" and of course you are welcome to anything you choose . "
3033	3036	3037	3037	he	93	" Indeed ! "
3040	3060	3037	3037	he	93	" I don t wish to do anything against the habits of the house , or disagreeable to you . "
3061	3069	3070	3070	she	327	" It is not against any rules , "
3073	3097	3070	3070	she	327	" If you will excuse me , I will see whether the milk is heated . The children will show you the way . "
3250	3255	3257	3259	the eldest child	343	" And you know , "
3274	3387	3257	3259	the eldest child	343	" mamma told us you were the great poet , and she read us a poem of yours about Sir Troilus . Mamma always reads poetry to us and we liked it so much , and I liked all about where he kisses the lady so much , and her purple dress with the golden roses , and then about Love , where he comes and takes her by the throat , and chokes her , and makes her feel like a furnace . Mamma says it s just like love . Mr Thaddeus Smith was in love with the gardener s girl when he came here last year , mamma says . "
3388	3392	3394	3394	Hamlin	93	" Good heavens ! "
3396	3404	3394	3394	Hamlin	93	" what a mamma and what children ! "
3405	3421	3424	3426	a smaller one	345	" And mamma told us to get some myrtles and put them in your room , "
3428	3440	3442	3443	the eldest	346	" Hush , Winnie ! You know you shouldn t tell , "
3445	3450	3452	3453	the younger	347	" And you know , "
3462	3497	3452	3453	the younger	347	" mamma said we should put the myrtles , because you made poems about myrtles ; and we were to have had on our best frocks , and met you in the hall , and "
3498	3503	3456	3456	her	347	" Hush , Winnie ! "
3504	3536	3452	3453	the younger	347	" And thrown roses on the floor before you ; only then papa got a telegram saying you were coming by the late train , and we had to go to bed "
3616	3625	3627	3627	Hamlin	93	" May I cut the bread for you ? "
3636	3646	3598	3598	She	104	" I don t think you will know how to do
3649	3653	3598	3598	She	104	" she answered . "
3671	3686	3665	3666	the cook	1719	" When the milk was helped and the bread cut , she said , rather sharply
3687	3696	3697	3698	The children	1713	" Now , children , say your prayer . "
3787	3795	3797	3797	Winnie	104	" That s mamma s Tuesday hymn , "
3799	3812	3797	3797	Winnie	104	" she makes a different one for each day of the week . "
4501	4524	4498	4498	he	93	" How is it that you speak English so marvellously well ? No one would ever guess that you were not English . "
4525	4530	4532	4533	the girl	327	" I am English , "
4612	4619	4620	4620	he	93	" You mean English by adoption , "
4623	4629	4620	4620	he	93	" surely not by blood ? "
4630	4639	4666	4666	Scotch	108	" My mother was an Italian . I think her
4657	4661	4666	4666	Scotch	108	" she answered ; "
4673	4673	4668	4668	He	384	"
4674	4682	4683	4683	he	93	" Have you ever been in Scotland ? "
4701	4704	4705	4705	she	0	" No , "
4729	4746	4718	4718	she	0	" I was born in Italy ; my father was employed at Spezia in the docks . "
4759	4775	4752	4752	her	109	" Annina s father was one of those who make the big men?of?war at Spezia . "
4776	4803	4805	4807	a smaller one	345	" Oh , you know , we once went with papa , and saw a man?of?war , and all the boilers and big , big cannons , "
4809	4819	4822	4823	the eldest	346	" And he was a bad , bad man , "
4827	4841	4822	4823	the eldest	346	" He used to drink quantities of acquavite ; and one day when he had
4874	4874	4869	4869	himself	389	"
4973	4979	4981	4981	Winnie	104	" And is it true , "
4983	5038	4981	4981	Winnie	104	" that you are going to do our picture ? Mamma said you would want to paint us angels or fairies . All the painters paint us , because , mamma says , we are the most beautiful children in Florence . They always give us chocolate and marrons glacés to keep us quiet . "
5134	5138	5139	5139	he	93	" Thank you , "
5142	5151	5139	5139	he	93	" gardens aren t much in my line . "
5170	5177	5178	5178	he	93	" Yes , by the way , "
5181	5197	5178	5178	he	93	" I do take an interest in gardens sometimes . Come and show me yours . "
5312	5318	5320	5320	Winnie	104	" This is my garden ! "
5334	5348	5320	5320	Winnie	104	" I have marigolds , and sunflowers , and red beans and potatoes . "
5349	5355	5357	5357	Mildred	111	" And this is mine , "
5365	5382	5357	5357	Mildred	111	" I call it the garden of Acrasia ; because mamma told us once about Sir Guyon "
5383	5392	5320	5320	Winnie	104	" Won t you give us anything to buy seeds
5400	5403	5395	5395	we	411	" clamoured Winnie .
5404	5416	5418	5418	Mildred	111	" Hush , Winnie ! I wonder you re not ashamed ! "
5420	5429	5431	5431	Hamlin	93	" They are very good sort of gardens , "
5451	5463	5465	5465	he	93	" here I hope your tomatoes may prosper and prove eatable . "
5471	5475	5476	5476	he	93	" Come here , "
5479	5487	5476	5476	he	93	" I want to speak to you ; "
5538	5542	5544	5544	Hamlin	93	" Look here , "
5548	5598	5544	5544	Hamlin	93	" I want to know how you would feel if your papa had been in the habit of drinking too much acquavite , and had shot himself after trying to murder your mamma , and some nasty little girl blurted it all out at breakfast to a perfect stranger ? "
5665	5683	5651	5651	She	416	" My papa is a gentleman , and Annina s papa was a common man a mascalzone , "
5692	5699	5701	5701	Hamlin	93	" Your papa is a gentleman , "
5705	5754	5701	5701	Hamlin	93	" I have known him long before you were born . But remember , if you say cruel things which hurt people s feelings , whether they be gentle people or servants , however much your papa may be a gentleman , you won t be a lady . "
6021	6046	6175	6177	the other voice	434	" Annina , how dare you distress the signorina Mildred ? How dare you say cruel things to my poor , poor sensitive child ? "
6047	6058	6175	6177	the other voice	434	" I have said nothing cruel to the signorina Mildred , "
6066	6108	6175	6177	the other voice	434	" the signorina Mildred went to show her garden to Mr Hamlin , and then came back crying . I asked her what had happened , but she refused to tell me . I have nothing to do with her tears . "
6109	6118	6120	6121	Mrs Perry	94	" How dare you tell such an untruth ? "
6123	6161	6120	6121	Mrs Perry	94	" The signorina Mildred said something about your father at breakfast , and you , like a little viper , turned round upon the poor little darling . She is nearly in hysterics ! You little serpent ! "
6162	6173	6175	6177	the other voice	434	" It is one of Miss Mildred s usual lies , "
6179	6185	6175	6177	the other voice	434	" una delle solite bugφe . "
6361	6365	6366	6366	he	93	" You see , "
6369	6389	6366	6366	he	93	" Mrs Perry is very delicate in short , scarcely fit for any kind of household bother , so that "
6390	6393	6395	6395	Hamlin	93	" Oh , "
6397	6407	6395	6395	Hamlin	93	" I had a capital breakfast with your children . "
6449	6453	6455	6455	Perry	94	" Of course , "
6465	6539	6541	6541	he	445	" of course I m very happy , and that sort of thing . My wife well , she s a little impetuous , and I don t always agree about her way of bringing up the children but there s no saying that she isn t an immensely superior kind of woman . I don t always agree with her , mind you ; but she has the true poetic temperament , and "
6546	6603	6541	6541	he	445	" she keeps me up to the mark with my work . I was always a lazy hound , you know , and all that . In short , I know I m quite a singularly fortunate man . Nevertheless , well , I tell you my frank opinion about matrimony : never do it ; the odds
6650	6650	6639	6639	you	448	"
6651	6662	6664	6664	Hamlin	93	" I don t think there is the faintest chance , "
6666	6699	6664	6664	Hamlin	93	" Women have got to bore me long ago : all that in my poems is mere recollections of the past descriptions of a myself which has long come to an end . "
6700	6707	6709	6709	Perry	94	" I m glad of it , "
6711	6724	6709	6709	Perry	94	" It is a foolish thing to get tied to a woman . "
6725	6729	6731	6731	Hamlin	93	" Foolish indeed ! "
6821	6834	6835	6835	he	93	" That is a very strange?looking girl you have in your service , "
6848	6852	6854	6855	Mrs Perry	94	" The cook ? "
6857	6874	6854	6855	Mrs Perry	94	" Isn t she a divine creature ? I call her Monna Lisa s younger sister . "
6875	6885	6886	6886	he	93	" I don t know your cook by sight , "
6889	6899	6886	6886	he	93	" I mean the other young woman they call Annina "
6906	6927	6900	6901	Mrs Perry	94	" The nurse or governess , I don t know exactly how to describe her , of your little girls . "
6928	6934	6936	6937	Mrs Perry	94	" My children s maid , "
6943	6968	6936	6937	Mrs Perry	94	" Thank heaven , my children have never had and shall never have any other nurse or any other governess than their own mother . "
6969	6976	6900	6901	Mrs Perry	94	" Well , now , Julia , "
6981	6997	6900	6901	Mrs Perry	94	" I think , you know , that s pushing it a little too far . "
6998	7009	7011	7012	Mrs Perry	94	" My children shall never learn anything from a menial , "
7014	7033	7011	7012	Mrs Perry	94	" neither to walk bodily , nor morally , nor intellectually , as long as I am alive . "
7034	7038	7040	7040	Hamlin	93	" Good heavens ! "
7042	7054	7040	7040	Hamlin	93	" what a bandy?legged family they are likely to turn out ! "
7055	7062	7064	7064	Perry	94	" I suppose you mean Annie , "
7066	7080	7064	7064	Perry	94	" Yes , she s a good girl , and a good?looking girl . "
7081	7088	7090	7091	Mrs Perry	94	" You are mad , Melton , "
7093	7103	7090	7091	Mrs Perry	94	" with your idea of goodness and good looks ! "
7104	7111	7114	7114	Hamlin	93	" I think her extraordinarily good?looking , "
7124	7131	7133	7133	Perry	94	" I always told you so , "
7135	7141	7143	7143	Hamlin	93	" When I say good?looking , "
7145	7185	7143	7143	Hamlin	93	" I don t mean it at all in the ordinary sense . There are dozens of Italian girls five times as pretty as that girl , and I daresay most people don t think her at all attractive . "
7186	7189	7192	7193	Mrs Perry	94	" Yes , "
7195	7212	7192	7193	Mrs Perry	94	" vulgar minds and eyes never appreciate the higher beauty . They see only the body . "
7213	7223	7226	7226	Hamlin	93	" This is exactly a question of the body , "
7228	7260	7226	7226	Hamlin	93	" That girl is one of the most singular types I have ever come across . She is like some of Michaelangelo s women , but even stranger a superb creature . "
7282	7289	7290	7290	she	94	" All our servants are handsome , "
7293	7312	7290	7290	she	94	" the cook s the finest Leonardo da Vinci type when you see her you will want to do her
7322	7355	7319	7320	Venus Mystica	116	" and Mrs Melton Perry set her meagre features and wide?opening mouth into a mystic smile , intimating that she knew a great deal about Venus Mystica , and her guest doubtless likewise .
7356	7360	7364	7364	she	94	" And the footman "
7368	7371	7364	7364	she	94	" Errand?boy , "
7385	7444	7373	7374	Mr Perry	99	" The footman is quite a type of manly beauty a young Hercules , such a neck and shoulders and arms and a head like a cameo . I always make it a rule to engage only handsome servants , because it spiritualises the minds of our children to be brought up constantly surrounded by beautiful human forms . "
7445	7449	7451	7451	Hamlin	93	" I see , "
7492	7503	7505	7505	Perry	99	" That girl you noticed has rather a curious history , "
7507	7510	7451	7451	Hamlin	93	" Indeed ! "
7512	7532	7567	7567	his	93	Hamlin;"she looks as if she ought to have some sort of tragic past a kind of Brynhilt or Amazon . "
7533	7551	7553	7553	Perry	99	" It s tragic enough if you like , but it s unfortunately not at all poetical , "
7555	7565	7567	7568	his wife	459	" There is poetry in all suffering , Melton , "
7571	7722	7725	7726	drel scoundrel	119	" Well , this girl is the daughter of a Scotch mechanic , a very clever fellow , I believe , who fell in love with the Italian maid of some old friends of ours , and followed her to Italy . He got a very good position in the docks at Spezia , but then the other chaps caballed against him , and made him lose his place . They had to live from hand to mouth for a long while , doing odd jobs for the railway company ; he squandered his money also on inventions , so , little by little , he and his wife and children got into great distress . Then he took to drinking , poor devil ! I m sure I should have done so long before ; and one day that he had again been done out of a place by some Italian
7750	7750	7728	7728	he	460	"
7751	7761	7763	7764	Mrs Perry	94	" He was a great republican , poor dear , "
7766	7783	7763	7764	Mrs Perry	94	" I m a republican too , a socialist quite a dreadful creature , Mr Hamlin . "
7784	7793	7795	7795	Hamlin	93	" What became of the wife and children ? "
7797	7884	7795	7795	Hamlin	93	" The children had all died by this time , except Annie ; and the poor wife was quite broken in health . There was a nephew of the husband s , a Scotch lad , quite a boy , who was awfully plucky and worked for them for some time . Then the widow died ; and an old friend of ours , old Miss Curzon , the famous singer that had been perhaps you may have heard of her took Annie into her house . "
7885	7890	7892	7893	Mrs Perry	94	" Darling Miss Curzon ! "
7895	7933	7892	7893	Mrs Perry	94	" She was the noblest woman that ever lived . How she loved me ! I always say that I lost my voice I had a lovely voice before my marriage when dear darling Miss Curzon died . "
7934	7943	7946	7946	Perry	94	" Miss Curzon was an excellent old woman , "
7948	7974	7946	7946	Perry	94	" she took Annie when she was eleven , and kept her in her house and educated her till her own death two years ago ; "
7987	8009	8012	8013	Mrs Perry	94	" Then I said to my husband , Perry , this child is a legacy to us from our dearest friend , "
8017	8049	8012	8013	Mrs Perry	94	" we are not rich , but Heaven will send us enough for our children and this child ; and if it don t , why , we must do without . "
8050	8060	8012	8013	Mrs Perry	94	" So she has been with you ever since ? "
8061	8064	8066	8066	Perry	94	" Yes , "
8070	8099	8066	8066	Perry	94	" and I should like her to remain for the children s sake , only that I feel the girl ought to look out for some better place . "
8213	8222	8224	8224	Hamlin	93	" And what is this girl s name ? "
8226	8229	8231	8231	Perry	94	" Anne , "
8232	8236	8231	8231	Perry	94	" Anne Brown . "
8435	8438	8439	8439	he	93	" Nonsense ! "
8441	8456	8413	8413	he	93	" don t say that ; don t leave me in the lurch yet . "
8457	8461	8463	8463	Hamlin	93	" You see , "
8467	8489	8463	8463	Hamlin	93	" I intend going to America ; and I really think I ought to do a little work before leaving Italy . "
8490	8496	8413	8413	he	93	" What sort of work ? "
8497	8524	8413	8413	he	93	" Why , I suppose I think I ought to take this opportunity of working a little at one of my pictures for the next Grosvenor . "
8525	8529	8531	8531	Perry	94	" Which picture ? "
8535	8557	8531	8531	Perry	94	" I really scarcely know . I suppose I ought to be making some studies for Circe and the child Comus . "
8558	8562	8564	8564	Perry	94	" Child Comus ! "
8566	8579	8564	8564	Perry	94	" Why , I ve the very thing you want here at hand .
8615	8615	8531	8531	Perry	94	"
8616	8625	8627	8627	Hamlin	93	" I don t intend doing him naked , "
8636	8679	8627	8627	Hamlin	93	" Naked or not , he s what you want . The head , since you don t care for legs and chest . You shall have him to?morrow ; and you can work much better here than in that swelter at Florence "
8680	8684	8687	8688	poor Perry	94	" In short , "
8690	8776	8687	8688	poor Perry	94	" don t leave me yet , old fellow . You don t know what it is for me to have you here I feel quite another man . It seems to me as if I were ten years younger . The fact is , don t you know , a man s never the same when once married ; it s a weight round his neck . Don t go away yet , dear old Watty , for the sake of auld lang syne . "
8819	8835	8837	8837	Hamlin	93	" Well , I m willing enough to stay , if you ll keep me , "
8839	8844	8846	8846	Perry	94	" That s right ! "
8852	8869	8846	8846	Perry	94	" Keep me from growing into a turnip for a little longer , for goodness sake . "
9790	9800	9806	9806	her	327	" You must first ask permission of Miss Brown . "
10138	10152	10153	10153	Hamlin	93	" Won t you sit down and do it here , Miss Brown ? "
10436	10447	10448	10448	he	93	" I may want her for a picture some day , "
10462	10465	10466	10466	she	94	" Oh ! "
10469	10566	10466	10466	she	94	" paint a picture of her as the Witch of Atlas , with a red cloak and red roses all about her , and a background of cactuses and aloes all twisting and writhing , and looking as if they gibbered . Do paint her like that , dear Mr Hamlin and Mildred and Winnie will do for attendant spirits . Begin to?morrow you shall have her to sit to you all day ; and she has such lovely arms and shoulders , you must paint her in some kind of dress that will show them . "
10567	10586	10589	10590	Melton Perry	94	" I think it s rather cool of you to promise Annie as a sitter in that way , "
10591	10601	10466	10466	she	94	" especially with so few clothes on , Julia . "
10602	10606	10608	10609	Mrs Perry	94	" Why not ? "
10614	10631	10608	10609	Mrs Perry	94	" If she is beautiful she must be painted . She shall begin sitting to?morrow morning . "
10632	10642	10644	10644	Perry	94	" She shan t do anything of the kind ! "
10648	10683	10644	10644	Perry	94	" I don t see at all what right we have to dispose of her . We pay her wages as a servant for our children , not as a model for our visitors . "
10684	10699	10701	10701	Hamlin	93	" I never dreamed of Miss Brown being in any way compelled to sit , "
10706	10718	10701	10701	Hamlin	93	" I only wanted your assistance in asking whether she would . "
10719	10725	10727	10728	Mrs Perry	94	" Of course she will , "
10730	10775	10727	10728	Mrs Perry	94	" Why , I wonder what great hardship there is in sitting for one s likeness ? Haven t I done it hundreds of times ? When a woman is beautiful , it s her duty ; that s what I was always told . "
10776	10788	10644	10644	Perry	94	" It may be the duty of a lady , Julia , "
10798	10821	10793	10794	Mr Perry	99	" and it may be yours ; but it isn t the duty of a servant girl the difference lies in that . "
10822	10825	10827	10828	Mrs Perry	94	" Well , "
10832	10873	10827	10828	Mrs Perry	94	" I think you don t show much appreciation of the honour of having one of the greatest of living painters in our house , Perry . I do , and I shall see to his having the proper model . "
10874	10885	10887	10887	Hamlin	93	" Please , I entreat you , dear Mrs Perry , "
10889	10922	10887	10887	Hamlin	93	" do let the matter go it really is of no consequence ; and , indeed , it would be in the last degree distasteful to me to have an unwilling sitter . "
10923	10934	10936	10937	Mrs Perry	94	" You shall have a willing one , Mr Hamlin ; "
10957	10960	10961	10961	he	545	" Julia , "
10964	10982	10961	10961	he	545	" do leave it to me I ll speak to Annie only do leave it to me . "
10983	10991	10992	10992	she	459	" I see no reason for this , "
10995	11005	11007	11007	Perry	94	" Then I shall speak to Annie at once , "
11009	11027	11028	11028	he	545	" There s been far too much of this turning of servants into models in this house , "
11035	11117	11028	11028	he	545	" Mrs Perry can t be got to see that it isn t at all the right sort of thing . I don t mind so much with the others , for I suppose they re a parcel of sluts ; but Annie is another matter . I don t mind it s being you , you know , old fellow ; but I object to the principle . Annie ! Annie ! I want to speak to you a moment , "
11132	11141	11142	11142	he	99	" I ve spoken to her , Hamlin , "
11145	11253	11142	11142	he	99	" I told her that she was just what you wanted for the Lady Guenevere or the Lady of the Lake , or some lady or other all a lie ; but you see I didn t wish her to know it was merely because she s handsome . I told her she was like a portrait of one of these persons . Please don t tell her she s not . I really expected she d refuse ; and I said to her , Annie , mind you don t let the mistress force you into sitting ; don t do it to please anybody . I m
11345	11345	11337	11337	I	0	"
11346	11350	11352	11352	Hamlin	93	" Thank you , "
11362	11372	11355	11355	his	93	" you re a good old creature , Perry . "
11482	11488	11489	11489	he	93	" I have bungled everything , "
11496	11503	11489	11489	he	93	" and kept you here for nothing ,
11523	11523	11489	11489	he	93	"
11546	11550	11552	11552	Perry	99	" Try again , "
11554	11569	11552	11552	Perry	99	" I daresay Annie will sit for you again won t you , Annie ? "
11570	11581	11583	11584	the girl	327	" If Mr Hamlin wishes me to sit , certainly , "
11587	11595	11597	11597	Hamlin	93	" She is confoundedly difficult to draw , "
11606	11618	11620	11620	Perry	99	" She s difficult because she s a kind of mystery , "
11622	11709	11620	11620	Perry	99	" I ve felt it ever since we have had her . One thinks there must be something behind that face , and yet it seems to be a mere blank . My belief is , that people of this condition of life often have very little character at least none in particular developed . Because , after all , it s talking and jawing about things which don t matter a pin that develops our character . The people who have no opportunity for that remain quite
11731	11731	11800	11801	his model	556	"
11732	11739	11741	11741	Hamlin	93	" There s something in that , "
11752	11790	11741	11741	Hamlin	93	" but it is hard that a man should be unable to copy the shape of a handsome face as he would copy the shape of a handsome vase , without wondering what there may be inside . "
12080	12084	12085	12085	He	93	" Anne Brown . "
12137	12149	12150	12150	he	93	" I find we have a common friend , Miss Brown , "
12164	12169	12170	12170	she	327	" A common friend ? "
12186	12202	12170	12170	she	327	" I suppose you mean Mr Perry ; I haven t many friends now anywhere . "
12203	12231	12179	12179	her	327	" Oh ! this is the friend of a great many people thousands besides ourselves , so you need not feel jealous ; his name is Dante . "
12232	12235	12237	12238	Anne Brown	91	" Indeed ! "
12252	12267	12268	12268	he	93	" I found two books belonging to you in the vineyard early this morning , "
12271	12281	12268	12268	he	93	" and I put them on the nursery window?sill . "
12282	12286	12288	12289	Miss Brown	91	" Thank you , "
12296	12303	12292	12292	her	91	" I missed them last night . "
12304	12311	12292	12292	her	91	" I was indiscreet enough to wonder whether
12323	12327	12314	12314	I	0	" pursued Hamlin ; "
12346	12346	12338	12338	you	91	"
12347	12350	12352	12353	Miss Brown	91	" Yes , "
12355	12373	12352	12353	Miss Brown	91	" How is it that you marked Provenzano , and did not mark Ugolino , I wonder ? "
12374	12387	12338	12338	you	91	" I don t care about Ugolino . He was a traitor . "
12388	12401	12403	12403	Hamlin	93	" Do you consider that traitors ought to be starved to death ? "
12409	12423	12424	12424	she	91	" I don t think any one ought to be starved to death , "
12429	12468	12424	12424	she	91	" it is too dreadful . But I don t care about Ugolino , because he was a traitor ; and the Archbishop was a traitor too . There is no one to be glad or sorry about . "
12469	12491	12338	12338	you	91	" And Francesca da Rimini ? Do you find there is nothing to care for or be sorry about in her ? "
12508	12515	12516	12516	she	91	" The husband was quite right , "
12523	12529	12531	12531	Hamlin	93	" You are very severe , "
12532	12545	12338	12338	you	91	" much more severe than Dante . He was sorry for them . "
12546	12552	12553	12553	she	91	" They were quite happy , "
12556	12577	12579	12579	she	91	" They did not mind being killed ; they did not mind being driven about in the wind , of course "
12584	12589	12579	12579	she	91	" Why of course ? "
12599	12662	12665	12665	she	91	" Because I don t think one would mind , if people cared for one , being driven about in the wind like that . Lots of people have been driven about in revolutions , and put into dungeons together , and so on . If they had put papa in prison , I should have wanted to go in with him , "
12785	12792	12794	12794	Hamlin	93	" That is what I want ! "
12796	12805	12794	12794	Hamlin	93	" the Amazon or Valkyr as I thought . "
12806	12815	12816	12816	he	93	" Tell me why you care for Provenzano , "
12829	12845	12846	12846	she	91	" Because he was so proud , and did not like to do humble things , "
12849	12864	12846	12846	she	91	" and yet he begged in the streets for a ransom for his friend . "
12938	12948	12949	12949	she	91	" If Mrs Perry wishes it , of course , "
12952	12956	12958	12958	Hamlin	93	" Excuse me , "
12960	12985	12958	12958	Hamlin	93	" Mrs Perry s consent may be necessary for you ; but for me , the sitting depends upon your wishes , Miss Brown . "
12986	12996	12997	12997	she	91	" I don t care one way or another , "
13034	13045	13047	13048	Mrs Perry	94	" Do let me keep them , dear Mr Hamlin , "
13050	13060	13047	13048	Mrs Perry	94	" they are the most precious things I possess . "
13061	13067	13069	13069	Hamlin	93	" They are horrible rubbish ; "
13076	13102	13069	13069	Hamlin	93	" If you want something of mine , I will make you a sketch of little Winnie only please don t keep these fearful things . "
13103	13112	13113	13113	she	94	" Thank you , thank you so much ! "
13115	13132	13069	13069	Hamlin	93	" but oh , mayn t I keep this ? it is such a lovely head ! "
13133	13142	13143	13143	he	93	" It s the head of Miss Brown , "
13147	13182	13184	13184	he	93	" You don t care for it much on her shoulders , why should you care for it on my paper an abominable caricature ? Really , I must be permitted to tear it up "
13280	13290	13291	13291	he	93	" What do you want with an Italian grammer ? "
13294	13308	13291	13291	he	93	" You surely don t require to study it yourself , Miss Brown ? "
13309	13317	13318	13318	she	91	" I want to teach some day , "
13321	13331	13291	13291	he	93	" Do you mean to teach the Perry children ? "
13332	13399	13291	13291	he	93	" Oh no to teach , to be a daily governess , what we call a parlatrice here . It is not difficult . The lessons are all conversation . Many English ladies want those sort of lessons . I know a girl , the daughter of Mrs Perry s dressmaker , who gives ten lessons every day , and and gets two francs a lesson . "
13400	13423	13291	13291	he	93	" Ten lessons a?day ! But that s fearful . What awful slavery ! Surely you don t want to do that ? "
13424	13436	13291	13291	he	93	" I wish I could . I should be so happy . "
13437	13446	13291	13291	he	93	" Then you want to leave the Perrys ? "
13447	13457	13458	13458	Hamlin	93	" I want to give up being a servant . "
13478	13486	13487	13487	he	93	" You don t care for children ? "
13492	13506	13507	13507	she	570	" I don t know . I don t care for these children , "
13511	13519	13507	13507	she	570	" I thought women always liked children . "
13524	13527	13528	13528	she	570	" Oh , "
13531	13563	13528	13528	she	570	" children are worse sometimes than grown people ; and then one can t resent it , or answer bad words , or strike them , just because they are children . "
13564	13577	13651	13651	Hamlin	93	" Then you think you would prefer being a teacher of Italian ? "
13578	13612	13651	13651	Hamlin	93	" Oh yes , I must become that some day ; I study when I have a little time . A teacher talks with ladies , and talks about all sorts of things . "
13613	13624	13651	13651	Hamlin	93	" How do you mean about all sorts of things ? "
13625	13650	13651	13651	Hamlin	93	" About things which are not things to eat , or mend , or clean , about books , and places , and people . "
13657	13665	13666	13666	he	93	" Is that such a rare pleasure ? "
13696	13712	13714	13715	the girl	327	" Miss Curzon used to talk about books to me and about music , sometimes , "
13717	13733	13714	13715	the girl	327	" She made me read Shakespeare with her . That is long , long ago . "
13734	13747	13756	13757	Anne Brown	91	" And since then . Do you never talk about such things ? "
13748	13751	13714	13715	the girl	327	" Never . "
13752	13755	13714	13715	the girl	327	" Never ? "
13763	13772	13759	13759	her	91	" Never , except with you , sir . "
13790	13802	13803	13803	he	93	" Have you ever read the Vita Nuova , Miss Brown ? "
13806	13813	13803	13803	he	93	" What s the Vita Nuova ? "
13814	13850	13851	13851	She	327	" It is a little book by Dante , in prose and verse , telling how he met Beatrice , and then how she died . It is much more beautiful than the Divina Commedia . "
13855	13896	13851	13851	She	327	" Is it more beautiful than Bertran del Bornio , where he carried his head like a lantern ? Or Bocca degli Abati , where they all change into snakes ? Or Cacciaguida when he prophesies about Dante s exile ? "
13897	13910	13803	13803	he	93	" It is quite different all about beautiful things , and love . "
13911	13919	13851	13851	She	327	" I don t care for that . "
13920	13930	13931	13932	Miss Brown	91	" You must read it some day , though . "
13944	13953	13955	13955	Perry	94	" I say , Hamlin , old fellow , "
13969	14021	13955	13955	Perry	94	" do you care to see the festival at Lucca to?morrow ? I m going to take the children in for a treat , and I shall take Annie too for she never gets any amusement , poor girl . I ve hired a waggonette will you be of the party ? "
14022	14042	13851	13851	She	327	" Will you let me think about it , Perry ? I don t much go in for festivals . "
14043	14053	13955	13955	Perry	94	" This is a picturesque affair really worth seeing . "
14054	14059	14061	14061	Hamlin	93	" By the way , "
14063	14089	14061	14061	Hamlin	93	" I have nearly finished my sketch of Miss Brown , and I should like I suppose I ought to make her some little present . "
14090	14095	14097	14098	Melton Perry	94	" I wouldn t , "
14101	14133	14097	14098	Melton Perry	94	" she s an odd girl , and you might just hurt her feelings . You see her father was a republican , and that sort of thing , so she s got
14165	14165	14152	14152	I	0	"
14166	14174	14176	14176	Hamlin	93	" I didn t mean any money , "
14187	14219	14220	14220	Hamlin	93	" Then , if you will run the risk , give her some school?books . You know she wants to set up as a teacher . Grammars that sort of thing . "
14227	14235	14220	14220	Hamlin	93	" Horrible ! to give her grammars ! "
14236	14243	14220	14220	Hamlin	93	" It s what she wants . "
14244	14263	14220	14220	Hamlin	93	" Why , it would seem well it would be like encouraging her to become a daily governess . "
14264	14274	14275	14275	Hamlin	93	" That s just what I wish to do . "
14897	14900	14875	14881	the crowd of vehicles of all sorts	600	" Libertas , "
16078	16085	16087	16087	Perry	94	" What ! here after all ! "
16089	16099	16087	16087	Perry	94	" Up to some mischief , you cunning dog ! "
16100	16113	16115	16115	Hamlin	93	" Up to the mischief of watching these good people s devotion , "
16117	16123	16125	16126	the children	1713	" Why did you come ? "
16129	16144	16146	16146	Hamlin	93	" I suppose because I thought I should like to amuse myself after all , "
16283	16288	16290	16292	the little ones	668	" Buy us something , "
16318	16327	16329	16329	Hamlin	93	" You look very happy , Miss Brown , "
16388	16395	16396	16396	she	327	" It is all so beautiful , "
16436	16448	16449	16449	She	327	" Not more beautiful than at the Villa Arnolfini , surely ? "
16452	16467	16449	16449	She	327	" No , not more beautiful ; but more I don t know what . "
16468	16472	16475	16475	her	327	" More cheerful ? "
16478	16483	16473	16473	She	327	" Yes ; but not so
16499	16499	16475	16475	her	327	"
16510	16513	16515	16515	Perry	94	" Come , "
16530	16581	16583	16583	he	93	" you must choose a fairing , Annie . What will you have ? a doll ? a beautiful yellow kerchief with purple flowers , warranted the very worst colours in creation ? some gingerbread ? a penny whistle ? No , I m sure you re dying for some literature "
16622	16625	16626	16626	he	93	" Oh ! "

16975	16999	17019	17019	She	91	" Because it is dreadful don t you think ? to see all those people kneeling down and believing in all that nonsense . "

24859	24881	24882	24882	he	926	" it s sad trash , but you may read it . All poetry isn t fit for women to read , "
24901	24910	24911	24911	he	926	" What made him give you that book ? "
24914	24930	24911	24911	he	926	" I don t know , sir . We were talking about the Vita Nuova . "

24984	25038	24977	24978	Suddenly Perry	94	" I m sorry to inconvenience Hamlin , but this will be the last of the sittings . I am going to send you to the sea?side with the children in a day or two . Little May needs change of air . When you return , Mr Hamlin will be leaving Florence . "

25124	25173	25113	25114	Mrs Perry	94	" d you think you could finish off that picture with only one more sitting ? I m sure Mrs Perry thinks it is time for the children to go down to the sea?side only , of course , she doesn t like disturbing you in your work . "
25174	25181	25183	25184	Mrs Perry	94	" Go down to the sea?side ! "
25196	25215	25183	25184	Mrs Perry	94	" who talks of going to the seaside ? and what has that to do with his work ? "
25216	25284	25183	25184	Mrs Perry	94	" You forget , my dear , that you said this morning that May requires change of air and , of course , Annie will be required to take the children down to Viareggio . I am extremely sorry for you , old fellow , but I fear you must finish that picture at least so far as Annie is concerned by the beginning of next week . "
25285	25289	25291	25291	Hamlin	93	" I see , "
25326	25334	25337	25338	Mrs Perry	94	" I see nothing of the sort , "
25340	25450	25337	25338	Mrs Perry	94	" I will never , never permit dear Hamlin s masterpiece to be spoilt . I would rather take the children to the sea?side myself oh yes . I would rather they did not go at all . My children are the dearest things I possess , but I have no right selfishly to prefer their welfare to the completion of such a picture . I should never forgive myself . That unfinished picture , that strange , terrible Venus , would haunt me in my dreams , and I should hear the whole world asking me , What have you done with a thing meant for our joy ? "

The children no more require to go to Viareggio than I require to be made Khan of Tartary . What is required is that an honest girl , who was intrusted to us by an old friend , should not get to be talked of as a "

25797	25823	25795	25795	Perry	94	" don t be down upon me . I really am confoundedly sorry to bother you indeed I am ; but you see about this girl "
25824	25828	25830	25830	Hamlin	93	" I understand , "
25834	25843	25830	25830	Hamlin	93	" don t let s talk about it . "
25844	25858	25860	25860	Perry	94	" But please don t be in a rage with me , Watty , "
25864	25902	25860	25860	Perry	94	" really I don t know what to do . You see , it s not as if she were an ordinary girl or an ordinary servant ; then I should say hang it , please yourself ! "
25903	25907	25909	25909	Hamlin	93	" Sweet morals ! "
25911	26104	25860	25860	Perry	94	" But with her it s different ; I m sure you must recognise that yourself . Now I don t mean to say you are in the least to blame , or that the girl cares the least scrap about you ; but still , this sort of thing won t do . I know you re the last man to do a dirty thing indeed you re the only man whom I would have permitted to go on so long . But then , quite without meaning anything , all that sitting , and talking , and discussing poetry and Vita Nuova together without knowing it , it puts ideas into a girl s head , makes her dissatisfied , that sort of thing , and the result is that she goes to the bad . And then , here in Florence especially , a girl s none the better looked at for having sat , if even only to one man . People begin to talk at the villa it was another matter , stories go round , and it becomes difficult for her to get a respectable situation . "
26105	26113	26115	26115	Hamlin	93	" You needn t say any more , "
26132	26142	25860	25860	Perry	94	" You understand , old fellow , I don t mean
26149	26153	25860	25860	Perry	94	" persisted Perry ; "
26199	26199	26194	26194	you	93	"
26200	26205	26207	26207	Hamlin	93	" Not a bit , "
26238	26262	26207	26207	Hamlin	93	" not a bit , my dear Perry . I suppose you have no objection to Miss Brown giving me one more morning ? "
26263	26290	26207	26207	Hamlin	93	" Not the least two , or even three , for the matter of that . I was only anxious not to spin out things indefinitely . "
26291	26301	26303	26303	Hamlin	93	" One more sitting will be more than enough , "
26305	26324	26303	26303	Hamlin	93	" By the way , before I go , I want to do a drawing of little Mildred . "
26535	26541	26543	26546	Hamlin s old housekeeper	946	" It is bad weather , "
26548	26551	26553	26553	Anne	91	" Horrible , "
26597	26614	26615	26615	he	93	" It is very good of you to come in such horrible weather , Miss Brown , "
26618	26633	26635	26635	she	327	" It is the last sitting I thought I ought not to miss it , "
26652	26661	26662	26662	he	93	" Won t you warm yourself a little ? "
26665	26676	26662	26662	he	93	" No , thank you ; I am not cold . "
26684	26694	26695	26695	he	93	" You are going to Viareggio , Miss Brown , "
26698	26706	26695	26695	he	93	" Yes ; I believe I am . "
26707	26728	26730	26730	he	93	" You will enjoy the change of air . The sea you told me you liked the sea one day , "
26741	26746	26747	26747	She	950	" I suppose so . "
26907	26918	26919	26919	he	93	" Take that letter to the post?office at the Uffizi , "
26927	26935	26919	26919	he	93	" and mind you get it registered . "
27023	27042	27021	27021	he	93	" Do you remember my finding your Dante in the vineyard at the Villa Arnolfini , Miss Brown ? "
27043	27046	27047	27047	she	91	" Yes , "
27050	27066	27021	27021	he	93	" And you told me that you wished to fit yourself to be a teacher ? "
27067	27073	27021	27021	he	93	" Yes , I remember . "
27074	27077	27080	27080	Hamlin	93	" Well , "
27082	27131	27080	27080	Hamlin	93	" I have been thinking about that ; and I think it would be a pity I mean I hope you won t think it horribly rude of me to say so I think it would be better if you went to school for a little while yourself . "
27150	27158	27159	27159	she	91	" Of course it would be better , "
27164	27225	27159	27159	she	91	" of course I shall always be very ignorant ; but I have no wish to set up for what I am not . I am not going to teach people anything only to correct their pronunciation and a few mistakes . One does not require to study much for that , and I shall be competent to do it . "
27243	27248	27249	27249	he	93	" You misunderstand me , "
27252	27253	27249	27249	he	93	" and
27279	27287	27159	27159	she	91	" and he drew a chair near hers .
27288	27358	27359	27360	Anne Brown	91	" Please do not think me very bold , and forgive the horrid way in which I am forced to put things , when I tell you , dear Miss Brown , that I am very much interested in you , and , indeed will you forgive a comparative stranger saying so ? that I have never felt so much attracted by any one as I do by you . "
27373	27387	27390	27390	Hamlin	93	" The time has come when our acquaintance must come to an end , "
27394	27457	27390	27390	Hamlin	93	" but I can not let this happen without making an effort to prolong it . I have no brothers or sisters no one , at least , living with me , except distant relations . I have never taken much interest in anybody . But now I want to know would you , instead of our parting company altogether would you let me
27511	27511	27500	27500	you	91	"
27623	27627	27628	27628	he	93	" Miss Brown , "
27634	27676	27628	27628	he	93	" Anne oh , don t be unhappy ! I did not mean to offend you . Don t you understand my meaning ? I wish you to be what you have a right to be . I wish you to be in
27838	27838	27839	27839	Anne	91	"
27913	27922	27923	27923	she	91	" May I have a glass of water ? "
27931	27935	27936	27936	she	91	" never mind , "
27938	27945	27947	27947	she	91	" never mind I must go ; "
27962	27966	27968	27968	Hamlin	93	" Miss Brown , "
27970	27978	27980	27980	he	93	" why don t you answer me ? "
27995	28003	28004	28004	she	91	" Because you do not deserve it , "
28013	28020	28004	28004	she	91	" Let me go , please . "
28021	28029	28031	28031	Hamlin	93	" I can not let you go , "
28039	28117	28031	28031	Hamlin	93	" until you have listened to me . Will you let me provide for your future , send you to school , and then place you in the care of my aunt ? Will you let me act as if I were your guardian for the next three years , and at the end of them you shall have enough to live and marry as befits a lady , and be as free as air , or become my
28132	28132	28031	28031	Hamlin	93	"
28137	28147	28148	28148	she	91	" Don t ask me for an answer now , "
28151	28162	28148	28148	she	91	" I am not sure that you are in earnest . "
28163	28170	28172	28172	Hamlin	93	" I am indeed I am ! "
28174	28211	28172	28172	Hamlin	93	" I have intended asking you this ever since my return to Florence . I returned merely in order to ask you . I am in earnest ; can not you give me a serious answer ? "
28212	28236	28237	28237	He	93	" Not now I can t think about anything ; I must ask ; I don t know what is right to do . "
28957	28972	28973	28973	he	93	" Have you thought over our conversation in the studio yesterday , Miss Brown ? "
28976	28979	28981	28981	Anne	91	" Yes , "
28995	28999	28981	28981	Anne	91	" I have . "
29000	29005	29008	29008	Hamlin	93	" Well , then , "
29010	29033	29008	29008	Hamlin	93	" with regard to the plan which I submitted to you , what is your answer ? Do you consent or not ? "
29040	29044	29045	29045	she	91	" I consent , "
29117	29124	29102	29102	she	91	" this is what I want . "
29125	29129	29130	29130	he	93	" Thank you , "
29188	29194	29196	29196	Perry	94	" That s my vocation , "
29198	29218	29220	29220	he	93	" and not painting damned landscape spinach and soapsud seas . Look ! aren t they jolly old fiends ? "
29238	29241	29243	29243	Hamlin	93	" Capital ! "
29245	29302	29243	29243	Hamlin	93	" But look here ; I came to tell you something . I want the address of Miss Brown s guardian , you told me there was one , because I am going to have Miss Brown educated , with a view , if she do not change her mind , to her becoming my wife . "
29312	29315	29316	29316	he	93	" Damnation ! "
29332	29338	29341	29341	Perry	94	" So that s it ! "
29343	29368	29341	29341	Perry	94	" While I was bothering my brains with trying to take care of Anne , you were being inveigled by that cursed hypocritical slut . "
29369	29385	29387	29387	Hamlin	93	" I shall be obliged to you to speak in rather different language , Perry , "
29406	29406	29341	29341	Perry	94	"
29407	29423	29425	29425	Perry	94	" Oh , beast ! brute ! seven?times?distilled and most?kickable jackass that I have been , "
29427	29466	29425	29425	Perry	94	" that I should have let this happen to you ! that I should have let you be entrapped under my very nose ! But it mustn t be , old fellow ; I won t stand it . "
29467	29473	29475	29475	Hamlin	93	" You will have to , "
29479	29502	29503	29503	Perry	94	" and so , let s say no more about it . Only one word : Miss Brown has not inveigled me . "
29512	29521	29503	29503	Perry	94	" No woman ever does inveigle a man ! "
29522	29603	29425	29425	Perry	94	" Miss Brown has not inveigled me . I conceived the desire of educating her , and giving myself a chance of marrying her if she would have me , long ago , before I returned to Florence . And , as a favour , I beg you will respect Miss Brown so long as she remains in your house , as you would respect the woman who is at present my ward , and may possibly become my wife . "
29604	29611	29613	29613	Perry	94	" Ward ! wife ! fiddlesticks ! "
29615	29721	29613	29613	Perry	94	" For God s sake , my dearest old Watty , don t go and do such a damnable thing ! don t be such an idiot as to suppose you must do it . That was my confounded folly : let myself be led on , and then thought it was my own choice , my resolution , all sorts of fine things . No man ever really wants to tie himself up ; it s the woman who does it , and makes him believe it s himself . All this is bosh , mere bosh ; you ll think better of it . "
29722	29751	29802	29802	Perry	94	" I tell you again , Perry , that there is no inveigling about the matter . I made up my mind to this step while I was away from
29794	29794	29802	29802	Perry	94	"
29795	29800	29802	29802	Perry	94	" Education , forsooth ! "
29804	29842	29802	29802	Perry	94	" you will get yourself married before you have time to say Jack Robinson : and to think that I have brought it all upon you ! to think that I have driven you to do it ! "
29854	29892	29843	29843	Hamlin	93	" Really , you need not feel under any responsibility . I alone am responsible in the business I and good fortune , which has brought me into the presence of the most marvelIous woman that ever was "
29893	29914	29917	29917	Perry	94	" But what do you do it for ? You re not in love with Annie , I do believe , "
29919	29935	29937	29937	Hamlin	93	" I do it because she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen , "
29941	29947	29937	29937	Hamlin	93	" and the woman who , properly
29975	29975	29968	29968	I	0	"
30004	30014	30015	30015	she	94	" What is the matter ? what has happened ? "
30044	30055	30057	30057	Perry	94	" Hamlin wants to bring up and marry Anne Brown , "
30078	30101	30103	30103	Perry	94	" Anne Brown do you hear that ? He wants to marry her ! to educate her ! He has already proposed ! "
30119	30123	30124	30124	she	94	" Dear friend , "
30128	30138	30124	30124	she	94	" my heart told me that this would be . "
30139	30142	30144	30144	Perry	94	" Fudge ! "
30146	30159	30144	30144	Perry	94	" if it did , why the deuce didn t you interfere ? "
30160	30219	30221	30222	Mrs Perry	94	" My heart told me this would be . I congratulate you , dearest friend , that you have at last found the embodiment of your mysterious dreams of beauty . And I thank you , on my part , for giving me the happiness of seeing that glorious dethroned goddess reinstated in her rights , and also , "
30233	30247	30221	30222	Mrs Perry	94	" for giving me the happiness of witnessing a union of mystic perfection ; "
30268	30276	30278	30278	Hamlin	93	" Oh but thank you so much ! "
30279	30312	30278	30278	Hamlin	93	" I have not asked Miss Brown to marry me ; I have only asked her to let me educate her . I wish her to choose whatever husband may deserve her . "
30313	30325	30327	30328	Mrs Perry	94	" And that will be yourself your noble , darling self , "
30330	30341	30343	30343	Hamlin	93	" I am happy that you approve of my decision , "
30347	30350	30343	30343	Hamlin	93	" and since you
30369	30369	30354	30354	you	94	"
30370	30377	30379	30379	Perry	94	" Julia , I forbid you , "
30382	30385	30387	30388	Mrs Perry	94	" His address "
30398	30435	30354	30354	you	94	" is Richard Brown , care of Gillespie Brothers , New Cross . He is foreman at a cannon?foundry , or a place where they make torpedoes . I know it s something murderous and dreadful . "
30436	30446	30448	30448	Hamlin	93	" Richard Brown , Gillespie Brothers , New Cross , "
30453	30467	30450	30450	his	93	" Thank you so much ; I shall write to him at once . "
30468	30477	30479	30479	Perry	94	" Oh , idiotic beast that I was ! "
30481	30492	30479	30479	Perry	94	" to think that it should all be my fault . "
30493	30499	30501	30502	Mrs Perry	94	" Come into my boudoir , "
30504	30540	30501	30502	Mrs Perry	94	" you shall write to him without a moment s delay . Denrest Mr Hamlin , it is so noble , so lovely on your part ; and dear Anne how beautiful she will become ! "
30728	30733	30736	30736	Perry	94	" Proposal disastrous snare , "
30770	30790	30792	30792	Perry	94	" Nothing but pipes loathsome , smelly , filthy pipes ; never a cigar for the next two months , "
30806	30817	30792	30792	Perry	94	" but a fellow must save his friend after all . "
31032	31042	31010	31011	a gentleman	418	" Some confounded painter or poetaster of my acquaintance , "
31090	31097	31077	31077	him	168	" Richard Brown , New Cross . "
31098	31105	31107	31107	Hamlin	168	" Ask him to come in , "
31127	31132	31134	31134	Hamlin	168	" An insolent cad , "
31138	31143	31145	31146	the newcomer	1021	" Mr Walter Hamlin ? "
31164	31179	31181	31181	Hamlin	93	" Precisely and you , I believe , are Miss Anne Brown s cousin ? "
31203	31209	31210	31210	he	93	" Pray , sit down , "
31228	31234	31236	31237	Richard Brown	166	" I have come here , "
31260	31276	31277	31277	Hamlin	93	" in consequence of a telegram which I received from your friend Mr Melton Perry . "
31283	31290	31291	31291	he	166	" Perry telegraphed behind my back , "
31293	31315	31291	31291	he	166	" however , I had written to you the same day . I presume you know the contents of my letter ? "
31316	31332	31334	31335	Richard Brown	166	" I have received no letter from you I suppose I started before it arrived , "
31337	31367	31334	31335	Richard Brown	166	" Mr Perry mentioned no letter from you in his telegram , and as I understood from it that there were plans afoot which concerned my cousin and ward , I
31380	31380	31369	31369	I	0	"
31490	31494	31496	31496	Hamlin	93	" I see , "
31500	31530	31496	31496	Hamlin	93	" I am greatly obliged to you for the trouble you have taken . Your presence here will make it much easier for us to settle all necessary matters . "
31531	31535	31538	31539	the visitor	1019	" Mr Perry , "
31541	31569	31538	31539	the visitor	1019	" has given me rather a confused account of the proposal which I understand you to have made to my cousin ; and I thought it wiser to see
31606	31606	31585	31586	Mr Perry	99	"
31607	31625	31627	31627	Hamlin	93	" Had you waited for my letter , I think you could have had no further doubts , "
31633	31708	31627	31627	Hamlin	93	" To recapitulate , then . I proposed to Miss Brown that she should permit me to take charge of her education for the next two years , and , on her becoming of age and deeming her studies complete , to place at her disposal the capital of an income which should enable her to live in a manner corresponding with the education she had received , and to make a suitable marriage . "
31722	31730	31731	31731	he	93	" I am to understand , therefore , "
31734	31748	31731	31731	he	93	" that I was misinformed as to this being a proposal of marriage . "
31749	31753	31755	31755	Hamlin	93	" Pardon me , "
31759	31782	31755	31755	Hamlin	93	" I told your cousin that I hoped that perhaps , at the end of those two years , or more , she might
31838	31838	31856	31856	his	166	"
31843	31847	31848	31848	he	166	" In short , "
31859	31906	31848	31848	he	166	" you offer to provide my cousin with a competence whereon to live , or get married , after she shall have remained for two years in your charge . I fully appreciate the intention of your proposal ; and I therefore beg to refuse it . "
31975	31985	31986	31986	he	166	" I quite understand your refusal , Mr Brown , "
31989	32028	31986	31986	he	166	" as a result of your interpretation of the case ; and I suppose I have no right to ask you to see my proposal , except as you would mean it were you to make it yourself . "
32041	32058	32059	32059	he	166	" If your intention is to marry my cousin , why not marry her at once ? "
32120	32124	32125	32125	he	166	" Because because , "
32128	32131	32133	32134	Richard Brown	166	" Because , "
32136	32177	32133	32134	Richard Brown	166	" a man in your position of life can not marry a girl like my cousin before she has been turned into a lady ; and because , even if this be granted , he can not bind himself to marry her

32261	32267	32269	32269	Hamlin	93	" You misunderstand my motives , "
32274	32346	32348	32348	Hamlin	93	" My reason for not marrying your cousin at once is , that I would not marry a woman who can not possibly love me as yet ; and my reason against a formal engagement between us is , that I can not consent to bind Miss Brown to marry me when she has no opportunity as yet of choosing a man more to her taste . It seems to me , "
32357	32392	32348	32348	Hamlin	93	" that to take your cousin in marriage now , or to bind her to marry me in the future , would be buying her in exchange for the education and the money which she will

32517	32526	32527	32527	he	93	" All this is very noble and chivalric , "
32530	32604	32527	32527	he	93	" and I doubt not quite natural in a poet like you , Mr Hamlin ; but for us practical people , I fear it won t do . I am fully persuaded of the desirability of giving my cousin some further schooling , and fully persuaded also of the undesirability of leaving her any longer in the care of Mr Perry . So I shall take her back to England with me . "
32654	32658	32660	32660	Hamlin	93	" I see , "
32675	32718	32670	32671	his guest	303	" I see that , in plain words , you suppose that I project settling some money upon your cousin , with a view of making her my mistress for two years that is it , is it not , Mr Brown ? "
32780	32794	32772	32772	he	166	" Yes , sir ; that is exactly the state of the case . "
32808	32813	32814	32814	he	93	" In that case , "
32817	32885	32814	32814	he	93	" I think I can devise a plan which shall satisfy you which will relieve your apprehensiveness . I offer not merely to settle upon Miss Brown the capital of five hundred a?year , to be administered by you until her majority ; but also to give you my word of honour to marry Miss Brown at any time that she may summon me to do so . "
32911	32918	32919	32919	he	166	" I don t understand you , "
32922	32936	32919	32919	he	166	" I don t understand what you want to do with my cousin . "
32937	32950	32952	32952	Hamlin	93	" It seems difficult to explain it to you , Mr Brown , "
32954	32998	32952	32952	Hamlin	93	" still , I may repeat it . I wish Miss Brown to receive all the advantages of education and money which a woman gifted like her has a right to , and which will enable her to freely marry a man worthy of her

33063	33075	33076	33076	he	1058	" Are you ready to sign a document to that effect ? "
33079	33088	33090	33090	Hamlin	93	" I will give Miss Brown my word , "
33094	33117	33090	33090	Hamlin	93	" and I will give you , Mr Brown , as many signed documents as may be equivalent thereto in your eyes . "
33164	33201	33162	33162	he	166	" On these conditions I can no longer make any opposition ; and it rests with my cousin to accept or refuse your offer . I can only warn her and you and to do so is my

33235	33243	33245	33245	Hamlin	93	" I take your warning to heart , "
33249	33330	33245	33245	Hamlin	93	" but I can not agree with it . May I beg you to meet me at the English Consulate to?morrow morning , to witness the document which you proposed I should draw out ; the matter of her money settlement I shall leave in the hands of my lawyers . What hour will suit you ? and may I have the pleasure of receiving you to breakfast with me and Mr Perry , who will doubtless be my witness ? "
33335	33339	33340	33340	he	166	" Thank you , "
33344	33379	33381	33381	his	166	" I think I should prefer breakfasting at my inn . With regard to the document , I shall be happy to meet you at the Consulate any time convenient to yourself . But , "
33393	33400	33387	33387	his	166	" we must first hear whether , on

33417	33421	33423	33423	Hamlin	93	" Good afternoon , "
33467	33478	33479	33479	she	94	" So you have seen our noble , darling Hamlin , "
33482	33500	33479	33479	she	94	" and you have felt your heart go out to meet him as we have felt ours . "
33501	33508	33510	33510	Brown	166	" I have seen Mr Hamlin , "
33523	33536	33510	33510	Brown	166	" and I should like to speak to my cousin , please . "
33537	33542	33544	33545	Mrs Perry	94	" Anne my beautiful Anne "
33555	33559	33560	33560	she	94	" Poor child ! "
33563	33575	33560	33560	she	94	" how she has been trembling in her heart all day ! "
33616	33622	33623	33623	she	91	" Good afternoon , Richard , "
33649	33657	33658	33658	she	91	" Don t be unhappy , darling , "
33663	33693	33658	33658	she	91	" I know how one woman always longs for another woman in these moments . I will stay with you while your cousin tells you the result of his visit .
33694	33694	33646	33646	her	94	"
33695	33705	33707	33707	Brown	91	" It is very kind of you , madam , "
33710	33739	33707	33707	Brown	91	" but I think this matter had better be settled solely between my cousin and myself . Would you permit her to take me into some other room ? "
33740	33750	33752	33753	Mrs Perry	94	" Oh , I don t wish to intrude , "
33755	33782	33785	33785	she	94	" I only wished to support this poor child with my presence . But after all , a woman who loves requires support from no one . "
33799	33810	33812	33812	Brown	91	" I have been to Mr Hamlin s , Anne , "
33821	33824	33816	33816	himself	91	" Well ? "
33862	33865	33867	33867	Brown	91	" Well , "
33892	33932	33877	33877	his	1067	" I have spoken to Mr Hamlin ; and I find that you were correct in your judgment , and that I was mistaken in mine . He is in earnest in his proposal , and honest in it . "
33933	33938	33940	33941	Anne Brown	91	" I knew that ; "
34058	34063	34064	34064	she	91	" I knew that , "
34067	34077	34078	34078	she	91	" though you would not believe it . So , "
34089	34113	34078	34078	she	91	" I suppose I am left free to decide , and that you are ready to let Mr Hamlin do what he chooses . "
34114	34121	34122	34122	he	1076	" You are free to decide , "
34125	34169	34078	34078	she	91	" Mr Hamlin , as I have said , is serious and honest , and willing to make every provision which can bind him and leave you free , legally . I can not , as your guardian , say no . But , "
34178	34201	34171	34171	his	1076	" as your kinsman , and as the representative of your father , I most earnestly dissuade you from accepting this proposal . "
34205	34214	34215	34215	she	91	" But you can no longer oppose it , "
34219	34229	34230	34230	Anne	91	" I have told you before that you are free ,
34238	34257	34263	34263	I	0	" continued Brown , a sort of despair coming over him at the sight of the girl s indifference "
34358	34358	34343	34343	You	91	"
34364	34368	34371	34372	Richard Brown	166	" Of course , "
34375	34455	34371	34372	Richard Brown	166	" you will have every worldly advantage . But will you be happy taken out of your own sphere of life , knowing yourself to be bound in gratitude to this man , who will always continue to feel your superior , to look down upon you as a beggar whom he has fed , or a chattel which he has bought ? This man is , for his class and ideas , honourable : he wishes to leave you free
34543	34543	34544	34544	Anne	91	"
34634	34639	34641	34641	Brown	91	" Annie , dear , "
34645	34675	34641	34641	Brown	91	" you know I am a rough man , and don t know how to mince matters and say things to women ; but you know that I am fond of

34772	34780	34782	34782	Brown	91	" Don t cry don t cry ! "
34788	34898	34782	34782	Brown	91	" Poor child ! I know it must be very hard for you who are so young ; I know what it must be to be tempted with a lady s education , and money , and a fine gentleman , who s in love with one , for a husband . But remember what your poor dad used to tell us , that we common folk must make our own way make the others feel that we re as good as they , and not accept anything from them . D you remember how he used to say to me , Work and be proud ? Well , and I
34935	34935	34933	34933	Annie	91	"
34936	34940	34941	34941	he	1093	" Look here , "
34945	35082	34941	34941	he	1093	" you must not think you are never to be anything but a servant . I feel I ve been to blame , and neglected you too long . You see , I ve had to work hard for my life , out in England ; but now I am quite safely off indeed much better off than I ever anticipated : my employer is going to take me into partnership next year . Well , since you wish to go to school , I will send you there . You shall come back with me to England , and I will send you to the very best school to be found : you shall be as good as any lady , and you shall owe nothing to any one . Annie , do say yes . "
35177	35185	35186	35186	she	91	" You are very good , Dick , "
35195	35211	35186	35186	she	91	" but but oh no , no , I can t , I can t ! "
35221	35226	35228	35228	Brown	166	" Can t what ? "
35237	35342	35231	35231	his	166	" can t what ? Can t accept my offer ; can t owe anything to me , to your cousin , to the man to whom your father confided you ? No ! you won t be under such an obligation , eh ? Nay , don t humbug me . You can t give up the money , the land , the house , the fine name all the things which he can give you and I can t ; for I can only give you an education , and I was such a fool as to think that you wanted that ! "
35352	35360	35361	35361	he	166	" You want to marry that man , "
35366	35484	35361	35361	he	166	" well , do so . But remember what marriage means . You are a girl of the people , who has had to take care of herself not a fine young lady , as yet , thank God , with all the fine names which fine folk have for nasty things . You know what marriage means . It means being a man s chattel , more than his beast of burden , his plaything , the toy of his caprice and sensuality . It means , also , that you must smother all love for a worthier man , or degrade yourself in your own eyes . Will you be this , sell yourself thus ? "
35485	35496	35498	35499	the girl	327	" Mr Hamlin does not wish me to degrade myself , "
35501	35517	35498	35499	the girl	327	" He respects me , yes , he does ; and you you don t ! "
35518	35523	35525	35525	Brown	166	" He respects you ! "
35527	35580	35525	35525	Brown	166	" And he does not want to degrade you . Of course , he s a respectable , highly moral man . But , upon my soul , I would rather you had been seduced by a man you loved , than that you should have sold yourself coldly in this way . "
35620	35625	35626	35626	Brown	91	" I love him ! "
35676	35681	35682	35682	she	91	" I love him ! "
35690	35693	35694	35694	he	1100	" Good?bye , "
35702	35753	35754	35754	he	1100	" I left the choice in your hands , and you have chosen . To?morrow morning I shall settle everything with Mr Hamlin the papers , I mean which shall make him henceforth your sole protector . Then I shall go . Goodbye . I wish you joy of your choice "
35756	35761	35762	35762	Anne	91	" you mercenary thing ! "
35781	35786	35787	35787	he	1100	" One thing more , "
35790	35794	35787	35787	he	1100	" which I desire you

But Mrs Simson had already made up her character of Anne Brown , and fallen in love with it quite independent of realities ; and Hamlin was rather pleased that the creature whom he was going to teach how to think and how to feel , did not manifest any particular mode of thinking and feeling of her own . So they were both extremely assiduous to Anne Brown , and in reality thought much more about what she was going to be than about what she actually was .
37160	37165	37166	37166	she	174	" My dear child , "
37180	37188	37166	37166	she	174	" what is the matter with you ? "

37348	37356	37357	37357	she	174	" Something is the matter with you , "
37360	37372	37374	37374	she	174	" Now just let us see together what it may be ; "
37388	37437	37374	37374	she	174	" Are you homesick ? do you feel very strange , poor dearie , with strange people ? are you frightened a little by the sudden change in your life ? it s very natural , my dear little girl , but you ll get over it soon . "
37467	37472	37473	37473	she	174	" No , no , "
37476	37503	37473	37473	she	174	" oh no , no you can t understand . I don t feel lonely I don t feel unhappy but it s only because Mr Hamlin "

Would you perhaps let me rent them for a studio ? My own lodgings are a long way from St John s House that is its name , for it was a priory once ; but if I had my workshop there , I might hope to see you almost every day , if you would let me . "

44791	44806	44808	44809	Mrs Simson	174	" A young lady of your age can not travel alone , my dear , "
44869	44876	44878	44878	Anne	91	" Please don t do that ! "
44883	44892	44878	44878	Anne	91	" I will do it myself , please . "
44907	44917	44893	44894	The girl	327	" I was only packing your trunk , miss . "
44918	44925	44927	44927	Anne	91	" I will do it myself ! "
44931	44938	44940	44941	the maid	1376	" As you wish , madam , "
44950	44958	44959	44959	she	1376	" Can I do nothing for you ? "
44979	44988	44989	44989	she	91	" You can help me if you like , "
45049	45078	45042	45042	she	91	" Don t do that for me ; I am not a real lady ; I am no better than you ; I am a servant , a maid ,
45084	45105	45082	45082	myself	0	" and as if every moment of silence were a kind of deceit . At last she could bear it no longer
45106	45109	45110	45110	she	91	" Please , "
45113	45139	45110	45110	she	91	" let me pack my things myself ; I have always packed them myself ; I should be so glad if you would let me . "
45146	45153	45154	45154	she	91	" As you like , miss , "
45167	45186	45188	45188	Anne	91	" She knows I am only a servant like herself , and she thinks me proud and ungrateful , "
45922	45930	45910	45910	her	1376	" There s Mr Hamlin , miss ; "
46001	46013	46040	46040	Hamlin	93	" I fear you must be very tired , Miss Brown . "
46337	46344	46346	46346	Hamlin	93	" You must be very tired , "
46348	46352	46354	46354	Anne	91	" Oh no , "
46366	46371	46372	46372	He	93	" not at all . "
46469	46473	46475	46475	Hamlin	93	" I hope , "
46490	46509	46510	46510	he	93	" I hope you will like the house and the way I have had it arranged ; and , "
46513	46535	46510	46510	he	93	" I hope you will like my aunt . She is rather misanthropic , but it is only on the surface . "
46802	46811	46813	46813	Hamlin	93	" This is Miss Brown , Aunt Claudia , "
46830	46841	46842	46842	she	920	" I am glad to see you , my dear , "
46899	46909	46886	46886	Hamlin	93	" Well , what do you think of her ? "
46916	46926	46928	46929	Mrs Macgregor	187	" You have had a bad passage , doubtless , "
46938	46942	46944	46944	Anne	91	" Oh no , "
46948	46957	46944	46944	Anne	91	" not at all bad , thank you . "
46958	46964	46967	46969	the old lady	920	" So much the better , "
46973	46981	46982	46982	Hamlin	93	" Ring for some tea , Walter . "
47005	47012	47014	47015	Mrs Macgregor	187	" It is a long drive , "
47016	47027	47014	47015	Mrs Macgregor	187	" a long drive all the way from Charing Cross . "
47028	47046	47048	47048	Hamlin	93	" Miss Brown came by the Antwerp boat St Catherine s Wharf in the City , aunt , "
47050	47085	47048	47048	Hamlin	93	" Ah , yes , to be sure perhaps she would like some more milk in her tea . There is always such a delay at Charing Cross , isn t there , Walter ? "
47112	47126	47127	47127	she	187	" You are glad to be back in London , aren t you ? "
47130	47141	47143	47143	Anne	91	" This is the first time I am in England , "
47176	47184	47186	47186	Hamlin	93	" Miss Brown was born in Italy , "
47194	47207	47186	47186	Hamlin	93	" Oh yes , of course ; how stupid I am ! And ,
47244	47244	47222	47223	Mr Chough	194	"
47245	47249	47251	47251	Hamlin	93	" All right , "
47253	47263	47265	47266	Mrs Macgregor	187	" Won t you have another cup , Margaret ? "
47268	47275	47265	47266	Mrs Macgregor	187	" Her name is Anne , auntie "
47276	47295	47222	47223	Mr Chough	194	" Of course I don t know whether you take sugar in your tea or not , Rachel . "
47340	47346	47347	47347	he	93	" It is getting late , "
47350	47378	47347	47347	he	93	" and I fear Miss Brown must be tired after her long journey . I think you had better not keep her up any longer , aunt . "
47379	47385	47387	47387	Anne	91	" I am not tired , "
47389	47396	47398	47400	the old lady	920	" You will be tired to?morrow , "
47402	47405	47407	47407	Hamlin	93	" Yes , "
47409	47459	47461	47461	he	93	" and I must go . Good?bye , aunt . Good night , Miss Brown ; I hope you will have good dreams to welcome you home to England . I shall come in for lunch to?morrow , Aunt Claudia . Good night . Good night , Miss Brown , "
47466	47476	47461	47461	he	93	" Good night , buon riposo e sogni felici . "
47570	47574	47587	47587	she	1376	" Of course , "
47628	47637	47638	47638	she	1376	" Shall I undress you , ma am ? "
47646	47651	47641	47641	Anne	91	" No , thanks . "
47682	47690	47692	47693	Mrs Macgregor	187	" Undo your hair , Eliza dear , "
47724	47733	47734	47734	she	920	" You are a beautiful girl , Anne , "
47744	47747	47748	47748	she	920	" and , "
47765	47774	47758	47758	she	920	" are you really in love with Watty ? "
47786	47795	47797	47799	the old lady	920	" Marriage without love is a terrible thing , "
47801	47819	47797	47799	the old lady	920	" and in so far love is a mitigation of evil ; but at the best it is only
47841	47841	47838	47839	my dear	2056	"
48938	48949	48950	48950	she	1376	" I have been looking for you everywhere , miss , "
48953	49014	48950	48950	she	1376	" I thought , as you didn t answer when I knocked , that you must still be asleep , so I carried your tea down again . Mrs Macgregor is going to have breakfast now , and says , would you mind having it in her room with her , miss , as she never goes down till lunch ? "
49050	49062	49065	49066	Mrs Macgregor	187	" What an hour you do get up at , Charlotte ! "
49074	49080	49065	49066	Mrs Macgregor	187	" We never think of getting up
49122	49122	49113	49113	me	0	"
49138	49147	49148	49148	she	187	" You re a handsome girl , certainly , "
49151	49164	49166	49166	she	187	" not the style that used to be admired in my time , "
49177	49245	49166	49166	she	187	" girls had to be slight , and fair , and with little features then . But you re just what they like now . I m thankful at least that Walter has not brought home a bag of bones like the other beauties of his set . Loveliness in decay , that s what I call their style ; but you look a good flesh?and?blood girl . "
49317	49330	49331	49331	she	920	" That s a pretty frock you have on , my dear , "
49334	49519	49331	49331	she	920	" and I think it very becoming . But you ll see that Watty won t like it . He s quite the what do you call it ? medieval sort of thing , no stays , and no petticoats , and slashings , and tags and boot?laces in the sleeves , and a yard of draggled train that sort of thing . Oh , you ll find it a queer world , the world of Watty s friends . Do you ever see Punch ? That s the sort of thing . They re all great beauties and great painters and great poets , every man and woman of them . Wait till you see little Chough and young Posthlethwaite I forget his real name . Ah , well , it s perhaps better , after all , this kind of fooling , and masquerading , and writing verses about things people would horsewhip a man for saying in prose ; it s perhaps better , after all , for Watty , than the sort of life which we led when he was young "
49815	49820	49822	49822	Anne	91	" It s lovely , "
49824	49836	49822	49822	Anne	91	" and it is so nice having everything old about one . "
49837	49841	49843	49843	Hamlin	93	" Everything old ? "
49845	49876	49843	49843	Hamlin	93	" Yes ; all the hangings , and chairs , and tables , and mirrors , are of the time of the building of the house , aren t they ? "
49877	49883	49885	49885	Hamlin	93	" Oh goodness , no , "
49889	49918	49885	49885	Hamlin	93	" I only wish they were . They re bran?new , every stick of them . Everybody has them now ; nobody makes anything except imitation old?world things . "
49919	49935	49843	49843	Hamlin	93	" Why don t they try and make something good and new something out of their own
49944	49959	49939	49941	the old workmen	1545	" asked Anne , looking with wonder upon these new things which seemed so old .
49960	49969	49971	49971	Hamlin	93	" There is nothing to nourish art nowadays , "
49997	50028	49985	49985	he	93	" Art can t live where life is trivial and aimless and hideous . We can only pick up the broken fragments of the past and blunderingly set them together . "
50029	50044	50046	50046	Anne	91	" But why should the life of to?day be trivial and aimless and hideous ? "
50101	50111	50113	50113	Hamlin	93	" I don t know why it should be , "
50115	50121	50113	50113	Hamlin	93	" but so it is . "
50122	50129	50131	50131	Anne	91	" Can t we prevent it ? "
50159	50167	50168	50168	he	93	" Why can not we revive those ? "
50188	50348	50168	50168	he	93	" What is dead is dead . The only thing that remains for us late comers to do is to pick up the faded petals and keep them , discoloured as they are , to scent our lives . The world is getting uglier and uglier outside us ; we must , out of the materials bequeathed to us by former generations , and with the help of our own fancy , build for ourselves a little world within the world , a world of beauty , where we may live with our friends and keep alive whatever small sense of beauty and nobility still remains to us , that it may not get utterly lost , and those who come after us may not be in a wilderness of sordid sights and sordid feelings . Ours is not the mission of the poets and artists of former days ; it is humbler , sadder , but equally necessary . "
50349	50359	50361	50361	Anne	91	" Oh , but you must not say that ! "
50363	50386	50361	50361	Anne	91	" What you do will last , don t you know , like the things which people were able to do formerly . "
50421	50430	50432	50432	Hamlin	93	" There is one consolation , Miss Brown , "
50461	50510	50456	50456	his	93	" and that is , that even now , Nature , which is so barren of painters and poets , can produce creatures as wonderful as those who inspired the painters and poets of former times a consolation , and at the same time a source of despair . "
50552	50557	50559	50559	Hamlin	93	" There s lunch , "
50561	50569	50559	50559	Hamlin	93	" We must finish our discussion afterwards . "
50573	50586	50588	50589	Mrs Macgregor	187	" WON T you take her out for a drive , Walter ? "
50594	50605	50588	50589	Mrs Macgregor	187	" She must be curious to see something of London . "
50617	50625	50606	50606	Hamlin	93	" Do you really wish to go ? "
50626	50641	50642	50642	he	93	" I am sure Miss Brown is too tired from her journey , aunt , "
50645	50660	50642	50642	he	93	" and what is there to take her to see in this beastly city ? "
50661	50682	50684	50685	Mrs Macgregor	187	" I thought we might have a brougham and take her to see a few of your friends , Walter , "
50699	50706	50707	50707	she	208	" Oh , please don t ! "
50709	50724	50642	50642	he	93	" not to?day ; don t take me to see any one , please . "
50725	50735	50737	50737	Hamlin	93	" It s much wiser to let her rest , "
50745	50761	50763	50764	his aunt	1332	" Won t you just take the poor girl to Mrs Argiropoulo s , Watty ? "
50766	50795	50763	50764	his aunt	1332	" It s a sin to keep her mewed up at Hammersmith all day ; and you know Mrs Argiropoulo was so anxious to see her at once . "
50796	50801	50803	50803	Hamlin	93	" Confound Mrs Argiropoulo ! "
50805	50845	50803	50803	Hamlin	93	" I beg your pardon , Miss Brown , but do you feel inclined , after your long journey , to go and see a fat , fashionable lion?huntress , with a snob of a husband who sells currants ? "
50846	50851	50853	50853	Anne	91	" Not at all , "
50857	50868	50853	50853	Anne	91	" I would much rather stay at home , really . "
50869	50915	50763	50764	his aunt	1332	" Very well ; then I will show you the garden and my studio , if you don t mind ; and a great friend of mine , Cosmo Chough , I think I sent you some of his poems about music . . . . "
50916	50920	50922	50922	Anne	91	" Oh yes , "
50924	50928	50922	50922	Anne	91	" they are lovely "
50929	50939	50941	50942	Mrs Macgregor	187	" I think little Chough s poems perfectly indecent , "
50944	50963	50941	50942	Mrs Macgregor	187	" I would much sooner let a girl read Don Juan , or even Candide , any day . "
50970	51005	50964	50964	Hamlin	93	" Opinions differ ; at any rate , Miss Brown knows only Chough s best things ; and when he is at his best , Chough is really very good and pure and elevated . "
51006	51011	51014	51015	Mrs Macgregor	187	" Ah , well , "
51017	51028	51031	51031	Hamlin	93	" Cosmo Chough said he would look in about four , "
51033	51046	51031	51031	Hamlin	93	" He is a strange creature , and sometimes says odd things . "
51047	51052	51055	51056	his aunt	1332	" Very odd things , "
51058	51075	51078	51078	Hamlin	93	" But he is as pure?minded a man as I know , and a real poet , "
51079	51124	51078	51078	Hamlin	93	" indeed quite one of the best ; and he is a great musician , and a most entertaining fellow his only weakness is that he is a great republican and democrat , but would like to be thought the son of a duke . "
51125	51132	51134	51134	Anne	91	" The son of a duke ? "
51139	51154	51156	51157	Mrs Macgregor	187	" Oh , the natural son , of course forgive me , my dear , "
51159	51167	51156	51157	Mrs Macgregor	187	" People nowadays like anything illegitimate it s a
51199	51199	51183	51185	Mr Cosmo Chough	194	"
51203	51237	51200	51200	Hamlin	93	" Poor Chough ! Some one told him he was like Richard Savage one day , and that s his pose . Would you like to come into the garden , Miss Brown ? "
51736	51740	51742	51742	Hamlin	93	" Miss Brown , "
51744	51755	51742	51742	Hamlin	93	" let me introduce my old friend , Cosmo Chough . "
51932	51935	51917	51917	he	194	" real country "
52045	52068	52069	52069	he	194	" We were trying over some of Jomelli s music a night or two ago , at Isaac the great composer s , "
52072	52098	52069	52069	he	194	" magnificent music , which no one can sing nowadays , and we feebly crowed , when in the midst of the great burst of the "
52100	52122	52016	52016	He	194	" I seemed to have revealed to me a vision of a mystic procession of women going in triumph ; I understood ,
52137	52137	52016	52016	He	194	"
52138	52146	52148	52148	Anne	91	" It must have been very beautiful , "
52175	52181	52182	52182	he	194	" Do you notice that ? "
52185	52248	52182	52182	he	194	" that sudden modulation there ta ta ti , la la la from A minor to E major , that somehow mysteriously brought home to me one of the figures of that triumphal procession , and her I have tried to describe . If you like , I can repeat you the first few lines ; it is called Imperia of Rome . "
52249	52255	52257	52257	Anne	91	" How good of you , "
52259	52279	52281	52281	Hamlin	93	" I think we had better put off hearing it till you have composed rather more of the poem , "
52299	52308	52309	52309	she	91	" Tell me all about Imperia of Rome , "
52312	52332	52309	52309	she	91	" Who was she ? had she anything to do with the Scipios , or Cato , or Tarquin ? "
52333	52341	52343	52343	Chough	194	" Imperia was not an ancient Roman , "
52345	52384	52343	52343	Chough	194	" she lived at the beginning of the sixteenth century , and it is said that all the cardinals and poets and artists of Rome , nay , the Pope himself , accompanied her coffin when she died . "
52385	52398	52309	52309	she	91	" Why , what had she done ? was she a saint ? "
52399	52422	52424	52424	Chough	194	" The inscription on her tomb is , I think , the most truly noble and Roman ever composed on any woman , "
52426	52431	52424	52424	Chough	194	" Imperia . . . "
52432	52442	52444	52444	Hamlin	93	" Miss Brown doesn t understand Latin , Cosmo , "
52448	52491	52492	52492	he	93	" and I am sure she would take no interest in Imperia or her epitaph . Supposing you let Miss Brown hear some of that beautiful Jomelli Mass you were speaking about . Chough is one of the finest musicians I know , "
52497	52502	52492	52492	he	93	" and he is quite famous
52513	52513	52492	52492	he	93	"
52662	52667	52669	52671	the little poet	1580	" Will you sing ? "
52675	52679	52669	52671	the little poet	1580	" you must have a
52695	52695	52690	52690	your	194	"
52701	52708	52710	52710	Hamlin	93	" Do sing , Miss Brown , "
52818	52823	52824	52824	he	194	" A splendid voice ! "
52827	52853	52824	52824	he	194	" you must sing , Miss Brown you must study I will come and practise your accompaniments for you , if you will permit me . "
52872	52883	52884	52885	Miss Brown	91	" You will let Chough teach you , won t you ,
52887	52950	52884	52885	Miss Brown	91	" asked Hamlin , approvingly . He afterwards told her that Chough spent whatever leisure remained from an inferior Government offce , in which , together with a whole band of other poets , he was employed , in playing accompaniments for various young ladies whom he considered , each singly , the most divine types of womanhood whom he had ever met .
53032	53042	53043	53043	he	194	" It is a lock of Lucretia Borgia s , "
53059	53080	53043	53043	he	194	" a bit of the one which Byron possessed , the most precious thing I have in all the world . "
53081	53098	53100	53100	Anne	91	" She was rather an insignificant character though , on the whole , wasn t she ? "
53108	53119	53100	53100	Anne	91	" a sort of characterless villain , the Germans say . "
53125	53128	53129	53129	he	194	" Insignificant ! "
53131	53176	53100	53100	Anne	91	" a Borgia insignificant ! Why , her blood ran with evil as the Pactolus does with gold . All women that have ever been , except Sappho and Vittoria Accoramboni , and perhaps Faustina , were lifeless shadows by her side . . . "
53177	53192	53194	53194	Anne	91	" I don t believe in those sort of women having been very remarkable , "
53203	53208	53194	53194	Anne	91	" except for disreputableness . "
53209	53227	53229	53229	Chough	194	" But that is just it , that which you call disreputableness , my dear Miss Brown , "
53231	53243	53229	53229	Chough	194	" therein is their greatness , in that fiery . . . "
53250	53261	53262	53262	she	91	" I daresay great women have often committed great crimes , "
53265	53276	53262	53262	she	91	" but then they have had great plans and ambitions ; they
53286	53292	53262	53262	she	91	" and she relapsed into silence .
53370	53375	53377	53377	Hamlin	93	" Confound Mrs Argiropoulo ! "
53382	53389	53377	53377	Hamlin	93	" to come intruding so soon . "
53390	53397	53399	53399	Anne	91	" Is that the lion?hunting lady ? "
53401	53418	53399	53399	Anne	91	" Yes ; I suppose you must receive her , as she has called on you . "
53419	53424	53426	53426	Anne	91	" Called on me ? "
53430	53447	53426	53426	Anne	91	" you mean on Mrs Macgregor . Why , how should she have heard of me ? "
53448	53459	53465	53465	he	194	" All London has heard of you , Miss Brown , "
53472	53477	53465	53465	he	194	" at least all that deserves
53519	53519	53511	53511	I	0	"
53721	53738	53740	53742	the Greek lady	1600	" You must let me take your ward into society a little , dear Mrs Macgregor , "
53744	53769	53740	53742	the Greek lady	1600	" for I know you hate going out of an evening . Miss Brown must meet some of the principal persons of our set . "
53795	53810	53812	53812	Anne	91	" What in the world can she have to do among artists and poets ? "
53814	53822	53824	53824	Chough	194	" Her husband is in the currant?trade , "
53825	53851	53824	53824	Chough	194	" an awful old noodle , but he buys more pictures of our school than any one else . Their house is a perfect wonder . "
53852	53869	53871	53871	Hamlin	93	" My aunt is going to ask a few friends to meet Miss Brown first here , "
53873	53893	53871	53871	Hamlin	93	" perhaps you will join them , Mrs Argiropoulo . There s plenty of time to think of party?going . "
53894	53901	53903	53904	Mrs Argiropoulo	209	" Very good , very good , "
53906	53926	53903	53904	Mrs Argiropoulo	209	" meanwhile perhaps I may have the pleasure of taking Miss Brown out for a drive once or twice . "
53927	53936	53938	53938	Hamlin	93	" I am sure she will be delighted , "
53940	53946	53948	53948	Hamlin	93	" I hate that woman ! "
53964	53973	53951	53951	he	93	" an odious , inquisitive , vulgar brute . "
53974	53982	53984	53984	Anne	91	" She looks good?natured , I think , "
53986	53994	53984	53984	Anne	91	" Oh , every one s good?natured ! "
53995	54002	54004	54005	Mrs Macgregor	187	" In your set , Watty ? "
54009	54015	54017	54017	Hamlin	93	" Every one s good?natured ! "
54026	54084	54020	54020	himself	93	" and so s Mrs Argiropoulo . But a kind of grain that sets my nerves off . That s the misfortune of London , that a lot of vulgar creatures , merely because they buy our pictures and give dinners , have come and invaded our set , showing us , like so many wild beasts , to
54104	54112	54145	54146	Mrs Macgregor	187	" he added , turning to Anne , "
54134	54134	54145	54146	Mrs Macgregor	187	"
54135	54143	54145	54146	Mrs Macgregor	187	" Upon whipped cream and Swiss champagne , "
54147	54200	54145	54146	Mrs Macgregor	187	" what one might call the real , genuine , four hundred a?year intellectual world . Ah , well , Walter ! you needn t look reproachful ; but it is droll what sort of people you have come to associate with clerks and penny?a?liners , each of them a great poet . "
54205	54216	54217	54217	he	93	" One must make a world for one s self , "
54253	54272	54273	54273	she	1606	" On the whole , I m quite as well pleased not to take her out at once , "
54276	54278	54273	54273	she	1606	" I m
54351	54351	54348	54348	their	1608	"
54352	54359	54361	54362	little Chough	194	" I know what mine is , "
54365	54438	54361	54362	little Chough	194	" that she is the divinest woman , in the cold , imperial style , with a latent and strange smouldering passion , that I ever set eyes on . And as to that flabby elephant Posthlethwaite , and that little hop , skip , and jump of an impudent jackanapes O Reilly , I wonder how you can think their opinion worth having , or , indeed , their presence supportable . "
54449	54460	54461	54461	she	209	" I know you don t like those young men , "
54464	54478	54461	54461	she	209	" Posthlethwaite s your rival , they say ; he writes even more improper things
54520	54520	54517	54517	your	1610	"
54547	54554	54555	54555	he	194	" Pray don t inconvenience yourself , "
54562	54585	54555	54555	he	194	" set me down at the corner of Park Lane . I shall walk home in less than a minute from there . "
54586	54594	54596	54597	Mrs Argiropoulo	209	" To the corner of Park Lane , "
55505	55520	55521	55521	he	93	" It s an invitation to Mrs Argiropoulo s big party on the twenty?seventh , "
55524	55570	55521	55521	he	93	" you must go , Miss Brown . She s an awful being herself ; but you ll see all the most interesting people in London at her house . Edith Spencer or Miss Pringle can take you , if Aunt Claudia feel too tired . "
55571	55579	55581	55582	Mrs Macgregor	187	" Aunt Claudia always feels too tired , "
55668	55676	55678	55678	Anne	91	" Oh , won t you go ? "
55680	55689	55678	55678	Anne	91	" won t you go , Mrs Macgregor ? "
55690	55695	55697	55697	Hamlin	93	" The fact is , "
55699	55711	55697	55697	Hamlin	93	" that you see Mrs Argiropoulo invites comparatively few people , and "
55712	55727	55729	55730	Aunt Claudia	193	" That she wants only celebrities , or great folk , or pretty girls , "
55737	55765	55733	55733	her	193	" or , as she expresses it , that she wants no padding . So you must go with Mrs Spencer or Miss Pringle , my dear . "
55766	55795	55697	55697	Hamlin	93	" But it is abominable ; it is most rude of Mrs Argiropoulo ; and I certainly won t go anywhere where Aunt Claudia has not been invited . "
55796	55801	55803	55805	the old lady	920	" Nonsense , Nan , "
55807	55849	55803	55805	the old lady	920	" you re not up to this lion?hunting world yet . Where there are so many geniuses on the loose , and so many professed beauties , there are no chairs for old women , except countesses or school board managers . "
55850	55859	55861	55861	Anne	91	" But since you think Mrs Argiropoulo hateful , "
55866	55903	55861	55861	Anne	91	" why should you wish me to go ? You know I would much rather not ; and I think , considering her rudeness to your aunt , you ought not to wish me to go . "
55904	55912	55914	55914	Hamlin	93	" As you choose , Miss Brown , "
55918	55929	55914	55914	Hamlin	93	" Don t be absurd , Anne you must go , "
55934	55970	55931	55932	Mrs Macgregor	187	" Listen : Watty has actually been addling his brains doing dressmaking ; he has invented a dress for you to go to the party , so you will break his heart if you refuse . "
55980	55997	55998	55998	he	93	" I hope you will not deem it a liberty on my part , Miss Brown , "
56001	56073	55998	55998	he	93	" but as I knew that this invitation was coming , I ventured to make a sketch of the sort of dress which I think would become you , and to give it to a woman who has made dresses from artists directions ; of course , if you don t think it pretty , you won t dream of putting it on . But I could not resist the temptation . "
56114	56134	56135	56135	she	91	" If you had shown me the sketch , I daresay I could have made up the dress myself , "
56138	56161	56135	56135	she	91	" I fear my sketch might not have been very intelligible to any one who had not experience of making such things . "
56162	56166	56168	56168	Anne	91	" Perhaps not , "
56190	56201	56183	56183	she	91	" It was very good of you , Mr Hamlin . "
56202	56217	56219	56220	Mrs Macgregor	187	" What an idiot I was to let the cat out of the bag ! "
56229	56253	56219	56220	Mrs Macgregor	187	" I ve spoilt your pleasure in the frock ; and there s Walter sulking because he thinks you won t like it . "
56254	56260	56262	56262	Anne	91	" I am very ungrateful , "
56481	56490	56492	56492	Anne	91	" I must get out a long petticoat , "
56496	56505	56507	56508	the dressmaker	1687	" Oh please , ma am , no , "
56510	56549	56507	56508	the dressmaker	1687	" On no account an additional petticoat it would ruin the whole effect . On the contrary , you ought to remove one of those you have on , because like this the dress can t cling properly . "
56550	56558	56560	56561	Miss Brown	91	" I won t have it cling , "
56565	56584	56560	56561	Miss Brown	91	" I will let alone the extra petticoat , but that s as much as I will do . "
56585	56593	56595	56596	the woman	1693	" As you please , ma am , "
56655	56659	56660	56660	she	91	" I think , "
56665	56694	56660	56660	she	91	" that there s something very odd about it , Mrs Perkins . It looks somehow all wrong . Are you sure that something hasn t got unstitched ? "
56695	56701	56703	56704	the dressmaker	1687	" No indeed , madam , "
56711	56721	56722	56722	she	91	" I have exactly followed the design ; and , "
56729	56757	56722	56722	she	91	" as it s I who execute the most difficult designs for the Lyceum , I think I may say that it could not be made differently . "
56779	56788	56790	56791	the maid	1376	" Mr Hamlin is down?stairs , Miss Brown , "
56807	56828	56796	56796	her	1376	" He said he would wait to see you after the dressmaker had left , if you had no objection . "
56829	56843	56849	56849	her	187	" Watty wants to see you in your new frock , my dear , "
56856	56860	56861	56861	Anne	91	" Come along . "
56894	56902	56886	56886	He	93	" My hair isn t done yet , "
56916	56929	56931	56931	Hamlin	93	" Leave it like that oh , do leave it like that ! "
56933	56939	56941	56941	he	93	" you can t think how "
56959	56971	56977	56977	he	93	" you can t think how beautiful you look , Anne ! "
56998	57006	57007	57007	he	93	" Forgive me , dear Miss Brown , "
57013	57039	56977	56977	he	93	" I knew how such a dress must suit you , and yet it has given me quite a shock to see you in it . "
57040	57054	57056	57056	Anne	91	" It was very kind of you to have it made for me , "
57058	57079	57056	57056	Anne	91	" and the stuff is very pretty also ; and and I am so glad you like me in it . "
57097	57101	57102	57102	he	93	" Thank you , "
57105	57146	57102	57102	he	93	" I must now go home and dress for that stupid dinner?party . I will meet you at Mrs Argiropoulo s at half?past ten or eleven . I suppose Edith Spencer will call for you soon after dinner . Good?bye . "
57354	57357	57359	57359	Anne	91	" Yes , "
57373	57405	57359	57359	Anne	91	" it is a very wonderful costume , isn t it ? Mr Hamlin designed it for me . I think it was so kind of him ; don t you ? "
57406	57417	57418	57418	she	91	" Kind ? I see nothing kind about it . Walter "
57438	57452	57418	57418	she	91	" is simply head over ears in love with you , my dear . "
57458	57462	57463	57463	she	91	" Oh no , "
57473	57500	57463	57463	she	91	" he is merely very good to me , that s all and perhaps he likes me also , of course . But that s all . "
57501	57544	57463	57463	she	91	" You know nothing of the world , Annie ; and still less of Walter . He has never in his life been fond of any one except when in love . I ve not known him these fifteen years for nothing . "
57545	57552	57554	57554	Anne	91	" I think you are mistaken , "
57558	57582	57554	57554	Anne	91	" I think you are not aware , my dear girl , that you are the most beautiful woman Walter has ever seen . "
