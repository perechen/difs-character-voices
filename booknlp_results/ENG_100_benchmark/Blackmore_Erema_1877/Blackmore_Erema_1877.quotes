376	430	350	350	he	431	" My reasons are my own ; let no man trouble himself about them . All my baggage I leave with you . I have paid my share of the venture , and shall claim it at Sacramento . My little girl and I will take this short - cut through the mountains . "

450	488	445	445	his	446	" Forgive and forget , Sir ; forgive and forget . What is a hot word spoken hotly ? If not for your own sake , at least come back for the sake of your young daughter . "

930	946	899	900	my father	431	" do you know , my own Erema , why I bring you from them ? "
947	967	899	900	my father	431	" Father dear , how should I know ? You have done it , and it must be right . "
968	1005	1006	1006	I	0	" It is not for their paltry insults . Child , you know what I think all that . It is for you , my only child , that I am doing what now I do . "
1085	1129	1064	1064	He	475	" Perhaps you will live to be thankful , my dear , that you had a stern , cold father . So will you meet the world all the better ; and , little one , you have a rough world to meet . "
1381	1384	1385	1385	he	431	" Erema , "
1388	1495	1385	1385	he	431	" at this corner where we stand there ought to be a very large pine - tree in sight , or rather a great redwood - tree , at least twice as high as any tree that grows in Europe , or Africa even . From the plains it can be seen for a hundred miles or more . It stands higher up the mountainside than any other tree of even half its size , and that makes it so conspicuous . My eyes must be failing me , from all this glare ; but it must be in sight . Can you see it now ? "
1496	1523	1678	1678	him	488	" I see no tree of any kind whatever , but scrubby bushes and yellow tufts ; and oh , father , I am so thirsty ! "
1524	1600	1678	1678	him	488	" Naturally . But now look again . It stands on a ridge , the last ridge that bars the view of all the lowland . It is a very straight tree , and regular , like a mighty column , except that on the northern side the wind from the mountains has torn a gap in it . Are you sure that you can not see it a long way off , but conspicuous ? "
1601	1630	1678	1678	him	488	" Father , I am sure that I can not see any tree half as large as a broomstick . Far or near , I see no tree . "
1631	1659	1678	1678	him	488	" Then my eyes are better than my memory . We must cast back for a mile or two ; but it can not make much difference . "

2495	2522	2523	2523	He	431	" but it has not been from want of love . Some day you will see all this , and some day you will pardon me . "
3036	3049	3050	3050	I	0	" Let us run , let us run , my dear father ! "
3053	3085	3050	3050	I	0	" Delicious water ! The dark falls quickly ; but we can get there before dark . It is all down hill . Oh , do let us run at once ! "

3098	3155	3090	3090	he	431	" there is no cause now for hurrying , except that I must hurry to show you what you have to do , my child . For once , at the end of my life , I am lucky . We have escaped from that starving desert at a spot at a spot where we can see "
3236	3283	3212	3212	I	0	" Oh , father , father , you have starved yourself , and given every thing to me ! What a brute I was to let you do it ! But I did not know ; I never knew ! Please God to take me also ! "
3314	3350	3299	3299	he	431	" What does it matter ? Oh , never mind , never mind such , a wretch as I am ! Father , only try to tell me what I ought to do for you . "

4663	4708	4547	4547	Suan	165	" I tell you , Suan , I want to see him . And I am not accustomed to be kept waiting . My dear father insisted always But oh , Suan , Suan , he is dead I am almost sure of it . "
4709	4741	4627	4627	she	165	" Him old man quite dead enough , and big hole dug in the land for him . Very good ; more good than could be . Suan no more Inglese . "

4967	5020	4959	4959	he	555	" What things she hath been through ! Will you take an old man 's hand , my dear ? Your father hath often taken it , though different from his rank of life . Sampson Gundry is my name , missy . Have you ever heard your father tell of it ? "
5021	5028	5029	5029	I	0	" Many and many a time , "
5042	5061	5029	5029	I	0	" He never found more than one man true on earth , and it was you , Sir . "

5084	5150	5072	5072	his	555	" you must not have that in your young head , missy . It leads to a miserable life . Your father hath always been unlucky the most unlucky that ever I did know . And luck cometh out in nothing clearer than in the kind of folk we meet . But the Lord in heaven ordereth all . I speak like a poor heathen . "
5151	5158	5159	5159	I	0	" Oh , never mind that ! "

5186	5295	5176	5176	I	0	" In plenty of time , my dear ; thanks to you . You must have fought when you could not fight : the real stuff , I call it . Your poor father lies where none can harm him . Come , missy , missy , you must not take on so . It is the best thing that could befall a man so bound up with calamity . It is what he hath prayed for for many a year if only it were not for you . And now you are safe , and for sure he knows it , if the angels heed their business . "

7418	7428	7429	7429	he	674	" Miss Rema , will you come with us ? "
7441	7459	7429	7429	he	674	" We are going up the mountain , to haul down the great tree to the mill . "
7460	7468	7469	7469	I	0	" To be sure I will come , "
7474	7484	7469	7469	I	0	" What great tree is it , Mr. Ephraim ? "
7485	7561	7433	7433	his	674	" The largest tree any where near here the one we cut down last winter . Ten days it took to cut it down . If I could have saved it , it should have stood . But grandfather did it to prove his rights . We shall have a rare job to lead it home , and I doubt if we can tackle it . I thought you might like to see us try . "
7614	7676	7597	7598	Mr. Gundry	169	" You must not go like this , my dear . We have three thousand feet to go upward . The air will be sharp up there , and I doubt if we shall be home by night - fall . Run , Suan , and fetch the young lady 's cloak , and a pair of thicker boots for change . "
8323	8524	8321	8321	himself	168	" Friends and neighbors , and hands of my own , I am taken in here , and I own to it . It serves me right for disbelieving what my grandson , Firm Gundry , said . I knew that the tree was a big one , of course , as every body else does ; but till you see a tree laid upon earth you get no grip of his girth , no more than you do of a man till he lieth a corpse . At the time of felling I could not come anigh him , by reason of an accident ; and I had some words with this boy about it , which kept me away ever since that time . Firm , you were right , and I was wrong . It was a real shame , now I see it , to throw down the ' King of the Mountains . ' But , for all that , being down , we must use him . He shall be sawn into fifty - foot lengths . And I invite you all to come again , for six or seven good turns at him . "

8711	8803	8696	8696	Firm	179	" we all have to thank you , more than I can tell , for coming to help us with this job . It was a job which required to be done for legal reasons which I do not understand , but no doubt they were good ones . For that we have my grandfather 's word ; and no one , I think , will gainsay it . Now , having gone so far , we will not be beaten by it , or else we shall not be Americans . "
8861	8870	8871	8871	he	169	" Firm knoweth the right thing to do , "
8874	8929	8871	8871	he	169	" and like a man he doeth it . But whatever aileth you , Miss Rema , and what can ' e see in the distance yonner ? Never mind , my dear , then . Tell me by - and - by , when none of these folk is ' longside of us . "

10102	10110	10112	10113	Mr. Gundry	169	" What a queer world it is ! "
10123	10154	10112	10113	Mr. Gundry	169	" Who ever would have dreamed , fifty years agone , that your father 's daughter would ever have come with a pipe to light for my father 's son ? "

10199	10226	10248	10248	he	169	" dear Uncle Sam , I am sure that it would be an honor to a princess to light a pipe for a man like you . "
10227	10240	10241	10241	he	169	" Miss Rema , I should rather you would talk no nonsense , "
10329	10341	10342	10342	he	169	" Why , how is this ? What 's the matter ? "
10367	10388	10342	10342	he	169	" Why , missy , you look as if you had never a friend in all the wide world left . "
10389	10397	10398	10398	I	0	" Then I must look very ungrateful , "
10401	10415	10398	10398	I	0	" for at any rate I have one , and a good one . "
10416	10431	10342	10342	he	169	" And do n't you know of any one but me , my dear ? "
10432	10448	10342	10342	he	169	" You and Suan Isco and Firm those are all I have any knowledge of . "
10449	10516	10342	10342	he	169	" ' Tis a plenty to my mind , almost too many . My plan is to be a good friend to all , but not let too many be friends with me . Rest you quite satisfied with three , Miss Rema . I have lived a good many years , and I never had more than three friends worth a puff of my pipe . "
10517	10545	10342	10342	he	169	" But one 's own relations , Uncle Sam people quite nearly related to us : it is impossible for them to be unkind , you know . "
10546	10632	10342	10342	he	169	" Do I , my dear ? Then I wish that I did . Except one 's own father and mother , there is not much to be hoped for out of them . My own brother took a twist against me because I tried to save him from ruin ; and if any man ever wished me ill , he did . And I think that your father had the same tale to tell . But there ! I know nothing whatever about that . "
10633	10712	10713	10714	The Sawyer	168	" Now you do , Mr. Gundry ; I am certain that you do , and beg you to tell me , or rather I demand it . I am old enough now , and I am certain my dear father would have wished me to know every thing . Whatever it was , I am sure that he was right ; and until I know that , I shall always be the most miserable of the miserable . "
10775	10780	10781	10781	he	168	" Lord bless me ! "
10784	10900	10781	10781	he	168	" what a young gal you are ! Or , at least , what a young Miss Rema . What good can you do , miss , by making of a rout ? Here you be in as quiet a place as you could find , and all of us likes and pities you . Your father was a wise man to settle you here in this enlightened continent . Let the doggoned old folk t'other side of the world think out their own flustrations . A female young American you are now , and a very fine specimen you will grow . ' Tis the finest thing to be on all God 's earth . "
10901	10988	10781	10781	he	168	" No , Mr. Gundry , I am an English girl , and I mean to be an Englishwoman . The Americans may be more kind and generous , and perhaps my father thought so , and brought me here for that reason . And I may be glad to come back to you again when I have done what I am bound to do . Remember that I am the last of seven children , and do not even know where the rest are buried . "
10989	11004	11005	11006	The Sawyer	168	" Now look straight afore you , missy . What do you see yonner ? "
11020	11052	11005	11006	The Sawyer	168	" I see enormous logs , and a quantity of saws , and tools I do n't even know the names of . Also I see a bright , swift river . "
11053	11076	10781	10781	he	168	" But over here , missy , between them two oaks . What do you please to see there , Miss Rema ? "
11077	11093	10781	10781	he	168	" What I see there , of course , is a great saw - mill . "
11094	11209	10781	10781	he	168	" But it would n't have been ' of course , ' and it would n't have been at all , if I had spent all my days a - dwelling on the injuries of my family . Could I have put that there unekaled sample of water - power and human ingenuity together without laboring hard for whole months of a stretch , except upon the Sabbath , and laying awake night after night , and bending all my intellect over it ? And could I have done that , think you now , if my heart was a - mooning upon family wrongs , and this , that , and the other ? "
13683	13721	13732	13732	he	862	" Castlewood , Master Colonist ; Castlewood is the name of the man that I have come to ask about . And you will find it worth your while to tell me all you know of him . "
13742	13745	13747	13748	Uncle Sam	181	" Wal , "
13774	13797	13767	13767	he	181	" Squire , I guess that you may be right . Considerations of that ' ere kind desarves to be considered of . "
13798	13810	13811	13812	the stranger	864	" Just so . I knew that you must see it , "
13817	13907	13811	13812	the stranger	864	" A stiff upper lip , as you call it here , is all very well to begin with . But all you enlightened members of the great republic know what is what . It will bring you more than ten years ' income of your saw - mill , and farm , and so on , to deal honestly with me for ten minutes . No more beating about the bush and fencing with me , as you have done . Now can you see your own interest ? "
13908	13929	14067	14067	his	181	" I never were reckoned a fool at that . Squire , make tracks , and be done with it . "
13930	14029	14067	14067	his	181	" Then , Master Colonist , or Colonel for I believe you are all colonels here your task is very simple . We want clear proof , sworn properly and attested duly , of the death of a villain George Castlewood , otherwise the Honorable George Castlewood , otherwise Lord Castlewood : a man who murdered his own father ten years ago this November : a man committed for trial for the crime , but who bribed his jailers and escaped , and wandered all over the Continent . What is that noise ? Have you got rats ? "
14030	14057	14061	14062	Uncle Sam	181	" Plenty of foreign rats , and native ' coons , and skunks , and other varmint . Wal , Squire , go on with it . "
14094	14101	14103	14104	the stranger	864	" The story is well known , "
14106	14122	14103	14104	the stranger	864	" we need make no bones of it . George Castlewood went about under a curse "
14123	14142	14067	14067	his	181	" Not quite so loud , Squire , if you please . My household is not altogether seasoned . "
14143	14279	14067	14067	his	181	" And perhaps you have got the young lady somewhere . I heard a report to that effect . But here you think nothing of a dozen murders . Now , Gundry , let us have no squeamishness . We only want justice , and we can pay for it . Ten thousand dollars I am authorized to offer for a mere act of duty on your part . We have an extradition treaty . If the man had been alive , we must have had him . But as he has cheated the hangman by dying , we can only see his grave and have evidence . And all well - disposed people must rejoice to have such a quiet end of it . For the family is so well known , you see . "
14280	14284	14103	14104	the stranger	864	" I see , "
14298	14325	14285	14286	Mr. Gundry	169	" Guess you want something more than that , though , Squire . Is there nothing more than the grave to oblige a noble Britisher with ? "
14326	14450	14067	14067	his	181	" Yes , Colonel ; we want the girl as well . We know that she was with him in that caravan , or wagon train , or whatever you please to call it . We know that you have made oath of his death , produced his child , and obtained his trunks , and drawn his share in the insurance job . Your laws must be queer to let you do such things . In England it would have taken at least three years , and cost a deal more than the things were worth , even without a Chancery suit . However , of his papers I shall take possession ; they can be of no earthly use to you . "
14451	14488	14285	14286	Mr. Gundry	169	" To be sure . And possession of his darter too , without so much as a Chancery suit . But what is to satisfy me , Squire , agin goin' wrong in this little transaction ? "
14489	14497	14499	14500	the stranger	864	" I can very soon satisfy you , "
14502	14528	14499	14500	the stranger	864	" as to their identity . Here is their full , particular , and correct description names , weights , and colors of the parties . "
14871	14880	14881	14881	he	5186	" Sorry to keep you waiting , Colonel , "
14897	14927	14881	14881	he	5186	" Here it is . Now prick your ears up , and see if these candid remarks apply . I am reading from a printed form , you see : "
15105	15199	15203	15203	Colonel	179	" ' His only surviving child , a girl of about fifteen , has been seen with him . She is tall and slight and very straight , and speaks French better than English . Her hair is very nearly black , and her eyes of unusual size and lustre . She is shy , and appears to have been kept under , and she has a timid smile . Whether she knows of her father 's crime or not is quite uncertain ; but she follows him like a dog almost . ' "
15205	15217	15203	15203	Colonel	179	" cried the Englishman , as he folded the paper triumphantly ; "
15245	15338	15339	15339	Stranger	192	" Mr. Gundry was leaning back in his own corner , with a favorite pipe , carved by himself , reposing on his waistcoat . And being thus appealed to , he looked up and rubbed his eyes as if he had been dozing , though he never had been more wide awake , as I , who knew his attitudes , could tell . And my eyes filled with tears of love and shame , for I knew by the mere turn of his chin that he never would surrender me . "
15341	15351	15339	15339	Stranger	192	" he said , in a most provoking drawl , "
15425	15550	15404	15404	You	192	" The Englishman looked at him keenly , as if he had some suspicion of being chaffed ; but the face of the Sawyer was so grave and the bend of his head so courteous that he could not refuse to do as he was asked . But he glanced first at the whiskey bottle standing between the candlesticks ; and I knew it boded ill for his errand when Uncle Sam , the most hospitable of men , feigned pure incomprehension of that glance . The man should have no more under that roof . With a sullen air and a muttered curse , at which Mr. Gundry blew a wreath of smoke , the stranger unfolded his paper again , and saying , "
15560	15613	15552	15552	I	0	" read the whole of his description , with much emphasis , again , while the Sawyer turned away and beat time upon the hearth , with his white hair , broad shoulders , and red ears prominent . The Englishman looked very seriously vexed , but went through his business doggedly . "
15619	15627	15628	15628	Wal	187	" he asked when he had finished . "
15634	15718	15632	15632	Squire	188	" replied Uncle Sam , still keeping up his provoking drawl , but turning round and looking at the stranger very steadfastly , ' some thin 's is so pooty and so ilegantly done , they seems a'most as good as well - slung flapjacks . A natteral honest stomick ca n't nohow have enough of them . Mought I be so bold , in a silly , mountaneous sort of a way , as to ax for another heerin ' of it ? "
15719	15729	15731	15732	the visitor	835	" Do you mean to insult me , Sir ? "
15750	15756	15758	15759	Mr. Gundry	169	" Stranger , I mought , "
15774	15821	15768	15768	his	169	" I mought so do , barrin ' one little point . The cutest commissioner in all the West would have to report ' Non compos ' if his orders was to diskiver somethin' capable of bein ' insulted in a fellow of your natur ' . "
15884	15924	15855	15856	His visitor	883	" Colonel , you are a ' cure , ' as we call it on our side of the herring pond . What have I done to ' riz your dander , ' as you elegantly express it here ? "
15925	15964	16745	16747	That execrable man	884	" Britisher , nothing . You know no better . It takes more than that to put my back up . But forty years agone I do believe I must ' a heaved you out o ' window . "
15965	16082	16745	16747	That execrable man	884	" Why , Colonel , why ? Now be reasonable . Not a word have I said reflecting either upon you or your country ; and a finer offer than I have made can not come to many of you , even in this land of gold . Ten thousand dollars I offer , and I will exceed my instructions and say fifteen , all paid on the nail by an order on Frisco , about which you may assure yourself . And what do I ask in return ? Legal proof of the death of a man whom we know to be dead , and the custody of his child , for her own good . "
16083	16139	15855	15856	His visitor	883	" Squire , I have no other answer to make . If you offered me all the gold dug in these mountains since they were discovered , I could only say what I have said before . You came from Sylvester 's ranch there is time for you to get back ere the snow begins . "
16140	16185	15855	15856	His visitor	883	" What a hospitable man you are ! Upon my word , Gundry , you deserve to have a medal from our Humane Society . You propose to turn me out of doors to - night , with a great fall of snow impending ? "
16186	16262	16745	16747	That execrable man	884	" Sir , the fault is entirely your own . What hospitality can you expect after coming to buy my guest ? If you are afraid of the ten - mile ride , my man at the mill will bed you . But here you must not sleep , because I might harm you in the morning . I am apt to lose my temper sometimes , when I go on to think of things . "
16263	16330	16745	16747	That execrable man	884	" Colonel , I think I had better ride back . I fear no man , nor his temper , nor crotchets . But if I were snowed up at your mill , I never might cross the hill - foot for months ; but from Sylvester 's I can always get to Minto . You refuse , then , to help me in any way ? "
16331	16363	15855	15856	His visitor	883	" More than that . I will do every thing in my power to confound you . If any one comes prowling after that young lady , he shall be shot . "
16364	16396	16745	16747	That execrable man	884	" That is most discouraging . However , you may think better of it . Write to this address if you do . You have the girl here , of course ? "
16397	16433	16745	16747	That execrable man	884	" That is her concern and mine . Does your guide know the way right well ! The snow is beginning . You do not know our snows , any more than you know us . "
16434	16618	15855	15856	His visitor	883	" Never mind , Mr. Gundry . I shall do very well . You are rough in your ways , but you mean to do the right ; and your indignation is virtuous . But mark my words upon one little point . If George Castlewood had been living , I have such credentials that I would have dragged him back with me in spite of all your bluster . But over his corpse I have no control , in the present condition of treaties . Neither can I meddle with his daughter , if it were worth while to do so . Keep her and make the best of her , my man . You have taken a snake in the grass to your bosom , if that is what you are up for . A very handsome girl she may be , but a bad lot , as her father was . If you wish the name of Gundry to have its due respect hereafter , let the heir of the sawmills have nothing to do with the Honorable Miss Castlewood . "
16619	16626	16627	16628	Uncle Sam	181	" Let alone , let alone , "
16633	16744	16627	16628	Uncle Sam	181	" It is well for you that the ' heir of the saw - mills ' hath not heard your insolence . Firm is a steady lad ; but he knoweth well which foot to kick with . No fear of losing the way to Sylvester 's ranch with Firm behind you . But , meddlesome as you be , and a bitter weed to my experience , it shall not be said that Sampson Gundry sent forth a fellow to be frozen . Drink a glass of hot whiskey before you get to saddle . Not in friendship , mind you , Sir , but in common human nature . "
16809	16828	16803	16803	he	884	" Miss Rema , my dear , my poor little soul , what makes you carry on so ? "
16829	16849	16803	16803	he	884	" Because I have heard every word , Uncle Sam , and I was base enough to doubt you . "
17019	17030	17031	17031	I	0	" It can be done I am sure it can , "
17038	17076	17031	17031	I	0	" May I do it if I can ? It only requires perseverance . If you keep on sweeping as fast as it falls , you must overcome it . Do n't you see , Uncle Sam ? "
17077	17133	16984	16985	Mr. Gundry	169	" To be sure I do , Miss Rema , as plain as any pikestaff . Suan , fetch a double bundle of new brooms from top loft , and do n't forget while you be up there to give special orders no snow is to fall at night or when missy is at dinner . "
17134	17164	17031	17031	I	0	" You may laugh as much as you please , Uncle Sam , but I intend to try it . I must try to keep my path to somewhere . "
17165	17176	17178	17179	Mr. Gundry	169	" What a fool I am , to be sure ! "
17183	17273	17178	17179	Mr. Gundry	169	" There , now , I beg your pardon , my dear , for never giving a thought to it . Firm and I will do it for you , as long as the Lord allows of it . Why , the snow is two foot deep a'ready , and twenty foot in places . I wonder whether that rogue of a Goad got home to Sylvester 's ranch last night ? No fault of mine if he never did , for go he would in spite of me . "
17400	17402	17408	17408	I	0	" Amen "
17439	17442	17408	17408	I	0	" consecrated ground "
17668	17680	17682	17683	the Sawyer	834	" Well , I am sorry to hear it , Firm , "
17699	17780	17682	17683	the Sawyer	834	" Not that I care a cent for the fellow and an impudenter fellow never sucked a pipe . Still , he might have had time to mend , if his time had been as good as the room for it . However , no blame rests on us . I told him to bed down to saw - mill . They Englishmen never know when they are well off . But the horse got home , they tell me ? "
17781	17831	17842	17843	the Sawyer	834	" The horse got home all right , grandfather , and so did the other horse and man . But Sylvester thinks that a pile of dollars must have died out in the snow - drift . It is a queer story . We shall never know the rights . "
17832	17841	17842	17843	the Sawyer	834	" How many times did I tell him , "
17850	17923	17842	17843	the Sawyer	834	" that it were a risky thing to try the gulches , such a night as that ? His own way he would have , however ; and finer liars than he could ever stick up to be for a score of years have gone , time upon time , to the land of truth by means of that same view of things . They take every body else for a liar . "
17924	17934	17935	17935	I	0	" Oh , Uncle Sam , who is it ? "
17938	17955	17935	17935	I	0	" Is it that dreadful that poor man who wanted to carry me away from you ? "
17956	17972	17973	17974	Mr. Gundry	169	" Now you go in , missy ; you go to the fire - hearth , "
17982	18002	17973	17974	Mr. Gundry	169	" Leave you all such points to the Lord . They are not for young ladies to talk about . "
18003	18013	18015	18015	Firm	179	" Grandfather , do n't you be too hard , "
18024	18049	18015	18015	Firm	179	" Miss Rema has asked nothing unbecoming , but only concerning her own affairs . If we refuse to tell her , others will . "
18050	18060	18061	18062	the Sawyer	834	" Very well , then , so be it , "
18082	18154	18066	18066	he	834	" Turn the log up , Firm , and put the pan on . You boys can go on without victuals all day , but an old man must feed regular . And , bad as he was , I thank God for sending him on his way home with his belly full . If ever he turneth up in the snow , that much can be proved to my account . "
18239	18248	18249	18249	he	169	" Find him , Firm , find him , "
18273	18294	18249	18249	he	169	" And when he is found , call a public postmortem , and prove that we gave him his bellyful . "
18347	18358	18359	18361	the old man	908	" Take the snow - harrow , and take Jowler , "
18417	18428	18429	18429	I	0	" Oh , uncle , Firm will be lost himself ! "
18440	18464	18429	18429	I	0	" And the poor man , whoever he is , must be dead . Do call him back , or let me run . "
18499	18540	18480	18480	he	169	" Who was it spied you on the mountains , missy , the whole of the way from the redwood - tree , although you lay senseless on the ground , and he was hard at work with the loppings ? "
18541	18569	18480	18480	he	169	" Why , Ephraim , of course , Uncle Sam ; every body says that nobody else could have noticed such a thing at such a distance . "
18570	18610	18480	18480	he	169	" Very well , my dear ; and who was it carried you all the way to this house , without stopping , or even letting your head droop down , although it was a burning hot May morn ? "
18611	18650	18480	18480	he	169	" Mr. Gundry , as if you did not know a great deal better than I do ! It was weeks before I could thank him , even . But you must have seen him do it all . "
18703	18712	18713	18713	he	168	" Supposing now that he did all that , "
18721	18829	18713	18713	he	168	" is Firm the sort of boy you would look to to lose his own self in a snow - drift ? He has three men with him , and he is worth all three , let alone the big dog Jowler , who has dug out forty feet of snow ere now . If that rogue of an Englishman , Goad , has had the luck to cheat the hangman , and the honor to die in a Californy snow - drift , you may take my experience for it , missy , Firm and Jowler will find him , and clear Uncle Sam 's reputation . "
18944	18952	18954	18955	Sawyer Gundry	168	" It comes to the same thing , "
18957	19008	18954	18955	Sawyer Gundry	168	" it is foolish to be so particular . A thousand better men have sunk through being so pig - headed . We shall find the rogue toward the end of March , or in April , if the season suits . Firm , eat your supper and shake yourself . "
19587	19591	19592	19592	I	0	" Show me , "
19606	19624	19592	19592	I	0	" where and what the damage is . Is there any strain to the iron - work ? "
19625	19634	19635	19635	he	198	" Lor ' a mercy , young missus ! "
19648	19675	19635	19635	he	198	" where did you ever hear of ironwork ? Needles and pins is enough for you . Now do n't you go and make no mischief . "
19676	19685	19686	19686	I	0	" I have no idea what you mean , "
19689	19703	19686	19686	I	0	" If you have been careless , that is no concern of mine . "
19704	19764	19635	19635	he	198	" Careless , indeed ! And the way I works , when others is a - snorin ' in their beds ! I might just as well do nort , every bit , and get more thanks and better wages . That 's the way of the world all over . Come Saturday week , I shall better myself . "
19765	19793	19794	19794	I	0	" But if it 's the way of the world all over , how will you better yourself , unless you go out of the world altogether ! "
19826	19830	19832	19832	they	929	" better himself . "
19845	19853	19854	19854	he	198	" Do n't you be too sharp , "
19868	19900	19854	19854	he	198	" If half as I heard about you is true , you 'll want all your sharpness for yourself , Miss Remy . And the Britishers are worse than we be . "
19901	19914	19915	19915	I	0	" Well , Martin , I am sure you would help me , "
19918	19939	19915	19915	I	0	" if you saw any person injuring me . But what is it I am not to tell your master ? "
19940	20004	20005	20005	I	0	" My master , indeed ! Well , you need not tell old Gundry any thing about what you have seen . It might lead to hard words ; and hard words are not the style of thing I put up with . If any man tries hard words with me , I knocks him down , up sticks , and makes tracks . "
20034	20045	20046	20046	I	0	" You forget that I have not seen any thing , "
20049	20088	20046	20046	I	0	" and understand nothing but ' needles and pins . ' But , for fear of doing any harm , I will not even say that I have been down here , unless I am asked about it . "
20089	20144	20154	20154	him	5289	" Miss Remy , you are a good girl , and you shall have the mill some day . Lord , do n't your little great eyes see the job they are a - doin' of ? The finest stroke in all Californy , when the stubborn old chap takes to quartz - crushing . "
20390	20404	20405	20406	Mr. Gundry	169	" I 'll be bound that poor fellow is in a sad way , "
20413	20461	20405	20406	Mr. Gundry	169	" He knows how much he is to blame , and I fear that he wo n't eat a bit for the day . Martin is a most conscientious man . He will offer to give up his berth , although it would be his simple ruin . "
20497	20506	20508	20509	Sawyer Gundry	168	" We all must have our little mistakes , "
20511	20563	20508	20509	Sawyer Gundry	168	" but I never like to push a man when he feels it . I shall not say a syllable to Martin ; and , Ephraim , you will do the like . When a fellow sticks well to his work like Martin , never blame him for a mere accident . "
20601	20688	20593	20593	he	179	" I shall just go down and put it right myself . Martin is a poor hand at repairing . Firm , you go up the gulch , and see if the fresh has hurt the hurdles . Missy , you may come with me , if you please , and sketch me at work in the mill - wheel . You have drawn that wheel such a sight of times , you must know every feather of it better than the man who made it . "
20689	20698	20699	20699	I	0	" Uncle Sam , you are too bad , "
20702	20715	20699	20699	I	0	" I have never got it right , and I never shall . "

21416	21450	21401	21401	I	0	" there is something quite wrong in the weather , I am sure . I entreat you to come away at once , Uncle Sam . Every thing is so strange and odd . "
21451	21460	21462	21463	the Sawyer	834	" Why , what 's to do now ? "
21504	21525	21494	21494	his	908	" Missy , do n't you make a noise out there . You ca n't have your own way always . "
21526	21556	21401	21401	I	0	" Oh , Uncle Sam , do n't talk like that . I am in such a fright about you . Do come out and look at the mountains . "
21557	21625	21626	21627	Uncle Sam	181	" I have seen the mountains often enough , and I am up to every trick of them . There may be a corn or two of rain ; no more . My sea - weed was like tinder . There ca n't be no heavy storm when it is like that . Do n't you make pretense , missy , to know what is beyond you . "
22267	22276	22277	22277	I	0	" Oh , Uncle Sam ! Uncle Sam ! "
22311	22321	22322	22322	I	0	" What a brute what a wretch I am ! "
23984	23989	23982	23982	he	181	" good - by , "
24497	24506	24507	24507	I	0	" Please to tell me no more now , "
24514	24567	24507	24507	I	0	" my eyes are so sore they will be quite red , and perhaps Uncle Sam will come home to - night . I am afraid he has found some trouble with the money , or he ought to have been at home before . Do n't you think so , Suan ? "
24568	24585	24662	24662	her	549	" Yes , yes ; trouble with the money . Always with the white mans that . "
24586	24638	24662	24662	her	549	" Very well . I shall go and look for some money . I had a most wonderful dream last night . Only I must go quite alone . You had better go and look to the larder , Suan . If they come , they are sure to be hungry . "
24639	24654	24662	24662	her	549	" Yes , yes ; the white mans always hungry , sep when thirsty . "
25304	25314	25298	25298	I	0	" Oh ! what a beautiful great yellow fish ! "
25412	25421	25422	25422	I	0	" Now do n't be a stupid dog , "
25425	25443	25422	25422	I	0	" do what I tell you immediately . Whatever it is , bring it out , Sir . "
25455	25458	25452	25452	I	0	" Sir ; "
26994	27001	27004	27004	him	1111	" Cut it short , boys , "
27027	27057	27004	27004	him	1111	" If we mean to have fair play with the gal , now or never 's the time for it : old Sam may come home almost any time . "
28258	28263	28265	28266	the Sawyer	834	" Well , now , "
28281	28319	28265	28266	the Sawyer	834	" put this thing over your head , my dear , or you may gain a sun - stroke . I call it too bad of them skunks to drive you in Californy noon , like this . "
28320	28350	28265	28266	the Sawyer	834	" Oh , Uncle Sam , never think of me ; think of your house and your goods and Suan , and all at those bad men 's mercy ! "
28351	28360	28361	28361	he	834	" The old house ai n't afire yet , "
28373	28529	28530	28530	I	0	" And as for Suan , no fear at all . She knows how to deal with such gallowses ; and they will keep her to cook their dinner . Firm , my lad , let us go and embrace them . They would n't ' a made much bones of shooting us down if we had n't known of it , and if they had got miss afore the saddle . But if they do n't give bail , as soon as they see me ride up to my door , my name 's not Sampson Gundry . Only you keep out of the way , Miss Remy . You go to sleep a bit , that 's a dear , in the graywitch spinny yonder , and wait till you hear Firm sound the horn . And then come you in to dinner - time ; for the Lord is always over you . "
28882	28890	28891	28891	he	206	" Please to let me help you , "
28898	28918	28891	28891	he	206	" Why , miss , you are trembling dreadfully . I assure you there is no cause for that . "
28919	28947	28891	28891	he	206	" But you might have been killed , and Uncle Sam , and Martin , and every body . Oh , those men did look so horrible ! "
28948	29040	28891	28891	he	206	" Yes , they always do till you come to know them . But bigger cowards were never born . If they can take people by surprise , and shoot them without any danger , it is a splendid treat to them . But if any one like grandfather meets them face to face in the daylight , their respect for law and life returns . It is not the first visit they have paid us . Grandfather kept his temper well . It was lucky for them that he did . "
29100	29110	29111	29111	he	179	" They must be shot , sooner or later , "
29114	29207	29111	29111	he	179	" unless , indeed , they should be hanged . Their manner of going on is out of date in these days of settlement . It was all very well ten years ago . But now we are a civilized State , and the hand of law is over us . I think we were wrong to let them go . But of course I yield to the governor . And I think he was afraid for your sake . And to tell the truth , I may have been the same . "
29262	29274	29275	29275	he	179	" They rogues have had all the best of our victuals , "
29286	29331	29275	29275	he	179	" Respectable visitors is my delight , and welcome to all of the larder ; but at my time of life it goes agin the grain to lease out my dinner to galley - rakers . Suan , you are burning the fat again . "
29413	29424	29425	29425	he	179	" Thank God for a better meal than I deserve , "
29434	29483	29484	29484	He	179	" Suan , you are a treasure , as I tell you every day a'most . Now if they have left us a bottle of wine , let us have it up . We be all in the dumps . But that will never do , my lad . "
29660	29668	29669	29669	he	834	" It ai n't for the money , "
29682	29764	29669	29669	he	834	" the money might ' a been all very well and useful in a sort of way . But the feelin ' the feelin ' is the thing I look at , and it ought to have been more hearty . Security ! Charge on my land , indeed ! And I can run away , but my land must stop behind ! What security did I ask of them ? ' Tis enough a'most to make a rogue of me . "
29765	29775	29776	29776	I	0	" Nothing could ever do that , Uncle Sam , "
29800	29810	29811	29811	he	834	" Why , what was little missy thinking of ? "
29814	29828	29811	29811	he	834	" How solid she looks ! Why , I never see the like ! "
29829	29867	29669	29669	he	834	" Then you ought to have seen it , Uncle Sam . You ought to have seen it fifty times , with every body who loves you . And who can help loving you , Uncle Sam ? "
29868	29976	30011	30011	his	169	" Well , they say that I charged too much for lumber , a - cuttin ' on the cross , and the backstroke work . And it may ' a been so , when I took agin a man . But to bring up all that , with the mill strown down , is a cowardly thing , to my thinking . And to make no count of the beadin ' I threw in , whenever it were a straightforrard job , and the turpsy knots , and the clogging of the teeth ' tis a bad bit to swallow , when the mill is strown . "
29977	30003	30004	30005	Mr. Gundry	169	" But the mill shall not be strown , Uncle Sam . The mill shall be built again . And I will find the money . "
30035	30047	30048	30048	I	0	" Five thousand dollars you have got put by for me , "
30055	30110	30048	30048	I	0	" Five thousand dollars from the sale and the insurance fund . And five thousand dollars must be five - and - twenty thousand francs . Uncle Sam , you shall have every farthing of it . And if that wo n't build the mill again , I have got my mother 's diamonds . "
30111	30116	30118	30119	the Sawyer	834	" Five thousand dollars ! "
30149	30317	30134	30134	he	834	" Oh yes , to be sure , my dear ; now I recollect . To be sure to be sure your own five thousand dollars . But never will I touch one cent of your nice little fortune ; no , not to save my life . After all , I am not so gone in years but what I can build the mill again myself . The Lord hath spared my hands and eyes , and gifted me still with machinery . And Firm is a very handy lad , and can carry out a job pretty fairly , with better brains to stand over him , although it has not pleased the Lord to gift him with sense of machinery , like me . But that is all for the best , no doubt . If Ephraim had too much of brains , he might have contradicted me . And that I could never abide , God knows , from any green young jackanapes . "
30318	30333	30134	30134	he	834	" Oh , Uncle Sam , let me tell you something something very important ! "
30334	30446	30134	30134	he	834	" No , my dear , nothing more just now . It has done me good to have a little talk , and scared the blue somethings out of me . But just go and ask whatever is become of Firm . He was riled with them greasers . It was all I could do to keep the boy out of a difficulty with them . And if they camp any where nigh , it is like enough he may go hankerin ' after them . The grand march of intellect hathn't managed yet to march old heads upon young shoulders . And Firm might happen to go outside the law . "
30766	30786	30787	30787	he	169	" I may ' a said a little too much , my dear , about the badness of mankind , "
30799	30866	30787	30787	he	169	" all sayings of that sort is apt to go too far . I ought to have made more allowance for the times , which gets into a ticklish state , when a old man is put about with them . Never you pay no heed whatever to any harsh words I may have used . All that is a very bad thing for young folk . "
30867	30888	30889	30889	He	169	" But if they treated you badly , Uncle Sam , how can you think that they treated you well ? "
30915	31045	30908	30908	he	169	" Why , the smashing of the mill may have been a mercy , although in disguise to the present time of sight . It will send up the price of scantlings , and we was getting on too fast with them . By the time we have built up the mill again we shall have more orders than we know how to do with . When I come to reckon of it , to me it appears to be the reasonable thing to feel a lump of grief for the old mill , and then to set to and build a stronger one . Yes , that must be about the right thing to do . And we 'll have all the neighbors in when we lay foundations . "
31046	31072	30787	30787	he	169	" But what will be the good of it , Uncle Sam , when the new mill may at any time be washed away again ? "
31073	31080	31081	31081	he	169	" Never , at any time , "
31099	31179	31081	31081	he	169	" That little game can easily be stopped , for about fifty dollars , by opening down the bank toward the old track of the river . The biggest waterspout that ever came down from the mountains could never come anigh the mill , but go right down the valley . It hath been in my mind to do it often , and now that I see the need , I will . Firm and I will begin tomorrow . "
31180	31206	31282	31282	he	169	" But where is all the money to come from , Uncle Sam ? You said that all your friends had refused to help you . "
31207	31233	31282	31282	he	169	" Never mind , my dear . I will help myself . It wo n't be the first time , perhaps , in my life . "
31234	31263	31282	31282	he	169	" But supposing that I could help you , just some little ? Supposing that I had found the biggest lump of gold ever found in all California ? "
31324	31399	31309	31309	he	169	" It is gold , Uncle Sam , every bit of it gold here is a piece of it ; just look and as large , I am sure , as this table . And it may be as deep as this room , for all that one can judge to the contrary . Why , it stopped the big pile from coming to the top , when even you went down the river . "
31400	31412	31414	31415	the Sawyer	834	" Well , now , that explains a thing or two , "
31434	31487	31414	31415	the Sawyer	834	" Two things have puzzled me about that stump , and , indeed , I might say three things . Why did he take such a time to drive ? and why would he never stand up like a man ? and why would n't he go away when he ought to ? "
31488	31537	31309	31309	he	169	" Because he had the best of all reasons , Uncle Sam . He was anchored on his gold , as I have read in French , and he had a good right to be crooked about it , and no power could get him away from it . "
31538	31590	31309	31309	he	169	" Hush , my dear , hush ! It is not at all good for young people to let their minds run on so . But this gold looks very good indeed . Are you sure that it is a fair sample , and that there is any more of it ? "
31591	31628	31414	31415	the Sawyer	834	" How can you be so dreadfully provoking , Uncle Sam , when I tell you that I saw it with my own eyes ? And there must be at least half a ton of it . "
31629	31705	31309	31309	he	169	" Well , half a hundred - weight will be enough for me . And you shall have all the rest , my dear that is , if you will spare me a bit , Miss Remy . It all belongs to you by discovery , according to the diggers ' law . And your eyes are so bright about it , miss , that the whole of your heart must be running upon it . "
31706	31756	31309	31309	he	169	" Then you think me as bad as the rest of the world ! How I wish that I had never seen it ! It was only for you that I cared about it for you , for you ; and I will never touch a scrap of it . "
32275	32280	32282	32282	he	834	" Well , now ! "
32403	32416	32435	32436	Mr. Gundry	169	" Are you grieving for the skulk who has shot my Firm ? "
32474	32554	32580	32581	somebody else	1215	" Yes , like a girl , you are sorry for a man who has stained this earth , till his only atonement is to stain it with his blood . Captain Pedro , there you lie , shot , like a coward , through the back . I wish you were alive to taste my boots . Murderer of men and filthy ravisher of women , miscreant of God , how can I keep from trampling on you ? "
32946	32951	32953	32953	Martin	198	" Stow away that , "
32967	33045	32959	32959	he	198	" wait till the lad is dead , and then pipe up to your liking . I felt him try to kick while we carried him along . He come forth on a arrand of that sort , and he seem to ' a been disappointed . A very fine young chap I call him , for to try to do it still , howsomever his mind might be wandering . Missy , keep his head up . "
33109	33118	33120	33120	Martin	198	" I tell you he ai n't dead , "
33122	33219	33120	33120	Martin	198	" no more dead than I be . He feels the young gal 's hand below him , and I see him try to turn up his eyes . He has taken a very bad knock , no doubt , and trouble about his breathing . I seed a fellow scalped once , and shot through the heart ; but he came all round in about six months , and protected his head with a document . Firm , now , do n't you be a fool . I have had worse things in my family . "
33277	33283	33285	33285	Martin	198	" Keep him to that , "
33294	33327	33285	33285	Martin	198	" less fear of the life when the blood begins to run . Do n't move him , missy ; never mind your arm . It will be the saving of him . "
33934	34182	33915	33915	he	181	" Almighty Father of the living and the dead , I have lived long , and shall soon be dead , and my days have been full of trouble . But I never had such trouble as this here before , and I do n't think I ever shall get over it . I have sinned every day of my life , and not thought of Thee , but of victuals , and money , and stuff ; and nobody knows , but myself and Thou , all the little bad things inside of me . I cared a deal more to be respectable and get on with my business than to be prepared for kingdom come . And I have just been proud about the shooting of a villain , who might ' a gone free and repented . There is nobody left to me in my old age . Thou hast taken all of them . Wife , and son , and mill , and grandson , and my brother who robbed me the whole of it may have been for my good , but I have got no good out of it . Show me the way for a little time , O Lord , to make the best of it ; and teach me to bear it like a man , and not break down at this time of life . Thou knowest what is right . Please to do it . Amen . "
34650	34679	34645	34645	he	1276	" Colonel Gundry , let us have no more words . The true owner is your grandson . I will put it back where I took it from . "
34783	34787	34791	34791	he	1288	" Captain Pedro , "
35407	35413	35393	35394	the doctor	1276	" a building - up process "
35689	35891	35682	35682	Firm	179	" was stopped , the mountains were coming down upon us , as we always used to say when the snow - line stooped . In some seasons this is a sharp time of hurry , broken with storms , and capricious , while men have to slur in the driving weather tasks that should have been matured long since . But in other years the long descent into the depth of winter is taken not with a jump like that , but gently and softly and windingly , with a great many glimpses back at the summer , and a good deal of leaning on the arm of the sun . And so it was this time . The autumn and the winter for a fortnight stood looking quietly at each other . They had quite agreed to share the hours , to suit the arrangements of the sun . The nights were starry and fresh and brisk , without any touch of tartness ; and the days were sunny and soft and gentle , without any sense of languor . It was a lovely scene blue shadows gliding among golden light . The Sawyer came forth , and cried , "
35950	36501	35938	35938	I	0	" Then Firm came out to surprise him , and to please us all with the sight of himself . He steadied his steps with one great white hand upon his grandfather 's Sunday staff , and his clear blue eyes were trembling with a sense of gratitude and a fear of tears . And I stepped behind a red strawberry - tree , for my sense of respect for him almost made me sob . Then Jowler thought it high time to appear upon the scene , and convince us that he was not a dead dog yet . He had known tribulation , as his master had , and had found it a difficult thing to keep from the shadowy hunting ground of dogs who have lived a conscientious life . I had wondered at first what his reason could have been for not coming forward , according to his custom , to meet that troop of robbers . But his reason , alas ! was too cogent to himself , though nobody else in that dreadful time could pay any attention to him . The Rovers , well knowing poor Jowler 's repute , and declining the fair mode of testing it , had sent in advance a very crafty scout , a half - bred Indian , who knew as much about dogs as they could ever hope to know about themselves . This rogue approached faithful Jowler so we were told long afterward not in an upright way , but as if he had been a brother quadruped . And he took advantage of the dog 's unfeigned surprise and interest to accost him with a piece of kidney containing a powerful poison . According to all sound analogy , this should have stopped the dear fellow 's earthly tracks ; but his spirit was such that he simply went away to nurse himself up in retirement . Neither man nor dog can tell what agonies he suffered ; and doubtless his tortures of mind about duty unperformed were the worst of all . These things are out of human knowledge in its present unsympathetic state . Enough that poor Jowler came home at last , with his ribs all up and his tail very low . Like friends who have come together again , almost from the jaws of death , we sat in the sunny noon , and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves . The trees above us looked proud and cheerful , laying aside the mere frippery of leaves with a good grace and contented arms , and a surety of having quite enough next spring . Much of the fruity wealth of autumn still was clustering in our sight , heavily fetching the arched bough down to lessen the fall , when fall they must . And against the golden leaves of maple behind the unpretending roof a special wreath of blue shone like a climbing Ipomaea . But coming to examine this , one found it to be nothing more nor less than the smoke of the kitchen chimney , busy with a quiet roasting job . This shows how clear the air was ; but a thousand times as much could never tell how clear our spirits were . Nobody made any "
36504	36576	35938	35938	I	0	" or cut any frolicsome capers , or even said any thing exuberant . The steadfast brooding breed of England , which despises antics , was present in us all , and strengthened by a soil whose native growth is peril , chance , and marvel . And so we nodded at one another , and I ran over and courtesied to Uncle Sam , and he took me to him . "
36585	36601	36577	36577	You	1315	" he said , as he rose , and looked over my head at Firm . "
36664	36665	36647	36647	he	1317	" "
36675	36696	36668	36669	Uncle Sam	181	" I cried , desiring like a child to escape deep feeling , and fearing any strong words from Firm . "
36716	36717	36705	36705	I	0	" "
36750	36878	36739	36739	Jowler	197	" Firm , who had little faith in the nugget , but took it for a dream of mine , and had proved conclusively from his pillow that it could not exist in earnest , now with a gentle , satirical smile declared his anxiety to see it ; and I led him along by his better arm , faster , perhaps , than he ought to have walked . In a very few minutes we were at the place , and I ran eagerly to point it ; but behold , where the nugget had been , there was nothing except the white bed of the river ! The blue water flowed very softly on its way , without a gleam of gold to corrupt it . "
36888	36899	36739	36739	Jowler	197	" I exclaimed , in the saddest of sad dismay . "
36947	36948	36949	36949	You	0	" "
36959	36966	36949	36949	You	0	" Mr. Gundry answered , dryly ; "

37050	37054	37044	37044	I	0	" Firm observed . "
37083	37084	37075	37075	She	180	" "
37093	37104	37075	37075	She	180	" I cried , with no gratitude for his compliment . "
37156	37221	37137	37137	you	5024	" I assure you that for the moment I knew not whether I stood upon my feet or head , until I perceived an extraordinary grin on the Sawyer 's ample countenance ; but Firm was not in the secret yet , for he gazed at me with compassion , and Uncle Sam looked at us both as if he were balancing our abilities . "
37229	37235	37227	37227	missy	5067	" at last he said . "
37265	37318	37252	37253	a Christian	1074	" At a sign from me , the great dog dashed in , and scratched with all four feet at once , and made the valley echo with the ring of mighty barkings ; and in less than two minutes there shone the nugget , as yellow and as big as ever . "
37330	37341	37323	37323	I	0	" shouted Uncle Sam , like a school - boy . "
37415	37621	37404	37405	the Almighty	1332	" It certainly was not a little spot , though they all seemed to make so light of it which vexed me , because I had found it , and was as proud as if I had made it . Not by any means that the Sawyer was half as careless as he seemed to be ; he put on much of this for my sake , having very lofty principles , especially concerning the duty of the young . Young people were never to have small ideas , so far as he could help it , particularly upon such matters as Mammon , or the world , or fashion ; and not so very seldom he was obliged to catch himself up in his talking , when he chanced to be going on and forgetting that I , who required a higher vein of thought for my youth , was taking his words downright ; and I think that all this had a great deal to do with his treating all that gold in such an exemplary manner ; for if it had really mattered nothing , what made him go in the dark and shoot a great barrow - load of gravel over it ?
38831	38836	38837	38838	Suan Isco	165	" Palefaces eat gold , "
38850	38878	38848	38848	herself	165	" Dem eat , drink , die gold ; dem pull gold out of one other 's ears . Welly hope Mellican mans get enough gold now . "
38879	38889	38890	38890	I	0	" Do n't be sarcastic , now , Suan , "
38893	38903	38890	38890	I	0	" as if it were possible to have enough ! "
38904	38909	38911	38911	Firm	179	" For my part , "
38922	38993	38911	38911	Firm	179	" I wish it had never been found at all . As sure as I stand here , mischief will come of it . It will break up our household . I hope it will turn out a lump of quartz , gilt on the face , as those big nuggets do , ninety - nine out of a hundred . I have had no faith in it all along . "
38994	39006	39007	39007	I	0	" Because I found it , Mr. Firm , I suppose , "
39026	39046	38911	38911	Firm	179	" Perhaps if you had found it , Mr. Firm , you would have had great faith in it . "
39047	39056	39058	39059	all Firm	1375	" Ca n't say , ca n't say , "
39072	39088	39090	39091	the Sawyer	834	" Heave - ho ! heave - ho ! there , you sons of cooks ! "
39103	39182	39090	39091	the Sawyer	834	" I 've tackled ' un now . Just tighten up the belt , to see if he biteth centre - like . You ca n't lift ' un ! Lord bless ' ee , not you . It 'll take all I know to do that , I guess ; and Firm ai n't to lay no hand to it . Do n't you be in such a doggoned hurry . Hold hard , ca n't you ? "
39282	39295	39297	39298	Uncle Sam	181	" Hurrah ! what a whale ! How the tough ash bends ! "
39313	39341	39311	39311	himself	181	" Martin , lay your chest to it . We 'll grass him in two seconds . Californy never saw a sight like this , I reckon . "
39448	39456	39458	39459	the Sawyer	834	" Why , what ails the lad ? "
39465	39612	39458	39459	the Sawyer	834	" what harm hath the stone ever done to him ? To my mind , this here lump is a proof of the whole creation of the world , and who hath lived long enough to gainsay ? Here this lump hath lain , without changing color , since creation 's day ; here it is , as big and heavy as when the Lord laid hand to it . What good to argue agin such facts ? Supposin ' the world come out o ' nothing , with nobody to fetch it , or to say a word of orders , how ever could it ' a managed to get a lump of gold like this in it ? They clever fellers is too clever . Let 'em put all their heads together , and turn out a nugget , and I 'll believe them . "
39655	39660	39651	39651	he	181	" Well , well , "
39743	39843	39732	39732	he	181	" Five hundred and a half I used to lift to the height of my knee - cap easily ; I may ' a fallen off now a hundred - weight with years , and strings in my back , and rheumatics ; but this here little toad is a clear hundredweight out and beyond my heftage . If there 's a pound here , there 's not an ounce under six hundred - weight , I 'll lay a thousand dollars . Miss Rema , give a name to him . All the thundering nuggets has thundering names . "
39844	39855	39856	39856	I	0	" Then this shall be called ' Uncle Sam , ' "
39859	39871	39856	39856	I	0	" because he is the largest and the best of all . "
39872	39879	39881	39881	Martin	198	" It shall stand , miss , "
39897	39985	39732	39732	he	181	" You could not have given it a finer name , miss , if you had considered for a century . Uncle Sam is the name of our glorious race , from the kindness of our natur ' . Every body 's uncle we are now , in vartue of superior knowledge , and freedom , and giving of general advice , and stickin ' to all the world , or all the good of it . Darned if old Sam are n't the front of creation ! "
39986	39991	39993	39994	the Sawyer	834	" Well , well , "
39996	40053	39993	39994	the Sawyer	834	" let us call it ' Uncle Sam , ' if the dear young lady likes it ; it would be bad luck to change the name ; but , for all that , we must look uncommon sharp , or some of our glorious race will come and steal it afore we unbutton our eyes . "
40054	40057	40059	40059	Martin	198	" Pooh ! "
41057	41065	41067	41067	Firm	215	" What a lovely dear you are ! "
41079	41099	41071	41071	he	215	" I had no idea that you would have finished your dinner so soon as this , Mr. Firm . "
41100	41122	41071	41071	he	215	" And you did not want me . You are vexed to see me . Tell the truth , Miss Rema . "
41123	41130	41131	41131	I	0	" I always tell the truth , "
41134	41155	41131	41131	I	0	" and I did not want to be disturbed just now . I have so many things to think of . "
41156	41176	41071	41071	he	215	" And not me among them . Oh no , of course you never think of me , Erema . "
41177	41188	41189	41189	I	0	" It is very unkind of you to say that , "
41205	41245	41189	41189	I	0	" And it is not true , I assure you , Firm . Whenever I have thought of dear Uncle Sam , I very often go on to think of you , because he is so fond of you . "
41246	41266	41071	41071	he	215	" But not for my own sake , Erema ; you never think of me for my own sake . "
41267	41306	41189	41189	I	0	" But yes , I do , I assure you , Mr. Firm ; I do greatly . There is scarcely a day that I do not remember how hungry you are , and I think of you . "
41307	41310	41312	41312	Firm	213	" Tush ! "
41319	41360	41312	41312	Firm	213	" Even for a moment that does not in any way express my meaning . My mind is very much above all eating when it dwells upon you , Erema . I have always been fond of you , Erema . "
41361	41372	41373	41373	I	0	" You have always been good to me , Firm , "
41387	41424	41373	41373	I	0	" After your grandfather , and Suan Isco , and Jowler , I think that I like you best of almost any body left to me . And you know that I never forget your slippers . "
41425	41458	41312	41312	Firm	213	" Erema , you drive me almost wild by never understanding me . Now will you just listen to a little common - sense ? You know that I am not romantic . "
41459	41479	41373	41373	I	0	" Yes , Firm ; yes , I know that you never did any thing wrong in any way . "
41480	41506	41507	41507	He	1425	" You would like me better if I did . What an extraordinary thing it is ! Oh , Erema , I beg your pardon . "
41585	41589	41590	41590	he	213	" My darling , "
41593	41624	41590	41590	he	213	" you are very dear to me dearer than all the world besides . I will not worry you any more . Only say that you do not hate me . "
41625	41654	41563	41563	I	0	" How could I ? How could any body ? Now let us go in and attend to Uncle Sam . He thinks of every body before himself . "
41655	41673	41590	41590	he	213	" And I think of every body after myself . Is that what you mean , Erema ? "
41674	41722	41590	41590	he	213	" To be sure ! if you like . You may put any meaning on my words that you think proper . I am accustomed to things of that sort , and I pay no attention whatever , when I am perfectly certain that I am right . "
41723	41727	41729	41729	Firm	213	" I see , "
41755	41805	41590	41590	he	213	" I see how it is ; Miss Rema is always perfectly certain that she is right , and the whole of the rest of the world quite wrong . Well , after all , there is nothing like holding a first - rate opinion of one 's self . "
41806	41816	41817	41817	I	0	" You are not what I thought of you , "
41834	41862	41817	41817	I	0	" If you wish to say any thing more , please to leave it until you recover your temper . I am not quite accustomed to rudeness . "

Such a distinguished and travelled person can hardly be afflicted with mauvaise honte . Why does she not rush to embrace me ? All the French people do ; and she is so French ! Let me see her , for the sake of my accent . "
44399	44410	44412	44413	Uncle Sam	181	" We do n't want no French here , ma'am , "
44420	44463	44412	44413	Uncle Sam	181	" and the young lady wants no Doctor Hunt . Her health is as good as your own , and you never catch no French actions from her . If she wanted to see you , she would ' a come down . "
44464	44524	44412	44413	Uncle Sam	181	" Oh , now , this is too barbarous ! Colonel Gundry , you are the most tyrannous man ; in your own dominions an autocrat . Every body says so , but I never would believe it . Oh , do n't let me go away with that impression . And you do look so good - natured ! "
44525	44543	44547	44548	the Sawyer	168	" And so I mean to look , Miss Penny , until you are out of sight . "
44633	44645	44646	44646	he	168	" I would n't ' a spoke to her so course , "
44663	44731	44646	44646	he	168	" if she was n't herself so extra particular , gild me , and sky - blue my mouldings fine . How my mother would ' a stared at the sight of such a gal ! Keep free of her , my lad , keep free of her . But no harm to put her on , to keep our missy alive and awake , my boy . "
45123	45130	45131	45131	he	177	" And so , Miss Erema , "
45157	45177	45131	45131	he	177	" I have your best wishes , then , have I , for a happy marriage with Miss Sylvester ? "
45233	45240	45241	45241	I	0	" You have my best wishes , "
45246	45270	45241	45241	I	0	" for any state of life to which you may be called . You could scarcely expect any less of me than that . "
45271	45291	45292	45292	Firm	179	" How kind you are ! But do you really wish that I should marry old Sylvester 's girl ? "
45310	45319	45306	45306	he	179	" Do you wish to see me hanged ? "
45355	45379	45395	45395	he	179	" No , I can not say , Firm , that I wish it at all ; unless your heart is set on it "
45380	45394	45395	45395	he	179	" Do n't you know , then , where my heart is set ? "
45417	45536	45395	45395	he	179	" Why will you feign not to know , Erema , who is the only one I can ever think of twice ? Above me , I know , in every possible way birth and education and mind and appearance , and now far above me in money as well . But what are all these things ? Try to think if only you could like me . Liking gets over every thing , and without it nothing is any thing . Why do I like you so , Erema ? Is it because of your birth , and teaching , and manners , and sweet looks , and all that , or even because of your troubles ? "
45537	45568	45395	45395	he	179	" How can I tell , Firm how can I tell ? Perhaps it is just because of myself . And why do you do it at all , Firm ? "
45569	45608	45395	45395	he	179	" Ah , why do I do it ? How I wish I knew ! Perhaps then I might cure it . To begin with , what is there , after all , so very wonderful about you ? "
45609	45639	45395	45395	he	179	" Oh , nothing , I should hope . Most surely nothing . It would grieve me to be at all wonderful . That I leave for American ladies . "
45640	45698	45395	45395	he	179	" Now you do n't understand me . I mean , of course , that you are wonderfully good and kind and clever ; and your eyes , I am sure , and your lips and smile , and all your other features there is nothing about them that can be called any thing else but wonderful . "
45699	45718	45395	45395	he	179	" Now , Firm , how exceedingly foolish you are ! I did hope that you knew better . "
45719	45820	45821	45821	He	1516	" Erema , I never shall know better . I never can swerve or change , if I live to be a hundred and fifty . You think me presumptuous , no doubt , from what you are brought up to . And you are so young that to seek to bind you , even if you loved me , would be an unmanly thing . But now you are old enough , and you know your own mind surely well enough , just to say whether you feel as if you could ever love me as I love you . "
45884	45888	45889	45889	I	0	" Dear Firm , "
45905	46127	45893	45893	I	0	" I like and admire you very much ; and by - and - by by - and - by , I might , that is , if you did not hurry me . Of all the obstacles you have mentioned , none is worth considering . I am nothing but a poor castaway , owing my life to Uncle Sam and you . But one thing there is which could never be got over , even if I felt as you feel toward me . Never can I think of little matters , or of turning my thoughts to to any such things as you speak of , as long as a vile reproach and wicked imputation lies on me . And before even that , I have to think of my father , who gave his life for me . Firm , I have been here too long delaying , and wasting my time in trifles . I ought to have been in Europe long ago . If I am old enough for what you talk of , I am old enough to do my duty . If I am old enough for love , as it is called , I am old enough for hate . I have more to do with hate than love , I think . "
46128	46131	46133	46133	Firm	179	" Erema , "
46135	46162	46133	46133	Firm	179	" what a puzzle you are ! I never even dreamed that you could be so fierce . You are enough to frighten Uncle Sam himself . "
46163	46188	46232	46232	him	179	" If I frighten you , Firm , that is quite enough . You see now how vain it is to say another word . "
46189	46210	46232	46232	him	179	" I do not see any thing of the sort . Come back , and look at me quite calmly . "
46326	46330	46331	46331	he	179	" My darling , "
46357	46433	46331	46331	he	179	" you are not fit for the stormy life to which your high spirit is devoting you . You have not the hardness and bitterness of mind , the cold self - possession and contempt of others , the power of dissembling and the iron will in a word , the fundamental nastiness , without which you never could get through such a job . Why , you can not be contemptuous even to me ! "
46434	46450	46352	46352	his	179	" I should hope not . I should earn your contempt , if I could . "
46451	46642	46352	46352	his	179	" There , you are ready to cry at the thought . Erema , do not mistake yourself . Remember that your father would never have wished it would have given his life ten thousand times over to prevent it . Why did he bring you to this remote , inaccessible part of the world except to save you from further thought of evil ? He knew that we listen to no rumors here , no social scandals , or malignant lies ; but we value people as we find them . He meant this to be a haven for you ; and so it shall be if you will only rest ; and you shall be the queen of it . Instead of redressing his memory now , you would only distress his spirit . What does he care for the world 's gossip now ? But he does care for your happiness . I am not old enough to tell you things as I should like to tell them . I wish I could how I wish I could ! It would make all the difference to me . "
46643	46738	46331	46331	he	179	" It would make no difference , Firm , to me ; because I should know it was selfishness . Not selfishness of yours , I mean , for you never could be selfish ; but the vilest selfishness of mine , the same as starved my father . You can not see things as I see them , or else you would not talk so . When you know that a thing is right , you do it . Can you tell me otherwise ? If you did , I should despise you . "
46739	46760	46331	46331	he	179	" If you put it so , I can say no more . You will leave us forever , Erema ? "
46761	46794	46352	46352	his	179	" No , not forever . If the good God wills it , I will come back when my work is done . Forgive me , dear Firm , and forget me . "
46795	46815	46331	46331	he	179	" There is nothing to forgive , Erema ; but a great deal I never can hope to forgot . "
47172	47191	47192	47192	he	1529	" How young massa 's poor nose dis long time ? How him feel , spose now again ? "
47200	47231	47192	47192	he	1529	" Young massa ebber able take a pinch of good snuff ? He ! he ! missy berry heavy den ? Missy no learn to dance de nose polka den ? "
47232	47240	47241	47241	I	0	" What on earth does he mean ? "

48128	48143	48117	48117	he	179	" but she scarcely seems worth looking at , compared compared with certain others . "

49432	49489	49429	49430	the Major	1607	" robbed , not fifteen feet below us . Robbed , ladies and gentlemen , of the most cherished treasures of her life , the portrait of her only son , the savings of a life of honest toil , her poor dead husband 's tobacco - box , and a fine cut of Colorado cheese .

49490	49500	49502	49504	the poor woman	1635	" Ten pounds and a quarter , gospel true ! "

49543	49552	49539	49541	another sleepy man	1637	" what have we to do with it ? "
49553	49562	49564	49565	the Major	1607	" I will neither go to the captain , "
49570	49591	49564	49565	the Major	1607	" nor yet to the devil , as a fellow who is not a man has dared to suggest to me "
49592	49602	49603	49606	the poor old woman	1639	" All tied in my own pocket - handkerchief ! "
49611	49662	49603	49606	the poor old woman	1639	" the one with the three - cornered spots upon ' un . Only two have I ever owned in all my life , and this was the very best of 'em . Oh dear ! oh dear ! that ever I should come to this exposing of my things ! "
49663	49733	49564	49565	the Major	1607	" Madam , you shall have justice done , as sure as my name is Hockin . Gentlemen and ladies , if you are not all asleep , how would you like to be treated so ? Because the weather is a trifle warm , there you lie like a parcel of Mexicans . If any body picked your pockets , would you have life enough to roll over ? "
49734	49742	49744	49747	a fat young Briton	1640	" I do n't think I should , "
49757	49787	49744	49747	a fat young Briton	1640	" but for a poor woman I can stand upright . Major Hockin , here is a guinea for her . Perhaps more of us will give a trifle . "
49788	49792	49794	49795	the Major	1607	" Well done ! "
49797	49825	49794	49795	the Major	1607	" but not so much as that . Let us first ascertain all the rights of the case . Perhaps half a crown apiece would reach it . "
50034	50042	50030	50031	his wife	590	" the Major could not help it . "
50086	50106	50081	50082	the Major	1607	" Ventilate it , ventilate the subject , my dear Sir ; bring public opinion to bear on it . "
50133	50136	50115	50116	her husband	659	" ventilation . "
50671	50675	50646	50647	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Miss Wood . "
50710	50714	50758	50758	I	0	" Miss Wood , "
50766	50781	50782	50783	Miss Wood	229	" but still the stern fact stared me in the face I must go as "
50785	50908	50782	50783	Miss Wood	229	" or not go at all . Upon this Major Hockin had insisted ; and even Colonel Gundry could not move him from his resolution . Uncle Sam had done his utmost , as was said before , to stop me from wishing to go at all ; but when he found my whole heart bent upon it , and even my soul imperiled by the sense of neglecting life 's chief duty , his own stern sense of right came in and sided with my prayers to him . And so it was that he let me go , with pity for my youth and sex , but a knowledge that I was in good hands , and an inborn , perhaps "
50910	51132	50782	50783	Miss Wood	229	" faith , that the Lord of all right would see to me . The Major , on the other hand , had none of this . He differed from Uncle Sam as much as a trim - cut and highly cultured garden tree differs from a great spreading king of the woods . He was not without a strict sense of religion , especially when he had to march men to church ; and he never even used a bad word , except when wicked facts compelled him . When properly let alone , and allowed to nurse his own opinions , he had a respectable idea that all things were certain to be ordered for the best ; but nothing enraged him so much as to tell him that when things went against him , or even against his predictions . It was lucky for me , then , that Major Hockin had taken a most adverse view of my case . He formed his opinions with the greatest haste , and with the greatest perseverance stuck to them ; for he was the most generous of mankind , if generous means one quite full of his genus . And in my little case he had made up his mind that the whole of the facts were against me . "
51134	51634	50782	50783	Miss Wood	229	" was his favorite word , and one which he always used with great effect , for nobody knows very well what it means , as it does not belong to our language . And so when he said that the facts were against me , who was there to answer that facts are not truth ? This fast - set conclusion of his was known to me not through himself , but through his wife . For I could not yet bring myself to speak of the things that lay close at my heart to him , though I knew that he must be aware of them . And he , like a gentleman , left me to begin . I could often see that he was ready and quite eager to give me the benefit of his opinion , which would only have turned me against him , and irritated him , perhaps , with me . And having no home in England , or , indeed , I might say , any where , I was to live with the Major and his wife , supposing that they could arrange it so , until I should discover relatives . We had a long and stormy voyage , although we set sail so fairly ; and I thought that we never should round Cape Horn in the teeth of the furious northeast winds ; and after that we lay becalmed , I have no idea in what latitude , though the passengers now talked quite like seamen , at least till the sea got up again . However , at last we made the English Channel , in the dreary days of November , and after more peril there than any where else , we were safely docked at Southampton . Here the Major was met by two dutiful daughters , bringing their husbands and children , and I saw more of family life at a distance than had fallen to my lot to observe before ; and although there were many little jars and brawls and cuts at one another , I was sadly inclined to wish sometimes for some brothers and sisters to quarrel with . But having none to quarrel with , and none to love , except good Mrs. Hockin , who went away by train immediately , I spent such a wretched time in that town that I longed to be back in the Bridal Veil in the very worst of weather . The ooze of the shore and the reek of the water , and the dreary flatness of the land around after the glorious heaven - clad heights , which made me ashamed of littleness , also the rough , stupid stare of the men , when I went about as an American lady may freely do in America , and the sharpness of every body 's voice instead of the genial tones which those who can not produce them call "
51637	51850	51852	51852	my	0	" but which from a higher view are cordial taken one after other , or all together , these things made me think , in the first flush of thought , that England was not a nice country . After a little while I found that I had been a great deal too quick , as foreigners are with things which require quiet comprehension . For instance , I was annoyed at having a stupid woman put over me , as if I could not mind myself a cook , or a nurse , or housekeeper , or something very useful in the Hockin family , but to me a mere incumbrance , and as I thought in my wrath sometimes a spy . What was I likely to do , or what was any one likely to do to me , in a thoroughly civilized country , that I could not even stay in private lodgings , where I had a great deal to think of , without this dull creature being forced upon me ? But the Major so ordered it , and I gave in . There I must have staid for the slowest three mouths ever passed without slow starvation finishing my growth , but not knowing how to "
51855	51944	51945	51946	Miss Wood	229	" as I was told to do . Major Hockin came down once or twice to see me , and though I did not like him , yet it was almost enough to make me do so to see a little liveliness . But I could not and would not put up with a frightful German baron of music , with a polished card like a toast - rack , whom the Major tried to impress on me . As if I could stop to take music lessons ! "
51948	51967	51945	51946	Miss Wood	229	" said Major Hockin , in his strongest manner , the last time he came to see me , "

52093	52097	52090	52091	Miss Wood	229	" I answered ; "

52314	52322	52324	52325	Major Hockin	223	" There , there , my dear ! "
52334	52412	52324	52325	Major Hockin	223	" Pretty fit you are to combat with the world , and defy the world , and brave the world , and abolish the world or at least the world 's opinion ! ' Bo to a goose , ' you can say , my dear ; but no ' bo ' to a gander . No , no ; do quietly what I advise by - the - bye , you have never asked my advice . "
52447	52469	52433	52433	I	0	" Oh , why have you never offered it to me ? You knew that I never could ask for it . "
52522	52525	52526	52526	he	1607	" Erema , "
52529	52568	52526	52526	he	1607	" you are a dear good girl , though sadly , sadly romantic . I had no idea that you had so much sense . I will talk with you , Erema , when we both have leisure . "
52569	52579	52580	52580	I	0	" I am quite at leisure , Major Hockin , "
52583	52593	52526	52526	he	1607	" and only too happy to listen to you . "
52594	52662	52526	52526	he	1607	" Yes , yes , I dare say . You are in lodgings . You can do exactly as you please . But I have a basin of ox - tail soup , a cutlet , and a woodcock waiting for me at the Cosmopolitan Hotel . Bless me ! I am five minutes late already . I will come and have a talk with you afterward . "
52663	52667	52668	52668	I	0	" Thank you , "
52671	52687	52668	52668	I	0	" we had better leave it . It seems of no importance , compared compared with "

54963	54982	54957	54959	good Mrs. Hockin	228	" it is such an odious word ; and where in the world is it to come from ? "
54983	55343	54866	54867	Major Hockin	223	" Leave that to me . When I was a boy my favorite copy in my copy - book was , ' Where there 's a will there 's a way . ' Miss Wood , what is your opinion ? But wait , you must have time to understand the subject . First we bring a railway always the first step ; why , the line is already made for it by the course of the old river , and the distance from Newport three miles and a half . It ought not to cost quite 200 pounds a mile the mere outlay for rails and sleepers . The land is all mine , and and of course other landed proprietors ' . Very well : these would all unite , of course ; so that not a farthing need be paid for land , which is the best half of the battle . We have the station here not too near my house ; that would never do ; I could not bear the noise but in a fine central place where nobody on earth could object to it lively , and close at hand for all of them . Unluckily I was just too late . We have lost a Parliamentary year through that execrable calm you remember all about it . Otherwise we would have had Billy Puff stabled at Bruntsea by the first of May. But never mind ; we shall do it all the better and cheaper by taking our time about it . Very well : we have the railway opened and the trade of the place developed . We build a fine terrace of elegant villas , a crescent also , and a large hotel replete with every luxury ; and we form the finest sea - parade in England by simply assisting nature . Half London comes down here to bathe , to catch shrimps , to flirt , and to do the rest of it . We become a select , salubrious , influential , and yet economical place ; and then what do we do , Mrs. Hockin ? "
55344	55364	54866	54867	Major Hockin	223	" My dear , how can I tell ? But I hope that we should rest and be thankful . "
55365	55387	54957	54959	good Mrs. Hockin	228	" Not a bit of it . I should hope not , indeed . Erema , what do we do then ? "
55388	55410	54866	54867	Major Hockin	223	" It is useless to ask me . Well , then , perhaps you set up a handsome saw - mill ! "
55411	55476	54866	54867	Major Hockin	223	" A saw - mill ! What a notion of Paradise ! No ; this is what we do but remember that I speak in the strictest confidence ; dishonest antagonism might arise , if we ventilated our ideas too soon Mrs. Hockin and Miss Wood , we demand the restoration of our river ! the return of our river to its ancient course . "
55477	55481	55483	55484	his wife	590	" I see , "
55486	55512	55483	55484	his wife	590	" oh , how grand that would be ! and how beautiful from our windows ! That really , now , is a noble thought ! "
55513	55558	54866	54867	Major Hockin	223	" A just one simply a just one . Justice ought not to be noble , my dear , however rare it may be . Generosity , magnanimity , heroism , and so on those are the things we call noble , my dear . "
55559	55617	54866	54867	Major Hockin	223	" And the founding of cities . Oh , my dear , I remember , when I was at school , it was always said , in what we called our histories , that the founders of cities had honors paid them , and altars built , and divinities done , and holidays held in their honor . "
55618	55624	55626	55627	the Major	1607	" To that I object , "
55631	55807	55626	55627	the Major	1607	" If I founded fifty cities , I would never allow one holiday . The Sabbath is enough ; one day in seven fifteen per cent , of one 's whole time ; and twenty per cent , of your Sunday goes in church . Very right , of course , and loyal , and truly edifying Mrs. Hockin 's father was a clergyman , Miss Wood ; and the last thing I would ever allow on my manor would be a Dissenting chapel ; but still I will have no new churches here , and a man who might go against me . They all want to pick their own religious views , instead of reflecting who supports them ! It never used to be so ; and such things shall never occur on my manor . A good hotel , attendance included , and a sound and moderate table d'hote ; but no church , with a popish bag sent round , and money to pay , ' without anything to eat . ' "
55808	55815	55817	55818	Mrs. Hockin	228	" My dear ! my dear ! "
55820	55849	55817	55818	Mrs. Hockin	228	" I never like you to talk like that . You quite forget who my father was , and your own second son such a very sound priest ! "
55850	55861	55863	55864	the Major	1607	" A priest ! Do n't let him come here , "
55866	55923	55863	55864	the Major	1607	" or I 'll let him know what tonsure is , and read him the order of Melchisedec . A priest ! After going round the world three times , to come home and be hailed as the father of a priest ! Do n't let him come near me , or I 'll sacrifice him . "
55924	55936	55937	55939	his good wife	1851	" Now , Major , you are very proud of him , "
55948	55986	55943	55943	he	1607	" How could he help taking orders when he was under orders to do so ? And his views are sound to the last degree , most strictly correct and practical at least except as to celibacy . "
55987	56010	55863	55864	the Major	1607	" He holds that his own mother ought never to have been born ! Miss Wood , do you call that practical ? "
56011	56020	56021	56021	I	0	" I have no acquaintance with such things , "
56024	56072	56021	56021	I	0	" we had none of them in California . But is it practical , Major Hockin of course you know best in your engineering I mean , would it not require something like a tunnel for the river and the railway to run on the same ground ? "
56073	56108	56150	56151	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Why , bless me ! That seems to have escaped my notice . You have not been with old Uncle Sam for nothing . We shall have to appoint you our chief engineer . "
56398	56421	56394	56395	the Major	1607	" To be sure . Yes , yes . Let them come to good meat , and then off with their heads . "
56537	56550	56552	56553	the Major	1607	" Go to London , indeed ! Go to London by yourself ! "
56581	56619	56566	56566	I	0	" Mary , my dear , when you have done out there , will you come in and reason if you can with Miss Wood . She vows that she is going to London , all alone . "
56620	56636	56648	56648	she	228	" Oh , Major Hockin oh , Nicholas dear , such a thing has happened ! "
56655	56693	56648	56648	she	228	" You know that they have only had three bushels , or , at any rate , not more than five , almost ever since they came . Erema , you know as well as I do . "
56694	56713	56715	56716	the Major	1607	" Seven and three - quarter bushels of barley , at five and ninepence a bushel , Mary , "
56725	56736	56715	56716	the Major	1607	" besides Indian corn , chopped meat , and potatoes . "
56737	56744	56745	56745	I	0	" And fourteen pounds of paddy , "
56755	56778	56745	56745	I	0	" not to mention a cake of graves , three sacks of brewers ' grains , and then I forget what next . "
56779	56854	56648	56648	she	228	" You are too bad , all of you . Erema , I never thought you would turn against me so . And you made me get nearly all of it . But please to look here . What do you call this ? Is this no reward ? Is this not enough ? Major , if you please , what do you call this ? What a pity you have had your breakfast ! "
56855	56909	56715	56716	the Major	1607	" A blessing if this was to be my breakfast . I call that , my dear , the very smallest egg I have seen since I took sparrows ' nests . No wonder they sell them at twelve a penny . I congratulate you upon your first egg , my dear Mary . "
56910	56918	56920	56921	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Well , I do n't care , "
56932	56984	56920	56921	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Small beginnings make large endings ; and an egg must be always small at one end . You scorn my first egg , and Erema should have had it if she had been good . But she was very wicked , and I know not what to do with it . "
56985	56989	56991	56992	the Major	1607	" Blow it ! "
56994	57081	57082	57082	he	1607	" I mean no harm , ladies . I never use low language . What I mean is , make a pinhole at each end , give a puff , and away goes two pennyworth , and you have a cabinet specimen , which your egg is quite fitted by its cost to be . But now , Mary , talk to Miss Wood , if you please . It is useless for me to say any thing , and I have three appointments in the town "
57086	57089	57082	57082	he	1607	" the town "
57091	57194	57204	57205	Mrs. Hockin	228	" three appointments , if not four ; yes , I may certainly say four . Talk to Miss Wood , my dear , if you please . She wants to go to London , which would be absurd . Ladies seem to enter into ladies ' logic . They seem to be able to appreciate it better , to see all the turns , and the ins and outs , which no man has intellect enough to see , or at least to make head or tail of . Good - by for the present ; I had better be off . "
57195	57202	57204	57205	Mrs. Hockin	228	" I should think you had , "
57273	57285	57286	57287	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Now come and talk quietly to me , my dear , "
57304	57380	57286	57287	Mrs. Hockin	228	" I have noticed how restless you are , and devoid of all healthy interest in any thing . ' Listless ' is the word . ' Listless ' is exactly what I mean , Erema . When I was at your time of life , I could never have gone about caring for nothing . I wonder that you knew that I even had a fowl ; much more how much they had eaten ! "
57381	57400	57401	57401	I	0	" I really do try to do all I can , and that is a proof of it , "
57404	57425	57401	57401	I	0	" I am not quite so listless as you think . But those things do seem so little to me . "
57426	57571	57286	57287	Mrs. Hockin	228	" My dear , if you were happy , they would seem quite large , as , after all the anxieties of my life , I am able now to think them . It is a power to be thankful for , or , at least , I often think so . Look at my husband ! He has outlived and outlasted more trouble than any one but myself could reckon up to him ; and yet he is as brisk , as full of life , as ready to begin a new thing to - morrow when , at our age , there may be no to - morrow , except in that better world , my dear , of which it is high time for him and me to think , as I truly hope we may spare the time to do . "
57572	57581	57582	57582	I	0	" Oh , do n't talk like that , "
57585	57641	57582	57582	I	0	" Please , Mrs. Hockin , to talk of your hens and chicks at least there will be chicks by - and - by . I am almost sure there will , if you only persevere . It seems unfair to set our minds on any other world till justice has been done in this . "
57642	57709	57286	57287	Mrs. Hockin	228	" You are very young , my child , or you would know that in that case we never should think of it at all . But I do n't want to preach you a sermon , Erema , even if I could do so . I only just want you to tell me what you think , what good you imagine that you can do . "
57710	57738	57772	57772	she	1877	" It is no imagination . I am sure that I can right my father 's wrongs . And I never shall rest till I do so . "
57739	57751	57752	57752	she	1877	" Are you sure that there is any wrong to right ? "
57783	57794	57795	57795	I	0	" Oh , if you had only once seen him , "
57798	57853	57772	57772	she	1877	" without any exaggeration , you would have been satisfied at once . That he could ever have done any harm was impossible utterly impossible . I am not as I was . I can listen to almost any thing now quite calmly . But never let me hear such a wicked thing again . "
57854	57929	57772	57772	she	1877	" You must not go on like that , Erema , unless you wish to lose all your friends . No one can help being sorry for you . Very few girls have been placed as you are . I am sure when I think of my own daughters I can never be too thankful . But the very first thing you have to learn , above all things , is to control yourself . "
57930	57941	57942	57942	I	0	" I know it I know it , of course , "
57945	57974	57942	57942	I	0	" and I keep on trying my very best . I am thoroughly ashamed of what I said , and I hope you will try to forgive me . "
57975	58043	57772	57772	she	1877	" A very slight exertion is enough for that . But now , my dear , what I want to know is this and you will excuse me if I ask too much what good do you expect to get by going thus to London ? Have you any friend there , any body to trust , any thing settled as to what you are to do ? "
58044	58056	57942	57942	I	0	" Yes , every thing is settled in my own mind , "
58063	58133	57942	57942	I	0	" I have the address of a very good woman , found among my father 's papers , who nursed his children and understood his nature , and always kept her faith in him . There must be a great many more who do the same , and she will be sure to know them and introduce me to them ; and I shall be guided by their advice . "
58134	58156	57772	57772	she	1877	" But suppose that this excellent woman is dead , or not to be found , or has changed her opinion ? "
58157	58248	57772	57772	she	1877	" Her opinion she never could change . But if she is not to be found , I shall find her husband , or her children , or somebody ; and besides that , I have a hundred things to do . I have the address of the agent through whom my father drew his income , though Uncle Sam let me know as little as he could . And I know who his bankers were when he had a bank , and he may have left important papers there . "
58249	58295	57942	57942	I	0	" Come , that looks a little more sensible , my dear ; bankers may always be relied upon . And there may be some valuable plate , Erema . But why not let the Major go with you ? His advice is so invaluable . "
58296	58361	57772	57772	she	1877	" I know that it is , in all ordinary things . But I can not have him now , for a very simple reason . He has made up his mind about my dear father horribly , horribly ; I ca n't speak of it . And he never changes his mind ; and sometimes when I look at him I hate him . "
58362	58422	57772	57772	she	1877	" Erema , you are quite a violent girl , although you so seldom show it . Is the whole world divided , then , into two camps those who think as you wish and those who are led by their judgment to think otherwise ? And are you to hate all who do not think as you wish ? "
58423	58433	58434	58434	I	0	" No , because I do not hate you , "
58437	58484	58434	58434	I	0	" I love you , though you do not think as I wish . But that is only because you think your husband must be right of course . But I can not like those who have made up their minds according to their own coldness . "
58485	58513	57772	57772	she	1877	" Major Hockin is not cold at all . On the contrary , he is a warm - hearted man I might almost say hot - hearted . "
58514	58540	57772	57772	she	1877	" Yes , I know he is . And that makes it ten times worse . He takes up every body 's case but mine . "
58541	58553	57772	57772	she	1877	" Sad as it is , you almost make me smile , "
58560	58619	57772	57772	she	1877	" and yet it must be very bitter for you , knowing how just and kind my husband is . I am sure that you will give him credit for at least desiring to take your part . And doing so , at least you might let him go with you , if only as a good protection . "
58620	58687	57772	57772	she	1877	" I have no fear of any one ; and I might take him into society that he would not like . In a good cause he would go any where , I know . But in my cause , of course he would be scrupulous . Your kindness I always can rely upon , and I hope in the end to earn his as well . "
58688	58722	57772	57772	she	1877	" My dear , he has never been unkind to you . I am certain that you never can say that of him . Major Hockin unkind to a poor girl like you ! "
58723	58737	58738	58738	I	0	" The last thing I wish to claim is any body 's pity , "
58760	58831	58755	58755	my	0	" If people choose to pity me , they are very good , and I am not at all offended , because because they can not help it , perhaps , from not knowing any thing about me . I have nothing whatever to be pitied for , except that I have lost my father , and have nobody left to care for me , except Uncle Sam in America . "
58832	58852	58854	58855	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Your Uncle Sam , as you call him , seems to be a very wonderful man , Erema , "
58870	59008	58854	58855	Mrs. Hockin	228	" I never saw him a great loss on my part . But the Major went up to meet him somewhere , and came home with the stock of his best tie broken , and two buttons gone from his waistcoat . Does Uncle Sam make people laugh so much ? or is it that he has some extraordinary gift of inducing people to taste whiskey ? My husband is a very most abstemious man , as you must be well aware , Miss Wood , or we never should have been as we are , I am sure . But , for the first time in all my life , I doubted his discretion on the following day , when he had what shall I say ? when he had been exchanging sentiments with Uncle Sam . "
59009	59020	59021	59021	I	0	" Uncle Sam never takes too much in any way , "
59028	59067	59021	59021	I	0	" he knows what he ought to take , and then he stops . Do you think that it may have been his ' sentiments , ' perhaps , that were too strong and large for the Major ? "
59068	59071	59073	59074	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Erema ! "
59096	59153	59073	59074	Mrs. Hockin	228	" if you can talk politics at eighteen , you are quite fit to go any where . I have heard a great deal of American ladies , and seen not a little of them , as you know . But I thought that you called yourself an English girl , and insisted particularly upon it . "
59154	59219	59021	59021	I	0	" Yes , that I do ; and I have good reason . I am born of an old English family , and I hope to be no disgrace to it . But being brought up in a number of ways , as I have been without thinking of it , and being quite different from the fashionable girls Major Hockin likes to walk with "
59220	59233	59021	59021	I	0	" My dear , he never walks with any body but myself ! "
59234	59265	59073	59074	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Oh yes , I remember ! I was thinking of the deck . There are no fashionable girls here yet . Till the terrace is built , and the esplanade "
59266	59285	59021	59021	I	0	" There shall be neither terrace nor esplanade if the Major is to do such things upon them . "
59286	59295	59296	59296	I	0	" I am sure that he never would , "
59299	59349	59296	59296	I	0	" it was only their dresses that he liked at all , and that very , to my mind , extraordinary style , as well as unbecoming . You know what I mean , Mrs. Hockin , that wonderful what shall I call it ? way of looping up . "
59350	59415	59021	59021	I	0	" Call me ' Aunt Mary , ' my dear , as you did when the waves were so dreadful . You mean that hideous Mexican poncho , as they called it , stuck up here , and going down there . Erema , what observation you have ! Nothing ever seems to escape you . Did you ever see any thing so indecorous ? "
59416	59432	59433	59433	I	0	" It made me feel just as if I ought not to look at them , "
59445	59499	59433	59433	I	0	" I have never been accustomed to such things . But seeing how the Major approved of them , and liked to be walking up and down between them , I knew that they must be not only decorous , but attractive . There is no appeal from his judgment , is there ? "
59500	59538	59582	59582	he	179	" I agree with him upon every point , my dear child ; but I have always longed to say a few words about that . For I can not help thinking that he went too far . "
59856	59866	59852	59852	me	0	" we never know what is going to happen ; "
60138	60195	60134	60134	she	1888	" though she had faithfully promised to say nothing about it , because of a dreadful quarrel between her mistress and Mrs. Strouss that was now , and a jealousy between them that was quite beyond belief , she could not refuse such a nice young lady , if I would promise faithfully not to tell . "
60361	60375	60377	60385	the Major , who was now a little crusty	1899	" Now do n't be in such a fierce hurry , Miss Wood , "
60387	60406	60377	60385	the Major , who was now a little crusty	1899	" English ladies allow themselves to be handed out , without hurrying the gentlemen who have the honor . "
60407	60417	60418	60418	I	0	" But I wanted to save you the honor , "
60421	60434	60418	60418	I	0	" I will come back immediately , if you will kindly wait . "
60461	60468	60469	60469	I	0	" Can I see Mrs. Strouss ? "
60498	60518	60473	60480	a queer old man in faded brown livery	1901	" I am the Meesther Strouss ; when you see me , you behold the good Meeses Strouss also . "
60519	60529	60530	60530	I	0	" Thank you , but that will not do , "
60533	60542	60530	60530	I	0	" my business is with Mrs. Strouss alone . "
60582	60592	60593	60593	he	1607	" You had better come back while you can , "
60596	60607	60593	60593	he	1607	" though they seem in no hurry to swallow you . "
60640	60647	60649	60650	Major Hockin	223	" The house is very respectable , "
60674	60701	60666	60666	his	223	" just look , the scraper is clean . You never see that , or at least not often , except with respectable people , Erema . "
60702	60715	60666	60666	his	223	" Pray what would my scraper be ? and who is Erema ? "
60748	60759	60743	60743	her	1907	" I never knew more than one Erema Good mercy ! "
60823	60859	60818	60821	the small Herr Strouss	244	" Vhat are you doing dere , all of you ? vhat have you enterprised with my frau ? Explain , Vilhelmina , or I call de policemans , vhat I should say de peelers . "

60988	61047	60938	60938	he	1607	" and do n't come out until I tell you . You will find work to do there , and remember to pump up . I wish to hear things that you are not to hear , mind you . Shut yourself in , and if you soap the door to deceive me , I shall know it . "

61144	61174	61130	61130	she	240	" and a nobler man never lived ; I am sure of that . But every one of them foreigners excuse me , Sir , you are an Englishman ? "
61175	61179	61181	61182	the Major	1607	" I am , "
61190	61215	61181	61182	the Major	1607	" I am so , madam , and nothing you can say will in any way hurt my feelings . I am above nationalities . "
61216	61267	61130	61130	she	240	" Just so , Sir . Then you will feel with me when I say that they foreigners is dreadful . Oh , the day that I ever married one of 'em but there , I ought to be ashamed of myself , and my lord 's daughter facing me . "
61268	61274	61275	61275	I	0	" Do you know me ? "
61295	61312	61289	61289	I	0	" Are you sure that you know me ? And then please to tell me how . "
61426	61431	61433	61438	the Major , who detested scenes	1925	" Well , well , "
61447	61531	61433	61438	the Major , who detested scenes	1925	" I shall be off . You are in good hands ; and the cabman pulled out his watch when we stopped . So did I. But he is sure to beat me . They draw the minute hand on with a magnet , I am told , while the watch hangs on their badge , and they can swear they never opened it . Wonderful age , very wonderful age , since the time when you and I were young , ma'am . "
61532	61543	61549	61549	she	243	" Yes , Sir ; to be sure , Sir ! "
61558	61671	61549	61549	she	243	" but the most wonderfulest of all things , do n't you think , is the going of the time , Sir ? No cabby can make it go faster while he waits , or slower while he is a - driving , than the minds inside of us manage it . Why , Sir , it wore only like yesterday that this here tall , elegant , royal young lady was a - lying on my breast , and what a hand she was to kick ! And I said that her hair was sure to grow like this . If I was to tell you only half what comes across me "
61672	61749	61755	61755	he	1926	" If you did , ma'am , the cabman would make his fortune , and I should lose mine , which is more than I can afford . Erema , after dinner I shall look you up . I know a good woman when I see her , Mrs. Strouss , which does not happen every day . I can trust Miss Castlewood with you . Good - by , good - by for the present . "
61776	61791	61793	61796	the " good woman	5814	" You see , Sir , why I were obliged to lock him in , "
61794	61798	61793	61796	the " good woman	5814	" good woman , "
61812	61858	61793	61796	the " good woman	5814	" for his own sake I done it , for I felt my cry a - coming , and to see me cry Lord bless you , the effect upon him is to call out for a walking - stick and a pint of beer . "
61859	61868	61869	61870	the Major	1607	" All right , ma'am , all right ! "
61882	61898	61869	61870	the Major	1607	" Cabman , are you asleep there ? Bring the lady 's bag this moment . "
62008	62019	62021	62022	Mrs. Strouss	243	" You are not sure of me , Miss Erema , "
62028	62081	62021	62022	Mrs. Strouss	243	" After all that has happened , who can blame it on you ? But your father was not so suspicious , miss . It might have been better for him if he had according , leastways , to my belief , which a team of wild horses will never drag out . "
62082	62094	62095	62095	I	0	" Oh , only let me hear you talk of that ! "
62103	62130	62095	62095	I	0	" You know more about it than any body I have ever met with , except my own father , who would never tell a word . "
62131	62169	62021	62022	Mrs. Strouss	243	" And quite right he was , miss , according to his views . But come to my little room , unless you are afraid . I can tell you some things that your father never knew . "
62170	62198	62095	62095	I	0	" Afraid ! do you think I am a baby still ? But I can not bear that Mr. Strouss should be locked up on my account . "
62199	62206	62208	62209	Mrs. Strouss	243	" Then he shall come out , "
62217	62243	62208	62209	Mrs. Strouss	243	" That was just like your father , Miss Erema . But I fall into the foreign ways , being so much with the foreigners . "
62251	62253	62245	62245	she	243	" foreigners "
62311	62324	62325	62326	his wife	590	" He is harmless ; his ideas are most grand and good , "
62337	62370	62325	62326	his wife	590	" But I could not have you in with the gentleman , Hans . He always makes mistakes with the gentlemen , miss , but with the ladies he behaves quite well . "
62371	62385	62386	62387	Herr Strouss	244	" Yes , yes , with the ladies I am nearly always goot , "
62393	62423	62386	62387	Herr Strouss	244	" The ladies comprehend me right , all right , because I am so habitual with my wife . But the gentlemans in London have no comprehension of me . "
62424	62433	62434	62434	I	0	" Then the loss is on their side , "
62445	62457	62442	62442	he	244	" Yes , yes , they lose vere much by me . "
62697	62705	62706	62707	Mrs. Strouss	243	" If you please , Miss Castlewood , "
62712	62830	62706	62707	Mrs. Strouss	243	" do you or do you not approve of the presence of ' my man , ' as he calls himself ? an improper expression , in my opinion ; such , however , is their nature . He can hold his tongue as well as any man , though none of them are very sure at that . And he knows pretty nigh as much as I do , so far as his English can put things together , being better accustomed in German . For when we were courting I was fain to tell him all , not to join him under any false pretenses , miss , which might give him grounds against me . "
62831	62851	62706	62707	Mrs. Strouss	243	" Yes , yes , it is all vere goot and true so goot and true as can be . "
62852	62890	62706	62707	Mrs. Strouss	243	" And you might find him come very handy , my dear , to run of any kind of messages . He can do that very well , I assure you , miss better than any Englishman . "
62925	62940	62942	62943	his Wilhelmina	1947	" Then sit by the door , Hans , and keep off the draught , "
62947	63293	62942	62943	his Wilhelmina	1947	" He is not very tall , miss , but he has good shoulders ; I scarcely know what I should do without him . Well , now , to begin at the very beginning : I am a Welshwoman , as you may have heard . My father was a farmer near Abergavenny , holding land under Sir Watkin Williams , an old friend of your family . My father had too many girls , and my mother scarcely knew what to do with the lot of us . So some of us went out to service , while the boys staid at home to work the land . One of my sisters was lady's - maid to Lady Williams , Sir Watkin 's wife , at the time when your father came visiting there for the shooting of the moor - fowl , soon after his marriage with your mother . What a sweet good lady your mother was ! I never saw the like before or since . No sooner did I set eyes upon her but she so took my fancy that I would have gone round the world with her . We Welsh are a very hot people , they say not cold - blooded , as the English are . So , wise or foolish , right , wrong , or what might be , nothing would do for me but to take service , if I could , under Mrs. Castlewood . Your father was called Captain Castlewood then as fine a young man as ever clinked a spur , but without any boast or conceit about him ; and they said that your grandfather , the old lord , kept him very close and spare , although he was the only son . Now this must have been let me see , how long ago ? about five - and - twenty years , I think . How old are you now , Miss Erema ? I can keep the weeks better than the years , miss . "
63294	63312	63545	63547	the old lord	5878	" I was eighteen on my last birthday . But never mind about the time go on . "
63313	63539	62942	62943	his Wilhelmina	1947	" But the time makes all the difference , miss , although at the time we may never think so . Well , then , it must have been better than six - and - twenty year agone ; for though you came pretty fast , in the Lord 's will , there was eight years between you and the first - born babe , who was only just a - thinking of when I begin to tell . But to come back to myself , as was mother had got too many of us still , and she was glad enough to let me go , however much she might cry over it , as soon as Lady Williams got me the place . My place was to wait upon the lady first , and make myself generally useful , as they say . But it was not very long before I was wanted in other more important ways , and having been brought up among so many children , they found me very handy with the little ones ; and being in a poor way , as they were then for people , I mean , of their birth and place they were glad enough soon to make head nurse of me , although I was under - two - and - twenty . "
63721	63896	63697	63698	the liars	1964	" For the old lord , instead of going on as he should , and widening his purse to the number of the mouths , was niggling at them always for offense or excuse , to take away what little he allowed them . The Captain had his pay , which would go in one hand , and the lady had a little money of her own ; but still it was cruel for brought - up people to have nothing better to go on with . Not that the old lord was a miser neither ; but it was said , and how far true I know not , that he never would forgive your father for marrying the daughter of a man he hated . And some went so far as to say that if he could have done it , he would have cut your father out of all the old family estates . But such a thing never could I believe of a nobleman having his own flesh and blood . "
63998	64101	63995	63996	Miss Erema	160	" Now , my dear , you look so sad and so ' solid , ' as we used to say , that if I can go on at all , I must have something ready . I am quite an old nurse now , remember . Hans , go across the square , and turn on the left hand round the corner , and then three more streets toward the right , and you see one going toward the left , and you go about seven doors down it , and then you see a corner with a lamp - post . "
64102	64117	63995	63996	Miss Erema	160	" Vilhelmina , I do see de lamp - post at de every corner . "
64118	64149	63995	63996	Miss Erema	160	" That will teach you to look more bright , Hans . Then you find a shop window with three blue bottles , and a green one in the middle . "
64150	64166	63995	63996	Miss Erema	160	" How can be any middle to three , without it is one of them ? "
64167	64221	63995	63996	Miss Erema	160	" Then let it be two of them . How you contradict me ! Take this little bottle , and the man with a gold braid round a cap , and a tassel with a tail to it , will fill it for four - pence when you tell him who you are . "
64222	64251	64252	64252	I	0	" Yes , yes ; I do now comprehend . You send me vhere I never find de vay , because I am in de vay , Vilhelmina ! "
64344	64351	64352	64353	Mrs. Strouss	243	" It is very sad now , "
64364	64521	64352	64353	Mrs. Strouss	243	" Miss Erema , it is so sad that I wish I had never begun with it . But I see by your eyes so like your father 's , but softer , my dear , and less troublesome that you will have the whole of it out , as he would with me once when I told him a story for the sake of another servant . It was just about a month before you were born , when the trouble began to break on us . And when once it began , it never stopped until all that were left ran away from it . I have read in the newspapers many and many sad things coming over whole families , such as they call ' shocking tragedies ; ' but none of them , to my mind , could be more galling than what I had to see with my very own eyes . "
64697	64927	64939	64939	you	1994	" What passed among them was unknown to any but themselves , except so far as now I tell you . A better dinner than usual for two was ready , to celebrate the master 's return and the beginning of his holiday ; and the old lord , having travelled far that day , was persuaded to sit down with them . The five eldest children making all except the baby , for you was not born , miss , if you please they were to have sat up at table , as pretty as could be three with their high cushioned stools , and two in their arm - chairs screwed on mahogany , stuffed with horsehair , and with rods in front , that the little dears might not tumble out in feeding , which they did it was a sight to see them ! And how they would give to one another , with their fingers wet and shining , and saying , ' Oo , dat for oo . ' Oh dear , Miss Erema , you were never born to see it ! What a blessing for you ! All those six dear darlings laid in their little graves within six weeks , with their mother planted under them ; and the only wonder is that you yourself was not upon her breast . "
65086	65300	65080	65080	he	1999	" You may be sure that I had enough to do to manage all the little ones and answer all their questions ; but never having seen a live lord before , and wanting to know if the children would be like him before so very long , I went quietly down stairs , and the biggest of my dears peeped after me . And then , by favor of the parlor - maid for they kept neither butler nor footman now I saw the Lord Castlewood , sitting at his ease , with a glass of port - wine before him , and my sweet mistress the Captain 's wife , and your mother , if you understand , miss doing her very best , thinking of her children , to please him and make the polite to him . To me he seemed very much to be thawing to her if you can understand , miss , what my meaning is and the Captain was looking at them with a smile , as if it were just what he had hoped for . From my own eyesight I can contradict the lies put about by nobody knows who , that the father and the son were at hot words even then . "
65399	65465	65381	65381	he	5313	" ' I expect you to call me in the morning , George , ' I heard him say , as clear as could be , while his son was helping his coat on . ' I am glad I have seen you . There are worse than you . And when the times get better , I will see what I can do . ' "
65572	65785	65564	65564	his	5313	" Well , that stopped me , Miss Erema , from being truly accurate in my testimony . What with walking the floor , and thumping his back , and rattling of the rings to please him when they put me on the Testament , cruel as they did , with the lawyers ' eyes eating into me , and both my ears buzzing with sorrow and fright , I may have gone too far , with my heart in my mouth , for my mind to keep out of contradiction , wishful as I was to tell the whole truth in a manner to hurt nobody . And without any single lie or glaze of mine , I do assure you , miss , that I did more harm than good ; every body in the room a court they called it , and no bigger than my best parlor one and all they were convinced that I would swear black was white to save my master and mistress ! And certainly I would have done so , and the Lord in heaven thought the better of me , for the sake of all they children , if I could have made it stick together , as they do with practice . "
65896	65905	65913	65913	she	1943	" I am only astonished , my dear , "
65931	66047	65913	65913	she	1943	" that you can put up so well , and abide with my instincts in the way you do . None of your family could have done it , to my knowledge of their dispositions , much less the baby that was next above you . But it often comes about to go in turns like that ; ' one , three , five , and seven is sweet , while two , four , and six is a - squalling with their feet . ' But the Lord forgive me for an ill word of them , with their precious little bodies washed , and laying in their patterns till the judgment - day . "
66224	66398	66401	66402	three cook	2028	" He went into the dining - room , and mistress , who had been up stairs to see about the baby , went down to him ; and there I heard them talking as pleasant and as natural as they always were together . Not one of them had the smallest sense of trouble hanging over them ; and they put away both the decanters and cruets , and came up to bed in their proper order , the master stopping down just to finish his cigar and see to the doors and the bringing up the silver , because there was no man - servant now . And I heard him laughing at some little joke he made as he went into the bedroom . A happier household never went to bed , nor one with better hopes of a happy time to come . And the baby slept beside his parents in his little cot , as his mother liked to have him , with his blessed mouth wide open . "
66618	66763	66777	66778	the man	5186	" But the Lord in His mercy remember me , miss ! When I opened the door , I had no blood left . There stood two men , with a hurdle on their shoulders , and on the hurdle a body , with the head hanging down , and the front of it slouching , like a sack that has been stolen from ; and behind it there was an authority with two buttons on his back , and he waited for me to say something ; but to do so was beyond me . Not a bit of caution or of fear about my sham dress - up , as the bad folk put it afterward ; the whole of such thoughts was beyond me outright , and no thought of any thing came inside me , only to wait and wonder . "
66871	66991	66992	66992	I	0	" ' Oh , but my mistress , my mistress ! ' I cried ; ' and her time up , as nigh as may be , any day or night before new moon . ' Oh , Mr. Constable , Mr. Rural Polishman , take it to the tool shed , if you ever had a wife , Sir . ' Now even this was turned against us as if I had expected it . They said that I must have known who it was , and to a certain length so I did , miss , but only by the dress and the manner of the corpse , and lying with an attitude there was no contradicting . "
67147	67255	67138	67138	I	0	" But having time to think , the shock began to work upon me , and I was fit for nothing when I saw the children smiling up with their tongues out for their bread and milk , as they used to begin the day with . And I do assure you , Miss Erema , my bitterest thought was of your coming , though unknown whether male or female , but both most inconvenient then , with things in such a state of things . You have much to answer for , miss , about it ; but how was you to help it , though ? "
67402	67475	67380	67380	he	260	" My master , the Captain , your father , miss , came out of a window and down the cross - walk , while I was at the green door peeping , for I thought that I might be wanted , if only to take orders what was to be done inside . The constable stiffly touched his hat , and marched to the head of the hurdle , and said , "
67484	67680	67478	67478	you	2059	" Your father took no more notice of him than if he had been a stiff hollyhock , which he might have resembled if he had been good - looking . The Captain thought highly of discipline always , and no kinder gentleman could there be to those who gave his dues to him . But that man 's voice had a low and dirty impertinent sort of a twang with it . Nothing could have been more unlucky . Every thing depended on that fellow in an ignorant neighborhood like that ; and his lordship , for such he was now , of course , would not even deign to answer him . He stood over his head in his upright way by a good foot , and ordered him here and there , as the fellow had been expecting , I do believe , to order his lordship . And that made the bitterest enemy of him , being newly sent into these parts , and puffed up with authority . And the two miller 's men could not help grinning , for he had waved them about like a pair of dogs . "
67869	67907	67911	67911	my	0	" Then the Captain stood up in his strength and height , without any pride and without any shame , only in the power of a simple heart , and he said words fit to hang him : "
67934	68045	68053	68054	your father	5066	" Several of us now were looking in , and the news going out like a winnowing woman with no one to shut the door after her ; our passage was crowding with people that should have had a tar - brush in their faces . And of course a good score of them ran away to tell that the Captain had murdered his father . The milk - man stood there with his yoke and cans , and his naily boots on our new oil - cloth , and , not being able to hide himself plainly , he pulled out his slate and began to make his bill . "
68189	68402	68430	68430	he	261	" All this time , you must understand , there was no sign yet what had happened to his lordship , over and above his being dead . All of us thought , if our minds made bold to think , that it must have pleased the Lord to take his lordship either with an appleplexy or a sudden heart - stroke , or , at any rate , some other gracious way not having any flow of blood in it . But now , while your father was gone up stairs for he knew that his father was dead enough to be sure that your mother was quiet , and perhaps to smooth her down for trouble , and while I was run away to stop the ranting of the children , old Dr. Diggory and that rural officer were handling poor Lord Castlewood . They set him to their liking , and they cut his clothes off so Susan told me afterward and then they found why they were forced to do so , which I need not try to tell you , miss . Only they found that he was not dead from any wise visitation , but because he had been shot with a bullet through his heart . "
68470	68491	68460	68460	his	261	" ' Would you kill my wife ? ' he said ; ' you shall not kill my wife . ' "
68514	68582	68503	68503	his	5998	" The Captain could have throttled him with one hand , and Susan thought he would have done it . But , instead of that , he said , ' Very well ; do your duty . But let me see what you mean by it . ' Then he walked back again to the body of his father , and saw that he had been murdered . "
68646	68647	68653	68653	nurse	2098	" "
68655	68666	68653	68653	nurse	2098	" I answered , calling all my little courage back . "
68699	68699	68690	68690	I	0	"
68707	68712	68714	68715	Mrs. Strouss	243	" Well , now , "
68728	68822	68827	68827	his	431	" if I were to tell you every little thing that went on among them , miss , I should go on from this to this day week , or I might say this day fortnight , and then not half be done with it . And the worst of it is that those little things make all the odds in a case of that sort , showing what the great things were . But only a counselor at the Old Bailey could make head or tail of the goings on that followed . "
69114	69189	69085	69085	he	2106	" ' This bullet is just like those of my own pistol ! ' he cried , and he sat down hard with amazement . You may suppose how this went against him , when all he desired was to know and tell the truth ; and people said that of course he got it out , after a bottleful of doctors failed , because he knew best how it was put in . ' "
69291	69474	69487	69488	the constable	5998	" The rural polishman stared at this , being used on the other hand to be made much of . But seeing how capable the Captain was of acting up to any thing , he made a sulky scrape , and said , ' Sir , as you please for the present , ' weighting his voice on those last three words , as much as to say , ' Pretty soon you will be handcuffed . ' ' Then , ' said my master , ' I shall also insist on the presence of two persons , simply to use their eyes without any fear or favor . One is my gardener , a very honest man , but apt to be late in the morning . The other is a faithful servant , who has been with us for several years . Their names are Jacob Rigg and Betsy Bowen . You may also bring two witnesses , if you choose . And the miller 's men , of course , will come . But order back all others . ' "
69524	69604	69487	69488	the constable	5998	" With a few more words we all set forth , six in number , and no more ; for the constable said that the miller 's men , who had first found the late Lord Castlewood , were witnesses enough for him . And Jacob Rigg , whose legs were far apart as he said from trenching celery , took us through the kitchen - garden , and out at a gap , which saved every body knowing . "
69742	70025	70026	70026	We	2140	" I can not expect to be clear to you , miss , though I see it all now as I saw it then , every tree , and hump , and hedge of it ; only about the distances from this to that , and that to the other , they would be beyond me . You must be on the place itself ; and I never could carry distances no , nor even clever men , I have heard my master say . But when he came to that stile he stopped and turned upon all of us clearly , and as straight as any man of men could be . ' Here I saw my father last , at a quarter past ten o'clock last night , or within a few minutes of that time . ' I wished to see him to his inn , but he would not let me do so , and he never bore contradiction . He said that he knew the way well , having fished more than thirty years ago up and down this stream . He crossed this stile , and we shook hands over it , and the moon being bright , I looked into his face , and he said , ' My boy , God bless you ! ' Knowing his short ways , I did not even look after him , but turned away , and went straight home along this road . Upon my word as an Englishman , and as an officer of her Majesty , that is all I know of it . Now let us go on to the to the other place . "
70068	70093	70059	70060	the constable	5998	" ' Did you hear no sound of a shot , my lord ? For he fell within a hundred yards of this . ' "
70140	70369	70370	70376	The cleverest of the miller 's men	2146	" We obeyed him at once ; and even the constable looked right and left , as if he had been wrong . He signed to the miller 's man to lead the way , and my lord walked proudly after him . The path was only a little narrow track , with the grass , like a front of hair , falling over it on the upper side and on the under , dropping away like side curls ; such a little path that I was wondering how a great lord could walk over it . Then we came down a steep place to a narrow bridge across a shallow river abridge made of only two planks and a rail , with a prop or two to carry them . And one end of the handrail was fastened into a hollow and stubby old hawthorn - tree , overhanging the bridge and the water a good way . And just above this tree , and under its shadow , there came a dry cut into the little river , not more than a yard or two above the wooden bridge , a water - trough such as we have in Wales , miss , for the water to run in , when the farmer pleases ; but now there was no water in it , only gravel . "
70473	70497	70511	70512	the constable	5998	" ' Have you searched the place well ? ' the Captain asked . ' Have you found any weapon or implement ? ' "
70568	70611	70622	70623	your father	5066	" ' You acted for the best , my man . Now search the place carefully , while I stand here . I am on my parole , I shall not run away . Jacob , go down and help them . ' "
70670	70771	70780	70781	the constable	5998	" For a long time they looked about , according to their attitudes , without finding any thing more than the signs of the manner in which the poor lord fell , and of these the constable pulled out a book and made a pencil memorial . But presently Jacob , a spry sort of man , cried , ' Hulloa ! whatever have I got hold of here ? Many a good craw - fish have I pulled out from this bank when the water comes down the gully , but never one exactly like this here afore . ' "
70825	70940	70944	70944	e	2171	" ' Hand it to me , Jacob , ' the Captain said . ' You understand a gun , and this goes off just the same . ' Constable Jobbins have no fear . ' Yes , it is exactly as I thought . This pistol is one of the double - barreled pair which I bought to take to India . The barrels are rifled ; it shoots as true as any rifle , and almost as hard up to fifty yards . The right barrel has been fired , the other is still loaded . The bullet I took from my father 's body most certainly came from this pistol . ' "
71011	71127	71142	71142	he	5066	" ' No , Jacob , I can do nothing of the kind , ' your father answered ; while the rural man came up and faced things , not being afraid of a fight half so much as he was of an accident ; by reason of his own mother having been blown up by a gunpowder start at Dartford , yet came down all right , miss , and had him three months afterward , according to his own confession ; nevertheless , he came up now as if he had always been upright , in the world , and he said , ' My lord , can you explain all this ? ' "
71232	71312	71208	71209	my master	5313	" But Jobbins looked back at my lord with a grin , and his little eyes , hard to put up with . ' Have you nothing to say , my lord ? Then I am afeared I must ask you just to come along of me . ' And my master went with him , miss , as quiet as a lamb ; which Jobbins said , and even Jacob fancied , was a conscience sign of guilt . "
71633	71777	71631	71631	miss	5145	" Then it seemed as if Heaven , to avenge his lordship , rained down pestilence upon that house . A horrible disease , the worst I ever met , broke out upon the little harmless dears , the pride of my heart and of every body 's eyes , for lovelier or better ones never came from heaven . They was all gone to heaven in a fortnight and three days , and laid in the church - yard at one another 's side , with little beds of mould to the measure of their stature , and their little carts and drums , as they made me promise , ready for the judgment - day . Oh , my heart was broken , miss , my heart was broken ! I cried so , I thought I could never cry more . "
71988	72217	71940	71940	Betsy	240	" I had better have been shot , my dear , according as the old lord was , than have the pain that went through all my heart , to see the mother so . She sat up , leaning on one arm , with the hand of the other round your little head , and her beautiful hair was come out of its loops , and the color in her cheeks was like a shell . Past the fringe of the curtain , and behind it too , her soft bright eyes were a - looking here and there for the first to come in of her children . The Lord only knows what lies I told her , so as to be satisfied without them . First I said they were all gone for a walk ; and then that the doctor had ordered them away ; and then that they had got the measles . That last she believed , because it was worse than what I had said before of them ; and she begged to see Dr. Diggory about it , and I promised that she should as soon as he had done his dinner . And then , with a little sigh , being very weak , she went down into her nest again , with only you to keep her company . "
72375	72465	72356	72356	I	0	" He had come out of prison ; and although not being tried , his clothes were still in decency , they had great holes in them , and the gloss all gone to a smell of mere hedges and ditches . The hat on his head was quite out of the fashion , even if it could be called a hat at all , and his beautiful beard had no sign of a comb , and he looked as old again as he had looked a month ago . "
72596	72641	72646	72646	he	0	" ' Oh , master ; oh , Captain ; oh , my lord ! ' I cried ; ' for the sake of God in heaven , do n't talk like that . Think of your sweet wife , your dear lady . ' "
72687	72778	72781	72781	he	2233	" My discretion would have been not to let him see her , but go on and write to her from foreign countries , with the salt sea between them ; but I give you my word that I had no discretion , but from pity and majesty obeyed him . I knew that he must have broken prison , and by good rights ought to be starving . But I could no more offer him the cold ham and pullet than take him by his beard and shake him . "
72819	72922	72812	72812	he	2233	" ' Yes , ma'am , at last , at the last he will , ' I answered , while I thought of the burial service , which I had heard three times in a week for the little ones went to their graves in pairs to save ceremony ; likewise of the Epistle of Saint Paul , which is not like our Lord 's way of talking at all , but arguing instead of comforting . And not to catch her up in that weak state , I said , ' He will find every one of them , ma'am . ' "
73000	73145	72981	72981	Betsy	240	" I was surprised at her manner of speaking , which I would not have allowed to her , but more than all about her children , which she could only have been dreaming yet , for nobody else came nigh her except only me , miss , and you , miss , and for you to breathe words was impossible . All you did was to lie very quiet , tucked up into your mother 's side ; and as regular as the time - piece went , wide came your eyes and your mouth to be fed . If your nature had been cross or squally , ' baby 's coffin No . 7 ' would have come after all the other six , which the thief of a carpenter put down on his bill as if it was so many shavings . "
73362	73525	73567	73567	They	2254	" This he was obliged to do quick , and no mistake , glad as he might have been to say more words , because the fellows who call themselves officers , without any commission , were after him . False it was to say , as was said , that he got out of Winchester jail through money . That story was quite of a piece with the rest . His own strength and skill it was that brought him out triumphantly , as the scratches on his hands and cheeks might show . He did it for the sake of his wife , no doubt . When he heard that the children were all in their graves , and their mother in the way to follow them , madness was better than his state of mind , as the officers told me when they could not catch him and sorry they would have been to do it , I believe . "
73758	73849	73850	73850	He	2268	" We heard a noise of horses in the valley , and the clank of swords no doubt the mounted police from Winchester a - crossing of the Moonstock Bridge to search our house for the runaway . And the Captain took my hand , and said , ' I trust them to you . Hide the clothes I took off , that they may not know I have been here . I trust my wife and little babe to you , and may God bless you , Betsy ! ' "
73921	73921	73914	73914	my	0	"
74233	74252	74253	74253	he	223	" Yes , I understand all that as well as if I had heard every word of it , "
74283	74294	74253	74253	he	223	" You must never think twice of what old women say "
74305	74327	74303	74303	himself	223	" they always go prating and finding mares'-nests , and then they always cry . Now did she cry , Erema ? "
74341	74348	74303	74303	himself	223	" No , not one drop ; "
74360	74367	74357	74357	I	0	" How could she help it ? "
74368	74371	74372	74373	the Major	1607	" Exactly ! "
74388	74439	74372	74373	the Major	1607	" No , go on , cabby , if your horse can do it . My dear , I beg your pardon , but you are so very simple ! You have not been among the eye - openers of the west . This comes of the obsolete Uncle Sam . "
74440	74451	74452	74452	I	0	" I would rather be simple than ' cute ! ' "
74455	74466	74452	74452	I	0	" and my own Uncle Sam will be never obsolete . "
74525	74532	74534	74544	a man with a high - crowned hat japanned at intervals	2288	" Move on ! move on ! "
74566	74574	74562	74562	he	2288	" Now move on , will you ? "
74605	74610	74601	74601	he	2288	" I am starving , "
74736	74753	74733	74733	he	2299	" Step this way , young lady . Major Hockin , step this way , Sir . "
74761	74859	74733	74733	he	2299	" in wonder as to what English English is , and then we were shown into a sacred little room , where the daylight had glass reflectors for it , if it ever came to use them . But as it cared very little to do this , from angular disabilities , three bright gas - lights were burning in soft covers , and fed the little room with a rich , sweet glow . And here shone one of the partners of the bank , a very pleasant - looking gentleman , and very nicely dressed . "
74863	74873	74733	74733	he	2299	" he said , after looking at the card , "
74908	74909	74900	74903	the late Sir Rufus	233	" "
74913	74923	74900	74903	the late Sir Rufus	233	" replied the Major , well pleased , however . "
74946	74947	74942	74944	my first cousin	2304	" "
74996	74997	74990	74991	Miss Hockin	270	" "
75000	75005	74990	74991	Miss Hockin	270	" said his visitor , "
75053	75089	75050	75051	Lord Castlewood	190	" Mr. Shovelin had been looking at me with as much curiosity as good manners and his own particular courtesy allowed . And I fancied that he felt that I could not be a Hockin . "
75097	75109	75050	75051	Lord Castlewood	190	" was all he said , though he wanted to say , "
75114	75122	75050	75051	Lord Castlewood	190	" or something more sudden and stronger . "
75140	75141	75131	75134	My dear young lady	2310	" "
75151	75155	75144	75144	I	0	" I said ; "
75168	75169	75166	75166	him	190	" "
75176	75185	75166	75166	him	190	" he answered , putting on his spectacles . "
75235	75322	75324	75324	you	2315	" Here Mr. Shovelin stopped , as behooves a man who begins to outrun himself . He could not tell me that it was himself who had found all the money for my father 's escape , which cost much cash as well as much good feeling . Neither did I , at the time , suspect it , being all in the dark upon such points . Not knowing what to say , I looked from the banker to the Major , and back again . "
75331	75336	75324	75324	you	2315	" the latter asked . "
75357	75358	75359	75359	You	2315	" "
75366	75371	75359	75359	You	2315	" Mr. Shovelin answered , "
75393	75394	75415	75415	she	2317	" "
75428	75493	75423	75423	you	2315	" I was not quick enough then to see that this was arranged between them . Major Hockin perceived that Mr. Shovelin wished to have a talk with me about dearer matters than money , having children of his own , and being as his eyes and forehead showed a man of peculiar views , perhaps , but clearly of general good - will . "
75507	75514	75423	75423	you	2315	" the Major intensified his intentions always "
75560	75628	75629	75630	Miss Castlewood	160	" This vexed me , as if I were a savage here ; and I only replied with a very gentle bow , being glad to see his departure ; for Major Hockin was one of those people , so often to be met with , whom any one likes or dislikes according to the changes of their behavior . But Mr. Shovelin was different from that . "
75636	75640	75629	75630	Miss Castlewood	160	" he said ; "
75735	75736	75711	75712	Your father	5066	" "
75774	75775	75761	75761	I	0	" "
75837	75838	75829	75829	him	5066	" "
75852	75857	75848	75848	he	5066	" I cried out . "
75881	75882	75874	75874	him	5066	" "
76012	76013	75993	75993	he	5066	" "
76022	76035	76036	76036	You	160	" I said , bluntly , having so often met with that . "
76073	76074	76063	76063	Somebody	748	" "
76077	76178	76063	76063	Somebody	748	" replied Mr. Shovelin , with a look of calm consideration ; ' somebody did it , undoubtedly ; and that makes the difficulty of the whole affair . ' Cui bono , ' as the lawyers say . Two persons only could have had any motive , so far as wealth and fortune go . The first and most prominent , your father , who , of course , would come into every thing which made the suspicion so hot and strong ; and the other , a very nice gentleman , whom it is wholly impossible to suspect . "
76179	76215	76063	76063	Somebody	748	" Are you sure of that ? People have more than suspected they have condemned my father . After that , I can suspect any body . Who is it ? Please to tell me . "
76216	76267	76063	76063	Somebody	748	" It is the present Lord Castlewood , as he is beginning to be called . He would not claim the title , or even put forward his right in any way , until he had proof of your dear father 's death ; and even then he behaved so well "
76268	76277	76278	76278	I	0	" He did it ! he did it ! "
76285	76387	76278	76278	I	0	" My father 's name shall be clear of it . Can there be any doubt that he did it ? How very simple the whole of it becomes ! Nothing astonishes me , except the stupidity of people . He had every thing to gain , and nothing to lose a bad man , no doubt though I never heard of him . And putting it all on my father , of course , to come in himself , and abide his time , till the misery killed my father . How simple , how horribly simple , it becomes ! "
76388	76405	76481	76481	He	2342	" You are much too quick , too hot , too sudden . Excuse me a minute "
76411	76447	76448	76448	I	0	" I am wanted in the next room . But before I go , let me give you a glass of cold water , and beg you to dismiss that new idea from your mind . "
76703	76716	76717	76717	he	2342	" I was going to tell you , my dear Miss Castlewood , "
76722	76872	76717	76717	he	2342	" that your sudden idea must be dismissed , for reasons which I think will content you . In the first place , the present Lord Castlewood is , and always has been , an exemplary man , of great piety and true gentleness ; in the next place , he is an invalid , who can not walk a mile with a crutch to help him , and so he has been for a great many years ; and lastly , if you have no faith in the rest , he was in Italy at the time , and remained there for some years afterward . There he received and sheltered your poor father after his sad calamity , and was better than a brother to him , as your father , in a letter to me , declared . So you see that you must acquit him . "
76873	76921	76717	76717	he	2342	" That is not enough . I would beg his pardon on my knees , since he helped my father , for he must have thought him innocent . Now , Mr. Shovelin , you were my father 's friend , and you are such a clever man "
76922	76940	76717	76717	he	2342	" How do you know that , young lady ? What a hurry you are always in ! "
76941	77016	76717	76717	he	2342	" Oh , there can be no doubt about it . But you must not ask reasons , if I am so quick . Now please to tell me what your own conclusion is . I can talk of it calmly now ; yes , quite calmly , because I never think of any thing else . Only tell me what you really believe , and I will keep it most strictly to myself . "
77017	77026	77027	77027	he	2346	" I am sure you will do that , "
77032	77243	77027	77027	he	2346	" not only from the power of your will , my dear , but also because I have nothing to say . At first I was strongly inclined to believe knowing , from my certainty of your father , that the universal opinion must be wrong that the old lord had done it himself ; for he always had been of a headstrong and violent nature , which I am sure will never re - appear in you . But the whole of the evidence went against this , and little as I think of evidence , especially at an inquest , your father 's behavior confirmed what was sworn to . Your father knew that his father had not made away with himself in a moment of passion , otherwise he was not the man to break prison and fly trial . He would have said , boldly , ' I am guiltless ; there are many things that I can not explain ; I can not help that ; I will face it out . Condemn me , if you like , and I will suffer . ' From your own remembrance of your father 's nature , is not that certainly the course he would have taken ? "
77244	77284	76717	76717	he	2342	" I have not an atom of doubt about it . His flight and persistent dread of trial puzzle me beyond imagination . Of his life he was perfectly reckless , except , at least , for my sake . "
77285	77292	77027	77027	he	2346	" I know that he was , "
77297	77342	77293	77294	Mr. Shovelin	271	" as a boy he was wonderfully fearless . As a man , with a sweet wife and a lot of children , he might have begun to be otherwise . But when all those were gone , and only a poor little baby left "
77343	77353	76717	76717	he	2342	" Yes , I suppose I was all that . "
77354	77485	76717	76717	he	2342	" Forgive me . I am looking back at you . Who could dream that you would ever even live , without kith or kin to care for you ? Your life was saved by some good woman who took you away to Wales . But when you were such a poor little relic , and your father could scarcely have seen you , to have such a mite left must have been almost a mockery of happiness . That motive could not have been strong enough to prevent a man of proud honor from doing what honor at once demanded . Your father would have returned and surrendered as soon as he heard of his dear wife 's death , if in the balance there had been only you . "
77486	77513	77293	77294	Mr. Shovelin	271	" Yes , Mr. Shovelin , perhaps he would . I was never very much as a counter - balance . Yet my father loved me . "
77523	77528	76717	76717	he	2342	" For my sake , "
77531	77538	76717	76717	he	2342	" Yes , for your sake , "
77560	77592	77551	77551	I	0	" He loved you afterward , of course . But a man who has had seven children is not enthusiastic about a baby . There must have been a larger motive . "
77593	77619	77634	77636	the Saturnian banker	2348	" But when I was the only one left alive . Surely I became valuable then . I can not have been such a cipher . "
77620	77632	77634	77636	the Saturnian banker	2348	" Yes , for a long time you would have been , "
77638	77965	77634	77636	the Saturnian banker	2348	" I do not wish to disparage your attractions when you were a fortnight old . They may have begun already to be irresistible . Excuse me ; you have led me into the light vein , when speaking of a most sad matter . You must blame your self - assertion for it . All I wish to convey to you is my belief that something wholly unknown to us , some dark mystery of which we have no inkling , lies at the bottom of this terrible affair . Some strange motive there must have been , strong enough even to overcome all ordinary sense of honor , and an Englishman 's pride in submitting to the law , whatever may be the consequence . Consider that his ' flight from justice , ' as it was called , of course , by every one , condemned his case and ruined his repute . Even for that he would not have cared so much as for his own sense of right . And though he was a very lively fellow , as I first remember him , full of tricks and jokes , and so on , which in this busy age are out of date , I am certain that he always had a stern sense of right . One never knows how love affairs and weakness about children may alter almost any man ; but my firm conviction is that my dear old school - fellow , George Castlewood , even with a wife and lovely children hanging altogether upon his life , not only would not have broken jail , but would calmly have given up his body to be hanged pardon me , my dear , for putting it so coarsely if there had not been something paramount to override even apparent honor . What it can have been I have no idea , and I presume you have none . "
77966	77970	77971	77971	I	0	" None whatever , "
77983	78093	77971	77971	I	0	" I am quite taken by surprise ; I never even thought of such a thing . It has always seemed to me so natural that my dear father , being shamefully condemned , because appearances were against him , and nobody could enter into him , should , for the sake of his wife and children , or even of one child like me , depart or banish himself , or emigrate , or , as they might call it , run away . Knowing that he never could have a fair trial , it was the only straightforward and good and affectionate thing for him to do . "
78094	78113	78114	78115	Mr. Shovelin	271	" You can not see things as men see them . We must not expect it of you , "
78151	78170	78137	78137	he	181	" but , dear me , here is Major Hockin come ! Punctuality is the soul of business . "
78171	78177	78179	78180	the Major	1607	" So I always declare , "
78203	78242	78179	78180	the Major	1607	" My watch keeps time to a minute , Sir , and its master to a second . Well , I hope you have settled all questions of finance , and endowed my young maid with a fortune . "
78243	78249	78261	78261	he	271	" So far from that , "
78266	78304	78261	78261	he	271	" we have not even said one word of business ; all that has been left for your return . Am I to understand that you are by appointment or relationship the guardian of this young lady ? "
78305	78309	78311	78312	Major Hockin	223	" God forbid ! "
78346	78422	78333	78333	he	223	" Not that she is bad , I mean , but good , very good ; indeed , I may say the very best girl ever known outside of my own family . My cousin , Colonel Gundry , who owns an immense estate in the most auriferous district of all California , but will not spoil his splendid property by mining , he will he will tell you the very same thing , Sir . "
78423	78432	78434	78435	the banker	6200	" I am very glad to hear it , "
78456	78496	78434	78435	the banker	6200	" Now I really fear that I must be very brief , though the daughter of my oldest friend may well be preferred to business . But now we will turn at once to business , if you please . "
78562	78566	78567	78568	Major Hockin	223	" No plate , "
78580	78603	78567	78568	Major Hockin	223	" but there may be diamonds , you know , Erema . One ounce of diamonds is worth a ton of plate . "
78604	78607	78609	78610	Mr. Shovelin	271	" No , "
78618	78782	78609	78610	Mr. Shovelin	271	" I fear that you will find nothing of mercantile value . Thank you , Mr. Robinson ; by - and - by perhaps we shall trouble you . Strictly speaking , perhaps I should require the presence of your father 's lawyer , or of some one producing probate , ere I open this box , Miss Castlewood . But having you here , and Major Hockin , and knowing what I do about the matter which is one of personal confidence , I will dispense with formalities . We have given your father 's solicitor notice of this deposit , and requested his attention , but he never has deigned to attend to it ; so now we will dispense with him . You see that the seal is unbroken ; you know your father 's favorite seal , no doubt . The key is nothing ; it was left to my charge . You wish that I should open this ? "
78887	78891	78892	78893	Mr. Shovelin	271	" Poor fellow ! "
78914	78957	78905	78906	the Major	1607	" This is his will ; of no value , I fear , in a pecuniary point of view , but of interest to you his daughter . Shall I open it , Miss Castlewood , or send it to his lawyers ? "
78958	78968	78970	78970	I.	0	" Open it , and never think of them , "
78971	78993	78970	78970	I.	0	" Like the rest , they have forsaken him . Please to read it to yourself , and then tell us . "
78994	79005	79007	79008	the banker	6200	" Oh , I wish I had known this before ! "
79017	79105	79007	79008	the banker	6200	" Very kind , very flattering , I am sure ! Yes , I will do my duty by him ; I wish there was more to be done in the case . He has left me sole executor , and trustee of all his property , for the benefit of his surviving child . Yet he never gave me the smallest idea of expecting me to do this for him . Otherwise , of course , I should have had this old box opened years ago . "
79106	79116	79118	79119	Major Hockin	223	" We must look at things as they are , "
79127	79140	79118	79119	Major Hockin	223	" The question is , what do you mean to do now ? "
79141	79145	79147	79148	the banker	6200	" Nothing whatever , "
79173	79239	79167	79167	he	6200	" Nothing at present , but congratulate myself upon my old friend 's confidence , and , as Abernethy said , ' take advice . ' A banker must never encroach upon the province of the lawyer . But so far as a layman may judge , Major Hockin , I think you will have to transfer to me the care of this young lady . "
79240	79252	79253	79254	the Major	1607	" I shall be only too happy , I assure you , "
79259	79312	79253	79254	the Major	1607	" My wife has a great regard for her , and so have I the very greatest , the strongest regard , and warm parental feelings ; as you know , Erema . But but , I am not so young as I was ; and I have to develop my property . "
79313	79323	79324	79325	Mr. Shovelin	271	" Of which she no longer forms a part , "
79348	79381	79324	79325	Mr. Shovelin	271	" You will find me prompt and proud to claim her , as soon as I am advised that this will is valid ; and that I shall learn to - morrow . "
79423	79438	79439	79439	I	0	" Oh , I hope it is valid ! How I hope it is ! "
79460	79464	79465	79465	he	1607	" But surely , "
79468	79538	79465	79465	he	1607	" as we are all here , we should not neglect the opportunity of inspecting the other contents of this box . To me it appears that we are bound to do so ; that it is our plain duty to ascertain Why , there might even be a later will . Erema , my dear , you must be most anxious to get to the bottom of it . "
79554	79563	79564	79564	I	0	" We must leave that to Mr. Shovelin , "
79567	79579	79580	79581	the banker	6200	" Then for the present we will seal it down again , "
79586	79639	79580	79581	the banker	6200	" we can see that there is no other will , and a later one would scarcely be put under this . The other little packets , whatever they may be , are objects of curiosity , perhaps , rather than of importance . They will keep till we have more leisure . "
79640	79658	79660	79661	the Major	1607	" We have taken up a great deal of your time , Sir , I am sure , "
79671	79684	79660	79661	the Major	1607	" We ought to be , and we are , most grateful . "
79685	79688	79689	79690	the banker	6200	" Well , "
79746	79747	79737	79737	I	0	" "
79750	79760	79737	79737	I	0	" cried the Major , staring at us both . "
79825	79826	79856	79856	I	0	" "
79834	79848	79849	79849	I	0	" I exclaimed , with some terror at Major Hockin 's bristling hair . "
79892	79893	79884	79885	my father	431	" "
79901	79908	79884	79885	my father	431	" the Major said , impressively . "
79980	79981	79982	79982	Jemima	274	" "
79984	79988	79982	79982	Jemima	274	" I cried . "
80011	80012	80013	80013	I	0	" "
80020	80033	80013	80013	I	0	" he answered , smiling , as he shook hands with us ; "
80055	80056	80052	80052	you	5024	" "
80114	80115	80111	80112	Mr. Shovelin	271	" "
80173	80210	80153	80153	I	0	" He showed us out into a narrow alley through a heavy door sheathed with iron , and soon we recovered the fair light of day , and the brawl and roar of a London street . "
80217	80241	80242	80242	You	271	" the Major asked , as soon as he had found a cab again ; for he was very polite in that way . "
80317	80318	80314	80315	Miss Heathen	277	" "
80332	80354	80355	80355	I	0	" I answered , very gravely , for I never could become jocose to order , and sadness still was uppermost . "
80387	80388	80376	80376	She	240	" "
80392	80396	80376	80376	She	240	" he cried . "
80584	80858	80581	80581	you	271	" This place seemed , from what the Major said , to have earned repute for something special , something esteemed by the very clever people , and only to be found in true virtue here . And he told me that luxury and self - indulgence were the greatest sins of the present age , and how he admired a man who came here to protest against Epicureans , by dining liquors not included for the sum of three and sixpence . All this , no doubt , was wise and right ; but I could not attend to it properly now , and he might take me where he would , and have all the talking to himself , according to his practice . And I might not even have been able to say what this temple of bones and cockles was like , except for a little thing which happened there . The room , at the head of a twisting staircase , was low and dark , and furnished almost like a farmhouse kitchen . It had no carpet , nor even a mat , but a floor of black timber , and a ceiling colored blue , with stars and comets , and a full moon near the fire - place . On either side of the room stood narrow tables endwise to the walls , inclosed with high - backed seats like settles , forming thus a double set of little stalls or boxes , with scarcely space enough between for waiters , more urgent than New York firemen , to push their steaming and breathless way . "
80865	80925	80863	80863	miss	5145	" said one of them to me as soon as the Major had set me on a bench , and before my mind had time to rally toward criticism of the knives and forks , which deprecated any such ordeal ; and he cleverly whipped a stand for something dirty , over something still dirtier , on the cloth . "
80934	80957	80931	80931	you	2394	" I replied to his highly zealous aspect , while the Major sat smiling dryly at my ignorance , which vexed me . "
80976	80977	80971	80971	you	223	" "
80980	80990	80992	80993	the waiter	2395	" said the Major ; ' square for both . "
81011	81023	81024	81025	my companion	2286	" Erema , your mind is all up in the sky , "
81030	81041	81024	81025	my companion	2286	" You ought to know better after all your travels . "
81042	81054	81055	81055	I	0	" Then the sky should not fall and confuse me so , "
81072	81094	81055	81055	I	0	" but do tell me what he meant , if you can . Is it about the formation of the soup ? "
81095	81163	81024	81025	my companion	2286	" Hush , my dear . Soup is high treason here until night , when they make it of the leavings . His honest desire was to know whether you would have a grilled bone of mutton , which is naturally round , you know , or of beef , which , by the same law of nature , seems always to be square , you know . "
81164	81170	81171	81171	I	0	" Oh , I see , "
81260	81357	81243	81244	Major Hockin	223	" What ! Cousin Montague ! Bless my heart , who could have dreamed of lighting on you here ? Come in , my dear follow ; there is plenty of room . Let me introduce you to my new ward , Miss Erema Castlewood . Miss Castlewood , this is Sir Montague Hockin , the son of my lamented first cousin Sir Rufus , of whom you have heard so much . Well , to be sure ! I have not seen you for an age . My dear fellow , now how are you ? "
81358	81455	81679	81680	the Major	1607	" Miss Castlewood , please not to move ; I sit any where . Major , I am most delighted to see you . Over and over again I have been at the point of starting for Bruntsea Island it is an island now , is n't it ? My father would never believe that it was till I proved it from the number of rabbits that came up . However , not a desolate island now , if it contains you and all your energies , and Miss Castlewood , as well as Mrs. Hockin . "
81456	81469	81470	81471	the Major	1607	" It is not an island , and it never shall be , "
81486	81574	81470	81471	the Major	1607	" It never was an island , and it never shall be . My intention is to reclaim it altogether . Oh , here come the squares . Well done ! well done ! I quite forget the proper thing to have to drink . Are the cockles in the pan , Mr. Waiter ? Quite right , then ; ten minutes is the proper time ; but they know that better than I do . I am very sorry , Montague , that you have dined . "
81575	81669	81679	81680	the Major	1607	" Surely you would not call this a dinner ; I take my true luncheon afterward . But lately my appetite has been so bad that it must be fed up at short intervals . You can understand that , perhaps , Miss Castlewood . It makes the confectioners ' fortunes , you know . The ladies once came only twice to feed , but now they come three times , I am assured by a young man who knows all about it . And cherry brandy is the mildest form of tipple . "
81670	81677	81679	81680	the Major	1607	" Shocking scandal ! abominable talk ! "
81690	81789	81679	81680	the Major	1607	" I have heard all that sort of stuff ever since I was as high as this table . Waiter , show me this gentleman 's bill . Oh well , oh well ! you have not done so very badly . Two squares and a round , with a jug of Steinberg , and a pint of British stout with your Stilton . If this is your ante - lunch , what will you do when you come to your real luncheon ? But I must not talk now ; you may have it as you please . "
81790	81800	81802	81804	the young man	2402	" The truth of it is , Miss Castlewood , "
81840	81880	81802	81804	the young man	2402	" the truth of it is just this , and no more : we fix our minds and our thoughts , and all the rest of our higher intelligence , a great deal too much upon our mere food . "
81881	81887	81888	81888	I	0	" No doubt we do , "
81894	81934	81888	81888	I	0	" It is very sad to think of , as soon as one has dined . But does that reflection occur , as it should , at the proper time to be useful I mean when we are hungry ? "
81935	81950	81963	81964	the Major	1607	" I fear not ; I fear that it is rather praeterite than practical . "
81951	81961	81963	81964	the Major	1607	" No big words now , my dear fellow , "
81966	82051	81963	81964	the Major	1607	" You have had your turn ; let us have ours . But , Erema , you are eating nothing . Take a knife and fork , Montague , and help her . The beauty of these things consists entirely , absolutely , essentially , I may say , in their having the smoke rushing out of them . A gush of steam like this should follow every turn of the knife . But there ! I am spoiling every bit by talking so . "
82052	82060	82062	82063	Sir Montague	281	" Is that any fault of mine ? "

84568	84610	84550	84550	he	244	" Enemies find out vere soon , too soon , soon enough . Begin to plot no , no , young lady begin first . Vilhelmina , your man say the right . Is it good , or is it bad ? "
84784	84789	84776	84787	a poor old clerk , who said , " Hush , miss	6372	" Hush , miss ! "
84803	84814	84815	84815	he	271	" Could n't you see the half - shutters up ? "
84821	84849	84815	84815	he	271	" ' Tis a bad job for many a poor man to - day . And it seems no more than yesterday I was carrying him about ! "
84850	84857	84858	84858	I	0	" Do you mean Mr. Shovelin ? "
84861	84879	84815	84815	he	271	" Is he poorly ? Has any thing happened ? I can wait , or come again . "
84880	84928	84815	84815	he	271	" The Lord has taken him to the mansions of the just , from his private address at Sydenham Hill . A burning and a shining light ! May we like him be found watching in that day , with our lamps trimmed and our loins girded ! "
84990	84998	84999	84999	he	2483	" It was just in this way , "
85026	85258	84999	84999	he	2483	" Our master is a very punctual man , for five - and - thirty years never late never late once till this morning . Excuse me , miss , I ought to be ashamed . The Lord knoweth what is best for us . Well , you threw him out a good bit yesterday , and there was other troubles . And he had to work late last night , I hear ; for through his work he would go , be it anyhow diligent in business , husbanding the time and when he came down to breakfast this morning , he prayed with his household as usual , but they noticed his voice rather weak and queer ; and the mistress looked at him when he got up from his knees ; but he drank his cup of tea and he ate his bit of toast , which was all he ever took for breakfast . But presently when his cob came up to the door for he always rode in to business , miss , no matter what the weather was he went to kiss his wife and his daughters all round , according to their ages ; and he got through them all , when away he fell down , with the riding - whip in one hand , and expired on a piece of Indian matting . "
85259	85263	85264	85264	I	0	" How terrible ! "
85287	85395	85272	85275	the poor old man	2488	" No , miss ; not a bit of terror about it , to a man prepared as he was . He had had some warning just a year ago ; and the doctors all told him he must leave off work . He could no more do without his proper work than he could without air or victuals . What this old established concern will do without him , our Divine Master only knows . And a pinch coming on in Threadneedle Street , I hear but I scarcely know what I am saying , miss ; I was thinking of the camel and the needle . "
85396	85409	85410	85410	I	0	" I will not repeat what you have not meant to tell , "
85427	85438	85410	85410	I	0	" Only tell me what dear Mr. Shovelin died of . "
85439	85481	85272	85275	the poor old man	2488	" Heart - disease , miss . You might know in a moment . Nothing kills like that . His poor father died of it , thirty years agone . And the better people are , the more they get it . "
86524	86584	86507	86507	she	240	" All these people , whose hovels I saw , had the means of grace before them , and if they would not stretch forth their hands , it was only because they were vessels of wrath . Her pity was rather for our poor black brethren who had never enjoyed no opportunities , and therefore must be castaways . "

88175	88225	88150	88150	he	223	" Station - master , you are very wise in putting in your very best cabbage plants there . You understand your own company . Well done ! If I were to offer you a shilling apiece for those young early Yorks , what would you say , now ? "
88226	88238	88239	88243	the Scotch station - master	2596	" Weel , a think I should say nah , Sir , "
88266	88281	88252	88252	he	223	" They are a veery fine young kail , that always pays for planting . "
88282	88286	88288	88289	the Major	1607	" The villain ! "
88298	88406	88288	88289	the Major	1607	" However , I suppose he does quite right . Set a thief to watch a thief . The company are big rogues , and he tries to be a bigger . We shall cut through his garden in about three months , just when his cabbages are getting firm , and their value will exceed that of pine - apples . The surveyor will come down and certify , and the ' damage to crops ' will be at least five pounds , when they have no right to sow even mustard and cress , and a saucepan would hold all the victuals on the land . "
88447	88450	88451	88451	he	1030	" Coachman , "
88454	88470	88451	88451	he	1030	" just drive along the railway ; you wo n't have the chance much longer . "
88531	88544	88545	88546	Major Hockin	223	" It is one of the saddest things I ever heard of , "
88553	88667	88545	88546	Major Hockin	223	" Poor Shovelin ! poor Shovelin ! A man of large capital the very thing we want . It might have been the making of this place . I have very little doubt that I must have brought him to see our great natural advantages the beauty of the situation , the salubrity of the air , the absence of all clay , or marsh , or noxious deposit , the bright crisp turf , and the noble underlay of chalk , which if you perceive my meaning can not retain any damp , but transmits it into sweet natural wells . Why , driver , where the devil are you driving us ? "
88668	88747	89014	89015	the Major	1607	" No fear , your honor . I know every trick of it . It wo n't come over the wheels , I do believe , and it does all the good in the world to his sand - cracks . Whoa - ho , my boy , then ! And the young lady 's feet might go up upon the cushion , if her boots is thin , Sir ; and Mr. Rasper will excuse of it . "
88748	88751	88762	88763	the Major	1607	" What the "
88754	88761	88762	88763	the Major	1607	" do you mean , Sir ? "
88779	88858	88762	88763	the Major	1607	" Pull out this instant ; pull out , I tell you , or you shall have three months ' hard labor . May I be d d now my dear , I beg your pardon for speaking with such sincerity I simply mean , may I go straightway to the devil , if I do n't put this fellow on the tread - mill . Oh , you can pull out now , then , can you ? "
88859	88871	88872	88874	the poor driver	2609	" If your honor pleases , I never did pull in , "
88889	89002	88872	88874	the poor driver	2609	" My orders was , miss , to drive along the line coming on now just to Bruntsea , and keep in the middle of that same I did , and this here little wet is a haxident a haxident of the full moon , I do assure you , and the wind coming over the sea , as you might say . These pebbles is too round , miss , to stick to one another ; you could n't expect it of them ; and sometimes the water here and there comes a - leaking like through the bottom . I have seed it so , ever since I can remember . "
89003	89013	89014	89015	the Major	1607	" I do n't believe a word of it , "
89040	89092	89030	89030	I	0	" Tell me no lies , Sir ; you belong to the West Bruntseyans , and you have driven us into a vile bog to scare me . They have bribed you . I see the whole of it . Tell me the truth , and you shall have five shillings . "
89169	89178	89166	89166	he	2602	" Will you taste the water , miss ? "
89179	89183	89185	89186	the Major	1607	" Bless me ! "
89188	89320	89166	89166	he	2602	" now I never thought of that . Common people have such ways about things they are used to ! I might have stood here for a month , and never have thought of that way to settle it . Ridiculously simple . Give me a taste , Erema . Ah , that is the real beauty of our coast , my dear ! The strongest proportion of the saline element I should know the taste of it any where . No sea - weed , no fishy particles , no sludge , no beards of oysters . The pure , uncontaminated , perfect brine , that sets every male and female on his legs , varicose , orthopedic I forget their scientifics , but I know the smack of it . "
89321	89324	89325	89325	I	0	" Certainly , "
89328	89387	89325	89325	I	0	" it is beautifully salt . It will give you an appetite for dinner , Major Hockin . I could drink a pint of it , after all that smoke . But do n't you think it is a serious thing for the sea itself to come pouring through the bottom of this pebble bank in this way ? "
89388	89522	89166	89166	he	2602	" Not at all . No , I rather like it . It opens up many strictly practical ideas . It adds very much to the value of the land . For instance , a ' salt - lick , ' as your sweet Yankees call it and set up an infirmary for foot and mouth disease . And better still , the baths , the baths , my dear . No expense for piping , or pumping , or any thing . Only place your marble at the proper level , and twice a day you have the grand salubrious sparkling influx of ocean 's self , self - filtered , and by its own operation permeated with a fine siliceous element . What foreign mud could compete with such a bath ? "
89523	89534	89535	89535	I	0	" But supposing there should come too much of it , "
89538	89549	89535	89535	I	0	" and wash both the baths and the bathers away ? "
89550	89667	89673	89673	he	1607	" Such an idea is ridiculous . It can be adjusted to a nicety . I am very glad I happened to observe this thing , this this noble phenomenon . I shall speak to Montague about it at once , before I am half an hour older . My dear , you have made a conquest ; I quite forgot to tell you ; but never mind that for the present . Driver , here is half a crown for you . Your master will put down the fly to my account . He owes me a heriot . I shall claim his best beast , the moment he gets one without a broken wind . "
90119	90190	90110	90111	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Erema , is it possible that you laugh ? I thought that you never laughed , Erema . At any rate , if you ever do indulge , you might choose a fitter opportunity , I think . You have spoiled his demonstration altogether see , he does not understand such unkindness and it is the very first he has uttered since he came . Oh , poor Fluffsky ! "
90191	90235	90110	90111	Mrs. Hockin	228	" I am very , very sorry . But how was I to help it ? I would not , on any account , have stopped him if I had known he was so sensitive . Fluffsky , do please to begin again . "
90236	90249	90251	90252	Sir Montague	281	" These beggars are nothing at all , I can assure you , "
90270	90345	90260	90260	Fluffsky	296	" Mrs. Hockin , if you really would like to have a fowl that even Lady Clara Crowcombe has not got , you shall have it in a week , or a fortnight , or , at any rate , a month , if I can manage it . They are not to be had except through certain channels , and the fellows who write the poultry books have never even heard of them . "
90346	90453	90501	90502	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Oh , how delighted I shall be ! Lady Clara despises all her neighbors so . But do they lay eggs ? Half the use of keeping poultry , when you never kill them , is to get an egg for breakfast ; and Major Hockin looks round and says , ' Now is this our own ? ' and I can not say that it is ; and I am vexed with the books , and he begins to laugh at me . People said it was for want of chalk , but they walk upon nothing but chalk , as you can see . "
90454	90486	90260	90260	Fluffsky	296	" And their food , Mrs. Hockin . They are walking upon that . Starve them for a week , and forty eggs at least will reward you for stern discipline . "
90565	90568	90578	90578	his	659	" Colonel Gundry "
90606	90743	90602	90602	his	659	" DEAR MISS REMA , Your last favor to hand , with thanks . Every thing is going on all right with us . The mill is built up , and goes better than ever ; more orders on hand than we can get through . We have not cracked the big nugget yet . Expect the government to take him at a trifle below value , for Washington Museum . Must have your consent ; but , for my part , would rather let him go there than break him . Am ready to lose a few dollars upon him , particularly as he might crack up all quartzy in the middle . They offer to take him by weight at three dollars and a half per pound below standard . Please say if agreeable . "
90865	90963	90851	90851	his	206	" If there is any thing that you can do to turn Ephraim back to his duty , my dear , I am sure that , for love of us , you will do it . If Firm was to run away from me now , and go fighting on behalf of slavery , I never should care more for naught upon this side of Jordan ; and the new mill might go to Jericho ; though it does look uncommon handsome now , I can assure you , and tears through its work like a tiger . "
91109	91252	91097	91098	the Lord	597	" About you know what , my dear , be not overanxious . I have been young , and now am old , as the holy Psalmist says ; and the more I see of the ways of men , the less I verily think of them . Their good esteem , their cap in hand , their fair fame , as they call it , goes by accident , and fortune , the whim of the moment , and the way the clever ones have of tickling them . A great man laughs at the flimsy of it , and a good one goes to his conscience . Your father saw these things at their value . I have often grieved that you can not see them so ; but perhaps I have liked you none the worse , my dear . "
91320	91324	91325	91326	SAMPSON GUNDRY	179	" Truly yours , "
91328	91475	91325	91326	SAMPSON GUNDRY	179	" That letter , while it relieved me in one way , from the want of money , cost me more than ten times five hundred dollars ' worth of anxiety . The Sawyer had written to me twice ere this kind , simple letters , but of no importance , except for their goodness and affection . But now it was clear that when he wrote this letter he must have been sadly put out and upset . His advice to me was beyond all value ; but he seemed to have kept none at home for himself . He was carried quite out of his large , staid ways when he wrote those bitter words about poor Firm the very apple of his eye , as the holy Psalmist says . And , knowing the obstinacy of them both , I dreaded clash between them .
92005	92013	92035	92037	Sir Montague Hockin	281	" A trifle sentimental , are we ? "
92076	92085	92086	92086	he	281	" I grieve to intrude upon large ideas , "
92097	92169	92086	92086	he	281	" but I act under positive orders now . A lady knows what is best for a lady . Mrs. Hockin has been looking from the window , and she thinks that you ought not to be sitting in the sun like this . There has been a case of sun - stroke at Southbourne a young lady meditating under the cliff and she begs you to accept this palm leaf . "
92195	92199	92200	92200	I	0	" Thank you , "
92203	92235	92200	92200	I	0	" it was very kind of her to think of it , and of you to do it . But will it be safe for you to go back without it ? "
92236	92245	92246	92246	he	281	" Oh , why should I do so ? "
92293	92321	92322	92322	I	0	" Could you bear to see me slain by the shafts of the sun ? Miss Castlewood , this parasol is amply large for both of us . "
92358	92368	92369	92369	I	0	" Thank you ; I mean to stay here , "
92372	92399	92369	92369	I	0	" you may either leave the parasol or take it , whichever will be less troublesome . At any rate , I shall not use it . "
92470	92481	92482	92482	he	281	" Perhaps I might tell you a thing or two , "
92507	92562	92482	92482	he	281	" a little thing or two of which you have no idea , even in your most lonely musings , which might have a very deep interest for you . Do you think that I came to this hole to see the sea ? Or that fussy old muff of a Major 's doings ? "
92563	92581	92582	92582	I	0	" Perhaps you would like me to tell him your opinion of his intellect and great plans , "
92585	92594	92582	92582	I	0	" And after all his kindness to you ! "
92595	92602	92603	92603	he	281	" You never will do that , "
92606	92643	92603	92603	he	281	" because you are a lady , and will not repeat what is said in confidence . I could help you materially in your great object , if you would only make a friend of me . "
92644	92660	92582	92582	I	0	" And what would your own object be ? The pure anxiety to do right ? "
92661	92716	92718	92718	he	281	" Partly , and I might say mainly , that ; also an ambition for your good opinion , which seems so inaccessible . But you will think me selfish if I even hint at any condition of any kind . Every body I have ever met with likes me , except Miss Castlewood . "
92773	92783	92784	92784	I	0	" I do not see why we should talk , "
92787	92813	92784	92784	I	0	" about either likes or dislikes . Only , if you have any thing to tell , I shall be very much obliged to you . "
92877	92880	92881	92881	I	0	" No , "
92900	92942	92881	92881	I	0	" I mean nothing more than the simple thing I say . If you ought to tell me any thing , tell it . I am accustomed to straightforward people . But they disappoint one by their never knowing any thing . "
92943	92949	92950	92950	he	281	" But I know something , "
92962	92990	92950	92950	he	281	" and perhaps I will tell you some day , when admitted , if ever I have such an honor , to some little degree of friendship . "
92991	93001	93002	93002	I	0	" Oh , please not to think of yourself , "
93014	93088	93002	93002	I	0	" In such a case , the last thing that you should do is that . Think only of what is right and honorable , and your duty toward a lady . Also your duty to the laws of your country . I am not at all sure that you ought not to be arrested . But perhaps it is nothing at all , after all ; only something invented to provoke me . "
93089	93101	93102	93102	he	281	" In that case , I can only drop the subject , "
93121	93169	93102	93102	he	281	" I was also to tell you that we dine to - day an hour before the usual time , that my cousin may go out in the boat for whiting . The sea will be as smooth as glass . Perhaps you will come with us . "
93504	93527	93497	93498	Major Hockin	223	" The Bruntsea Assembly - Rooms , Literary Institute , Mutual Improvement Association , Lyceum , and Baths , from sixpence upward ; "

93672	93678	93680	93681	Mrs. Hockin	228	" This is very sad , "
94068	94073	94063	94063	I	0	" blew hot and cold "
95419	95423	95424	95424	he	190	" Miss Castlewood , "
95437	95493	95424	95424	he	190	" for many years I have longed in vain and sought in vain to hear of you . I have not escaped all self - reproach through my sense of want of energy ; yet , such as I am , I have done my best , or I do my best to think so . "
95494	95501	95502	95502	I	0	" I am sure you have , "
95530	95565	95570	95570	he	190	" I owe you more gratitude than I can tell , for your goodness to my dear father . I am not come now to trouble you , but because it was my duty . "
95714	95720	95721	95721	he	190	" My dear young cousin , "
95734	95791	95792	95792	He	190	" your father trusted me , and so must you . You may think that I have forgotten you , or done very little to find you out . It was no indifference , no forgetfulness : I have not been able to work myself , and I have had very deep trouble of my own . "
95989	95994	95995	95995	he	190	" It is hard , "
95998	96045	95995	95995	he	190	" that you , so young and healthy and full of high spirit as you are unless your face belies you , should begin the best years of your life , as common opinion puts such things , in such a cloud of gloom and shame . "
96046	96054	96055	96055	I	0	" There is no shame at all , "
96058	96089	95995	95995	he	190	" and if there is gloom , I am used to that ; and so was my father for years and years . What is my trouble compared with his ? "
96090	96154	96155	96155	His	2756	" Your trouble is nothing when compared with his , so far as regards the mere weight of it ; but he was a strong man to carry his load ; you are a young and a sensitive woman . The burden may even be worse for you . Now tell me all about yourself , and what has brought you to me . "
96358	96370	96485	96485	he	6288	" And what do you propose to do next , Erema ? "
96371	96380	96381	96381	I	0	" To go to the very place itself , "
96398	96475	96381	96381	I	0	" to live in the house where my father lived , and my mother and all of the family died ; and from day to day to search every corner and fish up every bit of evidence , until I get hold of the true man at last , of the villain who did it who did it , and left my father and all the rest of us to be condemned and die for it . "
96476	96479	96485	96485	he	6288	" Erema , "
96494	96551	96485	96485	he	6288	" you are too impetuous for such work , and it is wholly unfit for you . For such a task , persons of trained sagacity and keen observation are needed . And after all these eighteen years , or nearly nineteen now it must be , there can not be any thing to discover there . "
96552	96588	96485	96485	he	6288	" But if I like , may I go there , cousin , if only to satisfy my own mind ? I am miserable now at Bruntsea , and Sir Montague Hockin wears me out . "
96589	96594	96595	96596	Lord Castlewood	190	" Sir Montague Hockin ! "
96599	96621	96595	96596	Lord Castlewood	190	" why , you did not tell me that he was there . Wherever he is , you should not be . "
96622	96687	96485	96485	he	6288	" I forgot to speak of him . He does not live there , but is continually to and fro for bathing , or fishing , or rabbit - shooting , or any other pretext . And he makes the place very unpleasant to me , kind as the Major and Mrs. Hockin are , because I can never make him out at all . "
96688	96696	96697	96698	my cousin	6288	" Do not try to do so , "
96706	96766	96697	96698	my cousin	6288	" be content to know nothing of him , my dear . If you can put up with a very dull house , and a host who is even duller , come here and live with me , as your father would have wished , and as I , your nearest relative , now ask and beg of you . "
97000	97010	97011	97011	I	0	" I am very much obliged to you indeed , "
97014	97069	97011	97011	I	0	" but I think you might be sorry for it . I will come and stop with you every now and then , when your health is better , and you ask me . But to live here altogether would not do ; I should like it too well , and do nothing else . "
97070	97076	97077	97077	he	1030	" Perhaps you are right , "
97108	97163	97077	97077	he	1030	" you are very young , my dear , and years should be allowed to pass before you know what full - grown sorrow is . You have had enough , for your age , of it . You had better not live in this house ; it is not a house for cheerfulness . "
97164	97176	97177	97177	I	0	" Then if I must neither live here nor at Bruntsea , "
97200	97235	97177	97177	I	0	" to what place in all the world am I to go , unless it is back to America ? I will go at once to Shoxford , and take lodgings of my own . "
97236	97246	97247	97248	Lord Castlewood	190	" Perhaps you had better wait a little while , "
97253	97360	97247	97248	Lord Castlewood	190	" although I would much rather have you at Shoxford than where you are at present . But please to remember , my good Erema , that you can not go to Shoxford all alone . I have a most faithful and trusty man the one who opened the door to you . He has been here before his remembrance . He disdains me still as compared with your father . Will you have him to superintend you ? I scarcely see how you can do any good , but if you do go , you must go openly , and as your father 's daughter . "
97361	97380	97381	97381	I	0	" I have no intention whatever of going in any other way , Lord Castlewood ; but perhaps , "
97384	97434	97381	97381	I	0	" it would be as well to make as little stir as possible . Of an English village I know nothing but the little I have seen at Bruntsea , but there they make a very great fuss about any one who comes down with a man - servant . "
97435	97440	97442	97443	my cousin	6288	" To be sure , "
97449	97490	97442	97443	my cousin	6288	" they would not be true Britons otherwise . Perhaps you would do better without Stixon ; but of course you must not go alone . Could you by any means persuade your old nurse Betsy to go with you ? "
97491	97506	97507	97507	I	0	" How good of you to think of it ! how wise you are ! "
97524	97623	97507	97507	I	0	" I am sure that if Betsy can come , she will ; though of course she must be compensated well for the waste all her lodgers will make of it . They are very wicked , and eat most dreadfully if she even takes one day 's holiday . What do you think they even do ? She has told me with tears in her eyes of it . They are all allowed a pat of butter , a penny roll , and two sardines for breakfast . No sooner do they know that her back is turned "
97624	97627	97629	97630	my cousin	6288	" Erema ! "
97696	97708	97709	97710	Lord Castlewood	190	" My dear , I did not mean to blame you , "
97716	97769	97709	97710	Lord Castlewood	190	" it must be a great relief for you to look on at other people . But tell me or rather , since you have told me almost every thing you know let me , if only in one way I can help you , help you at least in that way . "
98027	98036	98037	98037	he	190	" I have only a few minutes left , "
98040	98213	98037	98037	he	190	" during which I can say any thing . My time is divided into two sad parts : the time when I am capable of very little , and the time when I am capable of nothing ; and the latter part is twice the length of the other . For sixteen hours of every day , far better had I be dead than living , so far as our own little insolence may judge . But I speak of it only to excuse bad manners , and perhaps I show worse by doing so . I shall not be able to see you again until to - morrow morning . Do not go ; they will arrange all that . Send a note to Major Hockin by Stixon 's boy . Stixon and Mrs. Price will see to your comfort , if those who are free from pain require any other comfort . Forgive me ; I did not mean to be rude . Sometimes I can not help giving way . "
98312	98323	98325	98326	Mr. Stixon	298	" My lord will catch it stiff to - night , "
98345	98388	98325	98326	Mr. Stixon	298	" he always have it ten times worse after any talking or any thing to upset him like . And so , then , miss excuse a humble servant did I understand from him that you was the Captain 's own daughter ? "
98389	98416	98325	98326	Mr. Stixon	298	" Yes ; but surely your master wants you he is in such dreadful pain . Do please to go to him , and do something . "
98417	98427	98428	98428	Stixon	298	" There is nothing to be done , miss , "
98435	98528	98428	98428	Stixon	298	" he is bound to stay so for sixteen hours , and then he eases off again . But bless my heart , miss excuse me in your presence his lordship is thoroughly used to it . It is my certain knowledge that for seven years now he has never had seven minutes free from pain seven minutes all of a heap , I mean . Some do say , miss , as the Lord doeth every thing according to His righteousness , that the reason is not very far to seek . "
98567	98577	98578	98578	he	298	" A better man never lived than my lord , "
98589	98629	98578	98578	he	298	" but it has been said among censoorous persons that nobody ever had no luck as came in suddenly to a property and a high state of life on the top of the heads of a family of seven . "
98630	98636	98637	98637	I	0	" What a poor superstition ! "
98653	98686	98637	98637	I	0	" But what is your master 's malady , Stixon ? Surely there might be something done to relieve his violent pain , even if there is no real cure for it ? "
98687	98781	98637	98637	I	0	" No , miss , nothing can be done . The doctors have exorced themselves . They tried this , that , and the other , but nature only flew worse against them . ' Tis a thing as was never heard of till the Constitooshon was knocked on the head and to pieces by the Reform Bill . And though they could n't cure it , they done what they could do , miss . They discovered a very good name for it they christened it the ' New - rager ! ' "
99071	99074	99082	99082	he	2778	" inquisitive , "
99108	99183	99185	99187	the worthy man	2785	" Ah , your father , the Captain , now , he would have knowed what this is ! You 've no right to his eyes , Miss Erma , without his tongue and palate . No more of this , miss ! and done for you a - purpose ! Well , cook will be put out , and no mistake ! I better not let her see it go down , anyhow . "
99203	99220	99221	99221	I	0	" Lord Castlewood spoke to me about a Mrs. Price the housekeeper , is she not ? "
99244	99250	99252	99252	Stixon	298	" Oh yes , miss , "
99265	99307	99252	99252	Stixon	298	" If she is not too busy , I should like to see her as soon as these things are all taken away . I mean if she is not a stranger , and if she would like to see me . "

99463	99571	99455	99455	he	298	" Well , now , you did remind me uncommon of him then , miss . I could have heard the old lord speak almost , though he were always harsh and distant . And as I was going for to say , he catched me fifty years agone next Lammas - tide ; a pear - tree of an early sort it was ; you may see the very tree if you please to stand here , miss , though the pears is quite altered now , and scarcely fit to eat . Well , I was running off with my cap chock - full , miss "

99627	99665	99455	99455	he	298	" Oh no , Miss Erma , no reason at all . Only please to bear in mind , miss , that she is a coorous woman . She is that jealous , and I might say forward "
99666	99676	99455	99455	he	298	" Then she is capable of speaking for herself . "

And the shock of that sight at Bristol flew to his weakness , and was too much for him . And now this third and worst disaster , coming upon him where his best hope lay , and at such a time of life , took him altogether off his legs . And off his head too , I might almost say , miss ; for , instead of blaming her , he put the fault entirely upon himself . At his time of life , and in such poor health , he should not have married a bright young girl : how could he ever hope to make her happy ? That was how he looked at it , when he should have sent constables after her . "

And my lord received him as a young fellow - countryman under a cloud , and lent him money , and saved him from starving ; for he had broken with his father and was running from his creditors . "

She used to call me ' Jacob Diggs , ' because of my porochial office , with a meaning of a joke on my parenshal name . Ah , what a merry one she were ! And now this is what I has to do for her ! And sooner would I ' a doed it a'most for my own old ooman ! "

He do n't do nothing but lounge on the front of his desk , and be too lazy to keep up ' Amen , ' while I at my time of life go about , from Absolution to the fifth Lord 's prayer , with a stick that makes my rheumatics worse , for the sake of the boys with their pocket full of nuts . When I was a boy there was no nuts , except at the proper time of year , a month or two on from this time of speaking ; and we used to crack they in the husk , and make no noise to disturb the congregation ; but now it is nuts , nuts , round nuts , flat nuts , nuts with three corners to them all the year round nuts to crack , and me to find out who did it !

108038	108066	108027	108027	he	3148	" is it not Mrs. Rigg , your good wife , who sells all the nuts on a Saturday for the boys to crack on a Sunday ? "

108096	108175	108027	108027	he	3148	" Then surely , Mr. Rigg , you might stop it , by not permitting any sale of nuts except to good boys of high principles . And has it not happened sometimes , Mr. Rigg , that boys have made marks on their nuts , and bought them again at your shop on a Monday ? I mean , of course , when your duty has compelled you to empty the pockets of a boy in church . "

There you stand , miss , and here stand I , as have n't seen your father for a score of years a'most ; and yet there comes out of your eyes into mine the very same look as the Captain used to send , when snakes in the grass had been telling lies about me coming late , or having my half pint or so on . Not that the Captain was a hard man , miss far otherwise , and capable of allowance , more than any of the women be . But only the Lord , who doeth all things aright , could ' a made you come , with a score of years atween , and the twinkle in your eyes like Selah ! "

109562	109605	109543	109544	old Jacob	262	" Where we stand is a queer sort of echo , which goeth in and out of them big tombstones . And for aught I can say to contrairy , he may be a - watching of us while here we stand . "

109718	109884	109715	109715	he	3159	" and this is where I caught him , one evening when I were tired , and gone to nurse my knees a bit . Let me see why , let me see ! Do n't you speak till I do , miss . Were it the last but one I dug ? Or could un ' a been the last but two ? Never mind ; I ca n't call to mind quite justly . We puts down about one a month in this parish , without any distemper or haxident . Well , it must ' a been the one afore last to be sure , no call to scratch my head about un . Old Sally Mock , as sure as I stand here done handsome by the rate - payers . Over there , miss , if you please to look about two land - yard and a half away . Can you see un with the grass peeking up a'ready ? "
109885	109898	110305	110305	he	908	" Never mind that , Jacob . Do please to go on . "
109899	110070	110297	110299	the old man	908	" So I be , miss . So I be doing to the best of the power granted me . Well , I were in this little knuckle of a squat , where old Sally used to say as I went to sleep , and charged the parish for it a spiteful old ooman , and I done her grave with pleasure , only wishing her had to pay for it ; and to prove to her mind that I never goed asleep here , I was just making ready to set fire to my pipe , having cocked my shovel in to ease my legs , like this , when from round you corner of the chancel - foot , and over again that there old tree , I seed a something movin ' along movin ' along , without any noise or declarance of solid feet walking . You may see the track burnt in the sod , if you let your eyes go along this here finger . "
110071	110085	109715	109715	he	3159	" Oh , Jacob , how could you have waited to see it ? "
110086	110257	110305	110305	he	908	" I did , miss , I did ; being used to a - many antics in this dead - yard , such as a man who had n't buried them might up foot to run away from . But they no right , after the service of the Church , to come up for more than one change of the moon , unless they been great malefactors . And then they be ashamed of it ; and I reminds them of it . ' Amen , ' I say , in the very same voice as I used at the tail of their funerals ; and then they knows well that I covered them up , and the most uneasy goes back again . Lor ' bless you , miss , I no fear of the dead . At both ends of life us be harmless . It is in the life , and mostways in the middle of it , we makes all the death for one another . "
110283	110296	110297	110299	the old man	908	" Well , that there figure were no joke , mind you , "
110317	110565	110305	110305	he	908	" being tall and grim , and white in the face , and very onpleasant for to look at , and its eyes seemed a'most to burn holes in the air . No sooner did I see that it were not a ghostie , but a living man the same as I be , than my knees begins to shake and my stumps of teeth to chatter . And what do you think it was stopped me , miss , from slipping round this corner , and away by belfry ? Nort but the hoddest idea you ever heared on . For all of a suddint it was borne unto my mind that the Lord had been pleased to send us back the Captain ; not so handsome as he used to be , but in the living flesh , however , in spite of they newspapers . And I were just at the pint of coming forrard , out of this here dark cornder , knowing as I had done my duty by them graves that his honor , to my mind , must ' a come looking after , when , lucky for me , I see summat in his walk , and then in his countenance , and then in all his features , unnateral on the Captain 's part , whatever his time of life might be . And sure enough , miss , it were no Captain more nor I myself be . "
110566	110583	110305	110305	he	908	" Of course not . How could it be ? But who was it , Jacob ? "
110584	110881	110305	110305	he	908	" You bide a bit , miss , and you shall hear the whole . Well , by that time ' twas too late for me to slip away , and I was bound to scrooge up into the elbow of this nick here , and try not to breathe , as nigh as might be , and keep my Lammas cough down ; for I never see a face more full of malice and uncharity . However , he come on as straight as a arrow , holding his long chin out , like this , as if he gotten crutches under it , as the folk does with bad water . A tall man , as tall as the Captain a'most , but not gifted with any kind aspect . He trampsed over the general graves , like the devil come to fetch their souls out ; but when he come here to the ' holy ring , ' he stopped short , and stood with his back to me . I could hear him count the seven graves , as pat as the shells of oysters to pay for , and then he said all their names , as true , from the biggest to the leastest one , as Betsy Bowen could ' a done it , though none of 'em got no mark to 'em . Oh , the poor little hearts , it was cruel hard upon them ! And then my lady in the middle , making seven . So far as I could catch over his shoulder , he seemed to be quite a - talking with her not as you and I be , miss , but a sort of a manner of a way , like . "
110882	110903	110305	110305	he	908	" And what did he seem to say ? Oh , Jacob , how long you do take over it ! "
110904	110996	110305	110305	he	908	" Well , he did not , miss ; that you may say for sartain . And glad I was to have him quick about it ; for he might have redooced me to such a condition ay , and I believe a ' would , too , if onst a ' had caught sight of me as the parish might ' a had to fight over the appintment of another sexton . And so at last a ' went away . And I were that stiff with scrooging in this cornder "
110997	111040	110305	110305	he	908	" Is that all ? Oh , that comes to nothing . Surely you must have more to tell me ? It may have been some one who knew our names . It may have been some old friend of the family . "
111041	111140	111141	111142	Mr. Rigg	315	" No , miss , no ! No familiar friend ; or if he was , he were like King David 's . He bore a tyrannous hate against ' e , and the poison of asps were under his lips . In this here hattitude he stood , with his back toward me , and his reins more upright than I be capable of putting it . And this was how he held up his elbow and his head . Look ' e see , miss , and then ' e know as much as I do . "
111260	111273	111274	111274	he	262	" That warn't quite right , miss . Now you look again , "
111282	111329	111274	111274	he	262	" Only he had a thing over one shoulder , the like of what the Scotchmen wear ; and his features was beyond me , because of the back of his head , like . For God 's sake keep out of his way , miss . "
111380	111389	111390	111390	I	0	" What a very odd way to stand ! "
111393	111468	111390	111390	I	0	" Yes , miss . And what he said was odder . ' Six , and the mother ! ' I heared un say ; ' no cure for it , till I have all seven . ' But stop , miss . Not a breath to any one ! Here comes the poor father and mother to speak the blessing across their daughter 's grave and the grave not two foot down yet ! "
112198	112354	112195	112195	he	262	" No ; it was nothing of the sort . Deep he had gone , to the tiptoe of his fling ; not from any feeling of a wish to keep her down , but just because the parish paid , and the parish would have measurement . And when that was on , he never brought down more than the quart tin from the public ; and never had none down afterward . Otherwise the ground was so ticklish , that a man , working too free , might stay down there . No , no ! That idea was like one of Sally 's own . He just had his quart of Persfield ale short measure , of course , with a woman at the bar and if that were enough to make a man dream dreams , the sooner he dug his own grave , the better for all connected with him .

113940	113952	113954	113955	Lord Castlewood	190	" The question is natural , and not at all improper , "
113971	114024	113954	113955	Lord Castlewood	190	" Indeed , I expected you to ask me that before . But , Erema , I have also had to ask myself about it , whether I have any right to answer you . And I have decided not to do so , unless you will pledge yourself to one thing . "
114025	114034	114035	114035	I	0	" I will pledge myself to any thing , "
114040	114060	114035	114035	I	0	" I do not care what it is , if only to get at the bottom of this mystery . "
114061	114115	113954	113955	Lord Castlewood	190	" I scarcely think you will hold good to your words when you hear what you have to promise . The condition upon which I tell you what I believe to be the cause of all is , that you let things remain as they are , and keep silence forever about them . "
114116	114129	114130	114130	I	0	" Oh , you can not be so cruel , so atrocious ! "
114138	114172	114130	114130	I	0	" What good would it be for me to know things thus , and let the vile wrong continue ? Surely you are not bound to lay on me a condition so impossible ? "
114173	114194	113954	113955	Lord Castlewood	190	" After much consideration and strong wish to have it otherwise , I have concluded that I am so bound . "
114195	114221	113954	113955	Lord Castlewood	190	" In duty to my father , or the family , or what ? Forgive me for asking , but it does seem so hard . "
114222	114237	114238	114238	he	3248	" It seems hard , my dear , and it is hard as well , "
114257	114292	114238	114238	he	3248	" But remember that I do not know , I only guess , the secret ; and if you give the pledge I speak of , you merely follow in your father 's steps . "
114293	114296	114297	114297	I	0	" Never , "
114308	114352	114297	114297	I	0	" It may have been my father 's duty , or no doubt he thought it so ; but it can not be mine , unless I make it so by laying it on my honor . And I will not do that . "
114353	114425	114238	114238	he	3248	" Perhaps you are right ; but , at any rate , remember that I have not tried to persuade you . I wish to do what is for your happiness , Erema . And I think that , on the whole , with your vigor and high spirit , you are better as you are than if you had a knowledge which you could only brood over and not use . "
114426	114437	114438	114438	I	0	" I will find out the whole of it myself , "
114449	114500	114438	114438	I	0	" and then I need not brood over it , but may have it out and get justice . In the wildest parts of America justice comes with perseverance : am I to abjure it in the heart of England ? Lord Castlewood , which is first justice or honor ? "
114501	114541	114238	114238	he	3248	" My cousin , you are fond of asking questions difficult to answer . Justice and honor nearly always go together . When they do otherwise , honor stands foremost , with people of good birth , at least . "
114542	114589	114438	114438	I	0	" Then I will be a person of very bad birth . If they come into conflict in my life , as almost every thing seems to do , my first thought shall be of justice ; and honor shall come in as its ornament afterward . "
114590	114593	114595	114596	my cousin	6288	" Erema , "
114598	114623	114595	114596	my cousin	6288	" your meaning is good , and at your time of life you can scarcely be expected to take a dispassionate view of things . "
114635	114641	114595	114596	my cousin	6288	" dispassionate view of things . "
114674	114677	114595	114596	my cousin	6288	" dispassionately , "
115066	115072	115073	115073	she	299	" Oh dear , no ! "
115128	115203	115111	115111	she	299	" oh dear , no , Miss Castlewood ! We who know and watch him should detect any difference of that nature at the moment of its occurrence . His lordship 's health goes vacillating ; a little up now , and then a little down , like a needle that is mounted to show the dip of compass ; and it varies according to the electricity , as well as the magnetic influence . "
115204	115211	115212	115212	I	0	" What doctor told you that ? "
115227	115231	115232	115232	she	299	" You are very "
115237	115240	115232	115232	she	299	" rude , "
115251	115279	115245	115245	she	299	" well , you are rather brusque , as we used to call it abroad , Miss Castlewood ; but am I incapable of observing for myself ? "
115280	115286	115288	115288	my	0	" I never implied that , "
115291	115329	115245	115245	she	299	" I believe that you are most intelligent , and fit to nurse my cousin , as you are to keep his house . And what you have said shows the clearness of your memory and expression . "
115330	115339	115340	115340	she	299	" You are very good to speak so , "
115367	115407	115340	115340	she	299	" Oh , what a clap of thunder ! Are you timid ? This house has been struck three times , they say . It stands so prominently . It is this that has made my lord look so . "
115408	115423	115424	115424	I	0	" Let us hope , then to see him much better to - morrow , "
115442	115471	115424	115424	I	0	" What are these storms you get in England compared to the tropical outbursts ? Let us open the window , if you please , and watch it . "
115472	115478	115479	115480	Mrs. Price	299	" I hear myself called , "
115483	115512	115479	115480	Mrs. Price	299	" I am sorry to leave you , miss . You know best . But please not to sit by an open window ; nothing is more dangerous . "
115513	115522	115523	115523	I	0	" Except a great bunch of steel keys , "
115737	115835	115735	115735	Stixon	298	" Lor ' , miss ! Lor ' , what a burning shame of Prick ! ' Prick ' we call her , in our genial moments , hearing as the ' k ' is hard in Celtic language ; and all abroad about her husband . My very first saying to you was , not to be too much okkipied with her . Look at the pinafore on her ! Lord be with me ! If his lordship , as caught me , that day of this very same month fifty years , in the gooseberry bush "
115836	115841	115842	115842	I	0	" To be sure ! "
115857	115895	115842	115842	I	0	" but things are altered since that day . Nothing can be more to your credit , I am sure , than to be able to tell such a tale in the very place where it happened . "
115896	115911	115735	115735	Stixon	298	" But , Miss Miss Erma , I ai n't begun to tell it . "
115912	116003	116004	116005	Mr. Stixon	298	" Because you remember that I am acquainted with it . A thing so remarkable is not to be forgotten . Now let me ask you a question of importance ; and I beg you , as an old servant of this family , to answer it carefully and truly . Do you remember any one , either here or elsewhere , so like my father , Captain Castlewood , as to be taken for him at first sight , until a difference of expression and of walk was noticed ? "
116032	116040	116041	116041	He	298	" Let me see like the Captain ? "
116045	116128	116041	116041	He	298	" Did I ever see a gentleman like poor Master George , as was ? A gentleman , of course , it must have been and a very tall , handsome , straight gentleman , to be taken anyhow for young Master George . And he must have been very like him , too , to be taken for him by resemblance . Well then , miss , to the best of my judgment , I never did see such a gentleman . "
116129	116142	116143	116143	I	0	" I do n't know whether it was a gentleman or not , "
116154	116165	116143	116143	I	0	" but he carried his chin stretched forth like this . "
116191	116205	116207	116208	the butler	3243	" Lor ' , now , and he carried his chin like that ! "
116220	116293	116207	116208	the butler	3243	" Why , let me see , now , let me see . Something do come across my mind when you puts out your purty chin , miss ; but there , it must have been a score of years agone , or more perhaps five - and - twenty . What a daft old codger I be getting , surely ! No wonder them new lights puts a bushel over me . "
116294	116297	116298	116298	I	0	" No , "
116301	116407	116298	116298	I	0	" you are simply showing great power of memory , Stixon . And now please to tell me , as soon as you can , who it was a tall man , remember , and a handsome one , with dark hair , perhaps , or at any rate dark eyes who resembled perhaps not very closely , but still enough to mislead at a distance my dear father Master George , as you call him , for whose sake you are bound to tell me every thing you know . Now try to think do please try your very best , for my sake . "
116408	116520	116521	116522	Mr. Stixon	298	" That I will , miss ; that I will , with all my heart , with all my mind , with all my soul , and with all my strength , as I used to have to say with my hands behind my back , afore education were invented . Only please you to stand with your chin put out , miss , and your profield towards me . That is what brings it up , and nothing else at all , miss . Only , not to say a word of any sort to hurry me . A tracherous and a deep thing is the memory and the remembrance . "
116572	116591	116592	116594	the old man	908	" I got it now ; I got it all , miss , clear as any pictur ' ! "
116609	116625	116592	116594	the old man	908	" Please to leave off ; I am sure it is too much for you . "
116626	116712	116592	116594	the old man	908	" Not a pictur ' in all of our gallery , miss , two - and - fifty of 'em , so clear as I see that there man , dark as it was , and a heavy wind a - blowing . What you call them things , miss , if you please , as comes with the sun , like a face upon the water ? Wicked things done again the will of the Lord , and He makes them fade out afterwards . "
116713	116724	116592	116594	the old man	908	" Perhaps you mean photographs . Is that the word ? "
116725	116929	116592	116594	the old man	908	" The very word , and no mistake . A sinful trespass on the works of God , to tickle the vanity of gals . But he never spread himself abroad like them . They shows all their ear - rings , and their necks , and smiles . But he never would have shown his nose , if he could help it , that stormy night when I come to do my duty . He come into this house without so much as a ' by your leave ' to nobody , and vexed me terrible accordingly . It was in the old lord 's time , you know , miss , a one of the true sort , as would have things respectful , and knock down any man as soon as look . And it put me quite upon the touch - and - go , being responsible for all the footman 's works , and a young boy promoted in the face of my opinion , having my own son worth a dozen of him . This made me look at the nature of things , miss , and find it on my conscience to be after every body . "
116930	116962	116592	116594	the old man	908	" Yes , Stixon , yes ! Now do go on . You must always have been , not only after , but a very long way after , every body . "
116963	117161	116592	116594	the old man	908	" Miss Erma , if you throw me out , every word goes promiscuous . In a heffort of the mind like this it is every word , or no word . Now , did I see him come along the big passage ? a ' currydoor ' they call it now , though no more curry in it than there is door . No , I never seed him come along the passage , and that made it more reproachful . He come out of a green - baize door the very place I can point out to you , and the selfsame door , miss , though false to the accuracy of the mind that knows it , by reason of having been covered up red , and all the brass buttons lost to it in them new - fangled upholsteries . Not that I see him come through , if you please , but the sway of the door , being double - jointed , was enough to show legs , had been there . And knowing that my lord 's private room was there , made me put out my legs quite wonderful . "
117162	117176	116592	116594	the old man	908	" Oh , do please to put out your words half as quickly . "
117177	117238	116592	116594	the old man	908	" No , miss , no . I were lissome in those days , though not so very stiff at this time of speaking , and bound to be guarded in the guidance of the tongue . And now , miss , I think if you please to hear the rest to - morrow , I could tell it better . "
117346	117359	117361	117365	the well - coaxed Stixon	3273	" So then , Miss Erma , if I must go on , "
117367	118082	117361	117365	the well - coaxed Stixon	3273	" if my duty to the family driveth me to an ' arrowing subjeck , no words can more justly tell what come to pass than my language to my wife . She were alive then , the poor dear hangel , and the mother of seven children , which made me , by your leave comparing humble roofs with grandeur , a little stiff to him up stairs , as come in on the top of seven . For I said to my wife when I went home sleeping out of the house , you see , miss , till the Lord was pleased to dissolve matrimony ' Polly , ' I said , when I took home my supper , ' you may take my word for it there is something queer . ' Not another word did I mean to tell her , as behooved my dooty . Howsoever , no peace was my lot till I made a clean bosom of it , only putting her first on the Testament , and even that not safe with most of them . And from that night not a soul has heard a word till it comes to you , miss . He come striding along , with his face muffled up , for all the world like a bugglar , and no more heed did he pay to me than if I was one of the pedestals . But I were in front of him at the door , and to slip out so was against all orders . So in front of him I stands , with my hand upon the handles , and meaning to have a word with him , to know who he was , and such like , and how he comes there , and what he had been seeking , with the spoons and the forks and the gravies on my mind . And right I would have been in a court of law if the lawyers was put out of it for my hefforts in that situation . And then , what do you think he done , miss ? So far from entering into any conversation with me , or hitting at me , like a man which would have done good to think of he send out one hand to the bottom of my vest as they call it now in all the best livery tailors and afore I could reason on it , there I was a - lying on a star in six colors of marble . When I come to think on it , it was but a push directed to a part of my system , and not a hit under the belt , the like of which no Briton would think of delivering . Nevertheless , there was no differ in what came to me , miss , and my spirit was roused , as if I had been hit foul by one of the prizemen . No time to get up , but I let out one foot at his long legs as a ' was slipping through the door , and so nearly did I fetch him over that he let go his muffle to balance himself with the jamb , and same moment a strong rush of wind laid bare the whole of his wicked face to me . For a bad wicked face it was , as ever I did see ; whether by reason of the kick I gave , and a splinter in the shin , or by habit of the mind , a proud and ' aughty and owdacious face , and , as I said to my poor wife , reminded me a little of our Master George ; not in his ordinary aspect , to be sure , but as Master George might look if he was going to the devil . Pray excoose me , miss , for bad words , but no good ones will do justice . And so off he goes , after one look at me on the ground , not worth considering , with his chin stuck up , as if the air was not good enough to be breathed perpendiklar like . "
118083	118091	118092	118092	I	0	" And of course you followed him , "
118105	118114	118097	118097	Stixon	298	" Without any delay you went after him . "
118115	118207	117361	117365	the well - coaxed Stixon	3273	" Miss Erma , you forget what my dooty was . My dooty was to stay by the door and make it fast , as custodian of all this mansion . No little coorosity , or private resentment , could ' a borne me out in doing so . As an outraged man I was up for rushing out , but as a trusted official , and responsible head footman , miss for I were not butler till nine months after that my dooty was to put the big bolt in . "
118208	118241	117361	117365	the well - coaxed Stixon	3273	" And you did it , without even looking out to see if he tried to set the house on fire ! Oh , Stixon , I fear that you were frightened . "
118242	118374	118097	118097	Stixon	298	" Now , Miss Erma , I calls it ungrateful , after all my hefforts to obleege you , to put a bad construction upon me . You hurts me , miss , in my tenderest parts , as I never thought Master George 's darter would ' a doed . But there , they be none of them as they used to be ! Master George would ' a said , if he ever had heard it . ' Stixon , my man , you have acted for the best , and showed a sound discretion . Stixon , ' he would have said , ' here 's a George and Dragon in reward of your gallant conduck . ' Ah , that sort of manliness is died out now . "
118504	118513	118492	118492	he	298	" the half is more than the whole . "
118531	118544	118545	118545	I	0	" Now , when you were able to get up at last , "
118552	118572	118545	118545	I	0	" what did you see , and what did you do , and what conclusion did you come to ? "
118573	118788	118855	118856	A WITCH	3275	" I came to the conclusion , miss , that I were hurt considerable . Coorosity on my part were quenched by the way as I had to rub myself . But a man is a man , and the last thing to complain of is the exercise of his functions . And when I come round I went off to his lordship , as if I had heared his bell ring . All of us knew better than to speak till him beginning , for he were not what they now call ' halfable , ' but very much to the contrary . So he says , ' You door - skulker , what do you want there ? ' And I see that he got his hot leg up , certain to fly to bad language . According , I asked , with my breath in my hand , if he pleased to see any young man there just now , by reason that such likes had been observated going out in some direction . But his lordship roared to me to go in another direction , not fit for young ladies . My old lord was up to every word of English ; but his present lordship is the hopposite extreme . "
118789	118818	118545	118545	I	0	" Is that all you have to tell me , Stixon ? Did you never see that fearful man again ? Did you never even hear of him ? "
118819	118852	118855	118856	A WITCH	3275	" Never , miss , never ! And to nobody but you have I ever told all as I told now . But you seems to be born to hear it all . "
119547	119558	119559	119560	Lord Castlewood	190	" You must not return to Shoxford , my cousin , "
119589	119664	119559	119560	Lord Castlewood	190	" I can not allow you to be there without strict supervision and protection . You will not , perhaps , be aware of it , as perhaps you have not been before ; but a careful watch will be kept on you . I merely tell you this that you may not make mistakes , and confound friendly vigilance with the spying of an enemy . Erema , you will be looked after . "

121344	121527	121334	121335	the Major	1607	" Oh , Miss Castlewood ! I did not see you . Pardon me ! It is the want of practice only ; so wholly have you deserted us . Fallen into better hands , of course . Well , how are you ? But I need not ask . If ever there was a young lady who looked well do n't tell me of troubles , or worries , or nerves I put up my glasses , and simply say , ' Pretty young ladies are above all pity ! ' My hammer , dear Mary ; my hammer I must have . The geological one , you know ; we have come on a bit of old Roman work ; the bricklayer 's hammers go flat , like lead . I have just one minute and a half to spare . What fine fellows those Romans were ! I will build like a Roman . See to every bit of it myself , Erema . No contractor 's jobs for me . Mary , you know where to find it . "
121528	121566	121656	121657	the Major	1607	" Well , dear , I think that you had it last , to get the bung out of the beer barrel , when the stool broke down in the corner , you know , because you would "
121567	121594	121656	121657	the Major	1607	" Never mind about that . The drayman made a fool of himself . I proceeded upon true principles . That fellow knew nothing of leverage . "
121595	121636	121637	121638	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Well , dear , of course you understand it best . But he told cook that it was quite a mercy that you got off without a broken leg ; and compared with that , two gallons of spilled ale "

122781	122811	122778	122778	I	0	" in my ignorance of all the changes you have made , the reason why we do not see her may be that she is gone out of sight . "

We stood at the very end and last corner of the ancient river trough , where a little seam went inland from it , as if some trifle of a brook had stolen down while it found a good river to welcome it . But now there was only a little oozy gloss from the gleam of the sun upon some lees of marshy brine left among the rushes by the last high tide . "

Without any such headlong speed , we soon came to the dwelling - place of the stranger , and really for once the good Major had not much overdone his description . Truly it was almost tumbling down , though massively built , and a good house long ago ; and it looked the more miserable now from being placed in a hollow of the ground , whose slopes were tufted with rushes and thistles and ragwort . The lower windows were blocked up from within , the upper were shattered and crumbling and dangerous , with blocks of cracked stone jutting over them ; and the last surviving chimney gave less smoke than a workman 's homeward whiff of his pipe to comfort and relieve the air . The only door that we could see was of heavy black oak , without any knocker ; but I clinched my hand , having thick gloves on , and made what I thought a very creditable knock , while the Major stood by , with his blue - lights up , and keenly gazed and gently smiled .

123761	123787	123788	123788	My	0	" With hot indignation he swung his hammer , but nothing came of it except more noise . Then the Major grew warm and angry . "
123859	123894	123850	123850	I	0	" For we thought we heard a little screech of laughter from the loneliness of the deep dark place , but no other answer came , and perhaps it was only our own imagining . "

124242	124337	124202	124202	their	3436	" and this I did when necessary , for his principles of action were beyond all challenge , and the only question was how he carried them out . He took me to his rampart , which was sure to stop the sea , and at the same time to afford the finest place in all Great Britain for a view of it . Even an invalid might sit here in perfect shelter from the heaviest gale , and watch such billows as were not to be seen except upon the Major 's property . "
124346	124350	124352	124353	a child	762	" he said , "
124449	124450	124429	124429	You	3441	" "
124461	124465	124429	124429	You	3441	" I said . "
124476	124897	124898	124899	Aunt Mary	239	" The Major smiled a superior smile , and after more talk we went home to dinner . From something more than mere curiosity , I waited at Bruntsea for a day or two , hoping to see that strange namesake of mine who had shown so much inhospitality . For she must have been at home when we made that pressing call , inasmuch as there was no other place to hide her within the needful distance of the spot where she had stood . But the longer I waited , the less would she come out to borrow the good Irishman 's expression and the Major 's pillar - box , her favorite resort , was left in conspicuous solitude . And when a letter came from Sir Montague Hockin , asking leave to be at Bruntlands on the following evening , I packed up my goods with all haste , and set off , not an hour too soon , for Shoxford . But before taking leave of these kind friends , I begged them to do for me one little thing , without asking me to explain my reason , which , indeed , was more than I could do . I begged them , not of course to watch Sir Montague , for that they could not well do to a guest , but simply to keep their eyes open and prepared for any sign of intercourse , if such there were , between this gentleman and that strange interloper . Major Hockin stared , and his wife looked at me as if my poor mind must have gone astray , and even to myself my own thought appeared absurd . Remembering , however , what Sir Montague had said , and other little things as well , I did not laugh as they did . But perhaps one part of my conduct was not right , though the wrong if any had been done before that to wit , I had faithfully promised Mrs. Price not to say a word at Bruntlands about their visitor 's low and sinful treachery toward my cousin . To give such a promise had perhaps been wrong , but still without it I should have heard nothing of matters that concerned me nearly . And now it seemed almost worse to keep than to break such a pledge , when I thought of a pious , pure - minded , and holy - hearted woman , like my dear "
124901	124961	124898	124899	Aunt Mary	239	" unwittingly brought into friendly contact with a man of the lowest nature . And as for the Major , instead of sitting down with such a man to dinner , what would he have done but drive him straightway from the door , and chase him to the utmost verge of his manor with the peak end of his "
124965	125082	124898	124899	Aunt Mary	239	" However , away I went without a word against that contemptible and base man , toward whom though he never had injured me I cherished , for my poor cousin 's sake , the implacable hatred of virtuous youth . And a wild idea had occurred to me as many wild ideas did now in the crowd of things gathering round me that this strange woman , concealed from the world , yet keenly watching some members of it , might be that fallen and miserable creature who had fled from a good man with a bad one , because he was more like herself Flittamore , Lady Castlewood . Not that she could be an "
125085	125154	124898	124899	Aunt Mary	239	" yet , but she might look old , either by disguise , or through her own wickedness ; and every body knows how suddenly those southern beauties fall off , alike in face and figure . Mrs. Price had not told me what became of her , or even whether she was dead or alive , but merely said , with a meaning look , that she was "
125156	125333	124898	124899	Aunt Mary	239	" for her sin , and I had not ventured to inquire how , the subject being so distasteful . To my great surprise , and uneasiness as well , I had found at Bruntlands no letter whatever , either to the Major or myself , from Uncle Sam or any other person at the saw - mills . There had not been time for any answer to my letter of some two months back , yet being alarmed by the Sawyer 's last tidings , I longed , with some terror , for later news . And all the United Kingdom was now watching with tender interest the dismemberment , as it almost appeared , of the other mighty Union . Not with malice , or snug satisfaction , as the men of the North in their agony said , but certainly without any proper anguish yet , and rather as a genial and sprightly spectator , whose love of fair play perhaps kindles his applause of the spirit and skill of the weaker side . "
125345	126107	125340	125340	them	3446	" seemed to be the general sentiment ; but in spite of some American vaunt and menace which of late years had been galling every true Englishman deeply would have mourned the humiliation of his kindred . In this anxiety for news I begged that my letters might be forwarded under cover to the postmistress at Shoxford , and bearing my initials . For now I had made up my mind to let Mrs. Busk know whatever I could tell her . I had found her a cross and well - educated woman , far above her neighbors , and determined to remain so . Gossip , that universal leveler , theoretically she despised ; and she had that magnificent esteem for rank which works so beautifully in England . And now when my good nurse reasonably said that , much as she loved to be with me , her business would allow that delight no longer , and it also came home to my own mind that money would be running short again , and small hope left in this dreadful civil war of our nugget escaping pillage which made me shudder horribly at internal discord , I just did this I dismissed Betsy , or rather I let her dismiss herself , which she might not have altogether meant to do , although she threatened it so often . For here she had nothing to do but live well , and protest against tricks of her own profession which she practiced as necessary laws at home ; and so , with much affection , for the time we parted . Mrs. Busk was delighted at her departure , for she never had liked to be criticised so keenly while she was doing her very best . And as soon as the wheels of Betsy 's fly had shown their last spoke at the corner , she told me , with a smile , that her mind had been made up to give us notice that very evening to seek for better lodgings . But she could not wish for a quieter , pleasanter , or more easily pleased young lady than I was without any mischief - maker ; and so , on the spur of the moment , I took her into my own room , while her little girl minded the shop , and there and then I told her who I was , and what I wanted . And now she behaved most admirably . Instead of expressing surprise , she assured me that all along she had felt there was something , and that I must be somebody . Lovely as my paintings were which I never heard , before or since , from any impartial censor , she had known that it could not be that alone which had kept me so long in their happy valley . And now she did hope I would do her the honor to stay beneath her humble roof , though entitled to one so different . And was the fairy ring in the church - yard made of all my family ? I replied that too surely this was so , and that nothing would please me better than to find , according to my stature , room to sleep inside it as soon as ever I should have solved the mystery of its origin . At the moment this was no exaggeration , so depressing was the sense of fighting against the unknown so long , with scarcely any one to stand by me , or avenge me if I fell . And Betsy 's departure , though I tried to take it mildly , had left me with a readiness to catch my breath . But to dwell upon sadness no more than need be a need as sure as hunger , it was manifest now to my wondering mind that once more I had chanced upon a good , and warm , and steadfast heart . Every body is said to be born , whether that happens by night or day , with a certain little widowed star , which has lost its previous mortal , concentrating from a billion billion of miles , or leagues , or larger measure , intense , but generally invisible , radiance upon him or her ; and to take for the moment this old fable as of serious meaning , my star was to find bad facts at a glance , but no bad folk without long gaze .

130971	130984	130985	130985	she	3580	" In the first place , I know every letter from Nepheton , "
130991	131174	130985	130985	she	3580	" There are only fourteen people that write letters in the place , and twelve of those fourteen buy their paper in my shop there is no shop at all at Nepheton . In the next place , none of them could write a hand like that , except the parson and the doctor , who are far above disguise . And two other things made me certain as could be . That letter was written at the ' Green Man ' ale - house ; not on their paper , nor yet with their ink ; but being in great hurry , it was dusted with their sand a sand that turns red upon ink , miss . And the time of dispatch there is just what he would catch , by walking fast after his dig where you saw him , going in that direction too , and then having his materials ready to save time . And if all that is not enough to convince you , miss you remember that you told me our old sexton 's tale ? "
131175	131207	130985	130985	she	3580	" To be sure I do . The first evening I was left alone here . And you have been so kind , there is nothing I would hide from you . "
131208	131636	130985	130985	she	3580	" Well , miss , the time of old Jacob 's tale is fixed by the death of poor old Sally Mock ; and the stranger came again after you were here , just before the death of the miller 's eldest daughter , and you might almost have seen him . Poor thing ! we all called her the ' flower of the Moon , ' meaning our little river . What a fine young woman she was , to be sure ! Whenever we heard of any strangers about , we thought they were prowling after her . I was invited to her funeral , and I went , and nothing could be done nicer . But they never will be punctual with burials here ; they like to dwell on them , and keep the bell going , for the sake of the body , and the souls that must come after it . And so , when it was done , I was twenty minutes late for the up mail and the cross - country post , and had to move my hands pretty sharp , I can assure you . That does n't matter ; I got through it , with the driver of the cart obliging , by means of some beer and cold bacon . But what I feared most was the Nepheton bag , having seen the old man at the funeral , and knowing what they do afterward . I could not return him ' too late ' again , or he would lose his place for certain , and a shilling a day made all the difference to him , between wife and no wife . The old pair without it must go to the workhouse , and never see one another . However , when I was despairing quite of him , up he comes with his bag quite correct , but only one letter to sort in it , and that letter was , miss , the very identical of the one you held in your hands just now . And a letter as like it as two peas had come when we buried old Sally . It puzzled me then , but I had no clew to it ; only now , you see , putting this and that together , the things we behold must have some meaning for us ; and to let them go without it is against the will of God ; especially when at the bottom of the bag . "
131637	131650	131651	131651	I	0	" If you hear so soon of any stranger in the valley , "
131665	131688	131651	131651	I	0	" how can that man come and go a man of remarkable stature and appearance without any body asking who he is ? "
131689	131828	130985	130985	she	3580	" You scarcely could have put it better , miss , for me to give the answer . They do ask who he is , and they want to know it , and would like any body to tell them . But being of a different breed , as they are , from all outside the long valley , speaking also with a different voice , they fear to talk so freely out of their own ways and places . Any thing they can learn in and out among themselves , they will learn ; but any thing out of that they let go , in the sense of outlandish matter . Bless you , miss , if your poor grandfather had been shot any where else in England , how different it would have been for him ! "
131829	131853	130985	130985	she	3580	" For us , you mean , Mrs. Busk . Do you think the man who did it had that in his mind ? "
131854	131946	130985	130985	she	3580	" Not unless he knew the place , as few know it . No , that was an accident of his luck , as many other things have been . But the best luck stops at last , Miss Erema ; and unless I am very much mistaken , you will be the stop of his . I shall find out , in a few days , where he came from , where he staid , and when he went away . I suppose you mean to let him go away ? "
131947	131955	131956	131956	I	0	" What else am I to do ? "
131959	131984	131956	131956	I	0	" I have no evidence at all against him ; only my own ideas . The police would scarcely take it up , even if "
131985	132182	130985	130985	she	3580	" Oh , do n't talk of them . They spoil every thing . And none of our people would say a word , or care to help us , if it came to that . The police are all strangers , and our people hate them . And , indeed , I believe that the worst thing ever done was the meddling of that old Jobbins . The old stupe is still alive at Petersfield , and as pompous - headed as ever . My father would have been the man for your sad affair , miss , if the police had only been invented in his time . Ah , yes , he was sharp ! Not a Moonstock man you may take your oath of that , miss but a good honest native from Essex . But he married my mother , a Moonstock woman ; or they would not put up with me here at all . You quality people have your ideas to hold by , and despise all others , and reasonable in your opinions ; but you know nothing nothing nothing of the stiffness of the people under you . "
132183	132193	132194	132194	I	0	" How should I know any thing of that ? "
132197	132264	132194	132194	I	0	" all these things are new to me . I have not been brought up in this country , as you know . I come from a larger land , where your stiffness may have burst out into roughness , from having so much room suddenly . But tell me what you think now your father would have done in such a case as mine is . "
132265	132392	130985	130985	she	3580	" Miss Erema , he was that long - headed that nobody could play leap - frog with him . None of them ever cleared over his barrel . He walked into this village fifty - five years back , this very month , with his spade upon his shoulder and the knowledge of every body in his eye . They all put up against him , but they never put him down ; and in less than three months he went to church , I do assure you , with the only daughter of the only baker . After that he went into the baking line himself ; he turned his spade into a shovel , as he said , and he introduced new practices . "
132393	132402	130985	130985	she	3580	" Oh , Mrs. Busk , not adulteration ? "
132403	132504	132194	132194	I	0	" No , miss , no ! The very last thing he would think of . Only the good use of potatoes in the bread , when flour was frightful bad and painful dear . What is the best meal of the day ? he used to reason . Dinner . And why ? Why , because of the potatoes . If I can make people take potato for their breakfast , and potato for their supper too , I am giving them three meals a day instead of one . And the health of the village corresponded to it . "
132505	132530	130985	130985	she	3580	" Oh , but , Mrs. Busk , he might have made them do it by persuasion , or at least with their own knowledge "
132531	132609	130985	130985	she	3580	" No , miss , no ! The whole nature of our people , Moonstock or out of it , is never to take victuals by any sort of persuasion . If St. Paul was to come and preach , ' Eat this or that , ' all I had of it in the shop would go rotten . They hate any meddling with their likings , and they suspect doctor 's rubbish in all of it . "
132610	132618	132619	132619	I	0	" I am quite of their opinion , "
132622	132654	132619	132619	I	0	" and I am glad to hear of their independence . I always used to hear that in England none of the poor people dared have a will of their own . "
132672	132735	132659	132659	her	311	" must run away and put the shutters up , or else the policeman would come rapping , and look for a glass of beer , which he had no right to till it came to the bottom of the firkin ; and this one was only tapped last Sunday week .

132960	132970	132971	132971	she	311	" I have heard more about him , miss , "
132991	133135	132971	132971	she	311	" He has been here only those three times this summer , upon excuse of fishing always . He stays at old Wellham , about five miles down the river , where the people are not true Moonites . And one thing that puzzles them is , that although he puts up there simply for the angling , he always chooses times when the water is so low that to catch fish is next to impossible . He left his fishing quarters upon the very day after you saw him searching so ; and he spoke as if he did not mean to come again this season . And they say that they do n't want him neither , he is such a morose , close - fisted man ; and drinking nothing but water , there is very little profit with him . "
133136	133153	132971	132971	she	311	" And did you find out what his name is ? How cleverly you have managed ! "
133154	133246	132971	132971	she	311	" He passes by the name of ' Captain Brown ; ' but the landlord of his inn , who has been an old soldier , is sure he was never in the army , nor any other branch of the service . He thinks that he lives by inventing things , for he is always at some experiments , and one of his great points is to make a lamp that will burn and move about under water . To be sure you see the object of that , miss ? "
133247	133265	132971	132971	she	311	" No , really , Mrs. Busk , I can not . I have not your penetration . "
133266	133314	132971	132971	she	311	" Why , of course , to find what he can not find upon land . There is something of great importance there , either for its value or its meaning . Have you ever been told that your poor grandfather wore any diamonds or precious jewels ? "
133315	133351	132971	132971	she	311	" No . I have asked about that most especially . He had nothing about him to tempt a robber . He was a very strong - willed man , and he hated outward trumpery . "
133352	133394	132971	132971	she	311	" Then it must be something that this man himself has dropped , unless it were a document , or any other token , missing from his lordship . And few things of that sort would last for twenty years almost . "

133418	133465	133406	133406	I	0	" I determined to be here on that very day . No doubt I am very superstitious . But one thing I can not understand is this what reason can there have been for his letting so many years pass , and then hunting like this ? "
133466	133554	132971	132971	she	311	" No one can answer that question , miss , without knowing more than we know . But many reasons might be supposed . He might have been roving abroad , for instance , just as you and your father have been . Or he might not have known that the thing was there ; or it might not have been of importance till lately ; or he might have been afraid , until something else happened . Does he know that you are now in England ? "
133555	133606	133406	133406	I	0	" How can I possibly tell , Mrs. Busk ? He seems to know a great deal too much . He found me out when I was at Colonel Gundry 's . At least I conclude so , from what I know now ; but I hope he does not know "

133634	133656	133613	133613	I	0	" or he would have found means to put an end to you . That would have been his first object . "

134533	134748	134526	134526	he	337	" This seemed a very easy way to do it . But I told Mrs. Busk that I would pay well also , for the loss of a day 's work at the mill was more than fifty smiles could make up . But she told me , above all things , not to do that . For old Master Withypool was of that sort that he would stand for an hour with his hands in his pocket for a half - penny , if not justly owing from him . But nothing more angered him than a bribe to step outside of his duty . He had plenty of money , and was proud of it . But sooner would he lose a day 's work to do a kindness , when he was sure of having right behind it , than take a week 's profit without earning it . And very likely that was where the dark man failed , from presuming that money would do every thing . However , there was nothing like judging for one 's self ; and if I would like to be introduced , she could do it for me with the best effect ; taking as she did a good hundred - weight of best "
134750	134825	134526	134526	he	337	" from him every week , although not herself in the baking line , but always keeping quartern bags , because the new baker did adulterate so . I thought of her father , and how things work round ; but that they would do without remarks of mine . So I said nothing on that point , but asked whether Master Withypool would require any introduction . And to this Mrs. Busk said , "
134831	135013	134526	134526	he	337	" And her throat had been a little rough since Sunday , and the dog was chained tight , even if any dog would bite a sweet young lady ; and to her mind the miller would be more taken up and less fit to vapor into obstacles , if I were to hit upon him all alone , just when he came out to the bank of his cabbage garden , not so very long after his dinner , to smoke his pipe and to see his things a - growing . It was time to get ready if I meant to catch him then , for he always dined at one o'clock , and the mill was some three or four meadows up the stream ; therefore as soon as Mrs. Busk had re - assured me that she was quite certain of my enemy 's departure , I took my drawing things and set forth to call upon Master Withypool . Passing through the church - yard , which was my nearest way , and glancing sadly at the "
135017	135432	134526	134526	he	337	" I began to have some uneasiness about the possible issue of my new scheme . Such a thing required more thinking out than I had given to it . For instance , what reason could I give the miller for asking so strange a thing of him ? And how could the whole of the valley be hindered from making the greatest talk about the stoppage of their own beloved Moon , even if the Moon could be stopped without every one of them rushing down to see it ? And if it was so talked of , would it not be certain to come to the ears of that awful man ? And if so , how long before he found me out , and sent me to rejoin my family ? These thoughts compelled me to be more discreet ; and having lately done a most honorable thing , in refusing to read that letter , I felt a certain right to play a little trick now of a purely harmless character . I ran back therefore to my writing - desk , and took from its secret drawer a beautiful golden American eagle , a large coin , larger and handsomer than any in the English coinage . Uncle Sam gave it to me on my birthday , and I would not have taken 50 pounds for it . With this I hurried to that bridge of fear , which I had not yet brought myself to go across ; and then , not to tell any story about it , I snipped a little hole in the corner of my pocket , while my hand was still steady ere I had to mount the bridge . Then pinching that hole up with a squeeze , I ran and got upon that wicked bridge , and then let go . The heavy gold coin fell upon the rotten plank , and happily rolled into the water , as if it were glad not to tempt its makers to any more sin for the sake of it . Shutting up thought , for fear of despising myself for the coinage of such a little trick , I hurried across the long meadow to the mill , and went through the cow - gate into the yard , and the dog began to bark at me . Seeing that he had a strong chain on , I regarded him with lofty indignation . "
135443	135447	135448	135448	Jowler	197	" I said ; "
135477	135673	135457	135457	He	197	" The dog appeared to feel the force of my remarks , for he lay down again , and with one eye watched me in a manner amusing , but insidious . Then , taking good care to keep out of his reach , I went to the mill - pond and examined it . It looked like a very nice pond indeed , long , and large , and well banked up , not made into any particular shape , but producing little rushy elbows . The water was now rather low , and very bright though the Moon itself is not a crystal stream , and a school of young minnows , just watching a water - spider with desirous awe , at sight of me broke away , and reunited , with a speed and precision that might shame the whole of our very best modern fighting . Then many other things made a dart away , and furrowed the shadow of the willows , till distance quieted the fear of man that most mysterious thing in nature and the shallow pool was at peace again , and bright with unruffled reflections . "
135679	135712	135713	135713	Servant	3646	" said a deep gruff voice ; and the poor dog received a contemptuous push , not enough to hurt him , but to wound his feelings for doing his primary duty . "

135800	135837	135789	135789	you	5145	" I chose the garden , and he led the way , and set me down upon an old oak bench , where the tinkle of the water through the flood - gates could be heard . "
135849	135853	135839	135839	you	5145	" he said . "
135942	135985	135986	135986	Her	3661	" Something in my look or voice made the old man often turn away , while I told him that I would make the very best drawing of his mill that I could manage , and would beg him to accept it . "
135996	136008	135986	135986	Her	3661	" he said , with trouble in getting his words out . "
136032	136135	136136	136136	Nobody	888	" I told him that I would put her on the plank , if he had any portrait of her showing her dress and her attitude . Without saying what he had , he led me to the house , and stood behind me , while I went inside . And then he could not keep his voice as I went from one picture of his darling to another , not thinking as I should have done of what his feelings might be , but trying , as no two were at all alike , to extract a general idea of her . "
136144	136162	136136	136136	Nobody	888	" the old man said , with a quiet little noise and a sniff behind my shoulder . "

136248	136307	136310	136310	I	0	" I never meant , of course , to have said a word of this , but was carried away by that common old idea of consoling great sorrow with a greater one . And the sense of my imprudence broke vexatiously upon me when the old man came and stood between me and his daughter 's portraits . "

And many a time I have slipped up the gate , to give him more water for his flies to play , and the fish not to see him so plainly . Ah , we have had many pleasant spells together ; and his eldest boy and girl , Master George and Miss Henrietta , used to come and fetch our eggs . My Polly there was in love with him , we said ; she sat upon his lap so , when she were two years old , and played with his beautiful hair , and blubbered oh , she did blubber , when the Captain went away !

There must be a yard of water there . "

If so be now , afore the water was run out , you had stood on that there bridge , and dropped a bright coin into it , a new half crown or a two - shilling piece , why , the chances would be that the run of the current would ' a taken it nigh to the likeliest spot for holding any other little matter as might ' a dropped , permiskous , you might say , into this same water .

141830	141901	141758	141759	the postmistress	3790	" Now please not to frighten me , Mrs. Busk . I am not very brave at the best of times , and this has made me so nervous . If I carried a pistol , I should shoot myself the very first hour of wearing it . The mere thought of it makes me tremble . Oh , why was I ever born , to do man 's work ? "
141902	142038	141758	141759	the postmistress	3790	" Because , miss , a man would not have done it half so well . When you saw that villain digging , a man would have rushed out and spoiled all chance . And now what man could have ever found this ? Would Master Withypool ever have emptied the Moon River for a man , do you think ? Or could any man have been down among us all this time , in this jealous place , without his business being long ago sifted out and scattered over him ? No , no , miss ; you must not talk like that and with me as well to help you . The rogues will have reason to wish , I do believe , that they had only got a man to deal with . "

142147	142153	142154	142155	Mrs. Busk	311	" My dear young lady , "
142167	142184	142154	142155	Mrs. Busk	311	" my own opinion is , for my part , that you ought to consult somebody . "
142185	142199	142129	142129	my	0	" But I am , Mrs. Busk . I am now consulting you . "
142200	142237	142129	142129	my	0	" Then I think , miss , that this precious case should be taken at once to a jeweler , who can open it without doing any damage , which is more than we can do . "
142238	142249	142250	142250	I	0	" To be sure ; I have thought of that , "
142253	142316	142250	142250	I	0	" But how can that be done without arousing curiosity ? without the jeweler seeing its contents , if indeed it has any ? And in that case the matter would be no longer at our own disposal , as now it is . I have a great mind to split it with a hammer . What are the diamonds to me ? "
142317	142384	142129	142129	my	0	" It is not the diamonds , but the picture , miss , that may be most important . And more than that , you might ruin the contents , so as not to make head or tale of them . No , no ; it is a risk that must be run ; we must have a jeweler , but not one of this neighborhood . "
142385	142415	142129	142129	my	0	" Then I shall have to go to London again , and perhaps lose something most important here . Can you think of no other way out of it ? "
142416	142441	142250	142250	I	0	" No , miss , at present I see nothing else . Unless you will place it all in the hands of the police . "
142442	142519	142129	142129	my	0	" Constable Jobbins , to wit , or his son ! No , thank you , Mrs. Busk , not yet . Surely we are not quite reduced to such a hopeless pass as that . My father knew what the police were worth , and so does Betsy , and so does Major Hockin . ' Pompous noodles , ' the Major calls them , who lay hold of every thing by the wrong end . "
142520	142543	142250	142250	I	0	" Then if he can lay hold of the right end , miss , what better could you do than consult him ? "

But , bless me ! dinner must be waiting . Look at that fellow 's trowel he knows : he turns up the point of it like a spoon . They say that he can smell his dinner two miles off . We all dine at one o'clock now , that I may rout up every man - Jack of them . "

We can sit in my snuggery on the cliff , with only gulls and jackdaws to listen , and mount my telescope and hoist my flag , and the men know better than to skulk their work . I can see every son of a gun of them as clearly as if I had them on parade . You wish Mrs. Hockin to come , I suppose . Very well , let us be off at once . I shall count my fellows coming back from dinner . "

144919	145118	144910	144911	the Major	1607	" the whole of my little domain may be comprised as in a bird's - eye view . It is nothing , of course , much less than nothing , compared with the Earl of Crowcombe 's , or the estate of Viscount Gamberley ; still , such as it is , it carries my ideas , and it has an extent of marine frontage such as they might envy . We are asked 5 pounds per foot for a thread of land fronting on a highway , open to every kind of annoyance , overlooked , without any thing to look at . How much , then , per fathom or measure , if you please , by cable - lengths is land worth fronting the noble , silent , uncontaminating , healthful sea ? Whence can come no coster - mongers ' cries , no agitating skir of bagpipes or the maddening hurdy - gurdy , no German band expecting half a crown for the creation of insanity ; only sweet murmur of the wavelets , and the melodious whistle of a boatman catching your breakfast lobster . Where , again , if you love the picturesque "

145130	145186	145125	145126	Mrs. Hockin	228	" you always were eloquent from the first day I saw you ; and if you reconstitute our borough , as you hope , and enter Parliament for Bruntsea , what a sensation you will create ! But I wished to draw your attention to the fact that Erema is waiting to tell her tale . "
145187	145239	144910	144911	the Major	1607	" To be sure . I will not stop her . Eloquence is waste of time , and I never yet had half a second to spare . Fear no eloquence from me ; facts and logic are my strong points . And now , Erema , show what yours are . "

145414	145424	145425	145426	the Major	1607	" There were not seven graves without the mother , "
145431	145473	145425	145426	the Major	1607	" And what odds whether seven or seventy ? The criminality is the point , not the accumulation of results . Still , I never heard of so big a blackguard . And what did he do next , my dear ? "
145593	145597	145599	145600	the Major	1607	" And now , "
145602	145607	145599	145600	the Major	1607	" let us see it "
145631	145661	145599	145600	the Major	1607	" Show it , and you shall have my opinion . And Mary 's is certain to agree with mine . My dear , that makes yours so priceless . "
145662	145709	145727	145727	he	223	" Then , Nicholas , if I retain my own , yours is of no value . Never mind that . Now do n't catch words , or neither opinion will be worth a thought . My dear , let us see it and then judge . "

145838	145941	145834	145835	the Major	1607	" brilliants of first water ; such as we saw , you know where ; and any officer in the British army except myself , I do believe , would have had them at once in his camlet pouch my dear , you know all about it . Bless my heart , how slow you are ! Is it possible you have forgotten it ? There came out a fellow , and I cut him down , as my duty was , without ceremony . You know how I used to do it , out of regulation , with a slash like this "
145942	145986	146093	146093	he	3882	" Oh , Nicholas , you will be over the cliff ! You have shown me how you used to do it , a thousand times but you had no cricks in your back then : and remember how brittle the chalk is . "
145987	146056	146093	146093	he	3882	" The chalk may be brittle , but I am tough . I insist upon doing every thing as well as I did it forty years ago . Mary , you ought not to speak to me like that . Eighteen , nineteen , twenty brilliants , worth twenty pounds apiece upon an average , I do believe . Four hundred pounds . That would finish our hotel . "
146057	146060	145834	145835	the Major	1607	" Nicholas ! "
146061	146082	146093	146093	he	3882	" My dear , I was only in fun . Erema understands me . But who is this beautiful lady ? "
146083	146088	146089	146089	I	0	" The very point , "
146116	146138	146093	146093	he	3882	" The very thing that I must know that I would give my life to know that I have fifty thousand fancies "
146139	146164	145834	145835	the Major	1607	" Now do n't be excited , Erema , if you please . What will you give me to tell you who it is ? "
146165	146192	145834	145835	the Major	1607	" All those diamonds , which I hate the sight of , and three - quarters of my half nugget ; and if that is not enough "
146193	146223	146093	146093	he	3882	" It is a thousand times too much ; I will tell you for just one smile , and I know it , will be a smile of unbelief . "
146224	146238	145834	145835	the Major	1607	" No , no ; I will believe it , whoever you say , "
146248	146260	146245	146245	I	0	" only tell me at once do n't be so long . "
146261	146275	146276	146277	the Major	1607	" But then you wo n't believe me when I do tell you , "
146286	146309	146276	146277	the Major	1607	" I shall tell you the last person you would ever think of , and then you will only laugh at me . "
146310	146337	146245	146245	I	0	" I wo n't laugh ; how can I laugh in such a matter ? I will believe you if you say it is Aunt Mary . "
146338	146361	146362	146363	Mrs. Hockin	228	" My dear , you had better say at once that it is I , and have no more mystery about it . "
146371	146432	146362	146363	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Mrs. Hockin , you must indeed entertain an exalted idea of your own charms . I knew that you were vain , but certainly did not Well , then , if you will allow me no peace , this is the lady that lives down in the ruin , and stands like a pillar by my pillar - box . "
146433	146443	146444	146444	I	0	" I never thought you would joke like that , "
146452	146464	146444	146444	I	0	" Oh , is it a subject to be joked about ? "
146465	146493	146362	146363	Mrs. Hockin	228	" I never was graver in my life ; and you promised implicitly to believe me . At any rate , believe that I speak in earnest . "
146494	146596	146362	146363	Mrs. Hockin	228	" That I must believe , when you tell me so . But what makes you think such a wonderful thing ? I should have thought nothing more impossible . I had made up my mind that it was Flittamore who lived down here ; but this can not be she . Flittamore was unheard of at the time of my grandfather 's death . Moreover , her character was not like this ; she was giddy and light and heartless . This lady had a heart good or bad , a deep one . Most certainly it is not Flittamore . "
146597	146618	146619	146620	The Major	1607	" Flittamore ! I do not remember that name . You should either tell us all or tell us nothing . "
146636	146643	146644	146644	I	0	" I have not told you , "
146647	146672	146644	146644	I	0	" because it can have nothing to do with it . The subject is a painful one , and belongs to my family only . "
146673	146792	146644	146644	I	0	" Enough . I am not inquisitive on the other hand , too forgetful . I have an appointment at 3.25 . It takes me seven minutes and a quarter to get there . I must be two minutes and three - quarters late . Mrs. Hockin , mount the big telescope and point it at the ramparts ; keep the flag up also . Those fellows will be certain that I am up here , while I enfilade them from the western end with this fine binocular . Surprises maintain discipline . Good - by , my dear , and , Miss Castlewood , good - by . Tea at 6.30 , and not too much water . "
146959	146967	146968	146968	she	228	" It is not quite a ruin , "
146971	147122	146968	146968	she	228	" My dear husband is fond of picturesque expressions . However , it is not in very good repair ; and being unable to get possession of it , through some legal quibble , possibly he may look at it from a rather unfavorable point of view . And for the same reason though he is so purely just he may have formed a bad opinion of the strange individual who lives there . What right has she to be living without his leave upon his own manor ? But there she is , and she does not care for us or any body . She fetches all she wants , she speaks to none , and if any body calls for rates or taxes , or any other public intrusion , they may knock and knock , but never get in , and at last they go away again . "
147123	147140	146942	146943	Mrs. Hockin	228	" But surely that can not go on forever . Bruntsea is such an enlightened place . "
147141	147257	147477	147479	The old lady	1643	" Our part of it is , but the rest quite benighted . As the man says I forget his name , but the man that misunderstands us so his contention is that ' Desolate Hole , ' as the Major calls it , although in the middle of our land , is entirely distinct from it . My husband never will put up with that his love of justice is far too strong and he means to have a lawsuit . But still he has reasons for not beginning yet ; and he puts up with a great deal , I am sure . It is too bad for them to tease him so . "
147258	147267	147268	147268	I	0	" It does seem a very sad thing , "
147271	147333	147268	147268	I	0	" and the poor soul living there all alone ! Even in the summer it is bad enough ; but whatever will she do when the winter comes ? Why , the sea in bad weather must be almost in upon her . And the roar of the pebbles all night ! Major Hockin will never allow her to stay there . "
147334	147416	147477	147479	The old lady	1643	" What can he do , when he can not get in , and they even deny his title ? I assure you , Erema , I have sent down cream , and even a dozen of my precious eggs , with the lady of the manor 's compliments ; but instead of being grateful , they were never taken in ; and my Polly ' Miss Polly Hopkins , ' you know very wisely took it all to her grandmother . "
147417	147476	147477	147479	The old lady	1643	" To her grandmother instead of mine , as the Major facetiously calls her . And now he says this is her portrait ; and instead of giving his reasons , runs away ! Really you must excuse me , Aunt Mary , for thinking that your good husband has a little too much upon his mind sometimes . "
147490	147627	147487	147487	her	1643	" Well , my dear , after that , I think you had better have it out with him . He comes home to tea at 6.30 , which used to be half past six in my days . He is very tired then , though he never will allow it , and it would not be fair to attack him . I give him a mutton - chop , or two poached eggs , or some other trifle of nourishment . And then I make him doze for an hour and a half , to soothe his agitated intellect . And when he wakes he has just one glass of hot water and sugar , with a little Lochnagar . And then he is equal to any thing backgammon , bezique , or even conversation . "
147855	147956	147813	147813	He	223	" Erema , you are a mighty finder ; you found the biggest nugget yet discovered . You know about stones from the Rocky Mountains , or at least the Sierra Nevada . You did not discover this beautiful agate , but you saw and greatly admired it . We might say that a ' young lady , eminent for great skill in lithology , famed as the discoverer , ' etc . Hold it between your eyes and this candle , but wet it in the slop - basin first ; now you see the magnificent veins of blue . "
147957	147965	147966	147966	I	0	" I see nothing of the kind , "
147978	147995	147966	147966	I	0	" It seems to me a dirty bit of the commonest flint you could pick up . "
148074	148078	148079	148079	he	223	" Open it ? "
148082	148150	148079	148079	he	223	" why , of course I can ; there is never any difficulty about that . The finest workmanship in the world is that of the Indian jewelers . I have been among them often ; I know all their devices and mechanism , of which the European are bad copies . I have only to look round this thing twice , and then pronounce my Sesame . "
148151	148165	148167	148168	his wife	590	" My dear , then look round it as fast as you can , "
148177	148190	148167	148168	his wife	590	" and we wo n't breathe a Sess till it flies asunder . "
148191	148224	148079	148079	he	223	" Mary , Miss Castlewood makes you pert , although herself so well conducted . However , I do not hesitate to say that I will open this case in two minutes . "
148225	148233	148234	148235	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Of course you will , dear , "
148242	148296	148234	148235	Mrs. Hockin	228	" The Major never fails , Erema , in any thing he is so sure about ; and this is a mere child 's toy to him . Well , dear , have you done it ? But I need not ask . Oh , let us see what is inside of it ! "
148297	148336	148079	148079	he	223	" I have not done it yet , Mrs. Hockin ; and if you talk with such rapidity , of course you throw me out . How can I command my thoughts , or even recall my experience ? "
148337	148353	148079	148079	he	223	" Hush ! now hush , Erema ! And I myself will hush most reverently . "
148354	148393	148234	148235	Mrs. Hockin	228	" You have no reverence in you , and no patience . Do you expect me to do such a job in one second ? Do you take me for a common jeweler ? I beg you to remember "
148394	148431	148079	148079	he	223	" Well , my dear , I remember only what you told us . You were to turn it round twice , you know , and then cry Sesame . Erema , was it not so ? "
148432	148466	148234	148235	Mrs. Hockin	228	" I never said any thing of the sort . What I said was simply this However , to reason with ladies is rude ; I shall just be off to my study . "
148467	148477	148478	148479	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Where you keep your tools , my darling , "
148487	148501	148478	148479	Mrs. Hockin	228	" at least , I mean , when you know where they are . "
148545	148557	148558	148559	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Go and knock at his door in about five minutes , "
148571	148596	148558	148559	Mrs. Hockin	228	" If he continues to fail , he may possibly take a shorter way with it . And with his tools so close at hand "
148597	148600	148601	148601	I	0	" Oh , "
148604	148631	148601	148601	I	0	" his geological hammer that dreadful crusher ! May I go at once ? I detest that thing , but I can not have it smashed . "
148632	148669	148674	148675	Mrs. Hockin	228	" He will not break it up , my dear , without your leave . He never would think of such a thing , of course . However , you may as well go after him . "
148760	148786	148735	148735	he	3906	" My dear , I give it up . I was wrong in taking it away from you . You must consult some one wiser . "
148787	148792	148793	148793	I	0	" That odious thing ! "
148805	148851	148793	148793	I	0	" you shall not give it up ; and I know no wiser person . A lapidary 's tricks are below your knowledge . But if you are not tired of me and offended , may I leave it to you to get it opened ? "
148852	148859	148860	148860	he	3906	" I would like nothing better , "
148870	148910	148860	148860	he	3906	" but you ought to be there , my dear ; you must be there . Are you sure that you ought not rather to take it to your good cousin Lord Castlewood ? Now think before you answer . "
148911	148981	148793	148793	I	0	" I need not think twice of that , Major Hockin . Good and learned as my father 's cousin is , he has distinctly refused to help me , for some mysterious reason of his own , in searching into this question . Indeed , my great hope is to do it without him : for all that I know , he might even wish to thwart me . "
148982	149125	148793	148793	I	0	" Enough , my dear ; it shall be just as you wish . I brought you to England , and I will stand by you . My cousin , Colonel Gundry , has committed you to me . I have no patience with malefactors . I never took this matter up , for very many reasons ; and among them not the least was that Sampson , your beloved ' Uncle Sam , ' thought it better not to do so . But if you desire it , and now that I feel certain that an infamous wrong has been done to you which I heartily beg your pardon for my doubt of by the Lord of all justice , every thing else may go to the devil , till I see it out . Do you desire it , Erema ? "
149126	149165	148793	148793	I	0	" I certainly do not wish that any of your great works should be neglected . But if , without that , you can give me your strong help , my only difficulty will be to thank you . "
149166	149182	149183	149183	he	3907	" I like plain speaking , and you always speak plainly ; sometimes too plainly , "
149197	149206	149183	149183	he	3907	" How far do you trust me now ? "
149207	149225	148793	148793	I	0	" Major Hockin , I trust you altogether . You may make mistakes , as all men do "
149226	149274	149275	149275	His	3907	" Yes , yes , yes . About my own affairs ; but I never do that for other people . I pay a bill for twopence , if it is my own . If I am trustee of it , I pay three half - pence . "
149346	149357	149358	149358	I	0	" Please not to speak of my affairs like that , "
149368	149383	149358	149358	I	0	" I mean to pay fourpence for every twopence both to friends and enemies . "
149384	149506	149334	149334	his	3907	" You are a queer girl ; I have always said so . You turn things to your own ideas so . However , we must put up with that , though none of my daughters have ever done it ; for which I am truly thankful . But now there is very little time to lose . The meaning of this thing must be cleared up at once . And there is another thing to be done as well , quite as important , in my opinion . I will go to London with you to - morrow , if you like . My clever little Cornishman will see to things here the man that sets up all the angles . "
149507	149518	149519	149519	I	0	" But why should I hurry you to London so ? "
149522	149539	149519	149519	I	0	" Surely any good country jeweler could manage it ? Or let us break it open . "
149540	149545	149546	149546	he	3908	" On no account , "
149549	149620	149546	149546	he	3908	" we might spoil it all ; besides the great risk to the diamonds , which are very brittle things . To London we must take it , for this reason the closure of this case is no jeweler 's work ; of that I have quite convinced myself . It is the work of a first - rate lapidary , and the same sort of man must undo it . "
149670	149698	149657	149657	I	0	" What made you imagine , Major Hockin , that this very beautiful face could have ever been that of the old lady living in the ruin ? "
149699	149896	149657	149657	I	0	" In Desolate Hole ? I will tell you at once ; and then call it , if you like , an imagination . Of all the features of the human face there is none more distinctive than the eyebrow . ' Distinctive ' is not exactly what I mean I mean more permanently marked and clear . The eyes change , the nose changes , so does the mouth , and even the shape of the forehead sometimes ; but the eyebrows change very little , except in color . This I have noticed , because my own may perhaps be a little peculiar ; and they have always been so . At school I received a nickname about it , for boys are much sharper than men about such things ; and that name after fifty years fits as well as ever . You may smile , if you like ; I shall not tell you what it was , but leave you to re - invent it , if you can . Now look at this first - rate miniature . Do you see an unusual but not uncomely formation of the eyebrows ? "
149897	149925	149657	149657	I	0	" Certainly I do ; though I did not observe it until you drew my attention . I had only regarded the face , as a whole . "
149926	149973	149657	149657	I	0	" The face , as a whole , is undoubtedly fine . But the eyebrows have a peculiar arch , and the least little turn at the lower end , as if they designed to rise again . The lady of Desolate Hole has the same . "
149974	149994	149657	149657	I	0	" But how can you tell ? How very strange ! I thought she let nobody see her face . "
149995	150151	149657	149657	I	0	" You are perfectly right about that , Erema ; so far at least as she has vouchsafed to exhibit her countenance to me . Other people may be more fortunate . But when I met her for the second time , being curious already about her , I ventured to offer my services , with my inborn chivalry , at a place where the tide was running up , and threatened to surround her . My politeness was not appreciated , as too often is the case ; for she made me a very stiff bow , and turned away . Her face had been covered by the muffler of her cloak , as if the sea - breeze were too much for her ; and she did not even raise her eyes . But before she turned away , I obtained a good glance at her eyebrows and they were formed like these . "
150152	150166	149657	149657	I	0	" But her age , Major Hockin ! Her age what is it ? "
150167	150199	149657	149657	I	0	" Upon that proverbially delicate point I can tell you but little , Erema . Perhaps , however , I may safely say that she can not be much under twenty . "
150200	150237	149657	149657	I	0	" It is not right to provoke me so . You call her ' the old woman , ' and compare her to your letter - box . You must have some idea is she seventy ? "
150238	150310	149657	149657	I	0	" Certainly not , I should say ; though she can not expect me to defend her , when she will not show her face to me ; and what is far worse , at my time of life , she wo n't even pay me a half - penny of rent . Now let us go back to Aunt Mary , my dear ; she always insists upon packing overnight . "
150438	150446	150447	150447	he	1607	" A regular muff , this time , "
150467	150524	150447	150447	he	1607	" no sport to be had out of him . Why , he stared at me when I said ' Rosamond Street , ' and made me stick on ' Clerkenwell . ' Now here he is taking us down Snow Hill , when he should have been crossing Smithfield . Smithfield , cabby , Smithfield ! "
150525	150538	150540	150540	he	1607	" Certain , Sir , Smiffle , if you gives the order ; "
150562	150566	150540	150540	he	1607	" No thoroughfare , "
150567	150571	150583	150583	his	1887	" No thoroughfare , "
150632	150638	150640	150641	the Major	1607	" What are you at ? "
150652	150662	150640	150641	the Major	1607	" Erema , untie my big rattan . Quick quick "
150663	150666	150668	150669	the cabman	1887	" Captain , "
150673	150717	150668	150669	the cabman	1887	" I must have another shilling for this job . A hextra mile and a quarter , to your orders . You knows Lunnon so much better . Smiffle stopped new railway new meat market never heered of that now , did you ? "
150718	150730	150640	150641	the Major	1607	" You scoundrel , drive straight to the nearest police office . "
150731	150785	150640	150641	the Major	1607	" Must jump this little ditch , then , Captain . Five pun ' fine for you , when we gets there . Hold on inside , old gentleman . Kuck , kuck , Bob , you was a hunter once . It ai n't more than fifty feet deep , my boy . "
150786	150823	150824	150825	Major Hockin	223	" Turn round ! turn round , I tell you ! turn round ! If your neck is forfeit , you rogue , mine is not . I never was so taken in in my life ! "
150850	150870	150839	150840	the driver	2602	" And I thought he was so soft , you know ! Erema , may I swear at him ? "
150871	150876	150877	150877	I	0	" On no account , "
150880	150925	150877	150877	I	0	" Why , after all , it is only a shilling , and the loss of time . And then , you can always reflect that you have discharged , as you say , a public duty , by protesting against a vile system . "
150926	150936	150937	150938	the Major	1607	" Protesting is very well , when it pays , "
150943	150955	150937	150938	the Major	1607	" but to pay for protesting is another pair of shoes . "
150977	150986	150987	150987	he	1607	" Four parcels on the roof , Captain , "
151007	151027	150987	150987	he	1607	" Twopence each under new hact , you know . Scarcely thought a hofficer would ' a tried evasion . "
151028	151067	151111	151112	the Major	1607	" You consummate scoundrel and you dress yourself like a countryman ! I 'll have your badge indorsed I 'll have your license marked . Erema , pay the thief ; it is more than I can do . "
151068	151104	151106	151106	he	3925	" Captain , your address , if you please ; I shall summon you for scurrilous language , as the hact directs . Ah , you do right to be driven to a pawn shop . "
151115	151146	151111	151112	the Major	1607	" Never tie up my rattan again . Oh , it was Mrs. Hockin , was it ? What a fool I was not to stop on my own manor ! "
151147	151157	151158	151158	I	0	" I pray you to disdain such low impudence , "
151182	151199	151162	151162	I	0	" You have beaten fifty of them a hundred of them I have heard you say . "
151200	151296	151298	151298	himself	3927	" Certainly I have , my dear ; but I had no Bruntsea then , and could not afford to pay the rogues . That makes me feel it so bitterly , so loftily , and so righteously . To be treated like this , when I think of all my labors for the benefit of the rascally human race ! my Institute , my Lyceum , my Mutual Improvement Association , and Christian Young Men 's something . There is no institution , after all , to be compared to the tread - mill . "
151721	151730	151732	151733	the Major	1607	" Are you not afraid to leave them ? "
151735	151745	151732	151733	the Major	1607	" They may secrete some gems , Mr. Handkin . "
151746	151749	151751	151752	the lapidary	3944	" Never , "
151758	151868	151751	151752	the lapidary	3944	" I could trust these men with the Koh - i - noor ; which we could have done better , I believe , than it was done by the Hollanders . But we do n't get the chance to do much in diamonds , through the old superstition about Amsterdam , and so on . No , no ; the only thing I ca n't trust my men about is to work as hard when I am away as when I am there . And now , Sir , what can I do for you ? Any more Bruntsea pebbles ? The last were not worth the cutting . "
151869	151932	151983	151984	The Major	1607	" So you said ; but I did not think so . We have some agates as good as any from Aberystwith or Perthshire . But what I want now is to open this case . It must be done quite privately , for a most particular reason . It does open , does n't it ? I am sure it does . "
151933	151938	151939	151940	Mr. Handkin	357	" Certainly it opens , "
151962	151982	151949	151949	he	357	" I could open it in one instant , but the enamel might fly . Will you risk it ? "
151993	152021	151990	151990	I	0	" Oh no ; please not to risk any thing , if any slower process will do it without risk . We want it done without injury . "
152022	152031	152032	152032	he	1607	" Then it will cost a good bit , "
152035	152062	152032	152032	he	1607	" I can open it for five shillings , if you run the risk ; if that rests with me , I must charge five pounds . "
152063	152067	152069	152070	the Major	1607	" Say three , "
152072	152092	152069	152070	the Major	1607	" Well , then , say four guineas : I have a lot of work in store for you . "
152093	152106	152107	152108	the lapidary	3944	" I never overcharge , and I never depart from my figures , "
152111	152361	152107	152108	the lapidary	3944	" There is only one other man in London who knows the secret of this enamel , and he is my brother . They never make such enamel now . The art is lost , like that of the French paste of a hundred years ago , which almost puzzles even me until I go behind it . I will give you my brother 's address if you like ; but instead of five pounds , he will charge you ten guineas if it must be done in private . Without that condition , I can do it for two pounds . You wish to know why that should make such a difference . Well , for this simple reason : to make sure of the job , it must be done by daylight ; it can be done only in my chief work - room ; if no one is to see what I am about and my men have sharp eyes , I can tell you , all my hands must be sacked for the afternoon , but not without their wages . That alone would go far toward the difference , and then there is the dropping of the jobs in hand , and waste of power , and so on . I have asked you too little , Major Hockin , I assure you ; but having said , I will stick to it , although I would much rather you would let me off . "
152362	152371	152372	152373	the Major	1607	" I have known you for many years , "
152375	152435	152372	152373	the Major	1607	" ever since you were a boy , with a flat box , working at our Cornish opals . You would have done a lot of work for five pounds then . But I never knew you overcharge for any thing . We agree to your terms , and are obliged to you . But you guarantee no damage ? "
152436	152479	152107	152108	the lapidary	3944	" I will open this locket , take out its contents , whatever they may be , and reclose it so that the maker , if still alive which is not very probable should not know that it had been meddled with . "
152480	152534	152107	152108	the lapidary	3944	" Very well ; that is exactly what we want ; for I have an idea about it which I may try to go on with afterward . And for that it is essential to have no symptom that it ever has been opened . What are these brilliants worth , Mr. Handkin ? "
152535	152578	152372	152373	the Major	1607	" Well , Sir , in the trade , about a hundred and fifty , though I dare say they cost three hundred . And the portrait is worth another hundred , if I find on the back the marks I expect . "
152579	152592	152593	152593	I	0	" You do not mean to say that you know the artist ? "
152605	152617	152593	152593	I	0	" Oh , then , we shall find out every thing ! "
152618	152631	152632	152633	Major Hockin	223	" Erema , you are a well , you are a silly ! "
152671	152678	152679	152680	the Major	1607	" Now mind what you say , "
152695	152704	152688	152688	he	223	" The work - room is clear now , "
152709	153020	152688	152688	he	223	" the fellows were delighted to get their afternoon . Now you see that I have to take off this hoop , and there lies the difficulty . I could have taken out the gold back , as I said , with very little trouble , by simply cutting it . But the locket would never have been quite the same , though we put a new back ; and , more than that , the pressure of the tool might flaw the enamel , or even crack the portrait , for the make of this thing is peculiar . Now first I submit the rim or verge , without touching the brilliants , mind you , to the action of a little preparation of my own a gentle but penetrative solvent . You are welcome to watch me ; you will be none the wiser ; you are not in the trade , though the young lady looks as if she would make a good polisher . Very well : if this were an ordinary closure , with two flat surfaces meeting , the solvent would be absorbed into the adhesion , expansion would take place , and there we have it . But this is what we call a cyme - joint , a cohesion of two curved surfaces , formed in a reflex curve which admits the solvent most reluctantly , or , indeed , not at all , without too long application . For that , then , another kind of process is needful , and we find it in frictional heat applied most gradually and judiciously . For that I must have a buff - leather wheel , whose revolutions are timed to a nicety , and that wheel I only have in this room . Now you see why I sent the men away . "
153133	153170	153172	153172	he	357	" Good work takes a deal of time to do ; but the man that does it all the time knows well that it will take long to undo . Here it comes undone at last ! "
153180	153229	153175	153177	the excitable Major	3953	" Done it , eh ? Well , you are a clever fellow . Now do n't look inside it ; that is no part of your business , nor mine either , unless this young lady desires it . Hand it to her first , my friend . "
153230	153236	153238	153239	the lapidary	3944	" Wait half a minute , "
153241	153296	153238	153239	the lapidary	3944	" it is so far opened that the hoop spins round , but it must not be taken off until it cools . The lady may lift it then with care . I have done this job as a piece of fine art ; I have no wish to see any more of it . "
153297	153326	153175	153177	the excitable Major	3953	" Handkin , do n't you be so touchy to a brother Cornishman . I thought that I was Cornish enough , but you go cliffs beyond me . "
153327	153333	153334	153335	the lapidary	3944	" Well , Major Hockin , "
153338	153401	153334	153335	the lapidary	3944	" I beg your pardon , if I said harm . But a man doing careful and skilled work and skilled work it is , at every turn of the hand , as miss can bear witness , while you walked off he do n't care who it is , Major Hockin , he would fight his own brother to maintain it . "
153402	153472	153475	153475	I	0	" Very well , very well . Let us come away . I always enter into every body 's feelings . I see yours as clearly , Handkin , as if you had laid them open on that blessed wheel . My insight has always been remarkable . Every one , without exception , says that of me . Now come away , come away will you never see ? "

155762	155766	155767	155767	I	0	" Mr. Goad ! "
155782	155802	155767	155767	I	0	" if we go to the office , you surely will not expect me to see Mr. Goad himself ? "
155803	155845	155730	155730	he	223	" That depends , as the Frenchmen say . It is too late now to shrink back from any thing . If I can spare you , I will . If not , you must not be ashamed to show yourself . "
155846	155955	155767	155767	I	0	" I am never ashamed to show myself . But I would rather not go to that place at all . If things should prove to be as I begin to think , I had better withdraw from the whole of it , and only lament that I ever began . My father was right ; after all , my father was wise ; and I ought to have known it . And perhaps Uncle Sam knew the truth , and would not tell me , for fear of my rushing to the Yosemite . Cabman , please to turn the horse and go in the opposite direction . "
155972	155976	155964	155965	the driver	2602	" All right . "
155977	155980	155981	155982	the Major	1607	" Erema , "
155988	156008	155981	155982	the Major	1607	" things are gone a little too far for this . We are now embarked upon a most important investigation "
156025	156127	156019	156019	his	1607	" an investigation of vast importance . A crime of the blackest dye has been committed , and calmly hushed up , for some petty family reason , for a period of almost twenty years . I am not blaming your father , my dear ; you need not look so indignant . It is your own course of action , remember , which has led to the present the present well , let us say imbroglio . A man of honor and an officer of her Majesty 's service stands now committed at your request mind , at your own request "
156128	156151	156019	156019	his	1607	" Yes , yes , I know ; but I only meant you to to go as far as I should wish . "
156152	156262	155981	155982	the Major	1607	" Confidential instructions , let us say ; but there are times when duty to society overrides fine feeling . I have felt that already . The die is cast . No half - and - half measures , no beating about the bush , for me . After what I saw yesterday , and the light that burst upon me , I did not act hastily I never do , though slow coaches may have said so . I put this and that together carefully , and had my dinner , and made up my mind . And you see the result in that man on the box . "
156263	156284	156019	156019	his	1607	" The cabman ? Oh yes , you resolved to have a cab , and drive to those wicked informers . "
156285	156345	156019	156019	his	1607	" Where are your eyes ? You are generally so quick . This morning you are quite unlike yourself so weak , so tearful , and timorous . Have you not seen that by side of the cabman there sits another man altogether ? One of the most remarkable men of the age , as your dear Yankees say . "
156346	156376	155981	155982	the Major	1607	" Not a policeman in disguise , I hope . I saw a very common , insignificant man . I thought he was the driver 's groom , perhaps . "
156377	156500	156501	156502	Major Hockin	223	" Hush ! he hears every thing , even on this granite . He is not a policeman ; if he were , a few things that disgrace the force never would happen . If the policemen of England did their duty as our soldiers do , at once I would have gone to them ; my duty would have been to do so . As it is , I go to our private police , who would not exist if the force were worth a rap . Vypan , Goad , and Terryer , in spite of Goad 's clumsiness , rank second . I go to the first of all these firms , and I get their very cleverest rascal . "
156531	156547	156522	156522	his	223	" I have settled it now . You have nothing to do but praise me . "
156564	156572	156573	156573	he	223	" The beauty of this arrangement is , "
156580	156650	156573	156573	he	223	" that the two firms hate one another as the devil hates no , that wo n't do ; there is no holy water to be found among them well , as a snake hates a slow - worm , let us say . ' Set a thief to catch a thief ' is a fine old maxim ; still better when the two thieves have robbed one another . "
156692	156697	156699	156700	the Major	1607	" You are disappointed , "
156712	156740	156699	156700	the Major	1607	" You may see that man ten thousand times , and never be able to swear to him . Ha ! ha ! he is a oner ! "
156741	156751	156752	156752	I	0	" I disdain such mean tricks beyond all expression , "
156760	156800	156752	156752	I	0	" and every thing connected with them . It is so low to talk of such things . But what in the world made him do it ? Where does he come from , and what is his name ? "
156801	156950	156699	156700	the Major	1607	" Like all noble persons , he has got so many names that he does not know which is the right one ; only his are short and theirs are long . He likes ' Jack ' better than any thing else , because it is not distinctive . ' Cosmopolitan Jack , ' some call him , from his combining the manners and customs , features and figures , of nearly all mankind . He gets on with every one , for every one is gratified by seeing himself reflected in him . And he can jump from one frame to another as freely as Proteus or the populace . And yet , with all that , he is perfectly honest to any allegiance he undertakes . He would not betray us to Vypan , Goad , and Terryer for your great nugget and the Castlewood estates . "
156951	156961	156962	156962	I	0	" I have heard that there are such people , "
156965	156986	156962	156962	I	0	" but what can he possibly know about me ? And what is he coming to do for us now ? "
156987	157040	156699	156700	the Major	1607	" He knows all about you , for a very simple reason . That you do not know him , is a proof of his ability . For you must have met him times out of number . This is the fellow employed by your good but incapable cousin , Lord Castlewood . "
157041	157058	156699	156700	the Major	1607	" He is not incapable ; he is a man of great learning , and noble character "
157059	157139	156962	156962	I	0	" Well , never mind that ; you must not be so hot . What I mean is that he has done nothing for you beyond providing for your safety . And that he certainly did right well , and at considerable expense , for this man ca n't be had for nothing . You need have been under no terror at all in any of the scenes you have been through . Your safety was watched for continually . "
157140	157161	156699	156700	the Major	1607	" Then why did he not come and help me ? Why did he not find out that horrible man ? "
157162	157214	156699	156700	the Major	1607	" Because it was not in his orders , and Jack is the last man to go beyond those . He is so clever that the stupid Moonites took him for a stupid Moonite . You should have employed him yourself , Erema ; but you are so proud and independent . "
157215	157257	156962	156962	I	0	" I should hope so , indeed . Should I put up with deceit ? If the truth is not to be had without falsehood , it is not worth having . But what is this man to do here now ? "
157258	157340	156699	156700	the Major	1607	" That depends upon circumstances . He has better orders than I could give , for I am no hand at scheming . Here we are ; or here we stop . Say nothing till I tell you . Pray allow me the honor . You keep in the background , remember , with your veil , or whatever you call it , down . Nobody stops at the very door . Of course that is humbug we conform to it . "
157388	157393	156962	156962	I	0	" Little England Polygon . "
157394	157403	157404	157404	he	4015	" You have the card , my dear ? "
157407	157446	157404	157404	he	4015	" keep it till I call you in . But be ready to produce it in a moment . For the rest , I leave you to your own wit . Jack is on the watch , mind . "
157479	157482	157483	157483	We	4021	" private . "
157502	157515	157517	157518	the boy	5385	" Mr. Goad ? Yes , Sir . This way , Sir , "
157520	157588	157517	157518	the boy	5385	" Lady stay ? Yes , Sir ; waiting - room for ladies . Chair , miss ; here , if you please first right . Mr. Goad , second on the left . Knock twice . Paper , miss ? Poker chained at this time of year . Bell A , glass of water . Bell B , cup of tea , if ladies grows impatient . "
157673	157680	157668	157669	the Major	1607	" ladies ' waiting - room , "
157690	157696	157697	157697	I	0	" Oh , do n't ! "
157700	157719	157697	157697	I	0	" what would Mrs. Hockin say ? And consider me too , Major Hockin , if you please . "
157720	157782	157668	157669	the Major	1607	" I have considered you , and that makes me do it . Every body knows what I am . Did I ever exaggerate in all my life ? Did I ever say any thing without just grounds ? Did I ever take any distorted views ? Did I ever draw upon my imagination ? Erema , answer me this instant ! "
157783	157798	157799	157799	I	0	" I do not remember a single instance of your drawing upon your imagination , "
157809	157818	157799	157799	I	0	" because there is none to draw upon . "
157819	157862	157668	157669	the Major	1607	" Very well . I was sure of your concurrence . Then just come with me . Take my arm , if you please , and have the thief 's card ready . Now keep your temper and your self - command . "
157945	158033	157935	157935	I	0	" Now , Mr. Goad , you still assert that you never were in California never even crossed the Atlantic . This young lady under my protection do n't you be afraid , my dear is the Honorable Erema Castlewood , whom you , in the pay of a murderer , went to fetch , and perhaps to murder . Now , do you acknowledge it ? You wrote her description , and ought to know her . You double - dyed villain , out with it ! "
158034	158038	158040	158041	Mr. Goad	195	" Major Hockin , "
158063	158094	158056	158056	his	195	" if indeed you are an officer which I doubt for the credit of her Majesty 's service if the lady were not present , I should knock you down . "
158107	158112	158113	158114	my companion	2286	" Never mind her , "
158142	158229	158134	158134	I	0	" The Major was scarcely more than half the size of Mr. Goad in mere bodily bulk , and yet he defied him in this way . He carefully took his blue lights off , then drew up the crest of his hair , like his wife 's most warlike cock a - crowing , and laid down his rattan upon a desk , and doubled his fists , and waited . Then he gave a blink from the corner of his gables , clearly meaning , "
158238	158277	158278	158278	Major	2818	" It was a distressing thing to see , and the Major 's courage was so grand that I could not help smiling . Mr. Goad , however , did not advance , but assumed a superior manner . "
158280	158284	158278	158278	Major	2818	" he said , "
158349	158350	158342	158342	I	0	" "
158356	158369	158342	158342	I	0	" the Major exclaimed , and then looked sorry for his arrogance . "
158489	158490	158494	158494	Major	2818	" "
158538	158539	158518	158518	I	0	" "
158671	158672	158645	158647	this young lady	2306	" "

158853	158914	158850	158851	Mr. Goad	195	" Thus I spoke on the spur of the moment , and I could not have spoken better after a month of consultation . Rogues are generally superstitious . Mr. Goad glanced at me with a shudder , as I had gazed at him some three years back ; and then he dropped his bad , oily - looking eyes . "
158920	158924	158938	158940	this young lady	2306	" he said , "
158977	158978	158972	158972	you	0	" "

159009	159023	158996	158996	I	0	" he replied , with a poor attempt to turn the matter lightly ; "
159076	159077	159078	159078	We	4075	" "
159091	159099	159088	159088	you	223	" Major Hockin made answer , scornfully . "
159169	159170	159162	159162	you	223	" "
159178	159179	159162	159162	you	223	" "

159279	159312	159277	159277	Sir	5017	" Mr. Goad 's large face became like a field of conflicting passions and low calculations . Terror , fury , cupidity , and doggedness never had a larger battle - field . "
159322	159336	159277	159277	Sir	5017	" he said , in a low voice and almost with a whine ; "
159351	159352	159345	159345	we	4085	" "
159360	159370	159371	159371	You	223	" the Major answered , with a downright stamp . "
159390	159391	159377	159377	You	223	" "
159401	159408	159392	159392	You	223	" the other answered , sulkily ; "
159433	159434	159435	159435	Peppery	370	" "
159478	159479	159485	159485	Major	223	" "
159605	159606	159594	159594	I	0	" "
159612	159634	159635	159635	Goad	195	" broke in the Major , who was grumbling to himself at the very idea of having any pepper in his nature "
159687	159779	159784	159785	A SAWYER	4099	" To me it was quite terrifying to see my comrade thus push his victory . Mr. Goad could have killed him at any moment , and but for me perhaps would have done so . But even in his fury he kept on casting glances of superstitious awe at me , while I stood quite still and gazed at him . Then he crossed the room to a great case of drawers , unlocked something above the Major 's head , made a sullen bow , and handed him a packet .
159947	160016	159931	159931	he	195	" July 31 , 1858 . Received directions from M. H. to attend without fail , at whatever expense , to any matter laid before us by a tall , dark gentleman bearing his card . M. H. considerably in our debt ; but his father can not last long . Understand what he means , having dealt with this matter before , and managed well with it . "
160241	160397	160506	160506	Goad	195	" August 3 . M. H. himself , as cool as ever , but shammed to be indignant . Said we were fools if we did not take it up . Not a farthing would he pay of his old account , and fellows like us could not bring actions . Also a hatful of money was to be made of this job , managed snugly . Emigrants to California were the easiest of all things to square up . A whole train of them disappeared this very year , by Indians or Mormons , and no bones made . The best and most active of us must go too ticklish for an agent . We must carry on all above - board out there , and as if sent by British government . In the far West no one any wiser . Resolved to go myself , upon having a certain sum in ready . "
160432	160502	160506	160506	Goad	195	" Mr. Goad 's memoranda of his adventures , and signal defeat by Uncle Sam , have no claim to be copied here , though differing much from my account . With their terse unfeeling strain , they might make people laugh who had not sadder things to think of . And it matters very little how that spy escaped , as such people almost always seem to do . "
160512	160529	160506	160506	Goad	195	" said Major Hockin , who had smiled sometimes , through some of his own remembrances ; "
160553	160554	160543	160550	the gentleman whom you have called ' M.H.	4108	" "
160587	160588	160583	160585	Sir Montague Hockin	281	" "
160597	160613	160594	160594	I	0	" the old man said , shortly , with a quick gleam in his eyes ; "
160654	160740	160650	160650	he	4108	" In all my little experience of life nothing yet astonished me more than this . I scarcely knew whom to believe , or what . That the Major , most upright of men , should take up his cousin 's roguery all new to him and speak of him thus ! But he gave me a nudge ; and being all confusion , I said nothing , and tried to look at neither of them , because my eyes must always tell the truth . "
160747	160864	160650	160650	he	4108	" Mr. Goad went on ; ' since my embassy failed , we have not been trusted with the confidence we had the right to expect . Ours is a peculiar business , Sir : ' Trust me in all , or trust me not at all , ' as one of our modern poets says , is the very essence of it . And possibly , Major , if that had been done , even your vigor and our sense of law might not have extorted from me what you have heard . Being cashiered , as we are , we act according to the strictest honor in divulging things no longer confided to us . "
160865	160959	160650	160650	he	4108	" Goad , you have done yourself the utmost credit , legally , intellectually , and well , I will not quite say morally . If I ever have a nasty job to do at least I mean a stealthy one which God , who has ever kept me straight , forbid ! I will take care not to lose your address . I have a very queer thing occurring on my manor I believe it is bound up with this affair never mind ; I must think I hate all underhanded work . "
160960	160991	160650	160650	he	4108	" Major , our charges are strictly moderate . We do in a week what takes lawyers a twelvemonth . Allow me to hand you one of our new cards . "
160992	161057	161062	161062	himself	4112	" No , no . My pockets are all full . And I do n't want to have it found among my papers . No offense , Mr. Goad , no offense at all . Society is not as it was when I was young . I condemn no modern institutions , Sir , though the world gets worse every day of its life . "
161161	161166	161149	161150	Mrs. Hockin	228	" But one thing , "
161173	161219	161167	161167	I	0	" do ask one thing before we go . That strange man who called himself ' Lord Castlewood ' here , and ' Captain Brown ' at Soberton have they any idea where to find him now ? And why does he not come forward ? "
161339	161351	161357	161357	he	223	" My dear , you must grow used to such things , "
161370	161455	161357	161357	he	223	" If it were not for death , how could any body live ? Right feeling is shown by considering such points , and making for the demise of others even more preparation than for our own . Otherwise there is a selfishness about it by no means Christian - minded . You look at things always from such an intense and even irreligious point of view . But such things are out of my line altogether . Your Aunt Mary understands them best . "
161456	161462	161463	161463	I	0	" Would you be able , "
161466	161493	161463	161463	I	0	" to account to Aunt Mary conscientiously for that dreadful story which I heard you tell ? I scarcely knew where I stood , Major Hockin . "
161494	161595	161357	161357	he	223	" You mean about Montague ? Family honor must be defended at any price . Child , I was greatly pained to go beyond the truth ; but in such a case it is imperative . I was shocked and amazed at my cousin 's conduct ; but how could I let such a fellow know that ? And think what I owe to his father , Sir Rufus ? No , no ; there are times when Bayard himself must stretch a point . Honor and religion alike demand it ; and Mrs. Hockin need never hear of it . "
161596	161605	161606	161606	I	0	" Certainly I shall not speak of it , "
161617	161649	161606	161606	I	0	" but you mean , of course , to find out all about it . It seems to me such a suspicious thing . But I never could bear Sir Montague . "
162205	162213	162214	162214	I	0	" All that might very well be , "
162217	162240	162214	162214	I	0	" but it would in no way serve to explain my father 's conduct , which was the great mystery of all . "
162413	162791	162408	162408	I	0	" MISS ' REMA , No good luck ever came , since you , to this Blue River Station , only to be washed away , and robbed by greasers , and shot through the ribs , and got more work than can do , and find an almighty nugget sent by Satan . And now the very worst luck of all have come , wholly and out of all denial , by you and your faces and graces and French goings on . Not that I do not like you , mind ; for you always was very polite to me , and done your best when you found me trying to put up with the trials put on me . But now this trial is the worst of all that ever come to my establishings ; and to go away now as I used to think of doing when tyrannized upon is out of my way altogether , and only an action fit for a half - breed . Sawyer Gundry hath cut and run , without a word behind him no instructions for orders in hand , and pouring in no directions where to find him , not even ' God bless you ' to any one of the many hands that looked up to him . Only a packet of dollars for me to pay the wages for two months to come , and a power of lawyer to receive all debts , and go on anyhow just the same . And to go on just the same is more than the worst of us has the heart for , without the sight of his old red face . He may have been pretty sharp , and too much the master now and then , perhaps ; but to do without him is a darned sight worse , and the hands do n't take to me like him . Many 's the time I have seen his faults , of having his own way , and such likes , and paying a man beyond his time if his wife was out of order . And many 's the time I have said myself I was fitter to be at the head of it . "
162933	163099	163100	163100	Sawyer	168	" But what we all want to know and old Suan took a black stick to make marks for you is why the old man hath run away , and where . Young Firm , who was getting a sight too uppish for me to have long put up with him , he was going about here , there , and every where , from the very first time of your going away , opening his mouth a deal too much , and asking low questions how long I stopped to dinner . Old Suan said he was troubled in his mind , as the pale - faces do about young girls , instead of dragging them to their wigwams ; and she would give him a spell to get over it . But nothing came of that ; and when the war broke out , he had words with his grandfather , and went off , so they said , to join the rebels . "
163167	163479	163515	163515	He	908	" The old man would never waste a bit of victuals , as you know , Miss ' Rema ; and , being acquaint with Suan 's way of watching , he had slipped all his supper aside from his plate , and put it on a clean pocket - handkerchief to lock it in the press till his appetite should serve ; and I caught him in the act , and it vexed him . ' Ha'n't you the manners to knock at the door ? ' he said ; and I said , ' Certainly , ' and went back and done it ; and , troubled as he was , he grinned a bit . Then he bowed his great head , as he always did when he knew he had gone perhaps a trifle too far with a man in my position . I nodded to forgive him , and he stood across , and saw that he could do no less than liquor me , after such behavior . But he only brought out one glass ; and I said , ' Come , Colonel , square is square , you know . ' ' Excuse of me , Martin , ' he said ; ' but no drop of strong drink passes the brim of my mouth till this gallivanting is done with . I might take too much , as the old men do , to sink what they do n't want to think on . ' ' You mean about bully - cock Firm , ' says I ; ' rebel Firm nigger - driver Firm . ' ' Hush ! ' he said ; ' no bad words about it . He has gone by his conscience and his heart . What do we know of what come inside of him ? ' "
163674	163793	163671	163671	Martin	198	" Instead of enjoying my cocktail , Miss ' Rema , I never was so down at mouth ; for , to my mind , his old heart was broken while he carried on so . And let every body say what they will , one thing there is no denying of . Never was seen on this side of the big hills a man fit to walk in the tracks of Uncle Sam , so large and good - hearted according to his lights , hard as a grizzly bear for a man to milk him , but soft in the breastbone as a young prairie - hen for all folk down upon their nine - pins . "
163894	164018	163891	163892	MARTIN CLOGFAST	198	" P.S. Ca n't carry on like this much longer . Enough to rip one 's heart up . You never would know the old place , miss . The heads of the horses is as long as their tails with the way they carry them ; the moss is as big as a Spaniard 's beard upon the kitchen door - sill ; and the old dog howls all day and night , like fifty thousand scalpers . Suan saith , if you was to come back , the lad might run home after you . ' Tisn't the lad I cares about so much , but poor old Sawyer , at his time of life , swallowed up in the wilderness . "
164223	164233	164234	164234	he	223	" Erema , I must speak to you alone , "
164237	164294	164234	164234	he	223	" no , not even you , Mrs. Strouss , if you please . If my ward likes to tell you , why , of course she can ; but nobody shall say that I did . There are things that belong to the family alone . The most loyal retainers you know what I mean . "
164295	164408	164422	164423	the Major	1607	" General , I was not aware that you belonged to the family . But this way , Sir ; this way , if you please . There is lath and plaster to that wall , and a crack in the panel of the door , Sir . But here is a room where I keep my jams , with double brick and patent locks , from sweet - toothed lodgers . The ' scutcheon goes over the key - hole , General . Perhaps you will see to that , while I roll up the carpet outside ; and then , if any retainers come , you will hear their footsteps . "
164409	164420	164422	164423	the Major	1607	" Bless the woman , what a temper she has ! "
164431	164442	164422	164423	the Major	1607	" Is she gone , Erema ? She wants discipline . "
164443	164450	164451	164451	I	0	" Yes , she is gone , "
164459	164469	164451	164451	I	0	" but you are enough to frighten any one . "
164470	164506	164422	164423	the Major	1607	" So far from that , she has quite frightened me . But never mind such trifles . Erema , since I saw you I have discovered , I may almost say , every thing . "
164550	164566	164567	164567	he	1607	" Perhaps you imagined when you placed the matter in my hands , Miss Castlewood , "
164588	164630	164567	164567	he	1607	" that you would be left in the hands of a man who encouraged a crop of hay under his feet . Never did you or any body make a greater mistake . That is not my character , Miss Castlewood . "
164631	164655	164656	164657	Major Hockin	223	" Why do you call me ' Miss Castlewood ' so ? You quite make me doubt my own right to the name . "
164693	164704	164705	164705	he	1607	" You are almost like Mrs. Strouss to - day , "
164712	164770	164771	164771	I	0	" What way is the wind ? I have often observed that when one female shows asperity , nearly all the others do the same . The weather affects them more than men , because they know nothing about it . But to come back are you prepared to hear what I have got to tell you ? "
164794	165015	164779	164779	he	1607	" Very well ; you wish me to go on . Perceiving how sadly you were upset by the result of those interviews , first with Handkin , and then with Goad , after leaving you here I drove at once to the office , studio , place of business , or whatever you please to call it , of the famous fellow in the portrait line , whose anagram , private mark , or whatever it is , was burned into the back of the ivory . Handkin told me the fellow was dead , or , of course , his work would be worth nothing ; but the name was carried on , and the register kept , at a little place somewhere in Soho , where , on the strength of his old repute , they keep up a small trade with inferior hands . I gave them a handsome order for a thing that will never be handsome , I fear my old battered physiognomy . And then I produced the locket which in some queer state of mind you had given me , and made them hunt out their old books , and at last discovered the very entry . But to verify it I must go to Paris , where his son is living . "
165016	165024	165252	165252	my	0	" Whose son ? Lord Castlewood 's ? "
165025	165212	164779	164779	he	1607	" Erema , have you taken leave of your senses ? What son has Lord Castlewood ? The artist 's son , to be sure ; the son of the man who did the likeness . Is it the vellum and the stuff upon it that has so upset your mind ? I am glad that you showed it to me , because it would have been mean to do otherwise . But show it to no one else , my dear , except your cousin , Lord Castlewood . He has the first right of all to know it , though he will laugh at it as I do . Trumpery of that sort ! Let them produce a certified copy of a register . If they could do that , need they ever have shot that raffish old lord I beg pardon , my dear your highly respected grandfather ? No , no ; do n't tell me . Nicholas Hockin was never in any way famous for want of brains , my dear , and he tells you to keep your pluck up . "
165213	165221	165222	165222	I	0	" I never can thank you enough , "
165225	165250	165222	165222	I	0	" for such inspiriting counsel . I have been rather miserable all this day . And I have had such a letter from America ! "
165469	165478	165479	165479	he	1607	" How many times have you been brave ? "
165510	165676	165683	165683	I	0	" Six , if not seven , times you have displayed considerable valor . Are you going to fall away through some wretched imagination of your own ? Now do n't stop to argue time will not allow it . I have put Cosmopolitan Jack as well upon the track of Captain Brown . I have not told you half of what I could tell , and what I am doing ; but never mind , never mind ; it is better that you should not know too much , my dear . Young minds , from their want of knowledge of the world , are inclined to become uneasy . Now go to bed and sleep soundly , Erema , for we have lots to do to - morrow , and you have had a most worrying day to - day . To - morrow , of course , you must come with me to Paris . You can parleyvoo better than I can . "
165905	165908	165899	165899	he	382	" Hush ! "
165918	165922	165909	165909	I	0	" How long ? "
165927	165961	165924	165924	he	382	" Four - and - twenty hours now ; and a more peacefuller end was never seen , and to lament was sinful ; but he was blessed if he could help it . "
166111	166118	166119	166119	she	299	" He gives himself such airs ! "
166168	166169	166153	166153	They	4194	" "
166211	166212	166208	166209	my cousin	6288	" "
166335	166336	166337	166337	I	0	" "
166360	166361	166408	166409	His lordship	2013	" "
166627	166724	166608	166609	his lordship	2013	" All that night and three days more he slept as sound as a little child , to make up for so many years . We called two doctors in ; but they only whispered and looked dismal , and told us to have hot water ready at any hour of the day or night . Nobody loved him as I did , miss , from seeing so much of his troubles and miraculous way of bearing them ; and I sat by the hour and hour , and watched him , trusting no paid nurses . "
166867	167042	167044	167044	I	0	" He did not seem to comprehend me , but only watched the window ; and if ever a blessed face there was , looking toward heaven 's glory , his lordship had it , so that I could scarcely keep from sobbing . For I never had seen any living body die , but knew that it must be so . He heard me catching my breath , perhaps , or at any rate he looked at me ; and the poor angel knew that I was a woman ; and being full of high respect , as he always was for females in spite of the way they had served him it became apparent to his mind that the pearl button of his neck was open , as ordered by the doctors . And he tried to lift his hand to do it ; and then he tried to turn away , but could not manage either . Poor dear ! the only movement he could make was to a better world . "
167131	167211	167235	167235	she	299	" Perhaps I ought to have rung the bell for others to be present . But his lordship was always shy , you know , miss ; and with none of his kindred left , and no wife to say ' good - by ' to him , right or wrong I resolved alone to see him depart to his everlasting rest . And people may talk about hirelings , but I think nobody loved him as I did . "
167279	167291	167292	167292	she	299	" Well , miss , we all must come and go , "
167299	167423	167292	167292	she	299	" and , good and great as he was , his lordship has left few to mourn for him . Only the birds and beasts and animals that he was so good to ; they will miss him , if men do n't . There came one of his favorite pigeons , white as snow all over , and sat on the sill of the window , and cooed , and arched up its neck for his fingers . And he tried to put his fingers out , but they were ice already . Whether that or something else brought home his thoughts , who knows , miss ? but he seemed to mix the pigeon up with some of his own experience . "
167492	167635	167479	167479	he	0	" ' Bitter grief and pain shall never come again , ' he seemed to breathe , with a calm , soft smile , like a child with its rhyme about the rain when the sun breaks out ; and sure enough , the sun upon the quilt above his heart was shining , as if there could be no more clouds . Then he whispered a few short words to the Lord , more in the way of thanks than prayer , and his eyes seemed to close of their own accord , or with some good spirit soothing them . And when or how his sleep passed from this world into the other there was scarcely the flutter of a nerve to show . There he lies , like an image of happiness . Will you come and see him ? "
167974	167978	168004	168004	he	190	" the long robe "
168303	168309	168280	168280	he	190	" The right honorable Baroness Castlewood "
168933	168944	168945	168945	I	0	" Who are you ? What do you want here ? "
169089	169096	169097	169097	he	4268	" The Baroness is not brave , "
169106	169127	169097	169097	he	4268	" but she need have no fear now of me . Does her ladyship happen to know who I am ? "
169128	169136	169097	169097	he	4268	" The man who murdered my grandfather . "
169137	169247	169248	169248	I	0	" Yes , if you put a false color on events . The man who punished a miscreant , according to the truer light . But I am not here to argue points . I intend to propose a bargain . Once for all , I will not harm you . Try to listen calmly . Your father behaved like a man to me , and I will be no worse to you . The state of the law in this country is such that I am forced to carry fire - arms . Will it conduce to your peace of mind if I place myself at your mercy ? "
169309	169428	169272	169272	Wrath	385	" You will not take it ? Very well ; it lies here at your service . If your father 's daughter likes to shoot me , from one point of view it will be just ; and but for one reason , I care not . Do n't look at me with pity , if you please . For what I have done I feel no remorse , no shadow of repentance . It was the best action of my life . But time will fail , unless you call upon your courage speedily . None of your family lack that ; and I know that you possess it . Call your spirit up , my dear . "
169429	169446	169272	169272	Wrath	385	" Oh , please not to call me that ! How dare you call me that ? "
169447	169494	169272	169272	Wrath	385	" That is right . I did it on purpose . And yet I am your uncle . Not by the laws of men , but by the laws of God if there are such things . Now , have you the strength to hear me ? "
169495	169520	169272	169272	Wrath	385	" Yes ; I am quite recovered now . I can follow every word you say . But but I must sit down again . "
169521	169561	169272	169272	Wrath	385	" Certainly . Sit there , and I will stand . I will not touch or come nearer to you than a story such as mine requires . You know your own side of it ; now hear mine . "
169671	169804	169657	169657	he	4274	" This was Winifred Hoyle , the daughter of Thomas Hoyle , a farmer , in a lonely part of Hampshire , and among the moors of Rambledon . The nobleman lost his way , while fishing , and being thirsty , went to ask for milk . What matter how it came about ? He managed to win her heart before she heard of his rank and title . He persuaded her even to come and meet him in the valley far from her father 's house , where he was wo nt to angle ; and there , on a lonely wooden bridge across a little river , he knelt down as men used to do and pledged his solemn truth to her . His solemn lie his solemn lie ! "
169954	170031	169947	169947	villains	4292	" But he gave her attestation and certificate under his own hand ; and her poor father signed it , and saw it secured in a costly case , and then went home as proud as need be for the father of a peer , but sworn to keep it three years secret , till the king should give consent . Such foul lies it was the pride of a lord to tell to a farmer . "
170096	170097	170085	170085	you	4294	" "
170106	170115	170098	170098	You	4294	" I answered , meeting fierce eyes mildly ; "
170155	170156	170149	170149	gentlemen	1613	" "
170397	170474	170475	170475	You	4317	" There and thus I saw the light beneath most noble auspices . But I need not go on with all that . As long as human rules remain , this happy tale will always be repeated with immense applause . My mother 's love was turned to bitter hatred of his lordship , and , when her father died from grief , to eager thirst for vengeance . And for this purpose I was born . "
170626	170871	170883	170883	I	0	" The history of my mother and myself does not concern you . Such people are of no account until they grow dangerous to the great . We lived in cheap places and wandered about , caring for no one , and cared for by the same . Mrs. Hoyle and Thomas Hoyle we called ourselves when we wanted names ; and I did not even know the story of our wrongs till the heat and fury of youth were past . Both for her own sake and mine my mother concealed it from me . Pride and habit , perhaps , had dulled her just desire for vengeance ; and , knowing what I was , she feared the thing which has befallen me . But when I was close upon thirty years old , and my mother eight - and - forty for she was betrayed in her teens a sudden illness seized her . Believing her death to be near , she told me , as calmly as possible , every thing , with all those large , quiet views of the past , which at such a time seem the regular thing , but make the wrong tenfold blacker . She did not die ; if she had , it might have been better both for her and me , and many other people . Are you tired of my tale ? Or do you want to hear the rest ? "
170872	170882	170883	170883	I	0	" You can not be asking me in earnest , "
170894	170906	170883	170883	I	0	" Tell me the rest , if you are not afraid . "
170907	171004	171005	171005	I	0	" Afraid , indeed ! Then , for want of that proper tendance and comfort which a few pounds would have brought her , although she survived , she survived as a wreck , the mere relic and ruin of her poor unhappy self . I sank my pride for her sake , and even deigned to write to him , in rank and wealth so far above me , in every thing else such a clot below my heel . He did the most arrogant thing a snob can do he never answered my letter . "
171214	171258	171204	171204	I	0	" What identity had I to prove ? He had taken good care of that . I turned my back on him and left the house , without even asking for his curse , though as precious as a good man 's blessing . "
171357	171459	171462	171462	he	4345	" I made his acquaintance , with deference , of course , and we got on very well together . At one time it seemed good luck for him to have illegitimate kindred ; for I saved his life when he was tangled in the weeds of this river while bathing . You owe me no thanks . I thought twice about it , and if the name would have ended with him , I would never have used my basket - knife . By trade I am a basket - maker , like many another ' love - child . ' "
171587	171620	171581	171581	I	0	" How terrified you look ! I am coming to it now . Are you sure that you can bear it ? It is nothing very harrowing ; but still , young ladies "
171621	171628	171629	171629	I	0	" I feel a little faint , "
171635	171657	171581	171581	I	0	" but that is nothing . I must hear the whole of it . Please to go on without minding me . "
171658	171723	171725	171725	his	4350	" For my own sake I will not , as well as for yours . I can not have you fainting , and bringing people here . Go to the house and take food , and recover your strength , and then come here again . I promise to be here , and your father 's daughter will not take advantage of my kindness . "
172031	172038	172039	172039	he	786	" I hope you are better , "
172053	172102	172039	172039	he	786	" Now have no fear of me , once more I tell you . I will not sham any admiration , affection , or any thing of that kind ; but as for harming you why , your father was almost the only kind heart I ever met ! "
172103	172126	172039	172039	he	786	" Then why did you send a most vile man to fetch me , when my father was dead in the desert ? "
172127	172173	172039	172039	he	786	" I never did any thing of the sort . It was done in my name , but not by me ; I never even heard of it until long after , and I have a score to settle with the man who did it . "
172174	172229	172039	172039	he	786	" But Mr. Goad told me himself that you came and said you were the true Lord Castlewood , and ordered him at once to America . I never saw truth more plainly stamped on a new situation the face of a rogue than I saw it then on the face of Mr. Goad . "
172230	172364	172039	172039	he	786	" You are quite right ; he spoke the truth to the utmost of his knowledge . I never saw Goad , and he never saw me . I never even dreamed of pretending to the title . I was personated by a mean , low friend of Sir Montague Hockin ; base - born as I am , I would never stoop to such a trick . You will find out the meaning of that by - and - by . I have taken the law into my own hands it is the only way to work such laws I have committed what is called a crime . But , compared with Sir Montague Hockin , I am whiter than yonder shearling on his way to the river for his evening drink . "
172453	172457	172458	172458	he	4360	" Very well , "
172472	172580	172458	172458	he	4360	" your father was kind to me , very kind indeed ; but he knew the old lord too well to attempt to interpose on my behalf . On the other hand , he gave no warning of my manifest resolve ; perhaps he thought it a woman 's threat , and me no better than a woman ! And partly for his sake , no doubt , though mainly for my mother 's , I made the short work which I made ; for he was horribly straitened and in his free , light way he told me so by his hard curmudgeon of a father . "
172649	172714	172612	172612	he	6003	" That he should dare thus to pollute the spot where he had so forsworn himself ! I resolved that there he should pay justice , either with his life or death . And I went to your father 's place to tell him to prepare for disturbances ; but he was gone to see his wife , and I simply borrowed a pistol . "
172876	172995	173005	173006	the God	4373	" How all this drove me no tongue can tell . But I never let her know it ; I only said , ' Mother , he shall come and see you if he ever sees any body more ! ' And she trusted me and was satisfied . She only said , ' Take my picture , Thomas , to remind him of the happy time , and his pledge to me inside of it . ' And she gave me what she had kept for years in a bag of chamois leather , the case of which I spoke before , which even in our hardest times she would never send to the pawn - shop . "
173080	173114	173072	173072	you	4377	" For answer I only bowed my head . His calm , methodical way of telling his tale , like a common adventure with a dog , was more shocking than any fury . "
173221	173312	173215	173215	I	0	" The night was soft , and dark in patches where the land or wood closed in ; and the stream was brown and threw no light , though the moon was on the uplands . Time and place alike were fit for our little explanation . The path wound down the meadow toward me , and I knew that he must come . My firm intention was to spare him , if he gave me a chance of it ; but he never had the manners to do that . "
173414	173488	173492	173492	he	4392	" If he had even sighed , I might have felt more kindness toward him ; but he only gave something between a cough and a grunt , and I clearly heard him say , ' Gout to - morrow morning ! what the devil did I drink port - wine for ! ' He struck the ground with his stick and came onward , thinking far more of his feet than heart . "
173549	173587	173606	173606	I	0	" ' Fellow , out of the way ! ' he cried , with a most commanding voice and air , though only too well he knew me ; and my wrath against him began to rise . "

173770	173796	173808	173808	he	190	" In spite of all his pride , he trembled as if I had been Death himself , instead of his own dear eldest son . "
173837	173909	173808	173808	he	190	" ' Miser , none of your money for us ! it is too late for your half crowns ! We must have a little of what you have grudged having none to spare your honor . My demands are simple , and only two . My mother is fool enough to yearn for one more sight of your false face ; you will come with me and see her . ' "

Allow me to go back and to sit in a dry place ; I am tired , and no longer young ; you are bound to hear my tale as well . I passed a dry stump just now ; I will go back : there is no fear of interruption . ' My lord was talking against time . "

My right arm was crippled by his heavy stick ; but I am left - handed , as a bastard should be .

But your father was good to me , and I loved him , though I had no right to love any one . My letter will show that I wronged him never . The weight of the world is off my mind since I have told you every thing ; you can send me to the gallows , if you think fit , but leave it till my mother dies . Good - by , poor child . I have spoiled your life , but only by chance consequence , not in murder - birth as I was born . "
175257	175262	175248	175248	She	590	" for her sake , "
175325	175327	175335	175335	they	4429	" Guilty "
175707	175735	175698	175699	the Major	1607	" for that ancient and obsolete town , rejuvenized now by its Signor . The cause of my good friend 's silence not to use that affected word "
175737	175769	175770	175771	Mr. Stixon	298	" was quite unknown to me , and disturbed my spirit with futile guesses . Resolute , therefore , to pierce the bottom of every surviving mystery , I made claim upon "
175774	175776	175770	175771	Mr. Stixon	298	" as "
175780	175834	175770	175771	Mr. Stixon	298	" had now vindicated his right to be called , up to supper - time and he with high chivalry responded . Not yet was he wedded to Miss Polly Hopkins , the daughter of the pickled - pork man ; otherwise would he or could he have made telegraphic blush at the word "
175837	175929	175770	175771	Mr. Stixon	298	" And would he have been quite so eager to come ? Such things are trifling , compared to our own , which naturally fill the universe . I was bound to be a great lady now , and patronize and regulate and drill all the doings of nature . So I durst not even ask , though desiring much to do so , how young Mr. Stixon was getting on with his delightful Polly . And his father , as soon as he found me turned into the mistress , and "
175932	176490	176491	176491	Driver	6422	" as he would have me called thenceforth , whether or no on my part , not another word would he tell me of the household sentiments , politics , or romances . It would have been thought a thing beneath me to put any nice little questions now , and I was obliged to take up the tone which others used toward me . But all the while I longed for freedom , Uncle Sam , Suan Isco , and even Martin of the Mill . Law business , however , and other hinderances , kept me from starting at once for Bruntsea , impatient as I was to do so . Indeed , it was not until the morning of the last Saturday in November that I was able to get away . The weather had turned to much rain , I remember , with two or three tempestuous nights , and the woods were almost bare of leaves , and the Thames looked brown and violent . In the fly from Newport to Bruntsea I heard great rollers thundering heavily upon the steep bar of shingle , and such a lake of water shone in the old bed of the river that I quite believed at first that the Major had carried out his grand idea , and brought the river back again . But the flyman shook his head , and looked very serious , and told me that he feared bad times were coming . What I saw was the work of the Lord in heaven , and no man could prevail against it . He had always said , though no concern of his for he belonged to Newport that even a British officer could not fly in the face of the Almighty . He himself had a brother on the works , regular employed , and drawing good money , and proud enough about it ; and the times he had told him across a pint of ale howsomever , our place was to hope for the best ; but the top of the springs was not come yet , and a pilot out of Newport told him the water was making uncommon strong ; but he did hope the wind had nigh blowed itself out ; if not , they would have to look blessed sharp tomorrow . He had heard say that in time of Queen Elizabeth sixscore of houses was washed clean away , and the river itself knocked right into the sea ; and a thing as had been once might just come to pass again , though folk was all so clever now they thought they wor above it . But , for all that , their grandfathers ' goggles might fit them . But here we was in Bruntsea town , and , bless his old eyes yes ! If I pleased to look along his whip , I might see ancient pilot come , he did believe , to warn of them ! Following his guidance , I descried a stout old man , in a sailor 's dress , weather - proof hat , and long boots , standing on a low seawall , and holding vehement converse with some Bruntsea boatmen and fishermen who were sprawling on the stones as usual . "
176502	176506	176491	176491	Driver	6422	" I said , "
176514	176515	176520	176520	him	6422	" "
176522	176527	176520	176520	him	6422	" the flyman answered ; "
176594	176610	176592	176592	miss	5145	" With these words he turned to the right , and drove into Major Hockin 's "
176614	176693	176592	176592	miss	5145	" There we stopped to hear what was going on , and it proved to be well worth our attention . The old pilot perhaps had exhausted reason , and now was beginning to give way to wrath . The afternoon was deepening fast , with heavy gray clouds lowering , showing no definite edge , but streaked with hazy lines , and spotted by some little murky blurs or blots , like tar pots , carried slowly . "
176703	176739	176695	176695	Noah	391	" the ancient pilot shouted , pointing with one hand at these , and with a clinched fist at the sea , whence came puffs of sullen air , and turned his gray locks backward . "
176830	176831	176839	176840	old man	4461	" "
176842	176846	176839	176840	old man	4461	" said one , "

176875	176879	176873	176873	mate	4463	" cried another . "
176907	176908	176904	176905	Master Banks	392	" "
176934	176935	176949	176949	Banks	392	" "

176970	176983	176949	176949	Banks	392	" the pilot answered , turning away in a rage from them . "
177066	177125	177126	177126	You	4461	" He set one foot against our Major 's wall an action scarcely honest while it was so green and , coming from a hale and very thickset man , the contemptuous push sent a fathom of it outward . Rattle , rattle went the new patent concrete , starting up the lazy - pated fellows down below . "
177135	177139	177126	177126	You	4461	" cried one . "
177147	177184	177140	177140	You	4461	" shouted another . The rest bade him go to a place much worse ; but he buttoned his jacket in disdain , and marched away , without spoiling the effect by any more weak words . "
177189	177193	177195	177195	you	4461	" cried my flyman "
177219	177321	177322	177322	You	4461	" All this , and the ominous scowl of the sky and menacing roar of the sea already crowding with black rollers , disturbed me so that I could say nothing , until , at the corner of the grand new hotel , we met Major Hockin himself , attired in a workman 's loose jacket , and carrying a shovel . He was covered with mud and dried flakes of froth , and even his short white whiskers were incrusted with sparkles of brine ; but his face was ruddy and smiling , and his manner as hearty as ever . "
177347	177348	177343	177343	I	0	" "
177389	177390	177367	177367	You	4461	" "

177474	177478	177468	177468	you	4461	" I said ; "

177604	177605	177607	177607	Bruntsea	232	" "
177614	177660	177607	177607	Bruntsea	232	" I replied , gazing sadly at the gulf which parted us from the Sea Parade , the Lyceum , and Baths , the Bastion Promenade , and so on ; beyond all which the streaky turmoil and misty scud of the waves were seen . "
177668	177676	177607	177607	Bruntsea	232	" he retorted , with a laugh . "
177938	177939	177940	177940	You	4483	" "
178061	178062	178168	178168	Erema	160	" "
178087	178167	178168	178168	Erema	160	" Major Hockin so seldom spoke in this didactic way , and I was so unable to make it out , that , having expected some tiff on his part at my juvenile arrogance , I was just in the mould for a deep impression from sudden stamp of philosophy . I had nothing to say in reply , and he went up in my opinion greatly . He knew it ; and he said , with touching kindness , "
178547	178590	178513	178513	instanter	4504	" Major Hockin certainly possessed the art so meritorious in a host of making people hungry ; and we mounted the hill with alacrity , after passing his letter - box , which reminded me of the mysterious lady . He pointed to "
178594	178902	178513	178513	instanter	4504	" as he called it , and said that he believed she was there still , though she never came out now to watch their house . And a man of dark and repelling aspect had been seen once or twice by his workmen , during the time of their night relays , rapidly walking toward Desolate Hole . How any one could live in such a place , with the roar and the spray of the sea , as it had been , at the very door , and through the windows , some people might understand , but not the Major . Good Mrs. Hockin received me with her usual warmth and kindness , and scolded me for having failed to write more to her , as all people seem to do when conscious of having neglected that duty themselves . Then she showed me her thimble - finger , which certainly was a little swollen ; and then she poured forth her gratitude for her many blessings , as she always did after any little piece of grumbling . And I told her that if at her age I were only a quarter as pleasant and sweet of temper , I should consider myself a blessing to any man . After dinner my host produced the locket , which he had kept for the purpose of showing it to the artist 's son in Paris , and which he admired so intensely that I wished it were mine to bestow on him . Then I told him that , through a thing wholly unexpected the confession of the criminal himself no journey to Paris was needful now . I repeated that strange and gloomy tale , to the loud accompaniment of a rising wind and roaring sea , while both my friends listened intently . "
178915	178919	178908	178908	him	4506	" they asked ; "

179034	179039	179040	179040	You	4507	" the Major said . "
179128	179129	179119	179119	you	4507	" "
179136	179143	179132	179132	I	0	" I pleaded , with surprise . "

179469	179479	179480	179481	Mrs. Hockin	228	" My dear , I scarcely like such talk , "
179485	179552	179480	179481	Mrs. Hockin	228	" To me it seems almost defiant of the power of the Lord . Remember what happened to poor Smeaton at least I think his name was Smeaton , or Stanley , was it ? But I dare say you know best . He defied the strength of the Lord , like the people at the mouth of their tent , and he was swallowed up . "
179553	179647	179480	179481	Mrs. Hockin	228	" Mary , my dear , get your prayer - book . Rasper 's fly is waiting for us , and the parson has no manners . When he drops off , I present to the living ; and I am not at all sure that I shall let George have it . He is fond of processions , and all that stuff . The only procession in the Church of England is that of the lord of the manor to his pew . I will be the master in my own church . "
179648	179716	179717	179717	We	4524	" Of course , dear , of course ; so you ought to be . It always was so in my father 's parish . But you must not speak so of our poor George . He may be ' High - Church , ' as they call it ; but he knows what is due to his family , and he has a large one coming . "

180047	180128	180028	180028	Some	465	" he had challenged the oldest inhabitant to come and try his focus . Despite all the rattle and roar of the wind , we went on in church as usual . The vicar had a stout young curate from Durham , who could outshout any tempest , with a good stone wall between them ; and the Bruntsea folk were of thicker constitution than to care an old hat for the weather .

For nearly half a mile had we to pass of raging and boisterous water , almost as wild as the open sea itself at the breaches of the pebble ridge . And the risk of a heavy sea boarding us was fearfully multiplied by having thus to cross the storm instead of breasting it . Useless and helpless , and only in the way , and battered about by wind and sea , so that my Sunday dress was become a drag , what folly , what fatuity , what frenzy , I might call it , could ever have led me to jump into that boat ?

183336	183439	183330	183330	I	0	" The boat labored on , with a good many grunts , but not a word from any one . More than once we were obliged to fetch up as a great billow topped the poor shingle bank ; and we took so much water on board that the men said afterward that I saved them . I only remember sitting down and working at the bucket with both hands , till much of the skin was gone , and my arms and many other places ached . But what was that to be compared with drowning ? At length we were opposite "
183443	183528	183330	183330	I	0	" which was a hole no longer , but filled and flooded with the churning whirl and reckless dominance of water . Tufts and tussocks of shattered brush and rolling wreck played round it , and the old gray stone of mullioned windows split the wash like mooring - posts . We passed and gazed ; but the only sound was the whistling of the tempest , and the only living sight a sea - gull , weary of his wings , and drowning . "
183536	183544	183330	183330	I	0	" the Major broke our long silence . "
183563	183863	183330	183330	I	0	" The men lay back on their oars to fetch the gallant boat to the wind again , when through a great gap in the ruins they saw a sight that startled manhood . At the back of that ruin , on the landward side , on a wall which , tottered under them , there were two figures standing . One a tall man , urging on , the other a woman shrinking . At a glance , or with a thought , I knew them both . One was Lord Castlewood 's first love , the other his son and murderer . Our men shouted with the whole power of their hearts to tell that miserable pair to wait till succor should be brought to them . And the Major stood up and waved his hat , and in doing so tumbled back again . I can not tell how could I tell in the thick of it ? but an idea or a flit of fancy touched me and afterward became conviction that while the man heard us not at all , and had no knowledge of us , his mother turned round and saw us all , and faced the storm in preference . Whatever the cause may have been , at least she suddenly changed her attitude . The man had been pointing to the roof , which threatened to fall in a mass upon them , while she had been shuddering back from the depth of eddying waves below her . But now she drew up her poor bent figure , and leaned on her son to obey him . Our boat , with strong arms laboring for life , swept round the old gable of the ruin ; but we were compelled to "
183869	183999	183330	183330	I	0	" as Captain Barnes shouted ; and then a black squall of terrific wind and hail burst forth . We bowed our heads and drew our bodies to their tightest compass , and every rib of our boat vibrated as a violin does ; and the oars were beaten flat , and dashed their drip into fringes like a small - toothed comb . That great squall was either a whirlwind or the crowning blast of a hurricane . It beat the high waves hollow , as if it fell from the sky upon them ; and it snapped off one of our oars at the hilt , so that two of our men rolled backward . And when we were able to look about again the whole roof of "
184002	184152	184153	184154	Brave fellow	4668	" was gone , and little of the walls left standing . And how we should guide our course , or even save our lives , we knew not . We were compelled to bring up as best we might with the boat 's head to the sea , and so to keep it by using the steering gear against the surviving oar . As for the people we were come to save , there was no chance whatever of approaching them . Even without the mishap to the oar , we never could have reached them . And indeed when first we saw them again they seemed better off than ourselves were . For they were not far from dry land , and the man a skillful and powerful swimmer had a short piece of plank , which he knew how to use to support his weak companion . "
184159	184171	184156	184157	fine fellow	4669	" the Major cried , little knowing whom he was admiring . "
184233	184326	184226	184226	God	162	" In horror and pity we gazed . The man had been dashed against something headlong . He whirled round and round in white water , his legs were thrown up , and we saw no more of him . The woman cast off the plank , and tossed her helpless arms in search of him . A shriek , ringing far on the billowy shore , declared that she had lost him ; and then , without a struggle , she clasped her hands , and the merciless water swallowed her . "

184485	184520	184483	184483	Barnes	402	" we must run her ashore at once ; tide has turned ; we might be blown out to sea , with one oar , and then the Lord Himself could n't save us . "
184574	184595	184597	184598	Mr. Barnes	405	" Go home , Captain , as fast as you can , and take the young lady along of you , "
184612	184639	184597	184598	Mr. Barnes	405	" We are born to the drip , but not you , Sir ; and you are not so young as you was , you know . "

On board of that boat you took the lead , and that may have misled you . I am very much obliged to you , I am sure , for all your skill and courage , which have saved the lives of all of us . But on land you will just obey me . "
184757	184767	184650	184654	the lord of the manor	2610	" Sartinly , Captain . What 's your orders ? "
184768	184864	184875	184875	him	4690	" Nothing at all . I give no orders . I only make suggestions . But if your experience sees a way to recover those two poor bodies , let us try it at once at once , Barnes . Erema , run home . This is no scene for you . And tell Margaret to put on the double - bottomed boiler , with the stock she made on Friday , and a peck of patent pease . There is nothing to beat pea soup ; and truly one never knows what may happen . "

Sodden and blurred as the writing was , I knew the clear , firm hand , the same which on the envelope at Shoxford had tempted me to meanness . This letter was from Thomas Hoyle ; the Major had taken it from the pocket of his corpse ; all doubt about his death was gone . When he felt his feet on the very shore , and turned to support his mother , a violent wave struck the back of his head upon Major Hockin 's pillar - box . Such sadness came into my heart though sternly it should have been gladness that I begged their pardon , and went away , as if with a private message . And wicked as it may have been , to read was more than once to cry . The letter began abruptly : "
185601	185692	185595	185595	I	0	" There was no compact of any kind between your father and myself . He forbore at first to tell what he must have known , partly , perhaps , to secure my escape , and partly for other reasons . If he had been brought to trial , his duty to his family and himself would have led him , no doubt , to explain things . And if that had failed , I would have returned and surrendered myself . As things happened , there was no need . "
185874	186111	186116	186116	me	0	" In any case , there was no necessity for my interference ; and being denied by fate all sense of duty to a father , I was naturally driven to double my duty to my mother , whose life was left hanging upon mine . So we two for many years wandered about , shunning islands and insular prejudice . I also shunned your father , though so far as I know he neither sought me nor took any trouble to clear himself . If the one child now left him had been a son , heir to the family property and so on , he might have behaved quite otherwise , and he would have been bound to do so . But having only a female child , who might never grow up , and , if she did , was very unlikely to succeed , he must have resolved at least to wait . And perhaps he confirmed himself with the reflection that even if people believed his tale so long after date and so unvouched , so far as family annals were concerned , the remedy would be as bad as the disease . Moreover , he owed his life to me , at great risk of my own ; and to pay such a debt with the hangman 's rope would scarcely appear quite honorable , even in the best society . "
186155	186329	186330	186330	We	4727	" One summer , in the Black Forest , I fell in with an outcast Englishman , almost as great a vagabond as myself . He was under the ban of the law for writing his father 's name without license . He did not tell me that , or perhaps even I might have despised him , for I never was dishonest . But one great bond there was between us we both detested laws and men . My intimacy with him is the one thing in life which I am ashamed of . He passed by a false name then , of course . But his true name was Montague Hockin . My mother was in very weak health then , and her mind for the most part clouded ; and I need not say that she knew nothing of what I had done for her sake . That man pretended to take the greatest interest in her condition , and to know a doctor at Baden who could cure her . "
186429	186596	186411	186411	I	0	" Then he came one night , with the finest style and noblest contempt of every thing . We must prepare ourselves for great news , and all our kindness to him would be repaid tenfold in a week or two . Let me go into Freyburg that time to - morrow night , and listen . I asked him nothing as to what he meant , for I was beginning to weary of him , as of every body . However , I thought it just worth while , having some one who bought my wicker - work , to enter the outskirts of the town on the following evening , and wait to be told if any news was stirring . And the people were amazed at my not knowing that last night the wife of an English lord for so they called him , though no lord yet had run away with a golden - bearded man , believed to be also English . "
186682	186928	186936	186936	she	409	" It need not be said that he does not know my story from any word of mine . To such a fellow I was not likely to commit my mother 's fate . But he seems to have guessed at once that there was something strange in my history ; and then , after spying and low prying at my mother , to have shaped his own conclusion . Then , having entirely under his power that young fool who left a kind husband for him , he conceived a most audacious scheme . This was no less than to rob your cousin , the last Lord Castlewood , not of his wife and jewels and ready money only , but also of all the disposable portion of the Castlewood estates . For the lady 's mother had taken good care , like a true Hungarian , to have all the lands settled upon her daughter , so far as the husband could deal with them . And though , at the date of the marriage , he could not really deal at all with them your father being still alive it appears that his succession when it afterward took place was bound , at any rate , as against himself . A divorce might have canceled this I can not say but your late cousin was the last man in the world to incur the needful exposure . Upon this they naturally counted . "

187182	187257	187258	187258	You	4743	" With this in view , he was fool enough to set the detective police after me me , who could snap all their noses off ! For he saw how your heart was all set on one thing , and expected to have you his serf forever , by the simple expedient of hanging me . The detectives failed , as they always do . He also failed in his overtures to you . "

You will also restore , as I shall direct , the trinket upon which she sets great value , and for which I sought vainly when we came back to England . I happen to know that you have it now . "

Your grandfather seems to have had too much , and your father far too little . We must keep this matter quiet . Neither the man nor the woman must we know , or a nice stir we shall have in all the county papers . There must be an inquest , of course , upon them both ; but none of the fellows read this direction , for the admirable reason that they can not read . Our coming forward could do no good , and just now Bruntsea has other things to think of ; and , first and foremost , my ruin , as they say . "

Having burst my barricade , the sea shall stop inside and pay for it . Far less capital will be required . By Jove , what a fool I must have been not to see the hand of Providence in all this ! Mary , can you spare me a minute , my dear ? The noblest idea has occurred to me . Well , never mind , if you are busy ; perhaps I had better not state it crudely , though it is not true that it happens every hour . I shall turn it over in my mind throughout the evening service . I mean to be there , just to let them see . They think that I am crushed , of course . They will see their mistake ; and , Erema , you may come . The gale is over , and the evening bright . You sit by the fire , Mary , my dear ; I shall not let you out again ; keep the silver kettle boiling . In church I always think more clearly than where people talk so much . But when I come home I require something . I see , I see . Instead of an idle , fashionable lounging - place for nincompoops from London , instead of flirtation and novel - reading , vulgarity , show , and indecent attire , and positively immoral bathing , we will now have industry , commerce , wealth , triumph of mechanism , lofty enterprise , and international good - will . A harbor has been the great want of this coast ; see what a thing it is at Newport ! We will now have a harbor and floating docks , without any muddy , malarious river all blue water from the sea ; and our fine cliff range shall be studded with good houses . And the whole shall be called ' Erema - port . ' "

193732	193746	193822	193824	the old man	908	" Still , it was an odd thing for your ladyship to say . "
193747	193816	193647	193647	he	181	" Uncle Sam , I am nobody 's ladyship , least of all yours . What makes you speak so ? I am your own little wandering child , whose life you saved , and whose father you loved , and who loses all who love her . Even from you I am forced to go away . Oh , why is it always my fate my fate ? "
193817	193820	193822	193824	the old man	908	" Hush ! "
193835	193988	193827	193827	I	0	" To talk of fate , my dearie , shows either one thing or the other that we have no will of our own , or else that we know not how to guide it . I never knew a good man talk of fate . The heathens and the pagans made it . The Lord in heaven is enough for me ; and He always hath allowed me my own free - will , though I may not have handled ' un cleverly . And He giveth you your own will now , my missy to go from us or to stop with us . And being as you are a very grand young woman now , owning English land and income paid in gold instead of greenbacks the same as our nugget seems likely to my ideas it would be wrong if we was so much as to ask you . "
193989	194025	193822	193824	the old man	908	" Is that what you are full of , then , and what makes you so mysterious ? I did think that you knew me better , and I had a right to hope so . "
194026	194109	193832	193832	his	908	" Concerning of yourself alone is not what we must think of . You might do this , or you might do that , according to what you was told , or , even more , according to what was denied you . For poor honest people , like Firm and me , to deal with such a case is out of knowledge . For us it is go by the will of the Lord , and dead agin your own desires . "
194110	194117	194118	194118	I	0	" But , dear Uncle Sam , "
194132	194193	194118	194118	I	0	" you rebuked me as sharply as lies in your nature for daring to talk about fate just now ; but to what else comes your own conduct , if you are bound to go against your own desire ? If you have such a lot of freewill , why must you do what you do not like to do ? "
194194	194226	193832	193832	his	908	" Well , well , perhaps I was talking rather large . The will of the world is upon us as well . And we must have respect for its settlements . "
194227	194232	194233	194233	I	0	" Now let me , "
194248	194295	194233	194233	I	0	" I have seen so much harm from misunderstandings , and they are so simple when it is too late let me ask you one or two questions , Uncle Sam . You always answer every body . And to you a crooked answer is impossible . "
194296	194301	194302	194303	the Sawyer	834	" Business is business , "
194306	194314	194302	194303	the Sawyer	834	" My dear , I contract accordingly . "
194315	194355	194233	194233	I	0	" Very well . Then , in the first place , what do you wish to have done with me ? Putting aside all the gossip , I mean , of people who have never even heard of me . "
194356	194377	194233	194233	I	0	" Why , to take you back to Saw - mill with us , where you always was so natural . "
194378	194390	194302	194303	the Sawyer	834	" In the next place , what does your grandson wish ? "
194391	194420	194233	194233	I	0	" To take you back to Saw - mill with him , and keep you there till death do you part , as chanceth to all mortal pairs . "
194421	194444	194233	194233	I	0	" And now , Uncle Sam , what do I wish ? You say we all have so much free - will . "
194445	194482	194302	194303	the Sawyer	834	" It is natural that you should wish , my dear , to go and be a great lady , and marry a nobleman of your own rank , and have a lot of little noblemen . "
194483	194502	194503	194504	The Sawyer	834	" Then I fly against nature ; and the fault is yours for filling me so with machinery . "
195038	195051	195052	195052	he	179	" Think you got ahead of me ? No , not you , "
195084	195114	195063	195063	his	179	" No , no , missy ; you wait a bit . Uncle Sam was not hatched yesterday , and it takes fifty young ladies to go round him . "
195115	195129	195063	195063	his	179	" Is that from your size , Uncle Sam , or your depth ? "
195130	195220	195063	195063	his	179	" Well , a mixture of both , I do believe . Now the last thing you ever would think of , if you lived to be older than Washington 's nurse , is the very thing I mean to put to you . Only you must please to take it well , according to my meaning . You see our Firm going to a shadow , do n't you ? Very well ; the fault of that is all yourn . Why not up and speak to him ? "
195221	195261	195063	195063	his	179	" I speak to him every day , Uncle Sam , and I spare no efforts to fatten him . I am sure I never dreamed of becoming such a cook . But soon he will have Suan Isco . "
195262	195317	195063	195063	his	179	" Old Injun be darned ! It 's not the stomach , it 's the heart as wants nourishment with yon poor lad . He looketh that pitiful at you sometimes , my faith , I can hardly tell whether to laugh at his newings or cry at the lean face that does it . "
195318	195349	195063	195063	his	179	" You are not talking like yourself , Uncle Sam . And he never does any thing of the kind . I am sure there is nothing to laugh at . "
195350	195377	195063	195063	his	179	" No , no ; to be sure not . I made a mistake . Heroic is the word , of course every thing is heroic . "
195378	195383	195384	195384	I	0	" It is heroic , "
195394	195428	195384	195384	I	0	" If you can not see it , I am sorry for you . I like large things ; and I know of nothing larger than the way poor Firm is going on . "
195429	195437	195438	195439	Colonel Gundry	179	" You to stand up for him ! "
195451	195492	195444	195444	he	179	" You to talk large of him , my Lady Castlewood , while you are doing of his heart into small wittles ! Well , I did believe , if no one else , that you were a straightforward one . "
195493	195504	195384	195384	I	0	" And what am I doing that is crooked now ? "
195505	195528	195578	195578	he	179	" Well , not to say crooked , Miss ' Rema ; no , no . Only onconsistent , when squared up . "
195529	195554	195555	195555	He	179	" Uncle Sam , you 're a puzzle to me to - day . What is inconsistent ? What is there to square up ? "
195587	195595	195578	195578	he	179	" Soup 's a - bilin now . "
195596	195624	195384	195384	I	0	" Let it boil over , then . You must say what you mean . Oh , Uncle Sam , I only want to do the right ! "
195625	195688	195578	195578	he	179	" I dessay . I dessay . But have you got the pluck , miss ? Our little missy would ' a done more than that . But come to be great lady why , they take another tune . With much mind , of course it might be otherwise . But none of 'em have any much of that to spare . "
195689	195697	195698	195698	I	0	" Your view is a narrow one , "
195708	195736	195698	195698	I	0	" You judge by your own experience only ; and to do that shows a sad want of breadth , as the ladies in England express it . "
195764	195766	195737	195738	The Sawyer	168	" female "
195784	195787	195788	195788	I	0	" Yes , "
195795	195827	195828	195828	He	179	" let us try to look largely at all things , Uncle Sam . And supposing me capable of that , what is the proper and the lofty course to take ? "
195846	195851	195837	195837	his	179	" Pop the question . "
196670	196677	196678	196678	I	0	" How grand these mountains are ! "
196681	196712	196678	196678	I	0	" It must do you good to see them again . Even to me it is such a delight . And what must it be to you , a native ? "
196713	196734	196751	196751	his	206	" Yes , I shall wander from them no more . How I wish that I had never done so ? "
196735	196743	196744	196744	I	0	" Have men less courage than women ? "
196756	196817	196744	196744	I	0	" I owe you the debt of life ; and this is the place to think and speak of it . I used to talk freely of that , you know . You used to like to hear me speak ; but now you are tired of that , and tired of all the world as well , I fear . "
196818	196902	196751	196751	his	206	" No , I am tired of nothing , except my own vile degradation . I am tired of my want of spirit , that I can not cast my load . I am tired of my lack of reason , which should always guide a man . What is the use of mind or intellect , reasoning power , or whatever it is called , if the whole of them can not enable a man to hold out against a stupid heart ? "
196903	196911	196912	196912	I	0	" I think you should be proud , "
196929	196971	196912	196912	I	0	" at having a nature so sensitive . Your evil chance might have been any body 's , and must of course have been somebody 's . But nobody else would have taken it so so delightfully as you have done ! "
196972	196992	196751	196751	his	206	" Delightfully ! Is that the word you use ? May I ask who gets any delight from it ? "
196993	197003	197004	197004	I	0	" Why , all who hate the Southern cause , "
197024	197031	197004	197004	I	0	" Surely that needs no explanation . "
197032	197087	196751	196751	his	206	" They are delighted , are they ? Yes , I can very well believe it . Narrow - minded bigots ! Yes , they are sure to be delighted . They call it a just visitation , of course , a righteous retribution . And they hope I may never get over it . "
197088	197098	197099	197099	I	0	" I pray you to take it more gently , "
197102	197130	197099	197099	I	0	" they are very good men , and wish you no harm . But they must have their own opinions ; and naturally they think them just . "
197131	197261	196751	196751	his	206	" Then all their opinions are just wrong . They hope to see me go down , to my grave . They shall not have that pleasure . I will outlive every old John Brown of them . I did not care two cents to live just now . Henceforth I will make a point of it . If I can not fight for true freedom any more , having ruined it perhaps already , the least I can do is to give no more triumph to its bitter enemies . I will eat and drink , and begin this very night . I suppose you are one of them , as you put their arguments so neatly . I suppose you consider me a vile slave - driver ? "
197262	197268	197269	197269	I	0	" You are very ill , "
197285	197312	197269	197269	I	0	" you are very ill , and very weak . How could you drive the very best slave now even such a marvel as Uncle Tom ? "
197386	197399	197400	197400	he	179	" I wish you were at all as you used to be , "
197414	197423	197400	197400	he	179	" instead of being such a grand lady . "
197424	197436	197437	197437	I	0	" And I wish you were a little more like yourself , "
197443	197455	197437	197437	I	0	" you used to think always there was nobody like me . "
197456	197474	197400	197400	he	179	" Suppose that I am of the same opinion still ? Tenfold , fiftyfold , a millionfold ? "
197475	197498	197400	197400	he	179	" To suppose a thing of that sort is a little too absurd , when you have shown no sign of it . "
197499	197521	197400	197400	he	179	" For your own dear sake I have shown no sign . The reason of that is too clear to explain . "
197522	197537	197400	197400	he	179	" Then how stupid I must be not to see an atom of it ! "
197538	197581	197582	197582	He	179	" Why , who would have any thing to say to me a broken - down man , a fellow marked out for curses , one who hates even the sight of himself ? The lowest of the low would shun me . "
197768	197783	197755	197755	my	0	" I have done enough . The rest remains with you , Firm Gundry . "
