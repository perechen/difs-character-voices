20422	20559	20362	20362	She	687	" It 's very kind of you to say so , Sir ; and thank you . But cap and ribbons are the last things I can buy while I 'm in this place . Master 's master and missus too , here ; and drives us half wild with the fuss he makes about our caps and ribbons . He 's such an austerious man , that he will have our caps as he likes 'em . It 's bad enough when a missus meddles with a poor servant 's ribbons ; but to have master come down into the kitchen , and - Well , it 's no use telling you of it , Sir - and - and thank you , Sir , for what you 've given me , all the same !

20648	20681	20362	20362	She	687	" Yes . I want an opportunity of seeing Miss Margaret , and speaking to her in private - and not a word must be said to her about it , beforehand . "
20682	20696	20362	20362	She	687	" Oh Lord , Sir ! I could n't dare to do it ! "
20697	20724	20362	20362	She	687	" Come ! come ! Ca n't you guess why I want to see your young lady , and what I want to say to her ? "

20764	20787	20362	20362	She	687	" Very well ; but you can tell me at least , whether Miss Margaret ever goes out to take a walk ? "
20788	20799	20731	20731	her	687	" Oh , yes , Sir ; mostly every day . "
20800	20824	20362	20362	She	687	" Do you ever go out with her ? - just to take care of her when no one else can be spared ? "
20825	20838	20839	20839	She	687	" Do n't ask me - please , Sir , do n't ! "
20855	20885	20839	20839	She	687	" I do n't know you ; and Miss Margaret do n't know you , I 'm sure - I could n't , Sir , I really could n't ! "
20886	20928	20362	20362	She	687	" Take a good look at me ! Do you think I am likely to do you or your young lady any harm ? Am I too dangerous a man to be trusted ? Would you believe me on my promise ? "
20929	20952	20839	20839	She	687	" Yes , Sir , I 'm sure I would ! - being so kind and so civil to me , too ! "
20963	21058	20839	20839	She	687	" Then suppose I promised , in the first place , not to tell Miss Margaret that I had spoken to you about her at all . And suppose I promised , in the second place , that , if you told me when you and Miss Margaret go out together , I would only speak to her while she was in your sight , and would leave her the moment you wished me to go away . Do n't you think you could venture to help me , if I promised all that ? "
21059	21096	20839	20839	She	687	" Well , Sir , that would make a difference , to be sure . But then , it 's master I 'm so afraid of - could n't you speak to master first , Sir ? "
21097	21158	20839	20839	She	687	" Suppose you were in Miss Margaret 's place , would you like to be made love to , by your father 's authority , without your own wishes being consulted first ? would you like an offer of marriage , delivered like a message , by means of your father ? Come , tell me honestly , would you ? "

21241	21248	21249	21249	I	0	" That 's a good girl , "
21252	21273	21249	21249	I	0	" Now tell me , when does Miss Margaret go out to - day ; and who goes with her ? "
21274	21371	21204	21205	the girl	687	" Dear ! dear ! - it 's very wrong to say it ; but I must . She 'll go out with me to market , this morning , at eleven o'clock . She 's done it for the last week . Master do n't like it ; but Missus begged and prayed she might ; for Missus says she wo n't be fit to be married , if she knows nothing about housekeeping , and prices , and what 's good meat , and what is n't , and all that , you know . "
21372	21403	21249	21249	I	0	" Thank you a thousand times ! you have given me all the help I want . I 'll be here before eleven , waiting for you to come out . "
21404	21430	21204	21205	the girl	687	" Oh , please do n't , Sir - I wish I had n't told you - I ought n't , indeed I ought n't ! "
21431	21472	21249	21249	I	0	" No fear - you shall not lose by what you have told me - I promise all I said I would promise - good bye . And mind , not a word to Miss Margaret till I see her ! "

23866	23905	23849	23849	she	44	" Suppose this difference in rank , which you so cruelly insist on , did not exist , would you tell me not to hope , not to speak then , as coldly as you tell me now ? "
23925	23940	23950	23950	she	44	" Perhaps I have met you too late ? - perhaps you are already - "
23941	23948	23950	23950	she	44	" No ! oh , no ! "
24055	24063	24064	24064	I	0	" I will regain your better opinion , "

I will tell him all I have told you : I will tell him that you take a rank in beauty and goodness , which is the highest rank in the land - a far higher rank than mine - the only rank I desire . "
24180	24217	24168	24168	she	44	" Yes , I will do this ; I will never leave him till his answer is favourable - and then what would be yours ? One word , Margaret ; one word before I go - "

25582	25585	25538	25538	I	0	" Indeed ! "
25586	25701	25702	25702	He	1038	" I had the great pleasure , Sir , and profit , and - and , indeed , advantage - of being shown over your town residence last year , when the family were absent from London . A very beautiful house - I happen to be acquainted with the steward of your respected father : he was kind enough to allow me to walk through the rooms . A treat ; quite an intellectual treat - the furniture and hangings , and so on , arranged in such a chaste style - and the pictures , some of the finest pieces I ever saw - I was delighted - quite delighted , indeed . "
25725	25728	25702	25702	He	1038	" indeed . "
25796	25817	25818	25818	I	0	" I am delighted to hear that my family and my name are not unknown to you , Mr. Sherwin , "
25821	25844	25818	25818	I	0	" Under those circumstances , I shall feel less hesitation and difficulty in making you acquainted with the object of my visit . "
25845	25863	25931	25931	He	1038	" Just so . May I offer you anything ? - a glass of sherry , a - "
25864	25913	25818	25818	I	0	" Nothing , thank you . In the first place , Mr. Sherwin , I have reasons for wishing that this interview , whatever results it may lead to , may be considered strictly confidential . I am sure I can depend on your favouring me thus far ? "
25914	25930	25931	25931	He	1038	" Certainly - most certainly - the strictest secrecy of course - pray go on . "
25994	26056	25969	25969	he	1038	" I must also beg you to suspend your judgment until you have heard me to the end . You may be disposed to view - to view , I say , unfavourably at first - in short , Mr. Sherwin , without further preface , the object of my visit is connected with your daughter , with Miss Margaret Sherwin - "
26057	26076	26077	26077	He	1038	" My daughter ! Bless my soul - God bless my soul , I really ca n't imagine - "

26114	26132	26111	26111	I	0	" I accidentally met Miss Sherwin in an omnibus , accompanied by a lady older than herself - "

26152	26155	26147	26147	his	1038	" Mrs. Sherwin "
26178	26241	26147	26147	his	1038	" You will not probably be surprised to hear that I was struck by Miss Sherwin 's extreme beauty . The impression she made on me was something more , however , than a mere momentary feeling of admiration . To speak candidly , I felt - You have heard of such a thing as love at first sight , Mr. Sherwin ? "
26242	26248	26249	26249	He	1038	" In books , Sir . "
26275	26372	26249	26249	He	1038	" You would be inclined to laugh , I dare say , if I asked you to believe that there is such a thing as love at first sight , out of books . But , without dwelling further on that , it is my duty to confess to you , in all candour and honesty , that the impression Miss Sherwin produced on me was such as to make me desire the privilege of becoming acquainted with her . In plain words , I discovered her place of residence by following her to this house . "
26373	26386	26426	26426	he	1040	" Upon my soul this is the most extraordinary proceeding - - ! "
26387	26415	26249	26249	He	1038	" Pray hear me out , Mr. Sherwin : you will not condemn my conduct , I think , if you hear all I have to say . "
26529	26534	26536	26536	he	1040	" came to business , "
26542	26574	26575	26575	I	0	" I ought to have been plainer , Mr. Sherwin ; I ought perhaps to have told you at the outset , in so many words , that I came to - "
26581	26591	26575	26575	I	0	" to ask your daughter 's hand in marriage ; "
26616	26624	26629	26629	he	1040	" Well , Sir ! to what ? "
26649	26682	26629	26629	he	1040	" To ask your permission to pay my addresses to Miss Sherwin - or , to be plainer still , if you like , to ask of you her hand in marriage . "
26744	26749	26751	26752	Mr. Sherwin	42	" God bless me ! "
26784	26892	26772	26772	his	42	" God bless me , this is quite another story . Most gratifying , most astonishing - highly flattered I am sure ; highly indeed , my dear Sir ! Do n't suppose , for one moment , I ever doubted your honourable feeling . Young gentlemen in your station of life do sometimes fail in respect towards the wives and daughters of their - in short , of those who are not in their rank exactly . But that 's not the question - quite a misunderstanding - extremely stupid of me , to be sure . Pray let me offer you a glass of wine ! "
26893	26939	26955	26955	he	1043	" No wine , thank you , Mr. Sherwin . I must beg your attention a little longer , while I state to you , in confidence , how I am situated with regard to the proposals I have made . There are certain circumstances - "
26940	26945	26772	26772	his	42	" Yes - yes ? "
26967	27025	27026	27027	Mr. Sherwin	42	" I have acknowledged to you , Mr. Sherwin , that I have found means to speak to your daughter - to speak to her twice . I made my advances honourably . She received them with a modesty and a reluctance worthy of herself , worthy of any lady , the highest lady in the land . "
27048	27100	26955	26955	he	1043	" Now , although in so many words she directly discouraged me - it is her due that I should say this - still , I think I may without vanity venture to hope that she did so as a matter of duty , more than as a matter of inclination . "
27101	27122	27026	27027	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Ah - yes , yes ! I understand . She would do nothing without my authority , of course ? "
27123	27161	26955	26955	he	1043	" No doubt that was one reason why she received me as she did ; but she had another , which she communicated to me in the plainest terms - the difference in our rank of life . "
27162	27196	27026	27027	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Ah ! she said that , did she ? Exactly so - she saw a difficulty there ? Yes - yes ! high principles , Sir - high principles , thank God ! "
27197	27339	26955	26955	he	1043	" I need hardly tell you , Mr. Sherwin , how deeply I feel the delicate sense of honour which this objection shows on your daughter 's part . You will easily imagine that it is no objection to me , personally . The happiness of my whole life depends on Miss Sherwin ; I desire no higher honour , as I can conceive no greater happiness , than to be your daughter 's husband . I told her this : I also told her that I would explain myself on the subject to you . She made no objection ; and I am , therefore , I think , justified in considering that if you authorised the removal of scruples which do her honour at present , she would not feel the delicacy she does now at sanctioning my addresses . "
27340	27384	27026	27027	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Very proper - a very proper way of putting it . Practical , if I may be allowed to say so . And now , my dear Sir , the next point is : how about your own honoured family - eh ? "
27385	27428	26955	26955	he	1043	" It is exactly there that the difficulty lies . My father , on whom I am dependent as the younger son , has very strong prejudices - convictions I ought perhaps to call them - on the subject of social inequalities . "
27429	27518	27026	27027	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Quite so - most natural ; most becoming , indeed , on the part of your respected father . I honour his convictions , sir . Such estates , such houses , such a family as his - connected , I believe , with the nobility , especially on your late lamented mother 's side . My dear Sir , I emphatically repeat it , your father 's convictions do him honour ; I respect them as much as I respect him ; I do , indeed . "
27519	27564	26955	26955	he	1043	" I am glad you can view my father 's ideas on social subjects in so favourable a light , Mr. Sherwin . You will be less surprised to hear how they are likely to affect me in the step I am now taking . "
27565	27617	27026	27027	Mr. Sherwin	42	" He disapproves of it , of course - strongly , perhaps . Well , though my dear girl is worthy of any station ; and a man like me , devoted to mercantile interests , may hold his head up anywhere as one of the props of this commercial country , "
27672	27672	27654	27654	his	1045	"
27673	27683	27654	27654	his	1045	" He has expressed no disapproval , Mr. Sherwin . "
27684	27691	27654	27654	his	1045	" You do n't say so ! "
27692	27830	27654	27654	his	1045	" I have not given him an opportunity . My meeting with your daughter has been kept a profound secret from him , and from every member of my family ; and a secret it must remain . I speak from my intimate knowledge of my father , when I say that I hardly know of any means that he would not be capable of employing to frustrate the purpose of this visit , if I had mentioned it to him . He has been the kindest and best of fathers to me ; but I firmly believe , that if I waited for his consent , no entreaties of mine , or of any one belonging to me , would induce him to give his sanction to the marriage I have come to you to propose . "
27831	27867	27654	27654	his	1045	" Bless my soul ! this is carrying things rather far , though - dependent as you are on him , and all that . Why , what on earth can we do - eh ? "
27868	27880	27654	27654	his	1045	" We must keep both the courtship and the marriage secret . "
27881	27896	27654	27654	his	1045	" Secret ! Good gracious , I do n't at all see my way - "
27897	27924	27654	27654	his	1045	" Yes , secret - a profound secret among ourselves , until I can divulge my marriage to my father , with the best chance of - "
27925	27959	27654	27654	his	1045	" But I tell you , Sir , I ca n't see my way through it at all . Chance ! what chance would there be , after what you have told me ? "
27960	28194	27654	27654	his	1045	" There might be many chances . For instance , when the marriage was solemnised , I might introduce your daughter to my father 's notice - without disclosing who she was - and leave her , gradually and unsuspectedly , to win his affection and respect as with her beauty , elegance , and amiability , she could not fail to do , while I waited until the occasion was ripe for confessing everything . Then if I said to him , ' This young lady , who has so interested and delighted you , is my wife ; ' do you think , with that powerful argument in my favour , he could fail to give us his pardon ? If , on the other hand , I could only say , ' This young lady is about to become my wife , ' his prejudices would assuredly induce him to recall his most favourable impressions , and refuse his consent . In short , Mr. Sherwin , before marriage , it would be impossible to move him - after marriage , when opposition could no longer be of any avail , it would be quite a different thing : we might be sure of producing , sooner or later , the most favourable results . This is why it would be absolutely necessary to keep our union secret at first . "
28237	28252	28254	28255	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Yes , yes ; I see - oh , yes , I see ! "
28273	28362	28263	28263	his	42	" but this is a ticklish business , you know - a very queer and ticklish business indeed . To have a gentleman of your birth and breeding for a son - in - law , is of course - but then there is the money question . Suppose you failed with your father after all - my money is out in my speculations - I can do nothing . Upon my word , you have placed me in a position that I never was placed in before . "
28363	28408	28263	28263	his	42	" I have influential friends , Mr. Sherwin , in many directions - there are appointments , good appointments , which would be open to me , if I pushed my interests . I might provide in this way against the chance of failure . "
28409	28425	28263	28263	his	42	" Ah ! - well - yes . There 's something in that , certainly . "
28426	28533	28263	28263	his	42	" I can only assure you that my attachment to Miss Sherwin is not of a nature to be overcome by any pecuniary considerations . I speak in all our interests , when I say that a private marriage gives us a chance for the future , as opportunities arise of gradually disclosing it . My offer to you may be made under some disadvantages and difficulties , perhaps ; for , with the exception of a very small independence , left me by my mother , I have no certain prospects . But I really think my proposals have some compensating advantages to recommend them - "
28534	28647	28263	28263	his	42	" Certainly ! most decidedly so ! I am not insensible , my dear Sir , to the great advantage , and honour , and so forth . But there is something so unusual about the whole affair . What would be my feelings , if your father should not come round , and my dear girl was disowned by the family ? Well , well ! that could hardly happen , I think , with her accomplishments and education , and manners too , so distinguished - though perhaps I ought not to say so . Her schooling alone was a hundred a - year , Sir , without including extras - "
28648	28656	28263	28263	his	42	" I am sure , Mr. Sherwin - "
28657	28788	28263	28263	his	42	" - A school , Sir , where it was a rule to take in no thing lower than the daughter of a professional man - they only waived the rule in my case - the most genteel school , perhaps , in all London ! A drawing - room - deportment day once every week - the girls taught how to enter a room and leave a room with dignity and ease - a model of a carriage door and steps , in the back drawing - room , to practise the girls with the footman of the establishment in attendance in getting into a carriage and getting out again , in a lady - like manner ! No duchess has had a better education than my Margaret ! - "
28789	28799	28263	28263	his	42	" Permit me to assure you , Mr. Sherwin - "
28800	28852	28263	28263	his	42	" And then , her knowledge of languages - her French , and Italian , and German , not discontinued in holidays , or after she left school she has only just left it ; but all kept up and improved every evening , by the kind attention of Mr. Mannion - "
28853	28862	28263	28263	his	42	" May I ask who Mr. Mannion is ? "
28897	28924	28882	28882	He	1046	" Mr. Mannion is my confidential clerk , Sir - a most superior person , most highly talented , and well read , and all that . "
28925	28932	28882	28882	He	1046	" Is he a young man ? "
28933	28995	28882	28882	He	1046	" Young ! Oh , dear no ! Mr. Mannion is forty , or a year or two more , if he 's a day - an admirable man of business , as well as a great scholar . He 's at Lyons now , buying silks for me . When he comes back I shall be delighted to introduce - - "
28996	29016	28882	28882	He	1046	" I beg your pardon , but I think we are wandering away from the point , a little . "
29017	29091	28882	28882	He	1046	" I beg yours - so we are . Well , my dear Sir , I must be allowed a day or two - say two days - to ascertain what my daughter 's feelings are , and to consider your proposals , which have taken me very much by surprise , as you may in fact see . But I assure you I am most flattered , most honoured , most anxious - "
29093	29119	28882	28882	He	1046	" I hope you will consider my anxieties , Mr. Sherwin , and let me know the result of your deliberations as soon as possible . "
29120	29155	28882	28882	He	1046	" Without fail , depend upon it . Let me see : shall we say the second day from this , at the same time , if you can favour me with a visit ? "
29156	29159	28882	28882	He	1046	" Certainly . "
29160	29180	28882	28882	He	1046	" And between that time and this , you will engage not to hold any communication with my daughter ? "
29181	29199	28882	28882	He	1046	" I promise not , Mr. Sherwin - because I believe that your answer will be favourable . "
29200	29262	28882	28882	He	1046	" Ah , well - well ! lovers , they say , should never despair . A little consideration , and a little talk with my dear girl - really now , wo n't you change your mind and have a glass of sherry ? No again ? Very well , then , the day after tomorrow , at five o'clock . "
30397	30413	30415	30416	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Most happy to see you again - most happy indeed , my dear Sir , "
30426	30437	30415	30416	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Allow me to introduce my better half , Mrs. S. "
30778	30789	30791	30792	Mrs. Sherwin	43	" We have had very beautiful weather lately , Sir , "
30825	30833	30835	30837	the poor woman	1098	" Very beautiful weather to be sure , "
30866	30903	30928	30929	Mrs. Sherwin	43	" Delightful weather , Mrs. Sherwin . I have been enjoying it for the last two days in the country - in a part of Surrey the neighbourhood of Ewell that I had not seen before . "
30939	30978	31000	31000	she	43	" As the lady of the house , Mrs. S. , it strikes me that you might offer a visitor , like this gentleman , some cake and wine , without making any particular hole in your manners ! "
30979	30997	31000	31000	she	43	" Oh dear me ! I beg your pardon ! I 'm very sorry , I 'm sure "
31062	31074	31045	31046	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Your good health , Sir , your very good health ; "
31114	31124	31125	31125	I	0	" You are taking nothing yourself , Mrs. Sherwin , "
31128	31134	31136	31137	her husband	480	" Mrs. Sherwin , Sir , "
31139	31231	31136	31137	her husband	480	" never drinks wine , and ca n't digest cake . A bad stomach - a very bad stomach . Have another glass yourself . Wo n't you , indeed ? This sherry stands me in six shillings a bottle - ought to be first - rate wine at that price : and so it is . Well , if you wo n't have any more , we will proceed to business . Ha ! ha ! business as I call it ; pleasure I hope it will be to you . "
31250	31256	31257	31257	he	42	" There you are again ! "
31265	31297	31257	31257	he	42	" Coughing again ! Six months of the doctor - a six months ' bill to come out of my pocket - and no good done - no good , Mrs. S. "
31298	31315	31389	31390	Mrs. Sherwin	43	" Oh , I am much better , thank you - it was only a little - "
31316	31387	31257	31257	he	42	" Well , Sir , the evening after you left me , I had what you may call an explanation with my dear girl . She was naturally a little confused and - and embarrassed , indeed . A very serious thing of course , to decide at her age , and at so short a notice , on a point involving the happiness of her whole life to come . "
31437	31455	31456	31456	he	480	" Good God , Mrs. S. ! what 's the use of going on in that way ? "
31461	31533	31456	31456	he	480	" What is there to cry about ? Margaret is n't ill , and is n't unhappy - what on earth 's the matter now ? Upon my soul this is a most annoying circumstance : and before a visitor too ! You had better leave me to discuss the matter alone - you always were in the way of business , and it 's my opinion you always will be . "
31631	31641	31642	31642	I	0	" I hope Mrs. Sherwin has not hurt herself ? "
31645	31696	31642	31642	I	0	" Oh dear no ! not worth a moment 's thought - awkwardness and nervousness , nothing else - she always was nervous - the doctors all humbugs can do nothing with her - it 's very sad , very sad indeed ; but there 's no help for it . "
31728	31735	31736	31736	he	42	" Well , my dear Sir , "
31739	31997	31736	31736	he	42	" to go back to where I was interrupted by Mrs. S. Let me see : I was saying that my dear girl was a little confused , and so forth . As a matter of course , I put before her all the advantages which such a connection as yours promised - and at the same time , mentioned some of the little embarrassing circumstances - the private marriage , you know , and all that - besides telling her of certain restrictions in reference to the marriage , if it came off , which I should feel it my duty as a father to impose ; and which I shall proceed , in short , to explain to you . As a man of the world , my dear Sir , you know as well as I do , that young ladies do n't give very straightforward answers on the subject of their prepossessions in favour of young gentlemen . But I got enough out of her to show me that you had made pretty good use of your time - no occasion to despond , you know - I leave you to make her speak plain ; it 's more in your line than mine , more a good deal . And now let us come to the business part of the transaction . All I have to say is this : - if you agree to my proposals , then I agree to yours . I think that 's fair enough - Eh ? "
31998	32005	31725	31725	my	0	" Quite fair , Mr. Sherwin . "
32006	32034	31736	31736	he	42	" Just so . Now , in the first place , my daughter is too young to be married yet . She was only seventeen last birthday . "
32035	32051	31725	31725	my	0	" You astonish me ! I should have imagined her three years older at least . "
32052	32198	31736	31736	he	42	" Everybody thinks her older than she is - everybody , my dear Sir - and she certainly looks it . She 's more formed , more developed I may say , than most girls at her age . However , that 's not the point . The plain fact is , she 's too young to be married now - too young in a moral point of view ; too young in an educational point of view ; too young altogether . Well : the upshot of this is , that I could not give my consent to Margaret 's marrying , until another year is out - say a year from this time . One year 's courtship for the finishing off of her education , and the formation of her constitution - you understand me , for the formation of her constitution . "
32315	32322	32323	32323	I	0	" It will be some trial , "
32326	32351	32323	32323	I	0	" to my patience , though none to my constancy , none to the strength of my affection - I will wait the year . "
32352	32356	32358	32359	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Exactly so , "
32400	32400	32395	32395	I	0	"
32430	32453	32425	32425	he	42	" Pray explain yourself , Mr. Sherwin . Your silence gives me some uneasiness at this particular moment , I assure you . "
32454	32486	32406	32406	his	42	" Quite so - I understand . Now , you must promise me not to be huffed - offended , I should say - at what I am going to propose . "
32487	32491	32425	32425	he	42	" Certainly not . "
32492	32556	32406	32406	his	42	" Well , then , it may seem odd ; but under all the circumstances - that is to say , as far as the case concerns you personally - I want you and my dear girl to be married at once , and yet not to be married exactly , for another year . I do n't know whether you understand me ? "
32557	32565	32425	32425	he	42	" I must confess I do not . "
32618	32721	32604	32604	his	1119	" Well , to be still plainer , this is how the matter stands : If you were a party in our rank of life , coming to court Margaret with your father 's full approval and permission when once you had consented to the year 's engagement , everything would be done and settled ; the bargain would have been struck on both sides ; and there would be an end of it . But , situated as you are , I ca n't stop here safely - I mean , I ca n't end the agreement exactly in this way . "
32744	32760	32761	32761	he	1119	" You will see what I am driving at , my dear Sir , directly , "
32764	32898	32761	32761	he	1119	" Suppose now , you came courting my daughter for a year , as we settled ; and suppose your father found it out - we should keep it a profound secret of course : but still , secrets are sometimes found out , nobody knows how . Suppose , I say , your father got scent of the thing , and the match was broken off ; where do you think Margaret 's reputation would be ? If it happened with somebody in her own station , we might explain it all , and be believed : but happening with somebody in yours , what would the world say ? Would the world believe you had ever intended to marry her ? That 's the point - that 's the point precisely . "
32899	32927	32761	32761	he	1119	" But the case could not happen - I am astonished you can imagine it possible . I have told you already , I am of age . "
32928	33114	32761	32761	he	1119	" Properly urged - very properly , indeed . But you also told me , if you remember , when I first had the pleasure of seeing you , that your father , if he knew of this match , would stick at nothing to oppose it - at nothing - I recollect you said so . Now , knowing this , my dear Sir - though I have the most perfect confidence in your honour , and your resolution to fulfil your engagement - I ca n't have confidence in your being prepared beforehand to oppose all your father might do if he found us out ; because you ca n't tell yourself what he might be up to , or what influence he might set to work over you . This sort of mess is not very probable , you will say ; but if it 's at all possible - and there 's a year for it to be possible in - by George , Sir , I must guard against accidents , for my daughter 's sake - I must indeed ! "
33115	33144	32761	32761	he	1119	" In Heaven 's name , Mr. Sherwin , pass over all these impossible difficulties of yours ! and let me hear what you have finally to propose . "
33145	33187	32761	32761	he	1119	" Gently , my dear Sir ! gently , gently , gently ! I propose to begin with : that you should marry my daughter - privately marry her - in a week 's time . Now , pray compose yourself ! "
33197	33303	33188	33188	I	0	" Take it easy ; pray take it easy ! Supposing , then , you marry her in this way , I make one stipulation . I require you to give me your word of honour to leave her at the church door ; and for the space of one year never to attempt to see her , except in the presence of a third party . At the end of that time , I will engage to give her to you , as your wife in fact , as well as in name . There ! what do you say to that - eh ? "
33324	33581	33582	33582	He	1121	" This plan of mine , you see , reconciles everything . If any accident does happen , and we are discovered , why your father can do nothing to stop the match , because the match will have been already made . And , at the same time , I secure a year 's delay , for the formation of her constitution , and the finishing of her accomplishments , and so forth . Besides , what an opportunity this gives of sailing as near the wind as you choose , in breaking the thing , bit by bit , to your father , without fear of consequences , in case he should run rough after all . Upon my honour , my dear Sir , I think I deserve some credit for hitting on this plan - it makes everything so right and straight , and suits of course the wishes of all parties ! I need hardly say that you shall have every facility for seeing Margaret , under the restrictions - under the restrictions , you understand . People may talk about your visits ; but having got the certificate , and knowing it 's all safe and settled , I sha n't care for that . Well , what do you say ? take time to think , if you wish it - only remember that I have the most perfect confidence in your honour , and that I act from a fatherly feeling for the interests of my dear girl ! "
33763	33777	33758	33758	I	0	" I accept your conditions - I accept them with all my heart . "
33815	33819	33824	33824	he	1121	" business - like "
33836	33914	33824	33824	he	1121	" Delighted - most delighted , my dear Sir , to find how soon we understand each other , and that we pull together so well . We must have another glass ; hang it , we really must ! a toast , you know ; a toast you ca n't help drinking - your wife ! Ha ! ha ! - I had you there ! - my dear , dear Margaret , God bless her ! "
33915	33925	33926	33926	I	0	" We may consider all difficulties finally settled then , "
33942	34036	33824	33824	he	1121	" Decidedly so . Done , and double done , I may say . There will be a little insurance on your life , that I shall ask you to effect for dear Margaret 's sake ; and perhaps , a memorandum of agreement , engaging to settle a certain proportion of any property you may become possessed of , on her and her children . You see I am looking forward to my grandfather days already ! But this can wait for a future occasion - say in a day or two . "
34037	34053	33824	33824	he	1121	" Then I presume there will be no objection to my seeing Miss Sherwin now ? "
34054	34075	34077	34077	he	42	" None whatever - -at once , if you like . This way , my dear Sir ; this way , "
34701	34808	34686	34686	he	42	" Come an hour earlier , to - morrow ; and we 'll go and get the licence together . No objection to that - eh ? And the marriage , shall we say this day week ? Just as you like , you know - do n't let me seem to dictate . Ah ! no objection to that , either , I see , and no objection on Margaret 's side , I 'll warrant ! With respect to consents , in the marrying part of the business , there 's complete mutuality - is n't there ? Good night : God bless you ! "
35019	35035	35036	35036	he	147	" You may well feel surprised , Basil , at this invasion of your territory , "
35045	35062	35036	35036	he	147	" you must , however , apply there , to the prime minister of the household , "
35067	35087	35036	35036	he	147	" for an explanation . I am only the instrument of a domestic conspiracy on your sister 's part . "
35118	35125	35126	35126	she	57	" We are discovered , papa , "
35134	35155	35126	35126	she	57	" and we must explain : but you know I always leave as many explanations as I can to you . "
35156	35160	35162	35163	my father	147	" Very well , "
35166	35311	35162	35163	my father	147	" my task in this instance will be an easy one . I was intercepted , Basil , on my way to my own room by your sister , and taken in here to advise about a new set of bookcases for you , when I ought to have been attending to my own money matters . Clara 's idea was to have had these new bookcases made in secret , and put up as a surprise , some day when you were not at home . However , as you have caught her in the act of measuring spaces , with all the skill of an experienced carpenter , and all the impetuosity of an arbitrary young lady who rules supreme over everybody , further concealment is out of the question . We must make a virtue of necessity , and confess everything . "
35404	35418	35420	35421	my father	147	" I made no objection , of course , to the bookcase plan , "
35423	35482	35420	35421	my father	147	" More room is really wanted for the volumes on volumes that you have collected about you ; but I certainly suggested a little delay in the execution of the project . The bookcases will , at all events , not be required here for five months to come . This day week we return to the country . "
35556	35592	35593	35593	I	0	" I am afraid , Sir , I shall not be able to go with you and Clara so soon as you propose . It was my wish to remain in London some time longer . "
35659	35666	35667	35667	he	147	" This seems an extraordinary resolution , "
35680	35714	35667	35667	he	147	" I thought your sudden absence for the last two days rather odd ; but this plan of remaining in London by yourself is really incomprehensible . What can you have to do ? "
35767	35770	35771	35771	he	147	" Stop , "
35799	35928	35771	35771	he	147	" Stop ! If you must make excuses , Basil , I must ask no questions . You have a secret which you wish to keep from me ; and I beg you will keep it . I have never been accustomed to treat my sons as I would not treat any other gentlemen with whom I may happen to be associated . If they have private affairs , I can not interfere with those affairs . My trust in their honour is my only guarantee against their deceiving me ; but in the intercourse of gentlemen that is guarantee enough . Remain here as long as you like : we shall be happy to see you in the country , when you are able to leave town . "
35934	35977	35929	35929	He	1156	" I suppose , my love , you want me no longer . While I settle my own matters of business , you can arrange about the bookcases with your brother . Whatever you wish , I shall be glad to do . "
36203	36324	36199	36199	she	57	" I have been very anxious about you , Basil ; and perhaps I have allowed that anxiety to appear more than I ought . Perhaps I have been accustomed to exact too much from you - you have been too ready to please me . But I have been used to it so long ; and I have nobody else that I can speak to as I can to you . Papa is very kind ; but he ca n't be what you are to me exactly ; and Ralph does not live with us now , and cared little about me , I am afraid , when he did . I have friends , but friends are not - "
36380	36590	36377	36377	she	1159	" It will not be very easy for me to give up our country rides and walks together , and the evening talk that we always had at dusk in the old library at the park . But I think I can resign all this , and go away alone with papa , for the first time , without making you melancholy by anything I say or do at parting , if you will only promise that when you are in any difficulty you will let me be of some use . I think I could always be of use , because I should always feel an interest in anything that concerned you . I do n't want to intrude on your secret ; but if that secret should ever bring you trouble or distress which I hope and pray it may not , I want you to have confidence in my being able to help you , in some way , through any mischances . Let me go into the country , Basil , knowing that you can still put trust in me , even though a time should come when you can put trust in no one else - let me know this : do let me ! "
36805	36834	36836	36836	Clara	57	" Do n't grieve about what papa has said ; you have made me feel happy about you , Basil ; I will make him feel happy too , "
37429	37523	37552	37552	My	0	" feeling ever having risen in my mind . But now , as I looked on the sky , and saw the black clouds that overspread the whole firmament , and the heavy rain that poured down from them , an irrepressible sinking of the heart came over me . For the last ten days the sun had shone almost uninterruptedly - with my marriage - day came the cloud , the mist and the rain . I tried to laugh myself out of the forebodings which this suggested , and tried in vain .
37858	37881	37856	37856	her	57	" Think of what you promised in your study , Basil , whenever you think of me : I will write often . "
39484	39493	39495	39496	the man	696	" Keep him well in hand , Sir , "
39498	39508	39495	39496	the man	696	" he 's not been out for three days . "
43060	43063	43058	43058	she	57	" your Grace "
43460	43467	43468	43468	he	480	" News , my dear sir ! "
43471	43487	43468	43468	he	480	" Mr. Mannion has come back - at least two days before I expected him ! "
43554	43558	43547	43547	I	0	" confidential clerk ; "
43714	43737	43699	43699	he	42	" quite like one of the family , and well enough read to be sure to please a great reader like me . "
45246	45359	45360	45360	He	51	" I hope my arrival has not interrupted any occupation to - night , Sir . Mr. Sherwin , aware of the interest I must feel in whatever concerns the family of an employer whom I have served for years , has informed me in confidence - a confidence which I know how to respect and preserve - of your marriage with his daughter , and of the peculiar circumstances under which the marriage has been contracted . I may at least venture to congratulate the young lady on a change of life which must procure her happiness , having begun already by procuring the increase of her mental resources and pleasures . "
45372	45379	45380	45380	I	0	" I believe , Mr. Mannion , "
45383	45405	45380	45380	I	0	" that you have been of great assistance in laying a foundation for the studies to which I presume you refer . "
45406	45430	45431	45431	He	51	" I endeavoured to make myself useful in that way , Sir , as in all others , when my employer desired it . "
45780	45783	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Aha ! "
45794	45827	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" I knew Mannion would please you . I told you so , my dear Sir , if you remember , before he came . Curious looking person - is n't he ? "
45828	45899	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" So curious , that I may safely say I never saw a face in the slightest degree resembling his in my life . Your clerk , Mr. Sherwin , is a complete walking mystery that I want to solve . Margaret can not give me much help , I am afraid . When you came in , I was about to apply to Mrs. Sherwin for a little assistance . "
45900	45955	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Do n't do any such thing ! You 'll be quite in the wrong box there . Mrs. S. is as sulky as a bear , whenever Mannion and she are in company together . Considering her behaviour to him , I wonder he can be so civil to her as he is . "
45956	45969	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" What can you tell me about him yourself , Mr. Sherwin ? "
45970	46339	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" I can tell you there 's not a house of business in London has such a managing man as he is : he 's my factotum - my right hand , in short ; and my left too , for the matter of that . He understands my ways of doing business ; and , in fact , carries things out in first - rate style . Why , he 'd be worth his weight in gold , only for the knack he has of keeping the young men in the shop in order . Poor devils ! they do n't know how he does it ; but there 's a particular look of Mr. Mannion 's that 's as bad as transportation and hanging to them , whenever they see it . I 'll pledge you my word of honour he 's never had a day 's illness , or made a single mistake , since he 's been with me . He 's a quiet , steady - going , regular dragon at his work - he is ! And then , so obliging in other things . I 've only got to say to him : ' Here 's Margaret at home for the holidays ; ' or , ' Here 's Margaret a little out of sorts , and going to be nursed at home for the half - year - what 's to be done about keeping up her lessons ? I ca n't pay for a governess bad lot , governesses ! and school too . ' - I 've only got to say that ; and up gets Mannion from his books and his fireside at home , in the evening - which begins to be something , you know , to a man of his time of life - and turns tutor for me , gratis ; and a first - rate tutor , too ! That 's what I call having a treasure ! And yet , though he 's been with us for years , Mrs. S. there wo n't take to him ! - I defy her or anybody else to say why , or wherefore ! "
46340	46354	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Do you know how he was employed before he came to you ? "
46355	46689	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Ah ! now you 've hit it - that 's where you 're right in saying he 's a mystery . What he did before I knew him , is more than I can tell - a good deal more . He came to me with a capital recommendation and security , from a gentleman whom I knew to be of the highest respectability . I had a vacancy in the back office , and tried him , and found out what he was worth , in no time - I flatter myself I 've a knack at that with everybody . Well : before I got used to his curious - looking face , and his quiet ways , I wanted badly enough to know something about him , and who his connections were . First , I asked his friend who had recommended him - the friend was n't at liberty to answer for anything but his perfect trustworthiness . Then I asked Mannion himself point - blank about it , one day . He just told me that he had reasons for keeping his family affairs to himself - nothing more - but you know the way he has with him ; and , damn it , he put the stopper on me , from that time to this . I was n't going to risk losing the best clerk that ever man had , by worrying him about his secrets . They did n't interfere with business , and did n't interfere with me ; so I put my curiosity in my pocket . I know nothing about him , but that he 's my right - hand man , and the honestest fellow that ever stood in shoes . He may be the Great Mogul himself , in disguise , for anything I care ! In short , you may be able to find out all about him , my dear Sir ; but I ca n't . "
46690	46709	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" There does not seem much chance for me , Mr. Sherwin , after what you have said . "
46710	46854	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Well : I 'm not so sure of that - plenty of chances here , you know . You 'll see him often enough : he lives near , and drops in constantly of evenings . We settle business matters that wo n't come into business hours , in my private snuggery up stairs . In fact , he 's one of the family ; treat him as such , and get anything out of him you can - the more the better , as far as regards that . Ah ! Mrs. S. , you may stare , Ma'am ; but I say again , he 's one of the family ; may be , he 'll be my partner some of these days - you 'll have to get used to him then , whether you like it or not . "
46855	46866	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" One more question : is he married or single ? "
46867	46886	45786	45787	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Single , to be sure - a regular old bachelor , if ever there was one yet . "
47546	47581	47534	47534	she	44	" How could she suspect anything ? If she did suspect , it would be very wrong without good reason : but she ought not to suspect , and did not , of course . "
47844	47851	47853	47854	my companion	1451	" My house is close by , "
47864	47877	47853	47854	my companion	1451	" pray step in , Sir , until the storm is over . "
48280	48300	48301	48301	he	51	" I am afraid , Sir , I must confess myself an epicure and a prodigal in two things , "
48304	48356	48301	48301	he	51	" an epicure in tea , and a prodigal at least for a person in my situation in books . However , I receive a liberal salary , and can satisfy my tastes , such as they are , and save money too . What can I offer you , Sir ? "
48960	48967	48968	48968	he	51	" May I inquire , Sir , "
48971	49007	48968	48968	he	51	" whether I am right in apprehending that my conduct towards you , since we first met at Mr. Sherwin 's house , may have appeared strange , and even discourteous , in your eyes ? "
49008	49016	49017	49017	I	0	" In what respect , Mr. Mannion ? "
49030	49083	49086	49086	he	51	" I am perfectly sensible , Sir , that you have kindly set me the example , on many occasions , in trying to better our acquaintance . When such advances are made by one in your station to one in mine , they ought to be immediately and gratefully responded to . "
49123	49129	49130	49130	he	51	" I have only failed , "
49133	49199	49130	49130	he	51	" in the courtesy and gratitude you had a right to expect from me , because , knowing how you were situated with Mr. Sherwin 's daughter , I thought any intrusion on my part , while you were with the young lady , might not be so acceptable as you , Sir , in your kindness , were willing to lead me to believe . "
49200	49206	49207	49207	I	0	" Let me assure you , "
49223	49238	49207	49207	I	0	" let me assure you that I fully appreciate the consideration you have shown - "
49266	49276	49277	49277	he	51	" As my explanation has satisfied you , Sir , "
49302	49344	49277	49277	he	51	" may I feel justified in speaking on the subject of your present position in my employer 's house , with some freedom ? I mean , if I may say so without offence , with the freedom of a friend . "
49514	49521	49522	49522	he	51	" I may tell you then , "
49525	49662	49522	49522	he	51	" that while I am anxious to commit no untimely intrusion on your hours at North Villa , I am at the same time desirous of being something more than merely inoffensive towards you . I should wish to be positively useful , as far as I can . In my opinion Mr. Sherwin has held you to rather a hard engagement - he is trying your discretion a little too severely I think , at your years and in your situation . Feeling thus , it is my sincere wish to render what connection and influence I have with the family , useful in making the probation you have still to pass through , as easy as possible . I have more means of doing this , Sir , than you might at first imagine . "
49719	49725	49726	49726	he	1498	" I am perfectly sensible , "
49729	49821	49726	49726	he	1498	" that such a proposition as I now make to you , proceeding from one little better than a stranger , may cause surprise and even suspicion , at first . I can only explain it , by asking you to remember that I have known the young lady since childhood ; and that , having assisted in forming her mind and developing her character , I feel towards her almost as a second father , and am therefore naturally interested in the gentleman who has chosen her for a wife . "
49933	49936	49937	49937	he	1498	" Besides , "
49940	50111	49937	49937	he	1498	" a man must have some object in life for his sympathies to be employed on . I have neither wife nor child ; and no near relations to think of - I have nothing but my routine of business in the day , and my books here by my lonely fireside , at night . Our life is not much ; but it was made for a little more than this . My former pupil at North Villa is my pupil no longer . I ca n't help feeling that it would be an object in existence for me to occupy myself with her happiness and yours ; to have two young people , in the heyday of youth and first love , looking towards me occasionally for the promotion of some of their pleasures - no matter how trifling . All this will seem odd and incomprehensible to you . If you were of my age , Sir , and in my position , you would understand it . "
50253	50263	50264	50264	he	1499	" I have said perhaps more than I ought , "
50267	50308	50264	50264	he	1499	" If I have not succeeded in making you understand my explanation as I could wish , we will change the subject , and not return to it again , until you have known me for a much longer time . "
50309	50320	50321	50321	I	0	" On no account change the subject , Mr. Mannion , "
50339	50374	50321	50321	I	0	" I am deeply sensible of the kindness of your offer , and the interest you take in Margaret and me . We shall both , I am sure , accept your good offices - "
50468	50479	50480	50480	I	0	" If I have not answered you as I should , "
50483	50541	50480	50480	I	0	" you must attribute it partly to the storm , which I confess rather discomposes my ideas ; and partly to a little surprise - a very foolish surprise , I own - that you should still be able to feel so strong a sympathy with interests which are generally only considered of importance to the young . "
50542	50566	50567	50567	he	1499	" It is only in their sympathies , that men of my years can , and do , live their youth over again , "
50570	50626	50567	50567	he	1499	" You may be surprised to hear a tradesman 's clerk talk in this manner ; but I was not always what I am now . I have gathered knowledge , and suffered in the gathering . I have grown old before my time - my forty years are like the fifty of other men - "
50691	50696	50697	50697	he	1499	" What I was , "
50700	50932	50697	50697	he	1499	" matters little ; the question is what can I do for you ? Any aid I can give , may be poor enough ; but it may be of some use notwithstanding . For instance , the other day , if I mistake not , you were a little hurt at Mr. Sherwin 's taking his daughter to a party to which the family had been invited . This was very natural . You could not be there to watch over her in your real character , without disclosing a secret which must be kept safe ; and you could not know what young men she might meet , who would imagine her to be Miss Sherwin still , and would regulate their conduct accordingly . Now , I think I might be of use here . I have some influence - perhaps in strict truth I ought to say great influence - with my employer ; and , if you wished it , I would use that influence to back yours , in inducing him to forego , for the future , any intention of taking his daughter into society , except when you desire it . Again : I think I am not wrong in assuming that you infinitely prefer the company of Mrs. Sherwin to that of Mr. Sherwin , during your interviews with the young lady ? "
50955	50967	50968	50968	he	1501	" The preference is on many accounts a very natural one , "
50971	51170	50968	50968	he	1501	" but if you suffered it to appear to Mr. Sherwin , it might , for obvious reasons , produce a most unfavourable effect . I might interfere in the matter , however , without suspicion ; I should have many opportunities of keeping him away from the room , in the evening , which I could use if you wished it . And more than that , if you wanted longer and more frequent communication with North Villa than you now enjoy , I might be able to effect this also . I do not mention what I could do in these , and in other matters , in any disparagement , Sir , of the influence which you have with Mr. Sherwin , in your own right ; but because I know that in what concerns your intercourse with his daughter , my employer has asked , and will ask my advice , from the habit of doing so in other things . I have hitherto declined giving him this advice in your affairs ; but I will give it , and in your favour and the young lady 's , if you and she choose . "
51231	51237	51239	51239	he	1502	" I must again beg you "
51242	51329	51239	51239	he	1502	" to remember what I have already said , in your estimate of the motives of my offer . If I still appear to be interfering officiously in your affairs , you have only to think that I have presumed impertinently on the freedom you have allowed me , and to treat me no longer on the terms of to - night . I shall not complain of your conduct , and shall try hard not to consider you unjust to me , if you do . "
51441	51450	51451	51451	I	0	" I am quite incapable , Mr. Mannion , "
51454	51494	51451	51451	I	0	" of viewing your offer with any other than grateful feelings . You will find I shall prove this by employing your good offices for Margaret and myself in perfect faith , and sooner perhaps than you may imagine . "
52043	52050	52051	52051	I	0	" Let me assure you again , "
52054	52087	52051	52051	I	0	" that it will not be my fault if Margaret and I do not thankfully employ your good offices , as the good offices of a well - wisher and a friend . "
52529	52550	52521	52521	their	1519	" I tell you , mamma , I must and will have the dress , whether papa chooses or not . "
52570	52583	52591	52592	Mrs. Sherwin	43	" Pray - pray , my dear , do n't talk so , "
52594	52610	52591	52592	Mrs. Sherwin	43	" you know you have had more than your year 's allowance of dresses already . "
52611	52629	52508	52509	her mother	319	" I wo n't be allowanced . His sister is n't allowanced : why should I be ? "
52630	52641	52591	52592	Mrs. Sherwin	43	" My dear love , surely there is some difference - "
52642	52684	52508	52509	her mother	319	" I 'm sure there is n't , now I am his wife . I shall ride some day in my carriage , just as his sister does . He gives me my way in everything ; and so ought you . "
52685	52730	52591	52592	Mrs. Sherwin	43	" It is n't me , Margaret : if I could do anything , I 'm sure I would ; but I really could n't ask your papa for another new dress , after his having given you so many this year , already . "
52731	52871	52508	52509	her mother	319	" That 's the way it always is with you , mamma - you ca n't do this , and you ca n't do that - you are so excessively tiresome ! But I will have the dress , I 'm determined . He says his sister wears light blue crape of an evening ; and I 'll have light blue crape , too - see if I do n't ! I 'll get it somehow from the shop , myself . Papa never takes any notice , I 'm sure , what I have on ; and he need n't find out anything about what 's gone out of the shop , until they ' take stock , ' or whatever it is he calls it . And then , if he flies into one of his passions - "
52872	52909	52591	52592	Mrs. Sherwin	43	" My dear ! my dear ! you really ought not to talk so of your papa - it is very wrong , Margaret , indeed - what would Mr. Basil say if he heard you ? "
53280	53288	53290	53291	the housemaid	1525	" For God 's sake , Miss ! "
53301	53324	53290	53291	the housemaid	1525	" for God 's sake , put down the poker ! Missus will be here directly ; and it 's her cat ! "
53325	53358	53362	53362	Margaret	44	" I 'll kill the vile brute ! I 'll kill the hateful cat ! I do n't care whose it is ! - my poor dear , dear , dear bird ! "
53383	53387	53389	53390	the servant	315	" Poor thing , "
53394	53432	53389	53390	the servant	315	" I 'm sorry for it , and for you too , Miss ! But , oh ! do please to remember it was you left the cage on the table , in the cat 's reach - "
53433	53452	53389	53390	the servant	315	" Hold your tongue , you wretch ! How dare you hold me ? - let me go ! "
53453	53492	53389	53390	the servant	315	" Oh , you must n't - you must n't indeed ! It 's missus 's cat , recollect - poor missus 's , who 's always ill , and has n't got nothing else to amuse her . "
53493	53557	53389	53390	the servant	315	" I do n't care ! The cat has killed my bird , and the cat shall be killed for doing it ! - it shall ! - it shall ! ! - it shall ! ! ! I 'll call in the first boy from the street to catch it , and hang it ! Let me go ! I will go ! "
53558	53577	53389	53390	the servant	315	" I 'll let the cat go first , Miss , as sure as my name 's Susan ! "
55981	55988	55989	55989	she	57	" I have never asked you , "
55992	56196	55989	55989	she	57	" to come and see us for my sake ; for I would not interfere with any of your interests or any of your plans ; but I now ask you to come here for your own sake - just for one week , and no more , unless you like to remain longer . You remember papa telling you , in your room in London , that he believed you kept some secret from him . I am afraid this is preying on his mind : your long absence is making him uneasy about you . He does not say so ; but he never sends any message , when I write ; and if I speak about you , he always changes the subject directly . Pray come here , and show yourself for a few days - no questions will be asked , you may be sure . It will do so much good ; and will prevent - what I hope and pray may never happen - a serious estrangement between papa and you . Recollect , Basil , in a month or six weeks we shall come back to town ; and then the opportunity will be gone . "
56246	56265	56225	56225	Margaret	44	" it would be such a sight for her , to see a grand country house like ours ! "
57047	57050	57051	57051	she	57	" Basil ! "
57054	57087	57088	57088	she	57	" if that is all the secret you have been keeping from us , how glad I am ! When I see a new locket drop out of my brother 's waistcoat - "
57100	57142	57088	57088	she	57	" and when I find him colouring very deeply , and hiding it again in a great hurry , I should be no true woman if I did not make my own discoveries , and begin to talk about them directly . "
57187	57211	57175	57175	She	57	" Are you going to be married , Basil ? Shall I love my new sister almost as much as I love you ? "
57385	57495	57380	57380	I	0	" Will you not think the worse of me , Clara , if I leave you to draw your own conclusions from what you have seen ? only asking you to keep strict silence on the subject to every one . I ca n't speak yet , love , as I wish to speak : you will know why , some day , and say that my reserve was right . In the meantime , can you be satisfied with the assurance , that when the time comes for making my secret known , you shall be the first to know it - the first I put trust in ? "
57496	57506	57508	57508	Clara	57	" As you have not starved my curiosity altogether , "
57512	57546	57547	57547	she	57	" but have given it a little hope to feed on for the present , I think , woman though I am , I can promise all you wish . Seriously , Basil , "
57550	57594	57547	57547	she	57	" that telltale locket of yours has so pleasantly brightened some very gloomy thoughts of mine about you , that I can now live happily on expectation , without once mentioning your secret again , till you give me leave to do so . "
57693	57698	57699	57699	he	147	" I told you , "
57845	57845	57846	57846	He	0	"
59649	59683	59633	59633	she	44	" Watch over your wife - mind you watch over her , and keep all bad people from her ! I 've tried to do it - mind you do it , too ! "
60789	60794	60795	60795	he	1714	" My good Sir ! "
60804	61044	60795	60795	he	1714	" do , for once , allow me to know what 's best . You 'll have it all your way to - morrow - just let me have mine , for the last time , to - night . I 'm sure you 've been humoured often enough about keeping Margaret away from parties - and we should have humoured you this time , too ; but a second letter came from the old lady , saying she should be affronted if Margaret was n't one of her guests . I could n't go and talk her over , because of this infernal headache of mine - Hang it ! it 's your interest that Margaret should keep in with her aunt ; she 'll have all the old girl 's money , if she only plays her cards decently well . That 's why I sent her to the party - her going will be worth some thousands to both of you one of these days . She 'll be back by half - past twelve , or before . Mannion was asked ; and though he 's all out of sorts , he 's gone to take care of her , and bring her back . I 'll warrant she comes home in good time , when he 's with her . So you see there 's nothing to make a fuss about , after all . "
61116	61122	61124	61125	Mr. Sherwin	42	" I must say again , "
61140	61217	61132	61132	I	0	" there 's nothing that any reasonable being need make a fuss about . I 've been doing everything for Margaret 's interests and yours - and she 'll be back by twelve - and Mr. Mannion takes care of her - and I do n't know what you would have - and it 's devilish hard , so ill as I am too , to cut up rough with me like this - devilish hard ! "
61218	61266	61138	61138	him	42	" I am sorry for your illness , Mr. Sherwin ; and I do n't doubt your good intentions , or the advantage of Mr. Mannion 's protection for Margaret ; but I feel disappointed , nevertheless , that she should have gone out to - night . "
61267	61287	61132	61132	I	0	" I said she ought n't to go at all , whatever her aunt wrote - I said that . "
61350	61357	61359	61360	her husband	480	" Damn it , Mrs. S. ! "
61365	61435	61436	61436	he	480	" will you hold your tongue ? What the devil do you mean by giving your opinion , when nobody wants it ? Upon my soul I begin to think you 're getting a little cracked . You 've been meddling and bothering lately , so that I do n't know what the deuce has come to you ! I 'll tell you what it is , Mr. Basil , "
61445	61572	61436	61436	he	480	" you had better stop that fidgetty temper of yours , by going to the party yourself . The old lady told me she wanted gentlemen ; and would be glad to see any friends of mine I liked to send her . You have only to mention my name : Mannion will do the civil in the way of introduction . There ! there 's an envelope with the address to it - they wo n't know who you are , or what you are , at Margaret 's aunt 's - you 've got your black dress things on , all right and ready - for Heaven 's sake , go to the party yourself , and then I hope you 'll be satisfied !

63644	63678	63620	63620	He	1817	" I want you to take me where I can hear their voices , and I want nothing more . Here 's a sovereign for you , if you do what I ask . "

71559	71562	71554	71554	I	0	" MYSTERIOUS OCCURRENCE .
71563	71887	71554	71554	I	0	" About one o'clock this morning , a gentleman was discovered lying on his face in the middle of the road , in Westwood Square , by the policeman on duty . The unfortunate man was to all appearance dead . He had fallen on a part of the road which had been recently macadamised ; and his face , we are informed , is frightfully mutilated by contact with the granite . The policeman conveyed him to the neighbouring hospital , where it was discovered that he was still alive , and the promptest attentions were immediately paid him . We understand that the surgeon in attendance considers it absolutely impossible that he could have been injured as he was , except by having been violently thrown down on his face , either by a vehicle driven at a furious rate , or by a savage attack from some person or persons unknown . In the latter case , robbery could not have been the motive ; for the unfortunate man 's watch , purse , and ring were all found about him . No cards of address or letters of any kind were discovered in his pockets , and his linen and handkerchief were only marked with the letter M. He was dressed in evening costume - entirely in black . After what has been already said about the injuries to his face , any recognisable personal description of him is , for the present , unfortunately out of the question . We wait with much anxiety to gain some further insight into this mysterious affair , when the sufferer is restored to consciousness . The last particulars which our reporter was able to collect at the hospital were , that the surgeon expected to save his patient 's life , and the sight of one of his eyes . The sight of the other is understood to be entirely destroyed . "
71945	72396	72397	72397	I	0	" The mystery of the accident in Westwood Square thickens . The sufferer is restored to consciousness ; he is perfectly competent to hear and understand what is said to him , and is able to articulate , but not very plainly , and only for a moment or so , at a time . The authorities at the hospital anticipated , as we did , that , on the patient 's regaining his senses , some information of the manner in which the terrible accident from which he is suffering was caused , would be obtained from him . But , to the astonishment of every one , he positively refuses to answer any questions as to the circumstances under which his frightful injuries were inflicted . With the same unaccountable secrecy , he declines to tell his name , his place of abode , or the names of any friends to whom notice of his situation might be communicated . It is quite in vain to press him for any reason for this extraordinary course of conduct - he appears to be a man of very unusual firmness of character ; and his refusal to explain himself in any way , is evidently no mere caprice of the moment . All this leads to the conjecture that the injuries he has sustained were inflicted on him from some motive of private vengeance ; and that certain persons are concerned in this disgraceful affair , whom he is unwilling to expose to public odium , for some secret reason which it is impossible to guess at . We understand that he bears the severe pain consequent upon his situation , in such a manner as to astonish every person about him - no agony draws from him a word or a sigh . He displayed no emotion even when the surgeons informed him that the sight of one of his eyes was hopelessly destroyed ; and merely asked to be supplied with writing materials as soon as he could see to use them , when he was told that the sight of the other would be saved . He further added , we are informed , that he was in a position to reward the hospital authorities for any trouble he gave , by making a present to the funds of the charity , as soon as he should be discharged as cured . His coolness in the midst of sufferings which would deprive most other men of all power of thinking or speaking , is as remarkable as his unflinching secrecy - a secrecy which , for the present at least , we can not hope to penetrate . "
72634	72640	73742	73742	She	2028	" North Villa , Hollyoake Square .
72641	72644	72613	72614	Mr. Sherwin	42	" DEAR SIR ,
72645	72721	73742	73742	She	2028	" With agonised feelings which no one but a parent , and I will add , an affectionate parent , can possibly form an idea of , I address you on the subject of the act of atrocity committed by that perjured villain , Mannion . You will find that I and my innocent daughter have been , like you , victims of the most devilish deceit that ever was practised on respectable and unsuspecting people .
72722	73005	72613	72614	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Let me ask you , Sir , to imagine the state of my feelings on the night of that most unfortunate party , when I saw my beloved Margaret , instead of coming home quietly as usual , rush into the room in a state bordering on distraction , with a tale the most horrible that ever was addressed to a father 's ears . The double - faced villain I really ca n't mention his name again had , I blush to acknowledge , attempted to take advantage of her innocence and confidence - all our innocences and confidences , I may say - but my dear Margaret showed a virtuous courage beyond her years , the natural result of the pious principles and the moral bringing up which I have given her from her cradle . Need I say what was the upshot ? Virtue triumphed , as virtue always does , and the villain left her to herself . It was when she was approaching the door - step to fly to the bosom of her home that , I am given to understand , you , by a most remarkable accident , met her . As a man of the world , you will easily conceive what must have been the feelings of a young female , under such peculiar and shocking circumstances . Besides this , your manner , as I am informed , was so terrifying and extraordinary , and my poor Margaret felt so strongly that deceitful appearances might be against her , that she lost all heart , and fled at once , as I said before , to the bosom of her home .
73006	73082	73742	73742	She	2028	" She is still in a very nervous and unhappy state ; she fears that you may be too ready to believe appearances ; but I know better . Her explanation will be enough for you , as it was for me . We may have our little differences on minor topics , but we have both the same manly confidence , I am sure - you in your wife , and me in my daughter .
73083	73304	72613	72614	Mr. Sherwin	42	" I called at your worthy father 's mansion , to have a fuller explanation with you than I can give here , the morning after this to - all - parties - most - distressing occurrence happened : and was then informed of your serious illness , for which pray accept my best condolences . The next thing I thought of doing was to write to your respected father , requesting a private interview . But on maturer consideration , I thought it perhaps slightly injudicious to take such a step , while you , as the principal party concerned , were ill in bed , and not able to come forward and back me . I was anxious , you will observe , to act for your interests , as well as the interests of my darling girl - of course , knowing at the same time that I had the marriage certificate in my possession , if needed as a proof , and supposing I was driven to extremities and obliged to take my own course in the matter . But , as I said before , I have a fatherly and friendly confidence in your feeling as convinced of the spotless innocence of my child as I do . So will write no more on this head .
73305	73535	73742	73742	She	2028	" Having determined , as best under all circumstances , to wait till your illness was over , I have kept my dear Margaret in strict retirement at home which , as she is your wife , you will acknowledge I had no obligation to do , until you were well enough to come forward and do her justice before her family and yours . I have not omitted to make almost daily inquiries after you , up to the time of penning these lines , and shall continue so to do until your convalescence , which I sincerely hope may be speedily at hand ; I am unfortunately obliged to ask that our first interview , when you are able to see me and my daughter , may not take place at North Villa , but at some other place , any you like to fix on . The fact is , my wife , whose wretched health has been a trouble and annoyance to us for years past , has now , I grieve to say , under pressure of this sad misfortune , quite lost her reason . I am sorry to say that she would be capable of interrupting us here , in a most undesirable manner to all parties , and therefore request that our first happy meeting may not take place at my house .
73536	73570	72613	72614	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Trusting that this letter will quite remove all unpleasant feelings from your mind , and that I shall hear from you soon , on your much - to - be - desired recovery ,
73571	73577	73742	73742	She	2028	" I remain , dear Sir ,
73578	73584	72613	72614	Mr. Sherwin	42	" Your faithful , obedient servant ,
73585	73588	73742	73742	She	2028	" STEPHEN SHERWIN .
73589	73702	72613	72614	Mr. Sherwin	42	" P. S. - I have not been able to find out where that scoundrel Mannion , has betaken himself to ; but if you should know , or suspect , I wish to tell you , as a proof that my indignation at his villany is as great as yours , that I am ready and anxious to pursue him with the utmost rigour of the law , if law can only reach him - paying out of my own pocket all expenses of punishing him and breaking him for the rest of his life , if I go through every court in the country to do it ! - S. S. "
74379	74394	74432	74432	She	315	" Why , you have been walking till it is quite dark , Clara ! "
74395	74431	74432	74432	She	315	" We have only been in the garden of the Square - neither papa nor I noticed how late it was . We were talking on a subject of the deepest interest to us both . "
74473	74500	74470	74470	she	315	" Ca n't you imagine what the subject was ? It was you , Basil . Papa is coming here directly , to speak to you . "
74567	74627	74628	74628	She	315	" You know , Basil , that for a long time past , you have kept some secret from us ; and you promised that I should know it first ; but I - I have changed my mind ; I have no wish to know it , dear : I would rather we never said anything about it . "
74643	74777	74628	74628	She	315	" But I hope you will tell it all to papa : he is coming here to ask you - oh , Basil ! be candid with him , and tell him everything ; let us all be to one another what we were before this time last year ! You have nothing to fear , if you only speak openly ; for I have begged him to be gentle and forgiving with you , and you know he refuses me nothing . I only came here to prepare you ; to beg you to be candid and patient . Hush ! there is a step on the stairs . Speak out , Basil , for my sake - pray , pray , speak out , and then leave the rest to me . "
74842	74851	74852	74852	he	147	" I have come to speak to you , "
74855	74872	74852	74852	he	147	" on a subject about which I had much rather you had spoken to me first . "
74873	74889	74828	74828	he	147	" I think , Sir , I know to what subject you refer . I - "
74890	74905	74906	74906	he	147	" I must beg you will listen to me as patiently as you can , "
74909	74917	74906	74906	he	147	" I have not much to say . "
74998	75001	75003	75004	my father	147	" Basil , "
75010	75301	75003	75004	my father	147	" I hope and believe that I have little to reproach myself with in my conduct towards you . I think I am justified in saying , that very few fathers would have acted towards a son as I have acted for the last year or more . I may often have grieved over the secresy which has estranged you from us ; I may even have shown you by my manner that I resented it ; but I have never used my authority to force you into the explanation of your conduct , which you have been so uniformly unwilling to volunteer . I rested on that implicit faith in the honour and integrity of my son , which I will not yet believe to have been ill - placed , but which , I fear , has led me to neglect too long the duty of inquiry which I owed to your own well - being , and to my position towards you . I am now here to atone for this omission ; circumstances have left me no choice . It deeply concerns my interest as a father , and my honour as the head of our family , to know what heavy misfortune it was I can imagine it to be nothing else that stretched my son senseless in the open street , and afflicted him afterwards with an illness which threatened his reason and his life . You are now sufficiently recovered to reveal this ; and I only use my legitimate authority over my own children , when I tell you that I must now know all . If you persist in remaining silent , the relations between us must henceforth change for life . "
75302	75355	75524	75524	he	2059	" I am ready to make my confession , Sir . I only ask you to believe beforehand , that if I have sinned grievously against you , I have been already heavily punished for the sin . I am afraid it is impossible that your worst forebodings can have prepared you - "
75356	75382	75003	75004	my father	147	" The words you spoke in your delirium - words which I heard , but will not judge you by - justified the worst forebodings . "
75383	75415	75524	75524	he	2059	" My illness has spared me the hardest part of a hard trial , Sir , if it has prepared you for what I have to confess ; if you suspect - "
75416	75463	75003	75004	my father	147	" I do not suspect - I feel but too sure , that you , my second son , from whom I had expected far better things , have imitated in secret - I am afraid , outstripped - the worst vices of your elder brother . "
75464	75477	75524	75524	he	2059	" My brother ! - my brother 's faults mine ! Ralph ! "
75478	75516	75003	75004	my father	147	" Yes , Ralph . It is my last hope that you will now imitate Ralph 's candour . Take example from that best part of him , as you have already taken example from the worst . "
75683	75693	75694	75694	he	2059	" A person has been calling , named Sherwin , "
75697	75766	75694	75694	he	2059	" and inquiring about you every day . What intimate connection between you authorises this perfect stranger to me to come to the house as frequently as he does , and to make his inquiries with a familiarity of tone and manner which has struck every one of the servants who have , on different occasions , opened the door to him ? Who is this Mr. Sherwin ? "
75767	75787	75664	75664	his	2059	" It is not with him , Sir , that I can well begin . I must go back - "
75788	75839	75694	75694	he	2059	" You must go back farther , I am afraid , than you will be able to return . You must go back to the time when you had nothing to conceal from me , and when you could speak to me with the frankness and directness of a gentleman . "
75840	75874	75664	75664	his	2059	" Pray be patient with me , Sir ; give me a few minutes to collect myself . I have much need for a little self - possession before I tell you all . "
75875	75928	75694	75694	he	2059	" All ? your tones mean more than your words - they are candid , at least ! Have I feared the worst , and yet not feared as I ought ? Basil ! - do you hear me , Basil ? You are trembling very strangely ; you are growing pale ! "
75929	75980	75995	75995	his	2063	" I shall be better directly , Sir . I am afraid I am not quite so strong yet as I thought myself . Father ! I am heart - broken and spirit - broken : be patient and kind to me , or I can not speak to you . "
76050	76059	76060	76060	he	2063	" No more to - night , Basil , "
76069	76080	76060	76060	he	2063	" no more on this subject till to - morrow . "
76081	76097	76032	76032	He	2063	" I can speak now , Sir ; it is better to speak at once . "
76098	76188	76060	76060	he	2063	" No : you are too much agitated ; you are weaker than I thought . To - morrow , in the morning , when you are stronger after a night 's rest . No ! I will hear nothing more . Go to bed now ; I will tell your sister not to disturb you to - night . To - morrow , you shall speak to me ; and speak in your own way , without interruption . Good - night , Basil , good - night . "
76899	76927	76934	76935	the servant	315	" My master , Sir , desires me to say that , if you feel well enough , he wishes to see you in his own room . "
76993	77004	77005	77005	she	57	" Think of what I said last night , Basil , "
77008	77058	77005	77005	she	57	" and , if hard words are spoken to you , think of me . All that our mother would have done for you , if she had been still among us , I will do . Remember that , and keep heart and hope to the very last . "
77091	77120	77077	77078	the servant	315	" This was left for you , Sir , a little while ago . The messenger who brought it said he was not to wait for an answer . "
77227	77249	77211	77211	he	147	" Take any time you like , Basil , to compose and collect yourself . This morning my time is yours . "
78240	78251	78252	78252	he	147	" I have resolved to give you your own time , "
78255	78292	78293	78293	He	147	" and from that resolve I have no wish to depart - I only ask you to remember that every minute of delay adds to the suffering and suspense which I am enduring on your account . "
78313	78325	78293	78293	He	147	" In your place , Ralph would have spoken before this . "
78345	78367	78368	78368	I	0	" My brother 's faults towards you , and towards his family , are not such faults as mine , Sir , "
78371	78421	78368	78368	I	0	" I have not imitated his vices ; I have acted as he would not have acted . And yet , the result of my error will appear far more humiliating , and even disgraceful , in your eyes , than the results of any errors of Ralph 's . "
78427	78430	78423	78423	I	0	" disgraceful , "
78457	78467	78468	78468	he	2120	" What do you mean by ' disgraceful ? ' "
78472	78497	78468	78468	he	2120	" what do you mean by associating such a word as disgrace with your conduct - with the conduct of a son of mine ? "
78498	78509	78510	78510	I	0	" I must reply to your question indirectly , Sir , "
78513	78531	78510	78510	I	0	" You asked me last night who the Mr. Sherwin was who has called here so often - "
78532	78579	78468	78468	he	2120	" And this morning I ask it again . I have other questions to put to you , besides - you called constantly on a woman 's name in your delirium . But I will repeat last night 's question first - who is Mr. Sherwin ? "
78580	78584	78510	78510	I	0	" He lives - "
78585	78602	78468	78468	he	2120	" I do n't ask where he lives . Who is he ? What is he ? "
78603	78612	78510	78510	I	0	" Mr. Sherwin is a linen - draper - "
78613	78794	78468	78468	he	2120	" You owe him money ? - you have borrowed money of him ? Why did you not tell me this before ? You have degraded my house by letting a man call at the door - I know it ! - in the character of a dun . He has inquired about you as his ' friend , ' - the servants told me of it . This money - lending tradesman , your ' friend ! ' If I had heard that the poorest labourer on my land called you ' friend , ' I should have held you honoured by the attachment and gratitude of an honest man . When I hear that name given to you by a tradesman and money - lender , I hold you contaminated by connection with a cheat . You were right , Sir ! - this is disgrace ; how much do you owe ? Where are your dishonoured acceptances ? Where have you used my name and my credit ? Tell me at once - I insist on it ! "
78818	78835	78795	78795	He	2121	" I owe no money to Mr. Sherwin , Sir - no money to any one . "
78840	78847	78848	78848	he	2121	" No money to any one ? "
78859	78885	78848	78848	he	2121	" You spoke of disgrace just now . There is a worse disgrace then that you have hidden from me , than debts dishonourably contracted ? "
78916	79016	78897	78897	He	2121	" Speak ! and speak honestly if you can . How have you been deceiving me ? A woman 's name escaped you constantly , when your delirium was at its worst . You used some very strange expressions about her , which it was impossible altogether to comprehend ; but you said enough to show that her character was one of the most abandoned ; that her licentiousness - it is too revolting to speak of her - I return to you . I insist on knowing how far your vices have compromised you with that vicious woman . "
79017	79030	79031	79031	I	0	" She has wronged me - cruelly , horribly , wronged me - "
79049	79067	79037	79037	My	0	" Who is she ? You called her Margaret , in your illness - who is she ? "
79068	79076	79099	79099	him	2125	" She is Mr. Sherwin 's daughter - "
79104	79120	79099	79099	him	2125	" That man 's daughter ! - a worse bait than the bait of money ! "
79142	79145	79146	79146	he	2125	" Basil ! "
79149	79169	79146	79146	he	2125	" in God 's name , answer me at once ! What is Mr. Sherwin 's daughter to you ? "
79170	79176	79177	79177	I	0	" She is my wife ! "
79757	79767	79749	79749	I	0	" Have you anything more to say to me ? "
79928	79935	79936	79936	he	147	" Spare me any more details , "
79941	79953	79936	79936	he	147	" you have humiliated me sufficiently - you have spoken enough . "
80539	80547	80548	80548	he	147	" I came here , this morning , "
80551	80665	80548	80548	he	147	" prepared to hear of faults and misfortunes which should pain me to the heart ; which I might never , perhaps , be able to forget , however willing and even predetermined to forgive . But I did not come prepared to hear , that unutterable disgrace had been cast on me and mine , by my own child . I have no words of rebuke or of condemnation for this : the reproach and the punishment have fallen already where the guilt was - and not there only . My son 's infamy defiles his brother 's birthright , and puts his father to shame . Even his sister 's name - "
80685	80735	80737	80737	he	147	" I say it again : - you are below all reproach and all condemnation ; but I have a duty to perform towards my two who are absent , and I have a last word to say to you when that duty is done . On this page - "
80749	80958	80744	80744	his	147	" on this page there is a blank space left , after the last entry , for writing the future events of your life . Here , then , if I still acknowledge you to be my son ; if I think your presence and the presence of my daughter possible in the same house , must be written such a record of dishonour and degradation as has never yet defiled a single page of this book - here , the foul stain of your marriage , and its consequences , must be admitted to spread over all that is pure before it , and to taint to the last whatever comes after . This shall not be . I have no faith or hope in you more . I know you now , only as an enemy to me and to my house - it is mockery and hypocrisy to call you son ; it is an insult to Clara , and even to Ralph , to think of you as my child . In this record your place is destroyed - and destroyed for ever . Would to God I could tear the past from my memory , as I tear the leaf from this book ! "
81123	81128	81129	81129	he	2156	" Now , Sir , "
81132	81182	81183	81183	he	2156	" we treat together as strangers . You are Mr. Sherwin 's son - not mine . You are the husband of his daughter - not a relation of my family . Rise , as I do : we sit together no longer in the same room . Write ! "
81194	81302	81183	81183	he	2156	" write your terms there - I shall find means to keep you to a written engagement - the terms of your absence , for life , from this country ; and of hers : the terms of your silence , and of the silence of your accomplices ; of all of them . Write what you please ; I am ready to pay dearly for your absence , your secrecy , and your abandonment of the name you have degraded . My God ! that I should live to bargain for hushing up the dishonour of my family , and to bargain for it with you . "
81373	81376	81377	81377	he	2160	" Stop ! "
81380	81391	81377	81377	he	2160	" Do you pretend that you have not understood me ? "
81392	81494	81347	81347	his	2160	" It is because I have understood you , Sir , that I go . I have deserved your anger , and have submitted without a murmur to all that it could inflict . If you see in my conduct towards you no mitigation of my offence ; if you can not view the shame and wrong inflicted on me , with such grief as may have some pity mixed with it - I have , I think , the right to ask that your contempt may be silent , and your last words to me , not words of insult . "
81495	81555	81377	81377	he	2160	" Insult ! After what has happened , is it for you to utter that word in the tone in which you have just spoken it ? I tell you again , I insist on your written engagement as I would insist on the engagement of a stranger - I will have it , before you leave this room ! "
81556	81615	81347	81347	his	2160	" All , and more than all , which that degrading engagement could imply , I will do . But I have not fallen so low yet , as to be bribed to perform a duty . You may be able to forget that you are my father ; I can never forget that I am your son . "
81616	81669	81377	81377	he	2160	" The remembrance will avail you nothing as long as I live . I tell you again , I insist on your written engagement , though it were only to show that I have ceased to believe in your word . Write at once - do you hear me ? - Write ! "
81712	81716	81717	81717	he	2161	" You refuse ? "
81721	81730	81347	81347	his	2160	" I have already told you , Sir - "
81731	81734	81735	81735	he	2161	" Go ! "
81744	81865	81735	81735	he	2161	" go out from this house , never to return to it again - go , not as a stranger to me , but as an enemy ! I have no faith in a single promise you have made : there is no baseness which I do not believe you will yet be guilty of . But I tell you , and the wretches with whom you are leagued , to take warning : I have wealth , power , and position ; and there is no use to which I will not put them against the man or woman who threatens the fair fame of this family . Leave me , remembering that - and leave me for ever ! "
82116	82119	82120	82120	he	147	" Clara ! "
82173	82176	82186	82186	his	147	" Clara ! "
82202	82205	82206	82206	he	147	" Clara , "
82213	82262	82206	82206	he	147	" let go his hand ; this is not a time for your presence , I beg you to leave us . You must not take his hand ! He has ceased to be my son , or your brother . Clara , do you not hear me ? "
82263	82272	82273	82273	she	2174	" Yes , Sir , I hear you , "
82276	82290	82273	82273	she	2174	" God grant that my mother in heaven may not hear you too ! "
82330	82344	82345	82345	he	2175	" You have spoken , Clara , as you should not have spoken , "
82353	82357	82358	82358	his	2175	" Your mother - "
82365	82408	82358	82358	his	2175	" Can you still hold his hand after what I have said ? I tell you again , he is unworthy to be in your presence ; my house is his home no longer - must I command you to leave him ? "
82435	82442	82443	82443	he	2175	" Now leave us , Clara , "
82446	82483	82443	82443	he	2175	" You were wrong , my love , to be in that room , and wrong to come in here . I will speak to you up - stairs - you must remain here no longer . "
82495	82503	82504	82504	she	2177	" I can not go , Sir , "
82510	82529	82530	82530	he	2175	" Must I tell you for the first time in your life , that you are acting disobediently ? "
82533	82539	82540	82540	she	2177	" I can not go , "
82547	82566	82540	82540	she	2177	" till you have said you will let him atone for his offence , and will forgive him . "
82567	82594	82616	82616	him	2175	" For his offence there is neither atonement nor forgiveness . Clara ! are you so changed , that you can disobey me to my face ? "
82605	82612	82613	82613	She	2177	" Oh , no ! no ! "
82636	82639	82640	82640	she	2177	" Basil , "
82643	82854	82640	82640	she	2177	" you have not done what you promised me ; you have not been patient . Oh , Sir , if I have ever deserved kindness from you , be kind to him for my sake ! Basil ! speak , Basil ! Ask his pardon on your knees . Father , I promised him he should be forgiven , if I asked you . Not a word ; not a word from either ? Basil ! you are not going yet - not going at all ! Remember , Sir , how good and kind he has always been to me . My poor mother , I must speak of her , my poor mother 's favourite son - you have told me so yourself ! and he has always been my favourite brother ; I think because my mother loved him so ! His first fault , too ! his first grief ! And will you tell him for this , that our home is his home no longer ? Punish me , Sir ! I have done wrong like him ; when I heard your voices so loud , I listened in the library . He 's going ! No , no , no ! not yet ! "
82891	82903	82904	82904	she	2179	" Come back - come back with me to his knees ! "
82934	82945	82946	82946	she	2179	" Come back , or you will drive me mad ! "
82964	82967	82968	82968	he	147	" Clara , "
82971	82979	82980	82980	He	147	" I command you , leave him ! "
82988	82991	82992	82992	he	147	" Go ! "
82995	83011	82992	82992	he	147	" if you are human in your villany , you will release me from this ! "
83018	83029	83012	83012	I	0	" I will write , love - I will write , "
84102	84105	84099	84099	she	315	" Miss Margaret "
84115	84129	84099	84099	she	315	" Miss Margaret is upstairs , Sir . I suppose you would like - "
84130	84147	84099	84099	she	315	" I have no wish to see her : I want to speak to Mr. Sherwin . "
84256	84291	84242	84242	his	42	" So you have come at last , have you ? Just let 's step into the drawing - room : the fact is - I thought I wrote to you about it - ? "
84330	84337	84338	84338	he	42	" Why do n't you speak ? "
84347	84370	84338	84338	he	42	" What are you looking at me like that for ? Stop ! Let 's say our say in the other room . "
84449	84453	84454	84454	he	42	" Now then , "
84464	84485	84454	84454	he	42	" it 's only across the hall , you know ; and I always receive visitors in the best room . "
84486	84493	84494	84494	I	0	" I have been admitted here , "
84497	84544	84494	84494	I	0	" and have neither time nor inclination to follow you from room to room , just as you like . What I have to say is not much ; and , unless you give me fit reasons to the contrary , I shall say it here . "
84545	84586	84587	84587	He	2220	" You will , will you ? Let me tell you that 's damned like what we plain mercantile men call downright incivility . I say it again - incivility ; and rudeness too , if you like it better . "
84623	84626	84627	84627	he	2220	" Well , "
84639	84727	84627	84627	he	2220	" do as you like ; stop here - you 'll wish you had n't before long , I 'll be bound ! You do n't seem to hurry yourself much about speaking , so I shall sit down . You can do as you please . Now then ! just let 's cut it short - do you come here in a friendly way , to ask me to send for my girl downstairs , and to show yourself the gentleman , or do you not ? "
84728	84739	84494	84494	I	0	" You have written me two letters , Mr. Sherwin - "
84740	84758	84627	84627	he	2220	" Yes : and took devilish good care you should get them - I left them myself . "
84759	84785	84494	84494	I	0	" In writing those letters , you were either grossly deceived ; and , in that case , are only to be pitied , or - "
84786	84804	84627	84627	he	2220	" Pitied ! what the devil do you mean by that ? Nobody wants your pity here . "
84805	84854	84494	84494	I	0	" Or you have been trying to deceive me ; and in that case , I have to tell you that deceit is henceforth useless . I know all - more than you suspect : more , I believe , than you would wish me to have known . "
84855	84998	84627	84627	he	2220	" Oh , that 's your tack , is it ? By God , I expected as much the moment you came in ! What ! you do n't believe my girl - do n't you ? You 're going to fight shy , and behave like a scamp - are you ? Damn your infernal coolness and your aristocratic airs and graces ! You shall see I 'll be even with you - you shall . Ha ! ha ! look here ! - here 's the marriage certificate safe in my pocket . You wo n't do the honourable by my poor child - wo n't you ? Come out ! Come away ! You 'd better - I 'm off to your father to blow the whole business ; I am , as sure as my name 's Sherwin ! "
85050	85058	85059	85059	I	0	" I warn you to remain here , "
85062	85092	85059	85059	I	0	" This morning , my father has heard all from my lips . He has renounced me as his son , and I have left his house for ever . "
85110	85119	85120	85120	he	2221	" Then you come to me a beggar ! "
85124	85250	85120	85120	he	2221	" a beggar who has taken me in about his fine family , and his fine prospects ; a beggar who ca n't support my child - Yes ! I say it again , a beggar who looks me in the face , and talks as you do . I do n't care a damn about you or your father ! I know my rights ; I 'm an Englishman , thank God ! I know my rights , and my Margaret 's rights ; and I 'll have them in spite of you both . Yes ! you may stare as angry as you like ; staring do n't hurt . I 'm an honest man , and my girl 's an honest girl ! "
85298	85308	85309	85309	he	2222	" I say my girl 's an honest girl , "
85316	85439	85309	85309	he	2222	" and I dare you , or anybody - I do n't care who - to prove the contrary . You told me you knew all , just now . What all ? Come ! we 'll have this out before we do anything else . She says she 's innocent , and I say she 's innocent : and if I could find out that damnation scoundrel Mannion , and get him here , I 'd make him say it too . Now , after all that , what have you got against her ? - against your lawful wife ; and I 'll make you own her as such , and keep her as such , I can promise you ! "
85440	85454	85455	85455	I	0	" I am not here to ask questions , or to answer them , "
85458	85586	85455	85455	I	0	" my errand in this house is simply to tell you , that the miserable falsehoods contained in your letter , will avail you as little as the foul insolence of language by which you are now endeavouring to support them . I told you before , and I now tell you again , I know all . I had been inside that house , before I saw your daughter at the door ; and had heard , from her voice and his voice , what such shame and misery as you can not comprehend forbid me to repeat . To your past duplicity , and to your present violence , I have but one answer to give : - I will never see your daughter again . "
85587	85720	85722	85722	his	2223	" But you shall see her again - yes ! and keep her too ! Do you think I ca n't see through you and your precious story ? Your father 's cut you off with a shilling ; and now you want to curry favour with him again by trumping up a case against my girl , and trying to get her off your hands that way . But it wo n't do ! You 've married her , my fine gentleman , and you shall stick to her ! Do you think I would n't sooner believe her , than believe you ? Do you think I 'll stand this ? Here she is up - stairs , half heart - broken , on my hands ; here 's my wife "
85731	85858	85722	85722	his	2223	" with her mind in such a state that I 'm kept away from business , day after day , to look after her ; here 's all this crying and misery and mad goings - on in my house , because you choose to behave like a scamp - and do you think I 'll put up with it quietly ? I 'll make you do your duty to my girl , if she goes to the parish to appeal against you ! Your story indeed ! Who 'll believe that a young female , like Margaret , could have taken to a fellow like Mannion ? and kept it all a secret from you ? Who believes that , I should like to know ? "
85859	85864	85309	85309	he	2222	" I believe it ! "
86151	86155	86156	86156	he	480	" There now ! "
86159	86304	86156	86156	he	480	" you said you were sure he 'd come here , and that you 'd never take to your bed , as the Doctor wanted you , till you 'd seen him and spoken to him . Well , he has come ; there he is . He came in while you were asleep , I rather think ; and I let him stop , so that if you woke up and wanted to see him , you might . You ca n't say - nobody can say - I have n't given in to your whims and fancies after that . There ! you 've had your way , and you 've said you believe him ; and now , if I ring for the nurse , you 'll go upstairs at last , and make no more worry about it - Eh ? "
86412	86417	86418	86418	she	2230	" I am dying , "
86423	86574	86418	86418	she	2230	" Many nights have passed since that night when Margaret came home by herself and I felt something moving down into my heart , when I looked at her , which I knew was death - many nights , since I have been used to say my prayers , and think I had said them for the last time , before I dared shut my eyes in the darkness and the quiet . I have lived on till to - day , very weary of my life ever since that night when Margaret came in ; and yet , I could not die , because I had an atonement to make to you , and you never came to hear it and forgive me . I was not fit for God to take me till you came - I know that , know it to be truth from a dream . "
86607	86618	86619	86619	she	2233	" My husband has asked , who will believe you ? "
86635	86735	86619	86619	she	2233	" I have answered that I will ; for you have spoken the truth . Now , when the light of this world is fading from my eyes ; here , in this earthly home of much sorrow and suffering , which I must soon quit - in the presence of my husband - under the same roof with my sinful child - I bear you witness that you have spoken the truth . I , her mother , say it of her : Margaret Sherwin is guilty ; she is no more worthy to be called your wife . "
86825	86866	86868	86868	she	2234	" From this room I go to my death - bed . The last words I speak in this world shall be to my husband , and shall change his heart towards you . I have been weak of purpose , "
86884	87126	86868	86868	she	2234	" miserably , guiltily weak , all my life . Much sorrow and pain and heavy disappointment , when I was young , did some great harm to me which I have never recovered since . I have lived always in fear of others , and doubt of myself ; and this has made me guilty of a great sin towards you . Forgive me before I die ! I suspected the guilt that was preparing - I foreboded the shame that was to come - they hid it from others ' eyes ; but , from the first , they could not hide it from mine - and yet I never warned you as I ought ! That man had the power of Satan over me ! I always shuddered before him , as I used to shudder at the darkness when I was a little child ! My life has been all fear - fear of him ; fear of my husband , and even of my daughter ; fear , worse still , of my own thoughts , and of what I had discovered that should be told to you . When I tried to speak , you were too generous to understand me - I was afraid to think my suspicions were right , long after they should have been suspicions no longer . It was misery ! - oh , what misery from then till now ! "
87153	87210	87141	87141	She	2237	" Forgive me before I die ! I have made a terrible atonement ; I have borne witness against the innocence of my own child . My own child ! I dare not bid God bless her , if they bring her to my bedside ! - forgive me ! - forgive me before I die ! "
87239	87245	87246	87246	she	2237	" No tears for me ! "
87250	87310	87246	87246	she	2237	" Basil ! - let me call you as your mother would call you if she was alive - Basil ! pray that I may be forgiven in the dreadful Eternity to which I go , as you have forgiven me ! And , for her ? - oh ! who will pray for her when I am gone ? "
87470	87483	87465	87465	He	480	" If you do n't change your tone by to - morrow ! "
88357	88369	88370	88370	she	687	" I 'm afraid I 've been doing wrong , Sir , "
88374	88402	88370	88370	she	687	" and at this dreadful time too , when my poor mistress is dying ! If you please , Sir , I must tell you about it ! "
88422	88439	88440	88440	she	687	" I think you must have seen a man leaving a letter with me , Sir , "
88443	88458	88440	88440	she	687	" just when you came up to the door , a little while ago ? "
88459	88466	88403	88403	I	0	" Yes : I saw him . "
88467	88605	88440	88440	she	687	" It was for Miss Margaret , Sir , that letter ; and I was to keep it secret ; and - and - it is n't the first I 've taken in for her . It 's weeks and weeks ago , Sir , that the same man came with a letter , and gave me money to let nobody see it but Miss Margaret - and that time , Sir , he waited ; and she sent me with an answer to give him , in the same secret way . And now , here 's this second letter ; I do n't know who it comes from - but I have n't taken it to her yet ; I waited to show it to you , Sir , as you came out , because - "
88606	88617	88403	88403	I	0	" Why , Susan ? - tell me candidly why ? "
88618	88741	88440	88440	she	687	" I hope you wo n't take it amiss , Sir , if I say that having lived in the family so long as I have , I ca n't help knowing a little about what you and Miss Margaret used to be to each other , and that something 's happened wrong between you lately ; and so , Sir , it seems to be very bad and dishonest in me after first helping you to come together , as I did , to be giving her strange letters , unknown to you . They may be bad letters . I 'm sure I would n't wish to say anything disrespectful , or that did n't become my place ; but - "
88742	88759	88403	88403	I	0	" Go on , Susan - speak as freely and as truly to me as ever . "
88760	88911	88440	88440	she	687	" Well , Sir , Miss Margaret 's been very much altered , ever since that night when she came home alone , and frightened us so . She shuts herself up in her room , and wo n't speak to anybody except my master ; she does n't seem to care about anything that happens ; and sometimes she looks so at me , when I 'm waiting on her , that I 'm almost afraid to be in the same room with her . I 've never heard her mention your name once , Sir ; and I 'm fearful there 's something on her mind that there ought n't to be . He 's a very shabby man that leaves the letters - would you please to look at this , and say whether you think it 's right in me to take it up - stairs . "
88926	88938	88940	88941	the girl	687	" Oh , Sir ! please , please do take it ! "
88944	89054	88940	88941	the girl	687	" I did wrong , I 'm afraid , in giving her the first ; but I ca n't do wrong again , when my poor mistress is dying in the house . I ca n't keep secrets , Sir , that may be bad secrets , at such a dreadful time as this ; I could n't have laid down in my bed to - night , when there 's likely to be death in the house , if I had n't confessed what I 've done ; and my poor mistress has always been so kind and good to us servants - better than ever we deserved . "
89159	89173	89439	89439	She	2279	" I know as little about it , Susan , as you do . "
89174	89192	89377	89377	She	2279	" But ought I to take it up - stairs , Sir ? only tell me that ! "
89193	89228	89439	89439	She	2279	" It is not for me to say . All interest or share on my part , Susan , in what she - in what your young mistress receives , is at an end . "
89229	89256	89377	89377	She	2279	" I 'm very sorry to hear you say that , Sir ; very , very sorry . But what would you advise me to do ? "
89257	89267	89439	89439	She	2279	" Let me look at the letter once more . "
89298	89331	89377	89377	She	2279	" I respect your scruples , Susan , but I am not the person to remove or to justify them . Why should you not apply in this difficulty to your master ? "
89332	89376	89377	89377	She	2279	" I dare not , Sir ; I dare not for my life . He 's been worse than ever , lately ; if I said as much to him as I 've said to you , I believe he 'd kill me ! "
89385	89438	89377	89377	She	2279	" Well , at any rate I 've told you , Sir , and that 's made my mind easier ; and - and I 'll give her the letter this once , and then take in no more - if they come , unless I hear a proper account of them . "
89679	89683	89684	89685	V. Mannion	74	" ROBERT MANNION . "
89814	89818	89819	89819	I	0	" Robert Mannion ! "
89987	89992	101002	101002	I	0	" St. Helen 's Hospital .
89993	90059	101002	101002	I	0	" You may look at the signature when you receive this , and may be tempted to tear up my letter , and throw it from you unread . I warn you to read what I have written , and to estimate , if you can , its importance to yourself . Destroy these pages afterwards if you like - they will have served their purpose .
90060	90137	101002	101002	I	0	" Do you know where I am , and what I suffer ? I am one of the patients of this hospital , hideously mutilated for life by your hand . If I could have known certainly the day of my dismissal , I should have waited to tell you with my own lips what I now write - but I am ignorant of this . At the very point of recovery I have suffered a relapse .
90138	90180	101002	101002	I	0	" You will silence any uneasy upbraidings of conscience , should you feel them , by saying that I have deserved death at your hands . I will tell you , in answer , what you deserve and shall receive at mine .
90181	90307	101002	101002	I	0	" But I will first assume that it was knowledge of your wife 's guilt which prompted your attack on me . I am well aware that she has declared herself innocent , and that her father supports her declaration . By the time you receive this letter my injuries oblige me to allow myself a whole fortnight to write it in , I shall have taken measures which render further concealment unnecessary . Therefore , if my confession avail you aught , you have it here : - She is guilty : willingly guilty , remember , whatever she may say to the contrary . You may believe this , and believe all I write hereafter . Deception between us two is at an end .
90308	90332	101002	101002	I	0	" I have told you Margaret Sherwin is guilty . Why was she guilty ? What was the secret of my influence over her ?
90333	90408	101002	101002	I	0	" To make you comprehend what I have now to communicate , it is necessary for me to speak of myself ; and of my early life . To - morrow , I will undertake this disclosure - to - day , I can neither hold the pen , nor see the paper any longer . If you could look at my face , where I am now laid , you would know why ! "
90409	90624	101002	101002	I	0	" When we met for the first time at North Villa , I had not been five minutes in your presence before I detected your curiosity to know something about me , and perceived that you doubted , from the first , whether I was born and bred for such a situation as I held under Mr. Sherwin . Failing - as I knew you would fail - to gain any information about me from my employer or his family , you tried , at various times , to draw me into familiarity , to get me to talk unreservedly to you ; and only gave up the attempt to penetrate my secret , whatever it might be , when we parted after our interview at my house on the night of the storm . On that night , I determined to baulk your curiosity , and yet to gain your confidence ; and I succeeded . You little thought , when you bade me farewell at my own door , that you had given your hand and your friendship to a man , who - long before you met with Margaret Sherwin - had inherited the right to be the enemy of your father , and of every descendant of your father 's house .
90625	90640	101002	101002	I	0	" Does this declaration surprise you ? Read on , and you will understand it .
90641	90791	101002	101002	I	0	" I am the son of a gentleman . My father 's means were miserably limited , and his family was not an old family , like yours . Nevertheless , he was a gentleman in anybody 's sense of the word ; he knew it , and that knowledge was his ruin . He was a weak , kind , careless man ; a worshipper of conventionalities ; and a great respecter of the wide gaps which lay between social stations in his time . Thus , he determined to live like a gentleman , by following a gentleman 's pursuit - a profession , as distinguished from a trade . Failing in this , he failed to follow out his principle , and starve like a gentleman . He died the death of a felon ; leaving me no inheritance but the name of a felon 's son .
90792	90940	101002	101002	I	0	" While still a young man , he contrived to be introduced to a gentleman of great family , great position , and great wealth . He interested , or fancied he interested , this gentleman ; and always looked on him as the patron who was to make his fortune , by getting him the first government sinecure they were plenty enough in those days ! which might fall vacant . In firm and foolish expectation of this , he lived far beyond his little professional income - lived among rich people without the courage to make use of them as a poor man . It was the old story : debts and liabilities of all kinds pressed heavy on him - creditors refused to wait - exposure and utter ruin threatened him - and the prospect of the sinecure was still as far off as ever .
90941	91123	101002	101002	I	0	" Nevertheless he believed in the advent of this office ; and all the more resolutely now , because he looked to it as his salvation . He was quite confident of the interest of his patron , and of its speedy exertion in his behalf . Perhaps , that gentleman had overrated his own political influence ; perhaps , my father had been too sanguine , and had misinterpreted polite general promises into special engagements . However it was , the bailiffs came into his house one morning , while help from a government situation , or any situation , was as unattainable as ever - came to take him to prison : to seize everything , in execution , even to the very bed on which my mother then seriously ill was lying . The whole fabric of false prosperity which he had been building up to make the world respect him , was menaced with instant and shameful overthrow . He had not the courage to let it go ; so he took refuge from misfortune in a crime .
91124	91330	101002	101002	I	0	" He forged a bond , to prop up his credit for a little time longer . The name he made use of was the name of his patron . In doing this , he believed - as all men who commit crime believe - that he had the best possible chance of escaping consequences . In the first place , he might get the long - expected situation in time to repay the amount of the bond before detection . In the second place , he had almost the certainty of a legacy from a rich relative , old and in ill - health , whose death might be fairly expected from day to day . If both these prospects failed and they did fail , there was still a third chance - the chance that his rich patron would rather pay the money than appear against him . In those days they hung for forgery . My father believed it to be impossible that a man at whose table he had sat , whose relatives and friends he had amused and instructed by his talents , would be the man to give evidence which should condemn him to be hanged on the public scaffold .
91331	91401	101002	101002	I	0	" He was wrong . The wealthy patron held strict principles of honour which made no allowance for temptations and weaknesses ; and was moreover influenced by high - flown notions of his responsibilities as a legislator he was a member of Parliament to the laws of his country . He appeared accordingly , and gave evidence against the prisoner ; who was found guilty , and left for execution .
91402	91481	101002	101002	I	0	" Then , when it was too late , this man of pitiless honour thought himself at last justified in leaning to the side of mercy , and employed his utmost interest , in every direction , to obtain a mitigation of the sentence to transportation for life . The application failed ; even a reprieve of a few days was denied . At the appointed time , my father died on the scaffold by the hangman 's hand .
91482	91551	101002	101002	I	0	" Have you suspected , while reading this part of my letter , who the high - born gentleman was whose evidence hung him ? If you have not , I will tell you . That gentleman was your father . You will now wonder no longer how I could have inherited the right to be his enemy , and the enemy of all who are of his blood .
91552	91617	101002	101002	I	0	" The shock of her husband 's horrible death deprived my mother of reason . She lived a few months after his execution ; but never recovered her faculties . I was their only child ; and was left penniless to begin life as the son of a father who had been hanged , and of a mother who had died in a public madhouse .
91618	91648	101002	101002	I	0	" More of myself to - morrow - my letter will be a long one : I must pause often over it , as I pause to - day . "
91649	91818	101002	101002	I	0	" Well : I started in life with the hangman 's mark on me - with the parent 's shame for the son 's reputation . Wherever I went , whatever friends I kept , whatever acquaintances I made - people knew how my father had died : and showed that they knew it . Not so much by shunning or staring at me vile as human nature is , there were not many who did that , as by insulting me with over - acted sympathy , and elaborate anxiety to sham entire ignorance of my father 's fate . The gallows - brand was on my forehead ; but they were too benevolently blind to see it . The gallows - infamy was my inheritance ; but they were too resolutely generous to discover it ! This was hard to bear . However , I was strong - hearted even then , when my sensations were quick , and my sympathies young : so I bore it .
91819	91904	101002	101002	I	0	" My only weakness was my father 's weakness - the notion that I was born to a station ready made for me , and that the great use of my life was to live up to it . My station ! I battled for that with the world for years and years , before I discovered that the highest of all stations is the station a man makes for himself : and the lowest , the station that is made for him by others .
91905	91987	101002	101002	I	0	" At starting in life , your father wrote to make me offers of assistance - assistance , after he had ruined me ! Assistance to the child , from hands which had tied the rope round the parent 's neck ! I sent him back his letter . He knew that I was his enemy , his son 's enemy , and his son 's son 's enemy , as long as I lived . I never heard from him again .
91988	92264	101002	101002	I	0	" Trusting boldly to myself to carve out my own way , and to live down my undeserved ignominy ; resolving in the pride of my integrity to combat openly and fairly with misfortune , I shrank , at first , from disowning my parentage and abandoning my father 's name . Standing on my own character , confiding in my intellect and my perseverance , I tried pursuit after pursuit , and was beaten afresh at every new effort . Whichever way I turned , the gallows still rose as the same immovable obstacle between me and fortune , between me and station , between me and my fellowmen . I was morbidly sensitive on this point . The slightest references to my father 's fate , however remote or accidental , curdled my blood . I saw open insult , or humiliating compassion , or forced forbearance , in the look and manner of every man about me . So I broke off with old friends , and tried new ; and , in seeking fresh pursuits , sought fresh connections , where my father 's infamy might be unknown . Wherever I went , the old stain always broke out afresh , just at the moment when I had deceived myself into the belief that it was utterly effaced . I had a warm heart then - it was some time before it turned to stone , and felt nothing . Those were the days when failure and humiliation could still draw tears from me : that epoch in my life is marked in my memory as the epoch when I could weep .
92265	92512	101002	101002	I	0	" At last , I gave way before difficulty , and conceded the first step to the calamity which had stood front to front with me so long . I left the neighbourhood where I was known , and assumed the name of a schoolfellow who had died . For some time this succeeded ; but the curse of my father 's death followed me , though I saw it not . After various employments - still , mind , the employments of a gentleman ! - had first supported , then failed me , I became an usher at a school . It was there that my false name was detected , and my identity discovered again - I never knew through whom . The exposure was effected by some enemy , anonymously . For several days , I thought everybody in the school treated me in an altered way . The cause came out , first in whispers , then in reckless jests , while I was taking care of the boys in the playground . In the fury of the moment I struck one of the most insolent , and the eldest of them , and hurt him rather seriously . The parents heard of it , and threatened me with prosecution ; the whole neighbourhood was aroused . I had to leave my situation secretly , by night , or the mob would have pelted the felon 's son out of the parish .
92513	92758	101002	101002	I	0	" I went back to London , bearing another assumed name ; and tried , as a last resource to save me from starvation , the resource of writing . I served my apprenticeship to literature as a hack - author of the lowest degree . Knowing I had talents which might be turned to account , I tried to vindicate them by writing an original work . But my experience of the world had made me unfit to dress my thoughts in popular costume : I could only tell bitter truths bitterly ; I exposed licenced hypocrisies too openly ; I saw the vicious side of many respectabilities , and said I saw it - in short , I called things by their right names ; and no publisher would treat with me . So I stuck to my low task - work ; my penny - a lining in third - class newspapers ; my translating from Frenchmen and Germans , and plagiarising from dead authors , to supply the raw material for bookmongering by more accomplished bookmongers than I. In this life , there was one advantage which compensated for much misery and meanness , and bitter , biting disappointment : I could keep my identity securely concealed . Character was of no consequence to me ; nobody cared to know who I was , or to inquire what I had been - the gallows - mark was smoothed out at last !
92759	92883	101002	101002	I	0	" While I was living thus on the offal of literature , I met with a woman of good birth , and fair fortune , whose sympathies or whose curiosity I happened to interest . She and her father and mother received me favourably , as a gentleman who had known better days , and an author whom the public had undeservedly neglected . How I managed to gain their confidence and esteem , without alluding to my parentage , it is not worth while to stop to describe . That I did so you will easily imagine , when I tell you that the woman to whom I refer , consented , with her father 's full approval , to become my wife .
92884	93050	101002	101002	I	0	" The very day of the marriage was fixed . I believed I had successfully parried all perilous inquiries - but I was wrong . A relation of the family , whom I had never seen , came to town a short time before the wedding . We disliked each other on our first introduction . He was a clever , resolute man of the world , and privately inquired about me to much better purpose in a few days , than his family had done in several months . Accident favoured him strangely , everything was discovered - literally everything - and I was contemptuously dismissed the house . Could a lady of respectability marry a man no matter how worthy in her eyes whose father had been hanged , whose mother had died in a madhouse , who had lived under assumed names , who had been driven from an excellent country neighbourhood , for cruelty to a harmless school - boy ? Impossible !
93051	93065	101002	101002	I	0	" With this event , my long strife and struggle with the world ended .
93066	93248	101002	101002	I	0	" My eyes opened to a new view of life , and the purpose of life . My first aspirations to live up to my birth - right position , in spite of adversity and dishonour , to make my name sweet enough in men 's nostrils , to cleanse away the infamy on my father 's , were now no more . The ambition which - whether I was a hack - author , a travelling portrait - painter , or an usher at a school - had once whispered to me : low down as you are in dark , miry ways , you are on the path which leads upward to high places in the sunshine afar - off ; you are not working to scrape together wealth for another man ; you are independent , self - reliant , labouring in your own cause - the daring ambition which had once counselled thus , sank dead within me at last . The strong , stern spirit was beaten by spirits stronger and sterner yet - Infamy and Want .
93249	93368	101002	101002	I	0	" I wrote to a man of character and wealth ; one of my friends of early days , who had ceased to hold communication with me , like other friends , but , unlike them , had given me up in genuine sorrow : I wrote , and asked him to meet me privately by night . I was too ragged to go to his house , too sensitive still even if I had gone and had been admitted to risk encountering people there , who either knew my father , or knew how he had died . I wished to speak to my former friend , unseen , and made the appointment accordingly . He kept it .
93369	93766	101002	101002	I	0	" When we met , I said to him : - I have a last favour to ask of you . When we parted years ago , I had high hopes and brave resolutions - both are worn out . I then believed that I could not only rise superior to my misfortune , but could make that very misfortune the motive of my rise . You told me I was too quick of temper , too morbidly sensitive about the slightest reference to my father 's death , too fierce and changeable under undeserved trial and disappointment . This might have been true then ; but I am altered now : pride and ambition have been persecuted and starved out of me . An obscure , monotonous life , in which thought and spirit may be laid asleep , never to wake again , is the only life I care for . Help me to lead it . I ask you , first , as a beggar , to give me from your superfluity , apparel decent enough to bear the daylight . I ask you next , to help me to some occupation which will just give me my bread , my shelter , and my hour or two of solitude in the evening . You have plenty of influence to do this , and you know I am honest . You can not choose me too humble and obscure an employment ; let me descend low enough to be lost to sight beneath the world I have lived in ; let me go among people who want to know that I work honestly for them , and want to know nothing more . Get me a mean hiding - place to conceal myself and my history in for ever , and then neither attempt to see me nor communicate with me again . If former friends chance to ask after me , tell them I am dead , or gone into another country . The wisest life is the life the animals lead : I want , like them , to serve my master for food , shelter , and liberty to lie asleep now and then in the sunshine , without being driven away as a pest or a trespasser . Do you believe in this resolution ? - it is my last .
93767	93795	101002	101002	I	0	" He did believe in it ; and he granted what I asked . Through his interference and recommendation , I entered the service of Mr. Sherwin . -
93796	93929	101002	101002	I	0	" I must stop here for to - day . To - morrow I shall come to disclosures of vital interest to you . Have you been surprised that I , your enemy by every cause of enmity that one man can have against another , should write to you so fully about the secrets of my early life ? I have done so , because I wish the strife between us to be an open strife on my side ; because I desire that you should know thoroughly what you have to expect from my character , after such a life as I have led . There was purpose in my deceit , when I deceived you - there is purpose in my frankness , when I now tell you all . "
93930	94133	101002	101002	I	0	" I began in Mr. Sherwin 's employment , as the lowest clerk in his office . Both the master and the men looked a little suspiciously on me , at first . My account of myself was always the same - simple and credible ; I had entered the counting - house with the best possible recommendation , and I acted up to it . These circumstances in my favour , joined to a manner that never varied , and to a steadiness at my work that never relaxed , soon produced their effect - all curiosity about me gradually died away : I was left to pursue my avocations in peace . The friend who had got me my situation , preserved my secret as I had desired him ; of all the people whom I had formerly known , pitiless enemies and lukewarm adherents , not one ever suspected that my hiding - place was the back office of a linen - draper 's shop . For the first time in my life , I felt that the secret of my father 's misfortune was mine , and mine only ; that my security from exposure was at length complete .
94134	94374	101002	101002	I	0	" Before long , I rose to the chief place in the counting - house . It was no very difficult matter for me to discover , that my new master 's character had other elements besides that of the highest respectability . In plain terms , I found him to be a pretty equal compound by nature , of the fool , the tyrant , and the coward . There was only one direction in which what grovelling sympathies he had , could be touched to some purpose . Save him waste , or get him profit ; and he was really grateful . I succeeded in working both these marvels . His managing man cheated him ; I found it out ; refused to be bribed to collusion ; and exposed the fraud to Mr. Sherwin . This got me his confidence , and the place of chief clerk . In that position , I discovered a means , which had never occurred to my employer , of greatly enlarging his business and its profits , with the least possible risk . He tried my plan , and it succeeded . This gained me his warmest admiration , an increase of salary , and a firm footing in his family circle . My projects were more than fulfilled : I had money enough , and leisure enough ; and spent my obscure existence exactly as I had proposed .
94375	94448	101002	101002	I	0	" But my life was still not destined to be altogether devoid of an animating purpose . When I first knew Margaret Sherwin , she was just changing from childhood to girlhood . I marked the promise of future beauty in her face and figure ; and secretly formed the resolution which you afterwards came forward to thwart , but which I have executed , and will execute , in spite of you .
94449	94648	101002	101002	I	0	" The thoughts out of which that resolution sprang , counselled me more calmly than you can suppose . I said within myself : ' The best years of my life have been irrevocably wasted ; misery and humiliation and disaster have followed my steps from my youth ; of all the pleasant draughts which other men drink to sweeten existence , not one has passed my lips . I will know happiness before I die ; and this girl shall confer it . She shall grow up to maturity for me : I will imperceptibly gain such a hold on her affections , while they are yet young and impressible , that , when the time comes , and I speak the word - though my years more than double hers , though I am dependent on her father for the bread I eat , though parents ' voice and lover 's voice unite to call her back - she shall still come to my side , and of her own free will put her hand in mine , and follow me wherever I go ; my wife , my mistress , my servant , which I choose .
94649	94830	101002	101002	I	0	" This was my project . To execute it , time and opportunity were mine ; and I steadily and warily made use of them , hour by hour , day by day , year by year . From first to last , the girl 's father never suspected me . Besides the security which he felt in my age , he had judged me by his own small commercial standard , and had found me a model of integrity . A man who had saved him from being cheated , who had so enlarged and consolidated his business as to place him among the top dignitaries of the trade ; who was the first to come to the desk in the morning , and the last to remain there in the evening ; who had not only never demanded , but had absolutely refused to take , a single holiday - such a man as this was , morally and intellectually , a man in ten thousand ; a man to be admired and trusted in every relation of life !
94831	95115	101002	101002	I	0	" His confidence in me knew no bounds . He was uneasy if I was not by to advise him in the simplest matters . My ears were the first to which he confided his insane ambition on the subject of his daughter - his anxiety to see her marry above her station - his stupid resolution to give her the false , flippant , fashionable education which she subsequently received . I thwarted his plans in nothing , openly - counteracted them in everything , secretly . The more I strengthened my sources of influence over Margaret , the more pleased he was . He was delighted to hear her constantly referring to me about her home - lessons ; to see her coming to me , evening after evening , to learn new occupations and amusements . He suspected I had been a gentleman ; he had been told I spoke pure English ; he felt sure I had received a first - rate education - I was nearly as good for Margaret as good society itself ! When she grew older , and went to the fashionable school , as her father had declared she should , my offer to keep up her lessons in the holidays , and to examine what progress she had made , when she came home regularly every fortnight for the Sunday , was accepted with greedy readiness , and acknowledged with servile gratitude . At this time , Mr. Sherwin 's own estimate of me , among his friends , was , that he had got me for half nothing , and that I was worth more to him than a thousand a - year .
95116	95416	101002	101002	I	0	" But there was one member of the family who suspected my intentions from the first . Mrs. Sherwin - the weak , timid , sickly woman , whose opinion nobody regarded , whose character nobody understood - Mrs. Sherwin , of all those who dwelt in the house , or came to the house , was the only one whose looks , words , and manner kept me constantly on my guard . The very first time we saw each other , that woman doubted me , as I doubted her ; and for ever afterwards , when we met , she was on the watch . This mutual distrust , this antagonism of our two natures , never openly proclaimed itself , and never wore away . My chance of security lay , not so much in my own caution , and my perfect command of look and action under all emergencies , as in the self - distrust and timidity of her nature ; in the helpless inferiority of position to which her husband 's want of affection , and her daughter 's want of respect , condemned her in her own house ; and in the influence of repulsion - at times , even of absolute terror - which my presence had the power of communicating to her . Suspecting what I am assured she suspected - incapable as she was of rendering her suspicions certainties - knowing beforehand , as she must have known , that no words she could speak would gain the smallest respect or credit from her husband or her child - that woman 's life , while I was at North Villa , must have been a life of the direst mental suffering to which any human being was ever condemned .
95417	95531	101002	101002	I	0	" As time passed , and Margaret grew older , her beauty both of face and form approached nearer to perfection than I had foreseen , closely as I watched her . But neither her mind nor her disposition kept pace with her beauty . I studied her closely , with the same patient , penetrating observation , which my experience of the world has made it a habit with me to direct on every one with whom I am brought in contact - I studied her , I say , intently ; and found her worthy of nothing , not even of the slave - destiny which I had in store for her .
95532	95685	101002	101002	I	0	" She had neither heart nor mind , in the higher sense of those words . She had simply instincts - most of the bad instincts of an animal ; none of the good . The great motive power which really directed her , was Deceit . I never met with any human being so inherently disingenuous , so naturally incapable of candour even in the most trifling affairs of life , as she was . The best training could never have wholly overcome this vice in her : the education she actually got - an education under false pretences - encouraged it . Everybody has read , some people have known , of young girls who have committed the most extraordinary impostures , or sustained the most infamous false accusations ; their chief motive being often the sheer enjoyment of practising deceit . Of such characters was the character of Margaret Sherwin .
95686	95823	101002	101002	I	0	" She had strong passions , but not their frequent accompaniment - strong will , and strong intellect . She had some obstinacy , but no firmness . Appeal in the right way to her vanity , and you could make her do the thing she had declared she would not do , the minute after she had made the declaration . As for her mind , it was of the lowest schoolgirl average . She had a certain knack at learning this thing , and remembering that ; but she understood nothing fairly , felt nothing deeply . If I had not had my own motive in teaching her , I should have shut the books again , the first time she and I opened them together , and have given her up as a fool .
95824	95931	101002	101002	I	0	" All , however , that I discovered of bad in her character , never made me pause in the prosecution of my design ; I had carried it too far for that , before I thoroughly knew her . Besides , what mattered her duplicity to me ? - I could see through it . Her strong passions ? - I could control them . Her obstinacy ? - I could break it . Her poverty of intellect ? - I cared nothing about her intellect . What I wanted was youth and beauty ; she was young and beautiful and I was sure of her .
95932	96116	101002	101002	I	0	" Yes ; sure . Her showy person , showy accomplishments , and showy manners dazzled all eyes but mine - Of all the people about her , I alone found out what she really was ; and in that lay the main secret of my influence over her . I dreaded no rivalry . Her father , prompted by his ambitious hopes , kept most young men of her class away from the house ; the few who did come were not dangerous ; they were as incapable of inspiring , as she was of feeling , real love . Her mother still watched me , and still discovered nothing ; still suspected me behind my back , and still trembled before my face . Months passed on monotonously , year succeeded to year ; and I bided my time as patiently , and kept my secret as cautiously as at the first . No change occurred , nothing happened to weaken or alter my influence at North Villa , until the day arrived when Margaret left school and came home for good .
96117	96195	101002	101002	I	0	" Exactly at the period to which I have referred , certain business transactions of great importance required the presence of Mr. Sherwin , or of some confidential person to represent him , at Lyons . Secretly distrusting his own capabilities , he proposed to me to go ; saying that it would be a pleasant trip for me , and a good introduction to his wealthy manufacturing correspondents . After some consideration , I accepted his offer .
96196	96466	101002	101002	I	0	" I had never hinted a word of my intentions towards her to Margaret ; but she understood them well enough - I was certain of that , from many indications which no man could mistake . For reasons which will presently appear , I resolved not to explain myself until my return from Lyons . My private object in going there , was to make interest secretly with Mr. Sherwin 's correspondents for a situation in their house . I knew that when I made my proposals to Margaret , I must be prepared to act on them on the instant ; I knew that her father 's fury when he discovered that I had been helping to educate his daughter only for myself , would lead him to any extremities ; I knew that we must fly to some foreign country ; and , lastly , I knew the importance of securing a provision for our maintenance , when we got there . I had saved money , it is true - nearly two - thirds of my salary , every year - but had not saved enough for two . Accordingly , I left England to push my own interests , as well as my employer 's ; left it , confident that my short absence would not weaken the result of years of steady influence over Margaret . The sequel showed that , cautious and calculating as I was , I had nevertheless overlooked the chances against me , which my own experience of her vanity and duplicity ought to have enabled me thoroughly to foresee .
96467	96587	101002	101002	I	0	" Well : I had been some time at Lyons ; had managed my employer 's business from first to last , I was faithful , as I had engaged to be , to his commercial interests ; and had arranged my own affairs securely and privately . Already , I was looking forward , with sensations of happiness which were new to me , to my return and to the achievement of the one success , the solitary triumph of my long life of humiliation and disaster , when a letter arrived from Mr. Sherwin . It contained the news of your private marriage , and of the extraordinary conditions that had been attached to it with your consent .
96588	96680	101002	101002	I	0	" Other people were in the room with me when I read that letter ; but my manner betrayed nothing to them . My hand never trembled when I folded the sheet of paper again ; I was not a minute late in attending a business engagement which I had accepted ; the slightest duties of other kinds which I had to do , I rigidly fulfilled . Never did I more thoroughly and fairly earn the evening 's leisure by the morning 's work , than I earned it that day .
96681	96858	101002	101002	I	0	" Leaving the town at the close of afternoon , I walked on till I came to a solitary place on the bank of the great river which runs near Lyons . There I opened the letter for the second time , and read it through again slowly , with no necessity now for self - control , because no human being was near to look at me . There I read your name , constantly repeated in every line of writing ; and knew that the man who , in my absence , had stepped between me and my prize - the man who , in his insolence of youth , and birth , and fortune , had snatched from me the one long - delayed reward for twenty years of misery , just as my hands were stretched forth to grasp it , was the son of that honourable and high - born gentleman who had given my father to the gallows , and had made me the outcast of my social privileges for life .
96859	96983	101002	101002	I	0	" The sun was setting when I looked up from the letter ; flashes of rose - light leapt on the leaping river ; the birds were winging nestward to the distant trees , and the ghostly stillness of night was sailing solemnly over earth and sky , as the first thought of the vengeance I would have on father and son began to burn fiercely at my heart , to move like a new life within me , to whisper to my spirit - Wait : be patient ; they are both in your power ; you can now foul the father 's name as the father fouled yours - you can yet thwart the son , as the son has thwarted you .
96984	97146	101002	101002	I	0	" In the few minutes that passed , while I lingered in that lonely place after reading the letter , I imagined the whole scheme which it afterwards took a year to execute . I laid the whole plan against you and your father , the first half of which , through the accident that led you to your discovery , has alone been carried out . I believed then , as I believe now , that I stood towards you both in the place of an injured man , whose right it was , in self - defence and self - assertion , to injure you . Judged by your ideas , this may read wickedly ; but to me , after having lived and suffered as I have , the modern common - places current in the world are so many brazen images which society impudently worships - like the Jews of old - in the face of living Truth .
97147	97154	101002	101002	I	0	" Let us get back to England .
97155	97295	101002	101002	I	0	" That evening , when we met for the first time , did you observe that Margaret was unusually agitated before I came in ? I detected some change , the moment I saw her . Did you notice that I avoided speaking to her , or looking at her ? it was because I was afraid to do so . I saw that , with my return , my old influence over her was coming back : and I still believe that , hypocritical and heartless though she was , and blinded though you were by your passion for her , she would unconsciously have betrayed everything to you on that evening , if I had not acted as I did . Her mother , too ! how her mother watched me from the moment when I came in !
97296	97427	101002	101002	I	0	" Afterwards , while you were trying hard to open , undetected , the sealed history of my early life , I was warily discovering from Margaret all that I desired to know . I say ' warily , ' but the word poorly expresses my consummate caution and patience , at that time . I never put myself in her power , never risked offending , or frightening , or revolting her ; never lost an opportunity of bringing her back to her old habits of familiarity ; and , more than all , never gave her mother a single opportunity of detecting me . This was the sum of what I gathered up , bit by bit , from secret and scattered investigations , persevered in through many weeks .
97428	97687	101002	101002	I	0	" Her vanity had been hurt , her expectations disappointed , at my having left her for Lyons , with no other parting words than such as I might have spoken to any other woman whom I looked on merely as a friend . That she felt any genuine love for me I never have believed , and never shall : but I had that practical ability , that firmness of will , that obvious personal ascendancy over most of those with whom I came in contact , which extorts the respect and admiration of women of all characters , and even of women of no character at all . As far as her senses , her instincts , and her pride could take her , I had won her over to me but no farther - because no farther could she go . I mention pride among her motives , advisedly . She was proud of being the object of such attentions as I had now paid to her for years , because she fancied that , through those attentions , I , who , more or less , ruled everyone else in her sphere , had yielded to her the power of ruling me . The manner of my departure from England showed her too plainly that she had miscalculated her influence , and that the power , in her case , as in the case of others , was all on my side . Hence the wound to her vanity , to which I have alluded .
97688	97802	101002	101002	I	0	" It was while this wound was still fresh that you met her , and appealed to her self - esteem in a new direction . You must have seen clearly enough , that such proposals as yours far exceeded the most ambitious expectations formed by her father . No man 's alliance could have lifted her much higher out of her own class : she knew this , and from that knowledge married you - married you for your station , for your name , for your great friends and connections , for your father 's money , and carriages , and fine houses ; for everything , in short , but yourself .
97803	97896	101002	101002	I	0	" Still , in spite of the temptations of youth , wealth , and birth which your proposals held out to her , she accepted them at first I made her confess it herself with a secret terror and misgiving , produced by the remembrance of me . These sensations , however , she soon quelled , or fancied she quelled ; and these , it was now my last , best chance to revive . I had a whole year for the work before me ; and I felt certain of success .
97897	98163	101002	101002	I	0	" On your side , you had immense advantages . You had social superiority ; you had her father 's full approbation ; and you were married to her . If she had loved you for yourself , loved you for anything besides her own sensual interests , her vulgar ambition , her reckless vanity , every effort I could have made against you would have been defeated from the first . But , setting this out of the question , in spite of the utter heartlessness of her attachment to you , if you had not consented to that condition of waiting a year for her after marriage ; or , consenting to it , if you had broken it long before the year was out - knowing , as you should have known , that in most women 's eyes a man is not dishonoured by breaking his promise , so long as he breaks it for a woman 's sake - if , I say , you had taken either of these courses , I should still have been powerless against you . But you remained faithful to your promise , faithful to the condition , faithful to the ill - directed modesty of your love ; and that very fidelity put you in my power . A pure - minded girl would have loved you a thousand times better for acting as you did - but Margaret Sherwin was not a pure - minded girl , not a maidenly girl : I have looked into her thoughts , and I know it .
98164	98378	101002	101002	I	0	" Such were your chances against me ; and such was the manner in which you misused them . On my side , I had indefatigable patience ; personal advantages equal , with the exception of birth and age , to yours : long - established influence ; freedom to be familiar ; and more than all , that stealthy , unflagging strength of purpose which only springs from the desire of revenge . I first thoroughly tested your character , and discovered on what points it was necessary for me to be on my guard against you , when you took shelter under my roof from the storm . If your father had been with you on that night , there were moments , while the tempest was wrought to its full fury , when , if my voice could have called the thunder down on the house to crush it and every one in it to atoms , I would have spoken the word , and ended the strife for all of us . The wind , the hail , and the lightning maddened my thoughts of your father and you - I was nearly letting you see it , when that flash came between us as we parted at my door .
98379	98615	101002	101002	I	0	" How I gained your confidence , you know ; and you know also , how I contrived to make you use me , afterwards , as the secret friend who procured you privileges with Margaret which her father would not grant at your own request . This , at the outset , secured me from suspicion on your part ; and I had only to leave it to your infatuation to do the rest . With you my course was easy - with her it was beset by difficulties ; but I overcame them . Your fatal consent to wait through a year of probation , furnished me with weapons against you , which I employed to the most unscrupulous purpose . I can picture to myself what would be your indignation and your horror , if I fully described the use which I made of the position in which your compliance with her father 's conditions placed you towards Margaret . I spare you this avowal - it would be useless now . Consider me what you please ; denounce my conduct in any terms you like : my justification will always be the same . I was the injured man , you were the aggressor ; I was righting myself by getting back a possession of which you had robbed me , and any means were sanctified by such an end as that .
98616	98721	101002	101002	I	0	" But my success , so far , was of little avail , in itself ; against the all - powerful counter - attraction which you possessed . Contemptible , or not , you still had this superiority over me - you could make a fine lady of her . From that fact sprang the ambition which all my influence , dating as it did from her childhood , could not destroy . There , was fastened the main - spring which regulated her selfish devotion to you , and which it was next to impossible to snap asunder . I never made the attempt .
98722	98958	101002	101002	I	0	" The scheme which I proposed to her , when she was fully prepared to hear it , and to conceal that she had heard it , left her free to enjoy all the social advantages which your alliance could bestow - free to ride in her carriage , and go into her father 's shop that was one of her ambitions ! as a new customer added to his aristocratic connection - free even to become one of your family , unsuspected , in case your rash marriage was forgiven . Your credulity rendered the execution of this scheme easy . In what manner it was to be carried out , and what object I proposed to myself in framing it , I abstain from avowing ; for the simple reason that the discovery at which you arrived by following us on the night of the party , made my plan abortive , and has obliged me since to renounce it . I need only say , in this place , that it threatened your father as well as you , and that Margaret recoiled from it at first - not from any horror of the proposal , but through fear of discovery . Gradually , I overcame her apprehensions : very gradually , for I was not thoroughly secure of her devotion to my purpose , until your year of probation was nearly out .
98959	99278	101002	101002	I	0	" Through all that year , daily visitor as you were at North Villa , you never suspected either of us ! And yet , had you been one whit less infatuated , how many warnings you might have discovered , which , in spite of her duplicity and my caution , would then have shown themselves plainly enough to put you on your guard ! Those abrupt changes in her manner , those alternate fits of peevish silence and capricious gaiety , which sometimes displayed themselves even in your presence , had every one of them their meaning - though you could not discern it . Sometimes , they meant fear of discovery , sometimes fear of me : now , they might be traced back to hidden contempt ; now , to passions swelling under fancied outrage ; now , to secret remembrance of disclosures I had just made , or eager anticipation of disclosures I had yet to reveal . There were times at which every step of the way along which I was advancing was marked , faintly yet significantly , in her manner and her speech , could you only have interpreted them aright . My first renewal of my old influence over her , my first words that degraded you in her eyes , my first successful pleading of my own cause against yours , my first appeal to those passions in her which I knew how to move , my first proposal to her of the whole scheme which I had matured in solitude , in the foreign country , by the banks of the great river - all these separate and gradual advances on my part towards the end which I was vowed to achieve , were outwardly shadowed forth in her , consummate as were her capacities for deceit , and consummately as she learnt to use them against you .
99279	99616	101002	101002	I	0	" Do you remember noticing , on your return from the country , how ill Margaret looked , and how ill I looked ? We had some interviews during your absence , at which I spoke such words to her as would have left their mark on the face of a Jezebel , or a Messalina . Have you forgotten how often , during the latter days of your year of expectation , I abruptly left the room after you had called me in to bear you company in your evening readings ? My pretext was sudden illness ; and illness it was , but not of the body . As the time approached , I felt less and less secure of my own caution and patience . With you , indeed , I might still have considered myself safe : it was the presence of Mrs. Sherwin that drove me from the room . Under that woman 's fatal eye I shrank , when the last days drew near - I , who had defied her detection , and stood firmly on my guard against her sleepless , silent , deadly vigilance , for months and months - gave way as the end approached ! I knew that she had once or twice spoken strangely to you , and I dreaded lest her wandering , incoherent words might yet take in time a recognisable direction , a palpable shape . They did not ; the instinct of terror bound her tongue to the last . Perhaps , even if she had spoken plainly , you would not have believed her ; you would have been still true to yourself and to your confidence in Margaret . Enemy as I am to you , enemy as I will be to the day of your death , I will do you justice for the past : - Your love for that girl was a love which even the purest and best of women could never have thoroughly deserved .
99617	99714	101002	101002	I	0	" My letter is nearly done : my retrospect is finished . I have brought it down to the date of events , about which you know as much as I do . Accident conducted you to a discovery which , otherwise , you might not have made , perhaps for months , perhaps not at all , until I had led you to it of my own accord . I say accident , positively ; knowing that from first to last I trusted no third person . What you know , you knew by accident alone .
99715	99827	101002	101002	I	0	" But for that chance discovery , you would have seen me bring her back to North Villa at the appointed time , in my care , just as she went out . I had no dread of her meeting you . But enough of her ! I shall dispose of her future , as I had resolved to dispose of it years ago ; careless how she may be affected when she first sees the hideous alteration which your attack has wrought in me . Enough , I say , of the Sherwins - father , mother , and daughter - your destiny lies not with them , but with me .
99828	99968	101002	101002	I	0	" Do you still exult in having deformed me in every feature , in having given me a face to revolt every human being who looks at me ? Do you triumph in the remembrance of this atrocity , as you triumphed in the acting of it - believing that you had destroyed my future with Margaret , in destroying my very identity as a man ? I tell you , that with the hour when I leave this hospital your day of triumph will be over , and your day of expiation will begin - never to end till the death of one of us . You shall live - refined educated gentleman as you are - to wish , like a ruffian , that you had killed me ; and your father shall live to wish it too .
99969	100246	101002	101002	I	0	" Am I trying to awe you with the fierce words of a boaster and a bully ? Test me , by looking back a little , and discovering what I have abstained from for the sake of my purpose , since I have been here . A word or two from my lips , in answer to the questions with which I have been baited , day after day , by those about me , would have called you before a magistrate to answer for an assault - a shocking and a savage assault , even in this country , where hand to hand brutality is a marketable commodity between the Prisoner and the Law . Your father 's name might have been publicly coupled with your dishonour , if I had but spoken ; and I was silent . I kept the secret - kept it , because to avenge myself on you by a paltry scandal , which you and your family opposing to it wealth , position , previous character , and general sympathy would live down in a few days , was not my revenge : because to be righted before magistrates and judges by a beggarman 's exhibition of physical injury , and a coward 's confession of physical defeat , was not my way of righting myself . I have a lifelong retaliation in view , which laws and lawgivers are powerless either to aid or to oppose - the retaliation which set a mark upon Cain as I will set a mark on you ; and then made his life his punishment as I will make your life yours .
100247	100537	101002	101002	I	0	" How ? Remember what my career has been ; and know that I will make your career like it . As my father 's death by the hangman affected my existence , so the events of that night when you followed me shall affect yours . Your father shall see you living the life to which his evidence against my father condemned me - shall see the foul stain of your disaster clinging to you wherever you go . The infamy with which I am determined to pursue you , shall be your own infamy that you can not get quit of - for you shall never get quit of me , never get quit of the wife who has dishonoured you . You may leave your home , and leave England ; you may make new friends , and seek new employments ; years and years may pass away - and still , you shall not escape us : still , you shall never know when we are near , or when we are distant ; when we are ready to appear before you , or when we are sure to keep out of your sight . My deformed face and her fatal beauty shall hunt you through the world . The terrible secret of your dishonour , and of the atrocity by which you avenged it , shall ooze out through strange channels , in vague shapes , by tortuous intangible processes ; ever changing in the manner of its exposure , never remediable by your own resistance , and always directed to the same end - your isolation as a marked man , in every fresh sphere , among every new community to which you retreat .
100538	100820	101002	101002	I	0	" Do you call this a very madness of malignity and revenge ? It is the only occupation in life for which your mutilation of me has left me fit ; and I accept it , as work worthy of my deformity . In the prospect of watching how you bear this hunting through life , that never quite hunts you down ; how long you resist the poison - influence , as slow as it is sure , of a crafty tongue that can not be silenced , of a denouncing presence that can not be fled , of a damning secret torn from you and exposed afresh each time you have hidden it - there is the promise of a nameless delight which it sometimes fevers , sometimes chills my blood to think of . Lying in this place at night , in those hours of darkness and stillness when the surrounding atmosphere of human misery presses heavy on me in my heavy sleep , prophecies of dread things to come between us , trouble my spirit in dreams . At those times , I know , and shudder in knowing , that there is something besides the motive of retaliation , something less earthly and apparent than that , which urges me horribly and supernaturally to link myself to you for life ; which makes me feel as the bearer of a curse that shall follow you ; as the instrument of a fatality pronounced against you long ere we met - a fatality beginning before our fathers were parted by the hangman ; perpetuating itself in you and me ; ending who shall say how , or when ?
100821	100954	101002	101002	I	0	" Beware of comforting yourself with a false security , by despising my words , as the wild words of a madman , dreaming of the perpetration of impossible crimes . Throughout this letter I have warned you of what you may expect ; because I will not assail you at disadvantage , as you assailed me ; because it is my pleasure to ruin you , openly resisting me at every step . I have given you fair play , as the huntsmen give fair play at starting to the animal they are about to run down . Be warned against seeking a false hope in the belief that my faculties are shaken , and that my resolves are visionary - false , because such a hope is only despair in disguise .
100955	100985	101002	101002	I	0	" I have done . The time is not far distant when my words will become deeds . They cure fast in a public hospital : we shall meet soon !

I have promised Clara to pull you through this wretched mess ; and I 'll do it . Get a chair , and give me a light . I 'm going to sit on your bed , smoke a cigar , and have a long talk with you . "

102782	102801	102802	102802	he	1388	" first of all , about my coming back . The fact is , the morganatic Mrs. Ralph - "
102808	102992	102802	102802	he	1388	" wanted to see England , and I was tired of being abroad . So I brought her back with me ; and we 're going to live quietly , somewhere in the Brompton neighbourhood . That woman has been my salvation - you must come and see her . She has broke me of gaming altogether ; I was going to the devil as fast as I could , when she stopped me - but you know all about it , of course . Well : we got to London yesterday afternoon ; and in the evening I left her at the hotel , and went to report myself at home . There , the first thing I heard , was that you had cut me out of my old original distinction of being the family scamp . Do n't look distressed , Basil ; I 'm not laughing at you ; I 've come to do something better than that . Never mind my talk : nothing in the world ever was serious to me , and nothing ever will be .

103015	103242	102993	102993	He	2342	" It has been my ill - luck to see my father pretty seriously offended on more than one occasion ; but I never saw him so very quiet and so very dangerous as last night when he was telling me about you . I remember well enough how he spoke and looked , when he caught me putting away my trout - flies in the pages of that family history of his ; but it was nothing to see him or hear him then , to what it is now . I can tell you this , Basil - if I believed in what the poetical people call a broken heart which I do n't , I should be almost afraid that he was broken - hearted . I saw it was no use to say a word for you just yet , so I sat quiet and listened to him till I got my dismissal for the evening . My next proceeding was to go up - stairs , and see Clara . Upstairs , I give you my word of honour , it was worse still . Clara was walking about the room with your letter in her hand - just reach me the matches : my cigar 's out . Some men can talk and smoke in equal proportions - I never could .
103243	103252	103253	103253	he	2343	" You know as well as I do , "
103262	103486	103253	103253	he	2343	" that Clara is not usually demonstrative . I always thought her rather a cold temperament - but the moment I put my head in at the door , I found I 'd been just as great a fool on that point as on most others . Basil , the scream Clara gave when she first saw me , and the look in her eyes when she talked about you , positively frightened me . I ca n't describe anything ; and I hate descriptions by other men most likely on that very account : so I wo n't describe what she said and did . I 'll only tell you that it ended in my promising to come here the first thing this morning ; promising to get you out of the scrape ; promising , in short , everything she asked me . So here I am , ready for your business before my own . The fair partner of my existence is at the hotel , half - frantic because I wo n't go lodging - hunting with her ; but Clara is paramount , Clara is the first thought . Somebody must be a good boy at home ; and now you have resigned , I 'm going to try and succeed you , by way of a change ! "
103487	103533	102993	102993	He	2342	" Ralph ! Ralph ! can you mention Clara 's name , and that woman 's name , in the same breath ? Did you leave Clara quieter and better ! For God 's sake be serious about that , though serious about nothing else ! "
103534	103766	103253	103253	he	2343	" Gently , Basil ! Doucement mon ami ! I did leave her quieter : my promise made her look almost like herself again . As for what you say about mentioning Clara and Mrs. Ralph in the same breath , I 've been talking and smoking till I have no second breaths left to devote to second - rate virtue . There is an unanswerable reason for you , if you want one ! And now let us get to the business that brings me here . I do n't want to worry you by raking up this miserable mess again , from beginning to end , in your presence ; but I must make sure at the same time that I have got hold of the right story , or I ca n't be of any use to you . My father was a little obscure on certain points . He talked enough , and more than enough , about consequences to the family , about his own affliction , about his giving you up for ever ; and , in short , about everything but the case itself as it really stands against us . Now that is just what I ought to be put up to , and must be put up to . Let me tell you in three words what I was told last night . "
103767	103778	102993	102993	He	2342	" Go on , Ralph : speak as you please . "
103779	104084	103253	103253	he	2343	" Very good . First of all , I understand that you took a fancy to some shopkeeper 's daughter - so far , mind , I do n't blame you : I 've spent time very pleasantly among the ladies of the counter myself . But in the second place , I 'm told that you actually married the girl ! I do n't wish to be hard upon you , my good fellow , but there was an unparalleled insanity about that act , worthier of a patient in Bedlam than of my brother . I am not quite sure whether I understand exactly what virtuous behaviour is ; but if that was virtuous behaviour - there ! there ! do n't look shocked . Let 's have done with the marriage , and get on . Well , you made the girl your wife ; and then innocently consented to a very queer condition of waiting a year for her virtuous behaviour again , I suppose ! At the end of that time - do n't turn away your head , Basil ! I may be a scamp ; but I am not blackguard enough to make a joke - either in your presence , or out of it - of this part of the story . I will pass it over altogether , if you like ; and only ask you a question or two . You see , my father either could not or would not speak plainly of the worst part of the business ; and you know him well enough to know why . But somebody must be a little explicit , or I can do nothing . About that man ? You found the scoundrel out ? Did you get within arm 's length of him ? "
104149	104187	104125	104125	He	154	" Shake hands , Basil ! Shake hands , as we have n't shaken hands yet : this makes amends for everything ! One word more , though , about that fellow ; where is he now ? "
104188	104193	104207	104207	Mannion	73	" In the hospital . "
104219	104228	104230	104231	my brother	154	" The next question is about the girl , "
104233	104250	104230	104231	my brother	154	" What has become of her ? Where was she all the time of your illness ? "
104251	104263	104125	104125	He	154	" At her father 's house ; she is there still . "
104264	104339	104230	104231	my brother	154	" Ah , yes ! I see ; the old story ; innocent , of course . And her father backs her , does n't he ? To be sure , that 's the old story too . I have got at our difficulty now ; we are threatened with an exposure , if you do n't acknowledge her . Wait a minute ! Have you any evidence against her , besides your own ? "
104340	104362	104125	104125	He	154	" I have a letter , a long letter from her accomplice , containing a confession of his guilt and hers . "
104363	104480	104230	104231	my brother	154	" She is sure to call that confession a conspiracy . It 's of no use to us , unless we dared to go to law - and we dare n't . We must hush the thing up at any price ; or it will be the death of my father . This is a case for money , just as I thought it would be . Mr. and Miss Shopkeeper have got a large assortment of silence to sell ; and we must buy it of them , over the domestic counter , at so much a yard . Have you been there yet , Basil , to ask the price and strike the bargain ? "
104481	104490	104125	104125	He	154	" I was at the house , yesterday . "
104491	104522	104230	104231	my brother	154	" The deuce you were ! And who did you see ? - The father ? Did you bring him to terms ? did you do business with Mr. Shopkeeper ? "
104523	104539	104125	104125	He	154	" His manner was brutal : his language , the language of a bully - ? "
104540	104579	104230	104231	my brother	154	" So much the better . Those men are easiest dealt with : if he will only fly into a passion with me , I engage for success beforehand . But the end - how did it end ? "
104580	104597	104125	104125	He	154	" As it began : - in threats on his part , in endurance on mine . "
104598	104640	104230	104231	my brother	154	" Ah ! we 'll see how he likes my endurance next : he 'll find it rather a different sort of endurance from yours . By - the - bye , Basil , what money had you to offer him ? "
104641	104717	104125	104125	He	154	" I made no offer to him then . Circumstances happened which rendered me incapable of thinking of it . I intended to go there again , to - day ; and if money would bribe him to silence , and save my family from sharing the dishonour which has fallen on me , to abandon to him the only money I have of my own - the little income left me by our mother . "
104718	104814	104230	104231	my brother	154	" Do you mean to say that your only resource is in that wretched trifle , and that you ever really intend to let it go , and start in the world without a rap ? Do you mean to say that my father gave you up without making the smallest provision for you , in such a mess as your 's ? Hang it ! do him justice . He has been hard enough on you , I know ; but he ca n't have coolly turned you over to ruin in that way . "
104815	104934	104125	104125	He	154	" He offered me money , at parting ; but with such words of contempt and insult that I would have died rather than take it . I told him that , unaided by his purse , I would preserve him , and preserve his family from the infamous consequences of my calamity - though I sacrificed my own happiness and my own honour for ever in doing it . And I go to - day to make that sacrifice . The loss of the little I have to depend on , is the least part of it . He may not see his injustice in doubting me , till too late ; but he shall see it . "
104935	105207	104230	104231	my brother	154	" I beg your pardon , Basil ; but this is almost as great an insanity , as the insanity of your marriage . I honour the independence of your principle , my dear fellow ; but , while I am to the fore , I 'll take good care that you do n't ruin yourself gratuitously , for the sake of any principles whatever ! Just listen to me , now . In the first place , remember that what my father said to you , he said in a moment of violent exasperation . You had been trampling the pride of his life in the mud : no man likes that - my father least of any . And , as for the offer of your poor little morsel of an income to stop these people 's greedy mouths , it is n't a quarter enough for them . They know our family is a wealthy family ; and they will make their demand accordingly . Any other sacrifice , even to taking the girl back though you never could bring yourself to do that ! , would be of no earthly use . Nothing but money will do ; money cunningly doled out , under the strongest possible stipulations . Now , I 'm just the man to do that , and I have got the money - or , rather , my father has , which comes to the same thing . Write me the fellow 's name and address ; there 's no time to be lost - I 'm off to see him at once ! "
105208	105230	105447	105447	He	2347	" I ca n't allow you , Ralph , to ask my father for what I would not ask him myself - "
105231	105446	104230	104231	my brother	154	" Give me the name and address , or you will sour my excellent temper for the rest of my life . Your obstinacy wo n't do with me , Basil - it did n't at school , and it wo n't now . I shall ask my father for money for myself ; and use as much of it as I think proper for your interests . He 'll give me anything I want , now I have turned good boy . I do n't owe fifty pounds , since my last debts were paid off - thanks to Mrs. Ralph , who is the most managing woman in the world . By - the - bye , when you see her , do n't seem surprised at her being older than I am . Oh ! this is the address , is it ? Hollyoake Square ? Where the devil 's that ! Never mind , I 'll take a cab , and shift the responsibility of finding the place on the driver . Keep up your spirits , and wait here till I come back . You shall have such news of Mr. Shopkeeper and his daughter as you little expect ! Au revoir , my dear fellow - au revoir . "
106039	106042	106043	106043	she	296	" Basil ! "
106051	106057	106043	106043	she	296	" has Ralph been here ? "
106058	106065	106043	106043	she	296	" Yes , love - yes . "
106066	106083	106043	106043	she	296	" Where has he gone ? what has he done for you ? He promised me - "
106084	106102	106043	106043	she	296	" And he has kept his promise nobly , Clara : he is away helping me now . "
106103	106110	106043	106043	she	296	" Thank God ! thank God ! "
106166	106173	106174	106174	she	296	" I shall be better directly , "
106186	106320	106174	106174	she	296	" but , seeing you in this strange place , after what happened yesterday ; and having come here so secretly , in terror of my father finding it out - I ca n't help feeling your altered position and mine a little painfully at first . But we wo n't complain , as long as I can get here sometimes to see you : we will only think of the future now . What a mercy , what a happiness it is that Ralph has come back ! We have always done him injustice ; he is far kinder and far better than we ever thought him . But , Basil , how worn and ill you are looking ! Have you not told Ralph everything ? Are you in any danger ? "
106321	106330	106174	106174	she	296	" None , Clara - none , indeed ! "
106331	106442	106174	106174	she	296	" Do n't grieve too deeply about yesterday ! Try and forget that horrible parting , and all that brought it about . He has not spoken of it since , except to tell me that I must never know more of your fault and your misfortune , than the little - the very little - I know already . And I have resolved not to think about it , as well as not to ask about it , for the future . I have a hope already , Basil - very , very far off fulfilment - but still a hope . Can you not think what it is ? "
106443	106463	106174	106174	she	296	" Your hope is far off fulfilment , indeed , Clara , if it is hope from my father ! "
106464	106511	106174	106174	she	296	" Hush ! do n't say so ; I know better . Something occurred , even so soon as last night - a very trifling event - but enough to show that he thinks of you , already , in grief far more than in anger . "
106512	106528	106174	106174	she	296	" I wish I could believe it , love ; but my remembrance of yesterday - "
106529	106960	106174	106174	she	296	" Do n't trust that remembrance ; do n't recall it ! I will tell you what occurred . Some time after you had gone , and after I had recovered myself a little in my own room , I went downstairs again to see my father ; for I was too terrified and too miserable at what had happened , to be alone . He was not in his room when I got there . As I looked round me for a moment , I saw the pieces of your page in the book about our family , scattered on the floor ; and the miniature likeness of you , when you were a child , was lying among the other fragments . It had been torn out of its setting in the paper , but not injured . I picked it up , Basil , and put it on the table , at the place where he always sits ; and laid my own little locket , with your hair in it , by the side , so that he might know that the miniature had not been accidentally taken up and put there by the servant . Then , I gathered together the pieces of the page and took them away with me , thinking it better that he should not see them again . Just as I had got through the door that leads into the library , and was about to close it , I heard the other door , by which you enter the study from the hall , opening ; and he came in , and went directly to the table . His back was towards me , so I could look at him unperceived . He observed the miniature directly and stood quite still with it in his hand ; then sighed - sighed so bitterly ! - and then took the portrait of our dear mother from one of the drawers of the table , opened the case in which it is kept , and put your miniature inside , very gently and tenderly . I could not trust myself to see any more , so I went up to my room again : and shortly afterwards he came in with my locket , and gave it me back , only saying - ' You left this on my table , Clara . ' But if you had seen his face then , you would have hoped all things from him in the time to come , as I hope now . "
106961	106982	106174	106174	she	296	" And as I will hope , Clara , though it be from no stronger motive than gratitude to you . "
106983	106989	106990	106990	she	2359	" Before I left home , "
106999	107101	106990	106990	she	2359	" I thought of your loneliness in this strange place - knowing that I could seldom come to see you , and then only by stealth ; by committing a fault which , if my father found it out - but we wo n't speak of that ! I thought of your lonely hours here ; and I have brought with me an old , forgotten companion of yours , to bear you company , and to keep you from thinking too constantly on what you have suffered . Look , Basil ! wo n't you welcome this old friend again ? "
107220	107245	107247	107247	Clara	57	" I took more care of those leaves of writing , after you had thrown them aside , than of anything else I had , "
107249	107358	107247	107247	Clara	57	" I always thought the time would come , when you would return again to the occupation which it was once your greatest pleasure to pursue , and my greatest pleasure to watch . And surely that time has arrived . I am certain , Basil , your book will help you to wait patiently for happier times , as nothing else can . This place must seem very strange and lonely ; but the sight of those pages , and the sight of me sometimes when I can come , may make it look almost like home to you ! The room is not - not very - "
107485	107490	107491	107491	she	57	" I must go , "
107494	107648	107491	107491	she	57	" it is later than I thought . Do n't be afraid about my getting home : old Martha came here with me , and is waiting downstairs to go back you know we can trust her . Write to me as often as you can ; I shall hear about you every day , from Ralph ; but I should like a letter sometimes , as well . Be as hopeful and as patient yourself , dear , under misfortune , as you wish me to be ; and I shall despair of nothing . Do n't tell Ralph I have been here - he might be angry . I will come again , the first opportunity . Good - bye , Basil ! Let us try and part happily , in the hope of better days . Good - bye , dear - good - bye , only for the present ! "
107791	107795	107796	107796	he	2367	" All right ! "
107809	107862	107796	107796	he	2367	" We can buy Mr. Shopkeeper for anything we like - for nothing at all , if we choose to be stingy . His innocent daughter has made the best of all confessions , just at the right time . Basil , my boy , she has left her father 's house ! "
107863	107869	107768	107768	him	2367	" What do you mean ? "
107870	107878	107796	107796	he	2367	" She has eloped to the hospital ! "
107879	107882	107768	107768	him	2367	" Mannion ! "
107883	107950	107796	107796	he	2367	" Yes , Mannion : I have got his letter to her . She is criminated by it , even past her father 's contradiction - and he does n't stick at a trifle ! But I 'll begin at the beginning , and tell you everything . Hang it , Basil , you look as if I 'd brought you bad news instead of good ! "
107951	107964	107768	107768	him	2367	" Never mind how I look , Ralph - pray go on ! "
107965	108137	107796	107796	he	2367	" Well : the first thing I heard , on getting to the house , was that Sherwin 's wife was dying . The servant took in my name : but I thought of course I should n't be admitted . No such thing ! I was let in at once , and the first words this fellow , Sherwin , said to me , were , that his wife was only ill , that the servants were exaggerating , and that he was quite ready to hear what Mr. Basil 's ' highly - respected ' brother fancy calling me ' highly - respected ! ' had to say to him . The fool , however , as you see , was cunning enough to try civility to begin with . A more ill - looking human mongrel I never set eyes on ! I took the measure of my man directly , and in two minutes told him exactly what I came for , without softening a single word . "
108138	108146	107768	107768	him	2367	" And how did he answer you ? "
108147	108403	107796	107796	he	2367	" As I anticipated , by beginning to bluster immediately . I took him down , just as he swore his second oath . ' Sir , ' I said very politely , ' if you mean to make a cursing and a swearing conference of this , I think it only fair to inform you before - hand that you are likely to get the worst of it . When the whole collection of British oaths is exhausted , I can swear fluently in five foreign languages : I have always made it a principle to pay back abuse at compound interest , and I do n't exaggerate in saying , that I am quite capable of swearing you out of your senses , if you persist in setting me the example . And now , if you like to go on , pray do - I 'm ready to hear you . ' While I was speaking , he stared at me in a state of helpless astonishment ; when I had done , he began to bluster again - but it was a pompous , dignified , parliamentary sort of bluster , now , ending in his pulling your unlucky marriage - certificate out of his pocket , asserting for the fiftieth time , that the girl was innocent , and declaring that he 'd make you acknowledge her , if he went before a magistrate to do it . That 's what he said when you saw him , I suppose ? "
108404	108412	107768	107768	him	2367	" Yes : almost word for word . "
108413	108791	107796	107796	he	2367	" I had my answer ready for him , before he could put the certificate back in his pocket . ' Now , Mr. Sherwin , ' I said , ' have the goodness to listen to me . My father has certain family prejudices and nervous delicacies , which I do not inherit from him , and which I mean to take good care to prevent you from working on . At the same time , I beg you to understand that I have come here without his knowledge . I am not my father 's ambassador , but my brother 's - who is unfit to deal with you , himself ; because he is not half hard - hearted , or half worldly enough . As my brother 's envoy , therefore , and out of consideration for my father 's peculiar feelings , I now offer you , from my own resources , a certain annual sum of money , far more than sufficient for all your daughter 's expenses - a sum payable quarterly , on condition that neither you nor she shall molest us ; that you shall never make use of our name anywhere ; and that the fact of my brother 's marriage hitherto preserved a secret shall for the future be consigned to oblivion . We keep our opinion of your daughter 's guilt - you keep your opinion of her innocence . We have silence to buy , and you have silence to sell , once a quarter ; and if either of us break our conditions , we both have our remedy - your 's the easy remedy , our 's the difficult . This arrangement - a very unfair and dangerous for us ; a very advantageous and safe one for you - I understand that you finally refuse ? ' ' Sir , ' says he , solemnly , ' I should be unworthy the name of a father - ' ' Thank you ' - I remarked , feeling that he was falling back on paternal sentiment - ' thank you ; I quite understand . We will get on , if you please , to the reverse side of the question . ' "
108792	108810	107768	107768	him	2367	" The reverse side ! What reverse side , Ralph ? What could you possibly say more ? "
108811	109129	107796	107796	he	2367	" You shall hear . ' Being , on your part , thoroughly determined , ' I said , ' to permit no compromise , and to make my brother his family of course included acknowledge a woman , of whose guilt they entertain not the slightest doubt , you think you can gain your object by threatening an exposure . Do n't threaten any more ! Make your exposure ! Go to the magistrate at once , if you like ! Gibbet our names in the newspaper report , as a family connected by marriage with Mr. Sherwin the linen - draper 's daughter , whom they believe to have disgraced herself as a woman and a wife for ever . Do your very worst ; make public every shameful particular that you can - what advantage will you get by it ? Revenge , I grant you . But will revenge put a halfpenny into your pocket ? Will revenge pay a farthing towards your daughter 's keep ? Will revenge make us receive her ? Not a bit of it ! We shall be driven into a corner ; we shall have no exposure to dread after you have exposed us ; we shall have no remedy left , but a desperate remedy , and we 'll go to law - boldly , openly go to law , and get a divorce . We have written evidence , which you know nothing about , and can call testimony which you can not gag . I am no lawyer , but I 'll bet you five hundred to one quite in a friendly way , my dear Sir ! that we get our case . What follows ? We send you back your daughter , without a shred of character left to cover her ; and we comfortably wash our hands of you altogether . ' "
109130	109139	107768	107768	him	2367	" Ralph ! Ralph ! how could you - "
109140	109436	107796	107796	he	2367	" Stop ! hear the end of it . Of course I knew that we could n't carry out this divorce - threat , without its being the death of my father ; but I thought a little quiet bullying on my part might do Mr. Shopkeeper Sherwin some good . And I was right . You never saw a man sit sorer on the sharp edges of a dilemma than he did . I stuck to my point in spite of everything ; silence and money , or exposure and divorce - just which he pleased . ' I deny every one of your infamous imputations , ' said he . ' That 's not the question , ' said I. ' I 'll go to your father , ' said he . ' You wo n't be let in , ' said I. ' I 'll write to him , ' said he . ' He wo n't receive your letter , ' said I. There we came to a pull - up . He began to stammer , and I refreshed myself with a pinch of snuff . Finding it would n't do , he threw off the Roman at last , and resumed the Tradesman . ' Even supposing I consented to this abominable compromise , what is to become of my daughter ? ' he asked . ' Just what becomes of other people who have comfortable annuities to live on , ' I answered . ' Affection for my deeply - wronged child half inclines me to consult her wishes , before we settle anything - I 'll go up - stairs , ' said he . ' And I 'll wait for you down here , ' said I. "
109437	109444	107768	107768	him	2367	" Did he object to that ? "
109445	109637	107796	107796	he	2367	" Not he . He went up - stairs , and in a few minutes ran down again , with an open letter in his hand , looking as if the devil was after him before his time . At the last three or four stairs , he tripped , caught at the bannisters , dropped the letter over them in doing so , tumbled into the passage in such a fury and fright that he looked like a madman , tore his hat off a peg , and rushed out . I just heard him say his daughter should come back , if he put a straight waistcoat on her , as he passed the door . Between his tumble , his passion , and his hurry , he never thought of coming back for the letter he had dropped over the bannisters . I picked it up before I went away , suspecting it might be good evidence on our side ; and I was right . Read it yourself ; Basil ; you have every moral and legal claim on the precious document - and here it is . "
109658	109800	107768	107768	him	2367	" I have received your last note , and can not wonder that you are getting impatient under restraint . But , remember , that if you had not acted as I warned you beforehand to act in case of accidents - if you had not protested innocence to your father , and preserved total silence towards your mother ; if you had not kept in close retirement , behaving like a domestic martyr , and avoiding , in your character of a victim , all voluntary mention of your husband 's name - your position might have been a very awkward one . Not being able to help you , the only thing I could do was to teach you how to help yourself . I gave you the lesson , and you have been wise enough to profit by it .
109801	110019	110076	110076	he	2372	" The time has now come for a change in my plans . I have suffered a relapse ; and the date of my discharge from this place is still uncertain . I doubt the security , both on your account , and on mine , of still leaving you at your father 's house , to await my cure . Come to me here , therefore , to - morrow , at any hour when you can get away unperceived . You will be let in as a visitor , and shown to my bedside , if you ask for Mr. Turner - the name I have given to the hospital authorities . Through the help of a friend outside these walls , I have arranged for a lodging in which you can live undiscovered , until I am discharged and can join you . You can come here twice a week , if you like , and you had better do so , to accustom yourself to the sight of my injuries . I told you in my first letter how and where they had been inflicted - when you see them with your own eyes , you will be best prepared to hear what my future purposes are , and how you can aid them .
110020	110023	107768	107768	him	2367	" R. M. "
110072	110075	110076	110076	he	2372	" No , "
110079	110177	110076	110076	he	2372	" Sherwin dropped the letter just in the state in which I have given it to you . I suspect the girl took away the envelope with her , thinking that the letter which she left behind her was inside . But the loss of the envelope does n't matter . Look there : the fellow has written her name at the bottom of the leaf ; as coolly as if it was an ordinary correspondence . She is identified with the letter , and that 's all we want in our future dealings with her father . "
110178	110187	110055	110055	I	0	" But , Ralph , do you think - "
110188	110357	110076	110076	he	2372	" Do I think her father will get her back ? If he 's in time to catch her at the hospital , he assuredly will . If not , we shall have some little trouble on our side , I suspect . This seems to me to be how the matter stands now , Basil : - After that letter , and her running away , Sherwin will have nothing for it but to hold his tongue about her innocence ; we may consider him as settled and done with . As for the other rascal , Mannion , he certainly writes as if he meant to do something dangerous . If he really does attempt to annoy us , we will mark him again I 'll do it next time , by way of a little change ! ; he has no marriage certificate to shake over our heads , at any rate . What 's the matter now ? - you 're looking pale again . "
110524	110530	110531	110531	he	2373	" I suppose , Basil , "
110534	110571	110531	110531	he	2373	" the truth is , that you ca n't help being a little shocked - though you could expect nothing better from the girl - at her boldly following this fellow Mannion , even to the hospital "
110593	110741	110572	110572	Ralph	39	" Setting that aside , however , we are quite ready , I take it , to let her stick to her choice , and live just as she pleases , so long as she does n't live under our name . There is the great fear and great difficulty now ! If Sherwin ca n't find her , we must ; otherwise , we can never feel certain that she is not incurring all sorts of debts as your wife . If her father gets her back , I shall be able to bring her to terms at North Villa ; if not , I must get speech of her , wherever she happens to be hidden . She 's the only thorn in our side now , and we must pull her out with gold pincers immediately . Do n't you see that , Basil ? "
110742	110749	110531	110531	he	2373	" I see it , Ralph ! "
110750	111098	110572	110572	Ralph	39	" Very well . Either to - night or to - morrow morning , I 'll communicate with Sherwin , and find out whether he has laid hands on her . If he has n't , we must go to the hospital , and see what we can discover for ourselves . Do n't look miserable and downhearted , Basil , I 'll go with you : you need n't see her again , or the man either ; but you must come with me , for I may be obliged to make use of you . And now , I 'm off for to - day , in good earnest . I must get back to Mrs. Ralph unfortunately she happens to be one of the most sensitive women in the world , or she will be sending to advertise me in the newspapers . We shall pull through this , my dear fellow - you will see we shall ! By the bye , you do n't know of a nice little detached house in the Brompton neighbourhood , do you ? Most of my old theatrical friends live about there - a detached house , mind ! The fact is , I have taken to the violin lately I wonder what I shall take to next ? ; Mrs. Ralph accompanies me on the pianoforte ; and we might be an execrable nuisance to very near neighbours - that 's all ! You do n't know of a house ? Never mind ; I can go to an agent , or something of that sort . Clara shall know to - night that we are moving prosperously , if I can only give the worthiest creature in the world the slip : she 's a little obstinate , but , I assure you , a really superior woman . Only think of my dropping down to playing the fiddle , and paying rent and taxes in a suburban villa ! How are the fast men fallen ! Good bye , Basil , good bye ! "
111532	111552	111529	111529	Ralph	39	" Bernard ! Jack Bernard ! Have you come to England , of all the men in the world ! "
111553	111557	111506	111507	a gentleman	3111	" Why not ? "
111562	111656	111529	111529	Ralph	39	" I got every surgical testimonial the Hotel Dieu could give me , six months ago ; and could n't afford to stay in Paris only for my pleasure . Do you remember calling me a ' mute , inglorious Liston , ' long ago , when we last met ? Well , I have come to England to soar out of my obscurity and blaze into a shining light of the profession . Plenty of practice at the hospital , here - very little anywhere else , I am sorry to say . "
111657	111669	111529	111529	Ralph	39	" You do n't mean that you belong to this hospital ? "
111670	111691	111529	111529	Ralph	39	" My dear fellow , I am regularly on the staff ; I 'm here every day of my life . "
111692	111791	111529	111529	Ralph	39	" You 're the very man to enlighten us . Here , Basil , cross over , and let me introduce you to an old Paris friend of mine . Mr. Bernard - my brother . You 've often heard me talk , Basil , of a younger son of old Sir William Bernard 's , who preferred a cure of bodies to a cure of souls ; and actually insisted on working in a hospital when he might have idled in a family living . This is the man - the best of doctors and good fellows . "
111792	111807	111809	111810	Mr. Bernard	84	" Are you bringing your brother to the hospital to follow my mad example ? "
111819	111858	111859	111859	He	84	" Not exactly , Jack ! But we really have an object in coming here . Can you give us ten minutes ' talk , somewhere in private ? We want to know about one of your patients . "
111876	111884	111886	111886	Ralph	39	" Leave the matter in my hands , "
111895	111902	111886	111886	Ralph	39	" I 'll find out everything . "
111903	111908	111909	111909	he	84	" Now , Bernard , "
111912	111925	111909	111909	he	84	" you have a man here , who calls himself Mr. Turner ? "
111926	111993	111886	111886	Ralph	39	" Are you a friend of that mysterious patient ? Wonderful ! The students call him ' The Great Mystery of London ; ' and I begin to think the students are right . Do you want to see him ? When he has not got his green shade on , he 's rather a startling sight , I can tell you , for unprofessional eyes . "
111994	112056	111909	111909	he	84	" No , no - at least , not at present ; my brother here , not at all . The fact is , certain circumstances have happened which oblige us to look after this man ; and which I am sure you wo n't inquire into , when I tell you that it is our interest to keep them secret . "
112057	112061	111886	111886	Ralph	39	" Certainly not ! "
112062	112111	111909	111909	he	84	" Then , without any more words about it , our object here , to - day , is to find out everything we can about Mr. Turner , and the people who have been to see him . Did a woman come , the day before yesterday ? "
112112	112211	111886	111886	Ralph	39	" Yes ; and behaved rather oddly , I believe . I was not here when she came , but was told she asked for Turner , in a very agitated manner . She was directed to the Victoria Ward , where he is ; and when she got there , looked excessively flurried and excited - seeing the Ward quite full , and , perhaps , not being used to hospitals . However it was , though the nurse pointed out the right bed to her , she ran in a mighty hurry to the wrong one . "
112212	112216	112218	112218	Ralph	39	" I understand , "
112220	112240	112218	112218	Ralph	39	" just as some women run into the wrong omnibus , when the right one is straight before them . "
112241	112432	111886	111886	Ralph	39	" Exactly . Well , she only discovered her mistake the room being rather dark , after she had stooped down close over the stranger , who was lying with his head away from her . By that time , the nurse was at her side , and led her to the right bed . There , I 'm told , another scene happened . At sight of the patient 's face , which is very frightfully disfigured , she was on the point as the nurse thought of going into a fit ; but Turner stopped her in an instant . He just laid his hand on her arm , and whispered something to her ; and , though she turned as pale as ashes , she was quiet directly . The next thing they say he did , was to give her a slip of paper , coolly directing her to go to the address written on it , and to come back to the hospital again , as soon as she could show a little more resolution . She went away at once - nobody knows where . "
112433	112439	112218	112218	Ralph	39	" Has nobody asked where ? "
112440	112578	111886	111886	Ralph	39	" Yes ; a fellow who said he was her father , and who behaved like a madman . He came here about an hour after she had left , and would n't believe that we knew nothing about her how the deuce should we know anything ! He threatened Turner whom , by the bye , he called Manning , or some such name in such an outrageous manner , that we were obliged to refuse him admission . Turner himself will give no information on the subject ; but I suspect that his injuries are the result of a quarrel with the father about the daughter - a pretty savage quarrel , I must say , looking to the consequences - I beg your pardon , but your brother seems ill ! I 'm afraid , "
112583	112591	111886	111886	Ralph	39	" you find the room rather close ? "
112592	112615	112218	112218	Ralph	39	" No , indeed ; not at all . I have just recovered from a serious illness - but pray go on . "
112616	112721	111886	111886	Ralph	39	" I have very little more to say . The father went away in a fury , just as he came ; the daughter has not yet made her appearance a second time . But , after what was reported to me of the first interview , I daresay she will come . She must , if she wants to see Turner ; he wo n't be out , I suspect , for another fortnight . He has been making himself worse by perpetually writing letters ; we were rather afraid of erysipelas , but he 'll get over that danger , I think . "
112722	112727	112729	112729	Ralph	39	" About the woman , "
112731	112778	112729	112729	Ralph	39	" it is of the greatest importance that we should know where she is now living . Is there any possibility we will pay well for it of getting some sharp fellow to follow her home from this place , the next time she comes here ? "
112788	112806	112807	112807	he	84	" I think I can manage it for you with the porter , after you are gone , "
112810	112825	112807	112807	he	84	" provided you leave me free to give any remuneration I may think necessary . "
112826	112865	112884	112884	Ralph	39	" Anything in the world , my dear fellow . Have you got pen and ink ? I 'll write down my brother 's address ; you can communicate results to him , as soon as they occur . "
112889	112974	112884	112884	Ralph	39	" If he wrote to my address , Mrs. Ralph might see the letter . She is the most amiable of her sex ; but if written information of a woman 's residence , directed to me , fell into her hands - you understand , Basil ! Besides , it will be easy to let me know , the moment you hear from Jack . Look up , young one ! It 's all right - we are sailing with wind and tide . "
112997	113141	112991	112992	his friend	2410	" I hope you will not suspect me of wishing to intrude on your secrets , if assuming your interest in Turner to be the reverse of a friendly interest I warn you to look sharply after him when he leaves the hospital . Either there has been madness in his family , or his brain has suffered from his external injuries . Legally , he may be quite fit to be at large ; for he will be able to maintain the appearance of perfect self - possession in all the ordinary affairs of life . But , morally , I am convinced that he is a dangerous monomaniac ; his mania being connected with some fixed idea which evidently never leaves him day or night . I would lay a heavy wager that he dies in a prison or a madhouse . "
113142	113169	113171	113171	Ralph	39	" And I 'll lay another wager , if he 's mad enough to annoy us , that we are the people to shut him up , "
113173	113221	113171	113171	Ralph	39	" There is the address . And now , we need n't waste your time any longer . I have taken a little place at Brompton , Jack , - you and Basil must come and dine with me , as soon as the carpets are down . "
113244	113259	113260	113260	he	3111	" That man 's fever in the Victoria Ward has declared itself at last , "
113263	113272	113260	113260	he	3111	" This morning the new symptoms have appeared . "
113273	113280	113233	113234	a gentleman	3111	" And what do they indicate ? "
113281	113303	113260	113260	he	3111	" Typhus of the most malignant character - not a doubt of it . Come up , and look at him . "
113330	113340	113319	113319	his	84	" Victoria Ward ! why you mentioned that - ; "
113367	113402	113359	113359	he	3111	" I want to ask you whether the bed in Victoria Ward , occupied by this man whose fever has turned to typhus , is the same bed , or near the bed which - "
113443	113447	113448	113448	he	84	" My notion , "
113451	113545	113546	113546	he	84	" is , that infection is taken through the lungs ; one breath inhaled from the infected atmosphere hanging immediately around the diseased person , and generally extending about a foot from him , being enough to communicate his malady to the breather - provided there exists , at the time , in the individual exposed to catch the malady , a constitutional predisposition to infection . This predisposition we know to be greatly increased by mental agitation , or bodily weakness ; but , in the case we have been talking of , "
113551	113582	113546	113546	he	84	" the chances of infection or non - infection may be equally balanced . At any rate , I can predict nothing about them at this stage of the discovery . "
113583	113593	113595	113595	Ralph	39	" You will write the moment you hear anything ? "
113602	113618	113546	113546	he	84	" The very moment . I have your brother 's address safe in my pocket . "
114292	114294	114281	114281	I	0	" Private .
114295	114297	114261	114261	My	0	" Friday .
114298	114302	114281	114281	I	0	" My DEAR SIR ,
114303	114358	114261	114261	My	0	" On the enclosed slip of paper you will find the address of the young woman , of whom your brother spoke to me when we met at the hospital . I regret to say , that the circumstances under which I have obtained information of her residence , are of the most melancholy nature .
114359	114582	114281	114281	I	0	" The plan which I arranged for discovering her abode , in accordance with your brother 's suggestion , proved useless . The young woman never came to the hospital a second time . Her address was given to me this morning , by Turner himself ; who begged that I would visit her professionally , as he had no confidence in the medical man who was then in attendance on her . Many circumstances combined to make my compliance with his request anything but easy or desirable ; but knowing that you - or your brother I ought , perhaps , rather to say - were interested in the young woman , I determined to take the very earliest opportunity of seeing her , and consulting with her medical attendant . I could not get to her till late in the afternoon . When I arrived , I found her suffering from one of the worst attacks of Typhus I ever remember to have seen ; and I think it my duty to state candidly , that I believe her life to be in imminent danger . At the same time , it is right to inform you that the gentleman in attendance on her does not share my opinion : he still thinks there is a good chance of saving her .
114583	114774	114261	114261	My	0	" There can be no doubt whatever , that she was infected with Typhus at the hospital . You may remember my telling you , how her agitation appeared to have deprived her of self - possession , when she entered the ward ; and how she ran to the wrong bed , before the nurse could stop her . The man whom she thus mistook for Turner , was suffering from fever which had not then specifically declared itself ; but which did so declare itself , as a Typhus fever , on the morning when you and your brother came to the hospital . This man 's disorder must have been infectious when the young woman stooped down close over him , under the impression that he was the person she had come to see . Although she started back at once , on discovering her mistake , she had breathed the infection into her system - her mental agitation at the time , accompanied as I have since understood by some physical weakness , rendering her specially liable to the danger to which she had accidentally exposed herself .
114775	115045	114281	114281	I	0	" Since the first symptoms of her disease appeared , on Saturday last , I can not find that any error has been committed in the medical treatment , as reported to me . I remained some time by her bedside to - day , observing her . The delirium which is , more or less , an invariable result of Typhus , is particularly marked in her case , and manifests itself both by speech and gesture . It has been found impossible to quiet her , by any means hitherto tried . While I was watching by her , she never ceased calling on your name , and entreating to see you . I am informed by her medical attendant , that her wanderings have almost invariably taken this direction for the last four - and - twenty hours . Occasionally she mixes other names with yours , and mentions them in terms of abhorrence ; but her persistency in calling for your presence , is so remarkable that I am tempted , merely from what I have heard myself ; to suggest that you really should go to her , on the bare chance that you might exercise some tranquillising influence . At the same time , if you fear infection , or for any private reasons into which I have neither the right nor the wish to inquire feel unwilling to take the course I have pointed out , do not by any means consider it your duty to accede to my proposal . I can conscientiously assure you that duty is not involved in it .
115046	115162	114261	114261	My	0	" I have , however , another suggestion to make , which is of a positive nature , and which I am sure will meet with your approval . It is , that her parents , or some of her other relations , if her parents are not alive , should be informed of her situation . Possibly , you may know something of her connections , and can therefore do this good office . She is dying in a strange place , among people who avoid her as they would avoid a pestilence . Even though it be only to bury her , some relation ought to be immediately summoned to her bed - side .
115163	115216	114281	114281	I	0	" I shall visit her twice to - morrow , in the morning and at night . If you are not willing to risk seeing her and I repeat that it is in no sense imperative that you should combat such unwillingness , perhaps you will communicate with me at my private address .
115217	115223	114261	114261	My	0	" I remain , dear Sir ,
115224	115227	114281	114281	I	0	" Faithfully yours ,
115228	115231	114261	114261	My	0	" JOHN BERNARD .
115232	115345	114281	114281	I	0	" P. S. - I open my letter again , to inform you that Turner , acting against all advice , has left the hospital to - day . He attempted to go on Tuesday last , when , I believe , he first received information of the young woman 's serious illness , but was seized with a violent attack of giddiness , on attempting to walk , and fell down just outside the door of the ward . On this second occasion , however , he has succeeded in getting away without any accident - as far , at least , as the persons employed about the hospital can tell . "
115368	115409	115356	115356	I	0	" Have I , to whom the mere thought of ever seeing this woman again has been as a pollution to shrink from , the strength to stand by her death - bed , the courage to see her die ? "
115488	115501	115479	115480	her mother	319	" Oh , who will pray for her when I am gone ! "
115801	115811	115819	115819	her	2444	" I have gone to soothe her last moments . "
116032	116042	116043	116043	she	2463	" Oh ! I suppose you 're another doctor , "
116053	116102	116043	116043	she	2463	" I wish you were the undertaker , to get her out of my house before we all catch our deaths of her ! There ! there 's the other doctor coming down stairs ; he 'll show you the room - I wo n't go near it . "
116124	116135	116136	116136	he	84	" You can do no good , I am afraid , "
116139	116148	116136	116136	he	84	" but I am glad you have come . "
116149	116157	116115	116116	Mr. Bernard	84	" There is no hope , then ? "
116158	116234	116136	116136	he	84	" In my opinion , none . Turner came here this morning , whether she recognised him , or not , in her delirium , I can not say ; but she grew so much worse in his presence , that I insisted on his not seeing her again , except under medical permission . Just now , there is no one in the room - are you willing to go up stairs at once ? "
116235	116246	116115	116116	Mr. Bernard	84	" Does she still speak of me in her wanderings ? "
116247	116255	116136	116136	he	84	" Yes , as incessantly as ever . "
116256	116267	116115	116116	Mr. Bernard	84	" Then I am ready to go to her bedside . "
116268	116299	116301	116301	he	2464	" Pray believe that I feel deeply what a sacrifice you are making . Since I wrote to you , much that she has said in her delirium has told me "
116304	116391	116392	116392	He	2464	" has told me more , I am afraid , than you would wish me to have known , as a comparative stranger to you . I will only say , that secrets unconsciously disclosed on the death - bed are secrets sacred to me , as they are to all who pursue my calling ; and that what I have unavoidably heard above stairs , is doubly sacred in my estimation , as affecting a near and dear relative of one of my oldest friends . "
116405	116444	116392	116392	He	2464	" I am sure you will think yourself rewarded for any trial to your feelings to - night , if you can only remember in years to come , that your presence quieted her in her last moments ! "
116574	116610	116569	116569	her	44	" Basil ! Basil ! Basil ! I 'll never leave off calling for him , till he comes . Basil ! Basil ! Where is he ? Oh , where , where , where ! "
116611	116616	116618	116619	the doctor	3241	" He is here , "
116642	116658	116659	116659	he	3241	" Look at her and speak to her as usual , when she turns round , "
116703	116716	116665	116665	she	44	" Basil ! Basil ! Bring him here ! bring me Basil ! "
116717	116722	116724	116725	Mr. Bernard	84	" He is here , "
116728	116736	116724	116725	Mr. Bernard	84	" Look ! look up at him ! "
116829	116833	116835	116836	the doctor	3241	" Compose yourself , "
116838	116862	116835	116836	the doctor	3241	" Now she is quiet , speak to her ; speak to her before she begins again ; call her by her name . "
116878	116883	116885	116886	Mr. Bernard	84	" Quick ! quick ! "
116888	116897	116885	116886	Mr. Bernard	84	" Try her while you have the chance . "

116989	116999	117001	117002	the doctor	3241	" I am afraid she is too far gone , "
117004	117010	117001	117002	the doctor	3241	" but make another trial . "
117011	117014	117015	117015	I	0	" Margaret , "
117019	117027	117015	117015	I	0	" have you forgotten me ? Margaret ! "
117071	117076	117077	117077	she	44	" Yes , yes , "
117080	117231	117077	117077	she	44	" I know he 's come at last ; I can make him do anything . Get me my bonnet and shawl ; any shawl will do , but a mourning shawl is best , because we are going to the funeral of our wedding . Come , Basil ! let 's go back to the church , and get unmarried again ; that 's what I wanted you for . We do n't care about each other . Robert Mannion wants me more than you do - he 's not ashamed of me because my father 's a tradesman ; he wo n't make believe that he 's in love with me , and then marry me to spite the pride of his family . Come ! I 'll tell the clergyman to read the service backwards ; that makes a marriage no marriage at all , everybody knows . "
117282	117295	117296	117296	he	84	" The medical man whom I found here when I first came , "
117299	117344	117345	117345	he	84	" was sent for this evening into the country , to be consulted about an operation , I believe . But if anything happens , I shall be at your service . There is the address of the house to which I am now going "
117353	117506	117345	117345	he	84	" you can send , if you want me . I will get back , however , as soon as possible , and see her again ; she seems to be a little quieter already , and may become quieter still , if you stay longer . The night - nurse is below - I will send her up as I go downstairs . Keep the room well ventilated , the windows open as they are now . Do n't breathe too close to her , and you need fear no infection . Look ! her eyes are still fixed on you . This is the first time I have seen her look in the same direction for two minutes together ; one would think she really recognised you . Wait till I come back , if you possibly can - I wo n't be a moment longer than I can help . "
117876	117881	117882	117882	she	2477	" I see him , "
117902	118282	117882	117882	she	2477	" I see him ! But he 's a long way off ; he ca n't hear our secrets , and he does not suspect you as mother does . Do n't tell me that about him any more ; my flesh creeps at it ! What are you looking at me in that way for ? You make me feel on fire . You know I like you , because I must like you ; because I ca n't help it . It 's no use saying hush : I tell you he ca n't hear us , and ca n't see us . He can see nothing ; you make a fool of him , and I make a fool of him . But mind ! I will ride in my own carriage : you must keep things secret enough to let me do that . I say I will ride in my carriage : and I 'll go where father walks to business : I do n't care if I splash him with my carriage wheels ! I 'll be even with him for some of the passions he 's been in with me . You see how I 'll go into our shop and order dresses ! be quiet ! I say he ca n't hear us . I 'll have velvet where his sister has silk , and silk where she has muslin : I 'm a finer girl than she is , and I 'll be better dressed . Tell him anything , indeed ! What have I ever let out ? It 's not so easy always to make believe I 'm in love with him , after what you have told me . Suppose he found us out ? - Rash ? I 'm no more rash than you are ! Why did n't you come back from France in time , and stop it all ? Why did you let me marry him ? A nice wife I 've been to him , and a nice husband he has been to me - a husband who waits a year ! Ha ! ha ! he calls himself a man , does n't he ? A husband who waits a year ! "
118329	118334	118335	118335	she	2492	" Beds ! beds ! "
118338	118468	118335	118335	she	2492	" beds everywhere , with dying men on them ! And one bed the most terrible of all - look at it ! The deformed face , with the white of the pillow all round it ! His face ? his face , that had n't a fault in it ? Never ! It 's the face of a devil ; the finger - nails of the devil are on it ! Take me away ! drag me out ! I ca n't move for that face : it 's always before me : it 's walling me up among the beds : it 's burning me all over . Water ! water ! drown me in the sea ; drown me deep , away from the burning face ! "
118469	118486	118487	118487	I	0	" Hush , Margaret ! hush ! drink this , and you will be cool again . "
118499	118787	118788	118788	She	2493	" Yes , yes ; hush , as you say . Where 's Robert ? Robert Mannion ? Not here ! then I 've got a secret for you . When you go home to - night , Basil , and say your prayers , pray for a storm of thunder and lightning ; and pray that I may be struck dead in it , and Robert too . It 's a fortnight to my aunt 's party ; and in a fortnight you 'll wish us both dead , so you had better pray for what I tell you in time . We shall make handsome corpses . Put roses into my coffin - scarlet roses , if you can find any , because that stands for Scarlet Woman - in the Bible , you know . Scarlet ? What do I care ! It 's the boldest colour in the world . Robert will tell you , and all your family , how many women are as scarlet as I am - virtue wears it at home , in secret ; and vice wears it abroad , in public : that 's the only difference , he says . Scarlet roses ! scarlet roses ! throw them into the coffin by hundreds ; smother me up in them ; bury me down deep ; in the dark , quiet street - where there 's a broad door - step in front of a house , and a white , wild face , something like Basil 's , that 's always staring on the doorstep awfully . Oh , why did I meet him ! why did I marry him ! oh , why ! why ! "
119170	119175	119178	119178	her	44	" Innocent ! innocent ! "
119185	119212	119178	119178	her	44	" I 'll swear I 'm innocent , and father is sure to swear it too . Innocent Margaret ! Oh , me ! what innocence ! "
119378	119383	119384	119384	I	0	" Take him away ! "
119393	119413	119386	119386	Margaret	44	" His hands are on me : he 's feeling my face , to feel if I 'm dead ! "

120147	120195	120138	120138	she	44	" I 've broken his heart , and he still comes here to be kind to me ! This is worse than death ! I 'm too bad to be forgiven - leave me ! leave me ! - oh , Basil , leave me to die ! "
120603	120611	120612	120612	he	84	" I could not get back sooner , "
120615	120666	120612	120612	he	84	" the case was desperate , and I was afraid to leave it . You will find a key on the chimney - piece - throw it out to me , and I can let myself in ; I told them not to bolt the door before I went out . "
120747	120750	120751	120751	he	84	" Many , "
120754	120787	120751	120751	he	84	" many changes just as extraordinary , which have raised hopes that I never knew realised . Expect the worst from the change you have witnessed ; it is a fatal sign . "
120862	120890	120860	120860	himself	84	" I thought I heard some one moving in that room , but I suppose I am mistaken ; nobody can be up in the house yet . "
120910	120916	120917	120917	I	0	" Do n't disturb her , "
120930	120930	120917	120917	I	0	"
120961	120968	120969	120969	he	84	" Yes , she is asleep , "
120973	120985	120969	120969	he	84	" asleep , never to wake again . She is dead . "
121015	121029	121030	121030	he	84	" This has been a sad scene for any one at your age , "
121040	121065	121030	121030	he	84	" but you have borne it well . I am glad to see that you can behave so calmly under so hard a trial . "
121598	121605	121606	121606	he	3101	" Do you know me again ? "
121609	121618	121606	121606	he	3101	" Do you know me for Robert Mannion ? "
121809	121818	121819	121819	he	3101	" Do you know me for Robert Mannion ? "
121822	121882	121819	121819	he	3101	" Do you know the work of your own hands , now you see it ? Or , am I changed to you past recognition , as your father might have found my father changed , if he had seen him on the morning of his execution , standing under the gallows , with the cap over his face ? "
121925	121934	121935	121935	he	3101	" Under this earth that we stand on , "
121945	122101	121935	121935	he	3101	" down here , where you are now looking , lies buried with the buried dead , the last influence which might one day have gained you respite and mercy at my hands . Did you think of the one , last chance that you were losing , when you came to see her die ? I watched you , and I watched her . I heard as much as you heard ; I saw as much as you saw ; I know when she died , and how , as you know it ; I shared her last moments with you , to the very end . It was my fancy not to give her up , as your sole possession , even on her death - bed : it is my fancy , now , not to let you stand alone - as if her corpse was your property - over her grave ! "
122142	122145	122146	122146	he	2552	" Stop , "
122149	122210	122211	122211	he	2552	" what I have still to say concerns you . I have to tell you , face to face , standing with you here , over her dead body , that what I wrote from the hospital , is what I will do ; that I will make your whole life to come , one long expiation of this deformity ; "
122217	122222	122223	122223	he	2552	" and of that death "
122233	122389	122223	122223	he	2552	" Go where you will , this face of mine shall never be turned away from you ; this tongue , which you can never silence but by a crime , shall awaken against you the sleeping superstitions and cruelties of all mankind . The noisome secret of that night when you followed us , shall reek up like a pestilence in the nostrils of your fellow - beings , be they whom they may . You may shield yourself behind your family and your friends - I will strike at you through the dearest and the bravest of them ! Now you have heard me , go ! The next time we meet , you shall acknowledge with your own lips that I can act as I speak . Live the free life which Margaret Sherwin has restored to you by her death - you will know it soon for the life of Cain ! "
122503	122511	122512	122512	he	2554	" At last you have come back ! "
122515	122546	122512	122512	he	2554	" I was determined to stop till you did , if I stayed all day . Is anything the matter ? Have you got into some worse difficulty than ever ? "
122547	122561	122490	122490	Ralph	39	" No , Ralph - no . What have you to tell me ? "
122562	122608	122512	122512	he	2554	" Something that will rather surprise you , Basil : I have to tell you to leave London at once ! Leave it for your own interests and for everybody else 's . My father has found out that Clara has been to see you . "
122609	122615	122490	122490	Ralph	39	" Good heavens ! how ? "
122616	122655	122512	122512	he	2554	" He wo n't tell me . But he has found it out . You know how you stand in his opinion - I leave you to imagine what he thinks of Clara 's conduct in coming here . "
122656	122675	122490	122490	Ralph	39	" No ! no ! tell me yourself , Ralph - tell me how she bears his displeasure ! "
122676	122808	122512	122512	he	2554	" As badly as possible . After having forbidden her ever to enter this house again , he now only shows how he is offended , by his silence ; and it is exactly that , of course , which distresses her . Between her notions of implicit obedience to him , and her opposite notions , just as strong , of her sisterly duties to you , she is made miserable from morning to night . What she will end in , if things go on like this , I am really afraid to think ; and I 'm not easily frightened , as you know . Now , Basil , listen to me : it is your business to stop this , and my business to tell you how . "
122809	122823	122490	122490	Ralph	39	" I will do anything you wish - anything for Clara 's sake ! "
122824	123011	122512	122512	he	2554	" Then leave London ; and so cut short the struggle between her duty and her inclination . If you do n't , my father is quite capable of taking her at once into the country , though I know he has important business to keep him in London . Write a letter to her , saying that you have gone away for your health , for change of scene and peace of mind - gone away , in short , to come back better some day . Do n't say where you 're going , and do n't tell me , for she is sure to ask , and sure to get it out of me if I know . Then she might be writing to you , and that might be found out , too . She ca n't distress herself about your absence , if you account for it properly , as she distresses herself now - that is one consideration . And you will serve your own interests , as well as Clara 's , by going away - that is another . "
123012	123027	122490	122490	Ralph	39	" Never mind my interests . Clara ! I can only think of Clara ! "
123028	123183	122512	122512	he	2554	" But you have interests , and you must think of them . I told my father of the death of that unhappy woman , and of your noble behaviour when she was dying . Do n't interrupt me , Basil - it was noble ; I could n't have done what you did , I can tell you ! I saw he was more struck by it than he was willing to confess . An impression has been made on him by the turn circumstances have taken . Only leave that impression to strengthen , and you 're safe . But if you destroy it by staying here , after what has happened , and keeping Clara in this new dilemma - my dear fellow , you destroy your best chance ! There is a sort of defiance of him in stopping ; there is a downright concession to him in going away . "
123184	123211	122490	122490	Ralph	39	" I will go , Ralph ; you have more than convinced me that I ought ! I will go to - morrow , though where - "
123212	123333	122512	122512	he	2554	" You have the rest of the day to think where . I should go abroad and amuse myself ; but your ideas of amusement are , most likely , not mine . At any rate , wherever you go , I can always supply you with money , when you want it ; you can write to me , after you have been away some little time , and I can write back , as soon as I have good news to tell you . Only stick to your present determination , Basil , and , I 'll answer for it , you will be back in your own study at home , before you are many months older ! "
123334	123380	122490	122490	Ralph	39	" I will put it out of my power to fail in my resolution , by writing to Clara at once , and giving you the letter to place in her hands to - morrow evening , when I shall have left London some hours . "
123381	123397	122512	122512	he	2554	" That 's right , Basil ! that 's acting and speaking like a man ! "
123453	123463	123464	123464	he	154	" She shall have it to - morrow night , "
123467	123582	123464	123464	he	154	" and my father shall know why you have left town , at the same time . Depend on me in this , as in everything else . And now , Basil , I must say good bye - unless you 're in the humour for coming to look at my new house this evening . Ah ! I see that wo n't suit you just now , so , good bye , old fellow ! Write when you are in any necessity - get back your spirits and your health - and never doubt that the step you are now taking will be the best for Clara , and the best for yourself ! "
124864	124890	124858	124858	his	2598	" You may shield yourself behind your family and your friends : I will strike at you through the dearest and the bravest of them - "
124932	124986	124926	124926	I	0	" If he is following me , I must not , and will not avoid him : it will be the best result of my departure , that I shall draw after me that destroying presence ; and thus at least remove it far and safely away from my family and my home ! "
127519	127544	127501	127501	he	2694	" I 'm not to bring you anything more ; father says he wo n't sell to you again , whatever you pay him . "
127567	127574	127603	127608	The man who said these words	2699	" You had best leave us , "
127581	127602	127603	127608	The man who said these words	2699	" If you do n't go of your own accord , our people will starve you out of the place . "
127646	127664	127666	127666	his	2699	" You know what we mean , and why we want you to go , well enough , "
127695	127703	127704	127704	he	2699	" I 'll tell you about it , "
127707	127722	127704	127704	he	2699	" but not now ; I do n't want to be seen with you . "
127744	127760	127726	127726	he	2699	" Go home again , and shut yourself up ; I 'll come at dusk . "

127922	127932	127933	127933	he	696	" Then I 'll soon let you know it , "
127936	127946	127933	127933	he	696	" We want you gone from here , because - "
127947	127950	127955	127955	him	696	" Because , "
127965	127992	127955	127955	him	696	" because you 're bringing a blight on us , and our houses - because we want our children 's faces left as God made them - "
127993	127996	127998	128000	a second woman	2708	" Because , "
128007	128035	127998	128000	a second woman	2708	" you 're bringing devil 's vengeances among Christian people ! Come back , John ! he 's not safe for a true man to speak to . "

130253	130448	130250	130250	he	73	" and among those ignorant people , my deformed face has borne witness against you , and Margaret 's death has been avenged , as I said it should . You have been expelled as a pest and a curse , by a community of poor fishermen ; you have begun to live your life of excommunication , as I lived mine . Superstition ! - barbarous , monstrous superstition , which I found ready made to my use , is the scourge with which I have driven you from that hiding - place . Look at me now ! I have got back my strength ; I am no longer the sick refuse of the hospital . Where you go , I have the limbs and the endurance to go too ! I tell you again , we are linked together for life ; I can not leave you if I would . The horrible joy of hunting you through the world , leaps in my blood like fire ! Look ! look out on those tossing waves . There is no rest for them ; there shall be no rest for you ! "
