3582	3596	3598	3600	the old dwarf	357	" Is there nothing else that you want to ask me , Macumazahn ? "
3624	3648	3619	3619	I	0	" That is strange , Macumazahn , for I seem to see something written on your mind - something to do with spirits . "
3674	3684	3685	3685	he	104	" Ah ! it comes back , does it ? "
3692	3746	3685	3685	he	104	" Out with it , then , Macumazahn , while I am in a mood to answer , and before I grow tired , for you are an old friend of mine and will so remain till the end , many years hence , and if I can serve you , I will . "
3770	3788	3789	3789	I	0	" You are named ' Opener - of - Roads , ' are you not , Zikali ? "
3792	3823	3871	3871	he	358	" Yes , the Zulus have always called me that , since before the days of Chaka . But what of names , which often enough mean nothing at all ? "
3824	3845	3871	3871	he	358	" Only that I want to open a road , Zikali , that which runs across the River of Death . "
3846	3849	3850	3850	he	358	" Oho ! "
3853	3859	3850	3850	he	358	" it is very easy , "
3879	3915	3871	3871	he	358	" Be brave now and fall on that . Then before I have counted sixty the road will be wide open , but whether you will see anything on it I can not tell you . "
3924	3982	3917	3917	I	0	" It is against our law . Also while I still live I desire to know whether I shall meet certain others on that road after my time has come to cross the River . Perhaps you who deal with spirits , can prove the matter to me , which no one else seems able to do . "
3983	3986	3988	3988	Zikali	104	" Oho ! "
3991	4034	3988	3988	Zikali	104	" What do my ears hear ? Am I , the poor Zulu cheat , as you will remember once you called me , Macumazahn , asked to show that which is hidden from all the wisdom of the great White People ? "
4035	4040	4041	4041	I	0	" The question is , "
4046	4061	4041	4041	I	0	" not what you are asked to do , but what you can do . "
4062	4102	3988	3988	Zikali	104	" That I do not know yet , Macumazahn . Whose spirits do you desire to see ? If that of a woman called Mameena is one of them , I think that perhaps I whom she loved - - "
4112	4117	4119	4119	Editor	108	" Child of Storm . "
4121	4146	4041	4041	I	0	" She is not one of them , Zikali . Moreover , if she loved you , you paid back her love with death . "
4147	4317	4041	4041	I	0	" Which perhaps was the kindest thing I could do , Macumazahn , for reasons that you may be able to guess , and others with which I will not trouble you . But if not hers , whose ? Let me look , let me look ! Why , there seems to be two of them , head - wives , I mean , and I thought that white men only took one wife . Also a multitude of others ; their faces float up in the water of your mind . An old man with grey hair , little children , perhaps they were brothers and sisters , and some who may be friends . Also very clear indeed that Mameena whom you do not wish to see . Well , Macumazahn , this is unfortunate , since she is the only one whom I can show you , or rather put you in the way of finding . Unless indeed there are other Kaffir women - - "
4318	4324	4325	4325	I	0	" What do you mean ? "
4328	4359	4041	4041	I	0	" I mean , Macumazahn , that only black feet travel on the road which I can open ; over those in which ran white blood I have no power . "
4360	4366	4367	4367	I	0	" Then it is finished , "
4382	4416	4041	4041	I	0	" Come back and sit down , Macumazahn . I did not say so . Am I the only ruler of magic in Africa , which I am told is a big country ? "
4437	4443	4444	4444	I	0	" Thank you , Zikali , "
4447	4462	4444	4444	I	0	" but I will have no dealings with more of your witch - doctors . "
4463	4537	4041	4041	I	0	" No , no , because you are afraid of them ; quite without reason , Macumazahn , seeing that they are all cheats except myself . I am the last child of wisdom , the rest are stuffed with lies , as Chaka found out when he killed every one of them whom he could catch . But perhaps there might be a white doctor who would have rule over white spirits . "
4538	4545	4546	4546	I	0	" If you mean missionaries - - "
4550	4588	4041	4041	I	0	" No , Macumazahn , I do not mean your praying men who are cast in one mould and measured with one rule , and say what they are taught to say , not thinking for themselves . "
4589	4597	4041	4041	I	0	" Some of them think , Zikali . "
4598	4660	4041	4041	I	0	" Yes , and then the others fall on them with big sticks . The real priest is he to whom the Spirit comes , not he who feeds upon its wrappings , and speaks through a mask carved by his father 's fathers . I am a priest like that , which is why all my fellowship have hated me . "
4661	4700	4041	4041	I	0	" If so , you have paid back their hate , Zikali , but cease to cast round the lion , like a timid hound , and tell me what you mean . Of whom do you speak ? "
4701	4742	4041	4041	I	0	" That is the trouble , Macumazahn . I do not know . This lion , or rather lioness , lies hid in the caves of a very distant mountain and I have never seen her - in the flesh . "
4743	4756	4041	4041	I	0	" Then how can you talk of what you have never seen ? "
4757	4868	4041	4041	I	0	" In the same way , Macumazahn , that your priests talk of what they have never seen , because they , or a few of them , have knowledge of it . I will tell you a secret . All seers who live at the same time , if they are great , commune with each other because they are akin and their spirits meet in sleep or dreams . Therefore I know of a mistress of our craft , a very lioness among jackals , who for thousands of years has lain sleeping in the northern caves and , humble though I am , she knows of me . "
4869	4873	4874	4874	I	0	" Quite so , "
4879	4913	4874	4874	I	0	" but perhaps , Zikali , you will come to the point of the spear . What of her ? How is she named , and if she exists will she help me ? "
4914	5047	4041	4041	I	0	" I will answer your question backwards , Macumazahn . I think that she will help you if you help her , in what way I do not know , because although witch - doctors sometimes work without pay , as I am doing now , Macumazahn , witch - doctoresses never do . As for her name , the only one that she has among our company is ' Queen , ' because she is the first of all of them and the most beauteous among women . For the rest I can tell you nothing , except that she has always been and I suppose , in this shape or in that , will always be while the world lasts , because she has found the secret of life unending . "
5048	5058	5059	5059	I	0	" You mean that she is immortal , Zikali , "
5065	5222	4041	4041	I	0	" I do not say that , Macumazahn , because my little mind can not shape the thought of immortality . But when I was a babe , which is far ago , she had lived so long that scarce would she knew the difference between then and now , and already in her breast was all wisdom gathered . I know it , because although , as I have said , we have never seen each other , at times we walk together in our sleep , for thus she shares her loneliness , and I think , though this may be but a dream , that last night she told me to send you on to her to seek an answer to certain questions which you would put to me to - day . Also to me she seemed to desire that you should do her a service ; I know not what service . "
5230	5273	5224	5224	I	0	" Why does it please you to fool me , Zikali , with such talk as this ? If there is any truth in it , show me where the woman called Queen lives and how I am to come to her . "
5465	5473	5474	5474	he	359	" Look at it well , Macumazahn , "
5477	5518	5474	5474	he	359	" and forget nothing , since if you make this journey and forget , you die . Nay , no need to copy it in that book of yours , for see , I will stamp it on your mind . "
5548	5556	5521	5521	he	359	" There , now you will remember . "
5557	5562	5563	5563	I	0	" Certainly I shall , "
5568	5584	5563	5563	I	0	" and I beg that you will not play such a joke upon me again . "
5609	5618	5619	5619	I	0	" That big river must be the Zambesi , "
5622	5650	5619	5619	I	0	" and even then the mountain of your Queen , if it be her mountain , is far away , and how can I come there alone ? "
5651	5704	5718	5718	Zikali	104	" I do n't know , Macumazahn , though perhaps you might do so in company . At least I believe that in the old days people used to travel to the place , since I have heard a great city stood there once which was the heart of a mighty empire . "
5802	5813	6382	6382	He	370	" How did people travel to the city , Zikali ? "
5814	5859	6382	6382	He	370	" By sea , I suppose , Macumazahn , but I think that you will be wise not to try that road , since I believe that on the sea side the marshes are now impassable and you will be safer on your feet . "
5860	5883	6382	6382	He	370	" You want me to go on this adventure , Zikali . Why ? I know you never do anything without motive . "
5884	5997	6382	6382	He	370	" Oho ! Macumazahn , you are clever and see deeper into the trunk of a tree than most . Yes , I want you to go for three reasons . First , that you may satisfy your soul on certain matters and I would help you to do so . Secondly , because I want to satisfy mine , and thirdly , because I know that you will come back safe to be a prop to me in things that will happen in days unborn . Otherwise I would have told you nothing of this story , since it is necessary to me that you should remain living beneath the sun . "
5998	6011	6382	6382	He	370	" Have done , Zikali . What is it that you desire ? "
6012	6093	6382	6382	He	370	" Oh ! a great deal that I shall get , but chiefly two things , so with the rest I will not trouble you . First I desire to know to know whether these dreams of mine of a wonderful white witch - doctoress , or witch , and of my converse with her are indeed more than dreams . Next I would learn whether certain plots of mine at which I have worked for years , will succeed . "
6094	6114	6382	6382	He	370	" What plots , Zikali , and how can my taking a distant journey tell you anything about them ? "
6115	6189	6382	6382	He	370	" You know them well enough , Macumazahn ; they have to do with the overthrow of a Royal House that has worked me bitter wrong . As to how your journey can help me , why , thus . You shall promise to me to ask of this Queen whether Zikali , Opener - of - Roads , shall triumph or be overthrown in that on which he has set his heart . "
6190	6211	6382	6382	He	370	" As you seem to know this witch so well , why do you not ask her yourself , Zikali ? "
6212	6287	6382	6382	He	370	" To ask is one thing , Macumazahn . To get an answer is another . I have asked in the watches of the night , and the reply was , ' Come hither and perchance I will tell you . ' ' Queen , ' I said , ' how can I come save in the spirit , who am an ancient and a crippled dwarf scarcely able to stand upon my feet ? '
6288	6352	6382	6382	He	370	" ' Then send a messenger , Wizard , and be sure that he is white , for of black savages I have seen more than enough . Let him bear a token also that he comes from you and tell me of it in your sleep . Moreover let that token be something of power which will protect him on the journey . '
6353	6368	6382	6382	He	370	" Such is the answer that comes to me in my dreams , Macumazahn . "
6369	6381	6382	6382	He	370	" Well , what token will you give me , Zikali ? "
6523	6543	6516	6516	Zikali	104	" Have a care , Macumazahn . Am I young that I can bear bring dashed to the ground ? "
6544	6550	6551	6551	I	0	" What do you mean ? "
6606	6636	6655	6655	he	370	" It is a clever carving , is it not , Macumazahn ? I am skilled in that art , you know , and therefore can judge of carving . "
6637	6643	6644	6644	I	0	" Yes , I know , "
6674	6681	6655	6655	he	370	" But what of the thing ? "
6682	6766	6768	6768	I	0	" Macumazahn , it has come down to me through the ages . As you may have heard , all great doctors when they die pass on their wisdom and something of their knowledge to another doctor of spirits who is still living on the earth , that nothing may be lost , or as little as possible . Also I have learned that to such likenesses as these may be given the strength of him or her from whom they were shaped . "
6857	6968	6849	6849	he	104	" When that ivory is hung over your heart , Macumazahn , where you must always wear it , learn that with it goes the strength of Zikali ; the thought that would have been his thought and the wisdom that is his wisdom , will be your companions , as much as though he walked at your side and could instruct you in every peril . Moreover north and south and east and west this image is known to men who , when they see it , will bow down and obey , opening a road to him who wears the medicine of the Opener - of - Roads . "
6969	6972	6973	6973	I	0	" Indeed , "
6978	6988	6973	6973	I	0	" and what is this colour on the ivory ? "
6989	7063	7066	7066	he	377	" I forget , Macumazahn , who have had it a great number of years , ever since it descended to me from a forefather of mine , who was fashioned in the same mould as I am . It looks like blood , does it not ? It is a pity that Mameena is not still alive , since she whose memory was so excellent might have been able to tell you , "
7138	7148	7149	7149	I	0	" You tell me to go on this journey , "
7152	7176	7149	7149	I	0	" and not alone . Yet for companion you give me only an ugly piece of ivory shaped as no man ever was , "
7185	7225	7178	7178	I	0	" and from the look of it , steeped in blood , which ivory , if I had my way , I would throw into the camp fire . Who , then , am I to take with me ? "
7226	7312	7333	7333	Zikali	104	" Do n't do that , Macumazahn - I mean throw the ivory into the fire - since I have no wish to burn before my time , and if you do , you who have worn it might burn with me . At least certainly you would die with the magic thing and go to acquire knowledge more quickly than you desire . No , no , and do not try to take it off your neck , or rather try if you will . "
7450	7482	7437	7437	he	104	" You asked whom you were to take with you , Macumazahn . Well , as to this I must make inquiry of those who know . Man , my medicines ! "
7538	7540	7568	7568	he	104	" Lord "
7542	7544	7568	7568	he	104	" Home "
7562	7567	7568	7568	he	104	" A common method , "
7612	7612	7610	7610	Macumazahn	105	"
7676	7769	7771	7771	he	386	" Do you know a man named Umslopogaas , Macumazahn , the chief of a tribe that is called The People of the Axe , whose titles of praise are Bulalio or the Slaughterer , and Woodpecker , the latter from the way he handles his ancient axe ? He is a savage fellow , but one of high blood and higher courage , a great captain in his way , though he will never come to anything , save a glorious death - in your company , I think , Macumazahn . "
7780	7797	7771	7771	he	386	" Yes , I am sure , in your company , though not upon this journey . "
7798	7805	7806	7806	I	0	" I have heard of him , "
7810	7832	7806	7806	I	0	" It is said in the land that he is a son of Chaka , the great king of the Zulus . "
7833	7903	7771	7771	he	386	" Is it , Macumazahn ? And is it said also that he was the slayer of Chaka 's brother , Dingaan , also the lover of the fairest woman that the Zulus have ever seen , who was called Nada the Lily ? Unless indeed a certain Mameena , who , I seem to remember , was a friend of yours , may have been even more beautiful ? "
7904	7913	7914	7914	I	0	" I know nothing of Nada the Lily , "
7917	8114	8139	8139	his	104	" No , no , Mameena , ' the Waiting Wind , ' has blown over her fame , so why should you know of one who has been dead a long while ? Why also , Macumazahn , do you always bring women into every business ? I begin to believe that although you are so strict in a white man 's fashion , you must be too fond of them , a weakness which makes for ruin to any man . Well , now , I think that this wolf - man , this axe - man , this warrior , Umslopogaas should be a good fellow to you on your journey to visit the white witch , Queen - another woman by the way , Macumazahn , and therefore one of whom you should be careful . Oh ! yes , he will come with you - because of a man called Lousta and a woman named Monazi , a wife of his who hates him and does - not hate Lousta . I am almost sure that he will come with you , so do not stop to ask questions about him . "
8115	8121	8122	8122	I	0	" Is there anyone else ? "
8148	8193	8139	8139	his	104	" You seem to have a little yellow man in your service , a clever snake who knows how to creep through grass , and when to strike and when to lie hidden . I should take him too , if I were you . "
8194	8248	8139	8139	his	104	" You know well that I have such a man , Zikali , a Hottentot named Hans , clever in his way but drunken , very faithful too , since he loved my father before me . He is cooking my supper in the waggon now . Are there to be any others ? "
8249	8322	8139	8139	his	104	" No , I think you three will be enough , with a guard of soldiers from the People of the Axe , for you will meet with fighting and a ghost or two . Umslopogaas has always one at his elbow named Nada , and perhaps you have several . For instance , there was a certain Mameena whom I always seem to feel about me when you are near , Macumazahn .
8323	8393	8139	8139	his	104	" Why , the wind is rising again , which is odd on so still an evening . Listen to how it wails , yes , and stirs your hair , though mine hangs straight enough . But why do I talk of ghosts , seeing that you travel to seek other ghosts , white ghosts , beyond my ken , who can only deal with those who were black ?
8394	8448	8139	8139	his	104	" Good - night , Macumazahn , good - night . When you return from visiting the white Queen , that Great One beneath those feet I , Zikali , who am also great in my way , am but a grain of dust , come and tell me her answer to my question .
8449	8570	8139	8139	his	104	" Meanwhile , be careful always to wear that pretty little image which I have given you , as a young lover sometimes wears a lock of hair cut from the head of some fool - girl that he thinks is fond of him . It will bring you safety and luck , Macumazahn , which , for the most part , is more than the lock of hair does to the lover . Oh ! it is a strange world , full of jest to those who can see the strings that work it . I am one of them , and perhaps , Macumazahn , you are another , or will be before all is done - or begun .
8571	8701	8139	8139	his	104	" Good - night , and good fortune to you on your journeyings , and , Macumazahn , although you are so fond of women , be careful not to fall in love with that white Queen , because it would make others jealous ; I mean some who you have lost sight of for a while , also I think that being under a curse of her own , she is not one whom you can put into your sack . Oho ! Oho - ho ! Slave , bring me my blanket , it grows cold , and my medicine also , that which protects me from the ghosts , who are thick to - night . Macumazahn brings them , I think . Oho - ho ! "
8726	8754	8714	8714	Zikali	104	" When you meet this Umslopogaas , as you will meet him , he who is called the Woodpecker and the Slaughterer , say these words to him ,
8755	8911	8714	8714	Zikali	104	" ' A bat has been twittering round the hut of the Opener - of - Roads , and to his ears it squeaked the name of a certain Lousta and the name of a woman called Monazi . Also it twittered another greater name that may not be uttered , that of an elephant who shakes the earth , and said that this elephant sniffs the air with his trunk and grows angry , and sharpens his tusks to dig a certain Woodpecker out of his hole in a tree that grows near the Witch Mountain . Say , too , that the Opener - of - Roads thinks that this Woodpecker would be wise to fly north for a while in the company of one who watches by night , lest harm should come to a bird that pecks at the feet of the great and chatters of it in his nest . ' "

9651	9660	9662	9662	he	87	" as clever as a waggonload of monkeys . "
9832	9836	9798	9798	he	87	" The Holy Flower "
9840	9847	9848	9848	he	87	" What is it , Baas ? "
9851	9862	9848	9848	he	87	" Here there are no lions , nor any game . "
9863	9874	9875	9875	He	87	" Look the other side of the bush , Hans . "
9946	9966	9941	9941	he	87	" Black ' mamba , or so you would call it , though I know it for something else . "
9967	9973	9941	9941	he	87	" What else , Hans ? "
9974	10037	9941	9941	he	87	" One of the old witch - doctor Zikali 's spirits which he sets at the mouth of this kloof to warn him of who comes or goes . I know it well , and so do others . I saw it listening behind a stone when you were up the kloof last evening talking with the Opener - of - Roads . "
10038	10046	10047	10047	I	0	" Then Zikali will lack a spirit , "
10052	10074	10047	10047	I	0	" which perhaps he will not miss amongst so many . It serves him right for setting the brute on me . "
10075	10093	10094	10094	he	416	" Quite so , Baas . He will be angry . I wonder why he did it ? "
10109	10109	10094	10094	he	416	"
10110	10132	10094	10094	he	416	" He did n't do it , Hans . These snakes are very fierce and give battle , that is all . "
10188	10335	10185	10185	he	87	" Why do you wear that pretty likeness of the Great One yonder over your heart , as I have known you do with things that belonged to women in past days , Baas ? Do you know that it is Zikali 's Great Medicine , nothing less , as everyone does throughout the land ? When Zikali sends an order far away , he always sends that image with it , for then he who receives the order knows that he must obey or die . Also the messenger knows that he will come to no harm if he does not take it off , because , Baas , the image is Zikali himself , and Zikali is the image . They are one and the same . Also it is the image of his father 's father 's father - or so he says . "
10336	10343	10344	10344	I	0	" That is an odd story , "
10375	10385	10386	10386	he	87	" So we are going on a long journey , "
10389	10481	10386	10386	he	87	" Well , I thought it was time that we did something more than wander about these tame countries selling blankets to stinking old women and so forth , Baas . Moreover , Zikali does not wish that you should come to harm , doubtless because he does wish to make use of you afterwards - oh ! it 's safe to talk now when that spirit is away looking for another snake . What were you doing with the Great Medicine , Baas , when the ' mamba attacked you ? "
10482	10513	10368	10368	Hans	87	" Taking it off to throw it into the pool , Hans , as I do not like the thing . I tried twice and each time the immamba appeared . "
10514	10572	10386	10386	he	87	" Of course it appeared , Baas , and what is more , if you had taken that Medicine off and thrown it away you would have disappeared , since the ' mamba would have killed you . Zikali wanted to show you that , Baas , and that is why he set the snake at you . "
10573	10583	10368	10368	Hans	87	" You are a superstitious old fool , Hans . "
10584	10797	10386	10386	he	87	" Yes , Baas , but my father knew all about that Great Medicine before me , for he was a bit of a doctor , and so does every wizard and witch for a thousand miles or more . I tell you , Baas , it is known by all though no one ever talks about it , no , not even the king himself . Baas , speaking to you , not with the voice of Hans the old drunkard , but with that of the Predikant , your reverend father , who made so good a Christian of me and who tells me to do so from up in Heaven where the hot fires are which the wood feeds of itself , I beg you not to try to throw away the Medicine again , or if you wish to do so , to leave me behind on this journey . For you see , Baas , although I am now so good , almost like one of those angels with the pretty goose 's wings in the pictures , I feel that I should like to grow a little better before I go to the Place of Fires to make report to your reverend father , the Predikant . "
10847	10990	10838	10838	Hans	87	" Wear the Great Medicine , Baas , wear it ; part with the liver inside you before you part with that , Baas . It may not be as pretty or smell as sweet as a woman 's hair in a little gold bottle , but it is much more useful . The sight of the woman 's hair will only make you sick in your stomach and cause you to remember a lot of things which you had much better forget , but the Great Medicine , or rather Zikali who is in it , will keep the assegais and sickness out of you and turn back bad magic on to the heads of those who sent it , and always bring us plenty to eat and perhaps , if we are lucky , a little to drink too sometimes . "
10991	10995	10996	10996	I	0	" Go away , "
10999	11005	10996	10996	I	0	" I want to wash . "
11006	11089	10838	10838	Hans	87	" Yes , Baas , but with the Baas 's leave I will sit on the other side of that bush with the gun - not to look at the Baas without his clothes , because white people are always so ugly that it makes me feel ill to see them undressed , also because - the Baas will forgive me - but because they smell . No , not for that , but just to see that no other snake comes . "
11090	11107	11108	11108	I	0	" Get out of the road , you dirty little scoundrel , and stop your impudence , "
11827	11833	11834	11834	he	87	" Very good , Baas , "
11837	11862	11864	11864	he	87	" I , too , should like to go to Durban . There are lots of things there that we can not get here , "
11896	11912	11864	11864	he	87	" Yet , Baas , we shall not see the Berea for a long while . "
11913	11920	11921	11921	I	0	" Why do you say that ? "
11925	11970	11864	11864	he	87	" Oh ! Baas , I do n't know , but you went to visit the Opener - of - Roads , did you not , and he told you to go north and lent you a certain Great Medicine , did he not ? "
12007	12050	11990	11990	his	87	" Quite true , Hans , but now I mean to show Zikali that I am not his messenger , for south or north or east or west . So to - morrow morning we cross the river and trek for Natal . "
12051	12070	11990	11990	his	87	" Yes , Baas , but then why not cross it this evening ? There is still light . "
12071	12085	12086	12086	I	0	" I have said that we will cross it to - morrow morning , "
12102	12111	12086	12086	I	0	" and I do not change my word . "
12112	12185	11990	11990	his	87	" No , Baas , but sometimes other things change besides words . Will the Baas have that buck 's leg for supper , or the stuff out of a tin with a dint in it , which we bought at a store two years ago ? The flies have got at the buck 's leg , but I cut out the bits with the maggots on it and ate them myself . "
12701	12707	12708	12708	I	0	" What is that called ? "
12748	12816	12708	12708	I	0	" That is the Witch Mountain , Baas , where the Chief Umslopogaas and a blood brother of his who carried a great club used to hunt with the wolves . It is haunted and in a cave at the top of it lie the bones of Nada the Lily , the fair woman whose name is a song , she who was the love of Umslopogaas . "
12828	12833	12835	12835	Editor	108	" Nada the Lily . "
12837	12840	12841	12841	I	0	" Rubbish , "
12874	12882	12856	12856	Zikali	104	" Where then lives the Chief Umslopogaas ? "
12883	13022	12856	12856	Zikali	104	" They say that his town is yonder on the plain , Baas . It is called the Place of the Axe and is strongly fortified with a river round most of it , and his people are the People of the Axe . They are a fierce people , and all the country round here is uninhabited because Umslopogaas has cleaned out the tribes who used to live in it , first with his wolves and afterwards in war . He is so strong a chief and so terrible in battle that even Chaka himself was afraid of him , and they say that he brought Dingaan the King to his end because of a quarrel about this Nada . Cetywayo , the present king , too leaves him alone and to him he pays no tribute . "
13065	13074	13076	13076	Hans	87	" Here come some chips from the Axe , "
13282	13284	13372	13376	the soldier in the middle	466	" axe "

13379	13387	13372	13376	the soldier in the middle	466	" Are you blind , White Man ? "
13388	13394	13395	13395	I	0	" No , Black Fellow , "
13398	13419	13395	13395	I	0	" but I am short - sighted . Would you be so good as to stand out of my light ? "
13450	13481	13443	13443	I	0	" ' Tis plain , As anatomists tell us , that never again , Shall life revisit the foully slain When once they 've been cut through the jugular vein . "
13504	13541	13496	13496	I	0	" If you are wanderers who want food , as I judge by your being so thin , I am sorry that I have little meat , but my servants will give you what they can . "
13542	13545	13547	13548	the spokesman	468	" Ow ! "
13550	13569	13547	13548	the spokesman	468	" he calls us wanderers ! Either he must be a very great man or he is mad . "
13570	13581	13582	13582	I	0	" You are right . I am a great man , "
13587	13611	13582	13582	I	0	" and if you trouble me too much you will see that I can be mad also . Now what do you want ? "
13612	13635	13637	13638	the man	324	" We are messengers from the great Chief Umslopogaas , Captain of the People of the Axe , and we want tribute , "
13645	13682	13582	13582	I	0	" Do you ? Then you wo n't get it . I thought that only the King of Zululand had a right to tribute , and your Captain 's name is not Cetywayo , is it ? "
13683	13690	13692	13693	the man	324	" Our Captain is King here , "
13698	13767	13692	13693	the man	324	" Is he indeed ? Then away with you back to him and tell this King of whom I have never heard , though I have a message for a certain Umslopogaas , that Macumazahn , Watcher - by - Night , intends to visit him to - morrow , if he will send a guide at the first light to show the best path for the waggon . "
13768	13771	13773	13774	the man	324	" Hearken , "
13779	13802	13773	13774	the man	324	" this is Macumazahn himself and no other . Well , we thought it , for who else would have dared - - "
13812	13814	13807	13807	their	472	" Chief "
14407	14436	14397	14397	He	510	" What ! Has a white man come to fight me for the chieftainship of the People of the Axe ? Well , he is a small one . "
14437	14440	14441	14441	I	0	" No , "
14445	14486	14441	14441	I	0	" but Macumazahn , Watcher - by - Night , has come to visit you in answer to your request , O Umslopogaas ; Macumazahn whose name was known in this land before yours was told of , O Umslopogaas . "
14503	14511	14512	14512	he	503	" I greet you , O Macumazahn , "
14515	14708	14512	14512	he	503	" who although you are small in stature , are very great indeed in fame . Have I not heard how you conquered Bangu , although Saduko slew him , and of how you gave up the six hundred head of cattle to Tshoza and the men of the Amangwane who fought with you , the cattle that were your own ? Have I not heard how you led the Tulwana against the Usutu and stamped flat three of Cetywayo 's regiments in the days of Panda , although , alas ! because of an oath of mine I lifted no steel in that battle , I who will have nothing to do with those that spring from the blood of Senzangacona - perhaps because I smell too strongly of it , Macumazahn . Oh ! yes , I have heard these and many other things concerning you , though until now it has never been my fortune to look upon your face , O Watcher - by - Night , and therefore I greet you well , Bold one , Cunning one , Upright one , Friend of us Black People . "
14709	14713	14714	14714	I	0	" Thank you , "
14717	14752	14714	14714	I	0	" but you said something about fighting . If there is to be anything of the sort , let us get it over . If you want to fight , I am quite ready , "
14772	14887	14889	14889	he	514	" Listen . By an ancient law any man on this day in each year may fight me for this Chieftainship , as I fought and conquered him who held it before me , and take it from me with my life and the axe , though of late none seems to like the business . But that law was made before there were guns , or men like Macumazahn who , it is said , can hit a lizard on a wall at fifty paces . Therefore I tell you that if you wish to fight me with a rifle , O Macumazahn , I give in and you may have the chieftainship , "
14897	14923	14924	14924	I	0	" I think it is too hot for fighting either with guns or axes , and Chieftainships are honey that is full of stinging bees , "
15113	15124	15125	15125	she	523	" I , Monazi , have a complaint to make , "
15128	15167	15125	15125	she	523	" as it is the right of the humblest to do on this day . In succession to Zinita whom Dingaan slew with her children , I am your Inkosikaas , your head - wife , O Umslopogaas . "
15168	15175	15177	15177	Umslopogaas	125	" That I know well enough , "
15179	15184	15125	15125	she	523	" what of it ? "
15185	15270	15340	15340	her	526	" This , that you neglect me for other women , as you neglected Zinita for Nada the Beautiful , Nada the witch . I am childless , as are all your wives because of the curse that this Nada left behind her . I demand that this curse should be lifted from me . For your sake I abandoned Lousta the Chief , to whom I was betrothed , and this is the end of it , that I am neglected and childless . "
15271	15288	15290	15290	Umslopogaas	125	" Am I the Heavens Above that I can cause you to bear children , woman ? "
15293	15319	15290	15290	Umslopogaas	125	" Would that you had clung to Lousta , my blood - brother and my friend , whom you lament , and left me alone . "
15320	15333	15335	15335	Monazi	114	" That still may chance , if I am not better treated , "
15343	15375	15340	15340	her	526	" Will you dismiss yonder new wife of yours and give me back my place , and will you lift the curse of Nada off me , or will you not ? "
15376	15382	15384	15384	Umslopogaas	125	" As to the first , "
15386	15519	15384	15384	Umslopogaas	125	" learn , Monazi , that I will not dismiss my new wife , who at least is gentler - tongued and truer - hearted than you are . As to the second , you ask that which it is not in my power to give , since children are the gift of Heaven , and barrenness is its bane . Moreover , you have done ill to bring into this matter the name of one who is dead , who of all women was the sweetest and most innocent . Lastly , I warn you before the people to cease from your plottings or traffic with Lousta , lest ill come of them to you , or him , even though he be my blood - brother , or to both . "
15520	15523	15525	15525	Monazi	114	" Plottings ! "
15533	15593	15525	15525	Monazi	114	" Does Umslopogaas talk of plottings ? Well , I have heard that Chaka the Lion left a son , and that this son has set a trap for the feet of him who sits on Chaka 's throne . Perchance that king has heard it also ; perchance the People of the Axe will soon have another Chief . "
15594	15599	15601	15601	Umslopogaas	125	" Is it thus ? "
15604	15615	15601	15601	Umslopogaas	125	" And if so , will he be named Lousta ? "
15633	15744	15629	15629	he	125	" What have I done that the wives of my bosom should be my betrayers , those who would give me to death ? Zinita betrayed me to Dingaan and in reward was slain , and my children with her . Now would you , Monazi , betray me to Cetywayo - though in truth there is naught to betray ? Well , if so , bethink you and let Lousta bethink him of what chanced to Zinita , and of what chances to those who stand before the axe of Umslopogaas . What have I done , I say , that women should thus strive to work me ill ? "
15745	15748	15750	15750	Monazi	114	" This , "
15756	15849	15750	15750	Monazi	114	" that you have loved one of them too well . If he would live in peace , he who has wives should favour all alike . Least of anything should he moan continually over one who is dead , a witch who has left a curse behind her and thus insulted and do wrong to the living . Also he would be wise to attend to the matters of his own tribe and household and to cease from ambitions that may bring him to the assegai , and them with him . "
15850	15863	15865	15865	Umslopogaas	125	" I have heard your counsel , Wife , so now begone ! "
15882	15889	15890	15890	he	125	" Have you wives , Macumazahn ? "
15905	15911	15912	15912	I	0	" Only among the spirits , "
15915	15958	15890	15890	he	125	" Well for you then ; moreover , it is a bond between us , for I too have but one true wife and she also is among the spirits . But go rest a while , and later we will talk . "
16323	16377	16320	16320	he	503	" I see that like other creatures which move at night , such as leopards and hyenas , you take note of all , O Watcher - by - Night , even of the soldier who guards this place and of where the fence is set and of how its gate is fashioned . "
16378	16395	16320	16320	he	503	" Had I not done so I should have been dead long ago , O Chief . "
16396	16551	16320	16320	he	503	" Yes , and because it is not my nature to do so as I should , perchance I shall soon be dead . It is not enough to be fierce and foremost in the battle , Macumazahn . He who would sleep safe and of whom , when he dies , folk will say ' He has eaten ' i.e. , he has lived out his life , must do more than this . He must guard his tongue and even his thoughts ! he must listen to the stirring of rats in the thatch and look for snakes in the grass ; he must trust few , and least of all those who sleep upon his bosom . But those who have the Lion 's blood in them or who are prone to charge like a buffalo , often neglect these matters and therefore in the end they fall into a pit . "
16552	16555	16556	16556	I	0	" Yes , "
16559	16579	16556	16556	I	0	" especially those who have the lion 's blood in them , whether that lion be man or beast . "
16613	16616	16607	16607	he	544	" lion , "
16670	16688	16667	16667	he	544	" Why do you come to visit me , Macumazahn , who have never done so before ? "
16689	16736	16667	16667	he	544	" I do not come to visit you , Umslopogaas . That was not my intention . You brought me , or rather the flooded rivers and you together brought me , for I was on my way to Natal and could not cross the drifts . "
16737	16779	16667	16667	he	544	" Yet I think you have a message for me , White Man , for not long ago a certain wandering witch - doctor who came here told me to expect you and that you had words to say to me . "
16780	16809	16667	16667	he	544	" Did he , Umslopogaas ? Well , it is true that I have a message , though it is one that I did not mean to deliver . "
16810	16839	16667	16667	he	544	" Yet being here , perchance you will deliver it , Macumazahn , for those who have messages and will not speak them , sometimes come to trouble . "
16840	16896	16667	16667	he	544	" Yes , being here , I will deliver it , seeing that so it seems to be fated . Tell me , do you chance to know a certain Small One who is great , a certain Old One whose brain is young , a doctor who is called Opener - of - Roads ? "
16897	16911	16667	16667	he	544	" I have heard of him , as have my forefathers for generations . "
16912	16965	16667	16667	he	544	" Indeed , and if it pleases you to tell me , Umslopogaas , what might be the names of those forefathers of yours , who have heard of this doctor for generations ? They must have been short - lived men and as such I should like to know of them . "
16966	16972	16974	16974	Umslopogaas	125	" That you can not , "
16991	16991	16667	16667	he	544	"
16992	16995	16996	16996	I	0	" Indeed , "
17000	17036	16996	16996	I	0	" I thought that rule applied only to the names of kings , but of course I am but an ignorant white man who may well be mistaken on such matters of your Zulu customs . "
17037	17065	17110	17110	him	125	" Yes , O Macumazahn , you may be mistaken or - you may not . It matters nothing . But what of this message of yours ? "
17066	17102	16996	16996	I	0	" It came at the end of a long story , O Bulalio . But since you seek to know , these were the words of it , so nearly as I can remember them . "
17172	17177	17178	17178	he	125	" Lousta ! Monazi ! "
17182	17234	17235	17235	he	125	" Well , you heard those names to - day , did you not , White Man ? And you heard certain things from the lips of this Monazi who was angry , that give colour to that talk of the Opener - of - Roads . It seems to me , "
17248	17263	17235	17235	he	125	" that what I suspected is true and that without doubt I am betrayed . "
17264	17270	17271	17271	I	0	" I do not understand , "
17275	17310	17271	17271	I	0	" All this talk is dark to me , as is the message of the Opener - of - Roads , or rather its meaning . By whom and about what are you betrayed ? "
17311	17366	17235	17235	he	125	" Let that snake sleep . Do not kick it with your foot . Suffice it you to know that my head hangs upon this matter ; that I am a rat in a forked stick , and if the stick is pressed on by a heavy hand , then where is the rat ? "
17367	17398	17271	17271	I	0	" Where all rats go , I suppose , that is , unless they are wise rats that bite the hand which holds the stick before it is pressed down . "
17399	17446	17235	17235	he	125	" What is the rest of this story of yours , Macumazahn , which was told before the Opener - of - Roads gave you that message ? Does it please you to repeat it to me that I may judge of it with my ears ? "
17447	17450	17451	17451	I	0	" Certainly , "
17454	17473	17451	17451	I	0	" on one condition , that what the ears hear , the heart shall keep to itself alone . "
17492	17511	17478	17478	his	125	" By the Axe I swear it . If I break the oath be the Axe my doom . "
17594	17599	17600	17600	he	125	" It stands thus , "
17607	17742	17600	17600	he	125	" or so I think . You , Macumazahn , seek certain women who are dead to learn whether they still live , or are really dead , but so far have failed to find them . Still seeking , you asked the counsel of Zikali , Opener - of - Roads , he who among other titles is also called ' Home of Spirits . ' He answered that he could not satisfy your heart because this tree was too tall for him to climb , but that far to the north there lives a certain white witch who has powers greater than his , being able to fly to the top of any tree , and to this white witch he bade you go . Have I the story right thus far ? "
17749	17861	17600	17600	he	125	" Good ! Then Zikali went on to choose you companions for your journey , but two , leaving out the guards or servants . I , Umhlopekazi , called Bulalio the Slaughterer , called the Woodpecker also , was one of these , and that little yellow monkey of a man whom I saw with you to - day , called Hansi , was the other . Then you made a mock of Zikali by determining not to visit me , Umhlopekazi , and not to go north to find the great white Queen of whom he had told you , but to return to Natal . Is that so ? "
17867	17930	17600	17600	he	125	" Then the rain fell and the winds blew and the rivers rose in wrath so that you could not return to Natal , and after all by chance , or by fate , or by the will of Zikali , the wizard of wizards , you drifted here to the kraal of me , Umhlopekazi , and told me this story . "
17931	17935	17936	17936	I	0	" Just so , "
17939	18037	17600	17600	he	125	" Well , White Man , how am I to know that all this is not but a trap for my feet which already seem to feel cords between the toes of both of them ? What token do you bring , O Watcher - by - Night ? How am I to know that the Opener - of - Roads really sent me this message which has been delivered so strangely by one who wished to travel on another path ? The wandering witch - doctor told me that he who came would bear some sign . "
18038	18044	18045	18045	I	0	" I ca n't say , "
18048	18056	18057	18057	I	0	" at least in words . But , "
18062	18095	18057	18057	I	0	" as you ask for a token , perhaps I might be able to show you something that would bring proof to your heart , if there were any secret place - - "
18135	18191	18115	18115	he	552	" Once I was caught thus . There lived a certain wife of mine who set her ear to the smoke - hole and so brought about the death of many , and among them of herself and of our children . Enter . All is safe . Yet if you talk , speak low . "
18223	18226	18227	18227	he	552	" Now , "
18283	18286	18276	18276	he	552	" Makosi ! "
18307	18318	18319	18319	he	552	" It is the big Medicine , the Medicine itself , "
18322	18354	18319	18319	he	552	" that which has been known in the land since the time of Senzangacona , the father of the Zulu Royal House , and as it is said , before him . "
18355	18361	18362	18362	I	0	" How can that be ? "
18391	18391	18385	18385	Senzangacona	146	"
18392	18398	18399	18399	he	552	" I do not know , "
18402	18446	18448	18448	he	552	" but it is so . Listen . There was a certain Mopo , or as some called him , Umbopo , who was Chaka 's body - servant and my foster - father , and he told me that twice this Medicine , "
18454	18495	18448	18448	he	552	" was sent to Chaka , and that each time the Lion obeyed the message that came with it . A third time it was sent , but he did not obey the message and then - where was Chaka ? "
18512	18515	18516	18516	I	0	" Mopo , "
18519	18571	18516	18516	I	0	" yes , I have heard the story of Mopo , also that Chaka 's body became his servant in the end , since Mopo killed him with the help of the princes Dingaan and Umhlangana . Also I have heard that this Mopo still lives , though not in Zululand . "
18572	18578	18580	18580	Umslopogaas	125	" Does he , Macumazahn ? "
18596	18614	18580	18580	Umslopogaas	125	" You seem to know a great deal , Macumazahn ; too much as some might think . "
18615	18618	18619	18619	I	0	" Yes , "
18622	18667	18619	18619	I	0	" perhaps I do know too much , or at any rate more than I want to know . For instance , O fosterling of Mopo and son of - was the lady named Baleka ? - I know a good deal about you . "
18690	18696	18698	18698	I	0	" I think that this , "
18708	18722	18723	18723	I	0	" would turn even the blade of the axe named Groan - maker , "
18736	18816	18732	18732	I	0	" For instance , again I think I know - or have I dreamed it ? - that a certain chief , whose mother 's name I believe was Baleka - by the way , was she not one of Chaka 's ' sisters ' ? - has been plotting against that son of Panda who sits upon the throne , and that his plots have been betrayed , so that he is in some danger of his life . "
18817	18820	18822	18822	Umslopogaas	125	" Macumazahn , "
18825	18866	18822	18822	Umslopogaas	125	" I tell you that did you not wear the Great Medicine on your breast , I would kill you where you sit and bury you beneath the floor of the hut , as one who knows - too much . "
18867	18902	18732	18732	I	0	" It would be a mistake , Umslopogaas , one of the many that you have made . But as I do wear the Medicine , the question does not arise , does it ? "
18913	18939	18909	18909	I	0	" And now , what about this journey to the north ? If indeed I must make it , would you wish to accompany me ? "
19004	19007	19008	19008	he	125	" Macumazahn , "
19011	19051	19008	19008	he	125	" we speak under the blanket of the Opener - of - Roads who sits upon your heart , and whose sign you bring to me , as he sent me word that you would , do we not ? "
19052	19057	19058	19058	I	0	" I suppose so , "
19061	19113	19008	19008	he	125	" At any rate we speak as man to man , and hitherto the honour of Macumazahn has not been doubted in Zululand . So if you have anything to say , Chief Bulalio , say it at once , for I am tired and should like to eat and rest . "
19114	19271	19008	19008	he	125	" Good , Macumazahn . I have this to say . I who am the son of one who was greater than he , have plotted to seize the throne of Zululand from him who sits upon that throne . It is true , for I grew weary of my idleness as a petty chief . Moreover , I should have succeeded with the help of Zikali , who hates the House of Senzangacona , though me , who am of its blood , he does not hate , because ever I have striven against that House . But it seems from his message and those words spoken by an angry woman , that I have been betrayed , and that to - night or to - morrow night , or by the next moon , the slayers will be upon me , smiting me before I can smite , at which I can not grumble . "
19272	19282	19008	19008	he	125	" By whom have you been betrayed , Umslopogaas ? "
19283	19358	19008	19008	he	125	" By that wife of mine , as I think , Macumazahn . Also by Lousta , my blood - brother , over whom she has cast her net and made false to me , so that he hopes to win her whom he has always loved and with her the Chieftainship of the Axe . Now what shall I do ? - Tell me , you whose eyes can see in the dark . "
19366	19441	19359	19359	I	0	" I think that if I were you , I would leave this Lousta to sit in my place for a while as Chief of the People of the Axe , and take a journey north , Umslopogaas . Then if trouble comes from the Great House where a king sits , it will come to Lousta who can show that the People of the Axe are innocent and that you are far away . "
19442	19515	19008	19008	he	125	" That is cunning , Macumazahn . There speaks the Great Medicine . If I go north , who can say that I have plotted , and if I leave my betrayer in my place , who can say that I was a traitor , who have set him where I used to sit and left the land upon a private matter ? And now tell me of this journey of yours . "
19566	19755	19759	19759	I	0	" You wish to consult a white witch - doctoress , Macumazahn , who according to Zikali lives far to the north , as to the dead . Now I too , though perchance you will not think it of a black man , desire to learn of the dead ; yes , of a certain wife of my youth who was sister and friend as well as wife , whom too I loved better than all the world . Also I desire to learn of a brother of mine whose name I never speak , who ruled the wolves with me and who died at my side on yonder Witch - Mountain , having made him a mat of men to lie on in a great and glorious fight . For of him as of the woman I think all day and dream all night , and I would know if they still live anywhere and I may look to see them again when I have died as a warrior should and as I hope to do . Do you understand , Watcher - by - Night ? "
19774	19779	19782	19782	Umslopogaas	125	" It may happen , "
19784	19960	19782	19782	Umslopogaas	125	" that all this talk of the dead who are supposed to live after they are dead , is but as the sound of wind whispering in the reeds at night , that comes from nowhere and goes nowhere and means nothing . But at least ours will be a great journey in which we shall find adventure and fighting , since it is well known in the land that wherever Macumazahn goes there is plenty of both . Also it seems well for reasons that have been spoken of between us , as Zikali says , that I should leave the country of the Zulus for a while , who desire to die a man 's death at the last and not to be trapped like a jackal in a pit . Lastly I think that we shall agree well together though my temper is rough at times , and that neither of us will desert the other in trouble , though of that little yellow dog of yours I am not so sure . "
19961	19967	19968	19968	I	0	" I answer for him , "

But , Macumazahn , you are not so clever as I thought , since otherwise you would not have come out against a lion with a toy like that , "
23321	23334	23311	23311	he	125	" I did not know that there was a lion , Umslopogaas . "
23335	23370	23311	23311	he	125	" That is why you are not so clever as I thought , since of one sort or another there is always a lion which wise men should be prepared to meet , Macumazahn . "

27052	27106	27041	27041	he	741	" will want food as well . I 'll have a beast killed for them ; they look as if they could eat it , horns and all . Where are my people ? All asleep , I suppose , the lazy lubbers . Wait a bit , I 'll wake them up . "
27288	27292	27278	27278	him	753	" that nigger , "
27381	27385	27386	27386	I	0	" Captain Robertson , "
27389	27457	27386	27386	I	0	" I wish to give you a hint to be passed on to Mr. Thomaso , if that is he . He spoke of the Zulu soldier there as a nigger , etc . Well , he is a chief of a high rank and rather a terrible fellow if roused . Therefore I recommend Mr. Thomaso not to let him understand that he is insulting him . "
27458	27484	27486	27487	the Captain	765	" Oh ! that 's the way of these ' snuff - and - butters ' one of whose grandmothers once met a white man , "
27491	27498	27500	27500	he	765	" but I 'll tell him , "
27531	27599	27527	27528	the Captain	765	" Señor Thomaso - he calls himself Señor - is my manager here and a clever man , honest too in his way and attached to me , perhaps because I saved his life once . But he has a nasty temper , as have all these cross - breeds , so I hope he wo n't get wrong with that native who carries a big axe . "
27600	27611	27612	27612	I	0	" I hope so too , for his own sake , "
27950	27953	27942	27942	I	0	" Hunter Quatermain "
28031	28040	28041	28041	he	765	" That might be managed , Mr. Quatermain , "
28044	28145	28041	28041	he	765	" But , man , will you ever return ? They say there are queer folk living on the other side of the Zambesi , savage men who are cannibals , Amahagger I think they call them . It was they who in past years cleaned out all this country , except a few river tribes who live in floating huts or on islands among the reeds , and that 's why it is so empty . But this happened long ago , much before my time , and I do n't suppose they will ever cross the river again . "
28146	28159	28160	28160	I	0	" If I might ask , what brought you here , Captain ? "
28174	28258	28041	28041	he	765	" That which brings most men to wild places , Mr. Quatermain - trouble . If you want to know , I had a misfortune and piled up my ship . There were some lives lost and , rightly or wrongly , I got the sack . Then I started as a trader in a God - forsaken hole named Chinde , one of the Zambesi mouths , you know , and did very well , as we Scotchmen have a way of doing .
28259	28397	28041	28041	he	765	" There I married a Portuguese lady , a real lady of high blood , one of the old sort . When my girl , Inez , was about twelve years old I got into more trouble , for my wife died and it pleased a certain relative of hers to say that it was because I had neglected her . This ended in a row and the truth is that I killed him - in fair fight , mind you . Still , kill him I did though I scarcely knew that I had done it at the time , after which the place grew too hot to hold me . So I sold up and swore that I would have no more to do with what they are pleased to call civilisation on the East Coast .
28398	28504	28041	28041	he	765	" During my trading I had heard that there was fine country up this way , and here I came and settled years ago , bringing my girl and Thomaso , who was one of my managers , also a few other people with me . And here I have been ever since , doing very well as before , for I trade a lot of ivory and other things and grow stuff and cattle , which I sell to the River natives . Yes , I am a rich man now and could go to live on my means in Scotland , or anywhere . "
28505	28511	28512	28512	I	0	" Why do n't you ? "
28515	28592	28594	28594	he	791	" Oh ! for many reasons . I have lost touch with all that and become half wild and I like this life and the sunshine and being my own master . Also , if I did , things might be raked up against me , about that man 's death . Also , though I daresay it will make you think badly of me for it , Mr. Quatermain , I have ties down there , "
28609	28681	28683	28683	he	791	" which it would n't be easy for me to break . A man may be fond of his children , Mr. Quatermain , even if their skins ai n't so white as they ought to be . Lastly I have habits - you see , I am speaking out to you as man to man - which might get me into trouble again if I went back to the world , "
28702	28706	28707	28707	I	0	" I see , "
28740	28750	28707	28707	I	0	" But how about your daughter , Miss Inez ? "
28751	28754	28755	28755	he	791	" Ah ! "
28765	28913	28914	28914	he	794	" there you touch it . She ought to go away . There is no one for her to marry here , where we have n't seen a white man for years , and she 's a lady right enough , like her mother . But who is she to go to , being a Roman Catholic whom my own dour Presbyterian folk in Scotland , if any of them are left , would turn their backs on ? Moreover , she loves me in her own fashion , as I love her , and she would n't leave me because she thinks it her duty to stay and knows that if she did , I should go to the devil altogether . Still - perhaps you might help me about her , Mr. Quatermain , that is if you live to come back from your journey , "
28955	29023	28951	28951	he	794	" Now I think I will have a nap , as I do my work in the early morning , and sometimes late at night when my brain seems to clear up again , for you see I was a sailor for many years and accustomed to keeping watches . You 'll look after yourself , wo n't you , and treat the place as your own ? "
29169	29182	29184	29184	Hans	87	" Those children are very like the Baas with the red beard , "
29187	29190	29191	29191	I	0	" Yes , "
29393	29407	29409	29411	the observant Hans	826	" This red - bearded Baas must be very rich in all things , "
29419	29422	29423	29423	I	0	" Yes , "
29426	29432	29423	29423	I	0	" rich and yet poor . "
29433	29447	29449	29449	Hans	87	" How can a man be both rich and yet poor , Baas ? "
29488	29520	29480	29480	Hans	87	" I think I understand now , Baas . A man may be rich in things he loves and yet does not want , which makes him poor in other ways . "
29521	29524	29525	29525	I	0	" Yes , "
29528	29543	29525	29525	I	0	" as you are , Hans , when you take too much to drink . "
29609	29618	29619	29619	I	0	" Your father must do very well here , "
29634	29637	29638	29638	she	832	" Yes , "
29641	29686	29687	29687	she	832	" he makes much money which he puts in a bank at the coast , for living costs us nothing and there is great profit in what he buys and sells , also in the crops he grows and in the cattle . But , "
29691	29704	29687	29687	she	832	" what is the use of money in a place like this ? "
29705	29713	29714	29714	I	0	" You can get things with it , "
29718	29823	29687	29687	she	832	" That is what my father says , but what does he get ? Strong stuff to drink ; dresses for those women down there , and sometimes pearls , jewels and other things for me which I do not want . I have a box full of them set in ugly gold , or loose which I can not use , and if I put them on , who is there to see them ? That clever half - breed , Thomaso - for he is clever in his way , faithful too - or the women down there - no one else . "
29824	29836	29687	29687	she	832	" You do not seem to be happy , Miss Inez . "
29837	29870	29687	29687	she	832	" No . I can not tell how unhappy others are , who have met none , but sometimes I think that I must be the most miserable woman in the world . "
29871	29876	29877	29877	I	0	" Oh ! no , "
29881	29887	29877	29877	I	0	" plenty are worse off . "
29888	29913	29687	29687	she	832	" Then , Mr. Quatermain , it must be because they can not feel . Did you ever have a father whom you loved ? "
29914	29953	29877	29877	I	0	" Yes , Miss Inez . He is dead , but he was a very good man , a kind of saint . Ask my servant , the little Hottentot Hans ; he will tell you about him . "
29954	30007	30009	30009	she	836	" Ah ! a very good man . Well , as you may have guessed , mine is not , though there is much good in him , for he has a kind heart , and a big brain . But the drink and those women down there , they ruin him , "
30014	30022	30023	30023	I	0	" Why do n't you go away ? "
30027	30202	30204	30204	she	837	" Because it is my duty to stop . That is what my religion teaches me , although of it I know little except through books , who have seen no priest for years except one who was a missionary , a Baptist , I think , who told me that my faith was false and would lead me to hell . Yes , not understanding how I lived , he said that , who did not know that hell is here . No , I can not go , who hopes always that still God and the Saints will show me how to save my father , even though it be with my blood . And now I have said too much to you who are quite a stranger . Yet , I do not know why , I feel that you will not betray me , and what is more , that you will help me if you can , since you are not one of those who drink , or - - "
30212	30221	30222	30222	I	0	" I have my faults , Miss Inez , "
30225	30280	30287	30287	her	837	" Yes , no doubt , else you would be a saint , not a man , and even the saints had their faults , or so I seem to remember , and became saints by repentance and conquering them . Still , I am sure that you will help me if you can . "
30603	30711	30596	30596	he	168	" at which Umslopogaas , who was as superstitious as the rest , assisted . So did Hans , although he called himself a Christian , partly out of curiosity , for he was as curious as a magpie , and partly from fear lest some implication should be brought against him in his absence . I saw the business going on from a little distance , and , unseen myself , thought it well to keep an eye upon the proceedings in case anything untoward should occur . This I did with Miss Inez , who had never witnessed anything of the sort , as a companion .

31139	31149	31151	31151	Inez	164	" What was it all about , Mr. Quatermain ? "
31153	31161	31162	31162	I	0	" Oh ! a lot of nonsense , "
31165	31189	31162	31162	I	0	" I fancy that witch - doctor declared that your friend Thomaso put something into those men 's food to make them sick . "
31190	31250	31254	31254	Umslopogaas	125	" I daresay that he did ; it would be just like him , Mr. Quatermain , as I know that he hates them , especially Umslopogaas , of whom I am very fond . He brought me some beautiful flowers this morning which he had found somewhere , and made a long speech which I could not understand . "
31309	31319	31320	31320	he	87	" Something rather queer , I think , Baas , "
31324	31395	31397	31397	he	87	" though I did not quite understand the last part . The doctor , Goroko , smelt out Thomaso as the man who had made them sick , and though they will not kill him because we are guests here , those Zulus are very angry with Thomaso and I think will beat him if they get a chance . But that is only the small half of the stick , "
31400	31409	31410	31410	I	0	" What is the big half , then ? "
31415	31424	31301	31301	Hans	87	" Baas , the Spirit in Goroko - - "
31425	31434	31435	31435	I	0	" The jackass in Goroko , you mean , "
31438	31464	31435	31435	I	0	" How can you , who are a Christian , talk such rubbish about spirits ? I only wish that my father could hear you . "
31465	31565	31301	31301	Hans	87	" Oh ! Baas , your reverend father , the Predikant , is now wise enough to know all about Spirits and that there are some who come into black witch - doctors though they turn up their noses at white men and leave them alone . However , whatever it is that makes Goroko speak , got hold of him so that his lips said , though he remembered nothing of it afterwards , that soon this place would be red with blood - that there would be a great killing here , Baas . That is all . "
31566	31580	31435	31435	I	0	" Red with blood ! Whose blood ? What did the fool mean ? "
31581	31648	31301	31301	Hans	87	" I do n't know , Baas , but what you call the jackass in Goroko , declared that those who are ' with the Great Medicine ' - meaning what you wear , Baas - will be quite safe . So I hope that it will not be our blood ; also that you will get out of this place as soon as you can . "
31692	31709	31710	31710	I	0	" What is it that Goroko has been saying and why do you smile , Bulalio ? "
31713	31798	31677	31677	Umslopogaas	125	" Nothing much , Macumazahn , except that the man who looks like tallow that has gone bad , put something in our food which made us sick , for which I would kill him were he not Red - beard 's servant and that it would frighten the lady his daughter . Also he said that soon there will be fighting , which is why I smiled , who grow weary of peace . We came out to fight , did we not ? "
31799	31803	31804	31804	I	0	" Certainly not , "
31807	31828	31804	31804	I	0	" We came out to make a quiet journey in strange lands , which is what I mean to do . "
31829	31858	31860	31860	he	869	" Ah ! well , Macumazahn , in strange lands one meets strange men with whom one does not always agree , and then Inkosikaas begins to talk , "
32461	32468	32469	32469	I	0	" Does your daughter accompany us ? "

32950	33032	33034	33034	he	915	" as though she were my grandmother , though what there is to fear for her , I do not know . But , Baas , I would much rather come and look after you , as your reverend father , the Predikant , told me to do always , which is my duty , not girl - herding , Baas . Also my foot is now quite well and - I want to shoot sea - cows , and - - "
33037	33043	33034	33034	he	915	" And what , Hans ? "
33044	33087	33034	33034	he	915	" And Goroko said that there was going to be much fighting and if there should be fighting and you should come to harm because I was not there to protect you , what would your reverend father think of me then ? "
33258	33276	33277	33277	I	0	" You will stop here , Hans , look after the young lady and nurse your foot , "

36991	37067	36985	36985	he	87	" a terrible thing has come about at the farm of Red - Beard yonder . Yesterday afternoon at the time when people are in the habit of sleeping there till the sun grows less hot , a body of great men with fierce faces who carried big spears - perhaps there were fifty of them , Baas - crept up to the place through the long grass and growing crops , and attacked it . "
37068	37075	37076	37076	I	0	" Did you see them come ? "
37079	37131	36985	36985	he	87	" No , Baas . I was watching at a little distance as you bade me do and the sun being hot , I shut my eyes to keep out the glare of it , so that I did not see them until they had passed me and heard the noise . "
37132	37148	36985	36985	he	87	" You mean that you were asleep or drunk , Hans , but go on . "
37149	37157	37158	37158	he	1063	" Baas , I do not know , "
37162	37181	37158	37158	he	1063	" but after that I climbed a tall tree with a kind of bush at the top of it "
37196	37207	37182	37182	I	0	" and from it I saw everything without being seen . "
37208	37216	37217	37217	I	0	" What did you see , Hans ? "
37221	37312	37182	37182	I	0	" I saw the big men run up and make a kind of circle round the village . Then they shouted , and the people in the village came out to see what was the matter . Thomaso and some of the men caught sight of them first and ran away fast into the hillside at the back where the trees grow , before the circle was complete . Then the women and the children came out and the big men killed them with their spears - all , all ! "
37313	37317	37318	37318	I	0	" Good God ! "
37321	37333	37318	37318	I	0	" And what happened at the house and to the lady ? "
37334	37457	37182	37182	I	0	" Baas , some of the men had surrounded that also and when she heard the noise the lady Sad - Eyes came out on to the stoep and with her came the two Zulus of the Axe who had been left sick but were now quite recovered . A number of the big men ran as though to take her , but the two Zulus made a great fight in front of the little steps to the stoep , having their backs protected by the stoep , and killed six of them before they themselves were killed . Also Sad - Eyes shot one with a pistol she carried , and wounded another so that the spear fell out of his hand .
37458	37586	37318	37318	I	0	" Then the rest fell on her and tied her up , setting her in a chair on the stoep where two remained to watch her . They did her no hurt , Baas ; indeed , they seemed to treat her as gently as they could . Also they went into the house and there they caught that tall fat yellow girl who always smiles and is called Janee , she who waits upon the Lady Sad - Eyes , and brought her out to her . I think they told her , Baas , that she must look after her mistress and that if she tried to run away she would be killed , for afterwards I saw Janee bring her food and other things . "
37587	37593	37182	37182	I	0	" And then , Hans ? "
37594	37677	37318	37318	I	0	" Then , Baas , most of the great men rested a while , though some of them went through the store gathering such things as they liked , blankets , knives and iron cooking - pots , but they set fire to nothing , nor did they try to catch the cattle . Also they took dry wood from the pile and lit big fires , eight or nine of them , and when the sun set they began to feast . "
37678	37693	37694	37694	I	0	" What did they feast on , Hans , if they took no cattle ? "
37710	37713	37715	37715	Hans	87	" Baas , "
37727	37756	37715	37715	Hans	87	" they feasted on the children whom they had killed , also on some of the young women . These tall soldiers are men - eaters , Baas . "
37788	37796	37797	37797	he	87	" They feasted quite nicely , Baas , "
37800	37925	37797	37797	he	87	" making no noise . Then some of them slept while others watched , and that went on all night . As soon as it was dark , but before the moon rose , I slid down the tree and crept round to the back of the house without being seen or heard , as I can , Baas . I got into the house by the back door and crawled to the window of the sitting - room . It was open and peeping through I saw Sad - Eyes still tied to the seat on the stoep not more than a pace away , while the girl Janee crouched on the floor at her feet - I think she was asleep or fainting .
37926	38136	37780	37780	him	87	" I made a little noise , like a night - adder hissing , and kept on making it , till at last Sad - Eyes turned her head . Then I spoke in a very low whisper , for fear lest I should wake the two guards who were dozing on either side of her wrapped in their blankets , saying , ' It is I , Hans , come to help you . ' ' You can not , ' she answered , also speaking very low . ' Get to your master and tell him and my father to follow . These men are called Amahagger and live far away across the river . They are going to take me to their home , as I understand , to rule them , because they want a white woman to be a queen over them who have always been ruled by a certain white queen , against whom they have rebelled . I do not think they mean to do me any harm , unless perhaps they want to marry me to their chief , but of this I am not sure from their talk which I understand badly . Now go , before they catch you . '
38137	38173	37797	37797	he	87	" ' I think you might get away , ' I whispered back . ' I will cut your bonds . When you are free , slip through the window and I will guide you . '
38174	38185	37780	37780	him	87	" ' Very well , try it , ' she said .
38186	38364	37797	37797	he	87	" So I drew my knife and stretched out my arm . But then , Baas , I showed myself a fool - if the Great Medicine had still been there I might have known better . I forgot the starlight which shone upon the blade of the knife . That girl Janee came out of her sleep or swoon , lifted her head and saw the knife . She screamed once , then at a word from her mistress was silent . But it was enough , for it woke up the guards who glared about them and threatened Janee with their great spears , also they went to sleep no more , but began to talk together , though what they said I could not hear , for I was hiding on the floor of the room . After this , knowing that I could do no good and might do harm and get myself killed , I crept out of the house as I had crept in , and crawled back to my tree . "
38365	38374	38375	38375	I	0	" Why did you not come to me ? "
38378	38436	37797	37797	he	87	" Because I still hoped I might be able to help Sad - Eyes , Baas . Also I wanted to see what happened , and I knew that I could not bring you here in time to be any good . Yet it is true I thought of coming though I did not know the road . "
38437	38443	37797	37797	he	87	" Perhaps you were right . "
38444	38450	38452	38452	Hans	87	" At the first dawn , "
38454	38658	38452	38452	Hans	87	" the great men who are called Amahagger rose and ate what was left over from the night before . Then they gathered themselves together and went to the house . Here they found a large chair , that seated with rimpis in which the Baas Red - Beard sits , and lashed two poles to the chair . Beneath the chair they tied the garments and other things of the Lady Sad - Eyes which they made Janee gather as Sad - Eyes directed her . This done , very gently they sat Sad - Eyes herself in the chair , bowing while they made her fast . After this eight of them set the poles upon their shoulders , and they all went away at a trot , heading for the bush - veld , driving with them a herd of goats which they had stolen from the farm , and making Janee run by the chair . I saw everything , Baas , for they passed just beneath my tree . Then I came to seek you , following the outward spoor of the waggons which I could not have done well at night . That is all , Baas . "
38659	38662	38663	38663	I	0	" Hans , "
38666	38725	38663	38663	I	0	" you have been drinking and because of it the lady Sad - Eyes is taken a prisoner by cannibals ; for had you been awake and watching , you might have seen them coming and saved her and the rest . Still , afterwards you did well , and for the rest you must answer to Heaven . "
38726	38780	38782	38782	Hans	87	" I must tell your reverend father , the Predikant , Baas , that the white master , Red - Beard , gave me the liquor and it is rude not to do as a great white master does , and drink it up . I am sure he will understand , Baas , "
38823	38828	38830	38830	Umslopogaas	125	" Did you say , "
38838	38851	38830	38830	Umslopogaas	125	" that my servants killed only six of these men - eaters ? "
38857	38867	38852	38852	Hans	87	" Yes , six . I counted the bodies . "
38868	38881	38883	38883	Umslopogaas	125	" It was ill done , they should have killed six each , "
38886	38899	38901	38901	he	125	" Well , they have left the more for us to finish , "
39201	39303	39305	39305	he	765	" That 's a pretty story , Quatermain , which this little yellow monkey has been gibbering at me . Man , do you understand what he says ? He says that all those half - blood children of mine are dead , murdered by savages from over the Zambesi , yes , and eaten , too , with their mothers . Do you take the point ? Eaten like lambs . Those fires your man saw last night were the fires on which they were cooked , my little so - and - so and so - and - so , "
39313	39424	39305	39305	he	765	" Yes , cooked , Quatermain . And that is n't all of it , they have taken Inez too . They did n't eat her , but they have dragged her off a captive for God knows what reason . I could n't understand . The whole ship 's crew is gone , except the captain absent on leave and the first officer , Thomaso , who deserted with some Lascar stokers , and left the women and children to their fate . My God , I 'm going mad . I 'm going mad ! If you have any mercy in you , give me something to drink . "
39425	39429	39430	39430	I	0	" All right , "
39433	39444	39430	39430	I	0	" I will . Sit here and wait a minute . "
39589	39593	39583	39583	he	1072	" What now ? "
39594	39601	39602	39602	I	0	" Vengeance , or rather justice , "
39605	39608	39609	39609	he	1072	" Yes , "
39612	39629	39609	39609	he	1072	" vengeance . I swear that I will be avenged , or die - or both . "
39638	39691	39631	39631	I	0	" You must swear more than that , Robertson . Only sober men can accomplish great things , for drink destroys the judgment . If you wish to be avenged for the dead and to rescue the living , you must be sober , or I for one will not help you . "
39692	39711	39712	39712	he	1072	" Will you help me if I do , to the end , good or ill , Quatermain ? "
39718	39728	39729	39729	he	1072	" That 's as much as another 's oath , "
39732	39806	39729	39729	he	1072	" Still , I will put my thought in words . I swear by God , by my mother - like these natives - and by my daughter born in honest marriage , that I will never touch another drop of strong drink , until I have avenged those poor women and their little children , and rescued Inez from their murderers . If I do you may put a bullet through me . "
39807	39813	39814	39814	I	0	" That 's all right , "
39848	39921	39839	39839	I	0	" Now let us get to business . The first thing to do is to trek to Strathmuir and make preparations ; the next to start upon the trail . Come to sit on the waggon with me and tell me what guns and ammunition you have got , for according to Hans those savages do n't seem to have touched anything , except a few blankets and a herd of goats . "
39939	40181	39936	39936	he	1075	" It is a strange thing , but now I recall that about two years ago a great savage with a high nose , who talked a sort of Arabic which , like Inez , I understand , having lived on the coast , turned up one day and said he wanted to trade . I asked him what in , and he answered that he would like to buy some children . I told him that I was not a slave - dealer . Then he looked at Inez , who was moving about , and said that he would like to buy her to be a wife for his Chief , and offered some fabulous sum in ivory and in gold , which he said should be paid before she was taken away . I snatched his big spear from his hand , broke it over his head and gave him the best hiding with its shaft that he had ever heard of . Then I kicked him off the place . He limped away but when he was out of reach , turned and called out that one day he would come again with others and take her , meaning Inez , without leaving the price in ivory and gold . I ran for my gun , but when I got back he had gone and I never thought of the matter again from that day to this . "
40182	40190	40191	40191	I	0	" Well , he kept his promise , "
40709	40715	40716	40716	I	0	" Let the man go , "
40721	40730	40716	40716	I	0	" Is there not enough death here already ? "
40731	40734	40758	40758	he	125	" Yes , "
40738	40756	40758	40758	he	125	" I think there is . Best that this jackal should live to eat his own shame , "
41070	41076	41077	41077	I	0	" Hans is making coffee , "
41081	41085	41086	41086	he	161	" Thank you , "
41089	41100	41086	41086	he	161	" I forgot . Force of habit , you know . "
41705	41707	41688	41688	they	1124	" killed "
41734	41743	41744	41744	he	168	" O Father and Chief of the Axe , "
41769	41778	41744	41744	he	168	" O Father , O Son of the Heavens "
41808	41893	41940	41941	the speaker	1132	" O Slaughterer Bulalio , O Woodpecker who picks at the hearts of men ; O King - Slayer ; O Conqueror of the Halakazi ; O Victor in a hundred fights ; O Gatherer of the Lily - bloom that faded in the hand ; O Wolf - man , Captain of the Wolves that ravened ; O Slayer of Faku ; O Great One whom it pleases to seem small , because he must follow his blood to the end appointed - - "
41903	41906	41998	41998	he	1132	" bonga -ing "
41945	41996	41998	41998	he	1132	" It was told to me , though of it I remember nothing , that when my Spirit was in me a while ago I prophesied that this place would flow with blood , and lo ! the blood has flowed , and with it that of these our brothers , "
42017	42147	41998	41998	he	1132	" It seems , Father , that they died well , as you would have wished them to die , and as doubtless they desired to die themselves , leaving a tale behind them , though it is true that they might have died better , killing more of the men - eaters , as it is certain they would have done , had they not been sick inside . They are finished ; they have gone beyond to await us in the Under - world among the ghosts . Their story is told and soon to their children they will be but names whispered in honour after the sun has set . Enough of them who have showed us how to die as our fathers did before them . "
42162	42202	42159	42159	his	168	" My Spirit comes to me again and I know that these our brothers shall not pass unavenged . Chief of the Axe , great glory awaits the Axe , for it shall feed full . I have spoken . "
42203	42207	42212	42212	he	168	" Good words ! "
42310	42371	42282	42282	them	1137	" - that is , to have suffered and recovered from every kind of sickness , including the bite of the deadly tsetse fly . I suspected , it is true , that they would not be proof against further attacks , still , I hoped that they would last for some time , as indeed proved to be the case .
42769	42775	42777	42777	Umslopogaas	125	" Hearken , fat pig , "
42790	42920	42779	42779	Hans	87	" if I come back , and come back I shall who travel with the Great Medicine - and find even one of the cattle of the white lord , Macumazahn , Watcher - by - Night , missing , or one article stolen from his waggon , or the fields of your master not cultivated or his goods wasted , I swear by the Axe that I will hew you into pieces with the axe ; yes , if to do it I have to hunt you from where the sun rises to where it sets and down the length of the night between . Do you understand , fat pig , deserter of women and children , who to save yourself could run faster than a buck ? "
43809	43815	43819	43820	the man	324	" was not worth eating . "
43882	43887	43888	43889	Her grandfathers	1202	" ruled the world . "
44870	44879	44880	44880	he	87	" I fear my poor lassie is gone , "
44894	44906	44907	44907	I	0	" Never say die ! It 's dogged as does it ! "
45605	45611	45612	45612	I	0	" Look here , Captain , "
45615	45675	45612	45612	I	0	" if we were at sea and you did something of the sort , I should not put such a question to you , and if by any chance I did , I should not expect you to answer . Well , by your own wish I am in command here and I think that the same argument holds . "
45676	45679	45680	45680	he	161	" Yes , "
45683	45720	45680	45680	he	161	" I suppose you have studied your chart , if there is any of this God - forsaken country , and at any rate discipline is discipline . So steam ahead and do n't mind me . "
45757	45764	45766	45766	Hans	87	" Doubtless the Baas has reasons , "
45769	45807	45766	45766	Hans	87	" although the spoor , when last we saw it , headed towards the rising sun and as the country is all the same , I do not see why those man - eaters should have returned . "
45808	45811	45812	45812	I	0	" Yes , "
45815	45820	45812	45812	I	0	" I have reasons , "
45855	45861	45863	45863	Hans	87	" The Baas has reasons , "
45865	45995	45863	45863	Hans	87	" for taking us on what I think to be the wrong side of that great ridge , there to hunt for the spoor of the men - eaters , and they are so deep down in his mind that he can not dig them up for poor old Hans to look at . Well , the Baas wears the Great Medicine and perhaps it is there that the reasons sit . Those Strathmuir fellows say that they can go no further and wish to die . Umslopogaas has just gone to them with his axe to tell them that he is ready to help them to their wish . Look , he has got there , for they are coming quickly , who after all prefer to live . "

46657	46661	46654	46654	he	87	" on toast , "
46737	46745	46746	46746	I	0	" There is my reason , Hans , "
46777	46784	46785	46785	I	0	" You will perceive , Hans , "
46788	46887	46785	46785	I	0	" that those Amahagger cannibals have forgotten their caution and lit a fire yonder , which they have not done for a long time . Perhaps you would like to know why this has happened . If so I will tell you . It is because for some days past I have purposely lost their spoor , which they knew we were following , and lit fires to puzzle them . Now , thinking that they have done with us , they have become incautious and shown us where they are . That is my reason , Hans . "
46943	46970	46971	46971	he	1289	" How wonderful is the Great Medicine of the Opener - of - Roads , that it should have been able thus to instruct the Baas , "
46974	47006	46971	46971	he	1289	" Without doubt the Great Medicine is right and yonder those men - eaters are encamped , who might just as well as have been anywhere else within a hundred miles . "
47007	47013	47014	47014	I	0	" Drat the Great Medicine , "
47026	47070	47014	47014	I	0	" Be so good , Hans , as to go to Umslopogaas and to tell him that Macumazahn , or the Great Medicine , proposes to march at once to attack the camp of the Amahagger , and - here is some tobacco . "
47071	47076	47082	47082	he	1289	" Yes , Baas , "
47709	47712	47713	47713	I	0	" Yes , "
47726	47762	47713	47713	I	0	" I have no doubt you would - under the first bush you came across , where you would sleep till dawn , and then return and say that you could not find the Amahagger . "
47984	47994	47978	47978	Hans	87	" Look to the right between those twin thorns . "
48059	48074	48076	48076	Hans	87	" The fire of which we saw the smoke that has burnt to ashes , "
48079	48092	48076	48076	Hans	87	" I think that they have gone , but let us look . "
48196	48208	48180	48180	he	87	" Amahagger there all right , Baas , I smell them . "
49169	49205	49157	49157	he	87	" Those men are fast asleep , I know it by their breathing . Also the Baas has the Great Medicine . Therefore I say go on , kill them and rescue Sad - Eyes . "
50393	50400	50401	50401	I	0	" Make no noise , Inez , "
50404	50427	50401	50401	I	0	" It is I , Allan Quatermain , come to rescue you . Slip out and follow me ; do you understand ? "
50428	50433	50434	50434	she	159	" Yes , quite , "
50610	50628	50608	50608	her	159	" Feign sleep and know nothing . We will follow you . Your father is with us . "
50667	50693	50661	50661	Hans	87	" The Great Medicine worked well , Baas , but not quite well enough , for what medicine can avail against a woman 's folly ? "
50694	50704	50705	50705	I	0	" It was our own folly we should blame , "
50708	50725	50705	50705	I	0	" We ought to have known that fool - girl would shriek , and taken precautions . "
50726	50748	50750	50750	Hans	87	" Yes , Baas , we ought to have killed her too , for nothing else would have kept her quiet , "
50755	50773	50750	50750	Hans	87	" Now we shall have to pay for our mistake , for the hunt must go on . "
50832	50898	50828	50828	Umslopogaas	125	" Well , there are two less of the men - eaters left to deal with . Still , for once your wisdom failed you , Macumazahn . When you had found the camp you should have returned , so that we might all attack it together . Had we done so , before the dawn there would not have been one of them left . "
50899	50902	50903	50903	I	0	" Yes , "
50906	50933	50903	50903	I	0	" I think that my wisdom did fail me , if I have any to fail . But come ; perhaps we may catch them yet . "
52764	52771	52740	52740	they	101	" torn out of the reeds . "
53330	53335	53336	53336	he	104	" No , Baas , "
53339	53445	53336	53336	he	104	" but those Zulus have nothing to do with the Medicine which was given to you , and to me who accompanied you when we saw the Opener - of - Roads . Therefore perhaps they will all die , except Umslopogaas , whom you were told to take with you . If so , what does it matter , since there are plenty of Zulus , although there be but one Macumazahn or one Hans ? Also the Baas may remember that he began by offending a snake and therefore it is quite natural that this snake 's brother should have bitten the Zulu . "
53446	53460	53311	53311	his	104	" If you are right , he should have bitten me , Hans . "
53461	53523	53336	53336	he	104	" Yes , Baas , and so no doubt he would have done had you not been protected by the Great Medicine , and me too had not my grandfather been a snake - charmer , to say nothing of the smell of the Medicine being on me as well . The snakes know those that they should bite , Baas . "
53524	53530	53531	53531	I	0	" So do the mosquitoes , "
53540	53550	53531	53531	I	0	" The Great Medicine has no effect upon them . "
53551	53626	53336	53336	he	104	" Oh ! yes , Baas , it has , since though it pleases them to bite , the bites do us no harm , or at least not much , and all are made happy . Still , I wish we could get out of these reeds of which I never want to see another , and Baas , please keep your rifle ready for I think I hear a crocodile stirring there . "
53627	53633	53634	53634	I	0	" No need , Hans , "
53638	53650	53634	53634	I	0	" Go and tell him that I have the Great Medicine . "
53651	53680	53682	53682	he	1456	" Yes , Baas , I will ; also that if he is very hungry , there are some Zulus camped a few yards further down the road , "
53699	53704	53705	53705	I	0	" You infernal donkey ! "
54615	54620	54622	54622	Hans	87	" Umslopogaas expects battle , "
54629	54672	54622	54622	Hans	87	" otherwise with all this nice plain round us he would not have chosen to camp in a place which a few men could hold against many . Yes , Baas , he thinks that those cannibals are going to attack us . "
54673	54679	54680	54680	I	0	" Stranger things have happened , "
54737	54744	54745	54745	he	125	" A strange mountain , Macumazahn , "
54748	54817	54745	54745	he	125	" compared to it that of the Witch , beneath which my kraal lies , is but a little baby . I wonder what we shall find within it . I have always loved mountains , Macumazahn , ever since a dead brother of mine and I lived with the wolves in the Witch 's lap , for on them I have had the best of my fighting . "
54818	54827	54828	54828	I	0	" Perhaps it is not done with yet , "
54832	54932	54745	54745	he	125	" I hope not , Macumazahn , since some is due for us , after all these days of mud and stench . Sleep a while now , Macumazahn , for that head of yours which you use so much , must need rest . Fear not , I and the little yellow man who do not think as much as you do , will keep watch and wake you if there is need , as mayhap there will be before the dawn . Here none can come at us except in front , and the place is narrow . "
54996	55001	55002	55002	he	125	" Arise , Macumazahn , "
55005	55013	55002	55002	he	125	" I hear men stirring below us . "
55024	55047	55017	55017	Hans	87	" The cannibals are coming , Baas , a good number of them . I think they mean to attack before dawn . "
55068	55089	55063	55063	I	0	" If so , Hans , now is the time for your Great Medicine to show what it can do . "
55090	55105	55106	55106	he	87	" The Great Medicine will look after you and me all right , Baas , "
55121	55165	55166	55166	he	87	" but I expect there will be fewer of those Zulus to cook for before the sun grows hot . Their spirits will be turned into snakes and go back into the reeds from which they say they were ' torn out , ' "
55219	55230	55232	55232	Umslopogaas	125	" What is the little yellow man saying about us ? "
55235	55256	55257	55257	I	0	" He is saying that if it comes to battle , you and your men will make a great fight , "
55261	55287	55232	55232	Umslopogaas	125	" Yes , we will do that , Macumazahn , but I thought he said that we should be killed and that this pleased him . "
55288	55293	55294	55294	I	0	" Oh dear no ! "
55298	55336	55294	55294	I	0	" How could he be pleased if that happened , since then he would be left defenceless , if he were not killed too . Now , Umslopogaas , let us make a plan for this fight . "
55944	55953	55954	55954	he	87	" They are men - eaters , Baas , "
55957	55984	55954	55954	he	87	" and being hungry , wish to eat us before they get to their own land where doubtless they are not allowed to eat each other . "
55985	55991	55992	55992	I	0	" Do you think so , "
55995	56002	55992	55992	I	0	" when we are so thin ? "
56014	56109	56004	56004	I	0	" Oh ! yes , Baas , we should be quite good boiled - like old hens , Baas . Also it is the nature of cannibals to prefer thin man to fat beef . The devil that is in them gives them that taste , Baas , just as he makes me like gin , or you turn your head to look at pretty women , as those Zulus say you always did in their country , especially at a certain witch who was named Mameena and whom you kissed before everybody - - "
56181	56195	56173	56173	he	87	" Hush ! the dawn breaks and they come . I hear them . "
56246	56250	56251	56251	I	0	" Look out ! "
56259	56266	56251	56251	I	0	" I believe they are coming . "
56267	56270	56271	56271	he	87	" Man , "
56275	56292	56271	56271	he	87	" I hope so , for whom else have I wanted to meet all these days ? "
56419	56428	56429	56429	I	0	" We have been led into an ambush , "
56447	56462	56464	56465	the latter	1531	" If so , man , we must just do the best we can , "
56467	56495	56464	56465	the latter	1531	" but God help my poor daughter , for those other devils will have taken her away , leaving their brethren to make an end of us . "
56496	56503	56445	56445	Robertson	159	" It is so , Macumazahn , "
56508	56535	56445	56445	Robertson	159	" Well , whatever the end of it , we shall have a better fight . Now do you give the word and we will obey . "
56600	56603	56597	56597	I	0	" Fire ! "
57268	57271	57277	57277	his	125	" Now , "
57281	57315	57317	57317	he	125	" there remains but one thing to do , make a good end , though I would that it were in a greater cause . At least we must either fight or fly , "
57324	57332	57334	57336	one of them	3281	" Think not of us , Father , "
57346	57369	57334	57336	one of them	3281	" If it is best , kill us and begone that you may live to bear the Axe in years to come . "
57370	57374	57376	57376	Umslopogaas	125	" Well spoken ! "
57388	57402	57376	57376	Umslopogaas	125	" The word is with you , Macumazahn , who are our captain . "
57443	57451	57453	57454	the Captain	765	" Go if you like , Quatermain , "
57456	57478	57453	57454	the Captain	765	" but I shall stop and die here , for since my girl is gone I think I 'm better dead . "
57486	57489	57490	57490	he	87	" Baas , "
57493	57548	57490	57490	he	87	" the Great Medicine is here with us upon the earth and your reverend father , the Predikant , is with us in the sky , so I think we had better stop here and do what we can , especially as I do not want to see those reeds any more at present . "
57549	57554	57555	57555	I	0	" So do I , "
57655	57661	57662	57662	I	0	" There goes your daughter , "
57672	57678	57679	57679	he	161	" Oh ! my God , "
57682	57691	57679	57679	he	161	" those villains have outwitted us after all . "
57803	57808	57809	57809	I	0	" They are coming , "
57814	57817	57818	57818	he	161	" Yes , "
57821	57889	57818	57818	he	161	" they are coming and we are going . It 's a queer end to the thing we call life , is n't it , Quatermain , and hang it all ! I wonder what 's beyond ? Not much for me , I expect , but whatever it is could scarcely be worse than what I 've gone through here below in one way and another . "
57890	57899	57900	57900	I	0	" There 's hope for all of us , "
57917	58010	58015	58015	he	324	" Mayhap , Quatermain , for who knows the infinite mercy of whatever made us as we are ? My old mother used to preach of it and I remember her words now . But in my case I expect it will stop at hope , or sleep , and if it was n't for Inez , I 'd not mind so much , for I tell you I 've had enough of the world and life . Look , there 's one of them . Take that , you black devil ! "
58355	58361	58362	58362	I	0	" Die well , Hans , "
58365	58381	58362	58362	I	0	" and if you get there first , wait for me on the other side . "
58382	58430	58432	58432	he	125	" Yes , Baas , I always meant to do that , though not yet . We are not going to die this time , Baas . Those who have the Great Medicine do n't die ; it is the others who die , like that fellow , "
58464	58475	58476	58476	I	0	" Curse - I mean bless - the Great Medicine , "
58725	58732	58733	58733	he	87	" The Great Medicine , Baas , "
58737	58748	58733	58733	he	87	" or perhaps your reverend father , the Predikant - - "
58770	58805	58750	58750	he	87	" Here it is , but I think it must be your reverend father , not the Great Medicine , yes , the Predikant himself , returned from Heaven , the Place of Fires ! "
58937	58988	58990	58990	he	87	" I greet you , Strangers , in the name of her I serve . I see that I am just in time , but this does not surprise me , since she said that it would be so . You seem to have done very well with these dogs , "
59000	59013	58990	58990	he	87	" Yes , very well indeed . You must be great warriors . "
59030	59041	59042	59042	I	0	" These do not seem to be friends of yours , "
59050	59054	59055	59055	I	0	" And yet , "
59070	59078	59055	59055	I	0	" they are very like your friends . "
59079	59100	59102	59103	Father Christmas	174	" Puppies from the same litter are often alike , yet when they grow up sometimes they fight each other , "
59106	59126	59128	59128	he	87	" At least these come to save and not to kill you . Look ! they kill the others ! "
59142	59148	59150	59150	he	87	" But who are these ? "
59170	59189	59166	59168	the grotesque Hans	87	" Nay , answer not , you must be weary and need rest . Afterwards we can talk . "
59190	59204	59205	59205	I	0	" Well , as a matter of fact we have not yet breakfasted , "
59208	59218	59205	59205	I	0	" Also I have business to attend to here , "
59576	59583	59585	59585	Hans	87	" The Great Medicine , Baas , "
59591	59695	59585	59585	Hans	87	" is even more powerful than I thought . Not only has it brought us safely through the fighting and without a scratch , for those Zulus there do not matter and there will be less cooking for me to do now that they are gone ; it has also brought down your reverend father the Predikant from the Place of Fires in Heaven , somewhat changed from what I remember him , it is true , but still without doubt the same . When I make my report to him presently , if he can understand my talk , I shall - - "
59696	59708	59709	59709	I	0	" Stop your infernal nonsense , you son of a donkey , "
59776	59818	59820	59820	he	1626	" Of a certainty you should be proud who with a few have defeated so many . Still , had I not been ordered to come at speed , I think that by now you would have been as those are , "
59848	59853	59854	59854	I	0	" Ordered by whom ? "
59857	59866	59867	59867	he	1626	" There is only one who can order , "
59873	59890	59867	59867	he	1626	" ' She - who - commands , She - who - is - everlasting ' ! "
59915	59945	59947	59947	I	0	" It would appear that there are some whom this exalted everlasting She can not command ; those who attacked us ; also those who have fled away yonder , "
59955	59989	59908	59908	I	0	" No command is absolute ; in every country there are rebels , even , as I have heard , in Heaven above us . But , Wanderer , what is your name ? "
59990	59997	59998	59998	I	0	" Watcher - by - Night , "
60001	60073	59908	59908	I	0	" Ah ! a good name for one who must have watched well by night , and by day too , to reach this country living where She - who - commands says that no man of your colour has set foot for many generations . Indeed , I think she told me once that two thousand years had gone by since she spoke to a white man in the City of K"r
60075	60075	59908	59908	I	0	"
60076	60081	60082	60082	I	0	" Did she indeed ? "
60089	60096	60097	60097	he	1632	" You do not believe me , "
60103	60144	60097	60097	he	1632	" Well , She - who - commands can explain matters for herself better than I who was not alive two thousand years ago , so far as I remember . But what must I call him with the Axe ? "
60145	60151	59908	59908	I	0	" Warrior is his name . "
60152	60193	60194	60194	he	1632	" Again a good name , as to judge by the wounds on them , certain of those rebels I think are now telling each other in Hell . And this man , if indeed he be a man - - "
60202	60212	59908	59908	I	0	" Light - in - Darkness is his name . "
60213	60254	59908	59908	I	0	" I see , doubtless because his colour is that of the winter sun in thick fog , or a bad egg broken into milk . And the other white man who mutters and whose brow is like a storm ? "
60255	60268	60269	60269	I	0	" He is called Avenger ; you will learn why later on , "
60283	60314	60274	60274	I	0	" And what are you called and , if you are pleased to tell it to us , upon what errand do you visit us in so fortunate an hour ? "
60315	60321	60322	60322	he	1632	" I am named Billali , "
60325	60352	60322	60322	he	1632	" the servant and messenger of She - who - commands , and I was sent to save you and to bring you safely to her . "
60353	60369	60269	60269	I	0	" How can this be , Billali , seeing that none knew of our coming ? "
60370	60379	60380	60380	he	1632	" Yet She - who - commands knew , "
60387	60453	60383	60383	his	1632	" Indeed , I think that she learned of it some moons ago through a message that was sent to her and so arranged all things that you should be guided safely to her secret home ; since otherwise how would you have passed a great pathless swamp with the loss , I think she said , of but one man whom a snake bit ? "
60484	60492	60493	60493	he	1632	" When you are rested and ready , "
60497	60531	60493	60493	he	1632	" we will start . Meanwhile I leave you that I may prepare litters to carry those wounded men , and you also , Watcher - by - Night , if you wish . "
60707	60716	60701	60701	Billali	93	" She - who - is - everlasting . "
61073	61082	61096	61096	he	87	" Awake , Baas , they are here ! "
61184	61193	61194	61194	I	0	" How did you make these so quickly , "
61205	61269	61300	61300	Billali	93	" We did not make them , Watcher - by - Night , we brought them with us folded up . She - who - commands looked in her glass and said that four would be needed , besides my own which is yonder , two for white lords and two for wounded black men , which you see is the number required . "
61270	61273	61274	61274	I	0	" Yes , "
61303	61358	61360	61360	he	93	" You will be glad to learn that my men caught some of those rebels who dared to attack you , eight or ten of them who had been hurt by your missiles or axe - cuts , and put them to death in the proper fashion - yes , quite the proper fashion , "
61365	61437	61360	61360	he	93	" The rest had gone too far where it would have been dangerous to follow them among the rocks . Enter now , my lord Watcher - by - Night , for the road is steep and we must travel fast if we would reach the place where She - who - commands is camped in the ancient holy city , before the moon sinks behind the cliffs to - night . "
61592	61599	61601	61601	Hans	87	" I see now , Baas , "
61610	61627	61601	61601	Hans	87	" that yonder Whitebeard can not be your reverend father , the Predikant , after all . "
61628	61632	61633	61633	I	0	" Why not ? "
61643	61688	61601	61601	Hans	87	" Because , Baas , if he were , he would not have left Hans , of whom he always thought so well , to run in the sun like a dog , while he and others travel in carriages like great white ladies . "
61689	61703	61704	61704	I	0	" You had better save your breath instead of talking nonsense , Hans , "
61720	61720	61704	61704	I	0	"
61937	61941	61943	61943	he	161	" no canny . "
61946	61975	61943	61943	he	161	" Ask yon old wizard who might be one of the Bible prophets come to life - what those man - eating devils have done with my daughter . "
61984	62040	61981	61981	Billali	93	" Say that they have taken her away to make a queen of her , since having rebelled against their own queen , they must have another who is white . Say too that She - who - commands will wage war on them and perhaps win her back , unless they kill her first . "
62041	62044	62045	62045	Robertson	161	" Ah ! "
62052	62062	62045	62045	Robertson	161	" unless they kill her first - or worse . "
62175	62208	62210	62210	he	125	" If we are to climb that , Macumazahn , I think that the only one who will live to get to the top will be that little yellow monkey of yours , "
62218	62223	62225	62226	that worthy	1683	" If I do , "
62238	62241	62213	62213	his	125	" yellow monkey "
62246	62268	62232	62232	he	125	" be sure that I will roll down stones upon any black butcher whom I see sprawling upon the cliff below . "
62956	62960	62961	62961	he	1713	" No one , "
62964	63000	62961	62961	he	1713	" it has been dead for thousands of years , but She - who - commands is camped there at present with an army , and thither we go at once . Forward , bearers . "
63090	63099	63100	63100	he	125	" Here is a fortress indeed , Macumazahn , "
63123	63123	63100	63100	he	125	"
63124	63127	63128	63128	I	0	" Yes , "
63131	63161	63128	63128	I	0	" but it is one out of which those who are in , would find it difficult to get out . We are buffaloes in a pit , Umslopogaas . "
63162	63167	63168	63168	he	125	" That is so , "
63171	63197	63168	63168	he	125	" I have thought it already . But if any would meddle with us we still have our horns and can toss for a while . "
63478	63545	63475	63475	Billali	93	" Descend , White Lords , and come with your companions , the black Warrior and the yellow man who is named Light - in - Darkness . She - who - commands desires to see you at once before you eat and sleep , and must not be kept waiting . Fear not for the others , they will be cared for till you return . "
63793	63798	63800	63800	Hans	87	" Oh , Baas , "
63803	63812	63800	63800	Hans	87	" this is the mouth of a trap , "
63828	63832	63833	63833	I	0	" Be silent , "
63836	63856	63833	63833	I	0	" All this mountain is a trap , therefore another does not matter , and we have our pistols . "
64691	64694	64695	64695	he	161	" Man , "
64698	64733	64695	64695	he	161	" I 've got them back although I have touched nothing for weeks , only this time they are lovely . For yon 's no human lady , I feel it in my bones . "
64770	64777	64778	64778	he	87	" Watcher - by - Night , "
64794	64844	64778	64778	he	87	" this chieftainess is not one woman , but all women . Beneath those robes of hers I seem to see the beauty of one who has ' gone Beyond , ' of the Lily who is lost to me . Do you not feel it thus , Macumazahn ? "
65113	65118	65123	65123	she	1777	" My servant here , "
65132	65162	65123	65123	she	1777	" tells me that you who are named Watcher - in - the - Night , understand the tongue in which I speak to you . Is it so ? "
65163	65198	65200	65200	I	0	" I understand Arabic of a kind well enough , having learned it on the East Coast and from Arabs in past years , but not such Arabic as you use , O - - "
65203	65208	65209	65209	she	1777	" Call me Hiya , "
65213	65270	65209	65209	she	1777	" which is my title here , meaning , as you know , She , or Woman . Or if that does not please you , call me Ayesha . It would rejoice me after so long to hear the name I bore spoken by the lips of one of my colour and of gentle blood . "
65285	65298	65271	65271	I	0	" - Not such Arabic as you use , O - Ayesha . "
65299	65352	65388	65388	her	1782	" I thought that you would like the sound of the word better than that of Hiya , though afterwards I will teach you to pronounce it as you should , O - have you any other name save Watcher - by - Night , which seems also to be a title ? "
65353	65356	65357	65357	I	0	" Yes , "
65360	65363	65357	65357	I	0	" Allan . "
65364	65375	65376	65376	she	1782	" - O - Allan . Tell me of these , "
65392	65425	65427	65427	she	1782	" for they do not speak Arabic , I think . Or stay , I will tell you of them and you shall say if I do so rightly . This one , "
65432	65599	65427	65427	she	1782	" is a man bemused . There comes from him a colour which I see if you can not , and that colour betokens a desire for revenge , though I think that in his time he has desired other things also , as I remember men always did from the beginning , to their ruin . Human nature does not change , Allan , and wine and women are ancient snares . Enough of him for this time . The little yellow one there is afraid of me , as are all of you . That is woman 's greatest power , although she is so weak and gentle , men are still afraid of her just because they are so foolish that they can not understand her . To them after a million years she still remains the Unknown and to us all the Unknown is also the awful . Do you remember the proverb of the Romans that says it well and briefly ? "
65618	65653	65760	65760	she	1785	" Good . Well , he is a little wild man , is he not , nearer to the apes from whose race our bodies come ? But do you know that , Allan ? "
65661	65671	65654	65654	I	0	" There are disputes upon the point , Ayesha . "
65672	65751	65760	65760	she	1785	" Yes , they had begun in my day and we will discuss them later . Still , I say - nearer to the ape than you or I , and therefore of interest , as the germ of things is always . Yet he has qualities , I think ; cunning , and fidelity and love which in its round is all in all . Do you understand , Allan , that love is all in all ? "
65783	65942	65770	65770	she	1785	" What this little yellow monkey understands by it at least has served you well , or so I believe . You shall tell me the tale of it some day . Now of the last , this Black One . Here I think is a man indeed , a warrior of warriors such as there used to be in the early world , if a savage . Well , believe me , Allan , savages are often the best . Moreover , all are still savage at heart , even you and I. For what is termed culture is but coat upon coat of paint laid on to hide our native colour , and often there is poison in the paint . That axe of his has drunk deep , I think , though always in fair fight , and I say that it shall drink deeper yet . Have I read these men aright , Allan ? "
65943	65948	65949	65949	I	0	" Not so ill , "
65952	65957	65958	65958	she	1787	" I thought it , "
65965	66066	66068	66068	she	1787	" although at this place I rust and grow dull like an unused sword . Now you would rest . Go - all of you . To - morrow you and I will talk alone . Fear nothing for your safety ; you are watched by my slaves and I watch my slaves . Until to - morrow , then , farewell . Go now , eat and sleep , as alas we all must do who linger on this ball of earth and cling to a life we should do well to lose . Billali , lead them hence , "
66132	66141	66142	66142	she	1787	" What does that word mean , Allan ? "
66161	66173	66174	66174	she	1787	" Did I not say that savages are often the best ? "
66181	66209	66174	66174	she	1787	" The white man , your companion , gave me no salute , but the Black One knows when he stands before a woman who is royal . "
66210	66222	66223	66223	I	0	" He too is of royal blood in his own land , "
66226	66236	66174	66174	she	1787	" If so , we are akin , Allan . "
66345	66348	66349	66349	he	87	" Baas , "
66364	66425	66349	66349	he	87	" in my life I have seen all kinds of dreadful things and faced them , but never have I been so much afraid as I am of that white witch . Baas , I think that she is the devil of whom your reverend father , the Predikant , used to talk so much , or perhaps his wife . "
66426	66432	66433	66433	I	0	" If so , Hans , "
66436	66466	66433	66433	I	0	" the devil is not so black as he is painted . But I advise you to be careful of what you say as she may have long ears . "
66467	66558	66349	66349	he	87	" It does n't matter at all what one says , Baas , because she reads thoughts before they pass the lips . I felt her doing it there in that room . And do you be careful , Baas , or she will eat up your spirit and make you fall in love with her , who , I expect , is very ugly indeed , since otherwise she would not wear a veil . Whoever saw a pretty woman tie up her head in a sack , Baas ? "
66559	66586	66433	66433	I	0	" Perhaps she does this because she is so beautiful , Hans , that she fears the hearts of men who look upon her would melt . "
66587	66646	66349	66349	he	87	" Oh , no , Baas , all women want to melt men 's hearts ; the more the better . They seem to have other things in their minds , but really they think of nothing else until they are too old and ugly , and it takes them a long while to be sure of that . "
67019	67026	67014	67014	his	93	" protected from warlocks and witches , "
67072	67077	67078	67078	he	93	" Greeting , Macumazahn , "
67081	67127	67078	67078	he	93	" you who are white and wise and I am black and a fighter have seen many strange things beneath the sun , but never such a one as we have looked upon to - night . Who and what is that chieftainess , Macumazahn ? "
67128	67134	67135	67135	I	0	" I do not know , "
67138	67157	67135	67135	I	0	" but it is worth while to have lived to see her , even though she be veiled . "
67158	67306	67078	67078	he	93	" Nor do I , Macumazahn . Nay , I do know , for my heart tells me that she is the greatest of all witches and that you will do well to guard your spirit lest she should steal it away . If she were not a witch , should I have seemed to behold the shape of Nada the Lily who was the wife of my youth , beneath those white robes of hers , and though the tongue in which she spoke was strange to me , to hear the murmur of Nada 's voice between her lips , of Nada who has gone further from me than those stars . It is good that you wear the Great Medicine of Zikali upon your breast , Macumazahn , for perhaps it will shield you from harm at those hands that are shaped of ivory . "
67307	67315	67316	67316	I	0	" Zikali is another of the tribe , "
67321	67365	67316	67316	I	0	" although less beautiful to see . Also I am not afraid of any of them , and from this one , if she be more than some white woman whom it pleases to veil herself , I shall hope to gather wisdom . "
67366	67382	67078	67078	he	93	" Yes , Macumazahn , such wisdom as Spirits and the dead have to give . "
67383	67403	67316	67316	I	0	" Mayhap , Umslopogaas , but we came here to seek Spirits and the dead , did we not ? "
67404	67407	67409	67409	Umslopogaas	125	" Aye , "
67411	67455	67409	67409	Umslopogaas	125	" these and war , and I think that we shall find enough of all three . Only I hope that war will come the first , lest the Spirits and the dead should bewitch me and take away my skill and courage . "
67651	67683	67684	67684	he	93	" Tell your companion , O Watcher , that it is not necessary for him to go upon his knees to She - who - commands - and must be obeyed , "
67689	67722	67684	67684	he	93	" when he is not in her presence , and that even then he would do well to keep silent , since so much talking in a strange tongue might trouble her . "
67730	67758	67723	67723	I	0	" He does not go upon his knees and pray to She - who - commands , but to the Great One who is in the sky . "
67759	67791	67723	67723	I	0	" Indeed , Watcher . Well , here we only know a Great One who is upon the earth , though it is true that perhaps she visits the skies sometimes . "
67792	67799	67800	67800	I	0	" Is it so , Billali ? "
67804	67823	67800	67800	I	0	" And now , I would ask you to take me to some place where I can bathe . "
67824	67829	67830	67830	he	1821	" It is ready , "
67833	67836	67830	67830	he	1821	" Come . "
67901	67913	67914	67914	I	0	" Who and what is this Queen of yours , Billali ? "
67920	67930	67914	67914	I	0	" Surely she is not of the Amahagger blood . "
67931	68010	68063	68063	he	1824	" Ask it of herself , O Watcher , for I can not tell you . All I know is that I can trace my own family for ten generations and that my tenth forefather told his son on his deathbed , for the saying has come down through his descendants - that when he was young She - who - commands had ruled the land for more scores of years than he could count months of life . "
68045	68061	68041	68041	he	1824	" If you doubt , ask . And now here is where you may bathe . "
69362	69367	69368	69368	she	1867	" Sit , Allan , "
69371	69417	69368	69368	she	1867	" and let us talk , for I think we have much to say to each other . Have you slept well ? And eaten ? - though I fear that the food is but rough . Also was the bath made ready for you ? "
69418	69423	69424	69424	I	0	" Yes , Ayesha , "
69441	69451	69424	69424	I	0	" It seems to be a very ancient bath . "
69452	69459	69460	69460	she	1867	" When I last saw it , "
69463	69519	69460	69460	she	1867	" it was well enough with statues standing round it worked by a sculptor who had seen beauty in his dreams . But in two thousand years - or is it more ? - the tooth of Time bites deep , and doubtless like all else in this dead place it is now a ruin . "
69547	69577	69368	69368	she	1867	" When you say one thing , Allan , and mean another , your Arabic is even more vile than usual and does not serve to cloak your thought . "
69578	69631	69752	69752	she	1873	" It may be so , Ayesha , for I only know that tongue as I do many other of the dialects of Africa by learning it from common men . My own speech is English , in which , if you are acquainted with it , I should prefer to talk . "
69632	69693	69368	69368	she	1867	" I know not English , which doubtless is some language that has arisen since I left the world . Perhaps later you shall teach it to me . I tell you , you anger me whom it is not well to anger , because you believe nothing that passes my lips and yet do not dare to say so . "
69694	69747	69752	69752	she	1873	" How can I believe one , Ayesha , who if I understand aright , speaks of having seen a certain bath two thousand years ago , whereas one hundred years are the full days of man ? Forgive me therefore if I can not believe what I know to be untrue . "
69773	69791	69792	69792	she	1873	" You must have courage to give me the lie so boldly - and I like courage , "
69795	69846	69792	69792	she	1873	" who have been cringed to for so long . Indeed , I know that you are brave , who have heard how you bore yourself in the fight yesterday , and much else about you . I think that we shall be friends , but - seek no more . "
69847	69856	69857	69857	I	0	" What else should I seek , Ayesha ? "
69861	69868	69869	69869	she	1873	" Now you are lying again , "
69872	69917	69869	69869	she	1873	" who know well that no man who is a man sees a woman who is beautiful and pleases him , without wondering whether , should he desire it , she could come to love him , that is , if she be young . "
69918	69943	69944	69944	I	0	" Which at least is not possible if she has lived two thousand years . Then naturally she would prefer to wear a veil , "
69963	69966	69967	69967	she	1873	" Ah ! "
69970	70123	69967	69967	she	1873	" the little yellow man who is named Light - in - Darkness put that thought into your heart , I think . Oh , do not trouble as to how I know it , who have many spies here , as he guessed well enough . So a woman who has lived two thousand years must be hideous and wrinkled , must she ? The stamp of youth and loveliness must long have fled from her ; of that you , the wise man , are sure . Very well . Now you tempt me to do what I had determined I would not do and you shall pluck the fruit of that tree of curiosity which grows so fast within you . Look , Allan , and say whether I am old and hideous , even though I have lived two thousand years upon the earth and mayhap many more . "
70656	70677	70649	70649	she	1874	" Do you admit now , Allan , that a woman may be old and still remain fair and unwrinkled ? "
70678	70682	70683	70683	I	0	" I admit , "
70700	70756	70693	70693	I	0	" that a woman may be splendid and lovely beyond anything that the mind of man can conceive , whatever her age , of which I know nothing . I would add this , Ayesha , that I thank you very much for having revealed to me the glory that is hid beneath your veil . "
70757	70760	70761	70761	she	1874	" Why ? "
70775	70823	70693	70693	I	0	" For this reason , Ayesha . Now there is no fear of my troubling you in such a fashion as you seemed to dread a little while ago . As soon would a man desire to court the moon sailing in her silver loveliness through heaven . "
70824	70840	70841	70841	she	1874	" The moon ! It is strange that you should compare me to the moon , "
70845	70931	70841	70841	she	1874	" Do you know that the moon was a great goddess in Old Egypt and that her name was Isis and - well , once I had to do with Isis ? Perhaps you were there and knew it , since more lives than one are given to most of us . I must search and learn . For the rest , all have not thought as you do , Allan . Many , on the contrary , love and seek to win the Divine . "
70932	70963	70693	70693	I	0	" So do I at a distance , Ayesha , but to come too near to it I do not aspire . If I did perhaps I might be consumed . "
70964	70969	70970	70970	she	1874	" You have wisdom , "
70983	71125	70980	70980	her	1874	" The moths are few that fear the flame , but those are the moths which live . Also I think that you have scorched your wings before and learned that fire hurts . Indeed , now I remember that I have heard of three such fires of love through which you have flown , Allan , though all of them are dead ashes now , or shine elsewhere . Two burned in your youth when a certain lady died to save you , a great woman that , is it not so ? And the third , ah ! she was fire indeed , though of a copper hue . What was her name ? I can not remember , but I think it had something to do with the wind , yes , with the wind when it wails . "
71188	71191	71192	71192	she	1874	" Perhaps , "
71200	71236	71238	71238	she	1874	" perhaps once again you disbelieve , Allan , whose cynic mind is so hard to open to new truths . Well , shall I show you the faces of these three ? I can , "
71266	71311	71238	71238	she	1874	" But what would it serve when you who know them so well , believed that I drew their pictures out of your own soul ? Also perchance but one face would appear and that one strange to you . Lady Ragnall perhaps ? - JB
71312	71387	71238	71238	she	1874	" Have you heard , Allan , that among the wise some hold that not all of us is visible at once here on earth within the same house of flesh ; that the whole self in its home above , separates itself into sundry parts , each of which walks the earth in different form , a segment of life 's circle that can never be dissolved and must unite again at last ? "
71404	71424	71425	71425	she	1887	" You have still much to learn , Allan , although doubtless there are some who think you wise , "
71434	71452	71453	71453	she	1887	" Well , I hold that this doctrine is built upon a rock of truth ; also , "
71462	71503	71453	71453	she	1887	" that in your case these three women do not complete that circle . I think there is a fourth who as yet is strange to you in this life , though you have known her well enough in others . "
71537	71650	71523	71523	she	1887	" No , no , not the humble slave who sits before you , whom , as you have told me , it would please you to reject as unworthy were she brought to you in offering , as in the old days was done at the courts of the great kings of the East . O fool , fool ! who hold yourself so strong and do not know that if I chose , before yon shadow had moved a finger 's breadth , I could bring you to my feet , praying that you might be suffered to kiss my robe , yes , just the border of my robe . "
71651	71710	71523	71523	she	1887	" Then I beg of you not to choose , Ayesha , since I think that when there is work to be done by both of us , we shall find more comfort side by side than if I were on the ground seeking to kiss a garment that doubtless then it would delight you to snatch away . "
71774	71780	71781	71781	she	1888	" Work to be done , "
71790	71951	71781	71781	she	1888	" Yes , I thank you who bring it to my mind , since the hours pass and that work presses . Also I think there is a bargain to be made between us who are both of the blood that keeps bargains , even if they be not written on a roll and signed and sealed . Why do you come to me and what do you seek of me , Allan , Watcher - in - the - Night ? Say it and truthfully , for though I may laugh at lies and pass them by when they have to do with the eternal sword - play which Nature decrees between man and woman , until these break apart or , casting down the swords , seek arms in which they agree too well , when they have to do with policy and high purpose and ambition 's ends , why then I avenge them upon the liar . "
71996	72018	71993	71993	I	0	" I come to ask you , Ayesha , to show me the dead , if the dead still live elsewhere . "
72019	72073	71993	71993	I	0	" And who told you , Allan , that I could show you the dead , if they are not truly dead ? There is but one , I think , and if you are his messenger , show me his token . Without it we do not speak together of this business . "
72074	72078	72079	72079	I	0	" What token ? "
72116	72127	72135	72135	she	1892	" I think - nay , let me be sure , "
72158	72164	72165	72165	she	1892	" If I read aright , "
72172	72268	72165	72165	she	1892	" it is a hideous thing enough , the carving of an abortion of a man such as no woman would care to look on lest her babe should bear its stamp . It is a charmed thing also that has virtues for him who wears it , especially for you , Allan , since something tells me that it is dyed with the blood of one who loved you . If you have it , let it be revealed , since without it I do not talk with you of these dead you seek . "
72286	72292	72293	72293	she	1892	" Give it to me , "
72312	72315	72316	72316	I	0	" Nay , "
72319	72419	72316	72316	I	0	" he who lent me this carving for a while , charged me that except in emergency and to save others , I must wear it night and day till I returned it to his hand , saying that if I parted from it fortune would desert me . I believe none of this talk and tried to be rid of it , whereon death drew near to me from a snake , such a snake as I see you wear about you , which doubtless also has poison in its fangs , if of another sort , Ayesha . "
72420	72424	72425	72425	she	1892	" Draw near , "
72428	72440	72425	72425	she	1892	" and let me look . Man , be not afraid . "
72533	72550	72551	72551	she	1892	" I have heard of this charm and it is true that the thing has power , "
72554	72675	72551	72551	she	1892	" for I can feel it running through my veins , also that it is a shield of defence to him who wears it . Yes , and now I understand what perplexed me somewhat , namely , how it came about that when you vexed me into unveiling - but let that matter be . The wisdom was not your own , but another 's , that is all . Yes , the wisdom of one whose years have borne him beyond the shafts that fly from woman 's eyes , the ruinous shafts which bring men down to doom and nothingness . Tell me , Allan , is this the likeness of him who gave it to you ? "
72676	72715	72749	72749	I	0	" Yes , Ayesha , the very picture , as I think , carved by himself , though he said that it is ancient , and others tell that it has been known in the land for centuries . "
72716	72722	72723	72723	she	1894	" So perchance has he , "
72782	72782	72773	72773	You	82	"
72783	72787	72788	72788	I	0	" A little , "
72827	72834	72835	72835	she	1894	" Now tell me the names , "
72838	72870	72835	72835	she	1894	" and then let us see if they tally with what I have written , for if so you are a true man , not a mere wanderer or a spy . "
72871	72905	72906	72906	I	0	" The principal names of this doctor are Zikali , the Opener - of - Roads , the ' Thing - that - should - never - have - been - born , ' "
72909	72916	72917	72917	she	1894	" Read the writing , Allan , "
72931	72956	72920	72920	I	0	" Weapons , Cleaver - of - Rocks , One - at - whom - dogs - bark - and - children - wail . "
72957	72965	72966	72966	she	1894	" The last two are near enough , "
72969	72976	72966	72966	she	1894	" but the first is wrong . "
72977	72997	73002	73002	she	1894	" Nay , Ayesha , since in this man 's tongue the word ' Zikali ' means ' Weapons ' "
73013	73017	73018	73018	I	0	" The man , "
73022	73063	73018	73018	I	0	" is without doubt a great doctor , one who sees and knows things that others do not , but I do not understand why this token carved in his likeness should have power , as you say it has . "
73064	73117	73018	73018	I	0	" Because with it goes his spirit , Allan . Have you never heard of the Egyptians , a very wise people who , as I remember , declared that man has a Ka or Double , a second self , that can either dwell in his statue or be sent afar ? "
73126	73183	73118	73118	I	0	" Well the Ka of this Zikali goes with that hideous image of him , which is perhaps why you have come safe through many dangers and why also I seemed to dream so much of him last night . Tell me now , what does Zikali want of me whose power he knows very well ? "
73184	73196	73018	73018	I	0	" An oracle , the answer to a riddle , Ayesha . "
73197	73278	73118	73118	I	0	" Then set it out another time . So you decide to see the dead , and this old dwarf , who is a home of wisdom , desires an oracle from one who is greater than he . Good . And what are you , or both of you , prepared to pay for these boons ? Know , Allan , that I am a merchant who sells my favours dear . Tell me then , will you pay ? "
73279	73289	73290	73290	I	0	" I think that it depends upon the price , "
73294	73302	73290	73290	I	0	" Set out the price , Ayesha . "
73303	73312	73313	73313	she	1902	" Be not afraid , O cunning dealer , "
73316	73369	73370	73370	she	1902	" I do not ask your soul or even that love of yours which you guard so jealously , since these things I could take without the asking . Nay , I ask only what a brave and honest man may give without shame : your help in war , and perhaps , "
73377	73405	73370	73370	she	1902	" your friendship . I think , Allan , that I like you well , perhaps because you remind me of another whom I knew long ago . "
73452	73455	73456	73456	she	1902	" Listen , "
73462	73524	73456	73456	she	1902	" I will tell you a story and when you have heard it you shall answer , even if you do not believe it , but not before . Does it please you to listen to something of the tale of my life which I am moved to tell you , that you may know with whom you have to deal ? "
73624	73627	73628	73628	she	1902	" Listen , "
73632	73685	73628	73628	she	1902	" and even if my story seems marvellous to you , interrupt , and above all , mock me not , lest I should grow angry , which might be ill for you . I am not as other women are , O Allan , who having conquered the secrets of Nature , "
73704	73742	73628	73628	she	1902	" to my sorrow have preserved my youth and beauty through many ages . Moreover in the past , perhaps in payment for my sins , I have lived other lives of which some memory remains with me .
73743	73924	73615	73615	she	1902	" By my last birth I am an Arab lady of royal blood , a descendant of the Kings of the East . There I dwelt in the wilderness and ruled a people , and at night I gathered wisdom from the stars and the spirits of the earth and air . At length I wearied of it all and my people too wearied of me and besought me to depart , for , Allan , I would have naught to do with men , yet men went mad because of my beauty and slew each other out of jealousy . Moreover other peoples made war upon my people , hoping to take me captive that I might be a wife to their kings . So I left them , and being furnished with great wealth in hoarded gold and jewels , together with a certain holy man , my master , I wandered through the world , studying the nations and their worships . At Jerusalem I tarried and learned of Jehovah who is , or was , its God .
73925	74020	73628	73628	she	1902	" At Paphos in the Isle of Chitim I dwelt a while till the folk of that city thought that I was Aphrodite returned to earth and sought to worship me . For this reason and because I made a mock of Aphrodite , I , who , as I have said , would have naught to do with men , she through her priests cursed me , saying that her yoke should lie more heavily upon my neck from age to age than on that of any woman who had breathed beneath the sun .
74021	74028	74029	74029	she	1907	" It was a wondrous scene , "
74033	74149	74029	74029	she	1907	" that of the cursing , since for every word I gave back two . Moreover I told the hoary villain of a high - priest to make report to his goddess that long after she was dead in the world , I would live on , for the spirit of prophecy was on me in that hour . Yet the curse fell in its season , since in her day , doubt it or not , Aphrodite had strength , as indeed under other names she has and will have while the world endures , and for aught I know , beyond it . Do they worship her now in any land , Allan ? "
74150	74167	74329	74329	she	84	" No , only her statues because of their beauty , though Love is always worshipped . "
74168	74309	74029	74029	she	1907	" Yes , who can testify to that better than you yourself , Allan , if he who is called Zikali tells me the truth concerning you in the dreams he sends ? As for the statues , I saw some of them as they left the master 's hand in Greece , and when I told him that he might have found a better model , once I was that model . If this marble still endures , it must be the most famous of them all , though perchance Aphrodite has shattered it in her jealous rage . You shall tell me of these statues afterwards ; mine had a mark on the left shoulder like to a mole , but the stone was imperfect , not my flesh , as I can prove if you should wish . "
74333	74530	74329	74329	she	84	" I dwelt in Egypt also , and there , to be rid of men who wearied me with their sighs and importunities , also to acquire more wisdom of which she was the mistress , I entered the service of the goddess Isis , Queen of Heaven , vowing to remain virgin for ever . Soon I became her high - priestess and in her most sacred shrines upon the Nile , I communed with the goddess and shared her power , since from me her daughter , she withheld none of her secrets . So it came about that though Pharaohs held the sceptre , it was I who ruled Egypt and brought it and Sidon to their fall , it matters not how or why , as it was fated that I must do . Yes , kings would come to seek counsel from me where I sat throned , dressed in the garb of Isis and breathing out her power . Yet , my task accomplished , of it all I grew weary , as men will surely do of the heavens that they preach , should they chance to find them . "
74535	74537	74329	74329	she	84	" task "
74545	74548	74531	74531	I	0	" Why ? "
74549	74619	74624	74624	she	1908	" Because in their pictured heaven all things lie to their hands and man , being man , can not be happy without struggle , and woman , being woman , without victory over others . What is cheaply bought , or given , has no value , Allan ; to be enjoyed , it must first be won . But I bade you not to break my thought . "
74628	74724	74624	74624	she	1908	" Then it was that the shadow of the curse of Aphrodite fell upon me , yes , and of the curse of Isis also , so that these twin maledictions have made me what I am , a lost soul dwelling in the wilderness waiting the fulfilment of a fate whereof I know not the end . For though I have all wisdom , all knowledge of the Past and much power together with the gift of life and beauty , the future is as dark to me as night without its moon and stars .
74725	74889	74624	74624	she	1908	" Hearken , this chanced to me . Though it be to my shame I tell it you that all may be clear . At a temple of Isis on the Nile where I ruled , there was a certain priest , a Greek by birth , vowed like myself to the service of the goddess and therefore to we d none but her , the goddess herself - that is , in the spirit . He was named Kallikrates , a man of courage and of beauty , such an one as those Greeks carved in the statues of their god Apollo . Never , I think , was a man more beautiful in face and form , though in soul he was not great , as often happens to men who have all else , and well - nigh always happens to women , save myself and perhaps one or two others that history tells of , doubtless magnifying their fabled charms .
74890	74999	74624	74624	she	1908	" The Pharaoh of that day , the last of the native blood , him whom the Persians drove to doom , had a daughter , the Princess of Egypt , Amenartas by name , a fair woman in her fashion , though somewhat swarthy . In her youth this Amenartas became enamoured of Kallikrates and he of her , when he was a captain of the Grecian Mercenaries at Pharaoh 's Court . Indeed , she brought blood upon his hands because of her , wherefore he fled to Isis for forgiveness and for peace . Thither in after time she followed him and again urged her love .
75000	75113	74624	74624	she	1908	" Learning of the thing and knowing it for sacrilege , I summoned this priest and warned him of his danger and of the doom which awaited him should he continue in that path . He grew affrighted . He flung himself upon the ground before me with groans and supplications , and kissing my feet , vowed most falsely to me that his dealings with the royal Amenartas were but a veil and that it was I whom he worshipped . His unhallowed words filled me with horror and sternly I bade him begone and do penance for his crime , saying that I would pray the goddess on behalf of him .
75114	75171	74624	74624	she	1908	" He went , leaving me alone lost in thought in the darkening shrine . Then sleep fell on me and in my sleep I dreamed a dream , or saw a vision . For suddenly there stood before me a woman beauteous as myself clad in nothing save a golden girdle and a veil of gossamer .
75172	75355	74624	74624	she	1908	" ' O Ayesha , ' she said in a honeyed voice , ' priestess of Isis of the Egyptians , sworn to the barren worship of Isis and fed on the ashes of her unprofitable wisdom , know that I am Aphrodite of the Greeks whom many times thou hast mocked and defied , and Queen of the breathing world , as Isis is Queen of the world that is dead . Now because thou didst despise me and pour contempt upon my name , I smite thee with my strength and lay a curse upon thee . It is that thou shalt love and desire this man who but now hath kissed thy feet , ever longing till the world 's end to kiss his lips in payment , although thou art as far above him as the moon thou servest is above the Nile . Think not that thou shalt escape my doom , for know that however strong the spirit , here upon the earth the flesh is stronger still and of all flesh I am the queen . '
75356	75377	74624	74624	she	1908	" Then she laughed softly and smiting me across the eyes with a lock of her scented hair , was gone .
75378	75534	74624	74624	she	1908	" Allan , I awoke from my sleep and a great trouble fell upon me , for I who had never loved before now was rent with a rage of love and for this man who till that moment had been naught to me but as some beauteous image of gold and ivory . I longed for him , my heart was racked with jealousy because of the Egyptian who favoured him , an eating flame possessed my breast . I grew mad . There in the shrine of Isis the divine I cast myself upon my knees and cried to Aphrodite to return and give me him I sought , for whose sake I would renounce all else , even if I must pour my wisdom into a beauteous , empty cup . Yes , thus I prayed and lay upon the ground and wept until , outworn , once more sleep fell upon me .
75535	75609	74624	74624	she	1908	" Now in the darkness of the holy place once more there came a dream or vision , since before me in her glory stood the goddess Isis crowned with the crescent of the young moon and holding in her hand the jewelled sistrum that is her symbol , from which came music like to the melody of distant bells . She gazed at me and in her great eyes were scorn and anger .
75610	75759	74624	74624	she	1908	" ' O Ayesha , Daughter of Wisdom , ' she said in a solemn voice , ' whom I , Isis , had come to look upon rather as a child than a servant , since in none other of my priestesses was such greatness to be found , and whom in a day to be I had purposed to raise to the very steps of my heavenly throne , thou hast broken thine oath and , forsaking me , hast worshipped false Aphrodite of the Greeks who is mine enemy . Yea , in the eternal war between the spirit and the flesh , thou hast chosen the part of flesh . Therefore I hate thee and add my doom to that which Aphrodite laid upon thee , which , hadst thou prayed to me and not to her , I would have lifted from thy heart .
75760	75862	74624	74624	she	1908	" ' Hearken ! The Grecian whom thou hast chosen , by Aphrodite 's will , thou shalt love as the Pathian said . More , thy love shall bring his blood upon thy hands , nor mayest thou follow him to the grave . For I will show thee the Source of Life and thou shalt drink of it to make thyself more fair even than thou art and thus outpace thy rival , and when thy lover is dead , in a desolate place thou shalt wait in grief and solitude till he is born again and find thee there .
75863	75956	74624	74624	she	1908	" ' Yet shall this be but the beginning of thy sorrows , since through all time thou shalt pursue thy fate till at length thou canst draw up this man to the height on which thine own soul stands by the ropes of love and loss and suffering . Moreover through it all thou shalt despise thyself , which is man 's and woman 's hardest lot , thou who having the rare feast of spirit spread out before thee , hast chosen to fill thyself from the troughs of flesh . '
75957	76112	74624	74624	she	1908	" Then , Allan , in my dream I made a proud answer to the goddess , saying , ' Hear me , mighty mistress of many Forms who dost appear in all that lives ! An evil fate has fallen upon me , but was it I who chose that fate ? Can the leaf contend against the driving gale ? Can the falling stone turn upwards to the sky , or when Nature draws it , can the tide cease to flow ? A goddess whom I have offended , that goddess whose strength causes the whole world to be , has laid her curse upon me and because I have bent before the storm , as bend I must , or break , another goddess whom I serve , thou thyself , Mother Isis , hast added to the curse . Where then is Justice , O Lady of the Moon ? '
76113	76318	74624	74624	she	1908	" ' Not here , Woman , ' she answered . ' Yet far away Justice lives and shall be won at last and mayhap because thou art so proud and high - stomached , it is laid upon thee to seek her blinded eyes through many an age . Yet at last I think thou shalt set thy sins against her weights and find the balance even . Therefore cease from questioning the high decrees of destiny which thou canst not understand and be content to suffer , remembering that all joy grows from the root of pain . Moreover , know this for thy comfort , that the wisdom which thou hast shall grow and gather on thee and with it thy beauty and thy power ; also that at the last thou shalt look upon my face again , in token whereof I leave to thee my symbol , the sistrum that I bear , and with it this command . Follow that false priest of mine wherever he may go and avenge me upon him , and if thou lose him there , wait while the generations pass till he return again . Such and no other is thy destiny . '
76319	76395	76462	76462	she	1909	" Allan , the vision faded and when I awoke the lights of dawn played upon the image of the goddess in the sanctuary . They played , moreover , upon the holy jewelled thing that in my dream her hand had held , the sistrum of her worship , shaped like the loop of life , the magic symbol that she had vowed to me , wherewith goes her power , which henceforth was mine .
76396	76429	76462	76462	she	1909	" I took it and followed after the priest Kallikrates , to whom thenceforward I was bound by passion 's ties that are stronger than all the goddesses in this wide universe . "
76443	76447	76451	76451	her	1909	" What for ? "
76490	76585	76486	76486	she	1909	" By Aphrodite , or by Isis , or both of them I did not know . All I knew was that I must seek him , then and evermore , as seek I do to - day and shall perchance through æons yet unborn . So I followed , as I was taught and commanded , the sistrum being my guide , how it matters not , and giving me the means , and so at last I came to this ancient land whereof the ruin in which you sit was once known as K"r
76587	76587	76486	76486	she	1909	"
76751	76773	76731	76731	her	1909	" What think you of this story , Allan ? Do you believe it and have you ever heard its like ? "
76774	76777	76778	76778	I	0	" Never , "
76783	76811	76778	76778	I	0	" and of course I believe every word . Only there are one or two questions that with your leave I would wish to ask , Ayesha . "
76812	76909	76911	76911	I	0	" By which you mean , Allan , that you believe nothing , being by nature without faith and doubtful of all that you can not see and touch and handle . Well , perhaps you are wise , since what I have told you is not all the truth . For example , it comes back to me now that it was not in the temple on the Nile , or indeed upon the Earth , that I saw the vision of Aphrodite and of Isis , but elsewhere ; also that it was here in K"r
76951	76951	76940	76940	I	0	"
76952	76955	76956	76956	I	0	" Ayesha , "
76979	77018	76956	76956	I	0	" even I who am not learned have heard of these goddesses of whom you speak , of the Grecian Aphrodite who rose from the sea upon the shores of Cyprus and dwelt at Paphos and elsewhere - - "
77019	77050	77051	77051	she	82	" Yes , doubtless like most men you have heard of her and perchance also have been struck across the eyes with her hair , like your betters before you , "
77056	77061	77062	77062	I	0	" - - Also , "
77069	77098	77062	77062	I	0	" I have heard of Isis of the Egyptians , Lady of the Moon , Mother of Mysteries , Spouse of Osiris whose child was Horus the Avenger . "
77099	77169	77051	77051	she	82	" Aye , and I think will hear more of her before you have done , Allan , for now something comes back to me concerning you and her and another . I am not the only one who has broken the oaths of Isis and received her curse , Allan , as you may find out in the days to come . But what of these heavenly queens ? "
77170	77218	77062	77062	I	0	" Only this , Ayesha ; I have been taught that they were but phantasms fabled by men with many another false divinity , and could have sworn that this was true . And yet you talk of them as real and living , which perplexes me . "
77219	77354	77051	77051	she	82	" Being dull of understanding doubtless it perplexes you , Allan . Yet if you had imagination you might understand that these goddesses are great Principles of Nature ; Isis , of throned Wisdom and strait virtue , and Aphrodite , of Love , as it is known to men and women who , being human , have it laid upon them that they must hand on the torch of Life in their little hour . Also you would know that such Principles can seem to take shape and form and at certain ages of the world appear to their servants visible in majesty , though perchance to - day others with changed names wield their sceptres and work their will . Now you are answered on this matter . So to the next . "
77394	77550	77551	77551	I	0	" If I understood rightly , Ayesha , the events which you have been pleased first to describe to me , and then to qualify or contradict , took place when the Pharaohs reigned . Now no Pharaoh has sat upon the throne of Egypt for near two thousand years , for the last was a Grecian woman whom the Romans conquered and drove to death . And yet , Ayesha , you speak as though you have lived all through that gulf of time , and in this there must be error , because it is impossible . Therefore I suppose you to mean that this history has come down to you in writing , or perhaps in dreams . I believe that even in such far - off times there were writers of romance , and we all know of what stuff dreams are made . At least this thought comes to me , "
77563	77605	77557	77557	I	0	" and one so wise as you are , I repeat , knows well that a woman who says she has lived two thousand years must be mad or - suffer from delusions , because I repeat , it is impossible . "
77629	77640	77641	77641	she	1917	" Impossible ! Romance ! Dreams ! Delusions ! Mad ! "
77648	77726	77641	77641	she	1917	" Oh ! of a truth you weary me , and I have a mind to send you whither you will learn what is impossible and what is not . Indeed , I would do it , and now , only I need your services , and if I did there would be none left for me to talk with , since your companion is moonstruck and the others are but savages of whom I have seen enough .
77727	77878	77611	77611	she	1917	" Hearken , fool ! Nothing is impossible . Why do you seek , you who talk of the impossible , to girdle the great world in the span of your two hands and to weigh the secrets of the Universe in the balance of your petty mind and , of that which you can not understand , to say that it is not ? Life you admit because you see it all about you . But that it should endure for two thousand years , which after all is but a second 's beat in the story of the earth , that to you is ' impossible , ' although in truth the buried seed or the sealed - up toad can live as long . Doubtless , also , you have some faith which promises you this same boon to all eternity , after the little change called Death .
77879	78053	77641	77641	she	1917	" Nay , Allan , it is possible enough , like to many other things of which you do not dream to - day that will be common to the eyes of those who follow after you . Mayhap you think it impossible that I should speak with and learn of you from yonder old black wizard who dwells in the country whence you came . And yet whenever I will I do so in the night because he is in tune with me , and what I do shall be done by all men in the years unborn . Yes , they shall talk together across the wide spaces of the earth , and the lover shall hear her lover 's voice although great seas roll between them . Nor perchance will it stop at this ; perchance in future time men shall hold converse with the denizens of the stars , and even with the dead who have passed into silence and the darkness . Do you hear and understand me ? "
78054	78059	78060	78060	I	0	" Yes , yes , "
78064	78156	77641	77641	she	1917	" You lie , as you are too prone to do . You hear but you do not understand nor believe , and oh ! you vex me sorely . Now I had it in my mind to tell you the secret of this long life of mine ; long , mark you , but not endless , for doubtless I must die and change and return again , like others , and even to show you how it may be won . But you are not worthy in your faithlessness . "
78157	78167	78168	78168	I	0	" No , no , I am not worthy , "
78331	78338	78339	78339	she	533	" So that is done with , "
78349	78388	78339	78339	she	533	" as soon you will be also , who , had you not crossed and doubted me , might have lived on for untold time and become one of the masters of the world , as I am . "
78415	78482	78484	78484	I	0	" Such place and power , if they be yours , Ayesha , do not seem to bring you much reward . If I were a master of the world I do not think that I should choose to dwell unchangingly among savages who eat men and in a pile of ruins . But perhaps the curses of Aphrodite and of Isis are stronger masters still ? "
78511	78520	78521	78521	she	1922	" You have more wisdom than I thought , "
78525	78729	78521	78521	she	1922	" who have come to understand that no one is really lord of anything , since above there is always a more powerful lord who withers all his pomp and pride to nothingness , even as the great kings learned in olden days , and I , who am higher than they are , am learning now . Hearken . Troubles beset me wherein I would have your help and that of your companions , for which I will pay each of you the fee that he desires . The brooding white man who is with you shall free his daughter and unharmed ; though that he will be unharmed I do not promise . The black savage captain shall fight his fill and gain the glory that he seeks , also something that he seeks still more . The little yellow man asks nothing save to be with his master like a dog and to satisfy at once his stomach and his apish curiosity . You , Allan , shall see those dead over whom you brood at night , though the other guerdon that you might have won is now passed from your reach because you mock me in your heart . "
78730	78740	78741	78741	I	0	" What must we do to gain these things ? "
78744	78771	78741	78741	I	0	" How can we humble creatures help one who is all powerful and who has gathered in her breast the infinite knowledge of two thousand years ? "
78772	78804	78521	78521	she	1922	" You must make war under my banner and rid me of my foes . As for the reason , listen to the end of my tale and you shall learn . "
78863	78922	78858	78858	she	1923	" You are thinking that it is strange , Allan , that I , the Mighty and Undying , should seek your aid in some petty tribal battle , and so it would be were my foes but common savages . But they are more ; they are men protected by the ancient god of this immemorial city of K"r
78956	78956	78941	78954	the worshippers who cling to him and practise his unholy rites of human sacrifice	1927	"
78957	78964	78965	78965	I	0	" How was this god named ? "
78968	78988	78941	78954	the worshippers who cling to him and practise his unholy rites of human sacrifice	1927	" Rezu was his name , and from him came the Egyptian Re or Ra , since in the beginning K"r
78999	79031	78941	78954	the worshippers who cling to him and practise his unholy rites of human sacrifice	1927	K"r took their god with them when they burst into the valley of the Nile and subdued its peoples long before the first Pharaoh , Menes , wore Egypt 's crown . "
79032	79042	79043	79043	I	0	" Ra was the sun , was he not ? "
79046	79127	78941	78954	the worshippers who cling to him and practise his unholy rites of human sacrifice	1927	" Aye , and Rezu also was a sun - god whom from his throne in the fires of the Lord of Day , gave life to men , or slew them if he willed with his thunderbolts of drought and pestilence and storm . He was no gentle king of heaven , but one who demanded blood - sacrifice from his worshippers , yes , even that of maids and children . So it came about that the people of K"r
79238	79279	79229	79229	Rezu	88	K"r and its subject lands and slew their people , save those who clung to him in the great apostasy , and with them some others who served Lulala and Truth the Divine , that escaped I know not how . "
79280	79288	79289	79289	I	0	" Did you see this great pestilence ? "
79295	79305	79289	79289	I	0	" Nay , it befell generations before I came to K"r
79345	79474	79310	79311	a priest	1820	K"r , of which , should you desire to hear it , I will tell you the history , was a ruin as it is now , though scattered in the lands amidst the tumbled stones which once built up her subject cities , a people named the Amahagger dwelt in Households , or Tribes and there sacrificed men by fire and devoured them , following the rites of the demon Rezu . For these were the descendants of those who escaped the pestilence . Also there were certain others , children of the worshippers of Lulala whose kingdom is the moon , and of Truth the Queen , who clung to the gentle worship of their forefathers and were ever at war with the followers of Rezu . "
79475	79480	79482	79482	Ayesha	84	" What brought you to K"r
79484	79488	79482	79482	Ayesha	84	" I asked irrelevantly .
79489	79514	79515	79515	she	1940	" Have I not said that I was led hither by the command and the symbol of great Isis whom I serve ? Also , "
79521	79546	79515	79515	she	1940	" that I might find a certain pair , one of whom had broken his oaths to her , tempted thereto by the other . "
79547	79556	79557	79557	I	0	" And did you find them , Ayesha ? "
79560	79595	79482	79482	Ayesha	84	" Aye , I found them , or rather they found me , and in my presence the goddess executed her decree upon her false priest and drove his temptress back to the world . "
79596	79618	79619	79619	She	1941	" That must have been dreadful for you , Ayesha , since I understood that you also - liked this priest . "
79650	79691	79619	79619	She	1941	" Man , do you dare to mock me ? Nay , you are but a blundering , curious fool , and it is well for you that this is so , since otherwise like Kallikrates , never should you leave K"r
79753	79756	79757	79757	she	200	" Stranger , "
79765	79811	79757	79757	she	200	" perchance your faith , whate'er it be , parades a hell to terrify its worshippers and give strength to the arms of its prophesying priests , who swear they hold the keys of doom or of the eternal joys . I see you sign assent "
79820	79881	79812	79812	I	0	" and therefore can understand that in such a hell as this , here upon the earth I have dwelt for some two thousand years , expiating the crime of Powers above me whereof I am but the hand and instrument , since those Powers which decreed that I should love , decree also that I must avenge that love . "
79919	80046	79911	79911	she	200	" Of these woes ask me no more . They sleep till the hour of their resurrection , which I think draws nigh ; indeed , I thought that you perchance - - But let that be . ' Twas near the mark ; nearer , Allan , than you know , not in it ! Therefore leave them to their sleep as I would if I might - ah ! if I might , whose companions they are throughout the weary ages . Alas ! that through the secret which was revealed to me I remain undying on the earth who in death might perhaps have found a rest , and being human although half divine , must still busy myself with the affairs of earth .
80047	80210	79911	79911	she	200	" Look you , Wanderer , after that which was fated had happened and I remained in my agony of solitude and sorrow , after , too , I had drunk of the cup of enduring life and like the Prometheus of old fable , found myself bound to this changeless rock , whereon day by day the vultures of remorse tear out my living heart which in the watches of the night is ever doomed to grow again within my woman 's breast , I was plunged into petty troubles of the flesh , aye and welcomed them because their irk at times gave me forgetfulness . When the savage dwellers in this land came to know that a mighty one had arisen among them who was the servant of the Lady of the Moon , those of them who still worshipped their goddess Lulala , gathered themselves about me , while those of them who worshipped Rezu sought to overthrow me .
80211	80291	79911	79911	she	200	" ' Here , ' they said , ' is the goddess Lulala come to earth . In the name of Rezu let us slay her and make an end , ' for these fools thought that I could be killed . Allan , I conquered them , but their captain , who also is named Rezu and whom they held and hold to be an emanation of the god himself walking the earth , I could not conquer . "
80292	80296	80297	80297	I	0	" Why not ? "
80300	80365	79911	79911	she	200	" For this reason , Allan . In some past age his god showed him the same secret that was shown to me . He too had drunk of the Cup of Life and lives on unharmed by Time , so that being in strength my equal , no spear of mine can reach his heart clad in the armour of his evil god . "
80366	80372	80373	80373	I	0	" Then what spear can ? "
80381	80426	80431	80431	myself	0	" None at all , Allan , yet an axe may , as you shall hear , or so I think . For many generations there has been peace of a sort between the worshippers of Lulala who dwell with me in the Plain of K"r
80479	80514	80439	80439	Lulala	217	K"r , which is not strong enough to stand against him . Moreover he has sought for a white queen to rule under him , purposing to set her up to mock my majesty . "
80515	80538	80539	80539	I	0	" Is that why those cannibals carried away the daughter of my companion , the Sea - Captain who is named Avenger ? "
80542	80596	80600	80600	him	1949	" It is , Allan , since presently he will give it out that I am dead or fled , if he has not done so already , and that this new queen has arisen in my place . Thereby he hopes to draw away many who cling to me ere he advances upon K"r
80775	80775	80766	80766	they	1960	"
80776	80787	80788	80788	I	0	" What do you mean about an axe , Ayesha ? "
80791	80800	80788	80788	I	0	" Why can an axe alone kill Rezu ? "
80801	81049	80766	80766	they	1960	" The thing is a mystery , O Allan , of which I may not tell you all , since to do so I must reveal secrets which I have determined you shall not learn . Suffice it to you to know that when this Rezu drank of the Cup of Life he took with him his axe . Now this axe was an ancient weapon rumoured to have been fashioned by the gods and , as it chanced , that axe drew to itself more and stronger life than did Rezu , how , it does not matter , if indeed the tale be more than a fable . At least this I know is true , for he who guarded the Gate of Life , a certain Noot , a master of mysteries , and mine also in my day of youth , who being a philosopher and very wise , chose never to pass that portal which was open to him , said it to me himself ere he went the way of flesh . He told this Rezu also that now he had naught to fear save his own axe and therefore he counselled him to guard it well , since if it was lifted against him in another 's hands it would bring him down to death , which nothing else could do . Like to the heel of Achilles whereof the great Homer sings - have you read Homer , Allan ? "
81050	81055	81056	81056	I	0	" In a translation , "
81059	81104	80766	80766	they	1960	" Good , then you will remember the story . Like to the heel of Achilles , I say , that axe would be the only gate by which death could enter his invulnerable flesh , or rather it alone could make the gate . "
81105	81112	81113	81113	I	0	" How did Noot know that ? "
81116	81122	81123	81123	she	1962	" I can not say , "
81128	81214	81123	81123	she	1962	" Perchance he did not know it . Perchance it is all an idle tale , but at least it is true that Rezu believed and believes it , and what a man believes is true for him and will certainly befall . If it were otherwise , what is the use of faith which in a thousand forms supports our race and holds it from the horrors of the Pit ? Only those who believe nothing inherit what they believe - nothing , Allan . "
81215	81221	81222	81222	I	0	" It may be so , "
81226	81234	81222	81222	I	0	" but what happened about the axe ? "
81235	81276	81277	81277	I	0	" In the end it was lost , or as some say stolen by a woman whom Rezu had deserted , and therefore he walks the world in fear from day to day . Nay , ask no more empty questions "
81284	81525	81222	81222	I	0	" but hear the end of the tale . In my trouble concerning Rezu I remembered this wild legend of the axe and since , when lost in a forest every path that may lead to safety should be explored , I sent my wisdom forth to make inquiry concerning it , as I who am great , have the power to do , of certain who are in tune with me throughout this wide land of Africa . Amongst others , I inquired of that old wizard whom you named Zikali , Opener of Roads , and he gave me an answer that there lived in his land a certain warrior who ruled a tribe called the People of the Axe by right of the Axe , of which axe none , not even he , knew the beginning or the legend . On the chance , though it was a small one , I bade the wizard send that warrior here with his axe . Last night he stood before me and I looked upon him and the axe , which at least is ancient and has a story . Whether it be the same that Rezu bore I do not know who never saw it , yet perchance he who bears it now is prepared to hold it aloft in battle even against Rezu , though he be terrible to see , and then we shall learn . "
81526	81531	81532	81532	I	0	" Oh ! yes , "
81535	81565	81532	81532	I	0	" he is quite prepared , for that is his nature . Also among this man 's people , the holder of the Axe is thought to be unconquerable . "
81566	81577	81578	81578	she	1963	" Yet some must have been conquered who held it , "
81582	81658	81578	81578	she	1963	" Well , you shall tell me that tale later . Now we have talked long and you are weary and astonished . Go , eat and rest yourself . To - night when the moon rises I will come to where you are , not before , for I have much that must be done , and show you those with whom you must fight against Rezu , and make a plan of battle . "
81659	81668	81669	81669	I	0	" But I do not want to fight , "
81672	81687	81669	81669	I	0	" who have fought enough and came here to seek wisdom , not bloodshed . "
81688	81697	81698	81698	she	1963	" First the sacrifice , then the reward , "
81701	81714	81698	81698	she	1963	" that is if any are left to be rewarded . Farewell . "
81790	81793	81794	81794	he	87	" Baas , "
81797	81835	81794	81794	he	87	" did the White Witch tell you that there is a big impi encamped over yonder outside the houses , in what looks like a great dry ditch , and on the edge of the plain beyond ? "
81836	81859	81761	81761	I	0	" No , Hans , but she said that this evening she would show us those in whose company we must fight . "
81860	81913	81794	81794	he	87	" Well , Baas , they are there , some thousands of them , for I crept through the broken walls like a snake and saw them . And , Baas , I do not think they are men , I think that they are evil spirits who walk at night only . "
81914	81919	81761	81761	I	0	" Why , Hans ? "
81920	81975	81794	81794	he	87	" Because when the sun is high , Baas , as it is now , they are all sleeping . Yes , there they lie abed , fast asleep , as other people do at night , with only a few sentries out on guard , and these are yawning and rubbing their eyes . "
81976	82000	82001	82001	I	0	" I have heard that there are folk like that in the middle of Africa where the sun is very hot , Hans , "
82004	82038	82001	82001	I	0	" which perhaps is why She - who - commands is going to take us to see them at night . Also these people , it seems , are worshippers of the moon . "
82039	82058	81794	81794	he	87	" No , Baas , they are worshippers of the devil and that White Witch is his wife . "
82059	82103	82001	82001	I	0	" You had better keep your thoughts to yourself , Hans , for whatever she is I think that she can read thoughts from far away , as you guessed last night . Therefore I would not have any if I were you . "
82104	82132	82133	82133	he	1968	" No , Baas , or if I must think , henceforth , it shall be only of gin which in this place is also far away , "
82895	82898	82899	82899	we	1988	" the good "
83291	83294	83269	83269	she	84	" trolls , "
83467	83476	83451	83451	Umslopogaas	125	" Where is Red - Beard , Macumazahn ? "
83498	83515	83516	83516	he	161	" I think that you had better keep Red - Beard close to you , Macumazahn , "
83520	83627	83516	83516	he	161	" This afternoon , when you had returned from visiting the white doctoress and having eaten , had gone to sleep under the wall yonder , I saw Red - Beard come out of the house carrying a gun and a bag of cartridges . His eyes rolled wildly and he turned first this way and then that , sniffing at the air , like a buck that scents danger . Then he began to talk aloud in his own tongue and as I saw that he was speaking with his Spirit , as those do who are mad , I went away and left him . "
83628	83631	83632	83632	I	0	" Why ? "
83635	83699	83516	83516	he	161	" Because , as you know , Macumazahn , it is a law among us Zulus never to disturb one who is mad and engaged in talking with his Spirit . Moreover , had I done so , probably he would have shot me , nor should I have complained who would have thrust myself in where I had no right to be . "
83700	83713	83516	83516	he	161	" Then why did you not come to call me , Umslopogaas ? "
83714	83820	83516	83516	he	161	" Because then he might have shot you , for , as I have seen for some time he is inspired of heaven and knows not what he does upon the earth , thinking only of the Lady Sad - Eyes who has been stolen away from him , as is but natural . So I left him walking up and down , and when I returned later to look , saw that he was gone , as I thought into this walled hut . Now when Hansi tells me that he is not here , I have come to speak to you about him . "
83821	83830	83831	83831	I	0	" No , certainly he is not here , "
83888	84013	83878	83878	I	0	" The merciful Lord has sent me a vision of Inez and shown me where she is over the cliff - edge away to the west , also the road to her . In my sleep I heard her talking to me . She told me that she is in great danger - that they are going to marry her to some brute - and called to me to come at once and save her ; yes , and to come alone without saying anything to anyone . So I am going at once . Do n't be frightened or trouble about me . All will be well , all will be quite well . I will tell you the rest when we meet . "
84030	84046	84047	84047	I	0	" Did I not tell you that he was talking with his Spirit , Macumazahn ? "
84050	84054	84047	84047	I	0	" the merciful Lord "
84060	84080	84047	84047	I	0	" Well , he has gone and doubtless his Spirit will take care of him . It is finished . "
84081	84091	84094	84094	Hans	87	" At any rate we can not , Baas , "
84111	84141	84104	84104	him	87	" I can follow most spoors , but not on such a night as this when one could cut the blackness into lumps and build a wall of it . "
84142	84145	84146	84146	I	0	" Yes , "
84149	84161	84146	84146	I	0	" he has gone and nothing can be done at present , "
84813	84834	84835	84835	she	84	" So men have learned another useless vice since I left the world , and one that is filthy also , "
84926	84931	84932	84932	she	84	" You are troubled , "
84941	84977	84932	84932	she	84	" I read it in your face . One of your company is missing . Who is it ? Ah ! I see , the white man you name Avenger . Where is he gone ? "
84978	84990	84991	84991	I	0	" That is what I wish to ask you , Ayesha , "
84994	85026	85029	85029	her	84	" How can I tell you , Allan , who in this place lack any glass into which to look for things that pass afar . Still , let me try , "
85047	85151	85035	85035	she	84	" I think that he has gone over the mountain lip towards the worshippers of Rezu . I think that he is mad ; sorrow and something else which I do not understand have turned his brain ; something that has to do with the Heavens . I think also that we shall recover him living , if only for a little while , though of this I can not be sure since it is not given to me to read the future , but only the past , and sometimes the things that happen in the present though they be far away . "
85152	85164	85165	85165	I	0	" Will you send to search for him , O Ayesha ? "
85169	85216	85035	85035	she	84	" Nay , it is useless , for he is already distant . Moreover those who went might be taken by the outposts of Rezu , as perchance has happened to your companion wandering in his madness . Do you know what he went to seek ? "
85217	85222	85223	85223	I	0	" More or less , "
85238	85247	85248	85248	she	2024	" It may be as the man writes , "
85367	85367	85361	85361	me	0	"
85398	85423	85424	85424	she	2024	" Does the Black One think that I shall cut him down with his own weapon , I who am so weak and gentle ? "
85429	85475	85368	85368	I	0	" Nay , Ayesha , but it is his law not to part with this Drinker of Lives , which he names ' Chieftainess and Groan - maker , ' and clings to closer by day and night than a man does to his wife . "
85476	85503	85504	85504	she	2024	" There he is wise , Allan , since a savage captain may get more wives but never such another axe . The thing is ancient , "
85513	85594	85504	85504	she	2024	" and who knows ? It may be that whereof the legend tells which is fated to bring Rezu to the dust . Now ask this fierce - eyed Slayer whether , armed with his axe he can find courage to face the most terrible of all men and the strongest , one who is a wizard also , of whom it is prophesied that only by such an axe as this can he be made to bite the dust . "
85604	85650	85652	85652	he	125	" Say to the White Witch that there is no man living upon the earth whom I would not face in war , I who have never been conquered in fair fight , though once a chance blow brought me to the doors of death , "
85661	85726	85652	85652	he	125	" Say to her also that I have no fear of defeat , I from whom doom is , as I think , still far away , though the Opener - of - Roads has told me that among a strange people I shall die in war at last , as I desire to do , who from my boyhood have lived in war . "
85727	85732	85733	85733	she	2032	" He speaks well , "
85744	85781	85741	85741	her	2032	" By Isis , were he but white I would set him to rule these Amahagger under me . Tell him , Allan , that if he lays Rezu low he shall have a great reward . "
85782	85791	85792	85792	Umslopogaas	125	" And tell the White Witch , Macumazahn , "
85799	85856	85792	85792	Umslopogaas	125	" that I seek no reward , save glory only , and with it the sight of one who is lost to me but with whom my heart still dwells , if indeed this Witch has strength to break the wall of blackness that is built between me and her who is ' gone down . ' "
85857	85860	85862	85862	Ayesha	84	" Strange , "
85867	86078	85862	85862	Ayesha	84	" that this grim Destroyer should yet be bound by the silken bonds of love and yearn for one whom the grave has taken . Learn from it , Allan , that all humanity is cast in the same mould , since my longings and your longings are his also , though the three of us be far apart as are the sun and the moon and the earth , and as different in every other quality . Yet it is true that sun and moon and earth are born of the same black womb of chaos . Therefore in the beginning they were identical , as doubtless they will be in the end when , their journeyings done , they rush together to light space with a flame at which the mocking gods that made them may warm their hands . Well , so it is with men , Allan , whose soul - stuff is drawn from the gulf of Spirit by Nature 's hand , and , cast upon the cold air of this death - driven world , freezes into a million shapes each different to the other and yet , be sure , the same . Now talk no more , but follow me . Slave "
86085	86100	86083	86083	Billali	93	" bid the guards lead on to the camp of the servants of Lulala . "
86326	86351	86353	86353	Ayesha	84	" The priests of Lulala who make sacrifice to the moon , as they do night by night , save when she is dead , "
86855	86966	86967	86967	she	2060	" Captains , this very night within two hours we march against Rezu and the sun - worshippers , since otherwise as my arts tell me , they march against us . She - who - commands is immortal , as your fathers have known from generation to generation , and can not be destroyed ; but you , her servants , can be destroyed , and Rezu , who also has drunk of the Cup of Life , out - numbers you by three to one and prepares a queen to set up in my place over his own people and such of you as remain . As though , "
86974	86985	86967	86967	she	2060	" any woman of a day could take my place . "
86996	87108	86986	86986	She	2060	" We hear , O Hiya , and we understand . What wouldst thou have us do , O Lulala - come - to - earth ? The armies of Rezu are great and from the beginning he has hated thee and us , also his magic is as thy magic and his length of days as thy length of days . How then can we who are few , three thousand men at the most , match ourselves against Rezu , Son of the Sun ? Would it not be better that we should accept the terms of Rezu , which are light , and acknowledge him as our king ? "
87181	87356	87174	87174	she	2063	" It seems that I have dealt too gently with you and with your fathers , Children of Lulala , whose shadow I am here upon the earth , so that because you only see the scabbard , you have forgotten the sword within and that it can shine forth and smite . Well , why should I be wrath because the brutish will follow the law of brutes , though it be true that I am minded to slay you where you stand ? Hearken ! Were I less merciful I would leave you to the clutching hands of Rezu , who would drag you one by one to the stone of sacrifice and there offer up your hearts to his god of fire and devour your bodies with his heat . But I bethink me of your wives and children and of your forefathers whom I knew in the dead days , and therefore , if I may , I still would save you from yourselves and your heads from the glowing pot .
87357	87401	87403	87403	she	2065	" Take counsel together now and say - Will you fight against Rezu , or will you yield ? If that is your desire , speak it , and by to - morrow 's sun I will begone , taking these with me , "
87408	87455	87403	87403	she	2065	" whom I have summoned to help us in the war . Aye , I will begone , and when you are stretched upon the stone of sacrifice , and your women and children are the slaves of the men of Rezu , then shall you cry ,
87456	87481	87403	87403	she	2065	" ' Oh , where is Hiya whom our fathers knew ? Oh , will she not return and save us from this hell ? '
87482	87531	87403	87403	she	2065	" Yes , so shall you cry but there shall come no answer , since then she will have departed to her own habitations in the moon and thence appear no more . Now consult together and answer swiftly , since I weary of you and your ways . "
87714	87735	87708	87708	his	468	" If we go up to fight against Rezu , who will lead us in the battle , O Hiya ? "
87736	87744	87745	87745	she	84	" My wisdom shall be your guide , "
87748	87775	87777	87777	she	84	" this white man shall be your General and there stands the warrior who shall meet Rezu face to face and bring him to the dust , "
87846	88024	87842	87843	the spokesman	468	" The choice of a General does not please us , Hiya . We know that the white man is brave because of the fight he made against the men of Rezu over the mountain yonder ; also that he and his followers have weapons that deal death from afar . But there is a prophecy among us of which none know the beginning , that he who commands in the last great battle between Lulala and Rezu must produce before the eyes of the People of Lulala a certain holy thing , a charm of power , without which defeat will be the portion of Lulala . Of this holy thing , this spirit - haunted shape of power , we know the likeness and the fashion , for these have come down among our priests , though who told it to them we can not tell , but of it I will say this only , that it speaks both of the spirit and the body , of man and yet of more than man . "
88025	88050	88052	88052	Ayesha	84	" And if this wondrous charm , this talisman of might , can not be shown by the white lord here , what then ? "
88055	88173	88220	88220	she	84	" Then , Hiya , this is the word of the People of Lulala , that we will not serve under him in the battle , and this also is their word that we will not go up against Rezu . That thou art mighty we know well , Hiya , also that thou canst slay if thou wilt , but we know also that Rezu is mightier and that against him thou hast no power . Therefore kill us if thou dost so desire , until thy heart is satisfied with death . For it is better that we should perish thus than upon the altar of sacrifice wearing the red - hot crowns of Rezu . "
88174	88180	88188	88188	he	2083	" So say we all , "
88192	88214	88216	88216	Ayesha	84	" The thought comes to me to begin to satisfy my heart with thy coward blood and that of thy companions , "
88229	88262	88220	88220	she	84	" O Watcher - by - Night , what counsel ? Is there aught that will convince these chicken - hearted ones over whom I have spread my feathers for so long ? "
88309	88323	88293	88293	he	87	" The Great Medicine , Baas ! Show them Zikali 's Great Medicine . "
88344	88347	88293	88293	he	87	" that spoke "
88364	88379	88380	88380	I	0	" was so vague that it might mean anything or nothing . And yet - -
88421	88444	88411	88411	She	84	" Aye , bravely and to the death , him and the Bearer of the Axe of whom also our legend tells . "
88473	88501	88470	88470	I	0	" Is this the holy thing , the charm of power , of which your legend tells , O People of the Amahagger and worshippers of Lulala ? "
88546	88555	88556	88556	I	0	" Dog ! would you singe my beard ? "
88639	88708	88625	88625	his	468	" It is the Holy Thing ! It is the spirit - haunted Shape of Power itself , and we the Worshippers of Lulala will follow thee to the death , O white lord , Watcher - by - Night . Yes , where thou goest and he goes who bears the Axe , thither will we follow till not one of us is left upon his feet . "
88709	88715	88716	88716	I	0	" Then that 's settled , "
88809	88814	88816	88816	he	125	" Dark - lovers , "
88841	88929	88834	88834	she	84	" These men march at once , three thousand strong , and by dawn will camp on the northern mountain crest . At sunrise litters will come to bear you and those with you if they will , to join them , which you should do by midday . In the afternoon marshall them as you think wise , for the battle will take place in the small hours of the following morning , since the People of Lulala only fight at night . I have said . "
88930	88938	88939	88939	I	0	" Do you not come with us ? "
88944	89097	89103	89103	she	2094	" Nay , not in a war against Rezu , why it matters not . Yet my Spirit will go with you , for I shall watch all that passes , how it matters not and perchance you may see it there - I know not . On the third day from to - morrow we shall meet again in the flesh or beyond it , but as I think in the flesh , and you can claim the reward which you journeyed here to seek . A place shall be prepared for the white lady whom Rezu would have set up as a rival queen to me . Farewell , and farewell also to yonder Bearer of the Axe that shall drink the blood of Rezu , also to the little yellow man who is rightly named Light - in - Darkness , as you shall learn ere all is done . "

91621	91669	91618	91618	he	87	" Indeed I should have done so before , only I knew that you had gone to pay a visit to that tall white ' Missis ' who ties up her head in a blanket , and thought that neither of you would like to be disturbed . "
91670	91676	91677	91677	I	0	" Then you thought wrong , "
91680	91708	91677	91677	I	0	" and what is more , if you had made that visit I think it might have been one from which you would never have come back . "
91709	91715	91717	91717	Hans	87	" Oh yes , Baas , "
91719	91748	91717	91717	Hans	87	" The tall white lady would not have minded . It is you who are so particular , after the fashion of men whom Heaven made very shy . "
91934	91946	91948	91948	she	2219	" hid her face from men because it was so ugly , "
92586	92610	92611	92611	I	0	" But suppose that Rezu should choose to come up to the other ridge and get behind you . What would happen then ? "
92637	92650	92651	92651	I	0	" Do your people fight best at night or in the day ? "
92679	92705	92706	92706	I	0	" And yet you propose to let Rezu join battle with you when the sun is high , or in other words to court defeat , "
92906	92972	92894	92894	I	0	" Hearken , my friend . By your own wish , not mine , I have been appointed your general and I expect to be obeyed without question . From the moment that the advance begins you will keep close to me and to the Black One , and if so much as one of your men hesitates or turns back , you will die , "
92982	93006	92974	92974	I	0	" Moreover , afterwards She - who - commands will see that others of you die , should you escape in the fight . "
93092	93095	93096	93096	I	0	" Good , "
93099	93128	93096	93096	I	0	" Now go back and make ready , and for the rest , by this time to - morrow we shall know who is or is not mad . "
93575	93578	93579	93579	he	87	" Baas , "
93582	93663	93579	93579	he	87	" I am going to look and find out what those people are doing , if they are still there , and then you will know how and when to attack them . Do n't be afraid for me , Baas , it will be easy in that mist and you know I can move like a snake . Also if I should not come back , it does not matter and it will tell you that they are there . "
93688	93727	93685	93685	Umslopogaas	125	" Let the man go . It is his gift and duty to spy , as it is mine to smite with the axe , and yours to lead , Macumazahn . Let him go , I say . "
93912	93927	93929	93929	Umslopogaas	125	" I think that Light - in - Darkness is dead or taken prisoner , "
94102	94120	94121	94121	I	0	" Do n't fire yet , Baas , as I want to tell you my story first . "
94145	94148	94149	94149	I	0	" Well , "
94168	94189	94149	94149	I	0	" tell on , and be quick about it . I suppose you lost your way and never found them . "
94190	94344	94149	94149	I	0	" Yes , Baas , I lost my way for the fog was very thick down there . But in the end I found them all right , by my nose , Baas , for those man - eating people smell strong and I got the wind of one of their sentries . It was easy to pass him in the mist , Baas , so easy that I was tempted to cut his throat as I went , but I did n't for fear lest he should make a noise . No , I walked on right into the middle of them , which was easy too , for they were all asleep , wrapped up in blankets . They had n't any fires perhaps because they did n't want them to be seen , or perhaps because it is so hot down in that low land , I do n't know which .
94345	94482	94149	94149	I	0	" So I crept on taking note of all I saw , till at last I came to a little hill of which the top rose above the level of the mist , so that I could see on it a long hut built of green boughs with the leaves still fresh upon them . Now I thought that I would crawl up to the hut since it came into my mind that Rezu himself must be sleeping there and that I might kill him . But while I stood hesitating I heard a noise like to that made by an old woman whose husband had thrown a blanket over her head to keep her quiet , or to that of a bee in a bottle , a sort of droning noise that reminded me of something .
94483	94621	94149	94149	I	0	" I thought a while and remembered that when Red Beard was on his knees praying to Heaven , as is his habit when he has nothing else to do , Baas , he makes a noise just like that . I crept towards the sound and presently there I found Red Beard himself tied upon a stone and looking as mad as a buffalo bull stuck in a swamp , for he shook his head and rolled his eyes about , just as though he had had two bottles of bad gin , Baas , and all the while he kept saying prayers . Now I thought that I would cut him loose , and bent over him to do so , when by ill - luck he saw my face and began to shout , saying ,
94622	94663	94149	94149	I	0	" ' Go away , you yellow devil . I know you have come to take me to hell , but you are too soon , and if my hands were loose I would twist your head off your shoulders . '
94664	94743	94149	94149	I	0	" He said this in English , Baas , which as you know I can understand quite well , after which I was sure that I had better leave him alone . Whilst I was thinking , there came out of the hut above two old men dressed in night - shirts , such as you white people wear , with yellow things upon their heads that had a metal picture of the sun in front of them . "
94744	94749	94750	94750	I	0	" Medicine - men , "
94753	94841	94149	94149	I	0	" Yes , Baas , or Predikants of some sort , for they were rather like your reverend father when he dressed himself up and went into a box to preach . Seeing them I slipped back a little way to where the mist began , lay down and listened . They looked at Red Beard , for his shouts at me had brought them out , but he took no notice of them , only went on making a noise like a beetle in a tin can .
94842	94892	94149	94149	I	0	" ' It is nothing , ' said one of the Predikants to the other in the same tongue that these Amahagger use . ' But when is he to be sacrificed ? Soon , I hope , for I can not sleep because of the noise he makes . '
94893	94934	94149	94149	I	0	" ' When the edge of the sun appears , not before , ' answered the other Predikant . ' Then the new queen will be brought out of the hut and this white man will be sacrificed to her . '
94935	94973	94149	94149	I	0	" ' I think it is a pity to wait so long , ' said the first Predikant , ' for never shall we sleep in peace until the red - hot pot is on his head . '
94974	95012	94149	94149	I	0	" ' First the victory , then the feast , ' answered the second Predikant , ' though he will not be so good to eat as that fat young woman who was with the new queen . '
95013	95072	94149	94149	I	0	" Then , Baas , they both smacked their lips and one of them went back towards the hut . But the other did not go back . No , he sat down on the ground and glowered at Baas Red - Beard upon the stone . More , he struck him on the face to make him quiet .
95073	95159	94149	94149	I	0	" Now , Baas , when I saw this and remembered that they had said that they had eaten Janee whom I liked although she was such a fool , the spirit in me grew so very angry and I thought that I would give this old skellum i.e. rascal of a Predikant a taste of sacrifice himself , after which I purposed to creep to the hut and see if I could get speech with the Lady Sad - Eyes , if she was there .
95160	95287	94149	94149	I	0	" So I wriggled up behind the Predikant as he sat glowering over Red - Beard , and stuck my knife into his back where I thought it would kill him at once . But it did n't , Baas , for he fell on to his face and began to make a noise like a wounded hyena before I could finish him . Then I heard a sound of shouts , and to save my life was obliged to run away into the mist , without loosing Red - Beard or seeing Lady Sad - Eyes . I ran very hard , Baas , making a wide circle to the left , and so at last got back here . That 's all , Baas . "
95288	95295	95296	95296	I	0	" And quite enough , too , "
95299	95339	95296	95296	I	0	" though if they did not see you , the death of the Medicine - man may frighten them . Poor Janee ! Well , I hope to come even with those devils before they are three hours older . "
95828	95891	95823	95824	hypothetical reader	2334	" Why did n't that silly old fool , Allan , think of all these things ? Why did n't he remember that he was commanding a pack of savages with whom he had no real acquaintance , among whom there were sure to be traitors , especially as they were of the same blood as the Rezuites , and take precautions ?

96276	96306	96270	96270	he	87	" be careful , those Rezu men are on either side ahead . I went forward and ran into them . They threw many spears at me . Look ! "
96503	96517	96518	96518	he	87	" Form the Amahagger into a ring or a square and await attack , "
96534	96557	96521	96521	I	0	" If they were Zulus , the plan would be good . But how do we know that these men will stand ? "
96558	96581	96583	96583	I	0	" We know nothing , Macumazahn , and therefore can only try . If they run it must be up - hill . "

97404	97459	97399	97399	I	0	" Aye , Macumazahn , Rezu himself without doubt , and I rejoice to see him for he will be a worthy foe to fight . Look ! he carries an axe as I do . Now I must save my strength for when we come face to face I shall need it all . "

99759	99764	99765	99765	he	2445	" Who are you ? "
99778	99948	99765	99765	he	2445	" who dare to come face to face with Rezu ? Black hound , do you not know that I can not be slain who have lived a year for every week of your life 's days , and set my foot upon the necks of men by thousands . Have you not seen the spear shatter and the iron balls melt upon my breast like rain - drops , and would you try to bring me down with that toy you carry ? My army is defeated - I know it . But what matters that when I can get me more ? Because the sacrifice was not completed and the white queen was not we d , therefore my army was defeated by the magic of Lulala , the White Witch who dwells in the tombs . But I am not defeated who can not be slain until I show my back , and then only by a certain axe which long ago has rusted into dust . "
99986	99991	99992	99992	I	0	" A certain axe ! "
99995	100077	99992	99992	I	0	" Aye , a certain axe ! Well , look at that which is held by the Black One , the captain who is named Slaughterer , the ancient axe whose title is Chieftainess , because if so she wills , she takes the lives of all . Look at it well , Rezu , Giant and Wizard , and say whether it is not that which your forefather lost , that which is destined to bring you to your doom ? "
100314	100385	100303	100303	he	125	" It is like , very like . The horn haft is the same ; the pointed gouge is the same ; the blade shaped like the young moon is the same . Almost could I think that before me shook the ancient holy axe . Nay , the gods have taken that back long ago and this is but a trick of the witch , Lulala of the Caves . "

104374	104498	104360	104364	the Lady Sad - Eyes	170	K"r I need say nothing , except that in due course we reached that interesting ruin . The journey was chiefly remarkable for one thing , that on this occasion , I imagine for the first and last time in his life , Umslopogaas consented to be carried in a litter , at least for part of the way . He was , as I have said , unwounded , for the axe of his mighty foe had never once so much as touched his skin . What he suffered from was shock , a kind of collapse , since , although few would have thought it , this great and utterly fearless warrior was at bottom a nervous , highly - strung man .

105315	105396	105419	105419	he	93	K"r poor Inez never stirred . Whenever I went to look at her in the litter , I found her lying there with her eyes open and a fixed stare upon her face which frightened me very much , since I began to fear lest she should die . However I could do nothing to help her , except urge the bearers to top speed . So swiftly did we travel down the hill and across the plain that we reached K"r
105487	105492	105493	105493	he	93	" O mighty General , "
105496	105537	105493	105493	he	93	" She - who - commands bids me conduct the lady who is sick to the place that has been made ready for her , which is near your own so that you may watch over her if you will . "

105991	106076	105988	105988	he	87	" things have gone very well with us when they might have gone very ill . The Baas Red - Beard is dead , which is a good thing , since a madman would have been difficult to look after , and a brain full of moonshine is a bad companion for any one . Oh ! without doubt he is better dead , though your reverend father the Predikant will have a hard job looking after him there in the Place of Fires . "
106077	106080	106081	106081	I	0	" Perhaps , "

106116	106123	106125	106125	Hans	87	" Oh , no ! Baas , "
106128	106253	106125	106125	Hans	87	" though I daresay that she will always be a little mad also , because you see it is in her blood and doubtless she has looked on dreadful things . But the Great Medicine will see to it that she does not die after we have taken so much trouble and gone into such big dangers to save her . That Great Medicine is very wonderful , Baas . First of all it makes you General over those Amahagger who without you would never have fought , as the Witch who ties up her head in a cloth knew well enough . Then it brings us safe through the battle and gives strength to Umslopogaas to kill the old man - eating giant . "
106254	106301	106348	106348	he	2585	" Why did it not give me strength to kill him , Hans ? I let him have two Express bullets on his chest , which hurt him no more than a tap upon the horns with a dancing stick would hurt a bull - buffalo . "
106302	106326	106125	106125	Hans	87	" Oh ! Baas , perhaps you missed him , who because you hit things sometimes , think that you do so always . "
106359	106520	106348	106348	he	2585	" Or perhaps he wore very good armour under his beard , for I saw some of those Amahagger who pulled his hair off and cut him to pieces , go away with what looked like little bits of brass . Also the Great Medicine meant that he should be killed by Umslopogaas and not by you , since otherwise Umslopogaas would have been sad for the rest of his life , whereas now he will walk about the world as proud as a cock with two tails and crow all night as well as all day . Then , Baas , when Rezu broke the square and the Amahagger began to run , without doubt it was the Great Medicine which changed their hearts and made them brave again , so that they charged at the right moment when they saw it going forward on your breast , and instead of being eaten up , ate up the cannibals . "
106521	106547	106719	106719	he	87	" Indeed ! I thought that the Lady who dwells yonder had something to do with that business . Did you see her , Hans ? "
106548	106674	106348	106348	he	2585	" Oh , yes ! I saw her , Baas , and I think that without doubt she lifted the cloth from over her head and when the people of Rezu saw how ugly was the face beneath , it did frighten them a little . But doubtless the Great Medicine put that thought into her also , for , Baas , what could a silly woman do in such a case ? Did you ever know of a woman who was of any use in a battle , or for anything else except to nurse babies , and this one does not even do that , no doubt because being so hideous under that sheet , no man can be found to marry her . "
106713	106718	106719	106719	he	87	" Be sure Baas , "
106723	106785	106719	106719	he	87	" that this bundle of rags is nothing but a common old cheat who frightens people by pretending to be a spook , as , if she dared to say that it was she who made those stinking Amahagger charge , and not the Great Medicine of the Opener - of - Roads , I would tell her to her face . "
106905	106911	106913	106913	Ayesha	84	" It seems , Allan , "
106916	107010	106913	106913	Ayesha	84	" that yonder yellow ape of yours is very bold at throwing sticks when the leopardess is not beneath the tree . But when she comes it is otherwise with him . Oh ! make no excuse , for I know well that he was speaking ill things of me , because being curious , as apes are , he burns to learn what is behind my veil , and being simple , believes that no woman would hide her face unless its fashion were not pleasing to the nice taste of men . "
107039	107085	107017	107017	she	84	" Well , let him be , for he is a good ape and courageous in his fashion , as he showed when he went out to spy upon the host of Rezu , and stabbed the murderer - priest by the stone of sacrifice . "
107086	107098	107099	107099	I	0	" How can you know the words of Hans , Ayesha , "
107116	107116	107105	107105	he	2589	"
107117	107125	107017	107017	she	84	" Perchance I read faces , Allan . "
107126	107130	107131	107131	I	0	" Or backs , "
107142	107318	107017	107017	she	84	" Or backs , or voices , or hearts . It matters little which , since read I do . But have done with such childish talk and lead me to this maiden who has been snatched from the claws of Rezu and a fate that is worse than death . Do you understand , Allan , that ere the demon Rezu took her to wife , the plan was to sacrifice her own father to her and then eat him as the woman with her was eaten , and before her eyes ? Now the father is dead , which is well , as I think the little yellow man said to you - nay , start not , I read it from his back Ha ! - JB - since had he lived whose brain was rotted , he would have raved till his death 's day . Better , therefore , that he should die like a man fighting against a foe unconquerable by all save one . But she still lives . "
107319	107327	107462	107462	her	2590	" Aye , but mindless , Ayesha . "
107328	107458	107017	107017	she	84	" Which , in great trouble such as she has passed , is a blessed state , O Allan . Bethink you , have there not been days , aye and months , in your own life when you would have rejoiced to sleep in mindlessness ? And should we not , perchance , be happier , all of us , if like the beasts we could not remember , foreknow and understand ? Oh ! men talk of Heaven , but believe me , the real Heaven is one of dreamless sleep , since life and wakefulness , however high their scale and on whatever star , mean struggle , which being so oft mistaken , must breed sorrow - or remorse that spoils all . Come now . "
107521	107557	107559	107559	she	84	" So they tricked her out to be Ayesha 's mock and image , and in time accepted by those barbarians as my very self , and even set the seals of royalty on her , "
107573	107745	107559	107559	she	84	" Well , she is a fair maiden , white and gently bred , the first such that I have seen for many an age . Nor did she wish this trickery . Moreover she has taken no hurt ; her soul has sunk deep into a sea of horror and that is all , whence doubtless it can be drawn again . Yet I think it best that for a while she should remember naught , lest her brain break , as did her father 's , and therefore no net of mine shall drag her back to memory . Let that return gently in future days , and then of it not too much , for so shall all this terror become to her a void in which sad shapes move like shadows , and as shadows are soon forgot and gone , no more to be held than dreams by the awakening sense . Stand aside , Allan , and you women , leave us for a while . "
107932	107943	107944	107944	she	84	" Look , I have laid a spell upon her , "
107981	107995	107997	107997	Ayesha	84	" So she will remain for this night and that day which follows , "
107999	108107	107997	107997	Ayesha	84	" and when she wakes it will be , I think , to believe herself once more a happy child . Not until she sees her home again will she find her womanhood , and then all this story will be forgotten by her . Of her father you must tell her that he died when you went out to hunt the river - beasts together , and if she seeks for certain others , that they have gone away . But I think that she will ask little more when she learns that he is dead , since I have laid that command upon her soul . "
108108	108112	108114	108114	I	0	" Hypnotic suggestion , "
108118	108130	108114	108114	I	0	" and I only hope to heaven that it will work . "
108148	108209	108143	108143	she	84	" Have no fear , Allan , for I am what the black axe - bearer and the little yellow man called a ' witch ' which means , as you who are instructed know , one who has knowledge of medicine and other things and who holds a key to some of the mysteries that lie hid in Nature . "
108210	108214	108215	108215	I	0	" For instance , "
108218	108244	108215	108215	I	0	" of how to transport yourself into a battle at the right moment , and out of it again - also at the right moment . "
108245	108288	108302	108302	she	2595	" Yes , Allan , since watching from afar , I saw that those Amahagger curs were about to flee and that I was needed there to hearten them and to put fear into the army of Rezu . So I came . "
108289	108298	108215	108215	I	0	" But how did you come , Ayesha ? "
108305	108332	108302	108302	she	2595	" Perhaps I did not come at all . Perhaps you only thought I came ; since I seemed to be there the rest matters nothing . "
108342	108381	108338	108338	she	2595	" Oh ! foolish man , seek not to learn of that which is too high for you . Yet listen . You in your ignorance suppose that the soul dwells within the body , do you not ? "
108393	108410	108299	108299	She	2595	" Yet , Allan , it is otherwise , for the body dwells within the soul . "
108411	108419	108420	108420	I	0	" Like the pearl in an oyster , "
108423	108546	108299	108299	She	2595	" Aye , in a sense , since the pearl which to you is beautiful , is to the oyster a sickness and a poison , and so is the body to the soul whose temple it troubles and defiles . Yet round it is the white and holy soul that ever seeks to bring the vile body to its own purity and colour , yet oft - times fails . Learn , Allan , that flesh and spirit are the deadliest foes joined together by a high decree that they may forget their hate and perfect each other , or failing , be separate to all eternity , the spirit going to its own place and the flesh to its corruption . "
108547	108552	108553	108553	I	0	" A strange theory , "
108556	108709	108299	108299	She	2595	" Aye , Allan , and one which is so new to you that never will you understand it . Yet it is true and I set it out for this reason . The soul of man , being at liberty and not cooped within his narrow breast , is in touch with that soul of the Universe , which men know as God Whom they call by many names . Therefore it has all knowledge and perhaps all power , and at times the body within it , if it be a wise body , can draw from this well of knowledge and abounding power . So at least can I. And now you will understand why I am so good a doctoress and how I came to appear in the battle , as you said , at the right time , and to leave it when my work was done . "
108710	108715	108716	108716	I	0	" Oh ! yes , "
108719	108734	108716	108716	I	0	" I quite understand . I thank you much for putting it so plainly . "
108753	108801	108735	108735	She	2596	" The fair body of this lady dwells in a large soul , I think , though one of a somewhat sombre hue , for souls have their colours , Allan , and stain that which is within them . She will never be a happy woman . "
108802	108812	108813	108813	I	0	" The black people named her Sad - Eyes , "
108816	108866	108735	108735	She	2596	" Is it so ? Well , I name her Sad - Heart , though for such often there is joy at last . Meanwhile she will forget ; yes , she will forget the worst and how narrow was the edge between her and the arms of Rezu . "
108867	108880	108881	108881	I	0	" Just the width of the blade of the axe , Inkosikaas , "
108884	108914	108881	108881	I	0	" But tell me , Ayesha , why could not that axe cut and why did my bullets flatten or turn aside when these smote the breast of Rezu ? "
108915	108929	108930	108930	she	2598	" Because his front - armour was good , Allan , I suppose , "
108934	108943	108930	108930	she	2598	" and on his back he wore none . "
108944	108974	108975	108975	I	0	" Then why did you fill my ears with such a different tale about that horrible giant having drunk of a Cup of Life , and all the rest ? "
108980	109039	109050	109050	She	2598	" I have forgotten , Allan . Perhaps because the curious , such as you are , like to hear tales even stranger than their own , which in the days to be may become their own . Therefore you will be wise to believe only what I do , and of what I tell you , nothing . "
109040	109045	109046	109046	I	0	" I do n't , "
109056	109256	109050	109050	She	2598	" What need to say to me that which I know already ? Yet perhaps in the future it may be different , since often by the alchemy of the mind the fables of our youth are changed into the facts of our age , and we come to believe in anything , as your little yellow man believes in some savage named Zikali , and those Amahagger believe in the talisman round your neck , and I who am the maddest of you all , believe in Love and Wisdom , and the black warrior , Umslopogaas , believes in the virtue of that great axe of his , rather than in those of his own courage and of the strength that wields it . Fools , every one of us , though perchance I am the greatest fool among them . Now take me to the warrior , Umslopogaas , whom I would thank , as I thank you , Allan , and the little yellow man , although he jeers at me with his sharp tongue , not knowing that if I were angered , with a breath I could cause him to cease to be . "
109257	109277	109050	109050	She	2598	" Then why did you not choose Rezu to cease to be , and his army also , Ayesha ? "
109278	109316	109050	109050	She	2598	" It seems that I have done these things through the axe of Umslopogaas and by the help of your generalship , Allan . Why then , waste my own strength when yours lay to my hand ? "
109317	109334	109050	109050	She	2598	" Because you had no power over Rezu , Ayesha , or so you told me . "
109335	109445	109050	109050	She	2598	" Have I not said that my words are snowflakes , meant to melt and leave no trace , hiding my thoughts as this veil hides my beauty ? Yet as the beauty is beneath the veil , perchance there is truth beneath the words , though not that truth you think . So you are well answered , and for the rest , I wonder whether Rezu thought I had no power over him when yonder on the mountain spur he saw me float down upon his companies like a spirit of the night . Well , perchance some day I shall learn this and many other things . "
109534	109543	109544	109544	she	2599	" I wish to tell you , Allan , "
109547	109613	109544	109544	she	2599	" why it was those Amahagger would not accept you as a General till their eyes had seen that which you wear upon your breast . Their tale of a legend of this very thing seemed that of savages or of their cunning priests , not to be believed by a wise man such as you are , like some others that you have heard in K"r
109692	109744	109748	109748	him	2607	" At that time I have heard there was a question of war between the worshippers of Lulala and the grandfather of Rezu . But this Zikali told the People of Lulala that they must not fight the People of Rezu until in a day to come a white man should visit K"r
109817	109817	109813	109813	you	2611	"
109818	109823	109824	109824	I	0	" Oh ! yes , "
109827	109861	109824	109824	I	0	" except that I do not see how Zikali can have come here a hundred years ago , since men do not live as long , although he pretends to have done so . "
109862	109921	109938	109938	she	84	" No , Allan , nor do I , but perhaps it was his father , or his grandfather who came , since being observant , you will have noted that if the parent is mis - formed , so often are the descendants ; also that the pretence of wizardry at times comes down with the blood . "
110072	110138	110069	110069	she	84	" I come to thank you and your men , O Wielder of the Axe , who have shown yourself very great in battle , and to say to you that my Spirit tells me that every one of you , yes , even those who are still sick , will come safe to your own land again and live out your years with honour . "
110168	110248	110164	110164	she	2619	" I am told , Umslopogaas , Son of the Lion , as a certain king was named in your land , that the fight you made against Rezu was a very great fight , and that such a leap as yours above his head when you smote him with the axe on the hinder parts where he wore no armour , and brought him to his death , has not been seen before , nor will be again . "
110270	110279	110280	110280	Ayesha	84	" Because of that fight and that leap , "
110284	110399	110280	110280	Ayesha	84	" as for other deeds that you have done and will do , my Spirit tells me that your name will live in story for many generations . Yet of what use is fame to the dead ? Therefore I make you an offer . Bide here with me and you shall rule these Amahagger , and with them the remnant of the People of Rezu . Your cattle shall be countless and your wives the fairest in the land , and your children many , for I will lift a certain curse from off you so that no more shall you be childless . Do you accept , O Holder of the Axe ? "
110515	110521	110522	110522	she	2622	" Tell him , Allan , "
110531	110654	110522	110522	she	2622	" that you will not stop here and marry me , because if ever I chose a husband he would not be a little man at the doors of whose heart so many women 's hands have knocked - yes , even those that are black - and not , I think , in vain . One , moreover , who holds himself so clever that he believes he has nothing left to learn , and in every flower of truth that is shown to him , however fair , smells only poison , and beneath , nurturing it , sees only the gross root of falsehood planted in corruption . Tell him these things , Allan , if it pleases you . "
110655	110662	110663	110663	I	0	" It does not please me , "
110672	110751	110663	110663	I	0	" Nor is it needful , Allan , since if I caught the meaning of that barbarous tongue you use aright , you have told him already . Well , let the jest pass , O man who least of all things desires to be Ayesha 's husband , and whom Ayesha least of all things desires as her spouse , and ask the Axe - bearer nothing since I perceive that without you he will not stay at K"r

110935	111021	110932	110932	Ayesha	84	" True , I had forgotten . Your heart also is hungry , I think , Allan , for the vision of sundry faces that you see no more . Well , I will do my best , but since only faith fulfils itself , how can I who must strive to pierce the gates of darkness for one so unbelieving , know that they will open at my word ? Come to me , both of you , at the sunset to - morrow . "
111039	111059	111030	111030	she	2627	K"r , of which she told me a most interesting history , true or false , that I omit here .

111170	111237	111247	111247	Ayesha	84	K"r , of which I was heartily tired . Who could desire to stay in a place where he had not only been involved in a deal of hard , doubtful , and very dangerous fighting from which all personal interest was absent , but where also he was meshed in a perfect spider 's web of bewilderment , and exposed to continual insult into the bargain ?

113434	113491	113431	113431	I	0	" upon what the cattle and wives were like . If the cattle had red - water and would bring disease into your herd , or wild bulls that would gore you , and the wives were skinny old widows with evil tongues , then I think you would look as do those men , Hans . "
113540	113549	113551	113551	Hans	87	" I never thought of that , Baas , "
113553	113570	113551	113551	Hans	87	" but it is true that all gifts are not good , especially witches ' gifts . "

114051	114076	114038	114038	he	168	K"r as it did elsewhere , also whether it had smitten them altogether or leapt from man to man . This , as a professional "
114081	114093	114038	114038	he	168	" he declared he could tell from the marks upon these unfortunates .
114245	114248	114250	114250	Hans	87	" Baas , "
114252	114315	114250	114250	Hans	87	" I believe that these were the traitors who slipped away and told Rezu of our plans so that he attacked us on the ridge , instead of our attacking him on the plain as we had arranged so nicely . At least they were none of them in the battle and afterwards I heard the Amahagger talking of some of them . "
114346	114374	114331	114332	Meanwhile Goroko	168	" These doomed ones died not by lightning but by witchcraft . There is not a burn upon one of them , nor are their garments scorched . "
114416	114422	114423	114423	I	0	" Does lightning always scorch ? "
114427	114432	114433	114433	he	168	" Always , Macumazahn , "
114436	114499	114501	114501	he	168	" that is , if he who has been struck is killed , as these are , and not only stunned . Moreover , most of yonder dead wear knives which should have melted or shattered with the sheaths burnt off them . Yet those knives are as though they had just left the smith 's hammer and the whet - stone , "
114553	114556	114558	114558	Umslopogaas	125	" Ow ! "
114560	114593	114558	114558	Umslopogaas	125	" this is witchcraft , not Heaven - wrath . The place is enchanted . Let us get away lest we be smitten also who have not earned doom like those traitors . "
114594	114600	114602	114602	Hans	87	" No need to fear , "
114630	114630	114621	114623	an old woman	1191	"
114697	114748	114754	114754	she	2721	K"r was a queer place with its legends , its sullen Amahagger and its mysterious queen , to whom at times , in spite of my inner conviction to the contrary , I was still inclined to attribute powers beyond those that are common even among very beautiful and able women .
115032	115037	115015	115015	he	93	" with his axe . "
115038	115044	115045	115045	I	0	" That generally accompanies him , "
115162	115170	115171	115171	he	1606	" The sun has set , Macumazahn , "
115174	115210	115171	115171	he	1606	" and it is time to visit this white queen as she bade us , and to learn whether she can indeed lead us ' down below ' where the dead are said to dwell . "
115244	115248	115227	115227	I	0	" down below , "
115258	115304	115305	115305	he	1606	" Why should I fear to tread a road that awaits the feet of all of us and at the gate of which we knock day by day , especially if we chance to live by war , as do you and I , Macumazahn ? "
115318	115322	115323	115323	I	0	" Why indeed ? "
115330	115340	115323	115323	I	0	" though I should much prefer any other highway . "
115474	115478	115481	115481	he	1606	" White Witch . "
115562	115588	115559	115559	she	84	" How comes it that you are late ? Those that seek their lost loves should run with eager feet , but yours have tarried . "
115607	115689	115603	115603	she	84	" I think , Allan , that your sandals , which should be winged like to those of the Roman Mercury , are weighted with the grey lead of fear . Well , it is not strange , since you have come to travel through the Gates of Death that are feared by all , even by Ayesha 's self , for who knows what he may find beyond them ? Ask the Axe - Bearer if he also is afraid . "
115708	115714	115719	115719	he	125	" Say to the Queen , "
115722	115839	115719	115719	he	125	" that I fear nothing , except women 's tongues . I am ready to pass the Gates of Death and , if need be , to come back no more . With the white people I know it is otherwise because of some dark teachings to which they listen , that tell of terrors to be , such as we who are black do not dread . Still , we believe that there are ghosts and that the spirits of our fathers live on and as it chances I would learn whether this is so , who above all things desire to met a certain ghost , for which reason I journeyed to this far land .
115840	115902	115696	115696	she	84	" Say these things to the white Queen , Macumazahn , and tell her that if she should send me to a place whence there is no return , I who do not love the world , shall not blame her overmuch , though it is true that I should have chosen to die in war . Now I have spoken . "
115920	116083	115914	115914	her	84	" This black Captain has a spirit as brave as his body , but how is it with your spirit , Allan ? Are you also prepared to risk so much ? Learn that I can promise you nothing , save that when I loose the bonds of your mortality and send out your soul to wander in the depths of Death , as I believe that I can do , though even of this I am not certain - you must pass through a gate of terrors that may be closed behind you by a stronger arm than mine . Moreover , what you will find beyond it I do not know , since be sure of this , each of us has his own heaven or his own hell , or both , that soon or late he is doomed to travel . Now will you go forward , or go back ? Make choice while there is still time . "
116181	116233	116173	116173	She	84	" Bethink you , Allan . Am I , whose face you have seen , a meet companion for a man who desires to visit the loves that once were his ? What would they say or think , if they should see you hand in hand with such a one ? "
116234	116244	116245	116245	I	0	" I do n't know and do n't care , "
116249	116286	116245	116245	I	0	" but this is the kind of journey on which one requires a guide who knows the road . Can not Umslopogaas go first and come back to tell me how it has fared with him ? "
116287	116383	116385	116385	she	2733	" If the brave and instructed white lord , panoplied in the world 's last Faith , is not ashamed to throw the savage in his ignorance out like a feather to test the winds of hell and watch the while to learn whether these blow him back unscorched , or waft him into fires whence there is no return , perchance it might so be ordered , Allan . Ask him yourself , Allan , if he is willing to run this errand for your sake . Or perhaps the little yellow man - - "
116411	116416	116417	116417	he	87	" No , Baas , "
116427	116517	116417	116417	he	87	" not me . I do n't care for hunting spooks , Baas , which leave no spoor that you can follow and are always behind when you think they are in front . Also there are too many of them waiting for me down there and how can I stand up to them until I am a spook myself and know their ways of fighting ? Also if you should die when your spirit is away , I want to be left that I may bury you nicely . "
116518	116522	116523	116523	I	0	" Be silent , "
116563	116597	116552	116552	I	0	" I am ready to make this journey through the gate of Death , Ayesha , if indeed you can show me the road . For one purpose and no other I came to K"r
116628	116628	116625	116625	I	0	"
116633	116636	116638	116638	Ayesha	84	" Yes , "
116644	116674	116638	116638	Ayesha	84	" for that purpose alone , O truth - seeking Allan , whose curiosity is so fierce that the wide world can not hold it , did you come to K"r
116741	116785	116736	116736	I	0	K"r for my own purposes , not your desire , nor Zikali 's map and talisman , since had not the white lady who lies sick been stolen by Rezu , never would you have pursued the journey nor found the way hither . "
116786	116799	116800	116800	I	0	" How could you have had anything to do with that business ? "
116822	116880	116811	116811	I	0	" That , Allan , is a question over which you will wonder for a long while either beneath or beyond the sun , as you will wonder concerning much that has to do with me , which your little mind , shut in its iron box of ignorance and pride , can not understand to - day .
116881	117078	117095	117095	she	2742	" For example , you have been wondering , I am sure , how the lightning killed those eleven men whose bodies you went to look on an hour or two ago , and left the rest untouched . Well , I will tell you at once that it was not lightning that killed them , although the strength within me was manifest to you in storm , but rather what that witch - doctor of your following called wizardry . Because they were traitors who betrayed your army to Rezu , I killed them with my wrath and by the wand of my power . Oh ! you do not believe , yet perhaps ere long you will , since thus to fulfil your prayer I must also kill you - almost . That is the trouble , Allan . To kill you outright would be easy , but to kill you just enough to set your spirit free and yet leave one crevice of mortal life through which it can creep back again , that is most difficult ; a thing that only I can do and even of myself I am not sure . "
117079	117088	117089	117089	I	0	" Pray do not try the experiment - - "
117100	117184	117095	117095	she	2742	" Disturb me no more , Allan , with the tremors and changes of your uncertain mind , lest you should work more evil than you think , and making mine uncertain also , spoil my skill . Nay , do not try to fly , for already the net has thrown itself about you and you can not stir , who are bound like a little gilded wasp in the spider 's web , or like birds beneath the eyes of basilisks . "
119832	119839	119816	119816	her	2807	" Wind - that - wailed . "
119852	119869	119870	119870	she	2807	" Art there , Watcher - in - the - Night , watching in the light ? "
119891	119894	119895	119895	she	2807	" Aye , "
119899	119984	119895	119895	she	2807	" I know that thou art there ; from ten thousand leagues away I felt thy presence and broke from my own place to welcome thee , though I must pay for it with burning chains and bondage . How did those welcome thee whom thou camest out to seek ? Did they clasp thee in their arms and press their kisses on thy brow ? Or did they shrink away from thee because the smell of earth was on thy hands and lips ? "
120001	120100	119990	119990	they	2809	" Aye , they did not know because their love is not enough , because they have grown too fine for love . But I , the sinner , I knew well , and here am I ready to suffer all for thee and to give thee place within this stormy heart of mine . Forget them , then , and come to rule with me who still am queen in my own house that thou shalt share . There we will live royally and when our hour comes , at least we shall have had our day . "
120133	120211	120121	120121	she	2810	" For a little while farewell , but remember always that Mameena , the Wailing Wind , being still as a sinful woman in a woman 's love and of the earth , earthy , found thee , whom all the rest forgot . O Watcher - in - the - Night , watch in the night for me , for there thou shalt find me , the Child of Storm , again , and yet again . "
120299	120316	120297	120297	she	2810	" as a sinful woman with a woman 's love and of the earth , earthy , "
120812	120814	120807	120807	she	84	" you "
120823	120826	120807	120807	she	84	" thou , "
120836	120845	120846	120846	she	84	" Thou hast made thy journey , Allan , "
120849	120907	120846	120846	she	84	" and what thou hast seen there thou shalt tell me presently . Yet from thy mien I gather this - that thou art glad to look upon flesh and blood again and , after the company of spirits , to find that of mortal woman . Come then and sit beside me and tell thy tale . "
120908	120914	120915	120915	I	0	" Where are the others ? "
120934	120990	121006	121006	she	2831	" Gone , Allan , who as I think have had enough of ghosts , which is perhaps thy case also . Come , drink this and be a man once more . Drink it to me whose skill and power have brought thee safe from lands that human feet were never meant to tread , "
121156	121184	121126	121126	she	2831	" Now that thou art a man again , Allan , tell me what thou didst see when thou wast more - or less - than man . "
121216	121224	121225	121225	she	2831	" There is truth in thy dream , "
121232	121237	121225	121225	she	2831	" a lesson also . "
121238	121246	121247	121247	I	0	" Then it was all a dream ? "
121250	121446	121225	121225	she	2831	" Is not everything a dream , even life itself , Allan ? If so , what can this be that thou hast seen , but a dream within a dream , and itself containing other dreams , as in the old days the ball fashioned by the eastern workers of ivory would oft be found to contain another ball , and this yet another and another and another , till at the inmost might be found a bead of gold , or perchance a jewel , which was the prize of him who could draw out ball from ball and leave them all unbroken . That search was difficult and rarely was the jewel come by , if at all , so that some said there was none , save in the maker 's mind . Yes , I have seen a man go crazed with seeking and die with the mystery unsolved . How much harder , then , is it to come at the diamond of Truth which lies at the core of all our nest of dreams and without which to rest upon they could not be fashioned to seem realities ? "
121447	121467	121468	121468	I	0	" But was it really a dream , and if so , what were the truth and the lesson ? "
121488	121574	121597	121597	her	2831	" The first question has been answered , Allan , as well as I can answer , who am not the architect of this great globe of dreams , and as yet can not clearly see the ineffable gem within , whose prisoned rays illuminate their substance , though so dimly that only those with the insight of a god can catch their glamour in the night of thought , since to most they are dark as glow - flies in the glare of noon . "
121575	121585	121586	121586	I	0	" Then what are the truth and the lesson ? "
121620	121699	121597	121597	her	2831	" Thou tellest me , Allan , that in thy dream or vision thou didst seem to appear before thyself seated on a throne and in that self to find thy judge . That is the Truth whereof I spoke , though how it found its way through the black and ignorant shell of one whose wit is so small , is more than I can guess , since I believed that it was revealed to me alone . "
121791	121799	121800	121800	she	84	" All men worship their own god , "
121804	121942	121800	121800	she	84	" and yet seem not to know that this god dwells within them and that of him they are a part . There he dwells and there they mould him to their own fashion , as the potter moulds his clay , though whatever the shape he seems to take beneath their fingers , still he remains the god infinite and unalterable . Still he is the Seeker and the Sought , the Prayer and its Fulfilment , the Love and the Hate , the Virtue and the Vice , since all these qualities the alchemy of his spirit turns into an ultimate and eternal Good . For the god is in all things and all things are in the god , whom men clothe with such diverse garments and whose countenance they hide beneath so many masks .
121943	122131	121766	121766	she	84	" In the tree flows the sap , yet what knows the great tree it nurtures of the sap ? In the world 's womb burns the fire that gives life , yet what of the fire knows the glorious earth it conceived and will destroy ; in the heavens the great globes swing through space and rest not , yet what know they of the Strength that sent them spinning and in a time to come will stay their mighty motions , or turn them to another course ? Therefore of everything this all - present god is judge , or rather , not one but many judges , since of each living creature he makes its own magistrate to deal out justice according to that creature 's law which in the beginning the god established for it and decreed . Thus in the breast of everyone there is a rule and by that rule , at work through a countless chain of lives , in the end he shall be lifted up to Heaven , or bound about and cast down to Hell and death . "
122132	122138	122139	122139	I	0	" You mean a conscience , "
122152	122291	121766	121766	she	84	" Aye , a conscience , if thou wilt , and canst only understand that term , though it fits my theme but ill . This is my meaning , that consciences , as thou namest them , are many . I have one ; thou , Allan , hast another ; that black Axe - bearer has a third ; the little yellow man a fourth , and so on through the tale of living things . For even a dog such as thou sawest has a conscience and - like thyself or I - must in the end be its own judge , because of the spark that comes to it from above , the same spark which in me burns as a great fire , and in thee as a smouldering ember of green wood . "
122292	122308	122309	122309	I	0	" When you sit in judgment on yourself in a day to come , Ayesha , "
122315	122331	122309	122309	I	0	" I trust that you will remember that humility did not shine among your virtues . "
122377	122381	122382	122382	she	2835	" Well answered , "
122385	122401	122382	122382	she	2835	" Goad the patient ox enough and even it will grow fierce and paw the ground .
122402	122475	122335	122335	her	2835	" Humility ! What have I to do with it , O Allan ? Let humility be the part of the humble - souled and lowly , but for those who reign as I do , and they are few indeed , let there be pride and the glory they have earned . Now I have told thee of the Truth thou sawest in thy vision and wouldst thou hear the Lesson ? "
122476	122479	122480	122480	I	0	" Yes , "
122505	122505	122485	122485	I	0	"
122506	122670	122480	122480	I	0	" The Lesson , Allan , is one which thou preachest - humility . Vain man and foolish as thou art , thou didst desire to travel the Underworld in search of certain ones who once were all in all to thee - nay , not all in all since of them there were two or more - but at least much . Thus thou wouldst do because , as thou saidest , thou didst seek to know whether they still lived on beyond the gates of Blackness . Yes , thou saidest this , but what thou didst hope to learn in truth was whether they lived on in thee and for thee only . For thou , thou in thy vanity , didst picture these departed souls as doing naught in that Heaven they had won , save think of thee still burrowing on the earth , and , at times lightening thy labours with kisses from other lips than theirs . "
122671	122674	122675	122675	I	0	" Never ! "
122679	122687	122675	122675	I	0	" Never ! it is not true . "
122688	122897	122480	122480	I	0	" Then I pray pardon , Allan , who only judged of thee by others that were as men are made , and being such , not to be blamed if perchance from time to time , they turned to look on women , who alas ! were as they are made . So at least it was when I knew the world , but mayhap since then its richest wine has turned to water , whereby I hope it has been bettered . At the least this was thy thought , that those women who had been thine for an hour , through all eternity could dream of naught else save thy perfections , and hope for naught else than to see thee at their sides through that eternity , or such part of thee as thou couldst spare to each of them . For thou didst forget that where they have gone there may be others even more peerless than thou art and more fit to hold a woman 's love , which as we know on earth was ever changeful , and perhaps may so remain where it is certain that new lights must shine and new desires beckon . Dost understand me , Allan ? "
122898	122903	122904	122904	I	0	" I think so , "
122910	122941	122904	122904	I	0	" I understand you to mean that worldly impressions soon wear out and that people who have departed to other spheres may there form new ties and forget the old . "
122942	122987	122480	122480	I	0	" Yes , Allan , as do those who remain upon this earth , whence these others have departed . Do men and women still re - marry in the world , Allan , as in my day they were wo nt to do ? "
122988	122996	122904	122904	I	0	" Of course - it is allowed . "
122997	123045	122480	122480	I	0	" As many other things , or perchance this same thing , may be allowed elsewhere , for when there are so many habitations from which to choose , why should we always dwell in one of them , however strait the house or poor the prospect ? "
123057	123060	122480	122480	I	0	" and the "
123063	123172	122904	122904	I	0	" I should have grown angry , had not a certain sense of humour come to my rescue , who remembered that after all Ayesha 's satire was profoundly true . Why , beyond the earth , should anyone desire to remain unalterably tied to and inextricably wrapped up in such a personality as my own , especially if others of superior texture abounded about them ? Now that I came to think of it , the thing was absurd and not to be the least expected in the midst of a thousand new and vivid interests . I had met with one more disillusionment , that was all .
123173	123179	123182	123182	Ayesha	84	" Dost understand , Allan , "
123199	123277	123182	123182	Ayesha	84	" that these dwellers in the sun , or the far planet where thou hast been according to thy tale , saw thee not and knew naught of thee ? It may chance therefore that at this time thou wast not in their minds which at others dream of thee continually . Or it may chance that they never dream of thee at all , having quite forgotten thee , as the weaned cub forgets its mother . "
123278	123289	123290	123290	I	0	" At least there was one who seemed to remember , "
123304	123312	123290	123290	I	0	" one woman and - a dog . "
123313	123334	123182	123182	Ayesha	84	" Aye , the savage , who being Nature 's child , a sinner that departed hence by her own act "
123349	123493	123344	123344	I	0	" has not yet put on perfection and therefore still remembers him whose kiss was last upon her lips . But surely , Allan , it is not thy desire to pass from the gentle , ordered claspings of those white souls for the tumultuous arms of such a one as this . Still , let that be , for who knows what men will or will not do in jealousy and disappointed love ? And the dog , it remembered also and even sought thee out , since dogs are more faithful and single - hearted than is mankind . There at least thou hast thy lesson , namely to grow more humble and never to think again that thou holdest all a woman 's soul for aye , because once she was kind to thee for a little while on earth . "
123494	123497	123498	123498	I	0	" Yes , "
123507	123582	123498	123498	I	0	" as you say , I have my lesson , and more of it than I want . So by your leave , I will now bid you farewell , hoping that when it comes to be your turn to learn this lesson , or a worse , Ayesha , as I am sure it will one day , for something tells me so , you may enjoy it more than I have done . "
124269	124276	124277	124277	I	0	" What has happened to you ? "
124284	124287	124288	124288	she	84	" Naught , "
124358	124358	124359	124359	I	0	"
124412	124556	124397	124397	she	84	" Because as I have told thee , Allan , there is no armour that can turn the spear of Destiny which , when I heard those words of thine , it seemed to me , I know not why , was directed by thy hand . Look now on Rezu who thought himself unconquerable and yet was slain by the black Axe - bearer and whose bones to - night stay the famine of the jackals . Moreover I am accursed who sought to steal its servant from Heaven to be my love , and how know I when and where vengeance will fall at last ? Indeed , it has fallen already on me , who through the long ages amid savages must mourn widowed and alone , but not all of it - oh ! I think , not all . "
124734	124743	124744	124744	I	0	" I pray you , do not weep , "
124747	124765	124744	124744	I	0	" it hurts me and indeed I am sorry if I said anything to give you pain . "
124784	124790	124791	124791	I	0	" You know , Ayesha , "
124794	124825	124791	124791	I	0	" you have said many hard things to me , making me the target of your bitter wit , therefore it is not strange that at last I answered you . "
124826	124836	124837	124837	she	84	" And hast thou not deserved them , Allan ? "
124852	124855	124856	124856	I	0	" Why ? "
124859	124950	124791	124791	I	0	" Because from the beginning thou didst defy me , showing in thine every accent that thou heldest me a liar and one of no account in body or in spirit , one not worthy of thy kind look , or of those gentle words which once were my portion among men . Oh ! thou hast dealt hardly with me and therefore perchance - I know not - I paid thee back with such poor weapons as a woman holds , though all the while I liked thee well . "
125053	125060	125037	125037	her	84	" What ails thee , Allan ? "
125061	125066	125067	125067	I	0	" Oh , nothing , "
125070	125085	125067	125067	I	0	" only I remembered the story you told me about some man called Kallikrates . "
125089	125169	125086	125086	She	84	" And what of Kallikrates , Allan ? Is it not enough that for my sins , with tears , empty longings and repentance , I must wait for him through all the weary centuries ? Must I also wear the chains of this Kallikrates , to whom I owe many a debt , when he is far away ? Say , didst thou see him in that Heaven of thine , Allan , for there perchance he dwells ? "
125251	125264	125241	125241	she	84	" Stay ! What meanest thou ? Dost love me , Allan ? "
125265	125275	125276	125276	I	0	" I think so - that is - yes , "
125295	125301	125302	125302	she	84	" What words are these , "
125305	125397	125302	125302	she	84	" that they pass thy lips so easily and so unmeant , perchance from long practice ? Oh ! Allan , I am astonished . Art thou the same man who some few days ago told me , and this unasked , that as soon wouldst thou think of courting the moon as of courting me ? Art thou he who not a minute gone swore proudly that never had his heart and his lips wandered from certain angels whither they should not ? And now , and now - - ? "
125408	125414	125398	125398	I	0	" Let me be gone ! "
125415	125428	125430	125430	she	84	" Nay , Allan , why ? I see no mark here , "
125440	125460	125461	125461	she	84	" Thou art too much what thou wert before , except perhaps in thy soul , which is invisible , "
125469	125569	125461	125461	she	84	" Nor am I angry with thee ; indeed , hadst thou not tried to charm away my woe , I should have thought but poorly of thee as a man . There let it rest and be forgotten - or remembered as thou wilt . Still , in answer to thy words concerning my Kallikrates , what of those adored ones that , according to thy tale , but now thou didst find again in a place of light ? Because they seemed faithless , shouldst thou be faithless also ? Shame on thee , thou fickle Allan ! "
125597	125603	125604	125604	she	84	" Thou thinkest , Allan , "
125608	125696	125604	125604	she	84	" that I have cast my net about thee , and this is true . Learn wisdom from it , Allan , and never again defy a woman - that is , if she be fair , for then she is stronger than thou art , since Nature for its own purpose made her so . Whatever I have done by tears , that ancient artifice of my sex , as in other ways , is for thy instruction , Allan , that thou mayest benefit thereby . "
125726	125811	125716	125716	she	84	" Nay , leave me not yet since , even if the light fancy of a man that comes and goes like the evening wind and for a breath made me dear to thee , has passed away , there remains certain work which we must do together . Although , thinking of thyself alone , thou hast forgotten it , having been paid thine own fee , one is yet due to that old wizard in a far land who sent thee to visit K"r
125826	125826	125817	125817	he	2852	"
125849	125855	125856	125856	she	84	" Again thou disbelievest me , "
125864	125916	125856	125856	she	84	" Do so once more , Allan , and I swear I 'll bring thee to grovel on the ground and kiss my foot and babble nonsense to a woman sworn to another man , such as never for all thy days thou shalt think of without a blush of shame . "
125917	125922	125923	125923	I	0	" Oh ! no , "
125928	125956	125923	125923	I	0	" I assure you that you are mistaken . I believe every word you have said , or say or will say ; I do in truth . "
125957	125977	125856	125856	she	84	" Now thou liest . Well , what is one more falsehood among so many ? Let it pass . "
125978	125983	125984	125984	I	0	" What , indeed ? "
125990	125999	125984	125984	I	0	" and as for Zikali 's message - - "
126004	126043	125856	125856	she	84	" It was to recall to my mind that he desired to learn whether a certain great enterprise of his will succeed , the details of which he says thou canst tell me . Repeat them to me . "
126096	126217	126219	126219	she	2855	" So now he yearns to know whether he will conquer or be conquered ; and that is why he sent , or thinks that he sent thee on this journey , not for thy sake , Allan , but for his own . I can not tell thee , for what have I do to with the finish of this petty business , which to him seems so large ? Still , as I owe him a debt for luring the Axe - Bearer here to rid me of mine enemy , and thee to lighten my solitude for an hour by the burnishing of thy mind , I will try . Set that bowl before me , Allan , "
126235	126254	126219	126219	she	2855	" and come , sit close by me and look into it , telling me what thou seest . "
126288	126294	126295	126295	I	0	" This seems rather foolish , "
126329	126343	126354	126354	she	2855	" What am I supposed to do ? I see nothing at all . "
126344	126348	126349	126349	she	2855	" Look again , "
126512	126515	126504	126504	I	0	" Finished . "
126567	126575	126576	126576	she	84	" Thy vision is good , Allan , "
126580	126772	126576	126576	she	84	" and wide also , since thou canst see what passes in the sun or distant stars , and pictures of things to be in the water , to say nothing of other pictures in a woman 's eyes , all within an hour . Well , this savage business concerns me not and of it I want to know no more . Yet it would appear that here the old wizard who is thy friend , has the answer that he desires . For there in the picture the king he hates lies dying while he hisses in his ear and thou dost watch the end . What more can he seek ? Tell him it when ye meet , and tell him also it is my will that in future he should trouble me less , since I love not to be wakened from my sleep to listen to his half - instructed talk and savage vapourings . Indeed , he presumes too much . And now enough of him and his dark plots . Ye have your desires , all of you , and are paid in full . "
126773	126780	126781	126781	I	0	" Over - paid , perhaps , "
126787	126858	126781	126781	I	0	" Ah , Allan , I think that Lesson thou hast learned pleases thee but little . Well , be comforted for the thing is common . Hast never heard that there is but one morsel more bitter to the taste than desire denied , namely , desire fulfilled ? Believe me that there can be no happiness for man until he attains a land where all desire is dead . "
126859	126869	126576	126576	she	84	" That is what the Buddha preaches , Ayesha . "
126870	127020	126781	126781	I	0	" Aye , I remember the doctrines of that wise man well , who without doubt had found a key to the gate of Truth , one key only , for , mark thou , Allan , there are many . Yet , man being man must know desires , since without them , robbed of ambitions , strivings , hopes , fears , aye and of life itself , the race must die , which is not the will of the Lord of Life who needs a nursery for his servant 's souls , wherein his swords of Good and Ill shall shape them to his pattern . So it comes about , Allan , that what we think the worst is oft the best for us , and with that knowledge , if we are wise , let us assuage our bitterness and wipe away our tears . "
127021	127028	127029	127029	I	0	" I have often thought that , "
127032	127204	126781	126781	I	0	" I doubt it not , Allan , since though it has pleased me to make a jest of thee , I know that thou hast thy share of wisdom , such little share as thou canst gather in thy few short years . I know , too , that thy heart is good and aspires high , and Friend - well , I find in thee a friend indeed , as I think not for the first time , nor certainly for the last . Mark , Allan , what I say , not a lover , but a friend , which is higher far . For when passion dies with the passing of the flesh , if there be no friendship what will remain save certain memories that , mayhap , are well forgot ? Aye , how would those lovers meet elsewhere who were never more than lovers ? With weariness , I hold , as they stared into each other 's empty soul , or even with disgust .
127205	127281	126781	126781	I	0	" Therefore the wise will seek to turn those with whom Fate mates them into friends , since otherwise soon they will be lost for aye . More , if they are wiser still , having made them friends , they will suffer them to find lovers where they will . Good maxims , are they not ? Yet hard to follow , or so , perchance , thou thinkest them - as I do . "
127433	127548	127424	127424	she	533	" My friend , we part to meet no more in thy life 's day . Often thou wilt wonder concerning me , as to what in truth I am , and mayhap in the end thy judgment will be to write me down some false and beauteous wanderer who , rejected of the world or driven from it by her crimes , made choice to rule among savages , playing the part of Oracle to that little audience and telling strange tales to such few travellers as come her way . Perhaps , indeed , I do play this part among many others , and if so , thou wilt not judge me wrongly .
127549	127624	127424	127424	she	533	" Allan , in the old days , mariners who had sailed the northern seas , told me that therein amidst mist and storm float mountains of ice , shed from dizzy cliffs which are hid in darkness where no sun shines . They told me also that whereas above the ocean 's breast appears but a blue and dazzling point , sunk beneath it is oft a whole frozen isle , invisible to man .
127625	127718	127424	127424	she	533	" Such am I , Allan . Of my being thou seest but one little peak glittering in light or crowned with storm , as heaven 's moods sweep over it . But in the depths beneath are hid its white and broad foundations , hollowed by the seas of time to caverns and to palaces which my spirit doth inhabit . So picture me , therefore , as wise and fair , but with a soul unknown , and pray that in time to come thou mayest see it in its splendour .
127719	127805	127424	127424	she	533	" Hadst thou been other than thou art , I might have shown thee secrets , making clear to thee the parable of much that I have told thee in metaphor and varying fable , aye , and given thee great gifts of power and enduring days of which thou knowest nothing . But of those who visit shrines , O Allan , two things are required , worship and faith , since without these the oracles are dumb and the healing waters will not flow .
127806	127877	127424	127424	she	533	" Now I , Ayesha , am a shrine ; yet to me thou broughtest no worship until I won it by a woman 's trick , and in me thou hast no faith . Therefore for thee the oracle will not speak and the waters of deliverance will not flow . Yet I blame thee not , who art as thou wast made and the hard world has shaped thee .
127878	128006	127424	127424	she	533	" And so we part : Think not I am far from thee because thou seest me not in the days to come , since like that Isis whose majesty alone I still exercise on earth , I , whom men name Ayesha , am in all things . I tell thee that I am not One but Many and , being many , am both Here and Everywhere . When thou standest beneath the sky at night and lookest on the stars , remember that in them mine eyes behold thee ; when the soft winds of evening blow , that my breath is on thy brow and when the thunder rolls , that there am I riding on the lightnings and rushing with the gale . "
128007	128018	128019	128019	I	0	" Do you mean that you are the goddess Isis ? "
128024	128040	128019	128019	I	0	" Because if so why did you tell me that you were but her priestess ? "
128041	128183	128286	128286	She	2873	" Have it as thou wilt , Allan . All sounds do not reach thine ears ; all sights are not open to thy eyes and therefore thou art both half deaf and blind . Perchance now that her shrines are dust and her worship is forgot , some spark of the spirit of that immortal Lady whose chariot was the moon , lingers on the earth in this woman 's shape of mine , though her essence dwells afar , and perchance her other name is Nature , my mother and thine , O Allan . At the least hath not the World a soul - and of that soul am I not mayhap a part , aye , and thou also ? For the rest are not the priest and the Divine he bows to , oft the same ? "
128211	128285	128286	128286	She	2873	" Farewell , Allan , and let Ayesha 's benison go with thee . Safe shalt thou reach thy home , for all is prepared to take thee hence , and thy companions with thee . Safe shalt thou live for many a year , till thy time comes , and then , perchance , thou wilt find those whom thou hast lost more kind than they seemed to be to - night . "
128293	128459	128286	128286	She	2873	" Hearken unto my last word ! As I have said , much that I have told thee may bear a double meaning , as is the way of parables , to be interpreted as thou wilt . Yet one thing is true . I love a certain man , in the old days named Kallikrates , to whom alone I am appointed by a divine decree , and I await him here . Oh , shouldest thou find him in the world without , tell him that Ayesha awaits him and grows weary in the waiting . Nay , thou wilt never find him , since even if he be born again , by what token would he be known to thee ? Therefore I charge thee , keep my secrets well , lest Ayesha 's curse should fall on thee . While thou livest tell naught of me to the world thou knowest . Dost thou swear to keep my secrets , Allan ? "
128460	128466	128505	128505	she	2874	" I swear , Ayesha . "
128467	128474	128475	128475	she	2874	" I thank thee , Allan , "
128757	128762	128763	128763	he	87	" Oh , Baas , "
128772	128802	128763	128763	he	87	" I am glad to see you again , and standing on your feet , not being carried with them sticking straight in front of you as I expected . "
128803	128806	128807	128807	I	0	" Why ? "
128810	128849	128763	128763	he	87	" Oh , Baas , because of the things that happened in that place where the tall vrouw with her head tied up as though she had tooth - ache , sits like a spider in a web . "
128850	128858	128859	128859	I	0	" Well , what happened , Hans ? "
128866	129038	128763	128763	he	87	" This , Baas . The Doctoress talked and talked at you and Umslopogaas , and as she talked , your faces began to look as though you had drunk half a flask too much of the best gin , such as I wish I had some of here to - night , at once wise and foolish , and full and empty , Baas . Then you both rolled over and lay there quite dead , and whilst I was wondering what I should do and how I should get out your bodies to bury them , the Doctoress came down off her platform and bent , first over you and next over Umslopogaas , whispering into the ears of both of you . Then she took off a snake that looked as though it were made of gold with green eyes , which she wears about her middle beneath the long dish - cloth , Baas , and held it to your lips and next to those of Umslopogaas . "
129039	129048	128763	128763	he	87	" Well , and what then , Hans ? "
129049	129274	128763	128763	he	87	" After that all sorts of things came about , Baas , and I felt as though the whole house were travelling through the air , Baas , twice as fast as a bullet does from a rifle . Suddenly , too , the room became filled with fire so hot that it scorched me , and so bright that it made my eyes water , although they can look at the sun without winking . And , Baas , the fire was full of spooks which walked around ; yes , I saw some of them standing on your head and stomach , Baas , also on that of Umslopogaas , whilst others went and talked to the white Doctoress as quietly as though they had met her in the market - place and wanted to sell her eggs or butter . Then , Baas , suddenly I saw your reverend father , the Predikant , who looked as though he were red - hot , as doubtless he is in the Place of Fires . I thought he came up to me , Baas , and said , ' Get out of this , Hans . This is no place for a good Hottentot like you , Hans , for here only the very best Christians can bear the heat for long . '
129275	129435	129559	129559	Umslopogaas	125	" That finished me , Baas . I just answered that I handed you , the Baas Allan his son , over to his care , hoping that he would see that you did not burn in that oven , whatever happened to Umslopogaas . Then I shut my eyes and mouth and held my nose , and wriggled beneath those curtains as a snake does , Baas , and ran down the hall and across the kraal - yard and through the archway out into the night , where I have been sitting cooling myself ever since , waiting for you to be carried away , Baas . And now you have come alive and with not even your hair burnt off , which shows how wonderful must be the Great Medicine of Zikali , Baas , since nothing else could have saved you in that fire , no , not even your reverend father , the Predikant . "
129436	129439	129440	129440	I	0	" Hans , "
129447	129501	129440	129440	I	0	" you are a very wonderful fellow , for you can get drunk on nothing at all . Please remember , Hans , that you have been drunk to - night , yes , very drunk indeed , and never dare to repeat anything that you thought you saw while you were drunk . "
129502	129547	129443	129443	he	2883	" Yes , Baas , I understand that I was drunk and already have forgotten everything . But , Baas , there is still a bottle full of brandy and if I could have just one more tot I should forget so much better ! "
129570	129579	129580	129580	I	0	" Good - evening to you , Umslopogaas , "
129591	129625	129443	129443	he	2883	" Good - evening , Watcher - by - Night , who I thought was lost in the night , since in the end the night is stronger than any of its watchers . "
129660	129680	129929	129929	his	2887	" Did you make a journey this evening , Macumazahn , and if so , what did you see ? "
129681	129692	129693	129693	I	0	" Did you have a dream this evening , Umslopogaas ? "
129700	129741	129693	129693	I	0	" and if so , what was it about ? I thought that I saw you shut your eyes in the House of the White One yonder , doubtless because you were weary of talk which you did not understand . "
129742	129925	129927	129927	he	2887	" Aye , Macumazahn , as you suppose I grew weary of that talk which flowed from the lips of the White Witch like the music that comes from a little stream babbling over stones when the sun is hot , and being weary , I fell asleep and dreamed . What I dreamed does not much matter . It is enough to say that I felt as though I were thrown through the air like a stone cast from his sling by a boy who is set upon a stage to scare the birds out of a mealie garden . Further than any stone I went , aye , further than a shooting star , till I reached a wonderful place . It does not much matter what it was like either , and indeed I am already beginning to forget , but there I met everyone I have ever known . I met the Lion of the Zulus , the Black One , the Earth - Shaker , he who had a ' sister ' named Baleka , which sister , "
129937	130059	129927	129927	he	2887	" bore a child , which child was fostered by one Mopo , that Mopo who afterwards slew the Black one with the Princes . Now , Macumazahn , I had a score to settle with this Black One , aye , even though our blood be much of the same colour , I had a score to settle with him , because of the slaying of this sister of his , Baleka , together with the Langeni tribe . So I walked up to him and took him by the head - ring and spat in his face and bade him find a spear and shield , and meet me as man to man . Yes , I did this . "
130078	130083	130085	130085	Editor	2889	" Nada the Lily . "
130087	130095	130096	130096	I	0	" And what happened then , Umslopogaas ? "
130106	130175	130100	130100	he	2889	" Macumazahn , nothing happened at all . My hand seemed to go through his head - ring and the skull beneath , and to shut upon itself while he went on talking to someone else , a captain whom I recognised , yes , one Faku , whom in the days of Dingaan , the Black One 's brother , I myself slew upon the Ghost - Mountain .
130176	130246	130100	130100	he	2889	" Yes , Macumazahn , and Faku was telling him the tale of how I killed him and of the fight that I and my blood - brother and the wolves made , there on the knees of the old witch who sits aloft on the Ghost Mountain waiting for the world to die , for I could understand their talk , though mine went by them like the wind .
130247	130352	130100	130100	he	2889	" Macumazahn , they passed away and there came others , Dingaan among them , aye , Dingaan who also knows something of the Witch - Mountain , seeing that there Mopo and I hurled him to his death . With him also I would have had words , but it was the same story , only presently he caught sight of the Black One , yes , of Chaka whom he slew , stabbing him with the little red assegai , and turned and fled , because in that land I think he still fears Chaka , Macumazahn , or so the dream told .
130353	130510	130607	130611	The " blood - brother	5310	" I went on and met others , men I had fought in my day , most of them , among them was Jikiza , he who ruled the People of the Axe before me whom I slew with his own axe . I lifted the axe and made me ready to fight again , but not one of them took any note of me . There they walked about , or sat drinking beer or taking snuff , but never a sup of the beer or a pinch of the snuff did they offer me , no , not even those among them whom I chanced not to have killed . So I left them and walked on , seeking for Mopo , my foster - father , and a certain man , my blood - brother , by whose side I hunted with the wolves , yes , for them , and for another . "
130511	130520	130521	130521	I	0	" Well , and did you find them ? "
130524	130569	130571	130571	he	2890	" Mopo I found not , which makes me think , Macumazahn , that , as once you hinted to me , he whom I thought long dead , perchance still lingers on the earth . But the others I did find . . . "
130608	130613	130607	130611	The " blood - brother	5310	" blood - brother , "
130725	130730	130707	130744	Dingaan the king under the command of that Faku whom Umslopogaas had mentioned , in which fight the " Blood - Brother , " wielder of a famous club known as Watcher - of - the - Fords	2898	" Blood - Brother , "
130838	130851	130852	130852	I	0	" Well , and what did they say to you , Umslopogaas ? "
130855	131014	130852	130852	I	0	" Macumazahn , they said nothing at all . Hearken ! There stood this pair , or sometimes they moved to and fro ; my brother , an even greater man than he used to be , with the wolfskin girt about him and the club , Watcher - of - the - Fords , which he alone could wield , upon his shoulder , and Nada , grown lovelier even than she was of old , so lovely , Macumazahn , that my heart rose into my throat when I saw her and stopped my breath . Yes , Macumazahn , there they stood , or walked about arm in arm as lovers might , and looked into each other 's eyes and talked of how they had known each other on the earth , for I could understand their words or thoughts , and how it was good to be at rest together where they were . "
131015	131026	131027	131027	I	0	" You see , they were old friends , Umslopogaas , "
131030	131176	130852	130852	I	0	" Yes , Macumazahn , very old friends as I thought . So much so that they had never had a word to say of me who also was the old friend of both of them . Aye , my brother , whose name I am sworn not to speak , the woman - hater who vowed he loved nothing save me and the wolves , could smile into the face of Nada the Lily , Nada the bride of my youth , yet never a word of me , while she could smile back and tell him how great a warrior he had been and never a word of me whose deeds she was wo nt to praise , who saved her in the Halakazi caves and from Dingaan ; no , never a word of me although I stood there staring at them . "
131177	131189	130852	130852	I	0	" I suppose that they did not see you , Umslopogaas . "
131190	131279	130852	130852	I	0	" That is so , Macumazahn ; I am sure that they did not see me , for if they had they would not have been so much at ease . But I saw them and as they would not take heed when I shouted , I ran up calling to my brother to defend himself with his club . Then , as he still took no note , I lifted the axe Inkosikaas , making it circle in the light , and smote with all my strength . "
131280	131287	130852	130852	I	0	" And what happened , Umslopogaas ? "
131288	131389	130852	130852	I	0	" Only this , Macumazahn , that the axe went straight through my brother from the crown of his head to the groin , cutting him in two , and he just went on talking ! Indeed , he did more , for stooping down he gathered a white lily - bloom which grew there and gave it to Nada , who smelt at it , smiled and thanked him , and then thrust it into her girdle , still thanking him all the while . Yes , she did this for I saw it with my eyes , Macumazahn . "
131433	131436	131437	131437	he	183	" Macumazahn , "
131442	131554	131437	131437	he	183	" it seems that madness took hold of me for a long while , for I shouted and raved at them , thinking that words and rage might hurt where good steel could not , and as I did so they faded away and disappeared , still smiling and talking , Nada smelling at the lily which , having a long stalk , rose up above her breast . After this I rushed away and suddenly met that savage king , Rezu , whom I slew a few days gone . At him I went with the axe , wondering whether he would put up a better fight this second time . "
131555	131562	131437	131437	he	183	" And did he , Umslopogaas ? "
131563	131724	131437	131437	he	183	" Nay , but I think he felt me for he turned and fled and when I tried to follow I could not see him . So I ran on and presently who should I find but Baleka , Baleka , Chaka 's ' sister ' who - repeat it not , Macumazahn - was my mother ; and , Macumazahn , she saw me . Yes , though I was but little when last she looked on me who now am great and grim , she saw and knew me , for she floated up to me and smiled at me and seemed to press her lips upon my forehead , though I could feel no kiss , and to draw the soreness out of my heart . Then she , too , was gone and of a sudden I fell down through space , having , I suppose , stepped into some deep hole , or perchance a well .
131725	131781	131437	131437	he	183	" The next thing I knew was that I awoke in the house of the White Witch and saw you sleeping at my side and the Witch leaning back upon her bed and smiling at me through the thin blanket with which she covers herself up , for I could see the laughter in her eyes .
131782	131923	131437	131437	he	183	" Now I grew mad with her because of the things that I had seen in the Place of Dreams , and it came into my heart that it would be well to kill her that the world might be rid of her and her evil magic which can show lies to men . So , being distraught , I sprang up and lifted the axe and stepped towards her , whereon she rose and stood before me , laughing out loud . Then she said something in the tongue I can not understand , and pointed with her finger , and lo ! next moment it was as if giants had seized me and were whirling me away , till presently I found myself breathless but unharmed beyond the arch and - what does it all mean , Macumazahn ? "
131924	132084	131437	131437	he	183	" Very little , as I think , Umslopogaas , except that this queen has powers to which those of Zikali are as nothing , and can cause visions to float before the eyes of men . For know that such things as you saw , I saw , and in them those whom I have loved also seemed to take no thought of me but only to be concerned with each other . Moreover when I awoke and told this to the queen who is called She - who - commands , she laughed at me as she did at you , and said that it was a good lesson for my pride who in that pride had believed that the dead only thought of the living . But I think that the lesson came from her who wished to humble us , Umslopogaas , and that it was her mind that shaped these visions which we saw . "
132085	132130	131437	131437	he	183	" I think so too , Macumazahn , but how she knew of all the matters of your life and mine , I do not know , unless perchance Zikali told them to her , speaking in the night - watches as wizards can . "
132131	132219	131437	131437	he	183	" Nay , Umslopogaas , I believe that by her magic she drew our stories out of our own hearts and then set them forth to us afresh , putting her own colour on them . Also it may be that she drew something from Hans , and from Goroko and the other Zulus with you , and thus paid us the fee that she had promised for our service , but in lung - sick oxen and barren cows , not in good cattle , Umslopogaas . "
132225	132311	132220	132220	He	2903	" Though at the time I seemed to go mad and though I know that women are false and men must follow where they lead them , never will I believe that my brother , the woman - hater , and Nada are lovers in the land below and have there forgotten me , the comrade of one of them and the husband of the other . Moreover I hold , Macumazahn , that you and I have met with a just reward for our folly .
132312	132393	131437	131437	he	183	" We have sought to look through the bottom of the grave at things which the Great - Great in Heaven above did not mean that men should see , and now that we have seen we are unhappier than we were , since such dreams burn themselves upon the heart as a red - hot iron burns the hide of an ox , so that the hair will never grow again where it has been and the hide is marred .
132394	132486	132220	132220	He	2903	" To you , Watcher - by - Night , I say , ' Content yourself with your watching and whatever it may bring to you in fame and wealth . ' And to myself I say , ' Holder of the Axe , content yourself with the axe and what it may bring to you in fair fight and glory ' ; and to both of us I say , ' Let the Dead sleep unawakened until we go to join them , which surely will be soon enough . ' "
132487	132508	131437	131437	he	183	" Good words , Umslopogaas , but they should have been spoken ere ever we set out on this journey . "
132509	132650	132220	132220	He	2903	" Not so , Macumazahn , since that journey we were fated to make to save one who lies yonder , the Lady Sad - Eyes , and , as they tell me , is well again . Also Zikali willed it , and who can resist the will of the Opener - of - Roads ? So it is made and we have seen many strange things and won some glory and come to know how deep is the pool of our own foolishness , who thought that we could search out the secrets of Death , and there have only found those of a witch 's mind and venom , reflected as in water . And now having discovered all these things I wish to be gone from this haunted land . When do we march , Macumazahn ? "
132651	132684	131437	131437	he	183	" To - morrow morning , I believe , if the Lady Sad - Eyes and the others are well enough , as She - who - commands says they will be . "
132685	132711	132220	132220	He	2903	" Good . Then I would sleep who am more weary than I was after I had killed Rezu in the battle on the mountain . "
132712	132715	132716	132716	I	0	" Yes , "
132750	132750	132748	132748	Umslopogaas	125	"
132874	132887	132867	132867	she	159	" which was probably a hymn , and prayed upon her knees , "
132893	132900	132864	132864	they	2907	" and then gone quietly to bed .

And yet , and yet it was well to have seen it and to have plucked the flower of such marvellous experience , nor , as I knew even then , could I ever inter the memory of Ayesha the wise , the perfect in all loveliness , and the half - divine in power .
133748	133766	133732	133732	She	159	" Daddy has gone on a long journey and will not be back for weeks and weeks . "
133776	133823	133773	133773	I	0	" Yes , Inez , but I am a friend of his and he has sent me to take you to a place where I hope that we shall find him . Only it is far away , so you also must make a long journey . "
133831	133945	133824	133824	She	159	" Oh , that will be nice , I do so love travelling , especially to find Daddy , who I expect will have my proper clothes with him , not these which , although they are very comfortable and pretty , seem different to what I used to wear . You look very nice too and I am sure that we shall be great friends , which I am glad of , for I have been rather lonely since my mother went to live with the saints in Heaven , because , you see , Daddy is so busy and so often away , that I do not see much of him .

135599	135621	135585	135585	I	0	" Speak not empty words , Umslopogaas , for where else can she be when we see her with our eyes ? "
135622	135665	135522	135522	I	0	" Who am I that I should know the ways of witches who , like the winds , are able to go and come as they will ? Can a woman run up a wall of rock like a lizard , Macumazahn ? "
135666	135670	135672	135672	I	0	" Doubtless - - "

I went , wondering , to find her in the sitting - room , dressed in European clothes which she had taken from where she kept them , and once more a reasoning woman .
136573	136577	136578	136578	she	159	" Mr. Quatermain , "
136581	136628	136578	136578	she	159	" I suppose that I must have been ill , for the last thing I remember is going to sleep on the night after you started for the hippopotamus hunt . Where is my father ? Did any harm come to him while he was hunting ? "
136629	136632	136633	136633	I	0	" Alas ! "
136652	136683	136640	136640	I	0	" it did . He was trampled upon by a hippopotamus bull , which charged him , and killed , and we were obliged to bury him where he died . "
136707	136740	136686	136686	her	159	" I do not think you are telling me everything , Mr. Quatermain , but something seems to say that this is because it is not well that I should learn everything . "
136741	136744	136745	136745	I	0	" No , "
136748	136823	136745	136745	I	0	" you have been ill and out of your mind for quite a long while ; something gave you a shock . I think that you learned of your father 's death , which you have now forgotten , and were overcome with the news . Please trust to me and believe that if I keep anything back from you , it is because I think it best to do so for the present . "
136824	136831	136832	136832	she	3015	" I trust and I believe , "
136835	136853	136832	136832	she	3015	" Now please leave me , but tell me first where are those women and their children ? "
136854	136863	136864	136864	I	0	" After your father died they went away , "
137797	137800	137801	137801	she	159	" No , "
137806	137823	137801	137801	she	159	" my life there has been a hell and I never wish to see it again . "

138180	138251	138177	138177	he	125	" now I come to the end of an unlucky journey , though mayhap it is not so evil as it seems , since I who went out to seek the dead but to be filled by yonder White Witch with the meat of mocking shadows , am about to find the dead in the only way in which they can be found , namely by becoming of their number . "
138252	138267	138142	138142	they	494	" It seems that this is the case with all of us , Umslopogaas . "
138268	138406	138177	138177	he	125	" Not so , Macumazahn . That child of the King will give you safe - conduct . It is I and mine whose blood he seeks , as he has the right to do , since it is true that I would have raised rebellion against the King , I who wearied of my petty lot and knew that by blood his place was mine . In this quarrel you have no share , though you , whose heart is as white as your skin , are not minded to desert me . Moreover , even if you wished to fight , there is one in the waggon yonder whose life is not yours to give . The Lady Sad - Eyes is as a child in your arms and her you must bear to safety . "
138446	138454	138455	138455	he	3073	" Make a glorious end , Macumazahn , "
138461	138539	138455	138455	he	3073	" I will go out with those who cling to me , that is with all who remain of my men , since my fate must be theirs , and stand back to back on yonder mound and there wait till these dogs of the King come up against us . Watch a while , Macumazahn , and see how Umslopogaas , Bearer of the Axe , and the warriors of the Axe can fight and die . "
138638	138643	138644	138644	I	0	" What is it ? "
138676	138742	138662	138662	himself	3075	" Nothing , Baas , or rather , only this , Baas : Those hyenas of Zulus are even more afraid of the Great Medicine than were the cannibals up north , since the maker of it is nearer to them , Baas . You remember , Baas , they knelt to it , as it were , when we were going out of Zululand . "
138743	138758	138759	138759	I	0	" Well , what of it , now that we are going into Zululand ? "
138763	138774	138759	138759	I	0	" Do you want me to show it to them ? "
138775	138898	138901	138901	he	3076	" No , Baas . What is the use , seeing that they are ready to let you pass , also the Lady Sad - Eyes , and me and the cattle with the driver and voorlooper , which is better still , and all the other goods . So what have you to gain by showing them the medicine ? But perchance if it were on the neck of Umslopogaas and he showed it to them and brought it to their minds that those who touch him who is in the shadow of Zikali 's Great Medicine , or aught that is his , die within three moons in this way or in that - well , Baas , who knows ? "
138926	138958	138914	138914	Hans	87	" This little yellow man is well named Light - in - Darkness ; at least the plan can be tried - if it fails there is always time to die . "
139111	139123	139124	139124	he	765	" The Great Medicine of the Opener - of - Roads ! "
139127	139157	139124	139124	he	765	" Oh , now I understand why this Chief of the People of the Axe is unconquerable - such a wizard that no one is able to kill him . "
139158	139161	139162	139162	I	0	" Yes , "
139165	139207	139162	139162	I	0	" and you remember , do you not , that he who offends the Great Medicine , or offers violence to him who wears it , dies horribly within three moons , he and his household and all those with him ? "
139208	139214	139215	139215	he	765	" I have heard it , "
139222	139236	139237	139237	I	0	" And now you are about to learn whether the tale is true , "
139490	139498	139499	139499	he	765	" Be sure of this , Macumazahn , "
139502	139552	139499	139499	he	765	" that if I do not escape , neither will that captain , since I walk at his side and keep my axe , and at the first sign of treachery the axe will enter the house of that thick head of his and make friends with the brain inside .
139553	139556	139557	139557	he	765	" Macumazahn , "
139560	139662	139663	139663	he	765	" we have made a strange journey together and seen such things as I did not think the world had to show . Also I have fought and killed Rezu in a mad battle of ghosts and men which alone was worth all the trouble of the journey . Now it has come to an end as everything must , and we part , but as I believe , not for always . I do not think that I shall die on this journey with the captain , though I do think that others will die at the end of it , "
139678	139903	140001	140001	he	3098	" It comes into my heart , Macumazahn , that in yonder land of witches and wizards , the spirit of prophecy got caught in my moocha and crept into my bowels . Now that spirit tells me that we shall meet again in the after - years and stand together in a great fray which will be our last , as I believe that the White Witch said . Or perhaps the spirit lives in Zikali 's Medicine which has gone down my throat and comes out of it in words . I can not say , but I pray that it is a true spirit , since although you are white and I am black and you are small and I am big , and you are gentle and cunning , whereas I am fierce and as open as the blade of my own axe , yet I love you as well , Macumazahn , as though we were born of the same mother and had been brought up in the same kraal . Now that captain waits and grows doubtful of our talk , so farewell . I will return the Great Medicine to Zikali , if I live , and if I die he must send one of the ghosts that serve him , to fetch it from among my bones .
139904	139913	139914	139914	he	3098	" Farewell to you also , Yellow Man , "
139936	139999	139918	139918	Hans	87	" well are you named Light - in - Darkness , and glad am I to have met you , who have learned from you how a snake moves and strikes , and how a jackal thinks and avoids the snare . Yes , farewell , for the spirit within me does not tell me that you and I shall meet again . "
140016	140029	140001	140001	he	3098	" Chief and Father , Great Chief and Father , from of old "
140122	140139	140141	140141	Hans	87	" I am glad we have seen the last of him and his axe , Baas , "
140146	140302	140141	140141	Hans	87	" It is very well to sleep in the same hut with a tame lion sometimes , but after you have done so for many moons , you begin to wonder when you will wake up at night to find him pulling the blankets off you and combing your hair with his claws . Yes , I am very glad that this half - tame lion is gone , since sometimes I have thought that I should be obliged to poison it that we might sleep in peace . You know he called me a snake , Baas , and poison is a snake 's only spear . Shall I tell the boys to inspan the oxen , Baas ? I think the further we get from that King 's captain and his men , the more comfortably shall we travel , especially now when we no longer have the Great Medicine to protect us . "
140303	140313	140314	140314	I	0	" You suggested giving it to him , Hans , "
140317	140443	140141	140141	Hans	87	" Yes , Baas , I had rather that Umslopogaas went away with the Great Medicine , than that you kept the Great Medicine and he stopped with us here . Never travel with a traitor , Baas , at any rate in the land of the king whom he wishes to kill . Kings are very selfish people , Baas , and do not like being killed , especially by someone who wants to sit upon their stool and to take the royal salute . No one gives the royal salute to a dead king , Baas , however great he was before he died , and no one thinks the worse of a king who was a traitor before he became a king . "
140465	140475	140476	140476	he	104	" So you have got back safely , Macumazahn , "
140479	140547	140476	140476	he	104	" Well , I told you you would , did I not ? As for what happened to you upon the journey , let it be , for now that I am old long stories tire me and I daresay that there is nothing wonderful about this one . Where is the charm I lent you ? Give it back now that it has served its turn . "
140548	140576	140602	140602	he	104	" I have not got it , Zikali . I passed it on to Umslopogaas of the Axe to save his life from the King 's men . "
140577	140594	140602	140602	he	104	" Oh ! yes , so you did . I had forgotten . Here it is , "
140617	140644	140602	140602	he	104	" Would you like a copy of it , Macumazahn , to keep as a memory ? If so , I will carve one for you . "
140645	140648	140649	140649	I	0	" No , "
140652	140662	140649	140649	I	0	" I should not . Has Umslopogaas been here ? "
140663	140692	140602	140602	he	104	" Yes , he has been and gone again , which is one of the reasons why I do not wish to hear your tale a second time . "
140693	140706	140649	140649	I	0	" Where to ? The Town of the People of the Axe ? "
140707	140729	140602	140602	he	104	" No , Macumazahn , he came thence , or so I understood , but thither he will return no more . "
140730	140736	140649	140649	I	0	" Why not , Zikali ? "
140737	140886	140602	140602	he	104	" Because after his fashion he made trouble there and left some dead behind him ; one Lousta , I believe , whom he had appointed to sit on his stool as chief while he was away , and a woman called Monazi , who was his wife , or Lousta 's wife , or the wife of both of them , I forget which . It is said that having heard stories of her - and the ears of jealousy are long , Macumazahn - he cut off this woman 's head with a sweep of the axe and made Lousta fight him till he fell , which the fool did almost before he had lifted his shield . It served him right who should have made sure that Umslopogaas was dead before he wrapped himself in his blanket and took the woman to cook his porridge . "
140887	140896	140897	140897	I	0	" Where has the Axe - bearer gone ? "
140910	141136	140602	140602	he	104	" I neither know nor care , Macumazahn . To become a wanderer , I suppose . He will tell you the tale when you meet again in the after - days , as I understand he thinks that you will do . Hearken ! I have done with this lion 's whelp , who is Chaka over again , but without Chaka 's wit . Yes , he is just a fighting man with a long reach , a sure eye and the trick of handling an axe , and such are of little use to me who know too many of them . Thrice have I tried to make him till my garden , but each time he has broken the hoe , although the wage I promised him was a royal kaross and nothing less . So enough of Umslopogaas , the Woodpecker . Almost I wish that you had not lent him the charm , for then the King 's men would have made an end of him , who knows too much and like some silly boaster , may shout out the truth when his axe is aloft and he is full of the beer of battle . For in battle he will live and in battle he will die , Macumazahn , as perhaps you may see one day . "

141180	141218	141175	141175	I	0	" Not at all , Macumazahn , because I have none . The only friends of the old are those whom they can turn to their own ends , and if these fail them they find others . "
141219	141234	141235	141235	He	3105	" I understand , Zikali , and know now what to expect from you . "
141244	141354	141235	141235	He	3105	" Aye , and it is good that you must expect , good in the future as in the past , for you , Macumazahn , who are brave in your own fashion , without being a fool like Umslopogaas , and , although you know it not , like some master - smith , forge my assegais out of the red ore I give you , tempering them in the blood of men , and yet keep your mind innocent and your hands clean . Friends like you are useful to such as I , Macumazahn , and must be well paid in those wares that please them . "
141409	141419	141405	141405	he	359	" What message had the White Queen for me ? "
141420	141436	141405	141405	he	359	" She said that you troubled her too much at night in dreams , Zikali . "
141437	141639	141405	141405	he	359	" Aye , but if I cease to do so , ever she desires to know the reason why , for I hear her asking me in the voices of the wind , or in the twittering of bats . After all , she is a woman , Macumazahn , and it must be dull sitting alone from year to year with naught to stay her appetite save the ashes of the past and dreams of the future , so dull that I wonder , having once meshed you in her web , how she found the heart to let you go before she had sucked out your life and spirit . I suppose that having made a mock of you and drained you dry , she was content to throw you aside like an empty gourd . Perchance , had she kept you at her side , you would have been a stone in her path in days to come . Perchance , Macumazahn , she waits for other travellers and would welcome them , or one of them alone , saying nothing of a certain Watcher - by - Night who has served her turn and vanished into the night .
141640	141668	141672	141672	him	3107	" But what other message had the White Queen for the poor old savage witch - doctor whose talk wearies her so much in her haunted sleep ? "
141719	141724	141725	141725	he	3107	" Oho - ho ! "

141863	141911	141796	141796	your	0	" I daresay , Macumazahn , I daresay , but they were very pretty lies , were they not ? And after all I am sure that there was wisdom in them , as you will discover when you have thought them over for a score of years .
141912	142004	141820	141820	I	0	" Lies , lies , all is lies ! But beyond the lie stands Truth , as the White Witch stands behind her veil . You drew the veil , Macumazahn , and saw that beneath which brought you to your knees . Why , it is a parable . Wander on through the Valley of Lies till at last it takes a turn , and , glittering in the sunshine , glittering like gold , you perceive the Mountain of everlasting Truth , sought of all men but found by few .
142005	142096	141796	141796	your	0	" Lies , lies , all is lies ! Yet beyond I tell you , beauteous and eternal stands the Truth , Macumazahn . Oho - ho ! Oho - ho ! Fare you well , Watcher - by - Night , fare you well , Seeker after Truth . After the Night comes Dawn and after Death comes what - Macumazahn ? Well , you will learn one day , for always the veil is lifted , at last , as the White Witch shewed you yonder , Macumazahn . "
