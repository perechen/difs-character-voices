5390	5427	5346	5346	Erle	364	" All right , old fellow ; we shall be sure to carry you through . The Irish writs will be out on the third of March , and the sooner you 're there the better . "
5651	5657	5659	5660	the Earl	733	" The devil he is ! "
5670	5685	5659	5660	the Earl	733	" Then I 'll tell you what , Finn , I 'll support him . "
5686	5694	5659	5660	the Earl	733	" You support him , Lord Tulla ! "
5695	5744	5659	5660	the Earl	733	" Yes ; - why should n't I support him ? I suppose it 's not so bad with me in the country that my support will rob him of his chance ! I 'll tell you one thing for certain , I wo n't support George Morris . "
5745	5751	5659	5660	the Earl	733	" But , my lord - "
5752	5758	5659	5660	the Earl	733	" Well ; go on . "
5759	5784	5659	5660	the Earl	733	" I 've never taken much part in politics myself , as you know ; but my boy Phineas is on the other side . "
5785	5866	5920	5921	the Earl	733	" I do n't care a - - for sides . What has my party done for me ? Look at my cousin , Dick Morris . There 's not a clergyman in Ireland stauncher to them than he has been , and now they 've given the deanery of Kilfenora to a man that never had a father , though I condescended to ask for it for my cousin . Let them wait till I ask for anything again . "
5912	5918	5920	5921	the Earl	733	" And as for George , "
5923	5964	5920	5921	the Earl	733	" I will never lift my hand again for him . His standing for Loughshane would be quite out of the question . My own tenants would n't vote for him if I were to ask them myself . Peter Blake "
5975	6076	5966	5968	Mr. Peter Blake	375	" told me only a week ago that it would be useless . The whole thing is gone , and for my part I wish they 'd disenfranchise the borough . I wish they 'd disenfranchise the whole country , and send us a military governor . What 's the use of such members as we send ? There is n't one gentleman among ten of them . Your son is welcome for me . What support I can give him he shall have , but it is n't much . I suppose he had better come and see me . "
6264	6275	6277	6277	Matilda	359	" Papa has been over there and managed it all , "
6279	6291	6293	6294	Barrington Erle	364	" I 'm told George Morris is n't going to stand , "
6303	6318	6320	6320	Phineas	329	" His brother wo n't support him . His brother means to support me , "
6322	6329	6320	6320	Phineas	329	" That can hardly be so . "
6330	6353	6383	6383	his	364	" But I tell you it is . My father has known the Earl these twenty years , and has managed it . "
6354	6373	6375	6376	Mr. Erle	364	" I say , Finn , you 're not going to play us a trick , are you ? "
6386	6392	6375	6376	Mr. Erle	364	" What sort of trick ? "
6393	6404	6383	6383	his	364	" You 're not coming out on the other side ? "
6405	6412	6414	6414	Phineas	329	" Not if I know it , "
6418	6497	6414	6414	Phineas	329	" Let me assure you I would n't change my views in politics either for you or for the Earl , though each of you carried seats in your breeches pockets . If I go into Parliament , I shall go there as a sound Liberal , - not to support a party , but to do the best I can for the country . I tell you so , and I shall tell the Earl the same . "

7318	7348	7349	7349	Phineas	329	" We wo n't discuss politics , if you please , Mr. Finn ; because , as I have already said , I am throwing aside all political considerations . "
7841	7853	7836	7837	the doctor	741	" It wo n't make a bit of change in him , "
7877	7883	7885	7885	Mary	382	" Oh , it must , "
7887	7906	7885	7885	Mary	382	" I tell you it wo n't , my dear ; he is so good and so true . "
7907	7946	7836	7837	the doctor	741	" I know he is good , Barbara ; and as for truth , there is no question about it , because he has never said a word to me that he might not say to any girl . "
7947	7954	7885	7885	Mary	382	" That 's nonsense , Mary . "
7955	7981	7885	7885	Mary	382	" He never has , then , as sure as the blessed Virgin watches over us ; - only you do n't believe she does . "
7982	7992	7836	7837	the doctor	741	" Never mind about the Virgin now , Mary . "
7993	8008	7885	7885	Mary	382	" But he never has . Your brother is nothing to me , Barbara . "
8009	8034	7885	7885	Mary	382	" Then I hope he will be before the evening is over . He was walking with you all yesterday and the day before . "
8035	8070	7836	7837	the doctor	741	" Why should n't he , - and we that have known each other all our lives ? But , Barbara , pray , pray never say a word of this to any one ! "
8071	8085	7885	7885	Mary	382	" Is it I ? Would n't I cut out my tongue first ? "
8086	8118	7885	7885	Mary	382	" I do n't know why I let you talk to me in this way . There has never been anything between me and Phineas , - your brother I mean . "
8119	8128	7836	7837	the doctor	741	" I know whom you mean very well . "
8129	8178	7885	7885	Mary	382	" And I feel quite sure that there never will be . Why should there ? He 'll go out among great people and be a great man ; and I 've already found out that there 's a certain Lady Laura Standish whom he admires very much . "
8179	8184	7885	7885	Mary	382	" Lady Laura Fiddlestick ! "
8185	8200	8202	8205	Miss Mary Flood Jones	382	" A man in Parliament , you know , may look up to anybody , "
8207	8220	8202	8205	Miss Mary Flood Jones	382	" I want Phin to look up to you , my dear . "
8221	8267	7885	7885	Mary	382	" That would n't be looking up . Placed as he is now , that would be looking down ; and he is so proud that he 'll never do that . But come down , dear , else they 'll wonder where we are . "
8757	8771	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" I shall be off to - morrow morning by the early train , "
8775	8795	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" So soon ; - and when will you have to begin , - in Parliament , I mean ? "
8796	8815	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" I shall have to take my seat on Friday . I 'm going back just in time . "
8816	8827	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" But when shall we hear of your saying something ? "
8828	8846	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" Never , probably . Not one in ten who go into Parliament ever do say anything . "
8847	8887	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" But you will ; wo n't you ? I hope you will . I do so hope you will distinguish yourself ; - because of your sister , and for the sake of the town , you know . "
8888	8896	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" And is that all , Mary ? "
8897	8903	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" Is n't that enough ? "
8904	8916	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" You do n't care a bit about myself , then ? "
8917	8965	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" You know that I do . Have n't we been friends ever since we were children ? Of course it will be a great pride to me that a person whom I have known so intimately should come to be talked about as a great man . "
8966	8978	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" I shall never be talked about as a great man . "
8979	9009	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" You 're a great man to me already , being in Parliament . Only think ; - I never saw a member of Parliament in my life before . "
9010	9020	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" You 've seen the bishop scores of times . "
9021	9093	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" Is he in Parliament ? Ah , but not like you . He could n't come to be a Cabinet Minister , and one never reads anything about him in the newspapers . I shall expect to see your name , very often , and I shall always look for it . ' Mr. Phineas Finn paired off with Mr. Mildmay . ' What is the meaning of pairing off ? "
9094	9112	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" I 'll explain it all to you when I come back , after learning my lesson . "
9113	9147	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" Mind you do come back . But I do n't suppose you ever will . You will be going somewhere to see Lady Laura Standish when you are not wanted in Parliament . "
9148	9153	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" Lady Laura Standish ! "
9154	9187	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" And why should n't you ? Of course , with your prospects , you should go as much as possible among people of that sort . Is Lady Laura very pretty ? "
9188	9196	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" She 's about six feet high . "
9197	9206	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" Nonsense . I do n't believe that . "
9207	9220	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" She would look as though she were , standing by you . "
9221	9230	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" Because I am so insignificant and small . "
9231	9278	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" Because your figure is perfect , and because she is straggling . She is as unlike you as possible in everything . She has thick lumpy red hair , while yours is all silk and softness . She has large hands and feet , and - "
9279	9303	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" Why , Phineas , you are making her out to be an ogress , and yet I know that you admire her . "
9304	9376	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" So I do , because she possesses such an appearance of power . And after all , in spite of the lumpy hair , and in spite of large hands and straggling figure , she is handsome . One ca n't tell what it is . One can see that she is quite contented with herself , and intends to make others contented with her . And so she does . "
9377	9389	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" I see you are in love with her , Phineas . "
9390	9435	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" No ; not in love , - not with her at least . Of all men in the world , I suppose that I am the last that has a right to be in love . I daresay I shall marry some day . "
9436	9445	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" I 'm sure I hope you will . "
9446	9482	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" But not till I 'm forty or perhaps fifty years old . If I was not fool enough to have what men call a high ambition I might venture to be in love now . "
9483	9550	8773	8773	Phineas	329	" I 'm sure I 'm very glad that you 've got a high ambition . It is what every man ought to have ; and I 've no doubt that we shall hear of your marriage soon , - very soon . And then , - if she can help you in your ambition , we - shall - all - be so - glad . "
9645	9648	9650	9650	he	329	" Mary , "
9674	9681	9650	9650	he	329	" one kiss before we part . "
9682	9689	9650	9650	he	329	" No , Phineas , no ! "
9705	9714	9650	9650	he	329	" Oh , Phineas , you should n't ! "
9715	9737	9650	9650	he	329	" I should . Why should n't I ? And , Mary , I will have one morsel of your hair . "
9738	9748	9650	9650	he	329	" You shall not ; indeed you shall not ! "
9808	9820	9822	9822	Barbara	361	" You do love her ; do n't you , Phineas ? "
9824	9859	9822	9822	Barbara	361	" Bother ! Do you go to bed , and do n't trouble yourself about such trifles . But mind you 're up , old girl , to see me off in the morning . "
10756	10764	10766	10766	Laurence	390	" Well , Finn , my boy , "
10790	11046	10781	10781	you	1170	" Then Phineas was beginning to tell all the story , the wonderful story , of George Morris and the Earl of Tulla , - how the men of Loughshane had elected him without opposition ; how he had been supported by Conservatives as well as Liberals ; - how unanimous Loughshane had been in electing him , Phineas Finn , as its representative . But Mr. Fitzgibbon seemed to care very little about all this , and went so far as to declare that those things were accidents which fell out sometimes one way and sometimes another , and were altogether independent of any merit or demerit on the part of the candidate himself . And it was marvellous and almost painful to Phineas that his friend Fitzgibbon should accept the fact of his membership with so little of congratulation , - with absolutely no blowing of trumpets whatever . Had he been elected a member of the municipal corporation of Loughshane , instead of its representative in the British Parliament , Laurence Fitzgibbon could not have made less fuss about it . Phineas was disappointed , but he took the cue from his friend too quickly to show his disappointment . And when , half an hour after their meeting , Fitzgibbon had to be reminded that his companion was not in the House during the last session , Phineas was able to make the remark as though he thought as little about the House as did the old - accustomed member himself . "
11056	11060	10781	10781	you	1170	" said Fitzgibbon , "
11068	11069	10781	10781	you	1170	" "
11072	11086	11087	11090	A majority of seventeen	1173	" said Phineas , not quite understanding the meaning of the number quoted . "
11165	11166	11169	11169	my	0	" "
11184	11185	11169	11169	my	0	" "
11235	11274	11224	11224	Dubby	392	" Dubby was the ordinary name by which , among friends and foes , Mr. Daubeny was known : Mr. Daubeny , who at that time was the leader of the Conservative party in the House of Commons . "
11280	11285	11224	11224	Dubby	392	" continued Mr. Fitzgibbon , "
11312	11313	11293	11293	you	1178	" "
11325	11326	11293	11293	you	1178	" "
11410	11411	11394	11394	you	1178	" "
11422	11423	11394	11394	you	1178	" "
11508	11509	11511	11512	the people	731	" "
11514	11515	11511	11512	the people	731	" "
11557	11789	11790	11790	I	0	" Mr. Fitzgibbon 's doctrine as to the commonwealth was very different from that of Barrington Erle , and was still less to the taste of the new member . Barrington Erle considered that his leader , Mr. Mildmay , should be intrusted to make all necessary changes in the laws , and that an obedient House of Commons should implicitly obey that leader in authorising all changes proposed by him ; - but according to Barrington Erle , such changes should be numerous and of great importance , and would , if duly passed into law at his lord 's behest , gradually produce such a Whig Utopia in England as has never yet been seen on the face of the earth . Now , according to Mr. Fitzgibbon , the present Utopia would be good enough , - if only he himself might be once more put into possession of a certain semi - political place about the Court , from which he had heretofore drawn L1,000 per annum , without any work , much to his comfort . He made no secret of his ambition , and was chagrined simply at the prospect of having to return to his electors before he could enjoy those good things which he expected to receive from the undoubted majority of seventeen , which had been , or would be , achieved . "
11798	11802	11790	11790	I	0	" said Fitzgibbon ; "
11942	11943	11927	11927	he	395	" "
11950	11951	11927	11927	he	395	" "
12008	12062	12066	12066	you	1203	" As they parted at Euston Square , Phineas asked his friend some little nervous question as to the best mode of making a first entrance into the House . Would Laurence Fitzgibbon see him through the difficulties of the oath - taking ? But Laurence Fitzgibbon made very little of the difficulty . "
12118	12254	12256	12256	you	1206	" Phineas reached London early in the morning , and went home to bed for an hour or so . The House was to meet on that very day , and he intended to begin his parliamentary duties at once if he should find it possible to get some one to accompany him ; He felt that he should lack courage to go down to Westminster Hall alone , and explain to the policeman and door - keepers that he was the man who had just been elected member for Loughshane . So about noon he went into the Reform Club , and there he found a great crowd of men , among whom there was a plentiful sprinkling of members . Erle saw him in a moment , and came to him with congratulations . "
12263	12267	12261	12261	Finn	329	" said he . "
12289	12290	12285	12285	I	0	" "
12304	12308	12291	12291	I	0	" said Erle . "
12337	12346	12347	12347	I	0	" Phineas did n't at all like this . "
12358	12362	12351	12352	any one	7313	" said he , "
12368	12369	12365	12366	Lord Tulla	373	" "
12423	12495	12419	12419	you	1206	" Then Barrington Erle went off to other business , and Finn was congratulated by other men . But it seemed to him that the congratulations of his friends were not hearty . He spoke to some men , of whom he thought that he knew they would have given their eyes to be in Parliament ; - and yet they spoke of his success as being a very ordinary thing . "
12507	12526	12501	12501	I	0	" said one middle - aged gentleman whom he had known ever since he came up to London . "
12548	12549	12539	12539	You	7278	" "
12558	12562	12539	12539	You	7278	" said Phineas . "
12572	12580	12563	12563	They	1215	" said the middle - aged friend , "
12597	13053	12595	12595	myself	0	" At two punctually Phineas was in the lobby at Westminster , and then he found himself taken into the House with a crowd of other men . The old and young , and they who were neither old nor young , were mingled together , and there seemed to be very little respect of persons . On three or four occasions there was some cheering when a popular man or a great leader came in ; but the work of the day left but little clear impression on the mind of the young member . He was confused , half elated , half disappointed , and had not his wits about him . He found himself constantly regretting that he was there ; and as constantly telling himself that he , hardly yet twenty - five , without a shilling of his own , had achieved an entrance into that assembly which by the consent of all men is the greatest in the world , and which many of the rich magnates of the country had in vain spent heaps of treasure in their endeavours to open to their own footsteps . He tried hard to realise what he had gained , but the dust and the noise and the crowds and the want of something august to the eye were almost too strong for him . He managed , however , to take the oath early among those who took it , and heard the Queen s speech read and the Address moved and seconded . He was seated very uncomfortably , high up on a back seat , between two men whom he did not know ; and he found the speeches to be very long . He had been in the habit of seeing such speeches reported in about a column , and he thought that these speeches must take at least four columns each . He sat out the debate on the Address till the House was adjourned , and then he went away to dine at his club . He did go into the dining - room of the House , but there was a crowd there , and he found himself alone , - and to tell the truth , he was afraid to order his dinner . The nearest approach to a triumph which he had in London came to him from the glory which his election reflected upon his landlady . She was a kindly good motherly soul , whose husband was a journeyman law - stationer , and who kept a very decent house in Great Marlborough Street . Here Phineas had lodged since he had been in London , and was a great favourite . "
13062	13066	13088	13089	Mrs. Bunce	333	" said she , "
13077	13078	13083	13086	a member of Parliament	7334	" "
13091	13092	13088	13089	Mrs. Bunce	333	" "
13120	13604	13108	13108	I	0	" Mrs. Bunce really had realised the magnitude of the step which her lodger had taken , and Phineas was grateful to her . CHAPTER IV Lady Laura Standish Phineas , in describing Lady Laura Standish to Mary Flood Jones at Killaloe , had not painted her in very glowing colours . Nevertheless he admired Lady Laura very much , and she was worthy of admiration . It was probably the greatest pride of our hero 's life that Lady Laura Standish was his friend , and that she had instigated him to undertake the risk of parliamentary life . Lady Laura was intimate also with Barrington Erle , who was , in some distant degree , her cousin ; and Phineas was not without a suspicion that his selection for Loughshane , from out of all the young liberal candidates , may have been in some degree owing to Lady Laura 's influence with Barrington Erle . He was not unwilling that it should be so ; for though , as he had repeatedly told himself , he was by no means in love with Lady Laura , - who was , as he imagined , somewhat older than himself , - nevertheless , he would feel gratified at accepting anything from her hands , and he felt a keen desire for some increase to those ties of friendship which bound them together . No ; - he was not in love with Lady Laura Standish . He had not the remotest idea of asking her to be his wife . So he told himself , both before he went over for his election , and after his return . When he had found himself in a corner with poor little Mary Flood Jones , he had kissed her as a matter of course ; but he did not think that he could , in any circumstances , be tempted to kiss Lady Laura . He supposed that he was in love with his darling little Mary , - after a fashion . Of course , it could never come to anything , because of the circumstances of his life , which were so imperious to him . He was not in love with Lady Laura , and yet he hoped that his intimacy with her might come to much . He had more than once asked himself how he would feel when somebody else came to be really in love with Lady Laura , - for she was by no means a woman to lack lovers , - when some one else should be in love with her , and be received by her as a lover ; but this question he had never been able to answer . There were many questions about himself which he usually answered by telling himself that it was his fate to walk over volcanoes . "
13618	13623	13108	13108	I	0	" he would say ; "
13639	14941	14950	14950	I	0	" The House had met on a Friday , again on the Saturday morning , and the debate on the Address had been adjourned till the Monday . On the Sunday , Phineas determined that he would see Lady Laura . She professed to be always at home on Sunday , and from three to four in the afternoon her drawing - room would probably be half full of people . There would , at any rate , be comers and goers , who would prevent anything like real conversation between himself and her . But for a few minutes before that he might probably find her alone , and he was most anxious to see whether her reception of him , as a member of Parliament , would be in any degree warmer than that of his other friends . Hitherto he had found no such warmth since he came to London , excepting that which had glowed in the bosom of Mrs. Bunce . Lady Laura Standish was the daughter of the Earl of Brentford , and was the only remaining lady of the Earl 's family . The Countess had been long dead ; and Lady Emily , the younger daughter , who had been the great beauty of her day , was now the wife of a Russian nobleman whom she had persisted in preferring to any of her English suitors , and lived at St. Petersburg . There was an aunt , old Lady Laura , who came up to town about the middle of May ; but she was always in the country except for some six weeks in the season . There was a certain Lord Chiltern , the Earl 's son and heir , who did indeed live at the family town house in Portman Square ; but Lord Chiltern was a man of whom Lady Laura 's set did not often speak , and Phineas , frequently as he had been at the house , had never seen Lord Chiltern there . He was a young nobleman of whom various accounts were given by various people ; but I fear that the account most readily accepted in London attributed to him a great intimacy with the affairs at Newmarket , and a partiality for convivial pleasures . Respecting Lord Chiltern Phineas had never as yet exchanged a word with Lady Laura . With her father he was acquainted , as he had dined perhaps half a dozen times at the house . The point in Lord Brentford 's character which had more than any other struck our hero , was the unlimited confidence which he seemed to place in his daughter . Lady Laura seemed to have perfect power of doing what she pleased . She was much more mistress of herself than if she had been the wife instead of the daughter of the Earl of Brentford , - and she seemed to be quite as much mistress of the house . Phineas had declared at Killaloe that Lady Laura was six feet high , that she had red hair , that her figure was straggling , and that her hands and feet were large . She was in fact about five feet seven in height , and she carried her height well . There was something of nobility in her gait , and she seemed thus to be taller than her inches . Her hair was in truth red , - of a deep thorough redness . Her brother 's hair was the same ; and so had been that of her father , before it had become sandy with age . Her sister 's had been of a soft auburn hue , and hers had been said to be the prettiest head of hair in Europe at the time of her marriage . But in these days we have got to like red hair , and Lady Laura 's was not supposed to stand in the way of her being considered a beauty . Her face was very fair , though it lacked that softness which we all love in women . Her eyes , which were large and bright , and very clear , never seemed to quail , never rose and sunk or showed themselves to be afraid of their own power . Indeed , Lady Laura Standish had nothing of fear about her . Her nose was perfectly cut , but was rather large , having the slightest possible tendency to be aquiline . Her mouth also was large , but was full of expression , and her teeth were perfect . Her complexion was very bright , but in spite of its brightness she never blushed . The shades of her complexion were set and steady . Those who knew her said that her heart was so fully under command that nothing could stir her blood to any sudden motion . As to that accusation of straggling which had been made against her , it had sprung from ill - natured observation of her modes of sitting . She never straggled when she stood or walked ; but she would lean forward when sitting , as a man does , and would use her arms in talking , and would put her hand over her face , and pass her fingers through her hair , - after the fashion of men rather than of women ; - and she seemed to despise that soft quiescence of her sex in which are generally found so many charms . Her hands and feet were large , - as was her whole frame . Such was Lady Laura Standish ; and Phineas Finn had been untrue to himself and to his own appreciation of the lady when he had described her in disparaging terms to Mary Flood Jones . But , though he had spoken of Lady Laura in disparaging terms , he had so spoken of her as to make Miss Flood Jones quite understand that he thought a great deal about Lady Laura . And now , early on the Sunday , he made his way to Portman Square in order that he might learn whether there might be any sympathy for him there . Hitherto he had found none . Everything had been terribly dry and hard , and he had gathered as yet none of the fruit which he had expected that his good fortune would bear for him . It is true that he had not as yet gone among any friends , except those of his club , and men who were in the House along with him ; - and at the club it might be that there were some who envied him his good fortune , and others who thought nothing of it because it had been theirs for years . Now he would try a friend who , he hoped , could sympathise ; and therefore he called in Portman Square at about half - past two on the Sunday morning . Yes , - Lady Laura was in the drawing - room . The hall - porter admitted as much , but evidently seemed to think that he had been disturbed from his dinner before his time . Phineas did not care a straw for the hall - porter . If Lady Laura were not kind to him , he would never trouble that hall - porter again . He was especially sore at this moment because a valued friend , the barrister with whom he had been reading for the last three years , had spent the best part of an hour that Sunday morning in proving to him that he had as good as ruined himself . "
14958	14963	14950	14950	I	0	" said Mr. Low . "
14969	14974	14950	14950	I	0	" Phineas replied ; - "
14984	15006	15007	15007	I	0	" Then Mr. Low had opened his eyes very wide , and shaken his head very sadly , and had whistled . "
15018	15033	15007	15007	I	0	" said Lady Laura , meeting Phineas half - way across the large room . "
15036	15046	15047	15047	I	0	" said he , as he took her hand . "

15440	15459	15460	15461	Mr. Kennedy	343	" said Phineas , feeling , however , that he did not expect much sympathy from Lord Brentford . "
15508	15509	15492	15493	Barrington Erle	364	" "
15518	15526	15492	15493	Barrington Erle	364	" said Phineas , after a pause . "
15535	15536	15492	15493	Barrington Erle	364	" "
15629	15630	15639	15640	Mr. Finn	329	" "
15647	15648	15642	15642	I	0	" "
15655	15768	15642	15642	I	0	" At that moment the door of the room was opened , and a man entered with quick steps , came a few yards in , and then retreated , slamming the door after him . He was a man with thick short red hair , and an abundance of very red beard . And his face was red , - and , as it seemed to Phineas , his very eyes . There was something in the countenance of the man which struck him almost with dread , - something approaching to ferocity . There was a pause a moment after the door was closed , and then Lady Laura spoke . "
15786	15915	15775	15775	I	0	" CHAPTER V Mr. and Mrs. Low That terrible apparition of the red Lord Chiltern had disturbed Phineas in the moment of his happiness as he sat listening to the kind flatteries of Lady Laura ; and though Lord Chiltern had vanished as quickly as he had appeared , there had come no return of his joy . Lady Laura had said some word about her brother , and Phineas had replied that he had never chanced to see Lord Chiltern . Then there had been an awkward silence , and almost immediately other persons had come in . After greeting one or two old acquaintances , among whom an elder sister of Laurence Fitzgibbon was one , he took his leave and escaped out into the square . "
15927	15932	15933	15933	She	401	" said Lady Laura . "
15952	15953	15944	15944	she	401	" "
15968	15978	15964	15964	they	1256	" said Miss Fitzgibbon , holding up her hands . "
16008	16289	15993	16006	some man who was n't , that I might think of changing my condition	1258	" But Phineas cared very little what Miss Fitzgibbon said to him . Everybody knew Aspasia Fitzgibbon , and all who knew her were accustomed to put up with the violence of her jokes and the bitterness of her remarks . She was an old maid , over forty , very plain , who , having reconciled herself to the fact that she was an old maid , chose to take advantage of such poor privileges as the position gave her . Within the last few years a considerable fortune had fallen into her hands , some twenty - five thousand pounds , which had come to her unexpectedly , - a wonderful windfall . And now she was the only one of her family who had money at command . She lived in a small house by herself , in one of the smallest streets of May Fair , and walked about sturdily by herself , and spoke her mind about everything . She was greatly devoted to her brother Laurence , - so devoted that there was nothing she would not do for him , short of lending him money . But Phineas when he found himself out in the square thought nothing of Aspasia Fitzgibbon . He had gone to Lady Laura Standish for sympathy , and she had given it to him in full measure . She understood him and his aspirations if no one else did so on the face of the earth . She rejoiced in his triumph , and was not too hard to tell him that she looked forward to his success . And in what delightful language she had done so ! "
16297	16757	15993	16006	some man who was n't , that I might think of changing my condition	1258	" It was thus , or almost thus , that she had encouraged him . He knew well that she had in truth meant nothing more than her words had seemed to signify . He did not for a moment attribute to her aught else . But might not he get another lesson from them ? He had often told himself that he was not in love with Laura Standish ; - but why should he not how tell himself that he was in love with her ? Of course there would be difficulty . But was it not the business of his life to overcome difficulties ? Had he not already overcome one difficulty almost as great ; and why should he be afraid of this other ? Faint heart never won fair lady ! And this fair lady , - for at this moment he was ready to swear that she was very fair , - was already half won . She could not have taken him by the hand so warmly , and looked into his face so keenly , had she not felt for him something stronger than common friendship . He had turned down Baker Street from the square , and was now walking towards the Regent 's Park . He would go and see the beasts in the Zoological Gardens , and make up his mind as to his future mode of life in that delightful Sunday solitude . There was very much as to which it was necessary that he should make up his mind . If he resolved that he would ask Lady Laura Standish to be his wife , when should he ask her , and in what manner might he propose to her that they should live ? It would hardly suit him to postpone his courtship indefinitely , knowing , as he did know , that he would be one among many suitors . He could not expect her to wait for him if he did not declare himself . And yet he could hardly ask her to come and share with him the allowance made to him by his father ! Whether she had much fortune of her own , or little , or none at all , he did not in the least know . He did know that the Earl had been distressed by his son 's extravagance , and that there had been some money difficulties arising from this source . But his great desire would be to support his own wife by his own labour . At present he was hardly in a fair way to do that , unless he could get paid for his parliamentary work . Those fortunate gentlemen who form "
16760	17392	15993	16006	some man who was n't , that I might think of changing my condition	1258	" are so paid . Yes ; - there was the Treasury Bench open to him , and he must resolve that he would seat himself there . He would make Lady Laura understand this , and then he would ask his question . It was true that at present his political opponents had possession of the Treasury Bench ; - but all governments are mortal , and Conservative governments in this country are especially prone to die . It was true that he could not hold even a Treasury lordship with a poor thousand a year for his salary without having to face the electors of Loughshane again before he entered upon the enjoyment of his place ; - but if he could only do something to give a grace to his name , to show that he was a rising man , the electors of Loughshane , who had once been so easy with him , would surely not be cruel to him when he showed himself a second time among them . Lord Tulla was his friend , and he had those points of law in his favour which possession bestows . And then he remembered that Lady Laura was related to almost everybody who was anybody among the high Whigs . She was , he knew , second cousin to Mr. Mildmay , who for years had been the leader of the Whigs , and was third cousin to Barrington Erle . The late President of the Council , the Duke of St. Bungay , and Lord Brentford had married sisters , and the St. Bungay people , and the Mildmay people , and the Brentford people had all some sort of connection with the Palliser people , of whom the heir and coming chief , Plantagenet Palliser , would certainly be Chancellor of the Exchequer in the next Government . Simply as an introduction into official life nothing could be more conducive to chances of success than a matrimonial alliance with Lady Laura . Not that he would have thought of such a thing on that account ! No ; - he thought of it because he loved her ; honestly because he loved her . He swore to that half a dozen times , for his own satisfaction . But , loving her as he did , and resolving that in spite of all difficulties she should become his wife , there could be no reason why he should not , - on her account as well as on his own , - take advantage of any circumstances that there might be in his favour . As he wandered among the unsavoury beasts , elbowed on every side by the Sunday visitors to the garden , he made up his mind that he would first let Lady Laura understand what were his intentions with regard to his future career , and then he would ask her to join her lot to his . At every turn the chances would of course be very much against him ; - ten to one against him , perhaps , on every point ; but it was his lot in life to have to face such odds . Twelve months since it had been much more than ten to one against his getting into Parliament ; and yet he was there . He expected to be blown into fragments , - to sheep - skinning in Australia , or packing preserved meats on the plains of Paraguay ; but when the blowing into atoms should come , he was resolved that courage to bear the ruin should not be wanting . Then he quoted a line or two of a Latin poet , and felt himself to be comfortable . "
17403	17411	17400	17401	Mr. Finn	329	" said a voice in his ear . "
17422	17423	17418	17418	I	0	" "
17460	17461	17443	17443	you	1260	" "
17481	17482	17471	17472	Miss Fitzgibbon	401	" "
17511	17534	17535	17535	I	0	" But it so happened that Phineas did not know Mr. Kennedy , and consequently there was some slight form of introduction . "
17547	17553	17537	17537	I	0	" - said Phineas , - "
17559	17560	17555	17556	Lord Brentford	332	" "
17565	17570	17562	17562	me	0	" said Miss Fitzgibbon . "
17582	17689	17562	17562	me	0	" said Phineas . Mr. Kennedy , who seemed to be afflicted with some difficulty in speaking , and whose bow to our hero had hardly done more than produce the slightest possible motion to the top of his hat , hereupon muttered something which was taken to mean an assent to the proposition as to Wednesday 's dinner . Then he stood perfectly still , with his two hands fixed on the top of his umbrella , and gazed at the great monkeys ' cage . But it was clear that he was not looking at any special monkey , for his eyes never wandered . "
17701	17714	17691	17691	you	1260	" said Miss Fitzgibbon to Phineas , - hardly in a whisper . "
17718	17722	17691	17691	you	1260	" said Phineas . "
17761	18072	17751	17752	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Mr. Kennedy was a man who had very little temptation to do anything wrong . He was possessed of over a million and a half of money , which he was mistaken enough to suppose he had made himself ; whereas it may be doubted whether he had ever earned a penny . His father and his uncle had created a business in Glasgow , and that business now belonged to him . But his father and his uncle , who had toiled through their long lives , had left behind them servants who understood the work , and the business now went on prospering almost by its own momentum . The Mr. Kennedy of the present day , the sole owner of the business , though he did occasionally go to Glasgow , certainly did nothing towards maintaining it . He had a magnificent place in Perthshire , called Loughlinter , and he sat for a Scotch group of boroughs , and he had a house in London , and a stud of horses in Leicestershire , which he rarely visited , and was unmarried . He never spoke much to any one , although he was constantly in society . He rarely did anything , although he had the means of doing everything . He had very seldom been on his legs in the House of Commons , though he had sat there for ten years . He was seen about everywhere , sometimes with one acquaintance and sometimes with another ; - but it may be doubted whether he had any friend . It may be doubted whether he had ever talked enough to any man to make that man his friend . Laurence Fitzgibbon tried him for one season , and after a month or two asked for a loan of a few hundred pounds . "
18084	18134	18073	18073	I	0	" said Mr. Kennedy , and it was the longest speech which had ever fallen from his mouth in the hearing of Laurence Fitzgibbon . But though he would not lend money , he gave a great deal , - and he would give it for almost every object . "
18145	18264	18265	18265	I	0	" appeared on almost every charitable list that was advertised . No one ever spoke to him as to this expenditure , nor did he ever speak to any one . Circulars came to him and the cheques were returned . The duty was a very easy one to him , and he performed it willingly . Had any amount of inquiry been necessary , it is possible that the labour would have been too much for him . Such was Mr. Robert Kennedy , as to whom Phineas had heard that he had during the last winter entertained Lord Brentford and Lady Laura , with very many other people of note , at his place in Perthshire . "
18272	18279	18282	18282	you	0	" said Phineas to Miss Fitzgibbon . "
18285	18289	18282	18282	you	0	" said she . "
18318	18358	18314	18314	they	1268	" Phineas , knowing that he could gain nothing by sparring with Miss Fitzgibbon , raised his hat and took his leave . Going out of a narrow gate he found himself again brought into contact with Mr. Kennedy . "
18366	18571	18360	18362	a crowd there	1269	" he said , finding himself bound to say something . Mr. Kennedy , who was behind him , answered him not a word . Then Phineas made up his mind that Mr. Kennedy was insolent with the insolence of riches , and that he would hate Mr. Kennedy . He was engaged to dine on this Sunday with Mr. Low , the barrister , with whom he had been reading for the last three years . Mr. Low had taken a strong liking to Phineas , as had also Mrs. Low , and the tutor had more than once told his pupil that success in his profession was certainly open to him if he would only stick to his work . Mr. Low was himself an ambitious man , looking forward to entering Parliament at some future time , when the exigencies of his life of labour might enable him to do so ; but he was prudent , given to close calculation , and resolved to make the ground sure beneath his feet in every step that he took forward . When he first heard that Finn intended to stand for Loughshane he was stricken with dismay , and strongly dissuaded him . "
18586	18691	18581	18581	his	1271	" Mr. Low had said to his wife , when he found that Phineas was , as he thought , foolhardy . But the electors of Loughshane had not rejected Mr. Low 's pupil , and Mr. Low was now called upon to advise what Phineas should do in his present circumstances . There is nothing to prevent the work of a Chancery barrister being done by a member of Parliament . Indeed , the most successful barristers are members of Parliament . But Phineas Finn was beginning at the wrong end , and Mr. Low knew that no good would come of it . "
18703	18708	18700	18701	Mr. Finn	329	" said Mrs. Low . "
18717	18721	18700	18701	Mr. Finn	329	" said Phineas . "
18730	18735	18700	18701	Mr. Finn	329	" said Mrs. Low . "
18754	18755	18750	18750	he	910	" "
18781	18782	18778	18779	Mrs. Low	331	" "
18819	19052	18805	18805	I	0	" Mrs. Low was a very matter - of - fact lady , four or five years older than her husband , who had had a little money of her own , and was possessed of every virtue under the sun . Nevertheless she did not quite like the idea of her husband 's pupil having got into Parliament . If her husband and Phineas Finn were dining anywhere together , Phineas , who had come to them quite a boy , would walk out of the room before her husband . This could hardly be right ! Nevertheless she helped Phineas to the nicest bit of fish she could find , and had he been ill , would have nursed him with the greatest care . After dinner , when Mrs. Low had gone up - stairs , there came the great discussion between the tutor and the pupil , for the sake of which this little dinner had been given . When Phineas had last been with Mr. Low , - on the occasion of his showing himself at his tutor 's chambers after his return from Ireland , - he had not made up his mind so thoroughly on certain points as he had done since he had seen Lady Laura . The discussion could hardly be of any avail now , - but it could not be avoided . "
19065	19155	19060	19060	you	329	" said Mr. Low . Everybody who knew our hero , or nearly everybody , called him by his Christian name . There are men who seem to be so treated by general consent in all societies . Even Mrs. Low , who was very prosaic , and unlikely to be familiar in her mode of address , had fallen into the way of doing it before the election . But she had dropped it , when the Phineas whom she used to know became a member of Parliament . "
19166	19170	19060	19060	you	329	" said Phineas . "
19180	19181	19177	19177	your	329	" "

19216	19227	19200	19200	I	0	" said Mr. Low , raising his hands in surprise . "

19687	19742	19743	19743	You	1281	" Mr. Low , who was an energetic man , had assumed almost an angry tone of voice . Phineas for awhile sat silent ; - not that he felt himself to be without words for a reply , but that he was thinking in what fewest words he might best convey his ideas . "
19767	19772	19773	19773	He	1238	" continued Mr. Low . "
19778	19779	19773	19773	He	1238	" "
19997	20048	19983	19983	Your	1297	" Mr. Low had never said a soft word in his life to any woman but the wife of his bosom , had never seen a racehorse , always confined himself to two glasses of port after dinner , and looked upon smoking as the darkest of all the vices . "

Mr. Low heard him without a word . "

20667	21476	21477	21477	I	0	" Phineas did not go up - stairs into Mrs. Low 's drawing - room on that evening , nor did he stay very late with Mr. Low . He had heard enough of counsel to make him very unhappy , - to shake from him much of the audacity which he had acquired for himself during his morning 's walk , - and to make him almost doubt whether , after all , the Chiltern Hundreds would not be for him the safest escape from his difficulties . But in that case he must never venture to see Lady Laura Standish again . CHAPTER VI Lord Brentford 's Dinner No ; - in such case as that , - should he resolve upon taking the advice of his old friend Mr. Low , Phineas Finn must make up his mind never to see Lady Laura Standish again ! And he was in love with Lady Laura Standish ; - and , for aught he knew , Lady Laura Standish might be in love with him . As he walked home from Mr. Low 's house in Bedford Square , he was by no means a triumphant man . There had been much more said between him and Mr. Low than could be laid before the reader in the last chapter . Mr. Low had urged him again and again , and had prevailed so far that Phineas , before he left the house , had promised to consider that suicidal expedient of the Chiltern Hundreds . What a by - word he would become if he were to give up Parliament , having sat there for about a week ! But such immediate giving up was one of the necessities of Mr. Low 's programme . According to Mr. Low 's teaching , a single year passed amidst the miasma of the House of Commons would be altogether fatal to any chance of professional success . And Mr. Low had at any rate succeeded in making Phineas believe that he was right in this lesson . There was his profession , as to which Mr. Low assured him that success was within his reach ; and there was Parliament on the other side , as to which he knew that the chances were all against him , in spite of his advantage of a seat . That he could not combine the two , beginning with Parliament , he did believe . Which should it be ? That was the question which he tried to decide as he walked home from Bedford Square to Great Marlborough Street . He could not answer the question satisfactorily , and went to bed an unhappy man . He must at any rate go to Lord Brentford 's dinner on Wednesday , and , to enable him to join in the conversation there , must attend the debates on Monday and Tuesday . The reader may perhaps be best made to understand how terrible was our hero 's state of doubt by being told that for awhile he thought of absenting himself from these debates , as being likely to weaken his purpose of withdrawing altogether from the House . It is not very often that so strong a fury rages between party and party at the commencement of the session that a division is taken upon the Address . It is customary for the leader of the opposition on such occasions to express his opinion in the most courteous language , that his right honourable friend , sitting opposite to him on the Treasury bench , has been , is , and will be wrong in everything that he thinks , says , or does in public life ; but that , as anything like factious opposition is never adopted on that side of the House , the Address to the Queen , in answer to that most fatuous speech which has been put into her Majesty 's gracious mouth , shall be allowed to pass unquestioned . Then the leader of the House thanks his adversary for his consideration , explains to all men how happy the country ought to be that the Government has not fallen into the disgracefully incapable hands of his right honourable friend opposite ; and after that the Address is carried amidst universal serenity . But such was not the order of the day on the present occasion . Mr. Mildmay , the veteran leader of the liberal side of the House , had moved an amendment to the Address , and had urged upon the House , in very strong language , the expediency of showing , at the very commencement of the session , that the country had returned to Parliament a strong majority determined not to put up with Conservative inactivity . "
21485	21491	21482	21482	my	0	" Mr. Mildmay had said , "
21541	22219	22220	22220	We	1311	" And if Mr. Mildmay used strong language , the reader may be sure that Mr. Mildmay 's followers used language much stronger . And Mr. Daubeny , who was the present leader of the House , and representative there of the Ministry , - Lord de Terrier , the Premier , sitting in the House of Lords , - was not the man to allow these amenities to pass by without adequate replies . He and his friends were very strong in sarcasm , if they failed in argument , and lacked nothing for words , though it might perhaps be proved that they were short in numbers . It was considered that the speech in which Mr. Daubeny reviewed the long political life of Mr. Mildmay , and showed that Mr. Mildmay had been at one time a bugbear , and then a nightmare , and latterly simply a fungus , was one of the severest attacks , if not the most severe , that had been heard in that House since the Reform Bill . Mr. Mildmay , the while , was sitting with his hat low down over his eyes , and many men said that he did not like it . But this speech was not made till after that dinner at Lord Brentford 's , of which a short account must be given . Had it not been for the overwhelming interest of the doings in Parliament at the commencement of the session , Phineas might have perhaps abstained from attending , in spite of the charm of novelty . For , in truth , Mr. Low 's words had moved him much . But if it was to be his fate to be a member of Parliament only for ten days , surely it would be well that he should take advantage of the time to hear such a debate as this . It would be a thing to talk of to his children in twenty years ' time , or to his grandchildren in fifty ; - and it would be essentially necessary that he should be able to talk of it to Lady Laura Standish . He did , therefore , sit in the House till one on the Monday night , and till two on the Tuesday night , and heard the debate adjourned till the Thursday . On the Thursday Mr. Daubeny was to make his great speech , and then the division would come . When Phineas entered Lady Laura 's drawing - room on the Wednesday before dinner , he found the other guests all assembled . Why men should have been earlier in keeping their dinner engagements on that day than on any other he did not understand ; but it was the fact , probably , that the great anxiety of the time made those who were at all concerned in the matter very keen to hear and to be heard . During these days everybody was in a hurry , - everybody was eager ; and there was a common feeling that not a minute was to be lost . There were three ladies in the room , - Lady Laura , Miss Fitzgibbon , and Mrs. Bonteen . The latter was the wife of a gentleman who had been a junior Lord of the Admiralty in the late Government , and who lived in the expectation of filling , perhaps , some higher office in the Government which , as he hoped , was soon to be called into existence . There were five gentlemen besides Phineas Finn himself , - Mr. Bonteen , Mr. Kennedy , Mr. Fitzgibbon , Barrington Erle , who had been caught in spite of all that Lady Laura had said as to the difficulty of such an operation , and Lord Brentford . Phineas was quick to observe that every male guest was in Parliament , and to tell himself that he would not have been there unless he also had had a seat . "

22496	22523	22524	22524	I	0	" Then dinner was announced . The Earl walked off with Miss Fitzgibbon , Barrington Erle took Mrs. Bonteen , and Mr. Fitzgibbon took Lady Laura . "
22536	22569	22570	22570	I	0	" said Mr. Bonteen , as he passed through the drawing - room door . The remark seemed to have been addressed to Mr. Kennedy , and Phineas therefore made no reply . "

22625	22764	22619	22619	I	0	" said Phineas to himself as he followed Mr. Kennedy into the dining - room . He had observed that Mr. Kennedy had been standing very near to Lady Laura in the drawing - room , and that Lady Laura had said a few words to him . He was more determined than ever that he would hate Mr. Kennedy , and would probably have been moody and unhappy throughout the whole dinner had not Lady Laura called him to a chair at her left hand . It was very generous of her ; and the more so , as Mr. Kennedy had , in a half - hesitating manner , prepared to seat himself in that very place . As it was , Phineas and Mr. Kennedy were neighbours , but Phineas had the place of honour . "
22775	22780	22767	22767	you	1323	" said Lady Laura . "

23884	23927	23871	23871	Roby	415	" It may be as well to explain that Mr. Roby was a Conservative gentleman of great fame who had for years acted as Whip under Mr. Daubeny , and who now filled the high office of Patronage Secretary to the Treasury . "
23934	23939	23928	23928	I	0	" continued Mr. Bonteen , "
23955	23956	23945	23947	poor George Morris	370	" "

24057	24062	24055	24055	Barrington	364	" asked Lady Laura . "
24114	24131	24105	24105	Ratler	417	" Mr. Ratler was in those days the Whip on the liberal side of the House . "
24135	24140	24147	24147	he	416	" said Miss Fitzgibbon . "
24153	24158	24147	24147	he	416	" said Mr. Bonteen . "
24173	24178	24160	24160	you	1359	" said Lady Laura . "
24181	24186	24160	24160	you	1359	" said Barrington Erle . "
24226	24357	24212	24212	he	416	" The same kind of conversation went on during the whole of dinner , and became , if anything , more animated when the three ladies had left the room . Mr. Kennedy made but one remark , and then he observed that as far as he could see a majority of nineteen would be as serviceable as a majority of twenty . This he said in a very mild voice , and in a tone that was intended to be expressive of doubt ; but in spite of his humility Barrington Erle flew at him almost savagely , - as though a liberal member of the House of Commons was disgraced by so mean a spirit ; and Phineas found himself despising the man for his want of zeal . "
24371	24375	24366	24366	us	1362	" said Phineas . "
24384	24389	24366	24366	us	1362	" said Barrington Erle . "
24402	24406	24395	24400	every man with a seat polled	1364	" said Bonteen . "
24411	24416	24407	24409	Poor Sir Everard	418	" said Lord Brentford . "
24433	24434	24426	24426	I	0	" "
24444	24787	24426	24426	I	0	" said Barrington , in his eagerness omitting to catch Lord Brentford 's grim joke . Phineas went up into the drawing - room for a few minutes after dinner , and was eagerly desirous of saying a few more words , - he knew not what words , - to Lady Laura . Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Bonteen had left the dining - room first , and Phineas again found Mr. Kennedy standing close to Lady Laura 's shoulder . Could it be possible that there was anything in it ? Mr. Kennedy was an unmarried man , with an immense fortune , a magnificent place , a seat in Parliament , and was not perhaps above forty years of age . There could be no reason why he should not ask Lady Laura to be his wife , - except , indeed , that he did not seem to have sufficient words at command to ask anybody for anything . But could it be that such a woman as Lady Laura could accept such a man as Mr. Kennedy because of his wealth , and because of his fine place , - a man who had not a word to throw to a dog , who did not seem to be possessed of an idea , who hardly looked like a gentleman ; - so Phineas told himself . But in truth Mr. Kennedy , though he was a plain , unattractive man , with nothing in his personal appearance to call for remark , was not unlike a gentleman in his usual demeanour . Phineas himself , it may be here said , was six feet high , and very handsome , with bright blue eyes , and brown wavy hair , and light silken beard . Mrs. Low had told her husband more than once that he was much too handsome to do any good . Mr. Low , however , had replied that young Finn had never shown himself to be conscious of his own personal advantages . "
24795	24800	24788	24788	He	1365	" said Mrs. Low . "
24814	24991	24801	24802	Some woman	1293	" I do not think that Phineas depended much as yet on his own good looks , but he felt that Mr. Kennedy ought to be despised by such a one as Lady Laura Standish , because his looks were not good . And she must despise him ! It could not be that a woman so full of life should be willing to put up with a man who absolutely seemed to have no life within him . And yet why was he there , and why was he allowed to hang about just over her shoulders ? Phineas Finn began to feel himself to be an injured man . But Lady Laura had the power of dispelling instantly this sense of injury . She had done it effectually in the dining - room by calling him to the seat by her side , to the express exclusion of the millionaire , and she did it again now by walking away from Mr. Kennedy to the spot on which Phineas had placed himself somewhat sulkily . "
25007	25011	24994	24994	you	1367	" she said . "
25015	25016	24994	24994	you	1367	" "

25222	25278	25213	25213	he	343	" Phineas felt that Lady Laura was in a slight degree scolding him for the disrespectful manner in which he had spoken of Mr. Kennedy ; and he felt also that he had committed himself , - that he had shown himself to be sore , and that she had seen and understood his soreness . "
25288	25298	25282	25282	I	0	" said he , trying to correct his blunder . "
25329	25330	25331	25331	I	0	" "

25533	25777	25778	25778	Bedad	419	" Then Phineas went away , and walked down to Pall Mall with Laurence Fitzgibbon . He would have preferred to take his walk alone , but he could not get rid of his affectionate countryman . He wanted to think over what had taken place during the evening ; and , indeed , he did so in spite of his friend 's conversation . Lady Laura , when she first saw him after his return to London , had told him how anxious her father was to congratulate him on his seat , but the Earl had not spoken a word to him on the subject . The Earl had been courteous , as hosts customarily are , but had been in no way specially kind to him . And then Mr. Kennedy ! As to going to Loughlinter , he would not do such a thing , - not though the success of the liberal party were to depend on it . He declared to himself that there were some things which a man could not do . But although he was not altogether satisfied with what had occurred in Portman Square , he felt as he walked down arm - in - arm with Fitzgibbon that Mr. Low and Mr. Low 's counsels must be scattered to the winds . He had thrown the die in consenting to stand for Loughshane , and must stand the hazard of the cast . "
25797	25802	25789	25789	you	7278	" said Laurence Fitzgibbon . "
25812	25816	25803	25803	I	0	" said Phineas . "

25886	26359	26361	26361	he	1387	" CHAPTER VII Mr. and Mrs. Bunce It was three o'clock on the Thursday night before Mr. Daubeny 's speech was finished . I do not think that there was any truth in the allegation made at the time , that he continued on his legs an hour longer than the necessities of his speech required , in order that five or six very ancient Whigs might be wearied out and shrink to their beds . Let a Whig have been ever so ancient and ever so weary , he would not have been allowed to depart from Westminster Hall that night . Sir Everard Powell was there in his bath - chair at twelve , with a doctor on one side of him and a friend on the other , in some purlieu of the House , and did his duty like a fine old Briton as he was . That speech of Mr. Daubeny 's will never be forgotten by any one who heard it . Its studied bitterness had perhaps never been equalled , and yet not a word was uttered for the saying of which he could be accused of going beyond the limits of parliamentary antagonism . It is true that personalities could not have been closer , that accusations of political dishonesty and of almost worse than political cowardice and falsehood could not have been clearer , that no words in the language could have attributed meaner motives or more unscrupulous conduct . But , nevertheless , Mr. Daubeny in all that he said was parliamentary , and showed himself to be a gladiator thoroughly well trained for the arena in which he had descended to the combat . His arrows were poisoned , and his lance was barbed , and his shot was heated red , - because such things are allowed . He did not poison his enemies ' wells or use Greek fire , because those things are not allowed . He knew exactly the rules of the combat . Mr. Mildmay sat and heard him without once raising his hat from his brow , or speaking a word to his neighbour . Men on both sides of the House said that Mr. Mildmay suffered terribly ; but as Mr. Mildmay uttered no word of complaint to any one , and was quite ready to take Mr. Daubeny by the hand the next time they met in company , I do not know that any one was able to form a true idea of Mr. Mildmay 's feelings . Mr. Mildmay was an impassive man who rarely spoke of his own feelings , and no doubt sat with his hat low down over his eyes in order that no man might judge of them on that occasion by the impression on his features .

26666	26852	26648	26648	I	0	" Phineas , though it had been past five before he went to bed , - for there had been much triumphant talking to be done among liberal members after the division , - was up at his breakfast at Mrs. Bunce 's lodgings by nine . There was a matter which he was called upon to settle immediately in which Mrs. Bunce herself was much interested , and respecting which he had promised to give an answer on this very morning . A set of very dingy chambers up two pairs of stairs at No . 9 , Old Square , Lincoln 's Inn , to which Mr. Low had recommended him to transfer himself and all his belongings , were waiting his occupation , should he resolve upon occupying them . If he intended to commence operations as a barrister , it would be necessary that he should have chambers and a clerk ; and before he had left Mr. Low 's house on Sunday evening he had almost given that gentleman authority to secure for him these rooms at No . 9 . "
26867	26873	26861	26861	you	1391	" Mr. Low had said ; "
26890	27611	26884	26884	you	1391	" Mr. Low hoped that he might be able to wean Phineas away from his Parliament bauble ; - that he might induce the young barrister to give up his madness , if not this session or the next , at any rate before a third year had commenced . Mr. Low was a persistent man , liking very much when he did like , and loving very strongly when he did love . He would have many a tug for Phineas Finn before he would allow that false Westminster Satan to carry off the prey as altogether his own . If he could only get Phineas into the dingy chambers he might do much ! But Phineas had now become so imbued with the atmosphere of politics , had been so breathed upon by Lady Laura and Barrington Erle , that he could no longer endure the thought of any other life than that of a life spent among the lobbies . A desire to help to beat the Conservatives had fastened on his very soul , and almost made Mr. Low odious in his eyes . He was afraid of Mr. Low , and for the nonce would not go to him any more ; - but he must see the porter at Lincoln 's Inn , he must write a line to Mr. Low , and he must tell Mrs. Bunce that for the present he would still keep on her rooms . His letter to Mr. Low was as follows : - Great Marlborough Street , May , 186 - . MY DEAR LOW , I have made up my mind against taking the chambers , and am now off to the Inn to say that I shall not want them . Of course , I know what you will think of me , and it is very grievous to me to have to bear the hard judgment of a man whose opinion I value so highly ; but , in the teeth of your terribly strong arguments , I think that there is something to be said on my side of the question . This seat in Parliament has come in my way by chance , and I think it would be pusillanimous in me to reject it , feeling , as I do , that a seat in Parliament confers very great honour . I am , too , very fond of politics , and regard legislation as the finest profession going . Had I any one dependent on me , I probably might not be justified in following the bent of my inclination . But I am all alone in the world , and therefore have a right to make the attempt . If , after a trial of one or two sessions , I should fail in that which I am attempting , it will not even then be too late to go back to the better way . I can assure you that at any rate it is not my intention to be idle . I know very well how you will fret and fume over what I say , and how utterly I shall fail in bringing you round to my way of thinking ; but as I must write to tell you of my decision , I can not refrain from defending myself to the best of my ability . Yours always faithfully , PHINEAS FINN . Mr. Low received this letter at his chambers , and when he had read it , he simply pressed his lips closely together , placed the sheet of paper back in its envelope , and put it into a drawer at his left hand . Having done this , he went on with what work he had before him , as though his friend 's decision were a matter of no consequence to him . As far as he was concerned the thing was done , and there should be an end of it . So he told himself ; but nevertheless his mind was full of it all day ; and , though he wrote not a word of answer to Phineas , he made a reply within his own mind to every one of the arguments used in the letter . "
27741	27823	27825	27825	I	0	" In this way , before the day was over , Mr. Low became very angry , and swore to himself that he would have nothing more to say to Phineas Finn . But yet he found himself creating plans for encountering and conquering the parliamentary fiend who was at present so cruelly potent with his pupil . It was not till the third evening that he told his wife that Finn had made up his mind not to take chambers . "
27835	27842	27825	27825	I	0	" said Mrs. Low , savagely . "
27856	27857	27846	27846	I	0	" "
27864	27873	27874	27874	he	1393	" said Mrs. Low , with great emphasis ; "
27881	27882	27874	27874	he	1393	" "
27885	27902	27903	27903	he	1393	" said Mr. Low , who was a man thoroughly and thoughtfully just at all points ; "
27962	28560	27916	27916	he	1393	" Phineas , when he had written his letter to Mr. Low , started off for Lincoln 's Inn , making his way through the well - known dreary streets of Soho , and through St. Giles 's , to Long Acre . He knew every corner well , for he had walked the same road almost daily for the last three years . He had conceived a liking for the route , which he might easily have changed without much addition to the distance , by passing through Oxford Street and Holborn ; but there was an air of business on which he prided himself in going by the most direct passage , and he declared to himself very often that things dreary and dingy to the eye might be good in themselves . Lincoln 's Inn itself is dingy , and the Law Courts therein are perhaps the meanest in which Equity ever disclosed herself . Mr. Low 's three rooms in the Old Square , each of them brown with the binding of law books and with the dust collected on law papers , and with furniture that had been brown always , and had become browner with years , were perhaps as unattractive to the eye of a young pupil as any rooms which were ever entered . And the study of the Chancery law itself is not an alluring pursuit till the mind has come to have some insight into the beauty of its ultimate object . Phineas , during his three years ' course of reasoning on these things , had taught himself to believe that things ugly on the outside might be very beautiful within ; and had therefore come to prefer crossing Poland Street and Soho Square , and so continuing his travels by the Seven Dials and Long Acre . His morning walk was of a piece with his morning studies , and he took pleasure in the gloom of both . But now the taste of his palate had been already changed by the glare of the lamps in and about palatial Westminster , and he found that St. Giles 's was disagreeable . The ways about Pall Mall and across the Park to Parliament Street , or to the Treasury , were much pleasanter , and the new offices in Downing Street , already half built , absorbed all that interest which he had hitherto been able to take in the suggested but uncommenced erection of new Law Courts in the neighbourhood of Lincoln 's Inn . As he made his way to the porter 's lodge under the great gateway of Lincoln 's Inn , he told himself that he was glad that he had escaped , at any rate for a while , from a life so dull and dreary . If he could only sit in chambers at the Treasury instead of chambers in that old court , how much pleasanter it would be ! After all , as regarded that question of income , it might well be that the Treasury chambers should be the more remunerative , and the more quickly remunerative , of the two . And , as he thought , Lady Laura might be compatible with the Treasury chambers and Parliament , but could not possibly be made compatible with Old Square , Lincoln 's Inn . But nevertheless there came upon him a feeling of sorrow when the old man at the lodge seemed to be rather glad than otherwise that he did not want the chambers . "
28568	28573	28562	28563	Mr. Green	424	" said the porter ; "
28603	28937	28588	28589	the gen'lemen	1401	" Mr. Green was welcome to the chambers as far as Phineas was concerned ; but Phineas felt nevertheless a certain amount of regret that he should have been compelled to abandon a thing which was regarded both by the porter and by Mr. Green as being so desirable . He had however written his letter to Mr. Low , and made his promise to Barrington Erle , and was bound to Lady Laura Standish ; and he walked out through the old gateway into Chancery Lane , resolving that he would not even visit Lincoln 's Inn again for a year . There were certain books , - law books , - which he would read at such intervals of leisure as politics might give him ; but within the precincts of the Inns of Court he would not again put his foot for twelve months , let learned pundits of the law , - such for instance as Mr. and Mrs. Low , - say what they might . He had told Mrs. Bunce , before he left his home after breakfast , that he should for the present remain under her roof . She had been much gratified , not simply because lodgings in Great Marlborough Street are less readily let than chambers in Lincoln 's Inn , but also because it was a great honour to her to have a member of Parliament in her house . Members of Parliament are not so common about Oxford Street as they are in the neighbourhood of Pall Mall and St. James 's Square . But Mr. Bunce , when he came home to his dinner , did not join as heartily as he should have done in his wife 's rejoicing . Mr. Bunce was in the employment of certain copying law - stationers in Carey Street , and had a strong belief in the law as a profession ; - but he had none whatever in the House of Commons . "
28947	28955	28939	28939	he	1403	" said Mr. Bunce to his wife . "
28964	28969	28939	28939	he	1403	" said Mrs. Bunce . "
28980	28985	28971	28971	he	1403	" said Mr. Bunce . "

29378	29737	29371	29371	his	749	" Mr. Bunce was a copying journeyman , who spent ten hours a day in Carey Street with a pen between his fingers ; and after that he would often spend two or three hours of the night with a pen between his fingers in Marlborough Street . He was a thoroughly hard - working man , doing pretty well in the world , for he had a good house over his head , and always could find raiment and bread for his wife and eight children ; but , nevertheless , he was an unhappy man because he suffered from political grievances , or , I should more correctly say , that his grievances were semi - political and semi - social . He had no vote , not being himself the tenant of the house in Great Marlborough Street . The tenant was a tailor who occupied the shop , whereas Bunce occupied the whole of the remainder of the premises . He was a lodger , and lodgers were not as yet trusted with the franchise . And he had ideas , which he himself admitted to be very raw , as to the injustice of the manner in which he was paid for his work . So much a folio , without reference to the way in which his work was done , without regard to the success of his work , with no questions asked of himself , was , as he thought , no proper way of remunerating a man for his labours . He had long since joined a Trade Union , and for two years past had paid a subscription of a shilling a week towards its funds . He longed to be doing some battle against his superiors , and to be putting himself in opposition to his employers ; - not that he objected personally to Messrs. Foolscap , Margin , and Vellum , who always made much of him as a useful man ; - but because some such antagonism would be manly , and the fighting of some battle would be the right thing to do . "
29750	29758	29371	29371	his	749	" Bunce would say to his wife , "
29770	30343	30344	30344	I	0	" Mrs. Bunce was a comfortable motherly woman , who loved her husband but hated politics . As he had an aversion to his superiors in the world because they were superiors , so had she a liking for them for the same reason . She despised people poorer than herself , and thought it a fair subject for boasting that her children always had meat for dinner . If it was ever so small a morsel , she took care that they had it , in order that the boast might be maintained . The world had once or twice been almost too much for her , - when , for instance , her husband had been ill ; and again , to tell the truth , for the last three months of that long period in which Phineas had omitted to pay his bills ; but she had kept a fine brave heart during those troubles , and could honestly swear that the children always had a bit of meat , though she herself had been occasionally without it for days together . At such times she would be more than ordinarily meek to Mr. Margin , and especially courteous to the old lady who lodged in her first - floor drawing - room , - for Phineas lived up two pairs of stairs , - and she would excuse such servility by declaring that there was no knowing how soon she might want assistance . But her husband , in such emergencies , would become furious and quarrelsome , and would declare that Labour was going to the wall , and that something very strong must be done at once . That shilling which Bunce paid weekly to the Union she regarded as being absolutely thrown away , - as much so as though he cast it weekly into the Thames . And she had told him so , over and over again , making heart - piercing allusions to the eight children and to the bit of meat . He would always endeavour to explain to her that there was no other way under the sun for keeping Labour from being sent to the wall ; - but he would do so hopelessly and altogether ineffectually , and she had come to regard him as a lunatic to the extent of that one weekly shilling . She had a woman 's instinctive partiality for comeliness in a man , and was very fond of Phineas Finn because he was handsome . And now she was very proud of him because he was a member of Parliament . She had heard , - from her husband , who had told her the fact with much disgust , - that the sons of Dukes and Earls go into Parliament , and she liked to think that the fine young man to whom she talked more or less every day should sit with the sons of Dukes and Earls . When Phineas had really brought distress upon her by owing her some thirty or forty pounds , she could never bring herself to be angry with him , - because he was handsome and because he dined out with Lords . And she had triumphed greatly over her husband , who had desired to be severe upon his aristocratic debtor , when the money had all been paid in a lump . "

30438	30469	30422	30423	Mr. Finn	329	" Phineas returned to his lodgings before he went down to his club , and again told Mrs. Bunce that he had altogether made up his mind about the chambers . "

30759	30853	30750	30751	his wife	947	" After that Phineas went down to the Reform Club , and made one of those who were buzzing there in little crowds and uttering their prophecies as to future events . Lord de Terrier was to go out . That was certain . Whether Mr. Mildmay was to come in was uncertain . That he would go to Windsor to - morrow morning was not to be doubted ; but it was thought very probable that he might plead his age , and decline to undertake the responsibility of forming a Ministry . "
30858	30866	30750	30751	his wife	947	" said Phineas to his friend Fitzgibbon . "
30940	30941	31375	31375	you	1455	" "
30948	30949	30952	30952	them	1453	" "
30969	31055	30952	30952	them	1453	" That was Mr. Fitzgibbon 's description of the crisis ; but then it was understood that Mr. Fitzgibbon was given to romancing . CHAPTER VIII The News about Mr. Mildmay and Sir Everard Fitzgibbon and Phineas started together from Pall Mall for Portman Square , - as both of them had promised to call on Lady Laura , - but Fitzgibbon turned in at Brooks 's as they walked up St. James 's Square , and Phineas went on by himself in a cab . "
31061	31372	30952	30952	them	1453	" said Fitzgibbon as his friend entered the cab , and Phineas immediately began to feel that he would have done nothing till he could get into Brooks 's . It might be very well to begin by talking politics at the Reform Club . Such talking had procured for him his seat at Loughshane . But that was done now , and something more than talking was wanted for any further progress . Nothing , as he told himself , of political import was managed at the Reform Club . No influence from thence was ever brought to bear upon the adjustment of places under the Government , or upon the arrangement of cabinets . It might be very well to count votes at the Reform Club ; but after the votes had been counted , - had been counted successfully , - Brooks 's was the place , as Phineas believed , to learn at the earliest moment what would be the exact result of the success . He must get into Brooks 's , if it might be possible for him . Fitzgibbon was not exactly the man to propose him . Perhaps the Earl of Brentford would do it . Lady Laura was at home , and with her was sitting - Mr. Kennedy . Phineas had intended to be triumphant as he entered Lady Laura 's room . He was there with the express purpose of triumphing in the success of their great party , and of singing a pleasant paean in conjunction with Lady Laura . But his trumpet was put out of tune at once when he saw Mr. Kennedy . He said hardly a word as he gave his hand to Lady Laura , - and then afterwards to Mr. Kennedy , who chose to greet him with this show of cordiality . "
31382	31389	31379	31380	Mr. Finn	329	" said Lady Laura , laughing . "
31393	31394	31379	31380	Mr. Finn	329	" "
31410	31411	31400	31400	I	0	" "
31442	31443	31439	31440	Lady Laura	396	" "
31454	31455	31445	31445	you	1455	" "
31490	31491	31492	31493	Mr. Kennedy	343	" "
31529	31600	31525	31525	they	1457	" So Mr. Kennedy also was a member of Brooks 's ! At the Reform Club there certainly had been an idea that the number might have been swelled to twenty - one ; but then , as Phineas began to understand , nothing was correctly known at the Reform Club . For an accurate appreciation of the political balance of the day , you must go to Brooks 's . "
31609	31613	31601	31602	Mr. Kennedy	343	" said Phineas . "
31652	31653	31641	31643	Lord de Terrier	366	" "
31661	31666	31654	31654	He	366	" said Mr. Kennedy . "
31673	31679	31654	31654	He	366	" said Phineas , roughly . "
31683	31688	31654	31654	He	366	" said Lady Laura . "
31711	31712	31698	31698	he	334	" "
31721	31725	31698	31698	he	334	" said Phineas . "
31756	31779	31753	31754	Mr. Monk	346	" Phineas had at his tongue 's end all the lesson that he had been able to learn at the Reform Club . "
31789	31794	31784	31785	the Duke	1449	" said Mr. Kennedy . "
31801	31805	31784	31785	the Duke	1449	" said Phineas . "
31877	31878	31917	31917	you	0	" "
31890	31903	31888	31888	you	0	" said Lady Laura , again smiling as she spoke to him . "
31921	31922	31917	31917	you	0	" "
31976	31995	31937	31937	you	0	" Then the objectionable Mr. Kennedy took his leave , and Phineas was left alone with Lady Laura . "
32005	32112	32113	32114	Mr. Finn	329	" he began , as soon as he found the field to be open for himself and his own manoeuvring . But he was very young , and had not as yet learned the manner in which he might best advance his cause with such a woman as Lady Laura Standish . He was telling her too clearly that he could have no gratification in talking with her unless he could be allowed to have her all to himself . That might be very well if Lady Laura were in love with him , but would hardly be the way to reduce her to that condition . "
32116	32125	32113	32114	Mr. Finn	329	" said she , smiling as she spoke , "
32146	32147	32137	32137	you	329	" "

32405	32439	32398	32401	a man at forty	1476	" Phineas , remembering that he had put down Mr. Kennedy 's age as forty in his own mind , frowned when he heard this , and walked about the room in displeasure . "
32443	32448	32449	32449	I	0	" continued Lady Laura , "

32707	32752	32755	32755	you	329	" Phineas paused for a moment before he answered her , thinking whether or not it would be well to ask her some question which might produce from her a truth which he would not like to hear . Then he did ask it . "
32759	32773	32755	32755	you	329	" he said . She too paused , but only for a second . "

32989	33030	33031	33031	I	0	" Phineas liked being called an impetuous Irish boy , and came close to her , sitting where he could look up into her face ; and there came a smile upon his own , and he was very handsome . "
33042	33047	33036	33040	a man of great wealth	1491	" continued Lady Laura ; "

33413	33498	33401	33401	he	343	" At this moment a side door was opened , and the red - haired , red - bearded man whom Phineas had seen before entered the room . He hesitated a moment , as though he were going to retreat again , and then began to pull about the books and toys which lay on one of the distant tables , as though he were in quest of some article . And he would have retreated had not Lady Laura called to him . "

34036	34376	34034	34034	me	0	" Phineas was engaged to dine with one of the Vice - Chancellors on the day named . He had never before dined at the house of this great law luminary , whose acquaintance he had made through Mr. Low , and he had thought a great deal of the occasion . Mrs. Freemantle had sent him the invitation nearly a fortnight ago , and he understood there was to be an elaborate dinner party . He did not know it for a fact , but he was in hopes of meeting the expiring Lord Chancellor . He considered it to be his duty never to throw away such a chance . He would in all respects have preferred Mr. Freemantle 's dinner in Eaton Place , dull and heavy though it might probably be , to the chance of Lord Chiltern 's companions at Moroni 's . Whatever might be the faults of our hero , he was not given to what is generally called dissipation by the world at large , - by which the world means self - indulgence . He cared not a brass farthing for Moroni 's Chateau Yquem , nor for the wondrously studied repast which he would doubtless find prepared for him at that celebrated establishment in St. James 's Street ; - not a farthing as compared with the chance of meeting so great a man as Lord Moles . And Lord Chiltern 's friends might probably be just the men whom he would not desire to know . But Lady Laura 's request overrode everything with him . She had asked him to oblige her , and of course he would do so . Had he been going to dine with the incoming Prime Minister , he would have put off his engagement at her request . He was not quick enough to make an answer without hesitation ; but after a moment 's pause he said he should be most happy to dine with Lord Chiltern at Moroni 's . "
34398	34592	34593	34594	the Duke	1449	" Then the servant announced more visitors , and Lord Chiltern escaped out of the room before he was seen by the new comers . These were Mrs. Bonteen and Laurence Fitzgibbon , and then Mr. Bonteen , - and after them Mr. Ratler , the Whip , who was in a violent hurry , and did not stay there a moment , and then Barrington Erle and young Lord James Fitz - Howard , the youngest son of the Duke of St. Bungay . In twenty or thirty minutes there was a gathering of liberal political notabilities in Lady Laura 's drawing - room . There were two great pieces of news by which they were all enthralled . Mr. Mildmay would not be Prime Minister , and Sir Everard Powell was - dead . Of course nothing quite positive could be known about Mr. Mildmay . He was to be with the Queen at Windsor on the morrow at eleven o'clock , and it was improbable that he would tell his mind to any one before he told it to her Majesty . But there was no doubt that he had engaged "
34596	34624	34593	34594	the Duke	1449	" - so he was called by Lord James , - to go down to Windsor with him , that he might be in readiness if wanted . "
34632	34733	34593	34594	the Duke	1449	" said Lord James , who had just heard the news from his sister , who had heard it from the Duchess . Lord James was delighted with the importance given to him by his father 's coming journey . From this , and from other equally well - known circumstances , it was surmised that Mr. Mildmay would decline the task proposed to him . This , nevertheless , was only a surmise , - whereas the fact with reference to Sir Everard was fully substantiated . The gout had flown to his stomach , and he was dead . "
34745	34807	34593	34594	the Duke	1449	" said Mr. Ratler , who at that moment , however , was not within hearing of either of the ladies present . And then he rubbed his hands , and looked as though he were delighted . And he was delighted , - not because his old friend Sir Everard was dead , but by the excitement of the tragedy . "
34819	34824	34593	34594	the Duke	1449	" said Laurence Fitzgibbon , "
34839	34840	34841	34841	I	0	" "
34853	34858	34851	34851	Ratler	417	" said Mr. Bonteen ; "

34929	34978	34979	34979	I	0	" But nevertheless I think that Mr. Ratler was somewhat in dread of future newspaper paragraphs , should it be found necessary to summon a coroner 's inquisition to sit upon poor Sir Everard . While this was going on Lady Laura took Phineas apart for a moment . "

35330	35959	35317	35317	I	0	" Phineas walked down to Westminster with his mind very full of Lady Laura and Lord Chiltern . What did she mean by her affectionate manner to himself , and what did she mean by the continual praises which she lavished upon Mr. Kennedy ? Of whom was she thinking most , of Mr. Kennedy , or of him ? She had called herself his mentor . Was the description of her feelings towards himself , as conveyed in that name , of a kind to be gratifying to him ? No ; - he thought not . But then might it not be within his power to change the nature of those feelings ? She was not in love with him at present . He could not make any boast to himself on that head . But it might be within his power to compel her to love him . The female mentor might be softened . That she could not love Mr. Kennedy , he thought that he was quite sure . There was nothing like love in her manner to Mr. Kennedy . As to Lord Chiltern , Phineas would do whatever might be in his power . All that he really knew of Lord Chiltern was that he had gambled and that he had drunk . CHAPTER IX The New Government In the House of Lords that night , and in the House of Commons , the outgoing Ministers made their explanations . As our business at the present moment is with the Commons , we will confine ourselves to their chamber , and will do so the more willingly because the upshot of what was said in the two places was the same . The outgoing ministers were very grave , very self - laudatory , and very courteous . In regard to courtesy it may be declared that no stranger to the ways of the place could have understood how such soft words could be spoken by Mr. Daubeny , beaten , so quickly after the very sharp words which he had uttered when he only expected to be beaten . He announced to his fellow - commoners that his right honourable friend and colleague Lord de Terrier had thought it right to retire from the Treasury . Lord de Terrier , in constitutional obedience to the vote of the Lower House , had resigned , and the Queen had been graciously pleased to accept Lord de Terrier 's resignation . Mr. Daubeny could only inform the House that her Majesty had signified her pleasure that Mr. Mildmay should wait upon her to - morrow at eleven o'clock . Mr. Mildmay , - so Mr. Daubeny understood , - would be with her Majesty to - morrow at that hour . Lord de Terrier had found it to be his duty to recommend her Majesty to send for Mr. Mildmay . Such was the real import of Mr. Daubeny 's speech . That further portion of it in which he explained with blandest , most beneficent , honey - flowing words that his party would have done everything that the country could require of any party , had the House allowed it to remain on the Treasury benches for a month or two , - and explained also that his party would never recriminate , would never return evil for evil , would in no wise copy the factious opposition of their adversaries ; that his party would now , as it ever had done , carry itself with the meekness of the dove , and the wisdom of the serpent , - all this , I say , was so generally felt by gentlemen on both sides of the House to be "
35963	36573	35317	35317	I	0	" that very little attention was paid to it . The great point was that Lord de Terrier had resigned , and that Mr. Mildmay had been summoned to Windsor . The Queen had sent for Mr. Mildmay in compliance with advice given to her by Lord de Terrier . And yet Lord de Terrier and his first lieutenant had used all the most practised efforts of their eloquence for the last three days in endeavouring to make their countrymen believe that no more unfitting Minister than Mr. Mildmay ever attempted to hold the reins of office ! Nothing had been too bad for them to say of Mr. Mildmay , - and yet , in the very first moment in which they found themselves unable to carry on the Government themselves , they advised the Queen to send for that most incompetent and baneful statesman ! We who are conversant with our own methods of politics , see nothing odd in this , because we are used to it ; but surely in the eyes of strangers our practice must be very singular . There is nothing like it in any other country , - nothing as yet . Nowhere else is there the same good - humoured , affectionate , prize - fighting ferocity in politics . The leaders of our two great parties are to each other exactly as are the two champions of the ring who knock each other about for the belt and for five hundred pounds a side once in every two years . How they fly at each other , striking as though each blow should carry death if it were but possible ! And yet there is no one whom the Birmingham Bantam respects so highly as he does Bill Burns the Brighton Bully , or with whom he has so much delight in discussing the merits of a pot of half - and - half . And so it was with Mr. Daubeny and Mr. Mildmay . In private life Mr. Daubeny almost adulated his elder rival , - and Mr. Mildmay never omitted an opportunity of taking Mr. Daubeny warmly by the hand . It is not so in the United States . There the same political enmity exists , but the political enmity produces private hatred . The leaders of parties there really mean what they say when they abuse each other , and are in earnest when they talk as though they were about to tear each other limb from limb . I doubt whether Mr. Daubeny would have injured a hair of Mr. Mildmay 's venerable head , even for an assurance of six continued months in office . When Mr. Daubeny had completed his statement , Mr. Mildmay simply told the House that he had received and would obey her Majesty 's commands . The House would of course understand that he by no means meant to aver that the Queen would even commission him to form a Ministry . But if he took no such command from her Majesty it would become his duty to recommend her Majesty to impose the task upon some other person . Then everything was said that had to be said , and members returned to their clubs . A certain damp was thrown over the joy of some excitable Liberals by tidings which reached the House during Mr. Daubeny 's speech . Sir Everard Powell was no more dead than was Mr. Daubeny himself . Now it is very unpleasant to find that your news is untrue , when you have been at great pains to disseminate it . "
36581	36586	36587	36588	Lady Powell	446	" said Mr. Ratler . "
36596	36603	36587	36588	Lady Powell	446	" said Mr. Ratler 's opponent , "
36637	36638	36587	36588	Lady Powell	446	" "
36649	37280	37281	37281	I	0	" said Mr. Ratler . The political portion of London was in a ferment for the next five days . On the Sunday morning it was known that Mr. Mildmay had declined to put himself at the head of a liberal Government . He and the Duke of St. Bungay , and Mr. Plantagenet Palliser , had been in conference so often , and so long , that it may almost be said they lived together in conference . Then Mr. Gresham had been with Mr. Mildmay , - and Mr. Monk also . At the clubs it was said by many that Mr. Monk had been with Mr. Mildmay ; but it was also said very vehemently by others that no such interview had taken place . Mr. Monk was a Radical , much admired by the people , sitting in Parliament for that most Radical of all constituencies , the Pottery Hamlets , who had never as yet been in power . It was the great question of the day whether Mr. Mildmay would or would not ask Mr. Monk to join him ; and it was said by those who habitually think at every period of change that the time has now come in which the difficulties to forming a government will at last be found to be insuperable , that Mr. Mildmay could not succeed either with Mr. Monk or without him . There were at the present moment two sections of these gentlemen , - the section which declared that Mr. Mildmay had sent for Mr. Monk , and the section which declared that he had not . But there were others , who perhaps knew better what they were saying , by whom it was asserted that the whole difficulty lay with Mr. Gresham . Mr. Gresham was willing to serve with Mr. Mildmay , - with certain stipulations as to the special seat in the Cabinet which he himself was to occupy , and as to the introduction of certain friends of his own ; but , - so said these gentlemen who were supposed really to understand the matter , - Mr. Gresham was not willing to serve with the Duke and with Mr. Palliser . Now , everybody who knew anything knew that the Duke and Mr. Palliser were indispensable to Mr. Mildmay . And a liberal Government , with Mr. Gresham in the opposition , could not live half through a session ! All Sunday and Monday these things were discussed ; and on the Monday Lord de Terrier absolutely stated to the Upper House that he had received her Majesty 's commands to form another government . Mr. Daubeny , in half a dozen most modest words , - in words hardly audible , and most unlike himself , - made his statement in the Lower House to the same effect . Then Mr. Ratler , and Mr. Bonteen , and Mr. Barrington Erle , and Mr. Laurence Fitzgibbon aroused themselves and swore that such things could not be . Should the prey which they had won for themselves , the spoil of their bows and arrows , be snatched from out of their very mouths by treachery ? Lord de Terrier and Mr. Daubeny could not venture even to make another attempt unless they did so in combination with Mr. Gresham . Such a combination , said Mr. Barrington Erle , would be disgraceful to both parties , but would prove Mr. Gresham to be as false as Satan himself . Early on the Tuesday morning , when it was known that Mr. Gresham had been at Lord de Terrier 's house , Barrington Erle was free to confess that he had always been afraid of Mr. Gresham . "
37287	37291	37281	37281	I	0	" said he , "
37306	37524	37303	37304	Mr. Gresham	431	" On that Tuesday morning Mr. Gresham certainly was with Lord de Terrier , but nothing came of it . Mr. Gresham was either not enough like Satan for the occasion , or else he was too closely like him . Lord de Terrier did not bid high enough , or else Mr. Gresham did not like biddings from that quarter . Nothing then came from this attempt , and on the Tuesday afternoon the Queen again sent for Mr. Mildmay . On the Wednesday morning the gentlemen who thought that the insuperable difficulties had at length arrived , began to wear their longest faces , and to be triumphant with melancholy forebodings . Now at last there was a dead lock . Nobody could form a government . It was asserted that Mr. Mildmay had fallen at her Majesty 's feet dissolved in tears , and had implored to be relieved from further responsibility . It was well known to many at the clubs that the Queen had on that morning telegraphed to Germany for advice . There were men so gloomy as to declare that the Queen must throw herself into the arms of Mr. Monk , unless Mr. Mildmay would consent to rise from his knees and once more buckle on his ancient armour . "
37533	37542	37543	37543	I	0	" said Barrington Erle , in his anger . "
37551	37555	37543	37543	I	0	" said Ratler , "
37575	38234	38235	38235	I	0	" Mr. Barrington Erle 's reply to that suggestion I may not dare to insert in these pages . On the Wednesday night , however , it was known that everything had been arranged , and before the Houses met on the Thursday every place had been bestowed , either in reality or in imagination . The Times , in its second edition on the Thursday , gave a list of the Cabinet , in which four places out of fourteen were rightly filled . On the Friday it named ten places aright , and indicated the law officers , with only one mistake in reference to Ireland ; and on the Saturday it gave a list of the Under Secretaries of State , and Secretaries and Vice - Presidents generally , with wonderful correctness as to the individuals , though the offices were a little jumbled . The Government was at last formed in a manner which everybody had seen to be the only possible way in which a government could be formed . Nobody was surprised , and the week 's work was regarded as though the regular routine of government making had simply been followed . Mr. Mildmay was Prime Minister ; Mr. Gresham was at the Foreign Office ; Mr. Monk was at the Board of Trade ; the Duke was President of the Council ; the Earl of Brentford was Privy Seal ; and Mr. Palliser was Chancellor of the Exchequer . Barrington Erle made a step up in the world , and went to the Admiralty as Secretary ; Mr. Bonteen was sent again to the Admiralty ; and Laurence Fitzgibbon became a junior Lord of the Treasury . Mr. Ratler was , of course , installed as Patronage Secretary to the same Board . Mr. Ratler was perhaps the only man in the party as to whose destination there could not possibly be a doubt . Mr. Ratler had really qualified himself for a position in such a way as to make all men feel that he would , as a matter of course , be called upon to fill it . I do not know whether as much could be said on behalf of any other man in the new Government . During all this excitement , and through all these movements , Phineas Finn felt himself to be left more and more out in the cold . He had not been such a fool as to suppose that any office would be offered to him . He had never hinted at such a thing to his one dearly intimate friend , Lady Laura . He had not hitherto opened his mouth in Parliament . Indeed , when the new Government was formed he had not been sitting for above a fortnight . Of course nothing could be done for him as yet . But , nevertheless , he felt himself to be out in the cold . The very men who had discussed with him the question of the division , - who had discussed it with him because his vote was then as good as that of any other member , - did not care to talk to him about the distribution of places . He , at any rate , could not be one of them . He , at any rate , could not be a rival . He could neither mar nor assist . He could not be either a successful or a disappointed sympathiser , - because he could not himself be a candidate . The affair which perhaps disgusted him more than anything else was the offer of an office , - not in the Cabinet , indeed , but one supposed to confer high dignity , - to Mr. Kennedy . Mr. Kennedy refused the offer , and this somewhat lessened Finn 's disgust , but the offer itself made him unhappy . "
38246	38252	38253	38253	I	0	" he said to Fitzgibbon . "
38259	38263	38253	38253	I	0	" said Fitzgibbon . "

38310	38317	38306	38307	Mr. Kennedy	343	" said Lady Laura to him . "
38336	38414	38325	38330	the Right Hon . Robert Kennedy	449	" Phineas when he said this did not as yet know exactly how it would have come to pass that such honour , - the honour of the enduring prefix to his name , - would have come in the way of Mr. Kennedy had Mr. Kennedy accepted the office in question ; but he was very quick to learn all these things , and , in the meantime , he rarely made any mistake about them . "
38428	38433	38434	38434	He	1551	" said Lady Laura . "
38500	38501	38477	38498	a few whose special walk in life it is to be independent , and , as it were , unmoved by parties	1554	" "
38509	38513	38505	38505	You	1555	" said Phineas . "
38521	38526	38527	38527	He	1551	" said Lady Laura . "
38534	38540	38527	38527	He	1551	" said Phineas , ironically . "
38547	38599	38600	38600	I	0	" said Lady Laura , in sober earnest . The dinner at Moroni 's had been eaten , and Phineas had given an account of the entertainment to Lord Chiltern 's sister . There had been only two other guests , and both of them had been men on the turf . "
38606	38610	38612	38612	he	1551	" said Phineas , "
38631	38632	38622	38622	you	1557	" "

38733	38838	38725	38725	They	1559	" Then Lady Laura burst out into tears , and Phineas sat near her , and consoled her , and swore that if in any way he could befriend her brother he would do so . Mr. Fitzgibbon at this time claimed a promise which he said that Phineas had made to him , - that Phineas would go over with him to Mayo to assist at his re - election . And Phineas did go . The whole affair occupied but a week , and was chiefly memorable as being the means of cementing the friendship which existed between the two Irish members . "
38844	38857	38725	38725	They	1559	" said Laurence Fitzgibbon , speaking of the salary of his office . "
38898	39858	38896	38896	Kennedy	343	" CHAPTER X Violet Effingham It was now the middle of May , and a month had elapsed since the terrible difficulty about the Queen 's Government had been solved . A month had elapsed , and things had shaken themselves into their places with more of ease and apparent fitness than men had given them credit for possessing . Mr. Mildmay , Mr. Gresham , and Mr. Monk were the best friends in the world , swearing by each other in their own house , and supported in the other by as gallant a phalanx of Whig peers as ever were got together to fight against the instincts of their own order in compliance with the instincts of those below them . Lady Laura 's father was in the Cabinet , to Lady Laura 's infinite delight . It was her ambition to be brought as near to political action as was possible for a woman without surrendering any of the privileges of feminine inaction . That women should even wish to have votes at parliamentary elections was to her abominable , and the cause of the Rights of Women generally was odious to her ; but , nevertheless , for herself , she delighted in hoping that she too might be useful , - in thinking that she too was perhaps , in some degree , politically powerful ; and she had received considerable increase to such hopes when her father accepted the Privy Seal . The Earl himself was not an ambitious man , and , but for his daughter , would have severed himself altogether from political life before this time . He was an unhappy man ; - being an obstinate man , and having in his obstinacy quarrelled with his only son . In his unhappiness he would have kept himself alone , living in the country , brooding over his wretchedness , were it not for his daughter . On her behalf , and in obedience to her requirements , he came yearly up to London , and , perhaps in compliance with her persuasion , had taken some part in the debates of the House of Lords . It is easy for a peer to be a statesman , if the trouble of the life be not too much for him . Lord Brentford was now a statesman , if a seat in the Cabinet be proof of statesmanship . At this time , in May , there was staying with Lady Laura in Portman Square a very dear friend of hers , by name Violet Effingham . Violet Effingham was an orphan , an heiress , and a beauty ; with a terrible aunt , one Lady Baldock , who was supposed to be the dragon who had Violet , as a captive maiden , in charge . But as Miss Effingham was of age , and was mistress of her own fortune , Lady Baldock was , in truth , not omnipotent as a dragon should be . The dragon , at any rate , was not now staying in Portman Square , and the captivity of the maiden was therefore not severe at the present moment . Violet Effingham was very pretty , but could hardly be said to be beautiful . She was small , with light crispy hair , which seemed to be ever on the flutter round her brows , and which yet was never a hair astray . She had sweet , soft grey eyes , which never looked at you long , hardly for a moment , - but which yet , in that half moment , nearly killed you by the power of their sweetness . Her cheek was the softest thing in nature , and the colour of it , when its colour was fixed enough to be told , was a shade of pink so faint and creamy that you would hardly dare to call it by its name . Her mouth was perfect , not small enough to give that expression of silliness which is so common , but almost divine , with the temptation of its full , rich , ruby lips . Her teeth , which she but seldom showed , were very even and very white , and there rested on her chin the dearest dimple that ever acted as a loadstar to mens 's eyes . The fault of her face , if it had a fault , was in her nose , - which was a little too sharp , and perhaps too small . A woman who wanted to depreciate Violet Effingham had once called her a pug - nosed puppet ; but I , as her chronicler , deny that she was pug - nosed , - and all the world who knew her soon came to understand that she was no puppet . In figure she was small , but not so small as she looked to be . Her feet and hands were delicately fine , and there was a softness about her whole person , an apparent compressibility , which seemed to indicate that she might go into very small compass . Into what compass and how compressed , there were very many men who held very different opinions . Violet Effingham was certainly no puppet . She was great at dancing , - as perhaps might be a puppet , - but she was great also at archery , great at skating , - and great , too , at hunting . With reference to that last accomplishment , she and Lady Baldock had had more than one terrible tussle , not always with advantage to the dragon . "
39863	39873	38896	38896	Kennedy	343	" she had said once during the last winter , "
39883	39901	39881	39881	George	370	" - George was her cousin , Lord Baldock , and was the dragon 's son , - "
39913	39914	39881	39881	George	370	" "
39927	39932	39916	39916	you	1562	" said the dragon . "
39948	40039	40040	40040	I	0	" said Violet . What was to be said to a young lady who spoke in this way , and who had become of age only a fortnight since ? She rode that day the famous run from Bagnall 's Gorse to Foulsham Common , and was in at the death . Violet Effingham was now sitting in conference with her friend Lady Laura , and they were discussing matters of high import , - of very high import , indeed , - to the interests of both of them . "
40049	40054	40040	40040	I	0	" said Lady Laura . "
40059	40064	40066	40066	he	1565	" said the other , "

40659	40699	40653	40653	I	0	" said Violet , with slow , emphatic words , and a little forward motion of her face , as though she were specially eager to convince her friend that she was quite in earnest in what she said . "
40717	40718	40706	40706	you	351	" "
40876	40877	40868	40868	I	0	" "

40974	41186	40956	40956	she	858	" Then there was a silence between them for a few minutes . Violet Effingham was doubled up in a corner of a sofa , with her feet tucked under her , and her face reclining upon one of her shoulders . And as she talked she was playing with a little toy which was constructed to take various shapes as it was flung this way or that . A bystander looking at her would have thought that the toy was much more to her than the conversation . Lady Laura was sitting upright , in a common chair , at a table not far from her companion , and was manifestly devoting herself altogether to the subject that was being discussed between them . She had taken no lounging , easy attitude , she had found no employment for her fingers , and she looked steadily at Violet as she talked , - whereas Violet was looking only at the little manikin which she tossed . And now Laura got up and came to the sofa , and sat close to her friend . Violet , though she somewhat moved one foot , so as to seem to make room for the other , still went on with her play . "

43250	43991	43247	43247	I	0	" said Violet . Then the door was opened , and the man of whom they were speaking entered the room . CHAPTER XI Lord Chiltern The reader has been told that Lord Chiltern was a red man , and that peculiarity of his personal appearance was certainly the first to strike a stranger . It imparted a certain look of ferocity to him , which was apt to make men afraid of him at first sight . Women are not actuated in the same way , and are accustomed to look deeper into men at the first sight than other men will trouble themselves to do . His beard was red , and was clipped , so as to have none of the softness of waving hair . The hair on his head also was kept short , and was very red , - and the colour of his face was red . Nevertheless he was a handsome man , with well - cut features , not tall , but very strongly built , and with a certain curl in the corner of his eyelids which gave to him a look of resolution , - which perhaps he did not possess . He was known to be a clever man , and when very young had had the reputation of being a scholar . When he was three - and - twenty grey - haired votaries of the turf declared that he would make his fortune on the race - course , - so clear - headed was he as to odds , so excellent a judge of a horse 's performances , and so gifted with a memory of events . When he was five - and - twenty he had lost every shilling of a fortune of his own , had squeezed from his father more than his father ever chose to name in speaking of his affairs to any one , and was known to be in debt . But he had sacrificed himself on one or two memorable occasions in conformity with turf laws of honour , and men said of him , either that he was very honest or very chivalric , - in accordance with the special views on the subject of the man who was speaking . It was reported now that he no longer owned horses on the turf ; - but this was doubted by some who could name the animals which they said that he owned , and which he ran in the name of Mr. Macnab , - said some ; of Mr. Pardoe , - said others ; of Mr. Chickerwick , - said a third set of informants . The fact was that Lord Chiltern at this moment had no interest of his own in any horse upon the turf . But all the world knew that he drank . He had taken by the throat a proctor 's bull - dog when he had been drunk at Oxford , had nearly strangled the man , and had been expelled . He had fallen through his violence into some terrible misfortune at Paris , had been brought before a public judge , and his name and his infamy had been made notorious in every newspaper in the two capitals . After that he had fought a ruffian at Newmarket , and had really killed him with his fists . In reference to this latter affray it had been proved that the attack had been made on him , that he had not been to blame , and that he had not been drunk . After a prolonged investigation he had come forth from that affair without disgrace . He would have done so , at least , if he had not been heretofore disgraced . But we all know how the man well spoken of may steal a horse , while he who is of evil repute may not look over a hedge . It was asserted widely by many who were supposed to know all about everything that Lord Chiltern was in a fit of delirium tremens when he killed the ruffian at Newmarket . The worst of that latter affair was that it produced the total estrangement which now existed between Lord Brentford and his son . Lord Brentford would not believe that his son was in that matter more sinned against than sinning . "
44003	44180	43247	43247	I	0	" he said , when Lady Laura pleaded for her brother . Lady Laura could not induce her father to see his son , but so far prevailed that no sentence of banishment was pronounced against Lord Chiltern . There was nothing to prevent the son sitting at his father 's table if he so pleased . He never did so please , - but nevertheless he continued to live in the house in Portman Square ; and when he met the Earl , in the hall , perhaps , or on the staircase , would simply bow to him . Then the Earl would bow again , and shuffle on , - and look very wretched , as no doubt he was . A grown - up son must be the greatest comfort a man can have , - if he be his father 's best friend ; but otherwise he can hardly be a comfort . As it was in this house , the son was a constant thorn in his father 's side . "
44190	44199	44183	44183	he	1685	" Lord Brentford once said to his daughter . "
44206	44207	44200	44200	He	1685	" "
44213	44214	44209	44209	he	1685	" "
44249	44250	44243	44243	They	1691	" "
44258	44263	44243	44243	They	1691	" said the Earl . "
44280	44586	44270	44272	no decent person	1693	" Lady Laura did not know what to say to this , for in truth Lord Chiltern was not fond of staying at the houses of persons whom the Earl would have called decent . General Effingham , the father of Violet , and Lord Brentford had been the closest and dearest of friends . They had been young men in the same regiment , and through life each had confided in the other . When the General 's only son , then a youth of seventeen , was killed in one of our grand New Zealand wars , the bereaved father and the Earl had been together for a month in their sorrow . At that time Lord Chiltern 's career had still been open to hope , - and the one man had contrasted his lot with the other . General Effingham lived long enough to hear the Earl declare that his lot was the happier of the two . Now the General was dead , and Violet , the daughter of a second wife , was all that was left of the Effinghams . This second wife had been a Miss Plummer , a lady from the city with much money , whose sister had married Lord Baldock . Violet in this way had fallen to the care of the Baldock people , and not into the hands of her father 's friends . But , as the reader will have surmised , she had ideas of her own of emancipating herself from Baldock thraldom . Twice before that last terrible affair at Newmarket , before the quarrel between the father and the son had been complete , Lord Brentford had said a word to his daughter , - merely a word , - of his son in connection with Miss Effingham . "
44609	44642	44603	44603	You	1696	" That had been the first word . He had just then resolved that the affair in Paris should be regarded as condoned , - as among the things to be forgotten . "
44661	44780	44656	44656	him	1695	" That had been the second word , and had been spoken immediately subsequent to a payment of twelve thousand pounds made by the Earl towards the settlement of certain Doncaster accounts . Lady Laura in negotiating for the money had been very eloquent in describing some honest , - or shall we say chivalric , - sacrifice which had brought her brother into this special difficulty . Since that the Earl had declined to interest himself in his son 's matrimonial affairs ; and when Lady Laura had once again mentioned the matter , declaring her belief that it would be the means of saving her brother Oswald , the Earl had desired her to be silent . "
44790	44990	44782	44782	you	1698	" he had said . Nevertheless Lady Laura felt sure that if she were to go to her father with a positive statement that Oswald and Violet were engaged , he would relent and would accept Violet as his daughter . As for the payment of Lord Chiltern 's present debts ; - she had a little scheme of her own about that . Miss Effingham , who had been already two days in Portman Square , had not as yet seen Lord Chiltern . She knew that he lived in the house , that is , that he slept there , and probably eat his breakfast in some apartment of his own ; - but she knew also that the habits of the house would not by any means make it necessary that they should meet . Laura and her brother probably saw each other daily , - but they never went into society together , and did not know the same sets of people . When she had announced to Lady Baldock her intention of spending the first fortnight of her London season with her friend Lady Laura , Lady Baldock had as a matter of course - "
44995	45004	44782	44782	you	1698	" as Miss Effingham would herself call it . "
45019	45024	45005	45005	You	1701	" said Lady Baldock . "
45039	45040	45028	45031	dear old Lord Brentford	332	" "
45057	45058	45043	45044	Lord Chiltern	463	" "
45066	45067	45064	45064	aunt	1705	" "
45121	45122	45113	45113	His	463	" "
45132	45173	45126	45126	you	1701	" Lady Baldock 's process of jumping upon her niece , - in which I think the aunt had generally the worst of the exercise , - went on for some time , but Violet of course carried her point . "
45186	45195	45196	45196	She	1708	" said Lady Baldock to her daughter Augusta . "
45205	45209	45203	45203	mamma	1709	" said Augusta . "
45221	45227	45214	45214	she	1708	" said Lady Baldock ; - "
45247	45290	45243	45243	I	0	" Lord Chiltern was now in the room with Violet , - immediately upon that conversation between Violet and his sister as to the expediency of Violet becoming his wife . Indeed his entrance had interrupted the conversation before it was over . "
45302	45306	45291	45291	I	0	" he said . "
45317	45318	45312	45312	I	0	" "
45328	45346	45320	45320	I	0	" she said , getting up from her corner on the sofa and giving him her hand . "
45374	45542	45349	45349	I	0	" She could not help looking , first at his eye and then at his hand , not as wanting evidence to the truth of the statement which his sister had made , but because the idea of a drunkard 's eye and a drunkard 's hand had been brought before her mind . Lord Chiltern 's hand was like the hand of any other man , but there was something in his eye that almost frightened her . It looked as though he would not hesitate to wring his wife 's neck round , if ever he should be brought to threaten to do so . And then his eye , like the rest of him , was red . No ; - she did not think that she could ever bring herself to marry him . Why take a venture that was double - dangerous , when there were so many ventures open to her , apparently with very little of danger attached to them ? "
45562	45568	45554	45554	I	0	" she said to herself . "
45588	45595	45579	45579	I	0	" said he , seating himself . "
45616	45617	45618	45618	We	1715	" "
45627	45633	45618	45618	We	1715	" said she , laughing . "
45649	45650	45637	45638	Lady Baldock	341	" "
45664	45665	45651	45652	The servants	1717	" "
45678	45679	45680	45680	I	0	" "
45693	45698	45700	45700	he	516	" said Lady Laura . "
45730	45731	45732	45732	I	0	" "

45817	45821	45796	45796	People	1124	" said Violet , "

46000	46004	45987	45988	my aunt	1575	" he said . "
46011	46028	46009	46009	Oswald	516	" asked his sister . He passed his hand over his face before he answered her . "

46413	46510	46409	46410	Lord Chiltern	463	" said Miss Effingham , rising also to her feet , and then pausing , not knowing how to answer him . There had been a suddenness in his mode of addressing her which had , so to say , almost taken away her breath ; and then to be told by a man of his love before his sister was in itself , to her , a matter so surprising , that none of those words came at her command which will come , as though by instinct , to young ladies on such occasions . "
46517	46529	46511	46511	You	0	" said he , as though he were angry with her . "
46533	46537	46530	46531	Lord Chiltern	463	" she replied , "

46596	46601	46585	46585	He	463	" said Lady Laura . "
46660	46670	46673	46673	you	463	" Then she got up and left the room . "
46687	46706	46673	46673	you	463	" said his sister , coming up to him and taking him by the arm almost in anger . "
46713	46717	46718	46718	She	1746	" said he . "
46725	46726	46718	46718	She	1746	" "

46909	47415	46905	46905	her	1746	" said Lord Chiltern , looking his sister full in the face . Then he turned upon his heel and left her . CHAPTER XII Autumnal Prospects The session went on very calmly after the opening battle which ousted Lord de Terrier and sent Mr. Mildmay back to the Treasury , - so calmly that Phineas Finn was unconsciously disappointed , as lacking that excitement of contest to which he had been introduced in the first days of his parliamentary career . From time to time certain waspish attacks were made by Mr. Daubeny , now on this Secretary of State and now on that ; but they were felt by both parties to mean nothing ; and as no great measure was brought forward , nothing which would serve by the magnitude of its interests to divide the liberal side of the House into fractions , Mr. Mildmay 's Cabinet was allowed to hold its own in comparative peace and quiet . It was now July , - the middle of July , - and the member for Loughshane had not yet addressed the House . How often had he meditated doing so ; how he had composed his speeches walking round the Park on his way down to the House ; how he got his subjects up , - only to find on hearing them discussed that he really knew little or nothing about them ; how he had his arguments and almost his very words taken out of his mouth by some other member ; and lastly , how he had actually been deterred from getting upon his legs by a certain tremor of blood round his heart when the moment for rising had come , - of all this he never said a word to any man . Since that last journey to county Mayo , Laurence Fitzgibbon had been his most intimate friend , but he said nothing of all this even to Laurence Fitzgibbon . To his other friend , Lady Laura Standish , he did explain something of his feelings , not absolutely describing to her the extent of hindrance to which his modesty had subjected him , but letting her know that he had his qualms as well as his aspirations . But as Lady Laura always recommended patience , and more than once expressed her opinion that a young member would be better to sit in silence at least for one session , he was not driven to the mortification of feeling that he was incurring her contempt by his bashfulness . As regarded the men among whom he lived , I think he was almost annoyed at finding that no one seemed to expect that he should speak . Barrington Erle , when he had first talked of sending Phineas down to Loughshane , had predicted for him all manner of parliamentary successes , and had expressed the warmest admiration of the manner in which Phineas had discussed this or that subject at the Union . "
47435	47745	47746	47746	I	0	" Barrington Erle had once said . But now no allusions whatever were made to his powers of speech , and Phineas in his modest moments began to be more amazed than ever that he should find himself seated in that chamber . To the forms and technicalities of parliamentary business he did give close attention , and was unremitting in his attendance . On one or two occasions he ventured to ask a question of the Speaker , and as the words of experience fell into his ears , he would tell himself that he was going through his education , - that he was learning to be a working member , and perhaps to be a statesman . But his regrets with reference to Mr. Low and the dingy chambers in Old Square were very frequent ; and had it been possible for him to undo all that he had done , he would often have abandoned to some one else the honour of representing the electors of Loughshane . But he was supported in all his difficulties by the kindness of his friend , Lady Laura Standish . He was often in the house in Portman Square , and was always received with cordiality , and , as he thought , almost with affection . She would sit and talk to him , sometimes saying a word about her brother and sometimes about her father , as though there were more between them than the casual intimacy of London acquaintance . And in Portman Square he had been introduced to Miss Effingham , and had found Miss Effingham to be - very nice . Miss Effingham had quite taken to him , and he had danced with her at two or three parties , talking always , as he did so , about Lady Laura Standish . "
47763	47772	47755	47756	Mr. Finn	329	" said Violet to Lady Laura one night . "
47811	47812	47806	47806	he	329	" "
47818	47822	47806	47806	he	329	" said Violet . "
47833	47838	47823	47823	I	0	" said Lady Laura . "
47853	47854	47844	47845	a man	749	" "
47863	47868	47855	47856	Mr. Finn	329	" said Lady Laura . "
47875	47879	47880	47880	I	0	" said Violet . "
47889	47890	47855	47856	Mr. Finn	329	" "
47899	47900	47855	47856	Mr. Finn	329	" "
47936	47937	47933	47934	an heiress	8137	" "
47948	48011	47944	47946	a bad husband	1761	" said Lady Laura Standish . Phineas during the summer had very often met Mr. Kennedy . They sat on the same side of the House , they belonged to the same club , they dined together more than once in Portman Square , and on one occasion Phineas had accepted an invitation to dinner sent to him by Mr. Kennedy himself . "
48022	48030	48015	48015	I	0	" he said afterwards to Laurence Fitzgibbon . "
48052	48053	48044	48044	they	1762	" "
48064	48068	48060	48060	I	0	" said Fitzgibbon , "
48082	48594	48071	48071	me	0	" In spite , however , of all these opportunities for intimacy , now , nearly at the end of the session , Phineas had hardly spoken a dozen words to Mr. Kennedy , and really knew nothing whatsoever of the man , as one friend , - or even as one acquaintance knows another . Lady Laura had desired him to be on good terms with Mr. Kennedy , and for that reason he had dined with him . Nevertheless he disliked Mr. Kennedy , and felt quite sure that Mr. Kennedy disliked him . He was therefore rather surprised when he received the following note : - Albany , Z 3 , July 17 , 186 - . MY DEAR MR . FINN , I shall have some friends at Loughlinter next month , and should be very glad if you will join us . I will name the 16th August . I do n't know whether you shoot , but there are grouse and deer . Yours truly , ROBERT KENNEDY . What was he to do ? He had already begun to feel rather uncomfortable at the prospect of being separated from all his new friends as soon as the session should be over . Laurence Fitzgibhon had asked him to make another visit to county Mayo , but that he had declined . Lady Laura had said something to him about going abroad with her brother , and since that there had sprung up a sort of intimacy between him and Lord Chiltern ; but nothing had been fixed about this foreign trip , and there were pecuniary objections to it which put it almost out of his power . The Christmas holidays he would of course pass with his family at Killaloe , but he hardly liked the idea of hurrying off to Killaloe immediately the session should be over . Everybody around him seemed to be looking forward to pleasant leisure doings in the country . Men talked about grouse , and of the ladies at the houses to which they were going and of the people whom they were to meet . Lady Laura had said nothing of her own movements for the early autumn , and no invitation had come to him to go to the Earl 's country house . He had already felt that every one would depart and that he would be left , - and this had made him uncomfortable . What was he to do with the invitation from Mr. Kennedy ? He disliked the man , and had told himself half a dozen times that he despised him . Of course he must refuse it . Even for the sake of the scenery , and the grouse , and the pleasant party , and the feeling that going to Loughlinter in August would be the proper sort of thing to do , he must refuse it ! But it occurred to him at last that he would call in Portman Square before he wrote his note . "
48601	48612	48071	48071	me	0	" said Lady Laura , in her most decided tone . "
48616	48617	48071	48071	me	0	" "
48640	48641	48634	48634	you	1763	" "
48654	48658	48634	48634	you	1763	" said Phineas . "
48663	48668	48659	48659	We	1766	" said Lady Laura , "
48740	48799	48800	48800	Yours	1772	" Of course he did go . The note accepting Mr. Kennedy 's invitation was written at the Reform Club within a quarter of an hour of his leaving Portman Square . He was very careful in writing to be not more familiar or more civil than Mr. Kennedy had been to himself , and then he signed himself "
48806	48832	48800	48800	Yours	1772	" But another proposition was made to him , and a most charming proposition , during the few minutes that he remained in Portman Square . "
48838	48843	48800	48800	Yours	1772	" said Lady Laura , "
48905	48931	49057	49057	George	370	" Phineas swore that he would have gone if it had been but for one hour , and if Saulsby had been twice the distance . "
48975	49055	48964	48965	Mr. Finn	329	" Phineas declared that he did not care a straw for grouse . There was another little occurrence which happened before Phineas left London , and which was not altogether so charming as his prospects at Saulsby and Loughlinter . Early in August , when the session was still incomplete , he dined with Laurence Fitzgibbon at the Reform Club . Laurence had specially invited him to do so , and made very much of him on the occasion . "
49063	49071	49057	49057	George	370	" Laurence said to him that morning , "
49188	49273	49175	49175	Your	1281	" Phineas , who really liked his friend Laurence , expressed himself very warmly in answer to this , and became affectionate , and made sundry protestations of friendship which were perfectly sincere . Their sincerity was tested after dinner , when Fitzgibbon , as they two were seated on a sofa in the corner of the smoking - room , asked Phineas to put his name to the back of a bill for two hundred and fifty pounds at six months ' date . "
49280	49284	49175	49175	Your	1281	" said Phineas , "
49300	49301	49304	49306	my dear boy	7269	" "
49339	49340	49318	49318	D'ye	1787	" "
49350	49351	49374	49374	d'ye	1787	" "
49443	49485	49429	49429	I	0	" Then Phineas Finn with many misgivings , with much inward hatred of himself for his own weakness , did put his name on the back of the bill which Laurence Fitzgibbon had prepared for his signature . CHAPTER XIII Saulsby Wood "
49495	49503	49487	49487	you	7269	" said Laurence Fitzgibbon to his friend . "
49521	49522	49510	49511	Your father	1238	" "
49543	49544	49527	49528	my father	7296	" "
49555	49556	49527	49528	my father	7296	" "
49570	49571	49572	49572	I	0	" "
49596	49597	49598	49598	I	0	" "

49676	49677	49680	49680	you	0	" "
49773	50056	49764	49764	I	0	" Phineas was rather unhappy about the bill ; but there was so much that was pleasant in his cup at the present moment , that he resolved , as far as possible , to ignore the bitter of that one ingredient . He was a little in the dark as to two or three matters respecting these coming visits . He would have liked to have taken a servant with him ; but he had no servant , and felt ashamed to hire one for the occasion . And then he was in trouble about a gun , and the paraphernalia of shooting . He was not a bad shot at snipe in the bogs of county Clare , but he had never even seen a gun used in England . However , he bought himself a gun , - with other paraphernalia , and took a license for himself , and then groaned over the expense to which he found that his journey would subject him . And at last he hired a servant for the occasion . He was intensely ashamed of himself when he had done so , hating himself , and telling himself that he was going to the devil headlong . And why had he done it ? Not that Lady Laura would like him the better , or that she would care whether he had a servant or not . She probably would know nothing of his servant . But the people about her would know , and he was foolishly anxious that the people about her should think that he was worthy of her . Then he called on Mr. Low before he started . "
50068	50072	50057	50057	I	0	" he said ; "
50086	50087	50076	50076	you	1807	" "
50112	50113	50110	50110	myself	0	" "
50122	50126	50114	50115	Any fool	1808	" said Phineas . "
50207	50235	50196	50196	you	1807	" Mrs. Bunce was delighted when she found that Phineas had hired a servant ; but Mr. Bunce predicted nothing but evil from so vain an expense . "
50269	50282	50196	50196	you	1807	" - whereby Mr. Bunce , I fear , meant empty , - "
50298	50299	50288	50289	a man	749	" "
50314	50335	50308	50312	the lords in the Cabinet	1814	" said Mrs. Bunce , to whom Phineas , in his pride , had confided perhaps more than was necessary . "
50340	50344	50308	50312	the lords in the Cabinet	1814	" said Bunce ; "
50390	50467	50376	50376	He	0	" Phineas found that the house was full at Saulsby , although the sojourn of the visitors would necessarily be so short . There were three or four there on their way on to Loughlinter , like himself , - Mr. Bonteen and Mr. Ratler , with Mr. Palliser , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and his wife , - and there was Violet Effingham , who , however , was not going to Loughlinter . "
50472	50494	50376	50376	He	0	" she said to our hero , who on the first evening had the pleasure of taking her in to dinner , "
50511	50512	50513	50514	Lady Laura	396	" "
50518	50519	50513	50514	Lady Laura	396	" "
50547	50548	50541	50541	you	1819	" "
50561	50565	50549	50549	I	0	" said Phineas . "
50575	50579	50567	50567	you	1819	" said Violet , "
50685	50805	50676	50677	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Why on earth had Mr. Kennedy invited him , Phineas Finn , to meet four Cabinet Ministers and Lady Glencora Palliser ? He could only have done so at the instance of Lady Laura Standish . It was delightful for Phineas to think that Lady Laura cared for him so deeply ; but it was not equally delightful when he remembered how very close must be the alliance between Mr. Kennedy and Lady Laura , when she was thus powerful with him . At Saulsby Phineas did not see much of his hostess . When they were making their plans for the one entire day of this visit , she said a soft word of apology to him . "
50865	50866	50856	50856	you	1830	" "
50888	50991	50884	50886	an inveterate sportsman	1833	" On that one day there was a great riding party made up , and Phineas found himself mounted , after luncheon , with some dozen other equestrians . Among them were Miss Effingham and Lady Glencora , Mr. Ratler and the Earl of Brentford himself . Lady Glencora , whose husband was , as has been said , Chancellor of the Exchequer , and who was still a young woman , and a very pretty woman , had taken lately very strongly to politics , which she discussed among men and women of both parties with something more than ordinary audacity . "
51011	51018	51000	51000	you	0	" said she to the Earl . "
51029	51034	51019	51019	I	0	" said the Earl . "

51203	51230	51192	51193	Mr. Mildmay	334	" said Lady Glencora . They were now riding through a vast wood , and Phineas found himself delightfully established by the side of Violet Effingham . "

51881	51945	51946	51946	He	463	" Phineas had no idea how deep an injury he might be doing his friend by this description , nor did it once occur to him that his companion was thinking of herself as the possible wife of this Red Indian . Miss Effingham rode on in silence for some distance , and then she said but one word more about Lord Chiltern . "
51956	52079	51946	51946	He	463	" On the following day the party at Saulsby was broken up , and there was a regular pilgrimage towards Loughlinter . Phineas resolved upon sleeping a night at Edinburgh on his way , and he found himself joined in the bands of close companionship with Mr. Ratler for the occasion . The evening was by no means thrown away , for he learned much of his trade from Mr. Ratler . And Mr. Ratler was heard to declare afterwards at Loughlinter that Mr. Finn was a pleasant young man . It soon came to be admitted by all who knew Phineas Finn that he had a peculiar power of making himself agreeable which no one knew how to analyse or define . "
52090	52095	52085	52085	he	1862	" said one man . "
52106	52110	52097	52098	the women	1863	" said another . "
52122	52216	52111	52111	He	1862	" said a third . The truth , however , was , that Phineas Finn had made no study in the matter at all . It was simply his nature to be pleasant . CHAPTER XIV Loughlinter Phineas Finn reached Loughlinter together with Mr. Ratler in a post - chaise from the neighbouring town . Mr. Ratler , who had done this kind of thing very often before , travelled without impediments , but the new servant of our hero 's was stuck outside with the driver , and was in the way . "
52225	52234	52217	52217	I	0	" said Mr. Ratler to his young friend . "
52267	52301	52217	52217	I	0	" Phineas blushed as he heard all this ; but there was the impediment , not to be got rid of for the nonce , and Phineas made the best of his attendant . "
52309	52313	52217	52217	I	0	" said he , "
52351	52352	52353	52353	I	0	" "
52366	52644	52353	52353	I	0	" said Mr. Ratler . Loughlinter , as they approached it , seemed to Phineas to be a much finer place than Saulsby . And so it was , except that Loughlinter wanted that graceful beauty of age which Saulsby possessed . Loughlinter was all of cut stone , but the stones had been cut only yesterday . It stood on a gentle slope , with a greensward falling from the front entrance down to a mountain lake . And on the other side of the Lough there rose a mighty mountain to the skies , Ben Linter . At the foot of it , and all round to the left , there ran the woods of Linter , stretching for miles through crags and bogs and mountain lands . No better ground for deer than the side of Ben Linter was there in all those highlands . And the Linter , rushing down into the Lough through rocks which , in some places , almost met together above its waters , ran so near to the house that the pleasant noise of its cataracts could be heard from the hall door . Behind the house the expanse of drained park land seemed to be interminable ; and then , again , came the mountains . There were Ben Linn and Ben Lody ; - and the whole territory belonging to Mr. Kennedy . He was laird of Linn and laird of Linter , as his people used to say . And yet his father had walked into Glasgow as a little boy , - no doubt with the normal half - crown in his breeches pocket . "
52652	52670	52353	52353	I	0	" said Phineas to the Treasury Secretary , as they were being driven up to the door . "
52700	52975	52693	52693	he	1871	" Phineas , at the moment , was thinking how far all these things which he saw , the mountains stretching everywhere around him , the castle , the lake , the river , the wealth of it all , and , more than the wealth , the nobility of the beauty , might act as temptations to Lady Laura Standish . If a woman were asked to have the half of all this , would it be possible that she should prefer to take the half of his nothing ? He thought it might be possible for a girl who would confess , or seem to confess , that love should be everything . But it could hardly be possible for a woman who looked at the world almost as a man looked at it , - as an oyster to be opened with such weapon as she could find ready to her hand . Lady Laura professed to have a care for all the affairs of the world . She loved politics , and could talk of social science , and had broad ideas about religion , and was devoted to certain educational views . Such a woman would feel that wealth was necessary to her , and would be willing , for the sake of wealth , to put up with a husband without romance . Nay ; might it not be that she would prefer a husband without romance ? Thus Phineas was arguing to himself as he was driven up to the door of Loughlinter Castle , while Mr. Ratler was eloquent on the beauty of old park trees . "
52990	53504	53505	53505	You	1874	" said Mr. Ratler . There was nobody in the house , - at least , they found nobody ; and within half an hour Phineas was walking about the grounds by himself . Mr. Ratler had declared himself to be delighted at having an opportunity of writing letters , - and no doubt was writing them by the dozen , all dated from Loughlinter , and all detailing the facts that Mr. Gresham , and Mr. Monk , and Plantagenet Palliser , and Lord Brentford were in the same house with him . Phineas had no letters to write , and therefore rushed down across the broad lawn to the river , of which he heard the noisy tumbling waters . There was something in the air which immediately filled him with high spirits ; and , in his desire to investigate the glories of the place , he forgot that he was going to dine with four Cabinet Ministers in a row . He soon reached the stream , and began to make his way up it through the ravine . There was waterfall over waterfall , and there were little bridges here and there which looked to be half natural and half artificial , and a path which required that you should climb , but which was yet a path , and all was so arranged that not a pleasant splashing rush of the waters was lost to the visitor . He went on and on , up the stream , till there was a sharp turn in the ravine , and then , looking upwards , he saw above his head a man and a woman standing together on one of the little half - made wooden bridges . His eyes were sharp , and he saw at a glance that the woman was Lady Laura Standish . He had not recognised the man , but he had very little doubt that it was Mr. Kennedy . Of course it was Mr. Kennedy , because he would prefer that it should be any other man under the sun . He would have turned back at once if he had thought that he could have done so without being observed ; but he felt sure that , standing as they were , they must have observed him . He did not like to join them . He would not intrude himself . So he remained still , and began to throw stones into the river . But he had not thrown above a stone or two when he was called from above . He looked up , and then he perceived that the man who called him was his host . Of course it was Mr. Kennedy . Thereupon he ceased to throw stones , and went up the path , and joined them upon the bridge . Mr. Kennedy stepped forward , and bade him welcome to Loughlinter . His manner was less cold , and he seemed to have more words at command than was usual with him . "
53511	53515	53505	53505	You	1874	" he said , "
53527	53528	53505	53505	You	1874	" "
53534	53538	53505	53505	You	1874	" said Laura . "
53557	53558	53549	53550	Mr. Kennedy	404	" "
53564	53568	53549	53550	Mr. Kennedy	404	" said Phineas . "

53627	53645	53621	53621	he	404	" said Phineas to himself , thinking how glorious it was to be only twenty - five . "
53651	53656	53621	53621	he	404	" continued Mr. Kennedy , "
53671	53672	53663	53666	the stone - cutters	1881	" "
53685	53690	53691	53691	He	1238	" said Lady Laura . "
53748	53843	53743	53744	Ben Linn	478	" Lady Laura declared that she would go as much higher as he chose to take her , and Phineas was rather in doubt as to what it would become him to do . He would stay where he was , or go down , or make himself to vanish after any most acceptable fashion ; but if he were to do so abruptly it would seem as though he were attributing something special to the companionship of the other two . Mr. Kennedy saw his doubt , and asked him to join them . "
53893	53894	53898	53898	them	1887	" "
53903	53954	53900	53901	Mr. Kennedy	404	" said Lady Laura . Then they went on with their walk very pleasantly , and the lord of all that they surveyed took them from one point of vantage to another , till they both swore that of all spots upon the earth Loughlinter was surely the most lovely . "
53964	53969	53955	53955	I	0	" said the lord . "
54056	54086	54087	54087	I	0	" Mr. Kennedy had now spoken more words than Phineas had heard to fall from his lips during the whole time that they had been acquainted with each other . "

54146	54237	54238	54239	Mr. Finn	329	" said Mr. Kennedy . He took them up out of the ravine on to the side of the mountain , and then down by another path through the woods to the back of the house . As they went he relapsed into his usual silence , and the conversation was kept up between the other two . At a point not very far from the castle , - just so far that one could see by the break of the ground where the castle stood , Kennedy left them . "
54251	54255	54247	54247	I	0	" said he , "

54325	54351	54312	54312	you	404	" Mr. Kennedy , owning that it was so , went away to his farm , and Phineas with Lady Laura returned towards the house . "

55477	55516	55466	55466	Fitzgibbons	493	" When I think of my father and of the old house at Killaloe , and remember that hitherto I have done nothing myself , I can not understand how it is that I should be at Loughlinter . "
55748	55755	55757	55758	Lady Glencora	475	" I believe , Mr. Monk , "
55760	55782	55757	55758	Lady Glencora	475	" that you and I are the only two in the whole party who really know what we would be at . "
55783	55796	55798	55799	Mr. Monk	346	" If I must be divided from so many of my friends , "
55801	55816	55798	55799	Mr. Monk	346	" I am happy to go astray in the company of Lady Glencora Palliser . "
55817	55823	55825	55826	Mr. Gresham	431	" And might I ask , "
55838	55851	55825	55826	Mr. Gresham	431	" what it is that you and Mr. Monk are really at ? "
55852	55860	55862	55863	Lady Glencora	475	" Making men and women all equal , "
55865	55878	55862	55863	Lady Glencora	475	" That I take to be the gist of our political theory . "
55879	55888	55890	55891	Mr. Monk	346	" Lady Glencora , I must cry off , "
55893	55929	55890	55891	Mr. Monk	346	" Yes ; - no doubt . If I were in the Cabinet myself I should not admit so much . There are reticences , - of course . And there is an official discretion . "
55930	55949	55951	55952	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" But you do n't mean to say , Lady Glencora , that you would really advocate equality ? "
55954	55999	55951	55952	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" I do mean to say so , Mrs. Bonteen . And I mean to go further , and to tell you that you are no Liberal at heart unless you do so likewise ; unless that is the basis of your political aspirations . "
56000	56011	55862	55863	Lady Glencora	475	" Pray let me speak for myself , Lady Glencora . "
56012	56039	55862	55863	Lady Glencora	475	" By no means , - not when you are criticising me and my politics . Do you not wish to make the lower orders comfortable ? "
56040	56043	56045	56046	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" Certainly , "
56048	56057	56045	56046	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" And educated , and happy and good ? "
56058	56061	55862	55863	Lady Glencora	475	" Undoubtedly . "
56062	56074	55862	55863	Lady Glencora	475	" To make them as comfortable and as good as yourself ? "
56075	56080	56045	56046	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" Better if possible . "
56081	56117	55862	55863	Lady Glencora	475	" And I 'm sure you wish to make yourself as good and as comfortable as anybody else , - as those above you , if anybody is above you ? You will admit that ? "
56118	56127	55862	55863	Lady Glencora	475	" Yes ; - if I understand you . "
56128	56170	55862	55863	Lady Glencora	475	" Then you have admitted everything , and are an advocate for general equality , - just as Mr. Monk is , and as I am . There is no getting out of it ; - is there , Mr. Kennedy ? "
56201	56236	56193	56193	she	407	" You will understand me . I am not saying that people are equal ; but that the tendency of all law - making and of all governing should be to reduce the inequalities . "
56580	56592	56593	56594	Mr. Monk	346	" Lady Glencora was not so far wrong the other night , "
56599	56674	56593	56594	Mr. Monk	346	" Equality is an ugly word and should n't be used . It misleads , and frightens , and is a bugbear . And she , in using it , had not perhaps a clearly defined meaning for it in her own mind . But the wish of every honest man should be to assist in lifting up those below him , till they be something nearer his own level than he finds them . "
57061	57122	57051	57052	Laurence Fitzgibbon	391	" A man who can vote hard , as I call it ; and who will speak a few words now and then as they 're wanted , without any ambition that way , may always have his price . And if he has a pretty wife into the bargain , he ought to have a pleasant time of it . "
57160	57169	57170	57170	he	329	" If I got as high as that , "
57175	57208	57170	57170	he	329	" I should think myself a miracle of luck . And yet nobody seems to think anything of Ratler . It is all nothing unless one can go to the very top . "
57209	57219	57220	57221	Mr. Monk	346	" I believe I did right to accept office , "
57246	57351	57220	57221	Mr. Monk	346	" Indeed , unless a man does so when the bonds of the office tendered to him are made compatible with his own views , he declines to proceed on the open path towards the prosecution of those views . A man who is combating one ministry after another , and striving to imbue those ministers with his convictions , can hardly decline to become a minister himself when he finds that those convictions of his own are henceforth , - or at least for some time to come , - to be the ministerial convictions of the day . Do you follow me ? "
57352	57356	57358	57358	Phineas	329	" Very clearly , "
57360	57372	57220	57221	Mr. Monk	346	" You would have denied your own children had you refused . "
57373	57577	57220	57221	Mr. Monk	346	" Unless indeed a man were to feel that he was in some way unfitted for office work . I very nearly provided for myself an escape on that plea ; - but when I came to sift it , I thought that it would be false . But let me tell you that the delight of political life is altogether in opposition . Why , it is freedom against slavery , fire against clay , movement against stagnation ! The very inaccuracy which is permitted to opposition is in itself a charm worth more than all the patronage and all the prestige of ministerial power . You 'll try them both , and then say if you do not agree with me . Give me the full swing of the benches below the gangway , where I needed to care for no one , and could always enjoy myself on my legs as long as I felt that I was true to those who sent me there ! That is all over now . They have got me into harness , and my shoulders are sore . The oats , however , are of the best , and the hay is unexceptionable . "
57749	57759	57761	57761	he	329	" I 've just got that from your brother , "
57763	57793	57761	57761	he	329	" How like Oswald . He writes to me perhaps three times in the year , and his letters are just the same . You will go I hope ? "
57794	57800	57708	57708	Yours	357	" Well ; - no . "
57801	57808	57761	57761	he	329	" I am sorry for that . "
57809	57824	57761	57761	he	329	" I wonder whether I may tell you the real reason , Lady Laura . "
57825	57854	57708	57708	Yours	357	" Nay ; - I can not answer that ; but unless it be some political secret between you and Mr. Monk , I should think you might . "
57855	57888	57761	57761	he	329	" I can not afford to go to Paris this autumn . It seems to be a shocking admission to make , - though I do n't know why it should be . "
57889	57957	57761	57761	he	329	" Nor I ; - but , Mr. Finn , I like you all the better for making it . I am very sorry , for Oswald 's sake . It 's so hard to find any companion for him whom he would like and whom we , - that is I , - should think altogether - ; you know what I mean , Mr. Finn . "
57958	58014	58021	58021	his	2001	" Your wish that I should go with him is a great compliment , and I thoroughly wish that I could do it . As it is , I must go to Killaloe and retrieve my finances . I daresay , Lady Laura , you can hardly conceive how very poor a man I am . "
58072	58094	58095	58095	she	2002	" You must climb into office early , and forego those pleasures of opposition which are so dear to Mr. Monk , "
58100	58135	58095	58095	she	2002	" After all , money is an accident which does not count nearly so high as do some other things . You and Mr. Kennedy have the same enjoyment of everything around you here . "
58136	58143	58095	58095	she	2002	" Yes ; while it lasts . "
58144	58221	58227	58227	she	2002	" And Lady Glencora and I stand pretty much on the same footing , in spite of all her wealth , - except that she is a married woman . I do not know what she is worth , - something not to be counted ; and I am worth , - just what papa chooses to give me . A ten - pound note at the present moment I should look upon as great riches . "
58583	58592	58593	58593	she	396	" But you will be shooting all day , "
58646	58679	58641	58642	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I will undertake to be back in time , if you will not think it too hot . I shall not see you again till we meet in town next year . "
58680	58719	58634	58638	one of the shooting party	2013	" Then I certainly will go with you , - that is to say , if you are here . But you can not return without the rest of the party , as you are going so far . "
58720	58727	58729	58729	Phineas	329	" I 'll get back somehow , "
58759	58771	58729	58729	Phineas	329	" If we start at five that will be early enough . "
58772	58777	58779	58780	Lady Laura	396	" Quite early enough , "
58824	58834	58836	58837	Mr. Bonteen	408	" I 'll tell you what I 'll do , "
58839	58857	58836	58837	Mr. Bonteen	408	" I 'll back myself for the rest of the day for a ten - pound note . "
58908	58918	58920	58920	Phineas	329	" I should not think of shooting for money , "
58922	58938	58920	58920	Phineas	329	" And why not ? A bet is the only way to decide these things . "
58939	58952	58954	58954	Phineas	329	" Partly because I 'm sure I should n't hit a bird , "
58956	58969	58954	58954	Phineas	329	" and partly because I have n't got any money to lose . "
58970	58975	58977	58978	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I hate bets , "
58983	59005	58977	58978	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I was annoyed when Bonteen offered the wager . I felt sure , however , you would not accept it . "
59006	59015	58920	58920	Phineas	329	" I suppose such bets are very common . "
59016	59098	58954	58954	Phineas	329	" I do n't think men ought to propose them unless they are quite sure of their company . Maybe I 'm wrong , and I often feel that I am strait - laced about such things . It is so odd to me that men can not amuse themselves without pitting themselves against each other . When a man tells me that he can shoot better than I , I tell him that my keeper can shoot better than he . "
59099	59112	59114	59114	Phineas	329	" All the same , it 's a good thing to excel , "
59116	59125	59127	59128	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I 'm not so sure of that , "
59130	59156	59127	59128	Mr. Kennedy	343	" A man who can kill more salmon than anybody else , can rarely do anything else . Are you going on with your match ? "
59157	59170	58954	58954	Phineas	329	" No ; I 'm going to make my way to Loughlinter . "
59171	59175	58954	58954	Phineas	329	" Not alone ? "
59176	59181	59127	59128	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Yes , alone . "
59182	59195	58954	58954	Phineas	329	" It 's over nine miles . You ca n't walk it . "
59243	59252	59254	59254	he	329	" I must do it all the same , "
59261	59293	59254	59254	he	329	" I have an engagement with Lady Laura Standish ; and as this is the last day that I shall see her , I certainly do not mean to break it . "
59294	59301	59303	59304	Mr. Kennedy	343	" An engagement with Lady Laura , "
59306	59349	59303	59304	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Why did you not tell me , that I might have a pony ready ? But come along . Donald Bean has a pony . He 's not much bigger than a dog , but he 'll carry you to Loughlinter . "
59350	59359	59254	59254	he	329	" I can walk it , Mr. Kennedy . "
59360	59380	59254	59254	he	329	" Yes ; and think of the state in which you 'd reach Loughlinter ! Come along with me . "
59381	59392	59394	59394	Phineas	329	" But I ca n't take you off the mountain , "
59396	59407	59394	59394	Phineas	329	" Then you must allow me to take you off . "
59449	59458	59462	59462	himself	329	" If Mr. Kennedy is really my rival , "
59469	59485	59462	59462	himself	329	" I almost think that I am doing an unhandsome thing in taking the pony . "
59972	59982	59984	59985	Lady Laura	396	" I did not expect you in the least , "
59987	59995	59984	59985	Lady Laura	396	" And yet I spoke very positively . "
59996	60032	59984	59985	Lady Laura	396	" But there are things as to which a man may be very positive , and yet may be allowed to fail . In the first place , how on earth did you get home ? "
60033	60047	59984	59985	Lady Laura	396	" Mr. Kennedy got me a pony , - Donald Bean 's pony . "
60048	60055	59984	59985	Lady Laura	396	" You told him , then ? "
60056	60108	59984	59985	Lady Laura	396	" Yes ; I told him why I was coming , and that I must be here . Then he took the trouble to come all the way off the mountain to persuade Donald to lend me his pony . I must acknowledge that Mr. Kennedy has conquered me at last . "
60109	60117	60119	60120	Lady Laura	396	" I am so glad of that , "
60122	60136	60119	60120	Lady Laura	396	" I knew he would , - unless it were your own fault . "
60408	60414	60415	60415	he	2049	" After all that climbing , "
60418	60428	60415	60415	he	2049	" will you not sit down for a moment ? "
60450	60458	60459	60459	he	2049	" Do sit down for one moment , "
60462	60480	60459	60459	he	2049	" I have something that I desire to say to you , and to say it here . "
60481	60485	60486	60486	she	396	" I will , "
60489	60520	60486	60486	she	396	" but I also have something to tell you , and will say it while I am yet standing . Yesterday I accepted an offer of marriage from Mr. Kennedy . "
60521	60528	60530	60530	Phineas	329	" Then I am too late , "
60766	60770	60771	60771	she	396	" Mr. Finn , "
60774	60784	60771	60771	she	396	" Well ; - yes : what is it ? "
60795	60843	60788	60788	he	329	" Will you not wish me joy , or say a word of congratulation ? Had I not thought much of your friendship , I should not have been so quick to tell you of my destiny . No one else has been told , except papa . "
60844	60867	60771	60771	she	396	" Of course I hope you will be happy . Of course I do . No wonder he lent me the pony ! "
60868	60875	60771	60771	she	396	" You must forget all that . "
60876	60880	60788	60788	he	329	" Forget what ? "
60881	60892	60894	60895	Lady Laura	396	" Well , - nothing . You need forget nothing , "
60897	60919	60894	60895	Lady Laura	396	" for nothing has been said that need be regretted . Only wish me joy , and all will be pleasant . "
60920	60957	60771	60771	she	396	" Lady Laura , I do wish you joy , with all my heart , - but that will not make all things pleasant . I came up here to ask you to be my wife . "
60958	60971	60771	60771	she	396	" No ; - no , no ; do not say it . "
60972	61062	60771	60771	she	396	" But I have said it , and will say it again . I , poor , penniless , plain simple fool that I am , have been ass enough to love you , Lady Laura Standish ; and I brought you up here to - day to ask you to share with me - my nothingness . And this I have done on soil that is to be all your own . Tell me that you regard me as a conceited fool , - as a bewildered idiot . "
61063	61084	61086	61086	she	2064	" I wish to regard you as a dear friend , - both of my own and of my husband , "
61093	61112	61086	61086	she	2064	" Should I have had a chance , I wonder , if I had spoken a week since ? "
61113	61270	60771	60771	she	396	" How can I answer such a question , Mr. Finn ? Or , rather , I will , answer it fully . It is not a week since we told each other , you to me and I to you , that we were both poor , - both without other means than those which come to us from our fathers . You will make your way ; - will make it surely ; but how at present could you marry any woman unless she had money of her own ? For me , - like so many other girls , it was necessary that I should stay at home or marry some one rich enough to dispense with fortune in a wife . The man whom in all the world I think the best has asked me to share everything with him ; - and I have thought it wise to accept his offer . "
61271	61284	61286	61286	Phineas	329	" And I was fool enough to think that you loved me , "
61296	61352	61290	61290	she	2066	" Yes , I was . I feel that I owe it you to tell you what a fool I have been . I did . I thought you loved me . At least I thought that perhaps you loved me . It was like a child wanting the moon ; - was it not ? "
61353	61363	61364	61364	she	2066	" And why should I not have loved you ? "
61376	61383	61364	61364	she	2066	" Why not ? Because Loughlinter - "
61384	61478	61290	61290	she	2066	" Stop , Mr. Finn ; stop . Do not say to me any unkind word that I have not deserved , and that would make a breach between us . I have accepted the owner of Loughlinter as my husband , because I verily believe that I shall thus do my duty in that sphere of life to which it has pleased God to call me . I have always liked him , and I will love him . For you , - may I trust myself to speak openly to you ? "
61479	61494	61290	61290	she	2066	" You may trust me as against all others , except us two ourselves . "
61495	61545	61364	61364	she	2066	" For you , then , I will say also that I have always liked you since I knew you ; that I have loved you as a friend ; - and could have loved you otherwise had not circumstances showed me so plainly that it would be unwise . "
61546	61552	61290	61290	she	2066	" Oh , Lady Laura ! "
61553	61669	61290	61290	she	2066	" Listen a moment . And pray remember that what I say to you now must never be repeated to any ears . No one knows it but my father , my brother , and Mr. Kennedy . Early in the spring I paid my brother 's debts . His affection to me is more than a return for what I have done for him . But when I did this , - when I made up my mind to do it , I made up my mind also that I could not allow myself the same freedom of choice which would otherwise have belonged to me . Will that be sufficient , Mr. Finn ? "
61670	61695	61364	61364	she	2066	" How can I answer you , Lady Laura ? Sufficient ! And you are not angry with me for what I have said ? "
61696	61731	61290	61290	she	2066	" No , I am not angry . But it is understood , of course , that nothing of this shall ever be repeated , - even among ourselves . Is that a bargain ? "
61732	61745	61290	61290	she	2066	" Oh , yes . I shall never speak of it again . "
61746	61755	61364	61364	she	2066	" And now you will wish me joy ? "
61756	61825	61290	61290	she	2066	" I have wished you joy , Lady Laura . And I will do so again . May you have every blessing which the world can give you . You can not expect me to be very jovial for awhile myself ; but there will be nobody to see my melancholy moods . I shall be hiding myself away in Ireland . When is the marriage to be ? "
61826	61888	61889	61889	Phineas	329	" Nothing has been said of that . I shall be guided by him , - but there must , of course , be delay . There will be settlements and I know not what . It may probably be in the spring , - or perhaps the summer . I shall do just what my betters tell me to do . "
62131	62138	62139	62139	she	2068	" Shall we go down now ? "
62142	62147	62139	62139	she	2068	" Oh , yes . "
62148	62158	62139	62139	she	2068	" You will not go on by the lake ? "
62159	62185	62139	62139	she	2068	" What is the use ? It is all the same now . You will want to be back to receive him in from shooting . "
62186	62242	62139	62139	she	2068	" Not that , I think . He is above those little cares . But it will be as well we should go the nearest way , as we have spent so much of our time here . I shall tell Mr. Kennedy that I have told you , - if you do not mind . "
62243	62250	62252	62252	Phineas	329	" Tell him what you please , "
62254	62309	62252	62252	Phineas	329	" But I wo n't have it taken in that way , Mr. Finn . Your brusque want of courtesy to me I have forgiven , but I shall expect you to make up for it by the alacrity of your congratulations to him . I will not have you uncourteous to Mr. Kennedy . "
62310	62321	62139	62139	she	2068	" If I have been uncourteous I beg your pardon . "
62322	62364	62365	62365	They	2075	" You need not do that . We are old friends , and may take the liberty of speaking plainly to each other ; - but you will owe it to Mr. Kennedy to be gracious . Think of the pony . "
62429	62448	62421	62421	he	329	" I must say good - bye to you . I shall be away early in the morning . "
62449	62459	62461	62462	Lady Laura	396	" Good - bye , and God bless you , "
62464	62470	62472	62472	he	329	" Give me your hand , "
62481	62495	62475	62475	she	396	" I do n't suppose you know what it is to love dearly . "
62496	62502	62421	62421	he	329	" I hope I do . "
62503	62561	62421	62421	he	329	" But to be in love ! I believe you do not . And to miss your love ! I think , - I am bound to think that you have never been so tormented . It is very sore ; - but I will do my best , like a man , to get over it . "
62562	62584	62421	62421	he	329	" Do , my friend , do . So small a trouble will never weigh heavily on shoulders such as yours . "
62585	62633	62637	62637	she	2080	" It will weigh very heavily , but I will struggle hard that it may not crush me . I have loved you so dearly ! As we are parting give me one kiss , that I may think of it and treasure it in my memory ! "
62775	62781	62783	62784	Mr. Kennedy	404	" Laura has told me , "
62786	62797	62783	62784	Mr. Kennedy	404	" that she has acquainted you with my good fortune . "
62798	62806	62808	62808	Phineas	396	" And I congratulate you most heartily , "
62816	62824	62808	62808	Phineas	396	" You are indeed a lucky fellow . "
62825	62833	62835	62836	Mr. Kennedy	404	" I feel myself to be so , "
62838	62907	62835	62836	Mr. Kennedy	404	" Such a wife was all that was wanting to me , and such a wife is very hard to find . Will you remember , Finn , that Loughlinter will never be so full but what there will be a room for you , or so empty but what you will be made welcome ? I say this on Lady Laura 's part and on my own . "
64024	64039	64040	64040	she	382	" We think it so good of you to come to see us again , "
64043	64053	64040	64040	she	382	" Good to come home to my own people ? "
64054	64070	64015	64015	she	382	" Of course you might be staying with plenty of grandees if you liked it . "
64071	64134	64040	64040	she	382	" No , indeed , Mary . It did happen by accident that I had to go to the house of a man whom perhaps you would call a grandee , and to meet grandees there . But it was only for a few days , and I am very glad to be taken in again here , I can assure you . "
64135	64148	64040	64040	she	382	" You know how very glad we all are to have you . "
64149	64159	64015	64015	she	382	" Are you glad to see me , Mary ? "
64160	64198	64040	64040	she	382	" Very glad . Why should I not be glad , and Barbara the dearest friend I have in the world ? Of course she talks about you , - and that makes me think of you . "
64199	64213	64015	64015	she	382	" If you knew , Mary , how often I think about you . "
64461	64475	64476	64476	he	329	" You must not be angry with me for not going to you , "
64493	64506	64476	64476	he	329	" but the fact is that my time is not my own . "
64507	64527	64529	64531	Mrs. Flood Jones	379	" Pray do n't make any apologies . We are quite aware that we have very little to offer , "
64559	64572	64573	64574	the mother	763	" Mary , you are a fool to think of that man , "
64583	64596	64573	64574	the mother	763	" I do n't think of him , mamma ; not particularly . "
64597	64619	64621	64623	Mrs. Flood Jones	379	" He is no better than anybody else that I can see , and he is beginning to give himself airs , "
64698	64709	64711	64712	the doctor	741	" I hope you find you get on pretty well , "
64722	64729	64731	64731	Phineas	329	" It 's a tight fit , "
64752	64762	64764	64765	the doctor	741	" I had hoped it would have been ample , "
64767	64782	64784	64784	Phineas	329	" Do n't think for a moment , sir , that I am complaining , "
64786	64801	64784	64784	Phineas	329	" I know it is much more than I have a right to expect . "
64843	64847	64848	64848	he	741	" I suppose , "
64855	64869	64848	64848	he	741	" there is no chance of your doing anything at the bar now ? "
64870	64885	64886	64887	Mr. Low	399	" Not immediately . It is almost impossible to combine the two studies together . "
64894	64909	64886	64887	Mr. Low	399	" But you are not to suppose that I have given the profession up . "
64910	64925	64886	64887	Mr. Low	399	" I hope not , - after all the money it has cost us . "
64926	64987	64886	64887	Mr. Low	399	" By no means , sir . And all that I am doing now will , I trust , be of assistance to me when I shall come back to work at the law . Of course it is on the cards that I may go into office , - and if so , public business will become my profession . "
64988	64997	64886	64887	Mr. Low	399	" And be turned out with the Ministry ! "
64998	65070	64886	64887	Mr. Low	399	" Yes ; that is true , sir . I must run my chance . If the worst comes to the worst , I hope I might be able to secure some permanent place . I should think that I can hardly fail to do so . But I trust I may never be driven to want it . I thought , however , that we had settled all this before . "
65090	65102	65104	65105	the doctor	741	" And in the mean time your money has been enough ? "
65111	65125	65127	65127	Phineas	329	" I had intended to ask you to advance me a hundred pounds , "
65129	65143	65127	65127	Phineas	329	" There were expenses to which I was driven on first entering Parliament . "
65144	65149	65104	65105	the doctor	741	" A hundred pounds . "
65150	65164	65165	65165	He	329	" If it be inconvenient , sir , I can do without it . "
65242	65251	65253	65254	the doctor	741	" You shall have it , of course , "
65256	65275	65253	65254	the doctor	741	" but do not let the necessity for asking for more hundreds come oftener than you can help . "
65624	65631	65632	65632	he	329	" Good - bye , Mary , "
65654	65663	65665	65665	Mary	382	" I know he can not help it , "
65669	65691	65665	65665	Mary	382	" It is his position . But whether it be for good or evil , I will be true to him . "
65692	65700	65701	65702	Babara Finn	498	" I am afraid you are unhappy , "
65711	65745	65701	65702	Babara Finn	498	" No ; I am not unhappy , - not at all . I have a deal to make me happy and proud . I do n't mean to be a bit unhappy . "
66308	66373	66279	66280	his wife	947	" If he means well , why did he go and stay with them lords down in Scotland ? I knows all about it . I knows a man when I sees him . Mr. Low , who 's looking out to be a Tory judge some of these days , is a deal better ; - because he knows what he 's after . "
66400	66411	66412	66413	Barrington Erle	364	" We 're going to begin in earnest this time , "
66421	66428	66430	66430	Phineas	329	" I am glad of that , "
66432	66444	66430	66430	Phineas	329	" I suppose you heard all about it down at Loughlinter ? "
66562	66569	66571	66571	Phineas	329	" I heard of nothing settled , "
66573	66585	66571	66571	Phineas	329	" but I suppose we are to have a Reform Bill . "
66586	66594	66618	66619	Barrington Erle	364	" That is a matter of course . "
66595	66609	66571	66571	Phineas	329	" And I suppose we are not to touch the question of ballot . "
66610	66616	66618	66619	Barrington Erle	364	" That 's the difficulty , "
66621	66654	66618	66619	Barrington Erle	364	" But of course we sha n't touch it as long as Mr. Mildmay is in the Cabinet . He will never consent to the ballot as First Minister of the Crown . "
66655	66663	66665	66665	Phineas	329	" Nor would Gresham , or Palliser , "
66680	66718	66665	66665	Phineas	329	" I do n't know about Gresham . It is impossible to say what Gresham might bring himself to do . Gresham is a man who may go any lengths before he has done . Planty Pall , "
66738	66750	66665	66665	Phineas	329	" would of course go with Mr. Mildmay and the Duke . "
66751	66760	66762	66762	Phineas	329	" And Monk is opposed to the ballot , "
66764	66822	66762	66762	Phineas	329	" Ah , that 's the question . No doubt he has assented to the proposition of a measure without the ballot ; but if there should come a row , and men like Turnbull demand it , and the London mob kick up a shindy , I do n't know how far Monk would be steady . "
66823	66833	66665	66665	Phineas	329	" Whatever he says , he 'll stick to . "
66834	66842	66844	66844	Barrington	364	" He is your leader , then ? "
66846	66881	66844	66844	Barrington	364	" I do n't know that I have a leader . Mr. Mildmay leads our side ; and if anybody leads me , he does . But I have great faith in Mr. Monk . "
66882	66903	66905	66906	Barrington Erle	364	" There 's one who would go for the ballot to - morrow , if it were brought forward stoutly , "
66922	66933	66935	66935	Ratler	417	" I do n't think much of that young man , "
67028	67033	67022	67022	he	364	" go for the ballot "
67340	67344	67346	67346	Fitzgibbon	391	" After all , "
67348	67414	67346	67346	Fitzgibbon	391	" this kind of thing means nothing . I know as well as possible , and so do you , what Mr. Mildmay will say , - and then Gresham will say a few words ; and then Turnbull will make a murmur , and then we shall all assent , - to anything or to nothing ; - and then it will be over . "
67712	67720	67721	67721	he	346	" I do n't give dinner parties , "
67724	67737	67721	67721	he	346	" but I should like you to come and meet Mr. Turnbull . "
67912	67925	67926	67926	she	396	" Here is a Darby and Joan meeting , is it not ? "
67957	67968	67935	67935	He	329	" I am very glad to find you both together . "
67969	67978	67980	67981	Lady Laura	396	" But Robert is going away this instant , "
67983	67994	67980	67981	Lady Laura	396	" Has he told you of our adventures at Rome ? "
67995	68000	67935	67935	He	329	" Not a word . "
68001	68038	67980	67981	Lady Laura	396	" Then I must tell you ; - but not now . The dear old Pope was so civil to us . I came to think it quite a pity that he should be in trouble . "
68039	68045	68047	68048	the husband	2242	" I must be off , "
68053	68065	68047	68048	the husband	2242	" But I shall meet you at dinner , I believe . "
68066	68075	67980	67981	Lady Laura	396	" Do you dine at Mr. Monk 's ? "
68076	68103	68047	68048	the husband	2242	" Yes , and am asked expressly to hear Turnbull make a convert of you . There are only to be us four . Au revoir . "
68185	68198	68174	68174	she	396	" Were you surprised at our suddenness when you got my note ? "
68199	68209	68614	68614	Phineas	396	" A little . You had spoken of waiting . "
68210	68255	68174	68174	she	396	" I had never imagined that he would have been impetuous . And he seems to think that even the business of getting himself married would not justify him staying away from Parliament . He is a rigid martinet in all matters of duty . "
68256	68275	68174	68174	she	396	" I did not wonder that he should be in a hurry , but that you should submit . "
68276	68329	68614	68614	Phineas	396	" I told you that I should do just what the wise people told me . I asked papa , and he said that it would be better . So the lawyers were driven out of their minds , and the milliners out of their bodies , and the thing was done . "
68330	68338	68614	68614	Phineas	396	" Who was there at the marriage ? "
68339	68390	68174	68174	she	396	" Oswald was not there . That I know is what you mean to ask . Papa said that he might come if he pleased . Oswald stipulated that he should be received as a son . Then my father spoke the hardest word that ever fell from his mouth . "
68391	68397	68174	68174	she	396	" What did he say ? "
68398	68452	68614	68614	Phineas	396	" I will not repeat it , - not altogether . But he said that Oswald was not entitled to a son 's treatment . He was very sore about my money , because Robert was so generous as to his settlement . So the breach between them is as wide as ever . "
68453	68460	68462	68462	Phineas	396	" And where is Chiltern now ? "
68464	68519	68462	68462	Phineas	396	" Down in Northamptonshire , staying at some inn from whence he hunts . He tells me that he is quite alone , - that he never dines out , never has any one to dine with him , that he hunts five or six days a week , - and reads at night . "
68520	68530	68174	68174	she	396	" That is not a bad sort of life . "
68531	68575	68174	68174	she	396	" Not if the reading is any good . But I can not bear that he should be so solitary . And if he breaks down in it , then his companions will not be fit for him . Do you ever hunt ? "
68576	68591	68462	68462	Phineas	396	" Oh yes , - at home in county Clare . All Irishmen hunt . "
68592	68613	68174	68174	she	396	" I wish you would go down to him and see him . He would be delighted to have you . "
68636	68657	68630	68630	he	2243	" I would do so , Lady Laura , - but that I have no money for hunting in England . "
68658	68663	68665	68665	she	2244	" Alas , alas ! "
68669	68678	68665	68665	she	2244	" How that hits one on every side ! "
68679	68696	68462	68462	Phineas	396	" I might manage it , - for a couple of days , - in March . "
68697	68710	68712	68713	Lady Laura	396	" Do not do what you think you ought not to do , "
68715	68733	68712	68713	Lady Laura	396	" No ; certainly . But I should like it , and if I can I will . "
68734	68795	68796	68796	He	2245	" He could mount you , I have no doubt . He has no other expense now , and keeps a stable full of horses . I think he has seven or eight . And now tell me , Mr. Finn ; when are you going to charm the House ? Or is it your first intention to strike terror ? "
68809	68835	68803	68803	he	2245	" Oh , I suppose I shall make some sort of attempt before long . I ca n't bear the idea of being a bore . "
68836	68847	68712	68713	Lady Laura	396	" I think you ought to speak , Mr. Finn . "
68848	68899	68796	68796	He	2245	" I do not know about that , but I certainly mean to try . There will be lots of opportunities about the new Reform Bill . Of course you know that Mr. Mildmay is going to bring it in at once . You hear all that from Mr. Kennedy . "
68900	68925	68926	68926	Phineas	329	" And papa has told me . I still see papa almost every day . You must call upon him . Mind you do . "
68933	68993	68926	68926	Phineas	329	" Papa is very lonely now , and I sometimes feel that I have been almost cruel in deserting him . And I think that he has a horror of the house , - especially later in the year , - always fancying that he will meet Oswald . I am so unhappy about it all , Mr. Finn . "
68994	69002	69004	69004	Phineas	329	" Why does n't your brother marry ? "
69017	69032	69014	69015	Violet Effingham	351	" If he were to marry well , that would bring your father round . "
69033	69040	68926	68926	Phineas	329	" Yes , - it would . "
69041	69048	69049	69050	Lady Laura	396	" And why should he not ? "
69064	69081	69058	69058	she	396	" He is violently in love , and the girl he loves has refused him twice . "
69082	69089	69091	69091	Phineas	329	" Is it with Miss Effingham ? "
69114	69173	69102	69103	Miss Effingham	351	" Yes ; - with Violet Effingham ; my father 's pet , his favourite , whom he loves next to myself , - almost as well as myself ; whom he would really welcome as a daughter . He would gladly make her mistress of his house , and of Saulsby . Everything would then go smoothly . "
69174	69183	69102	69103	Miss Effingham	351	" But she does not like Lord Chiltern ? "
69184	69229	69102	69103	Miss Effingham	351	" I believe she loves him in her heart ; but she is afraid of him . As she says herself , a girl is bound to be so careful of herself . With all her seeming frolic , Violet Effingham is very wise . "
69403	69412	69414	69414	he	476	" If it be wisdom on her part , "
69423	69435	69414	69414	he	476	" you can not find fault with her for her decision . "
69436	69453	69454	69455	Lady Laura	396	" I find no fault ; - but I think my brother would make her happy . "
69500	69512	69481	69481	Phineas	329	" Can it be possible that he cares for her himself ? "
70413	70419	70423	70423	himself	329	" Chiltern and Violet Effingham ! "
70433	70478	70423	70423	himself	329	" Is it fair that she should be sacrificed because she is rich , and because she is so winning and so fascinating that Lord Brentford would receive even his son for the sake of receiving also such a daughter - in - law ? "
70648	70654	70656	70657	Mr. Monk	346	" I am doing butler , "
70682	70704	70670	70670	he	346	" But I have finished , and now we will go up - stairs to receive the two great men properly . "
70705	70715	70717	70717	Finn	329	" I beg your pardon for coming too early , "
70719	70862	70717	70717	Finn	329	" Not a minute too early . Seven is seven , and it is I who am too late . But , Lord bless you , you do n't think I 'm ashamed of being found in the act of decanting my own wine ! I remember Lord Palmerston saying before some committee about salaries , five or six years ago now , I daresay , that it would n't do for an English Minister to have his hall door opened by a maid - servant . Now , I 'm an English Minister , and I 've got nobody but a maid - servant to open my hall door , and I 'm obliged to look after my own wine . I wonder whether it 's improper ? I should n't like to be the means of injuring the British Constitution . "
70863	70884	70670	70670	he	346	" Perhaps if you resign soon , and if nobody follows your example , grave evil results may be avoided . "
70885	70953	70717	70717	Finn	329	" I sincerely hope so , for I do love the British Constitution ; and I love also the respect in which members of the English Cabinet are held . Now Turnbull , who will be here in a moment , hates it all ; but he is a rich man , and has more powdered footmen hanging about his house than ever Lord Palmerston had himself . "
70954	70961	70717	70717	Finn	329	" He is still in business . "
70962	71004	70670	70670	he	346	" Oh yes ; - and makes his thirty thousand a year . Here he is . How are you , Turnbull ? We were talking about my maid - servant . I hope she opened the door for you properly . "
71005	71015	71017	71018	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Certainly , - as far as I perceived , "
71030	71040	71017	71018	Mr. Turnbull	339	" A very respectable young woman I should say . "
71041	71052	71054	71055	Mr. Monk	346	" There is not one more so in all London , "
71057	71073	71054	71055	Mr. Monk	346	" but Finn seems to think that I ought to have a man in livery . "
71074	71085	71087	71088	Mr. Turnbull	339	" It is a matter of perfect indifference to me , "
71090	71103	71087	71088	Mr. Turnbull	339	" I am one of those who never think of such things . "
71104	71109	71111	71112	Mr. Monk	346	" Nor I either , "
71748	71754	71755	71755	he	339	" I serve the people , "
71759	71781	71755	71755	he	339	" and much as I respect the servants of the Crown , I think that my own office is the higher . "
72355	72367	72369	72370	Mr. Turnbull	339	" I think Mr. Mildmay is making a great step forward , "
72372	72378	72380	72381	Mr. Monk	346	" I think he is , "
72383	72452	72380	72381	Mr. Monk	346	" I did not believe that he would ever live to go so far . It will hardly suffice even for this year ; but still coming from him , it is a great deal . It only shows how far a man may be made to go , if only the proper force be applied . After all , it matters very little who are the Ministers . "
72453	72462	72464	72465	Mr. Monk	346	" That is what I have always declared , "
72467	72508	72464	72465	Mr. Monk	346	" Very little indeed . We do n't mind whether it be Lord de Terrier , or Mr. Mildmay , or Mr. Gresham , or you yourself , if you choose to get yourself made First Lord of the Treasury . "
72509	72518	72380	72381	Mr. Monk	346	" I have no such ambition , Turnbull . "
72519	72577	72380	72381	Mr. Monk	346	" I should have thought you had . If I went in for that kind of thing myself , I should like to go to the top of the ladder . I should feel that if I could do any good at all by becoming a Minister , I could only do it by becoming first Minister . "
72578	72591	72464	72465	Mr. Monk	346	" You would n't doubt your own fitness for such a position ? "
72592	72604	72606	72607	Mr. Turnbull	339	" I doubt my fitness for the position of any Minister , "
72609	72617	72619	72620	Mr. Kennedy	343	" You mean that on other grounds , "
72622	72630	72632	72633	Mr. Turnbull	339	" I mean it on every ground , "
72648	72716	72632	72633	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Of course I am not fit to have diplomatic intercourse with men who would come to me simply with the desire of deceiving me . Of course I am unfit to deal with members of Parliament who would flock around me because they wanted places . Of course I am unfit to answer every man 's question so as to give no information to any one . "
72717	72729	72731	72732	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Could you not answer them so as to give information ? "
72765	72851	72754	72754	He	339	" Of course I am unfit to maintain the proprieties of a seeming confidence between a Crown all - powerless and a people all - powerful . No man recognises his own unfitness for such work more clearly than I do , Mr. Monk . But if I took in hand such work at all , I should like to be the leader , and not the led . Tell us fairly , now , what are your convictions worth in Mr. Mildmay 's Cabinet ? "
72852	72865	72867	72868	Mr. Monk	346	" That is a question which a man may hardly answer himself , "
72870	72891	72893	72894	Mr. Turnbull	339	" It is a question which a man should at least answer for himself before he consents to sit there , "
72906	72921	72923	72924	Mr. Monk	346	" And what reason have you for supposing that I have omitted that duty ? "
72926	72946	72923	72924	Mr. Monk	346	" Simply this , - that I can not reconcile your known opinions with the practices of your colleagues . "
72947	73094	72754	72754	He	339	" I will not tell you what my convictions may be worth in Mr. Mildmay 's Cabinet . I will not take upon myself to say that they are worth the chair on which I sit when I am there . But I will tell you what my aspirations were when I consented to fill that chair , and you shall judge of their worth . I thought that they might possibly leaven the batch of bread which we have to bake , - giving to the whole batch more of the flavour of reform than it would have possessed had I absented myself . I thought that when I was asked to join Mr. Mildmay and Mr. Gresham , the very fact of that request indicated liberal progress , and that if I refused the request I should be declining to assist in good work . "
73095	73110	73112	73113	Mr. Turnbull	339	" You could have supported them , if anything were proposed worthy of support , "
73115	73161	73112	73113	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Yes ; but I could not have been so effective in taking care that some measure be proposed worthy of support as I may possibly be now . I thought a good deal about it , and I believe that my decision was right . "
73162	73170	73172	73173	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I am sure you were right , "
73175	73191	73193	73193	Phineas	329	" There can be no juster object of ambition than a seat in the Cabinet , "
73195	73203	73205	73206	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Sir , I must dispute that , "
73214	73227	73205	73206	Mr. Turnbull	339	" I regard the position of our high Ministers as most respectable . "
73228	73235	73237	73238	Mr. Monk	346	" Thank you for so much , "
73253	73297	73241	73242	the orator	2346	" The position of gentlemen in inferior offices , - of gentlemen who attend rather to the nods and winks of their superiors in Downing Street than to the interest of their constituents , - I do not regard as being highly respectable . "
73298	73308	73310	73310	Phineas	329	" A man can not begin at the top , "
73312	73329	73331	73332	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Our friend Mr. Monk has begun at what you are pleased to call the top , "
73334	73379	73331	73332	Mr. Turnbull	339	" But I will not profess to think that even he has raised himself by going into office . To be an independent representative of a really popular commercial constituency is , in my estimation , the highest object of an Englishman 's ambition . "
73380	73388	73390	73391	Mr. Kennedy	343	" But why commercial , Mr. Turnbull ? "
73393	73431	73390	73391	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Because the commercial constituencies really do elect their own members in accordance with their own judgments , whereas the counties and the small towns are coerced either by individuals or by a combination of aristocratic influences . "
73432	73436	73438	73439	Mr. Kennedy	343	" And yet , "
73441	73457	73438	73439	Mr. Kennedy	343	" there are not half a dozen Conservatives returned by all the counties in Scotland . "
73458	73467	73469	73470	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Scotland is very much to be honoured , "
73516	73523	73525	73526	Mr. Monk	346	" Turnbull is a wonderful man , "
73528	73536	73525	73526	Mr. Monk	346	" Does he not domineer too much ? "
73537	73643	73644	73644	Phineas	329	" His fault is not arrogance , so much as ignorance that there is , or should be , a difference between public and private life . In the House of Commons a man in Mr. Turnbull 's position must speak with dictatorial assurance . He is always addressing , not the House only , but the country at large , and the country will not believe in him unless he believe in himself . But he forgets that he is not always addressing the country at large . I wonder what sort of a time Mrs. Turnbull and the little Turnbulls have of it ? "
74098	74107	74108	74108	he	329	" I am come to see Lord Chiltern , "
74111	74119	74121	74122	the Earl	733	" Is Lord Chiltern in the house ? "
74129	74141	74121	74122	the Earl	733	" Yes , my lord ; his lordship arrived last night . "
74142	74152	74154	74155	the Earl	733	" You will find him upstairs , I suppose , "
74157	74166	74167	74167	He	733	" For myself I know nothing of him . "
74219	74226	74228	74228	he	733	" By - the - bye , "
74230	74242	74228	74228	he	733	" what majority shall we have to - night , Finn ? "
74243	74257	74259	74259	Phineas	329	" Pretty nearly as many as you please to name , my lord , "
74261	74281	74259	74259	Phineas	329	" Well ; - yes ; I suppose we are tolerably safe . You ought to speak upon it . "
74282	74287	74289	74289	Phineas	329	" Perhaps I may , "
74299	74302	74304	74305	the Earl	733	" Do , "
74307	74345	74304	74305	the Earl	733	" Do . If you see Lord Chiltern will you tell him from me that I should be glad to see him before he leaves London . I shall be at home till noon to - morrow . "
74407	74422	74424	74425	Lord Chiltern	463	" When there 's no hunting I 'm driven to this kind of thing , "
74427	74435	74437	74437	Phineas	329	" I suppose it 's good exercise , "
74439	74534	74437	74437	Phineas	329	" And it gives me something to do . When I 'm in London I feel like a gipsy in church , till the time comes for prowling out at night . I 've no occupation for my days whatever , and no place to which I can take myself . I ca n't stand in a club window as some men do , and I should disgrace any decent club if I did stand there . I belong to the Travellers , but I doubt whether the porter would let me go in . "
74535	74552	74554	74554	Phineas	329	" I think you pique yourself on being more of an outer Bohemian than you are , "
74556	74596	74554	74554	Phineas	329	" I pique myself on this , that whether Bohemian or not , I will go nowhere that I am not wanted . Though , - for the matter of that , I suppose I 'm not wanted here . "
74607	74618	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" He wishes to see me to - morrow morning ? "
74623	74655	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" Let him send me word what it is he has to say to me . I do not choose to be insulted by him , though he is my father . "
74656	74667	74554	74554	Phineas	329	" I would certainly go , if I were you . "
74668	74691	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" I doubt it very much , if all the circumstances were the same . Let him tell me what he wants . "
74692	74703	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" Of course I can not ask him , Chiltern . "
74704	74727	74554	74554	Phineas	329	" I know what he wants very well . Laura has been interfering and doing no good . You know Violet Effingham ? "
74728	74735	74737	74737	Phineas	329	" Yes ; I know her , "
74742	74750	74737	74737	Phineas	329	" They want her to marry me . "
74751	74761	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" And you do not wish to marry her ? "
74762	74819	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" I did not say that . But do you think that such a girl as Miss Effingham would marry such a man as I am ? She would be much more likely to take you . By George , she would ! Do you know that she has three thousand a year of her own ? "
74820	74828	74737	74737	Phineas	329	" I know that she has money . "
74829	74904	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" That 's about the tune of it . I would take her without a shilling to - morrow , if she would have me , - because I like her . She is the only girl I ever did like . But what is the use of my liking her ? They have painted me so black among them , especially my father , that no decent girl would think of marrying me . "
74905	74925	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" Your father ca n't be angry with you if you do your best to comply with his wishes . "
74926	75001	74737	74737	Phineas	329	" I do n't care a straw whether he be angry or not . He allows me eight hundred a year , and he knows that if he stopped it I should go to the Jews the next day . I could not help myself . He ca n't leave an acre away from me , and yet he wo n't join me in raising money for the sake of paying Laura her fortune . "
75002	75011	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" Lady Laura can hardly want money now . "
75012	75056	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" That detestable prig whom she has chosen to marry , and whom I hate with all my heart , is richer than ever Croesus was ; but nevertheless Laura ought to have her own money . She shall have it some day . "
75057	75069	74737	74737	Phineas	329	" I would see Lord Brentford , if I were you . "
75070	75139	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" I will think about it . Now tell me about coming down to Willingford . Laura says you will come some day in March . I can mount you for a couple of days and should be delighted to have you . My horses all pull like the mischief , and rush like devils , and want a deal of riding ; but an Irishman likes that . "
75140	75148	74620	74621	Lord Chiltern	463	" I do not dislike it particularly . "
75149	75212	74737	74737	Phineas	329	" I like it . I prefer to have something to do on horseback . When a man tells me that a horse is an armchair , I always tell him to put the brute into his bedroom . Mind you come . The house I stay at is called the Willingford Bull , and it 's just four miles from Peterborough . "
75291	75296	75297	75297	he	2374	" Tell the Earl , "
75303	75318	75297	75297	he	2374	" that I am here and will go to him if he wishes it . "
75345	75348	75350	75351	the father	8247	" Oswald , "
75353	75380	75350	75351	the father	8247	" I have sent for you because I think it may be as well to speak to you on some business . Will you sit down ? "
75393	75404	75406	75407	the Earl	733	" I feel very unhappy about your sister 's fortune , "
75409	75438	75406	75407	the Earl	733	" So do I , - very unhappy . We can raise the money between us , and pay her to - morrow , if you please it . "
75439	75453	75350	75351	the father	8247	" It was in opposition to my advice that she paid your debts . "
75454	75462	75350	75351	the father	8247	" And in opposition to mine too . "
75463	75529	75406	75407	the Earl	733	" I told her that I would not pay them , and were I to give her back to - morrow , as you say , the money that she has so used , I should be stultifying myself . But I will do so on one condition . I will join with you in raising the money for your sister , on one condition . "
75530	75535	75350	75351	the father	8247	" What is that ? "
75536	75558	75350	75351	the father	8247	" Laura tells me , - indeed she has told me often , - that you are attached to Violet Effingham . "
75559	75574	75406	75407	the Earl	733	" But Violet Effingham , my lord , is unhappily not attached to me . "
75575	75605	75350	75351	the father	8247	" I do not know how that may be . Of course I can not say . I have never taken the liberty of interrogating her upon the subject . "
75606	75619	75350	75351	the father	8247	" Even you , my lord , could hardly have done that . "
75620	75635	75637	75638	the Earl	733	" What do you mean by that ? I say that I never have , "
75642	75670	75637	75638	the Earl	733	" I simply mean that even you could hardly have asked Miss Effingham such a question . I have asked her , and she has refused me . "
75671	75705	75350	75351	the father	8247	" But girls often do that , and yet accept afterwards the men whom they have refused . Laura tells me that she believes that Violet would consent if you pressed your suit . "
75706	75716	75350	75351	the father	8247	" Laura knows nothing about it , my lord . "
75717	75782	75350	75351	the father	8247	" There you are probably wrong . Laura and Violet are very close friends , and have no doubt discussed this matter between them . At any rate , it may be as well that you should hear what I have to say . Of course I shall not interfere myself . There is no ground on which I can do so with propriety . "
75783	75787	75789	75790	Lord Chiltern	463	" None whatever , "
75841	75941	75828	75828	he	733	" My meaning , sir , is this ; - that I have so great faith in Violet Effingham , that I would receive her acceptance of your hand as the only proof which would be convincing to me of amendment in your mode of life . If she were to do so , I would join with you in raising money to pay your sister , would make some further sacrifice with reference to an income for you and your wife , and - would make you both welcome to Saulsby , - if you chose to come . "
76000	76015	75986	75986	he	733	" If you have anything to say I shall be glad to hear it . "
76016	76035	75986	75986	he	733	" All your offers would be nothing , my lord , if I did not like the girl . "
76036	76058	75986	75986	he	733	" I should not ask you to marry a girl if you did not like her , as you call it . "
76059	76115	75986	75986	he	733	" But as to Miss Effingham , it happens that our wishes jump together . I have asked her , and she has refused me . I do n't even know where to find her to ask her again . If I went to Lady Baldock 's house the servants would not let me in . "
76116	76123	75986	75986	he	733	" And whose fault is that ? "
76124	76150	75986	75986	he	733	" Yours partly , my lord . You have told everybody that I am the devil , and now all the old women believe it . "
76151	76158	75986	75986	he	733	" I never told anybody so . "
76159	76198	75986	75986	he	733	" I 'll tell you what I 'll do . I will go down to Lady Baldock 's to - day . I suppose she is at Baddingham . And if I can get speech of Miss Effingham - "
76199	76223	75986	75986	he	733	" Miss Effingham is not at Baddingham . Miss Effingham is staying with your sister in Grosvenor Place . I saw her yesterday . "
76224	76230	75986	75986	he	733	" She is in London ? "
76231	76241	75986	75986	he	733	" I tell you that I saw her yesterday . "
76242	76266	75986	75986	he	733	" Very well , my lord . Then I will do the best I can . Laura will tell you of the result . "
76559	76566	76567	76567	he	8205	" I ca n't eat lunch , "
76570	76582	76567	76567	he	8205	" Tell them that I am in the drawing - room . "
76583	76591	76593	76594	Lady Laura	344	" He has come to see you , "
76606	76611	76613	76613	Violet	351	" I hope not , "
76615	76621	76613	76613	Violet	351	" Do not say that . "
76622	76662	76567	76567	he	8205	" But I do say it . I hope he has not come to see me ; - that is , not to see me specially . Of course I can not pretend not to know what you mean . "
76663	76681	76683	76684	Lady Laura	344	" He may think it civil to call if he has heard that you are in town , "
76690	76736	76683	76684	Lady Laura	344	" If it be only that , I will be civil in return ; - as sweet as May to him . If it be really only that , and if I were sure of it , I should be really glad to see him . "
76758	76764	76766	76766	she	344	" I hope you remember , "
76770	76780	76766	76766	she	344	" that you might be a saviour to him . "
76781	76836	76683	76684	Lady Laura	344	" I do not believe in girls being saviours to men . It is the man who should be the saviour to the girl . If I marry at all , I have the right to expect that protection shall be given to me , - not that I shall have to give it . "
76837	76849	76766	76766	she	344	" Violet , you are determined to misrepresent what I mean . "
76883	76891	76892	76892	she	351	" But it seems to be going , "
76895	76908	76892	76892	she	351	" and I suppose that you will soon be at work again ? "
76909	76920	76922	76923	Lord Chiltern	463	" Yes ; - I shall hunt to - morrow , "
76925	76939	76941	76941	Violet	351	" And the next day , and the next , and the next , "
76943	76961	76941	76941	Violet	351	" till about the middle of April ; - and then your period of misery will begin ! "
76962	76965	76967	76968	Lord Chiltern	463	" Exactly , "
76970	76983	76967	76968	Lord Chiltern	463	" I have nothing but hunting that I can call an occupation . "
76984	76992	76994	76995	his sister	1119	" Why do n't you make one ? "
76997	77025	76994	76995	his sister	1119	" I mean to do so , if it be possible . Laura , would you mind leaving me and Miss Effingham alone for a few minutes ? "
77038	77043	77045	77046	the latter	7687	" For what purpose ? "
77048	77058	77045	77046	the latter	7687	" It can not be for any good purpose . "
77059	77074	77075	77076	Lady Laura	344	" At any rate I wish it , and I will not harm you . "
77089	77100	77102	77103	the brother	2411	" Laura , will you do as I ask you ? "
77110	77125	77127	77127	Violet	351	" It was not that I feared you would harm me , Lord Chiltern , "
77129	77178	77127	77127	Violet	351	" No ; - I know it was not . But what I say is always said awkwardly . An hour ago I did not know that you were in town , but when I was told the news I came at once . My father told me . "
77179	77190	77102	77103	the brother	2411	" I am so glad that you see your father . "
77191	77228	77127	77127	Violet	351	" I have not spoken to him for months before , and probably may not speak to him for months again . But there is one point , Violet , on which he and I agree . "
77229	77238	77102	77103	the brother	2411	" I hope there will soon be many . "
77239	77256	77259	77259	he	2412	" It is possible , - but I fear not probable . Look here , Violet , "
77289	77369	77274	77274	he	2412	" I should scorn myself were I to permit myself to come before you with a plea for your favour founded on my father 's whims . My father is unreasonable , and has been very unjust to me . He has ever believed evil of me , and has believed it often when all the world knew that he was wrong . I care little for being reconciled to a father who has been so cruel to me . "
77370	77394	77102	77103	the brother	2411	" He loves me dearly , and is my friend . I would rather that you should not speak against him to me . "
77395	77431	77102	77103	the brother	2411	" You will understand , at least , that I am asking nothing from you because he wishes it . Laura probably has told you that you may make things straight by becoming my wife . "
77432	77442	77274	77274	he	2412	" She has , - certainly , Lord Chiltern . "
77443	77563	77102	77103	the brother	2411	" It is an argument that she should never have used . It is an argument to which you should not listen for a moment . Make things straight indeed ! Who can tell ? There would be very little made straight by such a marriage , if it were not that I loved you . Violet , that is my plea , and my only one . I love you so well that I do believe that if you took me I should return to the old ways , and become as other men are , and be in time as respectable , as stupid , - and perhaps as ill - natured as old Lady Baldock herself . "
77564	77569	77102	77103	the brother	2411	" My poor aunt ! "
77570	77598	77102	77103	the brother	2411	" You know she says worse things of me than that . Now , dearest , you have heard all that I have to say to you . "
77622	77679	77616	77616	she	2415	" I have no other argument to use , - not a word more to say . As I came here in the cab I was turning it over in my mind that I might find what best I should say . But , after all , there is nothing more to be said than that . "
77680	77687	77688	77688	she	2415	" The words make no difference , "
77691	77765	77688	77688	she	2415	" Not unless they be so uttered as to force a belief . I do love you . I know no other reason but that why you should be my wife . I have no other excuse to offer for coming to you again . You are the one thing in the world that to me has any charm . Can you be surprised that I should be persistent in asking for it ? "
77822	77830	77831	77831	she	2415	" How am I to answer you ? "
77834	77864	77831	77831	she	2415	" With your love , if you can give it to me . Do you remember how you swore once that you would love me for ever and always ? "
77865	77885	77886	77886	she	2415	" You should not remind me of that . I was a child then , - a naughty child , "
77891	77905	77886	77886	she	2415	" and was put to bed for what I did on that day . "
77906	77912	77831	77831	she	2415	" Be a child still . "
77913	77921	77831	77831	she	2415	" Ah , if we but could ! "
77922	77933	77831	77831	she	2415	" And have you no other answer to make me ? "
77934	77968	77831	77831	she	2415	" Of course I must answer you . You are entitled to an answer . Lord Chiltern , I am sorry that I can not give you the love for which you ask . "
77969	77972	77831	77831	she	2415	" Never ? "
77973	77976	77831	77831	she	2415	" Never . "
77977	77998	77831	77831	she	2415	" Is it myself personally , or what you have heard of me , that is so hateful to you ? "
77999	78057	77831	77831	she	2415	" Nothing is hateful to me . I have never spoken of hate . I shall always feel the strongest regard for my old friend and playfellow . But there are many things which a woman is bound to consider before she allows herself so to love a man that she can consent to become his wife . "
78058	78071	77831	77831	she	2415	" Allow herself ! Then it is a matter entirely of calculation . "
78072	78086	77831	77831	she	2415	" I suppose there should be some thought in it , Lord Chiltern . "
78138	78145	78146	78146	he	7504	" I shall never try again , "
78149	78156	78157	78157	she	2419	" It will be better so , "
78160	78201	78157	78157	she	2419	" There is something to me unmanly in a man 's persecuting a girl . Just tell Laura , will you , that it is all over ; and she may as well tell my father . Good - bye . "
78234	78243	78244	78245	Lady Laura	344	" And yet I believe you love him , "
78266	78277	78251	78251	her	344	" You have no right to say that , Laura . "
78278	78314	78346	78346	she	344	" I have a right to my belief , and I do believe it . I think you love him , and that you lack the courage to risk yourself in trying to save him . "
78315	78329	78251	78251	her	344	" Is a woman bound to marry a man if she love him ? "
78330	78336	78338	78339	Lady Laura	344	" Yes , she is , "
78350	78364	78338	78339	Lady Laura	344	" that is , if she be convinced that she also is loved . "
78365	78401	78251	78251	her	344	" Whatever be the man 's character ; - whatever be the circumstances ? Must she do so , whatever friends may say to the contrary ? Is there to be no prudence in marriage ? "
78402	78413	78415	78416	Lady Laura	344	" There may be a great deal too much prudence , "
78418	78439	78440	78440	Violet	341	" That is true . There is certainly too much prudence if a woman marries prudently , but without love . "
78496	78502	78503	78503	she	344	" We shall get nothing , "
78506	78515	78503	78503	she	344	" by descending to personalities with each other . "
78516	78523	78475	78476	Lady Laura	344	" I meant none , Laura . "
78524	78532	78534	78535	Lady Laura	344	" I suppose it is always hard , "
78537	78578	78534	78535	Lady Laura	344	" for any one person to judge altogether of the mind of another . If I have said anything severe of your refusal of my brother , I retract it . I only wish that it could have been otherwise . "
78651	78662	78664	78665	Captain Clutterbuck	508	" Let 's have another bottle of ' cham , ' "
78674	78693	78664	78665	Captain Clutterbuck	508	" ' Cham ' is the only thing to screw one up when one is down a peg . "
78694	78702	78704	78705	Lord Chiltern	463	" You can have what you like , "
78707	78719	78704	78705	Lord Chiltern	463	" but I shall have some brandy - and - water . "
78720	78743	78745	78746	Captain Clutterbuck	508	" The worst of brandy - and - water is , that one gets tired of it before the night is over , "
78810	78818	78820	78821	Lord Chiltern	463	" He is n't worth above fifty , "
78823	78833	78835	78835	Piles	509	" But I 'll give you the three hundred , "
78837	78849	78851	78852	Lord Chiltern	463	" You could n't ride him if you 'd got him , "
78854	78861	78863	78863	Piles	509	" Oh , could n't I ! "
80159	80163	80164	80164	He	329	" count out . "
80388	80393	80394	80394	he	346	" My idea is , "
80400	80482	80394	80394	he	346	" that every man possessed of the franchise should dare to have and to express a political opinion of his own ; that otherwise the franchise is not worth having ; and that men will learn that when all so dare , no evil can come from such daring . As the ballot would make any courage of that kind unnecessary , I dislike the ballot . I shall confine myself to that , and leave the illustration to younger debaters . "
80608	80614	80615	80615	he	346	" The ballot - box , "
80618	80628	80615	80615	he	346	" was the grave of all true political opinion . "
80782	80787	80788	80788	he	339	" There was nothing , "
80791	80818	80788	80788	he	339	" that he admired so much as the poetic imagery and the high - flown sentiment of his right honourable friend the member for West Bromwich , "
80828	80849	80820	80821	Mr. Monk	346	" unless it were the stubborn facts and unanswered arguments of his honourable friend who had brought forward this motion . "
80950	80955	80957	80958	Mr. Turnbull	339	" I once thought , "
80961	81042	80957	80958	Mr. Turnbull	339	" nay , not long ago I thought , that he and I would have fought this battle for the people , shoulder to shoulder , and knee to knee ; - but he has preferred that the knee next to his own shall wear a garter , and that the shoulder which supports him shall be decked with a blue ribbon , - as shoulders , I presume , are decked in those closet conferences which are called Cabinets . "
81089	81120	81065	81066	Barrington Erle	364	" Bonteen is prepared to answer Turnbull , and wishes to do it . I told him that I thought you should have the opportunity , if you wish it . "
81137	81142	81144	81144	Erle	364	" Somebody told me , "
81146	81161	81144	81144	Erle	364	" that you had said that you would like to speak to - night . "
81162	81167	81169	81169	Phineas	329	" So I did , "
81171	81182	81169	81169	Phineas	329	" Shall I tell Bonteen that you will do it ? "
81480	81486	81487	81487	he	329	" I had rather wait , "
81492	81498	81487	81487	he	329	" Bonteen had better reply . "
82264	82276	82277	82277	He	408	" Yes ; Lady Laura was at home ; and alone . "
82298	82306	82307	82307	she	344	" So the great debate is over , "
82325	82332	82307	82307	she	344	" Yes ; it is over . "
82333	82347	82316	82316	she	344	" And what have they done , - those leviathans of the people ? "
82357	82369	82370	82370	she	344	" Is there anything the matter with you , Mr. Finn ? "
82378	82384	82370	82370	she	344	" Are you not well ? "
82385	82393	82307	82307	she	344	" Yes ; I am very well . "
82394	82413	82307	82307	she	344	" Will you not sit down ? There is something wrong , I know . What is it ? "
82414	82435	82370	82370	she	344	" I have simply been the greatest idiot , the greatest coward , the most awkward ass that ever lived ! "
82436	82442	82307	82307	she	344	" What do you mean ? "
82443	82491	82307	82307	she	344	" I do not know why I should come to tell you of it at this hour at night , but I have come that I might tell you . Probably because there is no one else in the whole world who would not laugh at me . "
82492	82504	82506	82507	Lady Laura	344	" At any rate , I shall not laugh at you , "
82509	82516	82506	82507	Lady Laura	344	" But you will despise me . "
82517	82527	82307	82307	she	344	" That I am sure I shall not do . "
82528	82666	82307	82307	she	344	" You can not help it . I despise myself . For years I have placed before myself the ambition of speaking in the House of Commons ; - for years I have been thinking whether there would ever come to me an opportunity of making myself heard in that assembly , which I consider to be the first in the world . To - day the opportunity has been offered to me , - and , though the motion was nothing , the opportunity was great . The subject was one on which I was thoroughly prepared . The manner in which I was summoned was most flattering to me . I was especially called on to perform a task which was most congenial to my feelings ; - and I declined because I was afraid . "
82667	82679	82681	82682	Lady Laura	344	" You had thought too much about it , my friend , "
82684	82696	82698	82698	Phineas	329	" Too much or too little , what does it matter ? "
82703	82787	82698	82698	Phineas	329	" There is the fact . I could not do it . Do you remember the story of Conachar in the ' Fair Maid of Perth ; ' - how his heart refused to give him blood enough to fight ? He had been suckled with the milk of a timid creature , and , though he could die , there was none of the strength of manhood in him . It is about the same thing with me , I take it . "
82788	82800	82802	82803	Lady Laura	344	" I do not think you are at all like Conachar , "
82805	82833	82802	82803	Lady Laura	344	" I am equally disgraced , and I must perish after the same fashion . I shall apply for the Chiltern Hundreds in a day or two . "
82834	82843	82845	82846	Lady Laura	344	" You will do nothing of the kind , "
82858	82913	82845	82846	Lady Laura	344	" You shall not leave this room till you have promised me that you will do nothing of the kind . I do not know as yet what has occurred to - night ; but I do know that that modesty which has kept you silent is more often a grace than a disgrace . "
83070	83081	83082	83082	she	344	" And you would give it all up for that ? "
83085	83093	83082	83082	she	344	" Yes ; I think I ought . "
83094	83189	83054	83054	his	2522	" I have very little doubt but that you were right in allowing Mr. Bonteen to undertake such a task . I should simply explain to Mr. Monk that you felt too keen an interest in his welfare to stand up as an untried member in his defence . It is not , I think , the work for a man who is not at home in the House . I am sure Mr. Monk will feel this , and I am quite certain that Mr. Kennedy will think that you have been right . "
83190	83201	83288	83288	her	2527	" I do not care what Mr. Kennedy may think . "
83202	83217	83082	83082	she	344	" Why do you say that , Mr. Finn ? That is not courteous . "
83218	83254	83054	83054	his	2522	" Simply because I care so much what Mr. Kennedy 's wife may think . Your opinion is all in all to me , - only that I know you are too kind to me . "
83255	83279	83288	83288	her	2527	" He would not be too kind to you . He is never too kind to any one . He is justice itself . "
83311	83316	83318	83318	Phineas	329	" I hate justice , "
83320	83353	83318	83318	Phineas	329	" I know that justice would condemn me . But love and friendship know nothing of justice . The value of love is that it overlooks faults , and forgives even crimes . "
83354	83361	83363	83364	Lady Laura	344	" I , at any rate , "
83366	83429	83363	83364	Lady Laura	344	" will forgive the crime of your silence in the House . My strong belief in your success will not be in the least affected by what you tell me of your failure to - night . You must await another opportunity ; and , if possible , you should be less anxious as to your own performance . There is Violet . "
83458	83475	83363	83364	Lady Laura	344	" She is staying here , but has been dining with her uncle , Admiral Effingham . "
83498	83515	83477	83478	Violet Effingham	351	" Here is Mr. Finn , come to tell us of the debate about the ballot . "
83516	83526	83528	83528	Violet	351	" I do n't care twopence about the ballot , "
83539	83556	83531	83531	she	351	" Are we going to have a new iron fleet built ? That 's the question . "
83557	83568	83570	83571	Lady Laura	344	" Sir Simeon has come out strong to - night , "
83573	83590	83592	83592	Violet	351	" There is no political question of any importance except the question of the iron fleet , "
83594	83623	83592	83592	Violet	351	" I am quite sure of that , and so , if Mr. Finn can tell me nothing about the iron fleet , I 'll go to bed . "
83624	83636	83638	83638	Phineas	329	" Mr. Kennedy will tell you everything when he comes home , "
83640	83670	83638	83638	Phineas	329	" Oh , Mr. Kennedy ! Mr. Kennedy never tells one anything . I doubt whether Mr. Kennedy thinks that any woman knows the meaning of the British Constitution . "
83671	83681	83683	83684	Lady Laura	344	" Do you know what it means , Violet ? "
83686	83743	83683	83684	Lady Laura	344	" To be sure I do . It is liberty to growl about the iron fleet , or the ballot , or the taxes , or the peers , or the bishops , - or anything else , except the House of Commons . That 's the British Constitution . Good - night , Mr. Finn . "
83744	83752	83754	83754	Phineas	329	" What a beautiful creature she is ! "
83756	83761	83763	83764	Lady Laura	344	" Yes , indeed , "
83766	83786	83763	83764	Lady Laura	344	" And full of wit and grace and pleasantness . I do not wonder at your brother 's choice . "
83810	83826	83803	83803	his	463	" Poor Oswald ! he does not know as yet that she is in town . "
83969	83973	83940	83941	Miss Effingham	351	" Do be punctual "
84249	84259	84230	84231	Mrs. Bunce	333	" What sort of a man , Mrs. Bunce ? "
84260	84269	84230	84231	Mrs. Bunce	333	" He ai n't a gentleman , sir . "
84270	84277	84230	84231	Mrs. Bunce	333	" Did he give his name ? "
84278	84312	84325	84325	He	329	" He did not , sir ; but I know it 's about money . I know the ways of them so well . I 've seen this one 's face before somewhere . "
84313	84321	84323	84323	Phineas	329	" You had better show him up , "
84675	84682	84683	84684	Mrs. Bunce	333	" He ai n't a gentleman , "
84790	84798	84800	84801	the visitor	8434	" About this bill , Mr. Finn , "
84827	84849	84820	84820	he	8434	" My name is Clarkson , Mr. Finn . If I may venture so far , I 'll take a chair . "
84850	84856	84858	84858	Phineas	329	" Certainly , Mr. Clarkson , "
84868	84889	84890	84890	Whereupon	517	" Thankye , Mr. Finn , thankye . We shall be more comfortable doing business sitting , sha n't we ? "
84993	84998	85000	85001	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Here it is , "
85005	85080	85000	85001	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Oh , dear me , dear me ! the third of November , and here we are in March ! I did n't think it was so bad as this ; - I did n't indeed . This is very bad , - very bad ! And for Parliament gents , too , who should be more punctual than anybody , because of the privilege . Should n't they now , Mr. Finn ? "
85081	85091	85093	85093	Phineas	329	" All men should be punctual , I suppose , "
85095	85152	85093	85093	Phineas	329	" Of course they should ; of course they should . I always say to my gents , ' Be punctual , and I 'll do anything for you . ' But , perhaps , Mr. Finn , you can hand me a cheque for this amount , and then you and I will begin square . "
85153	85162	85000	85001	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Indeed I can not , Mr. Clarkson . "
85163	85172	85000	85001	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Not hand me a cheque for it ! "
85173	85180	85093	85093	Phineas	329	" Upon my word , no . "
85181	85220	85000	85001	Mr. Clarkson	517	" That 's very bad ; - very bad indeed . Then I suppose I must take the half , and renew for the remainder , though I do n't like it ; - I do n't indeed . "
85221	85234	85000	85001	Mr. Clarkson	517	" I can pay no part of that bill , Mr. Clarkson . "
85235	85242	85000	85001	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Pay no part of it ! "
85272	85285	85287	85287	Phineas	329	" If you 'll allow me , I 'll manage the fire , "
85313	85320	85321	85321	he	517	" Pay no part of it ! "
85336	85385	85321	85321	he	517	" Do n't say that , Mr. Finn . Pray do n't say that . Do n't drive me to be severe . I do n't like to be severe with my gents . I 'll do anything , Mr. Finn , if you 'll only be punctual . "
85386	85408	85426	85426	his	517	" The fact is , Mr. Clarkson , I have never had one penny of consideration for that bill , and - "
85409	85420	85423	85424	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Oh , Mr. Finn ! oh , Mr. Finn ! "
85432	85444	85446	85446	Phineas	329	" I never had one penny of consideration for that bill , "
85448	85459	85446	85446	Phineas	329	" Of course , I do n't deny my responsibility . "
85460	85493	85426	85426	his	517	" No , Mr. Finn ; you ca n't deny that . Here it is ; - Phineas Finn ; - and everybody knows you , because you 're a Parliament gent . "
85494	85555	85426	85426	his	517	" I do n't deny it . But I had no reason to suppose that I should be called upon for the money when I accommodated my friend , Mr. Fitzgibbon , and I have not got it . That is the long and the short of it . I must see him and take care that arrangements are made . "
85556	85559	85446	85446	Phineas	329	" Arrangements ! "
85560	85569	85426	85426	his	517	" Yes , arrangements for settling the bill . "
85570	85590	85426	85426	his	517	" He has n't got the money , Mr. Finn . You know that as well as I do . "
85591	85601	85446	85446	Phineas	329	" I know nothing about it , Mr. Clarkson . "
85602	85615	85426	85426	his	517	" Oh yes , Mr. Finn ; you know ; you know . "
85616	85626	85628	85628	Phineas	329	" I tell you I know nothing about it , "
85633	85747	85628	85628	Phineas	329	" As to Mr. Fitzgibbon , he 's the pleasantest gent that ever lived . Is n't he now ? I 've know'd him these ten years . I do n't suppose that for ten years I 've been without his name in my pocket . But , bless you , Mr. Finn , there 's an end to everything . I should n't have looked at this bit of paper if it had n't been for your signature . Of course not . You 're just beginning , and it 's natural you should want a little help . You 'll find me always ready , if you 'll only be punctual . "
85748	85776	85778	85779	Mr. Clarkson	517	" I tell you again , sir , that I never had a shilling out of that for myself , and do not want any such help . "
85783	85796	85778	85779	Mr. Clarkson	517	" I gave my name to my friend simply to oblige him . "
85797	85811	85813	85814	Mr. Clarkson	517	" I like you Irish gents because you do hang together so close , "
85816	85822	85824	85824	Phineas	329	" Simply to oblige him , "
85826	85874	85824	85824	Phineas	329	" As I said before , I know that I am responsible ; but , as I said before also , I have not the means of taking up that bill . I will see Mr. Fitzgibbon , and let you know what we propose to do . "
85911	85936	85901	85902	Mr. Clarkson	517	" I 'm afraid I must ask you to leave me now , Mr. Clarkson , as I have business down at the House . "
85937	85948	85950	85951	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Business at the House never presses , Mr. Finn , "
85953	86031	85950	85951	Mr. Clarkson	517	" That 's the best of Parliament . I 've known Parliament gents this thirty years and more . Would you believe it - I 've had a Prime Minister 's name in that portfolio ; that I have ; and a Lord Chancellor 's ; that I have ; - and an Archbishop 's too . I know what Parliament is , Mr. Finn . Come , come ; do n't put me off with Parliament . "
86125	86128	86129	86129	he	2586	" Sir , "
86132	86187	86129	86129	he	2586	" it is really imperative that I should go . I am pledged to an appointment at the House at twelve , and it wants now only a quarter . I regret that your interview with me should be so unsatisfactory , but I can only promise you that I will see Mr. Fitzgibbon . "
86188	86199	86129	86129	he	2586	" And when shall I call again , Mr. Finn ? "
86200	86209	86211	86211	Phineas	329	" Perhaps I had better write to you , "
86213	86219	86221	86222	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Oh dear , no , "
86224	86267	86221	86222	Mr. Clarkson	517	" I should much prefer to look in . Looking in is always best . We can get to understand one another in that way . Let me see . I daresay you 're not particular . Suppose I say Sunday morning . "
86268	86283	86129	86129	he	2586	" Really , I could not see you on Sunday morning , Mr. Clarkson . "
86284	86300	86302	86303	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Parliament gents ai n't generally particular , - ' speciaily not among the Catholics , "
86305	86313	86315	86315	Phineas	329	" I am always engaged on Sundays , "
86317	86357	86315	86315	Phineas	329	" Suppose we say Monday , - or Tuesday . Tuesday morning at eleven . And do be punctual , Mr. Finn . At Tuesday morning I 'll come , and then no doubt I shall find you ready . "
86393	86402	86403	86403	he	517	" Only do be punctual , Mr. Finn , "
87654	87667	87669	87669	Phineas	329	" I want you to come down to the Reform with me , "
87671	87690	87669	87669	Phineas	329	" By jingo , my dear fellow , I 'm in the middle of a rubber of whist . "
87691	87703	87628	87629	Mr. Fitzgibbon	391	" There has been a man with me about that bill . "
87704	87710	87669	87669	Phineas	329	" What ; - Clarkson ? "
87711	87716	87718	87718	Phineas	329	" Yes , Clarkson , "
87720	87726	87728	87728	Fitzgibbon	391	" Do n't mind him , "
87730	87758	87728	87728	Fitzgibbon	391	" That 's nonsense . How am I to help minding him ? I must mind him . He is coming to me again on Tuesday morning . "
87759	87765	87669	87669	Phineas	329	" Do n't see him . "
87766	87774	87669	87669	Phineas	329	" How can I help seeing him ? "
87775	87785	87728	87728	Fitzgibbon	391	" Make them say you 're not at home . "
87786	87818	87669	87669	Phineas	329	" He has made an appointment . He has told me that he 'll never leave me alone . He 'll be the death of me if this is not settled . "
87819	87865	87728	87728	Fitzgibbon	391	" It shall be settled , my dear fellow . I 'll see about it . I 'll see about it and write you a line . You must excuse me now , because those fellows are waiting . I 'll have it all arranged . "
87983	87989	87991	87991	Violet	341	" Gustavus will go mad , "
88020	88031	88033	88034	Lady Laura	344	" Why does not Lord Baldock take a house himself ? "
88036	88045	88046	88046	Violet	341	" Do n't you know , my dear , "
88049	88080	88046	88046	Violet	341	" how much we Baddingham people think of money ? We do n't like being vexed and driven mad , but even that is better than keeping up two households . "
88117	88142	88143	88144	Lady Baldock	341	" As you are so fond of being in London , Augusta and I have made up our minds to come up before Easter , "
88150	88158	88159	88159	Violet	341	" I shall go to her now , "
88166	88186	88159	88159	Violet	341	" because I have not quite made up my mind as to what I will do for the future . "
88187	88197	88143	88144	Lady Baldock	341	" Marry Oswald , and be your own mistress . "
88198	88257	88159	88159	Violet	341	" I mean to be my own mistress without marrying Oswald , though I do n't see my way quite clearly as yet . I think I shall set up a little house of my own , and let the world say what it pleases . I suppose they could n't make me out to be a lunatic . "
88258	88269	88271	88272	Lady Laura	344	" I should n't wonder if they were to try , "
88274	88306	88271	88272	Lady Laura	344	" They could not prevent me in any other way . But I am in the dark as yet , and so I shall be obedient and go to my aunt . "
88650	88661	88662	88663	Lady Laura	344	" I think you like my friend , Mr. Finn , "
88676	88687	88662	88663	Lady Laura	344	" Yes , I do . I like him decidedly . "
88688	88707	88662	88663	Lady Laura	344	" So do I. I should hardly have thought that you would have taken a fancy to him . "
88708	88719	88721	88721	Violet	351	" I hardly know what you call taking a fancy , "
88723	88745	88721	88721	Violet	351	" I am not quite sure I like to be told that I have taken a fancy for a young man . "
88746	88755	88662	88663	Lady Laura	344	" I mean no offence , my dear . "
88756	88896	88662	88663	Lady Laura	344	" Of course you do n't But , to speak truth , I think I have rather taken a fancy to him . There is just enough of him , but not too much . I do n't mean materially , - in regard to his inches ; but as to his mental belongings . I hate a stupid man who ca n't talk to me , and I hate a clever man who talks me down . I do n't like a man who is too lazy to make any effort to shine ; but I particularly dislike the man who is always striving for effect . I abominate a humble man , but yet I love to perceive that a man acknowledges the superiority of my sex , and youth , and all that kind of thing . "
88897	88907	88721	88721	Violet	351	" You want to be flattered without plain flattery . "
88908	89004	88662	88663	Lady Laura	344	" Of course I do . A man who would tell me that I am pretty , unless he is over seventy , ought to be kicked out of the room . But a man who ca n't show me that he thinks me so without saying a word about it , is a lout . Now in all those matters , your friend , Mr. Finn , seems to know what he is about . In other words , he makes himself pleasant , and , therefore , one is glad to see him . "
89005	89019	89085	89085	She	344	" I suppose you do not mean to fall in love with him ? "
89020	89044	88662	88663	Lady Laura	344	" Not that I know of , my dear . But when I do , I 'll be sure to give you notice . "
89568	89573	89574	89574	Laurence	391	" My dear fellow , "
89580	89633	89574	89574	Laurence	391	" I have had Clarkson almost living in my rooms . He used to drink nearly a pint of sherry a day for me . All I looked to was that I did n't live there at the same time . If you wish it , I 'll send in the sherry . "
89690	89702	89703	89704	Mr. Monk	346	" As to what Turnbull says about me in the House , "
89710	89764	89703	89704	Mr. Monk	346	" he and I understand each other perfectly . I should like to see you on your legs , but it is just as well , perhaps , that you have deferred it . We shall have the real question on immediately after Easter , and then you 'll have plenty of opportunities . "
89795	89802	89804	89804	he	346	" I know all about it , "
89806	89840	89804	89804	he	346	" and have gone through it all myself . The more respect you feel for the House , the more satisfaction you will have in addressing it when you have mastered this difficulty . "
89901	89905	89907	89907	she	401	" Mr. Finn , "
89909	89930	89907	89907	she	401	" how d'ye do ? I want to say a word to ye . Just come here into the corner . "
89948	89965	89907	89907	she	401	" Tell me now , Mr. Finn ; - have ye been lending money to Laurence ? "
89966	89976	89978	89978	Phineas	329	" No ; I have lent him no money , "
89986	90034	89978	89978	Phineas	329	" Do n't . That 's my advice to ye . Do n't . On any other matter Laurence is the best creature in the world , - but he 's bad to lend money to . You ai n't in any hobble with him , then ? "
90035	90049	89907	89907	she	401	" Well ; - nothing to speak of . What makes you ask ? "
90050	90095	89978	89978	Phineas	329	" Then you are in a hobble ? Dear , dear ! I never saw such a man as Laurence ; - never . Good - bye . I would n't do it again , if I were you ; - that 's all . "
90120	90126	90128	90128	she	351	" I did not know , "
90130	90142	90128	90128	she	351	" that you and the divine Aspasia were such close allies . "
90143	90162	89907	89907	she	401	" We are the dearest friends in the world , but she has taken my breath away now . "
90163	90175	90176	90176	Violet	351	" May a body be told how she has done that ? "
90179	90227	90176	90176	Violet	351	" Well , no ; I 'm afraid not , even though the body be Miss Effingham . It was a profound secret ; - really a secret concerning a third person , and she began about it just as though she were speaking about the weather ! "
90228	90256	89907	89907	she	401	" How charming ! I do so like her . You have n't heard , have you , that Mr. Ratler proposed to her the other day ? "
90257	90260	89907	89907	she	401	" No ! "
90261	90293	89907	89907	she	401	" But he did ; - at least , so she tells everybody . She said she 'd take him if he would promise to get her brother 's salary doubled . "
90294	90300	89907	89907	she	401	" Did she tell you ? "
90301	90340	89907	89907	she	401	" No ; not me . And of course I do n't believe a word of it . I suppose Barrington Erle made up the story . Are you going out of town next week , Mr. Finn ? "
90351	90360	89907	89907	she	401	" I heard you were going into Northamptonshire . "
90361	90366	89907	89907	she	401	" From Lady Laura ? "
90367	90375	89907	89907	she	401	" Yes ; - from Lady Laura . "
90376	90415	89907	89907	she	401	" I intend to spend three days with Lord Chiltern at Willingford . It is an old promise . I am going to ride his horses , - that is , if I am able to ride them . "
90416	90436	89907	89907	she	401	" Take care what you are about , Mr. Finn ; - they say his horses are so dangerous ! "
90437	90449	89907	89907	she	401	" I 'm rather good at falling , I flatter myself . "
90450	90491	89907	89907	she	401	" I know that Lord Chiltern rides anything he can sit , so long as it is some animal that nobody else will ride . It was always so with him . He is so odd ; is he not ? "
90597	90602	90604	90604	Phineas	329	" He is odd , "
90606	90621	90604	90604	Phineas	329	" but he is an excellent fellow , - whom his father altogether misunderstands . "
90622	90672	90594	90595	Lord Chiltern	463	" Exactly , - just so ; I am so glad to hear you say that , - you who have never had the misfortune to have anything to do with a bad set . Why do n't you tell Lord Brentford ? Lord Brentford would listen to you . "
90673	90677	90604	90604	Phineas	329	" To me ? "
90678	90719	90604	90604	Phineas	329	" Yes ; - of course he would , - for you are just the link that is wanting . You are Chiltern 's intimate friend , and you are also the friend of big - wigs and Cabinet Ministers . "
90720	90739	90594	90595	Lord Chiltern	463	" Lord Brentford would put me down at once if I spoke to him on such a subject . "
90740	90787	90788	90788	Phineas	329	" I am sure he would not . You are too big to be put down , and no man can really dislike to hear his son well spoken of by those who are well spoken of themselves . Wo n't you try , Mr. Finn ? "
90810	90824	90826	90826	Violet	351	" Of course you know how intimate I have been with the Standishes , "
90828	90847	90826	90826	Violet	351	" that Laura is to me a sister , and that Oswald used to be almost a brother . "
90848	90865	90594	90595	Lord Chiltern	463	" Why do not you speak to Lord Brentford ; - you who are his favourite ? "
90866	90944	90826	90826	Violet	351	" There are reasons , Mr. Finn . Besides , how can any girl come forward and say that she knows the disposition of any man ? You can live with Lord Chiltern , and see what he is made of , and know his thoughts , and learn what is good in him , and also what is bad . After all , how is any girl really to know anything of a man 's life ? "
90945	90958	90960	90960	Phineas	329	" If I can do anything , Miss Effingham , I will , "
90962	90976	90978	90978	Violet	351	" And then we shall all of us be so grateful to you , "
91350	91361	91363	91364	Lady Laura	344	" What were you and Violet talking about so eagerly ? "
91384	91392	91363	91364	Lady Laura	344	" We were talking about your brother . "
91393	91404	91363	91364	Lady Laura	344	" You are going to him , are you not ? "
91405	91424	91363	91364	Lady Laura	344	" Yes ; I leave London on Sunday night ; - but only for a day or two . "
91425	91436	91363	91364	Lady Laura	344	" Has he any chance there , do you think ? "
91437	91444	91363	91364	Lady Laura	344	" What , with Miss Effingham ? "
91445	91459	91363	91364	Lady Laura	344	" Yes ; - with Violet . Sometimes I think she loves him . "
91460	91499	91363	91364	Lady Laura	344	" How can I say ? In such a matter you can judge better than I can do . One woman with reference to another can draw the line between love and friendship . She certainly likes Chiltern . "
91500	91662	91363	91364	Lady Laura	344	" Oh , I believe she loves him . I do indeed . But she fears him . She does not quite understand how much there is of tenderness with that assumed ferocity . And Oswald is so strange , so unwise , so impolitic , that though he loves her better than all the world beside , he will not sacrifice even a turn of a word to win her . When he asks her to marry him , he almost flies at her throat , as an angry debtor who applies for instant payment . Tell him , Mr. Finn , never to give it over ; - and teach him that he should be soft with her . Tell him , also , that in her heart she likes him . One woman , as you say , knows another woman ; and I am certain he would win her if he would only be gentle with her . "
92223	92239	92240	92240	he	404	" I wo n't say that reading a novel on a Sunday is a sin , "
92243	92287	92240	92240	he	404	" but we must at any rate admit that it is a matter on which men disagree , that many of the best of men are against such occupation on Sunday , and that to abstain is to be on the safe side . "
92657	92666	92667	92667	she	344	" I have got a headache , Robert , "
92676	92688	92667	92667	she	344	" I think I will not go to church this afternoon . "
92689	92698	92635	92637	a clever man	8178	" It is not serious , I hope . "
92699	92733	92667	92667	she	344	" Oh dear no . Do n't you know how one feels sometimes that one has got a head ? And when that is the case one 's armchair is the best place . "
92734	92742	92744	92745	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I am not sure of that , "
92747	92758	92760	92761	Lady Laura	344	" If I went to church I should not attend , "
92763	92784	92760	92761	Lady Laura	344	" The fresh air would do you more good than anything else , and we could walk across the park . "
92785	92800	92802	92802	she	344	" Thank you ; - I wo n't go out again to - day . "
93334	93339	93340	93340	she	344	" I do declare , "
93343	93382	93340	93340	she	344	" that if Mr. Turnbull opposes the Government measure now , because he ca n't have his own way in everything , I will never again put my trust in any man who calls himself a popular leader . "
93383	93388	93390	93391	Barrington Erle	364	" You never should , "
93393	93438	93390	93391	Barrington Erle	364	" That 's all very well for you , Barrington , who are an aristocratic Whig of the old official school , and who call yourself a Liberal simply because Fox was a Liberal a hundred years ago . My heart 's in it . "
93439	93453	93455	93455	Erle	364	" Heart should never have anything to do with politics ; should it ? "
93547	93558	93559	93559	he	343	" Laura had better not disturb herself about it now , "
93562	93572	93574	93575	Lady Laura	344	" How is a person to help being disturbed ? "
93579	93592	93594	93595	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Well , well ; we wo n't mind all that now , "
93699	93711	93713	93713	he	343	" I am glad that your head is so much better , "
93737	93743	93744	93744	she	344	" Yes ; it is , "
93747	93756	93744	93744	she	344	" Barrington 's coming in cheered me up . "
93757	93768	93724	93724	he	343	" I am sorry that you should have wanted cheering . "
93769	93780	93724	93724	he	343	" Do n't you know what I mean , Robert ? "
93781	93794	93744	93744	she	344	" No ; I do not think that I do , exactly . "
93795	93832	93724	93724	he	343	" I suppose your head is stronger . You do not get that feeling of dazed , helpless imbecility of brain , which hardly amounts to headache , but which yet - is almost as bad . "
93833	93853	93724	93724	he	343	" Imbecility of brain may be worse than headache , but I do n't think it can produce it . "
93854	93869	93724	93724	he	343	" Well , well ; - I do n't know how to explain it . "
93870	93895	93744	93744	she	344	" Headache comes , I think , always from the stomach , even when produced by nervous affections . But imbecility of the brain - "
93896	93911	93724	93724	he	343	" Oh , Robert , I am so sorry that I used the word . "
93912	93923	93924	93924	he	2801	" I see that it did not prevent your reading , "
93931	93945	93924	93924	he	2801	" Not such reading as that . I was up to nothing better . "
93952	93964	93965	93965	he	2801	" I wo n't deny that it may be a prejudice , "
93968	94022	93965	93965	he	2801	" but I confess that the use of novels in my own house on Sundays is a pain to me . My mother 's ideas on the subject are very strict , and I can not think that it is bad for a son to hang on to the teaching of his mother . "
94036	94047	94049	94050	Lady Laura	344	" I do n't know why I took it up , "
94052	94072	94049	94050	Lady Laura	344	" Simply , I believe , because it was there . I will avoid doing so for the future . "
94073	94079	94081	94082	the husband	2242	" Do , my dear , "
94084	94100	94081	94082	the husband	2242	" I shall be obliged and grateful if you will remember what I have said . "
94326	94337	94343	94343	he	463	" How many days do you mean to give us ? "
94354	94362	94364	94364	Phineas	524	" I must go back on Wednesday , "
94366	94418	94364	94364	Phineas	524	" That means Wednesday night . I 'll tell you what we 'll do . We 've the Cottesmore to - morrow . We 'll get into Tailby 's country on Tuesday , and Fitzwilliam will be only twelve miles off on Wednesday . We shall be rather short of horses . "
94419	94438	94343	94343	he	463	" Pray do n't let me put you out . I can hire something here , I suppose ? "
94439	94588	94364	94364	Phineas	524	" You wo n't put me out at all . There 'll be three between us each day , and we 'll run our luck . The horses have gone on to Empingham for to - morrow . Tailby is rather a way off , - at Somerby ; but we 'll manage it . If the worst comes to the worst , we can get back to Stamford by rail . On Wednesday we shall have everything very comfortable . They 're out beyond Stilton and will draw home our way . I 've planned it all out . I 've a trap with a fast stepper , and if we start to - morrow at half - past nine , we shall be in plenty of time . You shall ride Meg Merrilies , and if she do n't carry you , you may shoot her . "
94589	94598	94343	94343	he	463	" Is she one of the pulling ones ? "
94599	94645	94364	94364	Phineas	524	" She is heavy in hand if you are heavy at her , but leave her mouth alone and she 'll go like flowing water . You 'd better not ride more in a crowd than you can help . Now what 'll you drink ? "
94704	94711	94712	94712	he	463	" I 've taken to beer , "
94715	94756	94712	94712	he	463	" as being the best drink going . When a man hunts six days a week he can afford to drink beer . I 'm on an allowance , - three pints a day . That 's not too much . "
94757	94764	94685	94686	Lord Chiltern	463	" And you drink nothing else ? "
94765	94895	94685	94686	Lord Chiltern	463	" Nothing when I 'm alone , - except a little cherry - brandy when I 'm out . I never cared for drink ; - never in my life . I do like excitement , and have been less careful than I ought to have been as to what it has come from . I could give up drink to - morrow , without a struggle , - if it were worth my while to make up my mind to do it . And it 's the same with gambling . I never do gamble now , because I 've got no money ; but I own I like it better than anything in the world . While you are at it , there is life in it . "
94896	94905	94712	94712	he	463	" You should take to politics , Chiltern . "
94906	94941	94685	94686	Lord Chiltern	463	" And I would have done so , but my father would not help me . Never mind , we will not talk about him . How does Laura get on with her husband ? "
94942	94950	94685	94686	Lord Chiltern	463	" Very happily , I should say . "
94951	94958	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" I do n't believe it , "
94963	95035	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" Her temper is too much like mine to allow her to be happy with such a log of wood as Robert Kennedy . It is such men as he who drive me out of the pale of decent life . If that is decency , I 'd sooner be indecent . You mark my words . They 'll come to grief . She 'll never be able to stand it . "
95036	95048	95050	95050	Phineas	524	" I should think she had her own way in everything , "
95052	95079	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" No , no . Though he 's a prig , he 's a man ; and she will not find it easy to drive him . "
95080	95087	94685	94686	Lord Chiltern	463	" But she may bend him . "
95088	95112	94685	94686	Lord Chiltern	463	" Not an inch ; - that is if I understand his character . I suppose you see a good deal of them ? "
95113	95135	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" Yes , - pretty well . I 'm not there so often as I used to be in the Square . "
95136	95156	94685	94686	Lord Chiltern	463	" You get sick of it , I suppose . I should . Do you see my father often ? "
95157	95172	94685	94686	Lord Chiltern	463	" Only occasionally . He is always very civil when I do see him . "
95173	95194	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" He is the very pink of civility when he pleases , but the most unjust man I ever met . "
95195	95203	94685	94686	Lord Chiltern	463	" I should not have thought that . "
95204	95210	95212	95213	the Earl	733	" Yes , he is , "
95217	95322	95212	95213	the Earl	733	" and all from lack of judgment to discern the truth . He makes up his mind to a thing on insufficient proof , and then nothing will turn him . He thinks well of you , - would probably believe your word on any indifferent subject without thought of a doubt ; but if you were to tell him that I did n't get drunk every night of my life and spend most of my time in thrashing policemen , he would not believe you . He would smile incredulously and make you a little bow . I can see him do it . "
95323	95333	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" You are too hard on him , Chiltern . "
95334	95354	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" He has been too hard on me , I know . Is Violet Effingham still in Grosvenor Place ? "
95355	95364	95212	95213	the Earl	733	" No ; she 's with Lady Baldock . "
95365	95399	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" That old grandmother of evil has come to town , - has she ? Poor Violet ! When we were young together we used to have such fun about that old woman . "
95400	95411	95413	95413	Phineas	524	" The old woman is an ally of mine now , "
95415	95428	95413	95413	Phineas	524	" You make allies everywhere . You know Violet Effingham of course ? "
95429	95437	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" Oh yes . I know her . "
95438	95447	95449	95450	Lord Chiltern	463	" Do n't you think her very charming ? "
95452	95456	95449	95450	Lord Chiltern	463	" Exceedingly charming . "
95457	95568	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" I have asked that girl to marry me three times , and I shall never ask her again . There is a point beyond which a man should n't go . There are many reasons why it would be a good marriage . In the first place , her money would be serviceable . Then it would heal matters in our family , for my father is as prejudiced in her favour as he is against me . And I love her dearly . I 've loved her all my life , - since I used to buy cakes for her . But I shall never ask her again . "
95569	95577	95579	95579	Phineas	524	" I would if I were you , "
95594	95679	95579	95579	Phineas	524	" No ; I never will . But I 'll tell you what . I shall get into some desperate scrape about her . Of course she 'll marry , and that soon . Then I shall make a fool of myself . When I hear that she is engaged I shall go and quarrel with the man , and kick him , - or get kicked . All the world will turn against me , and I shall be called a wild beast . "
95680	95693	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" A dog in the manger is what you should be called . "
95694	95721	95722	95722	Phineas	524	" Exactly ; - but how is a man to help it ? If you loved a girl , could you see another man take her ? "
95735	95833	94960	94961	Lord Chiltern	463	" It is as though he were to come and put his hand upon me , and wanted my own heart out of me . Though I have no property in her at all , no right to her , - though she never gave me a word of encouragement , it is as though she were the most private thing in the world to me . I should be half mad , and in my madness I could not master the idea that I was being robbed . I should resent it as a personal interference . "
95834	95849	95851	95851	Phineas	524	" I suppose it will come to that if you give her up yourself , "
95853	95879	95851	95851	Phineas	524	" It is no question of giving up . Of course I can not make her marry me . Light another cigar , old fellow . "
96078	96088	96089	96089	he	524	" You are too sudden with her , Chiltern , "
96096	96105	96107	96108	Lord Chiltern	463	" What do you mean by too sudden ? "
96113	96138	96107	96108	Lord Chiltern	463	" You frighten her by being so impetuous . You rush at her as though you wanted to conquer her by a single blow . "
96139	96144	96089	96089	he	524	" So I do . "
96145	96169	96107	96108	Lord Chiltern	463	" You should be more gentle with her . You should give her time to find out whether she likes you or not . "
96170	96331	96332	96332	Phineas	524	" She has known me all her life , and has found that out long ago . Not but what you are right . I know you are right . If I were you , and had your skill in pleasing , I should drop soft words into her ear till I had caught her . But I have no gifts in that way . I am as awkward as a pig at what is called flirting . And I have an accursed pride which stands in my own light . If she were in this house this moment , and if I knew she were to be had for asking , I do n't think I could bring myself to ask again . But we 'll go to bed . It 's half - past two , and we must be off at half - past nine , if we 're to be at Exton Park gates at eleven . "
96538	96547	96549	96549	Chiltern	463	" It was n't fast , you know , "
96551	96596	96549	96549	Chiltern	463	" and I do n't call that a stiff country . Besides , Meg is very handy when you 've got her out of the crowd . You shall ride Bonebreaker to - morrow at Somerby , and you 'll find that better fun . "
96597	96611	96549	96549	Chiltern	463	" Bonebreaker ? Have n't I heard you say he rushes like mischief ? "
96612	96674	96549	96549	Chiltern	463	" Well , he does rush . But , by George ! you want a horse to rush in that country . When you have to go right through four or five feet of stiff green wood , like a bullet through a target , you want a little force , or you 're apt to be left up a tree . "
96675	96682	96549	96549	Chiltern	463	" And what do you ride ? "
96683	96795	96549	96549	Chiltern	463	" A brute I never put my leg on yet . He was sent down to Wilcox here , out of Lincolnshire , because they could n't get anybody to ride him there . They say he goes with his head up in the air , and wo n't look at a fence that is n't as high as his breast . But I think he 'll do here . I never saw a better made beast , or one with more power . Do you look at his shoulders . He 's to be had for seventy pounds , and these are the sort of horses I like to buy . "
96824	96897	96808	96808	he	463	" There is a set of fellows down here who are poison to me , and there is another set , and I am poison to them . Everybody is very civil , as you see , but I have no associates . And gradually I am getting to have a reputation as though I were the devil himself . I think I shall come out next year dressed entirely in black . "
96898	96912	96802	96803	Lord Chiltern	463	" Are you not wrong to give way to that kind of thing ? "
96913	97044	96808	96808	he	463	" What the deuce am I to do ? I ca n't make civil little speeches . When once a man gets a reputation as an ogre , it is the most difficult thing in the world to drop it . I could have a score of men here every day if I liked it , - my title would do that for me ; - but they would be men I should loathe , and I should be sure to tell them so , even though I did not mean it . Bonebreaker , and the new horse , and another , went on at twelve to - day . You must expect hard work to - morrow , as I daresay we sha n't be home before eight . "
97107	97118	97120	97121	the groom	2847	" We 'll put a gag on ' i m , "
97123	97156	97120	97121	the groom	2847	" and you 'll ride ' i m in a ring , - so that you may well - nigh break his jaw ; but he is a rum un , sir . "
97157	97164	97166	97166	Phineas	524	" I 'll do my best , "
97168	97175	97177	97178	the groom	2847	" He 'll take all that , "
97180	97191	97193	97194	Lord Chiltern	463	" Just let him have his own way at everything , "
97207	97229	97193	97194	Lord Chiltern	463	" and if you 'll only sit on his back , he 'll carry you through as safe as a church . "
97249	97254	97256	97257	Lord Chiltern	463	" My idea is , "
97259	97330	97256	97257	Lord Chiltern	463	" that in hunting you should always avoid a crowd . I do n't think a horse is worth riding that will go in a crowd . It 's just like yachting , - you should have plenty of sea - room . If you 're to pull your horse up at every fence till somebody else is over , I think you 'd better come out on a donkey . "
97446	97453	97455	97456	Lord Chiltern	463	" If he breaks down wind , "
97458	97488	97455	97456	Lord Chiltern	463	" we ca n't be better than we are here . If he goes up wind , he must turn before long , and we shall be all right . "
97526	97538	97540	97541	Lord Chiltern	463	" There are not above eight or nine acres in it , "
97543	97578	97540	97541	Lord Chiltern	463	" and he ca n't hang long . Did you ever see such an uneasy brute as this in your life ? But I feel certain he 'll go well when he gets away . "
97635	97651	97653	97654	Lord Chiltern	463	" He 's a great deal more anxious for it than you and I are , "
97656	97693	97653	97654	Lord Chiltern	463	" I see they 've given you that gag . But do n't you ride him on it till he wants it . Give him lots of room , and he 'll go in the snaffle . "
97734	97745	97747	97748	Lord Chiltern	463	" It 's not a vixen , I 'll swear , "
97750	97775	97747	97748	Lord Chiltern	463	" A vixen in cub never went away like that yet . Now then , Finn , my boy , keep to the right . "
97844	97858	97859	97859	he	463	" Go hard at your fences , and then you 'll fall clear , "
97893	97913	97914	97914	he	463	" The brute began in his own way , and carried on after in the same fashion all through , "
98030	98046	98047	98048	Lord Chiltern	463	" Do n't be in a hurry , and they 'll be round upon us , "
98051	98064	98066	98066	Phineas	329	" How the deuce is one to help being in a hurry ? "
98096	98108	98110	98111	Lord Chiltern	463	" By George , I should like to change with you , "
98793	98796	98768	98768	he	329	" good thing "
99593	99600	99601	99601	he	463	" All right , old fellow , "
99613	99625	99601	99601	he	463	" You go on ; it 's too good to lose . "
99736	99747	99749	99750	Lord Chiltern	463	" That 's the worst one I ever was on , "
99752	99761	99749	99750	Lord Chiltern	463	" but I think he 's gruelled now . "
99762	99767	99749	99750	Lord Chiltern	463	" Are you hurt ? "
99768	99807	99749	99750	Lord Chiltern	463	" Well ; - I fancy there is something amiss . I ca n't move my arms ; and I catch my breath . My legs are all right if I could get away from this accursed brute . "
99808	99814	99816	99817	the farmer	2912	" I told you so , "
99829	99842	99816	99817	the farmer	2912	" I told you so , but you would n't be said . "
99869	99877	99879	99880	the farmer	2912	" That un 's a dead un , "
99887	99893	99895	99896	his lordship	8711	" So much the better , "
99898	99908	99895	99896	his lordship	8711	" Give us a drop of sherry , Finn . "
100008	100021	100023	100024	Lord Chiltern	463	" That was a good run , though , was n't it ? "
100031	100073	100023	100024	Lord Chiltern	463	" And , by George , Phineas , you rode Bonebreaker so well , that you shall have him as often as you 'll come down . I do n't know how it is , but you Irish fellows always ride . "
100569	100597	100551	100552	Mrs. Bunce	333	" He 's that headstrong that he 'll be took if anybody 's took ; and they say that all Westminster is to be lined with soldiers . "
100703	100713	100715	100716	the Earl	733	" Of course he will kill himself some day , "
100729	100750	100715	100716	the Earl	733	" I hope not , my lord . He is a magnificent horseman ; but accidents of course will happen . "
100751	100765	100767	100768	the father	8247	" How many of his bones are there not broken , I wonder ? "
100770	100788	100767	100768	the father	8247	" It is useless to talk , of course . You think he is not in danger ? "
100789	100793	100715	100716	the Earl	733	" Certainly not . "
100794	100807	100767	100768	the father	8247	" I should fear that he would be so liable to inflammation . "
100808	100827	100829	100829	Phineas	329	" The doctor says that there is none . He has been taking an enormous deal of exercise , "
100831	100844	100829	100829	Phineas	329	" and drinking no wine . All that is in his favour . "
100845	100853	100855	100856	the Earl	733	" What does he drink , then ? "
100858	100892	100855	100856	the Earl	733	" Nothing . I rather think , my lord , you are mistaken a little about his habits . I do n't fancy he ever drinks unless he is provoked to do it . "
100893	100932	100767	100768	the father	8247	" Provoked ! Could anything provoke you to make a brute of yourself ? But I am glad that he is in no danger . If you hear of him , let me know how he goes on . "
100942	100951	100952	100952	she	344	" I wanted to go down to him , "
100955	100966	100952	100952	she	344	" but Mr. Kennedy thought that there was no occasion . "
100967	100987	100855	100856	the Earl	733	" Nor is there any ; - I mean in regard to danger . He is very solitary there . "
100988	101039	100855	100856	the Earl	733	" You must go to him again . Mr. Kennedy will not let me go unless I can say that there is danger . He seems to think that because Oswald has had accidents before , it is nothing . Of course I can not leave London without his leave . "
101040	101052	100855	100856	the Earl	733	" Your brother makes very little of it , you know . "
101053	101079	100855	100856	the Earl	733	" Ah ; - he would make little of anything . But if I were ill he would be in London by the first train . "
101080	101091	100855	100856	the Earl	733	" Kennedy would let you go if you asked him . "
101092	101141	101143	101143	she	2964	" But he advises me not to go . He says my duty does not require it , unless Oswald be in danger . Do n't you know , Mr. Finn , how hard it is for a wife not to take advice when it is so given ? "
101184	101200	101202	101203	Lady Laura	344	" I got your letter only this morning , and I have not seen her , "
101205	101222	101202	101203	Lady Laura	344	" Indeed , I am so angry with her that I hardly wish to see her . "
101255	101267	101268	101268	she	341	" I am so glad to see you , Mr. Finn , "
101271	101281	101268	101268	she	341	" Do tell me ; - is it much ? "
101282	101295	101202	101203	Lady Laura	344	" Much in inconvenience , certainly ; but not much in danger . "
101296	101321	101202	101203	Lady Laura	344	" I think Laura was so unkind not to send me word ! I only heard it just now . Did you see it ? "
101322	101351	101268	101268	she	341	" I was close to him , and helped him up . The horse jumped into a river with him , and crushed him up against the bank . "
101352	101367	101202	101203	Lady Laura	344	" How lucky that you should be there ! Had you jumped the river ? "
101368	101405	101202	101203	Lady Laura	344	" Yes ; - almost unintentionally , for my horse was rushing so that I could not hold him . Chiltern was riding a brute that no one should have ridden . No one will again . "
101406	101412	101268	101268	she	341	" Did he destroy himself ? "
101413	101426	101202	101203	Lady Laura	344	" He had to be killed afterwards . He broke his shoulder . "
101427	101455	101202	101203	Lady Laura	344	" How very lucky that you should have been near him , - and , again , how lucky that you should not have been hurt yourself ! "
101456	101473	101268	101268	she	341	" It was not likely that we should both come to grief at the same fence . "
101474	101490	101202	101203	Lady Laura	344	" But it might have been you . And you think there is no danger ? "
101491	101539	101202	101203	Lady Laura	344	" None whatever , - if I may believe the doctor . His hunting is done for this year , and he will be very desolate . I shall go down again to him in a few days , and try to bring him up to town . "
101540	101563	101268	101268	she	341	" Do ; - do . If he is laid up in his father 's house , his father must see him . "
101616	101628	101629	101629	he	425	" What good do you expect to do , Mr. Bunce ? "
101643	101649	101651	101651	Bunce	425	" To carry my point , "
101653	101660	101651	101651	Bunce	425	" And what is your point ? "
101661	101677	101640	101640	his	425	" My present point is the ballot , as a part of the Government measure . "
101678	101735	101640	101640	his	425	" And you expect to carry that by going out into the streets with all the roughs of London , and putting yourself in direct opposition to the authority of the magistrates ? Do you really believe that the ballot will become the law of the land any sooner because you incur this danger and inconvenience ? "
101736	101794	101651	101651	Bunce	425	" Look here , Mr. Finn ; I do n't believe the sea will become any fuller because the Piddle runs into it out of the Dorsetshire fields ; but I do believe that the waters from all the countries is what makes the ocean . I shall help ; and it 's my duty to help . "
101795	101816	101640	101640	his	425	" It 's your duty as a respectable citizen , with a wife and family , to stay at home . "
101817	101906	101640	101640	his	425	" If everybody with a wife and family was to say so , there 'd be none there but roughs , and then where should we be ? What would the Government people say to us then ? If every man with a wife and family was to show hisself in the streets to - night , we should have the ballot before Parliament breaks up , and if none of 'em do n't do it , we shall never have the ballot . Ai n't that so ? "
101929	101935	101937	101937	Bunce	425	" If that 's so , "
101941	101963	101937	101937	Bunce	425	" a man 's duty 's clear enough . He ought to go , though he 'd two wives and families . "
103098	103104	103106	103106	he	339	" How may I dare , "
103108	103264	103106	103106	he	339	" to accept so small a measure of reform as this with such a message from the country as is now conveyed to me through the presence of fifty thousand of my countrymen , who are at this moment demanding their measure of reform just beyond the frail walls of this chamber ? The right honourable gentleman has told us that he will never be intimidated by a concourse of people . I do not know that there was any need that he should speak of intimidation . No one has accused the right honourable gentleman of political cowardice . But , as he has so said , I will follow in his footsteps . Neither will I be intimidated by the large majority which this House presented the other night against the wishes of the people . I will support no great measure of reform which does not include the ballot among its clauses . "
103462	103475	103477	103477	Phineas	329	" I hope he wo n't get home to dinner before midnight , "
103479	103486	103488	103488	Laurence	391	" He understands all about it , "
103490	103532	103488	103488	Laurence	391	" He had a good meal at three , before he left home , and you 'd find sandwiches and sherry in plenty if you were to search his carriage . He knows how to remedy the costs of mob popularity . "
103785	103802	103774	103774	He	339	" Thank you , my friends . I trust you may obtain all your just demands . "
104047	104050	104045	104045	he	3053	" jaw . "
104073	104077	104079	104079	he	3053	" Habeas Corpus , "
104103	104106	104098	104110	the man who talks about " Habeas Corpus " in a political crowd	3060	" Habeas Corpus "
104171	104173	104165	104165	she	947	" took "
104178	104181	104165	104165	she	947	" took . "
104255	104263	104265	104265	Bunce	425	" Keep me , at your peril ! "
104269	104274	104276	104282	the sergeant who had him in custody	3072	" We means it , "
104284	104295	104297	104297	Bunce	425	" I 've done no ha'porth to break the law , "
104299	104317	104319	104320	the sergeant	3074	" You was breaking the law when you was upsetting my men , as I saw you , "
104322	104328	104330	104330	Bunce	425	" I 've upset nobody , "
104332	104336	104338	104339	the sergeant	3074	" Very well , "
104341	104355	104338	104339	the sergeant	3074	" you can say it all before the magistrate , to - morrow . "
104356	104367	104369	104369	Bunce	425	" And am I to be locked up all night ? "
104371	104378	104380	104381	the sergeant	3074	" I 'm afraid you will , "
104438	104444	104446	104446	she	947	" Bunce has been taken , "
104514	104595	104596	104596	Phineas	329	" I knew how it 'd be , Mr. Finn . Did n't I ? And what must we do ? I do n't suppose he 'd had a bit to eat from the moment he went out ; - and as for a drop of beer , he never thinks of it , except what I puts down for him at his meals . Them nasty police always take the best . That 's why I was so afeard . "
104646	104655	104657	104658	Mrs. Bunce	333	" But you might have been took yourself , "
104660	104667	104657	104658	Mrs. Bunce	333	" just as well as he . "
104684	104695	104697	104698	Mrs. Bunce	333	" You might have been took , all the same , "
104700	104712	104697	104698	Mrs. Bunce	333	" for I 'm sure Bunce did n't do nothing amiss . "
104715	104719	104697	104698	Mrs. Bunce	333	" The First Speech "
104931	104935	104974	104975	Mrs. Bunce	333	" Serve them right "
105102	105131	105133	105133	he	532	" When they think that they have public opinion on their side , there is nothing in the way or arbitrary excess which is too great for them . "
105166	105183	105185	105188	the Whig private secretary	3112	" If we do n't keep the mob down , the mob will keep us down , "
105217	105246	105203	105204	Barrington Erle	364	" He was born on that side of the question , and has been receiving Whig wages all his life . That is the history of his politics ! "
105467	105482	105484	105484	Phineas	532	" The man says that he had better not be moved for a month , "
105486	105497	105484	105484	Phineas	532	" But that means nothing . They always say that . "
105498	105512	105514	105515	the Earl	733	" Will it not be best for him to remain where he is ? "
105517	105527	105529	105529	Phineas	532	" He has not a soul to speak to , "
105531	105539	105541	105542	his sister	1119	" I wish I were with him , "
105544	105556	105558	105559	the Earl	733	" That is , of course , out of the question , "
105561	105596	105558	105559	the Earl	733	" They know him at that inn , and it really seems to me best that he should stay there . I do not think he would be so much at his ease here . "
105597	105621	105623	105623	Violet	351	" It must be dreadful for a man to be confined to his room without a creature near him , except the servants , "
105674	105686	105688	105688	Violet	351	" I do so hope he will come up to London , "
105707	105721	105723	105724	Lord Brentford	332	" You do n't know what you are talking about , my dear , "
105887	105900	105902	105903	Lady Laura	344	" It is very hard certainly on a man like Mr. Bunce , "
105905	105919	105921	105922	the Earl	733	" Why did not Mr. Bunce stay at home and mind his business ? "
106326	106332	106334	106334	Bunce	425	" I used no violence , "
106336	106356	106358	106359	the magistrate	9140	" According to your own showing , you endeavoured to make your way up to Mr. Turnbull 's carriage , "
106361	106375	106377	106377	Bunce	425	" I was close to the carriage before the police even saw me , "
106379	106392	106377	106377	Bunce	425	" But you tried to force your way round to the door . "
106393	106447	106358	106359	the magistrate	9140	" I used no force till a man had me by the collar to push me back ; and I was n't violent , not then . I told him I was doing what I had a right to do , - and it was that as made him hang on to me . "
106448	106469	106471	106472	the magistrate	9140	" You were not doing what you had a right to do . You were assisting to create a riot , "
106666	106700	106701	106701	Phineas	329	" You come out strong , Mr. Finn , and we 'll see that you are properly reported . I 'm on the Banner , sir , and I 'll answer for that . "
106757	106766	106768	106768	Phineas	329	" Something ought to be done , certainly , "
106770	106778	106780	106781	the gentleman	3166	" We shall take it up strong , "
106783	106879	106780	106781	the gentleman	3166	" and we shall be happy to have you among us . You 'll find , Mr. Finn , that in public life there 's nothing like having a horgan to back you . What is the most you can do in the ' Ouse ? Nothing , if you 're not reported . You 're speaking to the country ; - ai n't you ? And you ca n't do that without a horgan , Mr. Finn . You come among us on the Banner , Mr. Finn . You ca n't do better . "
106905	106910	106896	106898	the literary gentleman	3172	" Mr. Quintus Slide . "
106927	106936	106937	106939	Mr. Quintus Slide	345	" Banner Office , 137 , Fetter Lane . "

108231	108235	108228	108228	he	329	" go among them "
109327	109334	109336	109337	Mr. Monk	346	" Are you going to walk ? "
109339	109341	109336	109337	Mr. Monk	346	" Yes "
109346	109351	109336	109337	Mr. Monk	346	" I shall walk . "
109352	109367	109368	109368	Phineas	329	" Then we may go together as far as Pall Mall . Come along . "
109403	109410	109412	109413	Mr. Monk	346	" It was not much amiss , "
109415	109425	109412	109413	Mr. Monk	346	" but you 'll do better than that yet . "
109426	109430	109432	109432	Phineas	329	" Mr. Monk , "
109434	109471	109432	109432	Phineas	329	" I have made an ass of myself so thoroughly , that there will at any rate be this good result , that I shall never make an ass of myself again after the same fashion . "
109472	109647	109650	109651	Phineas Discussed	329	" Ah ! - I thought you had some such feeling as that , and therefore I was determined to speak to you . You may be sure , Finn , that I do not care to flatter you , and I think you ought to know that , as far as I am able , I will tell you the truth . Your speech , which was certainly nothing great , was about on a par with other maiden speeches in the House of Commons . You have done yourself neither good nor harm . Nor was it desirable that you should . My advice to you now is , never to avoid speaking on any subject that interests you , but never to speak for above three minutes till you find yourself as much at home on your legs as you are when sitting . But do not suppose that you have made an ass of yourself , - that is , in any special degree . Now , good - night . "
109704	109713	109714	109715	Lady Laura	344	" And you think it was a failure ? "
109721	109748	109714	109715	Lady Laura	344	" It certainly was not a success . There was nothing particular about it . There was a good deal of it you could hardly hear . "
110042	110053	110055	110056	Lady Laura	344	" He seems to have been cheered a good deal , "
110058	110068	110070	110071	Mr. Kennedy	343	" All members are cheered at their first speech , "
110073	110084	110086	110087	Lady Laura	344	" I 've no doubt he 'll do well yet , "
110089	110093	110095	110096	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Very likely , "
110170	110177	110179	110180	the Earl	733	" The less said the better , "
110184	110196	110198	110199	Lady Laura	344	" Do you mean that it was so bad as that ? "
110201	110258	110198	110199	Lady Laura	344	" It was not very bad at first ; - though indeed nobody could say it was very good . But he got himself into a mess about the police and the magistrates before he had done , and nothing but the kindly feeling always shown to a first effort saved him from being coughed down . "
110302	110309	110311	110312	the Earl	733	" Mildmay will lose his bill , "
110316	110328	110311	110312	the Earl	733	" There does not seem to be a doubt about that . "
110329	110337	110339	110340	Lady Laura	344	" And what will you all do ? "
110342	110353	110355	110356	the Earl	733	" We must go to the country , I suppose , "
110358	110377	110379	110380	Lady Laura	344	" What 's the use ? You ca n't have a more liberal House than you have now , "
110382	110450	110379	110380	Lady Laura	344	" We may have one less liberal , - or rather less radical , - with fewer men to support Mr. Turnbull . I do not see what else we can do . They say that there are no less than twenty - seven men on our side of the House who will either vote with Turnbull against us , or will decline to vote at all . "
110451	110462	110464	110465	Lady Laura	344	" Every one of them ought to lose his seat , "
110467	110485	110464	110465	Lady Laura	344	" But what can we do ? How is the Queen 's Government to be carried on ? "
110507	110520	110501	110501	he	733	" I do n't suppose that Mr. Turnbull can form a Ministry . "
110521	110534	110536	110537	Lady Laura	344	" With Mr. Daubeny as whipper - in , perhaps he might , "
110539	110548	110536	110537	Lady Laura	344	" And will Mr. Finn lose his seat ? "
110553	110557	110559	110560	the Earl	733	" Most probably , "
110562	110571	110559	110560	the Earl	733	" He only got it by an accident . "
110572	110583	110585	110585	Violet	351	" You must find him a seat somewhere in England , "
110587	110593	110595	110596	the Earl	733	" That might be difficult , "
110629	110644	110621	110622	Lady Laura	344	" If there be a dissolution , I hope Oswald will stand for Loughton . "
110677	110683	110685	110686	Lady Laura	344	" It is quite time , "
110688	110723	110685	110686	Lady Laura	344	" that old Mr. Standish should give way . He has had the seat for twenty - five years , and has never done anything , and he seldom goes to the House now . "
110724	110734	110779	110780	Lady Laura	344	" He is not your uncle , is he ? "
110735	110761	110685	110686	Lady Laura	344	" No ; he is papa 's cousin ; but he is ever so much older than papa ; - nearly eighty , I believe . "
110762	110774	110776	110776	Violet	351	" Would not that be just the place for Mr. Finn ? "
110785	110800	110779	110780	Lady Laura	344	" Oswald would of course have a better right to it than anybody else . "
110801	110820	110685	110686	Lady Laura	344	" But would Lord Chiltern go into Parliament ? I have heard him declare that he would not . "
110821	110839	110841	110842	Lady Laura	344	" If we could get papa to ask him , I think he would change his mind , "
110865	110889	110855	110855	Violet	351	" It would be a thousand pities that Mr. Finn should be turned out into the cold . Do n't you think so ? "
110890	110901	110685	110686	Lady Laura	344	" I , for one , should be very sorry . "
110902	111017	110685	110686	Lady Laura	344	" So should I , - and the more so from what Lord Brentford says about his not speaking well last night . I do n't think that it is very much of an accomplishment for a gentleman to speak well . Mr. Turnbull , I suppose , speaks well ; and they say that that horrid man , Mr. Bonteen , can talk by the hour together . I do n't think that it shows a man to be clever at all . But I believe Mr. Finn would do it , if he set his mind to it , and I shall think it a great shame if they turn him out . "
111018	111032	110685	110686	Lady Laura	344	" It would depend very much , I suppose , on Lord Tulla . "
111033	111043	111045	111045	Violet	351	" I do n't know anything about Lord Tulla , "
111047	111091	111045	111045	Violet	351	" but I 'm quite sure that he might have Loughton , if we manage it properly . Of course Lord Chiltern should have it if he wants it , but I do n't think he will stand in Mr. Finn 's way . "
111092	111103	111105	111106	Lady Laura	344	" I 'm afraid it 's out of the question , "
111110	111119	111105	111106	Lady Laura	344	" Papa thinks so much about the borough . "
111155	111176	111178	111178	Violet	351	" Those difficult things have always to be talked of for a long while , and then they become easy , "
111180	111217	111178	111178	Violet	351	" I believe if you were to propose to Mr. Kennedy to give all his property to the Church Missionaries and emigrate to New Zealand , he 'd begin to consider it seriously after a time . "
111218	111228	111270	111270	she	344	" I shall not try , at any rate . "
111229	111253	111178	111178	Violet	351	" Because you do n't want to go to New Zealand ; - but you might try about Loughton for poor Mr. Finn . "
111254	111257	111259	111260	Lady Laura	344	" Violet , "
111274	111287	111270	111270	she	344	" Violet , I believe you are in love with Mr. Finn . "
111288	111297	111270	111270	she	344	" That 's just like you , Laura . "
111298	111333	111270	111270	she	344	" I never made such an accusation against you before , or against anybody else that I can remember . But I do begin to believe that you are in love with Mr. Finn . "
111334	111349	111270	111270	she	344	" Why should n't I be in love with him , if I like ? "
111350	111366	111270	111270	she	344	" I say nothing about that ; - only he has not got a penny . "
111367	111375	111270	111270	she	344	" But I have , my dear . "
111376	111395	111270	111270	she	344	" And I doubt whether you have any reason for supposing that he is in love with you . "
111396	111406	111270	111270	she	344	" That would be my affair , my dear . "
111407	111416	111270	111270	she	344	" Then you are in love with him ? "
111417	111424	111270	111270	she	344	" That is my affair also . "
111431	111475	111428	111428	her	344	" Of course it is ; and if you tell me to hold my tongue , of course I will do so . If you ask me whether I think it a good match , of course I must say I do not . "
111476	111530	111270	111270	she	344	" I do n't tell you to hold your tongue , and I do n't ask you what you think about the match . You are quite welcome to talk as much about me as you please ; - but as to Mr. Phineas Finn , you have no business to think anything . "
111531	111541	111270	111270	she	344	" I should n't talk to anybody but yourself . "
111542	111576	111428	111428	her	344	" I am growing to be quite indifferent as to what people say . Lady Baldock asked me the other day whether I was going to throw myself away on Mr. Laurence Fitzgibbon . "
111577	111580	111270	111270	she	344	" No ! "
111581	111586	111270	111270	she	344	" Indeed she did . "
111587	111594	111428	111428	her	344	" And what did you answer ? "
111595	111686	111270	111270	she	344	" I told her that it was not quite settled ; but that as I had only spoken to him once during the last two years , and then for not more than half a minute , and as I was n't sure whether I knew him by sight , and as I had reason to suppose he did n't know my name , there might , perhaps , be a delay of a week or two before the thing came off . Then she flounced out of the room . "
111687	111697	111270	111270	she	344	" But what made her ask about Mr. Fitzgibbon ? "
111698	111814	111815	111816	Lady Laura	344	" Somebody had been hoaxing her . I am beginning to think that Augusta does it for her private amusement . If so , I shall think more highly of my dear cousin than I have hitherto done . But , Laura , as you have made a similar accusation against me , and as I can not get out of it with you as I do with my aunt , I must ask you to hear my protestation . I am not in love with Mr. Phineas Finn . Heaven help me ; - as far as I can tell , I am not in love with any one , and never shall be . "
111820	111825	111827	111827	Violet	341	" Do you know , "
111829	111852	111827	111827	Violet	341	" that I think I could be in love with Mr. Phineas Finn , if I could be in love with anybody ? "
111859	111870	111872	111872	Violet	341	" In the first place , he is a gentleman , "
111874	111995	111872	111872	Violet	341	" Then he is a man of spirit . And then he has not too much spirit ; - not that kind of spirit which makes some men think that they are the finest things going . His manners are perfect ; - not Chesterfieldian , and yet never offensive . He never browbeats any one , and never toadies any one . He knows how to live easily with men of all ranks , without any appearance of claiming a special status for himself . If he were made Archbishop of Canterbury to - morrow , I believe he would settle down into the place of the first subject in the land without arrogance , and without false shame . "
111996	112005	111854	111855	Lady Laura	344	" You are his eulogist with a vengeance . "
112006	112081	112133	112134	Lady Laura	344	" I am his eulogist ; but I am not in love with him . If he were to ask me to be his wife to - morrow , I should be distressed , and should refuse him . If he were to marry my dearest friend in the world , I should tell him to kiss me and be my brother . As to Mr. Phineas Finn , - those are my sentiments . "
112082	112090	111872	111872	Violet	341	" What you say is very odd . "
112091	112095	112133	112134	Lady Laura	344	" Why odd ? "
112096	112104	112133	112134	Lady Laura	344	" Simply because mine are the same . "
112105	112132	111872	111872	Violet	341	" Are they the same ? I once thought , Laura , that you did love him ; - that you meant to be his wife . "
112291	112298	112300	112301	Lady Laura	344	" So I did , nearly - "
112303	112338	112300	112301	Lady Laura	344	" very nearly . You told me just now that you had money , and could therefore do as you pleased . I had no money , and could not do as I pleased . "
112339	112358	112254	112254	she	344	" And you told me also that I had no reason for thinking that he cared for me . "
112359	112384	112254	112254	she	344	" Did I ? Well ; - I suppose you have no reason . He did care for me . He did love me . "
112385	112391	112300	112301	Lady Laura	344	" He told you so ? "
112392	112401	112254	112254	she	344	" Yes ; - he told me so . "
112402	112410	112254	112254	she	344	" And how did you answer him ? "
112411	112428	112254	112254	she	344	" I had that very morning become engaged to Mr. Kennedy . That was my answer . "
112429	112440	112254	112254	she	344	" And what did he say when you told him ? "
112441	112458	112254	112254	she	344	" I do not know . I can not remember . But he behaved very well . "
112459	112478	112254	112254	she	344	" And now , - if he were to love me , you would grudge me his love ? "
112479	112504	112254	112254	she	344	" Not for that reason , - not if I know myself . Oh no ! I would not be so selfish as that . "
112505	112511	112254	112254	she	344	" For what reason then ? "
112512	112531	112254	112254	she	344	" Because I look upon it as written in heaven that you are to be Oswald 's wife . "
112532	112540	112542	112542	Violet	341	" Heaven 's writings then are false , "
112907	112910	112912	112912	she	2338	" Sir , "
112914	112921	112912	112912	she	2338	" there 's that gentleman there . "
112922	112926	112934	112934	Phineas	329	" What gentleman ? "
112927	112932	112912	112912	she	2338	" The old gentleman . "
112986	112992	112994	112994	Phineas	329	" Damn the old gentleman , "
113147	113165	113144	113144	his	517	" Very bad , Mr. Finn ; very bad indeed ; very bad , ai n't it ? "
113166	113183	113185	113185	Phineas	329	" You coming here in this way at all times in the day is very bad , "
113187	113210	113185	113185	Phineas	329	" And where would you have me go ? Would you like to see me down in the lobby of the House ? "
113211	113230	113144	113144	his	517	" To tell you the truth , Mr. Clarkson , I do n't want to see you anywhere . "
113231	113272	113185	113185	Phineas	329	" Ah ; yes ; I daresay ! And that 's what you call honest , being a Parliament gent ! You had my money , and then you tell me you do n't want to see me any more ! "
113273	113281	113283	113283	Phineas	329	" I have not had your money , "
113285	113292	113294	113295	Mr. Clarkson	517	" But let me tell you , "
113297	113318	113294	113295	Mr. Clarkson	517	" that I want to see you ; - and shall go on seeing you till the money is paid . "
113319	113329	113331	113331	Phineas	329	" I 've not had any of your money , "
113349	113353	113355	113355	he	517	" Mr. Finn , "
113361	113367	113355	113355	he	517	" is that your name ? "
113368	113374	113294	113295	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Yes , it is . "
113375	113382	113355	113355	he	517	" Then I want my money . "
113383	113392	113294	113295	Mr. Clarkson	517	" I have no money to give you . "
113393	113420	113294	113295	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Do be punctual now . Why ai n't you punctual ? I 'd do anything for you if you were punctual . I would indeed . "
113460	113464	113466	113466	Phineas	329	" Mr. Clarkson , "
113468	113482	113466	113466	Phineas	329	" I can not ask you to breakfast here . I am engaged . "
113483	113498	113500	113500	Clarkson	517	" I 'll just take a bit of bread and butter all the same , "
113502	113542	113500	113500	Clarkson	517	" Where do you get your butter ? Now I could tell you a woman who 'd give it you cheaper and a deal better than this . This is all lard . Shall I send her to you ? "
113543	113546	113548	113548	Phineas	329	" No , "
113570	113574	113576	113576	Phineas	329	" After this , "
113578	113606	113576	113576	Phineas	329	" I must beg , Mr. Clarkson , that you will never come to my room any more . I shall not be at home to you . "
113607	113620	113622	113623	Mr. Clarkson	517	" The lobby of the House is the same thing to me , "
113625	113649	113622	113623	Mr. Clarkson	517	" They know me there well . I wish you 'd be punctual , and then we 'd be the best of friends . "
113876	113886	113888	113888	Ratler	417	" There are two men doubtful in the House , "
113890	113917	113888	113888	Ratler	417	" and if one votes on one side and one on the other , or if neither votes at all , it will be a tie . "
114260	114300	114301	114301	Phineas	329	" Drat the reformers , I say . And I wish there was no Parliament ; so I do . What 's the use of all the voting , when it means nothing but dry bread and cross words ? "
114445	114458	114460	114461	Mr. Low	399	" Have you asked yourself what is your object , Mr. Bunce ? "
114483	114492	114494	114495	Mr. Low	399	" In the shape of compensation to yourself , "
114520	114526	114528	114529	Mr. Low	399	" Is it for vengeance ? "
114543	114550	114552	114553	Mr. Low	399	" It ought not to be , "
114555	114586	114552	114553	Mr. Low	399	" because , though you think that the man exceeded in his duty , you must feel that he was doing so through no personal ill - will to yourself . "
114587	114603	114605	114606	Mr. Bunce	425	" What I want is , to have the fellows kept in their proper places , "
114608	114661	114605	114606	Mr. Bunce	425	" Exactly ; - and therefore these things , when they occur , are mentioned in the press and in Parliament , - and the attention of a Secretary of State is called to them . Thank God , we do n't have very much of that kind of thing in England . "
114662	114676	114678	114678	Bunce	425	" Maybe we shall have more if we do n't look to it , "
114681	114689	114691	114692	Mr. Low	399	" We always are looking to it , "
114695	114763	114691	114692	Mr. Low	399	" looking to it very carefully . But I do n't think anything is to be done in that way by indictment against a single man , whose conduct has been already approved by the magistrates . If you want notoriety , Mr. Bunce , and do n't mind what you pay for it ; or have got anybody else to pay for it ; then indeed - "
114764	114774	114776	114776	Bunce	425	" There ai n't nobody to pay for it , "
114781	114796	114798	114799	Mr. Low	399	" Then I certainly should not pay for it myself if I were you , "
114830	114839	114841	114843	the law scrivener	3362	" He do n't know what patriotism means , "
114845	114945	114841	114843	the law scrivener	3362	" And then he talks to me about notoriety ! It has always been the same way with 'em . If a man shows a spark of public feeling , it 's all hambition . I do n't want no notoriety . I wants to earn my bread peaceable , and to be let alone when I 'm about my own business . I pays rates for the police to look after rogues , not to haul folks about and lock 'em up for days and nights , who is doing what they has a legal right to do . "
115105	115115	115116	115116	he	3373	" We go in for it , Mr. Finn , "
115328	115330	115327	115330	a " horgan "	9267	" horgan "
115380	115399	115401	115402	Mr. Slide	345	" I always look upon the ' Ouse as my oyster , and ' ere 's my sword , "
115410	115456	115401	115402	Mr. Slide	345	" And I feel that if once there I could get along . I do indeed . What is it a man wants ? It 's only pluck , - that he should n't funk because a ' undred other men are looking at him . "
115915	115924	115926	115928	the horrible man	3410	" About that little bill , Mr. Finn , "
115939	115954	115926	115928	the horrible man	3410	" They always tell me at your lodgings that you ai n't at home . "
115987	115993	115995	115996	Mr. Clarkson	517	" I know all that , "
116000	116023	115995	115996	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Of course I do . But what is a man to do when a gent wo n't see him at home ? "
116782	116790	116792	116793	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Singular enough , is it not , "
116795	116805	116792	116793	Mr. Turnbull	339	" that the thing should have been so close ? "
116806	116810	116812	116813	Mr. Monk	346	" Very odd , "
116815	116829	116812	116813	Mr. Monk	346	" but men have said that it would be so all the week . "
116830	116836	116838	116839	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Gresham was very fine , "
116841	116856	116838	116839	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Very fine , indeed . I never have heard anything like it before . "
116857	116864	116866	116867	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Daubeny was very powerful too , "
116869	116898	116866	116867	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Yes ; - no doubt . The occasion was great , and he answered to the spur . But Gresham 's was the speech of the debate . "
116899	116909	116911	116912	Mr. Turnbull	339	" Well ; - yes ; perhaps it was , "
117207	117210	117211	117211	he	329	" Laurence , "
117226	117241	117211	117211	he	329	" I want to speak to you for a moment , if you please . "
117242	117246	117248	117248	Laurence	391	" Speak away , "
117303	117307	117308	117308	He	329	" little bill . "
117364	117380	117382	117382	Phineas	329	" Just give me your arm , and come on with me for a minute , "
117384	117390	117382	117382	Phineas	329	" Erle will excuse us . "
117391	117396	117398	117398	Laurence	391	" Oh , blazes ! "
117400	117434	117398	117398	Laurence	391	" what is it you 're after ? I ai n't good at private conferences at three in the morning . We 're all out , and is n't that enough for ye ? "
117435	117445	117447	117447	Phineas	329	" I have been dreadfully annoyed to - night , "
117449	117460	117447	117447	Phineas	329	" and I wished to speak to you about it . "
117461	117485	117486	117486	Phineas	329	" Bedad , Finn , my boy , and there are a good many of us are annoyed ; - eh , Barrington ? "
117523	117548	117398	117398	Laurence	391	" My annoyance comes from your friend , Mr. Clarkson , who had the impudence to address me in the lobby of the House . "
117549	117639	117447	117447	Phineas	329	" And serve you right , too , Finn , my boy . Why the devil did you sport your oak to him ? He has told me all about it . There ai n't such a patient little fellow as Clarkson anywhere , if you 'll only let him have his own way . He 'll look in , as he calls it , three times a week for a whole season , and do nothing further . Of course he do n't like to be locked out . "
117640	117654	117655	117655	Erle	364	" Is that the gentleman with whom the police interfered in the lobby ? "
117658	117678	117680	117680	Phineas	329	" A confounded bill discounter to whom our friend here has introduced me , - for his own purposes , "
117682	117690	117692	117692	Laurence	391	" A very gentleman - like fellow , "
117694	117733	117692	117692	Laurence	391	" Barrington knows him , I daresay . Look here , Finn , my boy , take my advice . Ask him to breakfast , and let him understand that the house will always be open to him . "
120152	120165	120167	120168	the Duke	1449	" It is not so bad as I thought it would be , "
120182	120188	120190	120191	Mr. Mildmay	334	" It was bad enough , "
120195	120200	120202	120204	Sir Marmaduke Morecombe	544	" Bad enough indeed , "
120210	120218	120220	120221	Lord Plinlimmon	549	" And such a good bill lost , "
120223	120243	120220	120221	Lord Plinlimmon	549	" The worst of these failures is , that the same identical bill can never be brought in again . "
120244	120267	120269	120271	the Lord Chancellor	3530	" So that if the lost bill was best , the bill that will not be lost can only be second best , "
120273	120295	120297	120298	Mr. Mildmay	334	" I certainly did think that after the debate before Easter we should not have come to shipwreck about the ballot , "
120300	120309	120297	120298	Mr. Mildmay	334	" It was brewing for us all along , "
120398	120408	120410	120412	Sir Marmaduke Morecombe	544	" I am afraid it was brewing all along , "
120415	120429	120431	120432	Mr. Mildmay	334	" Well , gentlemen , we must take it as we get it , "
120437	120450	120431	120432	Mr. Mildmay	334	" And now we must consider what we shall do at once . "
120493	120505	120507	120508	the Duke	1449	" We can not stay where we are , of course , "
120553	120556	120558	120559	Mr. Mildmay	334	" No , "
120561	120582	120558	120559	Mr. Mildmay	334	" I suppose that we can hardly stay where we are . Probably none of us wish it , gentlemen . "
120635	120643	120651	120651	he	334	" We have two things to consider , "
120668	120795	120651	120651	he	334	" two things chiefly , that is ; the work of the country and the Queen 's comfort . I propose to see her Majesty this afternoon at five , - that is , in something less than two hours ' time , and I hope to be able to tell the House by seven what has taken place between her Majesty and me . My friend , his Grace , will do as much in the House of Lords . If you agree with me , gentlemen , I will explain to the Queen that it is not for the welfare of the country that we should retain our places , and I will place your resignations and my own in her Majesty 's hands . "
120796	120809	120811	120812	Mr. Gresham	431	" You will advise her Majesty to send for Lord de Terrier , "
120814	120828	120811	120812	Mr. Gresham	431	" Certainly ; - there will be no other course open to me . "
120829	120834	120836	120837	Mr. Gresham	431	" Or to her , "
120932	120947	120949	120950	Mr. Mildmay	334	" Times change so much , and with the times the feelings of men , "
120988	121083	120981	120982	Mr. Mildmay	334	" Of course it may be possible that my Lord de Terrier may foresee difficulties , or may find difficulties which will oblige him , either at once , or after an attempt has been made , to decline the task which her Majesty will probably commit to him . All of us , no doubt , know that the arrangement of a government is not the most easy task in the world ; and that it is not made the more easy by an absence of a majority in the House of Commons . "
121084	121092	121094	121095	the Duke	1449	" He would dissolve , I presume , "
121097	121103	121105	121106	Mr. Mildmay	334	" I should say so , "
121108	121248	121105	121106	Mr. Mildmay	334	" But it may not improbably come to pass that her Majesty will feel herself obliged to send again for some one or two of us , that we may tender to her Majesty the advice which we owe to her ; - for me , for instance , or for my friend the Duke . In such a matter she would be much guided probably by what Lord de Terrier might have suggested to her . Should this be so , and should I be consulted , my present feeling is that we should resume our offices so that the necessary business of the session should be completed , and that we should then dissolve Parliament , and thus ascertain the opinion of the country . In such case , however , we should of course meet again . "
121249	121265	121267	121268	the Duke	1449	" I quite think that the course proposed by Mr. Mildmay will be the best , "
121339	121354	121356	121357	Lord Cantrip	552	" He has as much idea of giving up as you or I have , "
121386	121397	121399	121400	Mr. Gresham	431	" I am not sure that he is not right , "
121402	121413	121415	121416	Lord Cantrip	552	" Do you mean for himself or for the country ? "
121418	121485	121486	121486	They	3651	" For his future fame . They who have abdicated and have clung to their abdication have always lost by it . Cincinnatus was brought back again , and Charles V. is felt to have been foolish . The peaches of retired ministers of which we hear so often have generally been cultivated in a constrained seclusion ; - or at least the world so believes . "
121820	121833	121835	121836	Lady Laura	344	" It is impossible to say whether he is pleased or not , "
121844	121852	121835	121836	Lady Laura	344	" I am pleased , of course . "
121853	121860	121862	121862	Phineas	329	" His ambition must be gratified , "
121864	121874	121876	121877	Lady Laura	344	" It would be , if he had any , "
121879	121890	121876	121877	Lady Laura	344	" I do not believe in a man lacking ambition . "
121891	121944	121945	121947	The old men	3663	" It is hard to say . There are men who by no means wear their hearts upon their sleeves , and my husband is one of them . He told me that it would be unbecoming in him to refuse , and that was all he said to me about it . "
122305	122316	122318	122320	Sir Harry Coldfoot	543	" No man ought ever to pledge himself to anything , "
122326	122334	122318	122320	Sir Harry Coldfoot	543	" that is , to anything unnecessary . "
122422	122438	122440	122441	Mr. Slide	345	" You had better come over to us , Mr. Finn ; you had indeed , "
122443	122485	122440	122441	Mr. Slide	345	" Now 's the time to do it , and show yourself a people 's friend . You 'll have to do it sooner or later , - whether or no . Come to us and we 'll be your horgan . "
122594	122606	122607	122607	Bunce	425	" I do n't know that I like having a Lord , "
122614	122627	122607	122607	Bunce	425	" It 'll soon come to you not liking anybody decent anywhere , "
122633	122670	122628	122629	Mrs. Bunce	333	" but I sha n't ask any questions about it . When you 're wasting so much time and money at your dirty law proceedings , it 's well that somebody should earn something at home . "
122765	122775	122776	122777	Lord Chiltern	463	" I think I shall leave those diggings altogether , "
122782	122804	122776	122777	Lord Chiltern	463	" My father annoys me by everything he says and does , and I annoy him by saying and doing nothing . "
122857	122871	122873	122873	he	329	" There is some reason for my going to my father 's house , "
122875	122914	122873	122873	he	329	" though he and I are not the best friends in the world ; but there can be no reason for my going to the house of a man I dislike so much as I do Robert Kennedy . "
122951	122957	122958	122958	he	329	" I 've sold Bonebreaker , "
122962	123003	122958	122958	he	329	" to a young fellow whose neck will certainly be the sacrifice if he attempts to ride him . I 'd have given him to you , Phineas , only you would n't have known what to do with him . "
123139	123158	123159	123159	Violet	351	" And would you have me tell my aunt , or would you have me not tell her ? "
123162	123173	123159	123159	Violet	351	" I would have you do just as you pleased , "
123178	123183	123184	123184	Violet	351	" So I shall , "
123187	123213	123184	123184	Violet	351	" but I will do nothing that I should be ashamed to tell any one . Your brother professes to be in love with me . "
123214	123222	123224	123225	Lady Laura	344	" He is in love with you , "
123227	123238	123224	123225	Lady Laura	344	" Even you do not pretend to doubt his faith . "
123239	123315	123184	123184	Violet	351	" Very well . In those circumstances a girl should not go to a man 's rooms unless she means to consider herself as engaged to him , even with his sister ; - not though he had broken every bone in his skin . I know what I may do , Laura , and I know what I may n't ; and I wo n't be led either by you or by my aunt . "
123316	123324	123224	123225	Lady Laura	344	" May I give him your love ? "
123325	123377	123224	123225	Lady Laura	344	" No ; - because you 'll give it in a wrong spirit . He knows well enough that I wish him well ; - but you may tell him that from me , if you please . He has from me all those wishes which one friend owes to another . "
123415	123424	123426	123426	Violet	351	" Tell him to take care of himself , "
123428	123476	123426	123426	Violet	351	" and bid him not to have any more of those wild brutes that are not fit for any Christian to ride . Tell him that I say so . It 's a great thing to be brave ; but what 's the use of being foolhardy ? "
124410	124415	124417	124418	the man	7504	" Dash it all , "
124420	124439	124417	124418	the man	7504	" did n't yer see as how I was a - hurrying up to help the gen'leman myself ? "
124476	124486	124488	124489	the policeman	7388	" You 've done it uncommon neat , sir , "
124497	124520	124488	124489	the policeman	7388	" If the gen'leman ai n't none the worst for it , it 'll have been a very pretty evening 's amusement . "
124835	124844	124845	124845	he	329	" Of course you must see my wife , "
124895	124901	124903	124905	the Cabinet Minister	3115	" I have been garrotted , "
124910	124913	124903	124905	the Cabinet Minister	3115	" What ? "
124914	124940	124941	124942	The wife	7469	" Simply that ; - or should have been , if he had not been there . How he came there , God only knows . "
125005	125026	125028	125028	Phineas	329	" I had seen the men , and thought it best to run round by the corner of Grosvenor Square , "
125030	125036	125038	125039	Lady Laura	344	" May God bless you , "
125041	125044	125046	125048	the Cabinet Minister	3115	" Amen , "
125050	125061	125063	125064	Lady Laura	344	" I think he was born to be my friend , "
125201	125204	125206	125207	Lord Chiltern	463	" Garrotted ! "
125242	125247	125223	125223	He	329	" Robert Kennedy garrotted ! "
125248	125259	125206	125207	Lord Chiltern	463	" The fellow was in the act of doing it . "
125260	125266	125206	125207	Lord Chiltern	463	" And you stopped him ? "
125267	125283	125223	125223	He	329	" Yes ; - I got there just in time . Was n't it lucky ? "
125284	125305	125206	125207	Lord Chiltern	463	" You ought to be garrotted yourself . I should have lent the man a hand had I been there . "
125306	125333	125206	125207	Lord Chiltern	463	" How can you say anything so horrible ? But you are drinking too much , old fellow , and I shall lock the bottle up . "
125334	125383	125223	125223	He	329	" If there were no one in London drank more than I do , the wine merchants would have a bad time of it . And so the new Cabinet Minister has been garrotted in the street . Of course I 'm sorry for poor Laura 's sake . "
125384	125401	125206	125207	Lord Chiltern	463	" Luckily he 's not much the worse for it ; - only a little bruised . "
125402	125484	125206	125207	Lord Chiltern	463	" I wonder whether it 's on the cards he should be improved by it ; - worse , except in the way of being strangled , he could not be . However , as he 's my brother - in - law , I 'm obliged to you for rescuing him . Come , I 'll go to bed . I must say , if he was to be garrotted I should like to have been there to see it . "
125600	125603	125605	125606	Laurence Fitzgibbon	391	" Bedad , "
125615	125629	125605	125606	Laurence Fitzgibbon	391	" that fellow'll marry an heiress , and be Secretary for Oireland yet . "
125662	125681	125654	125655	Violet Effingham	351	" Why , what a Paladin you are ! But you succour men in distress instead of maidens . "
125682	125689	125691	125691	Phineas	329	" That 's my bad luck , "
125693	125703	125691	125691	Phineas	329	" The other will come no doubt in time , "
125707	125716	125704	125704	Violet	351	" and then you 'll get your reward . "
125747	125762	125763	125764	Lady Laura	344	" Of course you will come to us at Loughlinter when Parliament is up ? "
125770	125791	125763	125764	Lady Laura	344	" I do n't know really . You see I must go over to Ireland about my re - election . "
125792	125845	125763	125764	Lady Laura	344	" What has that to do with it ? You are only making out excuses . We go down on the first of July , and the English elections wo n't begin till the middle of the month . It will be August before the men of Loughshane are ready for you . "
125846	125856	125858	125858	Phineas	329	" To tell you the truth , Lady Laura , "
125860	125886	125858	125858	Phineas	329	" I doubt whether the men of Loughshane , - or rather the man of Loughshane , will have anything more to say to me . "
125887	125894	125763	125764	Lady Laura	344	" What man do you mean ? "
125895	125965	125763	125764	Lady Laura	344	" Lord Tulla . He was in a passion with his brother before , and I got the advantage of it . Since that he has paid his brother 's debts for the fifteenth time , and of course is ready to fight any battle for the forgiven prodigal . Things are not as they were , and my father tells me that he thinks I shall be beaten . "
125966	125972	125858	125858	Phineas	329	" That is bad news . "
125973	125984	125763	125764	Lady Laura	344	" It is what I have a right to expect . "
126526	126536	126538	126538	Phineas	329	" If I find a chance , I will , "
126736	126745	126747	126748	Mr. Daubeny	393	" As a god out of a machine , "
126754	126766	126768	126769	Mr. Mildmay	334	" By no means as a god out of a machine , "
126771	126815	126768	126769	Mr. Mildmay	334	" but as a real help in a very real trouble , and succeeded not only in saving my right honourable friend , the Chancellor of the Duchy , but in arresting the two malefactors who attempted to rob him in the street . "
126822	126825	126827	126828	Mr. Mildmay	334	" name ; "
127401	127450	127392	127392	he	354	" You see , doctor , your son has had it for two years , as you may say for nothing , and I think he ought to give way . He ca n't expect that he 's to go on there as though it were his own . "
127482	127488	127489	127489	he	827	" I told the Earl , "
127492	127619	127489	127489	he	827	" that I could not undertake to say what you might do ; but that as you had come forward at first with my sanction , I could not withdraw it now . He asked me if I should support you with money ; I said that I should to a moderate extent . ' By G - - , ' said the Earl , ' a moderate extent will go a very little way , I can tell you . ' Since that he has had Duggin with him ; so , I suppose , I shall not see him any more . You can do as you please now ; but , from what I hear , I fear you will have no chance . "
127830	127834	127805	127805	his	343	" potted peas , "
127921	127930	127932	127932	Phineas	329	" What does the doctor say about it ? "
128054	128066	128068	128068	Phineas	329	" I do n't think they ever do kill the people , "
128070	128082	128068	128068	Phineas	329	" At any rate they do n't mean to do so . "
128083	128089	128091	128092	Lady Laura	344	" I thought they did , "
128094	128099	128101	128101	Phineas	329	" I fancy not , "
128110	128119	128121	128122	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I think this man was very clumsy , "
128124	128131	128133	128133	Phineas	329	" Perhaps he was a beginner , "
128135	128156	128133	128133	Phineas	329	" and that may make a difference . If so , I 'm afraid we have interfered with his education . "
128178	128190	128192	128192	he	329	" I 've made up my mind to give it up , "
128199	128210	128212	128213	Lady Laura	344	" I was afraid there was but a bad chance , "
128218	128226	128228	128228	Phineas	329	" My father has behaved so well ! "
128230	128299	128228	128228	Phineas	329	" He has written to say he 'll find the money , if I determine to contest the borough . I mean to write to him by to - night 's post to decline the offer . I have no right to spend the money , and I should n't succeed if I did spend it . Of course it makes me a little down in the mouth . "
128306	128316	128318	128319	Lady Laura	344	" I 've got a plan of my own , "
128321	128325	128318	128319	Lady Laura	344	" What plan ? "
128326	128360	128420	128420	his	343	" Or rather it is n't mine , but papa 's . Old Mr. Standish is going to give up Loughton , and papa wants you to come and try your luck there . "
128361	128365	128318	128319	Lady Laura	344	" Lady Laura ! "
128366	128390	128318	128319	Lady Laura	344	" It is n't quite a certainty , you know , but I suppose it 's as near a certainty as anything left . "
128400	128415	128318	128319	Lady Laura	344	" Lady Laura , I could n't accept such a favour from your father . "
128427	128432	128420	128420	his	343	" Yes , yes . "
128433	128441	128443	128444	Phineas Finn	329	" I could n't think of it , "
128446	128456	128443	128444	Phineas Finn	329	" I have no right to such a favour . "
128457	128468	128470	128471	Lady Laura	344	" That is a matter entirely for papa 's consideration , "
128482	128542	128479	128479	her	344	" I think it has always been felt that any politician may accept such an offer as that when it is made to him , but that no politician should ask for it . My father feels that he has to do the best he can with his influence in the borough , and therefore he comes to you . "
128543	128549	128551	128551	Phineas	329	" It is n't that , "
128556	128565	128567	128568	Lady Laura	344	" Of course private feelings have their weight , "
128570	128628	128567	128568	Lady Laura	344	" It is not probable that papa would have gone to a perfect stranger . And perhaps , Mr. Finn , I may own that Mr. Kennedy and I would both be very sorry that you should not be in the House , and that that feeling on our part has had some weight with my father . "
128629	128636	128638	128639	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Of course you 'll stand ? "
128669	128682	128684	128685	Lady Laura	344	" Papa has desired me to ask you to call upon him , "
128687	128728	128684	128685	Lady Laura	344	" I do n't suppose there is very much to be said , as each of you know so well the other 's way of thinking . But you had better see him to - day or to - morrow . "
129126	129133	129135	129136	Lord Chiltern	463	" Do not scruple about me , "
129138	129149	129135	129136	Lord Chiltern	463	" you are quite welcome to the borough for me . "
129150	129180	129135	129136	Lord Chiltern	463	" But if I did not stand , would you do so ? There are so many reasons which ought to induce you to accept a seat in Parliament ! "
129181	129260	129135	129136	Lord Chiltern	463	" Whether that be true or not , Phineas , I shall not accept my father 's interest at Loughton , unless it be offered to me in a way in which it never will be offered . You know me well enough to be sure that I shall not change my mind . Nor will he . And , therefore , you may go down to Loughton with a pure conscience as far as I am concerned . "
129482	129494	129496	129497	the Earl	733	" I do not say that there will be no opposition , "
129499	129505	129496	129497	the Earl	733	" but I expect none . "
129887	129904	129905	129905	Fitzgibbon	391	" You had better let him sit in your armchair for half an hour or so , "
130015	130026	130027	130028	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Think of my time and trouble in coming here , "
130039	130055	130027	130028	Mr. Clarkson	517	" Think of my time and trouble , and do be punctual , Mr. Finn . "
130173	130190	130191	130191	she	3925	" You 'll be very much surprised at my coming to your chambers , no doubt , "
130230	130258	130224	130224	he	329	" Pretty well , I thank you . I have just come about a little business , Mr. Finn , and I hope you 'll excuse me . "
130259	130272	130274	130274	Phineas	329	" I 'm quite sure that there is no need for excuses , "
130276	130329	130274	130274	Phineas	329	" Laurence , when he hears about it , will say that I 've been an impertinent old fool ; but I never care what Laurence says , either this way or that . I 've been to that Mr. Clarkson , Mr. Finn , and I 've paid him the money . "
130330	130333	130335	130335	Phineas	329	" No ! "
130337	130362	130335	130335	Phineas	329	" But I have , Mr. Finn . I happened to hear what occurred that night at the door of the House of Commons . "
130363	130371	130274	130274	Phineas	329	" Who told you , Miss Fitzgibbon ? "
130372	130439	130335	130335	Phineas	329	" Never mind who told me . I heard it . I knew before that you had been foolish enough to help Laurence about money , and so I put two and two together . It is n't the first time I have had to do with Mr. Clarkson . So I sent to him , and I 've bought the bill . There it is . "
130459	130473	130441	130442	Miss Fitzgibbon	401	" And did you pay him two hundred and fifty pounds for it ? "
130474	130497	130274	130274	Phineas	329	" Not quite . I had a very hard tussle , and got it at last for two hundred and twenty pounds . "
130498	130506	130274	130274	Phineas	329	" And did you do it yourself ? "
130507	130555	130559	130559	he	329	" All myself . If I had employed a lawyer I should have had to pay two hundred and forty pounds and five pounds for costs . And now , Mr. Finn , I hope you wo n't have any more money engagements with my brother Laurence . "
130571	130647	130559	130559	he	329	" Because , if you do , I sha n't interfere . If Laurence began to find that he could get money out of me in that way , there would be no end to it . Mr. Clarkson would very soon be spending his spare time in my drawing - room . Good - bye , Mr. Finn . If Laurence says anything , just tell him that he 'd better come to me . "
130924	130933	130934	130934	one	1102	" Of course we must support the Earl , "
130937	130951	130934	130934	one	1102	" Never mind what you hear about a Tory candidate , Mr. Finn , "
130956	130966	130934	130934	one	1102	" the Earl can do what he pleases here . "
131234	131241	131243	131246	the man of business	3967	" They 'd all like it , "
131248	131296	131243	131246	the man of business	3967	" and I daresay they 'll have enough of it when this Reform Bill is passed ; but at present no one will be fool enough to come and spend his money here . We have them all in hand too well for that , Mr. Finn ! "
132656	132665	132667	132668	Lady Laura	344	" You are often here , I suppose ? "
132681	132706	132667	132668	Lady Laura	344	" Well ; - yes ; not very often ; I come here sometimes because the view down upon the lake is so fine . "
132707	132752	132773	132774	Lady Laura	344	" It is the prettiest spot about the place . I hardly ever get here now . Indeed this is only the second time that I have been up since we have been at home , and then I came to bring papa here . "
132843	132849	132850	132850	she	344	" How well I remember , "
132853	132865	132850	132850	she	344	" the day when you and I were here last autumn ! "
132866	132890	132831	132832	Lady Laura	344	" So do I. You told me then that you were going to marry Mr. Kennedy . How much has happened since then ! "
132891	132910	132850	132850	she	344	" Much indeed ! Enough for a whole lifetime . And yet how slow the time has gone ! "
132911	132923	132925	132925	Phineas	329	" I do not think it has been slow with me , "
132927	132962	132925	132925	Phineas	329	" No ; you have been active . You have had your hands full of work . I am beginning to think that it is a great curse to have been born a woman . "
132963	132982	132850	132850	she	344	" And yet I have heard you say that a woman may do as much as a man . "
132983	133038	132925	132925	Phineas	329	" That was before I had learned my lesson properly . I know better than that now . Oh dear ! I have no doubt it is all for the best as it is , but I have a kind of wish that I might be allowed to go out and milk the cows . "
133039	133055	132850	132850	she	344	" And may you not milk the cows if you wish it , Lady Laura ? "
133056	133085	132925	132925	Phineas	329	" By no means ; - not only not milk them , but hardly look at them . At any rate , I must not talk about them . "
133158	133166	133167	133168	Lady Laura	344	" It was so different at Saulsby , "
133171	133180	133167	133168	Lady Laura	344	" Everything there seemed to be my own . "
133181	133189	133167	133168	Lady Laura	344	" And everything here is your own . "
133190	133223	133167	133168	Lady Laura	344	" Yes , - according to the prayer - book . And everything in truth is my own , - as all the dainties at the banquet belonged to Sancho the Governor . "
133224	133228	133230	133230	he	329	" You mean , "
133238	133265	133235	133235	he	329	" you mean that Mr. Kennedy stands over you , guarding you for your own welfare , as the doctor stood over Sancho and guarded him ? "
133319	133327	133328	133328	she	344	" The truth is , my friend , "
133331	133339	133328	133328	she	344	" that I have made a mistake . "
133340	133344	133328	133328	she	344	" A mistake ? "
133345	133403	133419	133419	She	344	" Yes , Phineas , a mistake . I have blundered as fools blunder , thinking that I was clever enough to pick my footsteps aright without asking counsel from any one . I have blundered and stumbled and fallen , and now I am so bruised that I am not able to stand upon my feet . "
133580	133588	133589	133589	he	329	" You mean that you are unhappy ? "
133601	133646	133589	133589	he	329	" Yes , I do mean that . Though I do not know why I should come and tell you so , - except that I am still blundering and stumbling , and have fallen into a way of hurting myself at every step . "
133647	133661	133663	133663	Phineas	329	" You can tell no one who is more anxious for your happiness , "
133665	133720	133663	133663	Phineas	329	" That is a very pretty speech , but what would you do for my happiness ? Indeed , what is it possible that you should do ? I mean it as no rebuke when I say that my happiness or unhappiness is a matter as to which you will soon become perfectly indifferent . "
133721	133731	133589	133589	he	329	" Why should you say so , Lady Laura ? "
133732	133776	133589	133589	he	329	" Because it is natural that it should be so . You and Mr. Kennedy might have been friends . Not that you will be , because you are unlike each other in all your ways . But it might have been so . "
133777	133788	133789	133789	he	329	" And are not you and I to be friends ? "
133792	133844	133789	133789	he	329	" No . In a very few months you will not think of telling me what are your desires or what your sorrows ; - and as for me , it will be out of the question that I should tell mine to you . How can you be my friend ? "
133845	133871	133873	133873	he	329	" If you were not quite sure of my friendship , Lady Laura , you would not speak to me as you are speaking now . "
134172	134175	134176	134176	she	4035	" Phineas , "
134181	134215	134176	134176	she	4035	" I have in you such perfect confidence that I will tell you the truth ; - as one man may tell it to another . I wish you would go from here . "
134216	134222	134155	134156	her Phoebus	4049	" What , at once ? "
134223	134304	134176	134176	she	4035	" Not to - day , or to - morrow . Stay here now till the election ; but do not return . He will ask you to come , and press you hard , and will be hurt ; - for , strange to say , with all his coldness , he really likes you . He has a pleasure in seeing you here . But he must not have that pleasure at the expense of trouble to me . "
134305	134315	134316	134316	he	4051	" And why is it a trouble to you ? "
134363	134370	134371	134371	she	4054	" Because I am a fool , "
134374	134385	134371	134371	she	4054	" Why else ? Is not that enough for you ? "
134386	134390	134391	134391	he	4051	" Laura - , "
134394	134429	134371	134371	she	4054	" No , - no ; I will have none of that . I am a fool , but not such a fool as to suppose that any cure is to be found there . "
134430	134454	134371	134371	she	4054	" Only say what I can do for you , though it be with my entire life , and I will do it . "
134455	134469	134371	134371	she	4054	" You can do nothing , - except to keep away from me . "
134470	134479	134371	134371	she	4054	" Are you earnest in telling me that ? "
134528	134534	134536	134536	Phineas	329	" Here is Mr. Kennedy , "
134550	134555	134557	134558	Lady Laura	344	" So I perceive , "
134654	134664	134665	134665	he	404	" I am glad that your headache is better , "
134696	134705	134706	134706	she	947	" I came out because it was worse , "
134709	134724	134706	134706	she	947	" It irritated me so that I could not stand the house any longer . "
134725	134735	134706	134706	she	947	" I will send to Callender for Dr. Macnuthrie . "
134736	134755	134706	134706	she	947	" Pray do nothing of the kind , Robert . I do not want Dr. Macnuthrie at all . "
134756	134768	134706	134706	she	947	" Where there is illness , medical advice is always expedient . "
134769	134781	134706	134706	she	947	" I am not ill . A headache is not illness . "
134782	134789	134791	134792	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I had thought it was , "
134797	134810	134791	134792	Mr. Kennedy	343	" At any rate , I would rather not have Dr. Macnuthrie . "
134811	134841	134706	134706	she	947	" I am sure it can not do you any good to climb up here in the heat of the sun . Had you been here long , Finn ? "
134842	134867	134706	134706	she	947	" All the morning ; - here , or hereabouts . I clambered up from the lake and had a book in my pocket . "
134868	134879	134880	134881	Mr. Kennedy	343	" And you happened to come across him by accident ? "
134903	134910	134912	134913	Lady Laura	344	" Yes ; - by chance , "
134915	134945	134912	134913	Lady Laura	344	" But every one at Loughlinter always comes up here . If any one ever were missing whom I wanted to find , this is where I should look . "
134946	134958	134960	134961	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I am going on towards Linter forest to meet Blane , "
134968	135015	134963	134963	Blane	566	" If you do n't mind the trouble , Finn , I wish you 'd take Lady Laura down to the house . Do not let her stay out in the heat . I will take care that somebody goes over to Callender for Dr. Macnuthrie . "
135189	135197	135198	135198	he	329	" Does your head still pain you ? "
135201	135207	135198	135198	he	329	" Of course it does . "
135208	135226	135151	135152	Lady Laura	344	" I suppose he is right in saying that you should not be out in the heat . "
135227	135273	135151	135152	Lady Laura	344	" I do not know . It is not worth while to think about that . He sends me in , and so of course I must go . And he tells you to take me , and so of course you must take me . "
135274	135286	135198	135198	he	329	" Would you wish that I should let you go alone ? "
135287	135317	135151	135152	Lady Laura	344	" Yes , I would . Only he will be sure to find it out ; and you must not tell him that you left me at my request . "
135318	135329	135331	135331	Phineas	329	" Do you think that I am afraid of him ? "
135333	135375	135331	135331	Phineas	329	" Yes ; - I think you are . I know that I am , and that papa is ; and that his mother hardly dares to call her soul her own . I do not know why you should escape . "
135376	135384	135198	135198	he	329	" Mr. Kennedy is nothing to me . "
135385	135457	135198	135198	he	329	" He is something to me , and so I suppose I had better go on . And now I shall have that horrid man from the little town pawing me and covering everything with snuff , and bidding me take Scotch physic , - which seems to increase in quantity and nastiness as doses in England decrease . And he will stand over me to see that I take it . "
135458	135467	135331	135331	Phineas	329	" What ; - the doctor from Callender ? "
135468	135585	135198	135198	he	329	" No ; - but Mr. Kennedy will . If he advised me to have a hole in my glove mended , he would ask me before he went to bed whether it was done . He never forgot anything in his life , and was never unmindful of anything . That I think will do , Mr. Finn . You have brought me out from the trees , and that may be taken as bringing me home . We shall hardly get scolded if we part here . Remember what I told you up above . And remember also that it is in your power to do nothing else for me . Good - bye . "
135826	135834	135836	135837	the Earl	733	" I shall follow you almost immediately , "
135854	135883	135836	135837	the Earl	733	" I do n't like to be there just when the election is going on , but I 'll be at Saulsby to receive you the day afterwards . "
135994	136004	136006	136007	her husband	968	" I wonder what it is that ails you , "
136471	136481	136483	136484	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I wonder what it is that ails you , "
136486	136502	136483	136484	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Nothing serious . One ca n't always help having a headache , you know . "
136503	136545	136717	136717	he	4101	" I do n't think you take enough exercise , Laura . I would propose that you should walk four miles every day after breakfast . I will always be ready to accompany you . I have spoken to Dr. Macnuthrie - "
136546	136552	136483	136484	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I hate Dr. Macnuthrie . "
136553	136563	136483	136484	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Why should you hate Dr. Macnuthrie , Laura ? "
136564	136589	136717	136717	he	4101	" How can I tell why ? I do . That is quite reason enough why you should not send for him to me . "
136590	136618	136483	136484	Mr. Kennedy	343	" You are unreasonable , Laura . One chooses a doctor on account of his reputation in his profession , and that of Dr. Macnuthrie stands high . "
136619	136627	136483	136484	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I do not want any doctor . "
136628	136638	136717	136717	he	4101	" But if you are ill , my dear - "
136639	136645	136483	136484	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I am not ill . "
136646	136665	136483	136484	Mr. Kennedy	343	" But you said you had a headache . You have said so for the last ten days . "
136666	136695	136483	136484	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Having a headache is not being ill . I only wish you would not talk of it , and then perhaps I should get rid of it . "
136696	136715	136717	136717	he	4101	" I can not believe that . Headache in nine cases out of ten comes from the stomach . "
136773	136781	136783	136784	Lady Laura	344	" It is nothing of that sort , "
136798	136831	136783	136784	Lady Laura	344	" Then what is it ? You can not think that I can be happy to hear you complaining of headache every day , - making it an excuse for absolute idleness . "
136832	136843	136844	136844	she	344	" What is it that you want me to do ? "
136853	136904	136844	136844	she	344	" Set me a task , and if I do n't go mad over it , I 'll get through it . There are the account books . Give them to me . I do n't suppose I can see the figures , but I 'll try to see them . "
136905	136918	136783	136784	Lady Laura	344	" Laura , this is unkind of you , - and ungrateful . "
136919	136956	136958	136958	she	344	" Of course ; - it is everything that is bad . What a pity that you did not find it out last year ! Oh dear , oh dear ! what am I to do ? "
136976	136986	136988	136989	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I will send for Dr. Macnuthrie at once , "
137006	137015	137016	137016	she	344	" No ; - do no such thing , "
137033	137064	137065	137065	she	344	" If he comes I will not see him . I give you my word that I will not speak to him if he comes . You do not understand , "
137068	137076	137065	137065	she	344	" you do not understand at all . "
137077	137087	137088	137088	he	343	" What is it that I ought to understand ? "
137091	137102	137103	137103	He	343	" That a woman does not like to be bothered . "
137125	137128	137130	137130	he	343	" Yes , "
137134	137229	137130	137130	he	343	" I am beginning to find that out ; - and to find out also what it is that bothers a woman , as you call it . I can see now what it is that makes your head ache . It is not the stomach . You are quite right there . It is the prospect of a quiet decent life , to which would be attached the performance of certain homely duties . Dr. Macnuthrie is a learned man , but I doubt whether he can do anything for such a malady . "
137230	137243	137130	137130	he	343	" You are quite right , Robert ; he can do nothing . "
137244	137275	137130	137130	he	343	" It is a malady you must cure for yourself , Laura ; - and which is to be cured by perseverance . If you can bring yourself to try - "
137276	137288	137289	137289	she	4102	" But I can not bring myself to try at all , "
137292	137316	137289	137289	she	4102	" Do you mean to tell me , Laura , that you will make no effort to do your duty as my wife ? "
137317	137373	137374	137374	He	4103	" I mean to tell you that I will not try to cure a headache by doing sums . That is all that I mean to say at this moment . If you will leave me for awhile , so that I may lie down , perhaps I shall be able to come to dinner . "
137386	137395	137396	137396	she	4102	" But if you go on scolding me , "
137399	137414	137396	137396	she	4102	" what I shall do is to go to bed directly you go away . "
137678	137687	137689	137693	the great man of Loughton	4119	" So you had no opponent after all , "
137700	137708	137689	137693	the great man of Loughton	4119	" Not the ghost of another candidate . "
137709	137767	137771	137771	he	329	" I did not think there would be . They have tried it once or twice and have always failed . There are only one or two in the place who like to go one way just because their neighbours go the other . But , in truth , there is no conservative feeling in the place ! "
137835	137844	137846	137846	Phineas	329	" They all seemed to be very obliging , "
137854	137945	137846	137846	Phineas	329	" Yes , they are . There is n't a house in the town , you know , let for longer than seven years , and most of them merely from year to year . And , do you know , I have n't a farmer on the property with a lease , - not one ; and they do n't want leases . They know they 're safe . But I do like the people round me to be of the same way of thinking as myself about politics . "
138029	138035	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" I am almost afraid , "
138040	138048	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" that Laura is not happy there . "
138049	138055	138057	138057	Phineas	329	" I hope she is , "
138059	138123	138057	138057	Phineas	329	" He is so hard and dry , and what I call exacting . That is just the word for it . Now Laura has never been used to that . With me she always had her own way in everything , and I always found her fit to have it . I do not understand why her husband should treat her differently . "
138124	138134	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" Perhaps it is the temper of the man . "
138135	138219	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" Temper , yes ; but what a bad prospect is that for her ! And she , too , has a temper , and so he will find if he tries her too far . I can not stand Loughlinter . I told Laura so fairly . It is one of those houses in which a man can not call his hours his own . I told Laura that I could not undertake to remain there for above a day or two . "
138220	138226	138228	138228	Phineas	329	" It is very sad , "
138230	138299	138228	138228	Phineas	329	" Yes , indeed ; it is sad for her , poor girl ; and very sad for me too . I have no one else but Laura , - literally no one ; and now I am divided from her ! It seems that she has been taken as much away from me as though her husband lived in China . I have lost them both now ! "
138300	138308	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" I hope not , my lord . "
138309	138355	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" I say I have . As to Chiltern , I can perceive that he becomes more and more indifferent to me every day . He thinks of me only as a man in his way who must die some day and may die soon . "
138356	138364	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" You wrong him , Lord Brentford . "
138365	138404	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" I do not wrong him at all . Why has he answered every offer I have made him with so much insolence as to make it impossible for me to put myself into further communion with him ? "
138405	138414	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" He thinks that you have wronged him . "
138415	138453	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" Yes ; - because I have been unable to shut my eyes to his mode of living . I was to go on paying his debts , and taking no other notice whatsoever of his conduct ! "
138454	138465	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" I do not think he is in debt now . "
138466	138538	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" Because his sister the other day spent every shilling of her fortune in paying them . She gave him L40,000 ! Do you think she would have married Kennedy but for that ? I do n't . I could not prevent her . I had said that I would not cripple my remaining years of life by raising the money , and I could not go back from my word . "
138539	138550	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" You and Chiltern might raise the money between you . "
138551	138590	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" It would do no good now . She has married Mr. Kennedy , and the money is nothing to her or to him . Chiltern might have put things right by marrying Miss Effingham if he pleased . "
138591	138600	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" I think he did his best there . "
138601	138676	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" No ; - he did his worst . He asked her to be his wife as a man asks for a railway - ticket or a pair of gloves , which he buys with a price ; and because she would not jump into his mouth he gave it up . I do n't believe he even really wanted to marry her . I suppose he has some disreputable connection to prevent it . "
138677	138706	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" Nothing of the kind . He would marry her to - morrow if he could . My belief is that Miss Effingham is sincere in refusing him . "
138707	138715	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" I do n't doubt her sincerity . "
138716	138724	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" And that she will never change . "
138725	138781	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" Ah , well ; I do n't agree with you , and I daresay I know them both better than you do . But everything goes against me . I had set my heart upon it , and therefore of course I shall be disappointed . What is he going to do this autumn ? "
138782	138788	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" He is yachting now . "
138789	138796	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" And who are with him ? "
138797	138807	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" I think the boat belongs to Captain Colepepper . "
138808	138875	138037	138038	Lord Brentford	332	" The greatest blackguard in all England ! A man who shoots pigeons and rides steeple - chases ! And the worst of Chiltern is this , that even if he did n't like the man , and if he were tired of this sort of life , he would go on just the same because he thinks it a fine thing not to give way . "
138895	138902	138904	138905	the Earl	733	" I had some faint hope , "
138907	138945	138904	138905	the Earl	733	" while Laura could always watch him ; because , in his way , he was fond of his sister . But that is all over now . She will have enough to do to watch herself ! "
139004	139015	139016	139016	he	329	" They are to be at Loughlinter on the tenth , "
139019	139035	139016	139016	he	329	" and she purposes to come here for a couple of nights on her way . "
139036	139042	138979	138980	Lord Brentford	332	" Lady Baldock and all ? "
139043	139111	139159	139159	Phineas	329	" Well , yes ; Lady Baldock and all . I am not very fond of Lady Baldock , but I will put up with her for a couple of days for the sake of having Violet . She is more like a child of my own now than anybody else . I shall not see her all the autumn afterwards . I can not stand Loughlinter . "
139112	139123	139016	139016	he	329	" It will be better when the house is full . "
139124	139133	138979	138980	Lord Brentford	332	" You will be there , I suppose ? "
139134	139143	139145	139145	Phineas	329	" Well , no ; I think not , "
139147	139158	139145	139145	Phineas	329	" You have had enough of it , have you ? "
139170	139181	139183	139184	the Earl	733	" By Jove , I do n't wonder at it , "
139227	139234	139236	139237	the Earl	733	" I suppose you were asked ? "
139239	139256	139236	139237	the Earl	733	" Oh , yes , I was asked . Nothing can be kinder than they are . "
139257	139271	139236	139237	the Earl	733	" Kennedy told me that you were coming as a matter of course . "
139272	139280	139282	139282	Phineas	329	" I explained to him after that , "
139284	139318	139282	139282	Phineas	329	" that I should not return . I shall go over to Ireland . I have a deal of hard reading to do , and I can get through it there without interruption . "
140225	140229	140230	140230	He	329	" dear Finn . "
140260	140263	140256	140256	he	329	" dear Finn "
140314	140318	140308	140308	He	329	" dear Slide ; "
140345	140349	140308	140308	He	329	" dear Sir . "
140382	140390	140392	140392	Phineas	329	" I suppose you 're very busy , "
140411	140431	140392	140392	Phineas	329	" Not so particular but what I 'm glad to see you . You shoot , do n't you ? "
140432	140435	140437	140437	Phineas	329	" Shoot ! "
140462	140473	140475	140476	Mr. Slide	345	" Grouse and pheasants , and them sort of things ? "
140478	140492	140475	140476	Mr. Slide	345	" Oh , ah ; I understand . Yes , I shoot sometimes . "
140493	140505	140475	140476	Mr. Slide	345	" Is it the 12th or 20th for grouse in Scotland ? "
140506	140510	140512	140512	Phineas	329	" The 12th , "
140514	140523	140512	140512	Phineas	329	" What makes you ask that just now ? "
140524	140601	140602	140602	Phineas	329	" I 'm doing a letter about it , - advising men not to shoot too many of the young birds , and showing that they 'll have none next year if they do . I had a fellow here just now who knew all about it , and he put down a lot ; but I forgot to make him tell me the day of beginning . What 's a good place to date from ? "
140608	140630	140602	140602	Phineas	329	" Stirling 's too much of a town , is n't it ? Callender sounds better for game , I think . "
140673	140680	140681	140681	he	345	" Well , now , Finn , "
140684	140698	140681	140681	he	345	" do n't you know that you 've treated me badly about Loughton ? "
140699	140706	140707	140707	Phineas	329	" Treated you badly about Loughton ! "
140752	140756	140758	140759	Mr. Slide	345	" Very badly , "
140767	140813	140762	140762	his	345	" very badly indeed ! Men on the press together do expect that they 're to be stuck by , and not thrown over . Damn it , I say ; what 's the good of a brotherhood if it ai n't to be brotherhood ? "
140814	140827	140829	140829	Phineas	329	" Upon my word , I do n't know what you mean , "
140831	140845	140847	140847	Quintus	345	" Did n't I tell you that I had Loughton in my heye ? "
140849	140854	140847	140847	Quintus	345	" Oh - h ! "
140855	140875	140762	140762	his	345	" It 's very well to say ho , and look guilty , but did n't I tell you ? "
140876	140886	140762	140762	his	345	" I never heard such nonsense in my life . "
140887	140890	140847	140847	Quintus	345	" Nonsense ? "
140891	140921	140762	140762	his	345	" How on earth could you have stood for Loughton ? What interest would you have there ? You could not even have found an elector to propose you . "
140922	141014	140762	140762	his	345	" Now , I 'll tell you what I 'll do , Finn . I think you have thrown me over most shabby , but I wo n't stand about that . You shall have Loughton this session if you 'll promise to make way for me after the next election . If you 'll agree to that , we 'll have a special leader to say how well Lord What's - his - name has done with the borough ; and we 'll be your horgan through the whole session . "
141015	141056	140847	140847	Quintus	345	" I never heard such nonsense in my life . In the first place , Loughton is safe to be in the schedule of reduced boroughs . It will be thrown into the county , or joined with a group . "
141057	141070	140762	140762	his	345	" I 'll stand the chance of that . Will you agree ? "
141071	141129	140762	140762	his	345	" Agree ! No ! It 's the most absurd proposal that was ever made . You might as well ask me whether I would agree that you should go to heaven . Go to heaven if you can , I should say . I have not the slightest objection . But it 's nothing to me . "
141130	141134	141136	141137	Quintus Slide	345	" Very well , "
141139	141185	141136	141137	Quintus Slide	345	" Very well ! Now we understand each other , and that 's all that I desire . I think that I can show you what it is to come among gentlemen of the press , and then to throw them over . Good morning . "
141220	141224	141136	141137	Quintus Slide	345	" dear Finn , "
141734	141762	141731	141732	Lord Brentford	332	" If you see my father , tell him that I am ready at any moment to do what is necessary for raising the money for Laura . "
141793	141809	141780	141781	the Earl	733	" What , Finn ; is this you ? I thought you were in Ireland . "
141810	141821	141823	141823	he	329	" Not yet , my lord , as you see . "
142028	142041	142043	142044	the Earl	733	" Let him come here , and she shall be here also , "
142276	142296	142264	142265	The Earl	733	" The Baldock people are all here , you know , but they go very early to - morrow . "
142422	142425	142426	142426	he	329	" Now , "
142429	142436	142426	142426	he	329	" I must speak of myself : "
142461	142467	142468	142468	he	329	" I have loved her , "
142471	142625	142468	142468	he	329	" for six months , and I am here with the express intention of asking her to take me . The chances are ten to one that she refuses me . I do not deprecate your anger , - if you choose to be angry . But I am endeavouring to treat you well , and I ask you to do the same by me . I must convey to you your father 's message , and after doing so I can not address myself to Miss Effingham without telling you . I should feel myself to be false were I to do so . In the event , - the probable , nay , almost certain event of my being refused , - I shall trust you to keep my secret . Do not quarrel with me if you can help it ; - but if you must I will be ready . "
142832	142846	142848	142849	the Earl	733	" I can mount you , Finn , if you would like it , "
142851	142859	142861	142861	Violet	341	" Of course he 'll like it , "
142863	142890	142861	142861	Violet	341	" do you suppose Mr. Finn will object to ride with me in Saulsby Woods ? It wo n't be the first time , will it ? "
142891	142894	142896	142897	Lady Baldock	341	" Violet , "
142899	142909	142896	142897	Lady Baldock	341	" you have the most singular way of talking . "
142910	142916	142918	142918	Violet	341	" I suppose I have , "
142920	142943	142918	142918	Violet	341	" but I do n't think I can change it now . Mr. Finn knows me too well to mind it much . "
143358	143368	143370	143370	Violet	341	" You remember this place , do you not ? "
143380	143397	143398	143398	Phineas	329	" I must go round by the woodman 's cottage . You wo n't mind coming ? "
143416	143422	143401	143401	he	329	" Where is she going ? "
143524	143535	143537	143537	Violet	341	" I always come here when I am at Saulsby , "
143539	143552	143537	143537	Violet	341	" that I may teach myself to think kindly of Lord Chiltern . "
143553	143559	143561	143561	Phineas	329	" I understand it all , "
143563	143600	143561	143561	Phineas	329	" He used to be so nice ; - and is so still , I believe , only that he has taught himself to be so rough . Will he ever change , do you think ? "
143616	143641	143561	143561	Phineas	329	" I think he would be changed altogether if we could bring him here , - so that he should live among his friends . "
143642	143671	143675	143675	he	329	" Do you think he would ? We must put our heads together , and do it . Do n't you think that it is to be done ? "
143683	143696	143697	143697	he	329	" I 'll tell you the truth at once , Miss Effingham , "
143700	143710	143697	143697	he	329	" You can do it by a single word . "
143711	143717	143718	143718	she	4250	" Yes ; - yes ; "
143721	143751	143718	143718	she	4250	" but I do not mean that ; - without that . It is absurd , you know , that a father should make such a condition as that . "
143842	143846	143847	143847	she	4250	" Mr. Finn , "
143850	143860	143847	143847	she	4250	" I wonder whether I may ask a question ? "
143861	143865	143866	143866	he	329	" Any question , "
143869	143880	143847	143847	she	4250	" Is there any quarrel between you and Lady Laura ? "
143881	143884	143847	143847	she	4250	" None . "
143885	143892	143847	143847	she	4250	" Or between you and him ? "
143893	143906	143847	143847	she	4250	" No ; - none . We are greater allies than ever . "
143907	143932	143933	143933	He	329	" Then why are you not going to be at Loughlinter ? She has written to me expressly saying you would not be there . "
143941	143947	143948	143948	he	329	" It did not suit , "
143953	143960	143948	143948	he	329	" It is a secret then ? "
143961	143977	143847	143847	she	4250	" Yes ; - it is a secret . You are not angry with me ? "
143978	143983	143847	143847	she	4250	" Angry ; no . "
143984	144003	143847	143847	she	4250	" It is not a secret of my own , or I should not keep it from you . "
144004	144011	144012	144012	she	4252	" Perhaps I can guess it , "
144015	144030	144012	144012	she	4252	" But I will not try . I will not even think of it . "
144031	144062	143847	143847	she	4250	" The cause , whatever it be , has been full of sorrow to me . I would have given my left hand to have been at Loughlinter this autumn . "
144063	144071	144086	144086	He	329	" Are you so fond of it ? "
144072	144082	144083	144083	he	329	" I should have been staying there with you , "
144128	144173	144119	144119	her	4252	" When I found how it must be , and that I must miss you , I rushed down here that I might see you for a moment . And now I am here I do not dare to speak to you of myself . "
144214	144225	144226	144226	he	329	" Have you not a word to say to me ? "
144229	144238	144239	144239	she	351	" No ; - no ; - no ; "
144242	144267	144239	144239	she	351	" not a word when you speak to me like that . There is the carriage . Come ; - we will join them . "
144289	144297	144299	144300	Miss Effingham	351	" I have done my devotions now , "
144302	144312	144299	144300	Miss Effingham	351	" and am ready to return to ordinary life . "
144641	144644	144627	144627	She	351	" no ; "
145253	145259	145261	145262	his sister	1119	" I think , Phineas , "
145264	145294	145261	145262	his sister	1119	" we had better say nothing about dear Mary . She is not here at present , and probably you may not see her while you remain with us . "
145295	145302	145303	145303	Phineas	329	" What 's all that about ? "
145928	145938	145940	145942	the old doctor	827	" She could n't have done better with it , "
145944	145964	145940	145942	the old doctor	827	" and as far as we are concerned , the windfall is the more pleasant as being wholly unexpected . "
146095	146105	146106	146106	he	827	" It comes to the same thing , Phineas , "
146109	146163	146106	146106	he	827	" What you have of your share now you ca n't have hereafter . As regards my present income , it has only made me work a little longer than I had intended ; and I believe that the later in life a man works , the more likely he is to live . "
146370	146376	146378	146379	the Duke	1449	" Do n't pledge yourself , "
147312	147328	147329	147329	he	346	" You do not ask a child whether he would like to learn his lesson , "
147333	147349	147329	147329	he	346	" At any rate , you do not wait till he cries for his book . "
148880	148888	148890	148891	Mr. Low	399	" It is just the usual claptrap , "
148893	148904	148890	148891	Mr. Low	399	" only put into language somewhat more grandiloquent than usual . "
148905	148908	148910	148910	Phineas	571	" Claptrap ! "
148912	148922	148924	148925	Mrs. Low	331	" It 's what I call downright Radical nonsense , "
148932	148961	148928	148928	her	331	" Portrait indeed ! Why should we want to have a portrait of ignorance and ugliness ? What we all want is to have things quiet and orderly . "
148962	148974	148976	148976	Phineas	571	" Then you 'd better have a paternal government at once , "
148978	148982	148984	148985	Mr. Low	399	" Just so , "
148988	149036	148984	148985	Mr. Low	399	" only that what you call a paternal government is not always quiet and orderly . National order I take to be submission to the law . I should not think it quiet and orderly if I were sent to Cayenne without being brought before a jury . "
149037	149051	149053	149053	Phineas	571	" But such a man as you would not be sent to Cayenne , "
149055	149167	149053	149053	Phineas	571	" My next - door neighbour might be , - which would be almost as bad . Let him be sent to Cayenne if he deserves it , but let a jury say that he has deserved it . My idea of government is this , - that we want to be governed by law and not by caprice , and that we must have a legislature to make our laws . If I thought that Parliament as at present established made the laws badly , I would desire a change ; but I doubt whether we shall have them better from any change in Parliament which Reform will give us . "
149168	149173	149175	149176	Mrs. Low	331	" Of course not , "
149178	149200	149175	149176	Mrs. Low	331	" But we shall have a lot of beggars put on horseback , and we all know where they ride to . "
149407	149410	149411	149411	he	404	" Women , "
149414	149432	149411	149411	he	404	" are so fond of mystery that one can never quite know what they intend to do . "
149491	149495	149497	149498	Mr. Kennedy	404	" Miss Effingham , "
149500	149509	149497	149498	Mr. Kennedy	404	" never seems to know her own mind . "
149510	149526	149528	149528	Phineas	474	" I suppose she is like other beautiful girls who are petted on all sides , "
149530	149544	149546	149547	Mr. Kennedy	404	" As for her beauty , I do n't think much of it , "
149549	149597	149546	149547	Mr. Kennedy	404	" and as for petting , I do not understand it in reference to grown persons . Children may be petted , and dogs , - though that too is bad ; but what you call petting for grown persons is I think frivolous and almost indecent . "
149773	149783	149785	149786	Lady Laura	344	" I am just in time for the debate , "
149795	149810	149812	149813	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" You do n't mean to say that you intend to sit it out , "
149815	149838	149812	149813	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" Every word of it , - unless I lose my seat . What else is there to be done at present ? "
149839	149850	149852	149853	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" But the place they give us is so unpleasant , "
149855	149867	149869	149870	Lady Laura	344	" There are worse places even than the Ladies ' Gallery , "
149872	149896	149869	149870	Lady Laura	344	" And perhaps it is as well to make oneself used to inconveniences of all kinds . You will speak , Mr. Finn ? "
149897	149904	149812	149813	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" I intend to do so . "
149905	149929	149869	149870	Lady Laura	344	" Of course you will . The great speeches will be Mr. Gresham 's , Mr. Daubeny 's , and Mr. Monk 's . "
149930	149939	149941	149942	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" Mr. Palliser intends to be very strong , "
149944	149958	149960	149961	Lady Laura	344	" A man can not be strong or not as he likes it , "
149963	150002	149960	149961	Lady Laura	344	" Mr. Palliser I believe to be a most useful man , but he never can become an orator . He is of the same class as Mr. Kennedy , - only of course higher in the class . "
150003	150015	150017	150018	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" We all look for a great speech from Mr. Kennedy , "
150020	150034	150036	150037	Lady Laura	344	" I have not the slightest idea whether he will open his lips , "
150048	150056	150058	150059	Lady Laura	344	" I hate that woman like poison , "
150061	150129	150058	150059	Lady Laura	344	" She is always playing a game , and it is such a small game that she plays ! And she contributes so little to society . She is not witty nor well - informed , - not even sufficiently ignorant or ridiculous to be a laughing - stock . One gets nothing from her , and yet she has made her footing good in the world . "
150130	150140	150058	150059	Lady Laura	344	" I thought she was a friend of yours . "
150141	150185	150058	150059	Lady Laura	344	" You did not think so ! You could not have thought so ! How can you bring such an accusation against me , knowing me as you do ? But never mind Mrs. Bonteen now . On what day shall you speak ? "
150186	150193	150058	150059	Lady Laura	344	" On Tuesday if I can . "
150194	150202	150058	150059	Lady Laura	344	" I suppose you can arrange it ? "
150203	150219	150058	150059	Lady Laura	344	" I shall endeavour to do so , as far as any arrangement can go . "
150220	150228	150230	150231	Lady Laura	344	" We shall carry the second reading , "
150233	150236	150238	150238	Phineas	329	" Yes , "
150240	150287	150238	150238	Phineas	329	" I think we shall ; but by the votes of men who are determined so to pull the bill to pieces in committee , that its own parents will not know it . I doubt whether Mr. Mildmay will have the temper to stand it . "
150288	150310	150058	150059	Lady Laura	344	" They tell me that Mr. Mildmay will abandon the custody of the bill to Mr. Gresham after his first speech . "
150311	150329	150331	150331	Phineas	329	" I do n't know that Mr. Gresham 's temper is more enduring than Mr. Mildmay 's , "
150333	150371	150331	150331	Phineas	329	" Well ; - we shall see . My own impression is that nothing would save the country so effectually at the present moment as the removal of Mr. Turnbull to a higher and a better sphere . "
150372	150381	150383	150383	Phineas	329	" Let us say the House of Lords , "
150385	150389	150391	150392	Lady Laura	344	" God forbid ! "
150506	150512	150513	150513	he	329	" Where is your brother ? "
150523	150540	150513	150513	he	329	" Oswald is in London . He was here not an hour before you came in . "
150541	150547	150493	150494	Lady Laura	344	" Where is he staying ? "
150548	150573	150493	150494	Lady Laura	344	" At Moroni 's . He goes down on Tuesday , I think . He is to see his father to - morrow morning . "
150574	150578	150513	150513	he	329	" By agreement ? "
150579	150648	150493	150494	Lady Laura	344	" Yes ; - by agreement . There is a new trouble , - about money that they think to be due to me . But I can not tell you all now . There have been some words between Mr. Kennedy and papa . But I wo n't talk about it . You would find Oswald at Moroni 's at any hour before eleven to - morrow . "
150649	150657	150659	150659	Phineas	329	" Did he say anything about me ? "
150661	150668	150659	150659	Phineas	329	" We mentioned your name certainly . "
150669	150689	150493	150494	Lady Laura	344	" I do not ask from vanity , but I want to know whether he is angry with me . "
150690	150738	150493	150494	Lady Laura	344	" Angry with you ! Not in the least . I 'll tell you just what he said . He said he should not wish to live even with you , but that he would sooner try it with you than with any man he ever knew . "
150739	150748	150659	150659	Phineas	329	" He had got a letter from me ? "
150749	150766	150493	150494	Lady Laura	344	" He did not say so ; - but he did not say he had not . "
150767	150779	150493	150494	Lady Laura	344	" I will see him to - morrow if I can . "
150787	150794	150796	150797	Lady Laura	344	" One word , Mr. Finn , "
150814	150828	150796	150797	Lady Laura	344	" I wish you to forget what I said to you at Loughlinter . "
150829	150839	150841	150841	Phineas	329	" It shall be as though it were forgotten , "
150843	150926	150927	150927	Phineas	329	" Let it be absolutely forgotten . In such a case a man is bound to do all that a woman asks him , and no man has a truer spirit of chivalry than yourself . That is all . Look in when you can . I will not ask you to dine here as yet , because we are so frightfully dull . Do your best on Tuesday , and then let us see you on Wednesday . Good - bye . "
152541	152545	152546	152546	he	339	" I find , "
152549	152630	152546	152546	he	339	" that there are many members here who do not know me yet , - young members , probably , who are green from the waste lands and road - sides of private life . They will know me soon , and then , may be , there will be less of this foolish noise , less of this elongation of unnecessary necks . Our Rome must be aroused to a sense of its danger by other voices than these . "
152698	152711	152712	152712	he	339	" I quite agreed with the right honourable gentleman in the chair , "
152715	152799	152712	152712	he	339	" when he declared that the honourable member was not out of order just now . We all of us agree with him always on such points . The rules of our House have been laid down with the utmost latitude , so that the course of our debates may not be frivolously or too easily interrupted . But a member may be so in order as to incur the displeasure of the House , and to merit the reproaches of his countrymen . "
153270	153280	153281	153281	he	364	" So you have got into form at last , "
153284	153308	153281	153281	he	364	" I always thought that it would come . I never for a moment believed but that it would come sooner or later . "
153467	153474	153475	153475	he	329	" I send you a Times , "
153478	153603	153475	153475	he	329	" in order that you may see that I have had my finger in the pie . I have hitherto abstained from putting myself forward in the House , partly through a base fear for which I despise myself , and partly through a feeling of prudence that a man of my age should not be in a hurry to gather laurels . This is literally true . There has been the fear , and there has been the prudence . My wonder is , that I have not incurred more contempt from others because I have been a coward . People have been so kind to me that I must suppose them to have judged me more leniently than I have judged myself . "
154125	154128	154129	154129	he	329	" Chiltern , "
154132	154141	154129	154129	he	329	" I am very glad to see you . "
154233	154242	154243	154243	he	329	" It is my own letter to you , "
154246	154296	154243	154243	he	329	" Yes ; it is your letter to me . I received it oddly enough together with your own note at Moroni 's , - on Monday morning . It has been round the world , I suppose , and reached me only then . You must withdraw it . "
154297	154301	154186	154186	he	463	" Withdraw it ? "
154302	154370	154406	154406	he	4569	" Yes , sir , withdraw it . As far as I can learn , without asking any question which would have committed myself or the young lady , you have not acted upon it . You have not yet done what you there threaten to do . In that you have been very wise , and there can be no difficulty in your withdrawing the letter . "
154371	154382	154406	154406	he	4569	" I certainly shall not withdraw it , Lord Chiltern . "
154383	154403	154406	154406	he	4569	" Do you remember - what - I once - told you , - about myself and Miss Effingham ? "
154529	154533	154522	154522	I	0	" a row . "
154607	154616	154618	154618	Phineas	329	" I suppose I remember what you mean , "
154620	154648	154618	154618	Phineas	329	" I think you declared that you would quarrel with any man who might presume to address Miss Effingham . Is it that to which you allude ? "
154649	154654	154656	154657	Lord Chiltern	463	" It is that , "
154659	154702	154656	154657	Lord Chiltern	463	" I remember what you said very well . If nothing else was to deter me from asking Miss Effingham to be my wife , you will hardly think that that ought to have any weight . The threat had no weight . "
154703	154888	154618	154618	Phineas	329	" It was not spoken as a threat , sir , and that you know as well as I do . It was said from a friend to a friend , - as I thought then . But it is not the less true . I wonder what you can think of faith and truth and honesty of purpose when you took advantage of my absence , - you , whom I had told a thousand times that I loved her better than my own soul ! You stand before the world as a rising man , and I stand before the world as a man - damned . You have been chosen by my father to sit for our family borough , while I am an outcast from his house . You have Cabinet Ministers for your friends , while I have hardly a decent associate left to me in the world . But I can say of myself that I have never done anything unworthy of a gentleman , while this thing that you are doing is unworthy of the lowest man . "
154889	154896	154898	154898	Phineas	329	" I have done nothing unworthy , "
154900	154929	154898	154898	Phineas	329	" I wrote to you instantly when I had resolved , - though it was painful to me to have to tell such a secret to any one . "
154930	154985	154986	154987	Lord Chiltern	463	" You wrote ! Yes ; when I was miles distant ; weeks , months away . But I did not come here to bullyrag like an old woman . I got your letter only on Monday , and know nothing of what has occurred . Is Miss Effingham to be - your wife ? "
155050	155055	155057	155058	Lord Chiltern	463	" I ask you , "
155060	155082	155057	155058	Lord Chiltern	463	" in what position you now stand towards Miss Effingham . If you are not a coward you will tell me . "
155083	155100	155102	155102	Phineas	329	" Whether I tell you or not , you know that I am not a coward , "
155104	155111	155113	155114	Lord Chiltern	463	" I shall have to try , "
155116	155132	155113	155114	Lord Chiltern	463	" But if you please I will ask you for an answer to my question . "
155205	155213	155215	155215	Phineas	329	" Let me have your question again , "
155217	155238	155215	155215	Phineas	329	" and I will answer it if I find that I can do so without loss of self - respect . "
155239	155271	155179	155180	Lord Chiltern	463	" I ask you in what position you stand towards Miss Effingham . Mind , I do not doubt at all , but I choose to have a reply from yourself . "
155272	155292	155179	155180	Lord Chiltern	463	" You will remember , of course , that I can only answer to the best of my belief . "
155293	155302	155215	155215	Phineas	329	" Answer to the best of your belief . "
155303	155314	155179	155180	Lord Chiltern	463	" I think she regards me as an intimate friend . "
155315	155360	155179	155180	Lord Chiltern	463	" Had you said as an indifferent acquaintance , you would , I think , have been nearer the mark . But we will let that be . I presume I may understand that you have given up any idea of changing that position ? "
155361	155373	155215	155215	Phineas	329	" You may understand nothing of the kind , Lord Chiltern . "
155374	155383	155179	155180	Lord Chiltern	463	" Why ; - what hope have you ? "
155384	155405	155179	155180	Lord Chiltern	463	" That is another thing . I shall not speak of that ; - at any rate not to you . "
155406	155412	155215	155215	Phineas	329	" Then , sir , - "
155444	155449	155451	155451	Phineas	329	" Stop , Chiltern , "
155470	155483	155451	155451	Phineas	329	" I do not choose that there should be a riot here . "
155484	155521	155451	155451	Phineas	329	" What do you call a riot , sir ? I believe that after all you are a poltroon . What I require of you is that you shall meet me . Will you do that ? "
155522	155530	155451	155451	Phineas	329	" You mean , - to fight ? "
155531	155559	155560	155560	Phineas	329	" Yes , - to fight ; to fight ; to fight . For what other purpose do you suppose that I can wish to meet you ? "
155640	155661	155663	155667	the fiery - red lord	4586	" What have you to think of , sir , when such an offer as that is made to you ? "
155669	155687	155663	155667	the fiery - red lord	4586	" I have to think whether I have courage enough to refuse to make myself an ass . "
155688	155714	155663	155667	the fiery - red lord	4586	" You say that you do not wish to have a riot . That is your way to escape what you call - a riot . "
155715	155724	155663	155667	the fiery - red lord	4586	" You want to bully me , Chiltern . "
155725	155762	155663	155667	the fiery - red lord	4586	" No , sir ; - I simply want this , that you should leave me where you found me , and not interfere with that which you have long known I claim as my own . "
155763	155771	155663	155667	the fiery - red lord	4586	" But it is not your own . "
155772	155780	155663	155667	the fiery - red lord	4586	" Then you can only fight me . "
155781	155803	155663	155667	the fiery - red lord	4586	" You had better send some friend to me , and I will name some one , whom he shall meet . "
155804	155855	155663	155667	the fiery - red lord	4586	" Of course I will do that if I have your promise to meet me . We can be in Belgium in an hour or two , and back again in a few more hours ; - that is , any one of us who may chance to be alive . "
155877	155878	155882	155887	some old steady - going buffer	4588	" "
155894	155895	155889	155890	Mr. Kennedy	404	" "
155919	155920	155908	155909	Laurence Fitzgibbon	391	" "
155975	155991	155968	155969	Mr. Fitzgibbon	391	" Then Lord Chiltern purposed to go , but turned again as he was going . "
155996	156000	156001	156001	my	0	" he said , "
156031	156669	156670	156670	I	0	" Then the fiery - red lord opened the door for himself and took his departure . Phineas , as soon as he was alone , walked down to the House , at which there was an early sitting . As he went there was one great question which he had to settle with himself , - Was there any justice in the charge made against him that he had been false to his friend ? When he had thought over the matter at Saulsby , after rushing down there that he might throw himself at Violet 's feet , he had assured himself that such a letter as that which he resolved to write to Lord Chiltern , would be even chivalrous in its absolute honesty . He would tell his purpose to Lord Chiltern the moment that his purpose was formed ; - and would afterwards speak of Lord Chiltern behind his back as one dear friend should speak of another . Had Miss Effingham shown the slightest intention of accepting Lord Chiltern 's offer , he would have acknowledged to himself that the circumstances of his position made it impossible that he should , with honour , become his friend 's rival . But was he to be debarred for ever from getting that which he wanted because Lord Chiltern wanted it also , - knowing , as he did so well , that Lord Chiltern could not get the thing which he wanted ? All this had been quite sufficient for him at Saulsby . But now the charge against him that he had been false to his friend rang in his ears and made him unhappy . It certainly was true that Lord Chiltern had not given up his hopes , and that he had spoken probably more openly to Phineas respecting them than he had done to any other human being . If it was true that he had been false , then he must comply with any requisition which Lord Chiltern might make , - short of voluntarily giving up the lady . He must fight if he were asked to do so , even though fighting were his ruin . When again in the House yesterday 's scene came back upon him , and more than one man came to him congratulating him . Mr. Monk took his hand and spoke a word to him . The old Premier nodded to him . Mr. Gresham greeted him ; and Plantagenet Palliser openly told him that he had made a good speech . How sweet would all this have been had there not been ever at his heart the remembrance of his terrible difficulty , - the consciousness that he was about to be forced into an absurdity which would put an end to all this sweetness ! Why was the world in England so severe against duelling ? After all , as he regarded the matter now , a duel might be the best way , nay , the only way out of a difficulty . If he might only be allowed to go out with Lord Chiltern the whole thing might be arranged . If he were not shot he might carry on his suit with Miss Effingham unfettered by any impediment on that side . And if he were shot , what matter was that to any one but himself ? Why should the world be so thin - skinned , - so foolishly chary of human life ? Laurence Fitzgibbon did not come to the House , and Phineas looked for him at both the clubs which he frequented , - leaving a note at each as he did not find him . He also left a note for him at his lodgings in Duke Street . "
156690	156917	156918	156918	I	0	" After that , Phineas went up to Portman Square , in accordance with the instructions received from Lady Laura . There he saw Violet Effingham , meeting her for the first time since he had parted from her on the great steps at Saulsby . Of course he spoke to her , and of course she was gracious to him . But her graciousness was only a smile and his speech was only a word . There were many in the room , but not enough to make privacy possible , - as it becomes possible at a crowded evening meeting . Lord Brentford was there , and the Bonteens , and Barrington Erle , and Lady Glencora Palliser , and Lord Cantrip with his young wife . It was manifestly a meeting of Liberals , semi - social and semi - political ; - so arranged that ladies might feel that some interest in politics was allowed to them , and perhaps some influence also . Afterwards Mr. Palliser himself came in . Phineas , however , was most struck by finding that Laurence Fitzgibbon was there , and that Mr. Kennedy was not . In regard to Mr. Kennedy , he was quite sure that had such a meeting taken place before Lady Laura 's marriage , Mr. Kennedy would have been present . "
156928	156940	156918	156918	I	0	" said Phineas , whispering a word into Fitzgibbon 's ear . "
156953	156954	156941	156941	I	0	" "
156962	157165	156959	156959	I	0	" said Fitzgibbon . How pleasant it was , - that meeting ; or would have been had there not been that nightmare on his breast ! They all talked as though there were perfect accord between them and perfect confidence . There were there great men , - Cabinet Ministers , and beautiful women , - the wives and daughters of some of England 's highest nobles . And Phineas Finn , throwing back , now and again , a thought to Killaloe , found himself among them as one of themselves . How could any Mr. Low say that he was wrong ? On a sofa near to him , so that he could almost touch her foot with his , was sitting Violet Effingham , and as he leaned over from his chair discussing some point in Mr. Mildmay 's bill with that most inveterate politician , Lady Glencora , Violet looked into his face and smiled . Oh heavens ! If Lord Chiltern and he might only toss up as to which of them should go to Patagonia and remain there for the next ten years , and which should have Violet Effingham for a wife in London ! "
157177	157212	157169	157169	Phineas	329	" said Laurence Fitzgibbon . Phineas was of course bound to go , though Lady Glencora was still talking Radicalism , and Violet Effingham was still smiling ineffably . VOLUME II CHAPTER XXXVIII The Duel "
157225	157249	157222	157222	I	0	" said Laurence Fitzgibbon , standing at the corner of Orchard Street and Oxford Street , when Phineas had half told his story . "
157285	157297	157298	157298	I	0	" Then Phineas was allowed to proceed and finish his story . "
157314	157364	157308	157308	I	0	" said Laurence . By this time Phineas had come to think that the duel was in very truth the best way out of the difficulty . It was a bad way out , but then it was a way ; - and he could not see any other . "
157375	157379	157308	157308	I	0	" said Laurence . "
157483	158017	158018	158019	My boy	7278	" Phineas felt very certain that he would not hit Lord Chiltern in an awkward place , although he was by no means sure of his hand . Let come what might , he would not aim at his adversary . But of this he had thought it proper to say nothing to Laurence Fitzgibbon . And the duel did come off on the sly . The meeting in the drawing - room in Portman Square , of which mention was made in the last chapter , took place on a Wednesday afternoon . On the Thursday , Friday , Monday , and Tuesday following , the great debate on Mr. Mildmay 's bill was continued , and at three on the Tuesday night the House divided . There was a majority in favour of the Ministers , not large enough to permit them to claim a triumph for their party , or even an ovation for themselves ; but still sufficient to enable them to send their bill into committee . Mr. Daubeny and Mr. Turnbull had again joined their forces together in opposition to the ministerial measure . On the Thursday Phineas had shown himself in the House , but during the remainder of this interesting period he was absent from his place , nor was he seen at the clubs , nor did any man know of his whereabouts . I think that Lady Laura Kennedy was the first to miss him with any real sense of his absence . She would now go to Portman Square on the afternoon of every Sunday , - at which time her husband was attending the second service of his church , - and there she would receive those whom she called her father 's guests . But as her father was never there on the Sundays , and as these gatherings had been created by herself , the reader will probably think that she was obeying her husband 's behests in regard to the Sabbath after a very indifferent fashion . The reader may be quite sure , however , that Mr. Kennedy knew well what was being done in Portman Square . Whatever might be Lady Laura 's faults , she did not commit the fault of disobeying her husband in secret . There were , probably , a few words on the subject ; but we need not go very closely into that matter at the present moment . On the Sunday which afforded some rest in the middle of the great Reform debate Lady Laura asked for Mr. Finn , and no one could answer her question . And then it was remembered that Laurence Fitzgibbon was also absent . Barrington Erle knew nothing of Phineas , - had heard nothing ; but was able to say that Fitzgibbon had been with Mr. Ratler , the patronage secretary and liberal whip , early on Thursday , expressing his intention of absenting himself for two days . Mr. Ratler had been wroth , bidding him remain at his duty , and pointing out to him the great importance of the moment . Then Barrington Erle quoted Laurence Fitzgibbon 's reply . "
158021	158028	158018	158019	My boy	7278	" said Laurence to poor Ratler , "
158065	158095	158096	158096	Bedad	419	" Not ten minutes after the telling of this little story , Fitzgibbon entered the room in Portman Square , and Lady Laura at once asked him after Phineas . "
158117	158118	158113	158113	I	0	" "
158129	158130	158119	158120	Mr. Finn	329	" "
158185	158559	158166	158166	I	0	" Laurence Fitzgibbon certainly possessed the rare accomplishment of telling a lie with a good grace . Had any man called him a liar he would have considered himself to be not only insulted , but injured also . He believed himself to be a man of truth . There were , however , in his estimation certain subjects on which a man might depart as wide as the poles are asunder from truth without subjecting himself to any ignominy for falsehood . In dealing with a tradesman as to his debts , or with a rival as to a lady , or with any man or woman in defence of a lady 's character , or in any such matter as that of a duel , Laurence believed that a gentleman was bound to lie , and that he would be no gentleman if he hesitated to do so . Not the slightest prick of conscience disturbed him when he told Lady Laura that he had been in Paris , and that he knew nothing of Phineas Finn . But , in truth , during the last day or two he had been in Flanders , and not in Paris , and had stood as second with his friend Phineas on the sands at Blankenberg , a little fishing - town some twelve miles distant from Bruges , and had left his friend since that at an hotel at Ostend , - with a wound just under the shoulder , from which a bullet had been extracted . The manner of the meeting had been in this wise . Captain Colepepper and Laurence Fitzgibbon had held their meeting , and at this meeting Laurence had taken certain standing - ground on behalf of his friend , and in obedience to his friend 's positive instruction ; - which was this , that his friend could not abandon his right of addressing the young lady , should he hereafter ever think fit to do so . Let that be granted , and Laurence would do anything . But then that could not be granted , and Laurence could only shrug his shoulders . Nor would Laurence admit that his friend had been false . "
158567	158589	158166	158166	I	0	" said Laurence , with that sweet Connaught brogue which always came to him when he desired to be effective ; - "
158716	158727	158728	158728	I	0	" Captain Colepepper was not very good at an argument . "
158737	158747	158728	158728	I	0	" said Colepepper , pulling his thick grey moustache . "
158776	159248	158761	158761	I	0	" Then they put their heads together in the most friendly way , and declared that the affair should , if possible , be kept private . On the Thursday night Lord Chiltern and Captain Colepepper went over by Calais and Lille to Bruges . Laurence Fitzgibbon , with his friend Dr. O'Shaughnessy , crossed by the direct boat from Dover to Ostend . Phineas went to Ostend by Dover and Calais , but he took the day route on Friday . It had all been arranged among them , so that there might be no suspicion as to the job in hand . Even O'Shaughnessy and Laurence Fitzgibbon had left London by separate trains . They met on the sands at Blankenberg about nine o'clock on the Saturday morning , having reached that village in different vehicles from Ostend and Bruges , and had met quite unobserved amidst the sand - heaps . But one shot had been exchanged , and Phineas had been wounded in the right shoulder . He had proposed to exchange another shot with his left hand , declaring his capability of shooting quite as well with the left as with the right ; but to this both Colepepper and Fitzgibbon had objected . Lord Chiltern had offered to shake hands with his late friend in a true spirit of friendship , if only his late friend would say that he did not intend to prosecute his suit with the young lady . In all these disputes the young lady 's name was never mentioned . Phineas indeed had not once named Violet to Fitzgibbon , speaking of her always as the lady in question ; and though Laurence correctly surmised the identity of the young lady , he never hinted that he had even guessed her name . I doubt whether Lord Chiltern had been so wary when alone with Captain Colepepper ; but then Lord Chiltern was , when he spoke at all , a very plain - spoken man . Of course his lordship 's late friend Phineas would give no such pledge , and therefore Lord Chiltern moved off the ground and back to Blankenberg and Bruges , and into Brussels , in still living enmity with our hero . Laurence and the doctor took Phineas back to Ostend , and though the bullet was then in his shoulder , Phineas made his way through Blankenberg after such a fashion that no one there knew what had occurred . Not a living soul , except the five concerned , was at that time aware that a duel had been fought among the sand - hills . Laurence Fitzgibbon made his way to Dover by the Saturday night 's boat , and was able to show himself in Portman Square on the Sunday . "
159255	159273	159252	159253	Phinny Finn	360	" he said afterwards to Barrington Erle , in answer to an inquiry from that anxious gentleman . "
159292	159424	159280	159280	you	4621	" Barrington , however , did not feel quite so well assured of Fitzgibbon 's truth as Lady Laura had done . Dr. O'Shaughnessy remained during the Sunday and Monday at Ostend with his patient , and the people at the inn only knew that Mr. Finn had sprained his shoulder badly ; and on the Tuesday they came back to London again , via Calais and Dover . No bone had been broken , and Phineas , though his shoulder was very painful , bore the journey well . O'Shaughnessy had received a telegram on the Monday , telling him that the division would certainly take place on the Tuesday , - and on the Tuesday , at about ten in the evening , Phineas went down to the House . "
159433	159449	159429	159429	you	4623	" said Ratler , taking hold of him with an affection that was too warm . "
159456	159464	159452	159452	I	0	" said Phineas , wincing in agony ; "
159489	159490	159497	159497	you	4623	" "
159499	159511	159512	159512	I	0	" said Ratler , observing the sling for the first time . "
159525	159526	159519	159519	you	4623	" "
159554	159555	159545	159545	I	0	" "
159600	160535	159590	159590	You	4623	" In this way Phineas Finn spoke in the debate , and heard the end of it , voting for his party , and fought his duel with Lord Chiltern in the middle of it . He did go and sit on a well - cushioned bench in the smoking - room , and then was interrogated by many of his friends as to his mysterious absence . He had , he said , been down in Kent , and had had an accident with his arm , by which he had been confined . When this questioner and that perceived that there was some little mystery in the matter , the questioners did not push their questions , but simply entertained their own surmises . One indiscreet questioner , however , did trouble Phineas sorely , declaring that there must have been some affair in which a woman had had a part , and asking after the young lady of Kent . This indiscreet questioner was Laurence Fitzgibbon , who , as Phineas thought , carried his spirit of intrigue a little too far . Phineas stayed and voted , and then he went painfully home to his lodgings . How singular would it be if this affair of the duel should pass away , and no one be a bit the wiser but those four men who had been with him on the sands at Blankenberg ! Again he wondered at his own luck . He had told himself that a duel with Lord Chiltern must create a quarrel between him and Lord Chiltern 's relations , and also between him and Violet Effingham ; that it must banish him from his comfortable seat for Loughton , and ruin him in regard to his political prospects . And now he had fought his duel , and was back in town , - and the thing seemed to have been a thing of nothing . He had not as yet seen Lady Laura or Violet , but he had no doubt but they both were as much in the dark as other people . The day might arrive , he thought , on which it would be pleasant for him to tell Violet Effingham what had occurred , but that day had not come as yet . Whither Lord Chiltern had gone , or what Lord Chiltern intended to do , he had not any idea ; but he imagined that he should soon hear something of her brother from Lady Laura . That Lord Chiltern should say a word to Lady Laura of what had occurred , - or to any other person in the world , - he did not in the least suspect . There could be no man more likely to be reticent in such matters than Lord Chiltern , - or more sure to be guided by an almost exaggerated sense of what honour required of him . Nor did he doubt the discretion of his friend Fitzgibbon ; - if only his friend might not damage the secret by being too discreet . Of the silence of the doctor and the captain he was by no means equally sure ; but even though they should gossip , the gossiping would take so long a time in oozing out and becoming recognised information , as to have lost much of its power for injuring him . Were Lady Laura to hear at this moment that he had been over to Belgium , and had fought a duel with Lord Chiltern respecting Violet , she would probably feel herself obliged to quarrel with him ; but no such obligation would rest on her , if in the course of six or nine months she should gradually have become aware that such an encounter had taken place . Lord Chiltern , during their interview at the rooms in Great Marlborough Street , had said a word to him about the seat in Parliament ; - had expressed some opinion that as he , Phineas Finn , was interfering with the views of the Standish family in regard to Miss Effingham , he ought not to keep the Standish seat , which had been conferred upon him in ignorance of any such intended interference . Phineas , as he thought of this , could not remember Lord Chiltern 's words , but there was present to him an idea that such had been their purport . Was he bound , in circumstances as they now existed , to give up Loughton ? He made up his mind that he was not so bound unless Lord Chiltern should demand from him that he should do so ; but , nevertheless , he was uneasy in his position . It was quite true that the seat now was his for this session by all parliamentary law , even though the electors themselves might wish to be rid of him , and that Lord Brentford could not even open his mouth upon the matter in a tone more loud than that of a whisper . But Phineas , feeling that he had consented to accept the favour of a corrupt seat from Lord Brentford , felt also that he was bound to give up the spoil if it were demanded from him . If it were demanded from him , either by the father or the son , it should be given up at once . On the following morning he found a leading article in the People 's Banner devoted solely to himself . "
160541	160553	160554	160555	Mr. Finn	329	" - so ran a passage in the leading article , - "
160836	160837	160838	160839	Infamous scoundrel	4640	" "
160841	160852	160838	160839	Infamous scoundrel	4640	" said Phineas to himself , as he read this . "
160860	161927	160838	160839	Infamous scoundrel	4640	" It was clear enough , however , that Quintus Slide had found out something of his secret . If so , his only hope would rest on the fact that his friends were not likely to see the columns of the People 's Banner . CHAPTER XXXIX Lady Laura Is Told By the time that Mr. Mildmay 's great bill was going into committee Phineas was able to move about London in comfort , - with his arm , however , still in a sling . There had been nothing more about him and his wound in the People 's Banner , and he was beginning to hope that that nuisance would also be allowed to die away . He had seen Lady Laura , - having dined in Grosvenor Place , where he had been petted to his heart 's content . His dinner had been cut up for him , and his wound had been treated with the tenderest sympathy . And , singular to say , no questions were asked . He had been to Kent and had come by an accident . No more than that was told , and his dear sympathising friends were content to receive so much information , and to ask for no more . But he had not as yet seen Violet Effingham , and he was beginning to think that this romance about Violet might as well be brought to a close . He had not , however , as yet been able to go into crowded rooms , and unless he went out to large parties he could not be sure that he would meet Miss Effingham . At last he resolved that he would tell Lady Laura the whole truth , - not the truth about the duel , but the truth about Violet Effingham , and ask for her assistance . When making this resolution , I think that he must have forgotten much that he had learned of his friend 's character ; and by making it , I think that he showed also that he had not learned as much as his opportunities might have taught him . He knew Lady Laura 's obstinacy of purpose , he knew her devotion to her brother , and he knew also how desirous she had been that her brother should win Violet Effingham for himself . This knowledge should , I think , have sufficed to show him how improbable it was that Lady Laura should assist him in his enterprise . But beyond all this was the fact , - a fact as to the consequences of which Phineas himself was entirely blind , beautifully ignorant , - that Lady Laura had once condescended to love himself . Nay ; - she had gone farther than this , and had ventured to tell him , even after her marriage , that the remembrance of some feeling that had once dwelt in her heart in regard to him was still a danger to her . She had warned him from Loughlinter , and then had received him in London ; - and now he selected her as his confidante in this love affair ! Had he not been beautifully ignorant and most modestly blind , he would surely have placed his confidence elsewhere . It was not that Lady Laura Kennedy ever confessed to herself the existence of a vicious passion . She had , indeed , learned to tell herself that she could not love her husband ; and once , in the excitement of such silent announcements to herself , she had asked herself whether her heart was quite a blank , and had answered herself by desiring Phineas Finn to absent himself from Loughlinter . During all the subsequent winter she had scourged herself inwardly for her own imprudence , her quite unnecessary folly in so doing . What ! could not she , Laura Standish , who from her earliest years of girlish womanhood had resolved that she would use the world as men use it , and not as women do , - could not she have felt the slight shock of a passing tenderness for a handsome youth without allowing the feeling to be a rock before her big enough and sharp enough for the destruction of her entire barque ? Could not she command , if not her heart , at any rate her mind , so that she might safely assure herself that , whether this man or any man was here or there , her course would be unaltered ? What though Phineas Finn had been in the same house with her throughout all the winter , could not she have so lived with him on terms of friendship , that every deed and word and look of her friendship might have been open to her husband , - or open to all the world ? She could have done so . She told herself that that was not , - need not have been her great calamity . Whether she could endure the dull , monotonous control of her slow but imperious lord , - or whether she must not rather tell him that it was not to be endured , - that was her trouble . So she told herself , and again admitted Phineas to her intimacy in London . But , nevertheless , Phineas , had he not been beautifully ignorant and most blind to his own achievements , would not have expected from Lady Laura Kennedy assistance with Miss Violet Effingham . Phineas knew when to find Lady Laura alone , and he came upon her one day at the favourable hour . The two first clauses of the bill had been passed after twenty fights and endless divisions . Two points had been settled , as to which , however , Mr. Gresham had been driven to give way so far and to yield so much , that men declared that such a bill as the Government could consent to call its own could never be passed by that Parliament in that session . Immediately on his entrance into her room Lady Laura began about the third clause . Would the House let Mr. Gresham have his way about the - ? Phineas stopped her at once . "
161932	161936	160838	160839	Infamous scoundrel	4640	" he said , "

162145	162146	162134	162134	you	329	" "
162152	162238	162147	162147	You	329	" said Lady Laura . And as she spoke the look of her countenance towards him was so changed that he became at once aware that from her no assistance might be expected . His eyes were not opened in any degree to the second reason above given for Lady Laura 's opposition to his wishes , but he instantly perceived that she would still cling to that destination of Violet 's hand which had for years past been the favourite scheme of her life . "
162256	162304	162245	162246	Mr. Finn	329	" Phineas , though he had perceived his mistake , felt that he must go on with his cause . Lady Laura must know his wishes sooner or later , and it was as well that she should learn them in this way as in any other . "
162343	162344	162340	162341	Miss Effingham	351	" "
162359	162360	162351	162351	men	1025	" "
162375	162376	162380	162380	you	329	" "
162385	162386	162380	162380	you	329	" "
162393	162394	162390	162391	Lady Laura	344	" "
162442	162667	162668	162669	Mr. Finn	329	" These words were very bitter to Phineas , and yet when he had written his letter at Loughton , he had intended to be so perfectly honest , chivalrously honest ! Now Lady Laura spoke to him and looked at him as though he had been most basely false - most untrue to that noble friendship which had been lavished upon him by all her family . He felt that he would become the prey of her most injurious thoughts unless he could fully explain his ideas , and he felt , also , that the circumstances did not admit of his explaining them . He could not take up the argument on Violet 's side , and show how unfair it would be to her that she should be debarred from the homage due to her by any man who really loved her , because Lord Chiltern chose to think that he still had a claim , - or at any rate a chance . And Phineas knew well of himself , - or thought that he knew well , - that he would not have interfered had there been any chance for Lord Chiltern . Lord Chiltern had himself told him more than once that there was no such chance . How was he to explain all this to Lady Laura ? "
162671	162676	162668	162669	Mr. Finn	329	" said Lady Laura , "
162693	162694	162691	162691	yourself	329	" "
162706	162707	162699	162700	Lady Laura	344	" "
162737	162738	162730	162730	Men	1025	" "
162748	162802	162744	162744	I	0	" Poor blind fool ! He was still thinking only of Violet , and of the accusation made against him that he was untrue to his friendship for Lord Chiltern . Of that other accusation which could not be expressed in open words he understood nothing , - nothing at all as yet . "
162821	162822	162744	162744	I	0	" "
162849	162850	162854	162854	you	344	" "

162942	162943	162946	162946	sir	8579	" "
163026	163058	163016	163016	I	0	" Then some remembrance of what had passed between him and Lady Laura Standish near the falls of the Linter , when he first visited Scotland , came across his mind . "
163062	163069	163016	163016	I	0	" she said with a smile , "
163081	163418	163016	163016	I	0	" He stood silent before her , looking away from her , thinking over it all . He certainly had believed himself to be violently in love with Lady Laura , and yet when he had just now entered her drawing - room , he had almost forgotten that there had been such a passage in his life . And he had believed that she had forgotten it , - even though she had counselled him not to come to Loughlinter within the last nine months ! He had been a boy then , and had not known himself ; - but now he was a man , and was proud of the intensity of his love . There came upon him some passing throb of pain from his shoulder , reminding him of the duel , and he was proud also of that . He had been willing to risk everything , - life , prospects , and position , - sooner than abandon the slight hope which was his of possessing Violet Effingham . And now he was told that this wound in his heart would soon be cured , and was told so by a woman to whom he had once sung a song of another passion . It is very hard to answer a woman in such circumstances , because her womanhood gives her so strong a ground of vantage ! Lady Laura might venture to throw in his teeth the fickleness of his heart , but he could not in reply tell her that to change a love was better than to marry without love , - that to be capable of such a change showed no such inferiority of nature as did the capacity for such a marriage . She could hit him with her argument ; but he could only remember his , and think how violent might be the blow he could inflict , - if it were not that she were a woman , and therefore guarded . "
163426	163440	163442	163442	you	4660	" he said , when they had both been silent for a while . "
163450	163451	163452	163452	I	0	" "
163481	163482	163477	163477	her	351	" "
163492	163520	163477	163477	her	351	" said Lady Laura . To this Phineas made no immediate reply . There was no reason why he should show his whole hand to an adversary . "
163532	163537	163538	163538	You	0	" continued Lady Laura . "
163596	163597	163598	163598	I	0	" "
163608	163612	163598	163598	I	0	" said Phineas . "
163624	163629	163616	163616	you	0	" demanded Lady Laura . "
163642	163643	163636	163636	I	0	" "
163824	163834	163821	163821	her	341	" Phineas again paused a moment before he replied . "
163839	163843	163844	163844	He	516	" he said . "
163852	163853	163821	163821	her	341	" "
163920	164054	164055	164055	I	0	" There was something in this which made Lady Laura feel that she could not maintain her hostility against this man on behalf of her brother ; - and yet she could not force herself to be other than hostile to him . Her heart was sore , and it was he that had made it sore . She had lectured herself , schooling herself with mental sackcloth and ashes , rebuking herself with heaviest censures from day to day , because she had found herself to be in danger of regarding this man with a perilous love ; and she had been constant in this work of penance till she had been able to assure herself that the sackcloth and ashes had done their work , and that the danger was past . "
164064	164076	164055	164055	I	0	" she had said to herself with something almost of triumph , "
164094	164244	164245	164245	Your	4676	" And yet she was now sick and sore , almost beside herself with the agony of the wound , because this man whom she had been able to throw aside from her heart had also been able so to throw her aside . And she felt herself constrained to rebuke him with what bitterest words she might use . She had felt it easy to do this at first , on her brother 's score . She had accused him of treachery to his friendship , - both as to Oswald and as to herself . On that she could say cutting words without subjecting herself to suspicion even from herself . But now this power was taken away from her , and still she wished to wound him . She desired to taunt him with his old fickleness , and yet to subject herself to no imputation . "
164248	164252	164245	164245	Your	4676	" she said . "
164262	164263	164245	164245	Your	4676	" "

164417	164487	164410	164410	His	516	" He understood it all now as he listened to the tone of her voice , and looked into the lines of her face . There was written there plainly enough that spretae injuria formae of which she herself was conscious , but only conscious . Even his eyes , blind as he had been , were opened , - and he knew that he had been a fool . "
164497	164501	164492	164492	I	0	" he said . "
164515	164519	164508	164508	you	0	" she replied . "

164545	164563	164539	164539	I	0	" He paused but for a moment , and then he answered her with a sharp voice , "
164569	164570	164564	164564	He	1251	" "
164576	164577	164578	164578	I	0	" "

164664	164672	164651	164651	he	1251	" and Phineas smiled as he spoke . "

164845	164857	164858	164858	You	396	" Then he paused again , regretting what he had said . "
164896	164897	164901	164901	you	329	" "
164908	165069	164901	164901	you	329	" This she said plaintively , with a tone of voice and demeanour of body altogether different from that which she lately bore . Neither of them knew what was taking place between them ; but she was , in truth , gradually submitting herself again to this man 's influence . Though she rebuked him at every turn for what he said , for what he had done , for what he proposed to do , still she could not teach herself to despise him , or even to cease to love him for any part of it . She knew it all now , - except that word or two which had passed between Violet and Phineas in the rides of Saulsby Park . But she suspected something even of that , feeling sure that the only matter on which Phineas would say nothing would be that of his own success , - if success there had been . "
165092	165093	165088	165088	you	4683	" "

165211	165308	165199	165199	she	351	" She had nothing further to say , - no other argument to use . There was the soreness at her heart still present to her , making her wretched , instigating her to hurt him if she knew how to do so , in spite of her regard for him . But she felt that she was weak and powerless . She had shot her arrows at him , - all but one , - and if she used that , its poisoned point would wound herself far more surely than it would touch him . "
165315	165319	165199	165199	she	351	" he said . "
165327	165328	165320	165320	You	4688	" "
165334	165335	165320	165320	You	4688	" "

165460	165778	165779	165779	Ass	585	" Then she smiled and gave him her hand , and he went . She rose from her chair as he left the room , and waited till she heard the sound of the great door closing behind him before she again sat down . Then , when he was gone , - when she was sure that he was no longer there with her in the same house , - she laid her head down upon the arm of the sofa , and burst into a flood of tears . She was no longer angry with Phineas . There was no further longing in her heart for revenge . She did not now desire to injure him , though she had done so as long as he was with her . Nay , - she resolved instantly , almost instinctively , that Lord Brentford must know nothing of all this , lest the political prospects of the young member for Loughton should be injured . To have rebuked him , to rebuke him again and again , would be only fair , - would at least be womanly ; but she would protect him from all material injury as far as her power of protection might avail . And why was she weeping now so bitterly ? Of course she asked herself , as she rubbed away the tears with her hands , - Why should she weep ? She was not weak enough to tell herself that she was weeping for any injury that had been done to Oswald . She got up suddenly from the sofa , and pushed away her hair from her face , and pushed away the tears from her cheeks , and then clenched her fists as she held them out at full length from her body , and stood , looking up with her eyes fixed upon the wall . "
165781	165785	165786	165786	Fool	4689	" she exclaimed . "
165830	165851	165828	165828	you	4692	" The door of the room had been opened while she was standing thus , and her husband had entered . "

165915	165923	165924	165924	Laura	396	" she said , shaking her head . "

166181	166735	166165	166165	I	0	" Then she left him , standing in the middle of the room , depressed by what had occurred , - but not thinking of it as of a trouble which would do more than make him uncomfortable for that day . CHAPTER XL Madame Max Goesler Day after day , and clause after clause , the bill was fought in committee , and few men fought with more constancy on the side of the Ministers than did the member for Loughton . Troubled though he was by his quarrel with Lord Chiltern , by his love for Violet Effingham , by the silence of his friend Lady Laura , - for since he had told her of the duel she had become silent to him , never writing to him , and hardly speaking to him when she met him in society , - nevertheless Phineas was not so troubled but what he could work at his vocation . Now , when he would find himself upon his legs in the House , he would wonder at the hesitation which had lately troubled him so sorely . He would sit sometimes and speculate upon that dimness of eye , upon that tendency of things to go round , upon that obtrusive palpitation of heart , which had afflicted him so seriously for so long a time . The House now was no more to him than any other chamber , and the members no more than other men . He guarded himself from orations , speaking always very shortly , - because he believed that policy and good judgment required that he should be short . But words were very easy to him , and he would feel as though he could talk for ever . And there quickly came to him a reputation for practical usefulness . He was a man with strong opinions , who could yet be submissive . And no man seemed to know how his reputation had come . He had made one good speech after two or three failures . All who knew him , his whole party , had been aware of his failure ; and his one good speech had been regarded by many as no very wonderful effort . But he was a man who was pleasant to other men , - not combative , not self - asserting beyond the point at which self - assertion ceases to be a necessity of manliness . Nature had been very good to him , making him comely inside and out , - and with this comeliness he had crept into popularity . The secret of the duel was , I think , at this time , known to a great many men and women . So Phineas perceived ; but it was not , he thought , known either to Lord Brentford or to Violet Effingham . And in this he was right . No rumour of it had yet reached the ears of either of these persons ; - and rumour , though she flies so fast and so far , is often slow in reaching those ears which would be most interested in her tidings . Some dim report of the duel reached even Mr. Kennedy , and he asked his wife . "
166740	166746	166747	166747	Bonteen	407	" said she , sharply . "
166756	166757	166747	166747	Bonteen	407	" "
166773	166774	166758	166759	Mr. Bonteen	408	" "
166781	166792	166758	166759	Mr. Bonteen	408	" Lady Laura paused , - and then she lied . "
166825	168550	168551	168552	Mr. Finn	329	" Then Mr. Kennedy believed that there had been no duel . In his wife 's word he put absolute faith , and he thought that she would certainly know anything that her brother had done . As he was a man given to but little discourse , he asked no further questions about the duel either in the House or at the Clubs . At first , Phineas had been greatly dismayed when men had asked him questions tending to elicit from him some explanation of the mystery ; - but by degrees he became used to it , and as the tidings which had got abroad did not seem to injure him , and as the questionings were not pushed very closely , he became indifferent . There came out another article in the People 's Banner in which Lord C - - n and Mr. P - - s F - - n were spoken of as glaring examples of that aristocratic snobility , - that was the expressive word coined , evidently with great delight , for the occasion , - which the rotten state of London society in high quarters now produced . Here was a young lord , infamously notorious , quarrelling with one of his boon - companions , whom he had appointed to a private seat in the House of Commons , fighting duels , breaking the laws , scandalising the public , - and all this was done without punishment to the guilty ! There were old stories afloat , - so said the article - of what in a former century had been done by Lord Mohuns and Mr. Bests ; but now , in 186 - , c. c. c. And so the article went on . Any reader may fill in without difficulty the concluding indignation and virtuous appeal for reform in social morals as well as Parliament . But Phineas had so far progressed that he had almost come to like this kind of thing . Certainly I think that the duel did him no harm in society . Otherwise he would hardly have been asked to a semi - political dinner at Lady Glencora Palliser 's , even though he might have been invited to make one of the five hundred guests who were crowded into her saloons and staircases after the dinner was over . To have been one of the five hundred was nothing ; but to be one of the sixteen was a great deal , - was indeed so much that Phineas , not understanding as yet the advantage of his own comeliness , was at a loss to conceive why so pleasant an honour was conferred upon him . There was no man among the eight men at the dinner - party not in Parliament , - and the only other except Phineas not attached to the Government was Mr. Palliser 's great friend , John Grey , the member for Silverbridge . There were four Cabinet Ministers in the room , - the Duke , Lord Cantrip , Mr. Gresham , and the owner of the mansion . There was also Barrington Erle and young Lord Fawn , an Under - Secretary of State . But the wit and grace of the ladies present lent more of character to the party than even the position of the men . Lady Glencora Palliser herself was a host . There was no woman then in London better able to talk to a dozen people on a dozen subjects ; and then , moreover , she was still in the flush of her beauty and the bloom of her youth . Lady Laura was there ; - by what means divided from her husband Phineas could not imagine ; but Lady Glencora was good at such divisions . Lady Cantrip had been allowed to come with her lord ; - but , as was well understood , Lord Cantrip was not so manifestly a husband as was Mr. Kennedy . There are men who can not guard themselves from the assertion of marital rights at most inappropriate moments . Now Lord Cantrip lived with his wife most happily ; yet you should pass hours with him and her together , and hardly know that they knew each other . One of the Duke 's daughters was there , - but not the Duchess , who was known to be heavy ; - and there was the beauteous Marchioness of Hartletop . Violet Effingham was in the room also , - giving Phineas a blow at the heart as he saw her smile . Might it be that he could speak a word to her on this occasion ? Mr. Grey had also brought his wife ; - and then there was Madame Max Goesler . Phineas found that it was his fortune to take down to dinner , - not Violet Effingham , but Madame Max Goesler . And , when he was placed at dinner , on the other side of him there sat Lady Hartletop , who addressed the few words which she spoke exclusively to Mr. Palliser . There had been in former days matters difficult of arrangement between those two ; but I think that those old passages had now been forgotten by them both . Phineas was , therefore , driven to depend exclusively on Madame Max Goesler for conversation , and he found that he was not called upon to cast his seed into barren ground . Up to that moment he had never heard of Madame Max Goesler . Lady Glencora , in introducing them , had pronounced the lady 's name so clearly that he had caught it with accuracy , but he could not surmise whence she had come , or why she was there . She was a woman probably something over thirty years of age . She had thick black hair , which she wore in curls , - unlike anybody else in the world , - in curls which hung down low beneath her face , covering , and perhaps intended to cover , a certain thinness in her cheeks which would otherwise have taken something from the charm of her countenance . Her eyes were large , of a dark blue colour , and very bright , - and she used them in a manner which is as yet hardly common with Englishwomen . She seemed to intend that you should know that she employed them to conquer you , looking as a knight may have looked in olden days who entered a chamber with his sword drawn from the scabbard and in his hand . Her forehead was broad and somewhat low . Her nose was not classically beautiful , being broader at the nostrils than beauty required , and , moreover , not perfectly straight in its line . Her lips were thin . Her teeth , which she endeavoured to show as little as possible , were perfect in form and colour . They who criticised her severely said , however , that they were too large . Her chin was well formed , and divided by a dimple which gave to her face a softness of grace which would otherwise have been much missed . But perhaps her great beauty was in the brilliant clearness of her dark complexion . You might almost fancy that you could see into it so as to read the different lines beneath the skin . She was somewhat tall , though by no means tall to a fault , and was so thin as to be almost meagre in her proportions . She always wore her dress close up to her neck , and never showed the bareness of her arms . Though she was the only woman so clad now present in the room , this singularity did not specially strike one , because in other respects her apparel was so rich and quaint as to make inattention to it impossible . The observer who did not observe very closely would perceive that Madame Max Goesler 's dress was unlike the dress of other women , but seeing that it was unlike in make , unlike in colour , and unlike in material , the ordinary observer would not see also that it was unlike in form for any other purpose than that of maintaining its general peculiarity of character . In colour she was abundant , and yet the fabric of her garment was always black . My pen may not dare to describe the traceries of yellow and ruby silk which went in and out through the black lace , across her bosom , and round her neck , and over her shoulders , and along her arms , and down to the very ground at her feet , robbing the black stuff of all its sombre solemnity , and producing a brightness in which there was nothing gaudy . She wore no vestige of crinoline , and hardly anything that could be called a train . And the lace sleeves of her dress , with their bright traceries of silk , were fitted close to her arms ; and round her neck she wore the smallest possible collar of lace , above which there was a short chain of Roman gold with a ruby pendant . And she had rubies in her ears , and a ruby brooch , and rubies in the bracelets on her arms . Such , as regarded the outward woman , was Madame Max Goesler ; and Phineas , as he took his place by her side , thought that fortune for the nonce had done well with him , - only that he should have liked it so much better could he have been seated next to Violet Effingham ! I have said that in the matter of conversation his morsel of seed was not thrown into barren ground . I do not know that he can truly be said to have produced even a morsel . The subjects were all mooted by the lady , and so great was her fertility in discoursing that all conversational grasses seemed to grow with her spontaneously . "
168554	168558	168551	168552	Mr. Finn	329	" she said , "

168704	168743	168680	168680	they	7479	" said Madame Max Goesler , - from which expression , and from one or two others of a similar nature , Phineas was led into a doubt whether the lady were a countrywoman of his or not . "
168808	168809	168825	168826	Mr. Finn	329	" "
168816	168820	168825	168826	Mr. Finn	329	" said Phineas . "
168890	168891	168892	168892	You	4711	" "
168904	168905	168892	168892	You	4711	" "
169005	169006	168987	168988	Mr. Finn	329	" "
169024	169028	168987	168988	Mr. Finn	329	" said Phineas . "
169045	169082	169083	169083	Your	402	" At this moment Mr. Palliser was sitting perfectly silent between Lady Hartletop and the Duke 's daughter , and he gave a little spring in his chair as this sudden address was made to him . "
169132	169133	169095	169096	Mr. Finn	329	" "
169143	169148	169140	169140	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser . "
169160	169161	169156	169157	Mr. Finn	329	" "
169169	169182	169156	169157	Mr. Finn	329	" said Phineas , not caring to protect himself by a contradiction . "
169186	169192	169193	169193	I	0	" said Mr. Palliser gravely , "
169219	169278	169279	169279	I	0	" During this conversation Lady Hartletop sat as though no word of it reached her ears . She did not understand Madame Max Goesler , and by no means loved her . Mr. Palliser , when he had made his little speech , turned to the Duke 's daughter and asked some question about the conservatories at Longroyston . "
169288	169299	169279	169279	I	0	" said Madame Max Goesler , almost in a whisper . "
169302	169306	169279	169279	I	0	" said Phineas , "
169335	169336	169331	169333	Madame Max Goesler	348	" "

169475	169506	169463	169463	they	4734	" Phineas felt that he blushed . Could it be that people said of him behind his back that he was a man likely to rise high in political position ? "
169513	169518	169507	169508	Your informants	4736	" he replied awkwardly , "
169550	169622	169625	169625	you	0	" After that Madame Max Goesler turned round to Mr. Grey , who was sitting on the other side of her , and Phineas was left for a moment in silence . He tried to say a word to Lady Hartletop , but Lady Hartletop only bowed her head gracefully in recognition of the truth of the statement he made . So he applied himself for a while to his dinner . "
169631	169642	169625	169625	you	0	" said Madame Max Goesler , again addressing him suddenly . "

169746	169750	169743	169743	I	0	" said Phineas . "

169890	169905	169885	169885	I	0	" said Phineas . Then he paused a moment before he continued to speak . "
169941	169942	169927	169927	I	0	" "
169946	169999	169927	169927	I	0	" said Madame Max Goesler , who then again turned away to Mr. Grey . Ten minutes after this , when the moment was just at hand in which the ladies were to retreat , Madame Max Goesler again addressed Phineas , looking very full into his face as she did so . "
170028	170029	170014	170014	you	329	" "
170033	170034	170014	170014	you	329	" "
170058	170301	170050	170050	I	0	" Then Lady Glencora rose from her seat , and Madame Max Goesler went out with the others . CHAPTER XLI Lord Fawn What had Madame Max Goesler to do with his journey to Blankenberg ? thought Phineas , as he sat for a while in silence between Mr. Palliser and Mr. Grey ; and why should she , who was a perfect stranger to him , have dared to ask him such a question ? But as the conversation round the table , after the ladies had gone , soon drifted into politics and became general , Phineas , for a while , forgot Madame Max Goesler and the Blankenberg journey , and listened to the eager words of Cabinet Ministers , now and again uttering a word of his own , and showing that he , too , was as eager as others . But the session in Mr. Palliser 's dining - room was not long , and Phineas soon found himself making his way amidst a throng of coming guests into the rooms above . His object was to meet Violet Effingham , but , failing that , he would not be unwilling to say a few more words to Madame Max Goesler . He first encountered Lady Laura , to whom he had not spoken as yet , and , finding himself standing close to her for a while , he asked her after his late neighbour . "
170327	170328	170324	170324	her	348	" "
170570	170571	170572	170572	She	348	" "
170580	170581	170572	170572	She	348	" "
170613	170819	170604	170605	humdrum people	4766	" Then Phineas began to roam about the rooms , striving to find an opportunity of engrossing five minutes of Miss Effingham 's attention . During the time that Lady Laura was giving him the history of Madame Max Goesler his eyes had wandered round , and he had perceived that Violet was standing in the further corner of a large lobby on to which the stairs opened , - so situated , indeed , that she could hardly escape , because of the increasing crowd , but on that very account almost impossible to be reached . He could see , also , that she was talking to Lord Fawn , an unmarried peer of something over thirty years of age , with an unrivalled pair of whiskers , a small estate , and a rising political reputation . Lord Fawn had been talking to Violet through the whole dinner , and Phineas was beginning to think that he should like to make another journey to Blankenberg , with the object of meeting his lordship on the sands . When Lady Laura had done speaking , his eyes were turned through a large open doorway towards the spot on which his idol was standing . "
170829	170837	170604	170605	humdrum people	4766	" she said , touching his arm . "
170861	170928	170854	170854	I	0	" To this Phineas made no answer , but went and roamed about the rooms . Why should it be of no use ? Would Violet Effingham marry any man merely because he was a lord ? Some half - hour after this he had succeeded in making his way up to the place in which Violet was still standing , with Lord Fawn beside her . "
170941	170945	170929	170929	I	0	" he said . "
170966	170970	170971	170972	Lord Fawn	597	" she answered . "
170989	170990	170971	170972	Lord Fawn	597	" "
170997	171003	170991	170991	I	0	" said Lord Fawn ; - "
171008	171149	170971	170972	Lord Fawn	597	" Phineas felt that he ought to give some special reason to Miss Effingham to account for his efforts to reach her , but yet he had nothing special to say . Had Lord Fawn not been there , he would immediately have told her that he was waiting for an answer to the question he had asked her in Saulsby Park , but he could hardly do this in presence of the noble Under - Secretary of State . She received him with her pleasant genial smile , looking exactly as she had looked when he had parted from her on the morning after their ride . She did not show any sign of anger , or even of indifference at his approach . But still it was almost necessary that he should account for his search of her . "
171165	171169	171150	171150	I	0	" he said . "
171198	171199	171190	171190	you	4770	" "
171212	171213	171206	171207	Lady Baldock	341	" "
171252	171253	171235	171236	Lord Fawn	597	" "
171259	171264	171254	171255	Lady Baldock	341	" said Lord Fawn ; "
171280	171281	171282	171282	Evergreens	600	" "
171340	171341	171333	171334	Lord Fawn	597	" "
171355	171356	171333	171334	Lord Fawn	597	" "
171386	171387	171388	171388	You	597	" "
171394	171403	171388	171388	You	597	" said Lord Fawn , with much anxiety . "
171410	171414	171415	171415	I	0	" said Phineas . "
171423	171424	171421	171421	you	597	" "
171430	171434	171425	171425	I	0	" said Violet . "
171442	171446	171425	171425	I	0	" said he . "
171466	171467	171457	171457	you	597	" "
171481	171486	171478	171479	Miss Effingham	351	" said Lord Fawn , "
171492	171493	171495	171495	you	597	" "
171500	171504	171495	171495	you	597	" said Violet . "
171518	171534	171511	171512	Mr. Finn	329	" Then Phineas began to hope that he need not be afraid of Lord Fawn . "
171544	171553	171539	171539	you	597	" continued Violet , addressing herself to Phineas . "
171563	171564	171556	171557	Lord Fawn	597	" "
171626	171627	171618	171619	Lord Fawn	597	" "
171638	171639	171632	171632	I	0	" "
171715	171716	171711	171711	she	348	" "
171728	171729	171732	171732	she	348	" "
171776	171827	171766	171768	Madame Max Goesler	348	" Now Phineas had two things near his heart , - political promotion and Violet Effingham , - and Madame Max Goesler had managed to touch them both . She had asked him respecting his journey to Blankenberg , and had touched him very nearly in reference to Miss Effingham . "
171837	171844	171830	171832	Madame Max Goesler	348	" said Violet to Lord Fawn . "
171903	171904	171867	171867	I	0	" "
171919	171923	171867	171867	I	0	" said Violet . "
171936	171941	171942	171942	You	0	" said Lord Fawn . "
171950	171987	171946	171946	her	7484	" said Violet . Then Phineas , choosing to oppose Lord Fawn as well as he could on that matter , as on every other , declared that he had found Madame Max Goesler most delightful . "
171996	172000	171993	171993	she	7484	" said Violet . "
172003	172008	172011	172011	her	7484	" exclaimed Lord Fawn . "
172015	172019	172009	172009	I	0	" said Phineas . "
172024	172028	172022	172022	I	0	" said Violet . "
172062	172063	172052	172052	She	7484	" "
172074	172079	172065	172065	she	7484	" said Lord Fawn . "
172093	172236	172082	172082	you	4793	" said Violet . Half an hour after this , when Phineas was preparing to fight his way out of the house , he was again close to Madame Max Goesler . He had not found a single moment in which to ask Violet for an answer to his old question , and was retiring from the field discomfited , but not dispirited . Lord Fawn , he thought , was not a serious obstacle in his way . Lady Laura had told him that there was no hope for him ; but then Lady Laura 's mind on that subject was , he thought , prejudiced . Violet Effingham certainly knew what were his wishes , and knowing them , smiled on him and was gracious to him . Would she do so if his pretensions were thoroughly objectionable to her ? "
172246	172254	172237	172237	I	0	" said Madame Max Goesler to him . "
172263	172264	172265	172265	I	0	" "
172320	172333	172334	172334	He	4795	" Phineas , of course , declared that he would be delighted . "
172378	172379	172369	172370	An Englishman	8694	" "
172388	172389	172369	172370	An Englishman	8694	" "
172413	172441	172402	172402	he	749	" Phineas had now given the order for the carriage , and , having returned , was standing with Madame Max Goesler in the cloak - room . "
172456	172460	172461	172461	You	4794	" she said . "
172512	172540	172500	172500	they	4809	" Could it be possible that Madame Max Goesler 's ears were so sharp that she had heard the things which Lord Fawn had said of her ? "
172549	172553	172543	172547	a well - informed man	4811	" said Phineas . "
172561	172567	172543	172547	a well - informed man	4811	" said Madame Max Goesler . "
172589	172590	172580	172580	they	4809	" "
172598	172604	172591	172591	I	0	" said Phineas , stoutly . "
172665	172772	172659	172659	you	4794	" Then he put Madame Max Goesler into her carriage , and walked away to his club . CHAPTER XLII Lady Baldock Does Not Send a Card to Phineas Finn Lady Baldock 's house in Berkeley Square was very stately , - a large house with five front windows in a row , and a big door , and a huge square hall , and a fat porter in a round - topped chair ; - but it was dingy and dull , and could not have been painted for the last ten years , or furnished for the last twenty . Nevertheless , Lady Baldock had "
172775	172827	172659	172659	you	4794	" and people went to them , - though not such a crowd of people as would go to the evenings of Lady Glencora . Now Mr. Phineas Finn had not been asked to the evenings of Lady Baldock for the present season , and the reason was after this wise . "
172833	172854	172830	172831	Mr. Finn	329	" Lady Baldock had said to her daughter , who , early in the spring , was preparing the cards . "
172865	172866	172867	172867	I	0	" "
172877	172912	172872	172872	he	329	" said Augusta Boreham , whose eyes at Saulsby had been sharper perhaps than her mother 's , and who had her suspicions . But Lady Baldock did not like interference from her daughter . "
172918	172922	172913	172914	Mr. Finn	329	" she continued . "
172975	172976	172969	172969	him	329	" "
172981	172982	172979	172979	mamma	1709	" "
172985	172986	172979	172979	mamma	1709	" "
173000	173001	172992	172992	he	329	" "
173011	173012	173006	173006	you	0	" "
173025	173026	173014	173014	you	0	" "
173032	173033	173036	173036	he	329	" "
173053	173054	173045	173045	she	341	" "
173120	173258	173115	173115	I	0	" Miss Boreham quite understood her mother , though she could never master her , - and the card was prepared . Miss Boreham could never master her mother by her own efforts ; but it was , I think , by a little intrigue on her part that Lady Baldock was mastered , and , indeed , altogether cowed , in reference to our hero , and that this victory was gained on that very afternoon in time to prevent the sending of the card . When the mother and daughter were at tea , before dinner , Lord Baldock came into the room , and , after having been patted and petted and praised by his mother , he took up all the cards out of a china bowl and ran his eyes over them . "
173262	173266	173259	173260	Lord Fawn	597	" he said , "
173284	173285	173279	173279	she	595	" "
173296	173302	173291	173291	she	595	" said Lady Baldock ; - "
173310	173311	173312	173314	Julius Caesar Conway	604	" "
173348	173349	173350	173350	They	4834	" "
173397	173398	173387	173387	I	0	" "
173408	173419	173399	173399	You	0	" said Lord Baldock , continuing to read the cards ; "
173444	173445	173430	173430	I	0	" "
173457	173462	173453	173453	he	604	" pleaded Lady Baldock . "
173509	173510	173500	173507	the most old - fashioned Tory in England	4839	" "
173520	173521	173518	173518	Gustavus	519	" "
173534	173543	173525	173525	They	4841	" Mr. Finn is asked everywhere , Gustavus . "
173544	173577	173532	173532	one	1102	" I do n't doubt it . They say he is a very good sort of fellow . They say also that Violet has found that out as well as other people . "
173578	173586	173525	173525	They	4841	" What do you mean , Gustavus ? "
173587	173627	173642	173643	Lady Baldock	341	" I mean that everybody is saying that this Phineas Finn is going to set himself up in the world by marrying your niece . He is quite right to try it on , if he has a chance . "
173628	173640	173642	173643	Lady Baldock	341	" I do n't think he would be right at all , "
173649	173683	173642	173643	Lady Baldock	341	" I think he would be wrong , - shamefully wrong . They say he is the son of an Irish doctor , and that he has n't a shilling in the world . "
173684	173726	173642	173643	Lady Baldock	341	" That is just why he would be right . What is such a man to do , but to marry money ? He 's a deuced good - looking fellow , too , and will be sure to do it . "
173727	173759	173642	173643	Lady Baldock	341	" He should work for his money in the city , then , or somewhere there . But I do n't believe it , Gustavus ; I do n't , indeed . "
173760	173812	173642	173643	Lady Baldock	341	" Very well . I only tell you what I hear . The fact is that he and Chiltern have already quarrelled about her . If I were to tell you that they have been over to Holland together and fought a duel about her , you would n't believe that . "
173813	173834	173642	173643	Lady Baldock	341	" Fought a duel about Violet ! People do n't fight duels now , and I should not believe it . "
173835	173847	173642	173643	Lady Baldock	341	" Very well . Then send your card to Mr. Finn . "
173902	173917	173919	173920	Lady Baldock	341	" You had better put by that card for the present , my dear , "
173924	173978	173919	173920	Lady Baldock	341	" I will make inquiries . I do n't believe a word of what Gustavus has said . I do n't think that even Violet is such a fool as that . But if rash and ill - natured people have spoken of it , it may be as well to be careful . "
173979	173995	174086	174086	her	341	" It is always well to be careful ; - is it not , mamma ? "
173996	174054	173919	173920	Lady Baldock	341	" Not but what I think it very improper that these things should be said about a young woman ; and as for the story of the duel , I do n't believe a word of it . It is absurd . I dare say that Gustavus invented it at the moment , just to amuse himself . "
174344	174350	174351	174351	she	341	" It is my duty , "
174357	174375	174351	174351	she	341	" and though it be taken in a bad spirit , I will always perform my duty . "
174393	174397	174398	174398	she	341	" My dear , "
174401	174412	174398	174398	she	341	" do you remember meeting a Mr. Finn at Saulsby ? "
174413	174461	174379	174379	her	341	" A Mr. Finn , aunt ! Why , he is a particular friend of mine . Of course I do , and he was at Saulsby . I have met him there more than once . Do n't you remember that we were riding about together ? "
174462	174485	174534	174535	Lady Baldock	341	" I remember that he was there , certainly ; but I did not know that he was a special - friend . "
174486	174507	174398	174398	she	341	" Most especial , aunt . A 1 , I may say ; - among young men , I mean . "
174641	174644	174646	174647	Lady Baldock	341	" Violet , "
174652	174668	174646	174647	Lady Baldock	341	" I never heard such a word before from the lips of a young lady . "
174669	174683	174693	174694	Lady Baldock	341	" Not as A 1 ? I thought it simply meant very good . "
174684	174691	174693	174694	Lady Baldock	341	" A 1 is a nobleman , "
174696	174716	174718	174718	Violet	341	" No , aunt ; - A 1 is a ship , - a ship that is very good , "
174720	174742	174718	174718	Violet	341	" And do you mean to say that Mr. Finn is , - is , - is , - very good ? "
174743	174771	174693	174694	Lady Baldock	341	" Yes , indeed . You ask Lord Brentford , and Mr. Kennedy . You know he saved poor Mr. Kennedy from being throttled in the streets . "
174772	174788	174693	174694	Lady Baldock	341	" That has nothing to do with it . A policeman might have done that . "
174789	174810	174693	174694	Lady Baldock	341	" Then he would have been A 1 of policemen , - though A 1 does not mean a policeman . "
174811	174826	174693	174694	Lady Baldock	341	" He would have done his duty , and so perhaps did Mr. Finn . "
174827	174905	174693	174694	Lady Baldock	341	" Of course he did , aunt . It could n't have been his duty to stand by and see Mr. Kennedy throttled . And he nearly killed one of the men , and took the other prisoner with his own hands . And he made a beautiful speech the other day . I read every word of it . I am so glad he 's a Liberal . I do like young men to be Liberals . "
174946	174957	174937	174938	George III	610	" You have nothing to do with politics , Violet . "
174958	174972	174917	174919	the Lord Baldocks	608	" Why should n't I have something to do with politics , aunt ? "
174973	175000	174937	174938	George III	610	" And I must tell you that your name is being very unpleasantly mentioned in connection with that of this young man because of your indiscretion . "
175001	175005	175009	175009	she	341	" What indiscretion ? "
175042	175050	175038	175038	her	9022	" Calling him A 1 , Violet . "
175051	175099	174937	174938	George III	610	" People have been talking about me and Mr. Finn , because I just now , at this very moment , called him A 1 to you ! If you want to scold me about anything , aunt , do find out something less ridiculous than that . "
175100	175124	175009	175009	she	341	" It was most improper language , - and if you used it to me , I am sure you would to others . "
175125	175130	175038	175038	her	9022	" To what others ? "
175131	175143	174937	174938	George III	610	" To Mr. Finn , - and those sort of people . "
175144	175188	175009	175009	she	341	" Call Mr. Finn A 1 to his face ! Well , - upon my honour I do n't know why I should not . Lord Chiltern says he rides beautifully , and if we were talking about riding I might do so . "
175189	175205	175038	175038	her	9022	" You have no business to talk to Lord Chiltern about Mr. Finn at all . "
175206	175254	174937	174938	George III	610	" Have I not ? I thought that perhaps the one sin might palliate the other . You know , aunt , no young lady , let her be ever so ill - disposed , can marry two objectionable young men , - at the same time . "
175255	175265	175009	175009	she	341	" I said nothing about your marrying Mr. Finn . "
175266	175276	175038	175038	her	9022	" Then , aunt , what did you mean ? "
175277	175316	174937	174938	George III	610	" I meant that you should not allow yourself to be talked of with an adventurer , a young man without a shilling , a person who has come from nobody knows where in the bogs of Ireland . "
175317	175326	175009	175009	she	341	" But you used to ask him here . "
175327	175356	175038	175038	her	9022	" Yes , - as long as he knew his place . But I shall not do so again . And I must beg you to be circumspect . "
175357	175546	174937	174938	George III	610	" My dear aunt , we may as well understand each other . I will not be circumspect , as you call it . And if Mr. Finn asked me to marry him to - morrow , and if I liked him well enough , I would take him , - even though he had been dug right out of a bog . Not only because I liked him , - mind ! If I were unfortunate enough to like a man who was nothing , I would refuse him in spite of my liking , - because he was nothing . But this young man is not nothing . Mr. Finn is a fine fellow , and if there were no other reason to prevent my marrying him than his being the son of a doctor , and coming out of the bogs , that would not do so . Now I have made a clean breast to you as regards Mr. Finn ; and if you do not like what I 've said , aunt , you must acknowledge that you have brought it on yourself . "
175979	175999	176001	176002	Laurence Fitzgibbon	391	" What a pity we ca n't pass our bills at the Treasury , and have done with them ! "
176004	176009	176011	176012	Mr. Ratler	417	" Yes , indeed , "
176014	176053	176011	176012	Mr. Ratler	417	" For myself , I was never so tired of a session in my life . I would n't go through it again to be made , - no , not to be made Chancellor of the Exchequer . "
176199	176210	176238	176239	Laurence Fitzgibbon	391	" Mr. Mildmay has spoken to me on the subject , "
176215	176237	176238	176239	Laurence Fitzgibbon	391	" and informs me that he has offered the place at the colonies to his old supporter , Mr. Laurence Fitzgibbon . "
176455	176468	176469	176469	he	329	" It seems to be all a matter of favour and convenience , "
176474	176482	176469	176469	he	329	" without any reference to the service . "
176788	176793	176794	176794	he	332	" My dear Finn , "
176797	176828	176794	176794	he	332	" this gives me the most sincere pleasure , - the greatest pleasure in the world . Our connection together at Loughton of course makes it doubly agreeable to me . "
176829	176842	176767	176768	Lord Brentford	332	" I can not be too grateful to you , Lord Brentford . "
176843	177068	177069	177069	Phineas	329	" No , no ; no , no . It is all your own doing . When Mr. Mildmay asked me whether I did not think you the most promising of the young members on our side in your House , I certainly did say that I quite concurred . But I should be taking too much on myself , I should be acting dishonestly , if I were to allow you to imagine that it was my proposition . Had he asked me to recommend , I should have named you ; that I say frankly . But he did not . He did not . Mr. Mildmay named you himself . ' Do you think , ' he said , ' that your friend Finn would join us at the Treasury ? ' I told him that I did think so . ' And do you not think , ' said he , ' that it would be a useful appointment ? ' Then I ventured to say that I had no doubt whatever on that point ; - that I knew you well enough to feel confident that you would lend a strength to the Liberal Government . Then there were a few words said about your seat , and I was commissioned to write to you . That was all . "
177215	177286	177207	177207	he	329	" I have already ventured to write a letter to my agent at Loughton , telling him that you have accepted office , and that you will be shortly there again . He will see Shortribs and arrange it . But if I were you I should write to Shortribs and to Grating , - after I had seen Mr. Mildmay . Of course you will not mention my name , "
177299	177306	177308	177308	Phineas	329	" Of course I will not , "
177310	177324	177326	177327	the peer	2672	" I do not think you 'll find any difficulty about the seat , "
177329	177367	177326	177327	the peer	2672	" There never has been any difficulty at Loughton yet . I must say that for them . And if we can scrape through with Clause 72 we shall be all right ; - shall we not ? "
177823	177890	177818	177818	he	332	" I think we shall carry it ; and , you see , in getting it through committee , if we can carry it by one , that is as good as a hundred . That 's the comfort of close - fighting in committee . In the open House we are almost as much beaten by a narrow majority as by a vote against us . "
177891	177898	177900	177901	Lord Brentford	332	" Just so ; just so , "
177927	177942	177818	177818	he	332	" By - the - bye , Finn , have you seen Chiltern lately ? "
177943	177948	177950	177950	Phineas	329	" Not quite lately , "
177958	177964	177950	177950	Phineas	329	" Or heard from him ? "
177965	177985	177818	177818	he	332	" No ; - nor heard from him . When last I heard of him he was in Brussels . "
177986	178028	177818	177818	he	332	" Ah , - yes ; he is somewhere on the Rhine now . I thought that as you were so intimate , perhaps you corresponded with him . Have you heard that we have arranged about Lady Laura 's money ? "
178029	178040	177818	177818	he	332	" I have heard . Lady Laura has told me . "
178041	178048	178050	178051	Lord Brentford	332	" I wish he would return , "
178058	178105	178106	178106	Phineas	396	" As that great difficulty is over , I would receive him willingly , and make my house pleasant to him , if I can do so . I am most anxious that he should settle , and marry . Could you not write to him ? "
178316	178352	178353	178354	Mrs. Bunce	333	" The truth is , Mrs. Bunce , not that I want anything better ; but that a better position will be advantageous to me , and that I can afford to pay for it . "
178370	178390	178392	178393	Mrs. Bunce	333	" I 've got to be so fond of looking after you , Mr. Finn ! I have indeed , "
178395	178430	178392	178393	Mrs. Bunce	333	" It is not just what you pays like , because another party will pay as much . But we 've got so used to you , Mr. Finn , - have n't we ? "
178496	178505	178506	178506	he	329	" Do n't be such an old fool , "
178509	178520	178506	178506	he	329	" crying after him because he 's six foot high . "
178521	178535	178537	178539	the poor woman	4942	" I ai n't crying after him because he 's six foot high , "
178542	178563	178537	178539	the poor woman	4942	" but one does like old faces better than new , and a gentleman about one 's place is pleasant . "
178564	178572	178574	178574	Bunce	333	" Gentleman be d - - d , "
178749	178753	178755	178755	he	425	" Oh yes , "
178765	178796	178755	178755	he	425	" I suppose there must be lords , as you call 'em ; though for the matter of that I ca n't see as they is of any mortal use . "
178797	178807	178755	178755	he	425	" Would n't you have the Government carried on ? "
178808	178927	178755	178755	he	425	" Government ! Well ; I suppose there must be government . But the less of it the better . I 'm not against government ; - nor yet against laws , Mr. Finn ; though the less of them , too , the better . But what does these lords do in the Government ? Lords indeed ! I 'll tell you what they do , Mr. Finn . They wotes ; that 's what they do ! They wotes hard ; black or white , white or black . Ai n't that true ? When you 're a ' lord , ' will you be able to wote against Mr. Mildmay to save your very soul ? "
178928	178957	178755	178755	he	425	" If it comes to be a question of soul - saving , Mr. Bunce , I sha n't save my place at the expense of my conscience . "
178958	179035	178755	178755	he	425	" Not if you knows it , you mean . But the worst of it is that a man gets so thick into the mud that he do n't know whether he 's dirty or clean . You 'll have to wote as you 're told , and of course you 'll think it 's right enough . Ai n't you been among Parliament gents long enough to know that that 's the way it goes ? "
179036	179050	178755	178755	he	425	" You think no honest man can be a member of the Government ? "
179051	179124	178755	178755	he	425	" I do n't say that , but I think honesty 's a deal easier away from 'em . The fact is , Mr. Finn , it 's all wrong with us yet , and will be till we get it nigher to the great American model . If a poor man gets into Parliament , - you 'll excuse me , Mr. Finn , but I calls you a poor man . "
179125	179141	178755	178755	he	425	" Certainly , - as a member of Parliament I am a very poor man . "
179142	179203	178755	178755	he	425	" Just so , - and therefore what do you do ? You goes and lays yourself out for government ! I 'm not saying as how you 're anyways wrong . A man has to live . You has winning ways , and a good physiognomy of your own , and are as big as a life - guardsman . "
179215	179314	178755	178755	he	425	" Very well ; you makes your way with the big wigs , lords and earls and them like , and you gets returned for a rotten borough ; - you 'll excuse me , but that 's about it , ai n't it ? - and then you goes in for government ! A man may have a mission to govern , such as Washington and Cromwell and the like o ' them . But when I hears of Mr. Fitzgibbon a - governing , why then I says , - d - - n it all . "
179315	179325	178755	178755	he	425	" There must be good and bad you know . "
179326	179440	178755	178755	he	425	" We 've got to change a deal yet , Mr. Finn , and we 'll do it . When a young man as has liberal feelings gets into Parliament , he should n't be snapped up and brought into the governing business just because he 's poor and wants a salary . They do n't do it that way in the States ; and they wo n't do it that way here long . It 's the system as I hates , and not you , Mr. Finn . Well , good - bye , sir . I hope you 'll like the governing business , and find it suits your health . "
179595	179734	179737	179737	I	0	" ? On the evening of that day he went up to Mrs. Low 's , very sure that he should receive some encouragement from her and from her husband . She had been angry with him because he had put himself into a position in which money must be spent and none could be made . The Lows , especially Mrs. Low , had refused to believe that any success was within his reach . Now that he had succeeded , now that he was in receipt of a salary on which he could live and save money , he would be sure of sympathy from his old friends the Lows ! But Mrs. Low was as severe upon him as Mr. Bunce had been , and even from Mr. Low he could extract no real comfort . "
179741	179747	179737	179737	I	0	" said Mr. Low coldly . "

179955	179998	179945	179945	You	0	" said Mr. Low . He could not tell them that he had changed his mind , and that he meant to marry Violet Effingham , who would much prefer a parliamentary life for her husband to that of a working barrister . "
180008	180013	179999	179999	I	0	" continued Mr. Low . "
180019	180023	180030	180030	I	0	" said Phineas . "

180102	180139	180140	180140	You	0	" It came out in the course of the evening that Mr. Low was going to stand for the borough vacated by Mr. Mottram , at which it was considered that the Conservatives might possibly prevail . "

But on the next morning he was received in Grosvenor Place with an amount of triumph which went far to compensate him . Lady Laura had written to him to call there , and on his arrival he found both Violet Effingham and Madame Max Goesler with his friend . When Phineas entered the room his first feeling was one of intense joy at seeing that Violet Effingham was present there . Then there was one of surprise that Madame Max Goesler should make one of the little party . Lady Laura had told him at Mr. Palliser 's dinner - party that they , in Portman Square , had not as yet advanced far enough to receive Madame Max Goesler , - and yet here was the lady in Mr. Kennedy 's drawing - room . Now Phineas would have thought it more likely that he should find her in Portman Square than in Grosvenor Place . The truth was that Madame Goesler had been brought by Miss Effingham , - with the consent , indeed , of Lady Laura , but with a consent given with much of hesitation . "
180533	180538	180529	180529	you	4973	" Violet had asked . "
180545	180551	180539	180539	I	0	" Lady Laura had answered ; "
180573	180574	180575	180575	She	4976	" "
180581	180585	180577	180579	a clever woman	4977	" said Violet , "
180606	180660	180672	180672	her	351	" Then Lady Laura had consented , telling herself that it was not necessary that she should ask her husband 's approval as to every new acquaintance she might form . At the same time Violet had been told that Phineas would be there , and so the party had been made up . "
180676	180692	180694	180696	Madame Max Goesler	348	" I am so glad that Mr. Finn has been made a lord of something , "
180698	180721	180694	180696	Madame Max Goesler	348	" I had the pleasure of a long political discussion with him the other night , and I quite approve of him . "
180722	180732	180734	180735	Lady Laura	396	" We are so much gratified , Mr. Finn , "
180737	180760	180734	180735	Lady Laura	396	" Mr. Kennedy says that it is the best appointment they could have made , and papa is quite proud about it . "
180761	180773	180775	180777	Madame Max Goesler	348	" You are Lord Brentford 's member ; are you not ? "
180964	180971	180972	180972	she	348	" You are a lord now , "
180990	181021	180972	180972	she	348	" and you will be a president soon , and then perhaps a secretary . The order of promotion seems odd , but I am told it is very pleasant . "
181022	181032	181034	181034	Phineas	329	" It is pleasant to succeed , of course , "
181036	181045	181034	181034	Phineas	329	" let the success be ever so little . "
181046	181053	181055	181056	Lady Laura	396	" We knew you would succeed , "
181058	181072	181055	181056	Lady Laura	396	" We were quite sure of it . Were we not , Violet ? "
181073	181128	180972	180972	she	348	" You always said so , my dear . For myself I do not venture to have an opinion on such matters . Will you always have to go to that big building in the corner , Mr. Finn , and stay there from ten till four ? Wo n't that be a bore ? "
181129	181142	181144	181144	Phineas	329	" We have a half - holiday on Saturday , you know , "
181146	181162	181144	181144	Phineas	329	" And do the Lords of the Treasury have to take care of the money ? "
181168	181181	181183	181183	Phineas	329	" Only their own ; and they generally fail in doing that , "
181332	181355	181357	181359	Madame Max Goesler	348	" I do n't know whether I may dare to expect that a Lord of the Treasury will come and see me ? "
181393	181401	181402	181402	she	351	" Good - bye , Mr. Finn , "
181410	181463	181402	181402	she	351	" I 'm so very glad that they have chosen you ; and I do hope that , as Madame Max says , they 'll make you a secretary and a president , and everything else very quickly , - till it will come to your turn to be making other people . "
181464	181470	181472	181473	Madame Goesler	348	" He is very nice , "
181485	181499	181472	181473	Madame Goesler	348	" He bears being petted and spoilt without being either awkward or conceited . "
181500	181510	181512	181512	Violet	341	" On the whole , he is rather nice , "
181514	181537	181512	181512	Violet	341	" only he has not got a shilling in the world , and has to make himself before he will be anybody . "
181538	181547	181549	181551	Madame Max Goesler	348	" He must marry money , of course , "
181553	181560	181562	181563	Lady Laura	396	" I hope you are contented ? "
181581	181588	181562	181563	Lady Laura	396	" Of course I am contented . "
181589	181642	181643	181643	He	4988	" I was not , - when I first heard of it . Why did they promote that empty - headed countryman of yours to a place for which he was quite unfit ? I was not contented . But then I am more ambitious for you than you are for yourself . "
181659	181668	181669	181669	she	4990	" Have you nothing to say to me ? "
181672	181724	181669	181669	she	4990	" I do not know what to say . When I think of it all , I am lost in amazement . You tell me that you are not contented ; - that you are ambitious for me . Why is it that you should feel any interest in the matter ? "
181725	181739	181562	181563	Lady Laura	396	" Is it not reasonable that we should be interested for our friends ? "
181740	181758	181643	181643	He	4988	" But when you and I last parted here in this room you were hardly my friend . "
181759	181773	181669	181669	she	4990	" Was I not ? You wrong me there ; - very deeply . "
181774	181788	181790	181790	Phineas	396	" I told you what was my ambition , and you resented it , "
181792	181876	181790	181790	Phineas	396	" I think I said that I could not help you , and I think I said also that I thought you would fail . I do not know that I showed much resentment . You see , I told her that you were here , that she might come and meet you . You know that I wished my brother should succeed . I wished it before I ever knew you . You can not expect that I should change my wishes . "
181877	181885	181887	181887	Phineas	396	" But if he can not succeed , "
181889	181964	181887	181887	Phineas	396	" Who is to say that ? Has a woman never been won by devotion and perseverance ? Besides , how can I wish to see you go on with a suit which must sever you from my father , and injure your political prospects ; - perhaps fatally injure them ? It seems to me now that my father is almost the only man in London who has not heard of this duel . "
181965	181986	181790	181790	Phineas	396	" Of course he will hear of it . I have half made up my mind to tell him myself . "
181987	182041	181790	181790	Phineas	396	" Do not do that , Mr. Finn . There can be no reason for it . But I did not ask you to come here to - day to talk to you about Oswald or Violet . I have given you my advice about that , and I can do no more . "
182042	182062	181887	181887	Phineas	396	" Lady Laura , I can not take it . It is out of my power to take it . "
182063	182105	181790	181790	Phineas	396	" Very well . The matter shall be what you members of Parliament call an open question between us . When papa asked you to accept this place at the Treasury , did it ever occur to you to refuse it ? "
182106	182118	181790	181790	Phineas	396	" It did ; - for half an hour or so . "
182119	182265	181887	181887	Phineas	396	" I hoped you would , - and yet I knew that I was wrong . I thought that you should count yourself to be worth more than that , and that you should , as it were , assert yourself . But then it is so difficult to draw the line between proper self - assertion and proper self - denial ; - to know how high to go up the table , and how low to go down . I do not doubt that you have been right , - only make them understand that you are not as other junior lords ; - that you have been willing to be a junior lord , or anything else for a purpose ; but that the purpose is something higher than that of fetching and carrying in Parliament for Mr. Mildmay and Mr. Palliser . "
182266	182278	182280	182280	Phineas	329	" I hope in time to get beyond fetching and carrying , "
182282	182311	182280	182280	Phineas	329	" Of course you will ; and knowing that , I am glad that you are in office . I suppose there will be no difficulty about Loughton . "
182316	182320	182322	182322	he	329	" I hear , "
182324	182345	182322	182322	he	329	" that Mr. Quintus Slide , of the People 's Banner , has already gone down to canvass the electors . "
182346	182358	182360	182361	Lady Laura	396	" Mr. Quintus Slide ! To canvass the electors of Loughton ! "
182408	182418	182419	182419	she	396	" Do you hear what Mr. Finn tells me ? "
182422	182440	182419	182419	she	396	" He has heard that Mr. Quintus Slide has gone down to Loughton to stand against him . "
182441	182446	182448	182449	Mr. Kennedy	343	" And why not ? "
182451	182455	182448	182449	Mr. Kennedy	343	" My dear ! "
182460	182503	182505	182506	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Mr. Quintus Slide will no doubt lose his time and his money ; - but he will gain the prestige of having stood for a borough , which will be something for him on the staff of the People 's Banner , "
182508	182520	182522	182523	Lady Laura	396	" He will get that horrid man Vellum to propose him , "
182525	182529	182531	182532	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Very likely , "
182534	182596	182531	182532	Mr. Kennedy	343	" And the less any of us say about it the better . Finn , my dear fellow , I congratulate you heartily . Nothing for a long time has given me greater pleasure than hearing of your appointment . It is equally honourable to yourself and to Mr. Mildmay . It is a great step to have gained so early . "
182711	182719	182721	182722	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I think he will do well , "
182727	182736	182738	182739	Lady Laura	396	" I am sure he will do well , "
182744	182792	182738	182739	Lady Laura	396	" He is not quite such a black swan with me as he is with you ; but still I think he will succeed , if he takes care of himself . It is astonishing how that absurd story of his duel with Chiltern has got about . "
182793	182802	182804	182805	Lady Laura	396	" It is impossible to prevent people talking , "
182807	182845	182804	182805	Lady Laura	396	" I suppose there was some quarrel , though neither of them will tell you . They say it was about Miss Effingham . I should hardly think that Finn could have any hopes in that direction . "
182846	182854	182738	182739	Lady Laura	396	" Why should he not have hopes ? "
182855	182868	182870	182871	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Because he has neither position , nor money , nor birth , "
182873	182879	182881	182882	Lady Laura	396	" He is a gentleman . "
182884	182907	182881	182882	Lady Laura	396	" and I think he has position . I do not see why he should not ask any girl to marry him . "
182908	182917	182919	182920	Mr. Kennedy	343	" There is no understanding you , Laura , "
182924	182936	182919	182920	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I thought you had quite other hopes about Miss Effingham . "
182937	182987	182881	182882	Lady Laura	396	" So I have ; but that has nothing to do with it . You spoke of Mr. Finn as though he would be guilty of some crime were he to ask Violet Effingham to be his wife . In that I disagree with you . Mr. Finn is - "
182988	183001	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" You will make me sick of the name of Mr. Finn . "
183002	183021	183022	183023	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I am sorry that I offend you by my gratitude to a man who saved your life . "
183055	183067	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" Perhaps I had better not mention his name any more , "
183072	183075	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" Nonsense ! "
183076	183089	183022	183023	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I quite agree with you that it is nonsense , Robert . "
183090	183130	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" All I mean to say is , that if you go on as you do , you will turn his head and spoil him . Do you think I do not know what is going on among you ? "
183131	183146	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" And what is going on among us , - as you call it ? "
183147	183217	183022	183023	Mr. Kennedy	343	" You are taking this young man up and putting him on a pedestal and worshipping him , just because he is well - looking , and rather clever and decently behaved . It 's always the way with women who have nothing to do , and who can not be made to understand that they should have duties . They can not live without some kind of idolatry . "
183218	183229	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" Have I neglected my duty to you , Robert ? "
183230	183253	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" Yes , - you know you have ; - in going to those receptions at your father 's house on Sundays . "
183254	183264	183022	183023	Mr. Kennedy	343	" What has that to do with Mr. Finn ? "
183265	183268	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" Psha ! "
183269	183362	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" I begin to think I had better tell Mr. Finn not to come here any more , since his presence is disagreeable to you . All the world knows how great is the service he did you , and it will seem to be very ridiculous . People will say all manner of things ; but anything will be better than that you should go on as you have done , - accusing your wife of idolatry towards - a young man , because - he is - well - looking . "
183363	183372	183022	183023	Mr. Kennedy	343	" I never said anything of the kind . "
183373	183379	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" You did , Robert . "
183380	183399	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" I did not . I did not speak more of you than of a lot of others . "
183400	183449	183069	183070	Lady Laura	396	" You accused me personally , saying that because of my idolatry I had neglected my duty ; but really you made such a jumble of it all , with papa 's visitors , and Sunday afternoons , that I can not follow what was in your mind . "
184089	184095	184075	184075	she	396	" a lot of others , "
184223	184231	184233	184234	the man	7504	" I think Miss Effingham is there , "
184536	184541	184542	184542	Violet	341	" Brighton in June ! "
184546	184557	184542	184542	Violet	341	" Would not a month among the glaciers be delightful ! "
184563	184575	184576	184576	Violet	341	" Do n't let me keep you in town , aunt , "
184579	184604	184576	184576	Violet	341	" but I do not think I shall go till other people go . I can have a room at Laura Kennedy 's house . "
184884	184894	184896	184897	Lady Baldock	341	" Yes , I think she is at home , "
184909	184937	184896	184897	Lady Baldock	341	" At least , I hardly know . She seldom tells me what she means to do , - and sometimes she will walk out quite alone ! "
184989	184996	184997	184997	she	341	" However , we will see , "
185046	185056	185058	185059	Lady Baldock	341	" I almost wish she had never been born , "
185064	185074	185058	185059	Lady Baldock	341	" Oh , mamma , do n't say that . "
185075	185087	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" I certainly do wish that I had never seen her . "
185088	185101	185103	185104	Miss Boreham	570	" Indeed she has been a grievous trouble to you , mamma , "
185108	185114	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" Brighton ! What nonsense ! "
185119	185202	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" Of course it 's nonsense . Fancy going to Brighton ! And then they have proposed Switzerland . If you could only hear Augusta talking in rapture of a month among the glaciers ! And I feel so ungrateful . I believe they would spend three months with me at any horrible place that I could suggest , - at Hong Kong if I were to ask it , - so intent are they on taking me away from metropolitan danger . "
185203	185210	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" But you will not go ? "
185211	185283	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" No ! - I wo n't go . I know I am very naughty ; but I ca n't help feeling that I can not be good without being a fool at the same time . I must either fight my aunt , or give way to her . If I were to yield , what a life I should have ; - and I should despise myself after all . "
185284	185296	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" And what is the special danger to be feared now ? "
185297	185331	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" I do n't know ; - you , I fancy . I told her that if she went , I should go to you . I knew that would make her stay . "
185332	185341	185343	185344	Lady Laura	344	" I wish you would come to me , "
185346	185363	185343	185344	Lady Laura	344	" I should n't think of it really , - not for any length of time . "
185364	185368	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" Why not ? "
185369	185380	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" Because I should be in Mr. Kennedy 's way . "
185381	185422	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" You would n't be in his way in the least . If you would only be down punctually for morning prayers , and go to church with him on Sunday afternoon , he would be delighted to have you . "
185423	185433	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" What did he say about Madame Max coming ? "
185434	185464	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" Not a word . I do n't think he quite knew who she was then . I fancy he has inquired since , by something he said yesterday . "
185465	185471	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" What did he say ? "
185472	185501	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" Nothing that matters ; - only a word . I have n't come here to talk about Madame Max Goesler , - nor yet about Mr. Kennedy . "
185502	185511	185513	185513	Violet	341	" Whom have you come to talk about ? "
185537	185543	185545	185546	Lady Laura	344	" A lover of course , "
185548	185594	185545	185546	Lady Laura	344	" I wish you would leave me alone with my lovers . You are as bad or worse than my aunt . She , at any rate , varies her prescription . She has become sick of poor Lord Fawn because he 's a Whig . "
185595	185603	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" And who is her favourite now ? "
185604	185659	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" Old Mr. Appledom , - who is really a most unexceptionable old party , and whom I like of all things . I really think I could consent to be Mrs. Appledom , to get rid of my troubles , - if he did not dye his whiskers and have his coats padded . "
185660	185673	185545	185546	Lady Laura	344	" He 'd give up those little things if you asked him . "
185674	185738	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" I should n't have the heart to do it . Besides , this is n't his time of the year for making proposals . His love fever , which is of a very low kind , and intermits annually , never comes on till the autumn . It is a rural malady , against which he is proof while among his clubs ! "
185739	185751	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" Well , Violet , - I am like your aunt . "
185752	185757	185545	185546	Lady Laura	344	" Like Lady Baldock ? "
185758	185772	185545	185546	Lady Laura	344	" In one respect . I , too , will vary my prescription . "
185773	185781	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" What do you mean , Laura ? "
185782	185804	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" Just this , - that if you like to marry Phineas Finn , I will say that you are right . "
185805	185819	185545	185546	Lady Laura	344	" Heaven and earth ! And why am I to marry Phineas Finn ? "
185820	185834	185545	185546	Lady Laura	344	" Only for two reasons ; because he loves you , and because - "
185835	185847	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" No , - I deny it . I do not . "
185848	185858	185116	185117	Lady Laura	344	" I had come to fancy that you did . "
185859	185884	185545	185546	Lady Laura	344	" Keep your fancy more under control then . But upon my word I ca n't understand this . He was your great friend . "
185885	185894	185896	185897	Lady Laura	344	" What has that to do with it ? "
185899	185910	185896	185897	Lady Laura	344	" And you have thrown over your brother , Laura ? "
185911	185930	185545	185546	Lady Laura	344	" You have thrown him over . Is he to go on for ever asking and being refused ? "
185931	185941	185943	185943	Violet	341	" I do not know why he should not , "
185979	185980	185981	185981	Violet	341	" "
186007	186008	185990	185990	you	341	" "

186933	187170	186916	186916	I	0	" CHAPTER XLVI The Mousetrap Phineas had certainly no desire to make love by an ambassador , - at second - hand . He had given no commission to Lady Laura , and was , as the reader is aware , quite ignorant of what was being done and said on his behalf . He had asked no more from Lady Laura than an opportunity of speaking for himself , and that he had asked almost with a conviction that by so asking he would turn his friend into an enemy . He had read but little of the workings of Lady Laura 's heart towards himself , and had no idea of the assistance she was anxious to give him . She had never told him that she was willing to sacrifice her brother on his behalf , and , of course , had not told him that she was willing also to sacrifice herself . Nor , when she wrote to him one June morning and told him that Violet would be found in Portman Square , alone , that afternoon , - naming an hour , and explaining that Miss Effingham would be there to meet herself and her father , but that at such an hour she would be certainly alone , - did he even then know how much she was prepared to do for him . The short note was signed "
187173	187182	186916	186916	I	0	" and then there came a long postscript . "
187187	187194	186916	186916	I	0	" she said in a postscript . "
187297	187449	187293	187293	I	0	" Phineas destroyed the note , tearing it into atoms , the moment that he had read it and re - read it . Of course he would go to Portman Square at the hour named . Of course he would take his chance . He was not buoyed up by much of hope ; - but even though there were no hope , he would take his chance . When Lord Brentford had first told Phineas of his promotion , he had also asked the new Lord of the Treasury to make a certain communication on his behalf to his son . This Phineas had found himself obliged to promise to do ; - and he had done it . The letter had been difficult enough to write , - but he had written it . After having made the promise , he had found himself bound to keep it . "

187498	187513	187486	187487	your father	1238	" Then he explained at length Lord Brentford 's wishes as he understood them . "

187620	187624	187617	187617	Yours	463	" PHINEAS FINN . "

187724	187734	187721	187721	he	0	" I am so glad to find you alone . "
187735	187738	187739	187739	she	344	" Yes , "
187744	187794	187739	187739	she	344	" I am alone , - a poor unprotected female . But I fear nothing . I have strong reason for believing that Lord Brentford is somewhere about . And Pomfret the butler , who has known me since I was a baby , is a host in himself . "
187795	187806	187807	187807	he	0	" With such allies you can have nothing to fear , "
187818	187865	187807	187807	he	0	" Nor even without them , Mr. Finn . We unprotected females in these days are so self - reliant that our natural protectors fall off from us , finding themselves to be no longer wanted . Now with you , - what can I fear ? "
187866	187874	187721	187721	he	0	" Nothing , - as I hope . "
187875	187946	187739	187739	she	344	" There used to be a time , and that not so long ago either , when young gentlemen and ladies were thought to be very dangerous to each other if they were left alone . But propriety is less rampant now , and upon the whole virtue and morals , with discretion and all that kind of thing , have been the gainers . Do n't you think so ? "
187947	187954	187807	187807	he	0	" I am sure of it . "
187955	187975	187721	187721	he	0	" All the same , but I do n't like to be caught in a trap , Mr. Finn . "
187976	187981	187739	187739	she	344	" In a trap ? "
187982	188017	187807	187807	he	0	" Yes ; - in a trap . Is there no trap here ? If you will say so , I will acknowledge myself to be a dolt , and will beg your pardon . "
188018	188028	187807	187807	he	0	" I hardly know what you call a trap . "
188029	188038	188039	188039	He	5115	" You were told that I was here ? "
188047	188054	188039	188039	He	5115	" Yes , I was told . "
188055	188062	187807	187807	he	0	" I call that a trap . "
188063	188069	187807	187807	he	0	" Am I to blame ? "
188070	188086	187807	187807	he	0	" I do n't say that you set it , - but you use it . "
188087	188128	187807	187807	he	0	" Miss Effingham , of course I have used it . You must know , - I think you must know that I have that to say to you which has made me long for such an opportunity as this . "
188129	188142	187807	187807	he	0	" And therefore you have called in the assistance of your friend . "
188143	188148	187807	187807	he	0	" It is true . "
188149	188181	187807	187807	he	0	" In such matters you should never talk to any one , Mr. Finn . If you can not fight your own battle , no one can fight it for you . "
188182	188194	187807	187807	he	0	" Miss Effingham , do you remember our ride at Saulsby ? "
188195	188206	187807	187807	he	0	" Very well ; - as if it were yesterday . "
188207	188224	187807	187807	he	0	" And do you remember that I asked you a question which you have never answered ? "
188225	188251	187807	187807	he	0	" I did answer it , - as well as I knew how , so that I might tell you a truth without hurting you . "
188252	188339	187807	187807	he	0	" It was necessary , - is necessary that I should be hurt sorely , or made perfectly happy . Violet Effingham , I have come to you to ask you to be my wife ; - to tell you that I love you , and to ask for your love in return . Whatever may be my fate , the question must be asked , and an answer must be given . I have not hoped that you should tell me that you loved me - "
188340	188348	187807	187807	he	0	" For what then have you hoped ? "
188349	188374	187807	187807	he	0	" For not much , indeed ; - but if for anything , then for some chance that you might tell me so hereafter . "
188375	188399	187807	187807	he	0	" If I loved you , I would tell you so now , - instantly . I give you my word of that . "
188400	188407	187807	187807	he	0	" Can you never love me ? "
188408	188454	187807	187807	he	0	" What is a woman to answer to such a question ? No ; - I believe never . I do not think I shall ever wish you to be my husband . You ask me to be plain , and I must be plain . "
188455	188461	188462	188462	He	5116	" Is it because - ? "
188479	188531	188472	188472	he	5116	" It is for no because , - for no cause except that simple one which should make any girl refuse any man whom she did not love . Mr. Finn , I could say pleasant things to you on any other subject than this , - because I like you . "
188532	188544	187807	187807	he	0	" I know that I have nothing to justify my suit . "
188545	188575	187807	187807	he	0	" You have everything to justify it ; - at least I am bound to presume that you have . If you love me , - you are justified . "
188576	188584	187807	187807	he	0	" You know that I love you . "
188585	188613	187807	187807	he	0	" I am sorry that it should ever have been so , - very sorry . I can only hope that I have not been in fault . "
188614	188622	187807	187807	he	0	" Will you try to love me ? "
188623	188714	188715	188715	He	5117	" No ; - why should I try ? If any trying were necessary , I would try rather not to love you . Why should I try to do that which would displease everybody belonging to me ? For yourself , I admit your right to address me , - and tell you frankly that it would not be in vain , if I loved you . But I tell you as frankly that such a marriage would not please those whom I am bound to try to please . "
188724	188729	188730	188730	he	5117	" I shall wait , "
188733	188738	188730	188730	he	5117	" and come again . "
188739	188829	188837	188837	he	5117	" What am I to say to that ? Do not tease me , so that I be driven to treat you with lack of courtesy . Lady Laura is so much attached to you , and Mr. Kennedy , and Lord Brentford , - and indeed I may say , I myself also , that I trust there may be nothing to mar our good fellowship . Come , Mr. Finn , - say that you will take an answer , and I will give you my hand . "
188830	188835	188837	188837	he	5117	" Give it me , "
188857	188865	188866	188866	he	5117	" I will wait and come again , "
188869	188876	188866	188866	he	5117	" I will assuredly come again . "
188917	188926	188928	188929	Lady Laura	344	" So you have had a visitor here , "
188933	188945	188928	188929	Lady Laura	344	" Yes ; - I have been caught in the trap . "
188946	188960	188912	188912	she	5118	" Poor mouse ! And has the cat made a meal of you ? "
188961	189031	188928	188929	Lady Laura	344	" I fancy he has , after his fashion . There be cats that eat their mice without playing , - and cats that play with their mice , and then eat them ; and cats again which only play with their mice , and do n't care to eat them . Mr. Finn is a cat of the latter kind , and has had his afternoon 's diversion . "
189032	189038	188928	188929	Lady Laura	344	" You wrong him there . "
189039	189104	188928	188929	Lady Laura	344	" I think not , Laura . I do not mean to say that he would not have liked me to accept him . But , if I can see inside his bosom , such a little job as that he has now done will be looked back upon as one of the past pleasures of his life ; - not as a pain . "
189829	189832	189834	189834	he	345	" nowhere , "
190057	190068	190031	190031	Phineas	329	" by aristocratic influence not confined to the male sex , "
190255	190276	190277	190278	Lady Laura	344	" What business has such a man as that down there ? Is there a single creature who wants him ? "
190282	190294	190277	190278	Lady Laura	344	" I do n't suppose anybody does want Mr. Quintus Slide , "
190299	190328	190295	190295	Phineas	329	" but I am disposed to think the electors should choose the man they do want , and that at present they have no choice left to them . "
190329	190335	190337	190338	Lady Laura	344	" They are quite satisfied , "
190342	190348	190350	190350	Phineas	329	" Then , Lady Laura , "
190352	190381	190350	190350	Phineas	329	" that alone should be sufficient to prove that their privilege of returning a member to Parliament is too much for them . We ca n't defend it . "
190382	190389	190391	190392	Mr. Kennedy	343	" It is defended by tradition , "
190394	190401	190403	190404	Lady Laura	344	" And by its great utility , "
190436	190449	190451	190452	Mr. Kennedy	343	" In this country it does n't do to go too fast , "
190454	190467	190469	190470	Lady Laura	344	" And then the mixture of vulgarity , falsehood , and pretence ! "
190491	190505	190481	190483	Mr. Quintus Slide	345	" I am told that they hardly let him leave the place alive . "
191037	191153	191154	191154	Phineas	329	" Would the honourable gentleman who sat lowest on the Treasury bench , - who at this moment was in sweet confidential intercourse with the right honourable gentleman now President of the Board of Trade , who had once been a friend of the people , - would the young Lord of the Treasury get up in his place and tell them that no peer of Parliament had at present a voice in sending a member to their House of Commons , - that no peer would have a voice if this bill , as proposed by the Government , were passed in its present useless , ineffectual , conservative , and most dishonest form ? "
191728	191733	191735	191736	Mr. Monk	346	" We all know , "
191738	191819	191735	191736	Mr. Monk	346	" and none better than Mr. Mildmay , that we can not justify such a borough as Loughton by the theory of our parliamentary representation , - any more than we can justify the fact that Huntingdonshire should return as many members as the East Riding . There must be compromises , and you should trust to others who have studied the matter more thoroughly than you , to say how far the compromise should go at the present moment . "
191820	191836	191838	191838	Phineas	329	" It is the influence of the peer , not the paucity of the electors , "
191840	191882	191838	191838	Phineas	329	" And has no peer any influence in a county ? Would you disfranchise Westmoreland ? Believe me , Finn , if you want to be useful , you must submit yourself in such matters to those with whom you act . "
192010	192042	191997	191997	Bunce	425	" Slide was a little ' eavy on you in the Banner the other day , - eh , Mr. Finn ? - too ' eavy , as I told him . "
192043	192057	191981	191983	an acknowledged abuse	5233	" Mr. Slide can be just as heavy as he pleases , Bunce . "
192058	192106	191997	191997	Bunce	425	" That 's in course . The press is free , thank God , - as yet . But it was n't any good rattling away at the Earl 's little borough when it 's sure to go . Of course it 'll go , Mr. Finn . "
192107	192113	191997	191997	Bunce	425	" I think it will . "
192114	192169	191981	191983	an acknowledged abuse	5233	" The whole seven on 'em . The ' ouse could n't but do it . They tell me it 's all Mr. Mildmay 's own work , sticking out for keeping on 'em . He 's very old , and so we 'll forgive him . But he must go , Mr. Finn . "
192170	192181	191997	191997	Bunce	425	" We shall know all about that soon , Bunce . "
192182	192230	191981	191983	an acknowledged abuse	5233	" If you do n't get another seat , Mr. Finn , I suppose we shall see you back at the Inn . I hope we may . It 's better than being member for Loughton , Mr. Finn ; - you may be sure of that . "
192641	192658	192659	192660	Lord Brentford	332	" If I had been Mr. Mildmay , I would have thrown the bill up altogether , "
192664	192676	192659	192660	Lord Brentford	332	" but of course it was not for me to interfere . "
192713	192721	192723	192724	Mr. Ratler	417	" I shall never get over it , "
192743	192792	192726	192727	Mr. Finn	329	" never . I do n't suppose such a session for work was ever known before . Think what it is to have to keep men together in August , with the thermometer at 81 degress , and the river stinking like , - like the very mischief . "
192896	192904	192906	192906	Phineas	329	" But I shall have no seat , "
192908	192920	192922	192923	Mr. Gresham	431	" We shall none of us have seats to - morrow , "
192925	192941	192922	192923	Mr. Gresham	431	" But I shall be at a loss to find a place to stand for . "
192942	192975	192922	192923	Mr. Gresham	431	" The election will not come on till November , and you must look about you . Both Mr. Monk and Lord Brentford seem to think you will be in the House . "
192991	192994	192922	192923	Mr. Gresham	431	" The Duke "
193235	193245	193247	193247	Phineas	329	" I shall be delighted to see him again , "
193249	193255	193257	193258	Lady Glencora	477	" That is all right , "
193626	193637	193610	193611	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" He has come . He arrived exactly at seven ! "
193638	193643	193644	193644	Phineas	329	" Who has come ? "
193647	193653	193654	193654	she	407	" The Duke of Omnium ! "
193669	193705	193654	193654	she	407	" There has been a great doubt whether or no he would show himself at last . Lady Glencora told me that he never will pledge himself . I am so glad he has come . "
193706	193716	193718	193718	Phineas	329	" I do n't think I ever saw him , "
193720	193789	193718	193718	Phineas	329	" Oh , I have seen him , - a magnificent - looking man ! I think it is so very nice of Lady Glencora getting him to meet us . It is very rarely that he will join in a great party , but they say Lady Glencora can do anything with him since the heir was born . I suppose you have heard all about that . "
193790	193793	193795	193795	Phineas	329	" No , "
193797	193817	193795	193795	Phineas	329	" I have heard nothing of the heir , but I know that there are three or four babies . "
193818	193868	193718	193718	Phineas	329	" There was no heir , you know , for a year and a half , and they were all au desespoir ; and the Duke was very nearly quarrelling with his nephew ; and Mr. Palliser - ; you know it had very nearly come to a separation . "
193869	193880	193882	193882	Phineas	329	" I do n't know anything at all about it , "
193899	193963	193882	193882	Phineas	329	" It is so , I can assure you ; but since the boy was born Lady Glencora can do anything with the Duke . She made him go to Ascot last spring , and he presented her with the favourite for one of the races on the very morning the horse ran . They say he gave three thousand pounds for him . "
193964	193971	194017	194018	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" And did Lady Glencora win ? "
193972	194007	193882	193882	Phineas	329	" No ; - the horse lost ; and Mr. Palliser has never known what to do with him since . But it was very pretty of the Duke ; - was it not ? "
194325	194334	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" I called twice on you in London , "
194344	194354	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" but was not fortunate enough to find you ! "
194355	194396	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" Yes ; - but you came so late in the season as to make it impossible that there should be any arrangements for our meeting . What can any woman do when a gentleman calls on her in August ? "
194397	194403	194718	194719	Lady Glencora	477	" I came in July . "
194404	194456	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" Yes , you did ; on the 31st . I keep the most accurate record of all such things , Mr. Finn . But let us hope that we may have better luck next year . In the meantime , we can only enjoy the good things that are going . "
194457	194466	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" Socially , or politically , Madame Goesler ? "
194467	194521	194718	194719	Lady Glencora	477	" Oh , socially . How can I mean anything else when the Duke of Omnium is here ? I feel so much taller at being in the same house with him . Do not you ? But you are a spoilt child of fortune , and perhaps you have met him before . "
194522	194550	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" I think I once saw the back of a hat in the park , and somebody told me that the Duke 's head was inside it . "
194551	194562	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" And you have never seen him but that once ? "
194563	194573	194718	194719	Lady Glencora	477	" Never but that once , - till now . "
194574	194582	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" And do not you feel elated ? "
194583	194599	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" Of course I do . For what do you take me , Madame Goesler ? "
194600	194631	194718	194719	Lady Glencora	477	" I do , - immensely . I believe him to be a fool , and I never heard of his doing a kind act to anybody in my life . "
194632	194643	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" Not when he gave the racehorse to Lady Glencora ? "
194644	194714	194336	194336	Phineas	329	" I wonder whether that was true . Did you ever hear of such an absurdity ? As I was saying , I do n't think he ever did anything for anybody ; - but then , you know , to be Duke of Omnium ! It is n't necessary , - is it , - that a Duke of Omnium should do anything except be Duke of Omnium ? "
195175	195189	195191	195192	the Duchess	5270	" Did n't you think the session was very long , Mr. Finn ? "
195196	195203	195205	195205	Phineas	329	" Very long indeed , Duchess , "
195217	195225	195213	195215	Madame Max Goesler	348	" The Duke found it very troublesome . "
195226	195232	195234	195234	Phineas	329	" I daresay he did , "
195306	195318	195320	195321	the Duchess	5270	" And things do seem to be so very uncomfortable now , "
195358	195369	195371	195371	Phineas	329	" Not so very bad , Duchess , I hope , "
195403	195406	195422	195424	Madame Max Goesler	348	" cut out "
195513	195526	195527	195527	she	351	" I have almost been on my knees to him to stay , "
195530	195546	195527	195527	she	351	" Indeed , I did go on my knees , - actually on my knees . "
195547	195554	195488	195489	Lord Brentford	332	" And what did he say ? "
195555	195645	195646	195646	Phineas	329	" He put his arm round me and kissed me , and , - and , - I can not tell you all that he said . But it ended in this , - that if Chiltern can be made to go to Saulsby , fatted calves without stint will be killed . I shall do all I can to make him go ; and so must you , Mr. Finn . Of course that silly affair in foreign parts is not to make any difference between you two . "
195771	195785	195787	195787	Violet	351	" I am so glad to hear you say so , Mr. Finn , "
195789	195846	195787	195787	Violet	351	" I really do believe that you can do more towards it than any one else . Lord Chiltern would think nothing of my advice , - would hardly speak to me on such a subject . But he respects you as well as likes you , and not the less because of what has occurred . "
196290	196296	196298	196299	the Duke	1449	" Do you never play ? "
196301	196312	196298	196299	the Duke	1449	" Oh yes ; - one does everything a little . "
196313	196329	196493	196495	Madame Max Goesler	348	" I am sure you would play well . Why do you not play now ? "
196330	196340	196493	196495	Madame Max Goesler	348	" No ; - I shall not play now . "
196341	196352	196298	196299	the Duke	1449	" I should like to see you with your mallet . "
196353	196405	196493	196495	Madame Max Goesler	348	" I am sorry your Grace can not be gratified . I have played croquet till I am tired of it , and have come to think it is only fit for boys and girls . The great thing is to give them opportunities for flirting , and it does that . "
196406	196416	196493	196495	Madame Max Goesler	348	" And do you never flirt , Madame Goesler ? "
196417	196424	196298	196299	the Duke	1449	" Never at croquet , Duke . "
196425	196435	196493	196495	Madame Max Goesler	348	" And what with you is the choicest time ? "
196436	196458	196493	196495	Madame Max Goesler	348	" That depends on so many things , - and so much on the chosen person . What do you recommend ? "
196459	196473	196298	196299	the Duke	1449	" Ah , - I am so ignorant . I can recommend nothing . "
196474	196491	196493	196495	Madame Max Goesler	348	" What do you say to a mountain - top at dawn on a summer day ? "
196497	196503	196505	196506	the Duke	1449	" You make me shiver , "
196508	196568	196505	196506	the Duke	1449	" Or a boat on a lake on a summer evening , or a good lead after hounds with nobody else within three fields , or the bottom of a salt - mine , or the deck of an ocean steamer , or a military hospital in time of war , or a railway journey from Paris to Marseilles ? "
196569	196581	196493	196495	Madame Max Goesler	348	" Madame Max Goesler , you have the most uncomfortable ideas . "
196582	196620	196505	196506	the Duke	1449	" I have no doubt your Grace has tried each of them , - successfully . But perhaps , after all , a comfortable chair over a good fire , in a pretty room , beats everything . "
196621	196630	196632	196633	the Duke	1449	" I think it does , - certainly , "
196743	196748	196749	196749	she	348	" Dear Mrs. Bonteen , "
196753	196769	196749	196749	she	348	" why did you not come and join us ? The Duke was so pleasant . "
196770	196780	196782	196783	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" Two is company , and three is none , "
196810	196822	196824	196825	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" Our friend Madame Max has made quite a new conquest , "
196830	196836	196838	196839	Lady Glencora	477	" I am so pleased , "
196846	196878	196838	196839	Lady Glencora	477	" It is such a great thing to get anybody to amuse my uncle . You see everybody can not talk to him , and he will not talk to everybody . "
196879	196889	196891	196892	Mrs. Bonteen	407	" He talked enough to her in all conscience , "
196998	197004	197005	197005	he	329	" Have you seen him ? "
197008	197026	197005	197005	he	329	" Yes ; - he was with me half an hour since , walking round the gardens . "
197027	197042	197153	197153	Phineas	476	" And how is he ? Come ; - tell me something about him . "
197043	197072	197153	197153	Phineas	476	" I never knew him to be more pleasant . He would give no promise about Saulsby , but he did not say that he would not go . "
197073	197082	197005	197005	he	329	" Does he know that I am here ? "
197083	197111	197153	197153	Phineas	476	" Yes ; - I told him so . I told him how much pleasure I should have in seeing you two together , - as friends . "
197112	197119	197153	197153	Phineas	476	" And what did he say ? "
197120	197144	197005	197005	he	329	" He laughed , and said you were the best fellow in the world . You see I am obliged to be explicit . "
197145	197152	197153	197153	Phineas	476	" But why did he laugh ? "
197156	197192	197153	197153	Phineas	476	" He did not tell me , but I suppose it was because he was thinking of a little trip he once took to Belgium , and he perceived that I knew all about it . "
197193	197244	197005	197005	he	329	" I wonder who told you . But never mind . I do not mean to ask any questions . As I do not like that our first meeting should be before all the people in the drawing - room , I will go to him in his own room . "
197245	197259	197260	197260	Phineas	476	" Do , do ; - that will be so nice of you . "
197475	197481	197483	197484	Lord Chiltern	463	" Well , old fellow , "
197514	197536	197498	197498	Phineas	476	" So we 've come to be an Under - Secretary have we ? - and all that kind of thing . "
197537	197552	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" I had to get into harness , - when the harness offered itself , "
197556	197573	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" I suppose so . It 's a deuce of a bore , is n't it ? "
197574	197583	197498	197498	Phineas	476	" I always liked work , you know . "
197584	197633	197498	197498	Phineas	476	" I thought you liked hunting better . You used to ride as if you did . There 's Bonebreaker back again in the stable for you . That poor fool who bought him could do nothing with him , and I let him have his money back . "
197634	197646	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" I do n't see why you should have done that . "
197647	197729	197498	197498	Phineas	476	" Because I was the biggest fool of the two . Do you remember when that brute got me down under the bank in the river ? That was about the nearest touch I ever had . Lord bless me ; - how he did squeeze me ! So here you are ; - staying with the Pallisers , - one of a Government party I suppose . But what are you going to do for a seat , my friend ? "
197730	197740	197498	197498	Phineas	476	" Do n't talk about that yet , Chiltern . "
197741	197781	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" A sore subject , - is n't it ? I think they have been quite right , you know , to put Loughton into the melting - pot , - though I 'm sorry enough for your sake . "
197782	197786	197788	197788	Phineas	476	" Quite right , "
197790	197822	197788	197788	Phineas	476	" And yet you voted against it , old chap ? But , come ; I 'm not going to be down upon you . So my father has been here ? "
197823	197836	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" Yes ; - he was here for a day or two . "
197837	197855	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" Violet has just been telling me . You and he are as good friends as ever ? "
197856	197862	197788	197788	Phineas	476	" I trust we are . "
197863	197872	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" He never heard of that little affair ? "
197888	197897	197877	197877	his	463	" I do not think he has yet . "
197898	197916	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" So Violet tells me . Of course you know that she has heard all about it . "
197917	197926	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" I have reason to suppose as much . "
197927	197933	197877	197877	his	463	" And so does Laura . "
197934	197940	197942	197942	Phineas	476	" I told her myself , "
197944	197993	197942	197942	Phineas	476	" The deuce you did ! But I daresay it was for the best . It 's a pity you had not proclaimed it at Charing Cross , and then nobody would have believed a word about it . Of course my father will hear it some day . "
197994	198006	197877	197877	his	463	" You are going to Saulsby , I hope , Chiltern ? "
198007	198084	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" That question is easier asked than answered . It is quite true that the great difficulty has been got over . Laura has had her money . And if my father will only acknowledge that he has wronged me throughout , from beginning to end , I will go to Saulsby to - morrow ; - and would cut you out at Loughton the next day , only that Loughton is not Loughton any longer . "
198085	198096	197942	197942	Phineas	476	" You can not expect your father to do that . "
198097	198126	197877	197877	his	463	" No ; - and therefore there is a difficulty . So you 've had that awfully ponderous Duke here . How did you get on with him ? "
198127	198143	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" Admirably . He condescended to do something which he called shaking hands with me . "
198144	198153	198155	198156	Lord Chiltern	463	" He is the greatest old dust out , "
198160	198169	198155	198156	Lord Chiltern	463	" Did he take any notice of Violet ? "
198170	198176	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" Not that I observed . "
198177	198191	197554	197554	Phineas	476	" He ought not to be allowed into the same room with her . "
198214	198224	198226	198227	Lord Chiltern	463	" And how do you get on with her ? "
198261	198272	198274	198275	Lord Chiltern	463	" You know exactly the ground that I stand on , "
198277	198291	198274	198275	Lord Chiltern	463	" She has refused me three times . Have you been more fortunate ? "
198356	198359	198361	198361	he	463	" No , "
198365	198373	198361	198361	he	463	" I have not been more fortunate . "
198374	198382	198384	198385	his host	8446	" Perhaps you have changed your mind , "
198387	198398	198400	198400	Phineas	329	" No ; - I have not changed my mind , "
198404	198471	198400	198400	Phineas	329	" How stands it then ? Come ; - let us be honest to each other . I told you down at Willingford that I would quarrel with any man who attempted to cut me out with Violet Effingham . You made up your mind that you would do so , and therefore I quarrelled with you . But we ca n't always be fighting duels . "
198472	198483	198361	198361	he	463	" I hope we may not have to fight another . "
198484	198493	198495	198496	Lord Chiltern	463	" No ; - it would be absurd , "
198498	198537	198495	198496	Lord Chiltern	463	" I rather think that what we did was absurd . But upon my life I did not see any other way out of it . However , that is over . How is it to be now ? "
198538	198549	198551	198551	Phineas	329	" What am I to say in answer to that ? "
198553	198566	198551	198551	Phineas	329	" Just the truth . You have asked her , I suppose ? "
198567	198576	198361	198361	he	463	" Yes ; - I have asked her . "
198577	198584	198361	198361	he	463	" And she has refused you ? "
198585	198594	198551	198551	Phineas	329	" Yes ; - she has refused me . "
198595	198604	198361	198361	he	463	" And you mean to ask her again ? "
198605	198639	198361	198361	he	463	" I shall ; - if I ever think that there is a chance . Indeed , Chiltern , I believe I shall whether I think that I have any chance or not . "
198640	198734	198551	198551	Phineas	329	" Then we start fairly , Finn . I certainly shall do so . I believe I once told you that I never would ; - but that was long before I suspected that you would enter for the same plate . What a man says on such a matter when he is down in the mouth goes for nothing . Now we understand each other , and you had better go and dress . The bell rang nearly half an hour ago , and my fellow is hanging about outside the door . "
199126	199130	199132	199134	Madame Max Goesler	348	" Mr. Finn , "
199136	199149	199132	199134	Madame Max Goesler	348	" your eyes and ears are tell - tales of your passion . "
199150	199155	199157	199157	Phineas	329	" I hope not , "
199159	199179	199157	199157	Phineas	329	" as I certainly do not wish that any one should guess how strong is my regard for you . "
199180	199230	199132	199134	Madame Max Goesler	348	" That is prettily turned , - very prettily turned ; and shows more readiness of wit than I gave you credit for under your present suffering . But of course we all know where your heart is . Men do not undertake perilous journeys to Belgium for nothing . "
199231	199251	199132	199134	Madame Max Goesler	348	" That unfortunate journey to Belgium ! But , dear Madame Max , really nobody knows why I went . "
199252	199259	199157	199157	Phineas	329	" You met Lord Chiltern there ? "
199260	199271	199132	199134	Madame Max Goesler	348	" Oh yes ; - I met Lord Chiltern there . "
199272	199279	199132	199134	Madame Max Goesler	348	" And there was a duel ? "
199280	199294	199157	199157	Phineas	329	" Madame Max , - you must not ask me to criminate myself ! "
199295	199333	199132	199134	Madame Max Goesler	348	" Of course there was , and of course it was about Miss Effingham , and of course the lady thinks herself bound to refuse both the gentlemen who were so very wicked , and of course - "
199334	199341	199132	199134	Madame Max Goesler	348	" Well , - what follows ? "
199342	199388	199157	199157	Phineas	329	" Ah ! if you have not wit enough to see , I do not think it can be my duty to tell you . But I wished to caution you as a friend that your eyes and ears should be more under your command . "
199389	199396	199397	199397	Violet	351	" You will go to Saulsby ? "
199403	199412	199414	199414	he	463	" I can not possibly tell as yet , "
199418	199447	199414	199414	he	463	" Then I can tell you that you ought to go . I do not care a bit for your frowns . What does the fifth commandment say ? "
199448	199461	199157	199157	Phineas	329	" If you have no better arguments than the commandments , Violet - "
199462	199482	199157	199157	Phineas	329	" There can be none better . Do you mean to say that the commandments are nothing to you ? "
199483	199532	199414	199414	he	463	" I mean to say that I sha n't go to Saulsby because I am told in the twentieth chapter of Exodus to honour my father and mother , - and that I should n't believe anybody who told me that he did anything because of the commandments . "
199533	199539	199157	199157	Phineas	329	" Oh , Lord Chiltern ! "
199540	199584	199157	199157	Phineas	329	" People are so prejudiced and so used to humbug that for the most part they do not in the least know their own motives for what they do . I will go to Saulsby to - morrow , - for a reward . "
199585	199590	199592	199592	Violet	351	" For what reward ? "
199596	199612	199592	199592	Violet	351	" For the only one in the world that could tempt me to do anything . "
199613	199649	199157	199157	Phineas	329	" You should go for the sake of duty . I should not even care to see you go , much as I long for it , if that feeling did not take you there . "
200030	200039	200040	200040	he	329	" At any rate I am not false , "
200046	200054	200040	200040	he	329	" What I say is the truth . "
200103	200112	200113	200113	she	348	" Of course you 'll get a seat , "
200123	200143	200113	200113	she	348	" If I understand it at all , they never throw over an ally so useful as you are . "
200144	200172	200113	200113	she	348	" But the intention is that in this matter nobody shall any longer have the power of throwing over , or of not throwing over , anybody . "
200173	200230	200113	200113	she	348	" That is all very well , my friend ; but cakes will still be hot in the mouth , even though Mr. Daubeny turn purist , with Mr. Turnbull to help him . If you want any assistance in finding a seat you will not go to the People 's Banner , - even yet . "
200231	200240	200113	200113	she	348	" Certainly not to the People 's Banner . "
200241	200252	200254	200256	Madame Max Goesler	348	" I do n't quite understand what the franchise is , "
200258	200263	200265	200265	Phineas	329	" Household in boroughs , "
200270	200331	200265	200265	Phineas	329	" Very well ; - household in boroughs . I daresay that is very fine and very liberal , though I do n't comprehend it in the least . And you want a borough . Very well . You wo n't go to the households . I do n't think you will ; - not at first , that is . "
200332	200339	200113	200113	she	348	" Where shall I go then ? "
200340	200383	200113	200113	she	348	" Oh , - to some great patron of a borough ; - or to a club ; - or perhaps to some great firm . The households will know nothing about it till they are told . Is not that it ? "
200384	200441	200265	200265	Phineas	329	" The truth is , Madame Max , I do not know where I shall go . I am like a child lost in a wood . And you may understand this ; - if you do not see me in Park Lane before the end of January , I shall have perished in the wood . "
200442	200483	200113	200113	she	348	" Then I will come and find you , - with a troop of householders . You will come . You will be there . I do not believe in death coming without signs . You are full of life . "
200549	200565	200566	200566	she	5431	" And , Mr. Finn ; - I wonder whether I may say one thing , "
200569	200577	200578	200578	he	5432	" You may say anything to me , "
200581	200620	200566	200566	she	5431	" No , - not in this country , in this England . There are things one may not say here , - that are tabooed by a sort of consent , - and that without any reason . "
200715	200726	200727	200727	he	329	" To me you may say anything , Madame Goesler , "
200731	200745	200727	200727	he	329	" here in England , as plainly as though we were in Vienna . "
200746	200756	200757	200757	she	5431	" But I can not say it in English , "
200858	200864	200865	200865	he	329	" The offer from you , "
200868	200916	200865	200865	he	329	" is as high - minded , as generous , and as honourable as its acceptance by me would be mean - spirited , vile , and ignoble . But whether I fail or whether I succeed , you shall see me before the winter is over . "
200953	200983	200941	200941	her	351	" Of course we shall see each other in London . Do n't talk of not being in the House . Of course you will be in the House . "
201361	201382	201344	201345	Barrington Erle	364	" Ah ; - that is so hard to say . Ratler told me that he would be looking about . "
201383	201392	201394	201394	Barrington	364	" Ratler is very well in the House , "
201396	201420	201394	201394	Barrington	364	" but he is of no use for anything beyond it . I suppose you were not brought up at the London University ? "
201421	201425	201427	201427	Phineas	329	" Oh no , "
201435	201457	201427	201427	Phineas	329	" Because there would have been an opening . What do you say to Stratford , - the new Essex borough ? "
201458	201466	201344	201345	Barrington Erle	364	" Broadbury the brewer is there already ! "
201467	201534	201344	201345	Barrington Erle	364	" Yes ; - and ready to spend any money you like to name . Let me see . Loughton is grouped with Smotherem , and Walker is a deal too strong at Smotherem to hear of any other claim . I do n't think we could dare to propose it . There are the Chelsea hamlets , but it will take a wack of money . "
201535	201545	201547	201547	Phineas	329	" I have not got a wack of money , "
201551	201589	201547	201547	Phineas	329	" That 's the devil of it . I think , if I were you , I should hark back upon some place in Ireland . Could n't you get Laurence to give you up his seat ? "
201590	201595	201344	201345	Barrington Erle	364	" What ! Fitzgibbon ? "
201596	201664	201547	201547	Phineas	329	" Yes . He has not a ghost of a chance of getting into office again . Nothing on earth would induce him to look at a paper during all those weeks he was at the Colonial Office ; and when Cantrip spoke to him , all he said was , ' Ah , bother ! ' Cantrip did not like it , I can tell you . "
201665	201677	201344	201345	Barrington Erle	364	" But that would n't make him give up his seat . "
201678	201688	201547	201547	Phineas	329	" Of course you 'd have to arrange it . "
201725	201736	201738	201738	Phineas	329	" I 'm afraid that 's out of the question , "
201740	201753	201738	201738	Phineas	329	" If he were to go , I should not get it . "
201754	201763	201800	201804	the sitting member of Loughshane	5463	" Would you have a chance at Loughshane ? "
201764	201772	201774	201774	Phineas	329	" I was thinking of trying it , "
201776	201787	201774	201774	Phineas	329	" Of course you know that Morris is very ill . "
201806	201839	201840	201840	Phineas	329	" Upon my word I think I should try that . I do n't see where we 're to put our hands on a seat in England . I do n't indeed . "
202534	202538	202540	202541	Lord Tulla	373	" Poor Jack ! "
202545	202572	202540	202541	Lord Tulla	373	" If I 'd known it , I need n't have paid over two thousand pounds for him last year ; - need I , doctor ? "
202573	202578	202580	202581	Dr. Finn	354	" No , indeed , "
202597	202609	202611	202613	the desolate brother	5497	" He never would live by any rule , you know , "
202615	202629	202611	202613	the desolate brother	5497	" Very hard to guide ; - was he not , my lord ? "
202630	202657	202540	202541	Lord Tulla	373	" The very devil . Now , you see , I do do what I 'm told pretty well , - do n't I , doctor ? "
202658	202661	202540	202541	Lord Tulla	373	" Sometimes . "
202662	202729	202611	202613	the desolate brother	5497	" By George , I do nearly always . I do n't know what you mean by sometimes . I 've been drinking brandy - and - water till I 'm sick of it , to oblige you , and you tell me about - sometimes . You doctors expect a man to be a slave . Have n't I kept it out of my stomach ? "
202730	202736	202540	202541	Lord Tulla	373	" Thank God , yes . "
202737	202786	202540	202541	Lord Tulla	373	" It 's all very well thanking God , but I should have gone as poor Jack has gone , if I had n't been the most careful man in the world . He was drinking champagne ten days ago ; - would do it , you know . "
202863	202884	202850	202850	He	354	" Mr. Morris , you see , lived more in London than you do , and was subject to temptation . "
202885	202914	203146	203146	he	373	" I do n't know what you call temptation . Have n't I the temptation of a bottle of wine under my nose every day of my life ? "
202915	202921	203146	203146	he	373	" No doubt you have . "
202922	202964	202850	202850	He	354	" And I do n't drink it . I hardly ever take above a glass or two of brown sherry . By George ! when I think of it , I wonder at my own courage . I do , indeed . "
202965	202975	203146	203146	he	373	" But a man in London , my lord - "
202976	203002	203146	203146	he	373	" Why the deuce would he go to London ? By - the - bye , what am I to do about the borough now ? "
203003	203018	202850	202850	He	354	" Let my son stand for it , if you will , my lord . "
203019	203138	203146	203146	he	373	" They 've clean swept away Brentford 's seat at Loughton , have n't they ? Ha , ha , ha ! What a nice game for him , - to have been forced to help to do it himself ! There 's nobody on earth I pity so much as a radical peer who is obliged to work like a nigger with a spade to shovel away the ground from under his own feet . As for me , I do n't care who sits for Loughshane . I did care for poor Jack while he was alive . I do n't think I shall interfere any longer . I am glad it lasted Jack 's time . "
203159	203165	203167	203168	the father	8247	" Phineas , my lord , "
203170	203179	203167	203168	the father	8247	" is now Under - Secretary of State . "
203180	203209	202850	202850	He	354	" Oh , I 've no doubt he 's a very fine fellow ; - but you see , he 's an out - and - out Radical . "
203210	203216	203167	203168	the father	8247	" No , my lord . "
203217	203257	203167	203168	the father	8247	" Then how can he serve with such men as Mr. Gresham and Mr. Monk ? They 've turned out poor old Mildmay among them , because he 's not fast enough for them . Do n't tell me . "
203258	203282	202850	202850	He	354	" My anxiety , of course , is for my boy 's prospects . He seems to have done so well in Parliament . "
203283	203294	203167	203168	the father	8247	" Why do n't he stand for Marylebone or Finsbury ? "
203295	203305	203167	203168	the father	8247	" The money , you know , my lord ! "
203306	203407	202850	202850	He	354	" I sha n't interfere here , doctor . If he comes , and the people then choose to return him , I shall say nothing . They may do just as they please . They tell me Lambert St. George , of Mockrath , is going to stand . If he does , it 's the d - - piece of impudence I ever heard of . He 's a tenant of my own , though he has a lease for ever ; and his father never owned an acre of land in the county till his uncle died . "
203849	203859	203830	203830	Barbara	361	" I shall be so glad to see her , "
203864	203878	203880	203881	Barbara Finn	361	" If there ever was an angel on earth , it is Mary , "
203883	203894	203896	203896	Phineas	329	" I know that she is as good as gold , "
203898	203901	203903	203903	Barbara	361	" Gold ! "
203906	203944	203903	203903	Barbara	361	" gold indeed ! She is more precious than refined gold . But , Phineas , perhaps you had better not single her out for any special attention . She has thought it wisest to meet you . "
203945	203949	203951	203951	Phineas	329	" Of course , "
203953	203957	203951	203951	Phineas	329	" Why not ? "
203958	203980	203903	203903	Barbara	361	" That is all , Phineas . I have nothing more to say . Men of course are different from girls . "
203981	203992	203903	203903	Barbara	361	" That 's true , Barbara , at any rate . "
203993	204042	203951	203951	Phineas	329	" Do n't laugh at me , Phineas , when I am thinking of nothing but of you and your interests , and when I am making all manner of excuses for you because I know what must be the distractions of the world in which you live . "
204101	204112	204113	204113	he	329	" I am so glad to see you , Mary , "
204159	204179	204113	204113	he	329	" Thank you . We did not happen to meet last year , did we , - Mr. Finn ? "
204180	204190	204113	204113	he	329	" Do not call me Mr. Finn , Mary . "
204191	204200	204113	204113	he	329	" You are such a great man now ! "
204201	204228	204113	204113	he	329	" Not at all a great man . If you only knew what little men we understrappers are in London you would hardly speak to me . "
204229	204244	204113	204113	he	329	" But you are something - of State now ; - are you not ? "
204245	204307	204113	204113	he	329	" Well ; - yes . That 's the name they give me . It simply means that if any member wants to badger some one in the House about the Colonies , I am the man to be badgered . But if there is any credit to be had , I am not the man who is to have it . "
204308	204325	204113	204113	he	329	" But it is a great thing to be in Parliament and in the Government too . "
204326	204368	204113	204113	he	329	" It is a great thing for me , Mary , to have a salary , though it may only be for a year or two . However , I will not deny that it is pleasant to have been successful . "
204369	204387	204113	204113	he	329	" It has been very pleasant to us , Phineas . Mamma has been so much rejoiced . "
204388	204406	204113	204113	he	329	" I am so sorry not to see her . She is at Floodborough , I suppose . "
204407	204448	204113	204113	he	329	" Oh , yes ; - she is at home . She does not like coming out at night in winter . I have been staying here you know for two days , but I go home to - morrow . "
204449	204460	204113	204113	he	329	" I will ride over and call on your mother . "
204473	204492	204113	204113	he	329	" Does it not seem odd , Mary , that we should see so little of each other ? "
204493	204503	204113	204113	he	329	" You are so much away , of course . "
204504	204590	204113	204113	he	329	" Yes ; - that is the reason . But still it seems almost unnatural . I often wonder when the time will come that I shall be quietly at home again . I have to be back in my office in London this day week , and yet I have not had a single hour to myself since I have been at Killaloe . But I will certainly ride over and see your mother . You will be at home on Wednesday I suppose . "
204591	204601	204113	204113	he	329	" Yes , - I shall be at home . "
204777	204781	204782	204782	he	329	" Dear Mary , "
204792	204804	204782	204782	he	329	" things will get themselves settled at last , I suppose . "
204865	204923	204851	204851	Mary	382	" The fact is , mamma , I love him . I can not help it . If he ever chooses to come for me , here I am . If he does not , I will bear it as well as I can . It may be very mean of me , but it 's true . "
205067	205075	205076	205077	his wife	947	" Does that mean Darby and Joan ? "
205090	205098	205103	205103	his	343	" It means mutual regard and esteem , "
205108	205125	205103	205103	his	343	" and I trust that such mutual regard and esteem between us may yet be possible . "
205202	205209	205210	205210	she	947	" It is not my doing , "
205222	205231	205232	205232	he	343	" I said nothing about anybody 's doing , "
205235	205262	205210	205210	she	947	" I will write to Oswald and bid him not come , if you wish it . Of course you can understand why he is coming . "
205263	205273	205275	205276	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Not to see me , I am sure , "
205278	205282	205284	205285	Lady Laura	344	" Nor me , "
205287	205300	205284	205285	Lady Laura	344	" He is coming because my friend Violet Effingham will be here . "
205301	205322	205210	205210	she	947	" Miss Effingham ! Why was I not told of this ? I knew nothing of Miss Effingham 's coming . "
205323	205336	205344	205345	Lady Laura	344	" Robert , it was settled in your own presence last July . "
205337	205342	205284	205285	Lady Laura	344	" I deny it . "
205471	205559	205560	205560	Laura	344	" in his presence ; - but yet he felt that he had been wrong in contradicting his wife so peremptorily . He was a just man , and he would apologise for his fault ; but he was an austere man , and would take back the value of his apology in additional austerity . He did not see his wife for some hours after the conversation which has been narrated , but when he did meet her his mind was still full of the subject . "
205561	205566	205567	205567	I	0	" , he said , "
205575	205576	205577	205577	I	0	" "

205598	205606	205607	205607	You	343	" She smiled and bowed her head . "
205619	205642	205607	205607	You	343	" Then he paused a moment , but she said not a word , - only smiled and bowed her head again . "
205646	205650	205643	205643	I	0	" he continued , "
205694	205695	205689	205689	I	0	" "

205928	206171	206172	206172	He	5566	" Mr. Kennedy said nothing further at the time , and it became an understanding that Violet Effingham was to be a month at Loughlinter , staying from the 20th of December to the 20th of January , and that Lord Chiltern was to come there for Christmas , - which with him would probably mean three days . Before Christmas came , however , there were various other sources of uneasiness at Loughlinter . There had been , as a matter of course , great anxiety as to the elections . With Lady Laura this anxiety had been very strong , and even Mr. Kennedy had been warmed with some amount of fire as the announcements reached him of the successes and of the failures . The English returns came first , - and then the Scotch , which were quite as interesting to Mr. Kennedy as the English . His own seat was quite safe , - was not contested ; but some neighbouring seats were sources of great solicitude . Then , when this was over , there were the tidings from Ireland to be received ; and respecting one special borough in Ireland , Lady Laura evinced more solicitude than her husband approved . There was much danger for the domestic bliss of the house of Loughlinter , when things came to such a pass , and such words were spoken , as the election at Loughshane produced . "
206176	206185	206172	206172	He	5566	" said Lady Laura , opening a telegram . "
206190	206230	206231	206232	Our friend	8691	" said Mr. Kennedy , with that frown on his brow to which his wife was now well accustomed . Though he asked the question , he knew very well who was the hero to whom the telegram referred . "
206236	206417	206231	206232	Our friend	8691	" said Lady Laura , speaking still with an excited voice , - with a voice that was intended to display excitement . If there was to be a battle on this matter , there should be a battle . She would display all her anxiety for her young friend , and fling it in her husband 's face if he chose to take it as an injury . What , - should she endure reproach from her husband because she regarded the interests of the man who had saved his life , of the man respecting whom she had suffered so many heart - struggles , and as to whom she had at last come to the conclusion that he should ever be regarded as a second brother , loved equally with the elder brother ? She had done her duty by her husband , - so at least she had assured herself ; - and should he dare to reproach her on this subject , she would be ready for the battle . And now the battle came . "
206424	206439	206418	206418	I	0	" she said , with all the eagerness she could throw into her voice . "
206453	206508	206449	206449	you	5569	" The husband 's brow grew blacker and blacker , but still he said nothing . He had long been too proud to be jealous , and was now too proud to express his jealousy , - if only he could keep the expression back . But his wife would not leave the subject . "
206516	206527	206509	206509	I	0	" she said , pressing the telegram between her hands . "
206536	206537	206538	206538	You	0	" "
206549	206559	206538	206538	You	0	" at last he said , speaking very slowly . "
206621	206652	206653	206653	Laura	344	" And as she spoke she held up the clenched fist of her left hand , and shook it , while she still held the telegram in her right hand . "
206686	206687	206688	206692	A stranger to my blood	5575	" "
206749	206750	206744	206744	you	344	" "
206764	206765	206766	206766	Robert	343	" "
206768	206769	206770	206770	I	0	" "
206795	206796	206783	206783	They	5582	" "

206923	207016	206915	206915	I	0	" said Lady Laura , advancing a step towards him . But Mr. Kennedy simply pointed to the telegram in her hand , and left the room . Now in respect to this telegram there had been an unfortunate mistake . I am not prepared to say that there was any reason why Phineas himself should not have sent the news of his success to Lady Laura ; but he had not done so . The piece of paper which she still held crushed in her hand was in itself very innocent . "
207028	207166	207022	207022	Finny	643	" Such were the words written on the slip , and they had been sent to Lady Laura by her young cousin , the clerk in the office who acted as private secretary to the Under - Secretary of State . Lady Laura resolved that her husband should never see those innocent but rather undignified words . The occasion had become one of importance , and such words were unworthy of it . Besides , she would not condescend to defend herself by bringing forward a telegram as evidence in her favour . So she burned the morsel of paper . Lady Laura and Mr. Kennedy did not meet again till late that evening . She was ill , she said , and would not come down to dinner . After dinner she wrote him a note . "
207200	207403	207404	207404	My	0	" When the servant handed it to him , and he had read it , he smiled and thanked the girl who had brought it , and said he would see her mistress just now . Anything would be better than that the servants should know that there was a quarrel . But every servant in the house had known all about it for the last three hours . When the door was closed and he was alone , he sat fingering the note , thinking deeply how he should answer it , or whether he would answer it at all . No ; he would not answer it ; - not in writing . He would give his wife no written record of his humiliation . He had not acted wrongly . He had said nothing more than now , upon mature consideration , he thought that the circumstances demanded . But yet he felt that he must in some sort withdraw the accusation which he had made . If he did not withdraw it , there was no knowing what his wife might do . About ten in the evening he went up to her and made his little speech . "

207465	207494	207461	207461	I	0	" said Lady Laura , knowing very well that her husband 's moment would be rather tedious , and resolving that she also would have her moment afterwards . "
207533	207534	207535	207535	You	344	" "

207863	208185	207857	207857	you	344	" As she was making this speech , her temper seemed to rise , and to become hot , and then hotter , till it glowed with a red heat . She had been cool till the word insult , used by herself , had conveyed back to her a strong impression of her own wrong , - or perhaps I should rather say a strong feeling of the necessity of becoming indignant . She was standing as she spoke , and the fire flashed from her eyes , and he quailed before her . The threat which she had held out to him was very dreadful to him . He was a man terribly in fear of the world 's good opinion , who lacked the courage to go through a great and harassing trial in order that something better might come afterwards . His married life had been unhappy . His wife had not submitted either to his will or to his ways . He had that great desire to enjoy his full rights , so strong in the minds of weak , ambitious men , and he had told himself that a wife 's obedience was one of those rights which he could not abandon without injury to his self - esteem . He had thought about the matter , slowly , as was his wo nt , and had resolved that he would assert himself . He had asserted himself , and his wife told him to his face that she would go away and leave him . He could detain her legally , but he could not do even that without the fact of such forcible detention being known to all the world . How was he to answer her now at this moment , so that she might not write to her father , and so that his self - assertion might still be maintained ? "

208257	208274	208275	208275	Laura	344	" He came up and took her hand , but she snatched it away from him . "

She positively refused to see Dr. Macnuthrie , and at last succeeded in inducing him to quit the room . This had occurred about the end of November , and on the 20th of December Violet Effingham reached Loughlinter . Life in Mr. Kennedy 's house had gone quietly during the intervening three weeks , but not very pleasantly . The name of Phineas Finn had not been mentioned . Lady Laura had triumphed ; but she had no desire to acerbate her husband by any unpalatable allusion to her victory . And he was quite willing to let the subject die away , if only it would die . On some other matters he continued to assert himself , taking his wife to church twice every Sunday , using longer family prayers than she approved , reading an additional sermon himself every Sunday evening , calling upon her for weekly attention to elaborate household accounts , asking for her personal assistance in much local visiting , initiating her into his favourite methods of family life in the country , till sometimes she almost longed to talk again about Phineas Finn , so that there might be a rupture , and she might escape . But her husband asserted himself within bounds , and she submitted , longing for the coming of Violet Effingham . She could not write to her father and beg to be taken away , because her husband would read a sermon to her on Sunday evening . To Violet , very shortly after her arrival , she told her whole story .

Lady Laura had in fact told almost everything that there was to tell , - had spoken either plainly with true words , or equally plainly with words that were not true . Violet Effingham had almost come to love Phineas Finn ; - but she never told her friend that it was so . At one time she had almost made up her mind to give herself and all her wealth to this adventurer . He was a better man , she thought , than Lord Chiltern ; and she had come to persuade herself that it was almost imperative on her to take the one or the other . Though she could talk about remaining unmarried , she knew that that was practically impossible . All those around her , - those of the Baldock as well as those of the Brentford faction , - would make such a life impossible to her . Besides , in such a case what could she do ? It was all very well to talk of disregarding the world and of setting up a house for herself ; - but she was quite aware that that project could not be used further than for the purpose of scaring her amiable aunt . And if not that , - then could she content herself to look forward to a joint life with Lady Baldock and Augusta Boreham ? She might , of course , oblige her aunt by taking Lord Fawn , or oblige her aunt equally by taking Mr. Appledom ; but she was strongly of opinion that either Lord Chiltern or Phineas would be preferable to these . Thinking over it always she had come to feel that it must be either Lord Chiltern or Phineas ; but she had never whispered her thought to man or woman . On her journey to Loughlinter , where she then knew that she was to meet Lord Chiltern , she endeavoured to persuade herself that it should be Phineas . But Lady Laura had marred it all by that ill - told fib . There had been a moment before in which Violet had felt that Phineas had sacrificed something of that truth of love for which she gave him credit to the glances of Madame Goesler 's eyes ; but she had rebuked herself for the idea , accusing herself not only of a little jealousy , but of foolish vanity . Was he , whom she had rejected , not to speak to another woman ? Then came the blow from Lady Laura , and Violet knew that it was a blow . This gallant lover , this young Crichton , this unassuming but ardent lover , had simply taken up with her as soon as he had failed with her friend . Lady Laura had been most enthusiastic in her expressions of friendship . Such platonic regards might be all very well . It was for Mr. Kennedy to look to that . But , for herself , she felt that such expressions were hardly compatible with her ideas of having her lover all to herself . And then she again remembered Madame Goesler 's bright blue eyes . Lord Chiltern came on Christmas eve , and was received with open arms by his sister , and with that painful , irritating affection which such a girl as Violet can show to such a man as Lord Chiltern , when she will not give him that other affection for which his heart is panting . The two men were civil to each other , - but very cold . They called each other Kennedy and Chiltern , but even that was not done without an effort . On the Christmas morning Mr. Kennedy asked his brother - in - law to go to church . "
210023	210073	210019	210019	I	0	" said Lord Chiltern . Mr. Kennedy gave a little start , and looked a look of horror . Lady Laura showed that she was unhappy . Violet Effingham turned away her face , and smiled . As they walked across the park Violet took Lord Chiltern 's part . "

210137	210281	210126	210126	I	0	" said Violet , perhaps not reflecting that the practices of early years had little to do with the young man 's life at present . Christmas day and the next day passed without any sign from Lord Chiltern , and on the day after that he was to go away . But he was not to leave till one or two in the afternoon . Not a word had been said between the two women , since he had been in the house , on the subject of which both of them were thinking . Very much had been said of the expediency of his going to Saulsby , but on this matter he had declined to make any promise . Sitting in Lady Laura 's room , in the presence of both of them , he had refused to do so . "
210288	210296	210298	210298	you	5618	" he said , turning to Violet , "
210307	210308	210298	210298	you	5618	" "
210320	210401	210402	210402	Laura	344	" she answered , laughing . CHAPTER LII The First Blow Lord Chiltern , though he had passed two entire days in the house with Violet without renewing his suit , had come to Loughlinter for the express purpose of doing so , and had his plans perfectly fixed in his own mind . After breakfast on that last morning he was up - stairs with his sister in her own room , and immediately made his request to her . "
210404	210408	210402	210402	Laura	344	" he said , "
210423	210434	210418	210418	Violet	351	" She stood a moment looking at him and smiled . "

210544	210725	210726	210726	Violet	351	" Whatever may have been the arguments used by her friend , Violet did come . She reached the door all alone , and opened it bravely . She had promised herself , as she came along the passages , that she would not pause with her hand on the lock for a moment . She had first gone to her own room , and as she left it she had looked into the glass with a hurried glance , and had then rested for a moment , - thinking that something should be done , that her hair might be smoothed , or a ribbon set straight , or the chain arranged under her brooch . A girl would wish to look well before her lover , even when she means to refuse him . But her pause was but for an instant , and then she went on , having touched nothing . She shook her head and pressed her hands together , and went on quick and opened the door , - almost with a little start . "
210735	210755	210726	210726	Violet	351	" said Lord Chiltern , standing with his back to the fire , and not moving from the spot . "

211543	211798	211799	211799	Oswald	516	" he said . Then he went back to the rug before the fire , and stood there with his back turned to her . Violet , when she found herself thus deserted , retreated to a sofa , and sat herself down . She had no negative to produce now in answer to the violent assertion which he had pronounced as to his own success . It was true . She had doubted , and doubted , - and still doubted . But now she must doubt no longer . Of one thing she was quite sure . She could love him . As things had now gone , she would make him quite happy with assurances on that subject . As to that other question , - that fearful question , whether or not she could trust him , - on that matter she had better at present say nothing , and think as little , perhaps , as might be . She had taken the jump , and therefore why should she not be gracious to him ? But how was she to be gracious to a lover who stood there with his back turned to her ? After the interval of a minute or two he remembered himself , and turned round . Seeing her seated , he approached her , and went down on both knees close at her feet . Then he took her hands again , for the third time , and looked up into her eyes . "

One was from Lady Laura Kennedy to her friend Phineas Finn , and the other from Violet to her aunt , Lady Baldock . No letter was written to Lord Brentford , as it was thought desirable that he should receive the first intimation of what had been done from his son . Respecting the letter to Phineas , which shall be first given , Lady Laura thought it right to say a word to her husband . He had been of course told of the engagement , and had replied that he could have wished that the arrangement could have been made elsewhere than at his house , knowing as he did that Lady Baldock would not approve of it . To this Lady Laura had made no reply , and Mr. Kennedy had condescended to congratulate the bride - elect .

213594	213595	213575	213575	I	0	" "
213606	213607	213608	213608	I	0	" "
213621	213622	213614	213614	him	329	" "
213641	213657	213658	213658	You	0	" asked Mr. Kennedy . His wife made no answer , and then he continued - "
213670	213671	213658	213658	You	0	" "
213680	213681	213678	213678	Robert	343	" "
213690	214304	213678	213678	Robert	343	" Then Mr. Kennedy walked away , and was certain that his wife had deceived him about the duel . There had been a duel , and she had known it ; and yet she had told him that the report was a ridiculous fabrication . He never forgot anything . He remembered at this moment the words of the falsehood , and the look of her face as she told it . He had believed her implicitly , but he would never believe her again . He was one of those men who , in spite of their experience of the world , of their experience of their own lives , imagine that lips that have once lied can never tell the truth . Lady Laura 's letter to Phineas was as follows : Loughlinter , December 28th , 186 - . MY DEAR FRIEND , Violet Effingham is here , and Oswald has just left us . It is possible that you may see him as he passes through London . But , at any rate , I think it best to let you know immediately that she has accepted him , - at last . If there be any pang in this to you , be sure that I will grieve for you . You will not wish me to say that I regret that which was the dearest wish of my heart before I knew you . Lately , indeed , I have been torn in two ways . You will understand what I mean , and I believe I need say nothing more ; - except this , that it shall be among my prayers that you may obtain all things that may tend to make you happy , honourable , and of high esteem . Your most sincere friend LAURA KENNEDY . Even though her husband should read the letter , there was nothing in that of which she need be ashamed . But he did not read the letter . He simply speculated as to its contents , and inquired within himself whether it would not be for the welfare of the world in general , and for the welfare of himself in particular , that husbands should demand to read their wives ' letters . And this was Violet 's letter to her aunt : - MY DEAR AUNT , The thing has come at last , and all your troubles will be soon over ; - for I do believe that all your troubles have come from your unfortunate niece . At last I am going to be married , and thus take myself off your hands . Lord Chiltern has just been here , and I have accepted him . I am afraid you hardly think so well of Lord Chiltern as I do ; but then , perhaps , you have not known him so long . You do know , however , that there has been some difference between him and his father . I think I may take upon myself to say that now , upon his engagement , this will be settled . I have the inexpressible pleasure of feeling sure that Lord Brentford will welcome me as his daughter - in - law . Tell the news to Augusta with my best love . I will write to her in a day or two . I hope my cousin Gustavus will condescend to give me away . Of course there is nothing fixed about time ; - but I should say , perhaps , in nine years . Your affectionate niece , VIOLET EFFINGHAM . Loughlinter , Friday . "
214313	214321	214307	214307	she	5669	" said Lady Baldock in her wrath . "
214326	214332	214335	214335	she	5669	" said the mild Augusta . "
214348	215100	214335	214335	she	5669	" said Lady Baldock . CHAPTER LIII Showing How Phineas Bore the Blow When Phineas received Lady Laura Kennedy 's letter , he was sitting in his gorgeous apartment in the Colonial Office . It was gorgeous in comparison with the very dingy room at Mr. Low 's to which he had been accustomed in his early days , - and somewhat gorgeous also as compared with the lodgings he had so long inhabited in Mr. Bunce 's house . The room was large and square , and looked out from three windows on to St. James 's Park . There were in it two very comfortable arm - chairs and a comfortable sofa . And the office table at which he sat was of old mahogany , shining brightly , and seemed to be fitted up with every possible appliance for official comfort . This stood near one of the windows , so that he could sit and look down upon the park . And there was a large round table covered with books and newspapers . And the walls of the room were bright with maps of all the colonies . And there was one very interesting map , - but not very bright , - showing the American colonies , as they used to be . And there was a little inner closet in which he could brush his hair and wash his hands ; and in the room adjoining there sat , - or ought to have sat , for he was often absent , vexing the mind of Phineas , - the Earl 's nephew , his private secretary . And it was all very gorgeous . Often as he looked round upon it , thinking of his old bedroom at Killaloe , of his little garrets at Trinity , of the dingy chambers in Lincoln 's Inn , he would tell himself that it was very gorgeous . He would wonder that anything so grand had fallen to his lot . The letter from Scotland was brought to him in the afternoon , having reached London by some day - mail from Glasgow . He was sitting at his desk with a heap of papers before him referring to a contemplated railway from Halifax , in Nova Scotia , to the foot of the Rocky Mountains . It had become his business to get up the subject , and then discuss with his principal , Lord Cantrip , the expediency of advising the Government to lend a company five million of money , in order that this railway might be made . It was a big subject , and the contemplation of it gratified him . It required that he should look forward to great events , and exercise the wisdom of a statesman . What was the chance of these colonies being swallowed up by those other regions , - once colonies , - of which the map that hung in the corner told so eloquent a tale ? And if so , would the five million ever be repaid ? And if not swallowed up , were the colonies worth so great an adventure of national money ? Could they repay it ? Would they do so ? Should they be made to do so ? Mr. Low , who was now a Q.C. and in Parliament , would not have greater subjects than this before him , even if he should come to be Solicitor General . Lord Cantrip had specially asked him to get up this matter , - and he was getting it up sedulously . Once in nine years the harbour of Halifax was blocked up by ice . He had just jotted down the fact , which was material , when Lady Laura 's letter was brought to him . He read it , and putting it down by his side very gently , went back to his maps as though the thing would not so trouble his mind as to disturb his work . He absolutely wrote , automatically , certain words of a note about the harbour , after he had received the information . A horse will gallop for some scores of yards , after his back has been broken , before he knows of his great ruin ; - and so it was with Phineas Finn . His back was broken , but , nevertheless , he galloped , for a yard or two . "
215110	215146	214335	214335	she	5669	" Then he began to be aware that his back was broken , and that the writing of any more notes about the ice in Halifax harbour was for the present out of the question . "
215162	216086	216087	216087	Halloa	650	" These were the words which he read the oftenest . Then it was all over ! The game was played out , and all his victories were as nothing to him . He sat for an hour in his gorgeous room thinking of it , and various were the answers which he gave during the time to various messages ; - but he would see nobody . As for the colonies , he did not care if they revolted to - morrow . He would have parted with every colony belonging to Great Britain to have gotten the hand of Violet Effingham for himself . Now , - now at this moment , he told himself with oaths that he had never loved any one but Violet Effingham . There had been so much to make such a marriage desirable ! I should wrong my hero deeply were I to say that the weight of his sorrow was occasioned by the fact that he had lost an heiress . He would never have thought of looking for Violet Effingham had he not first learned to love her . But as the idea opened itself out to him , everything had seemed to be so suitable . Had Miss Effingham become his wife , the mouths of the Lows and of the Bunces would have been stopped altogether . Mr. Monk would have come to his house as his familiar guest , and he would have been connected with half a score of peers . A seat in Parliament would be simply his proper place , and even Under - Secretaryships of State might soon come to be below him . He was playing a great game , but hitherto he had played it with so much success , - with such wonderful luck ! that it had seemed to him that all things were within his reach . Nothing more had been wanting to him than Violet 's hand for his own comfort , and Violet 's fortune to support his position ; and these , too , had almost seemed to be within his grasp . His goddess had indeed refused him , - but not with disdain . Even Lady Laura had talked of his marriage as not improbable . All the world , almost , had heard of the duel ; and all the world had smiled , and seemed to think that in the real fight Phineas Finn would be the victor , - that the lucky pistol was in his hands . It had never occurred to any one to suppose , - as far as he could see , - that he was presuming at all , or pushing himself out of his own sphere , in asking Violet Effingham to be his wife . No ; - he would trust his luck , would persevere , and would succeed . Such had been his resolution on that very morning , - and now there had come this letter to dash him to the ground . There were moments in which he declared to himself that he would not believe the letter , - not that there was any moment in which there was in his mind the slightest spark of real hope . But he would tell himself that he would still persevere . Violet might have been driven to accept that violent man by violent influence , - or it might be that she had not in truth accepted him , that Chiltern had simply so asserted . Or , even if it were so , did women never change their minds ? The manly thing would be to persevere to the end . Had he not before been successful , when success seemed to be as far from him ? But he could buoy himself up with no real hope . Even when these ideas were present to his mind , he knew , - he knew well , - at those very moments , that his back was broken . Some one had come in and lighted the candles and drawn down the blinds while he was sitting there , and now , as he looked at his watch , he found that it was past five o'clock . He was engaged to dine with Madame Max Goesler at eight , and in his agony he half - resolved that he would send an excuse . Madame Max would be full of wrath , as she was very particular about her little dinner - parties ; - but , what did he care now about the wrath of Madame Max Goesler ? And yet only this morning he had been congratulating himself , among his other successes , upon her favour , and had laughed inwardly at his own falseness , - his falseness to Violet Effingham , - as he did so . He had said something to himself jocosely about lovers ' perjuries , the remembrance of which was now very bitter to him . He took up a sheet of note - paper and scrawled an excuse to Madame Goesler . News from the country , he said , made it impossible that he should go out to - night . But he did not send the note . At about half - past five he opened the door of his private secretary 's room and found the young man fast asleep , with a cigar in his mouth . "
216091	216095	216089	216089	Charles	554	" he said . "
216099	216145	216089	216089	Charles	554	" Charles Standish was a first cousin of Lady Laura 's , and , having been in the office before Phineas had joined it , and being a great favourite with his cousin , had of course become the Under - Secretary 's private secretary . "
216151	216162	216163	216163	I	0	" said Charles Standish , getting up and shaking himself . "
216202	216203	216200	216200	Charles	651	" "
216208	216519	216200	216200	Charles	651	" said his private secretary , who was very fond of his master , but not very respectful , - unless upon express occasions . Then Phineas went out and walked across the park ; but as he went he became quite aware that his back was broken . It was not the less broken because he sang to himself little songs to prove to himself that it was whole and sound . It was broken , and it seemed to him now that he never could become an Atlas again , to bear the weight of the world upon his shoulders . What did anything signify ? All that he had done had been part of a game which he had been playing throughout , and now he had been beaten in his game . He absolutely ignored his old passion for Lady Laura as though it had never been , and regarded himself as a model of constancy , - as a man who had loved , not wisely perhaps , but much too well , - and who must now therefore suffer a living death . He hated Parliament . He hated the Colonial Office . He hated his friend Mr. Monk ; and he especially hated Madame Max Goesler . As to Lord Chiltern , - he believed that Lord Chiltern had obtained his object by violence . He would see to that ! Yes ; - let the consequences be what they might , he would see to that ! He went up by the Duke of York 's column , and as he passed the Athenaeum he saw his chief , Lord Cantrip , standing under the portico talking to a bishop . He would have gone on unnoticed , had it been possible ; but Lord Cantrip came down to him at once . "
216528	216533	216520	216520	I	0	" said his lordship . "
216539	216557	216520	216520	I	0	" said Phineas , who was profoundly indifferent at this moment to all the clubs in London . "
216592	216593	216584	216584	they	5674	" "
216596	216634	216584	216584	they	5674	" ejaculated Phineas . But Lord Cantrip took the tone of voice as simply suggestive of humility , and suspected nothing of that profound indifference to all ministers and ministerial honours which Phineas had intended to express . "
216641	216657	216584	216584	they	5674	" said Lord Cantrip , putting his arm through that of the Under - Secretary , "
216681	216938	216678	216678	you	5672	" And so the Secretary of State went on about the Rocky Mountain Railroad , and Phineas strove hard to bear his burden with his broken back . He was obliged to say something about the guarantees , and the railway , and the frozen harbour , - and something especially about the difficulties which would be found , not in the measures themselves , but in the natural pugnacity of the Opposition . In the fabrication of garments for the national wear , the great thing is to produce garments that shall , as far as possible , defy hole - picking . It may be , and sometimes is , the case , that garments so fabricated will be good also for wear . Lord Cantrip , at the present moment , was very anxious and very ingenious in the stopping of holes ; and he thought that perhaps his Under - Secretary was too much prone to the indulgence of large philanthropical views without sufficient thought of the hole - pickers . But on this occasion , by the time that he reached Brooks 's , he had been enabled to convince his Under - Secretary , and though he had always thought well of his Under - Secretary , he thought better of him now than ever he had done . Phineas during the whole time had been meditating what he could do to Lord Chiltern when they two should meet . Could he take him by the throat and smite him ? "
216956	216967	216968	216968	He	652	" said Lord Cantrip , stopping opposite to the club . "
216983	217117	217118	217119	A man	749	" Now Mr. Broderick was a gentleman in the House looking for promotion in a Conservative Government , and of course would oppose any measure that could be brought forward by the Cantrip - Finn Colonial Administration . Then Lord Cantrip slipped into the club , and Phineas went on alone . A spark of his old ambition with reference to Brooks 's was the first thing to make him forget his misery for a moment . He had asked Lord Brentford to put his name down , and was not sure whether it had been done . The threat of Mr. Broderick 's opposition had been of no use towards the strengthening of his broken back , but the sight of Lord Cantrip hurrying in at the coveted door did do something . "
217131	217137	217118	217119	A man	749	" he said to himself ; "
217160	217353	217354	217356	Dear Mr. Jones	654	" Thereupon he went home , and after sitting for an hour over his own fire , and looking wistfully at a little treasure which he had , - a treasure obtained by some slight fraud at Saulsby , and which he now chucked into the fire , and then instantly again pulled out of it , soiled but unscorched , - he dressed himself for dinner , and went out to Madame Max Goesler 's . Upon the whole , he was glad that he had not sent the note of excuse . A man must live , even though his heart be broken , and living he must dine . Madame Max Goesler was fond of giving little dinners at this period of the year , before London was crowded , and when her guests might probably not be called away by subsequent social arrangements . Her number seldom exceeded six or eight , and she always spoke of these entertainments as being of the humblest kind . She sent out no big cards . She preferred to catch her people as though by chance , when that was possible . "
217388	217732	217381	217381	you	654	" And then there was a studious absence of parade . The dishes were not very numerous . The bill of fare was simply written out once , for the mistress , and so circulated round the table . Not a word about the things to be eaten or the things to be drunk was ever spoken at the table , - or at least no such word was ever spoken by Madame Goesler . But , nevertheless , they who knew anything about dinners were aware that Madame Goesler gave very good dinners indeed . Phineas Finn was beginning to flatter himself that he knew something about dinners , and had been heard to assert that the soups at the cottage in Park Lane were not to be beaten in London . But he cared for no soup to - day , as he slowly made his way up Madame Goesler 's staircase . There had been one difficulty in the way of Madame Goesler 's dinner - parties which had required some patience and great ingenuity in its management . She must either have ladies , or she must not have them . There was a great allurement in the latter alternative ; but she knew well that if she gave way to it , all prospect of general society would for her be closed , - and for ever . This had been in the early days of her widowhood in Park Lane . She cared but little for women 's society ; but she knew well that the society of gentlemen without women would not be that which she desired . She knew also that she might as effectually crush herself and all her aspirations by bringing to her house indifferent women , - women lacking something either in character , or in position , or in talent , - as by having none at all . Thus there had been a great difficulty , and sometimes she had thought that the thing could not be done at all . "
217745	218082	217733	217734	These English	5681	" And yet she would not have cared to succeed elsewhere than among the English . By degrees , however , the thing was done . Her prudence equalled her wit , and even suspicious people had come to acknowledge that they could not put their fingers on anything wrong . When Lady Glencora Palliser had once dined at the cottage in Park Lane , Madame Max Goesler had told herself that henceforth she did not care what the suspicious people said . Since that the Duke of Omnium had almost promised that he would come . If she could only entertain the Duke of Omnium she would have done everything . But there was no Duke of Omnium there to - night . At this time the Duke of Omnium was , of course , not in London . But Lord Fawn was there ; and our old friend Laurence Fitzgibbon , who had - resigned his place at the Colonial Office ; and there were Mr. and Mrs. Bonteen . They , with our hero , made up the party . No one doubted for a moment to what source Mr. Bonteen owed his dinner . Mrs. Bonteen was good - looking , could talk , was sufficiently proper , and all that kind of thing , - and did as well as any other woman at this time of year to keep Madame Max Goesler in countenance . There was never any sitting after dinner at the cottage ; or , I should rather say , there was never any sitting after Madame Goesler went ; so that the two ladies could not weary each other by being alone together . Mrs. Bonteen understood quite well that she was not required there to talk to her hostess , and was as willing as any woman to make herself agreeable to the gentlemen she might meet at Madame Goesler 's table . And thus Mr. and Mrs. Bonteen not unfrequently dined in Park Lane . "
218097	218108	218090	218092	that horrible man	5683	" said Madame Max Goesler , as she welcomed Phineas . "
218114	218115	218109	218109	He	5683	" "
218122	218126	218109	218109	He	5683	" said Phineas . "
218161	218280	218158	218158	he	5683	" And then , as Laurence Fitzgibbon entered the room , Madame Goesler rang the bell for dinner . Phineas found himself placed between his hostess and Mr. Bonteen , and Lord Fawn was on the other side of Madame Goesler . They were hardly seated at the table before some one stated it as a fact that Lord Brentford and his son were reconciled . Now Phineas knew , or thought that he knew , that this could not as yet be the case ; and indeed such was not the case , though the father had already received the son 's letter . But Phineas did not choose to say anything at present about Lord Chiltern . "
218286	218291	218158	218158	he	5683	" said Madame Goesler ; "
218302	218303	218294	218294	you	5685	" "
218315	218335	218306	218306	we	5688	" said Lord Fawn , who was known for the respect he had always paid to the fifth commandment . "
218354	218359	218306	218306	we	5688	" said Madame Goesler . "
218374	218375	218368	218369	Mr. Finn	329	" "
218383	218387	218376	218376	They	5692	" said Phineas . "
218419	218420	218438	218439	a lady	9734	" "
218430	218434	218438	218439	a lady	9734	" said Fitzgibbon . "
218446	218458	218438	218439	a lady	9734	" said Mrs. Bonteen , affecting to whisper to her neighbour . "
218471	218475	218459	218459	I	0	" said Fitzgibbon ; "
218486	218487	218481	218481	Phineas	329	" "
218497	218502	218488	218488	I	0	" said Mr. Bonteen . "
218551	218552	218540	218540	He	463	" "
218564	218710	218558	218559	Miss Effingham	351	" said Mrs. Bonteen , looking over at Phineas as she spoke . As there were two of Violet Effingham 's suitors at table , the subject was becoming disagreeably personal ; and the more so , as every one of the party knew or surmised something of the facts of the case . The cause of the duel at Blankenberg had become almost as public as the duel , and Lord Fawn 's courtship had not been altogether hidden from the public eye . He on the present occasion might probably be able to carry himself better than Phineas , even presuming him to be equally eager in his love , - for he knew nothing of the fatal truth . But he was unable to hear Mrs. Bonteen 's statement with indifference , and showed his concern in the matter by his reply . "
218720	218724	218711	218712	Any lady	5696	" he said , "
218754	218755	218729	218729	Chiltern	463	" "
218763	218768	218758	218761	a very good fellow	5700	" said Laurence Fitzgibbon . "
218774	218779	218758	218761	a very good fellow	5700	" said Mrs. Bonteen . "
218792	218797	218758	218761	a very good fellow	5700	" said her husband . "
218806	218811	218798	218798	I	0	" said Lord Fawn . "
218820	218826	218818	218818	him	463	" said Madame Max Goesler . "
218857	218878	218848	218848	you	0	" Phineas did not know what to say , or how to open his mouth without showing his deep concern . "
218891	218907	218879	218879	I	0	" he replied , as though the question had been put to him in earnest ; "
218924	218925	218926	218926	You	0	" "
218937	218972	218973	218973	She	351	" asked Mrs. Bonteen . He paused a moment before he spoke , and then made his answer in a deep solemn voice , - with a seriousness which he was unable to repress . "
218978	218982	218973	218973	She	351	" he said . "
218991	218996	218987	218987	you	0	" said Madame Goesler . "
219007	219221	219000	219000	I	0	" Had anybody told him beforehand that he would openly make this declaration at Madame Goesler 's table , he would have said that of all things it was the most impossible . He would have declared that nothing would have induced him to speak of Violet Effingham in his existing frame of mind , and that he would have had his tongue cut out before he spoke of her as the promised bride of his rival . And now he had declared the whole truth of his own wretchedness and discomfiture . He was well aware that all of them there knew why he had fought the duel at Blankenberg ; - all , that is , except perhaps Lord Fawn . And he felt as he made the statement as to Lord Chiltern that he blushed up to his forehead , and that his voice was strange , and that he was telling the tale of his own disgrace . But when the direct question had been asked him he had been unable to refrain from answering it directly . He had thought of turning it off with some jest or affectation of drollery , but had failed . At the moment he had been unable not to speak the truth . "
219231	219242	219222	219222	I	0	" said Lord Fawn , - who also forgot himself . "
219254	219268	219249	219250	Mr. Finn	329	" said Mrs. Bonteen , who rather liked the confusion she had caused . "
219278	219283	219276	219276	Finn	329	" asked Mr. Bonteen . "
219294	219298	219291	219291	me	0	" said Phineas . "
219305	219310	219291	219291	me	0	" said Madame Goesler . "
219316	219321	219322	219322	I	0	" said Lord Fawn . "
219360	219564	219582	219583	a supporter	5707	" Now , Lord Fawn in making his proposals had been magnanimous in his offers as to settlements and pecuniary provisions generally . For some minutes after that Phineas did not speak another word , and the conversation generally was not so brisk and bright as it was expected to be at Madame Goesler 's . Madame Max Goesler herself thoroughly understood our hero 's position , and felt for him . She would have encouraged no questionings about Violet Effingham had she thought that they would have led to such a result , and now she exerted herself to turn the minds of her guests to other subjects . At last she succeeded ; and after a while , too , Phineas himself was able to talk . He drank two or three glasses of wine , and dashed away into politics , taking the earliest opportunity in his power of contradicting Lord Fawn very plainly on one or two matters . Laurence Fitzgibbon was of course of opinion that the ministry could not stay in long . Since he had left the Government the ministers had made wonderful mistakes , and he spoke of them quite as an enemy might speak . "
219570	219575	219576	219576	you	440	" said Mr. Bonteen , "
219585	219586	219576	219576	you	440	" "
219601	219605	219596	219596	I	0	" said Laurence . "
219610	219616	219596	219596	I	0	" said Madame Max Goesler , "
219759	219850	219851	219851	I	0	" All this was rather severe upon Laurence Fitzgibbon ; but he was a man of the world , and bore it better than Phineas had borne his defeat . The dinner , taken altogether , was not a success , and so Madame Goesler understood . Lord Fawn , after he had been contradicted by Phineas , hardly opened his mouth . Phineas himself talked rather too much and rather too loudly ; and Mrs. Bonteen , who was well enough inclined to flatter Lord Fawn , contradicted him . "
219856	219862	219851	219851	I	0	" said Madame Goesler afterwards , "
219891	219899	219900	219900	My	0	" This she said to Mrs. Bonteen . "
219905	219910	219900	219900	My	0	" said Mrs. Bonteen , "
219930	219952	219922	219923	two claimants	5720	" In the drawing - room up - stairs Madame Goesler managed to be alone for three minutes with Phineas Finn . "
219963	220011	219957	219957	you	348	" she asked . Her voice was plaintive and soft , and there was a look of real sympathy in her eyes . Phineas almost felt that if they two had been quite alone he could have told her everything , and have wept at her feet . "
220014	220018	219957	219957	you	348	" he said , "
220023	220024	220025	220025	I	0	" "
220048	220049	220036	220036	I	0	" "

220186	220187	220202	220203	Mr. Finn	329	" "
220193	220194	220202	220203	Mr. Finn	329	" "

220261	220368	220253	220253	you	329	" Then Phineas promised that he would come soon ; and felt as he made the promise that he would have an opportunity of talking over his love with his new friend at any rate without fresh shame as to his failure . Laurence Fitzgibbon went away with Phineas , and Mr. Bonteen , having sent his wife away by herself , walked off towards the clubs with Lord Fawn . He was very anxious to have a few words with Lord Fawn . Lord Fawn had evidently been annoyed by Phineas , and Mr. Bonteen did not at all love the young Under - Secretary . "
220381	220394	220395	220395	Monk	346	" said he , as he linked himself on to the lord , "
220412	220413	220414	220414	I	0	" "
220428	220433	220422	220422	he	5727	" said Lord Fawn . "

220455	220460	220422	220422	he	5727	" said Lord Fawn . "
220505	220506	220493	220495	Lady Laura Kennedy	344	" "
220515	220520	220493	220495	Lady Laura Kennedy	344	" said Mr. Bonteen . "
220534	220535	220536	220537	A man	749	" "
220550	220559	220536	220537	A man	749	" said Lord Fawn , thinking of Chiltern . "
220565	220574	220536	220537	A man	749	" said Mr. Bonteen , thinking of Phineas . "
220596	220597	220598	220598	He	749	" "
220606	220611	220598	220598	He	749	" said Mr. Bonteen . "
220617	220618	220614	220614	you	5734	" "
220622	220623	220619	220620	Phineas Finn	329	" "
220681	221107	221108	221108	He	5743	" Then Mr. Bonteen felt himself to be snubbed , and soon afterwards left Lord Fawn alone . CHAPTER LIV Consolation On the day following Madame Goesler 's dinner party , Phineas , though he was early at his office , was not able to do much work , still feeling that as regarded the realities of the world , his back was broken . He might no doubt go on learning , and , after a time , might be able to exert himself in a perhaps useful , but altogether uninteresting kind of way , doing his work simply because it was there to be done , - as the carter or the tailor does his ; - and from the same cause , knowing that a man must have bread to live . But as for ambition , and the idea of doing good , and the love of work for work 's sake , - as for the elastic springs of delicious and beneficent labour , - all that was over for him . He would have worked from day till night , and from night till day , and from month till month throughout the year to have secured for Violet Effingham the assurance that her husband 's position was worthy of her own . But now he had no motive for such work as this . As long as he took the public pay , he would earn it ; and that was all . On the next day things were a little better with him . He received a note in the morning from Lord Cantrip saying that they two were to see the Prime Minister that evening , in order that the whole question of the railway to the Rocky Mountains might be understood , and Phineas was driven to his work . Before the time of the meeting came he had once more lost his own identity in great ideas of colonial welfare , and had planned and peopled a mighty region on the Red River , which should have no sympathy with American democracy . When he waited upon Mr. Gresham in the afternoon he said nothing about the mighty region ; indeed , he left it to Lord Cantrip to explain most of the proposed arrangements , - speaking only a word or two here and there as occasion required . But he was aware that he had so far recovered as to be able to save himself from losing ground during the interview . "
221124	221133	221108	221108	He	5743	" said Mr. Gresham to his colleague afterwards . "
221142	221202	221138	221140	a terrible fellow	5747	" said Lord Cantrip , shaking his head . On the fourth day after his sorrow had befallen him , Phineas went again to the cottage in Park Lane . And in order that he might not be balked in his search for sympathy he wrote a line to Madame Goesler to ask if she would be at home . "
221221	221430	221431	221431	I	0	" That was the answer from Marie Max Goesler , and Phineas was of course at the cottage a few minutes after five . It is not , I think , surprising that a man when he wants sympathy in such a calamity as that which had now befallen Phineas Finn , should seek it from a woman . Women sympathise most effectually with men , as men do with women . But it is , perhaps , a little odd that a man when he wants consolation because his heart has been broken , always likes to receive it from a pretty woman . One would be disposed to think that at such a moment he would be profoundly indifferent to such a matter , that no delight could come to him from female beauty , and that all he would want would be the softness of a simply sympathetic soul . But he generally wants a soft hand as well , and an eye that can be bright behind the mutual tear , and lips that shall be young and fresh as they express their concern for his sorrow . All these things were added to Phineas when he went to Madame Goesler in his grief . "
221439	221444	221431	221431	I	0	" said Madame Max . "
221456	221457	221445	221445	You	5749	" "

221625	221699	221700	221700	I	0	" said Madame Goesler . Phineas thought a moment of that matter before he replied . All the Standish family had been very good to him , and Violet Effingham had been very good . It was not the fault of any of them that he was now wretched and back - broken . He had meditated much on this , and had resolved that he would not even think evil of them . "

222531	222569	222570	222571	A prince	5793	" Then she sang the old well - worn verse of the Scotch song with wonderful spirit , and with a clearness of voice and knowledge of music for which he had hitherto never given her credit . "
222606	222607	222600	222600	he	5797	" "
222619	222620	222616	222617	Madame Goesler	348	" "
222651	222660	222640	222640	I	0	" Then she sang the whole song , - "
222671	222678	222661	222662	A man	749	" she said as she finished . "
222702	222709	222712	222712	maidens	9386	" Then she sang again : - "
222730	222731	222712	222712	maidens	9386	" "
222739	222743	222733	222734	young Lochinvar	660	" said Phineas . "

222812	222813	222808	222808	he	463	" "
222916	223042	223043	223043	He	5811	" She gave him her hand , which was very soft , and left it for a moment in his , and he was consoled . Madame Goesler , when she was alone , threw herself on to her chair and began to think of things . In these days she would often ask herself what in truth was the object of her ambition , and the aim of her life . Now at this moment she had in her hand a note from the Duke of Omnium . The Duke had allowed himself to say something about a photograph , which had justified her in writing to him , - or which she had taken for such justification . And the Duke had replied . "
223047	223051	223043	223043	He	5811	" he said , "
223072	223327	223328	223328	My	0	" It would be a great success to have the Duke of Omnium at her house , - but to what would the success reach ? What was her definite object , - or had she any ? In what way could she make herself happy ? She could not say that she was happy yet . The hours with her were too long and the days too many . The Duke of Omnium should come , - if he would . And she was quite resolved as to this , - that if the Duke did come she would not be afraid of him . Heavens and earth ! What would be the feelings of such a woman as her , were the world to greet her some fine morning as Duchess of Omnium ! Then she made up her mind very resolutely on one subject . Should the Duke give her any opportunity she would take a very short time in letting him know what was the extent of her ambition . CHAPTER LV Lord Chiltern at Saulsby Lord Chiltern did exactly as he said he would do . He wrote to his father as he passed through Carlisle , and at once went on to his hunting at Willingford . But his letter was very stiff and ungainly , and it may be doubted whether Miss Effingham was not wrong in refusing the offer which he had made to her as to the dictation of it . He began his letter , "
223331	223545	223328	223328	My	0	" and did not much improve the style as he went on with it . The reader may as well see the whole letter ; - Railway Hotel , Carlisle , December 27 , 186 - . MY LORD , I am now on my way from Loughlinter to London , and write this letter to you in compliance with a promise made by me to my sister and to Miss Effingham . I have asked Violet to be my wife , and she has accepted me , and they think that you will be pleased to hear that this has been done . I shall be , of course , obliged , if you will instruct Mr. Edwards to let me know what you would propose to do in regard to settlements . Laura thinks that you will wish to see both Violet and myself at Saulsby . For myself , I can only say that , should you desire me to come , I will do so on receiving your assurance that I shall be treated neither with fatted calves nor with reproaches . I am not aware that I have deserved either . I am , my lord , yours affect . , CHILTERN . P.S. - My address will be "
223551	223616	223328	223328	My	0	" That last word , in which he half - declared himself to be joined in affectionate relations to his father , caused him a world of trouble . But he could find no term for expressing , without a circumlocution which was disagreeable to him , exactly that position of feeling towards his father which really belonged to him . He would have written "
223621	223623	223328	223328	My	0	" or "
223629	223631	223328	223328	My	0	" or "
223636	223638	223328	223328	My	0	" or "
223645	224096	223328	223328	My	0	" exactly in accordance with the state of his father 's mind , if he had only known what was that state . He was afraid of going beyond his father in any offer of reconciliation , and was firmly fixed in his resolution that he would never be either repentant or submissive in regard to the past . If his father had wishes for the future , he would comply with them if he could do so without unreasonable inconvenience , but he would not give way a single point as to things done and gone . If his father should choose to make any reference to them , his father must prepare for battle . The Earl was of course disgusted by the pertinacious obstinacy of his son 's letter , and for an hour or two swore to himself that he would not answer it . But it is natural that the father should yearn for the son , while the son 's feeling for the father is of a very much weaker nature . Here , at any rate , was that engagement made which he had ever desired . And his son had made a step , though it was so very unsatisfactory a step , towards reconciliation . When the old man read the letter a second time , he skipped that reference to fatted calves which had been so peculiarly distasteful to him , and before the evening had passed he had answered his son as follows ; - Saulsby , December 29 , 186 - . MY DEAR CHILTERN , I have received your letter , and am truly delighted to hear that dear Violet has accepted you as her husband . Her fortune will be very material to you , but she herself is better than any fortune . You have long known my opinion of her . I shall be proud to welcome her as a daughter to my house . I shall of course write to her immediately , and will endeavour to settle some early day for her coming here . When I have done so , I will write to you again , and can only say that I will endeavour to make Saulsby comfortable to you . Your affectionate father , BRENTFORD . Richards , the groom , is still here . You had perhaps better write to him direct about your horses . By the middle of February arrangements had all been made , and Violet met her lover at his father 's house . She in the meantime had been with her aunt , and had undergone a good deal of mild unceasing persecution . "
224101	224128	224099	224099	Violet	351	" said her aunt to her on her arrival at Baddingham , speaking with a solemnity that ought to have been terrible to the young lady , "
224139	224140	224129	224129	I	0	" "
224150	224154	224148	224148	aunt	1705	" said Violet . "
224161	224178	224155	224155	I	0	" said Lady Baldock , with an increase of awe - inspiring severity in her voice . "
224193	224197	224187	224187	you	1705	" said Violet . "
224220	224221	224228	224230	the soonest mended	5816	" "
224232	224240	224228	224230	the soonest mended	5816	" and Violet smiled as she spoke . "

224546	224590	224591	224594	that violent young man	5827	" The same thing was repeated over and over again during the month that Miss Effingham remained at Baddingham , but Lady Baldock had no power of interfering , and Violet bore her persecution bravely . Her future husband was generally spoken of as "
224596	224639	224591	224594	that violent young man	5827	" and hints were thrown out as to the personal injuries to which his wife might be possibly subjected . But the threatened bride only laughed , and spoke of these coming dangers as part of the general lot of married women . "
224659	224676	224679	224679	Baldock	341	" she once said . Now , the truth was , as Violet well knew , that "
224680	224721	224679	224679	Baldock	341	" had been dumb as a sheep before the shearers in the hands of his wife , and had never been known to do anything improper by those who had been most intimate with him even in his earlier days . "
224728	224734	224724	224724	Baldock	341	" said the outraged aunt , "
224753	224754	224724	224724	Baldock	341	" "
224766	224896	224898	224898	I	0	" said Violet . Lady Baldock would not argue the question any further , but stalked out of the room . Lady Laura Kennedy met them at Saulsby , having had something of a battle with her husband before she left her home to do so . When she told him of her desire to assist at this reconciliation between her father and brother , he replied by pointing out that her first duty was at Loughlinter , and before the interview was ended had come to express an opinion that that duty was very much neglected . She in the meantime had declared that she would go to Saulsby , or that she would explain to her father that she was forbidden by her husband to do so . "
224905	225192	224898	224898	I	0	" said Mr. Kennedy . In answer to which , Lady Laura told him that there were some marital commands which she should not consider it to be her duty to obey . When matters had come to this pass , it may be conceived that both Mr. Kennedy and his wife were very unhappy . She had almost resolved that she would take steps to enable her to live apart from her husband ; and he had begun to consider what course he would pursue if such steps were taken . The wife was subject to her husband by the laws both of God and man ; and Mr. Kennedy was one who thought much of such laws . In the meantime , Lady Laura carried her point and went to Saulsby , leaving her husband to go up to London and begin the session by himself . Lady Laura and Violet were both at Saulsby before Lord Chiltern arrived , and many were the consultations which were held between them as to the best mode in which things might be arranged . Violet was of opinion that there had better be no arrangement , that Lord Chiltern should be allowed to come in and take his father 's hand , and sit down to dinner , - and that so things should fall into their places . Lady Laura was rather in favour of some scene . But the interview had taken place before either of them were able to say a word . Lord Chiltern , on his arrival , had gone immediately to his father , taking the Earl very much by surprise , and had come off best in the encounter . "
225196	225210	224898	224898	I	0	" said he , walking up to his father with his hand out , "
225221	225347	225348	225348	Oswald	516	" He had written to his sister to say that he would be at Saulsby on that day , but had named no hour . He now appeared between ten and eleven in the morning , and his father had as yet made no preparation for him , - had arranged no appropriate words . He had walked in at the front door , and had asked for the Earl . The Earl was in his own morning - room , - a gloomy room , full of dark books and darker furniture , and thither Lord Chiltern had at once gone . The two women still were sitting together over the fire in the breakfast - room , and knew nothing of his arrival . "
225350	225355	225348	225348	Oswald	516	" said his father , "
225363	225364	225359	225359	you	516	" "
225386	225387	225390	225390	she	341	" "
225410	225424	225409	225409	I.	0	" And the father took the son 's hand for the second time . "
225430	225443	225428	225428	sir	8579	" said Lord Chiltern , looking his father full in the face . "
225454	225459	225444	225444	I	0	" continued the Earl . "
225470	225477	225462	225462	you	8579	" said the son , laughing . "
225545	225546	225548	225548	she	5836	" "
225551	225556	225548	225548	she	5836	" said the father . "
225574	225575	225566	225566	She	5836	" "
225587	225588	225578	225578	you	8579	" "
225643	225644	225634	225634	I	0	" "
225652	225790	225650	225650	Oswald	516	" said the Earl . And then Lord Brentford did make something of a shambling speech , in which he expressed a hope that they two might for the future live together on friendly terms , forgetting the past . He ought to have been prepared for the occasion , and the speech was poor and shambling . But I think that it was more useful than it might have been , had it been uttered roundly and with that paternal and almost majestic effect which he would have achieved had he been thoroughly prepared . But the roundness and the majesty would have gone against the grain with his son , and there would have been a danger of some outbreak . As it was , Lord Chiltern smiled , and muttered some word about things being "
225794	225805	225650	225650	Oswald	516	" and then made his way out of the room . "
225817	225823	225813	225813	I	0	" he said to himself ; "
225837	226033	226034	226034	You	5840	" But there was still a fear upon him that his father even yet might prepare a speech , and speak it , to the great peril of their mutual comfort . His meeting with Violet was of course pleasant enough . Now that she had succumbed , and had told herself and had told him that she loved him , she did not scruple to be as generous as a maiden should be who has acknowledged herself to be conquered , and has rendered herself to the conqueror . She would walk with him and ride with him , and take a lively interest in the performances of all his horses , and listen to hunting stories as long as he chose to tell them . In all this , she was so good and so loving that Lady Laura was more than once tempted to throw in her teeth her old , often - repeated assertions , that she was not prone to be in love , - that it was not her nature to feel any ardent affection for a man , and that , therefore , she would probably remain unmarried . "
226043	226054	226034	226034	You	5840	" Violet said , in answer to one such attack . "
226077	226078	226065	226065	you	5840	" "
226086	226090	226079	226079	I	0	" said Violet , "
226146	226262	226267	226267	he	5845	" All of which set Lady Laura thinking whether her friend had not been wiser than she had been . She had never known anything of that sort of friendship with her husband which already seemed to be quite established between these two . In her misery one day Lady Laura told the whole story of her own unhappiness to her brother , saying nothing of Phineas Finn , - thinking nothing of him as she told her story , but speaking more strongly perhaps than she should have done , of the terrible dreariness of her life at Loughlinter , and of her inability to induce her husband to alter it for her sake . "
226275	226306	226267	226267	he	5845	" said the brother , with a scowl on his face which seemed to indicate that he would like no task better than that of resenting such ill - treatment . "
226318	226319	226321	226321	he	5845	" "
226332	226333	226334	226334	He	5845	" "
226366	226367	226358	226358	he	5845	" "
226373	226374	226375	226375	He	5845	" "

226489	226490	226487	226487	Violet	341	" "
226493	226494	226487	226487	Violet	341	" "
226501	226502	226505	226505	she	341	" "
226554	226555	226556	226556	I	0	" "

226655	227050	226647	226647	I	0	" But in truth neither of Lady Laura 's councillors was able to give her advice that could serve her . She felt that she could not leave her husband without other cause than now existed , although she felt , also , that to go back to him was to go back to utter wretchedness . And when she saw Violet and her brother together there came to her dreams of what might have been her own happiness had she kept herself free from those terrible bonds in which she was now held a prisoner . She could not get out of her heart the remembrance of that young man who would have been her lover , if she would have let him , - of whose love for herself she had been aware before she had handed herself over as a bale of goods to her unloved , unloving husband . She had married Mr. Kennedy because she was afraid that otherwise she might find herself forced to own that she loved that other man who was then a nobody ; - almost nobody . It was not Mr. Kennedy 's money that had bought her . This woman in regard to money had shown herself to be as generous as the sun . But in marrying Mr. Kennedy she had maintained herself in her high position , among the first of her own people , - among the first socially and among the first politically . But had she married Phineas , - had she become Lady Laura Finn , - there would have been a great descent . She could not have entertained the leading men of her party . She would not have been on a level with the wives and daughters of Cabinet Ministers . She might , indeed , have remained unmarried ! But she knew that had she done so , - had she so resolved , - that which she called her fancy would have been too strong for her . She would not have remained unmarried . At that time it was her fate to be either Lady Laura Kennedy or Lady Laura Finn . And she had chosen to be Lady Laura Kennedy . To neither Violet Effingham nor to her brother could she tell one half of the sorrow which afflicted her . "
227058	227065	227051	227051	I	0	" she said to her brother . "
227074	227078	227079	227079	I	0	" he answered . "

227256	227385	227415	227415	She	344	" Lord Chiltern remained ten days at Saulsby , and at last did not get away without a few unpleasant words with his father , - or without a few words that were almost unpleasant with his mistress . On his first arrival he had told his sister that he should go on a certain day , and some intimation to this effect had probably been conveyed to the Earl . But when his son told him one evening that the post - chaise had been ordered for seven o'clock the next morning , he felt that his son was ungracious and abrupt . There were many things still to be said , and indeed there had been no speech of any account made at all as yet . "
227391	227396	227415	227415	She	344	" said the Earl . "
227404	227405	227399	227399	Laura	344	" "

227504	227636	227502	227502	Oswald	516	" But the son made no sign of changing his plans ; and the father , seeing that he would not change them , became solemn and severe . There were a few words which he must say to his son , - something of a speech that he must make ; - so he led the way into the room with the dark books and the dark furniture , and pointed to a great deep arm - chair for his son 's accommodation . But as he did not sit down himself , neither did Lord Chiltern . Lord Chiltern understood very well how great is the advantage of a standing orator over a sitting recipient of his oratory , and that advantage he would not give to his father . "
227655	227660	227637	227637	I	0	" said the Earl . "
227670	227675	227661	227661	I	0	" said Lord Chiltern . "

227927	227942	227943	227943	You	516	" Lord Chiltern laughed as he said this , but did not laugh pleasantly . "
227954	227955	227943	227943	You	516	" "
227974	227975	227972	227972	drones	5873	" "

228279	228411	228266	228266	I	0	" All this made the Earl very angry , and from these things they went on to worse things . When questioned again as to the future , Lord Chiltern scowled , and at last declared that it was his idea to live abroad in the summer for his wife 's recreation , and somewhere down in the shires during the winter for his own . He would admit of no purpose higher than recreation , and when his father again talked to him of a nobleman 's duty , he said that he knew of no other special duty than that of not exceeding his income . Then his father made a longer speech than before , and at the end of it Lord Chiltern simply wished him good night . "
228434	228487	228490	228490	I	0	" Then he was off , and Lord Brentford was left there , standing with his back to the fire . After that Lord Chiltern had a discussion with Violet , which lasted nearly half the night ; and during the discussion she told him more than once that he was wrong . "
228501	228508	228492	228492	you	341	" he said , in anger . "
228517	228521	228522	228522	I	0	" she answered . "
228554	228822	228549	228549	I	0	" He swore to her as he pressed her to his heart that she was the finest , grandest , sweetest woman that ever the world had produced . But still there was present on his palate , when he left her , the bitter taste of her reprimand . CHAPTER LVI What the People in Marylebone Thought Phineas Finn , when the session began , was still hard at work upon his Canada bill , and in his work found some relief for his broken back . He went into the matter with all his energy , and before the debate came on , knew much more about the seven thousand inhabitants of some hundreds of thousands of square miles at the back of Canada , than he did of the people of London or of County Clare . And he found some consolation also in the good - nature of Madame Goesler , whose drawing - room was always open to him . He could talk freely now to Madame Goesler about Violet , and had even ventured to tell her that once , in old days , he had thought of loving Lady Laura Standish . He spoke of those days as being very old ; and then he perhaps said some word to her about dear little Mary Flood Jones . I think that there was not much in his career of which he did not say something to Madame Goesler , and that he received from her a good deal of excellent advice and encouragement in the direction of his political ambition . "
228828	228833	228823	228824	A man	749	" she said , - "
228895	229164	228886	228886	I	0	" Then Phineas of course told her that such sympathy from her was all and all to him . But the reader must not on this account suppose that he was untrue in his love to Violet Effingham . His back was altogether broken by his fall , and he was quite aware that such was the fact . Not as yet , at least , had come to him any remotest idea that a cure was possible . Early in March he heard that Lady Laura was up in town , and of course he was bound to go to her . The information was given to him by Mr. Kennedy himself , who told him that he had been to Scotland to fetch her . In these days there was an acknowledged friendship between these two , but there was no intimacy . Indeed , Mr. Kennedy was a man who was hardly intimate with any other man . With Phineas he now and then exchanged a few words in the lobby of the House , and when they chanced to meet each other , they met as friends . Mr. Kennedy had no strong wish to see again in his house the man respecting whom he had ventured to caution his wife ; but he was thoughtful ; and thinking over it all , he found it better to ask him there . No one must know that there was any reason why Phineas should not come to his house ; especially as all the world knew that Phineas had protected him from the garrotters . "
229172	229176	228886	228886	I	0	" he said ; "
229186	229268	229269	229269	You	5887	" Phineas of course promised that he would go . In these days Phineas was beginning to be aware that he had enemies , - though he could not understand why anybody should be his enemy now that Violet Effingham had decided against him . There was poor Laurence Fitzgibbon , indeed , whom he had superseded at the Colonial Office , but Laurence Fitzgibbon , to give merit where merit was due , felt no animosity against him at all . "
229319	229838	229313	229313	I	0	" And the poor idle Irishman , in so speaking , spoke the truth as well as he knew it . But the Ratlers and the Bonteens were Finn 's bitter foes , and did not scruple to let him know that such was the case . Barrington Erle had scruples on the subject , and in a certain mildly apologetic way still spoke well of the young man , whom he had himself first introduced into political life only four years since ; - but there was no earnestness or cordiality in Barrington Erle 's manner , and Phineas knew that his first staunch friend could no longer be regarded as a pillar of support . But there was a set of men , quite as influential , - so Phineas thought , - as the busy politicians of the club , who were very friendly to him . These were men , generally of high position , of steady character , - hard workers , - who thought quite as much of what a man did in his office as what he said in the House . Lords Cantrip , Thrift , and Fawn were of this class , - and they were all very courteous to Phineas . Envious men began to say of him that he cared little now for any one of the party who had not a handle to his name , and that he preferred to live with lords and lordlings . This was hard upon him , as the great political ambition of his life was to call Mr. Monk his friend ; and he would sooner have acted with Mr. Monk than with any other man in the Cabinet . But though Mr. Monk had not deserted him , there had come to be little of late in common between the two . His life was becoming that of a parliamentary official rather than that of a politician ; - whereas , though Mr. Monk was in office , his public life was purely political . Mr. Monk had great ideas of his own which he intended to hold , whether by holding them he might remain in office or be forced out of office ; and he was indifferent as to the direction which things in this respect might take with him . But Phineas , who had achieved his declared object in getting into place , felt that he was almost constrained to adopt the views of others , let them be what they might . Men spoke to him , as though his parliamentary career were wholly at the disposal of the Government , - as though he were like a proxy in Mr. Gresham 's pocket , - with this difference , that when directed to get up and speak on a subject he was bound to do so . This annoyed him , and he complained to Mr. Monk ; but Mr. Monk only shrugged his shoulders and told him that he must make his choice . He soon discovered Mr. Monk 's meaning . "
229908	230393	230399	230399	your	5892	" That was the meaning of what Mr. Monk said to him . After all , these official and parliamentary honours were greater when seen at a distance than he found them to be now that he possessed them . Mr. Low worked ten hours a day , and could rarely call a day his own ; but , after all , with all this work , Mr. Low was less of a slave , and more independent , than was he , Phineas Finn , Under - Secretary of State , the friend of Cabinet Ministers , and Member of Parliament since his twenty - fifth year ! He began to dislike the House , and to think it a bore to sit on the Treasury bench ; - he , who a few years since had regarded Parliament as the British heaven on earth , and who , since he had been in Parliament , had looked at that bench with longing envious eyes . Laurence Fitzgibbon , who seemed to have as much to eat and drink as ever , and a bed also to lie on , could come and go in the House as he pleased , since his - resignation . And there was a new trouble coming . The Reform Bill for England had passed ; but now there was to be another Reform Bill for Ireland . Let them pass what bill they might , this would not render necessary a new Irish election till the entire House should be dissolved . But he feared that he would be called upon to vote for the abolition of his own borough , - and for other points almost equally distasteful to him . He knew that he would not be consulted , - but would be called upon to vote , and perhaps to speak ; and was certain that if he did so , there would be war between him and his constituents . Lord Tulla had already communicated to him his ideas that , for certain excellent reasons , Loughshane ought to be spared . But this evil was , he hoped , a distant one . It was generally thought that , as the English Reform Bill had been passed last year , and as the Irish bill , if carried , could not be immediately operative , the doing of the thing might probably be postponed to the next session . When he first saw Lady Laura he was struck by the great change in her look and manner . She seemed to him to be old and worn , and he judged her to be wretched , - as she was . She had written to him to say that she would be at her father 's house on such and such a morning , and he had gone to her there . "
230405	230409	230399	230399	your	5892	" she said . "
230423	230446	230412	230413	nobody there	5893	" Later in the interview she told him not to come and dine there , even though Mr. Kennedy should ask him . "
230451	230455	230412	230413	nobody there	5893	" he demanded . "
230489	230516	230484	230484	she	9734	" There was a sort of smile on her face as she said this , but he could perceive that it was a very bitter smile . "

230864	230901	230840	230840	He	463	" There was a pause for a moment , and then Lady Laura answered him with a touch of scorn in her voice , - and with some scorn , too , in her eye : - "
230925	230926	230921	230923	some one else	934	" "

231098	231120	231091	231091	you	329	" Then she lost all control of herself , and poured out to him the real truth that was in her . "
231226	231252	231253	231253	You	329	" Then she walked away from him to the window , and he stood still , dumb , on the spot that he had occupied . "

231287	231549	231277	231278	a gentleman	1306	" The strong idea of his mind when he heard all this was the injustice of her attack , - of the attack as coming from her , who had all but openly acknowledged that she had married a man whom she had not loved because it suited her to escape from a man whom she did love . She was reproaching him now for his fickleness in having ventured to set his heart upon another woman , when she herself had been so much worse than fickle , - so profoundly false ! And yet he could not defend himself by accusing her . What would she have had of him ? What would she have proposed to him , had he questioned her as to his future , when they were together on the braes of Loughlinter ? Would she not have bid him to find some one else whom he could love ? Would she then have suggested to him the propriety of nursing his love for herself , - for her who was about to become another man 's wife , - for her after she should have become another man 's wife ? And yet because he had not done so , and because she had made herself wretched by marrying a man whom she did not love , she reproached him ! He could not tell her of all this , so he fell back for his defence on words which had passed between them since the day when they had met on the braes . "
231553	231557	231550	231551	Lady Laura	396	" he said , "

It is to be supposed that had he done so her reproaches would have been hot and heavy on him ; but yet it almost seemed to him as though he had no other alternative . No ! - He was not her father or her brother ; - nor could he be her husband . And at this very moment , as she knew , his heart was sore with love for another woman . And yet he hardly knew how not to throw himself at her feet , and swear , that he would return now and for ever to his old passion , hopeless , sinful , degraded as it would be . "

There had been something in the later words which Lady Laura had spoken that had made him feel almost unconsciously that the injustice of her reproaches was not so great as he had at first felt it to be , and that she had some cause for her scorn . If her case was such as she had so plainly described it , what was his plight as compared with hers ? He had lost his Violet , and was in pain . There must be much of suffering before him . But though Violet were lost , the world was not all blank before his eyes . He had not told himself , even in his dreariest moments , that there was before him "
232254	232373	232376	232376	you	5923	" And then he began to think whether this must in truth be the case with Lady Laura . What if Mr. Kennedy were to die ? What in such case as that would he do ? In ten or perhaps in five years time might it not be possible for him to go through the ceremony of falling upon his knees , with stiffened joints indeed , but still with something left of the ardour of his old love , of his oldest love of all ? As he was thinking of this he was brought up short in his walk as he was entering the Green Park beneath the Duke 's figure , by Laurence Fitzgibbon . "

He would have believed it less perhaps had he known that Laurence had just received the news from Mrs. Bonteen . CHAPTER LVII The Top Brick of the Chimney Madame Max Goesler was a lady who knew that in fighting the battles which fell to her lot , in arranging the social difficulties which she found in her way , in doing the work of the world which came to her share , very much more care was necessary , - and care too about things apparently trifling , - than was demanded by the affairs of people in general . And this was not the case so much on account of any special disadvantage under which she laboured , as because she was ambitious of doing the very uttermost with those advantages which she possessed . Her own birth had not been high , and that of her husband , we may perhaps say , had been very low . He had been old when she had married him , and she had had little power of making any progress till he had left her a widow . Then she found herself possessed of money , certainly ; of wit , - as she believed ; and of a something in her personal appearance which , as she plainly told herself , she might perhaps palm off upon the world as beauty . She was a woman who did not flatter herself , who did not strongly believe in herself , who could even bring herself to wonder that men and women in high position should condescend to notice such a one as her . With all her ambition , there was a something of genuine humility about her ; and with all the hardness she had learned there was a touch of womanly softness which would sometimes obtrude itself upon her heart . When she found a woman really kind to her , she would be very kind in return . And though she prized wealth , and knew that her money was her only rock of strength , she could be lavish with it , as though it were dirt . But she was highly ambitious , and she played her game with great skill and great caution . Her doors were not open to all callers ; - were shut even to some who find but few doors closed against them ; - were shut occasionally to those whom she most specially wished to see within them . She knew how to allure by denying , and to make the gift rich by delaying it . We are told by the Latin proverb that he who gives quickly gives twice ; but I say that she who gives quickly seldom gives more than half . When in the early spring the Duke of Omnium first knocked at Madame Max Goesler 's door , he was informed that she was not at home . The Duke felt very cross as he handed his card out from his dark green brougham , - on the panel of which there was no blazon to tell the owner 's rank . He was very cross . She had told him that she was always at home between four and six on a Thursday . He had condescended to remember the information , and had acted upon it , - and now she was not at home ! She was not at home , though he had come on a Thursday at the very hour she had named to him . Any duke would have been cross , but the Duke of Omnium was particularly cross . No ; - he certainly would give himself no further trouble by going to the cottage in Park Lane . And yet Madame Max Goesler had been in her own drawing - room , while the Duke was handing out his card from the brougham below . On the next morning there came to him a note from the cottage , - such a pretty note ! - so penitent , so full of remorse , - and , which was better still , so laden with disappointment , that he forgave her . MY DEAR DUKE , I hardly know how to apologise to you , after having told you that I am always at home on Thursdays ; and I was at home yesterday when you called . But I was unwell , and I had told the servant to deny me , not thinking how much I might be losing . Indeed , indeed , I would not have given way to a silly headache , had I thought that your Grace would have been here . I suppose that now I must not even hope for the photograph . Yours penitently , MARIE M. G. The note - paper was very pretty note - paper , hardly scented , and yet conveying a sense of something sweet , and the monogram was small and new , and fantastic without being grotesque , and the writing was of that sort which the Duke , having much experience , had learned to like , - and there was something in the signature which pleased him . So he wrote a reply , - DEAR MADAME MAX GOESLER , I will call again next Thursday , or , if prevented , will let you know . Yours faithfully , O. When the green brougham drew up at the door of the cottage on the next Thursday , Madame Goesler was at home , and had no headache . She was not at all penitent now . She had probably studied the subject , and had resolved that penitence was more alluring in a letter than when acted in person . She received her guest with perfect ease , and apologised for the injury done to him in the preceding week , with much self - complacency . "

233674	233679	233657	233657	I	0	" said the Duke , "

233839	234126	233834	233834	he	5944	" The Duke certainly was an old man , if a man turned of seventy be old ; - and he was a man too who did not bear his years with hearty strength . He moved slowly , and turned his limbs , when he did turn them , as though the joints were stiff in their sockets . But there was nevertheless about him a dignity of demeanour , a majesty of person , and an upright carriage which did not leave an idea of old age as the first impress on the minds of those who encountered the Duke of Omnium . He was tall and moved without a stoop ; and though he moved slowly , he had learned to seem so to do because it was the proper kind of movement for one so high up in the world as himself . And perhaps his tailor did something for him . He had not been long under Madame Max Goesler 's eyes before she perceived that his tailor had done a good deal for him . When he alluded to his own age and to her youth , she said some pleasant little word as to the difference between oak - trees and currant - bushes ; and by that time she was seated comfortably on her sofa , and the Duke was on a chair before her , - just as might have been any man who was not a Duke . After a little time the photograph was brought forth from his Grace 's pocket . That bringing out and giving of photographs , with the demand for counter photographs , is the most absurd practice of the day . "

234354	234377	234437	234437	She	7484	" That is just the reason you should dine with me . You shall meet nobody you do not wish to meet . "
234378	234418	234450	234450	she	7484	" I would so much rather see you in this way , - I would indeed . I do dine out occasionally , but it is at big formal parties , which I can not escape without giving offence . "
234419	234436	234437	234437	She	7484	" And you can not escape my little not formal party , - without giving offence . "
234481	234495	234463	234463	her	7484	" Name your own day , Duke . Will a Sunday suit you ? "

234813	234924	234805	234805	she	475	" And the movement of his Grace 's hand as he spoke seemed to indicate the widest possible sphere for travelling and the widest possible scope for adaptation . The dinner was arranged , and went off very pleasantly . Madame Goesler 's eyes were not quite so bright as they were during that morning visit , nor did she touch her guest 's arm in a manner so alluring . She was very quiet , allowing her guests to do most of the talking . But the dinner and the flowers and the wine were excellent , and the whole thing was so quiet that the Duke liked it . "

235193	235208	235186	235186	his	5983	" said Mr. Palliser somewhat proudly , - almost with a touch of anger . "
235270	235354	235264	235265	Lord Silverbridge	673	" Now the eldest son of the Duke of Omnium , when the Duke of Omnium had a son , was called the Earl of Silverbridge ; and Mr. Palliser , when this question was asked him , became very pale . Mr. Palliser knew well how thoroughly the cunning of the serpent was joined to the purity of the dove in the person of his wife , and he was sure that there was cause for fear when she hinted at danger . "
235365	235372	235356	235356	you	402	" he said to his wife . "
235377	235776	235375	235375	her	5990	" said Lady Glencora . When Madame Goesler dined at the Duke 's house in St. James 's Square there was a large party , and Lady Glencora knew that there was no need for apprehension then . Indeed Madame Goesler was no more than any other guest , and the Duke hardly spoke to her . There was a Duchess there , - the Duchess of St. Bungay , and old Lady Hartletop , who was a dowager marchioness , - an old lady who pestered the Duke very sorely , - and Madame Max Goesler received her reward , and knew that she was receiving it , in being asked to meet these people . Would not all these names , including her own , be blazoned to the world in the columns of the next day 's Morning Post ? There was no absolute danger here , as Lady Glencora knew ; and Lady Glencora , who was tolerant and begrudged nothing to Madame Max except the one thing , was quite willing to meet the lady at such a grand affair as this . But the Duke , even should he become ever so childish a child in his old age , still would have that plain green brougham at his command , and could go anywhere in that at any hour in the day . And then Madame Goesler was so manifestly a clever woman . A Duchess of Omnium might be said to fill , - in the estimation , at any rate , of English people , - the highest position in the world short of royalty . And the reader will remember that Lady Glencora intended to be a Duchess of Omnium herself , - unless some very unexpected event should intrude itself . She intended also that her little boy , her fair - haired , curly - pated , bold - faced little boy , should be Earl of Silverbridge when the sand of the old man should have run itself out . Heavens , what a blow would it be , should some little wizen - cheeked half - monkey baby , with black brows , and yellow skin , be brought forward and shown to her some day as the heir ! What a blow to herself ; - and what a blow to all England ! "
235789	235824	235777	235777	We	5991	" said her husband , who had his budget to bring forward that very night , and who in truth cared more for his budget than he did for his heirship at that moment . "

235854	236017	235849	235849	I	0	" At the time when she thus spoke , the dark green brougham had been twice again brought up at the door in Park Lane . And the brougham was standing there a third time . It was May now , the latter end of May , and the park opposite was beautiful with green things , and the air was soft and balmy , as it will be sometimes even in May , and the flowers in the balcony were full of perfume , and the charm of London , - what London can be to the rich , - was at its height . The Duke was sitting in Madame Goesler 's drawing - room , at some distance from her , for she had retreated . The Duke had a habit of taking her hand , which she never would permit for above a few seconds . At such times she would show no anger , but would retreat . "

236548	236552	236487	236487	Duke	353	" said Phineas . "

236861	237117	237118	237118	You	6041	" Mr. Monk and Phineas were dining together at Mr. Monk 's house , and the elder politician of the two in this little speech had recurred to certain matters which had already been discussed between them . Mr. Monk was becoming somewhat sick of his place in the Cabinet , though he had not as yet whispered a word of his sickness to any living ears ; and he had begun to pine for the lost freedom of a seat below the gangway . He had been discussing political honesty with Phineas , and hence had come the sermon of which I have ventured to reproduce the concluding denunciations . Phineas was fond of such discussions and fond of holding them with Mr. Monk , - in this matter fluttering like a moth round a candle . He would not perceive that as he had made up his mind to be a servant of the public in Parliament , he must abandon all idea of independent action ; and unless he did so he could be neither successful as regarded himself , or useful to the public whom he served . Could a man be honest in Parliament , and yet abandon all idea of independence ? When he put such questions to Mr. Monk he did not get a direct answer . And indeed the question was never put directly . But the teaching which he received was ever of a nature to make him uneasy . It was always to this effect : "
237147	237227	237136	237136	You	6041	" And yet Mr. Monk would on an occasion preach to him such a sermon as that which he had just uttered ! Perhaps there is no question more difficult to a man 's mind than that of the expediency or inexpediency of scruples in political life . Whether would a candidate for office be more liable to rejection from a leader because he was known to be scrupulous , or because he was known to be the reverse ? "
237245	237249	237250	237250	I	0	" said Phineas . "

237308	237957	237958	237958	I	0	" This trip to Ireland had been proposed in consequence of certain ideas respecting tenant - right which Mr. Monk was beginning to adopt , and as to which the minds of politicians were becoming moved . It had been all very well to put down Fenianism , and Ribandmen , and Repeal , - and everything that had been put down in Ireland in the way of rebellion for the last seventy - five years . England and Ireland had been apparently joined together by laws of nature so fixed , that even politicians liberal as was Mr. Monk , - liberal as was Mr. Turnbull , - could not trust themselves to think that disunion could be for the good of the Irish . They had taught themselves that it certainly could not be good for the English . But if it was incumbent on England to force upon Ireland the maintenance of the Union for her own sake , and for England 's sake , because England could not afford independence established so close against her own ribs , - it was at any rate necessary to England 's character that the bride thus bound in a compulsory wedlock should be endowed with all the best privileges that a wife can enjoy . Let her at least not be a kept mistress . Let it be bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh , if we are to live together in the married state . Between husband and wife a warm word now and then matters but little , if there be a thoroughly good understanding at bottom . But let there be that good understanding at bottom . What about this Protestant Church ; and what about this tenant - right ? Mr. Monk had been asking himself these questions for some time past . In regard to the Church , he had long made up his mind that the Establishment in Ireland was a crying sin . A man had married a woman whom he knew to be of a religion different from his own , and then insisted that his wife should say that she believed those things which he knew very well that she did not believe . But , as Mr. Monk well knew , the subject of the Protestant Endowments in Ireland was so difficult that it would require almost more than human wisdom to adjust it . It was one of those matters which almost seemed to require the interposition of some higher power , - the coming of some apparently chance event , - to clear away the evil ; as a fire comes , and pestilential alleys are removed ; as a famine comes , and men are driven from want and ignorance and dirt to seek new homes and new thoughts across the broad waters ; as a war comes , and slavery is banished from the face of the earth . But in regard to tenant - right , to some arrangement by which a tenant in Ireland might be at least encouraged to lay out what little capital he might have in labour or money without being at once called upon to pay rent for that outlay which was his own , as well as for the land which was not his own , - Mr. Monk thought that it was possible that if a man would look hard enough he might perhaps be able to see his way as to that . He had spoken to two of his colleagues on the subject , the two men in the Cabinet whom he believed to be the most thoroughly honest in their ideas as public servants , the Duke and Mr. Gresham . There was so much to be done ; - and then so little was known upon the subject ! "
237965	237970	237958	237958	I	0	" said Mr. Monk . "
237980	237986	237972	237972	you	0	" said Mr. Gresham , - "
237996	237997	237998	237998	I	0	" "
238019	238024	238007	238008	the Queen	7412	" said Mr. Monk . "
238034	238041	238007	238008	the Queen	7412	" said Mr. Gresham , laughing . "
238054	238201	238202	238202	I	0	" So the matter was disposed of at the time , but Mr. Monk did not abandon his idea . He rather felt himself the more bound to cling to it because he received so little encouragement . What was a seat in the Cabinet to him that he should on that account omit a duty ? He had not taken up politics as a trade . He had sat far behind the Treasury bench or below the gangway for many a year , without owing any man a shilling , - and could afford to do so again . But it was different with Phineas Finn , as Mr. Monk himself understood ; - and , understanding this , he felt himself bound to caution his young friend . But it may be a question whether his cautions did not do more harm than good . "
238207	238211	238202	238202	I	0	" he said , "
238238	238239	238231	238231	I	0	" "

238367	238368	238381	238394	the man who has half learned how to have a ship built without waste	6053	" "
238375	238376	238381	238394	the man who has half learned how to have a ship built without waste	6053	" "
238453	238454	238476	238477	no man	7759	" "
238457	238461	238476	238477	no man	7759	" said Phineas , "
238484	238485	238476	238477	no man	7759	" "
238571	238572	238579	238580	the people	731	" "
238592	238604	238587	238587	you	6049	" Mr. Monk paused a moment or two before he replied . "
238684	238685	238665	238665	I	0	" "
238696	238700	238665	238665	I	0	" said Phineas . "
238703	238708	238709	238709	we	6064	" said Mr. Monk , "
238715	239353	238709	238709	we	6064	" And thus , in the month of May , it was settled between them that , as soon as the session should be over , and the incidental work of his office should allow Phineas to pack up and be off , they two should start together for Ireland . Phineas felt rather proud as he wrote to his father and asked permission to bring home with him a Cabinet Minister as a visitor . At this time the reputation of Phineas at Killaloe , as well in the minds of the Killaloeians generally as in those of the inhabitants of the paternal house , stood very high indeed . How could a father think that a son had done badly when before he was thirty years of age he was earning L2,000 a year ? And how could a father not think well of a son who had absolutely paid back certain moneys into the paternal coffers ? The moneys so repaid had not been much ; but the repayment of any such money at Killaloe had been regarded as little short of miraculous . The news of Mr. Monk 's coming flew about the town , about the county , about the diocese , and all people began to say all good things about the old doctor 's only son . Mrs. Finn had long since been quite sure that a real black swan had been sent forth out of her nest . And the sisters Finn , for some time past , had felt in all social gatherings they stood quite on a different footing than formerly because of their brother . They were asked about in the county , and two of them had been staying only last Easter with the Molonys , - the Molonys of Poldoodie ! How should a father and a mother and sisters not be grateful to such a son , to such a brother , to such a veritable black swan out of the nest ! And as for dear little Mary Flood Jones , her eyes became suffused with tears as in her solitude she thought how much out of her reach this swan was flying . And yet she took joy in his swanhood , and swore that she would love him still ; - that she would love him always . Might he bring home with him to Killaloe , Mr. Monk , the Cabinet Minister ! Of course he might . When Mrs. Finn first heard of this august arrival , she felt as though she would like to expend herself in entertaining , though but an hour , the whole cabinet . Phineas , during the spring , had , of course , met Mr. Kennedy frequently in and about the House , and had become aware that Lady Laura 's husband , from time to time , made little overtures of civility to him , - taking him now and again by the button - hole , walking home with him as far as their joint paths allowed , and asking him once or twice to come and dine in Grosvenor Place . These little advances towards a repetition of the old friendship Phineas would have avoided altogether , had it been possible . The invitation to Mr. Kennedy 's house he did refuse , feeling himself positively bound to do so by Lady Laura 's command , let the consequences be what they might . When he did refuse , Mr. Kennedy would assume a look of displeasure and leave him , and Phineas would hope that the work was done . Then there would come another encounter , and the invitation would be repeated . At last , about the middle of May , there came another note . "
239390	239451	239387	239388	Robert Kennedy	343	" He had no alternative . He must refuse , even though double the notice had been given . He could only think that Mr. Kennedy was a very obtuse man and one who would not take a hint , and hope that he might succeed at last . So he wrote an answer , not intended to be conciliatory . "
239475	239594	239472	239473	Phineas Finn	329	" At this period he did his best to keep out of Mr. Kennedy 's way , and would be very cunning in his manoeuvres that they should not be alone together . It was difficult , as they sat on the same bench in the House , and consequently saw each other almost every day of their lives . Nevertheless , he thought that with a little cunning he might prevail , especially as he was not unwilling to give so much of offence as might assist his own object . But when Mr. Kennedy called upon him at his office the day after he had written the above note , he had no means of escape . "
239608	239634	239598	239598	you	0	" Mr. Kennedy said , as soon as he was seated . Phineas was taken so much by surprise that all his cunning failed him . "
239639	239643	239644	239644	I	0	" said he ; "
239654	239655	239644	239644	I	0	" "
239688	239689	239680	239680	I	0	" "
239694	239698	239680	239680	I	0	" said Phineas . "
239721	239925	239927	239928	my wife	8524	" Phineas felt that he was in a terrible difficulty , and he felt also that he was being rather ill - used in being thus cross - examined as to his reasons for not going to a gentleman 's dinner . He thought that a man ought to be allowed to choose where he would go and where he would not go , and that questions such as these were very uncommon . Mr. Kennedy was sitting opposite to him , looking more grave and more sour than usual ; - and now his own countenance also became a little solemn . It was impossible that he should use Lady Laura 's name , and yet he must , in some way , let his persecuting friend know that no further invitation would be of any use ; - that there was something beyond mere chance in his not going to Grosvenor Place . But how was he to do this ? The difficulty was so great that he could not see his way out of it . So he sat silent with a solemn face . Mr. Kennedy then asked him another question , which made the difficulty ten times greater . "
239938	239959	239927	239928	my wife	8524	" It was necessary now that he should make a rush and get out of his trouble in some way . "
239979	239980	239972	239972	she	8524	" "
239996	239997	239998	239998	She	8524	" "
240018	240019	240022	240022	she	8524	" "
240025	240026	240022	240022	she	8524	" "
240046	240047	240022	240022	she	8524	" "

240280	240501	240274	240274	I	0	" Upon that Mr. Kennedy formally shook hands with him , in token that there was no positive breach between them , - as two nations may still maintain their alliance , though they have made up their minds to hate each other , and thwart each other at every turn , - and took his leave . Phineas , as he sat at his window , looking out into the park , and thinking of what had passed , could not but reflect that , disagreeable as Mr. Kennedy had been to him , he would probably make himself much more disagreeable to his wife . And , for himself , he thought that he had got out of the scrape very well by the exhibition of a little mock anger . CHAPTER LIX The Earl 's Wrath The reader may remember that a rumour had been conveyed to Phineas , - a rumour indeed which reached him from a source which he regarded as very untrustworthy , - that Violet Effingham had quarrelled with her lover . He would probably have paid no attention to the rumour , beyond that which necessarily attached itself to any tidings as to a matter so full of interest to him , had it not been repeated to him in another quarter . "
240517	240526	240508	240510	your Violet Effingham	5755	" Madame Goesler said to him one day . "
240530	240534	240508	240510	your Violet Effingham	5755	" he asked . "
240617	240967	240603	240603	they	6088	" Phineas did not like to be told of their billing and cooing , - did not like to be told even of their quarrelling . Though they were to quarrel , it would do him no good . He would rather that nobody should mention their names to him ; - so that his back , which had been so utterly broken , might in process of time get itself cured . From what he knew of Violet he thought it very improbable that , even were she to quarrel with one lover , she would at once throw herself into the arms of another . And he did feel , too , that there would be some meanness in taking her , were she willing to be so taken . But , nevertheless , these rumours , coming to him in this way from different sources , almost made it incumbent on him to find out the truth . He began to think that his broken back was not cured ; - that perhaps , after all , it was not in the way of being cured , And was it not possible that there might be explanations ? Then he went to work and built castles in the air , so constructed as to admit of the possibility of Violet Effingham becoming his wife . This had been in April , and at that time all that he knew of Violet was , that she was not yet in London . And he thought that he knew the same as to Lord Chiltern . The Earl had told him that Chiltern was not in town , nor expected in town as yet ; and in saying so had seemed to express displeasure against his son . Phineas had met Lady Baldock at some house which he frequented , and had been quite surprised to find himself graciously received by the old woman . She had said not a word of Violet , but had spoken of Lord Chiltern , - mentioning his name in bitter wrath . "
240976	240982	240969	240969	he	6090	" said Phineas , smiling . "
241020	241435	241436	241437	Mr. Finn	329	" Phineas did not quite understand from this that Lady Baldock was signifying to him that , badly as she had thought of him as a suitor for her niece , she would have preferred him , - especially now when people were beginning to speak well of him , - to that terrible young man , who , from his youth upwards , had been to her a cause of fear and trembling . Of course it was desirable that Violet should marry an elder son , and a peer 's heir . All that kind of thing , in Lady Baldock 's eyes , was most desirable . But , nevertheless , anything was better than Lord Chiltern . If Violet would not take Mr. Appledom or Lord Fawn , in heaven 's name let her take this young man , who was kind , worthy , and steady , who was civilised in his manners , and would no doubt be amenable in regard to settlements . Lady Baldock had so far fallen in the world that she would have consented to make a bargain with her niece , - almost any bargain , so long as Lord Chiltern was excluded . Phineas did not quite understand all this ; but when Lady Baldock asked him to come to Berkeley Square , he perceived that help was being proffered to him where he certainly had not looked for help . He was frequently with Lord Brentford , who talked to him constantly on matters connected with his parliamentary life . After having been the intimate friend of the daughter and of the son , it now seemed to be his lot to be the intimate friend of the father . The Earl had constantly discussed with him his arrangements with his son , and had lately expressed himself as only half satisfied with such reconciliation as had taken place . And Phineas could perceive that from day to day the Earl was less and less satisfied . He would complain bitterly of his son , - complain of his silence , complain of his not coming to London , complain of his conduct to Violet , complain of his idle indifference to anything like proper occupation ; but he had never as yet said a word to show that there had been any quarrel between Violet and her lover , and Phineas had felt that he could not ask the question . "
241439	241456	241436	241437	Mr. Finn	329	" said the Earl to him one morning , as soon as he entered the room , "
241473	241491	241492	241493	Mr. Finn	329	" The nobleman 's manner was very stern , and the fact that he called his young friend "
241494	241504	241492	241493	Mr. Finn	329	" , showed at once that something was wrong . "
241515	241519	241508	241508	you	0	" said Phineas . "
241543	241642	241508	241508	you	0	" Now it must have been the case that , in the set among which they all lived , - Lord Brentford and his son and daughter and Phineas Finn , - the old lord was the only man who had not heard of the duel before this . It had even penetrated to the dull ears of Mr. Kennedy , reminding him , as it did so , that his wife had , - told him a lie ! But it was the fact that no rumour of the duel had reached the Earl till this morning . "
241647	241651	241508	241508	you	0	" said Phineas . "
241684	241697	241671	241671	you	6098	" The lord 's voice as he said this was very stern . "
241722	241723	241724	241724	I	0	" "
241766	241767	241753	241753	my	0	" "

241971	241993	241994	241994	his	463	" Phineas was aware that the Earl must have been very much moved indeed when he thus permitted himself to speak of "
241995	242019	242020	242020	I	0	" borough . He said nothing now , however , though the Earl paused ; - and then the angry lord went on . "
242038	242039	242020	242020	I	0	" "
242155	242156	242148	242148	he	7293	" "
242172	242173	242164	242164	he	7293	" "
242183	242184	242176	242176	he	7293	" "
242191	242213	242176	242176	he	7293	" Thus Phineas learned that Lord Chiltern was at this moment in the house , - or at least in London . "
242222	242223	242216	242216	he	7293	" "
242260	242328	242256	242256	you	8579	" The Earl was very angry , and was more angry from the fact that this young man who had offended him , to whom he had given such vital assistance when assistance was needed , had used that assistance to its utmost before his sin was found out . Had Phineas still been sitting for Loughton , so that the Earl could have said to him , "
242347	242478	242339	242339	you	8579	" I think that he would have forgiven the offender and allowed him to remain in his seat . There would have been a scene , and the Earl would have been pacified . But now the offender was beyond his reach altogether , having used the borough as a most convenient stepping - stone over his difficulties , and having so used it just at the time when he was committing this sin . There was a good fortune about Phineas which added greatly to the lord 's wrath . And then , to tell the truth , he had not that rich consolation for which Phineas gave him credit . Lord Chiltern had told him that morning that the engagement between him and Violet was at an end . "
242493	242502	242484	242484	her	6116	" the son had said to his father , "
242525	242559	242563	242563	you	6115	" But of this Phineas knew nothing as yet . The Earl , however , was so imprudent in his anger that before this interview was over he had told the whole story . "
242567	242571	242563	242563	you	6115	" he continued ; "
242580	242581	242563	242563	you	6115	" "
242733	242734	242726	242726	I	0	" "
242743	242751	242735	242735	I	0	" said the Earl in his despair . "

242790	242812	242778	242778	He	6119	" Then it was all true , even though the rumours had reached him through Laurence Fitzgibbon and Madame Max Goesler . "
242827	242916	242917	242918	My lord	7277	" he said , after a moment 's hesitation . The Earl was walking up and down the room , angry with himself at his own mistake in having told the story , and not knowing what further to say to his visitor . He had been in the habit of talking so freely to Phineas about his son that he could hardly resist the temptation of doing so still ; and yet it was impossible that he could swallow his anger and continue in the same strain . "
242920	242928	242917	242918	My lord	7277	" said Phineas , after a while , "
242995	243009	242986	242986	you	7277	" He was about to leave the room when the Earl stopped him . "
243017	243022	243011	243011	you	7277	" said the Earl , "
243033	243071	243075	243076	Mr. Finn	329	" Phineas stood silent , considering how he might answer this proposal , resolving that nothing should bring him to such a pledge as that suggested while there was yet a ledge for hope to stand on . "
243084	243085	243086	243086	I	0	" "
243099	243100	243075	243076	Mr. Finn	329	" "
243104	243109	243075	243076	Mr. Finn	329	" repeated the Earl , "
243116	243117	243075	243076	Mr. Finn	329	" "
243129	243133	243126	243127	my lord	7277	" said Phineas . "
243147	243148	243139	243140	Miss Effingham	351	" "
243156	243157	243150	243150	you	7277	" "
243315	243331	243308	243308	I	0	" The Earl stood opposite to him , scowling at him , but said nothing . "
243338	243339	243308	243308	I	0	" "
243345	243346	243343	243343	sir	8579	" "
243364	243365	243369	243369	sir	8579	" "
243371	243602	243369	243369	sir	8579	" And the Earl as he spoke rang the bell . Then Phineas took up his hat and departed . As he walked away his mind filled itself gradually with various ideas , all springing from the words which Lord Brentford had spoken . What account had Lord Chiltern given to his father of the duel ? Our hero was a man very sensitive as to the good opinion of others , and in spite of his bold assertion of his own knowledge of what became a gentleman , was beyond measure solicitous that others should acknowledge his claim at any rate to that title . He thought that he had been generous to Lord Chiltern ; and as he went back in his memory over almost every word that had been spoken in the interview that had just passed , he fancied that he was able to collect evidence that his antagonist at Blankenberg had not spoken ill of him . As to the charge of deceit which the Earl had made against him , he told himself that the Earl had made it in anger . He would not even think hardly of the Earl who had been so good a friend to him , but he believed in his heart that the Earl had made the accusation out of his wrath and not out of his judgment . "
243615	244109	243608	243608	I	0	" Phineas said to himself . But it was very sad to him that he should have to quarrel with all the family of the Standishes , as he could not but feel that it was they who had put him on his feet . It seemed as though he were never to see Lady Laura again except when they chanced to meet in company , - on which occasions he simply bowed to her . Now the Earl had almost turned him out of his house . And though there had been to a certain extent a reconciliation between him and Lord Chiltern , he in these days never saw the friend who had once put him upon Bonebreaker ; and now , - now that Violet Effingham was again free , - how was it possible to avoid some renewal of enmity between them ? He would , however , endeavour to see Lord Chiltern at once . And then he thought of Violet , - of Violet again free , of Violet as again a possible wife for himself , of Violet to whom he might address himself at any rate without any scruple as to his own unworthiness . Everybody concerned , and many who were not concerned at all , were aware that he had been among her lovers , and he thought that he could perceive that those who interested themselves on the subject , had regarded him as the only horse in the race likely to run with success against Lord Chiltern . She herself had received his offers without scorn , and had always treated him as though he were a favoured friend , though not favoured as a lover . And now even Lady Baldock was smiling upon him , and asking him to her house as though the red - faced porter in the hall in Berkeley Square had never been ordered to refuse him a moment 's admission inside the doors . He had been very humble in speaking of his own hopes to the Earl , but surely there might be a chance . What if after all the little strain which he had had in his back was to be cured after such a fashion as this ! When he got to his lodgings , he found a card from Lady Baldock , informing him that Lady Baldock would be at home on a certain night , and that there would be music . He could not go to Lady Baldock 's on the night named , as it would be necessary that he should be in the House ; - nor did he much care to go there , as Violet Effingham was not in town . But he would call and explain , and endeavour to curry favour in that way . He at once wrote a note to Lord Chiltern , which he addressed to Portman Square . "
244134	244658	244659	244659	I	0	" That was the note . After a few days he received the following answer , dated from the Bull at Willingford . Why on earth should Chiltern be staying at the Bull at Willingford in May ? The old Shop at W - - , Friday . DEAR PHINEAS , I ca n't dine with you , because I am down here , looking after the cripples , and writing a sporting novel . They tell me I ought to do something , so I am going to do that . I hope you do n't think I turned informer against you in telling the Earl of our pleasant little meeting on the sands . It had become necessary , and you are too much of a man to care much for any truth being told . He was terribly angry both with me and with you ; but the fact is , he is so blindly unreasonable that one can not regard his anger . I endeavoured to tell the story truly , and , so told , it certainly should not have injured you in his estimation . But it did . Very sorry , old fellow , and I hope you 'll get over it . It is a good deal more important to me than to you . Yours , C. There was not a word about Violet . But then it was hardly to be expected that there should be words about Violet . It was not likely that a man should write to his rival of his own failure . But yet there was a flavour of Violet in the letter which would not have been there , so Phineas thought , if the writer had been despondent . The pleasant little meeting on the sands had been convened altogether in respect of Violet . And the telling of the story to the Earl must have arisen from discussions about Violet . Lord Chiltern must have told his father that Phineas was his rival . Could the rejected suitor have written on such a subject in such a strain to such a correspondent if he had believed his own rejection to be certain ? But then Lord Chiltern was not like anybody else in the world , and it was impossible to judge of him by one 's experience of the motives of others . Shortly afterwards Phineas did call in Berkeley Square , and was shown up at once into Lady Baldock 's drawing - room . The whole aspect of the porter 's countenance was changed towards him , and from this , too , he gathered good auguries This had surprised him ; but his surprise was far greater , when , on entering the room , he found Violet Effingham there alone . A little fresh colour came to her face as she greeted him , though it can not be said that she blushed . She behaved herself admirably , not endeavouring to conceal some little emotion at thus meeting him , but betraying none that was injurious to her composure . "
244670	244674	244667	244668	Mr. Finn	329	" she said . "
244688	244815	244675	244676	My aunt	1575	" He was by no means her equal in his management of himself on the occasion ; but perhaps it may be acknowledged that his position was the more difficult of the two . He had not seen her since her engagement had been proclaimed to the world , and now he had heard from a source which was not to be doubted , that it had been broken off . Of course there was nothing to be said on that matter . He could not have congratulated her in the one case , nor could he either congratulate her or condole with her on the other . And yet he did not know how to speak to her as though no such events had occurred . "
244826	244830	244816	244816	I	0	" he said . "
244890	244891	244881	244881	you	6144	" "
244898	244899	244881	244881	you	6144	" "
244934	244966	244967	244968	A man	749	" Was it some such teaching as this that had jarred against Lord Chiltern 's susceptibilities , and had seemed to him to be a repetition of his father 's sermons ? "
244975	244979	244967	244968	A man	749	" said Phineas . "
245012	245013	245009	245010	Lady Laura	396	" "
245017	245018	245009	245010	Lady Laura	396	" "
245023	245024	245020	245021	Mr. Kennedy	343	" "
245033	245058	245028	245028	him	343	" The visit to the Colonial Office of which the reader has been made aware had not at that time as yet been made . "
245066	245079	245080	245080	I	0	" she said . Upon which Phineas smiled and shook his head . "
245094	245095	245080	245080	I	0	" "
245101	245102	245103	245103	I	0	" "
245135	245136	245137	245137	He	343	" "
245152	245183	245187	245187	he	343	" said Phineas , feeling that he was dishonest to Mr. Kennedy in saying so , but thinking that such dishonesty was justified by what he owed to Lady Laura . "
245217	245234	245210	245210	you	6144	" This she asked as though such a question had no reference whatever to Lord Chiltern . "
245243	245244	245210	245210	you	6144	" "
245253	245254	245255	245255	He	343	" "
245282	245283	245278	245278	I	0	" "
245293	245294	245290	245291	Mr. Finn	329	" "

245349	245356	245340	245340	I	0	" Then she rang the bell . "
245366	245370	245358	245358	I	0	" said he ; "
245379	245380	245377	245377	yourself	0	" "
245424	245425	245407	245407	We	6161	" "
245433	245437	245427	245427	your	6144	" he said , "
245446	245503	245427	245427	your	6144	" At that moment , luckily , Lady Baldock came into the room , and Phineas was saved from the necessity of making a declaration at a moment which would have been most inopportune . Lady Baldock was exceedingly gracious to him , bidding Violet use her influence to persuade him to come to the gathering . "
245517	245522	245427	245427	your	6144	" said Miss Effingham . "
245565	245566	245567	245568	Herr Moll	681	" "
245572	245577	245567	245568	Herr Moll	681	" said Lady Baldock , "
245610	245617	245605	245605	Pjinskt	683	" Phineas never had heard Pjinskt . "
245637	246508	245605	245605	Pjinskt	683	" Lady Baldock had taken up music this season , but all her enthusiasm was unable to shake the conscientious zeal of the young Under - Secretary of State . At such a gathering he would have been unable to say a word in private to Violet Effingham . CHAPTER LX Madame Goesler 's Politics It may be remembered that when Lady Glencora Palliser was shown into Madame Goesler 's room , Madame Goesler had just explained somewhat forcibly to the Duke of Omnium her reasons for refusing the loan of his Grace 's villa at Como . She had told the Duke in so many words that she did not mean to give the world an opportunity of maligning her , and it would then have been left to the Duke to decide whether any other arrangements might have been made for taking Madame Goesler to Como , had he not been interrupted . That he was very anxious to take her was certain . The green brougham had already been often enough at the door in Park Lane to make his Grace feel that Madame Goesler 's company was very desirable , - was , perhaps , of all things left for his enjoyment , the one thing the most desirable . Lady Glencora had spoken to her husband of children crying for the top brick of the chimney . Now it had come to this , that in the eyes of the Duke of Omnium Marie Max Goesler was the top brick of the chimney . She had more wit for him than other women , - more of that sort of wit which he was capable of enjoying . She had a beauty which he had learned to think more alluring than other beauty . He was sick of fair faces , and fat arms , and free necks . Madame Goesler 's eyes sparkled as other eyes did not sparkle , and there was something of the vagueness of mystery in the very blackness and gloss and abundance of her hair , - as though her beauty was the beauty of some world which he had not yet known . And there was a quickness and yet a grace of motion about her which was quite new to him . The ladies upon whom the Duke had of late most often smiled had been somewhat slow , - perhaps almost heavy , - though , no doubt , graceful withal . In his early youth he remembered to have seen , somewhere in Greece , such a houri as was this Madame Goesler . The houri in that case had run off with the captain of a Russian vessel engaged in the tallow trade ; but not the less was there left on his Grace 's mind some dreamy memory of charms which had impressed him very strongly when he was simply a young Mr. Palliser , and had had at his command not so convenient a mode of sudden abduction as the Russian captain 's tallow ship . Pressed hard by such circumstances as these , there is no knowing how the Duke might have got out of his difficulties had not Lady Glencora appeared upon the scene . Since the future little Lord Silverbridge had been born , the Duke had been very constant in his worship of Lady Glencora , and as , from year to year , a little brother was added , thus making the family very strong and stable , his acts of worship had increased ; but with his worship there had come of late something almost of dread , - something almost of obedience , which had made those who were immediately about the Duke declare that his Grace was a good deal changed . For , hitherto , whatever may have been the Duke 's weaknesses , he certainly had known no master . His heir , Plantagenet Palliser , had been always subject to him . His other relations had been kept at such a distance as hardly to be more than recognised ; and though his Grace no doubt had had his intimacies , they who had been intimate with him had either never tried to obtain ascendancy , or had failed . Lady Glencora , whether with or without a struggle , had succeeded , and people about the Duke said that the Duke was much changed . Mr. Fothergill , - who was his Grace 's man of business , and who was not a favourite with Lady Glencora , - said that he was very much changed indeed . Finding his Grace so much changed , Mr. Fothergill had made a little attempt at dictation himself , but had receded with fingers very much scorched in the attempt . It was indeed possible that the Duke was becoming in the slightest degree weary of Lady Glencora 's thraldom , and that he thought that Madame Max Goesler might be more tender with him . Madame Max Goesler , however , intended to be tender only on one condition . When Lady Glencora entered the room , Madame Goesler received her beautifully . "
246523	246527	246528	246528	I	0	" she said . "
246542	246547	246538	246538	I	0	" said Lady Glencora . "
246555	246562	246538	246538	I	0	" said Madame Goesler , smiling . "
246618	246645	246646	246646	Dou	686	" Planty was the little Lord Silverbridge as was to be , if nothing unfortunate intervened , who was now sitting on his granduncle 's knee . "
246656	246661	246646	246646	Dou	686	" said the boy . "
246671	246672	246646	246646	Dou	686	" "
246689	246747	246646	246646	Dou	686	" said Madame Goesler . Lady Glencora had not cared much for evidence to convince Madame Goesler , but she had not wished her uncle to think that he was watched and hunted down . It might be necessary that he should know that he was watched , but things had not come to that as yet . "
246752	246757	246760	246760	papa	7260	" asked the Duke . "
246762	246770	246760	246760	papa	7260	" said Lady Glencora to her child . "
246783	246784	246785	246785	He	376	" "
246792	246797	246785	246785	He	376	" said the Duke . "
246822	246823	246798	246799	Your papa	6179	" "
246831	246832	246833	246833	He	7260	" "
246894	246895	246891	246891	he	7260	" "
246900	246905	246891	246891	he	7260	" said Lady Glencora . "
246911	246916	246891	246891	he	7260	" said Madame Goesler . "
246932	246940	246930	246930	mamma	1709	" said the little future Lord Silverbridge . "
246948	248662	248663	248663	You	6191	" said his grand - uncle , kissing him . At this moment Lady Glencora was , no doubt , thinking how necessary it was that she should be careful to see that things did turn out in the manner proposed , - so that people who had waited should not be disappointed ; and the Duke was perhaps thinking that he was not absolutely bound to his nephew by any law of God or man ; and Madame Max Goesler , - I wonder whether her thoughts were injurious to the prospects of that handsome bold - faced little boy . Lady Glencora rose to take her leave first . It was not for her to show any anxiety to force the Duke out of the lady 's presence . If the Duke were resolved to make a fool of himself , nothing that she could do would prevent it . But she thought that this little inspection might possibly be of service , and that her uncle 's ardour would be cooled by the interruption to which he had been subjected . So she went , and immediately afterwards the Duke followed her . The interruption had , at any rate , saved him on that occasion from making the highest bid for the pleasure of Madame Goesler 's company at Como . The Duke went down with the little boy in his hand , so that there was not an opportunity for a single word of interest between the gentleman and the lady . Madame Goesler , when she was alone , seated herself on her sofa , tucking her feet up under her as though she were seated somewhere in the East , pushed her ringlets back roughly from her face , and then placed her two hands to her sides so that her thumbs rested lightly on her girdle . When alone with something weighty on her mind she would sit in this form for the hour together , resolving , or trying to resolve , what should be her conduct . She did few things without much thinking , and though she walked very boldly , she walked warily . She often told herself that such success as she had achieved could not have been achieved without much caution . And yet she was ever discontented with herself , telling herself that all that she had done was nothing , or worse than nothing . What was it all , to have a duke and to have lords dining with her , to dine with lords or with a duke itself , if life were dull with her , and the hours hung heavy ! Life with her was dull , and the hours did hang heavy . And what if she caught this old man , and became herself a duchess , - caught him by means of his weakness , to the inexpressible dismay of all those who were bound to him by ties of blood , - would that make her life happier , or her hours less tedious ? That prospect of a life on the Italian lakes with an old man tied to her side was not so charming in her eyes as it was in those of the Duke . Were she to succeed , and to be blazoned forth to the world as Duchess of Omnium , what would she have gained ? She perfectly understood the motive of Lady Glencora 's visit , and thought that she would at any rate gain something in the very triumph of baffling the manoeuvres of so clever a woman . Let Lady Glencora throw her aegis before the Duke , and it would be something to carry off his Grace from beneath the protection of so thick a shield . The very flavour of the contest was pleasing to Madame Goesler . But , the victory gained , what then would remain to her ? Money she had already ; position , too , she had of her own . She was free as air , and should it suit her at any time to go off to some lake of Como in society that would personally be more agreeable to her than that of the Duke of Omnium , there was nothing to hinder her for a moment . And then came a smile over her face , - but the saddest smile , - as she thought of one with whom it might be pleasant to look at the colour of Italian skies and feel the softness of Italian breezes . In feigning to like to do this with an old man , in acting the raptures of love on behalf of a worn - out duke who at the best would scarce believe in her acting , there would not be much delight for her . She had never yet known what it was to have anything of the pleasure of love . She had grown , as she often told herself , to be a hard , cautious , selfish , successful woman , without any interference or assistance from such pleasure . Might there not be yet time left for her to try it without selfishness , - with an absolute devotion of self , - if only she could find the right companion ? There was one who might be such a companion , but the Duke of Omnium certainly could not be such a one . But to be Duchess of Omnium ! After all , success in this world is everything ; - is at any rate the only thing the pleasure of which will endure . There was the name of many a woman written in a black list within Madame Goesler 's breast , - written there because of scorn , because of rejected overtures , because of deep social injury ; and Madame Goesler told herself often that it would be a pleasure to her to use the list , and to be revenged on those who had ill - used and scornfully treated her . She did not readily forgive those who had injured her . As Duchess of Omnium she thought that probably she might use that list with efficacy . Lady Glencora had treated her well , and she had no such feeling against Lady Glencora . As Duchess of Omnium she would accept Lady Glencora as her dearest friend , if Lady Glencora would admit it . But if it should be necessary that there should be a little duel between them , as to which of them should take the Duke in hand , the duel must of course be fought . In a matter so important , one woman would of course expect no false sentiment from another . She and Lady Glencora would understand each other ; - and no doubt , respect each other . I have said that she would sit there resolving , or trying to resolve . There is nothing in the world so difficult as that task of making up one 's mind . Who is there that has not longed that the power and privilege of selection among alternatives should be taken away from him in some important crisis of his life , and that his conduct should be arranged for him , either this way or that , by some divine power if it were possible , - by some patriarchal power in the absence of divinity , - or by chance even , if nothing better than chance could be found to do it ? But no one dares to cast the die , and to go honestly by the hazard . There must be the actual necessity of obeying the die , before even the die can be of any use . As it was , when Madame Goesler had sat there for an hour , till her legs were tired beneath her , she had not resolved . It must be as her impulse should direct her when the important moment came . There was not a soul on earth to whom she could go for counsel , and when she asked herself for counsel , the counsel would not come . Two days afterwards the Duke called again . He would come generally on a Thursday , - early , so that he might be there before other visitors ; and he had already quite learned that when he was there other visitors would probably be refused admittance . How Lady Glencora had made her way in , telling the servant that her uncle was there , he had not understood . That visit had been made on the Thursday , but now he came on the Saturday , - having , I regret to say , sent down some early fruit from his own hot - houses , - or from Covent Garden , - with a little note on the previous day . The grapes might have been pretty well , but the note was injudicious . There were three lines about the grapes , as to which there was some special history , the vine having been brought from the garden of some villa in which some ill - used queen had lived and died ; and then there was a postscript in one line to say that the Duke would call on the following morning . I do not think that he had meant to add this when he began his note ; but then children , who want the top brick , want it so badly , and cry for it so perversely ! Of course Madame Goesler was at home . But even then she had not made up her mind . She had made up her mind only to this , - that he should be made to speak plainly , and that she would take time for her reply . Not even with such a gem as the Duke 's coronet before her eyes , would she jump at it . Where there was so much doubt , there need at least be no impatience . "
248684	248690	248680	248682	that little boy	6192	" she said , laughing . "
248705	248709	248691	248691	He	6192	" he answered . "
248742	248743	248744	248744	She	10011	" "
248755	248760	248744	248744	She	10011	" said the Duke . "
248775	248821	248744	248744	She	10011	" Madame Goesler was playing with a bunch of his grapes now , eating one or two from a small china plate which had stood upon the table , and he thought that he had never seen a woman so graceful and yet so natural . "
248845	248871	248875	248875	Duke	353	" He shook his head , knowing that it did not suit his gastric juices to have to deal with fruit eaten at odd times . "
248909	248910	248911	248911	I	0	" "
248915	248920	248911	248911	I	0	" said the Duke . "
248991	248992	248988	248988	I	0	" "

249040	249132	249134	249134	you	6200	" The Duke sat for a while silent , taking his repose as far as the outer man was concerned , looking at his top brick of the chimney , as from time to time she ate one of his grapes . Probably she did not eat above half - a - dozen of them altogether , but he thought that the grapes must have been made for the woman , she was so pretty in the eating of them . But it was necessary that he should speak at last . "
249142	249146	249134	249134	you	6200	" he said . "
249155	249156	249134	249134	you	6200	" "

249179	249206	249170	249170	I	0	" Then she put down the grapes , and moved herself on her chair , so that she sat with her face turned away from him . "
249218	249219	249170	249170	I	0	" "
249282	249283	249284	249284	I	0	" "
249289	249300	249284	249284	I	0	" the Duke began , and then he stopped himself . "
249310	249311	249306	249306	you	0	" "
249326	249327	249312	249312	Marie	658	" "
249362	249403	249404	249404	Marie	658	" She had turned round upon him now , and was leaning forward towards him from her chair , so that he could touch her if he put out his hand . He put out his hand and touched her . "
249406	249410	249412	249412	you	658	" he said , "
249419	249420	249412	249412	you	658	" "

249514	249527	249483	249493	a woman worse than I am at the reading of riddles	6209	" Now he touched her again , and had taken her hand . "
249557	249569	249570	249570	Marie	658	" Then the Duke rose and made his proposition in form . "
249599	249600	249594	249594	I	0	" "

249668	249701	249660	249660	I	0	" Then she went away from him , and seated herself at a distance . After a moment or two he followed her , and stood with his arm upon her shoulder . "
249711	249712	249709	249709	Marie	658	" "
249724	249725	249713	249713	You	0	" "

249825	249990	249814	249814	I	0	" Then he came to her , took her hand , kissed her brow , and opened the door for her . CHAPTER LXI Another Duel It happened that there were at this time certain matters of business to be settled between the Duke of Omnium and his nephew Mr. Palliser , respecting which the latter called upon his uncle on the morning after the Duke had committed himself by his offer . Mr. Palliser had come by appointment made with Mr. Fothergill , the Duke 's man of business , and had expected to meet Mr. Fothergill . Mr. Fothergill , however , was not with the Duke , and the uncle told the nephew that the business had been postponed . Then Mr. Palliser asked some question as to the reason of such postponement , not meaning much by his question , - and the Duke , after a moment 's hesitation , answered him , meaning very much by his answer .

250025	250031	249995	249995	Plantagenet	402	" asked the astonished nephew . "

250104	250109	250102	250102	Duke	353	" said Plantagenet Palliser . "

250172	250201	250202	250202	He	353	" So much passed between the uncle and the nephew , and what the uncle told to the nephew , the nephew of course told to his wife . "
250210	250215	250202	250202	He	353	" said Lady Glencora , "
250237	250238	250223	250223	he	353	" "
250253	250258	250247	250247	he	353	" said Plantagenet Palliser . "

250354	250415	250348	250348	I	0	" Then Lady Glencora left her husband , and did not consult him afterwards as to the course she would pursue . He had his budget to manage , and his speeches to make . The little affair of the Duke and Madame Goesler , she thought it best to take into her own hands without any assistance from him . "
250422	250428	250417	250418	a fool	8087	" she said to herself , "
250441	250881	250417	250418	a fool	8087	" Madame Goesler , when she was left alone , felt that now indeed she must make up her mind . She had asked for two days . The intervening day was a Sunday , and on the Monday she must send her answer . She might doubt at any rate for this one night , - the Saturday night , - and sit playing , as it were , with the coronet of a duchess in her lap . She had been born the daughter of a small country attorney , and now a duke had asked her to be his wife , - and a duke who was acknowledged to stand above other dukes ! Nothing at any rate could rob her of that satisfaction . Whatever resolution she might form at last , she had by her own resources reached a point of success in remembering which there would always be a keen gratification . It would be much to be Duchess of Omnium ; but it would be something also to have refused to be a Duchess of Omnium . During that evening , that night , and the next morning , she remained playing with the coronet in her lap . She would not go to church . What good could any sermon do her while that bauble was dangling before her eyes ? After church - time , about two o'clock , Phineas Finn came to her . Just at this period Phineas would come to her often ; - sometimes full of a new decision to forget Violet Effingham altogether , at others minded to continue his siege let the hope of success be ever so small . He had now heard that Violet and Lord Chiltern had in truth quarrelled , and was of course anxious to be advised to continue the siege . When he first came in and spoke a word or two , in which there was no reference to Violet Effingham , there came upon Madame Goesler a strong wish to decide at once that she would play no longer with the coronet , that the gem was not worth the cost she would be called upon to pay for it . There was something in the world better for her than the coronet , - if only it might be had . But within ten minutes he had told her the whole tale about Lord Chiltern , and how he had seen Violet at Lady Baldock 's , - and how there might yet be hope for him . What would she advise him to do ? "
250888	250892	250885	250886	Mr. Finn	329	" she said , "
250909	250910	250885	250886	Mr. Finn	329	" "
250936	250937	250928	250928	I	0	" "
250961	250962	250964	250964	they	6230	" "

251049	251292	251039	251039	I	0	" Then Madame Goesler almost made up her mind that she would have the coronet . There was a substance about the coronet that would not elude her grasp . Late that afternoon , while she was still hesitating , there came another caller to the cottage in Park Lane . She was still hesitating , feeling that she had as yet another night before her . Should she be Duchess of Omnium or not ? All that she wished to be , she could not be ; - but to be Duchess of Omnium was within her reach . Then she began to ask herself various questions . Would the Queen refuse to accept her in her new rank ? Refuse ! How could any Queen refuse to accept her ? She had not done aught amiss in life . There was no slur on her name ; no stain on her character . What though her father had been a small attorney , and her first husband a Jew banker ! She had broken no law of God or man , had been accused of breaking no law , which breaking or which accusation need stand in the way of her being as good a duchess as any other woman ! She was sitting thinking of this , almost angry with herself at the awe with which the proposed rank inspired her , when Lady Glencora was announced to her . "
251296	251301	251293	251294	Madame Goesler	348	" said Lady Glencora , "
251310	251311	251308	251308	you	348	" "
251323	251334	251313	251313	I	0	" said Madame Goesler , smiling with all her grace . "

251418	251522	251523	251523	I	0	" said Madame Goesler . Then there was a pause for some moments which Madame Goesler was determined that she would not break . It was clear to her now on what ground Lady Glencora had come to her , and she was fully minded that if she could bear the full light of the god himself in all his glory , she would not allow herself to be scorched by any reflected heat coming from the god 's niece . She thought she could endure anything that Lady Glencora might say ; but she would wait and hear what might be said . "
251541	251568	251530	251530	I	0	" said Lady Glencora , almost hesitating as she spoke , and feeling that the colour was rushing up to her cheeks and covering her brow . "

252456	252481	252451	252451	your	475	" As she said this , there came a smile over her face , which threatened to break from control and almost become laughter . "
252568	252810	252564	252564	You	475	" After a while Lady Glencora did leave her , - to settle the matter within her own bosom , - having no other alternative . CHAPTER LXII The Letter That Was Sent to Brighton Monday morning came and Madame Goesler had as yet written no answer to the Duke of Omnium . Had not Lady Glencora gone to Park Lane on the Sunday afternoon , I think the letter would have been written on that day ; but , whatever may have been the effect of Lady Glencora 's visit , it so far disturbed Madame Goesler as to keep her from her writing - table . There was yet another night for thought , and then the letter should be written on the Monday morning . When Lady Glencora left Madame Goesler she went at once to the Duke 's house . It was her custom to see her husband 's uncle on a Sunday , and she would most frequently find him just at this hour , - before he went up - stairs to dress for dinner . She usually took her boy with her , but on this occasion she went alone . She had tried what she could do with Madame Goesler , and she found that she had failed . She must now make her attempt upon the Duke . But the Duke , perhaps anticipating some attack of the kind , had fled . "
252818	252826	252816	252816	Barker	689	" said Lady Glencora to the porter . "
252846	253235	252844	252844	Lapoule	690	" Lapoule was the Duke 's French valet . Lady Glencora could only return home and consider in her own mind what batteries might yet be brought to bear upon the Duke , towards stopping the marriage , even after the engagement should have been made , - if it were to be made . Lady Glencora felt that such batteries might still be brought up as would not improbably have an effect on a proud , weak old man . If all other resources failed , royalty in some of its branches might be induced to make a request , and every august relation in the peerage should interfere . The Duke no doubt might persevere and marry whom he pleased , - if he were strong enough . But it requires much personal strength , - that standing alone against the well - armed batteries of all one 's friends . Lady Glencora had once tried such a battle on her own behalf , and had failed . She had wished to be imprudent when she was young ; but her friends had been too strong for her . She had been reduced , and kept in order , and made to run in a groove , - and was now , when she sat looking at her little boy with his bold face , almost inclined to think that the world was right , and that grooves were best . But if she had been controlled when she was young , so ought the Duke to be controlled now that he was old . It is all very well for a man or woman to boast that he , - or she , - may do what he likes with his own , - or with her own . But there are circumstances in which such self - action is ruinous to so many that coercion from the outside becomes absolutely needed . Nobody had felt the injustice of such coercion when applied to herself more sharply than had Lady Glencora . But she had lived to acknowledge that such coercion might be proper , and was now prepared to use it in any shape in which it might be made available . It was all very well for Madame Goesler to laugh and exclaim , "
253238	253867	252844	252844	Lapoule	690	" when Lady Glencora declared her real trouble . But should it ever come to pass that a black - browed baby with a yellow skin should be shown to the world as Lord Silverbridge , Lady Glencora knew that her peace of mind would be gone for ever . She had begun the world desiring one thing , and had missed it . She had suffered much , and had then reconciled herself to other hopes . If those other hopes were also to be cut away from her , the world would not be worth a pinch of snuff to her . The Duke had fled , and she could do nothing to - day ; but to - morrow she would begin with her batteries . And she herself had done the mischief ! She had invited this woman down to Matching ! Heaven and earth ! - that such a man as the Duke should be such a fool ! - The widow of a Jew banker ! He , the Duke of Omnium , - and thus to cut away from himself , for the rest of his life , all honour , all peace of mind , all the grace of a noble end to a career which , if not very noble in itself , had received the praise of nobility ! And to do this for a thin , black - browed , yellow - visaged woman with ringlets and devil 's eyes , and a beard on her upper lip , - a Jewess , - a creature of whose habits of life and manners of thought they all were absolutely ignorant ; who drank , possibly ; who might have been a forger , for what any one knew ; an adventuress who had found her way into society by her art and perseverance , - and who did not even pretend to have a relation in the world ! That such a one should have influence enough to intrude herself into the house of Omnium , and blot the scutcheon , and , - what was worst of all , - perhaps be the mother of future dukes ! Lady Glencora , in her anger , was very unjust to Madame Goesler , thinking all evil of her , accusing her in her mind of every crime , denying her all charm , all beauty . Had the Duke forgotten himself and his position for the sake of some fair girl with a pink complexion and grey eyes , and smooth hair , and a father , Lady Glencora thought that she would have forgiven it better . It might be that Madame Goesler would win her way to the coronet ; but when she came to put it on , she should find that there were sharp thorns inside the lining of it . Not a woman worth the knowing in all London should speak to her ; - nor a man either of those men with whom a Duchess of Omnium would wish to hold converse . She should find her husband rated as a doting fool , and herself rated as a scheming female adventuress . And it should go hard with Lady Glencora , if the Duke were not separated from his new Duchess before the end of the first year ! In her anger Lady Glencora was very unjust . The Duke , when he left his house without telling his household whither he was going , did send his address to , - the top brick of the chimney . His note , which was delivered at Madame Goesler 's house late on the Sunday evening , was as follows : - "
253918	254010	254012	254012	he	0	" Poor old man ! He had run through all the pleasures of life too quickly , and had not much left with which to amuse himself . At length he had set his eyes on a top brick , and being tired of everything else , wanted it very sorely . Poor old man ! How should it do him any good , even if he got it ? Madame Goesler , when she received the note , sat with it in her hand , thinking of his great want . "
254024	254126	254012	254012	he	0	" she said to herself . But she had given herself to the next morning , and she would not make up her mind that night . She would sleep once more with the coronet of a duchess within her reach . She did do so ; and woke in the morning with her mind absolutely in doubt . When she walked down to breakfast , all doubt was at an end . The time had come when it was necessary that she should resolve , and while her maid was brushing her hair for her she did make her resolution . "
254138	254162	254012	254012	he	0	" said the maid , who may probably have reflected that the Duke of Omnium did not come here so often for nothing . "
254172	254173	254165	254165	you	6277	" "
254219	254220	254210	254211	a lady	9734	" "
254238	254239	254242	254242	madame	6279	" "
254250	254251	254242	254242	madame	6279	" "
254266	255260	254264	254264	me	0	" Then Madame Goesler had made up her mind ; but I do not know whether that doubt as to having her own way had much to do with it . As the wife of an old man she would probably have had much of her own way . Immediately after breakfast she wrote her answer to the Duke , which was as follows : - Park Lane , Monday . MY DEAR DUKE OF OMNIUM , I find so great a difficulty in expressing myself to your Grace in a written letter , that since you left me I have never ceased to wish that I had been less nervous , less doubting , and less foolish when you were present with me here in my room . I might then have said in one word what will take so many awkward words to explain . Great as is the honour you propose to confer on me , rich as is the gift you offer me , I can not accept it . I can not be your Grace 's wife . I may almost say that I knew it was so when you parted from me ; but the surprise of the situation took away from me a part of my judgment , and made me unable to answer you as I should have done . My lord , the truth is , that I am not fit to be the wife of the Duke of Omnium . I should injure you ; and though I should raise myself in name , I should injure myself in character . But you must not think , because I say this , that there is any reason why I should not be an honest man 's wife . There is none . I have nothing on my conscience which I could not tell you , - or to another man ; nothing that I need fear to tell to all the world . Indeed , my lord , there is nothing to tell but this , - that I am not fitted by birth and position to be the wife of the Duke of Omnium . You would have to blush for me , and that no man shall ever have to do on my account . I will own that I have been ambitious , too ambitious , and have been pleased to think that one so exalted as you are , one whose high position is so rife in the eyes of all men , should have taken pleasure in my company . I will confess to a foolish woman 's silly vanity in having wished to be known to be the friend of the Duke of Omnium . I am like the other moths that flutter near the light and have their wings burned . But I am wiser than they in this , that having been scorched , I know that I must keep my distance . You will easily believe that a woman , such as I am , does not refuse to ride in a carriage with your Grace 's arms on the panels without a regret . I am no philosopher . I do not pretend to despise the rich things of the world , or the high things . According to my way of thinking a woman ought to wish to be Duchess of Omnium ; - but she ought to wish also to be able to carry her coronet with a proper grace . As Madame Goesler I can live , even among my superiors , at my ease . As your Grace 's wife , I should be easy no longer ; - nor would your Grace . You will think perhaps that what I write is heartless , that I speak altogether of your rank , and not at all of the affection you have shown me , or of that which I might possibly bear towards you . I think that when the first flush of passion is over in early youth men and women should strive to regulate their love , as they do their other desires , by their reason . I could love your Grace , fondly , as your wife , if I thought it well for your Grace or for myself that we should be man and wife . As I think it would be ill for both of us , I will restrain that feeling , and remember your Grace ever with the purest feeling of true friendship . Before I close this letter , I must utter a word of gratitude . In the kind of life which I have led as a widow , a life which has been very isolated as regards true fellowship , it has been my greatest effort to obtain the good opinion of those among whom I have attempted to make my way . I may , perhaps , own to you now that I have had many difficulties . A woman who is alone in the world is ever regarded with suspicion . In this country a woman with a foreign name , with means derived from foreign sources , with a foreign history , is specially suspected . I have striven to live that down , and I have succeeded . But in my wildest dreams I never dreamed of such success as this , - that the Duke of Omnium should think me the worthiest of the worthy . You may be sure that I am not ungrateful , - that I never will be ungrateful . And I trust it will not derogate from your opinion of my worth , that I have known what was due to your Grace 's highness . I have the honour to be , My Lord Duke , Your most obliged and faithful servant , MARIE MAX GOESLER . "
255274	256650	256651	256651	You	6290	" she said to herself , as she folded the paper , and put it into an envelope , and sealed the cover . The moment that the letter was completed she sent it off , as she was directed to send it , so that there might be no possibility of repentance and subsequent hesitation . She had at last made up her mind , and she would stand by the making . She knew that there would come moments in which she would deeply regret the opportunity that she had lost , - the chance of greatness that she had flung away from her . But so would she have often regretted it , also , had she accepted the greatness . Her position was one in which there must be regret , let her decision have been what it might . But she had decided , and the thing was done . She would still be free , - Marie Max Goesler , - unless in abandoning her freedom she would obtain something that she might in truth prefer to it . When the letter was gone she sat disconsolate , at the window of an up - stairs room in which she had written , thinking much of the coronet , much of the name , much of the rank , much of that position in society which she had flattered herself she might have won for herself as Duchess of Omnium by her beauty , her grace , and her wit . It had not been simply her ambition to be a duchess , without further aim or object . She had fancied that she might have been such a duchess as there is never another , so that her fame might have been great throughout Europe , as a woman charming at all points . And she would have had friends , then , - real friends , and would not have lived alone as it was now her fate to do . And she would have loved her ducal husband , old though he was , and stiff with pomp and ceremony . She would have loved him , and done her best to add something of brightness to his life . It was indeed true that there was one whom she loved better ; but of what avail was it to love a man who , when he came to her , would speak to her of nothing but of the charms which he found in another woman ! She had been sitting thus at her window , with a book in her hand , at which she never looked , gazing over the park which was now beautiful with its May verdure , when on a sudden a thought struck her . Lady Glencora Palliser had come to her , trying to enlist her sympathy for the little heir , behaving , indeed , not very well , as Madame Goesler had thought , but still with an earnest purpose which was in itself good . She would write to Lady Glencora and put her out of her misery . Perhaps there was some feeling of triumph in her mind as she returned to the desk from which her epistle had been sent to the Duke ; - not of that triumph which would have found its gratification in boasting of the offer that had been made to her , but arising from a feeling that she could now show the proud mother of the bold - faced boy that though she would not pledge herself to any woman as to what she might do or not do , she was nevertheless capable of resisting such a temptation as would have been irresistible to many . Of the Duke 's offer to her she would have spoken to no human being , had not this woman shown that the Duke 's purpose was known at least to her , and now , in her letter , she would write no plain word of that offer . She would not state , in words intelligible to any one who might read , that the Duke had offered her his hand and his coronet . But she would write so that Lady Glencora should understand her . And she would be careful that there should be no word in the letter to make Lady Glencora think that she supposed herself to be unfit for the rank offered to her . She had been very humble in what she had written to the Duke , but she would not be at all humble in what she was about to write to the mother of the bold - faced boy . And this was the letter when it was written : - MY DEAR LADY GLENCORA , I venture to send you a line to put you out of your misery ; - for you were very miserable when you were so good as to come here yesterday . Your dear little boy is safe from me ; - and , what is more to the purpose , so are you and your husband , - and your uncle , whom , in truth , I love . You asked me a downright question which I did not then choose to answer by a downright answer . The downright answer was not at that time due to you . It has since been given , and as I like you too well to wish you to be in torment , I send you a line to say that I shall never be in the way of you or your boy . And now , dear Lady Glencora , one word more . Should it ever again appear to you to be necessary to use your zeal for the protection of your husband or your child , do not endeavour to dissuade a woman by trying to make her think that she , by her alliance , would bring degradation into any house , or to any man . If there could have been an argument powerful with me , to make me do that which you wished to prevent , it was the argument which you used . But my own comfort , and the happiness of another person whom I value almost as much as myself , were too important to be sacrificed even to a woman 's revenge . I take mine by writing to you and telling you that I am better and more rational and wiser than you took me to be . If , after this , you choose to be on good terms with me , I shall be happy to be your friend . I shall want no further revenge . You owe me some little apology ; but whether you make it or not , I will be contented , and will never do more than ask whether your darling 's prospects are still safe . There are more women than one in the world , you know , and you must not consider yourself to be out of the wood because you have escaped from a single danger . If there arise another , come to me , and we will consult together . Dear Lady Glencora , yours always sincerely , MARIE M. G. There was a thing or two besides which she longed to say , laughing as she thought of them . But she refrained , and her letter , when finished , was as it is given above . On the day following , Lady Glencora was again in Park Lane . When she first read Madame Goesler 's letter , she felt herself to be annoyed and angry , but her anger was with herself rather than with her correspondent . Ever since her last interview with the woman whom she had feared , she had been conscious of having been indiscreet . All her feelings had been too violent , and it might well have been that she should have driven this woman to do the very thing that she was so anxious to avoid . "
256658	256911	256651	256651	You	6290	" Madame Goesler had said . It was true , - and she would apologise . Undue pride was not a part of Lady Glencora 's character . Indeed , there was not enough of pride in her composition . She had been quite ready to hate this woman , and to fight her on every point as long as the danger existed ; but she was equally willing to take the woman to her heart now that the danger was over . Apologise ! Of course she would apologise . And she would make a friend of the woman if the woman wished it . But she would not have the woman and the Duke at Matching together again , lest , after all , there might be a mistake . She did not show Madame Goesler 's letter to her husband , or tell him anything of the relief she had received . He had cared but little for the danger , thinking more of his budget than of the danger ; and would be sufficiently at his ease if he heard no more rumours of his uncle 's marriage . Lady Glencora went to Park Lane early on the Tuesday morning , but she did not take her boy with her . She understood that Madame Goesler might perhaps indulge in a little gentle raillery at the child 's expense , and the mother felt that this might be borne the more easily if the child were not present . "
256925	256935	256922	256923	Madame Goesler	348	" said Lady Glencora , before she sat down . "
256957	256976	256922	256923	Madame Goesler	348	" said Madame Goesler , standing up from her chair and laughing , as she sang the lines . "

257639	258059	258062	258062	heiresses	6318	" They parted the best of friends , but Lady Glencora was still of opinion that if the lady and the Duke were to be brought together at Matching , or elsewhere , there might still be danger . CHAPTER LXIII Showing How the Duke Stood His Ground Mr. Low the barrister , who had given so many lectures to our friend Phineas Finn , lectures that ought to have been useful , was now himself in the House of Commons , having reached it in the legitimate course of his profession . At a certain point of his career , supposing his career to have been sufficiently prosperous , it becomes natural to a barrister to stand for some constituency , and natural for him also to form his politics at that period of his life with a view to his further advancement , looking , as he does so , carefully at the age and standing of the various candidates for high legal office . When a man has worked as Mr. Low had worked , he begins to regard the bench wistfully , and to calculate the profits of a two years ' run in the Attorney - Generalship . It is the way of the profession , and thus a proper and sufficient number of real barristers finds its way into the House . Mr. Low had been angry with Phineas because he , being a barrister , had climbed into it after another fashion , having taken up politics , not in the proper way as an assistance to his great profession , but as a profession in itself . Mr. Low had been quite sure that his pupil had been wrong in this , and that the error would at last show itself , to his pupil 's cost . And Mrs. Low had been more sure than Mr. Low , having not unnaturally been jealous that a young whipper - snapper of a pupil , - as she had once called Phineas , - should become a Parliament man before her husband , who had worked his way up gallantly , in the usual course . She would not give way a jot even now , - not even when she heard that Phineas was going to marry this and that heiress . For at this period of his life such rumours were afloat about him , originating probably in his hopes as to Violet Effingham and his intimacy with Madame Goesler . "
258064	258069	258062	258062	heiresses	6318	" said Mrs. Low . "
258148	258425	258426	258426	I	0	" At this time Phineas had become somewhat of a fine gentleman , which made Mrs. Low the more angry with him . He showed himself willing enough to go to Mrs. Low 's house , but when there he seemed to her to give himself airs . I think that she was unjust to him , and that it was natural that he should not bear himself beneath her remarks exactly as he had done when he was nobody . He had certainly been very successful . He was always listened to in the House , and rarely spoke except on subjects which belonged to him , or had been allotted to him as part of his business . He lived quite at his ease with people of the highest rank , - and those of his own mode of life who disliked him did so simply because they regarded with envy his too rapid rise . He rode upon a pretty horse in the park , and was careful in his dress , and had about him an air of comfortable wealth which Mrs. Low thought he had not earned . When her husband told her of his sufficient salary , she would shake her head and express her opinion that a good time was coming . By which she perhaps meant to imply a belief that a time was coming in which her husband would have a salary much better than that now enjoyed by Phineas , and much more likely to be permanent . The Radicals were not to have office for ever , and when they were gone , what then ? "
258435	258440	258430	258430	he	6325	" said Mrs. Low . "
258489	258521	258430	258430	he	6325	" Mrs. Low was fond of an assured prosperity , of money in the funds , and was proud to think that her husband lived in a house of his own . "
258540	258549	258537	258538	Mr. Bunce	425	" she once said to that gallant Radical , "
258605	258625	258584	258584	he	399	" Mr. Bunce and Mrs. Low , though they differed much in politics , sympathised in reference to Phineas . "
258642	258647	258633	258633	nobody	1350	" said Mr. Bunce . "
258715	259048	258711	258711	he	8910	" Whence Mr. Bunce had got his notions as to the way in which officials at Whitehall pass their time , I can not say ; but his notions are very common notions . The British world at large is slow to believe that the great British housekeeper keeps no more cats than what kill mice . Mr. Low , who was now frequently in the habit of seeing Phineas at the House , had somewhat changed his opinions , and was not so eager in condemning Phineas as was his wife . He had begun to think that perhaps Phineas had shown some knowledge of his own aptitudes in the career which he had sought , and was aware , at any rate , that his late pupil was somebody in the House of Commons . A man will almost always respect him whom those around him respect , and will generally look up to one who is evidently above himself in his own daily avocation . Now Phineas was certainly above Mr. Low in parliamentary reputation . He sat on a front bench . He knew the leaders of parties . He was at home amidst the forms of the House . He enjoyed something of the prestige of Government power . And he walked about familiarly with the sons of dukes and the brothers of earls in a manner which had its effect even on Mr. Low . Seeing these things Mr. Low could not maintain his old opinion as stoutly as did his wife . It was almost a privilege to Mr. Low to be intimate with Phineas Finn . How then could he look down upon him ? He was surprised , therefore , one day when Phineas discussed the matter with him fully . Phineas had asked him what would be his chance of success if even now he were to give up politics and take to the Bar as the means of earning his livelihood . "

259810	260234	259797	259797	she	8754	" After that Mr. Low began to think that his wife 's judgment in this matter had been better than his own . Robson could do as he liked because he had married a woman with money . Phineas told himself that that game was also open to him . He , too , might marry money . Violet Effingham had money ; - quite enough to make him independent were he married to her . And Madame Goesler had money ; - plenty of money . And an idea had begun to creep upon him that Madame Goesler would take him were he to offer himself . But he would sooner go back to the Bar as the lowest pupil , sooner clean boots for barristers , - so he told himself , - than marry a woman simply because she had money , than marry any other woman as long as there was a chance that Violet might be won . But it was very desirable that he should know whether Violet might be won or not . It was now July , and everybody would be gone in another month . Before August would be over he was to start for Ireland with Mr. Monk , and he knew that words would be spoken in Ireland which might make it indispensable for him to be , at any rate , able to throw up his office . In these days he became more anxious than he used to be about Miss Effingham 's fortune . He had never spoken as yet to Lord Brentford since the day on which the Earl had quarrelled with him , nor had he ever been at the house in Portman Square . Lady Laura he met occasionally , and had always spoken to her . She was gracious to him , but there had been no renewal of their intimacy . Rumours had reached him that things were going badly with her and her husband ; but when men repeated such rumours in his presence , he said little or nothing on the subject . It was not for him , at any rate , to speak of Lady Laura 's unhappiness . Lord Chiltern he had seen once or twice during the last month , and they had met cordially as friends . Of course he could ask no question from Lord Chiltern as to Violet ; but he did learn that his friend had again patched up some reconciliation with his father . "
260244	260248	260235	260235	He	6377	" said Phineas . "
260271	260272	260264	260264	I	0	" "
260300	260301	260294	260294	he	6377	" "

260333	260337	260318	260318	One	1102	" said Phineas . "
260388	260389	260385	260385	Laura	396	" "
260399	260405	260385	260385	Laura	396	" said Phineas , bitterly . "
260469	261799	261860	261860	she	6382	" This was all very well as coming from Lord Chiltern ; but there was no word about Violet , and Phineas did not know how to get a word from any one . Lady Laura could have told him everything , but he could not go to Lady Laura . He did go to Lady Baldock 's house as often as he thought he could with propriety , and occasionally he saw Violet . But he could do no more than see her , and the days and weeks were passing by , and the time was coming in which he would have to go away , and be with her no more . The end of the season , which was always to other men , - to other working men such as our hero , - a period of pleasurable anticipation , to him was a time of sadness , in which he felt that he was not exactly like to , or even equal to , the men with whom he lived in London . In the old days , in which he was allowed to go to Loughlinter or to Saulsby , when all men and women were going to their Loughlinters and their Saulsbys , it was very well with him ; but there was something melancholy to him in his yearly journey to Ireland . He loved his father and mother and sisters as well as do other men ; but there was a falling off in the manner of his life which made him feel that he had been in some sort out of his own element in London . He would have liked to have shot grouse at Loughlinter , or pheasants at Saulsby , or to have hunted down at Willingford , - or better still , to have made love to Violet Effingham wherever Violet Effingham might have placed herself . But all this was closed to him now ; and there would be nothing for him but to remain at Killaloe , or to return to his work in Downing Street , from August to February . Mr. Monk , indeed , was going with him for a few weeks ; but even this association did not make up for that sort of society which he would have preferred . The session went on very quietly . The question of the Irish Reform Bill was postponed till the next year , which was a great thing gained . He carried his bill about the Canada Railway , with sundry other small bills appertaining to it , through the House in a manner which redounded infinitely to his credit . There was just enough of opposition to give a zest to the work , and to make the affair conspicuous among the affairs of the year . As his chief was in the other house , the work fell altogether into his hands , so that he came to be conspicuous among Under - Secretaries . It was only when he said a word to any leaders of his party about other matters , - about Irish Tenant - right , for instance , which was beginning to loom very large , that he found himself to be snubbed . But there was no room for action this year in reference to Irish Tenant - right , and therefore any deep consideration of that discomfort might be legitimately postponed . If he did by chance open his mouth on the subject to Mr. Monk , even Mr. Monk discouraged him . In the early days of July , when the weather was very hot , and people were beginning to complain of the Thames , and members were becoming thirsty after grouse , and the remaining days of parliamentary work were being counted up , there came to him news , - news that was soon known throughout the fashionable world , - that the Duke of Omnium was going to give a garden party at a certain villa residence on the banks of the Thames above Richmond . It was to be such a garden party as had never been seen before . And it would be the more remarkable because the Duke had never been known to do such a thing . The villa was called The Horns , and had , indeed , been given by the Duke to Lady Glencora on her marriage ; but the party was to be the Duke 's party , and The Horns , with all its gardens , conservatories , lawns , shrubberies , paddocks , boat - houses , and boats , was to be made bright and beautiful for the occasion . Scores of workmen were about the place through the three first weeks of July . The world at large did not at all know why the Duke was doing so unwonted a thing , - why he should undertake so new a trouble . But Lady Glencora knew , and Madame Goesler shrewdly guessed , the riddle . When Madame Goesler 's unexpected refusal had reached his Grace , he felt that he must either accept the lady 's refusal , or persevere . After a day 's consideration , he resolved that he would accept it . The top brick of the chimney was very desirable ; but perhaps it might be well that he should endeavour to live without it . Then , accepting this refusal , he must either stand his ground and bear the blow , - or he must run away to that villa at Como , or elsewhere . The running away seemed to him at first to be the better , or at least the more pleasant , course ; but at last he determined that he would stand his ground and bear the blow . Therefore he gave his garden party at The Horns . Who was to be invited ? Before the first week in July was over , many a bosom in London was fluttering with anxiety on that subject . The Duke , in giving his short word of instruction to Lady Glencora , made her understand that he would wish her to be particular in her invitations . Her Royal Highness the Princess , and his Royal Highness the Prince , had both been so gracious as to say that they would honour his fete . The Duke himself had made out a short list , with not more than a dozen names . Lady Glencora was employed to select the real crowd , - the five hundred out of the ten thousand who were to be blessed . On the Duke 's own private list was the name of Madame Goesler . Lady Glencora understood it all . When Madame Goesler got her card , she thought that she understood it too . And she thought also that the Duke was behaving in a gallant way . There was , no doubt , much difficulty about the invitations , and a considerable amount of ill - will was created . And they who considered themselves entitled to be asked , and were not asked , were full of wrath against their more fortunate friends , instead of being angry with the Duke or with Lady Glencora , who had neglected them . It was soon known that Lady Glencora was the real dispenser of the favours , and I fancy that her ladyship was tired of her task before it was completed . The party was to take place on Wednesday , the 27th of July , and before the day had come , men and women had become so hardy in the combat that personal applications were made with unflinching importunity ; and letters were written to Lady Glencora putting forward this claim and that claim with a piteous clamour . "
261807	261851	261860	261860	she	6382	" Lady Glencora said to her particular friend , Mrs. Grey , when a letter came from Mrs. Bonteen , stating all that her husband had ever done towards supporting Mr. Palliser in Parliament , - and all that he ever would do . "
261871	261901	261860	261860	she	6382	" Mrs. Bonteen did not get a card ; and when she heard that Phineas Finn had received one , her wrath against Phineas was very great . He was "
261906	262112	261902	261904	an Irish adventurer	6383	" and she regretted deeply that Mr. Bonteen had ever interested himself in bringing such an upstart forward in the world of politics . But as Mr. Bonteen never had done anything towards bringing Phineas forward , there was not much cause for regret on this head . Phineas , however , got his card , and , of course , accepted the invitation . The grounds were opened at four . There was to be an early dinner out in tents at five ; and after dinner men and women were to walk about , or dance , or make love - or hay , as suited them . The haycocks , however , were ready prepared , while it was expected that they should bring the love with them . Phineas , knowing that he should meet Violet Effingham , took a great deal with him ready made . For an hour and a half Lady Glencora kept her position in a saloon through which the guests passed to the grounds , and to every comer she imparted the information that the Duke was on the lawn ; - to every comer but one . To Madame Goesler she said no such word . "
262122	262134	261902	261904	an Irish adventurer	6383	" she said , as she pressed her friend 's hand : "
262156	262210	262144	262144	I	0	" Then Madame Goesler passed on , and soon found herself amidst a throng of acquaintance . After a few minutes she saw the Duke seated in an arm - chair , close to the river - bank , and she bravely went up to him , and thanked him for the invitation . "
262222	262739	262144	262144	I	0	" said the Duke , rising to greet her . There were a dozen people standing round , and so the thing was done without difficulty . At that moment there came a notice that their royal highnesses were on the ground , and the Duke , of course , went off to meet them . There was not a word more spoken between the Duke and Madame Goesler on that afternoon . Phineas did not come till late , - till seven , when the banquet was over . I think he was right in this , as the banqueting in tents loses in comfort almost more than it gains in romance . A small picnic may be very well , and the distance previously travelled may give to a dinner on the ground the seeming excuse of necessity . Frail human nature must be supported , - and human nature , having gone so far in pursuit of the beautiful , is entitled to what best support the unaccustomed circumstances will allow . Therefore , out with the cold pies , out with the salads , and the chickens , and the champagne . Since no better may be , let us recruit human nature sitting upon this moss , and forget our discomforts in the glory of the verdure around us . And dear Mary , seeing that the cushion from the waggonet is small , and not wishing to accept the too generous offer that she should take it all for her own use , will admit a contact somewhat closer than the ordinary chairs of a dining - room render necessary . That in its way is very well ; - but I hold that a banquet on narrow tables in a tent is displeasing . Phineas strolled into the grounds when the tent was nearly empty , and when Lady Glencora , almost sinking beneath her exertions , was taking rest in an inner room . The Duke at this time was dining with their royal highnesses , and three or four others , specially selected , very comfortably within doors . Out of doors the world had begun to dance , - and the world was beginning to say that it would be much nicer to go and dance upon the boards inside as soon as possible . For , though of all parties a garden party is the nicest , everybody is always anxious to get out of the garden as quick as may be . A few ardent lovers of suburban picturesque effect were sitting beneath the haycocks , and four forlorn damsels were vainly endeavouring to excite the sympathy of manly youth by playing croquet in a corner . I am not sure , however , that the lovers beneath the haycocks and the players at croquet were not actors hired by Lady Glencora for the occasion . Phineas had not been long on the lawn before he saw Lady Laura Kennedy . She was standing with another lady , and Barrington Erle was with them . "
262746	262753	262741	262741	you	6387	" said Barrington , greeting him . "
262758	262759	262741	262741	you	6387	" "
262819	262847	262848	262849	Mr. Finn	329	" Lady Laura shook hands with Phineas , and then as he was passing on , followed him for a step and whispered a word to him . "
262851	262855	262848	262849	Mr. Finn	329	" she said , "
262895	263057	262877	262877	I	0	" Phineas said that he would , and then went on , not knowing exactly where he was going . He had one desire , - to find Violet Effingham , but when he should find her he could not carry her off , and sit with her beneath a haycock . CHAPTER LXIV The Horns While looking for Violet Effingham , Phineas encountered Madame Goesler , among a crowd of people who were watching the adventurous embarkation of certain daring spirits in a pleasure - boat . There were watermen there in the Duke 's livery , ready to take such spirits down to Richmond or up to Teddington lock , and many daring spirits did take such trips , - to the great peril of muslins , ribbons , and starch , to the peril also of ornamental summer white garments , so that when the thing was over , the boats were voted to have been a bore . "
263064	263071	263059	263059	you	6390	" said Phineas to the lady . "
263092	263093	263089	263089	you	6390	" "
263140	263156	263130	263130	I	0	" Thus Phineas excused himself , being still intent on prosecuting his search for Violet . "
263162	263167	263160	263160	I	0	" said Madame Goesler . "

She had herself told him that she was to accompany Lady Laura , whom he had already met . Lady Baldock had not been invited , and had expressed great animosity against the Duke in consequence . She had gone so far as to say that the Duke was a man at whose house a young lady such as her niece ought not to be seen . But Violet had laughed at this , and declared her intention of accepting the invitation . "

And now he must keep his appointment with Lady Laura Kennedy . So he went down to the path by the river , and there he found her seated close by the water 's edge . Her cousin Barrington Erle was still with her , but as soon as Phineas joined them , Erle went away . "

265981	266060	266069	266069	his	892	" But why did she come to him with this story , - to him whom she had been accused of entertaining as a lover ; - to him who of all her friends was the last whom she should have chosen as the recipient for such a tale ? Phineas as he thought how he might best answer her , with what words he might try to comfort her , could not but ask himself this question . "
266072	266079	266080	266080	I	0	" she went on to say , "
266118	266119	266106	266106	I	0	" "

266209	266733	266205	266205	you	892	" They were now standing close upon the river 's bank , at a corner of the grounds , and , though the voices of people sounded near to them , they were alone . Phineas had no alternative but to read the letter , which was as follows : - After what you have said to me it is impossible that I should return to your house . I shall meet my father at the Duke of Omnium 's , and have already asked him to give me an asylum . It is my wish to remain wherever he may be , either in town or in the country . Should I change my purpose in this , and change my residence , I will not fail to let you know where I go and what I propose to do . You I think must have forgotten that I was your wife ; but I will never forget it . You have accused me of having a lover . You can not have expected that I should continue to live with you after such an accusation . For myself I can not understand how any man can have brought himself to bring such a charge against his wife . Even had it been true the accusation should not have been made by your mouth to my ears . That it is untrue I believe you must be as well aware as I am myself . How intimate I was with . Mr. Finn , and what were the limits of my intimacy with him you knew before I married you . After our marriage I encouraged his friendship till I found that there was something in it that displeased you , - and , after learning that , I discouraged it . You have said that he is my lover , but you have probably not defined for yourself that word very clearly . You have felt yourself slighted because his name has been mentioned with praise ; - and your jealousy has been wounded because you have thought that I have regarded him as in some way superior to yourself . You have never really thought that he was my lover , - that he spoke words to me which others might not hear , that he claimed from me aught that a wife may not give , that he received aught which a friend should not receive . The accusation has been a coward 's accusation . I shall be at my father 's to - night , and to - morrow I will get you to let my servant bring to me such things as are my own , - my clothes , namely , and desk , and a few books . She will know what I want . I trust you may be happier without a wife , than ever you have been with me . I have felt almost daily since we were married that you were a man who would have been happier without a wife than with one . Yours affectionately , LAURA KENNEDY . "
266741	266752	266205	266205	you	892	" she said , when Phineas had read the letter . "
266760	266764	266771	266771	he	6490	" said Phineas , "
266803	266804	266816	266816	your	6492	" "
266930	267440	266925	266925	I	0	" Then he was left standing by himself , looking down upon the river as it glided by . How would it have been with both of them if Lady Laura had accepted him three years ago , when she consented to join her lot with that of Mr. Kennedy , and had rejected him ? As he stood he heard the sound of music from the house , and remembered that he had come there with the one sole object of seeing Violet Effingham . He had known that he would meet Lady Laura , and it had been in his mind to break through that law of silence which she had imposed upon him , and once more to ask her to assist him , - to implore her for the sake of their old friendship to tell him whether there might yet be for him any chance of success . But in the interview which had just taken place it had been impossible for him to speak a word of himself or of Violet . To her , in her great desolation , he could address himself on no other subject than that of her own misery . But not the less when she was talking to him of her own sorrow , of her regret that she had not listened to him when in years past he had spoken slightingly of Mr. Kennedy , was he thinking of Violet Effingham . Mr. Kennedy had certainly mistaken the signs of things when he had accused his wife by saying that Phineas was her lover . Phineas had soon got over that early feeling ; and as far as he himself was concerned had never regretted Lady Laura 's marriage . He remained down by the water for a few minutes , giving Lady Laura time to escape , and then he wandered across the grounds towards the house . It was now about nine o'clock , and though there were still many walking about the grounds , the crowd of people were in the rooms . The musicians were ranged out on a verandah , so that their music might have been available for dancing within or without ; but the dancers had found the boards pleasanter than the lawn , and the Duke 's garden party was becoming a mere ball , with privilege for the dancers to stroll about the lawn between the dances . And in this respect the fun was better than at a ball , - that let the engagements made for partners be what they might , they could always be broken with ease . No lady felt herself bound to dance with a cavalier who was displeasing to her ; and some gentlemen were left sadly in the lurch . Phineas felt himself to be very much in the lurch , even after he had discovered Violet Effingham standing up to dance with Lord Fawn . He bided his time patiently , and at last he found his opportunity . "
267447	267476	267442	267442	she	6497	" She declared that she intended to dance no more , and that she had promised to be ready to return home with Lord Brentford before ten o'clock . "
267487	267511	267477	267477	I	0	" she said , laughing . Then she put her hand upon his arm , and they stepped out upon the terrace together . "
267517	267527	267513	267513	you	6498	" she asked him , almost in a whisper . "
267530	267534	267513	267513	you	6498	" he said . "

267618	267619	267609	267609	she	6499	" "
267624	267645	267609	267609	she	6499	" said Phineas , feeling that the subject was one upon which it was not easy for him to speak . "
267657	267685	267652	267652	he	6498	" said Violet . Then Phineas began to understand that Violet had not heard the whole story ; but the difficulty of speaking was still very great . "
267695	267699	267652	267652	he	6498	" he said . "
267751	267752	267744	267744	She	6499	" "
267769	267773	267766	267766	she	6499	" said Phineas . "
267781	267786	267774	267774	She	6499	" repeated Violet , - "
267797	267798	267790	267790	you	1588	" "
267821	267822	267812	267812	one	1102	" "
267879	267936	267937	267937	I	0	" They were now at some distance from the house , and Phineas could not but feel that chance had been very good to him in giving him his opportunity . She was leaning on his arm , and they were alone , and she was speaking to him with all the familiarity of old friendship . "
267946	267950	267940	267940	I	0	" said he , "

268371	268429	268362	268363	Lord Brentford	332	" There was Lord Brentford with Lady Laura on his arm , very gloomy , - resolving on what way he might be avenged on the man who had insulted his daughter . He took but little notice of Phineas as he resumed his charge of Miss Effingham ; but the two ladies wished him good night . "
268436	268449	268433	268434	Lady Laura	344	" said Phineas , standing with his hat in his hand , - "
268456	268789	268453	268454	Miss Effingham	351	" Then he was alone , - quite alone . Would it not be well for him to go down to the bottom of the garden , and fling himself into the quiet river , so that there might be an end of him ? Or would it not be better still that he should create for himself some quiet river of life , away from London , away from politics , away from lords , and titled ladies , and fashionable squares , and the parties given by dukes , and the disappointments incident to a small man in attempting to make for himself a career among big men ? There had frequently been in the mind of this young man an idea that there was something almost false in his own position , - that his life was a pretence , and that he would ultimately be subject to that ruin which always comes , sooner or later , on things which are false ; and now as he wandered alone about Lady Glencora 's gardens , this feeling was very strong within his bosom , and robbed him altogether of the honour and glory of having been one of the Duke of Omnium 's guests . CHAPTER LXV The Cabinet Minister at Killaloe Phineas did not throw himself into the river from the Duke 's garden ; and was ready , in spite of Violet Effingham , to start for Ireland with Mr. Monk at the end of the first week in August . The close of that season in London certainly was not a happy period of his life . Violet had spoken to him after such a fashion that he could not bring himself not to believe her . She had given him no hint whether it was likely or unlikely that she and Lord Chiltern would be reconciled ; but she had convinced him that he could not be allowed to take Lord Chiltern 's place . "
268798	269020	268790	268791	A woman	1381	" she had said . Phineas was well aware that many women do transfer their hearts ; but he had gone to this woman too soon after the wrench which her love had received ; he had been too sudden with his proposal for a transfer ; and the punishment for such ill judgment must be that success would now be impossible to him . And yet how could he have waited , feeling that Miss Effingham , if she were at all like other girls whom he had known , might have promised herself to some other lover before she would return within his reach in the succeeding spring ? But she was not like some other girls . Ah ; - he knew that now , and repented him of his haste . But he was ready for Mr. Monk on the 7th of August , and they started together . Something less than twenty hours took them from London to Killaloe , and during four or five of those twenty hours Mr. Monk was unfitted for any conversation by the uncomfortable feelings incidental to the passage from Holyhead to Kingstown . Nevertheless , there was a great deal of conversation between them during the journey . Mr. Monk had almost made up his mind to leave the Cabinet . "

269856	269860	269882	269882	you	922	" he said , "

270023	270541	270542	270542	I	0	" It was a great day in Killaloe , that on which Mr. Monk arrived with Phineas at the doctor 's house . In London , perhaps , a bishop inspires more awe than a Cabinet Minister . In Killaloe , where a bishop might be seen walking about every day , the mitred dignitary of the Church , though much loved , was thought of , I fear , but lightly ; whereas a Cabinet Minister coming to stay in the house of a townsman was a thing to be wondered at , to be talked about , to be afraid of , to be a fruitful source of conversation for a year to come . There were many in Killaloe , especially among the elder ladies , who had shaken their heads and expressed the saddest doubts when young Phineas Finn had first become a Parliament man . And though by degrees they had been half brought round , having been driven to acknowledge that he had been wonderfully successful as a Parliament man , still they had continued to shake their heads among themselves , and to fear something in the future , - until he appeared at his old home leading a Cabinet Minister by the hand . There was such assurance in this that even old Mrs. Callaghan , at the brewery , gave way , and began to say all manner of good things , and to praise the doctor 's luck in that he had a son gifted with parts so excellent . There was a great desire to see the Cabinet Minister in the flesh , to be with him when he ate and drank , to watch the gait and countenance of the man , and to drink water from this fountain of state lore which had been so wonderfully brought among them by their young townsman . Mrs. Finn was aware that it behoved her to be chary of her invitations , but the lady from the brewery had said such good things of Mrs. Finn 's black swan , that she carried her point , and was invited to meet the Cabinet Minister at dinner on the day after his arrival . Mrs. Flood Jones and her daughter were invited also to be of the party . When Phineas had been last at Killaloe , Mrs. Flood Jones , as the reader may remember , had remained with her daughter at Floodborough , - feeling it to be her duty to keep her daughter away from the danger of an unrequited attachment . But it seemed that her purpose was changed now , or that she no longer feared the danger , - for both Mary and her mother were now again living in Killaloe , and Mary was at the doctor 's house as much as ever . A day or two before the coming of the god and the demigod to the little town , Barbara Finn and her friend had thus come to understand each other as they walked along the Shannon side . "
270556	270561	270542	270542	I	0	" said Barbara Finn . "
270570	270574	270563	270563	I	0	" said Mary , "

270844	270860	270861	270861	Mary	681	" Barbara Finn walked on for a couple of minutes in silence before she replied . "
270863	270869	270861	270861	Mary	681	" she said at last , "
270879	270880	270870	270870	I	0	" "
270916	271149	270905	270905	Mamma	639	" Nevertheless , they did talk about Phineas during the whole of that day , and very often talked about him afterwards , as long as Mary remained at Killaloe . There was a large dinner party at the doctor 's on the day after Mr. Monk 's arrival . The bishop was not there , though he was on terms sufficiently friendly with the doctor 's family to have been invited on so grand an occasion ; but he was not there , because Mrs. Finn was determined that she would be taken out to dinner by a Cabinet Minister in the face of all her friends . She was aware that had the bishop been there , she must have taken the bishop 's arm . And though there would have been glory in that , the other glory was more to her taste . It was the first time in her life that she had ever seen a Cabinet Minister , and I think that she was a little disappointed at finding him so like other middle - aged gentlemen . She had hoped that Mr. Monk would have assumed something of the dignity of his position ; but he assumed nothing . Now the bishop , though he was a very mild man , did assume something by the very facts of his apron and knee - breeches . "
271174	271263	271161	271161	you	8579	" said Mrs. Finn to her guest , as they sat down at table . And yet she had resolved that she would not make any speech of the kind , - that she would condescend to no apology , - that she would bear herself as though a Cabinet Minister dined with her at least once a year . But when the moment came , she broke down , and made this apology with almost abject meekness , and then hated herself because she had done so . "
271268	271273	271274	271274	I	0	" said Mr. Monk , "
271293	271341	271345	271345	madam	6595	" Then he felt that he had made a foolish speech , and he also hated himself . He found it very difficult to talk to his hostess upon any subject , until by chance he mentioned his young friend Phineas . Then her tongue was unloosed . "
271347	271351	271345	271345	madam	6595	" he said , "
271391	271392	271395	271396	Mr. Monk	346	" "
271422	271491	271492	271492	I	0	" Then the mother spoke out all her past fears and all her present hopes , and acknowledged the great glory which it was to her to have a son sitting in Parliament , holding an office with a stately name and a great salary , and blessed with the friendship of such a man as Mr. Monk . After that Mr. Monk got on better with her . "
271500	271504	271496	271498	any young man	4861	" said he , "
271516	271517	271518	271518	He	7293	" "
271523	271540	271518	271518	He	7293	" said Mrs. Finn , with a tear forcing itself into the corner of each eye . "
271570	271608	271567	271568	Mr. Monk	346	" And then the poor lady was obliged to raise her handkerchief and wipe away the drops . Phineas on this occasion had taken out to dinner the mother of his devoted Mary , Mrs. Flood Jones . "
271630	271636	271619	271620	Mrs. Finn	357	" said Mrs. Flood Jones . "
271643	271649	271619	271620	Mrs. Finn	357	" said he , laughing . "
271699	271700	271703	271703	I	0	" "
271726	271727	271715	271715	nobody	1350	" "

271766	271767	271750	271752	Mrs. Flood Jones	379	" "
271819	271820	271816	271816	you	346	" "
271825	271829	271816	271816	you	346	" said Phineas . "
271923	271988	271915	271915	we	6607	" Thus Mrs. Flood Jones signified to Phineas Finn that she had forgiven him the thoughtlessness of his early youth , - even though there had been something of treachery in that thoughtlessness to her own daughter ; and showed him , also , that whatever Mary 's feelings might have been once , they were not now of a nature to trouble her . "
271995	272001	271915	271915	we	6607	" said Mrs. Flood Jones . "
272009	272028	271915	271915	we	6607	" said Phineas , who perhaps looked farther into the mind of the lady than the lady intended . "
272033	272038	271915	271915	we	6607	" said the lady . "
272057	272166	272167	272167	I	0	" When the ladies met together in the drawing - room after dinner , it was impossible but that they should discuss Mr. Monk . There was Mrs. Callaghan from the brewery there , and old Lady Blood , of Bloodstone , - who on ordinary occasions would hardly admit that she was on dining - out terms with any one in Killaloe except the bishop , but who had found it impossible to decline to meet a Cabinet Minister , - and there was Mrs. Stackpoole from Sixmiletown , a far - away cousin of the Finns , who hated Lady Blood with a true provincial hatred . "
272180	272185	272186	272186	I	0	" said Lady Blood . "
272194	272200	272188	272188	he	6612	" said Mrs. Flood Jones . "
272214	272230	272188	272188	he	6612	" said Mrs. Callaghan , meaning to pronounce a strong eulogium on the Cabinet Minister . "
272237	272242	272188	272188	he	6612	" said Lady Blood . "
272252	272257	272249	272250	Lady Blood	700	" said Mrs. Stackpoole . "
272275	272327	272328	272328	My	0	" Now Lady Blood herself had been born and bred in Ennis , whereas Mrs. Stackpoole had come from Limerick , which is a much more considerable town , and therefore there was a satire in this allusion to the habits of the men of Ennis which Lady Blood understood thoroughly . "
272348	272382	272345	272345	you	702	" Lady Blood had once passed three months in London while Sir Patrick had been alive , whereas Mrs. Stackpoole had never done more than visit the metropolis for a day or two . "
272388	272393	272345	272345	you	702	" said Mrs. Stackpoole ; "
272430	272431	272432	272432	My	0	" "
272444	272449	272450	272450	I	0	" said Lady Blood . "
272456	272461	272450	272450	I	0	" said Mrs. Stackpoole . "
272472	272477	272462	272462	He	346	" said Mrs. Finn . "
272517	272518	272499	272499	I	0	" "
272523	272528	272499	272499	I	0	" said Mrs. Callaghan . "
272533	272538	272499	272499	I	0	" said Mrs. Stackpoole . "
272548	272553	272539	272539	I	0	" said Lady Blood . "
272595	272797	272583	272583	I	0	" Now it was well known that Mrs. Stackpoole had two sons living in Limerick , as to neither of whom was it expected that he would set the Shannon on fire . After this little speech there was no further mention of Mr. Monk , as it became necessary that all the good - nature of Mrs. Finn and all the tact of Mrs. Flood Jones and all the energy of Mrs. Callaghan should be used , to prevent the raging of an internecine battle between Mrs. Stackpoole and Lady Blood . CHAPTER LXVI Victrix Mr. Monk 's holiday programme allowed him a week at Killaloe , and from thence he was to go to Limerick , and from Limerick to Dublin , in order that , at both places , he might be entertained at a public dinner and make a speech about tenant - right . Foreseeing that Phineas might commit himself if he attended these meetings , Mr. Monk had counselled him to remain at Killaloe . But Phineas had refused to subject himself to such cautious abstinence . Mr. Monk had come to Ireland as his friend , and he would see him through his travels . "
272809	272813	272798	272798	I	0	" said Phineas , "
272838	272839	272833	272833	I	0	" "

272884	273468	273469	273469	Mary	382	" Mr. Monk said very much to him on the subject , - was constantly saying very much to him about it ; but in spite of all that Mr. Monk said , Phineas did make the journey to Limerick and Dublin . He had not , since his arrival at Killaloe , been a moment alone with Mary Flood Jones till the evening before he started with Mr. Monk . She had kept out of his way successfully , though she had constantly been with him in company , and was beginning to plume herself on the strength and valour of her conduct . But her self - praise had in it nothing of joy , and her glory was very sad . Of course she would care for him no more , - more especially as it was so very evident that he cared not at all for her . But the very fact of her keeping out of his way , made her acknowledge to herself that her position was very miserable . She had declared to her mother that she might certainly go to Killaloe with safety , - that it would be better for her to put herself in the way of meeting him as an old friend , - that the idea of the necessity of shutting herself up because of his approach , was the one thing that gave her real pain . Therefore her mother had brought her to Killaloe and she had met him ; but her fancied security had deserted her , and she found herself to be miserable , hoping for something she did not know what , still dreaming of possibilities , feeling during every moment of his presence with her that some special conduct was necessary on her part . She could not make further confession to her mother and ask to be carried back to Floodborough ; but she knew that she was very wretched at Killaloe . As for Phineas , he had felt that his old friend was very cold to him . He was in that humour with reference to Violet Effingham which seemed especially to require consolation . He knew now that all hope was over there . Violet Effingham could never be his wife . Even were she not to marry Lord Chiltern for the next five years , she would not , during those five years , marry any other man . Such was our hero 's conviction ; and , suffering under this conviction , he was in want of the comfort of feminine sympathy . Had Mary known all this , and had it suited her to play such a part , I think she might have had Phineas at her feet before he had been a week at home . But she had kept aloof from him and had heard nothing of his sorrows . As a natural consequence of this , Phineas was more in love with her than ever . On the evening before he started with Mr. Monk for Limerick , he managed to be alone with her for a few minutes . Barbara may probably have assisted in bringing about this arrangement , and had , perhaps , been guilty of some treachery , - sisters in such circumstances will sometimes be very treacherous to their friends . I feel sure , however , that Mary herself was quite innocent of any guile in the matter . "
273471	273478	273469	273469	Mary	382	" Phineas said to her suddenly , "
273497	273509	273484	273484	you	382	" She smiled and blushed , and stammered and said nothing . "
273520	273521	273518	273518	Mary	382	" "
273531	273535	273527	273527	I	0	" she said . "
273544	273545	273540	273542	such great friends	6631	" "

273632	273640	273625	273630	no one in the whole world	6635	" he said , after a pause , "
273677	273697	273703	273703	people	1124	" Then he put out his hand for hers , and she could not help giving it to him . "
273705	273709	273703	273703	people	1124	" he said , "
273732	273733	273734	273734	I	0	" "
273744	274314	273734	273734	I	0	" Then there came some one across them , and the conversation was ended ; but the sound of his voice remained on her ears , and she could not help but remember that he had declared that her friendship was dearer to him than the friendship of any one else . Phineas went with Mr. Monk first to Limerick and then to Dublin , and found himself at both places to be regarded as a hero only second to the great hero . At both places the one subject of debate was tenant - right ; - could anything be done to make it profitable for men with capital to put their capital into Irish land ? The fertility of the soil was questioned by no one , - nor the sufficiency of external circumstances , such as railroads and the like ; - nor the abundance of labour ; - nor even security for the wealth to be produced . The only difficulty was in this , that the men who were to produce the wealth had no guarantee that it would be theirs when it was created . In England and elsewhere such guarantees were in existence . Might it not be possible to introduce them into Ireland ? That was the question which Mr. Monk had in hand ; and in various speeches which he made both before and after the dinners given to him , he pledged himself to keep it well in hand when Parliament should meet . Of course Phineas spoke also . It was impossible that he should be silent when his friend and leader was pouring out his eloquence . Of course he spoke , and of course he pledged himself . Something like the old pleasures of the debating society returned to him , as standing upon a platform before a listening multitude , he gave full vent to his words . In the House of Commons , of late he had been so cabined , cribbed , and confined by office as to have enjoyed nothing of this . Indeed , from the commencement of his career , he had fallen so thoroughly into the decorum of Government ways , as to have missed altogether the delights of that wild irresponsible oratory of which Mr. Monk had spoken to him so often . He had envied men below the gangway , who , though supporting the Government on main questions , could get up on their legs whenever the House was full enough to make it worth their while , and say almost whatever they pleased . There was that Mr. Robson , who literally did say just what came uppermost ; and the thing that came uppermost was often ill - natured , often unbecoming the gravity of the House , was always startling ; but men listened to him and liked him to speak . But Mr. Robson had - married a woman with money . Oh , why , - why , had not Violet Effingham been kinder to him ? He might even yet , perhaps , marry a woman with money . But he could not bring himself to do so unless he loved her . The upshot of the Dublin meeting was that he also positively pledged himself to support during the next session of Parliament a bill advocating tenant - right . "
274325	274359	274318	274318	you	0	" Mr. Monk said to him almost as soon as the meeting was over . They were standing on the pier at Kingstown , and Mr. Monk was preparing to return to England . "
274369	274370	274363	274363	I	0	" "
274422	274423	274424	274424	He	431	" "

274683	275137	274675	274675	I	0	" Phineas was rather melancholy as he returned alone to Killaloe . It was all very well to bid him stick to the ship , and he knew as well as any one could tell him how material the ship was to him ; but there are circumstances in which a man can not stick to his ship , - can not stick , at least , to this special Government ship . He knew that whither Mr. Monk went , in this session , he must follow . He had considerable hope that when Mr. Monk explained his purpose to the Prime Minister , the Prime Minister would feel himself obliged to give way . In that case Phineas would not only be able to keep his office , but would have such an opportunity of making a speech in Parliament as circumstances had never yet given to him . When he was again at home he said nothing to his father or to the Killaloeians as to the danger of his position . Of what use would it be to make his mother and sisters miserable , or to incur the useless counsels of the doctor ? They seemed to think his speech at Dublin very fine , and were never tired of talking of what Mr. Monk and Phineas were going to do ; but the idea had not come home to them that if Mr. Monk or Phineas chose to do anything on their own account , they must give up the places which they held under the Crown . It was September when Phineas found himself back at Killaloe , and he was due to be at his office in London in November . The excitement of Mr. Monk 's company was now over , and he had nothing to do but to receive pouches full of official papers from the Colonial Office , and study all the statistics which came within his reach in reference to the proposed new law for tenant - right . In the meantime Mary was still living with her mother at Killaloe , and still kept herself somewhat aloof from the man she loved . How could it be possible for him not to give way in such circumstances as those ? One day he found himself talking to her about himself , and speaking to her of his own position with more frankness than he ever used with his own family . He had begun by reminding her of that conversation which they had had before he went away with Mr. Monk , and by reminding her also that she had promised to return to her old friendly ways with him . "

275205	275276	275194	275194	I	0	" he asked . Of course she expressed her surprise , almost her horror , at such an idea , and then he told her everything . It took long in the telling , because it was necessary that he should explain to her the working of the system which made it impossible for him , as a member of the Government , to entertain an opinion of his own .

275771	275800	275766	275766	I	0	" said Mary , to whom the occasion was becoming so embarrassing that she no longer was able to reply with words that had a meaning in them . "
275811	275826	275827	275827	I	0	" He paused , but of course she had not a syllable to say . "
275874	276047	275865	275865	you	382	" It had come at last , - the thing for which she had been ever wishing . It had come in spite of her imprudence , and in spite of her prudence . When she had heard him to the end she was not a whit angry with him , - she was not in the least aggrieved , - because he had been lost to her in his love for this Miss Effingham , while she had been so nearly lost by her love for him . For women such episodes in the lives of their lovers have an excitement which is almost pleasurable , whereas each man is anxious to hear his lady swear that until he appeared upon the scene her heart had been fancy free . Mary , upon the whole , had liked the story , - had thought that it had been finely told , and was well pleased with the final catastrophe . But , nevertheless , she was not prepared with her reply . "
276058	276094	276049	276049	you	6665	" he said , looking up into her eyes . I am afraid that he did not doubt what would be her answer , - as it would be good that all lovers should do . "
276104	276223	276224	276224	Mary	382	" When she essayed to speak she found that she was dumb . She could not get her voice to give her the assistance of a single word . She did not cry , but there was a motion as of sobbing in her throat which impeded all utterance . She was as happy as earth , - as heaven could make her ; but she did not know how to tell him that she was happy . And yet she longed to tell it , that he might know how thankful she was to him for his goodness . He still sat looking at her , and now by degrees he had got her hand in his . "
276226	276230	276224	276224	Mary	382	" he said , "
276242	276266	276269	276269	you	0	" When half an hour had passed , they were still together , and now she had found the use of her tongue . "
276273	276277	276278	276278	I	0	" she said . "
276350	276362	276365	276365	Phineas	329	" Then he took her in his arms and kissed her . "
276367	276371	276365	276365	Phineas	329	" she said , "

276535	276549	276533	276533	Barbara	361	" said the joyful girl , springing forward into her friend 's arms ; "
276565	276718	276724	276724	Mary	382	" CHAPTER LXVII Job 's Comforters Before Phineas had returned to London his engagement with Mary Flood Jones was known to all his family , was known to Mrs. Flood Jones , and was indeed known generally to all Killaloe . That other secret of his , which had reference to the probability of his being obliged to throw up his office , was known only to Mary herself . He thought that he had done all that honour required of him in telling her of his position before he had proposed ; - so that she might on that ground refuse him if she were so minded . And yet he had known very well that such prudence on her part was not to be expected . If she loved him , of course she would say so when she was asked . And he had known that she loved him . "
276726	276736	276724	276724	Mary	382	" he said to her as he was going ; "
276751	276752	276753	276753	I	0	" "
276769	276773	276762	276762	you	0	" she said . "

276865	277013	277039	277039	you	6678	" And thus they parted . Mary , though of course she would have preferred that her future husband should remain in his high office , that he should be a member of Parliament and an Under - Secretary of State , admitted no doubt into her mind to disturb her happiness ; and Phineas , though he had many misgivings as to the prudence of what he had done , was not the less strong in his resolution of constancy and endurance . He would throw up his position , resign his seat , and go to work at the Bar instantly , if he found that his independence as a man required him to do so . And , above all , let come what might , he would be true to Mary Flood Jones . December was half over before he saw Lord Cantrip . "
277019	277035	277039	277039	you	6678	" said Lord Cantrip , when the Under - Secretary began to tell his story ; "
277052	277053	277045	277045	I	0	" "

277198	277202	277187	277187	He	346	" said Phineas . "
277267	277733	277734	277734	I	0	" When Parliament met the first great subject of interest was the desertion of Mr. Monk from the Ministry . He at once took his place below the gangway , sitting as it happened exactly in front of Mr. Turnbull , and there he made his explanation . Some one opposite asked a question whether a certain right honourable gentleman had not left the Cabinet . Then Mr. Gresham replied that to his infinite regret his right honourable friend , who lately presided at the Board of Trade , had resigned ; and he went on to explain that this resignation had , according to his ideas , been quite unnecessary . His right honourable friend entertained certain ideas about Irish tenant - right , as to which he himself and his right honourable friend the Secretary for Ireland could not exactly pledge themselves to be in unison with him ; but he had thought that the motion might have rested at any rate over this session . Then Mr. Monk explained , making his first great speech on Irish tenant - right . He found himself obliged to advocate some immediate measure for giving security to the Irish farmer ; and as he could not do so as a member of the Cabinet , he was forced to resign the honour of that position . He said something also as to the great doubt which had ever weighed on his own mind as to the inexpediency of a man at his time of life submitting himself for the first time to the trammels of office . This called up Mr. Turnbull , who took the opportunity of saying that he now agreed cordially with his old friend for the first time since that old friend had listened to the blandishments of the ministerial seducer , and that he welcomed his old friend back to those independent benches with great satisfaction . In this way the debate was very exciting . Nothing was said which made it then necessary for Phineas to get upon his legs or to declare himself ; but he perceived that the time would rapidly come in which he must do so . Mr. Gresham , though he strove to speak with gentle words , was evidently very angry with the late President of the Board of Trade ; and , moreover , it was quite clear that a bill would be introduced by Mr. Monk himself , which Mr. Gresham was determined to oppose . If all this came to pass and there should be a close division , Phineas felt that his fate would be sealed . When he again spoke to Lord Cantrip on the subject , the Secretary of State shrugged his shoulders and shook his head . "
277740	277745	277734	277734	I	0	" said Lord Cantrip , "
277767	277768	277806	277806	your	6686	" "
277779	277793	277806	277806	your	6686	" he said in the letter which he wrote to Mary that night . "
277818	277862	277863	277863	I	0	" He had been with Madame Goesler frequently in the winter , and had discussed with her so often the question of his official position that she had declared that she was coming at last to understand the mysteries of an English Cabinet . "
277873	277878	277865	277865	you	6686	" she said , - "
277921	277958	277884	277884	you	6686	" Then , when he came to talk to her of money , - that he must give up Parliament itself , if he gave up his place , - she offered to lend him money . "
277969	278009	277961	277961	you	6686	" she said . When he pointed out to her that there would never come a time in which he could pay such money back , she stamped her foot and told him that he had better leave her . "
278015	278019	278010	278010	You	6686	" she said , "
278044	278170	278010	278010	You	6686	" Then Phineas assured her with tears in his eyes that such an arrangement was impossible without disgrace to him . But he whispered to this new friend no word of the engagement with his dear Irish Mary . His Irish life , he would tell himself , was a thing quite apart and separate from his life in England . He said not a word about Mary Flood Jones to any of those with whom he lived in London . Why should he , feeling as he did that it would so soon be necessary that he should disappear from among them ? About Miss Effingham he had said much to Madame Goesler . She had asked him whether he had abandoned all hope . "
278179	278184	278010	278010	You	6686	" she had said . "
278194	278195	278010	278010	You	6686	" "
278208	278209	278210	278210	Heaven	537	" "

278268	278363	278250	278250	she	6691	" And Phineas , as he made this acknowledgment , seemed to do so without much inward agony of soul . When he had been last in London he could not speak of Violet and Lord Chiltern together without showing that his misery was almost too much for him . At this time he received some counsel from two friends . One was Laurence Fitzgibbon , and the other was Barrington Erle . Laurence had always been true to him after a fashion , and had never resented his intrusion at the Colonial Office . "
278369	278373	278250	278250	she	6691	" he said , "
278387	278388	278380	278380	you	329	" "

278571	278631	278632	278632	I	0	" Phineas so far agreed with his friend Laurence that he thought it possible that Madame Goesler might accept him were he to propose marriage to her . He knew , of course , that that mode of escape from his difficulties was out of the question for him , but he could not explain this to Laurence Fitzgibbon . "
278646	278653	278632	278632	I	0	" said Barrington Erle to him . "

279284	279301	279282	279282	Barrington	364	" said Phineas , who was greatly moved by the energy and solicitude of his friend . "
279339	279351	279331	279331	Morrison	707	" Sir Walter Morrison was at this time Secretary for Ireland . "

279520	279949	279950	279950	I	0	" Phineas could only thank his friend for his advice , which was at least disinterested , and was good of its kind , and tell him that he would think of it . He did think of it very much . He almost thought that , were it to do again , he would allow Mr. Monk to go upon his tour alone , and keep himself from the utterance of anything that so good a judge as Erle could call stump balderdash . As he sat in his arm - chair in his room at the Colonial Office , with despatch - boxes around him , and official papers spread before him , - feeling himself to be one of those who in truth managed and governed the affairs of this great nation , feeling also that if he relinquished his post now he could never regain it , - he did wish that he had been a little less in love with independence , a little quieter in his boastings that no official considerations should ever silence his tongue . But all this was too late now . He knew that his skin was not thick enough to bear the arrows of those archers who would bend their bows against him if he should now dare to vote against Mr. Monk 's motion . His own party might be willing to forgive and forget ; but there would be others who would read those reports , and would appear in the House with the odious tell - tale newspapers in their hands . Then he received a letter from his father . Some good - natured person had enlightened the doctor as to the danger in which his son was placing himself . Dr. Finn , who in his own profession was a very excellent and well - instructed man , had been so ignorant of Parliamentary tactics , as to have been proud at his son 's success at the Irish meetings . He had thought that Phineas was carrying on his trade as a public speaker with proper energy and continued success . He had cared nothing himself for tenant - right , and had acknowledged to Mr. Monk that he could not understand in what it was that the farmers were wronged . But he knew that Mr. Monk was a Cabinet Minister , and he thought that Phineas was earning his salary . Then there came some one who undeceived him , and the paternal bosom of the doctor was dismayed . "
279957	279964	279950	279950	I	0	" he said in his letter , "
280022	280100	280005	280005	I	0	" Mary also wrote to him . Mrs. Finn had been talking to her , and Mary had taught herself to believe that after the many sweet conversations she had had with a man so high in office as Phineas , she really did understand something about the British Government . Mrs. Finn had interrogated Mary , and Mary had been obliged to own that it was quite possible that Phineas would be called upon to resign . "
280117	280118	280142	280142	he	6746	" "
280126	280131	280132	280132	Fiddlestick	383	" said Mary proudly . "
280134	280139	280142	280142	he	6746	" said Mrs. Finn . "
280175	280257	280164	280164	he	6746	" Then Mrs. Finn began to cry ; and Mary could only write to her lover , pointing out to him how very anxious all his friends were that he should do nothing in a hurry . But what if the thing were done already ! Phineas in his great discomfort went to seek further counsel from Madame Goesler . Of all his counsellors , Madame Goesler was the only one who applauded him for what he was about to do . "
280287	280288	280270	280271	Mr. Gresham	431	" "
280302	280303	280270	280271	Mr. Gresham	431	" "
280355	280393	280350	280351	Lord Brock	698	" Phineas endeavoured to make her understand that of the four Prime Ministers whom she had named , three were men of the same party as himself , under whom it would have suited him to serve . "
280410	280415	280350	280351	Lord Brock	698	" said Madame Goesler . "
280424	280430	280431	280433	A poor fellow	6756	" said Phineas , laughing . "
280444	281470	281471	281471	Finn	329	" said Madame Goesler . Immediately after this Phineas left her , and as he went along the street he began to question himself whether the prospects of his own darling Mary were at all endangered by his visits to Park Lane ; and to reflect what sort of a blackguard he would be , - a blackguard of how deep a dye , - were he to desert Mary and marry Madame Max Goesler . Then he also asked himself as to the nature and quality of his own political honesty if he were to abandon Mary in order that he might maintain his parliamentary independence . After all , if it should ever come to pass that his biography should be written , his biographer would say very much more about the manner in which he kept his seat in Parliament than of the manner in which he kept his engagement with Miss Mary Flood Jones . Half a dozen people who knew him and her might think ill of him for his conduct to Mary , but the world would not condemn him ! And when he thundered forth his liberal eloquence from below the gangway as an independent member , having the fortune of his charming wife to back him , giving excellent dinners at the same time in Park Lane , would not the world praise him very loudly ? When he got to his office he found a note from Lord Brentford inviting him to dine in Portman Square . CHAPTER LXVIII The Joint Attack The note from Lord Brentford surprised our hero not a little . He had had no communication with the Earl since the day on which he had been so savagely scolded about the duel , when the Earl had plainly told him that his conduct had been as bad as it could be . Phineas had not on that account become at all ashamed of his conduct in reference to the duel , but he had conceived that any reconciliation between him and the Earl had been out of the question . Now there had come a civilly - worded invitation , asking him to dine with the offended nobleman . The note had been written by Lady Laura , but it had purported to come from Lord Brentford himself . He sent back word to say that he should be happy to have the honour of dining with Lord Brentford . Parliament at this time had been sitting nearly a month , and it was already March . Phineas had heard nothing of Lady Laura , and did not even know that she was in London till he saw her handwriting . He did not know that she had not gone back to her husband , and that she had remained with her father all the winter at Saulsby . He had also heard that Lord Chiltern had been at Saulsby . All the world had been talking of the separation of Mr. Kennedy from his wife , one half of the world declaring that his wife , if not absolutely false to him , had neglected all her duties ; and the other half asserting that Mr. Kennedy 's treatment of his wife had been so bad that no woman could possibly have lived with him . There had even been a rumour that Lady Laura had gone off with a lover from the Duke of Omnium 's garden party , and some indiscreet tongue had hinted that a certain unmarried Under - Secretary of State was missing at the same time . But Lord Chiltern upon this had shown his teeth with so strong a propensity to do some real biting , that no one had ventured to repeat that rumour . Its untruth was soon established by the fact that Lady Laura Kennedy was living with her father at Saulsby . Of Mr. Kennedy , Phineas had as yet seen nothing since he had been up in town . That gentleman , though a member of the Cabinet , had not been in London at the opening of the session , nor had he attended the Cabinet meetings during the recess . It had been stated in the newspapers that he was ill , and stated in private that he could not bear to show himself since his wife had left him . At last , however , he came to London , and Phineas saw him in the House . Then , when the first meeting of the Cabinet was summoned after his return , it became known that he also had resigned his office . There was nothing said about his resignation in the House . He had resigned on the score of ill - health , and that very worthy peer , Lord Mount Thistle , formerly Sir Marmaduke Morecombe , came back to the Duchy of Lancaster in his place . A Prime Minister sometimes finds great relief in the possession of a serviceable stick who can be made to go in and out as occasion may require ; only it generally happens that the stick will expect some reward when he is made to go out . Lord Mount Thistle immediately saw his way to a viscount 's coronet , when he was once more summoned to the august councils of the Ministers . A few days after this had been arranged , in the interval between Lord Brentford 's invitation and Lord Brentford 's dinner , Phineas encountered Mr. Kennedy so closely in one of the passages of the House that it was impossible that they should not speak to each other , unless they were to avoid each other as people do who have palpably quarrelled . Phineas saw that Mr. Kennedy was hesitating , and therefore took the bull by the horns . He greeted his former friend in a friendly fashion , shaking him by the hand , and then prepared to pass on . But Mr. Kennedy , though he had hesitated at first , now detained his brother member . "
281473	281477	281471	281471	Finn	329	" he said , "
281494	281523	281483	281483	I	0	" Phineas was not engaged , and allowed himself to be led out arm - in - arm by the late Chancellor of the Duchy into Westminster Hall . "
281537	281542	281526	281526	you	329	" said Mr. Kennedy . "
281552	281556	281546	281546	I	0	" said Phineas . "

281743	281777	281735	281735	she	6762	" Phineas as he heard this could not but remember all that Lady Laura had told himself , and thought that no woman had ever had a better reason for leaving her husband . "
281791	281792	281787	281787	I	0	" "
281801	281805	281787	281787	I	0	" replied Phineas . "

281866	281898	281903	281903	my	0	" Then he paused ; but as Phineas had no further remark to make , he continued speaking after they had walked about a third of the length of the hall . "
281943	281944	281960	281960	she	1857	" "
281954	281958	281960	281960	she	1857	" said Phineas . "
281971	281978	281960	281960	she	1857	" said Mr. Kennedy , solemnly . "
281999	282000	281995	281995	You	0	" "
282052	282130	282033	282033	you	0	" Now it seemed to Phineas that of all the messengers whom Mr. Kennedy could have chosen he was the most unsuited to be a Mercury in this cause , - not perceiving that he had been so selected with some craft , in order that Lady Laura might understand that the accusation against her was , at any rate , withdrawn , which had named Phineas as her lover . He paused again before he answered . "
282134	282138	282033	282033	you	0	" he said , "
282215	282216	282198	282198	He	733	" "
282223	282238	282217	282217	I	0	" said Mr. Kennedy , frowning blackly as he remembered his wife 's duplicity . "
282275	282276	282279	282279	Chiltern	463	" "
282295	282296	282283	282283	He	733	" "
282303	282304	282305	282305	I	0	" "
282315	282316	282319	282319	him	733	" "
282321	282322	282323	282323	I	0	" "
282334	282335	282338	282338	her	6775	" "
282340	282341	282342	282342	I	0	" "
282427	282495	282415	282416	the Earl	674	" The conference ended by a promise from Phineas that he would , if possible , say a word to Lady Laura . When he was shown into Lord Brentford 's drawing - room he found not only Lady Laura there , but her brother . Lord Brentford was not in the room . Barrington Erle was there , and so also were Lord and Lady Cantrip . "
282505	282517	282415	282416	the Earl	674	" he said to Lady Laura , after their first greeting . "
282524	282528	282518	282518	We	6782	" said she , "
282549	282550	282547	282547	Oswald	516	" "
282574	282659	282564	282564	he	1238	" said Lord Chiltern ; upon which Phineas immediately understood that the father and the son were reconciled , and he rushed to the conclusion that Violet and her lover would also soon be reconciled , if such were not already the case . He felt some remnant of a soreness that it should be so , as a man feels where his headache has been when the real ache itself has left him . Then the host came in and made his apologies . "
282666	282670	282660	282660	Chiltern	463	" he said , "
282699	282820	282826	282827	young man	6784	" Phineas felt quite sure now that Violet and her lover were reconciled , and he had a distinct feeling of the place where the ache had been . Dear Violet ! But , after all , Violet lacked that sweet , clinging , feminine softness which made Mary Flood Jones so pre - eminently the most charming of her sex . The Earl , when he had repeated his general apology , especially to Lady Cantrip , who was the only lady present except his daughter , came up to our hero and shook him kindly by the hand . He took him up to one of the windows and then addressed him in a voice of mock solemnity . "
282829	282833	282826	282827	young man	6784	" he said , "
282847	282848	282852	282853	my Lord	7277	" "
282859	282860	282852	282853	my Lord	7277	" "
282925	282970	283000	283000	He	1238	" And the Earl walked off with Lady Cantrip , and Lord Cantrip walked off with Lady Laura . Barrington Erle followed , and Phineas had an opportunity of saying a word to his friend , Lord Chiltern , as they went down together . "
282981	282982	283000	283000	He	1238	" "
283018	283019	283000	283000	He	1238	" "
283025	283026	283000	283000	He	1238	" "
283075	283273	283274	283274	I	0	" But there was not a word said about his marriage . There were only seven who sat down to dinner , and the six were all people with whom Phineas was or had been on most intimate terms . Lord Cantrip was his official chief , and , since that connection had existed between them , Lady Cantrip had been very gracious to him . She quite understood the comfort which it was to her husband to have under him , as his representative in the House of Commons , a man whom he could thoroughly trust and like , and therefore she had used her woman 's arts to bind Phineas to her lord in more than mere official bondage . She had tried her skill also upon Laurence Fitzgibbon , - but altogether in vain . He had eaten her dinners and accepted her courtesies , and had given for them no return whatever . But Phineas had possessed a more grateful mind , and had done all that had been required of him ; - had done all that had been required of him till there had come that terrible absurdity in Ireland . "
283297	283433	283291	283292	Mr. Monk	346	" Lady Cantrip had said to her husband . But though the party was very small , and though the guests were all his intimate friends , Phineas suspected nothing special till an attack was made upon him as soon as the servants had left the room . This was done in the presence of the two ladies , and , no doubt , had been preconcerted . There was Lord Cantrip there , who had already said much to him , and Barrington Erle who had said more even than Lord Cantrip . Lord Brentford , himself a member of the Cabinet , opened the attack by asking whether it was actually true that Mr. Monk meant to go on with his motion . Barrington Erle asserted that Mr. Monk positively would do so . "
283440	283445	283448	283448	he	431	" asked the Earl . "
283451	283455	283458	283458	he	431	" said Barrington . "
283461	283466	283458	283458	he	431	" said Lord Cantrip . "
283480	283485	283470	283470	I	0	" said Lady Cantrip . "
283501	283534	283470	283470	I	0	" said Lady Laura . Then Phineas knew pretty well what was coming on him . Lord Brentford began again by asking how many supporters Mr. Monk would have in the House . "
283548	283553	283543	283544	the Conservatives	4513	" said Barrington Erle . "
283585	283586	283581	283581	they	4513	" "
283593	283598	283599	283599	You	6798	" asked Lord Cantrip . "
283608	283654	283605	283606	Phineas Finn	329	" said Barrington . And then the attack was made . Our hero had a bad half hour of it , though many words were said which must have gratified him much . They all wanted to keep him , - so Lord Cantrip declared , "
283674	283895	283896	283896	We	6799	" said Barrington , thinking that certain reminiscences of Phineas with regard to Mr. Bonteen and others might operate as strongly as any other consideration to make him love his place . Lord Brentford declared that he could not understand it , - that he should find himself lost in amazement if such a man as his young friend allowed himself to be led into the outer wilderness by such an ignis - fatuus of light as this . Lord Cantrip laid down the unwritten traditional law of Government officials very plainly . A man in office , - in an office which really imposed upon him as much work as he could possibly do with credit to himself or his cause , - was dispensed from the necessity of a conscience with reference to other matters . It was for Sir Walter Morrison to have a conscience about Irish tenant - right , as no doubt he had , - just as Phineas Finn had a conscience about Canada , and Jamaica , and the Cape . Barrington Erle was very strong about parties in general , and painted the comforts of official position in glowing colours . But I think that the two ladies were more efficacious than even their male relatives in the arguments which they used . "
283907	283922	283896	283896	We	6799	" said Lady Cantrip , looking at him with beseeching , almost loving eyes . "
283927	283932	283896	283896	We	6799	" said Lady Laura , "
283958	283959	283960	283960	We	6799	" "
283977	283982	283960	283960	We	6799	" said Lady Cantrip . "
283992	283997	283988	283988	I	0	" said Lady Laura , "
284015	284214	283999	283999	I	0	" What was he to say in answer to applications so flattering and so pressing ? He would have said nothing , had that been possible , but he felt himself obliged to reply . He replied very weakly , - of course , not justifying himself , but declaring that as he had gone so far he must go further . He must vote for the measure now . Both his chief and Barrington Erle proved , or attempted to prove , that he was wrong in this . Of course he would not speak on the measure , and his vote for his party would probably be allowed to pass without notice . One or two newspapers might perhaps attack him ; but what public man cared for such attacks as those ? His whole party would hang by him , and in that he would find ample consolation . Phineas could only say that he would think of it ; - and this he said in so irresolute a tone of voice that all the men then present believed that he was gained . The two ladies , however , were of a different opinion . "
284236	284265	284224	284224	he	6803	" said Laura to her father afterwards . But then Lady Laura had been in love with him , - was perhaps almost in love with him still . "
284274	284282	284266	284266	I	0	" said Lady Cantrip to her husband . "
284298	284303	284283	284283	He	6803	" said his lordship . "
284320	284367	284314	284314	you	6806	" said Lady Cantrip . But Lady Cantrip had never been in love with Phineas . Phineas found a moment , before he left Lord Brentford 's house , to say a word to Lady Laura as to the commission that had been given to him . "
284373	284381	284314	284314	you	6806	" said Lady Laura , shuddering ; - "
284388	284389	284390	284390	You	6806	" "
284399	284400	284390	284390	You	6806	" "
284411	284412	284413	284413	He	6803	" "
284421	284422	284413	284413	He	6803	" "
284501	284547	284495	284495	His	6803	" When Phineas repeated this , or as much of this as he judged to be necessary , to Mr. Kennedy a day or two afterwards , that gentleman replied that in such case he would have no alternative but to seek redress at law . "
284556	284560	284495	284495	His	6803	" said he , "
284626	284737	284738	284738	You	6811	" That very day Mr. Kennedy went to his lawyer , and desired that steps might be taken for the restitution to him of his conjugal rights . CHAPTER LXIX The Temptress Mr. Monk 's bill was read the first time before Easter , and Phineas Finn still held his office . He had spoken to the Prime Minister once on the subject , and had been surprised at that gentleman 's courtesy ; - for Mr. Gresham had the reputation of being unconciliatory in his manners , and very prone to resent anything like desertion from that allegiance which was due to himself as the leader of his party . "
284763	284768	284760	284760	your	6811	" said Mr. Gresham . "
284778	284782	284775	284775	my	0	" said Phineas . "
284791	284797	284775	284775	my	0	" replied the great man , "
284856	286102	286103	286104	Mr. Kennedy	343	" Mr. Gresham possibly imagined that Mr. Monk might be moved to abandon his bill , when he saw what injury he was about to do . At this time Phineas received the following letter from his darling Mary : - Floodborough , Thursday . DEAREST PHINEAS , We have just got home from Killaloe , and mean to remain here all through the summer . After leaving your sisters this house seems so desolate ; but I shall have the more time to think of you . I have been reading Tennyson , as you told me , and I fancy that I could in truth be a Mariana here , if it were not that I am so quite certain that you will come ; - and that makes all the difference in the world in a moated grange . Last night I sat at the window and tried to realise what I should feel if you were to tell me that you did not want me ; and I got myself into such an ecstatic state of mock melancholy that I cried for half an hour . But when one has such a real living joy at the back of one 's romantic melancholy , tears are very pleasant ; - they water and do not burn . I must tell you about them all at Killaloe . They certainly are very unhappy at the idea of your resigning . Your father says very little , but I made him own that to act as you are acting for the sake of principle is very grand . I would not leave him till he had said so , and he did say it . Dear Mrs. Finn does not understand it as well , but she will do so . She complains mostly for my sake , and when I tell her that I will wait twenty years if it is necessary , she tells me I do not know what waiting means . But I will , - and will be happy , and will never really think myself a Mariana . Dear , dear , dear Phineas , indeed I wo n't . The girls are half sad and half proud . But I am wholly proud , and know that you are doing just what you ought to do . I shall think more of you as a man who might have been a Prime Minister than if you were really sitting in the Cabinet like Lord Cantrip . As for mamma , I can not make her quite understand it . She merely says that no young man who is going to be married ought to resign anything . Dear mamma ; - sometimes she does say such odd things . You told me to tell you everything , and so I have . I talk to some of the people here , and tell them what they might do if they had tenant - right . One old fellow , Mike Dufferty , - I do n't know whether you remember him , - asked if he would have to pay the rent all the same . When I said certainly he would , then he shook his head . But as you said once , when we want to do good to people one has no right to expect that they should understand it . It is like baptizing little infants . I got both your notes ; - seven words in one , Mr. Under - Secretary , and nine in the other ! But the one little word at the end was worth a whole sheet full of common words . How nice it is to write letters without paying postage , and to send them about the world with a grand name in the corner . When Barney brings me one he always looks as if he did n't know whether it was a love letter or an order to go to Botany Bay . If he saw the inside of them , how short they are , I do n't think he 'd think much of you as a lover nor yet as an Under - Secretary . But I think ever so much of you as both ; - I do , indeed ; and I am not scolding you a bit . As long as I can have two or three dear , sweet , loving words , I shall be as happy as a queen . Ah , if you knew it all ! But you never can know it all . A man has so many other things to learn that he can not understand it . Good - bye , dear , dear , dearest man . Whatever you do I shall be quite sure you have done the best . Ever your own , with all the love of her heart , MARY F. JONES . This was very nice . Such a man as was Phineas Finn always takes a delight which he can not express even to himself in the receipt of such a letter as this . There is nothing so flattering as the warm expression of the confidence of a woman 's love , and Phineas thought that no woman ever expressed this more completely than did his Mary . Dear , dearest Mary . As for giving her up , as for treachery to one so trusting , so sweet , so well beloved , that was out of the question . But nevertheless the truth came home to him more clearly day by day , that he of all men was the last who ought to have given himself up to such a passion . For her sake he ought to have abstained . So he told himself now . For her sake he ought to have kept aloof from her ; - and for his own sake he ought to have kept aloof from Mr. Monk . That very day , with Mary 's letter in his pocket , he went to the livery stables and explained that he would not keep his horse any longer . There was no difficulty about the horse . Mr. Howard Macleod of the Treasury would take him from that very hour . Phineas , as he walked away , uttered a curse upon Mr. Howard Macleod . Mr. Howard Macleod was just beginning the glory of his life in London , and he , Phineas Finn , was bringing his to an end . With Mary 's letter in his pocket he went up to Portman Square . He had again got into the habit of seeing Lady Laura frequently , and was often with her brother , who now again lived at his father 's house . A letter had reached Lord Brentford , through his lawyer , in which a demand was made by Mr. Kennedy for the return of his wife . She was quite determined that she would never go back to him ; and there had come to her a doubt whether it would not be expedient that she should live abroad so as to be out of the way of persecution from her husband . Lord Brentford was in great wrath , and Lord Chiltern had once or twice hinted that perhaps he had better ' see "
286150	286157	286158	286158	she	6815	" I think it will end , "
286161	286184	286158	286158	she	6815	" in my going to Dresden , and settling myself there . Papa will come to me when Parliament is not sitting . "
286185	286192	286258	286258	She	6815	" It will be very dull . "
286193	286244	286158	286158	she	6815	" Dull ! What does dulness amount to when one has come to such a pass as this ? When one is in the ruck of fortune , to be dull is very bad ; but when misfortune comes , simple dulness is nothing . It sounds almost like relief . "
286245	286257	286258	286258	She	6815	" It is so hard that you should be driven away . "
286291	286307	286158	286158	she	6815	" It is odd enough that we should both be going at the same time . "
286308	286315	286158	286158	she	6815	" But you will not go ? "
286316	286373	286158	286158	she	6815	" I think I shall . I have resolved upon this , - that if I give up my place , I will give up my seat too . I went into Parliament with the hope of office , and how can I remain there when I shall have gained it and then have lost it ? "
286374	286385	286158	286158	she	6815	" But you will stay in London , Mr. Finn ? "
286386	286452	286158	286158	she	6815	" I think not . After all that has come and gone I should not be happy here , and I should make my way easier and on cheaper terms in Dublin . My present idea is that I shall endeavour to make a practice over in my own country . It will be hard work beginning at the bottom ; - will it not ? "
286453	286458	286158	286158	she	6815	" And so unnecessary . "
286459	286485	286158	286158	she	6815	" Ah , Lady Laura , - if it only could be avoided ! But it is of no use going through all that again . "
286486	286503	286505	286506	Lady Laura	344	" How much we would both of us avoid if we could only have another chance ! "
286508	286548	286505	286506	Lady Laura	344	" If I could only be as I was before I persuaded myself to marry a man whom I never loved , what a paradise the earth would be to me ! With me all regrets are too late . "
286549	286557	286158	286158	she	6815	" And with me as much so . "
286558	286583	286158	286158	she	6815	" No , Mr. Finn . Even should you resign your office , there is no reason why you should give up your seat . "
286584	286597	286598	286598	She	344	" Simply that I have no income to maintain me in London . "
286638	286649	286650	286650	she	344	" I wonder whether I may speak to you plainly , "
286653	286658	286650	286650	she	344	" Indeed you may . "
286659	286664	286608	286608	she	344	" On any subject ? "
286665	286673	286608	286608	she	344	" Yes ; - on any subject . "
286674	286692	286650	286650	she	344	" I trust you have been able to rid your bosom of all remembrances of Violet Effingham . "
286693	286703	286608	286608	she	344	" Certainly not of all remembrances , Lady Laura . "
286704	286711	286608	286608	she	344	" Of all hope , then ? "
286712	286719	286650	286650	she	344	" I have no such hope . "
286720	286727	286608	286608	she	344	" And of all lingering desires ? "
286728	286756	286608	286608	she	344	" Well , yes ; - and of all lingering desires . I know now that it can not be . Your brother is welcome to her . "
286757	286819	286650	286650	she	344	" Ah ; - of that I know nothing . He , with his perversity , has estranged her . But I am sure of this , - that if she do not marry him , she will marry no one . But it is not on account of him that I speak . He must fight his own battles now . "
286820	286831	286608	286608	she	344	" I shall not interfere with him , Lady Laura . "
286832	286866	286650	286650	she	344	" Then why should you not establish yourself by a marriage that will make place a matter of indifference to you ? I know that it is within your power to do so . "
286985	286994	286995	286995	she	344	" I tell you that it is so , "
287000	287006	286995	286995	she	344	" I am afraid not . "
287007	287023	287077	287077	her	344	" Go to Madame Goesler , and ask her . Hear what she will say . "
287024	287035	286995	286995	she	344	" Madame Goesler would laugh at me , no doubt . "
287036	287071	286995	286995	she	344	" Psha ! You do not think so . You know that she would not laugh . And are you the man to be afraid of a woman 's laughter ? I think not . "
287094	287106	287089	287089	his	329	" What was it you said of yourself , just now ? "
287107	287115	286995	286995	she	344	" What did I say of myself ? "
287116	287135	286995	286995	she	344	" You regretted that you had consented to marry a man , - whom you did not love . "
287136	287224	287089	287089	his	329	" Why should you not love her ? And it is so different with a man ! A woman is wretched if she does not love her husband , but I fancy that a man gets on very well without any such feeling . She can not domineer over you . She can not expect you to pluck yourself out of your own soil , and begin a new growth altogether in accordance with the laws of her own . It was that which Mr. Kennedy did . "
287225	287246	286995	286995	she	344	" I do not for a moment think that she would take me , if I were to offer myself . "
287247	287251	287253	287254	Lady Laura	344	" Try her , "
287257	287273	287253	287254	Lady Laura	344	" Such trials cost you but little ; - we both of us know that ! "
287285	287429	287275	287275	he	6817	" It is everything that you should go on now that you have once begun . I do not believe in you working at the Bar . You can not do it . A man who has commenced life as you have done with the excitement of politics , who has known what it is to take a prominent part in the control of public affairs , can not give it up and be happy at other work . Make her your wife , and you may resign or remain in office just as you choose . Office will be much easier to you than it is now , because it will not be a necessity . Let me at any rate have the pleasure of thinking that one of us can remain here , - that we need not both fall together . "
287729	287738	287739	287739	he	6817	" You appear to me as a tempter , "
287747	287773	287739	287739	he	6817	" It is unkind of you to say that , and ungrateful . I would do anything on earth in my power to help you . "
287774	287781	287739	287739	he	6817	" Nevertheless you are a tempter . "
287782	287792	287793	287793	she	344	" I know how it ought to have been , "
287801	287841	287793	287793	she	344	" I know very well how it ought to have been . I should have kept myself free till that time when we met on the braes of Loughlinter , and then all would have been well with us . "
287842	287853	287855	287855	Phineas	329	" I do not know how that might have been , "
287859	287945	287855	287855	Phineas	329	" You do not know ! But I know . Of course you have stabbed me with a thousand daggers when you have told me from time to time of your love for Violet . You have been very cruel , - needlessly cruel . Men are so cruel ! But for all that I have known that I could have kept you , - had it not been too late when you spoke to me . Will you not own as much as that ? "
287946	287966	287739	287739	he	6817	" Of course you would have been everything to me . I should never have thought of Violet then . "
287967	288049	287739	287739	he	6817	" That is the only kind word you have said to me from that day to this . I try to comfort myself in thinking that it would have been so . But all that is past and gone , and done . I have had my romance and you have had yours . As you are a man , it is natural that you should have been disturbed by a double image ; - it is not so with me . "
288050	288078	287855	287855	Phineas	329	" And yet you can advise me to offer marriage to a woman , - a woman whom I am to seek merely because she is rich ? "
288079	288401	287739	287739	he	6817	" Yes ; - I do so advise you . You have had your romance and must now put up with reality . Why should I so advise you but for the interest that I have in you ? Your prosperity will do me no good . I shall not even be here to see it . I shall hear of it only as so many a woman banished out of England hears a distant misunderstood report of what is going on in the country she has left . But I still have regard enough , - I will be bold , and , knowing that you will not take it amiss , will say love enough for you , - to feel a desire that you should not be shipwrecked . Since we first took you in hand between us , Barrington and I , I have never swerved in my anxiety on your behalf . When I resolved that it would be better for us both that we should be only friends , I did not swerve . When you would talk to me so cruelly of your love for Violet , I did not swerve . When I warned you from Loughlinter because I thought there was danger , I did not swerve . When I bade you not to come to me in London because of my husband , I did not swerve . When my father was hard upon you , I did not swerve then . I would not leave him till he was softened . When you tried to rob Oswald of his love , and I thought you would succeed , - for I did think so , - I did not swerve . I have ever been true to you . And now that I must hide myself and go away , and be seen no more , I am true still . "
288402	288409	288410	288410	he	6826	" Laura , - dearest Laura ! "
288413	288418	288419	288419	she	6827	" Ah , no ! "
288435	288493	288419	288419	she	6827	" it must not be like that . There is no room for that . Nor do you mean it . I do not think so ill of you . But there may not be even words of affection between us - only such as I may speak to make you know that I am your friend . "
288494	288500	288501	288501	he	6826	" You are my friend , "
288517	288525	288501	288501	he	6826	" You are my friend , indeed . "
288526	288536	288537	288537	He	6826	" Then do as I would have you do . "
289045	289057	289059	289059	Bonteen	408	" So I am told you are going to leave us , "
289061	289076	289078	289078	Phineas	329	" Who can have been ill - natured enough to whisper such a thing ? "
289080	289092	289094	289094	Ratler	417	" The whispers are very loud , I can tell you , "
289096	289126	289094	289094	Ratler	417	" I think I know already pretty nearly how every man in the House will vote , and I have not got your name down on the right side . "
289127	289135	289137	289137	Phineas	329	" Change it for heaven 's sake , "
289139	289153	289155	289155	Ratler	417	" I will , if you 'll tell me seriously that I may , "
289157	289162	289164	289164	Bonteen	408	" My opinion is , "
289166	289186	289164	289164	Bonteen	408	" that a man should be known either as a friend or foe . I respect a declared foe . "
289187	289196	289198	289198	Phineas	329	" Know me as a declared foe then , "
289200	289205	289198	289198	Phineas	329	" and respect me . "
289206	289213	289215	289215	Ratler	417	" That 's all very well , "
289217	289258	289215	289215	Ratler	417	" but it means nothing . I 've always had a sort of fear about you , Finn , that you would go over the traces some day . Of course it 's a very grand thing to be independent . "
289259	289267	289269	289269	Bonteen	408	" The finest thing in the world , "
289271	289280	289269	289269	Bonteen	408	" only so d - - d useless . "
289281	289313	289198	289198	Phineas	329	" But a man should n't be independent and stick to the ship at the same time . You forget the trouble you cause , and how you upset all calculations . "
289314	289323	289325	289325	Phineas	329	" I had n't thought of the calculations , "
289327	289334	289336	289336	Bonteen	408	" The fact is , Finn , "
289338	289389	289336	289336	Bonteen	408	" you are made of clay too fine for office . I 've always found it has been so with men from your country . You are the grandest horses in the world to look at out on a prairie , but you do n't like the slavery of harness . "
289390	289411	289198	289198	Phineas	329	" And the sound of a whip over our shoulders sets us kicking ; - does it not , Ratler ? "
289412	289424	289426	289426	Ratler	417	" I shall show the list to Gresham to - morrow , "
289428	289449	289426	289426	Ratler	417	" and of course he can do as he pleases ; but I do n't understand this kind of thing . "
289450	289459	289461	289461	Bonteen	408	" Do n't you be in a hurry , "
289463	289517	289461	289461	Bonteen	408	" I 'll bet you a sovereign Finn votes with us yet . There 's nothing like being a little coy to set off a girl 's charms . I 'll bet you a sovereign , Ratler , that Finn goes out into the lobby with you and me against Monk 's bill . "
290307	290314	290316	290316	Phineas	329	" Halloa , - you here ? "
290318	290324	290326	290327	the other	7702	" Yes , by George ! "
290329	290370	290326	290327	the other	7702	" but I am going to escape as soon as possible . I 've been trying to make my way up for the last hour , but could never get round that huge promontory there . Laura was more persevering . "
290371	290376	290377	290377	Phineas	329	" Is Kennedy here ? "
290380	290386	290388	290388	Chiltern	463	" I do not know , "
290390	290400	290388	290388	Chiltern	463	" but she was determined to run the chance . "
290426	290434	290436	290436	Phineas	329	" So you are still admitted privately , "
290438	290486	290436	290436	Phineas	329	" Oh dear yes , - and we have just been having a most friendly conversation about you . What a man he is ! He knows everything . He is so accurate ; so just in the abstract , - and in the abstract so generous ! "
290487	290503	290505	290505	Phineas	329	" He has been very generous to me in detail as well as in abstract , "
290507	290592	290505	290505	Phineas	329	" Ah , yes ; I am not thinking of individuals exactly . His want of generosity is to large masses , - to a party , to classes , to a people ; whereas his generosity is for mankind at large . He assumes the god , affects to nod , and seems to shake the spheres . But I have nothing against him . He has asked me here to - night , and has talked to me most familiarly about Ireland . "
290593	290606	290608	290608	Phineas	329	" What do you think of your chance of a second reading ? "
290610	290629	290608	290608	Phineas	329	" What do you think of it ? - you hear more of those things than I do . "
290630	290640	290436	290436	Phineas	329	" Everybody says it will be a close division . "
290641	290647	290649	290650	Mr. Monk	346	" I never expected it , "
290652	290687	290649	290650	Mr. Monk	346	" Nor I , till I heard what Daubeny said at the first reading . They will all vote for the bill en masse , - hating it in their hearts all the time . "
290688	290700	290436	290436	Phineas	329	" Let us hope they are not so bad as that . "
290701	290779	290436	290436	Phineas	329	" It is the way with them always . They do all our work for us , - sailing either on one tack or the other . That is their use in creation , that when we split among ourselves , as we always do , they come in and finish our job for us . It must be unpleasant for them to be always doing that which they always say should never be done at all . "
290780	290798	290800	290801	Mr. Monk	346	" Wherever the gift horse may come from , I shall not look it in the mouth , "
290803	290830	290800	290801	Mr. Monk	346	" There is only one man in the House whom I hope I may not see in the lobby with me , and that is yourself . "
290831	290838	290840	290840	Phineas	329	" The question is decided now , "
290842	290849	290840	290840	Phineas	329	" And how is it decided ? "
290900	291001	290886	290886	he	329	" Oh , I shall be with you . I know what you are going to say , and I know how good you are . But I could not stand it . Men are beginning already to say things which almost make me get up and kick them . If I can help it , I will give occasion to no man to hint anything to me which can make me be so wretched as I have been to - day . Pray do not say anything more . My idea is that I shall resign to - morrow . "
291002	291016	291018	291019	Mr. Monk	346	" Then I hope that we may fight the battle side by side , "
291026	291036	291038	291038	Phineas	329	" We will fight the battle side by side , "
291173	291180	291182	291183	Mr. Gresham	431	" Very glad to see you , "
291185	291203	291182	291183	Mr. Gresham	431	" You , I find , are a persevering man , with a genius for getting upwards . "
291204	291209	291211	291211	Phineas	329	" Like the sparks , "
291213	291219	291221	291222	Mr. Gresham	431	" Not quite so quickly , "
291224	291238	291221	291222	Mr. Gresham	431	" But with the same assurance of speedy loss of my little light . "
291255	291264	291250	291250	he	329	" Have you seen the news from America ? "
291265	291279	291281	291281	Phineas	329	" Yes , I have seen it , but do not believe it , "
291283	291331	291281	291281	Phineas	329	" Ah , you have such faith in a combination of British colonies , properly backed in Downing Street , as to think them strong against a world in arms . In your place I should hold to the same doctrine , - hold to it stoutly . "
291332	291344	291250	291250	he	329	" And you do now , I hope , Mr. Gresham ? "
291345	291404	291409	291410	somebody else	7432	" Well , - yes , - I am not down - hearted . But I confess to a feeling that the world would go on even though we had nothing to say to a single province in North America . But that is for your private ear . You are not to whisper that in Downing Street . "
291499	291518	291520	291521	Miss Fitzgibbon	401	" It 's a very nice thing to be here , but one does get tired of it , "
291523	291527	291529	291529	Phineas	329	" Very tired , "
291531	291579	291529	291529	Phineas	329	" Of course it is a part of your duty , Mr. Finn . You are on your promotion and are bound to be here . When I asked Laurence to come , he said there was nothing to be got till the cards were shuffled again . "
291580	291588	291590	291590	Phineas	329	" They 'll be shuffled very soon , "
291592	291606	291608	291609	the lady	7484	" Whatever colour comes up , you 'll hold trumps , I know , "
291611	291618	291619	291619	He	329	" Some hands always hold trumps . "
291712	291735	291695	291695	She	341	" She is somewhere with Lady Laura , I believe ; and really , Mr. Finn , I do not like it . "
291756	291783	291741	291741	Phineas	329	" Really , I do not like it . I am told that Mr. Kennedy is in the house , and nobody knows what may happen . "
291784	291794	291695	291695	She	341	" Mr. Kennedy is not likely to say anything . "
291795	291840	291695	291695	She	341	" One can not tell . And when I hear that a woman is separated from her husband , I always think that she must have been imprudent . It may be uncharitable , but I think it is most safe so to consider . "
291841	291857	291859	291859	Phineas	329	" As far as I have heard the circumstances , Lady Laura was quite right , "
291861	291899	291859	291859	Phineas	329	" It may be so . Gentlemen will always take the lady 's part , - of course . But I should be very sorry to have a daughter separated from her husband , - very sorry . "
292066	292072	292073	292073	she	351	" Oh , Mr. Finn ! "
292076	292082	292073	292073	she	351	" do you see that ? "
292083	292087	292073	292073	she	351	" See what ? "
292088	292116	292117	292117	Phineas	329	" Look ; There is Mr. Kennedy . We had heard that it was possible , and Laura made me promise that I would not leave her . "
292146	292160	292162	292162	Violet	351	" She is just opposite to him , where he can see her , "
292164	292215	292162	292162	Violet	351	" Pray take me to her . He will think nothing of you , because I know that you are still friends with both of them . I came away because Lord Baldock wanted to introduce me to Lady Mouser . You know he is going to marry Miss Mouser . "
292313	292317	292318	292318	she	344	" Mr. Finn , "
292321	292333	292318	292318	she	344	" could you find Oswald ? I know he is here . "
292334	292339	292341	292341	Phineas	329	" He has gone , "
292343	292351	292318	292318	she	344	" I was speaking to him downstairs . "
292352	292366	292318	292318	she	344	" You have not seen my father ? He said he would come . "
292367	292379	292318	292318	she	344	" I have not seen him , but I will search . "
292380	292408	292318	292318	she	344	" No ; - it will do no good . I can not stay . His carriage is there , I know , - waiting for me . "
292509	292514	292515	292515	he	343	" Is she going ? "
292518	292545	292515	292515	he	343	" Well . Yes . I dare say she may before long . I shall look for Lord Brentford 's carriage by - and - by . "
292546	292591	292652	292652	his	343	" Tell her she need not go because of me . I shall not return . I shall not annoy her here . It would have been much better that a woman in such a plight should not have come to such an assembly . "
292592	292603	292515	292515	he	343	" You would not wish her to shut herself up . "
292604	292647	292652	292652	his	343	" I would wish her to come back to the home that she has left , and , if there be any law in the land , she shall be made to do so . You tell her that I say so . "
292694	292700	292702	292703	Lady Laura	344	" Did he see you ? "
292705	292712	292702	292703	Lady Laura	344	" Yes , he followed me . "
292713	292721	292671	292671	Phineas	329	" And did he speak to you ? "
292722	292731	292702	292703	Lady Laura	344	" Yes ; - he spoke to me . "
292732	292739	292702	292703	Lady Laura	344	" And what did he say ? "
292780	292804	292806	292807	Lady Laura	344	" Whether there be law in the land to protect me or whether there be none , I will never live with him , "
292809	292851	292806	292807	Lady Laura	344	" Is a woman like a head of cattle , that she can be fastened in her crib by force ? I will never live with him though all the judges of the land should decide that I must do so . "
293061	293074	293075	293075	Violet	351	" Of course I think it right that he should do something , "
293079	293088	293090	293091	the Earl	733	" And he will if you bid him , "
293182	293192	293193	293193	he	463	" What is it you would have me do ? "
293196	293207	293193	293193	he	463	" I would have you choose some occupation , Oswald . "
293208	293226	293174	293174	he	463	" What occupation ? What is it that you mean ? Ought I to be a shoemaker ? "
293227	293243	293193	293193	he	463	" Not that by preference , I should say ; but that if you please . "
293279	293297	293271	293271	she	351	" You are talking nonsense , Violet . You know that I can not be a shoemaker . "
293298	293305	293174	293174	he	463	" You may go into Parliament . "
293306	293323	293193	293193	he	463	" I neither can , nor would I if I could . I dislike the life . "
293324	293329	293271	293271	she	351	" You might farm . "
293330	293337	293174	293174	he	463	" I can not afford it . "
293338	293371	293193	293193	he	463	" You might , - might do anything . You ought to do something . You know that you ought . You know that your father is right in what he says . "
293372	293411	293193	293193	he	463	" That is easily asserted , Violet ; but it would , I think , be better that you should take my part than my father 's , if it be that you intend to be my wife . "
293412	293434	293174	293174	he	463	" You know that I intend to be your wife ; but would you wish that I should respect my husband ? "
293435	293447	293448	293448	he	6930	" And will you not do so if you marry me ? "
293549	293554	293555	293555	she	351	" No , Oswald , "
293558	293585	293555	293555	she	351	" If you resolve upon being an idle man , I shall not respect you . It is better that I should tell you the truth . "
293586	293592	293593	293593	he	6930	" A great deal better , "
293596	293613	293593	293593	he	6930	" How can I respect one whose whole life will be , - will be - ? "
293614	293619	293620	293620	he	6930	" Will be what ? "
293627	293637	293620	293620	he	6930	" Oswald , you are very rough with me . "
293638	293649	293593	293593	he	6930	" What do you say that my life will be ? "
293661	293667	293668	293668	she	351	" It will be discreditable , "
293671	293678	293679	293679	he	6930	" It shall not discredit you , "
293682	293709	293679	293679	he	6930	" I will not bring disgrace on one I have loved so well . Violet , after what you have said , we had better part . "
294063	294075	294077	294078	Lady Baldock	341	" Then why have you given him up , my dear ? "
294080	294092	294094	294094	Violet	341	" Because I found that he was too good for me , "
294229	294236	294237	294238	Lady Laura	344	" They will make it up , "
294242	294267	294237	294238	Lady Laura	344	" if you and I do not attempt to make it up for them . If we do , they will never come together . "
294443	294448	294449	294449	she	351	" The truth is , "
294467	294498	294449	294449	she	351	" that though we like each other , - love each other , if you choose to say so , - we are not fit to be man and wife . "
294499	294505	294449	294449	she	351	" And why not fit ? "
294506	294525	294449	294449	she	351	" We are too much alike . Each is too violent , too headstrong , and too masterful . "
294526	294538	294540	294541	Lady Laura	344	" You , as the woman , ought to give way , "
294543	294555	294540	294541	Lady Laura	344	" But we do not always do just what we ought . "
294556	294578	294449	294449	she	351	" I know how difficult it is for me to advise , seeing to what a pass I have brought myself . "
294579	294657	294449	294449	she	351	" Do not say that , dear ; - or rather do say it , for we have , both of us , brought ourselves to what you call a pass , - to such a pass that we are like to be able to live together and discuss it for the rest of our lives . The difference is , I take it , that you have not to accuse yourself , and that I have . "
294658	294671	294673	294674	Lady Laura	344	" I can not say that I have not to accuse myself , "
294676	294706	294673	294674	Lady Laura	344	" I do not know that I have done much wrong to Mr. Kennedy since I married him ; but in marrying him I did him a grievous wrong . "
294707	294714	294449	294449	she	351	" And he has avenged himself . "
294715	294749	294449	294449	she	351	" We will not talk of vengeance . I believe he is wretched , and I know that I am ; - and that has come of the wrong that I have done . "
294750	294758	294760	294760	Violet	351	" I will make no man wretched , "
294762	294775	294760	294760	Violet	351	" Do you mean that your mind is made up against Oswald ? "
294776	294817	294449	294449	she	351	" I mean that , and I mean much more . I say that I will make no man wretched . Your brother is not the only man who is so weak as to be willing to run the hazard . "
294818	294824	294449	294449	she	351	" There is Lord Fawn . "
294825	294853	294760	294760	Violet	351	" Yes , there is Lord Fawn , certainly . Perhaps I should not do him much harm ; but then I should do him no good . "
294854	294860	294449	294449	she	351	" And poor Phineas Finn . "
294861	294921	294449	294449	she	351	" Yes ; - there is Mr. Finn . I will tell you something , Laura . The only man I ever saw in the world whom I have thought for a moment that it was possible that I should like , - like enough to love as my husband , - except your brother , was Mr. Finn . "
294922	294926	294760	294760	Violet	351	" And now ? "
294927	294939	294941	294941	Violet	351	" Oh ; - now ; of course that is over , "
294943	294948	294941	294941	Violet	351	" It is over ? "
294949	295039	294760	294760	Violet	351	" Quite over . Is he not going to marry Madame Goesler ? I suppose all that is fixed by this time . I hope she will be good to him , and gracious , and let him have his own way , and give him his tea comfortably when he comes up tired from the House ; for I confess that my heart is a little tender towards Phineas still . I should not like to think that he had fallen into the hands of a female Philistine . "
295040	295051	294449	294449	she	351	" I do not think he will marry Madame Goesler . "
295052	295056	294760	294760	Violet	351	" Why not ? "
295057	295084	294760	294760	Violet	351	" I can hardly tell you ; - but I do not think he will . And you loved him once , - eh , Violet ? "
295085	295187	294760	294760	Violet	351	" Not quite that , my dear . It has been difficult with me to love . The difficulty with most girls , I fancy , is not to love . Mr. Finn , when I came to measure him in my mind , was not small , but he was never quite tall enough . One feels oneself to be a sort of recruiting sergeant , going about with a standard of inches . Mr. Finn was just half an inch too short . He lacks something in individuality . He is a little too much a friend to everybody . "
295188	295198	294449	294449	she	351	" Shall I tell you a secret , Violet ? "
295199	295216	294760	294760	Violet	351	" If you please , dear ; though I fancy it is one I know already . "
295217	295228	295230	295231	Lady Laura	344	" He is the only man whom I ever loved , "
295233	295246	295248	295248	Violet	351	" But it was too late when you learned to love him , "
295250	295317	295248	295248	Violet	351	" It was too late , when I was so sure of it as to wish that I had never seen Mr. Kennedy . I felt it coming on me , and I argued with myself that such a marriage would be bad for us both . At that moment there was trouble in the family , and I had not a shilling of my own . "
295318	295326	294449	294449	she	351	" You had paid it for Oswald . "
295327	295355	294449	294449	she	351	" At any rate , I had nothing ; - and he had nothing . How could I have dared to think even of such a marriage ? "
295356	295365	295248	295248	Violet	351	" Did he think of it , Laura ? "
295366	295372	294449	294449	she	351	" I suppose he did . "
295373	295386	294449	294449	she	351	" You know he did . Did you not tell me before ? "
295387	295507	294449	294449	she	351	" Well ; - yes . He thought of it . I had come to some foolish , half - sentimental resolution as to friendship , believing that he and I could be knit together by some adhesion of fraternal affection that should be void of offence to my husband ; and in furtherance of this he was asked to Loughlinter when I went there , just after I had accepted Robert . He came down , and I measured him too , as you have done . I measured him , and I found that he wanted nothing to come up to the height required by my standard . I think I knew him better than you did . "
295508	295526	295248	295248	Violet	351	" Very possibly ; - but why measure him at all , when such measurement was useless ? "
295527	295561	294449	294449	she	351	" Can one help such things ? He came to me one day as I was sitting up by the Linter . You remember the place , where it makes its first leap . "
295562	295569	294449	294449	she	351	" I remember it very well . "
295570	295587	294449	294449	she	351	" So do I. Robert had shown it me as the fairest spot in all Scotland . "
295588	295601	295248	295248	Violet	351	" And there this lover of ours sang his song to you ? "
295602	295654	294449	294449	she	351	" I do not know what he told me then ; but I know that I told him that I was engaged ; and I felt when I told him so that my engagement was a sorrow to me . And it has been a sorrow from that day to this . "
295655	295670	294449	294449	she	351	" And the hero , Phineas , - he is still dear to you ? "
295671	295676	294449	294449	she	351	" Dear to me ? "
295677	295704	295248	295248	Violet	351	" Yes . You would have hated me , had he become my husband ? And you will hate Madame Goesler when she becomes his wife ? "
295705	295740	294449	294449	she	351	" Not in the least . I am no dog in the manger . I have even gone so far as almost to wish , at certain moments , that you should accept him . "
295741	295745	294449	294449	she	351	" And why ? "
295746	295755	295248	295248	Violet	351	" Because he has wished it so heartily . "
295756	295768	295770	295770	Violet	351	" One can hardly forgive a man for such speedy changes , "
295772	295833	295248	295248	Violet	351	" Was I not to forgive him ; - I , who had turned myself away from him with a fixed purpose the moment that I found that he had made a mark upon my heart ? I could not wipe off the mark , and yet I married . Was he not to try to wipe off his mark ? "
295834	295896	294449	294449	she	351	" It seems that he wiped it off very quickly ; - and since that he has wiped off another mark . One does n't know how many marks he has wiped off . They are like the inn - keeper 's score which he makes in chalk . A damp cloth brings them all away , and leaves nothing behind . "
295897	295903	294449	294449	she	351	" What would you have ? "
295904	295920	295922	295922	Violet	351	" There should be a little notch on the stick , - to remember by , "
295924	295945	294449	294449	she	351	" Not that I complain , you know . I can not complain , as I was not notched myself . "
295946	295953	294449	294449	she	351	" You are silly , Violet . "
295954	295968	295248	295248	Violet	351	" In not having allowed myself to be notched by this great champion ? "
295969	296099	294449	294449	she	351	" A man like Mr. Finn has his life to deal with , - to make the most of it , and to divide it between work , pleasure , duty , ambition , and the rest of it as best he may . If he have any softness of heart , it will be necessary to him that love should bear a part in all these interests . But a man will be a fool who will allow love to be the master of them all . He will be one whose mind is so ill - balanced as to allow him to be the victim of a single wish . Even in a woman passion such as that is evidence of weakness , and not of strength . "
296100	296113	294449	294449	she	351	" It seems , then , Laura , that you are weak . "
296114	296151	295248	295248	Violet	351	" And if I am , does that condemn him ? He is a man , if I judge him rightly , who will be constant as the sun , when constancy can be of service . "
296152	296164	295248	295248	Violet	351	" You mean that the future Mrs. Finn will be secure ? "
296165	296206	294449	294449	she	351	" That is what I mean ; - and that you or I , had either of us chosen to take his name , might have been quite secure . We have thought it right to refuse to do so . "
296207	296216	295248	295248	Violet	351	" And how many more , I wonder ? "
296217	296268	295248	295248	Violet	351	" You are unjust , and unkind , Violet . So unjust and unkind that it is clear to me he has just gratified your vanity , and has never touched your heart . What would you have had him do , when I told him that I was engaged ? "
296269	296284	294449	294449	she	351	" I suppose that Mr. Kennedy would not have gone to Blankenberg with him . "
296285	296288	295248	295248	Violet	351	" Violet ! "
296289	296313	295248	295248	Violet	351	" That seems to be the proper thing to do . But even that does not adjust things finally ; - does it ? "
296404	296419	296421	296422	Lord Cantrip	552	" My dear Finn , I can only say that I deeply regret it , "
296424	296493	296421	296422	Lord Cantrip	552	" So do I. I regret to leave office , which I like , - and which indeed I want . I regret specially to leave this office , as it has been a thorough pleasure to me ; and I regret , above all , to leave you . But I am convinced that Monk is right , and I find it impossible not to support him . "
296494	296504	296506	296507	Lord Cantrip	552	" I wish that Mr. Monk was at Bath , "
296753	296762	296763	296763	he	329	" It is simply to bid her adieu , "
296768	296777	296763	296763	he	329	" for I shall hardly see her again . "
296919	296928	296929	296929	he	329	" She is the best of them all , "
297291	297304	297306	297307	the girl	2338	" Madame will not refuse to see you , I am thinking , "
297314	297320	297322	297322	Phineas	329	" And she is alone ? "
297324	297343	297311	297312	a German	4797	" Alone ? Yes ; - of course she is alone . Who should be with her now ? "
297368	297375	297377	297378	the girl	2338	" She shall be down directly , "
297380	297394	297377	297378	the girl	2338	" I shall tell her who is here , and she will come . "
297884	297895	297896	297896	she	7484	" I am so sorry to have kept you waiting , "
297906	297926	297896	297896	she	7484	" I was an owl not to be ready for you when you told me that you would come . "
297927	297962	297900	297900	she	7484	" No ; - but a bird of paradise to come to me so sweetly , and at an hour when all the other birds refuse to show the feather of a single wing . "
297963	297988	297900	297900	she	7484	" And you , - you feel like a naughty boy , do you not , in thus coming out on a Sunday morning ? "
297989	297998	297896	297896	she	7484	" Do you feel like a naughty girl ? "
297999	298119	297900	297900	she	7484	" Yes ; - just a little so . I do not know that I should care for everybody to hear that I received visitors , - or worse still , a visitor , - at this hour on this day . But then it is so pleasant to feel oneself to be naughty ! There is a Bohemian flavour of picnic about it which , though it does not come up to the rich gusto of real wickedness , makes one fancy that one is on the border of that delightful region in which there is none of the constraint of custom , - where men and women say what they like , and do what they like . "
298120	298131	298133	298133	Phineas	329	" It is pleasant enough to be on the borders , "
298135	298189	298133	298133	Phineas	329	" That is just it . Of course decency , morality , and propriety , all made to suit the eye of the public , are the things which are really delightful . We all know that , and live accordingly , - as well as we can . I do at least . "
298190	298199	297900	297900	she	7484	" And do not I , Madame Goesler ? "
298200	298279	297900	297900	she	7484	" I know nothing about that , Mr. Finn , and want to ask no questions . But if you do , I am sure you agree with me that you often envy the improper people , - the Bohemians , - the people who do n't trouble themselves about keeping any laws except those for breaking which they would be put into nasty , unpleasant prisons . I envy them . Oh , how I envy them ! "
298280	298288	298133	298133	Phineas	329	" But you are free as air . "
298289	298405	297900	297900	she	7484	" The most cabined , cribbed , and confined creature in the world ! I have been fighting my way up for the last four years , and have not allowed myself the liberty of one flirtation ; - not often even the recreation of a natural laugh . And now I should n't wonder if I do n't find myself falling back a year or two , just because I have allowed you to come and see me on a Sunday morning . When I told Lotta that you were coming , she shook her head at me in dismay . But now that you are here , tell me what you have done . "
298406	298414	297900	297900	she	7484	" Nothing as yet , Madame Goesler . "
298415	298427	298133	298133	Phineas	329	" I thought it was to have been settled on Friday ? "
298428	298498	297900	297900	she	7484	" It was settled , - before Friday . Indeed , as I look back at it all now , I can hardly tell when it was not settled . It is impossible , and has been impossible , that I should do otherwise . I still hold my place , Madame Goesler , but I have declared that I shall give it up before the debate comes on . "
298499	298505	298133	298133	Phineas	329	" It is quite fixed ? "
298506	298513	297900	297900	she	7484	" Quite fixed , my friend . "
298514	298519	297900	297900	she	7484	" And what next ? "
298670	298674	298676	298676	she	7015	" What next ? "
298689	298720	298676	298676	she	7015	" I do not know that there will be any next . As far as public life is concerned , there will be no next for me , Madame Goesler . "
298721	298729	298730	298730	she	7015	" That is out of the question , "
298733	298741	298730	298730	she	7015	" You are made for public life . "
298742	298760	298676	298676	she	7015	" Then I shall be untrue to my making , I fear . But to speak plainly - "
298761	298774	298676	298676	she	7015	" Yes ; speak plainly . I want to understand the reality . "
298775	298810	298730	298730	she	7015	" The reality is this . I shall keep my seat to the end of the session , as I think I may be of use . After that I shall give it up . "
298811	298816	298817	298817	she	7015	" Resign that too ? "
298825	298868	298817	298817	she	7015	" The chances are , I think , that there will be another dissolution . If they hold their own against Mr. Monk 's motion , then they will pass an Irish Reform Bill . After that I think they must dissolve . "
298869	298878	298730	298730	she	7015	" And you will not come forward again ? "
298879	298886	298730	298730	she	7015	" I can not afford it . "
298887	298897	298676	298676	she	7015	" Psha ! Some five hundred pounds or so ! "
298898	298953	298730	298730	she	7015	" And , besides that , I am well aware that my only chance at my old profession is to give up all idea of Parliament . The two things are not compatible for a beginner at the law . I know it now , and have bought my knowledge by a bitter experience . "
298954	298961	298730	298730	she	7015	" And where will you live ? "
298962	298968	298676	298676	she	7015	" In Dublin , probably . "
298969	298980	298730	298730	she	7015	" And you will do , - will do what ? "
298981	299006	298730	298730	she	7015	" Anything honest in a barrister 's way that may be brought to me . I hope that I may never descend below that . "
299007	299029	298676	298676	she	7015	" You will stand up for all the blackguards , and try to make out that the thieves did not steal ? "
299030	299045	298676	298676	she	7015	" It may be that that sort of work may come in my way . "
299046	299059	298730	298730	she	7015	" And you will wear a wig and try to look wise ? "
299060	299072	298676	298676	she	7015	" The wig is not universal in Ireland , Madame Goesler . "
299073	299094	298676	298676	she	7015	" And you will wrangle , as though your very soul were in it , for somebody 's twenty pounds ? "
299095	299098	298676	298676	she	7015	" Exactly . "
299099	299124	298730	298730	she	7015	" You have already made a name in the greatest senate in the world , and have governed other countries larger than your own - "
299125	299141	298676	298676	she	7015	" No ; - I have not done that . I have governed no country . "
299240	299241	299232	299232	I	0	" "
299250	299251	299245	299245	you	0	" "
299293	299420	299290	299290	you	7016	" She paused a moment as though for an answer , and he felt that now had come the time in which it would be well that he should tell her of his engagement with his own Mary . She had received him very playfully ; but now within the last few minutes there had come upon her a seriousness of gesture , and almost a solemnity of tone , which made him conscious that he should in no way trifle with her . She was so earnest in her friendship that he owed it to her to tell her everything . But before he could think of the words in which his tale should be told , she had gone on with her quick questions . "
299430	299434	299290	299290	you	7016	" she said . "
299448	299449	299451	299451	I	0	" "

299487	299552	299553	299553	I	0	" As she said this , - not loudly but with much emphasis , - she came and stood before him where he was sitting . And as he looked at her he could perceive that there was a strength about her of which he had not been aware . She was stronger , larger , more robust physically than he had hitherto conceived . "
299558	299562	299553	299553	I	0	" she said . "
299704	299705	299706	299706	You	0	" "
299714	299719	299706	299706	You	0	" said Phineas hoarsely . "
299739	299740	299734	299734	you	0	" "
299765	299766	299734	299734	you	0	" "

299970	300239	300240	300241	My friend	922	" So saying , she stood before him with her right hand stretched out towards him . What man will say that he would not have been tempted ? Or what woman will declare that such temptation should have had no force ? The very air of the room in which she dwelt was sweet in his nostrils , and there hovered around her an halo of grace and beauty which greeted all his senses . She invited him to join his lot to hers , in order that she might give to him all that was needed to make his life rich and glorious . How would the Ratlers and the Bonteens envy him when they heard of the prize which had become his ! The Cantrips and the Greshams would feel that he was a friend doubly valuable , if he could be won back ; and Mr. Monk would greet him as a fitting ally , - an ally strong with the strength which he had before wanted . With whom would he not be equal ? Whom need he fear ? Who would not praise him ? The story of his poor Mary would be known only in a small village , out beyond the Channel . The temptation certainly was very strong . But he had not a moment in which to doubt . She was standing there with her face turned from him , but with her hand still stretched towards him . Of course he took it . What man so placed could do other than take a woman 's hand ? "
300243	300247	300240	300241	My friend	922	" he said . "
300258	300262	300263	300263	You	0	" she said . "
300291	300323	300289	300289	sir	8579	" He paused a moment , holding her hand , and she let it lie there for an instant while she listened . But still she did not look at him . "
300336	300341	300289	300289	sir	8579	" Still he paused . "
300349	300354	300347	300347	me	0	" she said again . "
300366	300396	300360	300360	you	0	" he said at last . His words did not come louder than a low whisper ; but they were plainly heard , and instantly the hand was withdrawn . "
300401	300405	300417	300418	Madame Goesler	348	" she exclaimed . "
300412	300413	300417	300418	Madame Goesler	348	" "
300420	300421	300422	300422	Sir	8579	" "
300453	301350	300447	300447	I	0	" Then she strode out of the room , and was no more seen of the eyes of Phineas Finn . He never afterwards knew how he escaped out of that room and found his way into Park Lane . In after days he had some memory that he remained there , he knew not how long , standing on the very spot on which she had left him ; and that at last there grew upon him almost a fear of moving , a dread lest he should be heard , an inordinate desire to escape without the sound of a footfall , without the clicking of a lock . Everything in that house had been offered to him . He had refused it all , and then felt that of all human beings under the sun none had so little right to be standing there as he . His very presence in that drawing - room was an insult to the woman whom he had driven from it . But at length he was in the street , and had found his way across Piccadilly into the Green Park . Then , as soon as he could find a spot apart from the Sunday world , he threw himself upon the turf ; and tried to fix his thoughts upon the thing that he had done . His first feeling , I think , was one of pure and unmixed disappointment ; - of disappointment so bitter , that even the vision of his own Mary did not tend to comfort him . How great might have been his success , and how terrible was his failure ! Had he taken the woman 's hand and her money , had he clenched his grasp on the great prize offered to him , his misery would have been ten times worse the first moment that he would have been away from her . Then , indeed , - it being so that he was a man with a heart within his breast , - there would have been no comfort for him , in his outlooks on any side . But even now , when he had done right , - knowing well that he had done right , - he found that comfort did not come readily within his reach . CHAPTER LXXIII Amantium Irae Miss Effingham 's life at this time was not the happiest in the world . Her lines , as she once said to her friend Lady Laura , were not laid for her in pleasant places . Her residence was still with her aunt , and she had come to find that it was almost impossible any longer to endure Lady Baldock , and quite impossible to escape from Lady Baldock . In former days she had had a dream that she might escape , and live alone if she chose to be alone ; that she might be independent in her life , as a man is independent , if she chose to live after that fashion ; that she might take her own fortune in her own hand , as the law certainly allowed her to do , and act with it as she might please . But latterly she had learned to understand that all this was not possible for her . Though one law allowed it , another law disallowed it , and the latter law was at least as powerful as the former . And then her present misery was enhanced by the fact that she was now banished from the second home which she had formerly possessed . Hitherto she had always been able to escape from Lady Baldock to the house of her friend , but now such escape was out of the question . Lady Laura and Lord Chiltern lived in the same house , and Violet could not live with them . Lady Baldock understood all this , and tortured her niece accordingly . It was not premeditated torture . The aunt did not mean to make her niece 's life a burden to her , and , so intending , systematically work upon a principle to that effect . Lady Baldock , no doubt , desired to do her duty conscientiously . But the result was torture to poor Violet , and a strong conviction on the mind of each of the two ladies that the other was the most unreasonable being in the world . The aunt , in these days , had taken it into her head to talk of poor Lord Chiltern . This arose partly from a belief that the quarrel was final , and that , therefore , there would be no danger in aggravating Violet by this expression of pity , - partly from a feeling that it would be better that her niece should marry Lord Chiltern than that she should not marry at all , - and partly , perhaps , from the general principle that , as she thought it right to scold her niece on all occasions , this might be best done by taking an opposite view of all questions to that taken by the niece to be scolded . Violet was supposed to regard Lord Chiltern as having sinned against her , and therefore Lady Baldock talked of "
301355	301400	301403	301403	she	7043	" As to the other lovers , she had begun to perceive that their conditions were hopeless . Her daughter Augusta had explained to her that there was no chance remaining either for Phineas , or for Lord Fawn , or for Mr. Appledom . "
301419	301546	301403	301403	she	7043	" said Lady Baldock . When , therefore , Lady Baldock was told one day that Lord Chiltern was in the house , and was asking to see Miss Effingham , she did not at once faint away , and declare that they would all be murdered , - as she would have done some months since . She was perplexed by a double duty . If it were possible that Violet should relent and be reconciled , then it would be her duty to save Violet from the claws of the wild beast . But if there was no such chance , then it would be her duty to poor Lord Chiltern to see that he was not treated with contumely and ill - humour . "
301555	301562	301566	301566	mamma	1709	" Lady Baldock asked her daughter . "
301568	301569	301566	301566	mamma	1709	" "

301628	301649	301650	301651	Lord Chiltern	463	" It was , however , soon apparent to her that in this matter she was to have no control . "
301657	301667	301650	301651	Lord Chiltern	463	" said Violet , coming into the room abruptly . "

301770	301823	301824	301824	I	0	" said Lady Baldock to her daughter in a despondent tone , as she held up her hands in dismay . In the meantime , Violet had gone down - stairs with a quick step , and had then boldly entered the room in which her lover was waiting to receive her . "
301836	301913	301834	301834	Violet	341	" said Lord Chiltern . There was still in his face something of savagery , - an expression partly of anger and partly of resolution to tame the thing with which he was angry . Violet did not regard the anger half so keenly as she did that resolution of taming . An angry lord , she thought , she could endure , but she could not bear the idea of being tamed by any one . "

CHAPTER LXXIV The Beginning of the End The day of the debate had come , and Phineas Finn was still sitting in his room at the Colonial Office . But his resignation had been sent in and accepted , and he was simply awaiting the coming of his successor . About noon his successor came , and he had the gratification of resigning his arm - chair to Mr. Bonteen . It is generally understood that gentlemen leaving offices give up either seals or a portfolio . Phineas had been put in possession of no seal and no portfolio ; but there was in the room which he had occupied a special arm - chair , and this with much regret he surrendered to the use and comfort of Mr. Bonteen . There was a glance of triumph in his enemy 's eyes , and an exultation in the tone of his enemy 's voice , which were very bitter to him . "
303847	303852	303842	303842	you	7098	" said Mr. Bonteen . "
303882	303883	303878	303878	you	7098	" "
303894	303950	303878	303878	you	7098	" said Phineas , trying to laugh . But Mr. Bonteen did not feel the intended satire , and poor Phineas found it useless to attempt to punish the man he hated . He left him as quickly as he could , and went to say a few words of farewell to his late chief . "
303957	303962	303955	303955	Finn	329	" said Lord Cantrip . "

304152	304185	304144	304144	he	402	" I think , however , that the bee in Mr. Palliser 's bonnet to which Lord Cantrip was alluding made its buzzing audible on some subject that was not exactly political . "
304224	304355	304356	304356	I	0	" This was very kindly said , and Phineas was flattered and comforted . He could not , however , make Lord Cantrip understand the whole truth . For him the dream of a life of politics was over for ever . He had tried it , and had succeeded beyond his utmost hopes ; but , in spite of his success , the ground had crumbled to pieces beneath his feet , and he knew that he could never recover the niche in the world 's gallery which he was now leaving . That same afternoon he met Mr. Gresham in one of the passages leading to the House , and the Prime Minister put his arm through that of our hero as they walked together into the lobby . "

That was the trouble which was crushing his spirit at this moment , and not the loss of his office ! He knew that he could not venture to think of remaining in London as a member of Parliament with no other income than that which his father could allow him , even if he could again secure a seat in Parliament . When he had first been returned for Loughshane he had assured his friends that his duty as a member of the House of Commons would not be a bar to his practice in the Courts . He had now been five years a member , and had never once made an attempt at doing any part of a barrister 's work . He had gone altogether into a different line of life , and had been most successful ; - so successful that men told him , and women more frequently than men , that his career had been a miracle of success . But there had been , as he had well known from the first , this drawback in the new profession which he had chosen , that nothing in it could be permanent . They who succeed in it , may probably succeed again ; but then the success is intermittent , and there may be years of hard work in opposition , to which , unfortunately , no pay is assigned . It is almost imperative , as he now found , that they who devote themselves to such a profession should be men of fortune . When he had commenced his work , - at the period of his first return for Loughshane , - he had had no thought of mending his deficiency in this respect by a rich marriage . Nor had it ever occurred to him that he would seek a marriage for that purpose . Such an idea would have been thoroughly distasteful to him . There had been no stain of premeditated mercenary arrangement upon him at any time . But circumstances had so fallen out with him , that as he won his spurs in Parliament , as he became known , and was placed first in one office and then in another , prospects of love and money together were opened to him , and he ventured on , leaving Mr. Low and the law behind him , - because these prospects were so alluring . Then had come Mr. Monk and Mary Flood Jones , - and everything around him had collapsed . Everything around him had collapsed , - with , however , a terrible temptation to him to inflate his sails again , at the cost of his truth and his honour . The temptation would have affected him not at all , had Madame Goesler been ugly , stupid , or personally disagreeable . But she was , he thought , the most beautiful woman he had ever seen , the most witty , and in many respects the most charming . She had offered to give him everything that she had , so to place him in the world that opposition would be more pleasant to him than office , to supply every want , and had done so in a manner that had gratified all his vanity . But he had refused it all , because he was bound to the girl at Floodborough . My readers will probably say that he was not a true man unless he could do this without a regret . When Phineas thought of it all , there were many regrets . But there was at the same time a resolve on his part , that if any man had ever loved the girl he promised to love , he would love Mary Flood Jones . A thousand times he had told himself that she had not the spirit of Lady Laura , or the bright wit of Violet Effingham , or the beauty of Madame Goesler . But Mary had charms of her own that were more valuable than them all . Was there one among the three who had trusted him as she trusted him , - or loved him with the same satisfied devotion ? There were regrets , regrets that were heavy on his heart ; - for London , and Parliament , and the clubs , and Downing Street , had become dear to him . He liked to think of himself as he rode in the park , and was greeted by all those whose greeting was the most worth having . There were regrets , - sad regrets . But the girl whom he loved better than the parks and the clubs , - better even than Westminster and Downing Street , should never know that they had existed . These thoughts were running through his mind even while he was listening to Mr. Monk , as he propounded his theory of doing justice to Ireland . This might probably be the last great debate in which Phineas would be able to take a part , and he was determined that he would do his best in it . He did not intend to speak on this day , if , as was generally supposed , the House would be adjourned before a division could be obtained . But he would remain on the alert and see how the thing went . He had come to understand the forms of the place , and was as well - trained a young member of Parliament as any there . He had been quick at learning a lesson that is not easily learned , and knew how things were going , and what were the proper moments for this question or that form of motion . He could anticipate a count - out , understood the tone of men 's minds , and could read the gestures of the House . It was very little likely that the debate should be over to - night . He knew that ; and as the present time was the evening of Tuesday , he resolved at once that he would speak as early as he could on the following Thursday . What a pity it was , that with one who had learned so much , all his learning should be in vain ! At about two o'clock , he himself succeeded in moving the adjournment of the debate . This he did from a seat below the gangway , to which he had removed himself from the Treasury bench . Then the House was up , and he walked home with Mr. Monk . Mr. Monk , since he had been told positively by Phineas that he had resolved upon resigning his office , had said nothing more of his sorrow at his friend 's resolve , but had used him as one political friend uses another , telling him all his thoughts and all his hopes as to this new measure of his , and taking counsel with him as to the way in which the fight should be fought . Together they had counted over the list of members , marking these men as supporters , those as opponents , and another set , now more important than either , as being doubtful . From day to day those who had been written down as doubtful were struck off that third list , and put in either the one or the other of those who were either supporters or opponents . And their different modes of argument were settled between these two allied orators , how one should take this line and the other that . To Mr. Monk this was very pleasant . He was quite assured now that opposition was more congenial to his spirit , and more fitting for him than office . There was no doubt to him as to his future sitting in Parliament , let the result of this contest be what it might . The work which he was now doing , was the work for which he had been training himself all his life . While he had been forced to attend Cabinet Councils from week to week , he had been depressed . Now he was exultant . Phineas seeing and understanding all this , said but little to his friend of his own prospects . As long as this pleasant battle was raging , he could fight in it shoulder to shoulder with the man he loved . After that there would be a blank . "
306275	306292	306293	306293	He	393	" said Mr. Monk , as they walked together down Parliament Street through the bright moonlight . "

306741	306913	306914	306914	I	0	" On the Wednesday Phineas was engaged to dine with Mr. Low . There was a dinner party in Bedford Square , and Phineas met half - a - dozen barristers and their wives , - men to whom he had looked up as successful pundits in the law some five or six years ago , but who since that time had almost learned to look up to him . And now they treated him with that courteousness of manner which success in life always begets . There was a judge there who was very civil to him ; and the judge 's wife whom he had taken down to dinner was very gracious to him . The judge had got his prize in life , and was therefore personally indifferent to the fate of ministers ; but the judge 's wife had a brother who wanted a County Court from Lord De Terrier , and it was known that Phineas was giving valuable assistance towards the attainment of this object . "
306926	307016	306918	306918	you	7143	" said the judge 's wife . Phineas , who understood how it came to pass that the judge 's wife should so cordially approve his conduct , could not help thinking how grand a thing it would be for him to have a County Court for himself . When the guests were gone he was left alone with Mr. and Mrs. Low , and remained awhile with them , there having been an understanding that they should have a last chat together over the affairs of our hero . "
307028	307033	307018	307018	you	7143	" asked Mrs. Low . "

307173	307194	307160	307161	the drudgery	7146	" said the barrister , who had gone through it all , and was now reaping the fruits of it . "
307206	307207	307198	307198	you	7143	" "
307258	307259	307261	307261	you	7143	" "
307264	307278	307261	307261	you	7143	" said Mrs. Low , - who knew his age to a day . "

307317	307429	307306	307306	he	329	" said Mr. Low . Neither the lawyer nor his wife repeated any of those sententious admonitions , which had almost become rebukes , and which had been so common in their mouths . The fall with which they had threatened Phineas Finn had come upon him , and they were too generous to remind him of their wisdom and sagacity . Indeed , when he got up to take his leave , Mrs. Low , who probably might not see him again for years , was quite affectionate in her manners to him , and looked as if she were almost minded to kiss him as she pressed his hand . "
307437	307441	307430	307430	We	7147	" she said , "
307452	307453	307454	307454	We	7147	" "

307484	307551	307475	307475	He	7148	" And so they parted . CHAPTER LXXV P. P. C. On the Thursday morning before Phineas went to Mr. Monk , a gentleman called upon him at his lodgings . Phineas requested the servant to bring up the gentleman 's name , but tempted perhaps by a shilling the girl brought up the gentleman instead . It was Mr. Quintus Slide from the office of the "
307557	307558	307554	307555	the People	731	" "
307562	307571	307559	307560	Mr. Finn	329	" said Quintus , with his hand extended , "
307583	307663	307664	307664	I	0	" Phineas certainly desired no such calumet . But to refuse a man 's hand is to declare active war after a fashion which men do not like to adopt except on deliberation . He had never cared a straw for the abuse which Mr. Slide had poured upon him , and now he gave his hand to the man of letters . But he did not sit down , nor did he offer a seat to Mr. Slide . "
307685	307690	307691	307691	I	0	" continued Mr. Slide . "
307707	307711	307714	307715	Mr. Finn	329	" said Phineas . "

307897	307898	307894	307895	Mr. Slide	345	" "

308103	308129	308092	308092	you	329	" It was now becoming very disagreeable , and Phineas was beginning to perceive that it would soon be his turn to say something rough . "
308189	308190	308191	308192	Mr. Slide	345	" "
308194	308204	308191	308192	Mr. Slide	345	" said Phineas , - and then he paused . "
308225	308226	308227	308227	We	7157	" "
308261	308262	308247	308247	you	329	" "

308362	308383	308352	308352	I	0	" And Phineas walked over at him as though he were going to pitch him instantly out of the window . "
308417	308431	308435	308435	sir	8579	" Then he opened the door and stood with it in his hand . "
308445	308446	308437	308437	I	0	" "
308496	308497	308500	308500	sir	8579	" "
308502	308507	308500	308500	sir	8579	" said Quintus Slide . "
308543	309603	308500	308500	sir	8579	" But he resisted the temptation and walked down the stairs , concocting his article as he went . Mr. Quintus Slide did not so much impede the business of his day but what Phineas was with Mr. Monk by two , and in his place in the House when prayers were read at four . As he sat in his place , conscious of the work that was before him , listening to the presentation of petitions , and to the formal reading of certain notices of motions , which with the asking of sundry questions occupied over half an hour , he looked back and remembered accurately his own feelings on a certain night on which he had intended to get up and address the House . The ordeal before him had then been so terrible , that it had almost obliterated for the moment his senses of hearing and of sight . He had hardly been able to perceive what had been going on around him , and had vainly endeavoured to occupy himself in recalling to his memory the words which he wished to pronounce . When the time for pronouncing them had come , he had found himself unable to stand upon his legs . He smiled as he recalled all this in his memory , waiting impatiently for the moment in which he might rise . His audience was assured to him now , and he did not fear it . His opportunity for utterance was his own , and even the Speaker could not deprive him of it . During these minutes he thought not at all of the words that he was to say . He had prepared his matter but had prepared no words . He knew that words would come readily enough to him , and that he had learned the task of turning his thoughts quickly into language while standing with a crowd of listeners around him , - as a practised writer does when seated in his chair . There was no violent beating at his heart now , no dimness of the eyes , no feeling that the ground was turning round under his feet . If only those weary vain questions would get themselves all asked , so that he might rise and begin the work of the night . Then there came the last thought as the House was hushed for his rising . What was the good of it all , when he would never have an opportunity of speaking there again ? But not on that account would he be slack in his endeavour now . He would be listened to once at least , not as a subaltern of the Government but as the owner of a voice prominent in opposition to the Government . He had been taught by Mr. Monk that that was the one place in the House in which a man with a power of speaking could really enjoy pleasure without alloy . He would make the trial , - once , if never again . Things had so gone with him that the rostrum was his own , and a House crammed to overflowing was there to listen to him . He had given up his place in order that he might be able to speak his mind , and had become aware that many intended to listen to him while he spoke . He had observed that the rows of strangers were thick in the galleries , that peers were standing in the passages , and that over the reporter 's head , the ribbons of many ladies were to be seen through the bars of their cage . Yes ; - for this once he would have an audience . He spoke for about an hour , and while he was speaking he knew nothing about himself , whether he was doing it well or ill . Something of himself he did say soon after he had commenced , - not quite beginning with it , as though his mind had been laden with the matter . He had , he said , found himself compelled to renounce his happy allegiance to the First Lord of the Treasury , and to quit the pleasant company in which , humble as had been his place , he had been allowed to sit and act , by his unfortunate conviction in this great subject . He had been told , he said , that it was a misfortune in itself for one so young as he to have convictions . But his Irish birth and Irish connection had brought this misfortune of his country so closely home to him that he had found the task of extricating himself from it to be impossible . Of what further he said , speaking on that terribly unintelligible subject , a tenant - right proposed for Irish farmers , no English reader will desire to know much . Irish subjects in the House of Commons are interesting or are dull , are debated before a crowded audience composed of all who are leaders in the great world of London , or before empty benches , in accordance with the importance of the moment and the character of the debate . For us now it is enough to know that to our hero was accorded that attention which orators love , - which will almost make an orator if it can be assured . A full House with a promise of big type on the next morning would wake to eloquence the propounder of a Canadian grievance , or the mover of an Indian budget . Phineas did not stir out of the House till the division was over , having agreed with Mr. Monk that they two would remain through it all and hear everything that was to be said . Mr. Gresham had already spoken , and to Mr. Palliser was confided the task of winding up the argument for the Government . Mr. Robson spoke also , greatly enlivening the tedium of the evening , and to Mr. Monk was permitted the privilege of a final reply . At two o'clock the division came , and the Ministry were beaten by a majority of twenty - three . "
309607	309620	308500	308500	sir	8579	" said Mr. Monk , as he again walked home with Phineas , "
309639	309640	309635	309635	we	7170	" "
309648	309649	309642	309642	we	7170	" "

309795	309799	309837	309838	revolutionary demagogues	7175	" said Phineas , "

309822	309828	310109	310109	I	0	" said Mr. Monk , - "
309864	310104	310109	310109	I	0	" Two days after this Mr. Gresham declared his intention of dissolving the House because of the adverse division which had been produced by Mr. Monk 's motion , but expressed a wish to be allowed to carry an Irish Reform Bill through Parliament before he did so . He explained how expedient this would be , but declared at the same time that if any strong opposition were made , he would abandon the project . His intention simply was to pass with regard to Ireland a measure which must be passed soon , and which ought to be passed before a new election took place . The bill was ready , and should be read for the first time on the next night , if the House were willing . The House was willing , though there were very many recalcitrant Irish members . The Irish members made loud opposition , and then twitted Mr. Gresham with his promise that he would not go on with his bill , if opposition were made . But , nevertheless , he did go on , and the measure was hurried through the two Houses in a week . Our hero who still sat for Loughshane , but who was never to sit for Loughshane again , gave what assistance he could to the Government , and voted for the measure which deprived Loughshane for ever of its parliamentary honours . "
310114	310128	310109	310109	I	0	" said Lord Tulla , when he discussed the subject with his agent . "
310148	310244	310245	310245	I	0	" It never occurred to Lord Tulla that a member of Parliament might feel himself obliged to vote on such a subject in accordance with his judgment . This Irish Reform Bill was scrambled through the two Houses , and then the session was over . The session was over , and they who knew anything of the private concerns of Mr. Phineas Finn were aware that he was about to return to Ireland , and did not intend to reappear on the scene which had known him so well for the last five years . "

310495	310694	310704	310704	you	329	" To the very last , however , Mr. Monk continued to express his opinion that Phineas would come back , declaring that he had known no instance of a young man who had made himself useful in Parliament , and then had been allowed to leave it in early life . Among those of whom he was bound to take a special leave , the members of the family of Lord Brentford were , of course , the foremost . He had already heard of the reconciliation of Miss Effingham and Lord Chiltern , and was anxious to offer his congratulation to both of them . And it was essential to him that he should see Lady Laura . To her he wrote a line , saying how much he hoped that he should be able to bid her adieu , and a time was fixed for his coming at which she knew that she would meet him alone . But , as chance ruled it , he came upon the two lovers together , and then remembered that he had hardly ever before been in the same room with both of them at the same time . "

311071	311109	311110	311110	I	0	" Then Phineas had to explain that he had come to bid them farewell , and that it was not at all probable that he should ever be able to see Willingford again in the hunting season . "

311370	311454	311455	311455	She	7199	" Even this , however , was impossible . He must go on Sunday , and must return no more . Then he made his little farewell speech , which he could not deliver without some awkward stuttering . He would think of her on the day of her marriage , and pray that she might be happy . And he would send her a little trifle before he went , which he hoped she would wear in remembrance of their old friendship . "
311472	311476	311465	311465	I	0	" said Chiltern . "
311485	311489	311492	311492	I	0	" said Violet . "
311523	311543	311544	311544	He	7201	" Then Phineas left the room , with his throat so full that he could not speak another word . "
311553	311568	311544	311544	He	7201	" said the favoured lover as soon as his rival had left the room . "
311574	311578	311579	311579	He	7201	" said Violet . "
311615	311797	311607	311609	that German woman	7203	" It must be understood , however , that Phineas had never spoken a word to any one as to the offer which the German woman had made to him . It was on the morning of the Sunday on which he was to leave London that he saw Lady Laura . He had asked that it might be so , in order that he might then have nothing more upon his mind . He found her quite alone , and he could see by her eyes that she had been weeping . As he looked at her , remembering that it was not yet six years since he had first been allowed to enter that room , he could not but perceive how very much she was altered in appearance . Then she had been three - and - twenty , and had not looked to be a day older . Now she might have been taken to be nearly forty , so much had her troubles preyed upon her spirit , and eaten into the vitality of her youth . "
311808	311820	311799	311799	you	7204	" she said , smiling as she rose to meet him . "

311863	311891	311893	311893	you	7204	" Then she paused ; but he was silent , sitting with his hat dangling in his two hands , and his eyes fixed upon the floor . "
311899	311903	311893	311893	you	7204	" she continued , "
311915	311916	311911	311911	myself	0	" "

312076	312313	312314	312314	You	7208	" Then again he was silent . She did not know what it was that she wanted , but she did desire some expression from his lips that should be warmer than an expression of gratitude . An expression of love , - of existing love , - she would have felt to be an insult , and would have treated it as such . Indeed , she knew that from him no such insult could come . But she was in that morbid , melancholy state of mind which requires the excitement of more than ordinary sympathy , even though that sympathy be all painful ; and I think that she would have been pleased had he referred to the passion for herself which he had once expressed . If he would have spoken of his love , and of her mistake , and have made some half - suggestion as to what might have been their lives had things gone differently , - though she would have rebuked him even for that , - still it would have comforted her . But at this moment , though he remembered much that had passed between them , he was not even thinking of the Braes of Linter . All that had taken place four years ago ; - and there had been so many other things since which had moved him even more than that ! "
312324	312330	312318	312318	I	0	" she said at last . "
312343	312344	312348	312348	he	1238	" "

312542	312548	312533	312533	I	0	" said Phineas , laughing . "

312639	312643	312609	312609	she	1381	" said Phineas . "
312652	312659	312660	312660	I	0	" Then there was another pause . "
312673	312682	312683	312683	You	329	" she said in her very lowest voice . "
312693	312694	312683	312683	You	329	" "
312705	312706	312702	312703	Madame Goesler	348	" "

312799	312937	312789	312789	people	1124	" said Phineas . Then he got up and took his leave of her . He also wanted to part from her with some special expression of affection , but he did not know how to choose his words . He had wished that some allusion should be made , not to the Braes of Linter , but to the close confidence which had so long existed between them ; but he found that the language to do this properly was wanting to him . Had the opportunity arisen he would have told her now the whole story of Mary Flood Jones ; but the opportunity did not come , and he left her , never having mentioned the name of his Mary or having hinted at his engagement to any one of his friends in London . "
312943	312949	312950	312950	My	0	" he said to himself . "
312975	313427	313431	313432	Mr. Finn	329	" He was to dine at his lodgings , and then leave them for good at eight o'clock . He had packed up everything before he went to Portman Square , and he returned home only just in time to sit down to his solitary mutton chop . But as he sat down he saw a small note addressed to himself lying on the table among the crowd of books , letters , and papers , of which he had still to make disposal . It was a very small note in an envelope of a peculiar tint of pink , and he knew the handwriting well . The blood mounted all over his face as he took it up , and he hesitated for a moment before he opened it . It could not be that the offer should be repeated to him . Slowly , hardly venturing at first to look at the enclosure , he opened it , and the words which it contained were as follows : - I learn that you are going to - day , and I write a word which you will receive just as you are departing . It is to say merely this , - that when I left you the other day I was angry , not with you , but with myself . Let me wish you all good wishes and that prosperity which I know you will deserve , and which I think you will win . Yours very truly , M. M. G. Sunday morning . Should he put off his journey and go to her this very evening and claim her as his friend ? The question was asked and answered in a moment . Of course he would not go to her . Were he to do so there would be only one possible word for him to say , and that word should certainly never be spoken . But he wrote to her a reply , shorter even than her own short note . Thanks , dear friend . I do not doubt but that you and I understand each other thoroughly , and that each trusts the other for good wishes and honest intentions . Always yours , P. F. I write these as I am starting . When he had written this , he kept it till the last moment in his hand , thinking that he would not send it . But as he slipped into the cab , he gave the note to his late landlady to post . At the station Bunce came to him to say a word of farewell , and Mrs. Bunce was on his arm . "
313437	313441	313431	313432	Mr. Finn	329	" said Bunce . "
313453	313454	313455	313455	You	7227	" "
313471	313475	313468	313468	I	0	" said Phineas . "
313543	313544	313533	313533	he	346	" "
313552	313564	313549	313550	Mr. Finn	329	" said Mrs. Bunce with her handkerchief up to her eyes . "
313589	314065	313584	313584	I	0	" Then they shook hands with him through the window , and the train was off . CHAPTER LXXVI Conclusion We are told that it is a bitter moment with the Lord Mayor when he leaves the Mansion House and becomes once more Alderman Jones , of No . 75 , Bucklersbury . Lord Chancellors going out of office have a great fall though they take pensions with them for their consolation . And the President of the United States when he leaves the glory of the White House and once more becomes a simple citizen must feel the change severely . But our hero , Phineas Finn , as he turned his back upon the scene of his many successes , and prepared himself for permanent residence in his own country , was , I think , in a worse plight than any of the reduced divinities to whom I have alluded . They at any rate had known that their fall would come . He , like Icarus , had flown up towards the sun , hoping that his wings of wax would bear him steadily aloft among the gods . Seeing that his wings were wings of wax , we must acknowledge that they were very good . But the celestial lights had been too strong for them , and now , having lived for five years with lords and countesses , with Ministers and orators , with beautiful women and men of fashion , he must start again in a little lodging in Dublin , and hope that the attorneys of that litigious city might be good to him . On his journey home he made but one resolution . He would make the change , or attempt to make it , with manly strength . During his last month in London he had allowed himself to be sad , depressed , and melancholy . There should be an end of all that now . Nobody at home should see that he was depressed . And Mary , his own Mary , should at any rate have no cause to think that her love and his own engagement had ever been the cause to him of depression . Did he not value her love more than anything in the world ? A thousand times he told himself that he did . She was there in the old house at Killaloe to greet him . Her engagement was an affair known to all the county , and she had no idea that it would become her to be coy in her love . She was in his arms before he had spoken to his father and mother , and had made her little speech to him , - very inaudibly indeed , - while he was covering her sweet face with kisses . "
314095	314416	314090	314090	you	329	" Again he covered her face with kisses . Could he ever have had such satisfaction as this had he allowed Madame Goesler 's hand to remain in his ? On the first night of his arrival he sat for an hour downstairs with his father talking over his plans . He felt , - he could not but feel , - that he was not the hero now that he had been when he was last at Killaloe , - when he had come thither with a Cabinet Minister under his wing . And yet his father did his best to prevent the growth of any such feeling . The old doctor was not quite as well off as he had been when Phineas first started with his high hopes for London . Since that day he had abandoned his profession and was now living on the fruits of his life 's labour . For the last two years he had been absolved from the necessity of providing an income for his son , and had probably allowed himself to feel that no such demand upon him would again be made . Now , however , it was necessary that he should do so . Could his son manage to live on two hundred a - year ? There would then be four hundred a - year left for the wants of the family at home . Phineas swore that he could fight his battle on a hundred and fifty , and they ended the argument by splitting the difference . He had been paying exactly the same sum of money for the rooms he had just left in London ; but then , while he held those rooms , his income had been two thousand a - year . Tenant - right was a very fine thing , but could it be worth such a fall as this ? "
314422	314427	314419	314420	dear Mary	382	" said the father . "
314437	314441	314428	314428	I	0	" said Phineas . "
314467	314468	314456	314458	Mrs. Flood Jones	379	" "

314538	314569	314570	314570	I	0	" Then Phineas bethought himself that he was not even yet so low in the world that he need submit himself to terms dictated to him by Mrs. Flood Jones . "
314582	314583	314574	314574	you	382	" "
314589	314590	314587	314587	Phineas	329	" "

314630	314635	314624	314624	I	0	" said the doctor . "
314681	315019	315023	315023	he	7239	" The decision to which Phineas had come on this matter was probably made known to Mrs. Flood Jones after some mild fashion by old Mrs. Finn . Nothing more was said to Phineas about a joint household ; but he was quite able to perceive from the manner of the lady towards him that his proposed mother - in - law wished him to understand that he was treating her daughter very badly . What did it signify ? None of them knew the story of Madame Goesler , and of course none of them would know it . None of them would ever hear how well he had behaved to his little Mary . But Mary did know it all before he left her to go up to Dublin . The two lovers allowed themselves , - or were allowed by their elders , one week of exquisite bliss together ; and during this week , Phineas told her , I think , everything . He told her everything as far as he could do so without seeming to boast of his own successes . How is a man not to tell such tales when he has on his arm , close to him , a girl who tells him her little everything of life , and only asks for his confidence in return ? And then his secrets are so precious to her and so sacred , that he feels as sure of her fidelity as though she were a very goddess of faith and trust . And the temptation to tell is so great . For all that he has to tell she loves him the better and still the better . A man desires to win a virgin heart , and is happy to know , - or at least to believe , - that he has won it . With a woman every former rival is an added victim to the wheels of the triumphant chariot in which she is sitting . "
315052	315139	315037	315037	he	7239	" And so Mary was taught to believe of Laura and of Violet and of Madame Goesler , - that though they had had charms to please , her lover had never been so charmed as he was now while she was hanging to his breast . And I think that she was right in her belief . During those lovely summer evening walks along the shores of Lough Derg , Phineas was as happy as he had ever been at any moment of his life . "
315149	315159	315140	315140	I	0	" she said to him on the last evening . "

315457	316250	315452	315452	me	0	" Had he done right ? How could there be a doubt about it ? How could there be a question about it ? Which of them had loved him , or was capable of loving him as Mary loved him ? What girl was ever so sweet , so gracious , so angelic , as his own Mary ? He swore to her that he was prouder of winning her than of anything he had ever done in all his life , and that of all the treasures that had ever come in his way she was the most precious . She went to bed that night the happiest girl in all Connaught , although when she parted from him she understood that she was not to see him again till Christmas - Eve . But she did see him again before the summer was over , and the manner of their meeting was in this wise . Immediately after the passing of that scrambled Irish Reform Bill , Parliament , as the reader knows , was dissolved . This was in the early days of June , and before the end of July the new members were again assembled at Westminster . This session , late in summer , was very terrible ; but it was not very long , and then it was essentially necessary . There was something of the year 's business which must yet be done , and the country would require to know who were to be the Ministers of the Government . It is not needed that the reader should be troubled any further with the strategy of one political leader or of another , or that more should be said of Mr. Monk and his tenant - right . The House of Commons had offended Mr. Gresham by voting in a majority against him , and Mr. Gresham had punished the House of Commons by subjecting it to the expense and nuisance of a new election . All this is constitutional , and rational enough to Englishmen , though it may be unintelligible to strangers . The upshot on the present occasion was that the Ministers remained in their places and that Mr. Monk 's bill , though it had received the substantial honour of a second reading , passed away for the present into the limbo of abortive legislation . All this would not concern us at all , nor our poor hero much , were it not that the great men with whom he had been for two years so pleasant a colleague , remembered him with something of affectionate regret . Whether it began with Mr. Gresham or with Lord Cantrip , I will not say ; - or whether Mr. Monk , though now a political enemy , may have said a word that brought about the good deed . Be that as it may , just before the summer session was brought to a close Phineas received the following letter from Lord Cantrip : - Downing Street , August 4 , 186 - . MY DEAR MR . FINN , - Mr. Gresham has been talking to me , and we both think that possibly a permanent Government appointment may be acceptable to you . We have no doubt , that should this be the case , your services would be very valuable to the country . There is a vacancy for a poor - law inspector at present in Ireland , whose residence I believe should be in Cork . The salary is a thousand a - year . Should the appointment suit you , Mr. Gresham will be most happy to nominate you to the office . Let me have a line at your early convenience . Believe me , Most sincerely yours , CANTRIP . He received the letter one morning in Dublin , and within three hours he was on his route to Killaloe . Of course he would accept the appointment , but he would not even do that without telling Mary of his new prospect . Of course he would accept the appointment . Though he had been as yet barely two months in Dublin , though he had hardly been long enough settled to his work to have hoped to be able to see in which way there might be a vista open leading to success , still he had fancied that he had seen that success was impossible . He did not know how to begin , - and men were afraid of him , thinking that he was unsteady , arrogant , and prone to failure . He had not seen his way to the possibility of a guinea . "
316257	316276	315452	315452	me	0	" said Mary Flood Jones , opening her eyes wide with wonder at the golden future before them . "
