But there 's another thing about him that 's rather funny . Do you know that he has the one collection of Japanese lacquer in Europe ? Have you ever seen his books ? All Greek poets and mediæval French and that sort of thing . Have you ever been in his rooms ? It 's like being inside an amethyst . And he moves about in all that and talks like -- like a turnip . "

4207	4318	4205	4205	Barker	247	" But if you asked me for my opinion , I should say he was a man with a taste for nonsense , as they call it -- artistic fooling , and all that kind of thing . And I seriously believe that he has talked nonsense so much that he has half bewildered his own mind and does n't know the difference between sanity and insanity . He has gone round the mental world , so to speak , and found the place where the East and the West are one , and extreme idiocy is as good as sense . But I ca n't explain these psychological games .

6190	6205	6174	6174	Barker	247	" perhaps it would be rude of me to ask why you did that ? "
6206	6212	6214	6215	the guest	616	" Did what , Señor ? "
6230	6233	6235	6236	the Englishman	606	" Well , "

6261	6269	6271	6272	the other	618	" To tell you that , Señor , "
6280	6299	6271	6272	the other	618	" involves merely telling you who I am . I am Juan del Fuego , President of Nicaragua . "
6343	6349	6350	6350	he	247	" And the yellow paper , "
6357	6363	6350	6350	he	247	" and the red rag .... "
6364	6373	6375	6375	Fuego	231	" The yellow paper and the red rag , "
6381	6388	6375	6375	Fuego	231	" are the colours of Nicaragua . "
6389	6393	6395	6395	Barker	247	" But Nicaragua ... "
6401	6408	6395	6395	Barker	247	" Nicaragua is no longer a .... "
6409	6424	6426	6428	the old man	620	" Nicaragua has been conquered like Athens . Nicaragua has been annexed like Jerusalem , "
6434	6466	6426	6428	the old man	620	" The Yankee and the German and the brute powers of modernity have trampled it with the hoofs of oxen . But Nicaragua is not dead . Nicaragua is an idea . "
6472	6477	6467	6468	Auberon Quin	227	" A brilliant idea . "
6478	6481	6483	6484	the foreigner	609	" Yes , "
6491	6709	6483	6484	the foreigner	609	" You are right , generous Englishman . An idea _ brillant _ , a burning thought . Señor , you asked me why , in my desire to see the colours of my country , I snatched at paper and blood . Can you not understand the ancient sanctity of colours ? The Church has her symbolic colours . And think of what colours mean to us -- think of the position of one like myself , who can see nothing but those two colours , nothing but the red and the yellow . To me all shapes are equal , all common and noble things are in a democracy of combination . Wherever there is a field of marigolds and the red cloak of an old woman , there is Nicaragua . Wherever there is a field of poppies and a yellow patch of sand , there is Nicaragua . Wherever there is a lemon and a red sunset , there is my country . Wherever I see a red pillar - box and a yellow sunset , there my heart beats . Blood and a splash of mustard can be my heraldry . If there be yellow mud and red mud in the same ditch , it is better to me than white stars . "
6710	6714	6716	6716	Quin	227	" And if , "
6722	6768	6716	6716	Quin	227	" there should happen to be yellow wine and red wine at the same lunch , you could not confine yourself to sherry . Let me order some Burgundy , and complete , as it were , a sort of Nicaraguan heraldry in your inside . "
6796	6804	6805	6805	he	247	" I am to understand , then , "
6814	6847	6805	6805	he	247	" that you , ahem , were the President of Nicaragua when it made its -- er -- one must , of course , agree -- its quite heroic resistance to -- er-- "
6858	6868	6869	6869	he	247	" You need not hesitate in speaking to me , "
6872	6924	6869	6869	he	247	" I 'm quite fully aware that the whole tendency of the world of to - day is against Nicaragua and against me . I shall not consider it any diminution of your evident courtesy if you say what you think of the misfortunes that have laid my republic in ruins . "
6932	6940	6941	6941	he	247	" You are most generous , President , "
6951	6984	6941	6941	he	247	" and I will take advantage of your generosity to express the doubts which , I must confess , we moderns have about such things as -- er -- the Nicaraguan independence . "
6985	6991	6993	6994	Del Fuego	234	" So your sympathies are , "
6999	7005	6993	6994	Del Fuego	234	" with the big nation which-- "
7006	7015	7017	7017	Barker	247	" Pardon me , pardon me , President , "
7021	7161	7017	7017	Barker	247	" my sympathies are with no nation . You misunderstand , I think , the modern intellect . We do not disapprove of the fire and extravagance of such commonwealths as yours only to become more extravagant on a larger scale . We do not condemn Nicaragua because we think Britain ought to be more Nicaraguan . We do not discourage small nationalities because we wish large nationalities to have all their smallness , all their uniformity of outlook , all their exaggeration of spirit . If I differ with the greatest respect from your Nicaraguan enthusiasm , it is not because a nation or ten nations were against you ; it is because civilisation was against you . We moderns believe in a great cosmopolitan civilisation , one which shall include all the talents of all the absorbed peoples-- "
7162	7169	7171	7172	the President	624	" The Señor will forgive me , "
7174	7192	7171	7172	the President	624	" May I ask the Señor how , under ordinary circumstances , he catches a wild horse ? "
7193	7201	7203	7203	Barker	247	" I never catch a wild horse , "
7208	7211	7213	7214	the other	618	" Precisely , "
7216	7435	7213	7214	the other	618	" and there ends your absorption of the talents . That is what I complain of your cosmopolitanism . When you say you want all peoples to unite , you really mean that you want all peoples to unite to learn the tricks of your people . If the Bedouin Arab does not know how to read , some English missionary or schoolmaster must be sent to teach him to read , but no one ever says , ' This schoolmaster does not know how to ride on a camel ; let us pay a Bedouin to teach him . ' You say your civilisation will include all talents . Will it ? Do you really mean to say that at the moment when the Esquimaux has learnt to vote for a County Council , you will have learnt to spear a walrus ? I recur to the example I gave . In Nicaragua we had a way of catching wild horses -- by lassooing the fore feet -- which was supposed to be the best in South America . If you are going to include all the talents , go and do it . If not , permit me to say what I have always said , that something went from the world when Nicaragua was civilised . "
7436	7441	7443	7443	Barker	247	" Something , perhaps , "
7445	7489	7443	7443	Barker	247	" but that something a mere barbarian dexterity . I do not know that I could chip flints as well as a primeval man , but I know that civilisation can make these knives which are better , and I trust to civilisation . "
7490	7496	7498	7499	the Nicaraguan	237	" You have good authority , "
7501	7554	7498	7499	the Nicaraguan	237	" Many clever men like you have trusted to civilisation . Many clever Babylonians , many clever Egyptians , many clever men at the end of Rome . Can you tell me , in a world that is flagrant with the failures of civilisation , what there is particularly immortal about yours ? "
7555	7570	7572	7572	Barker	247	" I think you do not quite understand , President , what ours is , "
7574	7603	7572	7572	Barker	247	" You judge it rather as if England was still a poor and pugnacious island ; you have been long out of Europe . Many things have happened . "
7604	7608	7610	7611	the other	618	" And what , "
7613	7623	7610	7611	the other	618	" would you call the summary of those things ? "
7624	7631	7633	7633	Barker	247	" The summary of those things , "
7639	7749	7633	7633	Barker	247	" is that we are rid of the superstitions , and in becoming so we have not merely become rid of the superstitions which have been most frequently and most enthusiastically so described . The superstition of big nationalities is bad , but the superstition of small nationalities is worse . The superstition of reverencing our own country is bad , but the superstition of reverencing other people 's countries is worse . It is so everywhere , and in a hundred ways . The superstition of monarchy is bad , and the superstition of aristocracy is bad , but the superstition of democracy is the worst of all . "
7760	7766	7767	7767	he	627	" Are you , then , "
7770	7778	7767	7767	he	627	" no longer a democracy in England ? "
7782	7788	7789	7789	he	247	" The situation invites paradox , "
7792	8152	7789	7789	he	247	" We are , in a sense , the purest democracy . We have become a despotism . Have you not noticed how continually in history democracy becomes despotism ? People call it the decay of democracy . It is simply its fulfilment . Why take the trouble to number and register and enfranchise all the innumerable John Robinsons , when you can take one John Robinson with the same intellect or lack of intellect as all the rest , and have done with it ? The old idealistic republicans used to found democracy on the idea that all men were equally intelligent . Believe me , the sane and enduring democracy is founded on the fact that all men are equally idiotic . Why should we not choose out of them one as much as another . All that we want for Government is a man not criminal and insane , who can rapidly look over some petitions and sign some proclamations . To think what time was wasted in arguing about the House of Lords , Tories saying it ought to be preserved because it was clever , and Radicals saying it ought to be destroyed because it was stupid , and all the time no one saw that it was right because it was stupid , because that chance mob of ordinary men thrown there by accident of blood , were a great democratic protest against the Lower House , against the eternal insolence of the aristocracy of talents . We have established now in England , the thing towards which all systems have dimly groped , the dull popular despotism without illusions . We want one man at the head of our State , not because he is brilliant or virtuous , but because he is one man and not a chattering crowd . To avoid the possible chance of hereditary diseases or such things , we have abandoned hereditary monarchy . The King of England is chosen like a juryman upon an official rotation list . Beyond that the whole system is quietly despotic , and we have not found it raise a murmur . "
8153	8159	8161	8162	the President	624	" Do you really mean , "
8166	8193	8161	8162	the President	624	" that you choose any ordinary man that comes to hand and make him despot -- that you trust to the chance of some alphabetical list .... "
8194	8199	8201	8201	Barker	247	" And why not ? "
8203	8312	8201	8201	Barker	247	" Did not half the historical nations trust to the chance of the eldest sons of eldest sons , and did not half of them get on tolerably well ? To have a perfect system is impossible ; to have a system is indispensable . All hereditary monarchies were a matter of luck : so are alphabetical monarchies . Can you find a deep philosophical meaning in the difference between the Stuarts and the Hanoverians ? Believe me , I will undertake to find a deep philosophical meaning in the contrast between the dark tragedy of the A 's , and the solid success of the B 's . "
8313	8319	8321	8322	the other	618	" And you risk it ? "
8324	8339	8321	8322	the other	618	" Though the man may be a tyrant or a cynic or a criminal . "
8340	8345	8347	8347	Barker	247	" We risk it , "
8354	8431	8347	8347	Barker	247	" Suppose he is a tyrant -- he is still a check on a hundred tyrants . Suppose he is a cynic , it is to his interest to govern well . Suppose he is a criminal -- by removing poverty and substituting power , we put a check on his criminality . In short , by substituting despotism we have put a total check on one criminal and a partial check on all the rest . "
8446	8452	8453	8453	he	630	" My church , sir , "
8456	8507	8453	8453	he	630	" has taught me to respect faith . I do not wish to speak with any disrespect of yours , however fantastic . But do you really mean that you will trust to the ordinary man , the man who may happen to come next , as a good despot ? "
8508	8512	8514	8514	Barker	247	" I do , "
8518	8565	8514	8514	Barker	247	" He may not be a good man . But he will be a good despot . For when he comes to a mere business routine of government he will endeavour to do ordinary justice . Do we not assume the same thing in a jury ? "
8571	8577	8578	8578	he	631	" I do n't know , "
8581	8661	8578	8578	he	631	" that I have any particular objection in detail to your excellent scheme of Government . My only objection is a quite personal one . It is , that if I were asked whether I would belong to it , I should ask first of all , if I was not permitted , as an alternative , to be a toad in a ditch . That is all . You can not argue with the choice of the soul . "
8662	8667	8669	8669	Barker	247	" Of the soul , "
8675	8692	8669	8669	Barker	247	" I can not pretend to say anything , but speaking in the interests of the public-- "
8702	8711	8712	8712	he	227	" If you 'll excuse me , gentlemen , "
8715	8727	8712	8712	he	227	" I will step out for a moment into the air . "
8728	8736	8738	8738	Lambert	226	" I 'm so sorry , Auberon , "
8744	8750	8738	8738	Lambert	226	" do you feel bad ? "
8751	8756	8758	8758	Auberon	227	" Not bad exactly , "
8765	8834	8758	8758	Auberon	227	" rather good , if anything . Strangely and richly good . The fact is , I want to reflect a little on those beautiful words that have just been uttered . ' Speaking , ' yes , that was the phrase , ' speaking in the interests of the public . ' One can not get the honey from such things without being alone for a little . "
8835	8847	8849	8849	Lambert	226	" Is he really off his chump , do you think ? "
8862	8871	8872	8872	he	227	" He is a man , I think , "
8875	8890	8872	8872	he	227	" who cares for nothing but a joke . He is a dangerous man . "
8904	8907	8908	8908	he	226	" Dangerous ! "
8911	8921	8908	8908	he	226	" You do n't know little Quin , sir ! "
8922	8928	8930	8932	the old man	620	" Every man is dangerous , "
8936	8950	8930	8932	the old man	620	" who cares only for one thing . I was once dangerous myself . "
9052	9061	9041	9041	He	620	accent--"But speaking in the interests of the public .... "
9068	9082	9084	9085	Auberon Quin	227	" In a little square garden of yellow roses , beside the sea , "
9087	9174	9084	9085	Auberon Quin	227	" there was a Nonconformist minister who had never been to Wimbledon . His family did not understand his sorrow or the strange look in his eyes . But one day they repented their neglect , for they heard that a body had been found on the shore , battered , but wearing patent leather boots . As it happened , it turned out not to be the minister at all . But in the dead man 's pocket there was a return ticket to Maidstone . "
9203	9207	9208	9208	he	227	" That story , "
9212	9219	9208	9208	he	227	" is the test of humour . "
9239	9243	9245	9245	Auberon	227	" I perceive , "
9247	9301	9245	9245	Auberon	227	" that you have passed the test , and consider the anecdote excruciatingly funny ; since you say nothing . Only coarse humour is received with pot - house applause . The great anecdote is received in silence , like a benediction . You felt pretty benedicted , did n't you , Barker ? "
9302	9308	9310	9310	Barker	247	" I saw the point , "
9315	9320	9322	9322	Quin	227	" Do you know , "
9331	9347	9322	9322	Quin	227	" I have lots of stories as good as that . Listen to this one . "
9355	9456	9352	9352	his	227	" Dr. Polycarp was , as you all know , an unusually sallow bimetallist . ' There , ' people of wide experience would say , ' There goes the sallowest bimetallist in Cheshire . ' Once this was said so that he overheard it : it was said by an actuary , under a sunset of mauve and grey . Polycarp turned upon him . ' Sallow ! ' he cried fiercely , ' sallow ! _ Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes . _ ' It was said that no actuary ever made game of Dr. Polycarp again . "
9468	9473	9475	9477	the insatiable Quin	227	" Here is another , "
9479	9633	9475	9477	the insatiable Quin	227	" In a hollow of the grey - green hills of rainy Ireland , lived an old , old woman , whose uncle was always Cambridge at the Boat Race . But in her grey - green hollows , she knew nothing of this : she did n't know that there was a Boat Race . Also she did not know that she had an uncle . She had heard of nobody at all , except of George the First , of whom she had heard ( I know not why ) , and in whose historical memory she put her simple trust . And by and by in God 's good time , it was discovered that this uncle of hers was not really her uncle , and they came and told her so . She smiled through her tears , and said only , ' Virtue is its own reward . ' "
9644	9651	9642	9642	Lambert	226	" It seems a bit mysterious . "
9652	9655	9657	9658	the other	618	" Mysterious ! "
9660	9681	9657	9658	the other	618	" The true humour is mysterious . Do you not realise the chief incident of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries ? "
9682	9688	9690	9690	Lambert	226	" And what 's that ? "
9694	9700	9702	9703	the other	618	" It is very simple , "
9705	9766	9702	9703	the other	618	" Hitherto it was the ruin of a joke that people did not see it . Now it is the sublime victory of a joke that people do not see it . Humour , my friends , is the one sanctity remaining to mankind . It is the one thing you are thoroughly afraid of . Look at that tree . "
9786	9789	9791	9792	Mr. Quin	227	" If , "
9794	9934	9935	9935	he	648	" I were to say that you did not see the great truths of science exhibited by that tree , though they stared any man of intellect in the face , what would you think or say ? You would merely regard me as a pedant with some unimportant theory about vegetable cells . If I were to say that you did not see in that tree the vile mismanagement of local politics , you would dismiss me as a Socialist crank with some particular fad about public parks . If I were to say that you were guilty of the supreme blasphemy of looking at that tree and not seeing in it a new religion , a special revelation of God , you would simply say I was a mystic , and think no more about me . But if"--and
9939	9973	9935	9935	he	648	hand--"if I say that you can not see the humour of that tree , and that I see the humour of it -- my God ! you will roll about at my feet . "
9983	10093	9974	9974	He	648	" Yes ; a sense of humour , a weird and delicate sense of humour , is the new religion of mankind ! It is towards that men will strain themselves with the asceticism of saints . Exercises , spiritual exercises , will be set in it . It will be asked , ' Can you see the humour of this iron railing ? ' or ' Can you see the humour of this field of corn ? Can you see the humour of the stars ? Can you see the humour of the sunsets ? ' How often I have laughed myself to sleep over a violet sunset . "
10094	10098	10100	10101	Mr. Barker	247	" Quite so , "
10108	10157	9974	9974	He	648	" Let me tell you another story . How often it happens that the M.P. 's for Essex are less punctual than one would suppose . The least punctual Essex M.P. , perhaps , was James Wilson , who said , in the very act of plucking a poppy-- "
10174	10177	10178	10178	he	226	" Auberon , "
10181	10196	10178	10178	he	226	" chuck it . I wo n't stand it . It 's all bosh . "
10226	10230	10232	10232	Quin	227	" You have , "
10234	10236	10232	10232	Quin	227	" no-- "
10237	10245	10247	10247	Lambert	226	" I do n't care a curse , "
10251	10300	10247	10247	Lambert	226	" whether I have ' a delicate sense of humour ' or not . I wo n't stand it . It 's all a confounded fraud . There 's no joke in those infernal tales at all . You know there is n't as well as I do . "
10301	10304	10306	10306	Quin	227	" Well , "
10310	10341	10306	10306	Quin	227	" it is true that I , with my rather gradual mental processes , did not see any joke in them . But the finer sense of Barker perceived it . "
10356	10360	10362	10362	Lambert	226	" You ass , "
10364	10407	10362	10362	Lambert	226	" why ca n't you be like other people ? Why ca n't you say something really funny , or hold your tongue ? The man who sits on his hat in a pantomime is a long sight funnier than you are . "
10428	10431	10433	10433	Auberon	227	" Lambert , "
10435	10588	10433	10433	Auberon	227	" you are a great and good man , though I 'm hanged if you look it . You are more . You are a great revolutionist or deliverer of the world , and I look forward to seeing you carved in marble between Luther and Danton , if possible in your present attitude , the hat slightly on one side . I said as I came up the hill that the new humour was the last of the religions . You have made it the last of the superstitions . But let me give you a very serious warning . Be careful how you ask me to do anything _ outré _ , to imitate the man in the pantomime , and to sit on my hat . Because I am a man whose soul has been emptied of all pleasures but folly . And for twopence I 'd do it . "
10589	10595	10597	10597	Lambert	226	" Do it , then , "
10604	10617	10597	10597	Lambert	226	" It would be funnier than the bosh you and Barker talk . "
10640	10646	10647	10647	he	227	" Two hundred yards away , "
10650	10746	10647	10647	he	227	" are all your fashionable acquaintances with nothing on earth to do but to stare at each other and at us . We are standing upon an elevation under the open sky , a peak as it were of fantasy , a Sinai of humour . We are in a great pulpit or platform , lit up with sunlight , and half London can see us . Be careful how you suggest things to me . For there is in me a madness which goes beyond martyrdom , the madness of an utterly idle man . "
10747	10758	10760	10760	Lambert	226	" I do n't know what you are talking about , "
10764	10783	10760	10760	Lambert	226	" I only know I 'd rather you stood on your silly head , than talked so much . "
10784	10792	10794	10794	Barker	247	" Auberon ! for goodness ' sake ... "
10883	10901	10903	10903	Barker	247	" For God 's sake , Quin , get up , and do n't be an idiot , "
10909	10918	10903	10903	Barker	247	" we shall have the whole town here . "
10919	10930	10932	10932	Lambert	226	" Yes , get up , get up , man , "
10938	10947	10932	10932	Lambert	226	" I was only fooling ; get up . "
10980	10994	10996	10996	Lambert	226	" Oh , let 's get home , Barker , and leave him , "
10998	11015	10996	10996	Lambert	226	" some of your proper and correct police will look after him . Here they come ! "
11039	11046	11048	11048	Lambert	226	" There he is , officer , "
11052	11060	11048	11048	Lambert	226	" we ai n't responsible for him . "
11074	11082	11083	11083	he	666	" We have not come , gentlemen , "
11086	11151	11083	11083	he	666	" about what I think you are alluding to . We have come from head - quarters to announce the selection of His Majesty the King . It is the rule , inherited from the old _ régime _ , that the news should be brought to the new Sovereign immediately , wherever he is ; so we have followed you across Kensington Gardens . "
11210	11215	11216	11216	he	247	" Which of us , "
11226	11269	11220	11222	the respectful official	668	" Not you , sir , I am sorry to say . If I may be permitted to say so , we know your services to the Government , and should be very thankful if it were . The choice has fallen .... "
11270	11276	11278	11278	Lambert	226	" God bless my soul ! "
11285	11300	11278	11278	Lambert	226	" Not me . Do n't say I 'm autocrat of all the Russias . "
11301	11306	11308	11309	the officer	666	" No , sir , "
11340	11359	11327	11327	his	227	" the gentleman whom we have to congratulate seems at the moment -- er -- er -- occupied . "
11360	11364	11366	11366	Barker	247	" Not Quin ! "
11373	11395	11366	11366	Barker	247	" it ca n't be . Auberon , for God 's sake pull yourself together . You 've been made King ! "
11410	11488	11406	11407	Mr. Quin	227	" I am not worthy . I can not reasonably claim to equal the great men who have previously swayed the sceptre of Britain . Perhaps the only peculiarity that I can claim is that I am probably the first monarch that ever spoke out his soul to the people of England with his head and body in this position . This may in some sense give me , to quote a poem that I wrote in my youth--
11518	11518	11519	11519	Lambert	226	"
11530	11536	11538	11538	Lambert	226	" Do n't you understand ? "
11540	11563	11538	11538	Lambert	226	" It 's not a joke . They 've really made you King . By gosh ! they must have rum taste . "
11564	11573	11575	11575	Quin	227	" The great Bishops of the Middle Ages , "
11595	11657	11575	11575	Quin	227	" were in the habit of refusing the honour of election three times and then accepting it . A mere matter of detail separates me from those great men . I will accept the post three times and refuse it afterwards . Oh ! I will toil for you , my faithful people ! You shall have a banquet of humour . "
11689	11699	11700	11700	he	227	" Did you not tell me , Wilfrid Lambert , "
11703	11752	11753	11753	he	227	" that I should be of more public value if I adopted a more popular form of humour ? And when should a popular form of humour be more firmly riveted upon me than now , when I have become the darling of a whole people ? Officer , "
11761	11774	11753	11753	he	227	" are there no ceremonies to celebrate my entry into the city ? "
11775	11778	11780	11781	the official	674	" Ceremonies , "
11786	11799	11780	11781	the official	674	" have been more or less neglected for some little time , and-- "
11810	11814	11815	11815	he	227	" All ceremony , "
11818	11852	11854	11854	he	227	" consists in the reversal of the obvious . Thus men , when they wish to be priests or judges , dress up like women . Kindly help me on with this coat . "
11859	11865	11867	11868	the officer	666	" But , your Majesty , "
11878	11890	11867	11868	the officer	666	" you 're putting it on with the tails in front . "
11891	11898	11900	11901	the King	1924	" The reversal of the obvious , "
11905	11923	11900	11901	the King	1924	" is as near as we can come to ritual with our imperfect apparatus . Lead on . "
12128	12134	12135	12135	he	247	" Where are you going ? "
12138	12148	12150	12150	Barker	247	" To stop all this foolery , of course , "
12191	12199	12188	12189	the King	1924	" Your hat , if you please . "
12234	12240	12241	12241	he	1924	" A quaint old custom , "
12249	12328	12241	12241	he	1924	" When the King receives the representatives of the House of Barker , the hat of the latter is immediately destroyed in this manner . It represents the absolute finality of the act of homage expressed in the removal of it . It declares that never until that hat shall once more appear upon your head ( a contingency which I firmly believe to be remote ) shall the House of Barker rebel against the Crown of England . "
12339	12343	12344	12344	he	247	" Your jokes , "
12347	12351	12344	12344	he	247	" and my property-- "
12363	12368	12370	12371	the King	1924	" Continue , continue , "
12377	12384	12386	12387	the other	618	" What does it all mean ? "
12396	12401	12386	12387	the other	618	" Are you mad ? "
12402	12408	12410	12411	the King	1924	" Not in the least , "
12415	12437	12410	12411	the King	1924	" Madmen are always serious ; they go mad from lack of humour . You are looking serious yourself , James . "
12438	12451	12453	12454	the other	618	" Why ca n't you keep it to your own private life ? "
12456	12482	12453	12454	the other	618	" You 've got plenty of money , and plenty of houses now to play the fool in , but in the interests of the public-- "
12483	12486	12488	12489	the King	1924	" Epigrammatic , "
12498	12695	12488	12489	the King	1924	" None of your daring scintillations here . As to why I do n't do it in private , I rather fail to understand your question . The answer is of comparative limpidity . I do n't do it in private , because it is funnier to do it in public . You appear to think that it would be amusing to be dignified in the banquet hall and in the street , and at my own fireside ( I could procure a fireside ) to keep the company in a roar . But that is what every one does . Every one is grave in public , and funny in private . My sense of humour suggests the reversal of this ; it suggests that one should be funny in public , and solemn in private . I desire to make the State functions , parliaments , coronations , and so on , one roaring old - fashioned pantomime . But , on the other hand , I shut myself up alone in a small store - room for two hours a day , where I am so dignified that I come out quite ill . "
12720	12733	12734	12734	he	247	" Well , you will ruin the country , that 's all , "
12738	12744	12746	12746	Auberon	227	" It seems to me , "
12748	12802	12746	12746	Auberon	227	" that the tradition of ten centuries is being broken , and the House of Barker is rebelling against the Crown of England . It would be with regret ( for I admire your appearance ) that I should be obliged forcibly to decorate your head with the remains of this hat , but-- "
12803	12810	12812	12812	Barker	247	" What I ca n't understand , "
12823	12837	12812	12812	Barker	247	" is why you do n't care about anything else but your games . "
12865	12873	12874	12874	he	247	" I made a kind of vow , "
12877	12902	12874	12874	he	247	" that I would not talk seriously , which always means answering silly questions . But the strong man will always be gentle with politicians .
13005	13005	12980	12980	you	708	"
13006	13015	13017	13017	Barker	247	" Do n't you realise common public necessities ? "
13019	13039	13017	13017	Barker	247	" Is it possible that a man of your intelligence does not know that it is every one 's interest-- "
13040	13058	13060	13061	the King	1924	" Do n't you believe in Zoroaster ? Is it possible that you neglect Mumbo - Jumbo ? "
13067	13361	13363	13363	he	712	" Does a man of your intelligence come to me with these damned early Victorian ethics ? If , on studying my features and manner , you detect any particular resemblance to the Prince Consort , I assure you you are mistaken . Did Herbert Spencer ever convince you -- did he ever convince anybody -- did he ever for one mad moment convince himself -- that it must be to the interest of the individual to feel a public spirit ? Do you believe that , if you rule your department badly , you stand any more chance , or one half of the chance , of being guillotined , that an angler stands of being pulled into the river by a strong pike ? Herbert Spencer refrained from theft for the same reason that he refrained from wearing feathers in his hair , because he was an English gentleman with different tastes . I am an English gentleman with different tastes . He liked philosophy . I like art . He liked writing ten books on the nature of human society . I like to see the Lord Chamberlain walking in front of me with a piece of paper pinned to his coat - tails . It is my humour . Are you answered ? At any rate , I have said my last serious word to - day , and my last serious word I trust for the remainder of my life in this Paradise of Fools . The remainder of my conversation with you to - day , which I trust will be long and stimulating , I propose to conduct in a new language of my own by means of rapid and symbolic movements of the left leg .

13542	13549	13539	13539	he	1924	" and mingle with the people . "
13646	13653	13654	13654	he	1924	" I have a few notes , "
13657	13663	13665	13665	he	1924	" for my dying speech ; "
13671	13720	13665	13665	he	1924	" Dying speech for political assassination ; ditto , if by former friend -- h'm , h'm . Dying speech for death at hands of injured husband ( repentant ) . Dying speech for same ( cynical ) . I am not quite sure which meets the present .... "

13777	13845	13774	13774	he	1924	" I 'm glad you are so stalwart a defender of your old inviolate Notting Hill . Look up nightly to that peak , my child , where it lifts itself among the stars so ancient , so lonely , so unutterably Notting . So long as you are ready to die for the sacred mountain , even if it were ringed with all the armies of Bayswater-- "
13856	13859	13860	13860	he	1924	" Perhaps , "
13863	13933	13860	13860	he	1924	" perhaps the noblest of all my conceptions . A revival of the arrogance of the old mediæval cities applied to our glorious suburbs . Clapham with a city guard . Wimbledon with a city wall . Surbiton tolling a bell to raise its citizens . West Hampstead going into battle with its own banner . It shall be done . I , the King , have said it . "

14052	14057	14059	14060	Captain Bowler	255	" Yes , sir , "
14066	14101	14059	14060	Captain Bowler	255	" you are a member of ' The Encouragers of Egyptian Renaissance , ' and ' The Teutonic Tombs Club , ' and ' The Society for the Recovery of London Antiquities , ' and-- "
14102	14107	14109	14110	the King	1924	" That is admirable , "
14112	14306	14109	14110	the King	1924	" The London Antiquities does my trick . Go to the Society for the Recovery of London Antiquities and speak to their secretary , and their sub - secretary , and their president , and their vice - president , saying , ' The King of England is proud , but the honorary member of the Society for the Recovery of London Antiquities is prouder than kings . I should like to tell you of certain discoveries I have made touching the neglected traditions of the London boroughs . The revelations may cause some excitement , stirring burning memories and touching old wounds in Shepherd 's Bush and Bayswater , in Pimlico and South Kensington . The King hesitates , but the honorary member is firm . I approach you invoking the vows of my initiation , the Sacred Seven Cats , the Poker of Perfection , and the Ordeal of the Indescribable Instant ( forgive me if I mix you up with the Clan - na - Gael or some other club I belong to ) , and ask you to permit me to read a paper at your next meeting on the "
14313	14371	14109	14110	the King	1924	" ' Say all this to the Society , Bowler . Remember it very carefully , for it is most important , and I have forgotten it altogether , and send me another cup of coffee and some of the cigars that we keep for vulgar and successful people . I am going to write my paper . "
14656	14738	14633	14634	The King	261	" At this supreme hour of my life I feel that to no one but the members of the Society for the Recovery of London Antiquities can I open my heart ( cheers ) . If the world turns upon my policy , and the storms of popular hostility begin to rise ( no , no ) , I feel that it is here , with my brave Recoverers around me , that I can best meet them , sword in hand "

14866	14994	14862	14863	The King	261	" Being called , however unworthily , to this high estate , I have resolved that , so far as possible , this neglect shall cease . I desire no military glory . I lay claim to no constitutional equality with Justinian or Alfred . If I can go down to history as the man who saved from extinction a few old English customs , if our descendants can say it was through this man , humble as he was , that the Ten Turnips are still eaten in Fulham , and the Putney parish councillor still shaves one half of his head , I shall look my great fathers reverently but not fearfully in the face when I go down to the last house of Kings . "
15010	15645	15004	15004	himself	1924	" I trust that to very few of you , at least , I need dwell on the sublime origins of these legends . The very names of your boroughs bear witness to them . So long as Hammersmith is called Hammersmith , its people will live in the shadow of that primal hero , the Blacksmith , who led the democracy of the Broadway into battle till he drove the chivalry of Kensington before him and overthrew them at that place which in honour of the best blood of the defeated aristocracy is still called Kensington Gore . Men of Hammersmith will not fail to remember that the very name of Kensington originated from the lips of their hero . For at the great banquet of reconciliation held after the war , when the disdainful oligarchs declined to join in the songs of the men of the Broadway ( which are to this day of a rude and popular character ) , the great Republican leader , with his rough humour , said the words which are written in gold upon his monument , ' Little birds that can sing and wo n't sing , must be made to sing . ' So that the Eastern Knights were called Cansings or Kensings ever afterwards . But you also have great memories , O men of Kensington ! You showed that you could sing , and sing great war - songs . Even after the dark day of Kensington Gore , history will not forget those three Knights who guarded your disordered retreat from Hyde Park ( so called from your hiding there ) , those three Knights after whom Knightsbridge is named . Nor will it forget the day of your re - emergence , purged in the fire of calamity , cleansed of your oligarchic corruptions , when , sword in hand , you drove the Empire of Hammersmith back mile by mile , swept it past its own Broadway , and broke it at last in a battle so long and bloody that the birds of prey have left their name upon it . Men have called it , with austere irony , the Ravenscourt . I shall not , I trust , wound the patriotism of Bayswater , or the lonelier pride of Brompton , or that of any other historic township , by taking these two special examples . I select them , not because they are more glorious than the rest , but partly from personal association ( I am myself descended from one of the three heroes of Knightsbridge ) , and partly from the consciousness that I am an amateur antiquarian , and can not presume to deal with times and places more remote and more mysterious . It is not for me to settle the question between two such men as Professor Hugg and Sir William Whisky as to whether Notting Hill means Nutting Hill ( in allusion to the rich woods which no longer cover it ) , or whether it is a corruption of Nothing - ill , referring to its reputation among the ancients as an Earthly Paradise . When a Podkins and a Jossy confess themselves doubtful about the boundaries of West Kensington ( said to have been traced in the blood of Oxen ) , I need not be ashamed to confess a similar doubt . I will ask you to excuse me from further history , and to assist me with your encouragement in dealing with the problem which faces us to - day . Is this ancient spirit of the London townships to die out ? Are our omnibus conductors and policemen to lose altogether that light which we see so often in their eyes , the dreamy light of
15721	15991	15716	15716	I	0	" To - morrow morning at twenty - five minutes past ten , if Heaven spares my life , I purpose to issue a Proclamation . It has been the work of my life , and is about half finished . With the assistance of a whisky and soda , I shall conclude the other half to - night , and my people will receive it to - morrow . All these boroughs where you were born , and hope to lay your bones , shall be reinstated in their ancient magnificence,--Hammersmith , Kensington , Bayswater , Chelsea , Battersea , Clapham , Balham , and a hundred others . Each shall immediately build a city wall with gates to be closed at sunset . Each shall have a city guard , armed to the teeth . Each shall have a banner , a coat - of - arms , and , if convenient , a gathering cry . I will not enter into the details now , my heart is too full . They will be found in the proclamation itself . You will all , however , be subject to enrolment in the local city guards , to be summoned together by a thing called the Tocsin , the meaning of which I am studying in my researches into history . Personally , I believe a tocsin to be some kind of highly paid official . If , therefore , any of you happen to have such a thing as a halberd in the house , I should advise you to practise with it in the garden . "
16141	16147	16148	16148	he	1924	" Go and buy me , "
16151	16222	16148	16148	he	1924	" a shilling paint - box , which you will get , unless the mists of time mislead me , in a shop at the corner of the second and dirtier street that leads out of Rochester Row . I have already requested the Master of the Buckhounds to provide me with cardboard . It seemed to me ( I know not why ) that it fell within his department . "
16273	16279	16280	16280	he	1924	" I can not think , "
16283	16419	16280	16280	he	1924	" why people should think the names of places in the country more poetical than those in London . Shallow romanticists go away in trains and stop in places called Hugmy - in - the - Hole , or Bumps - on - the - Puddle . And all the time they could , if they liked , go and live at a place with the dim , divine name of St. John 's Wood . I have never been to St. John 's Wood . I dare not . I should be afraid of the innumerable night of fir trees , afraid to come upon a blood - red cup and the beating of the wings of the Eagle . But all these things can be imagined by remaining reverently in the Harrow train . "
16466	16474	16475	16475	he	1924	" Let us think of milder matters , "
16478	16708	16475	16475	he	1924	" Lavender Hill ! Could any of your glebes and combes and all the rest of it produce so fragrant an idea ? Think of a mountain of lavender lifting itself in purple poignancy into the silver skies and filling men 's nostrils with a new breath of life -- a purple hill of incense . It is true that upon my few excursions of discovery on a halfpenny tram I have failed to hit the precise spot . But it must be there ; some poet called it by its name . There is at least warrant enough for the solemn purple plumes ( following the botanical formation of lavender ) which I have required people to wear in the neighbourhood of Clapham Junction . It is so everywhere , after all . I have never been actually to Southfields , but I suppose a scheme of lemons and olives represent their austral instincts . I have never visited Parson 's Green , or seen either the Green or the Parson , but surely the pale - green shovel - hats I have designed must be more or less in the spirit . I must work in the dark and let my instincts guide me . The great love I bear to my people will certainly save me from distressing their noble spirit or violating their great traditions . "
16877	16885	16886	16886	he	788	" In God 's name , Auberon , "
16896	16917	16886	16886	he	788	" you do n't mean that you are really going to have these city guards and city walls and things ? "
16918	16924	16926	16927	the infant	796	" I am , indeed , "
16934	16988	16926	16927	the infant	796	" Why should n't I have them ? I have modelled them precisely on your political principles . Do you know what I 've done , Barker ? I 've behaved like a true Barkerian . I 've ... but perhaps it wo n't interest you , the account of my Barkerian conduct . "
16989	16998	17000	17000	Barker	247	" Oh , go on , go on , "
17002	17010	17012	17012	Auberon	261	" The account of my Barkerian conduct , "
17016	17091	17012	17012	Auberon	261	" seems not only to interest , but to alarm you . Yet it is very simple . It merely consists in choosing all the provosts under any new scheme by the same principle by which you have caused the central despot to be appointed . Each provost , of each city , under my charter , is to be appointed by rotation . Sleep , therefore , my Barker , a rosy sleep . "
17098	17156	17092	17092	Barker	247	" But , in God 's name , do n't you see , Quin , that the thing is quite different ? In the centre it does n't matter so much , just because the whole object of despotism is to get some sort of unity . But if any damned parish can go to any damned man-- "
17157	17163	17165	17166	King Auberon	261	" I see your difficulty , "
17170	17182	17184	17184	he	247	" You feel that your talents may be neglected . Listen ! "
17190	17253	17184	17184	he	247	" I solemnly give to my liege subject , James Barker , my special and splendid favour , the right to override the obvious text of the Charter of the Cities , and to be , in his own right , Lord High Provost of South Kensington . And now , my dear James , you are all right . Good day . "
17254	17256	17258	17258	Barker	247	" But-- "

18399	18419	18393	18394	the King	1924	" What news does he bring from that land of high hills and fair women ? He is welcome . "

18537	18556	18516	18516	he	1924	" I am glad to see you . Never mind , never mind . Ceremony is not everything . "

18652	18755	18645	18646	the King	1924	" if you ask me I do n't mind telling you , not because I myself attach any importance to these forms in comparison with the Honest Heart . But it is usual -- it is usual -- that is all , for a man when entering the presence of Royalty to lie down on his back on the floor and elevating his feet towards heaven ( as the source of Royal power ) to say three times ' Monarchical institutions improve the manners . ' But there , there -- such pomp is far less truly dignified than your simple kindliness . "
18770	18774	18776	18777	the King	1924	" And now , "
18793	18823	18776	18777	the King	1924	" what delightful weather we are having ! You must find your official robes warm , my Lord . I designed them for your own snow - bound land . "
18824	18832	18834	18834	Buck	273	" They 're as hot as hell , "
18838	18845	18834	18834	Buck	273	" I came here on business . "
18846	18849	18851	18852	the King	1924	" Right , "
18865	18932	18851	18852	the King	1924	" right , right , right . Business , as the sad glad old Persian said , is business . Be punctual . Rise early . Point the pen to the shoulder . Point the pen to the shoulder , for you know not whence you come nor why . Point the pen to the shoulder , for you know not when you go nor where . "

We have been at work ten years buying property and getting compulsory powers and fixing compensation and squaring vested interests , and now at the very end , the thing is stopped by a fool . Old Prout , who was Provost of Notting Hill , was a business man , and we dealt with him quite satisfactorily . But he 's dead , and the cursed lot has fallen on a young man named Wayne , who 's up to some game that 's perfectly incomprehensible to me . We offer him a better price than any one ever dreamt of , but he wo n't let the road go through . And his Council seems to be backing him up . It 's midsummer madness . "
19130	19138	19139	19139	he	1924	" What a perfect phrase that is ! "
19142	19148	19139	19139	he	1924	" ' Midsummer madness ' ! "
19149	19155	19157	19157	Buck	273	" The chief point is , "
19161	19242	19157	19157	Buck	273	" that the only part that is really in question is one dirty little street -- Pump Street -- a street with nothing in it but a public - house and a penny toy - shop , and that sort of thing . All the respectable people of Notting Hill have accepted our compensation . But the ineffable Wayne sticks out over Pump Street . Says he 's Provost of Notting Hill . He 's only Provost of Pump Street . "
19243	19248	19250	19250	Auberon	261	" A good thought , "
19252	19270	19250	19250	Auberon	261	" I like the idea of a Provost of Pump Street . Why not let him alone ? "
19271	19278	19281	19281	Buck	273	" And drop the whole scheme ! "
19290	19314	19281	19281	Buck	273	" I 'll be damned if we do . No . I 'm for sending in workmen to pull down without more ado . "
19315	19322	19324	19330	the King , hot with historical associations	886	" Strike for the purple Eagle ! "
19332	19341	19343	19343	Buck	273	" I 'll tell you what it is , "
19350	19380	19343	19343	Buck	273	" If your Majesty would spend less time in insulting respectable people with your silly coats - of - arms , and more time over the business of the nation-- "

The burgher 's head should be thrown back and the right arm extended ; the left may be lifted towards Heaven , but that I leave to your private religious sentiment .

19582	19589	19591	19592	the King	1924	" It is a fit symbol , "
19594	19625	19591	19592	the King	1924	" your immortal bay - wreath . Fulham may seek for wealth , and Kensington for art , but when did the men of Bayswater care for anything but glory ? "

19804	19842	19750	19750	Wilson	274	" It affects both of us , yer see , yer Majesty , as this scheme was started for the benefit of the ' ole neighbourhood . So Mr. Buck and me we put our ' eads together-- "
19849	19852	19853	19853	he	1924	" Perfect ! "
19858	19882	19853	19853	he	1924	" Your heads together ! I can see it ! Ca n't you do it now ? Oh , do do it now ! "

20171	20206	20138	20138	He	247	" Your Majesty -- pray forgive my intrusion . It is about this man in Pump Street . I see you have Buck here , so you have probably heard what is necessary . I-- "

This fellow , by the look in his eyes , is even more indignant than the rest . No sign in those large blue eyes , at any rate , of ever having heard of a joke . He 'll remonstrate with the others , and they 'll remonstrate with him , and they 'll all make themselves sumptuously happy remonstrating with me . "

You are mad , because you care for politics , as mad as a man who collects tram tickets . Buck is mad , because he cares for money , as mad as a man who lives on opium . Wilson is mad , because he thinks himself right , as mad as a man who thinks himself God Almighty . The Provost of West Kensington is mad , because he thinks he is respectable , as mad as a man who thinks he is a chicken . All men are mad but the humorist , who cares for nothing and possesses everything . I thought that there was only one humorist in England . Fools!--dolts!--open your cows ' eyes ; there are two ! In Notting Hill -- in that unpromising elevation -- there has been born an artist ! You thought to spoil my joke , and bully me out of it , by becoming more and more modern , more and more practical , more and more bustling and rational . Oh , what a feast it was to answer you by becoming more and more august , more and more gracious , more and more ancient and mellow ! But this lad has seen how to bowl me out . He has answered me back , vaunt for vaunt , rhetoric for rhetoric . He has lifted the only shield I can not break , the shield of an impenetrable pomposity . Listen to him . You have come , my Lord , about Pump Street ? "

22034	22216	22032	22032	Wayne	280	" If I stood firm before , do you think I shall weaken now that I have seen the face of the King ? For I fight for something greater , if greater there can be , than the hearthstones of my people and the Lordship of the Lion . I fight for your royal vision , for the great dream you dreamt of the League of the Free Cities . You have given me this liberty . If I had been a beggar and you had flung me a coin , if I had been a peasant in a dance and you had flung me a favour , do you think I would have let it be taken by any ruffians on the road ? This leadership and liberty of Notting Hill is a gift from your Majesty , and if it is taken from me , by God ! it shall be taken in battle , and the noise of that battle shall be heard in the flats of Chelsea and in the studios of St. John 's Wood .

22304	22329	22301	22302	the King	1924	" You will keep up the pose . Funnily , of course , it is serious . But seriously , is n't it funny ? "
22330	22333	22335	22335	Wayne	280	" What ? "
22344	22370	22301	22302	the King	1924	" Hang it all , do n't play any more . The whole business -- the Charter of the Cities . Is n't it immense ? "
22371	22382	22301	22302	the King	1924	" Immense is no unworthy word for that glorious design . "
22383	22422	22301	22302	the King	1924	" Oh , hang you ! But , of course , I see . You want me to clear the room of these reasonable sows . You want the two humorists alone together . Leave us , gentlemen . "

22517	22553	22514	22514	he	1924	" we were made for each other . It is too beautiful . Think of the valiant independence of Pump Street . That is the real thing . It is the deification of the ludicrous . "

22592	22638	22587	22588	the King	1924	" you need n't keep it up with me . The augurs must wink sometimes from sheer fatigue of the eyelids . Let us enjoy this for half an hour , not as actors , but as dramatic critics . Is n't it a joke ? "
22653	22685	22639	22640	Adam Wayne	280	" I do not understand your Majesty . I can not believe that while I fight for your royal charter your Majesty deserts me for these dogs of the gold hunt . "

22986	23028	22980	22981	the King	1924	" All right -- all right -- I see you are ; but let me take it in . You do really propose to fight these modern improvers with their boards and inspectors and surveyors and all the rest of it ? "
23029	23035	23037	23037	Wayne	280	" Are they so terrible ? "
23056	23061	23062	23062	he	1924	" And I suppose , "

23165	23172	23174	23174	Wayne	280	" Of course they think so , "

23210	23219	23221	23222	the Provost	876	" You have been my tutor , Sire , "

23234	23237	23239	23240	the King	1924	" Eh ? "
23242	23502	23221	23222	the Provost	876	" It was your Majesty who first stirred my dim patriotism into flame . Ten years ago , when I was a boy ( I am only nineteen ) , I was playing on the slope of Pump Street , with a wooden sword and a paper helmet , dreaming of great wars . In an angry trance I struck out with my sword , and stood petrified , for I saw that I had struck you , Sire , my King , as you wandered in a noble secrecy , watching over your people 's welfare . But I need have had no fear . Then was I taught to understand Kingliness . You neither shrank nor frowned . You summoned no guards . You invoked no punishments . But in august and burning words , which are written in my soul , never to be erased , you told me ever to turn my sword against the enemies of my inviolate city . Like a priest pointing to the altar , you pointed to the hill of Notting . ' So long , ' you said , ' as you are ready to die for the sacred mountain , even if it were ringed with all the armies of Bayswater . ' I have not forgotten the words , and I have reason now to remember them , for the hour is come and the crown of your prophecy . The sacred hill is ringed with the armies of Bayswater , and I am ready to die . "
23517	23526	23527	23527	he	1924	" Oh , Lord , Lord , Lord , "
23530	23733	23527	23527	he	1924	" what a life ! what a life ! All my work ! I seem to have done it all . So you 're the red - haired boy that hit me in the waistcoat . What have I done ? God , what have I done ? I thought I would have a joke , and I have created a passion . I tried to compose a burlesque , and it seems to be turning halfway through into an epic . What is to be done with such a world ? In the Lord 's name , was n't the joke broad and bold enough ? I abandoned my subtle humour to amuse you , and I seem to have brought tears to your eyes . What 's to be done with people when you write a pantomime for them -- call the sausages classic festoons , and the policeman cut in two a tragedy of public duty ? But why am I talking ? Why am I asking questions of a nice young gentleman who is totally mad ? What is the good of it ? What is the good of anything ? Oh , Lord ! Oh , Lord ! "
23740	23754	23793	23794	the Provost	876	" Do n't you really think the sacred Notting Hill at all absurd ? "
23755	23758	23760	23760	Wayne	280	" Absurd ? "
23764	23769	23760	23760	Wayne	280	" Why should I ? "
23777	23783	23784	23784	he	1924	" I beg your pardon , "
23787	23791	23793	23794	the Provost	876	" Notting Hill , "
23798	23843	23793	23794	the Provost	876	" is a rise or high ground of the common earth , on which men have built houses to live , in which they are born , fall in love , pray , marry , and die . Why should I think it absurd ? "
23848	23853	23854	23854	he	261	" Because , my Leonidas-- "
23925	23931	23921	23922	the King	1924	" Why trouble about politics ? "
23949	23960	23961	23961	he	261	" It is generally felt to be a little funny , "
23965	23969	23971	23971	Adam	280	" I suppose , "
23979	23989	23971	23971	Adam	280	suddenness--"I suppose you fancy crucifixion was a serious affair ? "
23990	23994	23971	23971	Adam	280	" Well , I-- "
23996	24008	23971	23971	Adam	280	Auberon--"I admit I have generally thought it had its graver side . "
24009	24015	24017	24017	Wayne	280	" Then you are wrong , "
24023	24110	24017	24017	Wayne	280	" Crucifixion is comic . It is exquisitely diverting . It was an absurd and obscene kind of impaling reserved for people who were made to be laughed at -- for slaves and provincials , for dentists and small tradesmen , as you would say . I have seen the grotesque gallows - shape , which the little Roman gutter - boys scribbled on walls as a vulgar joke , blazing on the pinnacles of the temples of the world . And shall I turn back ? "
24128	24222	24121	24121	his	280	" This laughter with which men tyrannise is not the great power you think it . Peter was crucified , and crucified head downwards . What could be funnier than the idea of a respectable old Apostle upside down ? What could be more in the style of your modern humour ? But what was the good of it ? Upside down or right side up , Peter was Peter to mankind . Upside down he stills hangs over Europe , and millions move and breathe only in the life of his Church . "
24229	24238	24239	24239	he	261	" There is something in what you say , "
24242	24253	24239	24239	he	261	" You seem to have been thinking , young man . "
24254	24260	24262	24263	the Provost	876	" Only feeling , sire , "
24265	24434	24262	24263	the Provost	876	" I was born , like other men , in a spot of the earth which I loved because I had played boys ' games there , and fallen in love , and talked with my friends through nights that were nights of the gods . And I feel the riddle . These little gardens where we told our loves . These streets where we brought out our dead . Why should they be commonplace ? Why should they be absurd ? Why should it be grotesque to say that a pillar - box is poetic when for a year I could not see a red pillar - box against the yellow evening in a certain street without being wracked with something of which God keeps the secret , but which is stronger than sorrow or joy ? Why should any one be able to raise a laugh by saying ' the Cause of Notting Hill'?--Notting Hill where thousands of immortal spirits blaze with alternate hope and fear . "
24464	24470	24471	24471	he	261	" It is very difficult , "
24476	24568	24471	24471	he	261	" It is a damned difficult thing . I see what you mean ; I agree with you even up to a point -- or I should like to agree with you , if I were young enough to be a prophet and poet . I feel a truth in everything you say until you come to the words ' Notting Hill . ' And then I regret to say that the old Adam awakes roaring with laughter and makes short work of the new Adam , whose name is Wayne . "
24598	24602	24603	24603	he	280	" I know , "
24614	24657	24603	24603	he	280	" there is truth in what you say , too . It is hard not to laugh at the common names -- I only say we should not . I have thought of a remedy ; but such thoughts are rather terrible . "
24658	24662	24664	24664	Auberon	261	" What thoughts ? "
24689	24795	24682	24682	his	928	" I know of a magic wand , but it is a wand that only one or two may rightly use , and only seldom . It is a fairy wand of great fear , stronger than those who use it -- often frightful , often wicked to use . But whatever is touched with it is never again wholly common ; whatever is touched with it takes a magic from outside the world . If I touch , with this fairy wand , the railways and the roads of Notting Hill , men will love them , and be afraid of them for ever . "
24796	24805	24807	24808	the King	1924	" What the devil are you talking about ? "
24810	24823	24826	24827	the madman	984	" It has made mean landscapes magnificent , and hovels outlast cathedrals , "
24829	24865	24826	24827	the madman	984	" Why should it not make lamp - posts fairer than Greek lamps ; and an omnibus - ride like a painted ship ? The touch of it is the finger of a strange perfection . "
24866	24872	24874	24875	the King	1924	" What is your wand ? "
24879	24884	24886	24886	Wayne	280	" There it is , "
24902	24906	24908	24909	the King	1924	" The sword ! "
24919	24924	24926	24926	Wayne	280	" Yes , yes , "
24930	24945	24926	24926	Wayne	280	" The things touched by that are not vulgar ; the things touched by that-- "
24954	24962	24963	24963	he	261	" You will shed blood for that ! "
24966	24973	24963	24963	he	261	" For a cursed point of view-- "
24974	24983	24986	24986	Adam	280	" Oh , you kings , you kings ! "
24994	25284	24986	24986	Adam	280	" How humane you are , how tender , how considerate ! You will make war for a frontier , or the imports of a foreign harbour ; you will shed blood for the precise duty on lace , or the salute to an admiral . But for the things that make life itself worthy or miserable -- how humane you are ! I say here , and I know well what I speak of , there were never any necessary wars but the religious wars . There were never any just wars but the religious wars . There were never any humane wars but the religious wars . For these men were fighting for something that claimed , at least , to be the happiness of a man , the virtue of a man . A Crusader thought , at least , that Islam hurt the soul of every man , king or tinker , that it could really capture . I think Buck and Barker and these rich vultures hurt the soul of every man , hurt every inch of the ground , hurt every brick of the houses , that they can really capture . Do you think I have no right to fight for Notting Hill , you whose English Government has so often fought for tomfooleries ? If , as your rich friends say , there are no gods , and the skies are dark above us , what should a man fight for , but the place where he had the Eden of childhood and the short heaven of first love ? If no temples and no scriptures are sacred , what is sacred if a man 's own youth is not sacred ? "
25297	25302	25303	25303	he	1924	" It is hard , "
25310	25322	25303	25303	he	1924	" to assent to a view so desperate -- so responsible .... "

26099	26320	26096	26097	the King	1924	" no one but a woman could have written those lines . A woman has always a weakness for nature ; with her art is only beautiful as an echo or shadow of it . She is praising the hansom cab by theme and theory , but her soul is still a child by the sea , picking up shells . She can never be utterly of the town , as a man can ; indeed , do we not speak ( with sacred propriety ) of ' a man about town ' ? Who ever spoke of a woman about town ? However much , physically , ' about town ' a woman may be , she still models herself on nature ; she tries to carry nature with her ; she bids grasses to grow on her head , and furry beasts to bite her about the throat . In the heart of a dim city , she models her hat on a flaring cottage garden of flowers . We , with our nobler civic sentiment , model ours on a chimney pot ; the ensign of civilisation . And rather than be without birds , she will commit massacre , that she may turn her head into a tree , with dead birds to sing on it . "

26376	26453	26057	26058	the critic	1015	" is , as we have said , that they praise the hansom cab by comparing it to the shell , to a natural thing . Now , hear the author of ' Hymns on the Hill , ' and how he deals with the same subject . In his fine nocturne , entitled ' The Last Omnibus ' he relieves the rich and poignant melancholy of the theme by a sudden sense of rushing at the end--
26471	26655	26057	26058	the critic	1015	" Here the distinction is obvious . ' Daisy Daydream ' thinks it a great compliment to a hansom cab to be compared to one of the spiral chambers of the sea . And the author of ' Hymns on the Hill ' thinks it a great compliment to the immortal whirlwind to be compared to a hackney coach . He surely is the real admirer of London . We have no space to speak of all his perfect applications of the idea ; of the poem in which , for instance , a lady 's eyes are compared , not to stars , but to two perfect street - lamps guiding the wanderer . We have no space to speak of the fine lyric , recalling the Elizabethan spirit , in which the poet , instead of saying that the rose and the lily contend in her complexion , says , with a purer modernism , that the red omnibus of Hammersmith and the white omnibus of Fulham fight there for the mastery . How perfect the image of two contending omnibuses ! "

Is the normal human need , the normal human condition , higher or lower than those special states of the soul which call out a doubtful and dangerous glory ? those special powers of knowledge or sacrifice which are made possible only by the existence of evil ? Which should come first to our affections , the enduring sanities of peace or the half - maniacal virtues of battle ? Which should come first , the man great in the daily round or the man great in emergency ? Which should come first , to return to the enigma before me , the grocer or the chemist ?

29149	29154	29156	29157	the grocer	2414	" Why , sir , "
29159	29177	29156	29157	the grocer	2414	" that sounds like the times when I was a boy and we used to have elections . "
29178	29185	29187	29187	Wayne	290	" You will have them again , "
29191	29297	29298	29298	he	290	" and far greater things . Listen , Mr. Mead . I know the temptations which a grocer has to a too cosmopolitan philosophy . I can imagine what it must be to sit all day as you do surrounded with wares from all the ends of the earth , from strange seas that we have never sailed and strange forests that we could not even picture . No Eastern king ever had such argosies or such cargoes coming from the sunrise and the sunset , and Solomon in all his glory was not enriched like one of you . India is at your elbow , "
29323	29359	29314	29315	the grocer	2414	" China is before you , Demerara is behind you , America is above your head , and at this very moment , like some old Spanish admiral , you hold Tunis in your hands . "
29394	29693	29381	29381	Wayne	290	" I know , I say , the temptations of so international , so universal a vision of wealth . I know that it must be your danger not to fall like many tradesmen into too dusty and mechanical a narrowness , but rather to be too broad , to be too general , too liberal . If a narrow nationalism be the danger of the pastry - cook , who makes his own wares under his own heavens , no less is cosmopolitanism the danger of the grocer . But I come to you in the name of that patriotism which no wanderings or enlightenments should ever wholly extinguish , and I ask you to remember Notting Hill . For , after all , in this cosmopolitan magnificence , she has played no small part . Your dates may come from the tall palms of Barbary , your sugar from the strange islands of the tropics , your tea from the secret villages of the Empire of the Dragon . That this room might be furnished , forests may have been spoiled under the Southern Cross , and leviathans speared under the Polar Star . But you yourself -- surely no inconsiderable treasure -- you yourself , the brain that wields these vast interests -- you yourself , at least , have grown to strength and wisdom between these grey houses and under this rainy sky . This city which made you , and thus made your fortunes , is threatened with war . Come forth and tell to the ends of the earth this lesson . Oil is from the North and fruits from the South ; rices are from India and spices from Ceylon ; sheep are from New Zealand and men from Notting Hill . "
29732	29741	29730	29730	he	2414	" Anything out of the shop , sir ? "
29769	29772	29773	29773	he	290	" Yes , "
29776	29782	29773	29773	he	290	" I 'll take those . "
29783	29789	29791	29792	the grocer	2414	" All those , sir ? "
29799	29807	29809	29809	Wayne	290	" Yes , yes ; all those , "
29824	29835	29837	29838	the grocer	2414	" Very good , sir ; thank you , sir , "
29842	29852	29837	29838	the grocer	2414	" You may count upon my patriotism , sir . "
29853	29860	29862	29862	Wayne	290	" I count upon it already , "
29884	29892	29893	29893	he	2414	" What a nice fellow he is ! "
29896	29915	29893	29893	he	2414	" It 's odd how often they are nice . Much nicer than those as are all right . "
29930	29937	29938	29938	he	290	" What a weakness it is ! "
29941	30069	29938	29938	he	290	" I have never got rid of it from childhood -- the fear of this magic shop . The grocer is rich , he is romantic , he is poetical in the truest sense , but he is not -- no , he is not supernatural . But the chemist ! All the other shops stand in Notting Hill , but this stands in Elf - land . Look at those great burning bowls of colour . It must be from them that God paints the sunsets . It is superhuman , and the superhuman is all the more uncanny when it is beneficent . That is the root of the fear of God . I am afraid . But I must be a man and enter . "
30104	30111	30112	30112	he	1153	" A fine evening , sir , "
30115	30122	30124	30124	Adam	290	" Fine indeed , strange Father , "
30132	30181	30124	30124	Adam	290	" It is on such clear and mellow nights that your shop is most itself . Then they appear most perfect , those moons of green and gold and crimson , which from afar oft guide the pilgrim of pain and sickness to this house of merciful witchcraft . "
30182	30189	30191	30192	the chemist	1129	" Can I get you anything ? "
30194	30199	30201	30201	Wayne	290	" Let me see , "
30210	30218	30201	30201	Wayne	290	" Let me have some sal volatile . "
30219	30231	30233	30235	the young man	1155	" Eightpence , tenpence , or one and sixpence a bottle ? "
30239	30248	30250	30250	Wayne	290	" One and six -- one and six , "
30257	30271	30250	30250	Wayne	290	" I come to ask you , Mr. Bowles , a terrible question . "
30278	30283	30284	30284	he	290	" It is necessary , "
30285	30303	30250	30250	Wayne	290	muttered--"it is necessary to be tactful , and to suit the appeal to each profession in turn . "
30304	30308	30309	30309	he	290	" I come , "
30313	30338	30340	30340	he	290	" to ask you a question which goes to the roots of your miraculous toils . Mr. Bowles , shall all this witchery cease ? "
30357	30382	30353	30353	he	290	" In Notting Hill we have felt to its core the elfish mystery of your profession . And now Notting Hill itself is threatened . "
30383	30389	30391	30392	the chemist	1129	" Anything more , sir ? "
30394	30397	30399	30399	Wayne	290	" Oh , "
30402	30471	30399	30399	Wayne	290	disturbed--"oh , what is it chemists sell ? Quinine , I think . Thank you . Shall it be destroyed ? I have met these men of Bayswater and North Kensington -- Mr. Bowles , they are materialists . They see no witchery in your work , even when it is wrought within their own borders . They think the chemist is commonplace . They think him human . "
30491	30499	30472	30473	The chemist	1129	" And the next article , please ? "
30500	30503	30505	30506	the Provost	876	" Alum , "
30510	30582	30505	30506	the Provost	876	" I resume . It is in this sacred town alone that your priesthood is reverenced . Therefore , when you fight for us you fight not only for yourself , but for everything you typify . You fight not only for Notting Hill , but for Fairyland , for as surely as Buck and Barker and such men hold sway , the sense of Fairyland in some strange manner diminishes . "
30583	30589	30591	30592	Mr. Bowles	296	" Anything more , sir ? "
30598	30705	30472	30473	The chemist	1129	" Oh yes , jujubes -- Gregory powder -- magnesia . The danger is imminent . In all this matter I have felt that I fought not merely for my own city ( though to that I owe all my blood ) , but for all places in which these great ideas could prevail . I am fighting not merely for Notting Hill , but for Bayswater itself ; for North Kensington itself . For if the gold - hunters prevail , these also will lose all their ancient sentiments and all the mystery of their national soul . I know I can count upon you . "
30706	30712	30714	30715	the chemist	1129	" Oh yes , sir , "
30721	30732	30714	30715	the chemist	1129	" we are always glad to oblige a good customer . "
30749	30755	30756	30756	he	290	" It is so fortunate , "
30759	30798	30756	30756	he	290	" to have tact , to be able to play upon the peculiar talents and specialities , the cosmopolitanism of the grocer and the world - old necromancy of the chemist . Where should I be without tact ? "
30943	30958	30960	30960	Wayne	290	" And how does your commerce go , you strange guardian of the past ? "
30964	30973	30975	30976	the man	574	" Well , sir , not very well , "
30999	31005	30983	30983	his	574	" Things are terribly quiet . "
31012	31017	31018	31018	he	290	" A great saying , "
31021	31236	31018	31018	he	290	" worthy of a man whose merchandise is human history . Terribly quiet ; that is in two words the spirit of this age , as I have felt it from my cradle . I sometimes wondered how many other people felt the oppression of this union between quietude and terror . I see blank well - ordered streets and men in black moving about inoffensively , sullenly . It goes on day after day , day after day , and nothing happens ; but to me it is like a dream from which I might wake screaming . To me the straightness of our life is the straightness of a thin cord stretched tight . Its stillness is terrible . It might snap with a noise like thunder . And you who sit , amid the _ débris _ of the great wars , you who sit , as it were , upon a battlefield , you know that war was less terrible than this evil peace ; you know that the idle lads who carried those swords under Francis or Elizabeth , the rude Squire or Baron who swung that mace about in Picardy or Northumberland battles , may have been terribly noisy , but were not like us , terribly quiet . "
31279	31286	31288	31288	Wayne	290	" But I do not think , "
31290	31438	31288	31288	Wayne	290	" that this horrible silence of modernity will last , though I think for the present it will increase . What a farce is this modern liberality ! Freedom of speech means practically , in our modern civilisation , that we must only talk about unimportant things . We must not talk about religion , for that is illiberal ; we must not talk about bread and cheese , for that is talking shop ; we must not talk about death , for that is depressing ; we must not talk about birth , for that is indelicate . It can not last . Something must break this strange indifference , this strange dreamy egoism , this strange loneliness of millions in a crowd . Something must break it . Why should it not be you and I ? Can you do nothing else but guard relics ? "
31478	31490	31491	31491	he	1177	" I am rather old to go into a new business , "
31494	31507	31491	31491	he	1177	" and I do n't quite know what to be , either . "
31508	31512	31514	31514	Wayne	290	" Why not , "
31524	31530	31514	31514	Wayne	290	persuasion--"why not be a colonel ? "
31631	31636	31638	31639	that artist	1184	" Shaving , sir ? "
31645	31648	31650	31650	Wayne	290	" War ! "
31657	31663	31665	31666	the other	618	" I beg your pardon , "
31670	31673	31675	31675	Wayne	290	" War ! "
31679	31751	31675	31675	Wayne	290	" But not for anything inconsistent with the beautiful and the civilised arts . War for beauty . War for society . War for peace . A great chance is offered you of repelling that slander which , in defiance of the lives of so many artists , attributes poltroonery to those who beautify and polish the surface of our lives . Why should not hairdressers be heroes ? Why should not-- "
31752	31759	31761	31762	the barber	1131	" Now , you get out , "
31766	31781	31761	31762	the barber	1131	" We do n't want any of your sort here . You get out . "
31813	31817	31818	31818	he	290	" Notting Hill , "
31821	31828	31830	31830	he	290	" will need her bolder sons ; "
31934	31939	31941	31941	Wayne	290	" I am afraid , "
31947	31994	31941	31941	Wayne	290	" that I am not getting on with these tradesmen as I should . Is it that I have neglected to rise to the full meaning of their work ? Is there some secret buried in each of these shops which no mere poet can discover ? "
32036	32039	32041	32041	Wayne	290	" Sir , "
32043	32359	32041	32041	Wayne	290	" I am going from house to house in this street of ours , seeking to stir up some sense of the danger which now threatens our city . Nowhere have I felt my duty so difficult as here . For the toy - shop keeper has to do with all that remains to us of Eden before the first wars began . You sit here meditating continually upon the wants of that wonderful time when every staircase leads to the stars , and every garden - path to the other end of nowhere . Is it thoughtlessly , do you think , that I strike the dark old drum of peril in the paradise of children ? But consider a moment ; do not condemn me hastily . Even that paradise itself contains the rumour or beginning of that danger , just as the Eden that was made for perfection contained the terrible tree . For judge childhood , even by your own arsenal of its pleasures . You keep bricks ; you make yourself thus , doubtless , the witness of the constructive instinct older than the destructive . You keep dolls ; you make yourself the priest of that divine idolatry . You keep Noah 's Arks ; you perpetuate the memory of the salvation of all life as a precious , an irreplaceable thing . But do you keep only , sir , the symbols of this prehistoric sanity , this childish rationality of the earth ? Do you not keep more terrible things ? What are those boxes , seemingly of lead soldiers , that I see in that glass case ? Are they not witnesses to that terror and beauty , that desire for a lovely death , which could not be excluded even from the immortality of Eden ? Do not despise the lead soldiers , Mr. Turnbull . "
32360	32365	32367	32368	Mr. Turnbull	298	" I do n't , "
32383	32391	32393	32393	Wayne	290	" I am glad to hear it , "
32395	32538	32393	32393	Wayne	290	" I confess that I feared for my military schemes the awful innocence of your profession . How , I thought to myself , will this man , used only to the wooden swords that give pleasure , think of the steel swords that give pain ? But I am at least partly reassured . Your tone suggests to me that I have at least the entry of a gate of your fairyland -- the gate through which the soldiers enter , for it can not be denied -- I ought , sir , no longer to deny , that it is of soldiers that I come to speak . Let your gentle employment make you merciful towards the troubles of the world . Let your own silvery experience tone down our sanguine sorrows . For there is war in Notting Hill . "
32560	32563	32564	32564	he	1198	" War ? "
32567	32592	32564	32564	he	1198	" Not really , sir ? Is it true ? Oh , what a joke ! Oh , what a sight for sore eyes ! "
32602	32607	32608	32608	he	290	" I am delighted , "
32611	32616	32608	32608	he	290	" I had no notion-- "
32648	32655	32656	32656	he	290	" You look here , sir , "
32659	32665	32656	32656	he	290	" you just look here . "
32685	32692	32693	32693	he	290	" Look at those , sir , "
32713	32728	32704	32704	Wayne	290	" LAST FIGHTING . REDUCTION OF THE CENTRAL DERVISH CITY . REMARKABLE , ETC . "
32734	32752	32732	32732	he	290	" LAST SMALL REPUBLIC ANNEXED . NICARAGUAN CAPITAL SURRENDERS AFTER A MONTH 'S FIGHTING . GREAT SLAUGHTER . "
32779	32788	32789	32789	he	290	" Why do you keep these old things ? "
32802	32812	32789	32789	he	290	" Why do you hang them outside your shop ? "
32813	32816	32818	32819	the other	618	" Because , "
32823	32846	32818	32819	the other	618	" they are the records of the last war . You mentioned war just now . It happens to be my hobby . "
32858	32863	32865	32865	Turnbull	298	" Come with me , "
32948	32956	32958	32958	Turnbull	298	" You are acquainted , no doubt , "
32965	32986	32988	32988	he	298	Wayne--"you are acquainted , no doubt , with the arrangement of the American and Nicaraguan troops in the last battle ; "
32996	33002	33004	33004	Wayne	290	" I am afraid not , "
33006	33008	33004	33004	Wayne	290	" I-- "
33009	33036	33038	33038	he	298	" Ah ! you were at that time occupied too much , perhaps , with the Dervish affair . You will find it in this corner . "
33060	33064	33066	33066	Wayne	290	" You seem , "
33068	33076	33066	33066	Wayne	290	" to be interested in military matters . "
33077	33085	33087	33091	the toy - shop keeper	2510	" I am interested in nothing else , "
33105	33110	33111	33111	he	298	" In that case , "
33114	33137	33111	33111	he	298	" I may approach you with an unusual degree of confidence . Touching the matter of the defence of Notting Hill , I-- "
33138	33153	33155	33155	Turnbull	298	" Defence of Notting Hill ? Yes , sir . This way , sir , "
33161	33169	33171	33171	he	298	" Just step into this side room ; "
33218	33221	33223	33223	Turnbull	298	" Sir , "
33227	33426	33223	33223	Turnbull	298	" you have , by a kind of accident , hit upon the whole secret of my life . As a boy , I grew up among the last wars of the world , when Nicaragua was taken and the dervishes wiped out . And I adopted it as a hobby , sir , as you might adopt astronomy or bird - stuffing . I had no ill - will to any one , but I was interested in war as a science , as a game . And suddenly I was bowled out . The big Powers of the world , having swallowed up all the small ones , came to that confounded agreement , and there was no more war . There was nothing more for me to do but to do what I do now -- to read the old campaigns in dirty old newspapers , and to work them out with tin soldiers . One other thing had occurred to me . I thought it an amusing fancy to make a plan of how this district or ours ought to be defended if it were ever attacked . It seems to interest you too . "
33427	33434	33436	33436	Wayne	290	" If it were ever attacked , "
33445	33556	33436	33436	Wayne	290	" Mr. Turnbull , it is attacked . Thank Heaven , I am bringing to at least one human being the news that is at bottom the only good news to any son of Adam . Your life has not been useless . Your work has not been play . Now , when the hair is already grey on your head , Turnbull , you shall have your youth . God has not destroyed , He has only deferred it . Let us sit down here , and you shall explain to me this military map of Notting Hill . For you and I have to defend Notting Hill together . "
33828	33836	33822	33822	Wayne	280	" Seventeen pounds eight shillings and ninepence . "
33847	33850	33852	33852	Wayne	280	" That , "
33854	33872	33852	33852	Wayne	280	" is not counting the five pounds you took yesterday . What did you do with it ? "
33873	33881	33883	33883	Turnbull	298	" Ah , that is rather interesting ! "
33890	33903	33886	33886	his	298	" I used that five pounds in a kindly and philanthropic act . "
33916	33923	33925	33926	the other	618	" I used that five pounds , "
33928	33943	33925	33926	the other	618	" in giving no less than forty little London boys rides in hansom cabs . "
33944	33949	33951	33952	the Provost	876	" Are you insane ? "
33954	33962	33964	33964	Turnbull	298	" It is only my light touch , "
33966	34049	33964	33964	Turnbull	298	" These hansom - cab rides will raise the tone -- raise the tone , my dear fellow -- of our London youths , widen their horizon , brace their nervous system , make them acquainted with the various public monuments of our great city . Education , Wayne , education . How many excellent thinkers have pointed out that political reform is useless until we produce a cultured populace . So that twenty years hence , when these boys are grown up-- "
34050	34053	34055	34055	Wayne	280	" Mad ! "
34062	34068	34055	34055	Wayne	280	" and five pounds gone ! "
34069	34075	34077	34077	Turnbull	298	" You are in error , "
34079	34268	34269	34269	he	1228	" You grave creatures can never be brought to understand how much quicker work really goes with the assistance of nonsense and good meals . Stripped of its decorative beauties , my statement was strictly accurate . Last night I gave forty half - crowns to forty little boys , and sent them all over London to take hansom cabs . I told them in every case to tell the cabman to bring them to this spot . In half an hour from now the declaration of war will be posted up . At the same time the cabs will have begun to come in , you will have ordered out the guard , the little boys will drive up in state , we shall commandeer the horses for cavalry , use the cabs for barricade , and give the men the choice between serving in our ranks and detention in our basements and cellars . The little boys we can use as scouts . The main thing is that we start the war with an advantage unknown in all the other armies -- horses . And now , "
34276	34285	34269	34269	he	1228	" I will go and drill the troops . "
34706	34711	34713	34713	Auberon	261	" We have met , "
34715	34730	34713	34713	Auberon	261	" to decide the most arduous of modern problems . May we be successful . "
34752	34756	34757	34757	he	287	" Your Majesty , "
34765	34862	34757	34757	he	287	" there is only one thing I ca n't understand , and that is why this affair is not settled in five minutes . Here 's a small property which is worth a thousand to us and is not worth a hundred to any one else . We offer the thousand . It 's not business - like , I know , for we ought to get it for less , and it 's not reasonable and it 's not fair on us , but I 'm damned if I can see why it 's difficult . "
34863	34872	34874	34874	Wayne	280	" The difficulty may be very simply stated , "
34876	34895	34874	34874	Wayne	280	" You may offer a million and it will be very difficult for you to get Pump Street . "
34896	34904	34906	34906	Barker	287	" But look here , Mr. Wayne , "
34917	35008	34906	34906	Barker	287	" Just look here . You 've no right to take up a position like that . You 've a right to stand out for a bigger price , but you are n't doing that . You 're refusing what you and every sane man knows to be a splendid offer simply from malice or spite -- it must be malice or spite . And that kind of thing is really criminal ; it 's against the public good . The King 's Government would be justified in forcing you . "
35031	35039	35040	35040	he	280	" In forcing you ... it would , "
35043	35047	35049	35049	Buck	287	" It shall , "
35061	35071	35049	35049	Buck	287	" We have done our best to be decent . "
35079	35086	35087	35087	he	290	" Was it my Lord Buck , "
35090	35104	35087	35087	he	290	" who said that the King of England ' shall ' do something ? "
35110	35250	35105	35105	Buck	287	" I mean it must -- it ought to . As I say , we 've done our best to be generous ; I defy any one to deny it . As it is , Mr. Wayne , I do n't want to say a word that 's uncivil . I hope it 's not uncivil to say that you can be , and ought to be , in gaol . It is criminal to stop public works for a whim . A man might as well burn ten thousand onions in his front garden or bring up his children to run naked in the street , as do what you say you have a right to do . People have been compelled to sell before now . The King could compel you , and I hope he will . "
35251	35256	35258	35258	Wayne	290	" Until he does , "
35262	35287	35258	35258	Wayne	290	" the power and government of this great nation is on my side and not yours , and I defy you to defy it . "
35288	35293	35295	35295	Barker	287	" In what sense , "
35304	35312	35295	35295	Barker	287	" is the Government on your side ? "
35345	35352	35353	35353	he	290	" The Charter of the Cities , "
35365	35376	35356	35356	Buck	287	" That tomfool 's joke . Have n't we had enough-- "
35377	35383	35385	35385	Wayne	290	" And there you sit , "
35397	35410	35385	35385	Wayne	290	" with no argument but to insult the King before his face . "
35418	35425	35426	35426	he	287	" I am hard to bully , "
35441	35472	35434	35435	the King	1924	" My Lord Buck , I must ask you to remember that your King is present . It is not often that he needs to protect himself among his subjects . "
35481	35494	35495	35495	he	287	" For God 's sake do n't back up the madman now , "
35498	35511	35495	35495	he	287	" Have your joke another time . Oh , for Heaven 's sake-- "
35512	35520	35522	35523	King Auberon	261	" My Lord Provost of South Kensington , "
35527	35599	35522	35523	King Auberon	261	" I do not follow your remarks , which are uttered with a rapidity unusual at Court . Nor do your well - meant efforts to convey the rest with your fingers materially assist me . I say that my Lord Provost of North Kensington , to whom I spoke , ought not in the presence of his Sovereign to speak disrespectfully of his Sovereign 's ordinances . Do you disagree ? "
35621	35631	35613	35614	The King	1924	" My Lord Provost of Notting Hill , proceed . "
35664	35672	35673	35673	he	290	" I am sorry , your Majesty , "
35676	35787	35673	35673	he	290	" I fear I was more than equally to blame with the Lord Provost of North Kensington . We were debating somewhat eagerly , and we both rose to our feet . I did so first , I am ashamed to say . The Provost of North Kensington is , therefore , comparatively innocent . I beseech your Majesty to address your rebuke chiefly , at least , to me . Mr. Buck is not innocent , for he did no doubt , in the heat of the moment , speak disrespectfully . But the rest of the discussion he seems to me to have conducted with great good temper . "
35831	35843	35845	35845	Buck	273	" This very kind speech of the Provost of Notting Hill , "
35849	35928	35845	35845	Buck	273	" seems to me to show that we have at least got on to a friendly footing . Now come , Mr. Wayne . Five hundred pounds have been offered to you for a property you admit not to be worth a hundred . Well , I am a rich man and I wo n't be outdone in generosity . Let us say fifteen hundred pounds , and have done with it . And let us shake hands ; "
35937	35942	35944	35947	Mr. Wilson of Bayswater	274	" Fifteen hundred pounds , "
35949	35957	35944	35947	Mr. Wilson of Bayswater	274	" can we do fifteen hundred pounds ? "
35958	35965	35967	35967	Buck	273	" I 'll stand the racket , "
35971	35994	35967	35967	Buck	273	" Mr. Wayne is a gentleman and has spoken up for me . So I suppose the negotiations are at an end . "
35998	36017	35944	35947	Mr. Wilson of Bayswater	274	" They are indeed at an end . I am sorry I can not sell you the property . "
36018	36021	36023	36024	Mr. Barker	247	" What ? "
36031	36038	36040	36041	the King	1924	" Mr. Buck has spoken correctly , "
36043	36050	36052	36052	Buck	273	" I have , I have , "
36058	36061	36052	36052	Buck	273	" I said-- "
36062	36069	36071	36072	the King	1924	" Mr. Buck has spoken correctly , "
36074	36082	36071	36072	the King	1924	" the negotiations are at an end . "
36100	36106	36107	36107	he	290	" Have I , then , "
36110	36125	36107	36107	he	290	" your Majesty 's permission to depart ? I have given my last answer . "
36126	36131	36133	36133	Auberon	261	" You have it , "
36162	36165	36167	36167	Wilson	274	" Well ? "
36172	36174	36167	36167	Wilson	274	Barker--"well ? "
36181	36191	36192	36192	he	247	" The man ought to be in an asylum , "
36195	36218	36192	36192	he	247	" But one thing is clear -- we need not bother further about him . The man can be treated as mad . "
36219	36223	36225	36225	Buck	273	" Of course , "
36234	36405	36225	36225	Buck	273	" You 're perfectly right , Barker . He is a good enough fellow , but he can be treated as mad . Let 's put it in simple form . Go and tell any twelve men in any town , go and tell any doctor in any town , that there is a man offered fifteen hundred pounds for a thing he could sell commonly for four hundred , and that when asked for a reason for not accepting it he pleads the inviolate sanctity of Notting Hill and calls it the Holy Mountain . What would they say ? What more can we have on our side than the common sense of everybody ? On what else do all laws rest ? I 'll tell you , Barker , what 's better than any further discussion . Let 's send in workmen on the spot to pull down Pump Street . And if old Wayne says a word , arrest him as a lunatic . That 's all . "
36411	36439	36406	36406	Barker	247	" I always regarded you , Buck , if you do n't mind my saying so , as a very strong man . I 'll follow you . "
36440	36449	36451	36451	Wilson	274	" So , of course , will I , "
36458	36462	36463	36463	he	273	" Your Majesty , "
36470	36571	36463	36463	he	273	" I beseech your Majesty to consider favourably the proposal to which we have committed ourselves . Your Majesty 's leniency , our own offers , have fallen in vain on that extraordinary man . He may be right . He may be God . He may be the devil . But we think it , for practical purposes , more probable that he is off his head . Unless that assumption were acted on , all human affairs would go to pieces . We act on it , and we propose to start operations in Notting Hill at once . "
36580	36588	36589	36589	he	1924	" The Charter of the Cities ... , "
36617	36621	36622	36622	he	1924	" Your Majesty , "
36627	36790	36622	36622	he	1924	" I am not here to say a word against anything your Majesty has said or done . You are a far better educated man than I , and no doubt there were reasons , upon intellectual grounds , for those proceedings . But may I ask you and appeal to your common good - nature for a sincere answer ? When you drew up the Charter of the Cities , did you contemplate the rise of a man like Adam Wayne ? Did you expect that the Charter -- whether it was an experiment , or a scheme of decoration , or a joke -- could ever really come to this -- to stopping a vast scheme of ordinary business , to shutting up a road , to spoiling the chances of cabs , omnibuses , railway stations , to disorganising half a city , to risking a kind of civil war ? Whatever were your objects , were they that ? "
36805	36809	36811	36811	Auberon	261	" Provost Buck , "
36813	36856	36811	36811	Auberon	261	" you speak in public uncommonly well . I give you your point with the magnanimity of an artist . My scheme did not include the appearance of Mr. Wayne . Alas ! would that my poetic power had been great enough . "
36857	36863	36865	36865	Buck	307	" I thank your Majesty , "
36872	36953	36865	36865	Buck	307	" Your Majesty 's statements are always clear and studied ; therefore I may draw a deduction . As the scheme , whatever it was , on which you set your heart did not include the appearance of Mr. Wayne , it will survive his removal . Why not let us clear away this particular Pump Street , which does interfere with our plans , and which does not , by your Majesty 's own statement , interfere with yours . "
36954	36958	36960	36961	the King	1924	" Caught out ! "
36977	36982	36984	36984	Buck	307	" This man Wayne , "
36986	37171	36984	36984	Buck	307	" would be shut up by any doctors in England . But we only ask to have it put before them . Meanwhile no one 's interests , not even in all probability his own , can be really damaged by going on with the improvements in Notting Hill . Not our interests , of course , for it has been the hard and quiet work of ten years . Not the interests of Notting Hill , for nearly all its educated inhabitants desire the change . Not the interests of your Majesty , for you say , with characteristic sense , that you never contemplated the rise of the lunatic at all . Not , as I say , his own interests , for the man has a kind heart and many talents , and a couple of good doctors would probably put him righter than all the free cities and sacred mountains in creation . I therefore assume , if I may use so bold a word , that your Majesty will not offer any obstacle to our proceeding with the improvements . "
37186	37190	37192	37193	the King	1924	" Mr. Buck , "
37195	37266	37192	37193	the King	1924	" I beg your pardon , for a number of beautiful and sacred thoughts , in which you were generally classified as a fool . But there is another thing to be considered . Suppose you send in your workmen , and Mr. Wayne does a thing regrettable indeed , but of which , I am sorry to say , I think him quite capable -- knocks their teeth out ? "
37267	37277	37279	37280	Mr. Buck	273	" I have thought of that , your Majesty , "
37284	37317	37319	37319	he	273	" and I think it can simply be guarded against . Let us send in a strong guard of , say , a hundred men -- a hundred of the North Kensington Halberdiers "
37324	37356	37319	37319	he	273	" of whom your Majesty is so fond . Or say a hundred and fifty . The whole population of Pump Street , I fancy , is only about a hundred . "
37357	37367	37369	37370	the King	1924	" Still they might stand together and lick you , "
37374	37380	37382	37382	Buck	273	" Then say two hundred , "
37386	37391	37393	37394	the King	1924	" It might happen , "
37398	37410	37393	37394	the King	1924	" that one Notting Hiller fought better than two North Kensingtons . "
37411	37415	37417	37417	Buck	273	" It might , "
37421	37429	37417	37417	Buck	273	" then say two hundred and fifty . "
37436	37444	37445	37445	he	1924	" And if they are beaten too ? "
37449	37453	37455	37455	Buck	273	" Your Majesty , "
37465	37595	37455	37455	Buck	273	" suppose they are . If anything be clear , it is clear that all fighting matters are mere matters of arithmetic . Here we have a hundred and fifty , say , of Notting Hill soldiers . Or say two hundred . If one of them can fight two of us -- we can send in , not four hundred , but six hundred , and smash him . That is all . It is out of all immediate probability that one of them could fight four of us . So what I say is this . Run no risks . Finish it at once . Send in eight hundred men and smash him -- smash him almost without seeing him . And go on with the improvements . "
37608	37616	37618	37619	the King	1924	" Do you know , Mr. Buck , "
37627	37679	37618	37619	the King	1924	" the admirable clearness of your reason produces in my mind a sentiment which I trust I shall not offend you by describing as an aspiration to punch your head . You irritate me sublimely . What can it be in me ? Is it the relic of a moral sense ? "
37680	37685	37687	37687	Barker	247	" But your Majesty , "
37693	37700	37687	37687	Barker	247	" does not refuse our proposals ? "
37701	37735	37618	37619	the King	1924	" My dear Barker , your proposals are as damnable as your manners . I want to have nothing to do with them . Suppose I stopped them altogether . What would happen ? "
37743	37746	37736	37736	Barker	247	" Revolution . "
37782	37785	37786	37786	he	1924	" Gentlemen , "
37789	37861	37786	37786	he	1924	" you have overruled me . Therefore I can speak plainly . I think Adam Wayne , who is as mad as a hatter , worth more than a million of you . But you have the force , and , I admit , the common sense , and he is lost . Take your eight hundred halberdiers and smash him . It would be more sportsmanlike to take two hundred . "
37862	37866	37868	37868	Buck	273	" More sportsmanlike , "
37872	37900	37868	37868	Buck	273	" but a great deal less humane . We are not artists , and streets purple with gore do not catch our eye in the right way . "
37901	37906	37908	37908	Auberon	261	" It is pitiful , "
37910	37927	37908	37908	Auberon	261	" With five or six times their number , there will be no fight at all . "
37928	37933	37935	37935	Buck	273	" I hope not , "
37943	37958	37935	37935	Buck	273	" We desire no fight , your Majesty . We are peaceable business men . "
37959	37962	37964	37965	the King	1924	" Well , "
37969	37979	37964	37965	the King	1924	" the conference is at an end at last . "
38067	38070	38071	38071	he	1924	" Barker , "
38078	38233	38071	38071	he	1924	" you are an old friend of mine -- you understand my hobbies as I understand yours . Why ca n't you let it alone ? I hoped that such fun might come out of this Wayne business . Why ca n't you let it alone ? It does n't really so much matter to you -- what 's a road or so ? For me it 's the one joke that may save me from pessimism . Take fewer men and give me an hour 's fun . Really and truly , James , if you collected coins or humming - birds , and I could buy one with the price of your road , I would buy it . I collect incidents -- those rare , those precious things . Let me have one . Pay a few pounds for it . Give these Notting Hillers a chance . Let them alone . "
38234	38237	38239	38239	Barker	247	" Auberon , "
38254	38352	38239	38239	Barker	247	" I do feel what you mean . I have had moments when these hobbies have hit me . I have had moments when I have sympathised with your humours . I have had moments , though you may not easily believe it , when I have sympathised with the madness of Adam Wayne . But the world , Auberon , the real world , is not run on these hobbies . It goes on great brutal wheels of facts -- wheels on which you are the butterfly ; and Wayne is the fly on the wheel . "
38363	38432	38353	38353	Auberon	261	" Thank you , James ; what you say is true . It is only a parenthetical consolation to me to compare the intelligence of flies somewhat favourably with the intelligence of wheels . But it is the nature of flies to die soon , and the nature of wheels to go on for ever . Go on with the wheel . Good - bye , old man . "
38490	38497	38498	38498	he	1924	" In a world without humour , "
38501	38656	38657	38657	He	1924	" the only thing to do is to eat . And how perfect an exception ! How can these people strike dignified attitudes , and pretend that things matter , when the total ludicrousness of life is proved by the very method by which it is supported ? A man strikes the lyre , and says , ' Life is real , life is earnest , ' and then goes into a room and stuffs alien substances into a hole in his head . I think Nature was indeed a little broad in her humour in these matters . But we all fall back on the pantomime , as I have in this municipal affair . Nature has her farces , like the act of eating or the shape of the kangaroo , for the more brutal appetite . She keeps her stars and mountains for those who can appreciate something more subtly ridiculous . "
38663	38717	38657	38657	He	1924	" But , as I said ' eating , ' let us have a picnic like two nice little children . Just run and bring me a table and a dozen courses or so , and plenty of champagne , and under these swinging boughs , Bowler , we will return to Nature . "
38812	38821	38822	38822	he	1924	" Things take too long in this world , "
38825	38911	38822	38822	he	1924	" I detest all this Barkerian business about evolution and the gradual modification of things . I wish the world had been made in six days , and knocked to pieces again in six more . And I wish I had done it . The joke 's good enough in a broad way , sun and moon and the image of God , and all that , but they keep it up so damnably long . Did you ever long for a miracle , Bowler ? "
38912	38917	38919	38919	Bowler	255	" No , sir , "
38933	38938	38940	38941	the King	1924	" Then I have , "
38943	39087	38940	38941	the King	1924	" I have walked along a street with the best cigar in the cosmos in my mouth , and more Burgundy inside me than you ever saw in your life , and longed that the lamp - post would turn into an elephant to save me from the hell of blank existence . Take my word for it , my evolutionary Bowler , do n't you believe people when they tell you that people sought for a sign , and believed in miracles because they were ignorant . They did it because they were wise , filthily , vilely wise -- too wise to eat or sleep or put on their boots with patience . This seems delightfully like a new theory of the origin of Christianity , which would itself be a thing of no mean absurdity . Take some more wine . "
39153	39342	39138	39139	The King	1924	" Yesterday I thought that something next door to a really entertaining miracle might happen to me before I went to amuse the worms . To see that red - haired maniac waving a great sword , and making speeches to his incomparable followers , would have been a glimpse of that Land of Youth from which the Fates shut us out . I had planned some quite delightful things . A Congress of Knightsbridge with a treaty , and myself in the chair , and perhaps a Roman triumph , with jolly old Barker led in chains . And now these wretched prigs have gone and stamped out the exquisite Mr. Wayne altogether , and I suppose they will put him in a private asylum somewhere in their damned humane way . Think of the treasures daily poured out to his unappreciative keeper ! I wonder whether they would let me be his keeper . But life is a vale . Never forget at any moment of your existence to regard it in the light of a vale . This graceful habit , if not acquired in youth-- "
39639	39645	39630	39631	the King	1924	" like a captured bride . "
39780	39783	39784	39784	he	1924	" Barker , "
39787	39793	39776	39776	he	1924	" what is all this ? "
39794	39797	39799	39800	the politician--"beaten	2720	" Beaten , "
39800	39805	39807	39807	he	1924	politician--"beaten all to hell ! "
40277	40282	40284	40285	the draper	851	" Hullo , Barker ! "
40287	40311	40284	40285	the draper	851	" Any of our summer articles ? You 're too late . Factory Acts , Barker . Humanity and progress , my boy . "
40312	40319	40321	40321	Barker	247	" Oh , do n't chatter , "
40325	40331	40321	40321	Barker	247	" We 've been beaten . "
40332	40338	40340	40340	Buck	273	" Beaten -- by what ? "
40344	40348	40284	40285	the draper	851	" By Wayne . "
40369	40376	40377	40377	he	273	" Come and have a drink , "
40408	40413	40414	40414	he	273	" Have a smoke , "
40454	40460	40462	40462	Buck	273	" How did it happen ? "
40472	40480	40482	40482	Barker	247	" How the devil do I know ? "
40484	40506	40482	40482	Barker	247	" It happened like -- like a dream . How can two hundred men beat six hundred ? How can they ? "
40507	40510	40512	40512	Buck	273	" Well , "
40516	40526	40512	40512	Buck	273	" how did they ? You ought to know . "
40527	40538	40540	40541	the other	618	" I do n't know ; I ca n't describe , "
40548	40741	40540	40541	the other	618	" It seemed like this . We were six hundred , and marched with those damned poleaxes of Auberon's -- the only weapons we 've got . We marched two abreast . We went up Holland Walk , between the high palings which seemed to me to go straight as an arrow for Pump Street . I was near the tail of the line , and it was a long one . When the end of it was still between the high palings , the head of the line was already crossing Holland Park Avenue . Then the head plunged into the network of narrow streets on the other side , and the tail and myself came out on the great crossing . When we also had reached the northern side and turned up a small street that points , crookedly as it were , towards Pump Street , the whole thing felt different . The streets dodged and bent so much that the head of our line seemed lost altogether : it might as well have been in North America . And all this time we had n't seen a soul . "
40789	41044	40753	40753	Buck	273	" But though the little streets were all deserted ( which got a trifle on my nerves ) , as we got deeper and deeper into them , a thing began to happen that I could n't understand . Sometimes a long way ahead -- three turns or corners ahead , as it were -- there broke suddenly a sort of noise , clattering , and confused cries , and then stopped . Then , when it happened , something , I ca n't describe it -- a kind of shake or stagger went down the line , as if the line were a live thing , whose head had been struck , or had been an electric cord . None of us knew why we were moving , but we moved and jostled . Then we recovered , and went on through the little dirty streets , round corners , and up twisted ways . The little crooked streets began to give me a feeling I ca n't explain -- as if it were a dream . I felt as if things had lost their reason , and we should never get out of the maze . Odd to hear me talk like that , is n't it ? The streets were quite well - known streets , all down on the map . But the fact remains . I was n't afraid of something happening . I was afraid of nothing ever happening -- nothing ever happening for all God 's eternity . "
41063	41099	41055	41055	He	1339	" And then something did happen . Buck , it 's the solemn truth , that nothing has ever happened to you in your life . Nothing had ever happened to me in my life . "
41100	41105	41107	41107	Buck	273	" Nothing ever happened ! "
41111	41117	41107	41107	Buck	273	" What do you mean ? "
41118	41124	41126	41126	Barker	247	" Nothing has ever happened , "
41133	41210	41212	41212	he	247	" You do n't know what a thing happening means ? You sit in your office expecting customers , and customers come ; you walk in the street expecting friends , and friends meet you ; you want a drink , and get it ; you feel inclined for a bet , and make it . You expect either to win or lose , and you do either one or the other . But things happening ! "
41216	41220	41222	41222	Buck	273	" Go on , "
41226	41230	41222	41222	Buck	273	" Get on . "
41231	41362	41126	41126	Barker	247	" As we walked wearily round the corners , something happened . When something happens , it happens first , and you see it afterwards . It happens of itself , and you have nothing to do with it . It proves a dreadful thing -- that there are other things besides one 's self . I can only put it in this way . We went round one turning , two turnings , three turnings , four turnings , five . Then I lifted myself slowly up from the gutter where I had been shot half senseless , and was beaten down again by living men crashing on top of me , and the world was full of roaring , and big men rolling about like nine - pins . "
41372	41378	41379	41379	he	273	" Was that Portobello Road ? "
41382	41385	41222	41222	Buck	273	" Yes , "
41387	41465	41222	41222	Buck	273	Barker--"yes ; Portobello Road . I saw it afterwards ; but , my God , what a place it was ! Buck , have you ever stood and let a six foot of man lash and lash at your head with six feet of pole with six pounds of steel at the end ? Because , when you have had that experience , as Walt Whitman says , ' you re - examine philosophies and religions . ' "
41466	41472	41474	41474	Buck	273	" I have no doubt , "
41476	41490	41474	41474	Buck	273	" If that was Portobello Road , do n't you see what happened ? "
41491	41654	41222	41222	Buck	273	" I know what happened exceedingly well . I was knocked down four times ; an experience which , as I say , has an effect on the mental attitude . And another thing happened , too . I knocked down two men . After the fourth fall ( there was not much bloodshed -- more brutal rushing and throwing -- for nobody could use their weapons ) , after the fourth fall , I say , I got up like a devil , and I tore a poleaxe out of a man 's hand and struck where I saw the scarlet of Wayne 's fellows , struck again and again . Two of them went over , bleeding on the stones , thank God ; and I laughed and found myself sprawling in the gutter again , and got up again , and struck again , and broke my halberd to pieces . I hurt a man 's head , though . "
41673	41679	41681	41681	Barker	247	" What is the matter ? "
41707	41711	41713	41713	Buck	273	" The matter ? "
41717	41884	41713	41713	Buck	273	" do n't you see how these maniacs have got us ? Why should two idiots , one a clown and the other a screaming lunatic , make sane men so different from themselves ? Look here , Barker ; I will give you a picture . A very well - bred young man of this century is dancing about in a frock - coat . He has in his hands a nonsensical seventeenth - century halberd , with which he is trying to kill men in a street in Notting Hill . Damn it ! do n't you see how they 've got us ? Never mind how you felt -- that is how you looked . The King would put his cursed head on one side and call it exquisite . The Provost of Notting Hill would put his cursed nose in the air and call it heroic . But in Heaven 's name what would you have called it -- two days before ? "
41890	41900	41901	41901	he	247	" You have n't been through it , Buck , "
41904	41914	41901	41901	he	247	" You do n't understand fighting -- the atmosphere . "
41915	41923	41925	41925	Buck	273	" I do n't deny the atmosphere , "
41931	41965	41925	41925	Buck	273	" I only say it 's their atmosphere . It 's Adam Wayne 's atmosphere . It 's the atmosphere which you and I thought had vanished from an educated world for ever . "
41966	41973	41975	41975	Barker	247	" Well , it has n't , "
41977	41997	41975	41975	Barker	247	" and if you have any lingering doubts , lend me a poleaxe , and I 'll show you . "
42040	42043	42044	42044	he	247	" Barker , "
42047	42290	42044	42044	he	247	" you are right . This old thing -- this fighting , has come back . It has come back suddenly and taken us by surprise . So it is first blood to Adam Wayne . But , unless reason and arithmetic and everything else have gone crazy , it must be next and last blood to us . But when an issue has really arisen , there is only one thing to do -- to study that issue as such and win in it . Barker , since it is fighting , we must understand fighting . I must understand fighting as coolly and completely as I understand drapery ; you must understand fighting as coolly and completely as you understand politics . Now , look at the facts . I stick without hesitation to my original formula . Fighting , when we have the stronger force , is only a matter of arithmetic . It must be . You asked me just now how two hundred men could defeat six hundred . I can tell you . Two hundred men can defeat six hundred when the six hundred behave like fools . When they forget the very conditions they are fighting in ; when they fight in a swamp as if it were a mountain ; when they fight in a forest as if it were a plain ; when they fight in streets without remembering the object of streets . "
42291	42299	42301	42301	Barker	247	" What is the object of streets ? "
42303	42311	42313	42313	Buck	273	" What is the object of supper ? "
42317	42486	42313	42313	Buck	273	" Is n't it obvious ? This military science is mere common sense . The object of a street is to lead from one place to another ; therefore all streets join ; therefore street fighting is quite a peculiar thing . You advanced into that hive of streets as if you were advancing into an open plain where you could see everything . Instead of that , you were advancing into the bowels of a fortress , with streets pointing at you , streets turning on you , streets jumping out at you , and all in the hands of the enemy . Do you know what Portobello Road is ? It is the only point on your journey where two side streets run up opposite each other . Wayne massed his men on the two sides , and when he had let enough of your line go past , cut it in two like a worm . Do n't you see what would have saved you ? "
42492	42502	42504	42504	Buck	273	" Ca n't your ' atmosphere ' help you ? "
42508	42588	42504	42504	Buck	273	" Must I attempt explanations in the romantic manner ? Suppose that , as you were fighting blindly with the red Notting Hillers who imprisoned you on both sides , you had heard a shout from behind them . Suppose , oh , romantic Barker ! that behind the red tunics you had seen the blue and gold of South Kensington taking them in the rear , surrounding them in their turn and hurling them on to your halberds . "
42589	42597	42599	42599	Barker	247	" If the thing had been possible , "
42603	42612	42614	42614	Buck	273	" The thing would have been as possible , "
42618	42733	42614	42614	Buck	273	" as simple as arithmetic . There are a certain number of street entries that lead to Pump Street . There are not nine hundred ; there are not nine million . They do not grow in the night . They do not increase like mushrooms . It must be possible , with such an overwhelming force as we have , to advance by all of them at once . In every one of the arteries , or approaches , we can put almost as many men as Wayne can put into the field altogether . Once do that , and we have him to demonstration . It is like a proposition of Euclid . "
42734	42741	42743	42743	Barker	247	" You think that is certain ? "
42751	42760	42762	42762	Buck	273	" I 'll tell you what I think , "
42768	42790	42762	42762	Buck	273	" I think Adam Wayne made an uncommonly spirited little fight ; and I think I am confoundedly sorry for him . "
42791	42800	42802	42802	Barker	247	" Buck , you are a great man ! "
42807	42890	42802	42802	Barker	247	" You 've knocked me sensible again . I am ashamed to say it , but I was getting romantic . Of course , what you say is adamantine sense . Fighting , being physical , must be mathematical . We were beaten because we were neither mathematical nor physical nor anything else -- because we deserved to be beaten . Hold all the approaches , and with our force we must have him . When shall we open the next campaign ? "
42891	42894	42896	42896	Buck	273	" Now , "
42905	42908	42910	42910	Barker	247	" Now ! "
42916	42927	42910	42910	Barker	247	" Do you mean now ? It is so late . "
42935	42946	42947	42947	he	273	" Do you think fighting is under the Factory Acts ? "
42956	42962	42963	42963	he	273	" Notting Hill Gate Station , "
43190	43197	43198	43198	he	273	" There is no such thing , "
43201	43447	43198	43198	he	273	" as night in London . You have only to follow the line of street lamps . Look , here is the map . Two hundred purple North Kensington soldiers under myself march up Ossington Street , two hundred more under Captain Bruce , of the North Kensington Guard , up Clanricarde Gardens.[1 ] Two hundred yellow West Kensingtons under Provost Swindon attack from Pembridge Road . Two hundred more of my men from the eastern streets , leading away from Queen 's Road . Two detachments of yellows enter by two roads from Westbourne Grove . Lastly , two hundred green Bayswaters come down from the North through Chepstow Place , and two hundred more under Provost Wilson himself , through the upper part of Pembridge Road . Gentlemen , it is mate in two moves . The enemy must either mass in Pump Street and be cut to pieces ; or they must retreat past the Gaslight & Coke Co. , and rush on my four hundred ; or they must retreat past St. Luke 's Church , and rush on the six hundred from the West . Unless we are all mad , it 's plain . Come on . To your quarters and await Captain Brace 's signal to advance . Then you have only to walk up a line of gas - lamps and smash this nonsense by pure mathematics . To - morrow we shall all be civilians again . "
43769	43775	43777	43777	Buck	273	" Halt -- point arms ! "
43819	43825	43826	43826	he	273	" Victory , Mr. Buck ! "
43831	43845	43826	43826	he	273	" they are ousted . Provost Wilson of Bayswater has taken Pump Street . "
43853	43920	43846	43846	Buck	273	" Then , which way are they retreating ? It must be either by St. Luke 's to meet Swindon , or by the Gas Company to meet us . Run like mad to Swindon , and see that the yellows are holding the St. Luke 's Road . We will hold this , never fear . We have them in an iron trap . Run ! "
43986	43990	43991	43991	he	273	" Mr. Provost , "
43994	44036	43991	43991	he	273	" the yellow West Kensingtons have been holding the road by St. Luke 's for twenty minutes since the capture of Pump Street . Pump Street is not two hundred yards away ; they can not be retreating down that road . "
44037	44045	44047	44048	Provost Buck	307	" Then they are retreating down this , "
44055	44074	44047	44048	Provost Buck	307	" and by good fortune down a well - lighted road , though it twists about . Forward ! "
44127	44140	44141	44141	he	307	" I am sorry for poor old Wayne , I really am , "
44144	44361	44141	44141	he	307	" He spoke up splendidly for me at that Council . And he blacked old Barker 's eye with considerable spirit . But I do n't see what a man can expect when he fights against arithmetic , to say nothing of civilisation . And what a wonderful hoax all this military genius is ! I suspect I 've just discovered what Cromwell discovered , that a sensible tradesman is the best general , and that a man who can buy men and sell men can lead and kill them . The thing 's simply like adding up a column in a ledger . If Wayne has two hundred men , he ca n't put two hundred men in nine places at once . If they 're ousted from Pump Street they 're flying somewhere . If they 're not flying past the church they 're flying past the Works . And so we have them . We business men should have no chance at all except that cleverer people than we get bees in their bonnets that prevent them from reasoning properly -- so we reason alone . And so I , who am comparatively stupid , see things as God sees them , as a vast machine . My God , what 's this ? "
44384	44395	44378	44378	he	1371	" Did I blaspheme God ? I am struck blind . "
44396	44399	44378	44378	he	1371	" What ? "
44417	44420	44422	44422	Buck	307	" Blind ! "
44424	44427	44422	44422	Buck	307	" blind ! "
44428	44434	44436	44436	Jarvis	265	" I 'm blind too ! "
44442	44449	44422	44422	Buck	307	" Fools , all of you , "
44457	44469	44422	44422	Buck	307	" we 're all blind . The lamps have gone out . "
44470	44479	44481	44481	Buck	307	" The lamps ! But why ? where ? "
44489	44510	44481	44481	Buck	307	" How are we to get on ? How are we to chase the enemy ? Where have they gone ? "
44511	44515	44517	44520	the rough voice behind	1373	" The enemy went-- "
44527	44530	44532	44532	Buck	307	" Where ? "
44539	44543	44545	44547	the gruff voice	1375	" They went , "
44549	44562	44545	44547	the gruff voice	1375	" past the Gas Works , and they 've used their chance . "
44563	44567	44569	44569	Buck	307	" Great God ! "
44577	44585	44569	44569	Buck	307	" do you mean they 've turned out-- "
44611	44618	44628	44628	they	1377	" Notting Hill ! Notting Hill ! "

In our present state of information , it would be premature ( what a jolly word!)--it would be premature to cast any reflections upon the conduct of General Buck , whose services upon so many stricken fields ( ha , ha ! ) , and whose honourable scars and laurels , give him a right to have judgment upon him at least suspended . But there is one matter on which we must speak plainly . We have been silent on it too long , from feelings , perhaps of mistaken caution , perhaps of mistaken loyalty . This situation would never have arisen but for what we can only call the indefensible conduct of the King . It pains us to say such things , but , speaking as we do in the public interests ( I plagiarise from Barker 's famous epigram ) , we shall not shrink because of the distress we may cause to any individual , even the most exalted . At this crucial moment of our country , the voice of the People demands with a single tongue , ' Where is the King ? ' What is he doing while his subjects tear each other in pieces in the streets of a great city ? Are his amusements and his dissipations ( of which we can not pretend to be ignorant ) so engrossing that he can spare no thought for a perishing nation ? It is with a deep sense of our responsibility that we warn that exalted person that neither his great position nor his incomparable talents will save him in the hour of delirium from the fate of all those who , in the madness of luxury or tyranny , have met the English people in the rare day of its wrath . "

Now we stick to a thing and get it . And our mistakes help us . Look here ! at this moment we 've beaten Wayne . "

Has it occurred to you , my brilliant Barker , that another singular event has happened since that singular event of the lamps going out ? "
47348	47352	47354	47354	Barker	247	" What event ? "

47427	47534	47535	47535	he	247	" It is a gratification to me , my dear Buck , to be able to say that we anticipated your suggestions precisely . We went as early as possible to reconnoitre the nine entrances . Unfortunately , while we were fighting each other in the dark , like a lot of drunken navvies , Mr. Wayne 's friends were working very hard indeed . Three hundred yards from Pump Street , at every one of those entrances , there is a barricade nearly as high as the houses . They were finishing the last , in Pembridge Road , when we arrived . Our mistakes , "

47590	47650	47587	47587	Barker	247	" Buck , does it ever cross your mind what this is all about ? The Hammersmith to Maida Vale thoroughfare was an uncommonly good speculation . You and I hoped a great deal from it . But is it worth it ? It will cost us thousands to crush this ridiculous riot . Suppose we let it alone ? "
47651	47671	47674	47674	Buck	320	" And be thrashed in public by a red - haired madman whom any two doctors would lock up ? "

To clasp to your bosom the flag of the Red Lion ? To kiss in succession every sacred lamp - post that saved Notting Hill ? No , by God ! My men fought jolly well -- they were beaten by a trick .

47803	47906	47798	47798	Barker	247	" that we had all got into Adam Wayne 's atmosphere and out of our own . My friend , the whole territorial kingdom of Adam Wayne extends to about nine streets , with barricades at the end of them . But the spiritual kingdom of Adam Wayne extends , God knows where -- it extends to this office , at any rate . The red - haired madman whom any two doctors would lock up is filling this room with his roaring , unreasonable soul . And it was the red - haired madman who said the last word you spoke . "

48911	49024	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" Morning winked a little wearily at me over the curt edge of Campden Hill and its houses with their sharp shadows . Under the abrupt black cardboard of the outline , it took some little time to detect colours ; but at length I saw a brownish yellow shifting in the obscurity , and I knew that it was the guard of Swindon 's West Kensington army . They are being held as a reserve , and lining the whole ridge above the Bayswater Road . Their camp and their main force is under the great Waterworks Tower on Campden Hill . I forgot to say that the Waterworks Tower looked swart .
49025	49209	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" As I passed them and came over the curve of Silver Street , I saw the blue cloudy masses of Barker 's men blocking the entrance to the high - road like a sapphire smoke ( good ) . The disposition of the allied troops , under the general management of Mr. Wilson , appears to be as follows : The Yellow army ( if I may so describe the West Kensingtonians ) lies , as I have said , in a strip along the ridge , its furthest point westward being the west side of Campden Hill Road , its furthest point eastward the beginning of Kensington Gardens . The Green army of Wilson lines the Notting Hill High Road itself from Queen 's Road to the corner of Pembridge Road , curving round the latter , and extending some three hundred yards up towards Westbourne Grove . Westbourne Grove itself is occupied by Barker of South Kensington . The fourth side of this rough square , the Queen 's Road side , is held by some of Buck 's Purple warriors .
49210	49364	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" The whole resembles some ancient and dainty Dutch flower - bed . Along the crest of Campden Hill lie the golden crocuses of West Kensington . They are , as it were , the first fiery fringe of the whole . Northward lies our hyacinth Barker , with all his blue hyacinths . Round to the south - west run the green rushes of Wilson of Bayswater , and a line of violet irises ( aptly symbolised by Mr. Buck ) complete the whole . The argent exterior ... ( I am losing the style . I should have said ' Curving with a whisk ' instead of merely ' Curving . ' Also I should have called the hyacinths ' sudden . ' I can not keep this up . War is too rapid for this style of writing . Please ask office - boy to insert _ mots justes _ . )
49365	49623	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" The truth is that there is nothing to report . That commonplace element which is always ready to devour all beautiful things ( as the Black Pig in the Irish Mythology will finally devour the stars and gods ) ; that commonplace element , as I say , has in its Black Piggish way devoured finally the chances of any romance in this affair ; that which once consisted of absurd but thrilling combats in the streets , has degenerated into something which is the very prose of warfare -- it has degenerated into a siege . A siege may be defined as a peace plus the inconvenience of war . Of course Wayne can not hold out . There is no more chance of help from anywhere else than of ships from the moon . And if old Wayne had stocked his street with tinned meats till all his garrison had to sit on them , he could n't hold out for more than a month or two . As a matter of melancholy fact , he has done something rather like this . He has stocked his street with food until there must be uncommonly little room to turn round . But what is the good ? To hold out for all that time and then to give in of necessity , what does it mean ? It means waiting until your victories are forgotten , and then taking the trouble to be defeated . I can not understand how Wayne can be so inartistic .
49624	49756	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" And how odd it is that one views a thing quite differently when one knows it is defeated ! I always thought Wayne was rather fine . But now , when I know that he is done for , there seem to be nothing else but Wayne . All the streets seem to point at him , all the chimneys seem to lean towards him . I suppose it is a morbid feeling ; but Pump Street seems to be the only part of London that I feel physically . I suppose , I say , that it is morbid . I suppose it is exactly how a man feels about his heart when his heart is weak . ' Pump Street'--the heart is a pump . And I am drivelling .
49757	49879	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" Our finest leader at the front is , beyond all question , General Wilson . He has adopted alone among the other Provosts the uniform of his own halberdiers , although that fine old sixteenth - century garb was not originally intended to go with red side - whiskers . It was he who , against a most admirable and desperate defence , broke last night into Pump Street and held it for at least half an hour . He was afterwards expelled from it by General Turnbull , of Notting Hill , but only after desperate fighting and the sudden descent of that terrible darkness which proved so much more fatal to the forces of General Buck and General Swindon .
49880	50058	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" Provost Wayne himself , with whom I had , with great good fortune , a most interesting interview , bore the most eloquent testimony to the conduct of General Wilson and his men . His precise words are as follows : ' I have bought sweets at his funny little shop when I was four years old , and ever since . I never noticed anything , I am ashamed to say , except that he talked through his nose , and did n't wash himself particularly . And he came over our barricade like a devil from hell . ' I repeated this speech to General Wilson himself , with some delicate improvements , and he seemed pleased with it . He does not , however , seem pleased with anything so much just now as he is with the wearing of a sword . I have it from the front on the best authority that General Wilson was not completely shaved yesterday . It is believed in military circles that he is growing a moustache ....
50059	50280	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" As I have said , there is nothing to report . I walk wearily to the pillar - box at the corner of Pembridge Road to post my copy . Nothing whatever has happened , except the preparations for a particularly long and feeble siege , during which I trust I shall not be required to be at the Front . As I glance up Pembridge Road in the growing dusk , the aspect of that road reminds me that there is one note worth adding . General Buck has suggested , with characteristic acumen , to General Wilson that , in order to obviate the possibility of such a catastrophe as overwhelmed the allied forces in the last advance on Notting Hill ( the catastrophe , I mean , of the extinguished lamps ) , each soldier should have a lighted lantern round his neck . This is one of the things which I really admire about General Buck . He possesses what people used to mean by ' the humility of the man of science , ' that is , he learns steadily from his mistakes . Wayne may score off him in some other way , but not in that way . The lanterns look like fairy lights as they curve round the end of Pembridge Road .
50286	50403	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" _ Later_.--I write with some difficulty , because the blood will run down my face and make patterns on the paper . Blood is a very beautiful thing ; that is why it is concealed . If you ask why blood runs down my face , I can only reply that I was kicked by a horse . If you ask me what horse , I can reply with some pride that it was a war - horse . If you ask me how a war - horse came on the scene in our simple pedestrian warfare , I am reduced to the necessity , so painful to a special correspondent , of recounting my experiences .
50404	50730	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" I was , as I have said , in the very act of posting my copy at the pillar - box , and of glancing as I did so up the glittering curve of Pembridge Road , studded with the lights of Wilson 's men . I do n't know what made me pause to examine the matter , but I had a fancy that the line of lights , where it melted into the indistinct brown twilight , was more indistinct than usual . I was almost certain that in a certain stretch of the road where there had been five lights there were now only four . I strained my eyes ; I counted them again , and there were only three . A moment after there were only two ; an instant after only one ; and an instant after that the lanterns near to me swung like jangled bells , as if struck suddenly . They flared and fell ; and for the moment the fall of them was like the fall of the sun and stars out of heaven . It left everything in a primal blindness . As a matter of fact , the road was not yet legitimately dark . There were still red rays of a sunset in the sky , and the brown gloaming was still warmed , as it were , with a feeling as of firelight . But for three seconds after the lanterns swung and sank , I saw in front of me a blackness blocking the sky . And with the fourth second I knew that this blackness which blocked the sky was a man on a great horse ; and I was trampled and tossed aside as a swirl of horsemen swept round the corner . As they turned I saw that they were not black , but scarlet ; they were a sortie of the besieged , Wayne riding ahead .
50731	50863	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" I lifted myself from the gutter , blinded with blood from a very slight skin - wound , and , queerly enough , not caring either for the blindness or for the slightness of the wound . For one mortal minute after that amazing cavalcade had spun past , there was dead stillness on the empty road . And then came Barker and all his halberdiers running like devils in the track of them . It had been their business to guard the gate by which the sortie had broken out ; but they had not reckoned , and small blame to them , on cavalry . As it was , Barker and his men made a perfectly splendid run after them , almost catching Wayne 's horses by the tails .
50864	51080	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" Nobody can understand the sortie . It consists only of a small number of Wayne 's garrison . Turnbull himself , with the vast mass of it , is undoubtedly still barricaded in Pump Street . Sorties of this kind are natural enough in the majority of historical sieges , such as the siege of Paris in 1870 , because in such cases the besieged are certain of some support outside . But what can be the object of it in this case ? Wayne knows ( or if he is too mad to know anything , at least Turnbull knows ) that there is not , and never has been , the smallest chance of support for him outside ; that the mass of the sane modern inhabitants of London regard his farcical patriotism with as much contempt as they do the original idiotcy that gave it birth -- the folly of our miserable King . What Wayne and his horsemen are doing nobody can even conjecture . The general theory round here is that he is simply a traitor , and has abandoned the besieged . But all such larger but yet more soluble riddles are as nothing compared to the one small but unanswerable riddle : Where did they get the horses ?
51086	51408	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" _ Later_.--I have heard a most extraordinary account of the origin of the appearance of the horses . It appears that that amazing person , General Turnbull , who is now ruling Pump Street in the absence of Wayne , sent out , on the morning of the declaration of war , a vast number of little boys ( or cherubs of the gutter , as we pressmen say ) , with half - crowns in their pockets , to take cabs all over London . No less than a hundred and sixty cabs met at Pump Street ; were commandeered by the garrison . The men were set free , the cabs used to make barricades , and the horses kept in Pump Street , where they were fed and exercised for several days , until they were sufficiently rapid and efficient to be used for this wild ride out of the town . If this is so , and I have it on the best possible authority , the method of the sortie is explained . But we have no explanation of its object . Just as Barker 's Blues were swinging round the corner after them , they were stopped , but not by an enemy ; only by the voice of one man , and he a friend . Red Wilson of Bayswater ran alone along the main road like a madman , waving them back with a halberd snatched from a sentinel . He was in supreme command , and Barker stopped at the corner , staring and bewildered . We could hear Wilson 's voice loud and distinct out of the dusk , so that it seemed strange that the great voice should come out of the little body . ' Halt , South Kensington ! Guard this entry , and prevent them returning . I will pursue . Forward , the Green Guards ! '
51409	51529	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" A wall of dark blue uniforms and a wood of pole - axes was between me and Wilson , for Barker 's men blocked the mouth of the road in two rigid lines . But through them and through the dusk I could hear the clear orders and the clank of arms , and see the green army of Wilson marching by towards the west . They were our great fighting - men . Wilson had filled them with his own fire ; in a few days they had become veterans . Each of them wore a silver medal of a pump , to boast that they alone of all the allied armies had stood victorious in Pump Street .
51530	51653	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" I managed to slip past the detachment of Barker 's Blues , who are guarding the end of Pembridge Road , and a sharp spell of running brought me to the tail of Wilson 's green army as it swung down the road in pursuit of the flying Wayne . The dusk had deepened into almost total darkness ; for some time I only heard the throb of the marching pace . Then suddenly there was a cry , and the tall fighting men were flung back on me , almost crushing me , and again the lanterns swung and jingled , and the cold nozzles of great horses pushed into the press of us . They had turned and charged us .
51654	51687	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' You fools ! ' came the voice of Wilson , cleaving our panic with a splendid cold anger . ' Do n't you see ? the horses have no riders ! '
51688	51773	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" It was true . We were being plunged at by a stampede of horses with empty saddles . What could it mean ? Had Wayne met some of our men and been defeated ? Or had he flung these horses at us as some kind of ruse or mad new mode of warfare , such as he seemed bent on inventing ? Or did he and his men want to get away in disguise ? Or did they want to hide in houses somewhere ?
51774	51888	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" Never did I admire any man 's intellect ( even my own ) so much as I did Wilson 's at that moment . Without a word , he simply pointed the halberd ( which he still grasped ) to the southern side of the road . As you know , the streets running up to the ridge of Campden Hill from the main road are peculiarly steep , they are more like sudden flights of stairs . We were just opposite Aubrey Road , the steepest of all ; up that it would have been far more difficult to urge half - trained horses than to run up on one 's feet .
51889	51918	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Left wheel ! ' hallooed Wilson . ' They have gone up here , ' he added to me , who happened to be at his elbow .
51919	51928	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Why ? ' I ventured to ask .
51929	52050	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Ca n't say for certain , ' replied the Bayswater General . ' They 've gone up here in a great hurry , anyhow . They 've simply turned their horses loose , because they could n't take them up . I fancy I know . I fancy they 're trying to get over the ridge to Kensingston or Hammersmith , or somewhere , and are striking up here because it 's just beyond the end of our line . Damned fools , not to have gone further along the road , though . They 've only just shaved our last outpost . Lambert is hardly four hundred yards from here . And I 've sent him word . '
52051	52069	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Lambert ! ' I said . ' Not young Wilfrid Lambert -- my old friend . '
52070	52088	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Wilfrid Lambert 's his name , ' said the General ; ' used to be a "
52093	52181	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" silly fellow with a big nose . That kind of man always volunteers for some war or other ; and what 's funnier , he generally is n't half bad at it . Lambert is distinctly good . The yellow West Kensingtons I always reckoned the weakest part of the army ; but he has pulled them together uncommonly well , though he 's subordinate to Swindon , who 's a donkey . In the attack from Pembridge Road the other night he showed great pluck . '
52182	52211	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' He has shown greater pluck than that , ' I said . ' He has criticised my sense of humour . That was his first engagement . '
52212	52287	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" This remark was , I am sorry to say , lost on the admirable commander of the allied forces . We were in the act of climbing the last half of Aubrey Road , which is so abrupt a slope that it looks like an old - fashioned map leaning up against the wall . There are lines of little trees , one above the other , as in the old - fashioned map .
52288	52388	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" We reached the top of it , panting somewhat , and were just about to turn the corner by a place called ( in chivalrous anticipation of our wars of sword and axe ) Tower Creçy , when we were suddenly knocked in the stomach ( I can use no other term ) by a horde of men hurled back upon us . They wore the red uniform of Wayne ; their halberds were broken ; their foreheads bleeding ; but the mere impetus of their retreat staggered us as we stood at the last ridge of the slope .
52389	52441	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Good old Lambert ! ' yelled out suddenly the stolid Mr. Wilson of Bayswater , in an uncontrollable excitement . ' Damned jolly old Lambert ! He 's got there already ! He 's driving them back on us ! Hurrah ! hurrah ! Forward , the Green Guards ! '
52442	52456	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" We swung round the corner eastwards , Wilson running first , brandishing the halberd--
52457	52726	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" Will you pardon a little egotism ? Every one likes a little egotism , when it takes the form , as mine does in this case , of a disgraceful confession . The thing is really a little interesting , because it shows how the merely artistic habit has bitten into men like me . It was the most intensely exciting occurrence that had ever come to me in my life ; and I was really intensely excited about it . And yet , as we turned that corner , the first impression I had was of something that had nothing to do with the fight at all . I was stricken from the sky as by a thunderbolt , by the height of the Waterworks Tower on Campden Hill . I do n't know whether Londoners generally realise how high it looks when one comes out , in this way , almost immediately under it . For the second it seemed to me that at the foot of it even human war was a triviality . For the second I felt as if I had been drunk with some trivial orgie , and that I had been sobered by the shock of that shadow . A moment afterwards , I realised that under it was going on something more enduring than stone , and something wilder than the dizziest height -- the agony of man . And I knew that , compared to that , this overwhelming tower was itself a triviality ; it was a mere stalk of stone which humanity could snap like a stick .
52727	52835	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" I do n't know why I have talked so much about this silly old Waterworks Tower , which at the very best was only a tremendous background . It was that , certainly , a sombre and awful landscape , against which our figures were relieved . But I think the real reason was , that there was in my own mind so sharp a transition from the tower of stone to the man of flesh . For what I saw first when I had shaken off , as it were , the shadow of the tower , was a man , and a man I knew .
52836	53061	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" Lambert stood at the further corner of the street that curved round the tower , his figure outlined in some degree by the beginning of moonrise . He looked magnificent , a hero ; but he looked something much more interesting than that . He was , as it happened , in almost precisely the same swaggering attitude in which he had stood nearly fifteen years ago , when he swung his walking - stick and struck it into the ground , and told me that all my subtlety was drivel . And , upon my soul , I think he required more courage to say that than to fight as he does now . For then he was fighting against something that was in the ascendant , fashionable , and victorious . And now he is fighting ( at the risk of his life , no doubt ) merely against something which is already dead , which is impossible , futile ; of which nothing has been more impossible and futile than this very sortie which has brought him into contact with it . People nowadays allow infinitely too little for the psychological sense of victory as a factor in affairs . Then he was attacking the degraded but undoubtedly victorious Quin ; now he is attacking the interesting but totally extinguished Wayne .
53062	53261	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" His name recalls me to the details of the scene . The facts were these . A line of red halberdiers , headed by Wayne , were marching up the street , close under the northern wall , which is , in fact , the bottom of a sort of dyke or fortification of the Waterworks . Lambert and his yellow West Kensingtons had that instant swept round the corner and had shaken the Waynites heavily , hurling back a few of the more timid , as I have just described , into our very arms . When our force struck the tail of Wayne 's , every one knew that all was up with him . His favourite military barber was struck down . His grocer was stunned . He himself was hurt in the thigh , and reeled back against the wall . We had him in a trap with two jaws . ' Is that you ? ' shouted Lambert , genially , to Wilson , across the hemmed - in host of Notting Hill . ' That 's about the ticket , ' replied General Wilson ; ' keep them under the wall . '
53262	53334	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" The men of Notting Hill were falling fast . Adam Wayne threw up his long arms to the wall above him , and with a spring stood upon it ; a gigantic figure against the moon . He tore the banner out of the hands of the standard - bearer below him , and shook it out suddenly above our heads , so that it was like thunder in the heavens .
53335	53366	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Round the Red Lion ! ' he cried . ' Swords round the Red Lion ! Halberds round the Red Lion ! They are the thorns round rose . '
53367	53401	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" His voice and the crack of the banner made a momentary rally , and Lambert , whose idiotic face was almost beautiful with battle , felt it as by an instinct , and cried--
53402	53417	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Drop your public - house flag , you footler ! Drop it ! '
53418	53443	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' The banner of the Red Lion seldom stoops , ' said Wayne , proudly , letting it out luxuriantly on the night wind .
53444	53536	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" The next moment I knew that poor Adam 's sentimental theatricality had cost him much . Lambert was on the wall at a bound , his sword in his teeth , and had slashed at Wayne 's head before he had time to draw his sword , his hands being busy with the enormous flag . He stepped back only just in time to avoid the first cut , and let the flag - staff fall , so that the spear - blade at the end of it pointed to Lambert .
53537	53605	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' The banner stoops , ' cried Wayne , in a voice that must have startled streets . ' The banner of Notting Hill stoops to a hero . ' And with the words he drove the spear - point and half the flag - staff through Lambert 's body and dropped him dead upon the road below , a stone upon the stones of the street .
53606	53655	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Notting Hill ! Notting Hill ! ' cried Wayne , in a sort of divine rage . ' Her banner is all the holier for the blood of a brave enemy ! Up on the wall , patriots ! Up on the wall ! Notting Hill ! '
53656	53713	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" With his long strong arm he actually dragged a man up on to the wall to be silhouetted against the moon , and more and more men climbed up there , pulled themselves and were pulled , till clusters and crowds of the half - massacred men of Pump Street massed upon the wall above us .
53714	53727	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Notting Hill ! Notting Hill ! ' cried Wayne , unceasingly .
53728	53755	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Well , what about Bayswater ? ' said a worthy working - man in Wilson 's army , irritably . ' Bayswater for ever ! '
53756	53787	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' We have won ! ' cried Wayne , striking his flag - staff in the ground . ' Bayswater for ever ! We have taught our enemies patriotism ! '
53788	53826	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Oh , cut these fellows up and have done with it ! ' cried one of Lambert 's lieutenants , who was reduced to something bordering on madness by the responsibility of succeeding to the command .
53827	53850	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" ' Let us by all means try , ' said Wilson , grimly ; and the two armies closed round the third .
53856	53980	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" I simply can not describe what followed . I am sorry , but there is such a thing as physical fatigue , as physical nausea , and , I may add , as physical terror . Suffice it to say that the above paragraph was written about 11 p.m. , and that it is now about 2 a.m. , and that the battle is not finished , and is not likely to be . Suffice it further to say that down the steep streets which lead from the Waterworks Tower to the Notting Hill High Road , blood has been running , and is running , in great red serpents , that curl out into the main thoroughfare and shine in the moon .
53986	54041	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" _ Later._--The final touch has been given to all this terrible futility . Hours have passed ; morning has broken ; men are still swaying and fighting at the foot of the tower and round the corner of Aubrey Road ; the fight has not finished . But I know it is a farce .
54042	54118	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" News has just come to show that Wayne 's amazing sortie , followed by the amazing resistance through a whole night on the wall of the Waterworks , is as if it had not been . What was the object of that strange exodus we shall probably never know , for the simple reason that every one who knew will probably be cut to pieces in the course of the next two or three hours .
54119	54346	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" I have heard , about three minutes ago , that Buck and Buck 's methods have won after all . He was perfectly right , of course , when one comes to think of it , in holding that it was physically impossible for a street to defeat a city . While we thought he was patrolling the eastern gates with his Purple army ; while we were rushing about the streets and waving halberds and lanterns ; while poor old Wilson was scheming like Moltke and fighting like Achilles to entrap the wild Provost of Notting Hill -- Mr. Buck , retired draper , has simply driven down in a hansom cab and done something about as plain as butter and about as useful and nasty . He has gone down to South Kensington , Brompton , and Fulham , and by spending about four thousand pounds of his private means , has raised an army of nearly as many men ; that is to say , an army big enough to beat , not only Wayne , but Wayne and all his present enemies put together . The army , I understand , is encamped along High Street , Kensington , and fills it from the Church to Addison Road Bridge . It is to advance by ten different roads uphill to the north .
54347	54449	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" I can not endure to remain here . Everything makes it worse than it need be . The dawn , for instance , has broken round Campden Hill ; splendid spaces of silver , edged with gold , are torn out of the sky . Worse still , Wayne and his men feel the dawn ; their faces , though bloody and pale , are strangely hopeful ... insupportably pathetic . Worst of all , for the moment they are winning . If it were not for Buck and the new army they might just , and only just , win .
54450	54682	48778	48779	The writer	1466	" I repeat , I can not stand it . It is like watching that wonderful play of old Maeterlinck 's ( you know my partiality for the healthy , jolly old authors of the nineteenth century ) , in which one has to watch the quiet conduct of people inside a parlour , while knowing that the very men are outside the door whose word can blast it all with tragedy . And this is worse , for the men are not talking , but writhing and bleeding and dropping dead for a thing that is already settled -- and settled against them . The great grey masses of men still toil and tug and sway hither and thither around the great grey tower ; and the tower is still motionless , as it will always be motionless . These men will be crushed before the sun is set ; and new men will arise and be crushed , and new wrongs done , and tyranny will always rise again like the sun , and injustice will always be as fresh as the flowers of spring . And the stone tower will always look down on it . Matter , in its brutal beauty , will always look down on those who are mad enough to consent to die , and yet more mad , since they consent to live . "
54820	54828	54830	54831	that gentleman	1473	" Have you heard the good news ? "
54833	54836	54838	54838	Quin	227	" Yes , "
54845	54871	54838	54838	Quin	227	" I have heard the glad tidings of great joy . Shall we take a hansom down to Kensington ? I see one over there . "
55117	55131	55133	55133	Buck	273	" Let us send some kind of messenger or herald up to them , "
55142	55156	55133	55133	Buck	273	" Let us send and ask them to cave in without more muddle . "
55157	55165	55167	55167	Barker	247	" What shall we say to them ? "
55171	55181	55183	55183	Buck	273	" The facts of the case are quite sufficient , "
55185	55284	55183	55183	Buck	273	" It is the facts of the case that make an army surrender . Let us simply say that our army that is fighting their army , and their army that is fighting our army , amount altogether to about a thousand men . Say that we have four thousand . It is very simple . Of the thousand fighting , they have at the very most , three hundred , so that , with those three hundred , they have now to fight four thousand seven hundred men . Let them do it if it amuses them . "
55327	55336	55338	55338	Barker	247	" What will they do when they consent ? "
55355	55363	55365	55365	Buck	273	" I know my Wayne very well , "
55369	55402	55365	55365	Buck	273	" When he submits he will send a red herald flaming with the Lion of Notting Hill . Even defeat will be delightful to him , since it is formal and romantic . "
55424	55430	55431	55431	he	1493	" I should n't wonder , "
55434	55465	55431	55431	he	1493	" if he defied you , and did n't send the herald after all . I do n't think you do know your Wayne quite so well as you think . "
55466	55473	55475	55475	Buck	273	" All right , your Majesty , "
55479	55514	55475	55475	Buck	273	" if it is n't disrespectful , I 'll put my political calculations in a very simple form . I 'll lay you ten pounds to a shilling the herald comes with the surrender . "
55515	55519	55521	55521	Auberon	227	" All right , "
55523	55561	55521	55521	Auberon	227	" I may be wrong , but it 's my notion of Adam Wayne that he 'll die in his city , and that , till he is dead , it will not be a safe property . "
55562	55571	55573	55573	Buck	273	" The bet 's made , your Majesty , "
55607	55617	55618	55618	he	273	" It 's taking your money , your Majesty , "
55621	55635	55618	55618	he	273	" I knew it was . There comes the herald from Adam Wayne . "
55636	55641	55643	55644	the King	1924	" It 's not , "
55650	55660	55643	55644	the King	1924	" You brute , it 's a red omnibus . "
55661	55666	55668	55668	Buck	273	" It 's not , "
55777	55781	55782	55782	he	273	" General Barker , "
55787	55800	55782	55782	he	273	" do you propose now to receive the message from the besieged ? "
55811	55826	55827	55827	he	273	" Has your master , Mr. Adam Wayne , received our request for surrender ? "
55848	55856	55839	55839	Barker	332	" What answer does your master send ? "
55872	55972	55857	55858	The herald	861	" My message is this . Adam Wayne , Lord High Provost of Notting Hill , under the charter of King Auberon and the laws of God and all mankind , free and of a free city , greets James Barker , Lord High Provost of South Kensington , by the same rights free and honourable , leader of the army of the South . With all friendly reverence , and with all constitutional consideration , he desires James Barker to lay down his arms , and the whole army under his command to lay down their arms also . "
56023	56032	56034	56035	the herald	861	" The Lord High Provost of Notting Hill , "
56037	56102	56034	56035	the herald	861	" does not propose , in the event of your surrender , to use his victory for any of those repressive purposes which others have entertained against him . He will leave you your free laws and your free cities , your flags and your governments . He will not destroy the religion of South Kensington , or crush the old customs of Bayswater . "
56118	56131	56133	56133	Buck	273	" The King must have had something to do with this humour , "
56139	56154	56133	56133	Buck	273	" It 's too deliciously insolent . Barker , have a glass of wine . "
56192	56301	56187	56188	the herald	861	" In the event of your surrendering your arms and dispersing under the superintendence of our forces , these local rights of yours shall be carefully observed . In the event of your not doing so , the Lord High Provost of Notting Hill desires to announce that he has just captured the Waterworks Tower , just above you , on Campden Hill , and that within ten minutes from now , that is , on the reception through me of your refusal , he will open the great reservoir and flood the whole valley where you stand in thirty feet of water . God save King Auberon ! "
56318	56322	56323	56323	he	273	" But -- but-- "
56346	56351	56352	56352	he	273	" We must surrender , "
56355	56408	56352	56352	he	273	" You could do nothing against fifty thousand tons of water coming down a steep hill , ten minutes hence . We must surrender . Our four thousand men might as well be four . _ Vicisti Galilæe ! _ Perkins , you may as well get me another glass of wine . "
56632	56639	56640	56640	he	261	" I have survived the Deluge , "
56643	56655	56640	56640	he	261	" I am a pyramid , and must behave as such . "
56713	56716	56725	56725	him	1924	" Gaffer Auberon "
56775	56778	56779	56779	he	1924	" Ah ! "
56797	56809	56779	56779	he	1924	accent--"Ah ! I mind when there warn't none of this here . "
56835	56838	56839	56844	The guard in red and gold	1534	" Nothing Ill. "
56978	56987	56989	56990	the King	1924	" Old Wayne was right in a way , "
56992	57045	56989	56990	the King	1924	" The sword does make things beautiful . It has made the whole world romantic by now . And to think people once thought me a buffoon for suggesting a romantic Notting Hill . Deary me , deary me ! ( I think that is the expression)--it seems like a previous existence . "
57373	57377	57379	57380	Mr. Mead	292	" Your Majesty , "
57387	57404	57379	57380	Mr. Mead	292	" This is an honour to me , but yet more an honour to the city . "
57411	57415	57416	57416	he	292	" Mr. Mead , "
57419	57443	57416	57416	he	292	" Notting Hill , whether in giving or taking , can deal in nothing but honour . Do you happen to sell liquorice ? "
57444	57449	57451	57452	Mr. Mead	292	" Liquorice , sire , "
57454	57471	57451	57452	Mr. Mead	292	" is not the least important of our benefits out of the dark heart of Arabia . "
57498	57507	57509	57510	the King	1924	" I was just thinking , Mr. Mead , "
57514	57547	57509	57510	the King	1924	" I do n't know why I should think about it just now , but I was just thinking of twenty years ago . Do you remember the times before the war ? "
57585	57592	57593	57593	he	2414	" Oh yes , your Majesty , "
57596	57725	57593	57593	he	2414	" I remember these streets before the Lord Provost began to rule us . I ca n't remember how we felt very well . All the great songs and the fighting change one so ; and I do n't think we can really estimate all we owe to the Provost ; but I can remember his coming into this very shop twenty - two years ago , and I remember the things he said . The singular thing is that , as far as I remember , I thought the things he said odd at that time . Now it 's the things that I said , as far as I can recall them , that seem to me odd -- as odd as a madman 's antics . "
57726	57729	57731	57732	the King	1924	" Ah ! "
57743	57753	57754	57754	he	1924	" I thought nothing of being a grocer then , "
57757	57837	57754	57754	he	1924	" Is n't that odd enough for anybody ? I thought nothing of all the wonderful places that my goods come from , and wonderful ways that they are made . I did not know that I was for all practical purposes a king with slaves spearing fishes near the secret pool , and gathering fruits in the islands under the world . My mind was a blank on the thing . I was as mad as a hatter . "
57862	57873	57874	57874	he	1924	" And is this the end of poor old Wayne ? "
57881	57963	57874	57874	he	1924	" To inflame every one so much that he is lost himself in the blaze . Is this his victory that he , my incomparable Wayne , is now only one in a world of Waynes ? Has he conquered and become by conquest commonplace ? Must Mr. Mead , the grocer , talk as high as he ? Lord ! what a strange world in which a man can not remain unique even by taking the trouble to go mad ! "
57993	58000	58002	58003	THE CHEMIST	1129	" A FINE EVENING , SIR , "
58006	58014	58015	58015	he	1129	" How uncommonly creepy this shop looks ! "
58018	58109	58015	58015	he	1129	" But yet somehow encouragingly creepy , invitingly creepy . It looks like something in a jolly old nursery story in which you are frightened out of your skin , and yet know that things always end well . The way those low sharp gables are carved like great black bat 's wings folded down , and the way those queer - coloured bowls underneath are made to shine like giants eye - balls . It looks like a benevolent warlock 's hut . It is apparently a chemist 's . "
58212	58219	58221	58222	the chemist	1129	" A fine evening , sir , "
58224	58293	58221	58222	the chemist	1129	" Why , I can scarcely be mistaken in supposing it to be your Majesty . Pray step inside and share a bottle of sal - volatile , or anything that may take your fancy . As it happens , there is an old acquaintance of your Majesty 's in my shop carousing ( if I may be permitted the term ) upon that beverage at this moment . "
58500	58510	58498	58498	he	1924	" By the Great Lord of Luck , Barker ! "
58560	58564	58566	58566	Barker	247	" Your Majesty , "
58568	58593	58595	58595	he	1924	" this is a meeting nobly retrospective , a meeting that has about it a certain October gold . I drink to old days ; "
58605	58616	58618	58619	the King	1924	" I am delighted to see you again , Barker , "
58621	58680	58618	58619	the King	1924	" It is indeed long since we met . What with my travels in Asia Minor , and my book having to be written ( you have read my ' Life of Prince Albert for Children , ' of course ? ) , we have scarcely met twice since the Great War . That is twenty years ago . "
58681	58685	58687	58687	Barker	247	" I wonder , "
58691	58701	58687	58687	Barker	247	" if I might speak freely to your Majesty ? "
58702	58705	58707	58707	Auberon	334	" Well , "
58709	58730	58707	58707	Auberon	334	" it 's rather late in the day to start speaking respectfully . Flap away , my bird of freedom . "
58731	58737	58739	58739	Barker	247	" Well , your Majesty , "
58745	58760	58742	58742	his	247	" I do n't think it will be so long to the next war . "
58761	58767	58769	58769	Auberon	334	" What do you mean ? "
58771	58780	58783	58783	Barker	247	" We will stand this insolence no longer , "
58787	58863	58783	58783	Barker	247	" We are not slaves because Adam Wayne twenty years ago cheated us with a water - pipe . Notting Hill is Notting Hill ; it is not the world . We in South Kensington , we also have memories -- ay , and hopes . If they fought for these trumpery shops and a few lamp - posts , shall we not fight for the great High Street and the sacred Natural History Museum ? "
58864	58868	58870	58872	the astounded Auberon	334	" Great Heavens ! "
58874	58909	58870	58872	the astounded Auberon	334	" Will wonders never cease ? Have the two greatest marvels been achieved ? Have you turned altruistic , and has Wayne turned selfish ? Are you the patriot , and he the tyrant ? "
58910	58923	58925	58925	Barker	247	" It is not from Wayne himself altogether that the evil comes , "
58927	59167	58925	58925	Barker	247	" He , indeed , is now mostly wrapped in dreams , and sits with his old sword beside the fire . But Notting Hill is the tyrant , your Majesty . Its Council and its crowds have been so intoxicated by the spreading over the whole city of Wayne 's old ways and visions , that they try to meddle with every one , and rule every one , and civilise every one , and tell every one what is good for him . I do not deny the great impulse which his old war , wild as it seemed , gave to the civic life of our time . It came when I was still a young man , and I admit it enlarged my career . But we are not going to see our own cities flouted and thwarted from day to day because of something Wayne did for us all nearly a quarter of a century ago . I am just waiting here for news upon this very matter . It is rumoured that Notting Hill has vetoed the statue of General Wilson they are putting up opposite Chepstow Place . If that is so , it is a black and white shameless breach of the terms on which we surrendered to Turnbull after the battle of the Tower . We were to keep our own customs and self - government . If that is so-- "
59168	59173	58870	58872	the astounded Auberon	334	" It is so , "
59214	59217	59218	59218	he	1585	" Yes , "
59227	59274	59218	59218	he	1585	" I am Provost Buck , and the news is true . These men of the Hill have forgotten that we fought round the Tower as well as they , and that it is sometimes foolish , as well as base , to despise the conquered . "
59275	59281	59283	59283	Barker	247	" Let us step outside , "
59308	59321	59322	59322	he	307	" I would like to have a go at smashing all this , "
59325	59335	59322	59322	he	307	" though I am over sixty . I would like-- "
59368	59371	59372	59372	he	307	" Darkness ! "
59373	59381	59412	59413	the chemist	1129	cried--"darkness again ! What does it mean ? "
59423	59431	59432	59432	he	1129	" Oh , do n't you know ? "
59435	59633	59412	59413	the chemist	1129	" Did they never tell you this is the Feast of the Lamps , the anniversary of the great battle that almost lost and just saved Notting Hill ? Do n't you know , your Majesty , that on this night twenty - one years ago we saw Wilson 's green uniforms charging down this street , and driving Wayne and Turnbull back upon the gas - works , fighting with their handful like fiends from hell ? And that then , in that great hour , Wayne sprang through a window of the gas - works , with one blow of his hand brought darkness on the whole city , and then with a cry like a lion 's , that was heard through four streets , flew at Wilson 's men , sword in hand , and swept them , bewildered as they were , and ignorant of the map , clear out of the sacred street again ? And do n't you know that upon that night every year all lights are turned out for half an hour while we sing the Notting Hill anthem in the darkness ? Hark ! there it begins . "
59651	59809	59412	59413	the chemist	1129	" When the world was in the balance , there was night on Notting Hill , ( There was night on Notting Hill ): it was nobler than the day ; On the cities where the lights are and the firesides glow , From the seas and from the deserts came the thing we did not know , Came the darkness , came the darkness , came the darkness on the foe , And the old guard of God turned to bay . For the old guard of God turns to bay , turns to bay , And the stars fall down before it ere its banners fall to - day : For when armies were around us as a howling and a horde , When falling was the citadel and broken was the sword , The darkness came upon them like the Dragon of the Lord , When the old guard of God turned to bay . "
59841	59845	59831	59831	Barker	247	" South Kensington ! "
59900	59916	59918	59918	himself	247	" This is not the first time I 've come through the thick of you , "
60057	60062	60023	60023	he	307	" Kensington ! Kensington ! "
60191	60197	60147	60147	Buck	307	" Turn up the lights , "
60219	60240	60147	60147	Buck	307	" In the name of Notting Hill and of the great Council of the City , turn up the lights . "
60318	60326	60327	60327	he	280	" What is this , my people ? "
60330	60944	60327	60327	he	280	" Is it altogether impossible to make a thing good without it immediately insisting on being wicked ? The glory of Notting Hill in having achieved its independence , has been enough for me to dream of for many years , as I sat beside the fire . Is it really not enough for you , who have had so many other affairs to excite and distract you ? Notting Hill is a nation . Why should it condescend to be a mere Empire ? You wish to pull down the statue of General Wilson , which the men of Bayswater have so rightly erected in Westbourne Grove . Fools ! Who erected that statue ? Did Bayswater erect it ? No . Notting Hill erected it . Do you not see that it is the glory of our achievement that we have infected the other cities with the idealism of Notting Hill ? It is we who have created not only our own side , but both sides of this controversy . O too humble fools , why should you wish to destroy your enemies ? You have done something more to them . You have created your enemies . You wish to pull down that gigantic silver hammer , which stands , like an obelisk , in the centre of the Broadway of Hammersmith . Fools ! Before Notting Hill arose , did any person passing through Hammersmith Broadway expect to see there a gigantic silver hammer ? You wish to abolish the great bronze figure of a knight standing upon the artificial bridge at Knightsbridge . Fools ! Who would have thought of it before Notting Hill arose ? I have even heard , and with deep pain I have heard it , that the evil eye of our imperial envy has been cast towards the remote horizon of the west , and that we have objected to the great black monument of a crowned raven , which commemorates the skirmish of Ravenscourt Park . Who created all these things ? Were they there before we came ? Can not you be content with that destiny which was enough for Athens , which was enough for Nazareth ? the destiny , the humble purpose , of creating a new world . Is Athens angry because Romans and Florentines have adopted her phraseology for expressing their own patriotism ? Is Nazareth angry because as a little village it has become the type of all little villages out of which , as the Snobs say , no good can come ? Has Athens asked every one to wear the chlamys ? Are all followers of the Nazarene compelled to wear turbans . No ! but the soul of Athens went forth and made men drink hemlock , and the soul of Nazareth went forth and made men consent to be crucified . So has the soul of Notting Hill gone forth and made men realise what it is to live in a city . Just as we inaugurated our symbols and ceremonies , so they have inaugurated theirs ; and are you so mad as to contend against them ? Notting Hill is right ; it has always been right . It has moulded itself on its own necessities , its own _ sine quâ non _ ; it has accepted its own ultimatum . Because it is a nation it has created itself ; and because it is a nation it can destroy itself . Notting Hill shall always be the judge . If it is your will because of this matter of General Wilson 's statue to make war upon Bayswater-- "
61051	61129	61035	61035	he	1610	" To - morrow , old man , we shall have a new experience , as fresh as the flowers of spring . We shall be defeated . You and I have been through three battles together , and have somehow or other missed this peculiar delight . It is unfortunate that we shall not probably be able to exchange our experiences , because , as it most annoyingly happens , we shall probably both be dead . "
61135	61146	61147	61147	he	325	" I do n't mind so much about being dead , "
61150	61162	61147	61147	he	325	" but why should you say that we shall be defeated ? "
61163	61170	61172	61172	Wayne	280	" The answer is very simple , "
61176	61244	61172	61172	Wayne	280	" It is because we ought to be defeated . We have been in the most horrible holes before now ; but in all those I was perfectly certain that the stars were on our side , and that we ought to get out . Now I know that we ought not to get out ; and that takes away from me everything with which I won . "
61274	61284	61286	61287	the King	1924	" Is it really true , my dear Wayne , "
61291	61303	61286	61287	the King	1924	" that you think you will be beaten to - morrow ? "
61304	61314	61316	61317	Adam Wayne	280	" There can be no doubt about it whatever , "
61319	61369	61316	61317	Adam Wayne	280	" the real reason is the one of which I have just spoken . But as a concession to your materialism , I will add that they have an organised army of a hundred allied cities against our one . That in itself , however , would be unimportant . "
61381	61387	61388	61388	he	227	" You are quite sure , "
61391	61398	61388	61388	he	227	" that you must be beaten ? "
61399	61404	61406	61406	Turnbull	325	" I am afraid , "
61410	61420	61406	61406	Turnbull	325	" that there can be no doubt about it . "
61421	61424	61426	61427	the King	1924	" Then , "
61434	61489	61426	61427	the King	1924	" give me a halberd ! Give me a halberd , somebody ! I desire all men to witness that I , Auberon , King of England , do here and now abdicate , and implore the Provost of Notting Hill to permit me to enlist in his army . Give me a halberd ! "
61792	61798	61799	61799	he	280	" Well , your Majesty , "
61802	61871	61873	61873	he	280	" you at least ought to be proud to - day . If your children are fighting each other , at least those who win are your children . Other kings have distributed justice , you have distributed life . Other kings have ruled a nation , you have created nations . Others have made kingdoms , you have begotten them . Look at your children , father ! "
61889	61894	61896	61896	Wayne	280	" See how splendidly , "
61898	62099	61896	61896	Wayne	280	" the new cities come on -- the new cities from across the river . See where Battersea advances over there -- under the flag of the Lost Dog ; and Putney -- don't you see the Man on the White Boar shining on their standard as the sun catches it ? It is the coming of a new age , your Majesty . Notting Hill is not a common empire ; it is a thing like Athens , the mother of a mode of life , of a manner of living , which shall renew the youth of the world -- a thing like Nazareth . When I was young I remember , in the old dreary days , wiseacres used to write books about how trains would get faster , and all the world be one empire , and tram - cars go to the moon . And even as a child I used to say to myself , ' Far more likely that we shall go on the crusades again , or worship the gods of the city . ' And so it has been . And I am glad , though this is my last battle . "
62120	62123	62124	62124	he	1633	" Wilson ! "
62133	62207	62124	62124	he	1633	" Red Wilson has charged our left . No one can hold him in ; he eats swords . He is as keen a soldier as Turnbull , but less patient -- less really great . Ha ! and Barker is moving . How Barker has improved ; how handsome he looks ! It is not all having plumes ; it is also having a soul in one 's daily life . Ha ! "
62229	62234	62236	62236	Wayne	280	" Turnbull is there ! "
62238	62280	62236	62236	Wayne	280	" See him hurl them back ! Barker is checked ! Turnbull charges -- wins ! But our left is broken . Wilson has smashed Bowles and Mead , and may turn our flank . Forward , the Provost 's Guard ! "
62436	62440	62428	62432	the chemist , who fell	1640	" Notting Hill ! "
62719	62722	62716	62716	Wayne	280	" Charge ! "
62840	62847	62848	62848	he	325	" I have had my youth , "
62959	62967	62968	62968	he	247	" How large now , my lord , "
62971	62979	62968	62968	he	247	" is the Empire of Notting Hill ? "
62987	62994	62995	62995	he	247	" Always as large as this , "
63282	63291	63293	63296	the West Kensington leader	1680	" Where is your favour now , Provost ? "
63344	63350	63351	63351	he	280	" Here is one colour ! "
63361	63365	63366	63366	he	280	" and here ! "
63373	63378	63366	63366	he	280	blood--"here is the other . "
63598	63602	63603	63603	he	307	" Kill him ! "
63612	63645	63603	63603	he	307	" Kill him ! Good or bad , he is none of us ! Do not be blinded by the face ! ... God ! have we not been blinded all along ! "
63760	63775	63777	63777	Wayne	280	" For you and me , and for all brave men , my brother , "
63784	63800	63777	63777	Wayne	280	" there is good wine poured in the inn at the end of the world . "
63905	63911	63913	63914	two men	2750	" His hand is slipping , "
63918	63927	63933	63938	a man of the old war	1695	" You do n't know much of him , "
63941	63948	63933	63938	a man of the old war	1695	" More likely his bone cracks . "
63949	63961	63965	63967	the first two	1696	" It is neither -- by God , it is neither ! "
63969	63976	63978	63979	the second	1697	" What is it , then ? "
63981	63987	63988	63988	he	1697	" The tree is falling , "
63991	64002	64004	64004	Wayne	280	" As the tree falleth , so shall it lie , "
64062	64073	64074	64074	he	280	" As the tree falleth , so shall it lie , "
64077	64279	64074	64074	he	280	" Men have called that a gloomy text . It is the essence of all exultation . I am doing now what I have done all my life , what is the only happiness , what is the only universality . I am clinging to something . Let it fall , and there let it lie . Fools , you go about and see the kingdoms of the earth , and are liberal and wise and cosmopolitan , which is all that the devil can give you -- all that he could offer to Christ , only to be spurned away . I am doing what the truly wise do . When a child goes out into the garden and takes hold of a tree , saying , ' Let this tree be all I have , ' that moment its roots take hold on hell and its branches on the stars . The joy I have is what the lover knows when a woman is everything . It is what a savage knows when his idol is everything . It is what I know when Notting Hill is everything . I have a city . Let it stand or fall . "
64396	64425	64786	64788	the first voice	1704	" So ends the Empire of Notting Hill . As it began in blood , so it ended in blood , and all things are always the same . "
64458	64773	65194	65196	The other voice	1705	" If all things are always the same , it is because they are always heroic . If all things are always the same , it is because they are always new . To each man one soul only is given ; to each soul only is given a little power -- the power at some moments to outgrow and swallow up the stars . If age after age that power comes upon men , whatever gives it to them is great . Whatever makes men feel old is mean -- an empire or a skin - flint shop . Whatever makes men feel young is great -- a great war or a love - story . And in the darkest of the books of God there is written a truth that is also a riddle . It is of the new things that men tire -- of fashions and proposals and improvements and change . It is the old things that startle and intoxicate . It is the old things that are young . There is no sceptic who does not feel that many have doubted before . There is no rich and fickle man who does not feel that all his novelties are ancient . There is no worshipper of change who does not feel upon his neck the vast weight of the weariness of the universe . But we who do the old things are fed by nature with a perpetual infancy . No man who is in love thinks that any one has been in love before . No woman who has a child thinks that there have been such things as children . No people that fight for their own city are haunted with the burden of the broken empires . Yes , O dark voice , the world is always the same , for it is always unexpected . "
64790	64882	64786	64788	the first voice	1704	" But in this world there are some , be they wise or foolish , whom nothing intoxicates . There are some who see all your disturbances like a cloud of flies . They know that while men will laugh at your Notting Hill , and will study and rehearse and sing of Athens and Jerusalem , Athens and Jerusalem were silly suburbs like your Notting Hill . They know that the earth itself is a suburb , and can feel only drearily and respectably amused as they move upon it . "
64883	64892	64894	64896	the other voice	1705	" They are philosophers or they are fools , "
64898	65090	64894	64896	the other voice	1705	" They are not men . Men live , as I say , rejoicing from age to age in something fresher than progress -- in the fact that with every baby a new sun and a new moon are made . If our ancient humanity were a single man , it might perhaps be that he would break down under the memory of so many loyalties , under the burden of so many diverse heroisms , under the load and terror of all the goodness of men . But it has pleased God so to isolate the individual soul that it can only learn of all other souls by hearsay , and to each one goodness and happiness come with the youth and violence of lightning , as momentary and as pure . And the doom of failure that lies on all human systems does not in real fact affect them any more than the worms of the inevitable grave affect a children 's game in a meadow . Notting Hill has fallen ; Notting Hill has died . But that is not the tremendous issue . Notting Hill has lived . "
65091	65095	65097	65099	the other voice	1705	" But if , "
65101	65193	65097	65099	the other voice	1705	" if what is achieved by all these efforts be only the common contentment of humanity , why do men so extravagantly toil and die in them ? Has nothing been done by Notting Hill than any chance clump of farmers or clan of savages would not have done without it ? What might have been done to Notting Hill if the world had been different may be a deep question ; but there is a deeper . What could have happened to the world if Notting Hill had never been ? "
65198	65305	65194	65196	The other voice	1705	" The same that would have happened to the world and all the starry systems if an apple - tree grew six apples instead of seven ; something would have been eternally lost . There has never been anything in the world absolutely like Notting Hill . There will never be anything quite like it to the crack of doom . I can not believe anything but that God loved it as He must surely love anything that is itself and unreplaceable . But even for that I do not care . If God , with all His thunders , hated it , I loved it . "
65344	65388	65310	65314	a tall , strange figure	1708	" But suppose the whole matter were really a hocus - pocus . Suppose that whatever meaning you may choose in your fancy to give to it , the real meaning of the whole was mockery . Suppose it was all folly . Suppose-- "
65389	65396	65401	65405	the tall and strange figure	1709	" I have been in it , "
65407	65415	65401	65405	the tall and strange figure	1709	" and I know it was not . "
65427	65433	65435	65436	the voice	1711	" Suppose I am God , "
65438	65551	65435	65436	the voice	1711	" and suppose I made the world in idleness . Suppose the stars , that you think eternal , are only the idiot fireworks of an everlasting schoolboy . Suppose the sun and the moon , to which you sing alternately , are only the two eyes of one vast and sneering giant , opened alternately in a never - ending wink . Suppose the trees , in my eyes , are as foolish as enormous toad - stools . Suppose Socrates and Charlemagne are to me only beasts , made funnier by walking on their hind legs . Suppose I am God , and having made things , laugh at them . "
65552	65559	65561	65562	the other	618	" And suppose I am man , "
65564	65704	65561	65562	the other	618	" And suppose that I give the answer that shatters even a laugh . Suppose I do not laugh back at you , do not blaspheme you , do not curse you . But suppose , standing up straight under the sky , with every power of my being , I thank you for the fools ' paradise you have made . Suppose I praise you , with a literal pain of ecstasy , for the jest that has brought me so terrible a joy . If we have taken the child 's games , and given them the seriousness of a Crusade , if we have drenched your grotesque Dutch garden with the blood of martyrs , we have turned a nursery into a temple . I ask you , in the name of Heaven , who wins ? "
65751	65757	65733	65735	The slight figure	1714	" But suppose , friend , "
65761	65832	65733	65735	The slight figure	1714	" suppose that , in a bitterer and more real sense , it was all a mockery . Suppose that there had been , from the beginning of these great wars , one who watched them with a sense that is beyond expression , a sense of detachment , of responsibility , of irony , of agony . Suppose that there were one who knew it was all a joke . "
65837	65852	65833	65835	The tall figure	1716	" He could not know it . For it was not all a joke . "
65895	65904	65833	65835	The tall figure	1716	" WAYNE , IT WAS ALL A JOKE . "
65906	65910	65733	65735	The slight figure	1714	" Adam Wayne , "
65914	65981	65733	65735	The slight figure	1714	" there are men who confess only in _ articulo mortis _ ; there are people who blame themselves only when they can no longer help others . I am one of them . Here , upon the field of the bloody end of it all , I come to tell you plainly what you would never understand before . Do you know who I am ? "
65982	65990	65992	65994	the tall figure	1716	" I know you , Auberon Quin , "
65996	66013	65992	65994	the tall figure	1716	" and I shall be glad to unburden your spirit of anything that lies upon it . "
66014	66018	66020	66022	the other voice	1705	" Adam Wayne , "
66024	66237	66020	66022	the other voice	1705	" of what I have to say you can not in common reason be glad to unburden me . Wayne , it was all a joke . When I made these cities , I cared no more for them than I care for a centaur , or a merman , or a fish with legs , or a pig with feathers , or any other absurdity . When I spoke to you solemnly and encouragingly about the flag of your freedom and the peace of your city , I was playing a vulgar practical joke on an honest gentleman , a vulgar practical joke that has lasted for twenty years . Though no one could believe it of me , perhaps , it is the truth that I am a man both timid and tender - hearted . I never dared in the early days of your hope , or the central days of your supremacy , to tell you this ; I never dared to break the colossal calm of your face . God knows why I should do it now , when my farce has ended in tragedy and the ruin of all your people ! But I say it now . Wayne , it was done as a joke . "
66268	66278	66263	66263	Wayne	280	" You did it all only as a joke ? "
66279	66282	66284	66284	Quin	227	" Yes , "
66288	66295	66298	66298	Wayne	280	" When you conceived the idea , "
66302	66334	66298	66298	Wayne	280	" of an army for Bayswater and a flag for Notting Hill , there was no gleam , no suggestion in your mind that such things might be real and passionate ? "
66335	66338	66340	66340	Auberon	227	" No , "
66357	66364	66340	66340	Auberon	227	" I had none at all . "
66379	66388	66389	66389	he	280	" I will not stop to thank you , "
66400	66630	66389	66389	he	280	" for the great good for the world you have actually wrought . All that I think of that I have said to you a moment ago , even when I thought that your voice was the voice of a derisive omnipotence , its laughter older than the winds of heaven . But let me say what is immediate and true . You and I , Auberon Quin , have both of us throughout our lives been again and again called mad . And we are mad . We are mad , because we are not two men , but one man . We are mad , because we are two lobes of the same brain , and that brain has been cloven in two . And if you ask for the proof of it , it is not hard to find . It is not merely that you , the humorist , have been in these dark days stripped of the joy of gravity . It is not merely that I , the fanatic , have had to grope without humour . It is that , though we seem to be opposite in everything , we have been opposite like man and woman , aiming at the same moment at the same practical thing . We are the father and the mother of the Charter of the Cities . "

66706	66963	66696	66696	he	280	" I know of something that will alter that antagonism , something that is outside us , something that you and I have all our lives perhaps taken too little account of . The equal and eternal human being will alter that antagonism , for the human being sees no real antagonism between laughter and respect , the human being , the common man , whom mere geniuses like you and me can only worship like a god . When dark and dreary days come , you and I are necessary , the pure fanatic , the pure satirist . We have between us remedied a great wrong . We have lifted the modern cities into that poetry which every one who knows mankind knows to be immeasurably more common than the commonplace . But in healthy people there is no war between us . We are but the two lobes of the brain of a ploughman . Laughter and love are everywhere . The cathedrals , built in the ages that loved God , are full of blasphemous grotesques . The mother laughs continually at the child , the lover laughs continually at the lover , the wife at the husband , the friend at the friend . Auberon Quin , we have been too long separated ; let us go out together . You have a halberd and I a sword , let us start our wanderings over the world . For we are its two essentials . Come , it is already day . "
