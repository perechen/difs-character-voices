1714	1773	1774	1774	She	244	" It would be absurd on my part to change my mind . I meant to occupy that bench , and why should I not ? There is amply sufficient space for the man and me too . He has taken one corner , and I will take the other . These notions that girls have are silly . "
1802	1809	1785	1785	she	244	" a stylish piece of goods . "
2089	2096	2097	2097	she	244	" It 's not my fault , "
2102	2124	2097	2097	she	244	" I meant to occupy that bench , and occupy it I will . What have I to be ashamed of ? "
2546	2557	2542	2542	he	74	" Well , lass , how goes it , like ? "
2637	2645	2646	2646	she	273	" Very well indeed , thank you , "
3230	3235	3237	3237	she	81	" left poorly off . "
3238	3241	3237	3237	she	81	" managed . "
3360	3369	3394	3394	she	317	" And what 's your name , lass ? "
3370	3373	3394	3394	she	317	" Helen . "
3374	3378	3394	3394	she	317	" Helen what ? "
3379	3386	3388	3388	she	317	" Helen , great - stepuncle , "
3966	3972	3964	3964	him	74	" a dear old thing , "
3976	3982	3961	3961	She	79	" a dear old darling . "
4293	4327	4276	4276	he	74	" Match this , if you can . It 's mine , and there 's nothing in the town to beat it . Mrs. Prockter herself has n't got more style than this . "
4359	4368	4369	4369	James	74	" What are you doing i ' Bosley ? "
4372	4380	4381	4381	she	79	" I 'm living i ' Bosley , "
4386	4390	4391	4391	He	74	" Living here ! "
4433	4439	4441	4441	Helen	79	" Mother has married again , "
4445	4448	4449	4449	He	74	" Married ! "
4461	4469	4470	4470	Helen	79	" Yes . And gone to Canada ! "
4637	4640	4642	4643	Helen Rathbone	79	" Yes , "
4645	4659	4642	4643	Helen Rathbone	79	" mother fell in love . Do n't you think it was funny ? "
4660	4667	4668	4669	James Ollerenshaw	74	" That 's as may be , "
4692	4701	4702	4702	Helen	79	" We both thought it was awfully funny , "
4705	4713	4673	4673	his	74	" Both ? Who else is there ? "
4714	4749	4673	4673	his	74	" Why , mother and I , of course ! We used to laugh over it . You see , mother is a very simple creature . And she 's only forty - four . "
4750	4758	4759	4759	James	74	" She 's above forty - four , "
4762	4775	4776	4776	Helen	79	" She told me she was thirty - nine five years ago , "
4779	4792	4776	4776	Helen	79	" Did she tell ye she was forty , four years ago ? "
4793	4804	4673	4673	his	74	" No . At least , I do n't remember . "
4805	4815	4776	4776	Helen	79	" Did she ever tell ye she was forty ? "
4816	4819	4673	4673	his	74	" No . "
4820	4837	4839	4840	James Ollerenshaw	74	" Happen she 's not such a simple creature as ye thought for , my lass , "
4842	4850	4852	4852	Helen	79	" You do n't mean to infer , "
4858	4867	4852	4852	Helen	79	" that my mother would tell me a lie ?
4868	4914	4916	4916	his	74	" All as I mean is that Susan was above thirty - nine five years ago , and I can prove it . I had to get her birth certificate when her father died , and I fancy I 've got it by me yet . "
4920	4931	4916	4916	his	74	" So much for that point . One to me . "
5092	5106	5108	5108	Helen	79	" It was just like mother to tell me fibs about her age , "
5126	5150	5108	5108	Helen	79	" And I shall write and tell her she 's a horrid mean thing . I shall write to her this very night . "
5151	5160	5161	5161	James	74	" So Susan 's gone and married again ! "
5266	5286	5288	5288	Helen	79	" I suppose you do n't know a farmer named Bratt that used to have a farm near Sneyd ? "
5290	5299	5301	5301	James	74	" I ca n't say as I do , "
5303	5311	5313	5313	Helen	79	" Well , that 's the man ! "
5315	5330	5313	5313	Helen	79	" He used to come to Longshaw cattle - market with sheep and things . "
5331	5336	5338	5338	James	74	" Sheep and things ! "
5340	5344	5338	5338	James	74	" What things ? "
5345	5353	5355	5355	Helen	79	" Oh ! I do n't know , "
5359	5364	5355	5355	Helen	79	" Sheep and things . "
5365	5378	5379	5379	James	74	" And what did your mother take to Longshaw cattle - market ? "
5382	5390	5379	5379	James	74	" I understood as she let lodgings . "
5391	5400	5402	5402	Helen	79	" Not since I 've been a teacher , "
5408	5434	5402	5402	Helen	79	" Mother did n't take anything to the cattle - market . But you know our house was just close to the cattle - market . "
5435	5442	5444	5444	James	74	" No , I did n't , "
5448	5459	5444	5444	James	74	" I thought as it was in Aynsley - street . "
5460	5468	5470	5470	Helen	79	" Oh ! that 's years ago ! "
5477	5490	5470	5470	Helen	79	" We 've lived in Sneyd - road for years - years . "
5491	5498	5500	5500	James	74	" I 'll not deny it , "
5502	5510	5511	5511	Helen	79	" The great fault of our house , "
5514	5530	5511	5511	Helen	79	" was that mother dare n't stir out of it on cattle - market days . "
5531	5535	5470	5470	Helen	79	" Why not ? "
5536	5539	5541	5541	Helen	79	" Cows ! "
5543	5561	5541	5541	Helen	79	" Mother simply ca n't look at a cow , and they were passing all the time . "
5562	5575	5576	5576	James	74	" She should ha ' been thankful as it was n't bulls , "
5580	5587	5589	5589	Helen	79	" But I mean bulls too ! "
5591	5604	5589	5589	Helen	79	" In fact , it was a bull that led to it . "
5605	5635	5677	5677	James	74	" What ! Th ' farmer saved her from a mad bull , and she fell in love with him ? He 's younger than her , I lay ! "
5636	5643	5644	5644	Helen	79	" How did you know that ? "
5647	5661	5644	5644	Helen	79	" Besides , he is n't . They 're just the same age . "
5662	5667	5677	5677	James	74	" Forty - four ? "
5684	5692	5677	5677	James	74	" I hope Susan was n't gored ? "
5693	5705	5707	5707	Helen	79	" You 're quite wrong . You 're jumping to conclusions , "
5725	5736	5707	5707	Helen	79	" Things do n't happen like that except in novels . "
5737	5748	5749	5749	James	74	" I 've never read a novel in my life , "
5753	5761	5751	5751	himself	74	" Have n't you ? How interesting ! "
5762	5775	5677	5677	James	74	" But I 've known a woman knocked down by a bull . "
5776	5875	5751	5751	himself	74	" Well , anyhow , mother was n't knocked down by a bull . But there was a mad bull running down the street ; it had escaped from the market . And Mr. Bratt was walking home , and the bull was after him like a shot . Mother was looking out of the window , and she saw what was going on . So she rushed to the front door and opened it , and called to Mr. Bratt to run in and take shelter . And they only just got the door shut in time . "
5876	5880	5882	5882	James	74	" Bless us ! "
5884	5889	5882	5882	James	74	" And what next ? "
5890	5905	5751	5751	himself	74	" Why , I came home from school and found them having tea together . "
5906	5913	5914	5914	James	74	" And ninety year between them ! "
5917	5934	5751	5751	himself	74	" Then Mr. Bratt called every week . He was a widower , with no children . "
5935	5944	5946	5946	James	74	" It could n't ha ' been better , "
5948	5955	5957	5957	Helen	79	" Oh yes , it could , "
5959	6027	5957	5957	Helen	79	" Because I had the greatest difficulty in marrying them ; in fact , at one time I thought I should never do it . I 'm always in the right , and mother 's always in the wrong . She 's admitted that for years . She 's had to admit it . Yet she would go her own way . Nothing would ever cure mother . "
6028	6040	6042	6042	James	74	" She used to talk just like that of your grandfather , "
6044	6060	6042	6042	James	74	" Susan always reckoned as she 'd got more than her fair share of sense . "
6061	6071	6073	6073	Helen	79	" I do n't think she thinks that now , "
6082	6093	6073	6073	Helen	79	" At any rate I 've cured her of that . "
6099	6157	6158	6158	Helen	79	" You see , Mr. Bratt had sold his farm - could n't make it pay - and he was going out to Manitoba . He said he would stop in England . Mother said she would n't let him stop in England where he could n't make a farm pay . She was quite right there , "
6165	6198	6158	6158	Helen	79	" But then she said she would n't marry him and go out to Manitoba , because of leaving me alone here to look after myself ! Can you imagine such a reason ?
6219	6223	6224	6224	she	79	" The idea ! "
6227	6390	6224	6224	she	79	" As if I had n't looked after mother and kept her in order , and myself , too , for several years ! No . She would n't marry him and go out there ! And she would n't marry him and stay here ! She actually began to talk all the usual conventional sort of stuff , you know - about how she had no right to marry again , and she did n't believe in second marriages , and about her duty to me . And so on . You know . I reasoned with her - I explained to her that probably she had another thirty years to live . I told her she was quite young . She is . And why should she make herself permanently miserable , and Mr. Bratt , and me , merely out of a quite mistaken sense of duty ? No use ! I tried everything I could . No use ! "
6391	6399	6212	6212	Helen	79	" She was too much for ye ? "
6400	6405	6407	6407	Helen	79	" Oh , no ! "
6411	6504	6407	6407	Helen	79	" I 'd made up my mind . I arranged things with Mr. Bratt . He quite agreed with me . He took out a licence at the registrar 's , and one Saturday morning - it had to be a Saturday , because I 'm busy all the other days - I went out with mother to buy the meat and things for Sunday 's dinner , and I got her into the registrar 's office - and , well , there she was ! Now , what do you think ? "
6505	6508	6212	6212	Helen	79	" What ? "
6509	6539	6407	6407	Helen	79	" Her last excuse was that she could n't be married because she was wearing her third - best hat . Do n't you think it 's awfully funny ? "
6540	6547	6549	6549	James	74	" That 's as may be , "
6551	6557	6549	6549	James	74	" When was all this ? "
6558	6562	6563	6563	Helen	79	" Just recently , "
6566	6593	6563	6563	Helen	79	" They sailed from Glasgow last Thursday but two . And I 'm expecting a letter by every post to say that they 've arrived safely . "
6594	6606	6407	6407	Helen	79	" And Susan 's left you to take care of yourself ! "
6607	6618	6619	6619	Helen	79	" Now , please do n't begin talking like mother , "
6624	6683	6619	6619	Helen	79	" I 've certainly got less to take care of now than I had . Mother quite saw that . But what difficulty I had in getting her off , even after I 'd safely married her ! I had to promise that if I felt lonely I 'd go and join them . But I sha n't . "
6684	6689	6407	6407	Helen	79	" You wo n't ? "
6690	6707	6619	6619	Helen	79	" No . I do n't see myself on a farm in Manitoba . Do you ? "
6708	6717	6719	6719	James	74	" I do n't know as I do , "
6735	6752	6730	6730	his	74	" So ye saw 'em off at Glasgow . I reckon she made a great fuss ? "
6753	6756	6619	6619	Helen	79	" Fuss ? "
6757	6760	6730	6730	his	74	" Cried . "
6761	6768	6619	6619	Helen	79	" Oh yes , of course . "
6769	6776	6730	6730	his	74	" Did you cry , miss ? "
6777	6783	6785	6785	Helen	79	" Of course I cried , "
6793	6801	6785	6785	Helen	79	" Why do you ask such questions ? "
6802	6810	6730	6730	his	74	" And us'll never see Susan again ? "
6811	6822	6824	6824	Helen	79	" Of course I shall go over and see them , "
6826	6850	6824	6824	Helen	79	" I only meant that I should n't go to stop . I daresay I shall go next year , in the holidays . "
7544	7559	7561	7563	the old man	372	" But you have n't told me what you 're doing i ' Bosley , "
7565	7575	7577	7577	Helen	79	" I 've told you I 'm living here , "
7579	7621	7577	7577	Helen	79	" I 've now been living here for one week and one day . I 'm teaching at the Park Road Board School . I got transferred from Longshaw . I never liked Longshaw , and I always like a change . "
7622	7625	7653	7653	He	74	" Yes , "
7631	7652	7653	7653	He	74	" of the two I reckon as Bosley is the frying - pan . So you 're teaching up yonder ? "
7682	7687	7655	7655	his	74	" What dost teach ? "
7688	7693	7694	7694	Helen	79	" Oh , everything , "
7697	7706	7708	7708	James	74	" You must be very useful to 'em , "
7710	7720	7708	7708	James	74	" What do they pay you for teaching everything ? "
7721	7727	7729	7729	Helen	79	" Seventy - two pounds , "
7731	7763	7708	7708	James	74	" A month ? It ' ud be cheap at a hundred , lass ; unless there 's a whole crowd on ye as can teach everything . Can you sew ? "
7764	7767	7768	7768	she	79	" Sew ! "
7771	7800	7768	7768	she	79	" I 've given lessons in sewing for years . And cookery . And mathematics . I used to give evening lessons in mathematics at Longshaw secondary school . "
8018	8021	8022	8022	he	74	" Mathematics ! "
8025	8051	8022	8022	he	74	" I lay you ca n't tell me the interest on eighty - nine pounds for six months at four and a half per cent . "
8067	8080	8082	8082	she	79	" I 'm really quite surprised you should encourage me to gamble , "
8084	8128	8082	8082	she	79	" But I 'll bet you a shilling I can . And I 'll bet you one shilling against half - a - crown that I do it in my head , if you like . And if I lose I 'll pay . "
8171	8174	8175	8175	he	74	" No , "
8178	8187	8175	8175	he	74	" I 'll none bet ye , lass . "
8263	8277	8279	8279	she	79	" Two pounds and one half - penny - to the nearest farthing , "
8322	8333	8334	8334	he	74	" I make no doubt ye can play the piano ? "
8342	8345	8346	8346	she	79	" Certainly , "
8349	8391	8392	8392	she	79	" Not that we have to teach the piano . No ! But it 's understood , all the same , that one or another of us can play marches for the children to walk and drill to . In fact , "
8395	8432	8392	8392	she	79	" for something less than thirty shillings a week we do pretty nearly everything , except build the schools . And soon they 'll be expecting us to build the new schools in our spare time . "
8455	8461	8463	8463	James	74	" Thirty shillings a wik ! "
8471	8484	8463	8463	James	74	" I thought as you said seventy - two pounds a month ! "
8485	8493	8494	8494	she	79	" Oh no , you did n't ! "
8499	8521	8494	8494	she	79	" So do n't try to tease me . I never joke about money . Money 's a very serious thing . "
8522	8534	8537	8537	himself	74	" Her 's a chip o ' th ' owd block , "
8566	8576	8577	8577	he	74	" You must be same as them hospital nurses , "
8582	8600	8577	8577	he	74	" You do it because ye like it - for love on it , as they say . "
8601	8677	8554	8554	he	74	" Like it ! I hate it . I hate any sort of work . What fun do you suppose there is in teaching endless stupid children , and stuffing in classrooms all day , and correcting exercises and preparing sewing all night ? Of course , they ca n't help being stupid . It 's that that 's so amazing . You ca n't help being kind to them - they 're so stupid . "
8678	8691	8692	8692	James	74	" If ye did n't do that , what should ye do ? "
8695	8706	8708	8708	she	398	" I should n't do anything unless I was forced , "
8710	8774	8708	8708	she	398	" I do n't want to do anything , except enjoy myself - read , play the piano , pay visits , and have plenty of really nice clothes . Why should I want to do anything ? I can tell you this - if I did n't need the money I 'd never go inside that school again , or any other ! "
8779	8786	8787	8787	he	74	" Dun ye mean to say , "
8795	8817	8787	8787	he	74	" that Susan and that there young farmer have gone gadding off to Canada and left you all alone with nothing ? "
8818	8825	8827	8827	Helen	79	" Of course they have n't , "
8829	8854	8827	8827	Helen	79	" Why , mother is the most generous old thing you can possibly imagine . She 's left all her own income to me . "
8855	8859	8787	8787	he	74	" How much ? "
8860	8873	8827	8827	Helen	79	" Well , it comes to rather over thirty shillings a week . "
8874	8901	8787	8787	he	74	" And ca n't a single woman live on thirty shillings a wik ? Bless us ! I do n't spend thirty shillings a wik myself . "
8907	8919	8920	8920	she	79	" A single woman can live on thirty shillings a week , "
8923	8930	8920	8920	she	79	" But what about her frocks ? "
8931	8939	8940	8940	he	399	" Well , what about her frocks ? "
8943	8946	8947	8947	she	79	" Well , "
8950	8984	8947	8947	she	79	" I like frocks . It just happens that I ca n't do without frocks . It 's just frocks that I work for ; I spend nearly all I earn on them . "
8995	9002	8986	8986	her	79	" Look at the present example . "
9003	9018	9019	9019	She	79	" Seventy pounds a year on ye clothes ! Ye're not serious , lass ? "
9025	9030	9031	9031	she	79	" I am serious , "
9097	9115	9116	9116	he	399	" All as I can say is you ought to be ashamed o ' yourself , lass ! "
9239	9241	9233	9233	her	79	" touchy "
9253	9271	9273	9273	she	332	" I shall be very much obliged if you will not speak to me in that tone , "
9275	9328	9273	9273	she	332	" Because I can not permit it either from you or any other man . When I venture to criticise your private life I shall expect you to criticise mine - and not before . I do n't want to be rude , but I hope you understand , great - stepuncle . "

11601	11608	11581	11581	he	74	" Sit ye down , lass . "
12008	12015	12016	12016	she	79	" Which chair do you recommend ? "
12021	12044	11991	11991	Helen	79	" Bless ye , child ! I never sit here , except at th ' desk . I sit in the kitchen . "
12309	12318	12319	12319	she	79	" I suppose you have a good servant ? "
12322	12331	12333	12333	James	74	" I have a woman as comes in , "
12335	12348	12333	12333	James	74	" But her is n't in th ' house at the moment . "
12376	12379	12381	12381	Helen	79	" Well , "
12385	12421	12381	12381	Helen	79	" it 's quite nice , I 'm sure . You must be very comfortable - for a man . But , of course , one can see at once that no woman lives here . "
12422	12425	12426	12426	he	74	" How ? "
12431	12434	12435	12435	she	79	" Oh , "
12438	12448	12435	12435	she	79	" I do n't know . But one can . "
12449	12462	12381	12381	Helen	79	" Dost mean to say as it is n't clean , lass ? "
12463	12470	12472	12472	Helen	79	" The brasses are very clean , "

12907	12912	12860	12860	she	79	" What 's what ? "
12913	12920	12860	12860	she	79	" What 's that as swishes ? "
12952	12955	12956	12956	she	79	" Oh ! "
12959	12974	12956	12956	she	79	" It 's my new silk petticoat , I suppose . You mean that ? "
12991	12994	12996	12998	the old man	372	" Ay ! "
13000	13005	12996	12998	the old man	372	" I mean that . "
13006	13020	13031	13031	She	79	" Yes . It 's my silk petticoat . Do you like it ? "
13021	13030	13031	13031	She	79	" I havena ' seen it , lass . "
13067	13077	13079	13079	he	372	" I do n't know as I dislike it , "
13237	13247	13248	13248	she	79	" Will you mind hanging it on that nail ? "
13428	13437	13438	13438	she	79	" So you have all your meals here ? "
13441	13444	13445	13445	he	372	" Ay , "
13448	13458	13445	13445	he	372	" I have what I call my meals here . "
13459	13462	13463	13463	she	79	" Why , "
13466	13473	13463	13463	she	79	" do n't you enjoy them ? "
13474	13479	13480	13480	he	372	" I eat 'em , "
13483	13491	13492	13492	she	79	" What time do you have tea ? "
13495	13499	13501	13501	he	372	" Four o'clock , "
13503	13506	13501	13501	he	372	" Sharp ! "
13507	13517	13518	13518	she	79	" But it 's a quarter to , now ! "
13538	13549	13518	13518	she	79	" And did n't you say your servant was out ? "
13550	13553	13554	13554	he	372	" Ay , "
13558	13582	13554	13554	he	372	" Her 's out . But her'll come back . Happen her 's gone to get a bit o ' fish or something . "
13583	13594	13518	13518	she	79	" Fish ! Do you always have fish for tea ? "
13595	13603	13604	13604	he	372	" I have what I 'm given , "
13607	13622	13604	13604	he	372	" I fancy a snack for my tea . Something tasty , ye know . "
13623	13626	13627	13627	she	79	" Why , "
13630	13709	13627	13627	she	79	" you 're just like me . I adore tea . I 'd sooner have tea than any other meal of the day . But I never yet knew a servant who could get something tasty every day . Of course , it 's quite easy if you know how to do it ; but servants do n't - that is to say , as a rule - but I expect you 've got a very good one . "
13710	13715	13716	13716	James	74	" So - so ! "
13719	13751	13627	13627	she	79	" The trouble with servants is that they always think that if you like a thing one day you 'll like the same thing every day for the next three years . "
13752	13755	13756	13756	he	372	" Ay , "
13761	13778	13756	13756	he	372	" I used to like a kidney , but it 's more than three years ago . "
13807	13815	13816	13816	she	548	" I ca n't help telling you , "
13819	13841	13816	13816	she	548	" you 're perfectly lovely , great - stepuncle . Are we both going to drink out of the same cup ? "
13861	13866	13867	13867	She	548	" No , no ! "
13871	13887	13867	13867	She	548	" Let me . I 'll do that , as the servant is so long . "
13932	13936	13937	13937	he	372	" Steady on ! "
13941	13948	13937	13937	he	372	" Why dun you choose that ? "
13949	13955	13956	13956	she	548	" Because I like it , "
13965	13975	13976	13976	he	372	" That 's a bit o ' real Spode , "
13998	14007	14008	14008	she	548	" It wo n't be in any danger , "
14011	14033	14008	14008	she	548	" until it comes to be washed up . So I 'll stop afterwards and wash it up myself . There ! "
14034	14045	14046	14046	he	372	" Now you ca n't find the teaspoons , miss ! "
14050	14056	14057	14057	she	548	" I think I can , "
14087	14099	14100	14100	she	548	" Ca n't I just take a peep into the scullery ? "
14108	14155	14100	14100	she	548	" I wo n't stop . It 's nearly time your servant was back , if she 's always so dreadfully prompt as you say . I wo n't touch anything . Servants are so silly . They always think one wants to interfere with them . "
14170	14173	14174	14174	she	548	" Oh , "
14177	14184	14174	14174	she	548	" there 's some one here ! "
14283	14289	14291	14291	he	74	" It 's Mrs. Butt , "
14293	14301	14291	14291	he	74	" Us thought as ye were out . "
14302	14310	14311	14311	Helen	79	" Good - afternoon , Mrs. Butt , "
14321	14328	14363	14363	she	97	" Good - afternoon , miss . "
14329	14346	14363	14363	she	97	" And what have you got for uncle 's tea to - day ? Something tasty ? "
14347	14353	14355	14356	Mrs. Butt	97	" I 've got this , "
14394	14397	14400	14400	James	74	" H'm ! "
14402	14412	14413	14413	Helen	79	" It 's not cooked yet , I see , "
14416	14419	14413	14413	Helen	79	" And - "
14426	14436	14438	14439	Mrs. Butt	97	" No , miss , it 's not cooked , "
14441	14466	14467	14467	She	97	" To tell ye the honest truth , miss , I 've been learning , ' stead o ' cooking this ' ere kidney . "
14483	14537	14467	14467	She	97	" I 'm glad the brasses is clean , miss , at any rate , though the house does look as though there was no woman about the place , and servants are silly . I 'm thankful to Heaven as the brasses is clean . Come into my scullery , and welcome . "
14547	14550	14538	14538	She	97	" H'm ! "
14570	14580	14581	14581	she	97	" You may ' h'm , ' Mester Ollerenshaw , "
14586	14599	14581	14581	she	97	" You may ' h'm ' as much as yo'n a mind . "
14604	14620	14602	14602	Helen	79	" Come in , miss ; come in . Do n't be afraid of servants . "
14632	14638	14602	14602	Helen	79	" But I go out ! "
14663	14666	14668	14669	James Ollerenshaw	74	" There ! "
14671	14677	14668	14669	James Ollerenshaw	74	" You 've done it ! "
14678	14678	14639	14639	She	97	"
15030	15037	15038	15038	she	79	" That 's a veal kidney , "
15042	15055	15056	15056	James	74	" Art sure it is n't a sheep 's kidney , lass ? "
15066	15069	15070	15070	she	79	" Yes , "
15074	15090	15070	15070	she	79	" I gather you are not passionately fond of kidneys , great - stepuncle?'she had asked .
15091	15104	15062	15062	Helen	79	" I was once . What art going to do , lass ? "
15105	15114	15115	15115	she	79	" I 'm going to get our tea , "
15163	15166	15167	15167	he	74	" Well , "
15172	15178	15167	15167	he	74	" what can I do ? "
15179	15185	15186	15186	she	79	" You can go out , "
15190	15217	15186	15186	she	79	" Would n't it be a good thing for you to go out for a walk ? Tea will be ready at half - past four . "
15218	15225	15226	15226	he	74	" I go for no walk , "
15231	15239	15240	15240	she	79	" Yes , that 's all right , "
15317	15337	15307	15307	she	79	" Very well . As you wish . But do go into the front room , at any rate . "
15523	15528	15529	15529	she	79	" My dear uncle , "
15532	15551	15529	15529	she	79	" please do make yourself scarce . You are in my way , and I 'm very busy . "
15582	15591	15592	15592	he	74	" Have ye got all as ye want ? "
15603	15606	15607	15607	she	79	" Everything ! "
15625	15630	15607	15607	she	79	" Have ye indeed ! "

17094	17103	17104	17104	she	600	" You 've watched me quite long enough , "
17145	17150	17151	17151	she	600	" Tea 's ready , "
17324	17328	17314	17314	she	600	" Milk first ! "
17357	17364	17365	17365	he	74	" What difference does it make ? "
17369	17372	17373	17373	she	600	" What ! "
17377	17412	17373	17373	she	600	" You think yourself a great authority on China tea , and yet you do n't know that milk ought to be poured in first ! Why , it makes quite a different taste ! "
17433	17436	17437	17437	she	600	" Here ! "
17440	17462	17463	17463	She	600	" If you do n't mind , I 'll pour out the tea . Thank you . Help yourself to this . "
17469	17486	17463	17463	She	600	" It must be eaten while it 's hot , or it 's worse than useless . "
17491	17498	17551	17551	he	74	" he asked , with false calm .
17499	17506	17507	17507	she	600	" It 's a kidney omelette , "
17510	17513	17514	17514	he	74	" Omelette ! "
17547	17550	17551	17551	he	74	" Omelette ! "
17575	17586	17572	17572	he	74	" You ca n't make an omelette without breaking eggs . "
17687	17690	17691	17691	she	600	" Yes , "
17694	17738	17691	17691	she	600	" Cut it with a knife . Do n't be frightened of it . You 'll eat it ; it wo n't eat you . And please give me very little . I ate a quarter of a pound of chocolates after dinner . "
18118	18124	18125	18125	she	79	" Do you like it ? "
18141	18144	18145	18145	he	74	" Ay , "
18150	18167	18145	18145	he	74	" it 's none so bad . I could do a bit more o ' that . "
18168	18171	18172	18172	she	79	" Well , "
18176	18192	18172	18172	she	79	" do help yourself . Take it all . I sha n't eat any more . "
18193	18196	18197	18197	he	74	" Sure ? "
18385	18394	18395	18395	he	74	" Where didst find this tea , lass ? "
18398	18408	18409	18409	she	79	" In the little corner cupboard in the scullery , "
18412	18427	18409	18409	she	79	" I 'd no idea that people drank such good China tea in Bursley . "
18428	18431	18432	18432	he	74	" Ah ! "
18444	18456	18432	18432	he	74	" China tea was drunk i ' Bursley afore your time . "
18457	18464	18466	18466	she	79	" Mother would only drink Ceylon , "
18468	18475	18477	18477	he	74	" That doesna ' surprise me , "
18501	18511	18496	18496	he	74	" In th ' corner cupboard , sayst tha ? "
18512	18521	18496	18496	he	74	" Yes , in a large tin box . "
18574	18582	18583	18583	he	74	" That there woman was a thief ! "
18586	18590	18583	18583	he	74	" What woman ? "
18591	18595	18597	18597	he	74	" Mrs. Butt . "
18726	18746	18748	18748	Helen	79	" You ca n't have her back , as she is n't honest , even if she comes back , "
18750	18759	18761	18761	James	74	" Oh , her wo n't come back , "
18763	18779	18761	18761	James	74	" Fact is , I 've had difficulties with her for a long time now . "
18780	18792	18748	18748	Helen	79	" Then what shall you do , my poor dear uncle ? "
18793	18796	18798	18798	he	74	" Nay , "
18800	18819	18798	18798	he	74	" I mun ask you that . It was you as was th ' cause of her going . "
18820	18825	18826	18826	she	79	" Oh , uncle ! "
18831	18840	18826	18826	she	79	" How can you say such a thing ? "
18847	18869	18842	18842	she	79	" You ca n't be expected to cook for yourself , can you ? And as for getting a new one - "
18890	18896	18897	18897	he	74	" A new ' un ! "
18907	18917	18918	18918	she	79	" I shall stay and look after your supper , "
18923	18933	18934	18934	He	74	" Yes , and what about to - morrow ? "
18938	18955	18934	18934	He	74	" To - morrow 's Sunday . I 'll come to - morrow , for breakfast . "
18956	18964	18965	18965	His	74	" Yes , and what about Monday ? "
18974	18981	18982	18982	she	79	" I 'll come on Monday , "
18989	19001	18965	18965	His	74	" But your school , where ye teach everything , lass ? "
19002	19012	19014	19014	she	79	" Of course , I shall give up school , "
19016	19076	19014	19014	she	79	" at once . They must do without me . It will mean promotion for some one . I ca n't bother about giving proper notice . Supposing you had been dangerously ill , I should have come , and they would have managed without me . Therefore , they can manage without me . Therefore , they must . "
19279	19522	19255	19255	Helen	79	" I saw the fat old servant in the scullery at once . But uncle thought she was n't there . He is a funny old man - rather silly , like most old men - but I like him , and you can say what you please . He is n't silly really . I instantly decided that I would get rid of that servant . And I did do , and poor uncle never suspected . In a few days I shall come to live here . It 's much safer . Supposing he was taken ill and died , and left all his money to hospitals and things , how awfully stupid that would be ! I told him I should leave the school , and he did n't turn a hair . He 's a dear , and I do n't care a fig for his money - except to spend it for him . His tiny house is simply lovely , terrifically clean , and in the loveliest order . But I 've no intention that we shall stay here . I think I shall take a large house up at Hillport . Uncle is only old in some ways ; in many ways he 's quite young . So I hope he wo n't mind a change . By the way , he told me about your age . My dearest mother , how could you - "
19546	19550	19552	19553	Uncle James	106	" Helen Rathbone , "
19558	19567	19552	19553	Uncle James	106	" have ye been meddling in my cashbox ? "
19642	19655	19657	19657	Helen	79	" You left the key in your cashbox this morning , uncle , "
19665	19677	19657	19657	Helen	79	" while you were fiddling with your safe in your bedroom . "
19684	19687	19678	19678	He	74	" fiddling . "
19704	19707	19708	19708	he	74	" Well , "
19711	19747	19708	19708	he	74	" and if I did ! I was n't upstairs more nor five minutes , and th ' new servant had na ' come ! There was but you and me in th ' house . "
19748	19777	19678	19678	He	74	" Yes . But , you see , I was in a hurry to go out marketing , and I could n't wait for you to come down . "
19783	19792	19794	19794	he	74	" There 's a tenpun ' note missing , "
19796	19827	19794	19794	he	74	" Do n't play them tricks on me , lass ; I 'm getting an oldish man . Where hast hidden it ? I mun go to th ' bank . "
19832	19837	19838	19838	she	639	" My dear uncle , "
19841	19872	19838	19838	she	639	" I 've not hidden your ten - pound note . I wanted some money in a hurry , so I took it . I 've spent some of it . "
19873	19879	19880	19880	he	74	" Spent some of it ! "
19883	19889	19880	19880	he	74	" How much hast spent ? "
19890	19907	19838	19838	she	639	" Oh , I do n't know . But I make up my accounts every night . "
19908	19911	19913	19913	he	74	" Lass , "
19922	19940	19913	19913	he	74	" this wo n't do . I let ye know at once . This wunna ' do . "
19968	19978	19952	19952	She	639	" May I ask what you mean , uncle ? "
20038	20061	20022	20022	he	74	" - that is to say , Shakespearean prose . But the aristocratic , insolent perfection of Helen 's gown gave him pause .
20062	20070	20071	20071	he	74	" Why did n't you tell me ? "
20074	20083	20084	20084	she	639	" I merely did n't think of it , "
20087	20094	20084	20084	she	639	" I 've been very busy . "
20095	20110	20111	20111	he	74	" If you wanted money , why did n't you ask me for it ? "
20114	20123	20125	20125	she	639	" I 've been here over a week , "
20127	20205	20125	20125	she	639	" and you 've given me a pound and a postal order for ten shillings , which I had to ask for . Surely you must have guessed , uncle , that even if I 'd put the thirty shillings in the savings bank we could n't live on the interest of it , and that I was bound to want more . Something like seventy meals have been served in this house since I entered it . "
20206	20216	20217	20217	he	74	" I gave Mrs. Butt a pound a wik , "
20220	20231	20232	20232	she	639	" But think what a good manager Mrs. Butt was ! "
20296	20310	20311	20311	he	74	" It 's easy enough to ask for money when you want it , "
20314	20321	20322	20322	she	639	" I hate asking for money , "
20325	20330	20322	20322	she	639	" All women do . "
20331	20345	20346	20346	he	74	" Then am I to be inquiring every morning whether you want money ? "
20351	20356	20357	20357	she	639	" Certainly , uncle , "
20360	20368	20357	20357	she	639	" How else are you to know ? "
20498	20502	20492	20492	Helen	79	" Helen Rathbone ! "
20635	20645	20622	20622	Helen	79	" Tenants will please go round to the back . "
20646	20650	20651	20651	he	74	" Bless us ! "
20720	20726	20673	20674	the lady	654	" Is Miss Rathbone here ? "
20740	20743	20793	20793	Sally	107	" Sally ! "
20751	20754	20793	20793	Sally	107	" Nell ! "
21089	21100	21101	21101	she	79	" And there are your books there , I see ! "
21124	21153	21101	21101	she	79	" How lovely ! You remember you promised to lend me that book of Thoreau 's - what did you call it ? - and you never did ! "
21154	21166	21168	21168	Helen	79	" Next time you come I 'll find it for you , "
21211	21225	21226	21226	She	107	" It must be very nice for you to have Nell like this ! "

21294	21303	21305	21305	Sarah	107	" It 's a great change for you , "
21307	21310	21311	21311	he	74	" Ay , "
21314	21319	21311	21311	he	74	" it 's that . "
21398	21719	21393	21393	she	79	" of his ten - pound note ! He had seen hats in Brunt 's marked as high as two guineas but he had not dreamt that such hats would ever enter his house . While he had been labouring , collecting his rents and arranging for repairs , throughout the length and the breadth of Bursley and Turnhill , she , under pretence of marketing , had been flinging away ten - pound notes at Brunt 's . The whole business was fantastic , simply and madly fantastic ; so fantastic that he had not yet quite grasped the reality of it ! The whole business was unheard of . He saw , with all the clearness of his masculine intellect , that it must cease . The force with which he decided within himself that it must cease - and instanter ! - bordered upon the hysterical . As he had said , plaintively , he was an oldish man . His habits , his manners , and his notions , especially his notions about money , were fixed and set like plaster of Paris in a mould . Helen 's conduct was nothing less than dangerous . It might bring him to a sudden death from heart disease . Happily , he had had a very good week indeed with his rents . He trotted about all day on Mondays and on Tuesday mornings , gathering his rents , and on Tuesday afternoons he usually experienced the assuaged content of an alligator after the weekly meal . Otherwise there was no knowing what might not have been the disastrous consequences of Helen 's barefaced robbery and of her unscrupulous , unrepentant defence of that robbery . For days and days he had imagined himself in heaven with a seraph who was also a good cook . He had forty times congratulated himself on catching Helen . And now !
21991	21998	22000	22000	Emanuel	95	" Is Miss Rathbone at home ? "
22006	22009	22040	22040	James	74	" Helen ? "
22010	22015	22040	22040	James	74	" Ye - es . "
22016	22019	22021	22021	James	74	" Ay , "
22025	22032	22021	22021	James	74	" Her 's quite at home . "
22033	22039	22040	22040	James	74	" Can I see her ? "
22047	22055	22057	22057	he	74	" Happen you 'd better step inside , "
22059	22075	22021	22021	James	74	" Thanks , Mr. Ollerenshaw . What - er - fine weather we 're having ! "
22101	22111	22085	22085	He	74	" Helen , a young man to see ye . "
22261	22263	22282	22282	she	79	" finished "
22342	22352	22353	22353	Sarah	107	" Whatever made you think of coming to Bursley ? "
22356	22367	22369	22369	Helen	79	" Do n't you think it 's better than Longshaw ? "
22371	22414	22353	22353	Sarah	107	" Yes , my darling child . But that 's not why you came . If you ask me , I believe it was your deliberate intention to capture your great - uncle . Anyhow , I congratulate you on your success . "
22415	22418	22419	22419	Helen	79	" Ah ! "
22426	22436	22419	22419	Helen	79	" I 'm not out of the wood yet . "
22437	22443	22353	22353	Sarah	107	" What do you mean ? "
22444	22483	22419	22419	Helen	79	" Well , you see , uncle and I have n't quite decided whether he is to have his way or I am to have mine ; we were both thinking about it when you happened to call . "
22494	22502	22419	22419	Helen	79	" Are people talking about us much ? "
22532	22549	22551	22551	Sarah	107	" I 've only been here a day or two , so I can scarcely judge , "
22553	22570	22551	22551	Sarah	107	" But Lilian came in from the art school this morning with an armful of chatter . "
22571	22579	22580	22580	Helen	79	" Let me see , I forget , "
22583	22596	22580	22580	Helen	79	" Is Lilian the youngest , or the next to the youngest ? "
22597	22621	22551	22551	Sarah	107	" My dearest child , Lilian is the youngest but one , of course ; but she 's grown up now - naturally . "
22622	22654	22580	22580	Helen	79	" What ! When I saw her last , that day when she was with you at Knype , she had a ribbon in her hair , and she looked ten . "
22655	22666	22551	22551	Sarah	107	" She 's eighteen . And have n't you heard ? "
22667	22671	22580	22580	Helen	79	" Heard what ? "
22672	22699	22551	22551	Sarah	107	" Do you mean to say you 've been in Bursley a week and more , and have n't heard ? Surely you know Andrew Dean ? "
22700	22706	22708	22708	Helen	79	" I know Andrew Dean , "
22716	22724	22551	22551	Sarah	107	" When did you last see him ? "
22725	22733	22551	22551	Sarah	107	" Oh , about a fortnight ago . "
22734	22763	22551	22551	Sarah	107	" It was before that . He did n't tell you ? Well , it 's just like him , that is ; that 's Andrew all over ! "
22764	22768	22551	22551	Sarah	107	" What is ? "
22769	22793	22551	22551	Sarah	107	" He 's engaged to Lilian . It 's the first engagement in the family , and she 's the youngest but one , "
22819	22825	22826	22826	she	79	" I scarcely know Lilian , "
22831	22861	22826	22826	she	79	" And I do n't know your mother at all . But I must call and congratulate the child . No , Andrew Dean did n't breathe a word . "
22862	22927	22794	22794	Helen	79	" I may tell you as a dreadful secret , Nell , that we are n't any of us in the seventh heaven about it . Aunt Annie said yesterday : ' I do n't know that I 'm so set up with it as all that , Jane ' meaning mother . We are n't so set up with it as all that . "
22928	22932	22826	22826	she	79	" Why not ? "
22933	22959	22794	22794	Helen	79	" Oh , we are n't . I do n't know why . I pretend to be , lest Lilian should imagine I 'm jealous . "
23051	23056	23041	23041	they	717	" old Jimmy Ollerenshaw , "
23060	23063	23041	23041	they	717	" Jimmy . "
23280	23286	23288	23288	Helen	79	" Suppose we have tea , "
23803	23806	23808	23808	Helen	79	" Yes , "
23810	23815	23808	23808	Helen	79	" it 's small . "
23816	23840	23870	23870	Helen	79	" But , my child , you 've always been used to a small house , surely . I think it 's just as quaint
23848	23848	23870	23870	Helen	79	"
23849	23860	23870	23870	Helen	79	" Would you like to live in a little museum ? "
23873	23922	23870	23870	Helen	79	" I 've always lived in a small house , just as I 've taught six hours a day in a school . But not because I wanted to . I like room . I daresay that uncle and I may find another house one of these days . "
23923	23931	23932	23932	Emanuel	95	" Up at Hillport , I hope , "
23948	23952	23954	23954	Helen	79	" Who knows ? "
23963	23970	23971	23971	he	74	" What 's that ye're saying ? "
23976	23989	23991	23991	Sarah	107	" I was just saying how quaint and pretty your house is , "
24042	24051	24053	24053	Helen	79	" And now , you dear old thing , "
24061	24076	24053	24053	Helen	79	" you shall have your tea . You 've behaved like a perfect angel . "
24178	24184	24185	24185	she	79	" I 'm going out , "
24343	24352	24353	24353	she	79	" May I come in , Mr. Ollerenshaw ? "
24359	24382	24353	24353	she	79	" I hope you will excuse this very informal call . I 've altered my dinner hour in order to pay it . "
24397	24405	24406	24406	he	74	" Come in , missis , do ! "
24513	24517	24519	24519	she	79	" Thank you , "
24581	24584	24585	24585	she	79	" Ah ! "
24648	24662	24663	24663	she	79	" I wonder what you will think of me , calling like this ? "
24798	24811	24812	24812	James	74	" Anyhow , I 'm glad to see ye , Mrs. Prockter , "
24984	24987	24949	24950	Mrs. Prockter	84	" nonsense . "
25009	25019	25020	25020	she	84	" May I ask if your niece is in ? "
25028	25033	25020	25020	she	84	" She is n't . "
25073	25076	25078	25079	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Well , "
25081	25142	25078	25079	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I 'm not sorry she is n't . But if she had been I should have spoken just the same - not to her , but to you . Now , Mr. Ollerenshaw , I think you and I are rather alike in some things . I hate beating about the bush , and I imagine that you do . "
25192	25196	25198	25198	he	74	" I expect , "
25200	25221	25198	25198	he	74	" it 's pretty well known i ' this town as I 'm not one that beats about the bush . "
25222	25225	25227	25227	she	84	" Good ! "
25229	25237	25227	25227	she	84	" You know my stepson , Emanuel ? "
25238	25246	25247	25247	James	74	" He was here a bit since , "
25250	25258	25227	25227	she	84	" What do you think of him ? "
25259	25262	25227	25227	she	84	" How ? "
25263	25268	25227	25227	she	84	" As a man ? "
25269	25292	25227	25227	she	84	" Well , missis , as we are na ' beating about the bush , I think he 's a foo ' . "
25293	25301	25302	25302	she	84	" Now that 's what I like ! "
25308	25450	25302	25302	she	84	" He is a fool , Mr. Ollerenshaw - between ourselves . I can see that you and I will get on together splendidly ! Emanuel is a fool . I ca n't help it . I took him along with my second husband , and I do my best for him . But I 'm not responsible for his character . As far as that goes , he is n't responsible for it , either . Not only is he a fool , but he is a conceited fool , and an idle fool ; and he ca n't see a joke . At the same time he is quite honest , and I think he 's a gentleman . But being a gentleman is no excuse for being a fool ; indeed , I think it makes it worse . "
25451	25458	25459	25459	James	74	" Nothing can make it worse , "
25478	25489	25463	25463	She	770	" You say Emanuel has been here to - day ? "
25490	25493	25495	25495	James	74	" Ay ! "
25497	25510	25495	25495	James	74	" He came in an ' had a sup o ' tea . "
25511	25519	25463	25463	She	770	" Do you know why he came ? "
25520	25571	25495	25495	James	74	" Maybe he felt faintlike , and slipped in here as there 's no public nearer than the Queen Adelaide . Or maybe he thought as I was getting on in years , and he wanted for to make my acquaintance afore I died . I didna ' ask him . "
25572	25578	25580	25581	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I see you understand , "
25583	25594	25580	25581	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Mr. Ollerenshaw , my stepson is courting your niece . "
25595	25600	25601	25601	James	74	" Great - stepniece , "
25607	25632	25601	25601	James	74	" Is he now ? To tell ye th ' truth I did n't know till th ' other day as they were acquainted . "
25633	25641	25642	25643	Mrs. Prockter	84	" They have n't been acquainted long , "
25647	25760	25642	25643	Mrs. Prockter	84	" You may have heard that Emanuel is thinking of going into partnership with Mr. Andrew Dean - a new glaze that Mr. Dean has invented . The matter may turn out well , because all that Mr. Dean really wants is a sleeping partner with money . Emanuel has the money , and I think he can be guaranteed to sleep . Your stepniece met Emanuel by accident through Mr. Dean some weeks ago , over at Longshaw . They must have taken to each other at once . And I must tell you that not merely is my stepson courting your niece , but your niece is courting my stepson . "
25761	25768	25642	25643	Mrs. Prockter	84	" You surprise me , missis ! "
25769	25873	25642	25643	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I daresay I do . But , it is the fact . She is n't a Churchwoman ; at least , she was n't a Churchwoman at Longshaw ; she was Congregational , and not very much at that . You are n't a Churchman , either ; but your niece now goes to St. Luke 's every Sunday . So does my stepson . Your niece is out to - night . So is my stepson . And if they are not together somewhere I shall be very much astonished . Of course , the new generation does as it likes . "
25874	25879	25880	25880	James	74	" And what next ? "
25883	25891	25893	25895	the mature lady	771	" I 'll tell you what next , "
25903	25972	25893	25895	the mature lady	771	" I like your niece . I 've met her twice at the St. Luke 's Guild , and I like her . I should have asked her to come and see me , only I 'm determined not to encourage her with Emanuel . Mr. Ollerenshaw , I 'm not going to have her marrying Emanuel , and that 's why I 've come to see you . "
26035	26038	26039	26039	she	84	" Oh ! "
26046	26237	26039	26039	she	84	" it 's not because I think your niece is n't good enough for Emanuel ; it 's because I think she 's a great deal too good ! And yet it is n't that , either . The truth is , Mr Ollerenshaw , I 'm a purely selfish woman . I 'm the last person in the world to stand in the way of my poor stepson getting a better wife than he deserves . And if the woman chooses to throw herself away on him , that 's not my affair . What I scent danger in is that your stepniece would find my stepson out . At present she 's smitten by his fancy waistcoat . But she would soon see through the fancy waistcoat - and then there would be a scandal . If I have not misjudged your stepniece , there would be a scandal , and I do not think that I have misjudged her . She is exactly the sort of young woman who , when she had discovered she had made a mistake , would walk straight out of the house . "
26238	26242	26243	26243	James	74	" She is ! "
26251	26322	26347	26347	her	776	" And Emanuel , having no sense of humour , would leave nothing undone to force her back again . Imagine the scandal , Mr. Ollerenshaw ! Imagine my position ; imagine yours ! Me , in an affair like that ! I wo n't have it - that is to say , I wo n't have it if I can stop it . Now , what can we do ? "
26366	26369	26370	26370	he	74	" Nowt ! "
26413	26416	26419	26419	she	776	" airs . "
26453	26461	26462	26462	she	776	" You think we can do nothing ? "
26485	26491	26462	26462	she	776	" What can us do ? "
26492	26504	26505	26505	She	776	" You might praise Emanuel to her - urge her on . "
26531	26534	26535	26535	he	74	" Ay ! "
26538	26569	26535	26535	he	74	" I might . But if I 'm to urge her on , why didna ' ye ask her to your house like , and chuck 'em at each other ? "
26580	26589	26590	26590	she	776	" You are quite right , Mr. Ollerenshaw , "
26593	26600	26601	26601	he	74	" It 's a dangerous game , "
26619	26625	26627	26627	she	776	" I must think it over "
26633	26750	26627	26627	she	776	" I feel much easier now I 've told you all about it . And common - sense , middle - aged people like you and me can manage to do what we want . Dear me ! How annoying stepsons are ! Obviously , Emanuel ought to marry another fool . And goodness knows there are plenty to choose from . And yet he must needs go and fall in love with almost the only sensible girl in the town ! There 's no end to that boy 's foolishness . He actually wants me to buy Wilbraham Hall , furniture , and everything ! What do you think it 's worth , Mr. Ollerenshaw ? "
26751	26762	26834	26834	she	783	" Worth ? It 's worth what it 'll fetch . "
26763	26767	26627	26627	she	776	" Eight thousand ? "
26768	26775	26777	26777	James	74	" The land 's worth that , "
26779	26805	26627	26627	she	776	" It 's a silly idea . But he put it into my head . Now will you drop in one day and see me ? "
26806	26809	26811	26811	James	74	" No , "
26813	26824	26811	26811	James	74	" I 'm not much for teaparties , thank ye . "
26825	26833	26834	26834	she	783	" I mean when I 'm alone , "
26858	26858	26834	26834	she	783	"
26877	26891	26871	26871	his	74	" Happen I may look in some morning when I 'm round yonder . "
26892	26901	26902	26902	she	783	" That will be very nice of you , "
27050	27053	27023	27023	He	74	" Jimmy . "
27638	27645	27635	27635	she	79	" Good - morning , uncle . "
27663	27672	27674	27674	he	74	" Th ' servant has na ' come , "
27702	27705	27706	27706	she	79	" Oh ! "
27737	27776	27730	27730	she	79	" I 'm not surprised . You 'll never get servants to be prompt in the morning when they do n't sleep in the house . And there 's no room for Georgiana to sleep in the house . "
27782	27796	27797	27797	he	74	" Mrs. Butt was always prompt . I 'll say that for her , "
27822	27839	27818	27818	she	79	" I 'm sure Mrs. Butt would be delighted to come back if you asked her , "
27903	27910	27911	27911	Helen	79	" Good - morning , Georgiana , "
28166	28179	28180	28180	he	74	" I 've been reading one o ' your books , lass , "
28187	28247	28180	28180	he	74	" It 's pretty near as good as a newspaper . There 's summat about a law case as goes on for ever . It isna ' true , I suppose , but it might be . The man as wrote that knew what he was talking about for once in a way . It 's rare and good . "
28248	28255	28256	28256	she	79	" You mean Jarndyce v. Jarndyce ? "
28270	28273	28274	28274	he	74	" Ay , "
28277	28291	28274	28274	he	74	" I believe that is the name . How didst know , lass ? "
28292	28297	28298	28298	she	79	" I just guessed , "
28301	28315	28298	28298	she	79	" I suppose you do n't have much time for reading , uncle ? "
28316	28320	28322	28322	he	74	" Not me ! "
28324	28351	28322	28322	he	74	" I 'm one o ' th ' busiest men in Bosley . And if ye do n't know it now , you will afore long . "
28352	28355	28356	28356	she	79	" Oh ! "
28359	28402	28356	28356	she	79	" I 've noticed that . But what can you expect ? With all those rents to collect yourself ! Of course , I think you 're quite right to collect them yourself . Rent - collectors can soon ruin a property . "
28445	28451	28452	28452	he	74	" Ye're right , lass , "
28455	28477	28452	28452	he	74	" It 's small houses as mean trouble . You 're never done - wi ' cottage property . Always summat ! "
28478	28488	28489	28489	she	79	" It 's all small , is n't it ? "
28493	28510	28489	28489	she	79	" About how much do the rents average ? Three - and - six a week ? "
28511	28515	28516	28516	he	74	" About that , "
28525	28537	28538	28538	she	79	" I ca n't imagine how you carry the money about , "
28541	28550	28538	28538	she	79	" It must be very heavy for you . "
28551	28557	28558	28558	he	74	" I 'll tell you , "
28561	28657	28558	28558	he	74	" I 've got my own system o ' collecting . If I had n't , I couldna ' get through . In each street I 've one tenant as I trust . And the other tenants can leave their rent and their rent books there . When they do that regular for a month , I give 'em twopence apiece for their children . If they do it regular for a year , I mak ' 'em a present of a wik 's rent at Christmas . It 's cheaper nor rent - collectors . "
28658	28663	28664	28664	she	823	" What a good idea "
28669	28679	28664	28664	she	823	" But how do you carry the money about ? "
28680	28785	28558	28558	he	74	" I bank i ' Bosley , and I bank i ' Turnhill , too . And I bank once i ' Bosley and twice i ' Turnhill o ' Mondays , and twice i ' Bosley o ' Tuesdays . Only yesterday I was behind . I reckon as I can do all my collecting between nine o'clock Monday and noon Tuesday . I go to th ' worst tenants first - be sure o ' that . There 's some o ' 'em , if you do n't catch 'em early o ' Monday , you do n't catch 'em at all . "
28786	28805	28806	28806	she	824	" It 's incredible to me how you can do it all in a day and a half , "
28809	28818	28806	28806	she	824	" Why , how many houses are there ? "
28819	28829	28830	28830	he	825	" Near two hundred and forty i ' Bosley , "
28833	28844	28830	28830	he	825	" Hast forgotten th ' sugar this time , lass ? "
28845	28850	28851	28851	she	824	" And in Turnhill ? "
28858	28875	28851	28851	she	824	" I think I 'll have that piece of bacon if you do n't want it . "
28876	28881	28883	28883	he	825	" Over a hundred , "
28885	28891	28883	28883	he	825	" A hundred and twenty . "
28892	28926	28967	28967	she	824	" So that , first and last , you have to handle about sixty pounds each week , and all in silver and copper . Fancy ! What a weight it must be ! "
28927	28930	28931	28931	he	825	" Ay ! "
28939	28948	28949	28949	she	824	" That 's three thousand a - year , "
28984	29002	29003	29003	she	824	" I expect you must have saved at the very least thirty thousand pounds by this time , "
29023	29032	29033	29033	she	824	" That means another thirty pounds a week , "
29052	29057	29058	29058	she	824	" By the way , "
29061	29085	29058	29058	she	824	" I must look into my household accounts . How much did you tell me you allowed Mrs. Butt a week for expenses ? "
29086	29090	29091	29091	he	825	" A pound , "
29101	29112	29113	29113	she	824	" You do n't own the house , do you ? "
29116	29119	29120	29120	he	825	" No , "
29123	29129	29096	29096	She	824	" What 's the rent ? "
29130	29134	29135	29135	he	825	" Eighteen pounds , "
29148	29161	29162	29162	she	824	" The worst of this house is that it has no bathroom , "
29165	29178	29162	29162	she	824	" Still , eighteen pounds a year is eighteen pounds a year . "
29227	29243	29246	29246	her	824	" The Kiel butter at a shilling a pound is quite good enough , Georgiana , "
29267	29276	29277	29277	she	824	" There 's that ten - pound note , "
29286	29299	29277	29277	she	824	" I 've got enough of my own to get on with . "
29503	29506	29507	29507	He	825	" Jimmy . "
29648	29654	29638	29638	she	84	" My dear Mr. Ollerenshaw . "
29655	29668	29638	29638	she	84	" Believe me , yours most cordially and sincerely , Flora Prockter . "
29732	29738	29727	29728	Mrs. Prockter	84	" In pursuance of our plan "
29744	29848	29727	29728	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I am also inviting your niece . Indeed , I have gathered from Emanuel that he considers her as the prime justification of the party . We will throw them together . She will hear him sing . She has never heard him sing . If this does not cure her , nothing will , though he has a nice voice . I hope it will be a fine night , so that we may take the garden . I did not thank you half enough for the exceedingly kind way in which you received my really unpardonable visit the other evening , "
29971	29981	29982	29982	Helen	79	" Have you had an invitation from Mrs. Prockter ? "
29988	29991	29993	29993	he	74	" Yes , "
29995	29999	29993	29993	he	74	" Have you ? "
30000	30003	30005	30005	she	79	" Yes , "
30007	30012	30005	30005	she	79	" Shall you go ? "
30013	30022	29993	29993	he	74	" Ay , lass , I shall go . "
30028	30033	30034	30034	he	74	" Us'll go together , "
30037	30047	30049	30049	she	79	" I do n't think that I shall go , "
30053	30060	30005	30005	she	79	" Have ye written to refuse ? "
30061	30064	30005	30005	she	79	" No . "
30065	30077	30005	30005	she	79	" Then I should advise ye to go , my lass . "
30078	30081	30005	30005	she	79	" Why ? "
30082	30092	30094	30094	he	74	" Unless ye want to have trouble with me , "
30098	30103	30005	30005	she	79	" But , uncle - "
30104	30115	30005	30005	she	79	" It 's no good butting uncle , ' he replied "
30172	30172	30166	30166	I	0	"
30173	30176	30177	30177	she	1738	" Uncle ! "
30180	30202	30177	30177	she	1738	" How can you say such a thing ? You ought to know that no such idea ever entered my head . "
30272	30284	30285	30285	she	1738	" Of course , if you take it in that way , "
30292	30297	30285	30285	she	1738	" I will go . "
30533	30539	30541	30541	she	1738	" You look very well , "
30545	30555	30541	30541	she	1738	" That old - fashioned black necktie is splendid . "
30680	30682	30675	30676	This child	865	" Jos "
30692	30695	30697	30697	they	1957	" Enid , "
30703	30717	30697	30697	they	1957	" Lilian , the newly - affianced one , was not in the crowd .
30718	30723	30724	30724	Helen	79	" Where 's Lilian ? "
30729	30740	30742	30747	the youthful and rather jealous Jos	867	" Oh , she came earlier with the powerful Andrew , "
30749	30758	30742	30747	the youthful and rather jealous Jos	867	" She is n't an ordinary girl now . "
31061	31069	31071	31071	James	74	" Male and female created He them ! "
31116	31121	31094	31095	Ronald Swetnam	123	" S - sh ! "
31286	31294	31295	31295	she	84	" Emanuel is just going to sing , "
31563	31567	31568	31568	he	95	" O Love ! "
31587	31591	31581	31581	its	902	" O Love ! "
31592	31596	31597	31597	Emanuel	95	" O Love ! "
31835	31839	31830	31830	he	95	" O Love ! "
31991	32010	32011	32011	he	95	" I hope the pianist will not be so atrociously clumsy as to let my voice crack again , "
32108	32113	32115	32115	Emanuel	95	" Oh , rapture ! "
32125	32137	32121	32121	he	95	" One - and - eleven - pence three - farthings . "
32138	32143	32145	32145	Jos	126	" Oh , rats ! "
32154	32165	32167	32167	Adams	124	" It was nearly as long as Jarndyce v. Jarndyce , "
32174	32177	32179	32179	James	74	" What ! "
32183	32191	32179	32179	James	74	" Have you been reading that too ? "
32455	32464	32465	32465	Sarah	107	" Oh , here 's Andrew , Helen ! "
32714	32719	32721	32721	Sarah	107	" Why , Nell , "
32725	32731	32721	32721	Sarah	107	" what 's the matter ? "
32732	32735	32737	32737	Helen	79	" Nothing , "
32741	32758	32721	32721	Sarah	107	" But surely you shake hands with Andrew when you meet him , do n't you ? "
32759	32769	32771	32771	Helen	79	" That depends how I feel , my dear , "
32773	32780	32721	32721	Sarah	107	" Then something is the matter ? "
32781	32788	32790	32790	Helen	79	" If you want to know , "
32795	32824	32790	32790	Helen	79	" in the hall , just now - that is - I - I overheard Mr. Dean say something about Emanuel Prockter 's singing which I consider very improper "
32825	32830	32721	32721	Sarah	107	" But we all - "
32831	32840	32842	32842	Helen	79	" I 'm going out into the garden , "
32844	32853	32854	32854	James	74	" A pretty how - d'ye - do ! "
32920	32924	32925	32925	he	74	" Bless us ! "
32951	32977	32946	32946	he	74	" A pretty how - d'ye - do ! The chit 's as fixed on that there Emanuel Prockter as ever a chit could be ! "
33032	33038	33039	33039	she	84	" Ah , Mr. Ollerenshaw , "
33042	33059	33039	33039	she	84	" everybody seems to be choosing the garden . Shall we go there ? This way . "
33069	33074	33075	33075	she	84	" By the bye , "
33082	33090	33075	33075	she	84	" I think our plan is succeeding . "
33126	33130	33131	33131	he	74	" Bless us ! "
33148	33164	33166	33167	Mrs. Prockter	84	" It 's horrid of me to make fun of poor dear Emanuel 's singing , "
33169	33186	33166	33167	Mrs. Prockter	84	" But how did she take it ? If I am not mistaken , she winked . "
33187	33191	33193	33193	James	74	" Her winked , "
33195	33201	33193	33193	James	74	" yes , her winked . "
33202	33209	33166	33167	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Then everything 's all right . "
33210	33213	33215	33215	he	74	" Missis , "
33217	33244	33215	33215	he	74	" if you do n't mind what ye're about , you 'll have a daughter - in - law afore you can say ' knife ' ! "
33245	33249	33166	33167	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Not Helen ? "
33250	33255	33215	33215	he	74	" Ay , Helen . "
33256	33262	33166	33167	Mrs. Prockter	84	" But , Mr. Ollerenshaw - "
33302	33308	33312	33312	him	74	" I 'll join ye . "
33348	33354	33355	33355	she	84	" Oh , Mrs. Prockter , "
33358	33370	33355	33355	she	84	" what a pity we ca n't dance on the lawn ! "
33371	33380	33382	33383	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I wish you could , my dear , "
33385	33392	33394	33394	James	74	" And why ca n't ye ? "
33396	33400	33402	33402	Joe	126	" No music ! "
33404	33408	33409	33410	Mrs. Prockter	84	" You see , "
33413	33457	33409	33410	Mrs. Prockter	84	" the lawn is at the far end of the garden , and it is impossible to hear the piano so far off . If it were only a little piano we could move it about , but it 's a grand piano . "
33472	33476	33477	33477	he	74	" Look here , "
33480	33496	33477	33477	he	74	" it 's nobbut a step from here to the Green Man , is it ? "
33497	33502	33504	33505	Mrs. Prockter	84	" The Green Man ! "
33510	33516	33504	33505	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Ay , the pub ! "
33517	33528	33530	33531	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I believe there is an inn at the bend , "
33533	33546	33530	33531	Mrs. Prockter	84	" but I do n't think I 've ever noticed the sign . "
33547	33554	33556	33556	James	74	" It 's the Green Man , "

35084	35097	35079	35079	he	74	" I 'll give her a guinea to spend as she likes . "
35124	35136	35137	35137	he	74	" Dashed if I do n't give the wench a fiver ! "
35237	35245	35246	35246	he	74	" If I gave her a tenner , "
35249	35277	35246	35246	he	74	" that would make her see as I 'd settled to forget that business , and let bygones be bygones . I 'll give her a tenner . "
35366	35369	35348	35348	He	74	" Helen ! "

35730	35737	35738	35738	he	74	" What 's in the wind ? "
35753	35758	35759	35759	she	79	" The fact is , "
35762	35779	35759	35759	she	79	" I want to show you a house up at Hillport that might do for us . '
35802	35805	35806	35806	he	74	" Flitting , "

35940	35944	35945	35945	James	74	" Rather spacious ! "
36481	36497	36498	36498	James	74	" It ' ud be like living in th ' covered market , living here , "
36552	36557	36559	36559	James	74	" By the way , "
36561	36567	36559	36559	James	74	" where 's them childer ? "
36590	36599	36601	36603	the fat caretaker	1049	" I believe they 're upstairs , ma'am , "
36611	36616	36618	36619	Mrs. Prockter	84	" You can go , "
36629	36638	36618	36619	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I will see you before I leave . "
36680	36689	36690	36690	she	84	" I may tell you , Mr. Ollerenshaw , "
36700	36775	36690	36690	she	84	" that I have not the slightest intention of buying this place . Emanuel takes advantage of my good nature . You 've no idea how persistent he is . So all you have to do is to advise me firmly not to buy it . That 's why I 've asked you to come up . He acknowledges that you 're an authority , and he 'll be forced to accept your judgment . "
36776	36787	36789	36789	James	74	" Why did n't ye say that afore , missis ? "
36792	36796	36690	36690	she	84	" Before when ? "
36797	36825	36690	36690	she	84	" Before that kick - up party o ' yours . He got out of me then as I thought it were dirt cheap at eight thousand . "
36826	36835	36837	36838	Mrs. Prockter	84	" But I do n't want to move , "
36840	36853	36854	36854	James	74	" I 'm asking ye why ye did n't tell me afore ? "
36863	36869	36870	36870	she	84	" Men are trying creatures ! "
36873	36886	36888	36888	she	84	" So it seems you ca n't tell a tarradiddle for me ? "
36891	36910	36888	36888	she	84	" I do n't know as I object to that . What I object to is contradicting mysen . "
36911	36918	36919	36920	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Why did you bring Helen ? "
36923	36932	36919	36920	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I didna ' . She come hersen . "
36937	36947	36888	36888	she	84	" And now she and Emanuel have run off . "
36948	36954	36956	36956	James	74	" It looks to me , "
36958	36980	36956	36956	James	74	" as if your plan for knocking their two heads together wasna ' turning out as you meant it , missis . "
36981	36987	36989	36989	she	84	" And what 's more , "
36991	37033	36989	36989	she	84	" I do believe that Emanuel wants me to buy this place so that when I 'm gone he can make a big splash here with your niece and your money , Mr. Ollerenshaw ! What do you think of that ? "
37034	37053	37054	37054	James	74	" He may make as much splash as he 's a mind to , wi ' my niece , "
37057	37076	37054	37054	James	74	" But he wo n't make much of a splash with my money , I can promise ye . "
37081	37087	37088	37088	he	74	" I can promise ye , "
37091	37103	36989	36989	she	84	" To whom do you mean to leave it , then ? "
37104	37110	37054	37054	James	74	" Not to his wife . "
37111	37145	36989	36989	she	84	" H'm ! Well , as we 're here , I suppose we may as well see what there is to be seen . And those two dreadful young people must be found . "
37151	37162	37054	37054	James	74	" Will you give me your arm , Mr. Ollerenshaw ? "
37375	37384	37385	37385	Helen	79	" We 've been looking for you everywhere , "
37389	37420	37385	37385	Helen	79	" Oh , Mrs. Prockter , do come with me to the end of the corridor , and look at three old distaffs that I 've found in a cupboard ! "
37468	37474	37476	37476	James	74	" I 've told him , "
37481	37503	37476	37476	James	74	" I 've told him it 's no use to you unless you want to turn it into a building estate . "
37532	37535	37537	37537	James	106	" Well ? "
37593	37596	37598	37598	Helen	79	" Well ? "
37632	37645	37646	37646	he	106	" What about that house as ye've so kindly chosen for me ? "
37665	37671	37673	37673	she	79	" You 've seen it , "
37675	37678	37679	37679	he	106	" What ! "
37682	37689	37679	37679	he	106	" When han I seen it ? "
37690	37694	37695	37695	she	79	" Just now , "
37698	37729	37695	37695	she	79	" It 's Wilbraham Hall . I knew that Mrs. Prockter would n't have it . And , besides , I 've made Emanuel give up all idea of it . "
37744	37751	37752	37752	he	106	" A poor joke , lass ! "
37763	37771	37773	37773	she	79	" It is n't a poor joke , "
37775	37784	37773	37773	she	79	" It is n't a joke at all . "
37785	37801	37773	37773	she	79	" Didst thou seriously think as I should buy that there barracks to please thee ? "
37802	37805	37806	37806	she	79	" Certainly , "
37811	37819	37806	37806	she	79	" Just that - to please me . "
37820	37829	37830	37830	he	106	" I 'm right enough where I am , "
37834	37840	37830	37830	he	106	" What for should I buy Wilbraham
37850	37850	37806	37806	she	79	"
37851	37856	37806	37806	she	79	" Live in it . "
37857	37867	37806	37806	she	79	" Trafalgar - road 's good enough for me . "
37868	37878	37880	37880	she	79	" But it is n't good enough for me , "
37882	37890	37891	37891	he	106	" I wouldna ' ha ' minded , "
37896	37913	37891	37891	he	106	" I wouldna ' ha ' minded going into a house a bit bigger , but - "
37914	37925	37926	37926	she	79	" Nothing is big enough for me except Wilbraham Hall , "
38008	38017	38018	38018	she	79	" Why should n't you , after all ? "
38021	38034	38018	38018	she	79	" You 've got an income of nearly five thousand a year . "
38061	38097	38045	38045	she	79	" You do n't spend the twentieth part of it . What are you going to do with it ? What are you going to do with it ? You 're getting an old man . "
38101	38179	38045	38045	she	79	" You ca n't take it with you when you leave the Five Towns , you know . Whom shall you leave your money to ? You 'll probably die worth a hundred thousand pounds , at this rate . You 'll leave it to me , of course . Because there 's nobody else for you to leave it to . Why ca n't you use it now , instead of wasting it in old stockings ? "
38180	38188	38189	38189	he	1077	" I bank my money , wench , "
38194	38198	38199	38199	she	1078	" Old stockings ! "
38204	38230	38199	38199	she	1078	" We could live splendidly at Wilbraham Hall on two thousand a year , and you would still be saving nearly three thousand a year . "
38235	38313	38314	38314	she	1078	" Do you suppose I gave up my position at school in order to live in a poky little hole at eighteen pounds a year ? What do you think I can do with myself all day in Trafalgar - road ? Why , nothing There 's no room even for a piano , and so my fingers are stiffening every day . It 's not life at all . Naturally , it 's a great privilege , "
38328	38374	38326	38326	Susan	78	" for a girl like me to live with an old man like you , all alone , with one servant and no sitting - room . But some privileges cost too dear . The fact is , you never think of me at all . "
38389	38426	38376	38376	he	1077	" You think you 've got a cheap housekeeper in me - but you have n't . I 'm a very good housekeeper - especially in a very large house - but I 'm not cheap . "
38513	38523	38510	38510	he	106	" I shall buy no Wilbraham Hall , lass . "
38529	38539	38541	38541	she	1078	" You could sell it again at a profit , "
38543	38552	38541	38541	she	1078	" You could turn it into a building estate "
38563	38575	38561	38561	Emanuel	95	" and later on we could go and live somewhere else . "
38576	38579	38581	38581	he	106	" Yes , "
38583	38589	38581	38581	he	106	" Buckingham Palace , likely ! "
38590	38595	38596	38596	she	1078	" I do n't - "
38599	38607	38608	38608	he	106	" I shall buy no Wilbraham Hall , "
38667	38755	38660	38660	Helen	79	" You 're a miser , that 's what you , are ! A regular old miser ! Every one knows that . Every one calls you a miser . If you are n't a miser , I should like you to tell me why you live on about three pounds a week when your income is ninety pounds a week . I thought I might do you some good . I thought I might get you out of it . But it seems I ca n't . "
38756	38759	38760	38760	he	1090	" Ah ! "
38844	38849	38850	38850	she	1093	" Good - bye , "
38872	38875	38876	38876	he	1090	" What ? "
38879	38883	38884	38884	she	1093	" Au revoir , "
38887	38951	38884	38884	she	1093	" All my things are packed up . I shall send for them . I think I can go back to the school . If I ca n't , I shall go to mother in Canada . Thank you very much for all your kindness . If I go to Canada , of course I shall come and see you before I leave . "
38974	38977	38978	38978	Miser	138	" miser . "
39105	39112	39113	39113	she	79	" Good - bye , uncle , "

39137	39140	39132	39132	be	1101	" Lass - "
39280	39296	39275	39275	he	1090	" The wench is n't so set on leaving me as I thought she was . "
39304	39317	39275	39275	he	1090	" Helen , lass , if you 'll stop you shall have your Wilbraham
39320	39331	39275	39275	he	1090	" in tones of affecting , sad surrender , he said :
39332	39348	39359	39359	he	1090	" I 'm sorry to lose thee , my girl ; but must be must . "
39421	39427	39428	39429	James Ollerenshaw	74	" I do n't say , "
39453	39549	39440	39440	he	1090	" I do n't say as you would n't make a rare good mistress o ' Wilbraham Hall . I do n't say as I would n't like to see you in it . But when a man reaches my age , he 's fixed in his habits like . And , what 's more , supposing I am saving a bit o ' money , who am I saving it for , if it is n't for you and your mother ? You said as much yourself . I might pop off any minute - "
39550	39553	39554	39554	Helen	79	" Uncle ! "
39557	39563	39564	39564	he	1105	" Ay , any minute ! "
39569	39593	39564	39564	he	1105	" I 've known stronger men nor me pop off as quick as a bottle o ' ginger - beer near the fire . "
39605	39631	39601	39601	.his	1105	" If I popped off here and now , would n't you feel ashamed o ' yerself for being so hard on your old uncle ? "

39653	39660	39661	39661	he	1105	" I 've set my heart , "
39664	39717	39661	39661	he	1105	" on leaving a certain sum for you and yer mother . I 've had it in mind since I do n't know when . It 's a fancy o ' mine . And I canna ' do it if I 'm to go all around th ' Five Towns buying barracks . "
39721	39730	39731	39731	she	79	" What a man you are for exaggerating ! "
39754	39757	39758	39758	he	1105	" Ay , "
39766	39775	39758	39758	he	1105	" it 's a fancy o ' mine . "

Surely you do n't think I 'm going to live in a poky house in Park - road - the very street where my school was , too ! I perfectly understand that you wo n't buy Wilbraham Hall . That 's all right . I sha n't pout . I hate women who pout . We ca n't agree , but we 're friends . You do what you like with your money , and I do what I like with myself . I had a sort of idea I would try to make you beautifully comfortable just for the last time before I left England , and that 's why I 'm staying . I do hope you did n't imagine anything else , uncle . There ! "
41086	41122	41082	41082	She	1118	" It 's a funny thing if I ca n't bring him to his knees with a tasty supper - just to make it clear to him what he 'll lose if he loses me . "
41817	41824	41825	41825	she	79	" Breakfast is ready , uncle , "
42082	42085	42086	42086	she	79	" Uncle ! "

42148	42155	42157	42157	he	1119	" I shouldna ' be surprised , "
42159	42168	42109	42109	she	79	" I wish you 'd lend it me . "
42169	42173	42109	42109	she	79	" What for ? "
42174	42196	42109	42109	she	79	" I want to go over to Hanbridge and book my berth , definitely , and I 've no loose cash . "
42208	42214	42215	42215	he	1119	" Dost mean to say , "
42218	42234	42215	42215	he	1119	" as ye havena ' booked your berth ? When does th ' steamer sail ? "
42235	42244	42246	42246	she	1150	" There 's one from Glasgow next Saturday , "
42248	42265	42246	42246	she	1150	" the Saskatchewan . I secured the berth , but I did n't pay for it . "
42266	42275	42276	42276	he	1119	" It 's a rare lot of money , "
42279	42282	42283	42283	she	1150	" Oh , "
42286	42321	42283	42283	she	1150	" I did n't want all that for the fare . I 've other things to pay for - railway to Glasgow , etc . You will lend it me , wo n't you ? "
42382	42395	42396	42396	she	1150	" Will you ask me to come back and cook the dinner ? "
42403	42406	42407	42407	he	1119	" Ay ! "
42425	42430	42431	42431	she	1150	" There you are ! "
42444	42452	42431	42431	she	1150	" Ever seen one of these before ? "
42518	42530	42531	42531	she	1150	" The boat leaves the Clyde at ten in the morning , "
42558	42558	42531	42531	she	1150	"
42559	42562	42563	42563	he	1119	" We ? "

42575	42591	42572	42572	she	1150	" you surely wo n't let me travel to Glasgow all alone , will you ? "
42592	42601	42602	42602	he	1119	" Her 's a caution , her is ! "
42606	42614	42615	42615	she	1150	" You can come back on Saturday , "
42654	42654	42615	42615	she	1150	"
42661	42668	42669	42669	he	1119	" And what about my dinner ? "
42672	42682	42685	42685	she	1150	" I 'm going to set about it instantly , "
42687	42695	42696	42696	he	1119	" I mean my dinner on Friday ? "
42699	42704	42705	42705	she	1150	" Oh , that ! "
42708	42726	42705	42705	she	1150	" There 's a restaurant - car from Crewe . So we can lunch on the train . "
42738	42748	42749	42749	he	1119	" Glasgow isna ' much i ' my line , "
42752	42763	42749	42749	he	1119	" But you wenches do as ye like , seemingly . "
42925	42934	42936	42936	Helen	79	" I 've seen to the baggage myself , "
42943	42947	42948	42948	he	1119	" All right , "

42984	42989	42991	42992	the porter	1166	" Yes , sir , "
43020	43030	42991	42992	the porter	1166	" So none of 'em has come to see you off!"he
43033	43038	42991	42992	the porter	1166	" None of whom ? "
43039	43046	42991	42992	the porter	1166	" None o ' yer friends . "
43047	43051	43052	43052	she	79	" No fear ! "
43055	43073	43052	43052	she	79	" I would n't have it for anything . I do hate and loathe good - byes at a
43081	43081	42991	42992	the porter	1166	"
43082	43087	43088	43088	he	1119	" Never had any , "
43275	43285	43286	43286	Helen	79	" I suppose the luggage will be all right ? "
43297	43300	43302	43302	he	1119	" Ay ! "
43315	43337	43302	43302	he	1119	" I saw 'em bringing all th ' N.S. luggage over . It were th ' fust thing I thought of . "
43430	43434	43435	43435	he	1119	" Bless us ! "
43447	43470	43435	43435	he	1119	" It 's fust time as I 've begun a bottle o ' Bass in one town and finished it in another . "
43495	43506	43508	43508	Helen	79	" You said you 'd seen it into the van , "
43515	43520	43521	43521	he	1119	" Nay , lass , "
43525	43539	43521	43521	he	1119	" I said I 'd seen 'em bringing all th ' luggage over . "
43776	43782	43784	43784	Helen	79	" Something must be done , "
43788	43791	43792	43792	Jimmy	74	" Ay ! "
43795	43819	43792	43792	Jimmy	74	" It 's long past my tea - time . We must find out if there 's anything to eat i ' Scotland . "
43976	43987	43989	43989	Jimmy	74	" Better go over to Edinburgh and see for yourself , "
43993	44002	44003	44003	Helen	79	" Yes , and what about my steamer ? "
44008	44019	44021	44021	Jimmy	74	" Scotland canna ' be so big as all that , "
44023	44051	44021	44021	Jimmy	74	" Not according to th ' maps . Us could run over to Edinburgh to - night , and get back to Glasgow early to - morrow . "
44084	44106	44079	44079	he	1209	" Unless ye prefer to sail without your trunks , and I could send 'em on by th ' next steamer ? "
44107	44110	44111	44111	she	79	" Uncle , "
44114	44146	44111	44111	she	79	" I do wish you would n't be so silly . The idea of me sailing without my trunks ! Why do n't you ask me to sail without my head ? "
44147	44154	44155	44155	he	1209	" All right - all right ! "
44158	44186	44155	44155	he	1209	" But do n't snap mine off . Two second returns to Edinburgh , young man , and I 'll thank ye to look slippy over it . "
44248	44264	44265	44265	he	1209	" That makes ' twenty - seven pounds eighteen and ninepence as ye owe me , "
44268	44275	44231	44231	He	1209	" What ? For railway tickets ? "
44276	44312	44386	44386	She	79	" Railway tickets , tips , and that twenty - five pounds I lent ye . I 'm making ye a present o ' my fares , and dinner , and tea and so forth . "
44313	44323	44324	44324	she	79	" Twenty - five pounds that you lent me ! "
44327	44330	44331	44331	he	1209	" Yes , "
44333	44344	44386	44386	She	79	" Tuesday morning , while I was at my cashbox . "
44345	44350	44351	44351	she	79	" Oh , that ! "
44354	44384	44351	44351	she	79	" I thought you were giving me that . I never thought you 'd ask me for it again , uncle . I 'd completely forgotten all about it . "
44447	44456	44457	44457	he	1209	" What 's twenty - five pun ' ? "
44460	44528	44457	44457	he	1209	" There 'll be no luggage for her at Edinburgh ; that steamer'll go without her ; and then I shall give in . I shall talk to her about the ways o ' Providence , and tell her it 's borne in upon me as she must have Wilbraham Hall if she 's in a mind to stay . I shall save my face , anyhow . "
44678	44683	44684	44684	he	74	" Well , lass , "
44687	44699	44684	44684	he	74	" I 'm right sorry . What 's to be done ? "
44700	44710	44711	44711	she	1225	" There 's nothing at all to be done , "
44752	44774	44748	44748	she	1225	" Except , of course , that I must cable to mother . She 's coming to Quebec to meet me . "
44775	44783	44784	44784	he	74	" That 'll do to - morrow , "
44787	44810	44784	44784	he	74	" What 's to be done to - night ? In th ' way o ' supper , as ye might say ? "
44811	44828	44829	44829	She	1225	" We must go to an hotel . I believe the station hotel is the best . "
44842	44847	44829	44829	She	1225	" To the hotel . "
44865	44871	44872	44872	he	74	" Look here , wench , "
44875	44899	44872	44872	he	74	" I do n't know as this is much in my line . Summat a thought less gaudy'll do for my old bones . "
44900	44911	44912	44912	Helen	79	" I wo n't move a step farther this night ! "
44915	44922	44912	44912	Helen	79	" I 'm ready to drop . "
44931	44934	44935	44935	he	74	" Well , "
44938	44942	44935	44935	he	74	" here goes ! "
44967	44970	44944	44944	he	74	" Bureau . "
44971	44981	44982	44982	he	74	" Have ye gotten a couple of bedrooms like ? "
44987	44992	44994	45000	the clerk who was a perfect lady	1231	" Yes , sir , "
45002	45008	44994	45000	the clerk who was a perfect lady	1231	" What do you want ? "
45009	45026	45029	45029	she	79	" Do n't I tell ye as we want a couple o ' bedrooms , miss ? "
45075	45078	45079	45079	he	74	" Why , "
45082	45109	45079	45079	he	74	" I 've got a four - roomed cottage empty at Turnhill as I 'd let for a month for thirteen shillings , and paper it ! "
45110	45118	45120	45125	a muscular demon with shiny sleeves	1234	" Where is your luggage , sir ? "
45127	45140	45142	45142	Jimmy	74	" That 's just what we want to know , young feller , "
45144	45160	45162	45162	he	74	" For the present , that 's all as we can lay our hands on . "
45330	45336	45337	45337	he	74	" Well , my girl , "
45340	45366	45337	45337	he	74	" cheer up . If ye tak ' my advice ye'll make up yer mind to stop i ' owd England with yer owd uncle . "
45367	45373	45374	45374	she	79	" Of course I will , "
45382	45391	45374	45374	she	79	" If you 'll do as I want . "
45392	45397	45410	45410	he	74	" Buy that barracks ? "
45430	45472	45410	45410	he	74	" Lass , ye shall have it . I would n't ha ' given it ye , but it 's like as if what must be - this luggage being lost . It 's like as if Providence was in it . "
45495	45499	45500	45500	he	74	" Listen here , "
45510	45516	45500	45500	he	74	" I 'll toss thee . "
45517	45521	45522	45522	she	79	" Toss me ? "
45527	45559	45500	45500	he	74	" Ay ! I 'll toss thee , if thou'lt stay . Heads I buy the barracks ; tails I do n't , and you live with me in a house . "
45560	45564	45565	45565	she	79	" Very well , "
45607	45614	45615	45615	he	74	" Heads I win , eh ? "
45684	45692	45673	45673	Jimmy	74	" he cried , and bent over it .
45693	45698	45699	45699	he	74	" Nay , nay ! "
45702	45717	45699	45699	he	74	" I 've lost . Th ' old man 's lost , after all ! "
45738	45750	45752	45752	she	79	" I 'm surprised you were ready to toss , uncle , "
45754	45776	45752	45752	she	79	" However , it 's all right ; we can get the luggage to - morrow . It 's at Crewe . "
45777	45786	45787	45787	he	74	" How dost know it 's at Crewe ? "
45790	45864	45865	45865	She	79	" Because I had it labelled for Crewe . You were silly to imagine that I was going to leave you . But I thought I 'd just leave nothing undone to make you give way . I made sure I was beaten . I made sure I should have to knuckle under . And now you are goose enough to toss , and you 've lost , you 've lost ! Hurrah ! "
45871	45879	45880	45880	Jimmy	74	" Do ye mean to tell me , "
45883	45897	45880	45880	Jimmy	74	" as ye've been playing a game wi ' me all this time ? "
45898	45902	45903	45903	She	79	" Of course . "
45908	45921	45880	45880	Jimmy	74	" And bought th ' steamer - ticket without meaning to go ? "
45922	45925	45926	45926	she	79	" Well , "
45929	45952	45926	45926	she	79	" it 's no good half - playing when you 're playing for high stakes . Besides , what 's fifteen pounds ? "
47225	47228	47229	47229	she	79	" Georgiana , "
47232	47245	47229	47229	she	79	" go and make some tea . Bring a cup for yourself . "
47246	47256	47229	47229	she	79	" Yes , miss . Thank you , miss . "
47344	47356	47358	47358	he	95	" Mother thought I might perhaps be able to help you , "
47498	47501	47502	47502	he	95	" Yes , "
47515	47523	47502	47502	he	95	" Mother thought I might help you . "
47524	47532	47534	47534	James	106	" What a fool that woman is ! "
47536	47557	47534	47534	James	106	" And what a fool he is to put it on to his mother instead of keeping it to himself ! "
47558	47568	47569	47569	Helen	79	" And what did you think , Mr. Prockter ? "
47572	47580	47569	47569	Helen	79	" Another cup and saucer , Georgiana . "
47591	47601	47603	47603	James	106	" Perhaps his mother ai n't such a fool ! "
47671	47691	47664	47664	Helen	79	" It 's awfully good of you - awfully good of you . Here we are , you see ! "
47774	47778	47780	47780	Helen	79	" Never mind , "
47782	47789	47780	47780	Helen	79	" Mr. Prockter shall have mine . "
47790	47797	47799	47799	James	106	" Well , I 'm hanged ! "
48106	48119	48101	48101	Helen	79	" had ever deigned to recognise the merits of the ship and ocean .
48120	48129	48130	48130	James	106	" Where shouldst hang it , Master Prockter ? "
48134	48140	48142	48142	Helen	79	" Hang it , uncle ? "
48144	48167	48142	48142	Helen	79	" Are you going to hang it ? Are n't you going to keep it on the table in your own room ? "
48196	48203	48205	48205	Emanuel	95	" It ought to be hung , "
48207	48220	48205	48205	Emanuel	95	" See , here are the little iron things for the nails . "
48244	48252	48254	48254	he	95	" Of course it must be hung , "
48350	48371	48372	48372	Emanuel	95	" There ! under the musicians ' gallery would n't be a bad place , would it , Mr. Ollerenshaw ? "
48385	48392	48394	48394	he	74	" The very thing , lad ! "
48399	48402	48403	48403	Helen	79	" Lad ! "
48526	48532	48535	48535	he	113	" I was just passing , "
48542	48570	48535	48535	he	113	" I expected you 'd be in a bit of a mess , so I thought I might be useful . How d'ye do , Mr. Ollerenshaw ? "
48579	48587	48588	48588	Helen	79	" It 's very kind of you , "
48593	48599	48600	48600	Andrew	113	" How do , Prockter ? "
48792	48797	48798	48798	he	113	" The very thing ! "
48861	48869	48870	48870	James	74	" Where 's the steps , Helen ? "
48880	48883	48884	48884	he	74	" Georgiana ! "
48892	48901	48903	48903	he	74	" Bring us a pair o ' steps , "
48978	48985	48986	48986	Andrew	113	" Now , what is it ? "
49035	49040	49041	49041	he	113	" Hammer ! Nails ! "
49326	49334	49336	49336	James	74	" I 'd happen better hold 'em , "
49338	49345	49347	49347	Andrew	113	" It 'll be all right , "
49349	49355	49357	49357	Emanuel	95	" I 'll hold them , "
49405	49409	49410	49410	Andrew	113	" Clumsy fool ! "
50197	50204	50205	50205	he	106	" What 's amiss , lad ? "
50215	50222	50224	50224	Emanuel	95	" I fell into the Water , "
50247	50253	50182	50182	It	1429	" How didst manage that ? "
50254	50265	50267	50267	Emanuel	95	" The path is very muddy and slippery just there , "
50269	50282	50283	50283	James	106	" Had n't you better run home as quick as may be ? "
50286	50291	50293	50293	Emanuel	95	" I ca n't , "
50295	50299	50182	50182	It	1429	" Why not ? "
50300	50332	50337	50337	he	106	" I 've got no hat , and I 'm all wet . And everybody in Oldcastle - road will see me . Can you lend me a hat and coat ? "
50393	50402	50403	50403	he	106	" And what about a cap or something ? "
50407	50412	50414	50415	Uncle James	106	" Tak ' this , "
50469	50478	50480	50480	Helen	79	" He did n't fall into the Water , "
50484	50491	50480	50480	Helen	79	" Andrew Dean pushed him in . "
50492	50498	50655	50655	She	1432	" How dost know that ? "
50499	50549	50480	50480	Helen	79	" Georgiana and I saw it from my bedroom window . It was she who first saw them fighting , or at any rate arguing . Then Andrew Dean charged him in , as if they were playing football , and walked on ; and Emanuel Prockter scrambled out . "
50550	50553	50555	50555	James	106	" H'm ! "
50557	50597	50555	50555	James	106	" Well , if ye ask me , lass , Emanuel brought that on himsen . I never seed a man look a bigger foo ' than Emanuel looked when he went off in my mackintosh and Turkish cap . "
50598	50603	50480	50480	Helen	79	" Your Turkish cap ? "
50604	50609	50555	50555	James	106	" One of 'em . "
50610	50615	50480	50480	Helen	79	" With the tassel ? "
50616	50619	50555	50555	James	106	" Ay ! "
50620	50654	50480	50480	Helen	79	" It 's a great shame ! That 's what it is ! I 'm sure he did n't look a fool ! He 's been very badly treated , and I 'll - "
50667	50677	50679	50679	James	106	" You should ha ' seen him , lass ! "
50684	50690	50679	50679	James	106	" I wish ye had ! "
50732	50741	50743	50743	she	1432	" I know why you say that , uncle "
50758	50766	50743	50743	she	1432	" Now , just listen to me ! "
50781	50790	50791	50791	Helen	79	" What 's the matter with Emanuel Prockter ? "
50890	50893	50882	50882	She	79	" done with "
51019	51028	51030	51030	he	74	" What 's the matter with Emanuel Prockter , "
51032	51044	51030	51030	he	74	" is as he 's probably gotten a cold by this . "
51045	51053	51054	51054	Helen	79	" Yes , and you 're glad ! "
51057	51077	51054	51054	Helen	79	" You think he looked a fool after he 'd been in the water . And you were glad . "
51078	51083	51085	51085	James	74	" I dunna think , "
51087	51092	51085	51085	James	74	" I 'm sure . "
51093	51109	51054	51054	Helen	79	" But why should you be glad ? That 's what I want to know . "
51135	51140	51141	51141	she	79	" The fact is , "
51161	51190	51141	51141	she	79	" every one has got their knives into Emanuel Prockter . And it 's simply because he 's good - looking and well - dressed and sings beautifully . "
51191	51196	51198	51198	James	74	" Good - looking ! "
51200	51207	51141	51141	she	79	" Well , is n't he ? "
51208	51213	51215	51215	James	74	" He 's pretty , "
51217	51228	51141	51141	she	79	" No one ever said he had a lot of brains "
51229	51234	51235	51235	James	74	" I never did , "
51239	51323	51141	51141	she	79	" But what does that matter ? He is polite . He does know how to behave himself in polite society . If Andrew Dean pushed him into the water , that was n't his fault . Andrew is stronger than he is , but that 's no credit to Andrew Dean . It 's to his discredit . Andrew Dean is nothing but a bully - we all know that . He might have pushed you into the water , or me . "
51324	51328	51329	51329	James	74	" He might , "
51332	51347	51329	51329	James	74	" if I 'd been silly enough to get between the water and him . "
51348	51391	51141	51141	she	79	" And I should like to know who looked a fool when Andrew Dean fell off those steps . And just listen to the language the man used . I will say this for Emanuel Prockter - I never heard him swear . "
51392	51395	51397	51397	James	74	" No , "
51399	51418	51397	51397	James	74	" He wears gloves . He even wears 'em when he takes his bath of a November afternoon . "
51419	51428	51429	51429	Helen	79	" I do n't care who knows it , "
51434	51440	51429	51429	Helen	79	" I like Emanuel Prockter . "
51441	51451	51453	51453	James	74	" There 's nobody as dunna ' know it , "
51455	51471	51453	51453	James	74	" It 's the talk of Bursley as you 've set your cap at him . "
51472	51479	51481	51481	Helen	79	" I do n't wear caps , "
51483	51490	51481	51481	Helen	79	" I 'm not a servant . "
51491	51496	51499	51499	himself	74	" Hat , then , "
51501	51520	51497	51497	James	74	" Ye'll not deny as you wear hats , I reckon . I 've seen ye in forty . "
51521	51529	51530	51530	Helen	79	" I know who started that tale , "
51533	51540	51530	51530	Helen	79	" Andrew Dean started that tale . "
51541	51544	51546	51546	James	74	" No , "
51548	51558	51546	51546	James	74	" It was Mrs. Prockter , I 'm thinking . "
51559	51573	51530	51530	Helen	79	" Has Mrs. Prockter spoken to you about me and - and Emanuel ? "
51601	51605	51607	51607	he	74	" Her has , "
51609	51624	51607	51607	he	74	" What a ridiculous , fat old woman she is , with her fancies ! "
51688	51711	51681	51681	Helen	79	" I wonder who she 's setting her cap at ? I suppose you 'll not deny that she wears a cap ? "
51850	51859	51860	51860	he	74	" I mun be getting to work again , "
51863	51872	51873	51873	she	79	" Please do wait a minute , uncle , "
51877	51901	51873	51873	she	79	" Ca n't you see I want to talk to you ? Ca n't you see I 've got something on my mind ? "
51955	51970	51948	51948	he	74	" I ca n't talk to you while you 're standing up , she said .
52041	52059	52060	52060	she	79	" So they are saying that there is something between Emanuel Prockter and me , are they ? "
52081	52093	52095	52095	James	74	" It wouldna ' surprise me to hear as they were , "
52097	52112	52060	52060	she	79	" And supposing there was something between us , uncle , should you mind ? "
52113	52123	52125	52125	he	74	" I do n't know as I should mind , "
52126	52145	52060	52060	she	79	" And I do n't know as it ' ud matter a brass button if I did mind . "
52146	52154	52060	52060	she	79	" What should you do , uncle ? "
52155	52165	52167	52167	he	74	" I should do as I 've always done , "
52169	52207	52167	52167	he	74	" eat and sleep and take my walks abroad . Them as wants to marry will marry , and they will marry what suits 'em . But I shall tak ' my meat and drink as usual . "
52208	52216	52060	52060	she	79	" Would you come to the wedding ? "
52217	52226	52228	52228	he	74	" I 've only got a funeral suit , "
52230	52254	52228	52228	he	74	" But I 'd buy me some togs if Emanuel ' ud tak ' this place off my hands at what I gave . "
52255	52265	52060	52060	she	79	" Would you give me a wedding - present ? "
52266	52283	52228	52228	he	74	" I 'd give thee some advice . It 's what thou'rt most in need of . "
52305	52313	52314	52314	she	1443	" You are a horrid old thing , "
52324	52344	52314	52314	she	1443	" I am in need of advice . And there 's no one can give it me but you . "
52345	52350	52351	52351	he	74	" Nay , nay ! "
52354	52367	52351	52351	he	74	" There 's Sarah Swetnam . You 're as thick as thieves . "
52368	52380	52382	52382	Helen	79	" She 's the very last person I can go to , "
52384	52388	52314	52314	she	1443	" And why ? "
52389	52409	52314	52314	she	1443	" Because Andrew is engaged to her sister , of course . That 's the awful part of it , "
52410	52413	52414	52414	he	74	" Ay ? "
52417	52436	52437	52437	She	79	" Yes . Because , you see , it 's Andrew Dean that I 'm in love with . "
52487	52495	52496	52496	he	74	" I ' thy place , lass , "
52499	52507	52496	52496	he	74	" I should keep that to mysen . "
52508	52546	52576	52576	Helen	79	" But I ca n't , uncle . That is , I have n't done . Andrew knows . You do n't understand how much I 'm in love with him . I 've - he 's - "
52547	52553	52496	52496	he	74	" Thou'st not kissed him ? "
52554	52560	52576	52576	Helen	79	" Not exactly - but - "
52561	52575	52496	52496	he	74	" He 's been kissing you in mistake for his other young woman ? "
52579	52589	52576	52576	Helen	79	" Helen , what ' ud thy mother say ? "
52590	52605	52607	52607	she	79	" It was because of Andrew Dean that I came to live in Bursley , "
52609	52941	52607	52607	she	79	" I knew I should n't see him often enough if I stayed in Longshaw . So I came here . You know we had always liked each other , I think , ever since he spent two years at Longshaw at Spitz Brothers ' . Then I did n't see him for some time . You know how rude and awkward he is . Well , there was a coolness . And then we did n't see each other for another long time . And then when I next saw him I knew I really was in love with him . Of course , I never said anything to mother . One does n't , you know . And she was so taken up with her own affairs , poor dear ! And I thought he was really fond of me . I thought so because he was so cross and queer . He 's like that , you know . And , after all , it was not that that made him cross and queer . It was just because he was as good as engaged to Lilian , and he did n't like to tell me . And I never knew . How could I guess ? I 'd never heard there was anything between him and Lilian . And besides , although he was cross and queer , he said things to me that he ought n't to have said , considering how he was carrying on with Lilian . It was then that I settled on coming to Bursley . There was no reason why I should stay in Longshaw . I saw him again in Longshaw , after he was engaged to Lilian , and yet he never told me ! And then , when I come here , the first thing I hear is that he 's engaged to Lilian . It was that afternoon when Sarah called ; do you remember , uncle ? "
52945	53171	53172	53172	She	1445	" I saw Mr. Dean that night , and somehow I told him what I thought of him . I do n't know how it began ; but it did . He said he could n't help being engaged to Lilian . He said it was one of those engagements that go on by themselves , and you ca n't stop them . He wanted to stop it . But he was engaged before he knew where he was - so he says . He said he preferred me , and if he 'd known - So of course I was obliged to be very angry with him . That was why I did n't . speak to him at first at Mrs. Prockter 's ; at least , that was partly why . The other reason was that he had accused me of running after Emanuel - of all people ! I had been , you know . But what had that got to do with Andrew , seeing that he was engaged to Lilian ? Besides , I 'd been doing it on purpose . And he was so insolent . And then , to crown all , Mrs. Prockter makes me dance with him . No wonder I fainted ! He is the rudest , rudest , cruelest man I ever knew . "
53177	53180	53182	53182	James	74	" H'm ! "
53184	53193	53194	53194	she	1445	" He 'll simply kill poor little Lilian ! "
53197	53231	53172	53172	She	1445	" What 's that got to do with you , if you and Emanuel has got nothing to do with him ? It is n't you as'll be hung when Lilian 's murdered . "
53232	53243	53244	53244	Helen	79	" Ca n't you see he must n't marry Lilian ? "
53248	53265	53244	53244	Helen	79	" Silly little thing ! How can she understand him ? She 's miles beneath him . "
53266	53275	53276	53276	James	74	" Is there anybody as does understand him ? "
53279	53283	53285	53285	she	1445	" I do , "
53287	53356	53285	53285	she	1445	" And that 's flat . And I 've got to marry him , and you must help me . I wanted to tell you , and now I 've told you . Do n't you think I 've done right in being quite open with you ? Most girls are so foolish in these things . But I 'm not . Are n't you glad , uncle ? "
53357	53364	53366	53366	he	74	" Glad inna ' the word , "
53368	53374	53375	53375	she	1445	" You must help me , "
53779	53794	53735	53735	he	113	" There 's no doing nowt wi ' a young woman afore she 's forty "
53902	53914	53893	53893	His	113	" the clock struck twelve , and shook the silent tower . "
54021	54026	54027	54027	he	113	" Who 's there ? "
54030	54038	54003	54003	he	113	" It 's I , Mr. Ollerenshaw , "
54047	54052	54053	54053	he	113	" Not Mrs. Prockter ? "
54056	54059	54072	54072	She	1465	" Yes . "
54060	54068	54069	54069	he	113	" I reckon ye'd like to come in "
54169	54185	54191	54191	she	1465	" You 'll think I 'm in the habit of calling on you at night , "
54208	54214	54204	54204	she	1465	" Where is dear Helen ? "
54215	54224	54226	54226	James	74	" She 's gone to bed , missis , "
54258	54266	54267	54268	Mrs. Prockter	84	" But it 's only ten o'clock ! "
54271	54281	54267	54268	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Yes . But her 's gone to bed . "
54282	54285	54286	54287	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Why , "
54295	54302	54286	54287	Mrs. Prockter	84	" you are all straight here ! "
54365	54373	54375	54376	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I 'm not ill - pleased , "
54377	54408	54375	54376	Mrs. Prockter	84	" that Helen is out of the way . The fact is - it was you that I wanted to have a word with . You 'll guess what about ? "
54409	54413	54414	54414	James	74	" Mr. Emanuel ? "
54417	54472	54375	54376	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Precisely . I had to put him to bed . He is certainly in for a very serious cold , and I trust - I fervently trust - it may not be bronchitis . That would mean nurses , and nothing upsets a house more than nurses . What happened , Mr. Ollerenshaw ? "
54505	54515	54516	54516	he	74	" I 'll tell you what happened , missis , "
54550	54556	54527	54527	he	74	" You must help me . "
54557	54565	54566	54566	he	74	" That 's what happened , missis , "
54592	54598	54599	54599	she	1471	" My dear Mr. Ollerenshaw , "
54608	54623	54599	54599	she	1471	" how I sympathise with you ! How I wish I could help you ! "
54702	54705	54693	54693	She	1471	" Jimmy , "
54844	54850	54851	54851	she	1471	" I can help you , "
54861	54994	54851	54851	she	1471	" I 'm calling on the Swetnams the day after to - morrow . I 'll tell them about - about to - day , and when Mrs. Swetnam asks me for an explanation of it , I will be mysterious . If Lilian is there , Mrs. Swetnam will certainly get her out of the room . Then I will just give the faintest hint that the explanation is merely jealousy between Emanuel and Mr. Dean concerning - a certain young lady . I shall treat it all as a joke ; you can rely on me . Immediately I am gone Lilian will hear about it . She will quarrel with Andrew the next time she sees him ; and if he wishes to be free , he may be ! "
55073	55077	55079	55079	she	1481	" Of course , "
55081	55141	55079	55079	she	1481	" I have always said that a marriage between Andrew Dean and Lilian would be a mistake - a very serious mistake . They are quite unsuited to each other . She is n't in love with him - she 's only been flattered by his attentions into drawing him on . I feel sorry for the little thing . "
55215	55218	55220	55221	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Oh ! "
55289	55296	55297	55297	he	74	" An ye got a match ? "
55301	55304	55305	55305	she	1481	" No , "
55310	55333	55305	55305	she	1481	" I do n't carry matches . But I can tell you I do n't like being in the dark at all . "
55353	55361	55334	55334	Her	1481	" Where are you , Mr. Ollerenshaw ? "
55362	55370	55371	55371	he	74	" I 'm a - sitting here , "
55374	55377	55379	55379	she	1481	" Well , "
55381	55416	55379	55379	she	1481	" if you ca n't find a match , I think you had better lead me to the door . I certainly ca n't find my way there myself . Where is your hand ? "
55427	55432	55379	55379	she	1481	" Is that you ? "
55437	55440	55441	55441	he	74	" Ay ! "
55503	55510	55512	55513	the voice	1487	" What 's that light there ? "
55519	55522	55523	55523	he	74	" Where ? "
55527	55532	55582	55584	the whispering voice	1489	" There - behind . "
55573	55581	55582	55584	the whispering voice	1489	" You 'd better go and see , "
55646	55651	55652	55652	she	79	" Who 's there ? "
55657	55661	55662	55662	he	74	" Mrs. Prockter , "
55665	55675	55676	55676	she	79	" And are you sitting together in the dark ? "
55699	55701	55676	55676	she	79	" cap "
56232	56242	56243	56243	she	79	" What are you and Mrs. Prockter talking about ? "
56267	56270	56271	56271	he	74	" Well , "
56274	56288	56271	56271	he	74	" if you must know , about you and that there Andrew Dean . "
56315	56324	56325	56325	she	79	" Do you mean to say , uncle , "
56353	56365	56325	56325	she	79	" that you 've been discussing my affairs with Mrs. Prockter ? "
56409	56412	56413	56413	he	74	" Ay ! "
56416	56425	56426	56426	she	79	" I never heard of such a thing ! "
56433	56448	56450	56450	he	74	" You said as I must help ye , and I 'm helping ye , "
56452	56472	56473	56473	she	79	" But I did n't mean that you were to go chattering about me all over Bursley , uncle , "
56489	56503	56504	56504	he	74	" I do n't know as I 've been chattering all over Bursley , "
56508	56611	56504	56504	he	74	" I do n't know as I 'm much of a chatterer . I might name them as could give me a start and a beating when it comes to talking the nose off a brass monkey . Mrs. Prockter came in to inquire about what had happened here this afternoon , as well she might , seeing as Emanuel went home with a couple o ' gallons o ' my water in his pockets . So I told her all about it . Her 's a very friendly woman . And her 's promised to do what her can for ye . "
56612	56615	56680	56681	Mrs. Prockter	84	" How ? "
56616	56642	56504	56504	he	74	" Why , to get Andrew Dean for ye , seeing as ye're so fixed on him , wi ' as little gossip as maybe . "
56643	56668	56680	56681	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Oh ! So Mrs. Prockter has kindly consented to get Andrew Dean for me ! And how does she mean to do it ? "
56687	56692	56694	56694	Helen	79	" Now , uncle , "
56696	56782	56694	56694	Helen	79	" just listen to me . If Mrs. Prockter says a single word about me to any one , I will never speak either to her or you again . Mind ! A single word ! A nice thing that she should go up to Swetnam 's , and hint that Andrew and Emanuel have been fighting because of me ! What about my reputation ? And do you suppose that I want the leavings of Lilian Swetnam ? Me ! The idea is preposterous ! "
56783	56792	56794	56794	he	1515	" You wanted 'em badly enough this afternoon , "
56796	56803	56804	56804	she	1516	" No , I did n't , "
56809	56871	56804	56804	she	1516	" You are quite mistaken . You misunderstood me , though I 'm surprised that you should have done . Perhaps I was a little excited this afternoon . Certainly you were thinking about other things . I expect you were expecting Mrs. Prockter this evening . It would have been nicer of you to have told me she was coming . "
56872	56875	56694	56694	Helen	79	" I - "
56876	56886	56887	56887	she	1516	" Now , please let it be clearly understood , "
56891	56985	56887	56887	she	1516	" You must go down and tell Mrs. Prockter at once that you were entirely in error , and that she is on no account to breathe a word about me to any one . Whatever you were both thinking of I can not imagine ! But I can assure you I 'm extremely annoyed . Mrs. Prockter putting her finger in the pie ! Let her take care that I do n't put my finger into her pie ! I always knew she was a gossiping old thing , but , really - "
56986	56990	56694	56694	Helen	79	" Mr. Ollerenshaw ! "
57002	57012	57013	57013	Helen	79	" There ! she 's getting impatient for you ! "
57016	57063	57013	57013	Helen	79	" Run off to her at once . To think that if I had n't happened to hear the bell ring , and come out to see what was the matter , I should have been the talk of Bursley before I was a day older ! "
57070	57077	57079	57079	James	74	" I must have a light ! "
57084	57087	57088	57088	Helen	79	" Why ? "
57093	57122	57088	57088	Helen	79	" If you could begin in the dark , why ca n't you finish in the dark ? You and she seem to like being in the dark . "
57123	57127	57165	57165	she	79	" Mr. Ollerenshaw ! "
57135	57140	57141	57141	James	74	" Her 's coming ! "
57154	57163	57165	57165	she	79	" Here ! Take this one , then ! "
57350	57355	57356	57356	she	84	" What is it ? "
57371	57376	57356	57356	she	84	" What 's what ? "
57377	57385	57391	57391	she	84	" Why have you been so long ? "
57422	57446	57391	57391	she	84	" Helen heard summat , and so she had come out of her bedroom . Her 's nervous i ' this big house . "
57447	57459	57463	57463	he	74	" Did you tell her I was here , Mr. Ollerenshaw ? "
57472	57475	57476	57476	he	74	" No , "
57483	57494	57391	57391	she	84	" She did n't hear me call out , then ? "
57495	57501	57503	57503	he	74	" Did ye call out ? "
57514	57522	57524	57525	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Perhaps it 's just as well , "
57532	57545	57524	57525	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Under the circumstances she can not possibly suspect our little plot . "
57712	57725	57726	57726	he	74	" I suppose ye think it 'll be all right , missis , "
57731	57747	57726	57726	he	74	" ye going up to Mrs. Swetnam 's o ' that ' n , and - "
57748	57753	57755	57755	she	79	" Rely on me , "
57781	57790	57792	57793	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Thank you very much , Mr. Ollerenshaw , "
57795	57810	57792	57793	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Good - night . I 'll make the best of my way home . "
57853	57862	57864	57864	he	74	" I 'll step along wi ' ye , "
57866	57871	57872	57872	she	79	" Oh , no ! "
57875	57882	57872	57872	she	79	" I really ca n't allow - "
57883	57887	57917	57918	a lady	1532	" Allow what ? "
57888	57899	57872	57872	she	79	" Allow you to inconvenience yourself like that for me . "
57900	57903	57905	57905	he	74	" Pooh ! "
57977	57993	57995	57995	he	74	" I 'll get a box o ' matches from somewhere while I 'm out , "
58009	58013	58014	58014	she	79	" Mr. Ollerenshaw , "
58019	58038	58014	58014	she	79	" you have n't got your boots on . Those slippers are not thick enough for this weather . "
58088	58096	58097	58097	she	79	" You wo n't need a muffler ? "
58110	58115	58116	58116	he	74	" Oh , no ! "
58177	58186	58187	58187	she	79	" Will you kindly give me your arm ? "
58216	58228	58213	58213	she	79	" Will you kindly let me look over your Prayer Book ? "
58355	58370	58372	58373	another couple	953	" Good - night , Mrs. Prockter . Good - night , Mr. Ollerenshaw . "
58378	58393	58372	58373	another couple	953	" Good - night , Mrs. Prockter . Good - night , Mr. Ollerenshaw . "
58417	58429	58431	58432	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I suppose you know you 've done it this time ? "
58455	58467	58468	58468	he	74	" As well be hung for a sheep as a lamb ! "
58502	58508	58497	58498	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Unhand me , monster ! "
58514	58523	58524	58524	he	74	" And this is me , James Ollerenshaw ! "
58555	58567	58568	58568	Helen	79	" I saw that frock in Brunt 's three days ago , "
58582	58590	58591	58591	Sarah	107	" I know you did , Nell , "
58594	58609	58591	58591	Sarah	107	" But you need n't tell me so . Do n't you like it ? "
58610	58618	58619	58619	Helen	79	" I think it 's a dream , "
58624	58628	58619	58619	Helen	79	" Turn round . "
58682	58686	58687	58687	Sarah	107	" All alone ? "
58704	58707	58709	58709	Helen	79	" Yes , "
58711	58734	58709	58709	Helen	79	" It 's Georgiana 's afternoon out , and uncle 's away , and I have n't got any new servants yet . "
58735	58780	58653	58653	they	1546	" Mr. Ollerenshaw away ! No one ever heard of such a thing ! If you knew him as well as we do , you 'd have fainted with surprise . It ought to be in the paper . Where 's he gone to ? "
58781	58937	58709	58709	Helen	79	" He 's gone to Derby , to try to buy some property that he says is going very cheap there . He 's been gone three days now . He got a letter at breakfast , and said he must go to Derby at once . However , he had to finish his rents . The trouble is that his rents never are finished , and I 'm bothered all the time by people coming with three and sixpence , or four shillings , and a dirty rent - book Oh ! and the dirt on the coins ! My dear , you ca n't imagine ! There 's one good thing . He will have to come back for next week 's rents . Not that I 'm sorry he 's gone . It gives me a chance , you see . By the time he returns I shall have my servants in . "
58938	58950	58653	58653	they	1546	" Do tell me what servants you 're going to have ? "
58951	58979	58709	58709	Helen	79	" Well , I went to that agency at Oldcastle . I 've got a German butler . He speaks four languages , and has beautiful eyes . "
58980	58985	58653	58653	they	1546	" A German butler ! "
59004	59032	58709	58709	Helen	79	" Yes , and a cook , and two other maids ; and a gardener and a boy . I shall keep Georgiana as my own maid . "
59033	59042	58709	58709	Helen	79	" My child , you 're going it ! "
59043	59054	58709	58709	Helen	79	" My child , I came here to go it . "
59055	59065	58709	58709	Helen	79	" And - and Mr. Ollerenshaw is really pleased ? "
59069	59131	59066	59066	Helen	79	" Uncle never goes into raptures , you know . But I hope he will be pleased . The fact is , he does n't know anything about these new servants yet . He 'll find them installed when he returns . It will be a little treat for him . My piano came this morning . Care to try it ? "
59132	59135	59137	59137	Sarah	107	" Rather ! "
59139	59149	59137	59137	Sarah	107	" Well , I never saw anything like it ! "
59165	59176	59066	59066	Helen	79	" How you 've improved it , you dear thing ! "
59177	59193	59137	59137	Sarah	107	" You see , I have my own cheque - book ; it saves worry . "
59194	59198	59200	59200	Sarah	107	" I see ! "
59225	59231	59232	59232	Helen	79	" Shall we have tea ? "
59243	59255	59232	59232	Helen	79	" Yes . Let me help you , do , dearest . "
59284	59302	59281	59281	Sarah	107	" Now if you want an idea , I 've got a really good one for you . "
59303	59313	59281	59281	Sarah	107	" For me ? What sort of an idea ? "
59314	59327	59281	59281	Sarah	107	" I 'll tell you . You know Mrs. Wiltshire is dead . "
59328	59344	59281	59281	Sarah	107	" I do n't . I did n't even know there was a Mrs. Wiltshire . "
59345	59513	59281	59281	Sarah	107	" Well , there was , and there is n't any longer . Mrs. Wiltshire was the main social prop of the old rector . And the annual concert of the St. Luke 's Guild has always been held at her house , down at Shawport , you know . Awfully poky ! But it was the custom since the Flood , and no one ever dared to hint at a change . Now the concert was to have been next week but one , and she 's just gone and died , and the rector is wondering where he can hold it . I met him this morning . Why do n't you let him hold it here ? That would be a splendid way of opening your house - Hall , I beg its pardon . And you could introduce the beautiful eyes of your German butler to the entire neighbourhood . Of course , I do n't know whether Mr. Ollerenshaw would like it . "
59514	59517	59519	59519	Helen	79	" Oh ! "
59524	59532	59519	59519	Helen	79	" uncle would do as I wish . "
59545	59554	59555	59555	Sarah	107	" The idea does n't appeal to you ? "
59563	59569	59571	59571	Helen	79	" Yes , it does , "
59573	59594	59571	59571	Helen	79	" But I must think it over . Now , would you care to see the rest of the house ? "
59595	59618	59560	59560	her	107	" I should love to . Oh dear , I 've left my handkerchief with my purse in the drawing - room . "
59619	59623	59625	59625	Helen	79	" Have mine ! "
59728	59737	59722	59722	Helen	79	" Will the rector be in this afternoon ? "
59738	59746	59722	59722	Helen	79	" I should say so . Why ? "
59747	59772	59722	59722	Helen	79	" I was thinking we might walk down there together , and I could suggest to him at once about having the concert here . "
59778	59784	59773	59773	Sarah	107	" Then you 've decided ? "
59785	59788	59722	59722	Helen	79	" Certainly . "
59789	59801	59773	59773	Sarah	107	" How funny you are , Nell , with your decisions ! "
59861	59882	59848	59848	Helen	79	" Fancy that place being all empty . Are n't you afraid of sleeping there while your uncle is away ? "
59883	59886	59888	59888	Helen	79	" No , "
59890	59902	59888	59888	Helen	79	" But I should be afraid if Georgiana was n't afraid . "
59997	60010	59991	59991	she	107	" I suppose you 've heard all about Andrew and Emanuel Prockter ? "
60027	60030	60032	60032	she	79	" No , "
60034	60039	60032	60032	she	79	" What about them ? "
60040	60052	59991	59991	she	107	" You do n't mean to say you 've not heard ? "
60053	60059	60032	60032	she	79	" No . What about ? "
60060	60067	59991	59991	she	107	" The quarrel between those two ? "
60068	60074	60032	60032	she	79	" Emanuel and Mr. Dean ? "
60075	60084	59991	59991	she	107	" Yes . But you must have heard ? "
60085	60102	60032	60032	she	79	" I assure you , Sally , no one has told me a word about it . "
60113	60131	59991	59991	she	107	" But they quarrelled up here . I did hear that Andrew threw Emanuel into your lake . "
60132	60138	59991	59991	she	107	" Who told you that ? "
60139	60182	59991	59991	she	107	" It was Mrs. Prockter . She was calling on the mater yesterday , and she seemed to be full of it - according to the mater 's account . Mrs. Prockter 's idea was that they had quarrelled about a woman . "
60183	60192	60194	60194	Helen	79	" Mrs. Prockter shall be repaid for this , "
60198	60213	60215	60215	Helen	79	" Surely Emanuel has n't been falling in love with Lilian , has he ? "
60232	60237	60239	60239	Sally	107	" Oh , no ! "
60243	60249	60239	60239	Sally	107	" It 's not Lilian . "
60266	60276	60281	60281	her	107	" You know perfectly well who the woman is , "
60288	60307	60285	60285	Helen	79	" I think I can explain it . They were both at our house the day we removed . "
60308	60314	60316	60316	Sarah	107	" Oh , were they ? "
60324	60382	60285	60285	Helen	79	" And Mr. Dean fell off some steps that Emanuel was supposed to be holding . I thought he was furious - but not to that point . That 's probably the secret of the whole thing . As for Mr. Dean having pushed Emanuel into the lake , I do n't believe a word of it . "
60383	60400	60285	60285	Helen	79	" Then how was it that Emanuel had a cold and had to stay in bed ? "
60401	60421	60285	60285	Helen	79	" My dear , to have a cold it is n't necessary to have been thrown into Wilbraham Water ! "
60422	60427	60428	60428	Sarah	107	" That 's true , "
60431	60434	60435	60435	Helen	79	" However , "
60439	60452	60435	60435	Helen	79	" I 'll find out all about it and let you know . "
60453	60460	60285	60285	Helen	79	" How shall you find out ? "
60461	60482	60435	60435	Helen	79	" I shall make Emanuel tell me . He will tell me anything . And he 's a dear boy . "
60483	60492	60493	60493	Sarah	107	" Do you see him often up here ? "
60496	60501	60435	60435	Helen	79	" Oh , yes ! "
60507	60558	60559	60559	She	107	" We get on together excellently . And I 'm pretty sure that Emanuel is not - well - interested in any other woman . That 's why I should say that they have not been quarrelling about a woman . Unless , of course , the woman is myself . "
60565	60577	60559	60559	She	107	" But I 'm not jealous . I can trust Emanuel . "
60590	60593	60594	60594	Sarah	107	" Then , "
60597	60607	60594	60594	Sarah	107	" you and Emanuel - you do n't mean - "
60608	60624	60582	60582	she	107	" My dear Sally , do n't you think Emanuel is a perfectly delightful boy ? "
60625	60630	60632	60632	Sarah	107	" Oh , yes ! "
60634	60639	60641	60641	Helen	79	" So do I , "
60643	60648	60582	60582	she	107	" But are you - "
60649	60653	60654	60654	Helen	79	" Between ourselves , "
60657	60671	60654	60654	Helen	79	" Mind you , between ourselves - I could imagine stranger things happening . "
60672	60675	60677	60677	Sarah	107	" Well , "
60679	60684	60677	60677	Sarah	107	" this is news . "
60685	60692	60654	60654	Helen	79	" Mind , not a syllable ! "
60693	60700	60677	60677	Sarah	107	" Oh , of course not . "
60701	60706	60707	60707	Helen	79	" By the way , "
60710	60721	60707	60707	Helen	79	" when are Andrew and Lilian going to get married ? "
60722	60748	60677	60677	Sarah	107	" I do n't know . No one knows . One confidence for another , my dear ; they do n't always hit it off . "
60749	60754	60755	60755	Helen	79	" What a pity ! "
60758	60784	60755	60755	Helen	79	" Because if ever two people were suited to each other in this world , they are . But I hope they 'll shake down . "
61224	61230	61232	61233	the divine	1604	" Ha ! Mr. Ollerenshaw ! "
61235	61257	61232	61233	the divine	1604	" Your niece told me only yesterday that you were still in Derby buying property , and would not be back . "
61258	61266	61268	61268	James	74	" I 've bought it , parson , "
61270	61275	61277	61278	the divine	1604	" Ha ! ha ! "
61321	61337	61318	61318	he	74	" Ha ! ha ! So you decided to come to my concert , eh ? "
61338	61346	61348	61348	James	74	" I only heard of it yesterday , "
61350	61353	61355	61356	the divine	1604	" Well , "
61358	61392	61355	61356	the divine	1604	" I 'm afraid they 'll be waiting for me . Ha ! ha ! This way , is n't it ? Fine place you 've got here . Very fine ! Noble ! "
61665	61668	61670	61670	him	74	" Hush ! "
61816	61820	61822	61823	Emanuel Prockter	95	" O Love ! "
61850	61854	61845	61845	Helen	79	" O Love ! "
61915	61919	61892	61892	he	95	" O Love ! "
62188	62207	62169	62169	Helen	79	" What 's the matter with you , Mr. Prockter ? It was n't my voice that cracked . "
62539	62547	62549	62549	she	79	" So here you are , uncle ! "
62555	62572	62549	62549	she	79	" I 'm so glad you got back in time . Can you lend me sixpence ? "
62573	62579	62531	62531	She	79	" What for , lass ? "
62580	62600	62549	62549	she	79	" I want to give it to the man who 's taking away the chairs I had to hire . "
62601	62617	62531	62531	She	79	" What 's become of that seven hundred and seventy pound odd as ye had ? "
62618	62621	62622	62622	she	79	" Oh , "
62627	62633	62622	62622	she	79	" I 've spent that . "
62648	62669	62622	62622	she	79	" And I 'm in debt - lots . But we 'll talk about that later . Sixpence , please . "
62727	62741	62742	62742	she	79	" You see , I 've had all the bells put in order , "
62752	62755	62757	62757	she	79	" Fritz , "
62759	62770	62757	62757	she	79	" give this sixpence to the man with the chairs . "
62771	62776	62777	62777	Fritz	160	" Yes , miss , "
62781	62789	62777	62777	Fritz	160	" A note for you , miss . "
62803	62809	62811	62811	she	79	" Excuse me , uncle , "
62817	62825	62827	62827	he	160	" Dinna ' mind me , lass , "
62833	62861	62791	62791	he	160	" I must see you by the Water to - night at nine o'clock . Do n't fail , or there will be a row . - A.D. "
62866	62872	62874	62874	she	79	" No answer , Fritz , "
62876	62884	62874	62874	she	79	" Tell cook , dinner for two . "
62885	62890	62892	62892	James	74	" Who 's he ? "
62900	62906	62908	62908	Helen	79	" That 's our butler , "
62912	62920	62908	62908	Helen	79	" Do n't you like his eyes ? "
62921	62929	62931	62931	James	74	" I wouldna ' swop him eyes , "
62947	62960	62961	62961	she	79	" Do n't be late for dinner , will you , uncle ? "
62965	62968	62969	62969	he	74	" Dinner ! "
62972	62985	62969	62969	he	74	" I had my dinner at Derby . What about my tea ? "
62986	62991	62992	62992	she	79	" I mean tea , "
63021	63027	63028	63028	he	74	" Look here , lass , "
63032	63062	63030	63030	her	79	" A straight question deserves a straight answer . I 'm not given to curiosity , as a rule , but what is Emanuel Prockter doing on my bed ? "
63063	63070	63071	63071	Helen	79	" Emanuel Prockter on your bed ! "
63086	63091	63092	63092	he	74	" On my bed ! "
63153	63162	63163	63163	Helen	79	" Go and ask him how he feels , "
63178	63184	63175	63176	Mr. Prockter	95	" one of his attacks , "
63190	63199	63201	63201	Helen	79	" But he ca n't have his mother , "
63219	63223	63214	63214	He	95	" And she laughed .
63224	63231	63232	63232	James	74	" No , her is n't , "
63236	63241	63232	63232	James	74	" Her 's at wum "
63244	63252	63214	63214	He	95	" How do you know , uncle ? "
63253	63257	63259	63259	James	74	" I know , "
63261	63268	63259	63259	James	74	" Her'd better be sent for . "
63434	63442	63444	63444	Helen	79	" You know that Emanuel is here ? "
63461	63469	63470	63471	Mrs. Prockter	84	" I thought Mr. Ollerenshaw wanted me , "
63484	63484	63470	63471	Mrs. Prockter	84	"
63485	63496	63498	63498	Helen	79	" It was I who wanted to speak to you , "
63500	63533	63498	63498	Helen	79	" The truth is that Emanuel is lying on uncle 's bed , unwell or something , and he expressed a wish to see you . He was singing at the concert - "
63534	63545	63546	63547	Mrs. Prockter	84	" So sorry I was n't able to be here , "
63554	63560	63561	63561	Helen	79	" We missed you awfully , "
63565	63575	63576	63576	she	79	" The rector was inconsolable . So was everybody , "
63593	63600	63576	63576	she	79	" And he had a breakdown . "
63601	63606	63546	63547	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Who ? Emanuel ? "
63607	63664	63576	63576	she	79	" I was accompanying him , and I am afraid it was my fault . Anyhow , he did n't finish his song . And then we missed him . He had asked the butler to let him lie down somewhere , and uncle found him in his bedroom . I hope it 's nothing serious . "
63665	63672	63674	63675	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Oh , my dear girl , "
63686	63723	63674	63675	Mrs. Prockter	84	" if it 's only one of Emanuel 's singing breakdowns , we need n't worry . Can I go up and talk sense to him ? He 's just like a child , you know . "
63724	63731	63733	63733	Helen	79	" Let me take you up , "
63883	63891	63892	63892	James	74	" Is her up there with him ? "
63902	63917	63919	63919	James	74	" Ye'd better ask her stop and have something to eat wi ' us , "
64068	64078	64079	64079	she	79	" Tell cook there will be three to dinner , "
64102	64110	64112	64112	she	84	" The foolish boy is seriously damaged , "
64114	64118	64119	64119	Helen	79	" Not hurt ? "
64122	64209	64093	64094	Mrs. Prockter	84	" Yes . But only in his dignity . He pretends it 's his throat , but it is n't . It 's only his dignity . I suppose all singers are children , like that . I 'm really ashamed to have to ask you to let him lie there a little , dear Miss Rathbone ; but he is positively sure that he ca n't get up . I 've been through these crises with him before , but never one quite so bad . "
64217	64228	64229	64229	Helen	79	" I 'll let him lie there on one condition , "
64233	64257	64229	64229	Helen	79	" And that is that you stay to dinner . I am relying on you . And I wo n't take a refusal . "
64269	64272	64273	64273	she	84	" James , "
64276	64293	64273	64273	she	84	" you 've told her . And you promised you would n't till to - morrow . "
64294	64297	64299	64299	James	74	" Nay ! "
64301	64320	64299	64299	James	74	" I 've said nowt ! It 's you as has let it out , now , missis ! "
64321	64329	64330	64330	Helen	79	" Told me what , Mrs. Prockter ? "
64343	64348	64350	64352	the elder dame	1696	" My dear girl , "
64354	64406	64350	64352	the elder dame	1696	" do not call me Mrs. Prockter . I am Mrs. Ollerenshaw . I am the property that your uncle has been buying at Derby . And he is my sick relative at Nottingham . We preferred to do it like that . We could not have survived engagements and felicitations . "
64407	64420	64421	64421	Helen	79	" Oh , you wicked sinners ! You - you terrible darlings ! "
64438	64445	64447	64447	James	74	" Bless us ! Bless us ! "
64564	64567	64569	64569	James	74	" Ay ! "
64589	64631	64575	64575	he	74	" Dickens - Charles Dickens - that 's the chap 's name . I could n't think of it when I was telling you about th ' book th ' other day . I mun ' go on wi ' that . "
64632	64640	64642	64643	his wife	2122	" Could n't you play us something ? "
64846	64852	64854	64854	he	1946	" So you 've come , "
64858	64864	64865	64865	Helen	79	" What do you want ? "
64869	64901	64826	64826	his	1946	" I want to speak to you . That 's what I want . If you care for Emanuel Prockter , why did you play that trick on him this afternoon ? "
64902	64906	64826	64826	his	1946	" What trick ? "
64907	64942	64826	64826	his	1946	" You know perfectly well what I mean . So I 'll thank you not to beat about the bush . The plain fact is that you do n't care a pin for Prockter . "
64943	64950	64826	64826	his	1946	" I never said I did . "
64951	64986	64826	64826	his	1946	" You 've made every one believe you did , anyhow . You 've even made me think so , though all the time I knew it was impossible . An ass like that ! "
64987	64993	64994	64994	Helen	79	" What do you want ? "
65052	65061	65062	65063	Andrew Dean	113	" I broke off my engagement last night , "
65068	65071	65072	65072	Helen	79	" Really ! "
65075	65083	65166	65166	Andrew	113	" You do n't seem to care . "
65084	65131	65166	65166	Andrew	113	" I do n't see what it has to do with me . But if you talked to Lilian Swetnam in the same nice agreeable manner that you talk to me , I ca n't say I 'm surprised to hear that she broke with you . "
65132	65139	65140	65140	Andrew	113	" Who told you she broke ? "
65143	65147	65149	65149	Helen	79	" I guessed , "
65151	65165	65149	65149	Helen	79	" You 'd never have had the courage to break it off yourself . "
65172	65184	65185	65185	she	79	" If you mean to serve me as you served Emanuel , "
65192	65216	65185	65185	she	79	" please do it as gently as you can . And do n't throw me far . I can only swim a little . "
65221	65226	65227	65227	she	79	" Good - night , "
65230	65234	65235	65235	he	113	" Look here ! "
65242	65295	65341	65341	Helen	79	" What 's the matter with you ? I know I ought n't to have asked Lilian to marry me . Everybody knows that . It 's universally agreed . But are you going to make that an excuse for spoiling the whole show ? What 's up with you is pride . "
65296	65304	65305	65305	she	79	" And what is up with you ? "
65308	65311	65313	65313	he	113	" Pride , "
65315	65333	65313	65313	he	113	" How could I know you were in love with me all the time ? How could - "
65334	65339	65341	65341	Helen	79	" You could n't , "
65343	65356	65341	65341	Helen	79	" I was n't . No more than you were with me . "
65357	65376	65313	65313	he	113	" If you were n't in love with me , why did you try to make me jealous ? "
65377	65385	65386	65386	she	79	" Me try to make you jealous ! "
65391	65399	65386	65386	she	79	" You flatter yourself , Mr. Dean ! "
65400	65420	65421	65421	he	1716	" I can stand a good deal , but I ca n't stand lies , and I wo n't ! "
65424	65435	65421	65421	he	1716	" I say you did try to make me jealous . "
65571	65577	65563	65563	he	1716	" Will you marry me ? "
65578	65581	65582	65582	she	79	" Yes , "
65585	65594	65563	65563	he	1716	" Did you try to make me jealous ? "
65595	65598	65563	65563	he	1716	" Yes . "
65611	65618	65608	65608	he	1716	" I 'm an awful brute ! "
65619	65627	65628	65628	she	79	" I like you as you are , "
65656	65660	65661	65661	she	79	" Of course , "
65664	65674	65661	65661	she	79	" we must n't say anything about it yet . "
65675	65678	65679	65679	he	1716	" No , "
65682	65698	65679	65679	he	1716	" To let it out at once might make unpleasantness between you and the Swetnams . "
65699	65702	65703	65703	she	79	" Oh ! "
65706	65739	65703	65703	she	79	" I was n't thinking of that . But there 's another love - affair in the house , and no house will hold two at once . It would be nauseating . "
65834	65840	65823	65823	They	1720	" like a house afire . "
