2778	2783	2784	2784	he	110	" Yes , sir , "
2787	2983	2784	2784	he	110	" it 's quite true , though I do n't suppose it has anything to do with the sugar and salt . Two clergymen came in and drank soup here very early , as soon as the shutters were taken down . They were both very quiet , respectable people ; one of them paid the bill and went out ; the other , who seemed a slower coach altogether , was some minutes longer getting his things together . But he went at last . Only , the instant before he stepped into the street he deliberately picked up his cup , which he had only half emptied , and threw the soup slap on the wall . I was in the back room myself , and so was the waiter ; so I could only rush out in time to find the wall splashed and the shop empty . It do n't do any particular damage , but it was confounded cheek ; and I tried to catch the men in the street . They were too far off though ; I only noticed they went round the next corner into Carstairs Street . "

4423	4439	4419	4421	his principal assistant	508	" Why , what proof is there that this has anything to do with them ? "
4449	4452	4453	4453	he	110	" Proof ! "
4456	4512	4513	4513	He	110	" Good God ! the man is looking for proof ! Why , of course , the chances are twenty to one that it has nothing to do with them . But what else can we do ? Do n't you see we must either follow one wild possibility or else go home to bed ? "
4563	4572	4574	4574	Valentin	110	" Got your window broken , I see , "
4584	4589	4591	4592	the attendant	446	" Yes , sir , "
4619	4626	4627	4627	he	432	" Ah , yes , sir , "
4630	4639	4627	4627	he	432	" Very odd thing , that , sir . "
4640	4643	4612	4612	himself	432	" Indeed ? "
4649	4656	4612	4612	himself	432	" said the detective with careless curiosity .
4657	4667	4669	4670	the waiter	432	" Well , two gents in black came in , "
4672	4797	4669	4670	the waiter	432	" two of those foreign parsons that are running about . They had a cheap and quiet little lunch , and one of them paid for it and went out . The other was just going out to join him when I looked at my change again and found he 'd paid me more than three times too much . ` Here , ' I says to the chap who was nearly out of the door , ` you 've paid too much . ' ` Oh , ' he says , very cool , ` have we ? ' ' Yes , ' I says , and picks up the bill to show him . Well , that was a knock - out . "
4798	4804	4806	4807	his interlocutor	516	" What do you mean ? "
4809	4844	4669	4670	the waiter	432	" Well , I 'd have sworn on seven Bibles that I 'd put 4s . on that bill . But now I saw I 'd put 14s . , as plain as paint . "
4845	4848	4850	4850	Valentin	110	" Well ? "
4860	4864	4850	4850	Valentin	110	" and then ? "
4865	4922	4669	4670	the waiter	432	" The parson at the door he says all serene , ` Sorry to confuse your accounts , but it 'll pay for the window . ' ` What window ? ' I says . ` The one I 'm going to break , ' he says , and smashed that blessed pane with his umbrella . "
4938	4945	4931	4932	the inspector	480	" Are we after escaped lunatics ? "
4958	5015	4946	4947	The waiter	432	" I was so knocked silly for a second , I could n't do anything . The man marched out of the place and joined his friend just round the corner . Then they went so quick up Bullock Street that I could n't catch them , though I ran round the bars to do it . "
5016	5020	5022	5023	the detective	420	" Bullock Street , "
5237	5240	5241	5241	she	529	" Oh , "
5244	5260	5241	5241	she	529	" if you 've come about that parcel , I 've sent it off already . "
5261	5264	5266	5266	Valentin	110	" Parcel ? "
5277	5290	5271	5271	his	110	" I mean the parcel the gentleman left - the clergyman gentleman . "
5291	5297	5299	5299	Valentin	110	" For goodness ' sake , "
5311	5322	5299	5299	Valentin	110	" for Heaven 's sake tell us what happened exactly . "
5323	5326	5328	5329	the woman	532	" Well , "
5334	5496	5328	5329	the woman	532	" the clergymen came in about half an hour ago and bought some peppermints and talked a bit , and then went off towards the Heath . But a second after , one of them runs back into the shop and says , ` Have I left a parcel ! ' Well , I looked everywhere and could n't see one ; so he says , ` Never mind ; but if it should turn up , please post it to this address , ' and he left me the address and a shilling for my trouble . And sure enough , though I thought I 'd looked everywhere , I found he 'd left a brown paper parcel , so I posted it to the place he said . I ca n't remember the address now ; it was somewhere in Westminster . But as the thing seemed so important , I thought perhaps the police had come about it . "
5497	5502	5504	5504	Valentin	110	" So they have , "
5507	5514	5504	5504	Valentin	110	" Is Hampstead Heath near here ? "
5515	5522	5524	5525	the woman	532	" Straight on for fifteen minutes , "
5527	5538	5524	5525	the woman	532	" and you 'll come right out on the open . "
5971	6286	5931	5935	a Father Brown from Essex	558	" ; and Father Brown undoubtedly was the little greenhorn in the train . Now there was nothing wonderful about the fact that what Valentin had found out Flambeau had also found out ; Flambeau found out everything . Also there was nothing wonderful in the fact that when Flambeau heard of a sapphire cross he should try to steal it ; that was the most natural thing in all natural history . And most certainly there was nothing wonderful about the fact that Flambeau should have it all his own way with such a silly sheep as the man with the umbrella and the parcels . He was the sort of man whom anybody could lead on a string to the North Pole ; it was not surprising that an actor like Flambeau , dressed as another priest , could lead him to Hampstead Heath . So far the crime seemed clear enough ; and while the detective pitied the priest for his helplessness , he almost despised Flambeau for condescending to so gullible a victim . But when Valentin thought of all that had happened in between , of all that had led him to his triumph , he racked his brains for the smallest rhyme or reason in it . What had the stealing of a blue - and - silver cross from a priest from Essex to do with chucking soup at wall paper ? What had it to do with calling nuts oranges , or with paying for windows first and breaking them afterwards ? He had come to the end of his chase ; yet somehow he had missed the middle of it . When he failed which was seldom , he had usually grasped the clue , but nevertheless missed the criminal . Here he had grasped the criminal , but still he could not grasp the clue .
6406	6408	6380	6381	the hunters	567	" reason "
6734	6750	6726	6727	Father Brown	121	" ... what they really meant in the Middle Ages by the heavens being incorruptible . "
6761	6801	6755	6755	his	587	" Ah , yes , these modern infidels appeal to their reason ; but who can look at those millions of worlds and not feel that there may well be wonderful universes above us where reason is utterly unreasonable ? "
6802	6805	6807	6809	the other priest	588	" No , "
6811	6875	6807	6809	the other priest	588	" reason is always reasonable , even in the last limbo , in the lost borderland of things . I know that people charge the Church with lowering reason , but it is just the other way . Alone on earth , the Church makes reason really supreme . Alone on earth , the Church affirms that God himself is bound by reason . "
6890	6901	6880	6880	his	588	" Yet who knows if in that infinite universe - ? "
6902	6907	6909	6911	the little priest	363	" Only infinite physically , "
6919	6933	6909	6911	the little priest	363	" not infinite in the sense of escaping from the laws of truth . "
7008	7124	7002	7003	Father Brown	121	" Reason and justice grip the remotest and the loneliest star . Look at those stars . Do n't they look as if they were single diamonds and sapphires ? Well , you can imagine any mad botany or geology you please . Think of forests of adamant with leaves of brilliants . Think the moon is a blue moon , a single elephantine sapphire . But do n't fancy that all that frantic astronomy would make the smallest difference to the reason and justice of conduct . On plains of opal , under cliffs cut out of pearl , you would still find a notice - board , ` Thou shalt not steal . ' "
7197	7230	7183	7183	he	110	" Well , I think that other worlds may perhaps rise higher than our reason . The mystery of heaven is unfathomable , and I for one can only bow my head . "
7252	7283	7249	7249	he	110	" Just hand over that sapphire cross of yours , will you ? We 're all alone here , and I could pull you to pieces like a straw doll . "
7354	7357	7359	7373	the tall priest , in the same low voice and in the same still posture	597	" Yes , "
7375	7382	7359	7373	the tall priest , in the same low voice and in the same still posture	597	" yes , I am Flambeau . "
7392	7402	7389	7389	he	110	" Come , will you give me that cross ? "
7403	7406	7408	7409	the other	482	" No , "
7442	7445	7446	7446	he	599	" No , "
7449	7498	7446	7446	he	599	" you wo n't give it me , you proud prelate . You wo n't give it me , you little celibate simpleton . Shall I tell you why you wo n't give it me ? Because I 've got it already in my own breast - pocket . "

7561	7615	7558	7558	he	600	" Yes , you turnip , I am quite sure . I had the sense to make a duplicate of the right parcel , and now , my friend , you 've got the duplicate and I 've got the jewels . An old dodge , Father Brown - a very old dodge . "
7616	7619	7621	7622	Father Brown	121	" Yes , "
7639	7649	7626	7626	his	121	" Yes , I 've heard of it before . "
7668	7675	7676	7676	he	600	" You have heard of it ? "
7679	7687	7676	7676	he	600	" Where have you heard of it ? "
7688	7702	7704	7706	the little man	602	" Well , I must n't tell you his name , of course , "
7709	7760	7704	7706	the little man	602	" He was a penitent , you know . He had lived prosperously for about twenty years entirely on duplicate brown paper parcels . And so , you see , when I began to suspect you , I thought of this poor chap 's way of doing it at once . "
7761	7767	7769	7770	the outlaw	603	" Began to suspect me ? "
7775	7799	7769	7770	the outlaw	603	" Did you really have the gumption to suspect me just because I brought you up to this bare part of the heath ? "
7800	7805	7807	7807	Brown	121	" No , no , "
7814	7842	7807	7807	Brown	121	" You see , I suspected you when we first met . It 's that little bulge up the sleeve where you people have the spiked bracelet . "
7843	7848	7850	7850	Flambeau	111	" How in Tartarus , "
7852	7862	7850	7850	Flambeau	111	" did you ever hear of the spiked bracelet ? "
7863	7874	7880	7880	his	121	" Oh , one 's little flock , you know ! "
7885	7972	7880	7880	his	121	" When I was a curate in Hartlepool , there were three of them with spiked bracelets . So , as I suspected you from the first , do n't you see , I made sure that the cross should go safe , anyhow . I 'm afraid I watched you , you know . So at last I saw you change the parcels . Then , do n't you see , I changed them back again . And then I left the right one behind . "
7973	7978	7980	7980	Flambeau	111	" Left it behind ? "
7998	8006	8008	8010	the little priest	363	" Well , it was like this , "
8019	8090	8008	8010	the little priest	363	" I went back to that sweet - shop and asked if I 'd left a parcel , and gave them a particular address if it turned up . Well , I knew I had n't ; but when I went away again I did . So , instead of running after me with that valuable parcel , they have sent it flying to a friend of mine in Westminster . "
8097	8142	8143	8143	he	363	" I learnt that , too , from a poor fellow in Hartlepool . He used to do it with handbags he stole at railway stations , but he 's in a monastery now . Oh , one gets to know , you know , "
8158	8174	8092	8092	he	363	" We ca n't help being priests . People come and tell us these things . "
8218	8273	8205	8205	He	111	" I do n't believe you . I do n't believe a bumpkin like you could manage all that . I believe you 've still got the stuff on you , and if you do n't give it up - why , we 're all alone , and I 'll take it by force ! "
8274	8277	8279	8280	Father Brown	121	" No , "
8288	8318	8279	8280	Father Brown	121	" you wo n't take it by force . First , because I really have n't still got it . And , second , because we are not alone . "
8326	8331	8333	8334	Father Brown	121	" Behind that tree , "
8338	8521	8333	8334	Father Brown	121	" are two strong policemen and the greatest detective alive . How did they come here , do you ask ? Why , I brought them , of course ! How did I do it ? Why , I 'll tell you if you like ! Lord bless you , we have to know twenty such things when we work among the criminal classes ! Well , I was n't sure you were a thief , and it would never do to make a scandal against one of our own clergy . So I just tested you to see if anything would make you show yourself . A man generally makes a small scene if he finds salt in his coffee ; if he does n't , he has some reason for keeping quiet . I changed the salt and sugar , and you kept quiet . A man generally objects if his bill is three times too big . If he pays it , he has some motive for passing unnoticed . I altered your bill , and you paid it . "
8552	8555	8558	8559	Father Brown	121	" Well , "
8565	8662	8558	8559	Father Brown	121	" as you would n't leave any tracks for the police , of course somebody had to . At every place we went to , I took care to do something that would get us talked about for the rest of the day . I did n't do much harm - a splashed wall , spilt apples , a broken window ; but I saved the cross , as the cross will always be saved . It is at Westminster by now . I rather wonder you did n't stop it with the Donkey 's Whistle . "
8663	8668	8670	8670	Flambeau	111	" With the what ? "
8672	8683	8685	8686	the priest	374	" I 'm glad you 've never heard of it , "
8692	8733	8685	8686	the priest	374	" It 's a foul thing . I 'm sure you 're too good a man for a Whistler . I could n't have countered it even with the Spots myself ; I 'm not strong enough in the legs . "
8734	8743	8745	8746	the other	482	" What on earth are you talking about ? "
8748	8760	8762	8763	Father Brown	121	" Well , I did think you 'd know the Spots , "
8768	8781	8762	8763	Father Brown	121	" Oh , you ca n't have gone so very wrong yet ! "
8782	8793	8795	8795	Flambeau	111	" How in blazes do you know all these horrors ? "
8813	8825	8826	8826	he	121	" Oh , by being a celibate simpleton , I suppose , "
8829	8885	8826	8826	he	121	" Has it never struck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men 's real sins is not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil ? But , as a matter of fact , another part of my trade , too , made me sure you were n't a priest . "
8886	8889	8891	8892	the thief	609	" What ? "
8897	8902	8904	8905	Father Brown	121	" You attacked reason , "
8907	8913	8904	8905	Father Brown	121	" It 's bad theology . "
8954	8964	8966	8966	Valentin	110	" Do not bow to me , mon ami , "

11009	11022	11004	11005	Lord Galloway	123	" A corpse in the grass - a blood - stained corpse . "
11034	11042	11044	11045	the doctor	696	" We must tell Valentin at once , "
11061	11069	11048	11049	the other	482	" It is fortunate that he is here "
11152	11157	11158	11158	he	123	" Strange , gentlemen , "
11168	11199	11158	11158	he	123	" that I should have hunted mysteries all over the earth , and now one comes and settles in my own back - yard . But where is the place ? "
11306	11310	11312	11312	Simon	126	" At least , "
11321	11329	11312	11312	Simon	126	" he is none of our party . "
11330	11336	11338	11338	Valentin	110	" Examine him , doctor , "
11342	11349	11338	11338	Valentin	110	" He may not be dead . "
11355	11371	11372	11372	he	696	" He is not quite cold , but I am afraid he is dead enough , "
11375	11384	11372	11372	he	696	" Just help me to lift him up . "
11445	11456	11457	11457	he	110	" He must have been as strong as a gorilla , "
11705	11708	11709	11709	he	110	" Twigs , "
11713	11735	11709	11709	he	110	" twigs , and a total stranger with his head cut off ; that is all there is on this lawn . "
11752	11767	11745	11747	the unnerved Galloway	764	" Who 's that ! Who 's that over there by the garden wall ! "
11812	11816	11817	11817	he	110	" I say , "
11821	11834	11817	11817	he	110	" there are no gates to this garden , do you know . "
11873	11878	11879	11879	he	110	" You are right , "
11882	12131	11879	11879	he	110	" Before we find out how he came to be killed , we may have to find out how he came to be here . Now listen to me , gentlemen . If it can be done without prejudice to my position and duty , we shall all agree that certain distinguished names might well be kept out of this . There are ladies , gentlemen , and there is a foreign ambassador . If we must mark it down as a crime , then it must be followed up as a crime . But till then I can use my own discretion . I am the head of the police ; I am so public that I can afford to be private . Please Heaven , I will clear everyone of my own guests before I call in my men to look for anybody else . Gentlemen , upon your honour , you will none of you leave the house till tomorrow at noon ; there are bedrooms for all . Simon , I think you know where to find my man , Ivan , in the front hall ; he is a confidential man . Tell him to leave another servant on guard and come to me at once . Lord Galloway , you are certainly the best person to tell the ladies what has happened , and prevent a panic . They also must stay . Father Brown and I will remain with the body . "
12304	12315	12317	12317	Valentin	110	" Yes ; look , if you like , Ivan , "
12319	12338	12317	12317	Valentin	110	" but do n't be long . We must go in and thrash this out in the house . "
12351	12354	12355	12355	he	122	" Why , "
12358	12381	12355	12355	he	122	" it 's - no , it is n't ; it ca n't be . Do you know this man , sir ? "
12382	12385	12387	12387	Valentin	110	" No , "
12390	12397	12387	12387	Valentin	110	" we had better go inside . "
12468	12473	12450	12450	He	420	" Is everybody here ? "
12474	12479	12481	12486	the Duchess of Mont St. Michel	657	" Not Mr. Brayne , "
12491	12494	12496	12497	Lord Galloway	123	" No , "
12505	12530	12496	12497	Lord Galloway	123	" And not Mr. Neil O'Brien , I fancy . I saw that gentleman walking in the garden when the corpse was still warm . "
12531	12534	12536	12537	the detective	420	" Ivan , "
12539	12584	12536	12537	the detective	420	" go and fetch Commandant O'Brien and Mr. Brayne . Mr. Brayne , I know , is finishing a cigar in the dining - room ; Commandant O'Brien , I think , is walking up and down the conservatory . I am not sure . "
12611	12669	12600	12600	Valentin	110	" Everyone here knows that a dead man has been found in the garden , his head cut clean from his body . Dr. Simon , you have examined it . Do you think that to cut a man 's throat like that would need great force ? Or , perhaps , only a very sharp knife ? "
12670	12686	12688	12690	the pale doctor	799	" I should say that it could not be done with a knife at all , "
12692	12698	12700	12700	Valentin	110	" Have you any thought , "
12702	12713	12700	12700	Valentin	110	" of a tool with which it could be done ? "
12714	12725	12727	12728	the doctor	696	" Speaking within modern probabilities , I really have n't , "
12735	12780	12731	12731	his	696	" It 's not easy to hack a neck through even clumsily , and this was a very clean cut . It could be done with a battle - axe or an old headsman 's axe , or an old two - handed sword . "
12781	12787	12789	12790	the Duchess	801	" But , good heavens ! "
12796	12812	12789	12790	the Duchess	801	" there are n't any two - handed swords and battle - axes round here . "
12825	12829	12830	12830	he	110	" Tell me , "
12837	12850	12830	12830	he	110	" could it have been done with a long French cavalry sabre ? "
12886	12897	12880	12881	Dr. Simon	126	" A sabre - yes , I suppose it could . "
12898	12902	12904	12904	Valentin	110	" Thank you , "
12906	12912	12904	12904	Valentin	110	" Come in , Ivan . "
12949	12957	12958	12958	he	804	" What do you want with me ? "
12961	12966	12968	12968	Valentin	110	" Please sit down , "
12975	12989	12968	12968	Valentin	110	" Why , you are n't wearing your sword . Where is it ? "
12990	12999	13003	13003	his	128	" I left it on the library table , "
13011	13021	13003	13003	his	128	" It was a nuisance , it was getting - "
13022	13025	13027	13027	Valentin	110	" Ivan , "
13029	13042	13027	13027	Valentin	110	" please go and get the Commandant 's sword from the library . "
13050	13075	13046	13047	the servant	805	" Lord Galloway says he saw you leaving the garden just before he found the corpse . What were you doing in the garden ? "
13085	13088	13089	13089	he	3480	" Oh , "
13095	13108	13089	13089	he	3480	" admirin ' the moon . Communing with Nature , me bhoy . "
13139	13147	13148	13148	he	122	" This is all I can find , "
13151	13158	13160	13160	Valentin	110	" Put it on the table , "
13219	13227	13229	13230	Lady Margaret	125	" I think I can tell you , "
13246	13315	13316	13316	she	811	" I can tell you what Mr. O'Brien was doing in the garden , since he is bound to silence . He was asking me to marry him . I refused ; I said in my family circumstances I could give him nothing but my respect . He was a little angry at that ; he did not seem to think much of my respect . I wonder , "
13325	13356	13316	13316	she	811	" if he will care at all for it now . For I offer it him now . I will swear anywhere that he never did a thing like this . "
13379	13386	13387	13387	he	123	" Hold your tongue , Maggie , "
13394	13413	13387	13387	he	123	" Why should you shield the fellow ? Where 's his sword ? Where 's his confounded cavalry - "
13442	13447	13448	13448	she	716	" You old fool ! "
13459	13531	13448	13448	she	716	" what do you suppose you are trying to prove ? I tell you this man was innocent while with me . But if he was n't innocent , he was still with me . If he murdered a man in the garden , who was it who must have seen - who must at least have known ? Do you hate Neil so much as to put your own daughter - "
13610	13618	13692	13692	he	110	" Was it a very long cigar ? "
13638	13642	13644	13646	little Father Brown	121	" I mean , "
13655	13676	13644	13646	little Father Brown	121	" I mean that cigar Mr. Brayne is finishing . It seems nearly as long as a walking - stick . "
13697	13701	13702	13702	he	110	" Quite right , "
13706	13724	13702	13702	he	110	" Ivan , go and see about Mr. Brayne again , and bring him here at once . "
13744	13748	13749	13749	he	110	" Lady Margaret , "
13752	13825	13749	13749	he	110	" we all feel , I am sure , both gratitude and admiration for your act in rising above your lower dignity and explaining the Commandant 's conduct . But there is a hiatus still . Lord Galloway , I understand , met you passing from the study to the drawing - room , and it was only some minutes afterwards that he found the garden and the Commandant still walking there . "
13826	13832	13834	13834	Margaret	125	" You have to remember , "
13844	13882	13834	13834	Margaret	125	" that I had just refused him , so we should scarcely have come back arm in arm . He is a gentleman , anyhow ; and he loitered behind - and so got charged with murder . "
13883	13889	13891	13891	Valentin	110	" In those few moments , "
13894	13899	13891	13891	Valentin	110	" he might really - "
13913	13919	13920	13920	he	122	" Beg pardon , sir , "
13923	13932	13920	13920	he	122	" but Mr. Brayne has left the house . "
13933	13936	13938	13938	Valentin	110	" Left ! "
13950	13957	13959	13959	Ivan	122	" Gone . Scooted . Evaporated , "
13964	14009	13959	13959	Ivan	122	" His hat and coat are gone , too , and I 'll tell you something to cap it all . I ran outside the house to find any traces of him , and I found one , and a big trace , too . "
14010	14016	14018	14018	Valentin	110	" What do you mean ? "
14020	14026	14028	14029	his servant	826	" I 'll show you , "
14071	14076	14077	14077	he	122	" I found this , "
14080	14113	14077	14077	he	122	" flung among the bushes fifty yards up the road to Paris . In other words , I found it just where your respectable Mr. Brayne threw it when he ran away . "
14150	14153	14154	14154	he	122	" Commandant , "
14157	14176	14177	14177	he	122	" we trust you will always produce this weapon if it is wanted for police examination . Meanwhile , "
14189	14197	14177	14177	he	122	" let me return you your sword . "
14421	14431	14433	14434	the Irishman	732	" I ca n't say it interests me much , "
14437	14527	14433	14434	the Irishman	732	" especially as it seems pretty plain now . Apparently Brayne hated this stranger for some reason ; lured him into the garden , and killed him with my sword . Then he fled to the city , tossing the sword away as he went . By the way , Ivan tells me the dead man had a Yankee dollar in his pocket . So he was a countryman of Brayne 's , and that seems to clinch it . I do n't see any difficulties about the business . "
14528	14535	14537	14538	the doctor	696	" There are five colossal difficulties , "
14541	14692	14537	14538	the doctor	696	" like high walls within walls . Do n't mistake me . I do n't doubt that Brayne did it ; his flight , I fancy , proves that . But as to how he did it . First difficulty : Why should a man kill another man with a great hulking sabre , when he can almost kill him with a pocket knife and put it back in his pocket ? Second difficulty : Why was there no noise or outcry ? Does a man commonly see another come up waving a scimitar and offer no remarks ? Third difficulty : A servant watched the front door all the evening ; and a rat can not get into Valentin 's garden anywhere . How did the dead man get into the garden ? Fourth difficulty : Given the same conditions , how did Brayne get out of the garden ? "
14693	14698	14700	14700	Neil	137	" And the fifth , "
14717	14725	14727	14728	the doctor	696	" Is a trifle , I suppose , "
14730	14801	14727	14728	the doctor	696	" but I think an odd one . When I first saw how the head had been slashed , I supposed the assassin had struck more than once . But on examination I found many cuts across the truncated section ; in other words , they were struck after the head was off . Did Brayne hate his foe so fiendishly that he stood sabring his body in the moonlight ? "
14802	14805	14807	14807	O'Brien	137	" Horrible ! "
14843	14863	14839	14839	he	363	" I say , I 'm sorry to interrupt . But I was sent to tell you the news ! "
14864	14867	14869	14869	Simon	126	" News ? "
14881	14888	14890	14891	Father Brown	121	" Yes , I 'm sorry , "
14894	14904	14890	14891	Father Brown	121	" There 's been another murder , you know . "
14917	14925	14927	14928	the priest	374	" And , what 's stranger still , "
14938	14978	14927	14928	the priest	374	" it 's the same disgusting sort ; it 's another beheading . They found the second head actually bleeding into the river , a few yards along Brayne 's road to Paris ; so they suppose that he - "
14979	14983	14985	14985	O'Brien	137	" Great Heaven ! "
14987	14993	14985	14985	O'Brien	137	" Is Brayne a monomaniac ? "
14994	15000	15002	15003	the priest	374	" There are American vendettas , "
15010	15023	15007	15007	he	374	" They want you to come to the library and see it . "
15486	15493	15495	15495	Valentin	110	" Good morning , Commandant O'Brien , "
15501	15516	15495	15495	Valentin	110	" You have heard of Brayne 's last experiment in butchery , I suppose ? "
15537	15553	15530	15530	he	121	" I suppose it is quite certain that Brayne cut off this head , too . "
15554	15562	15564	15564	Valentin	110	" Well , it seems common sense , "
15573	15605	15564	15564	Valentin	110	" Killed in the same way as the other . Found within a few yards of the other . And sliced by the same weapon which we know he carried away . "
15606	15614	15616	15617	Father Brown	121	" Yes , yes ; I know , "
15620	15637	15616	15617	Father Brown	121	" Yet , you know , I doubt whether Brayne could have cut off this head . "
15638	15642	15644	15645	Dr. Simon	126	" Why not ? "
15652	15657	15659	15660	the priest	374	" Well , doctor , "
15666	15681	15659	15660	the priest	374	" can a man cut off his own head ? I do n't know . "
15708	15719	15721	15722	the priest	374	" Oh , there 's no doubt it 's Brayne , "
15725	15736	15721	15722	the priest	374	" He had exactly that chip in the left ear . "
15760	15773	15753	15753	his	420	" You seem to know a lot about him , Father Brown . "
15774	15778	15780	15782	the little man	602	" I do , "
15785	15804	15780	15782	the little man	602	" I 've been about with him for some weeks . He was thinking of joining our church . "
15825	15830	15831	15831	he	110	" And , perhaps , "
15839	15854	15831	15831	he	110	" perhaps he was also thinking of leaving all his money to your church . "
15855	15860	15862	15862	Brown	121	" Perhaps he was , "
15865	15870	15862	15862	Brown	121	" it is possible . "
15871	15876	15878	15878	Valentin	110	" In that case , "
15885	15903	15878	15878	Valentin	110	" you may indeed know a great deal about him . About his life and about his - "
15914	15922	15923	15923	he	128	" Drop that slanderous rubbish , Valentin , "
15926	15935	15923	15923	he	128	" or there may be more swords yet . "
15952	15955	15956	15956	he	128	" Well , "
15960	16037	15956	15956	he	128	" people 's private opinions can wait . You gentlemen are still bound by your promise to stay ; you must enforce it on yourselves - and on each other . Ivan here will tell you anything more you want to know ; I must get to business and write to the authorities . We ca n't keep this quiet any longer . I shall be writing in my study if there is any more news . "
16038	16047	16049	16050	Dr. Simon	126	" Is there any more news , Ivan ? "
16063	16074	16076	16076	Ivan	122	" Only one more thing , I think , sir , "
16085	16108	16110	16110	he	122	" but that 's important , too , in its way . There 's that old buffer you found on the lawn , "
16126	16137	16110	16110	he	122	" We 've found out who he is , anyhow . "
16138	16141	16143	16145	the astonished doctor	883	" Indeed ! "
16147	16153	16143	16145	the astonished doctor	883	" and who is he ? "
16154	16161	16163	16166	the under - detective	884	" His name was Arnold Becker , "
16168	16349	16163	16166	the under - detective	884	" though he went by many aliases . He was a wandering sort of scamp , and is known to have been in America ; so that was where Brayne got his knife into him . We did n't have much to do with him ourselves , for he worked mostly in Germany . We 've communicated , of course , with the German police . But , oddly enough , there was a twin brother of his , named Louis Becker , whom we had a great deal to do with . In fact , we found it necessary to guillotine him only yesterday . Well , it 's a rum thing , gentlemen , but when I saw that fellow flat on the lawn I had the greatest jump of my life . If I had n't seen Louis Becker guillotined with my own eyes , I 'd have sworn it was Louis Becker lying there in the grass . Then , of course , I remembered his twin brother in Germany , and following up the clue - "
16401	16408	16409	16409	he	121	" Stop , stop , stop ! "
16481	16481	16476	16476	I	0	"
16551	16582	16542	16542	He	121	" Let us get this said and done with as quickly as possible . Look here , this will be the quickest way to convince you all of the truth . "
16589	16593	16594	16594	he	121	" Dr. Simon , "
16597	16635	16594	16594	he	121	" you have a strong head - piece , and I heard you this morning asking the five hardest questions about this business . Well , if you will ask them again , I will answer them . "
16657	16689	16652	16652	he	121	" Well , the first question , you know , is why a man should kill another with a clumsy sabre at all when a man can kill with a bodkin ? "
16690	16700	16702	16702	Brown	121	" A man can not behead with a bodkin , "
16705	16715	16702	16702	Brown	121	" and for this murder beheading was absolutely necessary . "
16716	16719	16721	16721	O'Brien	128	" Why ? "
16726	16732	16734	16735	Father Brown	121	" And the next question ? "
16737	16750	16752	16753	the doctor	696	" Well , why did n't the man cry out or anything ? "

16786	16873	16769	16770	the priest	374	" No one saw the point of the twigs . Why should they lie on that lawn look at it so far from any tree ? They were not snapped off ; they were chopped off . The murderer occupied his enemy with some tricks with the sabre , showing how he could cut a branch in mid - air , or what - not . Then , while his enemy bent down to see the result , a silent slash , and the head fell . "
16874	16877	16879	16880	the doctor	696	" Well , "
16883	16898	16879	16880	the doctor	696	" that seems plausible enough . But my next two questions will stump anyone . "
16912	16929	16932	16933	the doctor	696	" You know how all the garden was sealed up like an air - tight chamber , "
16935	16948	16932	16933	the doctor	696	" Well , how did the strange man get into the garden ? "
16958	16969	16953	16955	the little priest	363	" There never was any strange man in the garden . "
17000	17003	17004	17004	he	363	" Oh ! "
17007	17035	17004	17004	he	363	" then we did n't lug a great fat corpse on to a sofa last night ? He had n't got into the garden , I suppose ? "
17036	17042	17044	17044	Brown	121	" Got into the garden ? "
17047	17053	17044	17044	Brown	121	" No , not entirely . "
17054	17059	17061	17061	Simon	126	" Hang it all , "
17063	17076	17061	17061	Simon	126	" a man gets into a garden , or he does n't . "
17077	17081	17083	17084	the priest	374	" Not necessarily , "
17091	17100	17083	17084	the priest	374	" What is the nest question , doctor ? "
17101	17108	17110	17111	Dr. Simon	126	" I fancy you 're ill , "
17114	17135	17110	17111	Dr. Simon	126	" but I 'll ask the next question if you like . How did Brayne get out of the garden ? "
17136	17146	17148	17149	the priest	374	" He did n't get out of the garden , "
17158	17167	17169	17169	Simon	126	" Did n't get out of the garden ? "
17171	17175	17177	17178	Father Brown	121	" Not completely , "
17191	17205	17206	17206	he	126	" A man gets out of a garden , or he does n't , "
17209	17213	17215	17216	Father Brown	121	" Not always , "
17226	17238	17239	17239	he	126	" I have no time to spare on such senseless talk , "
17243	17269	17239	17239	he	126	" If you ca n't understand a man being on one side of a wall or the other , I wo n't trouble you further . "

17344	17347	17349	17351	the motionless priest	902	" Yes , "
17353	17390	17349	17351	the motionless priest	902	" it was done so as to make you assume exactly the one simple falsehood that you did assume . It was done to make you take for granted that the head belonged to the body . "

17573	17619	17570	17570	he	121	" you did not find the strange body of Becker in the garden . You did not find any strange body in the garden . In face of Dr. Simon 's rationalism , I still affirm that Becker was only partly present . Look here ! "
17629	17646	17570	17570	he	121	" you never saw that man in your lives . Did you ever see this man ? "
17687	17691	17694	17694	Brown	121	" The murderer , "
17697	17762	17694	17694	Brown	121	" hacked off his enemy 's head and flung the sword far over the wall . But he was too clever to fling the sword only . He flung the head over the wall also . Then he had only to clap on another head to the corpse , and as he insisted on a private inquest you all imagined a totally new man . "
17763	17769	17771	17771	O'Brien	128	" Clap on another head ! "
17774	17790	17771	17771	O'Brien	128	" What other head ? Heads do n't grow on garden bushes , do they ? "
17791	17794	17796	17797	Father Brown	121	" No , "
17806	18114	17796	17797	Father Brown	121	" there is only one place where they grow . They grow in the basket of the guillotine , beside which the chief of police , Aristide Valentin , was standing not an hour before the murder . Oh , my friends , hear me a minute more before you tear me in pieces . Valentin is an honest man , if being mad for an arguable cause is honesty . But did you never see in that cold , grey eye of his that he is mad ! He would do anything , anything , to break what he calls the superstition of the Cross . He has fought for it and starved for it , and now he has murdered for it . Brayne 's crazy millions had hitherto been scattered among so many sects that they did little to alter the balance of things . But Valentin heard a whisper that Brayne , like so many scatter - brained sceptics , was drifting to us ; and that was quite a different thing . Brayne would pour supplies into the impoverished and pugnacious Church of France ; he would support six Nationalist newspapers like The Guillotine . The battle was already balanced on a point , and the fanatic took flame at the risk . He resolved to destroy the millionaire , and he did it as one would expect the greatest of detectives to commit his only crime . He abstracted the severed head of Becker on some criminological excuse , and took it home in his official box . He had that last argument with Brayne , that Lord Galloway did not hear the end of ; that failing , he led him out into the sealed garden , talked about swordsmanship , used twigs and a sabre for illustration , and - "

24014	24027	24029	24031	the young duke	1174	" Yes ; they 're all here . I noticed it myself , "
24042	24061	24029	24031	the young duke	1174	" Always count 'em as I come in ; they look so queer standing up against the wall . "

24164	24168	24170	24171	the duke	1221	" As usual , "
24173	24181	24170	24171	the duke	1221	" What is the matter with that ! "
24182	24185	24187	24187	Lever	144	" Nothing , "
24194	24208	24187	24187	Lever	144	" only you did not . For one of zem is dead upstairs . "
24272	24280	24257	24258	the duke	1221	" Is there anything we can do ? "
24281	24288	24290	24291	the Jew	1229	" He has had a priest , "
24389	24400	24401	24401	he	1219	" If there was a fifteenth man here , friends , "
24404	24442	24401	24401	he	1219	" that fifteenth fellow was a thief . Down at once to the front and back doors and secure everything ; then we 'll talk . The twenty - four pearls of the club are worth recovering . "
24633	24638	24641	24642	the duke	1221	" Hallo , there ! "
24644	24651	24641	24642	the duke	1221	" Have you seen anyone pass ? "
24666	24679	24652	24654	The short figure	1260	" Perhaps I have got what you are looking for , gentlemen . "
24736	24741	24743	24744	the colonel	1219	" You - you - "
24806	24820	24822	24823	the clergyman	1269	" Valuable things to deposit in a cloak room , are n't they ? "
24829	24838	24840	24841	Mr. Audley	145	" Did - did you steal those things ? "
24847	24852	24854	24855	the cleric	901	" If I did , "
24858	24868	24854	24855	the cleric	901	" at least I am bringing them back again . "
24869	24875	24877	24878	Colonel Pound	147	" But you did n't , "
24887	24900	24902	24903	the other	482	" To make a clean breast of it , I did n't , "
24919	24926	24928	24930	the , colonel	1272	" But you know who did , "
24932	24941	24943	24944	the priest	374	" I do n't know his real name , "
24947	24987	24943	24944	the priest	374	" but I know something of his fighting weight , and a great deal about his spiritual difficulties . I formed the physical estimate when he was trying to throttle me , and the moral estimate when he repented . "
24988	24996	24998	24999	young Chester	150	" Oh , I say - repented ! "
25022	25029	25030	25030	he	121	" Odd , is n't it , "
25033	25123	25030	25030	he	121	" that a thief and a vagabond should repent , when so many who are rich and secure remain hard and frivolous , and without fruit for God or man ? But there , if you will excuse me , you trespass a little upon my province . If you doubt the penitence as a practical fact , there are your knives and forks . You are The Twelve True Fishers , and there are all your silver fish . But He has made me a fisher of men . "
25124	25131	25133	25134	the colonel	1219	" Did you catch this man ? "
25148	25151	25152	25152	he	1219	" Yes , "
25155	25196	25152	25152	he	1219	" I caught him , with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to the ends of the world , and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the thread . "
25265	25282	25258	25258	he	1278	" He must have been a clever fellow , but I think I know a cleverer . "
25283	25290	25292	25293	the other	482	" He was a clever fellow , "
25295	25308	25258	25258	he	1278	" but I am not quite sure of what other you mean . "
25309	25314	25316	25317	the colonel	1219	" I mean you , "
25324	25387	25316	25317	the colonel	1219	" I do n't want to get the fellow jailed ; make yourself easy about that . But I 'd give a good many silver forks to know exactly how you fell into this affair , and how you got the stuff out of him . I reckon you 're the most up - to - date devil of the present company . "
25401	25404	25405	25405	he	121	" Well , "
25410	25455	25405	25405	he	121	" I must n't tell you anything of the man 's identity , or his own story , of course ; but there 's no particular reason why I should n't tell you of the mere outside facts which I found out for myself . "
25506	25512	25513	25513	he	121	" You see , colonel , "
25516	25817	25513	25513	he	121	" I was shut up in that small room there doing some writing , when I heard a pair of feet in this passage doing a dance that was as queer as the dance of death . First came quick , funny little steps , like a man walking on tiptoe for a wager ; then came slow , careless , creaking steps , as of a big man walking about with a cigar . But they were both made by the same feet , I swear , and they came in rotation ; first the run and then the walk , and then the run again . I wondered at first idly and then wildly why a man should act these two parts at once . One walk I knew ; it was just like yours , colonel . It was the walk of a well - fed gentleman waiting for something , who strolls about rather because he is physically alert than because he is mentally impatient . I knew that I knew the other walk , too , but I could not remember what it was . What wild creature had I met on my travels that tore along on tiptoe in that extraordinary style ? Then I heard a clink of plates somewhere ; and the answer stood up as plain as St. Peter 's . It was the walk of a waiter - that walk with the body slanted forward , the eyes looking down , the ball of the toe spurning away the ground , the coat tails and napkin flying . Then I thought for a minute and a half more . And I believe I saw the manner of the crime , as clearly as if I were going to commit it . "
25842	25846	25847	25847	he	147	" A crime , "
25851	25982	25983	25983	he	147	" is like any other work of art . Do n't look surprised ; crimes are by no means the only works of art that come from an infernal workshop . But every work of art , divine or diabolic , has one indispensable mark - I mean , that the centre of it is simple , however much the fulfilment may be complicated . Thus , in Hamlet , let us say , the grotesqueness of the grave - digger , the flowers of the mad girl , the fantastic finery of Osric , the pallor of the ghost and the grin of the skull are all oddities in a sort of tangled wreath round one plain tragic figure of a man in black . Well , this also , "
25996	26011	26012	26012	he	147	" this also is the plain tragedy of a man in black . Yes , "
26025	26174	26012	26012	he	147	" the whole of this tale turns on a black coat . In this , as in Hamlet , there are the rococo excrescences - yourselves , let us say . There is the dead waiter , who was there when he could not be there . There is the invisible hand that swept your table clear of silver and melted into air . But every clever crime is founded ultimately on some one quite simple fact - some fact that is not itself mysterious . The mystification comes in covering it up , in leading men 's thoughts away from it . This large and subtle and in the ordinary course most profitable crime , was built on the plain fact that a gentleman 's evening dress is the same as a waiter 's . All the rest was acting , and thundering good acting , too . "
26175	26178	26180	26181	the colonel	1219	" Still , "
26191	26200	26180	26181	the colonel	1219	" I am not sure that I understand . "
26201	26204	26206	26207	Father Brown	121	" Colonel , "
26209	26655	26206	26207	Father Brown	121	" I tell you that this archangel of impudence who stole your forks walked up and down this passage twenty times in the blaze of all the lamps , in the glare of all the eyes . He did not go and hide in dim corners where suspicion might have searched for him . He kept constantly on the move in the lighted corridors , and everywhere that he went he seemed to be there by right . Do n't ask me what he was like ; you have seen him yourself six or seven times tonight . You were waiting with all the other grand people in the reception room at the end of the passage there , with the terrace just beyond . Whenever he came among you gentlemen , he came in the lightning style of a waiter , with bent head , flapping napkin and flying feet . He shot out on to the terrace , did something to the table cloth , and shot back again towards the office and the waiters ' quarters . By the time he had come under the eye of the office clerk and the waiters he had become another man in every inch of his body , in every instinctive gesture . He strolled among the servants with the absent - minded insolence which they have all seen in their patrons . It was no new thing to them that a swell from the dinner party should pace all parts of the house like an animal at the Zoo ; they know that nothing marks the Smart Set more than a habit of walking where one chooses . When he was magnificently weary of walking down that particular passage he would wheel round and pace back past the office ; in the shadow of the arch just beyond he was altered as by a blast of magic , and went hurrying forward again among the Twelve Fishermen , an obsequious attendant . Why should the gentlemen look at a chance waiter ? Why should the waiters suspect a first - rate walking gentleman ? Once or twice he played the coolest tricks . In the proprietor 's private quarters he called out breezily for a syphon of soda water , saying he was thirsty . He said genially that he would carry it himself , and he did ; he carried it quickly and correctly through the thick of you , a waiter with an obvious errand . Of course , it could not have been kept up long , but it only had to be kept up till the end of the fish course .
26656	26850	26180	26181	the colonel	1219	" His worst moment was when the waiters stood in a row ; but even then he contrived to lean against the wall just round the corner in such a way that for that important instant the waiters thought him a gentleman , while the gentlemen thought him a waiter . The rest went like winking . If any waiter caught him away from the table , that waiter caught a languid aristocrat . He had only to time himself two minutes before the fish was cleared , become a swift servant , and clear it himself . He put the plates down on a sideboard , stuffed the silver in his breast pocket , giving it a bulgy look , and ran like a hare I heard him coming till he came to the cloak room . There he had only to be a plutocrat again - a plutocrat called away suddenly on business . He had only to give his ticket to the cloak - room attendant , and go out again elegantly as he had come in . Only - only I happened to be the cloak - room attendant . "
26851	26859	26861	26862	the colonel	1219	" What did you do to him ? "
26868	26875	26861	26862	the colonel	1219	" What did he tell you ? "
26876	26882	26884	26885	the priest	374	" I beg your pardon , "
26888	26896	26884	26885	the priest	374	" that is where the story ends . "
26897	26904	26906	26906	Pound	147	" And the interesting story begins , "
26908	26929	26906	26906	Pound	147	" I think I understand his professional trick . But I do n't seem to have got hold of yours . "
26930	26936	26938	26939	Father Brown	121	" I must be going , "
26974	26980	26981	26981	he	121	" Come along , Pound , "
26985	27053	26981	26981	he	121	" I 've been looking for you everywhere . The dinner 's going again in spanking style , and old Audley has got to make a speech in honour of the forks being saved . We want to start some new ceremony , do n't you know , to commemorate the occasion . I say , you really got the goods back , what do you suggest ? "
27054	27057	27059	27060	the colonel	1219	" Why , "
27070	27100	27059	27060	the colonel	1219	" I should suggest that henceforward we wear green coats , instead of black . One never knows what mistakes may arise when one looks so like a waiter . "
27101	27108	27110	27112	the young man	1294	" Oh , hang it all ! "
27114	27123	27110	27112	the young man	1294	" a gentleman never looks like a waiter . "
27124	27135	27137	27138	Colonel Pound	147	" Nor a waiter like a gentleman , I suppose , "
27149	27165	27137	27138	Colonel Pound	147	" Reverend sir , your friend must have been very smart to act the gentleman . "
27192	27195	27196	27196	he	121	" Yes , "
27199	27233	27196	27196	he	121	" it must be very hard work to be a gentleman ; but , do you know , I have sometimes thought that it may be almost as laborious to be a waiter . "
27236	27240	27241	27241	he	121	" Good evening , "
27283	27292	27293	27293	Flambeau	146	" The most beautiful crime I ever committed , "
27303	27500	27293	27293	Flambeau	146	" was also , by a singular coincidence , my last . It was committed at Christmas . As an artist I had always attempted to provide crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which I found myself , choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe , as if for a statuary group . Thus squires should be swindled in long rooms panelled with oak ; while Jews , on the other hand , should rather find themselves unexpectedly penniless among the lights and screens of the Cafe Riche . Thus , in England , if I wished to relieve a dean of his riches which is not so easy as you might suppose , I wished to frame him , if I make myself clear , in the green lawns and grey towers of some cathedral town . Similarly , in France , when I had got money out of a rich and wicked peasant which is almost impossible , it gratified me to get his indignant head relieved against a grey line of clipped poplars , and those solemn plains of Gaul over which broods the mighty spirit of Millet .
27501	27613	27293	27293	Flambeau	146	" Well , my last crime was a Christmas crime , a cheery , cosy , English middle - class crime ; a crime of Charles Dickens . I did it in a good old middle - class house near Putney , a house with a crescent of carriage drive , a house with a stable by the side of it , a house with the name on the two outer gates , a house with a monkey tree . Enough , you know the species . I really think my imitation of Dickens 's style was dexterous and literary . It seems almost a pity I repented the same evening . "
27896	27906	27907	27907	she	1306	" Oh , do n't jump , Mr. Crook , "
27914	27921	27907	27907	she	1306	" it 's much too high . "
28030	28041	28042	28042	he	1309	" I think I was meant to be a burglar , "
28046	28082	28042	28042	he	1309	" and I have no doubt I should have been if I had n't happened to be born in that nice house next door . I ca n't see any harm in it , anyhow . "
28083	28091	28092	28092	she	825	" How can you say such things ! "
28095	28098	28100	28102	the young man	1294	" Well , "
28104	28130	28100	28102	the young man	1294	" if you 're born on the wrong side of the wall , I ca n't see that it 's wrong to climb over it . "
28131	28143	28144	28144	she	825	" I never know what you will say or do next , "
28147	28155	28157	28158	Mr. Crook	155	" I do n't often know myself , "
28160	28174	28157	28158	Mr. Crook	155	" but then I am on the right side of the wall now . "
28175	28186	28188	28190	the young lady	1306	" And which is the right side of the wall ? "
28194	28201	28203	28205	the young man	1294	" Whichever side you are on , "
28259	28264	28266	28272	the young man with the red tie	1318	" Hullo , hullo ! "
28274	28304	28266	28272	the young man with the red tie	1318	" here 's somebody born on the right side , anyhow . I did n't know , Miss Adams , that your Santa Claus was so modern as this . "
28305	28324	28266	28272	the young man with the red tie	1318	" Oh , that 's my godfather , Sir Leopold Fischer . He always comes on Boxing Day . "
28344	28350	28340	28341	Ruby Adams	158	" He is very kind . "
28998	29009	29011	29011	Fischer	157	" I 'll put 'em back now , my dear , "
29023	29100	29011	29011	Fischer	157	" I had to be careful of 'em coming down . They 're the three great African diamonds called ` The Flying Stars , ' because they 've been stolen so often . All the big criminals are on the track ; but even the rough men about in the streets and hotels could hardly have kept their hands off them . I might have lost them on the road here . It was quite possible . "
29101	29109	29111	29116	the man in the red tie	1362	" Quite natural , I should say , "
29118	29156	29111	29116	the man in the red tie	1362	" I should n't blame 'em if they had taken 'em . When they ask for bread , and you do n't even give them a stone , I think they might take the stone for themselves . "
29157	29167	29169	29170	the girl	825	" I wo n't have you talking like that , "
29179	29218	29169	29170	the girl	825	" You 've only talked like that since you became a horrid what's - his - name . You know what I mean . What do you call a man who wants to embrace the chimney - sweep ? "
29219	29223	29225	29226	Father Brown	121	" A saint , "
29228	29232	29234	29235	Sir Leopold	157	" I think , "
29242	29249	29234	29235	Sir Leopold	157	" that Ruby means a Socialist . "
29250	29263	29265	29265	Crook	159	" A radical does not mean a man who lives on radishes , "
29327	29327	29306	29307	A Socialist	3775	"
29328	29336	29339	29340	the priest	374	" But who wo n't allow you , "
29346	29353	29339	29340	the priest	374	" to own your own soot . "
29367	29375	29376	29376	he	159	" Does one want to own soot ? "
29379	29383	29385	29385	Brown	121	" One might , "
29393	29425	29385	29385	Brown	121	" I 've heard that gardeners use it . And I once made six children happy at Christmas when the conjuror did n't come , entirely with soot - applied externally . "
29426	29431	29433	29433	Ruby	158	" Oh , splendid , "
29435	29448	29433	29433	Ruby	158	" Oh , I wish you 'd do it to this company . "
29561	29569	29570	29570	he	1377	" Any of you gentlemen Mr. Blount ? "
29626	29638	29639	29639	he	164	" I 'm sick at being such a nuisance , colonel , "
29648	29713	29639	29639	he	164	" but would it upset you if an old acquaintance called on me here tonight on business ? In point of fact it 's Florian , that famous French acrobat and comic actor ; I knew him years ago out West he was a French - Canadian by birth , and he seems to have business for me , though I hardly guess what . "
29714	29721	29723	29724	the colonel	1219	" Of course , of course , "
29727	29745	29723	29724	the colonel	1219	" My dear chap , any friend of yours . No doubt he will prove an acquisition . "
29746	29760	29762	29762	Blount	164	" He 'll black his face , if that 's what you mean , "
29766	29804	29762	29762	Blount	164	" I do n't doubt he 'd black everyone else 's eyes . I do n't care ; I 'm not refined . I like the jolly old pantomime where a man sits on his top hat . "
29805	29812	29814	29816	Sir Leopold Fischer	157	" Not on mine , please , "
29821	29826	29828	29828	Crook	159	" Well , well , "
29832	29850	29828	29828	Crook	159	" do n't let 's quarrel . There are lower jokes than sitting on a top hat . "
29885	29907	29878	29878	his	157	" No doubt you have found something much lower than sitting on a top hat . What is it , pray ? "
29908	29920	29922	29923	the Socialist	1384	" Letting a top hat sit on you , for instance , "
29925	29932	29934	29936	the Canadian farmer	1385	" Now , now , now , "
29942	30106	29938	29938	his	1385	" do n't let 's spoil a jolly evening . What I say is , let 's do something for the company tonight . Not blacking faces or sitting on hats , if you do n't like those - but something of the sort . Why could n't we have a proper old English pantomime - clown , columbine , and so on . I saw one when I left England at twelve years old , and it 's blazed in my brain like a bonfire ever since . I came back to the old country only last year , and I find the thing 's extinct . Nothing but a lot of snivelling fairy plays . I want a hot poker and a policeman made into sausages , and they give me princesses moralising by moonlight , Blue Birds , or something . Blue Beard 's more in my line , and him I like best when he turned into the pantaloon . "
30107	30118	30120	30121	John Crook	159	" I 'm all for making a policeman into sausages , "
30123	30149	30120	30121	John Crook	159	" It 's a better definition of Socialism than some recently given . But surely the get - up would be too big a business . "
30150	30155	30157	30157	Blount	164	" Not a scrap , "
30163	30212	30157	30157	Blount	164	" A harlequinade 's the quickest thing we can do , for two reasons . First , one can gag to any degree ; and , second , all the objects are household things - tables and towel - horses and washing baskets , and things like that . "
30213	30218	30220	30220	Crook	159	" That 's true , "
30228	30249	30220	30220	Crook	159	" But I 'm afraid I ca n't have my policeman 's uniform ? Have n't killed a policeman lately . "
30262	30268	30269	30269	he	164	" Yes , we can ! "
30272	30302	30304	30304	he	164	" I 've got Florian 's address here , and he knows every costumier in London . I 'll phone him to bring a police dress when he comes . "
30312	30321	30323	30323	Ruby	158	" Oh , it 's glorious , godfather , "
30328	30339	30323	30323	Ruby	158	" I 'll be columbine and you shall be pantaloon . "
30352	30359	30360	30360	he	3601	" I think , my dear , "
30363	30372	30360	30360	he	3601	" you must get someone else for pantaloon . "
30373	30383	30385	30386	Colonel Adams	168	" I will be pantaloon , if you like , "
30405	30413	30415	30416	the Canadian	1387	" You ought to have a statue , "
30429	30544	30415	30416	the Canadian	1387	" There , we are all fitted . Mr. Crook shall be clown ; he 's a journalist and knows all the oldest jokes . I can be harlequin , that only wants long legs and jumping about . My friend Florian ' phones he 's bringing the police costume ; he 's changing on the way . We can act it in this very hall , the audience sitting on those broad stairs opposite , one row above another . These front doors can be the back scene , either open or shut . Shut , you see an English interior . Open , a moonlit garden . It all goes by magic . "
30873	30879	30881	30881	Ruby	158	" Uncle is too absurd , "
30897	30904	30888	30888	she	158	" Why is he so wild ? "
30905	30913	30915	30915	Crook	155	" He is harlequin to your columbine , "
30917	30929	30915	30915	Crook	155	" I am only the clown who makes the old jokes . "
30930	30938	30939	30939	she	158	" I wish you were the harlequin , "
31270	31275	31320	31321	the pianist	1433	" Pirates of Penzance , "
31323	31331	31342	31344	the leaping harlequin	1434	" Where did you get that hat ? "
31355	31361	31342	31344	the leaping harlequin	1434	" Then we had another one "
31473	31481	31470	31471	the clown	1413	" I arise from dreams of thee . "
31490	31498	31483	31483	he	1413	" With my bundle on my shoulder , "
31535	31551	31514	31518	the lunatic at the instrument	1447	" I sent a letter to my love and on the way I dropped it . "
31839	31850	31852	31852	Adams	168	" This is a very painful matter , Father Brown , "
31854	31883	31852	31852	Adams	168	" The truth is , those diamonds we all saw this afternoon seem to have vanished from my friend 's tail - coat pocket . And as you - "
31884	31888	31890	31891	Father Brown	121	" As I , "
31898	31905	31890	31891	Father Brown	121	" was sitting just behind him - "
31906	31915	31917	31918	Colonel Adams	168	" Nothing of the sort shall be suggested , "
31938	31954	31917	31918	Colonel Adams	168	" I only ask you to give me the assistance that any gentleman might give . "
31955	31963	31965	31966	Father Brown	121	" Which is turning out his pockets , "
32009	32049	32051	32051	he	1219	" Do you know , I should like to see the inside of your head more than the inside of your pockets . My daughter is one of your people , I know ; well , she has lately - "
32054	32059	32062	32063	old Fischer	157	" She has lately , "
32065	32108	32062	32063	old Fischer	157	" opened her father 's house to a cut - throat Socialist , who says openly he would steal anything from a richer man . This is the end of it . Here is the richer man - and none the richer . "
32109	32123	32125	32125	Brown	121	" If you want the inside of my head you can have it , "
32129	32169	32170	32170	he	121	" What it 's worth you can say afterwards . But the first thing I find in that disused pocket is this : that men who mean to steal diamonds do n't talk Socialism . They are more likely , "
32174	32179	32170	32170	he	121	" to denounce it . "
32191	32250	32186	32187	the priest	374	" You see , we know these people , more or less . That Socialist would no more steal a diamond than a Pyramid . We ought to look at once to the one man we do n't know . The fellow acting the policeman - Florian . Where is he exactly at this minute , I wonder . "
32293	32319	32283	32284	the pantaloon	1464	" The policeman is still lying on the stage . The curtain has gone up and down six times ; he is still lying there . "
32357	32371	32350	32350	he	121	" Please forgive me , colonel , but when did your wife die ? "
32372	32375	32377	32379	the staring soldier	1470	" Wife ! "
32402	32402	32391	32391	James	162	"
32412	32416	32417	32417	he	121	" Come on ! "
32424	32439	32417	32417	he	121	" Come on ! We 've got to go and look at that policeman ! "
32472	32475	32476	32476	he	121	" Chloroform , "
32482	32490	32476	32476	he	121	" I only guessed it just now . "
32504	32513	32499	32500	the colonel	1219	" Please say seriously what all this means . "
32538	32541	32542	32542	he	121	" Gentlemen , "
32545	32587	32542	32542	he	121	" there 's not much time to talk . I must run after the criminal . But this great French actor who played the policeman - this clever corpse the harlequin waltzed with and dandled and threw about - he was - "
32602	32606	32608	32608	Fischer	157	" He was ? "
32611	32616	32618	32619	Father Brown	121	" A real policeman , "
32803	32808	32833	32838	The silver , sparkling figure above	1480	" Well , Flambeau , "
32813	32832	32833	32838	The silver , sparkling figure above	1480	" you really look like a Flying Star ; but that always means a Falling Star at last . "
32859	32983	32854	32857	the little figure below	1481	" You never did anything better , Flambeau . It was clever to come from Canada with a Paris ticket , I suppose just a week after Mrs. Adams died , when no one was in a mood to ask questions . It was cleverer to have marked down the Flying Stars and the very day of Fischer 's coming . But there 's no cleverness , but mere genius , in what followed . Stealing the stones , I suppose , was nothing to you . You could have done it by sleight of hand in a hundred other ways besides that pretence of putting a paper donkey 's tail to Fischer 's coat . But in the rest you eclipsed yourself . "
33014	33019	33021	33023	the man below	1483	" Oh , yes , "
33025	33238	33021	33023	the man below	1483	" I know all about it . I know you not only forced the pantomime , but put it to a double use . You were going to steal the stones quietly ; news came by an accomplice that you were already suspected , and a capable police officer was coming to rout you up that very night . A common thief would have been thankful for the warning and fled ; but you are a poet . You already had the clever notion of hiding the jewels in a blaze of false stage jewellery . Now , you saw that if the dress were a harlequin 's the appearance of a policeman would be quite in keeping . The worthy officer started from Putney police station to find you , and walked into the queerest trap ever set in this world . When the front door opened he walked straight on to the stage of a Christmas pantomime , where he could be kicked , clubbed , stunned and drugged by the dancing harlequin , amid roars of laughter from all the most respectable people in Putney . Oh , you will never do anything better . And now , by the way , you might give me back those diamonds . "
33261	33485	33589	33589	he	1485	" I want you to give them back , Flambeau , and I want you to give up this life . There is still youth and honour and humour in you ; do n't fancy they will last in that trade . Men may keep a sort of level of good , but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil . That road goes down and down . The kind man drinks and turns cruel ; the frank man kills and lies about it . Many a man I 've known started like you to be an honest outlaw , a merry robber of the rich , and ended stamped into slime . Maurice Blum started out as an anarchist of principle , a father of the poor ; he ended a greasy spy and tale - bearer that both sides used and despised . Harry Burke started his free money movement sincerely enough ; now he 's sponging on a half - starved sister for endless brandies and sodas . Lord Amber went into wild society in a sort of chivalry ; now he 's paying blackmail to the lowest vultures in London . Captain Barillon was the great gentleman - apache before your time ; he died in a madhouse , screaming with fear of the "
33487	33565	33589	33589	he	1485	" and receivers that had betrayed him and hunted him down . I know the woods look very free behind you , Flambeau ; I know that in a flash you could melt into them like a monkey . But some day you will be an old grey monkey , Flambeau . You will sit up in your free forest cold at heart and close to death , and the tree - tops will be very bare . "
33593	33659	33589	33589	he	1485	" Your downward steps have begun . You used to boast of doing nothing mean , but you are doing something mean tonight . You are leaving suspicion on an honest boy with a good deal against him already ; you are separating him from the woman he loves and who loves him . But you will do meaner things than that before you die . "
34165	34171	34172	34172	he	1498	" I want , please , "
34177	34189	34172	34172	he	1498	" one halfpenny bun and a small cup of black coffee . "
34201	34211	34198	34198	he	1498	" Also , I want you to marry me . "
34223	34232	34212	34217	The young lady of the shop	1513	" Those are jokes I do n't allow . "
34247	34252	34253	34253	he	1498	" Really and truly , "
34256	34293	34253	34253	he	1498	" it 's as serious - as serious as the halfpenny bun . It is expensive , like the bun ; one pays for it . It is indigestible , like the bun . It hurts . "
34342	34348	34350	34350	Angus	177	" Do n't you think , "
34354	34386	34350	34350	Angus	177	" that it 's rather cruel to eat these halfpenny buns ? They might grow up into penny buns . I shall give up these brutal sports when we are married . "
34509	34517	34518	34518	she	1515	" What on earth are you doing ? "
34521	34528	34529	34529	he	1294	" Duty , my dear Laura , "
34532	34545	34546	34546	she	1515	" Oh , for the Lord 's sake , stop a minute , "
34549	34568	34546	34546	she	1515	" and do n't talk to me in that way . I mean , what is all that ? "
34569	34577	34609	34610	The girl	825	" A ceremonial meal , Miss Hope . "
34578	34584	34585	34585	she	1515	" And what is that ? "
34596	34605	34606	34606	he	1294	" The wedding - cake , Mrs. Angus , "
34656	34667	34668	34668	she	1515	" You do n't give me any time to think , "
34671	34679	34680	34680	he	1294	" I 'm not such a fool , "
34683	34690	34680	34680	he	1294	" that 's my Christian humility . "
34708	34712	34713	34713	she	1515	" Mr. Angus , "
34717	34741	34713	34713	she	1515	" before there is a minute more of this nonsense I must tell you something about myself as shortly as I can . ' "
34742	34745	34747	34747	Angus	181	" Delighted , "
34750	34767	34747	34747	Angus	181	" You might tell me something about myself , too , while you are about it . "
34768	34778	34779	34779	she	1515	" Oh , do hold your tongue and listen , "
34782	34826	34779	34779	she	1515	" It 's nothing that I 'm ashamed of , and it is n't even anything that I 'm specially sorry about . But what would you say if there were something that is no business of mine and yet is my nightmare ? "
34827	34832	34834	34835	the man	315	" In that case , "
34838	34849	34834	34835	the man	315	" I should suggest that you bring back the cake . "
34850	34861	34863	34863	Laura	178	" Well , you must listen to the story first , "
34867	34901	34863	34863	Laura	178	" To begin with , I must tell you that my father owned the inn called the ` Red Fish ' at Ludbury , and I used to serve people in the bar . "
34902	34908	34909	34909	he	315	" I have often wondered , "
34912	34929	34909	34909	he	315	" why there was a kind of a Christian air about this one confectioner 's shop . "
34930	35311	34863	34863	Laura	178	" Ludbury is a sleepy , grassy little hole in the Eastern Counties , and the only kind of people who ever came to the ` Red Fish ' were occasional commercial travellers , and for the rest , the most awful people you can see , only you 've never seen them . I mean little , loungy men , who had just enough to live on and had nothing to do but lean about in bar - rooms and bet on horses , in bad clothes that were just too good for them . Even these wretched young rotters were not very common at our house ; but there were two of them that were a lot too common - common in every sort of way . They both lived on money of their own , and were wearisomely idle and over - dressed . But yet I was a bit sorry for them , because I half believe they slunk into our little empty bar because each of them had a slight deformity ; the sort of thing that some yokels laugh at . It was n't exactly a deformity either ; it was more an oddity . One of them was a surprisingly small man , something like a dwarf , or at least like a jockey . He was not at all jockeyish to look at , though ; he had a round black head and a well - trimmed black beard , bright eyes like a bird 's ; he jingled money in his pockets ; he jangled a great gold watch chain ; and he never turned up except dressed just too much like a gentleman to be one . He was no fool though , though a futile idler ; he was curiously clever at all kinds of things that could n't be the slightest use ; a sort of impromptu conjuring ; making fifteen matches set fire to each other like a regular firework ; or cutting a banana or some such thing into a dancing doll . His name was Isidore Smythe ; and I can see him still , with his little dark face , just coming up to the counter , making a jumping kangaroo out of five cigars .
35312	35527	34909	34909	he	315	" The other fellow was more silent and more ordinary ; but somehow he alarmed me much more than poor little Smythe . He was very tall and slight , and light - haired ; his nose had a high bridge , and he might almost have been handsome in a spectral sort of way ; but he had one of the most appalling squints I have ever seen or heard of . When he looked straight at you , you did n't know where you were yourself , let alone what he was looking at . I fancy this sort of disfigurement embittered the poor chap a little ; for while Smythe was ready to show off his monkey tricks anywhere , James Welkin that was the squinting man 's name never did anything except soak in our bar parlour , and go for great walks by himself in the flat , grey country all round . All the same , I think Smythe , too , was a little sensitive about being so small , though he carried it off more smartly . And so it was that I was really puzzled , as well as startled , and very sorry , when they both offered to marry me in the same week .
35528	35678	34863	34863	Laura	178	" Well , I did what I 've since thought was perhaps a silly thing . But , after all , these freaks were my friends in a way ; and I had a horror of their thinking I refused them for the real reason , which was that they were so impossibly ugly . So I made up some gas of another sort , about never meaning to marry anyone who had n't carved his way in the world . I said it was a point of principle with me not to live on money that was just inherited like theirs . Two days after I had talked in this well - meaning sort of way , the whole trouble began . The first thing I heard was that both of them had gone off to seek their fortunes , as if they were in some silly fairy tale .
35679	35715	34909	34909	he	315	" Well , I 've never seen either of them from that day to this . But I 've had two letters from the little man called Smythe , and really they were rather exciting . "
35716	35724	35726	35726	Angus	181	" Ever heard of the other man ? "
35728	35735	35737	35738	the girl	825	" No , he never wrote , "
35746	35872	35737	35738	the girl	825	" Smythe 's first letter was simply to say that he had started out walking with Welkin to London ; but Welkin was such a good walker that the little man dropped out of it , and took a rest by the roadside . He happened to be picked up by some travelling show , and , partly because he was nearly a dwarf , and partly because he was really a clever little wretch , he got on quite well in the show business , and was soon sent up to the Aquarium , to do some tricks that I forget . That was his first letter . His second was much more of a startler , and I only got it last week . "
35904	36075	35901	35901	she	1524	" I suppose you 've seen on the hoardings all about this ` Smythe 's Silent Service ' ? Or you must be the only person that has n't . Oh , I do n't know much about it , it 's some clockwork invention for doing all the housework by machinery . You know the sort of thing : ` Press a Button - A Butler who Never Drinks . ' ` Turn a Handle - Ten Housemaids who Never Flirt . ' You must have seen the advertisements . Well , whatever these machines are , they are making pots of money ; and they are making it all for that little imp whom I knew down in Ludbury . I ca n't help feeling pleased the poor little chap has fallen on his feet ; but the plain fact is , I 'm in terror of his turning up any minute and telling me he 's carved his way in the world - as he certainly has . "
36076	36082	36084	36084	Angus	181	" And the other man ? "
36100	36104	36105	36105	she	178	" My friend , "
36108	36217	36105	36105	she	178	" I think you are a witch . Yes , you are quite right . I have not seen a line of the other man 's writing ; and I have no more notion than the dead of what or where he is . But it is of him that I am frightened . It is he who is all about my path . It is he who has half driven me mad . Indeed , I think he has driven me mad ; for I have felt him where he could not have been , and I have heard his voice when he could not have spoken . "
36218	36224	36226	36228	the young man	1294	" Well , my dear , "
36232	36272	36226	36228	the young man	1294	" if he were Satan himself , he is done for now you have told somebody . One goes mad all alone , old girl . But when was it you fancied you felt and heard our squinting friend ? "
36273	36287	36289	36290	the girl	825	" I heard James Welkin laugh as plainly as I hear you speak , "
36294	36367	36289	36290	the girl	825	" There was nobody there , for I stood just outside the shop at the corner , and could see down both streets at once . I had forgotten how he laughed , though his laugh was as odd as his squint . I had not thought of him for nearly a year . But it 's a solemn truth that a few seconds later the first letter came from his rival . "
36368	36382	36384	36384	Angus	181	" Did you ever make the spectre speak or squeak , or anything ? "
36403	36464	36390	36390	Laura	178	" Yes . Just when I had finished reading the second letter from Isidore Smythe announcing his success . Just then , I heard Welkin say , ` He sha n't have you , though . ' It was quite plain , as if he were in the room . It is awful , I think I must be mad . "
36465	36472	36474	36476	the young man	1294	" If you really were mad , "
36478	36547	36474	36476	the young man	1294	" you would think you must be sane . But certainly there seems to me to be something a little rum about this unseen gentleman . Two heads are better than one - I spare you allusions to any other organs and really , if you would allow me , as a sturdy , practical man , to bring back the wedding - cake out of the window - "
36787	36798	36765	36766	Mr. Smythe	186	" Has Miss Hope seen that thing on the window ? "
36799	36804	36806	36808	the staring Angus	1542	" On the window ? "
36810	36820	36822	36824	the small millionaire	1543	" There 's no time to explain other things , "
36827	36841	36822	36824	the small millionaire	1543	" There 's some tomfoolery going on here that has to be investigated . "
36938	36948	36909	36909	he	186	" If you marry Smythe , he will die . "
36949	36952	36954	36954	Angus	181	" Laura , "
36965	36971	36954	36954	Angus	181	" you 're not mad . "
36972	36982	36984	36984	Smythe	186	" It 's the writing of that fellow Welkin , "
36987	37075	36984	36984	Smythe	186	" I have n't seen him for years , but he 's always bothering me . Five times in the last fortnight he 's had threatening letters left at my flat , and I ca n't even find out who leaves them , let alone if it is Welkin himself . The porter of the flats swears that no suspicious characters have been seen , and here he has pasted up a sort of dado on a public shop window , while the people in the shop - "
37076	37080	37082	37082	Angus	181	" Quite so , "
37085	37268	37082	37082	Angus	181	" while the people in the shop were having tea . Well , sir , I can assure you I appreciate your common sense in dealing so directly with the matter . We can talk about other things afterwards . The fellow can not be very far off yet , for I swear there was no paper there when I went last to the window , ten or fifteen minutes ago . On the other hand , he 's too far off to be chased , as we do n't even know the direction . If you 'll take my advice , Mr. Smythe , you 'll put this at once in the hands of some energetic inquiry man , private rather than public . I know an extremely clever fellow , who has set up in business five minutes from here in your car . His name 's Flambeau , and though his youth was a bit stormy , he 's a strictly honest man now , and his brains are worth money . He lives in Lucknow Mansions , Hampstead . "
37269	37274	37276	37278	the little man	602	" That is odd , "
37285	37333	37281	37281	his	602	" I live , myself , in Himylaya Mansions , round the corner . Perhaps you might care to come with me ; I can go to my rooms and sort out these queer Welkin documents , while you run round and get your friend the detective . "
37334	37340	37342	37342	Angus	181	" You are very good , "
37345	37355	37342	37342	Angus	181	" Well , the sooner we act the better . "
37411	37417	37555	37555	Smythe	186	" Smythe 's Silent Service , "
37435	37443	37555	37555	Smythe	186	" A Cook Who is Never Cross . "
37444	37453	37455	37460	the little black - bearded man	1553	" I use them in my own flat , "
37464	37532	37455	37460	the little black - bearded man	1553	" partly for advertisements , and partly for real convenience . Honestly , and all above board , those big clockwork dolls of mine do bring your coals or claret or a timetable quicker than any live servants I 've ever known , if you know which knob to press . But I 'll never deny , between ourselves , that such servants have their disadvantages , too .
37533	37536	37538	37538	Angus	181	" Indeed ? "
37540	37549	37538	37538	Angus	181	" is there something they ca n't do ? "
37550	37553	37555	37555	Smythe	186	" Yes , "
37558	37573	37555	37555	Smythe	186	" they ca n't tell me who left those threatening letters at my flat . "
37995	38003	38005	38007	the breathless Smythe	186	" Just come in for a minute , "
38009	38031	38032	38032	He	186	" I want to show you those Welkin letters . Then you might run round the corner and fetch your friend . "
38284	38299	38407	38407	Smythe	182	" If you have been to see her today , I shall kill you . "
38313	38329	38308	38309	Isidore Smythe	182	" Would you like a little whiskey ? I rather feel as if I should . "
38330	38341	38343	38343	Angus	181	" Thank you ; I should like a little Flambeau , "
38347	38369	38343	38343	Angus	181	" This business seems to me to be getting rather grave . I 'm going round at once to fetch him . "
38370	38375	38377	38378	the other	482	" Right you are , "
38384	38395	38377	38378	the other	482	" Bring him round here as quick as you can . "
38670	38679	38680	38680	he	181	" Keep yourself warm on your own chestnuts , "
38684	38738	38680	38680	he	181	" Eat up your whole stock ; I 'll make it worth your while . I 'll give you a sovereign if you 'll wait here till I come back , and then tell me whether any man , woman , or child has gone into that house where the commissionaire is standing . "
38754	38766	38767	38767	he	181	" I 've made a ring round that room , anyhow , "
38770	38784	38767	38767	he	181	" They ca n't all four of them be Mr. Welkin 's accomplices . "
38916	38924	38926	38926	Flambeau	111	" This is my friend Father Brown , "
38928	38951	38926	38926	Flambeau	111	" I 've often wanted you to meet him . Splendid weather , this ; a little cold for Southerners like me . "
38952	38962	38964	38964	Angus	181	" Yes , I think it will keep clear , "
38976	38979	38981	38982	the priest	374	" No , "
38985	38992	38981	38982	the priest	374	" it has begun to snow . "
39021	39024	39026	39026	Angus	181	" Well , "
39029	39089	39026	39026	Angus	181	" I 'm afraid I 've come on business , and rather jumpy business at that . The fact is , Flambeau , within a stone 's throw of your house is a fellow who badly wants your help ; he 's perpetually being haunted and threatened by an invisible enemy - a scoundrel whom nobody has even seen . "
39190	39197	39198	39198	he	111	" If you do n't mind , "
39201	39236	39198	39198	he	111	" I think you had better tell me the rest on the nearest road to this man 's house . It strikes me , somehow , that there is no time to be lost . "
39237	39240	39242	39242	Angus	181	" Delighted , "
39247	39272	39242	39242	Angus	181	" though he 's safe enough for the present , for I 've set four men to watch the only hole to his burrow . "
39308	39319	39294	39294	He	1629	" How quick the snow gets thick on the ground . "
39472	39494	39496	39502	the genial and gold - laced giant	1643	" I 've got a right to ask any man , duke or dustman , what he wants in these flats , "
39504	39521	39496	39502	the genial and gold - laced giant	1643	" and I 'll swear there 's been nobody to ask since this gentleman went away . "
39543	39572	39524	39525	Father Brown	121	" Has nobody been up and down stairs , then , since the snow began to fall ? It began while we were all round at Flambeau 's . "
39573	39589	39591	39592	the official	1646	" Nobody 's been in here , sir , you can take it from me , "
39598	39606	39608	39609	the priest	374	" Then I wonder what that is ? "
39683	39686	39688	39688	Angus	181	" God ! "
39691	39696	39688	39688	Angus	181	" the Invisible Man ! "
39924	39927	39921	39921	Flambeau	111	" Murder ! "
39996	40000	40002	40002	Flambeau	111	" My friend , "
40010	40027	40002	40002	Flambeau	111	" not only is your murderer invisible , but he makes invisible also the murdered man . "
40141	40145	40136	40136	they	1666	" Eaten him ? "
40191	40224	40176	40176	He	181	" Well , there it is . The poor fellow has evaporated like a cloud and left a red streak on the floor . The tale does not belong to this world . "
40225	40235	40237	40237	Flambeau	111	" There is only one thing to be done , "
40239	40260	40237	40237	Flambeau	111	" whether it belongs to this world or the other . I must go down and talk to my friend . "
40321	40327	40308	40308	he	181	" Where is the policeman ? "
40328	40334	40336	40337	Father Brown	121	" I beg your pardon , "
40339	40363	40336	40337	Father Brown	121	" that is my fault . I just sent him down the road to investigate something - that I just thought worth investigating . "
40364	40374	40376	40376	Angus	181	" Well , we want him back pretty soon , "
40379	40395	40376	40376	Angus	181	" for the wretched man upstairs has not only been murdered , but wiped out . "
40396	40399	40401	40402	the priest	374	" How ? "
40404	40407	40409	40409	Flambeau	111	" Father , "
40415	40459	40409	40409	Flambeau	111	" upon my soul I believe it is more in your department than mine . No friend or foe has entered the house , but Smythe is gone , as if stolen by the fairies . If that is not supernatural , I - "
40493	40500	40501	40501	he	1675	" You 're right , sir , "
40504	40520	40501	40501	he	1675	" they 've just found poor Mr. Smythe 's body in the canal down below . "
40530	40539	40540	40540	he	181	" Did he run down and drown himself ? "
40543	40553	40555	40556	the constable	1677	" He never came down , I 'll swear , "
40558	40577	40555	40556	the constable	1677	" and he was n't drowned either , for he died of a great stab over the heart . "
40578	40587	40589	40589	Flambeau	111	" And yet you saw no one enter ? "
40595	40605	40607	40608	the priest	374	" Let us walk down the road a little , "
40623	40646	40619	40619	he	374	" Stupid of me ! I forgot to ask the policeman something . I wonder if they found a light brown sack . "
40647	40654	40656	40656	Angus	181	" Why a light brown sack ? "
40660	40677	40679	40680	Father Brown	121	" Because if it was any other coloured sack , the case must begin over again , "
40682	40699	40679	40680	Father Brown	121	" but if it was a light brown sack , why , the case is finished . "
40700	40708	40710	40710	Angus	181	" I am pleased to hear it , "
40715	40728	40710	40710	Angus	181	" It has n't begun , so far as I am concerned . "
40729	40738	40740	40740	Flambeau	111	" You must tell us all about it , "
40792	40824	40784	40784	he	121	" Well , I 'm afraid you 'll think it so prosy . We always begin at the abstract end of things , and you ca n't begin this story anywhere else .
40825	41050	40784	40784	he	121	" Have you ever noticed this - that people never answer what you say ? They answer what you mean - or what they think you mean . Suppose one lady says to another in a country house , ` Is anybody staying with you ? ' the lady does n't answer ` Yes ; the butler , the three footmen , the parlourmaid , and so on , ' though the parlourmaid may be in the room , or the butler behind her chair . She says ` There is nobody staying with us , ' meaning nobody of the sort you mean . But suppose a doctor inquiring into an epidemic asks , ` Who is staying in the house ? ' then the lady will remember the butler , the parlourmaid , and the rest . All language is used like that ; you never get a question answered literally , even when you get it answered truly . When those four quite honest men said that no man had gone into the Mansions , they did not really mean that no man had gone into them . They meant no man whom they could suspect of being your man . A man did go into the house , and did come out of it , but they never noticed him . "
41051	41056	41058	41058	Angus	181	" An invisible man ? "
41065	41071	41073	41074	Father Brown	121	" A mentally invisible man , "
41096	41201	41202	41202	he	181	" Of course you ca n't think of such a man , until you do think of him . That 's where his cleverness comes in . But I came to think of him through two or three little things in the tale Mr. Angus told us . First , there was the fact that this Welkin went for long walks . And then there was the vast lot of stamp paper on the window . And then , most of all , there were the two things the young lady said - things that could n't be true . Do n't get annoyed , "
41273	41273	41267	41267	he	1690	"
41274	41283	41285	41285	Angus	181	" Why must there be somebody near her ? "
41287	41290	41292	41293	Father Brown	121	" Because , "
41295	41309	41292	41293	Father Brown	121	" barring carrier - pigeons , somebody must have brought her the letter . "
41310	41318	41320	41320	Flambeau	111	" Do you really mean to say , "
41325	41337	41320	41320	Flambeau	111	" that Welkin carried his rival 's letters to his lady ? "
41338	41341	41343	41344	the priest	374	" Yes , "
41346	41364	41343	41344	the priest	374	" Welkin carried his rival 's letters to his lady . You see , he had to . "
41365	41377	41379	41379	Flambeau	111	" Oh , I ca n't stand much more of this , "
41381	41406	41379	41379	Flambeau	111	" Who is this fellow ? What does he look like ? What is the usual get - up of a mentally invisible man ? "
41407	41420	41422	41423	the priest	374	" He is dressed rather handsomely in red , blue and gold , "
41428	41470	41422	41423	the priest	374	" and in this striking , and even showy , costume he entered Himylaya Mansions under eight human eyes ; he killed Smythe in cold blood , and came down into the street again carrying the dead body in his arms - "
41471	41475	41477	41477	Angus	181	" Reverend sir , "
41482	41492	41477	41477	Angus	181	" are you raving mad , or am I ? "
41493	41499	41501	41501	Brown	121	" You are not mad , "
41503	41522	41501	41501	Brown	121	" only a little unobservant . You have not noticed such a man as this , for example . "
41555	41562	41563	41563	he	121	" Nobody ever notices postmen somehow , "
41567	41591	41563	41563	he	121	" yet they have passions like other men , and even carry large bags where a small corpse can be stowed quite easily . "
42553	42555	42561	42561	he	121	" blacks "
42766	42778	42779	42779	he	121	" You seem to have a sort of geological museum here , "
42803	42809	42811	42811	Flambeau	111	" Not a geological museum , "
42819	42819	42811	42811	Flambeau	111	"
42820	42829	42831	42833	the police detective	1783	" Oh , for the Lord 's sake , "
42836	42847	42831	42833	the police detective	1783	" do n't let 's begin with such long words . "
42848	42857	42859	42859	Flambeau	111	" Do n't you know what psychology means ? "
42864	42872	42859	42859	Flambeau	111	" Psychology means being off your chump . "
42873	42879	42881	42882	the official	1646	" Still I hardly follow , "
42884	42887	42889	42889	Flambeau	111	" Well , "
42894	42914	42889	42889	Flambeau	111	" I mean that we 've only found out one thing about Lord Glengyle . He was a maniac . "
42946	42989	42937	42938	Father Brown	121	" I can understand there must have been something odd about the man , or he would n't have buried himself alive - nor been in such a hurry to bury himself dead . But what makes you think it was lunacy ? "
42990	42993	42995	42995	Flambeau	111	" Well , "
42997	43014	42995	42995	Flambeau	111	" you just listen to the list of things Mr. Craven has found in the house . "
43015	43022	43024	43024	Craven	196	" We must get a candle , "
43028	43043	43024	43024	Craven	196	" A storm is getting up , and it 's too dark to read . "
43044	43051	43053	43053	Brown	121	" Have you found any candles , "
43056	43061	43053	43053	Brown	121	" among your oddities ? "
43077	43084	43085	43085	he	111	" That is curious , too , "
43088	43102	43085	43085	he	111	" Twenty - five candles , and not a trace of a candlestick . "
43156	43159	43160	43160	he	121	" Hullo ! "
43166	43166	43160	43160	he	121	"
43237	43244	43246	43246	Craven	196	" I will read the inventory , "
43256	43315	43246	43246	Craven	196	" the inventory of what we found loose and unexplained in the castle . You are to understand that the place generally was dismantled and neglected ; but one or two rooms had plainly been inhabited in a simple but not squalid style by somebody ; somebody who was not the servant Gow . The list is as follows :
43316	43389	43246	43246	Craven	196	" First item . A very considerable hoard of precious stones , nearly all diamonds , and all of them loose , without any setting whatever . Of course , it is natural that the Ogilvies should have family jewels ; but those are exactly the jewels that are almost always set in particular articles of ornament . The Ogilvies would seem to have kept theirs loose in their pockets , like coppers .
43390	43451	43246	43246	Craven	196	" Second item . Heaps and heaps of loose snuff , not kept in a horn , or even a pouch , but lying in heaps on the mantelpieces , on the sideboard , on the piano , anywhere . It looks as if the old gentleman would not take the trouble to look in a pocket or lift a lid .
43452	43492	43246	43246	Craven	196	" Third item . Here and there about the house curious little heaps of minute pieces of metal , some like steel springs and some in the form of microscopic wheels . As if they had gutted some mechanical toy .
43493	43728	43246	43246	Craven	196	" Fourth item . The wax candles , which have to be stuck in bottle necks because there is nothing else to stick them in . Now I wish you to note how very much queerer all this is than anything we anticipated . For the central riddle we are prepared ; we have all seen at a glance that there was something wrong about the last earl . We have come here to find out whether he really lived here , whether he really died here , whether that red - haired scarecrow who did his burying had anything to do with his dying . But suppose the worst in all this , the most lurid or melodramatic solution you like . Suppose the servant really killed the master , or suppose the master is n't really dead , or suppose the master is dressed up as the servant , or suppose the servant is buried for the master ; invent what Wilkie Collins ' tragedy you like , and you still have not explained a candle without a candlestick , or why an elderly gentleman of good family should habitually spill snuff on the piano . The core of the tale we could imagine ; it is the fringes that are mysterious . By no stretch of fancy can the human mind connect together snuff and diamonds and wax and loose clockwork . "
43729	43737	43739	43740	the priest	374	" I think I see the connection , "
43742	43823	43739	43740	the priest	374	" This Glengyle was mad against the French Revolution . He was an enthusiast for the ancien regime , and was trying to re - enact literally the family life of the last Bourbons . He had snuff because it was the eighteenth century luxury ; wax candles , because they were the eighteenth century lighting ; the mechanical bits of iron represent the locksmith hobby of Louis XVI ; the diamonds are for the Diamond Necklace of Marie Antoinette . "
43836	43843	43845	43845	Flambeau	111	" What a perfectly extraordinary notion ! "
43847	43857	43845	43845	Flambeau	111	" Do you really think that is the truth ? "
43858	43867	43869	43870	Father Brown	121	" I am perfectly sure it is n't , "
43872	43909	43869	43870	Father Brown	121	" only you said that nobody could connect snuff and diamonds and clockwork and candles . I give you that connection off - hand . The real truth , I am very sure , lies deeper . "
43930	44049	43927	43927	he	121	" The late Earl of Glengyle was a thief . He lived a second and darker life as a desperate housebreaker . He did not have any candlesticks because he only used these candles cut short in the little lantern he carried . The snuff he employed as the fiercest French criminals have used pepper : to fling it suddenly in dense masses in the face of a captor or pursuer . But the final proof is in the curious coincidence of the diamonds and the small steel wheels . Surely that makes everything plain to you ? Diamonds and small steel wheels are the only two instruments with which you can cut out a pane of glass . "
44091	44097	44099	44099	Craven	196	" Diamonds and small wheels , "
44102	44115	44099	44099	Craven	196	" Is that all that makes you think it the true explanation ? "
44116	44126	44128	44129	the priest	374	" I do n't think it the true explanation , "
44132	44277	44128	44129	the priest	374	" but you said that nobody could connect the four things . The true tale , of course , is something much more humdrum . Glengyle had found , or thought he had found , precious stones on his estate . Somebody had bamboozled him with those loose brilliants , saying they were found in the castle caverns . The little wheels are some diamond - cutting affair . He had to do the thing very roughly and in a small way , with the help of a few shepherds or rude fellows on these hills . Snuff is the one great luxury of such Scotch shepherds ; it 's the one thing with which you can bribe them . They did n't have candlesticks because they did n't want them ; they held the candles in their hands when they explored the caves . "
44278	44283	44285	44285	Flambeau	111	" Is that all ? "
44291	44302	44285	44285	Flambeau	111	" Have we got to the dull truth at last ? "
44303	44308	44310	44311	Father Brown	121	" Oh , no , "
44342	44400	44330	44331	Father Brown	121	" I only suggested that because you said one could not plausibly connect snuff with clockwork or candles with bright stones . Ten false philosophies will fit the universe ; ten false theories will fit Glengyle Castle . But we want the real explanation of the castle and the universe . But are there no other exhibits ? "
44418	44429	44430	44430	he	111	" Items five , six , seven , etc . , "
44433	44540	44430	44430	he	111	" and certainly more varied than instructive . A curious collection , not of lead pencils , but of the lead out of lead pencils . A senseless stick of bamboo , with the top rather splintered . It might be the instrument of the crime . Only , there is n't any crime . The only other things are a few old missals and little Catholic pictures , which the Ogilvies kept , I suppose , from the Middle Ages - their family pride being stronger than their Puritanism . We only put them in the museum because they seem curiously cut about and defaced . "
44594	44598	44600	44600	he	121	" Mr. Craven , "
44610	44657	44600	44600	he	121	" you have got a legal warrant , have n't you , to go up and examine that grave ? The sooner we do it the better , and get to the bottom of this horrible affair . If I were you I should start now . "
44658	44661	44663	44665	the astonished detective	1798	" Now , "
44667	44672	44663	44665	the astonished detective	1798	" and why now ? "
44673	44679	44681	44681	Brown	121	" Because this is serious , "
44683	44833	44681	44681	Brown	121	" this is not spilt snuff or loose pebbles , that might be there for a hundred reasons . There is only one reason I know of for this being done ; and the reason goes down to the roots of the world . These religious pictures are not just dirtied or torn or scrawled over , which might be done in idleness or bigotry , by children or by Protestants . These have been treated very carefully - and very queerly . In every place where the great ornamented name of God comes in the old illuminations it has been elaborately taken out . The only other thing that has been removed is the halo round the head of the Child Jesus . Therefore , I say , let us get our warrant and our spade and our hatchet , and go up and break open that coffin . "
44834	44840	44842	44844	the London officer	1799	" What do you mean ? "
44846	44850	44852	44854	the little priest	363	" I mean , "
44870	44918	44857	44857	his	363	" I mean that the great devil of the universe may be sitting on the top tower of this castle at this moment , as big as a hundred elephants , and roaring like the Apocalypse . There is black magic somewhere at the bottom of this . "
44919	44923	44932	44932	he	111	" Black magic , "
44945	44954	44932	44932	he	111	" but what can these other things mean ? "
44955	44964	44966	44966	Brown	121	" Oh , something damnable , I suppose , "
44969	45031	44966	44966	Brown	121	" How should I know ? How can I guess all their mazes down below ? Perhaps you can make a torture out of snuff and bamboo . Perhaps lunatics lust after wax and steel filings . Perhaps there is a maddening drug made of lead pencils ! Our shortest cut to the mystery is up the hill to the grave . "
45270	45274	45276	45277	Father Brown	121	" You see , "
45284	45319	45320	45320	he	121	" Scotch people before Scotland existed were a curious lot . In fact , they 're a curious lot still . But in the prehistoric times I fancy they really worshipped demons . That , "
45324	45334	45320	45320	he	121	" is why they jumped at the Puritan theology . "
45335	45339	45341	45341	Flambeau	111	" My friend , "
45350	45358	45341	45341	Flambeau	111	" what does all that snuff mean ? "
45359	45363	45365	45365	Brown	121	" My friend , "
45371	45394	45365	45365	Brown	121	" there is one mark of all genuine religions : materialism . Now , devil - worship is a perfectly genuine religion . "
45566	45570	45572	45573	the priest	374	" Go on , "
45577	45593	45572	45573	the priest	374	" We are only trying to find the truth . What are you afraid of ? "
45594	45602	45604	45604	Flambeau	111	" I am afraid of finding it , "
45625	45648	45606	45608	The London detective	1825	" I wonder why he really did hide himself like that . Something nasty , I suppose ; was he a leper ? "
45649	45655	45657	45657	Flambeau	111	" Something worse than that , "
45659	45666	45668	45669	the other	482	" And what do you imagine , "
45671	45679	45668	45669	the other	482	" would be worse than a leper ? "
45680	45687	45689	45689	Flambeau	111	" I do n't imagine it , "
45708	45720	45691	45691	He	111	" I 'm afraid of his not being the right shape . "
45721	45732	45734	45735	Father Brown	121	" Nor was that piece of paper , you know , "
45738	45748	45734	45735	Father Brown	121	" and we survived even that piece of paper . "
45855	45858	45860	45860	Craven	195	" Bones , "
45867	45874	45864	45864	he	195	" but it is a man , "
45882	45886	45888	45888	Flambeau	111	" Is he , "
45899	45905	45888	45888	Flambeau	111	" is he all right ? "
45906	45910	45912	45913	the officer	1828	" Seems so , "
45927	45932	45912	45913	the officer	1828	" Wait a minute . "
45943	45953	45954	45954	he	111	" And now I come to think of it , "
45957	46032	45954	45954	he	111	" why in the name of madness should n't he be all right ? What is it gets hold of a man on these cursed cold mountains ? I think it 's the black , brainless repetition ; all these forests , and over all an ancient horror of unconsciousness . It 's like the dream of an atheist . Pine - trees and more pine - trees and millions more pine - trees - "
46033	46036	46038	46042	the man by the coffin	1829	" God ! "
46044	46053	46038	46042	the man by the coffin	1829	" but he has n't got a head . "
46074	46078	46079	46079	he	374	" No head ! "
46082	46086	46079	46079	he	374	" No head ? "
46194	46201	46203	46204	Father Brown	121	" There are three headless men , "
46213	46213	46203	46204	Father Brown	121	"
46265	46268	46270	46270	Flambeau	111	" Father , "
46282	46289	46270	46270	Flambeau	111	" what are we to do ? "
46305	46308	46310	46311	Father Brown	121	" Sleep ! "
46313	46397	46310	46311	Father Brown	121	" Sleep . We have come to the end of the ways . Do you know what sleep is ? Do you know that every man who sleeps believes in God ? It is a sacrament ; for it is an act of faith and it is a food . And we need a sacrament , if only a natural one . Something has fallen on us that falls very seldom on men ; perhaps the worst thing that can fall on them . "
46407	46413	46398	46398	Craven	195	" What do you mean ? "
46427	46441	46424	46424	he	374	" We have found the truth ; and the truth makes no sense . "
46585	46594	46596	46597	Father Brown	121	" He 's a valuable man , that , "
46599	46608	46609	46609	he	121	" He does the potatoes amazingly . Still , "
46617	46643	46609	46609	he	121	" he has his faults ; which of us has n't ? He does n't dig this bank quite regularly . There , for instance , "
46652	46662	46609	46609	he	121	" I 'm really very doubtful about that potato . "
46663	46667	46669	46669	Craven	195	" And why ? "
46679	46686	46688	46689	the other	482	" I 'm doubtful about it , "
46691	46724	46688	46689	the other	482	" because old Gow was doubtful about it himself . He put his spade in methodically in every place but just this . There must be a mighty fine potato just here . "
46791	46797	46799	46799	Brown	121	" The Earl of Glengyle , "
46827	46834	46817	46817	he	121	" We must hide it again , "
46880	46887	46888	46888	he	121	" If one could only conceive , "
46891	46899	46888	46888	he	121	" the meaning of this last monstrosity . "
46965	46974	46976	46976	Flambeau	111	" Well , I give it all up , "
46981	47016	46976	46976	Flambeau	111	" My brain and this world do n't fit each other ; and there 's an end of it . Snuff , spoilt Prayer Books , and the insides of musical boxes - what - "
47037	47048	47049	47049	he	121	" Oh , tut , tut , tut , tut ! "
47052	47186	47049	47049	he	121	" All that is as plain as a pikestaff . I understood the snuff and clockwork , and so on , when I first opened my eyes this morning . And since then I 've had it out with old Gow , the gardener , who is neither so deaf nor so stupid as he pretends . There 's nothing amiss about the loose items . I was wrong about the torn mass - book , too ; there 's no harm in that . But it 's this last business . Desecrating graves and stealing dead men 's heads - surely there 's harm in that ? Surely there 's black magic still in that ? That does n't fit in to the quite simple story of the snuff and the candles . "
47197	47201	47203	47203	Flambeau	111	" My friend , "
47210	47308	47203	47203	Flambeau	111	" you must be careful with me and remember I was once a criminal . The great advantage of that estate was that I always made up the story myself , and acted it as quick as I chose . This detective business of waiting about is too much for my French impatience . All my life , for good or evil , I have done things at the instant ; I always fought duels the next morning ; I always paid bills on the nail ; I never even put off a visit to the dentist - "
47341	47350	47351	47351	he	121	" Lord , what a turnip I am ! "
47355	47362	47351	47351	he	121	" Lord , what a turnip ! "
47378	47382	47383	47383	he	121	" The dentist ! "
47386	47448	47383	47383	he	121	" Six hours in the spiritual abyss , and all because I never thought of the dentist ! Such a simple , such a beautiful and peaceful thought ! Friends , we have passed a night in hell ; but now the sun is risen , the birds are singing , and the radiant form of the dentist consoles the world . "
47449	47459	47461	47461	Flambeau	111	" I will get some sense out of this , "
47466	47476	47461	47461	Flambeau	111	" if I use the tortures of the Inquisition . "
47503	47552	47500	47501	a child	890	" Oh , let me be silly a little . You do n't know how unhappy I have been . And now I know that there has been no deep sin in this business at all . Only a little lunacy , perhaps - and who minds that ? "
47565	47574	47575	47575	he	121	" This is not a story of crime , "
47578	47629	47575	47575	he	121	" rather it is the story of a strange and crooked honesty . We are dealing with the one man on earth , perhaps , who has taken no more than his due . It is a study in the savage living logic that has been the religion of this race .
47630	47806	47500	47501	a child	890	" That old local rhyme about the house of Glengyle - As green sap to the simmer trees Is red gold to the Ogilvies - was literal as well as metaphorical . It did not merely mean that the Glengyles sought for wealth ; it was also true that they literally gathered gold ; they had a huge collection of ornaments and utensils in that metal . They were , in fact , misers whose mania took that turn . In the light of that fact , run through all the things we found in the castle . Diamonds without their gold rings ; candles without their gold candlesticks ; snuff without the gold snuff - boxes ; pencil - leads without the gold pencil - cases ; a walking stick without its gold top ; clockwork without the gold clocks - or rather watches . And , mad as it sounds , because the halos and the name of God in the old missals were of real gold ; these also were taken away . "
47840	47845	47847	47848	Father Brown	121	" Were taken away , "
47850	47927	47847	47848	Father Brown	121	" were taken away - but not stolen . Thieves would never have left this mystery . Thieves would have taken the gold snuff - boxes , snuff and all ; the gold pencil - cases , lead and all . We have to deal with a man with a peculiar conscience , but certainly a conscience . I found that mad moralist this morning in the kitchen garden yonder , and I heard the whole story .
47928	48199	47500	47501	a child	890	" The late Archibald Ogilvie was the nearest approach to a good man ever born at Glengyle . But his bitter virtue took the turn of the misanthrope ; he moped over the dishonesty of his ancestors , from which , somehow , he generalised a dishonesty of all men . More especially he distrusted philanthropy or free - giving ; and he swore if he could find one man who took his exact rights he should have all the gold of Glengyle . Having delivered this defiance to humanity he shut himself up , without the smallest expectation of its being answered . One day , however , a deaf and seemingly senseless lad from a distant village brought him a belated telegram ; and Glengyle , in his acrid pleasantry , gave him a new farthing . At least he thought he had done so , but when he turned over his change he found the new farthing still there and a sovereign gone . The accident offered him vistas of sneering speculation . Either way , the boy would show the greasy greed of the species . Either he would vanish , a thief stealing a coin ; or he would sneak back with it virtuously , a snob seeking a reward . In the middle of that night Lord Glengyle was knocked up out of his bed - for he lived alone - and forced to open the door to the deaf idiot . The idiot brought with him , not the sovereign , but exactly nineteen shillings and eleven - pence three - farthings in change .
48200	48416	47847	47848	Father Brown	121	" Then the wild exactitude of this action took hold of the mad lord 's brain like fire . He swore he was Diogenes , that had long sought an honest man , and at last had found one . He made a new will , which I have seen . He took the literal youth into his huge , neglected house , and trained him up as his solitary servant and - after an odd manner - his heir . And whatever that queer creature understands , he understood absolutely his lord 's two fixed ideas : first , that the letter of right is everything ; and second , that he himself was to have the gold of Glengyle . So far , that is all ; and that is simple . He has stripped the house of gold , and taken not a grain that was not gold ; not so much as a grain of snuff . He lifted the gold leaf off an old illumination , fully satisfied that he left the rest unspoilt . All that I understood ; but I could not understand this skull business . I was really uneasy about that human head buried among the potatoes . It distressed me - till Flambeau said the word .
48417	48445	47500	47501	a child	890	" It will be all right . He will put the skull back in the grave , when he has taken the gold out of the tooth . "
49751	49755	49756	49756	he	1945	" I say , "
49760	49777	49756	49756	he	1945	" I want to see old Quinton . I must see him . Has he gone ? "
49778	49787	49789	49790	Father Brown	121	" Mr. Quinton is in , I believe , "
49796	49816	49789	49790	Father Brown	121	" but I do not know if you can see him . The doctor is with him at present . "
49859	49864	49866	49867	the doctor	696	" See Mr. Quinton ? "
49870	49904	49866	49867	the doctor	696	" No , I 'm afraid you ca n't . In fact , you must n't on any account . Nobody must see him ; I 've just given him his sleeping draught . "
49905	49915	49917	49922	the youth in the red tie	1952	" No , but look here , old chap , "
49937	49953	49917	49922	the youth in the red tie	1952	" Look here . I 'm simply sewn up , I tell you . I - "
49954	49963	49965	49966	the doctor	696	" It 's no good , Mr. Atkinson , "
49974	49990	49965	49966	the doctor	696	" when you can alter the effects of a drug I 'll alter my decision , "
50097	50110	50112	50114	the medical man	1961	" That was a sound , spanking lie I told just now , "
50118	50194	50112	50114	the medical man	1961	" In point of fact , poor Quinton does n't have his sleeping draught for nearly half an hour . But I 'm not going to have him bothered with that little beast , who only wants to borrow money that he would n't pay back if he could . He 's a dirty little scamp , though he is Mrs. Quinton 's brother , and she 's as fine a woman as ever walked . "
50195	50198	50200	50201	Father Brown	121	" Yes , "
50203	50210	50200	50201	Father Brown	121	" She 's a good woman . "
50211	50227	50230	50231	the doctor	696	" So I propose to hang about the garden till the creature has cleared off , "
50233	50258	50230	50231	the doctor	696	" and then I 'll go in to Quinton with the medicine . Atkinson ca n't get in , because I locked the door . "
50259	50267	50269	50269	Flambeau	111	" In that case , Dr. Harris , "
50271	50308	50269	50269	Flambeau	111	" we might as well walk round at the back by the end of the conservatory . There 's no entrance to it that way , but it 's worth seeing , even from the outside . "
50309	50322	50324	50325	the doctor	696	" Yes , and I might get a squint at my patient , "
50327	50364	50324	50325	the doctor	696	" for he prefers to lie on an ottoman right at the end of the conservatory amid all those blood - red poinsettias ; it would give me the creeps . But what are you doing ? "
50405	50410	50412	50413	Father Brown	121	" What is this ? "
50421	50430	50432	50433	Dr. Harris	211	" Oh , Quinton 's , I suppose , "
50436	50465	50432	50433	Dr. Harris	211	" he has all sorts of Chinese knickknacks about the place . Or perhaps it belongs to that mild Hindoo of his whom he keeps on a string . "
50466	50470	50472	50473	Father Brown	121	" What Hindoo ? "
50484	50491	50493	50494	the doctor	696	" Oh , some Indian conjuror , "
50497	50504	50493	50494	the doctor	696	" a fraud , of course . "
50505	50513	50515	50516	Father Brown	121	" You do n't believe in magic ? "
50522	50528	50530	50531	the doctor	696	" O crickey ! magic ! "
50533	50539	50541	50548	the priest in a low , dreaming voice	1966	" It 's very beautiful , "
50550	50564	50541	50548	the priest in a low , dreaming voice	1966	" the colours are very beautiful . But it 's the wrong shape . "
50565	50569	50571	50571	Flambeau	111	" What for ? "
50575	50627	50541	50548	the priest in a low , dreaming voice	1966	" For anything . It 's the wrong shape in the abstract . Do n't you ever feel that about Eastern art ? The colours are intoxicatingly lovely ; but the shapes are mean and bad - deliberately mean and bad . I have seen wicked things in a Turkey carpet . "
50628	50632	50634	50634	Flambeau	111	" Mon Dieu ! "
50638	50661	50664	50665	the priest	374	" They are letters and symbols in a language I do n't know ; but I know they stand for evil words , "
50674	50688	50664	50665	the priest	374	" The lines go wrong on purpose - like serpents doubling to escape . "
50689	50698	50700	50701	the doctor	696	" What the devil are you talking about ? "
50715	50727	50728	50728	he	111	" The Father sometimes gets this mystic 's cloud on him , "
50731	50756	50728	50728	he	111	" but I give you fair warning that I have never known him to have it except when there was some evil quite near . "
50757	50762	50764	50765	the scientist	1969	" Oh , rats ! "
50767	50774	50776	50777	Father Brown	121	" Why , look at it , "
50797	50853	50776	50777	Father Brown	121	" Do n't you see it is the wrong shape ? Do n't you see that it has no hearty and plain purpose ? It does not point like a spear . It does not sweep like a scythe . It does not look like a weapon . It looks like an instrument of torture . "
50854	50866	50868	50870	the jolly Harris	211	" Well , as you do n't seem to like it , "
50872	50907	50868	50870	the jolly Harris	211	" it had better be taken back to its owner . Have n't we come to the end of this confounded conservatory yet ? This house is the wrong shape , if you like . "
50908	50914	50916	50917	Father Brown	121	" You do n't understand , "
50923	50945	50920	50920	his	121	" The shape of this house is quaint - it is even laughable . But there is nothing wrong about it . "
51185	51190	51192	51193	Father Brown	121	" Who is that ? "
51205	51215	51217	51217	Harris	211	" Oh , it is only that Hindoo humbug , "
51219	51233	51217	51217	Harris	211	" but I do n't know what the deuce he 's doing here . "
51234	51240	51242	51242	Flambeau	111	" It looks like hypnotism , "
51249	51261	51263	51264	the doctor	696	" Why are you unmedical fellows always talking bosh about hypnotism ? "
51266	51275	51263	51264	the doctor	696	" It looks a deal more like burglary . "
51276	51289	51291	51291	Flambeau	111	" Well , we will speak to it , at any rate , "
51331	51342	51325	51325	he	111	" Good evening , sir . Do you want anything ? "
51387	51391	51422	51422	he	111	" Thank you , "
51399	51404	51422	51422	he	111	" I want nothing . "
51425	51430	51422	51422	he	111	" I want nothing . "
51444	51449	51432	51432	he	111	" I want nothing , "
51460	51467	51469	51470	Father Brown	121	" The Christian is more modest , "
51472	51477	51469	51470	Father Brown	121	" he wants something . "
51478	51486	51496	51496	his	111	" What on earth was he doing ? "
51499	51509	51511	51512	Father Brown	121	" I should like to talk to you later , "
51681	51688	51691	51691	she	210	" Good evening , Dr. Harris , "
51694	51701	51703	51705	the little doctor	1991	" Good evening , Mrs. Quinton , "
51708	51721	51703	51705	the little doctor	1991	" I am just going to give your husband his sleeping draught . "
51722	51725	51726	51726	she	210	" Yes , "
51733	51741	51726	51726	she	210	" I think it is quite time . "
51755	51763	51765	51766	Father Brown	121	" That woman 's over - driven , "
51768	51789	51765	51766	Father Brown	121	" that 's the kind of woman that does her duty for twenty years , and then does something dreadful . "
51806	51813	51814	51814	he	1991	" Did you ever study medicine ? "
51817	51832	51834	51835	the priest	374	" You have to know something of the mind as well as the body , "
51837	51852	51834	51835	the priest	374	" we have to know something of the body as well as the mind . "
51853	51856	51858	51859	the doctor	696	" Well , "
51861	51873	51858	51859	the doctor	696	" I think I 'll go and give Quinton his stuff . "
52041	52066	52034	52034	he	696	" I must lock the door again , or this rat will get in . But I shall be out again in two minutes . "
52161	52172	52145	52145	He	209	" Oh , I say , Quinton , I want - "
52199	52225	52185	52185	Quinton	210	" Oh , I know what you want . Take it , and leave me in peace . I 'm writing a song about peacocks . "
52251	52257	52259	52260	the doctor	696	" So that 's settled , "
52278	52288	52289	52289	he	696	" Poor Leonard can get a little peace now , "
52295	52309	52289	52289	he	696	" he 's locked in all by himself for an hour or two . "
52310	52313	52315	52316	the priest	374	" Yes , "
52318	52330	52315	52316	the priest	374	" and his voice sounded jolly enough when we left him . "
52392	52398	52388	52388	he	374	" Where is Mrs. Quinton ! "
52399	52408	52410	52411	the doctor	696	" She has gone up to her room , "
52413	52422	52410	52411	the doctor	696	" That is her shadow on the blind . "
52441	52444	52445	52445	he	121	" Yes , "
52448	52454	52456	52456	he	121	" that is her shadow , "
52510	52514	52516	52516	Flambeau	111	" My father , "
52520	52528	52516	52516	Flambeau	111	" what is the matter with you ? "
52544	52572	52541	52541	he	121	" Superstition is irreligious , but there is something in the air of this place . I think it 's that Indian - at least , partly . "
52752	52760	52763	52763	Brown	121	" When that Indian spoke to us , "
52769	52923	52763	52763	Brown	121	" I had a sort of vision , a vision of him and all his universe . Yet he only said the same thing three times . When first he said ` I want nothing , ' it meant only that he was impenetrable , that Asia does not give itself away . Then he said again , ` I want nothing , ' and I knew that he meant that he was sufficient to himself , like a cosmos , that he needed no God , neither admitted any sins . And when he said the third time , ` I want nothing , ' he said it with blazing eyes . And I knew that he meant literally what he said ; that nothing was his desire and his home ; that he was weary for nothing as for wine ; that annihilation , the mere destruction of everything or anything - "
53008	53012	53013	53013	he	209	" Foul play ! "
53016	53028	53013	53013	he	209	" what have you been doing to him , you dog ? "
53047	53051	53052	53052	he	374	" No fighting , "
53056	53074	53052	53052	he	374	" we are enough to hold anyone we want to . What is the matter , doctor ? "
53075	53083	53085	53086	the doctor	696	" Things are not right with Quinton , "
53091	53122	53085	53086	the doctor	696	" I could just see him through the glass , and I do n't like the way he 's lying . It 's not as I left him , anyhow . "
53123	53131	53133	53134	Father Brown	121	" Let us go in to him , "
53137	53158	53133	53134	Father Brown	121	" You can leave Mr. Atkinson alone . I have had him in sight since we heard Quinton 's voice . "
53159	53168	53170	53170	Flambeau	111	" I will stop here and watch him , "
53173	53180	53170	53170	Flambeau	111	" You go in and see . "
53275	53283	53256	53257	The doctor	696	" Good God , look at that ! "
53325	53338	53315	53315	he	121	" I die by my own hand ; yet I die murdered ! "
53389	53395	53397	53397	Harris	211	" He 's done it , "
53575	53585	53565	53566	Father Brown	121	" Doctor , this paper is the wrong shape . "
53586	53592	53594	53595	Doctor Harris	219	" What do you mean ? "
53602	53608	53610	53610	Brown	121	" It is n't square , "
53612	53630	53610	53610	Brown	121	" It has a sort of edge snipped off at the corner . What does it mean ? "
53631	53639	53641	53642	the doctor	696	" How the deuce should I know ? "
53644	53661	53641	53642	the doctor	696	" Shall we move this poor chap , do you think ? He 's quite dead . "
53662	53665	53667	53668	the priest	374	" No , "
53670	53684	53667	53668	the priest	374	" we must leave him as he lies and send for the police . "
53715	53718	53719	53719	he	121	" Ah , "
53728	53740	53742	53742	he	121	" this is what he did it with . But yet - "
53747	53758	53760	53761	the doctor	696	" Oh , stop fooling with that scrap of paper , "
53764	53786	53788	53788	he	121	" It was a fad of his . He had hundreds of them . He cut all his paper like that , "
53823	53827	53828	53828	he	121	" Quite so , "
53831	53843	53828	53828	he	121	" And here I see the corners that were snipped off . "
53857	53863	53864	53864	he	121	" That 's all right , "
53872	53900	53864	53864	he	121	" Twenty - three sheets cut and twenty - two corners cut off them . And as I see you are impatient we will rejoin the others . "
53901	53909	53911	53912	Dr. Harris	211	" Who is to tell his wife ? "
53914	53932	53911	53912	Dr. Harris	211	" Will you go and tell her now , while I send a servant for the police ? "
53933	53938	53940	53941	Father Brown	121	" As you will , "
54091	54102	54103	54103	he	374	" Make it up with Mr. Atkinson , my friend , "
54106	54126	54103	54103	he	374	" Beg a mutual pardon and say ` Good night . ' We need not detain him any longer . "
54156	54162	54147	54148	Father Brown	121	" Where is that Indian ? "
54206	54210	54212	54213	the doctor	696	" Confound him , "
54218	54231	54212	54213	the doctor	696	" Now I know that it was that nigger that did it . "
54232	54242	54244	54245	Father Brown	121	" I thought you did n't believe in magic , "
54248	54254	54256	54257	the doctor	696	" No more I did , "
54263	54299	54256	54257	the doctor	696	" I only know that I loathed that yellow devil when I thought he was a sham wizard . And I shall loathe him more if I come to think he was a real one . "
54300	54309	54311	54311	Flambeau	111	" Well , his having escaped is nothing , "
54313	54346	54311	54311	Flambeau	111	" For we could have proved nothing and done nothing against him . One hardly goes to the parish constable with a story of suicide imposed by witchcraft or auto - suggestion . "
54440	54452	54453	54453	he	121	" You have sent for the police , have n't you ? "
54456	54459	54461	54461	Harris	211	" Yes , "
54463	54473	54461	54461	Harris	211	" They ought to be here in ten minutes . "
54474	54482	54484	54485	the priest	374	" Will you do me a favour ? "
54488	54550	54551	54551	he	121	" The truth is , I make a collection of these curious stories , which often contain , as in the case of our Hindoo friend , elements which can hardly be put into a police report . Now , I want you to write out a report of this case for my private use . Yours is a clever trade , "
54564	54611	54551	54551	he	121	" I sometimes think that you know some details of this matter which you have not thought fit to mention . Mine is a confidential trade like yours , and I will treat anything you write for me in strict confidence . But write the whole . "
54642	54646	54612	54613	The doctor	696	" All right , "
54659	54662	54664	54665	Father Brown	121	" Flambeau , "
54667	54713	54664	54665	Father Brown	121	" there is a long seat there under the veranda , where we can smoke out of the rain . You are my only friend in the world , and I want to talk to you . Or , perhaps , be silent with you . "
54755	54759	54760	54760	he	121	" My friend , "
54765	54778	54760	54760	he	121	" this is a very queer case . A very queer case . "
54779	54786	54788	54788	Flambeau	111	" I should think it was , "
54796	54808	54810	54811	the other	482	" You call it queer , and I call it queer , "
54813	55019	54810	54811	the other	482	" and yet we mean quite opposite things . The modern mind always mixes up two different ideas : mystery in the sense of what is marvellous , and mystery in the sense of what is complicated . That is half its difficulty about miracles . A miracle is startling ; but it is simple . It is simple because it is a miracle . It is power coming directly from God or the devil instead of indirectly through nature or human wills . Now , you mean that this business is marvellous because it is miraculous , because it is witchcraft worked by a wicked Indian . Understand , I do not say that it was not spiritual or diabolic . Heaven and hell only know by what surrounding influences strange sins come into the lives of men . But for the present my point is this : If it was pure magic , as you think , then it is marvellous ; but it is not mysterious - that is , it is not complicated . The quality of a miracle is mysterious , but its manner is simple . Now , the manner of this business has been the reverse of simple . "
55057	55065	55066	55066	he	121	" There has been in this incident , "
55069	55110	55066	55066	he	121	" a twisted , ugly , complex quality that does not belong to the straight bolts either of heaven or hell . As one knows the crooked track of a snail , I know the crooked track of a man . "
55134	55162	55129	55130	the priest	374	" Of all these crooked things , the crookedest was the shape of that piece of paper . It was crookeder than the dagger that killed him . "
55163	55175	55177	55177	Flambeau	111	" You mean the paper on which Quinton confessed his suicide , "
55179	55198	55200	55201	Father Brown	121	" I mean the paper on which Quinton wrote , ` I die by my own hand , ' "
55203	55233	55200	55201	Father Brown	121	" The shape of that paper , my friend , was the wrong shape ; the wrong shape , if ever I have seen it in this wicked world . "
55234	55243	55245	55245	Flambeau	111	" It only had a corner snipped off , "
55247	55261	55245	55245	Flambeau	111	" and I understand that all Quinton 's paper was cut that way . "
55262	55270	55272	55273	the other	482	" It was a very odd way , "
55275	55443	55272	55273	the other	482	" and a very bad way , to my taste and fancy . Look here , Flambeau , this Quinton - God receive his soul ! - was perhaps a bit of a cur in some ways , but he really was an artist , with the pencil as well as the pen . His handwriting , though hard to read , was bold and beautiful . I ca n't prove what I say ; I ca n't prove anything . But I tell you with the full force of conviction that he could never have cut that mean little piece off a sheet of paper . If he had wanted to cut down paper for some purpose of fitting in , or binding up , or what not , he would have made quite a different slash with the scissors . Do you remember the shape ? It was a mean shape . It was a wrong shape . Like this . Do n't you remember ? "
55495	55498	55500	55500	Flambeau	111	" But , "
55547	55547	55532	55533	somebody else	2089	"
55572	55579	55561	55561	he	121	" Quinton never did commit suicide . "
55585	55592	55593	55593	he	111	" Why , confound it all , "
55596	55605	55593	55593	he	111	" then why did he confess to suicide ? "
55634	55642	55613	55613	his	374	" He never did confess to suicide . "
55649	55653	55654	55654	he	111	" You mean , "
55657	55664	55654	55654	he	111	" that the writing was forged ? "
55665	55668	55670	55671	Father Brown	121	" No , "
55673	55680	55670	55671	Father Brown	121	" Quinton wrote it all right . "
55681	55688	55692	55692	Flambeau	111	" Well , there you are , "
55694	55718	55692	55692	Flambeau	111	" Quinton wrote , ` I die by my own hand , ' with his own hand on a plain piece of paper . "
55719	55725	55727	55728	the priest	374	" Of the wrong shape , "
55731	55739	55741	55741	Flambeau	111	" Oh , the shape be damned ! "
55743	55753	55741	55741	Flambeau	111	" What has the shape to do with it ? "
55754	55763	55765	55765	Brown	121	" There were twenty - three snipped papers , "
55768	55801	55765	55765	Brown	121	" and only twenty - two pieces snipped off . Therefore one of the pieces had been destroyed , probably that from the written paper . Does that suggest anything to you ? "
55814	55848	55811	55811	he	111	" There was something else written by Quinton , some other words . ` They will tell you I die by my own hand , ' or ` Do not believe that - ' "
55849	55857	55859	55860	his friend	3351	" Hotter , as the children say , "
55862	55913	55859	55860	his friend	3351	" But the piece was hardly half an inch across ; there was no room for one word , let alone five . Can you think of anything hardly bigger than a comma which the man with hell in his heart had to tear away as a testimony against him ? "
55914	55921	55923	55923	Flambeau	111	" I can think of nothing , "
55927	55933	55935	55936	the priest	374	" What about quotation marks ? "
55973	55993	55962	55963	Father Brown	121	" Leonard Quinton was a romancer , and was writing an Oriental romance about wizardry and hypnotism . He - "
56025	56033	56034	56034	he	696	" That 's the document you wanted , "
56037	56048	56034	56034	he	696	" and I must be getting home . Good night . "
56049	56053	56055	56056	Father Brown	121	" Good night , "
56412	56419	56421	56421	he	208	" The Cure of a Saint , "
56465	56478	56486	56486	his	208	" The conqueror of the Punjab , a mere yellow skeleton , but still
56510	56512	56486	56486	his	208	" It so
57388	57442	57346	57346	one	412	" If you ever retire and become respectable , come and see me . I want to meet you , for I have met all the other great men of my time . That trick of yours of getting one detective to arrest the other was the most splendid scene in French history . "
57456	57468	57469	57469	He	111	" Prince Saradine , Reed House , Reed Island , Norfolk . "
57839	57843	57845	57845	Flambeau	111	" By Jove ! "
57847	57855	57845	57845	Flambeau	111	" it 's like being in fairyland . "
57889	57898	57900	57901	the priest	374	" The people who wrote the mediaeval ballads , "
57903	57923	57900	57901	the priest	374	" knew more about fairies than you do . It is n't only nice things that happen in fairyland . "
57924	57929	57931	57931	Flambeau	111	" Oh , bosh ! "
57933	57976	57931	57931	Flambeau	111	" Only nice things could happen under such an innocent moon . I am for pushing on now and seeing what does really come . We may die and rot before we ever see again such a moon or such a mood . "
57977	57981	57983	57984	Father Brown	121	" All right , "
57986	58006	57983	57984	Father Brown	121	" I never said it was always wrong to enter fairyland . I only said it was always dangerous . "
58449	58453	58455	58455	Flambeau	111	" By George ! "
58457	58498	58455	58455	Flambeau	111	" here is the place , after all ! Here is Reed Island , if ever there was one . Here is Reed House , if it is anywhere . I believe that fat man with whiskers was a fairy . "
58499	58502	58504	58505	Father Brown	121	" Perhaps , "
58508	58519	58504	58505	Father Brown	121	" If he was , he was a bad fairy . "
58773	58782	58783	58783	he	2221	" His Highness may be here any minute , "
58786	58829	58783	58783	he	2221	" and would be distressed to have just missed any gentleman he had invited . We have orders always to keep a little cold lunch for him and his friends , and I am sure he would wish it to be offered . "
59238	59253	59255	59256	Father Brown	121	" We have taken a wrong turning , and come to a wrong place , "
59274	59293	59255	59256	Father Brown	121	" Never mind ; one can sometimes do good by being the right person in the wrong place . "
59617	59647	59601	59601	his	111	" The brothers Saradine , I suppose . They both look innocent enough . It would be hard to say which is the good brother and which the bad . "
59766	59813	59752	59752	she	229	" He is right enough in one way , your friend . He says it would be hard to pick out the good and bad brothers . Oh , it would be hard , it would be mighty hard , to pick out the good one . "
59814	59821	59823	59824	Father Brown	121	" I do n't understand you , "
59858	59866	59867	59867	she	229	" There is n't a good one , "
59870	59910	59867	59867	she	229	" There was badness enough in the captain taking all that money , but I do n't think there was much goodness in the prince giving it . The captain 's not the only one with something against him . "
59928	59931	59922	59922	his	121	" blackmail . "
59990	59994	59995	59995	he	121	" His Highness , "
59998	60003	59995	59995	he	121	" has just arrived . "
60180	60189	60174	60176	the new arrival	2293	" Well , you see I have come . "
60218	60224	60214	60215	the butler	4044	" Everything is at your disposal "
60278	60288	60289	60289	he	2166	" Delighted to see you here , Mr. Flambeau , "
60292	60308	60289	60289	he	2166	" Knowing you very well by reputation , if that 's not an indiscreet remark . "
60309	60314	60316	60316	Flambeau	111	" Not at all , "
60320	60335	60316	60316	Flambeau	111	" I am not sensitive . Very few reputations are gained by unsullied virtue . "
60367	60377	60378	60378	he	2166	" Pleasant little place , this , I think , "
60385	60401	60378	60378	he	2166	" Not much to do , I fear ; but the fishing is really good . "
61033	61040	61041	61041	he	121	" I wish Flambeau were back , "
61044	61051	61055	61056	Prince Saradine	225	" Do you believe in doom ? "
61059	61062	61064	61065	his guest	2346	" No , "
61067	61073	61064	61065	his guest	2346	" I believe in Doomsday . "
61097	61103	61104	61104	he	2166	" What do you mean ? "
61107	61122	61124	61125	Father Brown	121	" I mean that we here are on the wrong side of the tapestry , "
61127	61167	61124	61125	Father Brown	121	" The things that happen here do not seem to mean anything ; they mean something somewhere else . Somewhere else retribution will come on the real offender . Here it often seems to fall on the wrong person . "
61227	61236	61223	61223	He	2166	" The wrong person - the wrong person , "
61287	61297	61298	61298	he	121	" I thought it better to announce at once , "
61313	61338	61298	61298	he	121	" a boat rowed by six men has come to the landing - stage , and there 's a gentleman sitting in the stern . "
61339	61343	61345	61346	the prince	2166	" A boat ! "
61348	61352	61354	61354	he	2166	" a gentleman ? "
61560	61564	61566	61567	Prince Saradine	225	" The deuce ! "
61679	61683	61685	61687	the young man	1294	" Your name , "
61689	61693	61685	61687	the young man	1294	" is Saradine ? "
61769	61775	61776	61776	he	121	" Confound this crystal palace ! "

62119	62254	62114	62117	the man called Antonelli	2391	" when I was an infant in the cradle you killed my father and stole my mother ; my father was the more fortunate . You did not kill him fairly , as I am going to kill you . You and my wicked mother took him driving to a lonely pass in Sicily , flung him down a cliff , and went on your way . I could imitate you if I chose , but imitating you is too vile . I have followed you all over the world , and you have always fled from me . But this is the end of the world - and of you . I have you now , and I give you the chance you never gave my father . Choose one of those swords . "
62497	62503	62504	62504	he	121	" Your son is outside , "
62510	62525	62504	62504	he	121	" either he or the prince will be killed . Where is Mr. Paul ? "

62563	62608	62559	62560	Father Brown	121	" there is no time for nonsense . My friend has his boat down the river fishing . Your son 's boat is guarded by your son 's men . There is only this one canoe ; what is Mr. Paul doing with it ? "
62609	62618	62619	62619	she	532	" Santa Maria ! I do not know , "
62695	62702	62703	62703	he	230	" I will save my master , "
62711	62718	62703	62703	he	230	" I will save him yet ! "

62769	62797	62757	62757	he	121	" but there 's something wrong about this duel , even as a duel . I feel it in my bones . But what can it be ? "
63423	63430	63431	63431	he	374	" Now , why on earth , "
63434	63445	63431	63431	he	374	" why on earth could n't he have come before ? "

64337	64419	64326	64328	the venerable person	2489	" I live here very quietly , being a domestic kind of fellow ; and for the sake of modesty I am called Mr. Paul , to distinguish me from my unfortunate brother Mr. Stephen . He died , I hear , recently - in the garden . Of course , it is not my fault if enemies pursue him to this place . It is owing to the regrettable irregularity of his life . He was not a domestic character . "
64484	64488	64490	64490	Flambeau	111	" My God ! "
64495	64500	64490	64490	Flambeau	111	" he 's laughing ! "
64501	64505	64507	64508	Father Brown	121	" Come away , "
64515	64533	64507	64508	Father Brown	121	" Come away from this house of hell . Let us get into an honest boat again . "
64588	64632	64576	64577	Father Brown	121	" I suppose you can guess the whole story now ? After all , it 's a primitive story . A man had two enemies . He was a wise man . And so he discovered that two enemies are better than one . "
64633	64640	64642	64642	Flambeau	111	" I do not follow that , "
64644	64652	64654	64655	his friend	3351	" Oh , it 's really simple , "
64657	64831	64654	64655	his friend	3351	" Simple , though anything but innocent . Both the Saradines were scamps , but the prince , the elder , was the sort of scamp that gets to the top , and the younger , the captain , was the sort that sinks to the bottom . This squalid officer fell from beggar to blackmailer , and one ugly day he got his hold upon his brother , the prince . Obviously it was for no light matter , for Prince Paul Saradine was frankly ` fast , ' and had no reputation to lose as to the mere sins of society . In plain fact , it was a hanging matter , and Stephen literally had a rope round his brother 's neck . He had somehow discovered the truth about the Sicilian affair , and could prove that Paul murdered old Antonelli in the mountains . The captain raked in the hush money heavily for ten years , until even the prince 's splendid fortune began to look a little foolish .
64832	65029	64576	64577	Father Brown	121	" But Prince Saradine bore another burden besides his blood - sucking brother . He knew that the son of Antonelli , a mere child at the time of the murder , had been trained in savage Sicilian loyalty , and lived only to avenge his father , not with the gibbet for he lacked Stephen 's legal proof , but with the old weapons of vendetta . The boy had practised arms with a deadly perfection , and about the time that he was old enough to use them Prince Saradine began , as the society papers said , to travel . The fact is that he began to flee for his life , passing from place to place like a hunted criminal ; but with one relentless man upon his trail . That was Prince Paul 's position , and by no means a pretty one . The more money he spent on eluding Antonelli the less he had to silence Stephen . The more he gave to silence Stephen the less chance there was of finally escaping Antonelli . Then it was that he showed himself a great man - a genius like Napoleon .
65030	65242	64654	64655	his friend	3351	" Instead of resisting his two antagonists , he surrendered suddenly to both of them . He gave way like a Japanese wrestler , and his foes fell prostrate before him . He gave up the race round the world , and he gave up his address to young Antonelli ; then he gave up everything to his brother . He sent Stephen money enough for smart clothes and easy travel , with a letter saying roughly : ` This is all I have left . You have cleaned me out . I still have a little house in Norfolk , with servants and a cellar , and if you want more from me you must take that . Come and take possession if you like , and I will live there quietly as your friend or agent or anything . ' He knew that the Sicilian had never seen the Saradine brothers save , perhaps , in pictures ; he knew they were somewhat alike , both having grey , pointed beards . Then he shaved his own face and waited . The trap worked . The unhappy captain , in his new clothes , entered the house in triumph as a prince , and walked upon the Sicilian 's sword .
65243	65380	64576	64577	Father Brown	121	" There was one hitch , and it is to the honour of human nature . Evil spirits like Saradine often blunder by never expecting the virtues of mankind . He took it for granted that the Italian 's blow , when it came , would be dark , violent and nameless , like the blow it avenged ; that the victim would be knifed at night , or shot from behind a hedge , and so die without speech . It was a bad minute for Prince Paul when Antonelli 's chivalry proposed a formal duel , with all its possible explanations . It was then that I found him putting off in his boat with wild eyes . He was fleeing , bareheaded , in an open boat before Antonelli should learn who he was .
65381	65514	64654	64655	his friend	3351	" But , however agitated , he was not hopeless . He knew the adventurer and he knew the fanatic . It was quite probable that Stephen , the adventurer , would hold his tongue , through his mere histrionic pleasure in playing a part , his lust for clinging to his new cosy quarters , his rascal 's trust in luck , and his fine fencing . It was certain that Antonelli , the fanatic , would hold his tongue , and be hanged without telling tales of his family . Paul hung about on the river till he knew the fight was over . Then he roused the town , brought the police , saw his two vanquished enemies taken away forever , and sat down smiling to his dinner . "
65515	65522	65524	65524	Flambeau	111	" Laughing , God help us ! "
65530	65539	65524	65524	Flambeau	111	" Do they get such ideas from Satan ? "
65540	65548	65550	65551	the priest	374	" He got that idea from you , "
65553	65557	65559	65559	Flambeau	111	" God forbid ! "
65561	65570	65559	65559	Flambeau	111	" From me ! What do you mean ! "
65600	65611	65612	65612	he	374	" Do n't you remember his original invitation to you ? "
65615	65677	65612	65612	he	374	" and the compliment to your criminal exploit ? ` That trick of yours , ' he says , ` of getting one detective to arrest the other ' ? He has just copied your trick . With an enemy on each side of him , he slipped swiftly out of the way and let them collide and kill each other . "
65697	65709	65710	65710	he	111	" There 's the last of that old skull and crossbones , "
65727	65738	65713	65713	he	111	" but I should think it would poison the fishes . "
65779	65782	65784	65784	Flambeau	111	" Father , "
65787	65797	65784	65784	Flambeau	111	" do you think it was all a dream ? "
65938	65943	65989	65990	The Rev.	241	" The Blue Boar , "
66043	66048	66016	66021	Colonel the Hon . Norman Bohun	243	" The Blue Boar , "
66660	66666	66667	66667	he	1219	" Good morning , Wilfred , "
66670	66692	66667	66667	he	1219	" Like a good landlord I am watching sleeplessly over my people . I am going to call on the blacksmith . "
66702	66714	66693	66693	Wilfred	242	" The blacksmith is out . He is over at Greenford . "
66715	66719	66721	66722	the other	482	" I know , "
66727	66737	66721	66722	the other	482	" that is why I am calling on him . "
66738	66741	66743	66744	the cleric	901	" Norman , "
66756	66764	66743	66744	the cleric	901	" are you ever afraid of thunderbolts ? "
66765	66771	66773	66774	the colonel	1219	" What do you mean ? "
66776	66782	66773	66774	the colonel	1219	" Is your hobby meteorology ? "
66783	66787	66789	66789	Wilfred	242	" I mean , "
66795	66809	66789	66789	Wilfred	242	" do you ever think that God might strike you in the street ? "
66810	66816	66818	66819	the colonel	1219	" I beg your pardon , "
66821	66831	66818	66819	the colonel	1219	" I see your hobby is folk - lore . "
66832	66840	66842	66844	the religious man	2565	" I know your hobby is blasphemy , "
66856	66873	66842	66844	the religious man	2565	" But if you do not fear God , you have good reason to fear man . "
66881	66885	66886	66886	he	2336	" Fear man ? "
66889	66904	66906	66907	the clergyman	1269	" Barnes the blacksmith is the biggest and strongest man for forty miles round , "
66910	66929	66906	66907	the clergyman	1269	" I know you are no coward or weakling , but he could throw you over the wall . "
66990	66999	67000	67000	he	243	" In that case , my dear Wilfred , "
67005	67022	67000	67000	he	243	" it was wise for the last of the Bohuns to come out partially in armour . "
67068	67077	67079	67080	his brother	4396	" It was the first hat to hand , "
67083	67094	67079	67080	his brother	4396	" always the nearest hat - and the nearest woman . "
67095	67103	67105	67105	Wilfred	242	" The blacksmith is away at Greenford , "
67108	67117	67105	67105	Wilfred	242	" the time of his return is unsettled . "
67264	67268	67260	67260	He	2578	" Mad Joe , "
67619	67624	67626	67627	Wilfred Bohun	242	" What is it ? "
67668	67676	67677	67677	he	2599	" You must excuse me , sir , "
67684	67718	67677	67677	he	2599	" but we did n't think it right not to let you know at once . I 'm afraid a rather dreadful thing has happened , sir . I 'm afraid your brother - "
67725	67733	67734	67734	he	242	" What devilry has he done now ? "
67740	67745	67747	67748	the cobbler	2595	" Why , sir , "
67752	67784	67747	67748	the cobbler	2595	" I 'm afraid he 's done nothing , and wo n't do anything . I 'm afraid he 's done for . You had really better come down , sir . "
68022	68039	68016	68016	He	242	" My brother is dead . What does it mean ? What is this horrible mystery ? "
68059	68066	68067	68067	he	2595	" Plenty of horror , sir , "
68070	68076	68067	68067	he	2595	" but not much mystery . "
68077	68083	68085	68085	Wilfred	242	" What do you mean ? "
68092	68098	68100	68100	Gibbs	252	" It 's plain enough , "
68102	68133	68100	68100	Gibbs	252	" There is only one man for forty miles round that could have struck such a blow as that , and he 's the man that had most reason to . "
68134	68141	68144	68145	the doctor	696	" We must not prejudge anything , "
68158	68213	68144	68145	the doctor	696	" but it is competent for me to corroborate what Mr. Gibbs says about the nature of the blow , sir ; it is an incredible blow . Mr. Gibbs says that only one man in this district could have done it . I should have said myself that nobody could have done it . "
68227	68233	68234	68234	he	696	" I can hardly understand , "
68237	68241	68243	68244	the doctor	696	" Mr. Bohun , "
68250	68298	68243	68244	the doctor	696	" metaphors literally fail me . It is inadequate to say that the skull was smashed to bits like an eggshell . Fragments of bone were driven into the body and the ground like bullets into a mud wall . It was the hand of a giant . "
68315	68367	68312	68312	he	696	" The thing has one advantage - that it clears most people of suspicion at one stroke . If you or I or any normally made man in the country were accused of this crime , we should be acquitted as an infant would be acquitted of stealing the Nelson column . "
68368	68375	68377	68378	the cobbler	2595	" That 's what I say , "
68381	68412	68377	68378	the cobbler	2595	" there 's only one man that could have done it , and he 's the man that would have done it . Where 's Simeon Barnes , the blacksmith ? "
68413	68420	68422	68423	the curate	2535	" He 's over at Greenford , "
68425	68432	68434	68435	the cobbler	2595	" More likely over in France , "
68437	68448	68377	68378	the cobbler	2595	" No ; he is in neither of those places , "
68469	68486	68377	68378	the cobbler	2595	" As a matter of fact , he is coming up the road at this moment . "
68615	68619	68621	68623	the atheistic cobbler	2641	" My God ! "
68625	68636	68621	68623	the atheistic cobbler	2641	" and there 's the hammer he did it with . "
68637	68640	68642	68643	the inspector	480	" No , "
68661	68689	68642	68643	the inspector	480	" There 's the hammer he did it with over there by the church wall . We have left it and the body exactly as they are . "
68770	68777	68778	68778	he	2645	" Mr. Gibbs was hardly right , "
68781	68814	68778	68778	he	2645	" in saying that there is no mystery . There is at least the mystery of why so big a man should attempt so big a blow with so little a hammer . "
68815	68822	68824	68824	Gibbs	252	" Oh , never mind that , "
68830	68840	68824	68824	Gibbs	252	" What are we to do with Simeon Barnes ? "
68841	68846	68848	68849	the priest	374	" Leave him alone , "
68852	68886	68848	68849	the priest	374	" He is coming here of himself . I know those two men with him . They are very good fellows from Greenford , and they have come over about the Presbyterian chapel . "
68939	68949	68950	68950	he	2652	" I wo n't ask you , Mr. Barnes , "
68953	69011	68950	68950	he	2652	" whether you know anything about what has happened here . You are not bound to say . I hope you do n't know , and that you will be able to prove it . But I must go through the form of arresting you in the King 's name for the murder of Colonel Norman Bohun . "
69012	69021	69023	69024	the cobbler	2595	" You are not bound to say anything , "
69029	69057	69023	69024	the cobbler	2595	" They 've got to prove everything . They have n't proved yet that it is Colonel Bohun , with the head all smashed up like that . "
69058	69064	69066	69067	the doctor	696	" That wo n't wash , "
69073	69130	69066	69067	the doctor	696	" That 's out of the detective stories . I was the colonel 's medical man , and I knew his body better than he did . He had very fine hands , but quite peculiar ones . The second and third fingers were the same length . Oh , that 's the colonel right enough . "
69155	69161	69163	69164	the smith	2638	" Is Colonel Bohun dead ? "
69168	69174	69163	69164	the smith	2638	" Then he 's damned . "
69175	69188	69190	69192	the atheist cobbler	2659	" Do n't say anything ! Oh , do n't say anything , "
69234	69253	69254	69254	he	2536	" It 's well for you infidels to dodge like foxes because the world 's law favours you , "
69257	69274	69254	69254	he	2536	" but God guards His own in His pocket , as you shall see this day . "
69284	69294	69276	69276	he	2536	" When did this dog die in his sins ? "
69295	69300	69302	69303	the doctor	696	" Moderate your language , "
69305	69323	69276	69276	he	2536	" Moderate the Bible 's language , and I 'll moderate mine . When did he die ? "
69324	69335	69337	69338	Wilfred Bohun	242	" I saw him alive at six o'clock this morning , "
69340	69345	69347	69348	the smith	2638	" God is good , "
69350	69405	69347	69348	the smith	2638	" Mr. Inspector , I have not the slightest objection to being arrested . It is you who may object to arresting me . I do n't mind leaving the court without a stain on my character . You do mind perhaps leaving the court with a bad set - back in your career . "
69450	69460	69463	69464	the blacksmith	2536	" There are two men standing outside this shop , "
69469	69575	69463	69464	the blacksmith	2536	" good tradesmen in Greenford whom you all know , who will swear that they saw me from before midnight till daybreak and long after in the committee room of our Revival Mission , which sits all night , we save souls so fast . In Greenford itself twenty people could swear to me for all that time . If I were a heathen , Mr. Inspector , I would let you walk on to your downfall . But as a Christian man I feel bound to give you your chance , and ask you whether you will hear my alibi now or in court . "
69588	69601	69576	69577	The inspector	480	" Of course I should be glad to clear you altogether now . "
69703	69716	69695	69696	the curate	2535	" You seem very much interested in that hammer , Father Brown . "
69717	69723	69725	69726	Father Brown	121	" Yes , I am , "
69728	69737	69725	69726	Father Brown	121	" why is it such a small hammer ? "
69745	69753	69754	69754	he	696	" By George , that 's true , "
69757	69771	69754	69754	he	696	" who would use a little hammer with ten larger hammers lying about ? "
69785	69851	69773	69773	he	696	" Only the kind of person that ca n't lift a large hammer . It is not a question of force or courage between the sexes . It 's a question of lifting power in the shoulders . A bold woman could commit ten murders with a light hammer and never turn a hair . She could not kill a beetle with a heavy one . "
69892	69947	69883	69884	The doctor	696	" Why do these idiots always assume that the only person who hates the wife 's lover is the wife 's husband ? Nine times out of ten the person who most hates the wife 's lover is the wife . Who knows what insolence or treachery he had shown her - look there ! "
70038	70046	70047	70047	he	121	" You are like so many doctors , "
70050	70131	70047	70047	he	121	" your mental science is really suggestive . It is your physical science that is utterly impossible . I agree that the woman wants to kill the co - respondent much more than the petitioner does . And I agree that a woman will always pick up a small hammer instead of a big one . But the difficulty is one of physical impossibility . No woman ever born could have smashed a man 's skull out flat like that . "
70141	70180	70133	70133	he	121	" These people have n't grasped the whole of it . The man was actually wearing an iron helmet , and the blow scattered it like broken glass . Look at that woman . Look at her arms . "
70196	70237	70190	70191	the doctor	696	" Well , I may be wrong ; there are objections to everything . But I stick to the main point . No man but an idiot would pick up that little hammer if he could use a big hammer . "
70272	70286	70269	70269	he	241	" That was the word I wanted ; you have said the word . "
70295	70316	70288	70288	he	241	" The words you said were , ` No man but an idiot would pick up the small hammer . ' "
70317	70320	70322	70323	the doctor	696	" Yes , "
70325	70328	70322	70323	the doctor	696	" Well ? "
70329	70332	70334	70335	the curate	2535	" Well , "
70337	70345	70334	70335	the curate	2535	" no man but an idiot did . "
70368	70374	70375	70375	he	241	" I am a priest , "
70379	70430	70375	70375	he	241	" and a priest should be no shedder of blood . I - I mean that he should bring no one to the gallows . And I thank God that I see the criminal clearly now - because he is a criminal who can not be brought to the gallows . "
70431	70438	70440	70441	the doctor	696	" You will not denounce him ? "
70443	70455	70457	70457	Wilfred	241	" He would not be hanged if I did denounce him , "
70466	70548	70457	70457	Wilfred	241	" When I went into the church this morning I found a madman praying there - that poor Joe , who has been wrong all his life . God knows what he prayed ; but with such strange folk it is not incredible to suppose that their prayers are all upside down . Very likely a lunatic would pray before killing a man . When I last saw poor Joe he was with my brother . My brother was mocking him . "
70549	70553	70555	70556	the doctor	696	" By Jove ! "
70558	70571	70555	70556	the doctor	696	" this is talking at last . But how do you explain - "
70589	70600	70601	70601	he	241	" Do n't you see ; do n't you see , "
70605	70726	70601	70601	he	241	" that is the only theory that covers both the queer things , that answers both the riddles . The two riddles are the little hammer and the big blow . The smith might have struck the big blow , but would not have chosen the little hammer . His wife would have chosen the little hammer , but she could not have struck the big blow . But the madman might have done both . As for the little hammer - why , he was mad and might have picked up anything . And for the big blow , have you never heard , doctor , that a maniac in his paroxysm may have the strength of ten men ? "
70737	70748	70727	70728	The doctor	696	" By golly , I believe you 've got it . "
70796	70842	70790	70790	he	121	" Mr. Bohun , yours is the only theory yet propounded which holds water every way and is essentially unassailable . I think , therefore , that you deserve to be told , on my positive knowledge , that it is not the true one . "
70859	70871	70873	70874	the doctor	696	" That fellow seems to know more than he ought to , "
70879	70887	70873	70874	the doctor	696	" Those popish priests are deucedly sly . "
70888	70893	70895	70895	Bohun	241	" No , no , "
70904	70915	70895	70895	Bohun	241	" It was the lunatic . It was the lunatic . "
70983	71036	70975	70976	the blacksmith	2536	" I hope I 've convinced you , Mr. Inspector . I 'm a strong man , as you say , but I could n't have flung my hammer bang here from Greenford . My hammer has n't got wings that it should come flying half a mile over hedges and fields . "
71044	71118	71037	71038	The inspector	480	" No , I think you can be considered out of it , though it 's one of the rummiest coincidences I ever saw . I can only ask you to give us all the assistance you can in finding a man as big and strong as yourself . By George ! you might be useful , if only to hold him ! I suppose you yourself have no guess at the man ? "
71119	71126	71128	71130	the pale smith	2712	" I may have a guess , "
71132	71141	71128	71130	the pale smith	2712	" but it is not at a man . "
71167	71173	71156	71156	he	2712	" Nor a woman either . "
71174	71180	71182	71183	the inspector	480	" What do you mean ? "
71186	71198	71156	71156	he	2712	" You do n't think cows use hammers , do you ? "
71199	71210	71212	71213	the blacksmith	2536	" I think no thing of flesh held that hammer , "
71219	71230	71212	71213	the blacksmith	2536	" mortally speaking , I think the man died alone . "
71245	71254	71260	71261	the cobbler	2595	" Do you mean to say , Barnes , "
71263	71277	71260	71261	the cobbler	2595	" that the hammer jumped up of itself and knocked the man down ? "
71278	71288	71290	71290	Simeon	250	" Oh , you gentlemen may stare and snigger , "
71292	71357	71290	71290	Simeon	250	" you clergymen who tell us on Sunday in what a stillness the Lord smote Sennacherib . I believe that One who walks invisible in every house defended the honour of mine , and laid the defiler dead before the door of it . I believe the force in that blow was just the force there is in earthquakes , and no force less . "
71367	71378	71358	71358	Wilfred	241	" I told Norman myself to beware of the thunderbolt . "
71379	71387	71389	71390	the inspector	480	" That agent is outside my jurisdiction , "
71396	71403	71405	71406	the smith	2638	" You are not outside His , "
71414	71427	71405	71406	the smith	2638	" and , turning his broad back , he went into the house .
71448	71461	71462	71462	he	121	" Let us get out of this horrid place , Mr. Bohun , "
71465	71492	71493	71493	he	121	" May I look inside your church ? I hear it 's one of the oldest in England . We take some interest , you know , "
71500	71506	71493	71493	he	121	" in old English churches . "
71552	71557	71558	71558	he	241	" By all means , "
71561	71570	71558	71558	he	241	" let us go in at this side . "
71629	71632	71634	71635	the physician	2723	" Sir , "
71638	71663	71634	71635	the physician	2723	" you appear to know some secrets in this black business . May I ask if you are going to keep them to yourself ? "
71664	71669	71671	71672	the priest	374	" Why , doctor , "
71678	71760	71671	71672	the priest	374	" there is one very good reason why a man of my trade should keep things to himself when he is not sure of them , and that is that it is so constantly his duty to keep them to himself when he is sure of them . But if you think I have been discourteously reticent with you or anyone , I will go to the extreme limit of my custom . I will give you two very large hints . "
71761	71766	71768	71769	the doctor	696	" Well , sir ? "
71772	71775	71777	71778	Father Brown	121	" First , "
71781	71881	71777	71778	Father Brown	121	" the thing is quite in your own province . It is a matter of physical science . The blacksmith is mistaken , not perhaps in saying that the blow was divine , but certainly in saying that it came by a miracle . It was no miracle , doctor , except in so far as man is himself a miracle , with his strange and wicked and yet half - heroic heart . The force that smashed that skull was a force well known to scientists - one of the most frequently debated of the laws of nature . "
71897	71903	71882	71883	The doctor	696	" And the other hint ? "
71904	71911	71913	71914	the priest	374	" The other hint is this , "
71916	71949	71913	71914	the priest	374	" Do you remember the blacksmith , though he believes in miracles , talking scornfully of the impossible fairy tale that his hammer had wings and flew half a mile across country ? "
71950	71953	71955	71956	the doctor	696	" Yes , "
71958	71963	71955	71956	the doctor	696	" I remember that . "
71964	71967	71969	71970	Father Brown	121	" Well , "
71977	71995	71969	71970	Father Brown	121	" that fairy tale was the nearest thing to the real truth that has been said today . "
72145	72153	72154	72154	he	121	" Come up here , Mr. Bohun , "
72157	72165	72154	72154	he	121	" The air will do you good . "
72246	72259	72261	72262	Father Brown	121	" Might be the map of the world , might n't it ? "
72264	72267	72275	72275	his	253	" Yes , "
72554	72572	72574	72575	Father Brown	121	" I think there is something rather dangerous about standing on these high places even to pray , "
72577	72592	72574	72575	Father Brown	121	" Heights were made to be looked at , not to be looked from . "
72593	72603	72605	72605	Wilfred	259	" Do you mean that one may fall over , "
72607	72623	72625	72627	the other priest	588	" I mean that one 's soul may fall if one 's body does n't , "
72629	72635	72637	72637	Bohun	253	" I scarcely understand you , "
72640	72649	72652	72653	Father Brown	121	" Look at that blacksmith , for instance , "
72656	72728	72652	72653	Father Brown	121	" a good man , but not a Christian - hard , imperious , unforgiving . Well , his Scotch religion was made up by men who prayed on hills and high crags , and learnt to look down on the world more than to look up at heaven . Humility is the mother of giants . One sees great things from the valley ; only small things from the peak . "
72729	72739	72741	72741	Bohun	253	" But he - he did n't do it , "
72744	72747	72749	72750	the other	482	" No , "
72756	72765	72749	72750	the other	482	" we know he did n't do it . "
72784	72790	72791	72791	he	482	" I knew a man , "
72794	72878	72791	72791	he	482	" who began by worshipping with others before the altar , but who grew fond of high and lonely places to pray from , corners or niches in the belfry or the spire . And once in one of those dizzy places , where the whole world seemed to turn under him like a wheel , his brain turned also , and he fancied he was God . So that , though he was a good man , he committed a great crime . "
72903	72973	72887	72887	his	259	" He thought it was given to him to judge the world and strike down the sinner . He would never have had such a thought if he had been kneeling with other men upon a floor . But he saw all men walking about like insects . He saw one especially strutting just below him , insolent and evident by a bright green hat - a poisonous insect . "
72995	73089	72990	72991	Father Brown	121	" This also tempted him , that he had in his hand one of the most awful engines of nature ; I mean gravitation , that mad and quickening rush by which all earth 's creatures fly back to her heart when released . See , the inspector is strutting just below us in the smithy . If I were to toss a pebble over this parapet it would be something like a bullet by the time it struck him . If I were to drop a hammer - even a small hammer - "
73111	73117	73118	73118	he	121	" Not by that door , "
73123	73130	73118	73118	he	121	" that door leads to hell . "
73146	73154	73155	73155	he	241	" How do you know all this ? "
73158	73164	73155	73155	he	241	" Are you a devil ? "
73165	73171	73173	73174	Father Brown	121	" I am a man , "
73177	73191	73192	73192	he	121	" and therefore have all devils in my heart . Listen to me , "
73199	73330	73192	73192	he	121	" I know what you did - at least , I can guess the great part of it . When you left your brother you were racked with no unrighteous rage , to the extent even that you snatched up a small hammer , half inclined to kill him with his foulness on his mouth . Recoiling , you thrust it under your buttoned coat instead , and rushed into the church . You pray wildly in many places , under the angel window , upon the platform above , and a higher platform still , from which you could see the colonel 's Eastern hat like the back of a green beetle crawling about . Then something snapped in your soul , and you let God 's thunderbolt fall . "
73347	73361	73331	73331	Wilfred	241	" How did you know that his hat looked like a green beetle ? "
73362	73367	73369	73370	the other	482	" Oh , that , "
73378	73551	73369	73370	the other	482	" that was common sense . But hear me further . I say I know all this ; but no one else shall know it . The next step is for you ; I shall take no more steps ; I will seal this with the seal of confession . If you ask me why , there are many reasons , and only one that concerns you . I leave things to you because you have not yet gone very far wrong , as assassins go . You did not help to fix the crime on the smith when it was easy ; or on his wife , when that was easy . You tried to fix it on the imbecile because you knew that he could not suffer . That was one of the gleams that it is my business to find in assassins . And now come down into the village , and go your own way as free as the wind ; for I have said my last word . "
73592	73606	73572	73573	Wilfred Bohun	241	" I wish to give myself up ; I have killed my brother . "
73923	73930	73932	73933	Father Brown	121	" What on earth is that ? "
73939	73946	73948	73948	Flambeau	111	" Oh , a new religion , "
73952	74042	73948	73948	Flambeau	111	" one of those new religions that forgive your sins by saying you never had any . Rather like Christian Science , I should think . The fact is that a fellow calling himself Kalon I do n't know what his name is , except that it ca n't be that has taken the flat just above me . I have two lady typewriters underneath me , and this enthusiastic old humbug on top . He calls himself the New Priest of Apollo , and he worships the sun . "
74043	74049	74051	74052	Father Brown	121	" Let him look out , "
74054	74073	74051	74052	Father Brown	121	" The sun was the cruellest of all the gods . But what does that monstrous eye mean ? "
74074	74087	74089	74089	Flambeau	111	" As I understand it , it is a theory of theirs , "
74091	74134	74089	74089	Flambeau	111	" that a man can endure anything if his mind is quite steady . Their two great symbols are the sun and the open eye ; for they say that if a man were really healthy he could stare at the sun . "
74135	74143	74145	74146	Father Brown	121	" If a man were really healthy , "
74148	74158	74145	74146	Father Brown	121	" he would not bother to stare at it . "
74159	74174	74177	74177	Flambeau	111	" Well , that 's all I can tell you about the new religion , "
74180	74195	74177	74177	Flambeau	111	" It claims , of course , that it can cure all physical diseases . "
74196	74205	74207	74208	Father Brown	121	" Can it cure the one spiritual disease ? "
74215	74224	74226	74226	Flambeau	111	" And what is the one spiritual disease ? "
74230	74239	74241	74242	his friend	3351	" Oh , thinking one is quite well , "
75002	75059	74963	74963	she	266	" and the morbid admission of weakness implied in such an apparatus . She dared her sister to bring such artificial , unhealthy rubbish into the place again . She asked if she was expected to wear wooden legs or false hair or glass eyes ; and as she spoke her eyes sparkled like the terrible crystal .
75117	75123	75125	75126	Pauline Stacey	266	" That is so different , "
75130	75314	75125	75126	Pauline Stacey	266	" Batteries and motors and all those things are marks of the force of man - yes , Mr. Flambeau , and the force of woman , too ! We shall take our turn at these great engines that devour distance and defy time . That is high and splendid - that is really science . But these nasty props and plasters the doctors sell - why , they are just badges of poltroonery . Doctors stick on legs and arms as if we were born cripples and sick slaves . But I was free - born , Mr. Flambeau ! People only think they need these things because they have been trained in fear instead of being trained in power and courage , just as the silly nurses tell children not to stare at the sun , and so they ca n't do it without blinking . But why among the stars should there be one star I may not see ? The sun is not my master , and I will open my eyes and stare at him whenever I choose . "
75315	75319	75321	75321	Flambeau	111	" Your eyes , "
75328	75334	75321	75321	Flambeau	111	" will dazzle the sun . "
75376	75393	75364	75364	he	111	" So she has got into the hands of that conjurer upstairs with his golden eye . "
76052	76056	76058	76059	the prophet	2872	" O sun , "
76061	76130	76058	76059	the prophet	2872	" O star that art too great to be allowed among the stars ! O fountain that flowest quietly in that secret spot that is called space . White Father of all white unwearied things , white flames and white flowers and white peaks . Father , who art more innocent than all thy most innocent and quiet children ; primal purity , into the peace of which - "
76671	76690	76662	76662	he	111	" Then , if he has been up there all the time , who can have done it ? "
76691	76694	76696	76697	the other	482	" Perhaps , "
76699	76719	76696	76697	the other	482	" we might go upstairs and find out . We have half an hour before the police will move . "
76773	76777	76778	76778	he	111	" Her sister , "
76786	76798	76778	76778	he	111	" her sister seems to have gone out for a walk . "
76803	76819	76820	76820	he	121	" Or , she may have gone up to the office of that sun man , "
76823	76848	76849	76849	he	111	" If I were you I should just verify that , and then let us all talk it over in your office . No , "
76877	76877	76849	76849	he	111	"
77112	77115	77116	77116	he	121	" Prophet , "
77123	77136	77116	77116	he	121	" I wish you would tell me a lot about your religion . "
77137	77146	77148	77148	Kalon	265	" I shall be proud to do it , "
77156	77166	77148	77148	Kalon	265	" but I am not sure that I understand . "
77167	77175	77177	77178	Father Brown	121	" Why , it 's like this , "
77186	77253	77177	77178	Father Brown	121	" We are taught that if a man has really bad first principles , that must be partly his fault . But , for all that , we can make some difference between a man who insults his quite clear conscience and a man with a conscience more or less clouded with sophistries . Now , do you really think that murder is wrong at all ? "
77254	77260	77262	77262	Kalon	265	" Is this an accusation ? "
77266	77269	77271	77271	Brown	121	" No , "
77276	77285	77271	77271	Brown	121	" it is the speech for the defence . "
77392	77400	77402	77403	the prophet	2872	" We meet at last , Caiaphas , "
77405	77517	77402	77403	the prophet	2872	" Your church and mine are the only realities on this earth . I adore the sun , and you the darkening of the sun ; you are the priest of the dying and I of the living God . Your present work of suspicion and slander is worthy of your coat and creed . All your church is but a black police ; you are only spies and detectives seeking to tear from men confessions of guilt , whether by treachery or torture . You would convict men of crime , I would convict them of innocence . You would convince them of sin , I would convince them of virtue .
77518	77841	77842	77842	He	2948	" Reader of the books of evil , one more word before I blow away your baseless nightmares for ever . Not even faintly could you understand how little I care whether you can convict me or no . The things you call disgrace and horrible hanging are to me no more than an ogre in a child 's toy - book to a man once grown up . You said you were offering the speech for the defence . I care so little for the cloudland of this life that I will offer you the speech for the prosecution . There is but one thing that can be said against me in this matter , and I will say it myself . The woman that is dead was my love and my bride ; not after such manner as your tin chapels call lawful , but by a law purer and sterner than you will ever understand . She and I walked another world from yours , and trod palaces of crystal while you were plodding through tunnels and corridors of brick . Well , I know that policemen , theological and otherwise , always fancy that where there has been love there must soon be hatred ; so there you have the first point made for the prosecution . But the second point is stronger ; I do not grudge it you . Not only is it true that Pauline loved me , but it is also true that this very morning , before she died , she wrote at that table a will leaving me and my new church half a million . Come , where are the handcuffs ? Do you suppose I care what foolish things you do with me ? Penal servitude will only be like waiting for her at a wayside station . The gallows will only be going to her in a headlong car . "
77905	78138	77892	77896	The prophet of the sun	2950	" In a few words I have put before you the whole case against me - the only possible case against me . In fewer words still I will blow it to pieces , so that not a trace of it remains . As to whether I have committed this crime , the truth is in one sentence : I could not have committed this crime . Pauline Stacey fell from this floor to the ground at five minutes past twelve . A hundred people will go into the witness - box and say that I was standing out upon the balcony of my own rooms above from just before the stroke of noon to a quarter - past - the usual period of my public prayers . My clerk a respectable youth from Clapham , with no sort of connection with me will swear that he sat in my outer office all the morning , and that no communication passed through . He will swear that I arrived a full ten minutes before the hour , fifteen minutes before any whisper of the accident , and that I did not leave the office or the balcony all that time . No one ever had so complete an alibi ; I could subpoena half Westminster . I think you had better put the handcuffs away again . The case is at an end .
78139	78446	78488	78489	the prophet	2872	" But last of all , that no breath of this idiotic suspicion remain in the air , I will tell you all you want to know . I believe I do know how my unhappy friend came by her death . You can , if you choose , blame me for it , or my faith and philosophy at least ; but you certainly can not lock me up . It is well known to all students of the higher truths that certain adepts and illuminati have in history attained the power of levitation - that is , of being self - sustained upon the empty air . It is but a part of that general conquest of matter which is the main element in our occult wisdom . Poor Pauline was of an impulsive and ambitious temper . I think , to tell the truth , she thought herself somewhat deeper in the mysteries than she was ; and she has often said to me , as we went down in the lift together , that if one 's will were strong enough , one could float down as harmlessly as a feather . I solemnly believe that in some ecstasy of noble thoughts she attempted the miracle . Her will , or faith , must have failed her at the crucial instant , and the lower law of matter had its horrible revenge . There is the whole story , gentlemen , very sad and , as you think , very presumptuous and wicked , but certainly not criminal or in any way connected with me . In the short - hand of the police - courts , you had better call it suicide . I shall always call it heroic failure for the advance of science and the slow scaling of heaven . "
78531	78566	78521	78521	he	2872	" Well , if that is so , sir , you need do no more than take the testamentary paper you spoke of and go . I wonder where the poor lady left it . "
78567	78583	78585	78585	Kalon	265	" It will be over there on her desk by the door , I think , "
78600	78630	78585	78585	Kalon	265	" She told me specially she would write it this morning , and I actually saw her writing as I went up in the lift to my own room . "
78631	78638	78640	78641	the priest	374	" Was her door open then ? "
78653	78656	78658	78658	Kalon	265	" Yes , "
78661	78671	78673	78674	the other	482	" Ah ! it has been open ever since , "
78685	78693	78695	78698	the grim Miss Joan	267	" There is a paper over here , "
78814	78825	78778	78778	Flambeau	111	" I give and bequeath all of which I die possessed "
78913	78923	78924	78924	he	111	" What monkey tricks have you been playing here ? "
78927	78935	78924	78924	he	111	" That 's not all Pauline wrote . "
78970	78980	78982	78982	Joan	267	" That is the only thing on her desk , "
79033	79037	79038	79038	he	111	" See here ! "
79051	79130	79038	79038	he	111	" I may be an adventurer , but I guess you 're a murderess . Yes , gentlemen , here 's your death explained , and without any levitation . The poor girl is writing a will in my favour ; her cursed sister comes in , struggles for the pen , drags her to the well , and throws her down before she can finish it . Sakes ! I reckon we want the handcuffs after all . "
79131	79138	79140	79140	Joan	267	" As you have truly remarked , "
79146	79205	79140	79140	Joan	267	" your clerk is a very respectable young man , who knows the nature of an oath ; and he will swear in any court that I was up in your office arranging some typewriting work for five minutes before and five minutes after my sister fell . Mr. Flambeau will tell you that he found me there . "
79211	79216	79218	79218	Flambeau	111	" Why , then , "
79220	79233	79218	79218	Flambeau	111	" Pauline was alone when she fell , and it was suicide ! "
79234	79242	79244	79245	Father Brown	121	" She was alone when she fell , "
79247	79254	79244	79245	Father Brown	121	" but it was not suicide . "
79255	79262	79264	79264	Flambeau	111	" Then how did she die ? "
79267	79272	79244	79245	Father Brown	121	" She was murdered . "
79273	79279	79281	79282	the detective	420	" But she was alone , "
79284	79294	79296	79297	the priest	374	" She was murdered when she was all alone , "
79340	79347	79349	79349	Kalon	265	" What I want to know , "
79355	79393	79349	79349	Kalon	265	" is when the police are coming for this bloody and wicked sister . She 's killed her flesh and blood ; she 's robbed me of half a million that was just as sacredly mine as - "
79394	79401	79403	79403	Flambeau	111	" Come , come , prophet , "
79411	79421	79403	79403	Flambeau	111	" remember that all this world is a cloudland . "
79439	79447	79448	79448	he	2968	" It is not the mere money , "
79451	79483	79448	79448	he	2968	" though that would equip the cause throughout the world . It is also my beloved one 's wishes . To Pauline all this was holy . In Pauline 's eyes - "
79517	79522	79523	79523	he	121	" That 's it ! "
79530	79543	79523	79523	he	121	" That 's the way to begin . In Pauline 's eyes - "
79558	79568	79569	79569	he	121	" What do you mean ? How dare you ? "
79573	79579	79581	79582	the priest	374	" In Pauline 's eyes , "
79591	79633	79581	79582	the priest	374	" Go on - in God 's name , go on . The foulest crime the fiends ever prompted feels lighter after confession ; and I implore you to confess . Go on , go on - in Pauline 's eyes - "
79634	79642	79644	79644	Kalon	265	" Let me go , you devil ! "
79653	79680	79644	79644	Kalon	265	" Who are you , you cursed spy , to weave your spiders ' webs round me , and peep and peer ? Let me go . "
79681	79687	79689	79689	Flambeau	111	" Shall I stop him ? "
79706	79713	79715	79716	Father Brown	121	" No ; let him pass , "
79734	79746	79715	79716	Father Brown	121	" Let Cain pass by , for he belongs to God . "
79789	79792	79794	79794	Flambeau	111	" Father , "
79798	79826	79794	79794	Flambeau	111	" it is my duty , not my curiosity only - it is my duty to find out , if I can , who committed the crime . "
79827	79831	79833	79834	Father Brown	121	" Which crime ? "
79836	79847	79849	79851	his impatient friend	2975	" The one we are dealing with , of course , "
79853	79861	79863	79863	Brown	121	" We are dealing with two crimes , "
79865	79878	79863	79863	Brown	121	" crimes of very different weight - and by very different criminals . "
79912	79917	79918	79918	he	121	" The two crimes , "
79921	79964	79918	79918	he	121	" were committed against the same weakness of the same person , in a struggle for her money . The author of the larger crime found himself thwarted by the smaller crime ; the author of the smaller crime got the money . "
79965	79976	79978	79978	Flambeau	111	" Oh , do n't go on like a lecturer , "
79980	79988	79978	79978	Flambeau	111	" put it in a few words . "
79989	79998	80000	80001	his friend	3351	" I can put it in one word , "
80051	80063	80065	80066	Father Brown	121	" The truth is one word , and a short one , "
80068	80074	80065	80066	Father Brown	121	" Pauline Stacey was blind . "
80075	80078	80080	80080	Flambeau	111	" Blind ! "
80091	80100	80101	80101	Brown	121	" She was subject to it by blood , "
80104	80252	80101	80101	Brown	121	" Her sister would have started eyeglasses if Pauline would have let her ; but it was her special philosophy or fad that one must not encourage such diseases by yielding to them . She would not admit the cloud ; or she tried to dispel it by will . So her eyes got worse and worse with straining ; but the worst strain was to come . It came with this precious prophet , or whatever he calls himself , who taught her to stare at the hot sun with the naked eye . It was called accepting Apollo . Oh , if these new pagans would only be old pagans , they would be a little wiser ! The old pagans knew that mere naked Nature - worship must have a cruel side . They knew that the eye of Apollo can blast and blind . "
80271	80451	80259	80260	the priest	374	" Whether or no that devil deliberately made her blind , there is no doubt that he deliberately killed her through her blindness . The very simplicity of the crime is sickening . You know he and she went up and down in those lifts without official help ; you know also how smoothly and silently the lifts slide . Kalon brought the lift to the girl 's landing , and saw her , through the open door , writing in her slow , sightless way the will she had promised him . He called out to her cheerily that he had the lift ready for her , and she was to come out when she was ready . Then he pressed a button and shot soundlessly up to his own floor , walked through his own office , out on to his own balcony , and was safely praying before the crowded street when the poor girl , having finished her work , ran gaily out to where lover and lift were to receive her , and stepped - "
80452	80456	80458	80458	Flambeau	111	" Do n't ! "
80460	80474	80476	80478	the little father	2922	" He ought to have got half a million by pressing that button , "
80492	80627	80486	80486	he	2922	" But that went smash . It went smash because there happened to be another person who also wanted the money , and who also knew the secret about poor Pauline 's sight . There was one thing about that will that I think nobody noticed : although it was unfinished and without signature , the other Miss Stacey and some servant of hers had already signed it as witnesses . Joan had signed first , saying Pauline could finish it later , with a typical feminine contempt for legal forms . Therefore , Joan wanted her sister to sign the will without real witnesses . Why ? I thought of the blindness , and felt sure she had wanted Pauline to sign in solitude because she had wanted her not to sign at all .
80628	80744	80753	80755	the official police	2980	" People like the Staceys always use fountain pens ; but this was specially natural to Pauline . By habit and her strong will and memory she could still write almost as well as if she saw ; but she could not tell when her pen needed dipping . Therefore , her fountain pens were carefully filled by her sister - all except this fountain pen . This was carefully not filled by her sister ; the remains of the ink held out for a few lines and then failed altogether . And the prophet lost five hundred thousand pounds and committed one of the most brutal and brilliant murders in human history for nothing . "
80765	80784	80760	80760	He	111	" You must have followed everything devilish close to have traced the crime to Kalon in ten minutes . "
80793	80799	80800	80800	he	121	" Oh ! to him , "
80803	80838	80800	80800	he	121	" No ; I had to follow rather close to find out about Miss Joan and the fountain pen . But I knew Kalon was the criminal before I came into the front door . "
80839	80845	80847	80847	Flambeau	111	" You must be joking ! "
80849	80855	80857	80858	the priest	374	" I 'm quite serious , "
80860	80880	80857	80858	the priest	374	" I tell you I knew he had done it , even before I knew what he had done . "
80881	80885	80800	80800	he	121	" But why ? "
80886	80891	80893	80893	Brown	121	" These pagan stoics , "
80896	80943	80893	80893	Brown	121	" always fail by their strength . There came a crash and a scream down the street , and the priest of Apollo did not start or look round . I did not know what it was . But I knew that he was expecting it . "
81514	81524	81506	81508	the small man	1486	" Where does a wise man hide a pebble ? "
81535	81540	81526	81528	the tall man	2771	" On the beach . "

81587	81613	81582	81584	the tall man	2771	" Do you mean that when a wise man has to hide a real diamond he has been known to hide it among sham ones ? "
81614	81619	81621	81623	the little man	602	" No , no , "
81628	81636	81621	81623	the little man	602	" we will let bygones be bygones . "
81652	81679	81637	81637	He	602	" I 'm not thinking of that at all , but of something else ; something rather peculiar . Just strike a match , will you ? "
81725	81772	81685	81685	his	3023	" Sacred to the Memory of General Sir Arthur St. Clare , Hero and Martyr , who Always Vanquished his Enemies and Always Spared Them , and Was Treacherously Slain by Them At Last . May God in Whom he Trusted both Reward and Revenge him . "
81801	81880	81795	81797	his small companion	3027	" That 's all right , Flambeau , old man ; I saw what I wanted . Or , rather , I did n't see what I did n't want . And now we must walk a mile and a half along the road to the next inn , and I will try to tell you all about it . For Heaven knows a man should have a fire and ale when he dares tell such a story . "
81927	81962	81924	81924	He	3031	" Yes ; the wise man hides a pebble on the beach . But what does he do if there is no beach ? Do you know anything of that great St. Clare trouble ? "
81963	81974	81976	81978	the large man	3032	" I know nothing about English generals , Father Brown , "
81982	82131	81976	81978	the large man	3032	" though a little about English policemen . I only know that you have dragged me a precious long dance to all the shrines of this fellow , whoever he is . One would think he got buried in six different places . I 've seen a memorial to General St. Clare in Westminster Abbey . I 've seen a ramping equestrian statue of General St. Clare on the Embankment . I 've seen a medallion of St. Clare in the street he was born in , and another in the street he lived in ; and now you drag me after dark to his coffin in the village churchyard . I am beginning to be a bit tired of his magnificent personality , especially as I do n't in the least know who he was . What are you hunting for in all these crypts and effigies ? "
82132	82141	82143	82144	Father Brown	121	" I am only looking for one word , "
82146	82154	82143	82144	Father Brown	121	" A word that is n't there . "
82155	82158	82160	82160	Flambeau	111	" Well , "
82162	82173	82160	82160	Flambeau	111	" are you going to tell me anything about it ? "
82174	82183	82185	82186	the priest	374	" I must divide it into two parts , "
82188	82221	82185	82186	the priest	374	" First there is what everybody knows ; and then there is what I know . Now , what everybody knows is short and plain enough . It is also entirely wrong . "
82222	82227	82229	82233	the big man called Flambeau	3034	" Right you are , "
82236	82258	82229	82233	the big man called Flambeau	3034	" Let 's begin at the wrong end . Let 's begin with what everybody knows , which is n't true . "
82259	82272	82274	82274	Brown	121	" If not wholly untrue , it is at least very inadequate , "
82276	82411	82274	82274	Brown	121	" for in point of fact , all that the public knows amounts precisely to this : The public knows that Arthur St. Clare was a great and successful English general . It knows that after splendid yet careful campaigns both in India and Africa he was in command against Brazil when the great Brazilian patriot Olivier issued his ultimatum . It knows that on that occasion St. Clare with a very small force attacked Olivier with a very large one , and was captured after heroic resistance . And it knows that after his capture , and to the abhorrence of the civilised world , St. Clare was hanged on the nearest tree . He was found swinging there after the Brazilians had retired , with his broken sword hung round his neck . "
82412	82420	82422	82422	Flambeau	111	" And that popular story is untrue ? "
82424	82427	82429	82430	his friend	3351	" No , "
82433	82446	82429	82430	his friend	3351	" that story is quite true , so far as it goes . "
82447	82457	82459	82459	Flambeau	111	" Well , I think it goes far enough ! "
82461	82475	82459	82459	Flambeau	111	" but if the popular story is true , what is the mystery ? "
82501	82591	82493	82493	he	363	" Why , the mystery is a mystery of psychology . Or , rather , it is a mystery of two psychologies . In that Brazilian business two of the most famous men of modern history acted flat against their characters . Mind you , Olivier and St. Clare were both heroes - the old thing , and no mistake ; it was like the fight between Hector and Achilles . Now , what would you say to an affair in which Achilles was timid and Hector was treacherous ? "
82592	82596	82598	82600	the large man	3032	" Go on , "
82610	82633	82635	82635	Brown	121	" Sir Arthur St. Clare was a soldier of the old religious type - the type that saved us during the Mutiny , "
82637	82900	82635	82635	Brown	121	" He was always more for duty than for dash ; and with all his personal courage was decidedly a prudent commander , particularly indignant at any needless waste of soldiers . Yet in this last battle he attempted something that a baby could see was absurd . One need not be a strategist to see it was as wild as wind ; just as one need not be a strategist to keep out of the way of a motor - bus . Well , that is the first mystery ; what had become of the English general 's head ? The second riddle is , what had become of the Brazilian general 's heart ? President Olivier might be called a visionary or a nuisance ; but even his enemies admitted that he was magnanimous to the point of knight errantry . Almost every other prisoner he had ever captured had been set free or even loaded with benefits . Men who had really wronged him came away touched by his simplicity and sweetness . Why the deuce should he diabolically revenge himself only once in his life ; and that for the one particular blow that could not have hurt him ? Well , there you have it . One of the wisest men in the world acted like an idiot for no reason . One of the best men in the world acted like a fiend for no reason . That 's the long and the short of it ; and I leave it to you , my boy . "
82901	82908	82910	82911	the other	482	" No , you do n't , "
82916	82933	82910	82911	the other	482	" I leave it to you ; and you jolly well tell me all about it . "
82934	82937	82939	82940	Father Brown	121	" Well , "
82942	83433	82939	82940	Father Brown	121	" it 's not fair to say that the public impression is just what I 've said , without adding that two things have happened since . I ca n't say they threw a new light ; for nobody can make sense of them . But they threw a new kind of darkness ; they threw the darkness in new directions . The first was this . The family physician of the St. Clares quarrelled with that family , and began publishing a violent series of articles , in which he said that the late general was a religious maniac ; but as far as the tale went , this seemed to mean little more than a religious man . Anyhow , the story fizzled out . Everyone knew , of course , that St. Clare had some of the eccentricities of puritan piety . The second incident was much more arresting . In the luckless and unsupported regiment which made that rash attempt at the Black River there was a certain Captain Keith , who was at that time engaged to St. Clare 's daughter , and who afterwards married her . He was one of those who were captured by Olivier , and , like all the rest except the general , appears to have been bounteously treated and promptly set free . Some twenty years afterwards this man , then Lieutenant - Colonel Keith , published a sort of autobiography called ` A British Officer in Burmah and Brazil . ' In the place where the reader looks eagerly for some account of the mystery of St. Clare 's disaster may be found the following words : ` Everywhere else in this book I have narrated things exactly as they occurred , holding as I do the old - fashioned opinion that the glory of England is old enough to take care of itself . The exception I shall make is in this matter of the defeat by the Black River ; and my reasons , though private , are honourable and compelling . I will , however , add this in justice to the memories of two distinguished men . General St. Clare has been accused of incapacity on this occasion ; I can at least testify that this action , properly understood , was one of the most brilliant and sagacious of his life . President Olivier by similar report is charged with savage injustice . I think it due to the honour of an enemy to say that he acted on this occasion with even more than his characteristic good feeling . To put the matter popularly , I can assure my countrymen that St. Clare was by no means such a fool nor Olivier such a brute as he looked . This is all I have to say ; nor shall any earthly consideration induce me to add a word to it . ' "
83502	83511	83512	83512	he	111	" Wait a bit , wait a bit , "
83516	83528	83512	83512	he	111	" I believe I can guess it at the first go . "
83647	83653	83654	83654	he	111	" I 've got it , "
83667	83682	83654	83654	he	111	" Four minutes ' thinking , and I can tell your whole story myself . "
83683	83687	83689	83690	his friend	3351	" All right , "
83692	83697	83689	83690	his friend	3351	" You tell it . "
83708	83715	83716	83716	he	111	" General Sir Arthur St. Clare , "
83719	83857	83716	83716	he	111	" came of a family in which madness was hereditary ; and his whole aim was to keep this from his daughter , and even , if possible , from his future son - in - law . Rightly or wrongly , he thought the final collapse was close , and resolved on suicide . Yet ordinary suicide would blazon the very idea he dreaded . As the campaign approached the clouds came thicker on his brain ; and at last in a mad moment he sacrificed his public duty to his private . He rushed rashly into battle , hoping to fall by the first shot . When he found that he had only attained capture and discredit , the sealed bomb in his brain burst , and he broke his own sword and hanged himself . "
83914	83919	83920	83920	he	111	" A horrid story , "
83923	83928	83930	83934	the priest with bent head	3054	" A horrid story , "
83936	83943	83930	83934	the priest with bent head	3054	" But not the real story . "
83958	83967	83945	83945	he	111	" Oh , I wish it had been . "
83978	83985	83987	83988	Father Brown	121	" Yours is a clean story , "
83993	84024	83987	83988	Father Brown	121	" A sweet , pure , honest story , as open and white as that moon . Madness and despair are innocent enough . There are worse things , Flambeau . "
84055	84060	84062	84062	Flambeau	111	" Father - father , "
84074	84084	84062	84062	Flambeau	111	" do you mean it was worse than that ? "
84085	84090	84092	84092	Paul	225	" Worse than that , "
84160	84185	84155	84156	the priest	374	" Where does a wise man hide a leaf ? In the forest . But what does he do if there is no forest ? "
84186	84191	84193	84193	Flambeau	111	" Well , well , "
84196	84202	84193	84193	Flambeau	111	" what does he do ? "
84203	84213	84215	84216	the priest	374	" He grows a forest to hide it in , "
84222	84227	84215	84216	the priest	374	" A fearful sin . "
84228	84232	84234	84235	his friend	3351	" Look here , "
84271	84271	84254	84254	you	374	"
84272	84281	84283	84284	the other	482	" There are three more bits of evidence , "
84286	84514	84283	84284	the other	482	" that I have dug up in holes and corners ; and I will give them in logical rather than chronological order . First of all , of course , our authority for the issue and event of the battle is in Olivier 's own dispatches , which are lucid enough . He was entrenched with two or three regiments on the heights that swept down to the Black River , on the other side of which was lower and more marshy ground . Beyond this again was gently rising country , on which was the first English outpost , supported by others which lay , however , considerably in its rear . The British forces as a whole were greatly superior in numbers ; but this particular regiment was just far enough from its base to make Olivier consider the project of crossing the river to cut it off . By sunset , however , he had decided to retain his own position , which was a specially strong one . At daybreak next morning he was thunderstruck to see that this stray handful of English , entirely unsupported from their rear , had flung themselves across the river , half by a bridge to the right , and the other half by a ford higher up , and were massed upon the marshy bank below him .
84515	84740	84982	84982	he	1175	" That they should attempt an attack with such numbers against such a position was incredible enough ; but Olivier noticed something yet more extraordinary . For instead of attempting to seize more solid ground , this mad regiment , having put the river in its rear by one wild charge , did nothing more , but stuck there in the mire like flies in treacle . Needless to say , the Brazilians blew great gaps in them with artillery , which they could only return with spirited but lessening rifle fire . Yet they never broke ; and Olivier 's curt account ends with a strong tribute of admiration for the mystic valour of these imbeciles . ` Our line then advanced finally , ' writes Olivier , ` and drove them into the river ; we captured General St. Clare himself and several other officers . The colonel and the major had both fallen in the battle . I can not resist saying that few finer sights can have been seen in history than the last stand of this extraordinary regiment ; wounded officers picking up the rifles of dead soldiers , and the general himself facing us on horseback bareheaded and with a broken sword . ' On what happened to the general afterwards Olivier is as silent as Captain Keith . "
84741	84744	84746	84746	Flambeau	111	" Well , "
84748	84758	84746	84746	Flambeau	111	" get on to the next bit of evidence . "
84759	84764	84766	84767	Father Brown	121	" The next evidence , "
84769	84957	84766	84767	Father Brown	121	" took some time to find , but it will not take long to tell . I found at last in an almshouse down in the Lincolnshire Fens an old soldier who not only was wounded at the Black River , but had actually knelt beside the colonel of the regiment when he died . This latter was a certain Colonel Clancy , a big bull of an Irishman ; and it would seem that he died almost as much of rage as of bullets . He , at any rate , was not responsible for that ridiculous raid ; it must have been imposed on him by the general . His last edifying words , according to my informant , were these : ` And there goes the damned old donkey with the end of his sword knocked off . I wish it was his head . ' You will remark that everyone seems to have noticed this detail about the broken sword blade , though most people regard it somewhat more reverently than did the late Colonel Clancy . And now for the third fragment . "
84992	85146	84982	84982	he	1175	" Only a month or two ago a certain Brazilian official died in England , having quarrelled with Olivier and left his country . He was a well - known figure both here and on the Continent , a Spaniard named Espado ; I knew him myself , a yellow - faced old dandy , with a hooked nose . For various private reasons I had permission to see the documents he had left ; he was a Catholic , of course , and I had been with him towards the end . There was nothing of his that lit up any corner of the black St. Clare business , except five or six common exercise books filled with the diary of some English soldier . I can only suppose that it was found by the Brazilians on one of those that fell . Anyhow , it stopped abruptly the night before the battle .
85147	85362	84982	84982	he	1175	" But the account of that last day in the poor fellow 's life was certainly worth reading . I have it on me ; but it 's too dark to read it here , and I will give you a resume . The first part of that entry is full of jokes , evidently flung about among the men , about somebody called the Vulture . It does not seem as if this person , whoever he was , was one of themselves , nor even an Englishman ; neither is he exactly spoken of as one of the enemy . It sounds rather as if he were some local go - between and non - combatant ; perhaps a guide or a journalist . He has been closeted with old Colonel Clancy ; but is more often seen talking to the major . Indeed , the major is somewhat prominent in this soldier 's narrative ; a lean , dark - haired man , apparently , of the name of Murray - a north of Ireland man and a Puritan . There are continual jests about the contrast between this Ulsterman 's austerity and the conviviality of Colonel Clancy . There is also some joke about the Vulture wearing bright - coloured clothes .
85363	85718	84982	84982	he	1175	" But all these levities are scattered by what may well be called the note of a bugle . Behind the English camp and almost parallel to the river ran one of the few great roads of that district . Westward the road curved round towards the river , which it crossed by the bridge before mentioned . To the east the road swept backwards into the wilds , and some two miles along it was the next English outpost . From this direction there came along the road that evening a glitter and clatter of light cavalry , in which even the simple diarist could recognise with astonishment the general with his staff . He rode the great white horse which you have seen so often in illustrated papers and Academy pictures ; and you may be sure that the salute they gave him was not merely ceremonial . He , at least , wasted no time on ceremony , but , springing from the saddle immediately , mixed with the group of officers , and fell into emphatic though confidential speech . What struck our friend the diarist most was his special disposition to discuss matters with Major Murray ; but , indeed , such a selection , so long as it was not marked , was in no way unnatural . The two men were made for sympathy ; they were men who ` read their Bibles ' ; they were both the old Evangelical type of officer . However this may be , it is certain that when the general mounted again he was still talking earnestly to Murray ; and that as he walked his horse slowly down the road towards the river , the tall Ulsterman still walked by his bridle rein in earnest debate . The soldiers watched the two until they vanished behind a clump of trees where the road turned towards the river . The colonel had gone back to his tent , and the men to their pickets ; the man with the diary lingered for another four minutes , and saw a marvellous sight .
85719	85837	84982	84982	he	1175	" The great white horse which had marched slowly down the road , as it had marched in so many processions , flew back , galloping up the road towards them as if it were mad to win a race . At first they thought it had run away with the man on its back ; but they soon saw that the general , a fine rider , was himself urging it to full speed . Horse and man swept up to them like a whirlwind ; and then , reining up the reeling charger , the general turned on them a face like flame , and called for the colonel like the trumpet that wakes the dead .
85838	86003	84982	84982	he	1175	" I conceive that all the earthquake events of that catastrophe tumbled on top of each other rather like lumber in the minds of men such as our friend with the diary . With the dazed excitement of a dream , they found themselves falling - literally falling - into their ranks , and learned that an attack was to be led at once across the river . The general and the major , it was said , had found out something at the bridge , and there was only just time to strike for life . The major had gone back at once to call up the reserve along the road behind ; it was doubtful if even with that prompt appeal help could reach them in time . But they must pass the stream that night , and seize the heights by morning . It is with the very stir and throb of that romantic nocturnal march that the diary suddenly ends . "
86047	86097	86035	86036	The priest	374	" There was one other little and enormous thing . When the general urged them to their chivalric charge he half drew his sword from the scabbard ; and then , as if ashamed of such melodrama , thrust it back again . The sword again , you see . "
86157	86177	86151	86151	He	111	" Well , what 's the matter with the sword ? Officers generally have swords , do n't they ? "
86178	86188	86305	86306	Father Brown	121	" They are not often mentioned in modern war , "
86194	86207	86305	86306	Father Brown	121	" but in this affair one falls over the blessed sword everywhere . "
86208	86217	86219	86219	Flambeau	111	" Well , what is there in that ? "
86221	86299	86219	86219	Flambeau	111	" it was a twopence coloured sort of incident ; the old man 's blade breaking in his last battle . Anyone might bet the papers would get hold of it , as they have . On all these tombs and things it 's shown broken at the point . I hope you have n't dragged me through this Polar expedition merely because two men with an eye for a picture saw St. Clare 's broken sword . "
86300	86303	86305	86306	Father Brown	121	" No , "
86317	86325	86305	86306	Father Brown	121	" but who saw his unbroken sword ? "
86326	86332	86334	86335	the other	482	" What do you mean ? "
86357	86367	86369	86370	Father Brown	121	" I say , who saw his unbroken sword ? "
86373	86390	86369	86370	Father Brown	121	" Not the writer of the diary , anyhow ; the general sheathed it in time . "
86423	86426	86427	86427	he	3351	" Flambeau , "
86430	86525	86427	86427	he	3351	" I can not prove it , even after hunting through the tombs . But I am sure of it . Let me add just one more tiny fact that tips the whole thing over . The colonel , by a strange chance , was one of the first struck by a bullet . He was struck long before the troops came to close quarters . But he saw St. Clare 's sword broken . Why was it broken ? How was it broken ? My friend , it was broken before the battle . "
86526	86529	86531	86532	his friend	3351	" Oh ! "
86541	86550	86531	86532	his friend	3351	" and pray where is the other piece ? "
86551	86557	86559	86560	the priest	374	" I can tell you , "
86563	86578	86559	86560	the priest	374	" In the northeast corner of the cemetery of the Protestant Cathedral at Belfast . "
86579	86582	86584	86585	the other	482	" Indeed ? "
86587	86594	86584	86585	the other	482	" Have you looked for it ? "
86595	86600	86602	86602	Brown	121	" I could n't , "
86608	86641	86602	86602	Brown	121	" There 's a great marble monument on top of it ; a monument to the heroic Major Murray , who fell fighting gloriously at the famous Battle of the Black River . "
86649	86653	86654	86654	he	111	" You mean , "
86658	86676	86654	86654	he	111	" that General St. Clare hated Murray , and murdered him on the field of battle because - "
86677	86688	86690	86691	the other	482	" You are still full of good and pure thoughts , "
86693	86700	86690	86691	the other	482	" It was worse than that . "
86701	86704	86706	86708	the large man	3032	" Well , "
86710	86720	86706	86708	the large man	3032	" my stock of evil imagination is used up . "
86737	86751	86733	86733	he	374	" Where would a wise man hide a leaf ? In the forest . "
86758	86788	86752	86753	The other	482	" If there were no forest , he would make a forest . And if he wished to hide a dead leaf , he would make a dead forest . "
86805	86830	86796	86797	the priest	374	" And if a man had to hide a dead body , he would make a field of dead bodies to hide it in . "
86860	87071	86853	86853	he	121	" Sir Arthur St. Clare , as I have already said , was a man who read his Bible . That was what was the matter with him . When will people understand that it is useless for a man to read his Bible unless he also reads everybody else 's Bible ? A printer reads a Bible for misprints . A Mormon reads his Bible , and finds polygamy ; a Christian Scientist reads his , and finds we have no arms and legs . St. Clare was an old Anglo - Indian Protestant soldier . Now , just think what that might mean ; and , for Heaven 's sake , do n't ca nt about it . It might mean a man physically formidable living under a tropic sun in an Oriental society , and soaking himself without sense or guidance in an Oriental Book . Of course , he read the Old Testament rather than the New . Of course , he found in the Old Testament anything that he wanted - lust , tyranny , treason . Oh , I dare say he was honest , as you call it . But what is the good of a man being honest in his worship of dishonesty ?
87072	87231	86853	86853	he	121	" In each of the hot and secret countries to which the man went he kept a harem , he tortured witnesses , he amassed shameful gold ; but certainly he would have said with steady eyes that he did it to the glory of the Lord . My own theology is sufficiently expressed by asking which Lord ? Anyhow , there is this about such evil , that it opens door after door in hell , and always into smaller and smaller chambers . This is the real case against crime , that a man does not become wilder and wilder , but only meaner and meaner . St. Clare was soon suffocated by difficulties of bribery and blackmail ; and needed more and more cash . And by the time of the Battle of the Black River he had fallen from world to world to that place which Dante makes the lowest floor of the universe . "
87232	87238	87240	87241	his friend	3351	" What do you mean ? "
87244	87249	87251	87252	the cleric	901	" I mean that , "
87269	87283	87251	87252	the cleric	901	" Do you remember whom Dante put in the last circle of ice ? "
87284	87288	87290	87290	Flambeau	111	" The traitors , "
87350	87669	87345	87346	The voice	3087	" Olivier , as you know , was quixotic , and would not permit a secret service and spies . The thing , however , was done , like many other things , behind his back . It was managed by my old friend Espado ; he was the bright - clad fop , whose hook nose got him called the Vulture . Posing as a sort of philanthropist at the front , he felt his way through the English Army , and at last got his fingers on its one corrupt man - please God ! - and that man at the top . St. Clare was in foul need of money , and mountains of it . The discredited family doctor was threatening those extraordinary exposures that afterwards began and were broken off ; tales of monstrous and prehistoric things in Park Lane ; things done by an English Evangelist that smelt like human sacrifice and hordes of slaves . Money was wanted , too , for his daughter 's dowry ; for to him the fame of wealth was as sweet as wealth itself . He snapped the last thread , whispered the word to Brazil , and wealth poured in from the enemies of England . But another man had talked to Espado the Vulture as well as he . Somehow the dark , grim young major from Ulster had guessed the hideous truth ; and when they walked slowly together down that road towards the bridge Murray was telling the general that he must resign instantly , or be court - martialled and shot . The general temporised with him till they came to the fringe of tropic trees by the bridge ; and there by the singing river and the sunlit palms for I can see the picture the general drew his sabre and plunged it through the body of the major . "
87732	87937	87721	87721	He	111	" St. Clare was a hell - hound , but he was a hound of breed . Never , I 'll swear , was he so lucid and so strong as when poor Murray lay a cold lump at his feet . Never in all his triumphs , as Captain Keith said truly , was the great man so great as he was in this last world - despised defeat . He looked coolly at his weapon to wipe off the blood ; he saw the point he had planted between his victim 's shoulders had broken off in the body . He saw quite calmly , as through a club windowpane , all that must follow . He saw that men must find the unaccountable corpse ; must extract the unaccountable sword - point ; must notice the unaccountable broken sword - or absence of sword . He had killed , but not silenced . But his imperious intellect rose against the facer ; there was one way yet . He could make the corpse less unaccountable . He could create a hill of corpses to cover this one . In twenty minutes eight hundred English soldiers were marching down to their death . "
87975	88114	87967	87967	he	121	" Such was the valour of that English thousand , and such the genius of their commander , that if they had at once attacked the hill , even their mad march might have met some luck . But the evil mind that played with them like pawns had other aims and reasons . They must remain in the marshes by the bridge at least till British corpses should be a common sight there . Then for the last grand scene ; the silver - haired soldier - saint would give up his shattered sword to save further slaughter . Oh , it was well organised for an impromptu . But I think I can not prove , I think that it was while they stuck there in the bloody mire that someone doubted - and someone guessed . "
88125	88154	88115	88115	He	3090	" There is a voice from nowhere that tells me the man who guessed was the lover ... the man to we d the old man 's child . "
88155	88164	88166	88166	Flambeau	111	" But what about Olivier and the hanging ? "
88168	88186	88188	88189	the narrator	3042	" Olivier , partly from chivalry , partly from policy , seldom encumbered his march with captives , "
88191	88205	88188	88189	the narrator	3042	" He released everybody in most cases . He released everybody in this case .
88206	88212	88214	88216	the tall man	2771	" Everybody but the general , "
88218	88221	88223	88224	the priest	374	" Everybody , "
88232	88241	88242	88242	he	111	" I do n't grasp it all yet , "
88245	88253	88255	88255	Brown	121	" There is another picture , Flambeau , "
88262	88449	88255	88255	Brown	121	" I ca n't prove it ; but I can do more - I can see it . There is a camp breaking up on the bare , torrid hills at morning , and Brazilian uniforms massed in blocks and columns to march . There is the red shirt and long black beard of Olivier , which blows as he stands , his broad - brimmed hat in his hand . He is saying farewell to the great enemy he is setting free - the simple , snow - headed English veteran , who thanks him in the name of his men . The English remnant stand behind at attention ; beside them are stores and vehicles for the retreat . The drums roll ; the Brazilians are moving ; the English are still like statues . So they abide till the last hum and flash of the enemy have faded from the tropic horizon . Then they alter their postures all at once , like dead men coming to life ; they turn their fifty faces upon the general - faces not to be forgotten . "
88456	88459	88460	88460	he	111	" Ah , "
88463	88469	88460	88460	he	111	" you do n't mean - "
88470	88473	88475	88476	Father Brown	121	" Yes , "
88484	88584	88475	88476	Father Brown	121	" It was an English hand that put the rope round St. Clare 's neck ; I believe the hand that put the ring on his daughter 's finger . They were English hands that dragged him up to the tree of shame ; the hands of men that had adored him and followed him to victory . And they were English souls God pardon and endure us all ! who stared at him swinging in that foreign sun on the green gallows of palm , and prayed in their hatred that he might drop off it into hell . "
88651	88659	88661	88662	Father Brown	121	" I need not tell you more , "
88664	88737	88661	88662	Father Brown	121	" They tried him in the wilderness and destroyed him ; and then , for the honour of England and of his daughter , they took an oath to seal up for ever the story of the traitor 's purse and the assassin 's sword blade . Perhaps - Heaven help them - they tried to forget it . Let us try to forget it , anyhow ; here is our inn . "
88738	88744	88746	88746	Flambeau	111	" With all my heart , "
88769	88779	88780	88780	he	111	" Look there , in the devil 's name ! "
88819	88827	88898	88899	the priest	374	" The Sign of the Broken Sword . "
88828	88834	88836	88837	Father Brown	121	" Were you not prepared ? "
88840	88864	88836	88837	Father Brown	121	" He is the god of this country ; half the inns and parks and streets are named after him and his story . "
88865	88875	88877	88877	Flambeau	111	" I thought we had done with the leper , "
88885	88896	88898	88899	the priest	374	" You will never have done with him in England , "
88904	89098	88898	88899	the priest	374	" while brass is strong and stone abides . His marble statues will erect the souls of proud , innocent boys for centuries , his village tomb will smell of loyalty as of lilies . Millions who never knew him shall love him like a father - this man whom the last few that knew him dealt with like dung . He shall be a saint ; and the truth shall never be told of him , because I have made up my mind at last . There is so much good and evil in breaking secrets , that I put my conduct to a test . All these newspapers will perish ; the anti - Brazil boom is already over ; Olivier is already honoured everywhere . But I told myself that if anywhere , by name , in metal or marble that will endure like the pyramids , Colonel Clancy , or Captain Keith , or President Olivier , or any innocent man was wrongly blamed , then I would speak . If it were only that St. Clare was wrongly praised , I would be silent . And I will . "
89176	89183	89185	89186	Father Brown	121	" Come , it 's cold , "
89188	89197	89185	89186	Father Brown	121	" let 's have some wine or beer . "
89198	89202	89204	89204	Flambeau	111	" Or brandy , "
89367	89370	89388	89388	he	223	" loud laughter "
89769	89772	89728	89728	him	223	" Murder ! "
90218	90226	90228	90229	Mr. Merton	302	" As far as I can see , "
90232	90330	90228	90229	Mr. Merton	302	" there is no sense to be made of it at all . There is nobody one can suspect . Magnus is a solemn old fool ; far too much of a fool to be an assassin . Royce has been the baronet 's best friend for years ; and his daughter undoubtedly adored him . Besides , it 's all too absurd . Who would kill such a cheery old chap as Armstrong ? Who could dip his hands in the gore of an after - dinner speaker ? It would be like killing Father Christmas . "
90331	90340	90342	90343	Father Brown	121	" Yes , it was a cheery house , "
90345	90368	90342	90343	Father Brown	121	" It was a cheery house while he was alive . Do you think it will be cheery now he is dead ? "
90382	90388	90389	90389	he	302	" Now he is dead ? "
90392	90395	90397	90398	the priest	374	" Yes , "
90401	90425	90397	90398	the priest	374	" he was cheerful . But did he communicate his cheerfulness ? Frankly , was anyone else in the house cheerful but he ? "
90787	90791	90793	90794	Father Brown	121	" You see , "
90799	90847	90848	90848	he	121	" I 'm not sure that the Armstrong cheerfulness is so very cheerful - for other people . You say that nobody could kill such a happy old man , but I 'm not sure ; ne nos inducas in tentationem . If ever I murdered somebody , "
90853	90863	90848	90848	he	121	" I dare say it might be an Optimist . "
90864	90867	90869	90869	Merton	302	" Why ? "
90872	90880	90869	90869	Merton	302	" Do you think people dislike cheerfulness ? "
90881	90887	90889	90890	Father Brown	121	" People like frequent laughter , "
90892	90913	90889	90890	Father Brown	121	" but I do n't think they like a permanent smile . Cheerfulness without humour is a very trying thing . "
90965	90999	90946	90947	Father Brown	121	" Of course , drink is neither good nor bad in itself . But I ca n't help sometimes feeling that men like Armstrong want an occasional glass of wine to sadden them . "
91125	91140	91107	91108	Meanwhile Merton	302	" Well , Mr. Gilder , have you got much farther with the mystery ? "
91141	91147	91152	91152	he	305	" There is no mystery , "
91161	91173	91175	91175	Merton	302	" Well , there is for me , at any rate , "
91179	91188	91190	91192	the senior investigator	3203	" It is simple enough , my boy , "
91201	91235	91190	91192	the senior investigator	3203	" Three minutes after you 'd gone for Mr. Royce 's parson the whole thing came out . You know that pasty - faced servant in the black gloves who stopped the train ? "
91236	91251	91152	91152	he	305	" I should know him anywhere . Somehow he rather gave me the creeps . "
91252	91255	91257	91257	Gilder	305	" Well , "
91259	91297	91257	91257	Gilder	305	" when the train had gone on again , that man had gone too . Rather a cool criminal , do n't you think , to escape by the very train that went off for the police ? "
91298	91307	91309	91311	the young man	1294	" You 're pretty sure , I suppose , "
91313	91322	91309	91311	the young man	1294	" that he really did kill his master ? "
91323	91334	91336	91336	Gilder	305	" Yes , my son , I 'm pretty sure , "
91339	91421	91336	91336	Gilder	305	" for the trifling reason that he has gone off with twenty thousand pounds in papers that were in his master 's desk . No , the only thing worth calling a difficulty is how he killed him . The skull seems broken as with some big weapon , but there 's no weapon at all lying about , and the murderer would have found it awkward to carry it away , unless the weapon was too small to be noticed . "
91422	91433	91435	91436	the priest	374	" Perhaps the weapon was too big to be noticed , "
91461	91471	91473	91474	Father Brown	121	" Silly way of putting it , I know , "
91477	91525	91473	91474	Father Brown	121	" Sounds like a fairy tale . But poor Armstrong was killed with a giant 's club , a great green club , too big to be seen , and which we call the earth . He was broken against this green bank we are standing on . "
91526	91532	91534	91535	the detective	420	" How do you mean ? "
91584	91590	91591	91591	he	121	" Do n't you see , "
91602	91610	91591	91591	he	121	" he was thrown down from there ? "
91621	91642	91611	91611	Gilder	305	" Well , it is certainly possible . But I do n't see why you are so sure about it . "
91650	91653	91654	91654	he	121	" Why , "
91657	91690	91654	91654	he	121	" there 's a bit of rope round the dead man 's leg . Do n't you see that other bit of rope up there caught at the corner of the window ? "
91714	91722	91723	91723	he	121	" You 're quite right , sir , "
91729	91737	91723	91723	he	121	" that is certainly one to you . "
91782	91791	91793	91793	Gilder	305	" By Jove ! they 've got him , "
91804	91811	91812	91812	he	121	" Have you got the money ! "
91834	91837	91819	91820	The man	315	" No . "
91842	91849	91839	91839	he	315	" At least , not here . "
91850	91858	91860	91863	the man called Magnus	3220	" Which is the inspector , please ? "
91928	91930	91950	91950	his	299	" rescued "
92002	92010	92011	92011	he	299	" I always knew this would happen , "
92018	92043	92011	92011	he	299	" My poor old master made game of me for wearing black ; but I always said I should be ready for his funeral . "
92058	92061	92063	92064	Inspector Gilder	307	" Sergeant , "
92073	92089	92063	92064	Inspector Gilder	307	" are n't you putting the bracelets on this fellow ; he looks pretty dangerous . "
92090	92095	92097	92098	the sergeant	3228	" Well , sir , "
92108	92117	92097	92098	the sergeant	3228	" I do n't know that we can . "
92118	92124	92126	92127	the other	482	" What do you mean ? "
92130	92137	92126	92127	the other	482	" Have n't you arrested him ? "
92162	92167	92169	92170	the sergeant	3228	" We arrested him , "
92173	92203	92169	92170	the sergeant	3228	" just as he was coming out of the police station at Highgate , where he had deposited all his master 's money in the care of Inspector Robinson . "
92215	92224	92225	92225	he	307	" Why on earth did you do that ? "
92230	92242	92244	92245	that person	3233	" To keep it safe from the criminal , of course , "
92248	92251	92253	92253	Gilder	307	" Surely , "
92255	92271	92253	92253	Gilder	307	" Sir Aaron 's money might have been safely left with Sir Aaron 's family . "
92326	92340	92314	92314	Magnus	299	" I have no reason to feel confidence in Sir Aaron 's family . "
92415	92422	92424	92424	Royce	306	" Be careful what you say , "
92427	92434	92424	92424	Royce	306	" you 'll frighten Miss Armstrong . "
92435	92440	92442	92447	the man with the clear voice	3240	" I hope so , "
92462	92553	92458	92458	he	302	" I am somewhat used to Miss Armstrong 's tremors . I have seen her trembling off and on for years . And some said she was shaking with cold and some she was shaking with fear , but I know she was shaking with hate and wicked anger - fiends that have had their feast this morning . She would have been away by now with her lover and all the money but for me . Ever since my poor old master prevented her from marrying that tipsy blackguard - "
92554	92557	92559	92559	Gilder	307	" Stop , "
92563	92587	92559	92559	Gilder	307	" We have nothing to do with your family fancies or suspicions . Unless you have some practical evidence , your mere opinions - "
92588	92598	92604	92604	his	299	" Oh ! I 'll give you practical evidence , "
92608	92682	92683	92683	He	299	" You 'll have to subpoena me , Mr. Inspector , and I shall have to tell the truth . And the truth is this : An instant after the old man was pitched bleeding out of the window , I ran into the attic , and found his daughter swooning on the floor with a red dagger still in her hand . Allow me to hand that also to the proper authorities . "
92751	92763	92746	92746	he	299	" Surely you would take Miss Armstrong 's word against his ? "
92785	92788	92789	92789	he	121	" Yes , "
92795	92805	92789	92789	he	121	" but is Miss Armstrong 's word against his ? "
92857	92861	92863	92864	Mr. Gilder	305	" This man , "
92867	92884	92863	92864	Mr. Gilder	305	" actually says that you were found grasping a knife , insensible , after the murder . "
92885	92891	92893	92893	Alice	301	" He says the truth , "
92922	92941	92909	92909	his	300	" Well , if I 've got to go , I 'll have a bit of pleasure first . "
93007	93015	93016	93016	Gilder	305	" None of that , Mr. Royce , "
93022	93030	93016	93016	Gilder	305	" I shall arrest you for assault . "
93031	93038	93040	93041	the secretary	3187	" No , you wo n't , "
93050	93058	93040	93041	the secretary	3187	" you will arrest me for murder . "
93095	93101	93090	93090	he	305	" What do you mean ? "
93102	93113	93115	93115	Royce	300	" It is quite true , as this fellow says , "
93117	93146	93115	93115	Royce	300	" that Miss Armstrong fainted with a knife in her hand . But she had not snatched the knife to attack her father , but to defend him . "
93147	93152	93154	93154	Gilder	305	" To defend him , "
93157	93161	93154	93154	Gilder	305	" Against whom ? "
93162	93166	93168	93169	the secretary	3187	" Against me , "
93190	93203	93183	93183	she	301	" After it all , I am still glad you are brave . "
93204	93208	93210	93211	Patrick Royce	300	" Come upstairs , "
93214	93225	93210	93211	Patrick Royce	300	" and I will show you the whole cursed thing . "
93332	93337	93339	93339	Royce	300	" I was drunk , "
93361	93368	93369	93369	he	300	" You all know about me , "
93373	93559	93369	93369	he	300	" everybody knows how my story began , and it may as well end like that too . I was called a clever man once , and might have been a happy one ; Armstrong saved the remains of a brain and body from the taverns , and was always kind to me in his own way , poor fellow ! Only he would n't let me marry Alice here ; and it will always be said that he was right enough . Well , you can form your own conclusions , and you wo n't want me to go into details . That is my whisky bottle half emptied in the corner ; that is my revolver quite emptied on the carpet . It was the rope from my box that was found on the corpse , and it was from my window the corpse was thrown . You need not set detectives to grub up my tragedy ; it is a common enough weed in this world . I give myself to the gallows ; and , by God , that is enough ! "
93658	93662	93663	93663	he	121	" I say , "
93669	93743	93663	93663	he	121	" this really wo n't do at all , you know . At the beginning you said we 'd found no weapon . But now we 're finding too many ; there 's the knife to stab , and the rope to strangle , and the pistol to shoot ; and after all he broke his neck by falling out of a window ! It wo n't do . It 's not economical . "
93785	93861	93773	93778	the grotesque figure on the floor	3266	" And now three quite impossible things . First , these holes in the carpet , where the six bullets have gone in . Why on earth should anybody fire at the carpet ? A drunken man lets fly at his enemy 's head , the thing that 's grinning at him . He does n't pick a quarrel with his feet , or lay siege to his slippers . And then there 's the rope "
93888	93986	93885	93885	his	1175	" in what conceivable intoxication would anybody try to put a rope round a man 's neck and finally put it round his leg ? Royce , anyhow , was not so drunk as that , or he would be sleeping like a log by now . And , plainest of all , the whisky bottle . You suggest a dipsomaniac fought for the whisky bottle , and then having won , rolled it away in a corner , spilling one half and leaving the other . That is the very last thing a dipsomaniac would do . "
94008	94025	93987	93987	He	1175	" I 'm awfully sorry , my dear sir , but your tale is really rubbish . "
94026	94029	94031	94032	Alice Armstrong	301	" Sir , "
94041	94052	94031	94032	Alice Armstrong	301	" can I speak to you alone for a moment ? "
94082	94089	94090	94090	she	825	" You are a clever man , "
94093	94138	94090	94090	she	825	" and you are trying to save Patrick , I know . But it 's no use . The core of all this is black , and the more things you find out the more there will be against the miserable man I love . "
94139	94142	94144	94144	Brown	121	" Why ? "
94151	94154	94155	94155	she	825	" Because , "
94160	94169	94155	94155	she	825	" I saw him commit the crime myself . "
94170	94173	94175	94177	the unmoved Brown	121	" Ah ! "
94179	94186	94175	94177	the unmoved Brown	121	" and what did he do ? "
94187	94197	94198	94198	she	825	" I was in this room next to them , "
94201	94384	94198	94198	she	825	" both doors were closed , but I suddenly heard a voice , such as I had never heard on earth , roaring ` Hell , hell , hell , ' again and again , and then the two doors shook with the first explosion of the revolver . Thrice again the thing banged before I got the two doors open and found the room full of smoke ; but the pistol was smoking in my poor , mad Patrick 's hand ; and I saw him fire the last murderous volley with my own eyes . Then he leapt on my father , who was clinging in terror to the window - sill , and , grappling , tried to strangle him with the rope , which he threw over his head , but which slipped over his struggling shoulders to his feet . Then it tightened round one leg and Patrick dragged him along like a maniac . I snatched a knife from the mat , and , rushing between them , managed to cut the rope before I fainted . "
94385	94389	94391	94392	Father Brown	121	" I see , "
94400	94404	94391	94392	Father Brown	121	" Thank you . "
94449	94474	94442	94442	he	374	" Might I say a word to the prisoner in your presence ; and might he take off those funny cuffs for a minute ? "
94475	94483	94485	94485	Merton	302	" He is a very powerful man , "
94490	94499	94485	94485	Merton	302	" Why do you want them taken off ? "
94500	94506	94508	94509	the priest	374	" Why , I thought , "
94512	94528	94508	94509	the priest	374	" that perhaps I might have the very great honour of shaking hands with him . "
94538	94549	94534	94535	Father Brown	121	" Wo n't you tell them about it , sir ? "
94566	94571	94572	94572	he	374	" Then I will , "
94575	94601	94572	94572	he	374	" Private lives are more important than public reputations . I am going to save the living , and let the dead bury their dead . "
94620	94693	94754	94755	the priest	374	" I told you that in this case there were too many weapons and only one death . I tell you now that they were not weapons , and were not used to cause death . All those grisly tools , the noose , the bloody knife , the exploding pistol , were instruments of a curious mercy . They were not used to kill Sir Aaron , but to save him . "
94694	94699	94701	94701	Gilder	307	" To save him ! "
94703	94708	94701	94701	Gilder	307	" And from what ? "
94709	94713	94715	94716	Father Brown	121	" From himself , "
94718	94725	94715	94716	Father Brown	121	" He was a suicidal maniac . "
94726	94729	94731	94731	Merton	302	" What ? "
94737	94744	94731	94731	Merton	302	" And the Religion of Cheerfulness - "
94745	94752	94754	94755	the priest	374	" It is a cruel religion , "
94763	95104	94754	94755	the priest	374	" Why could n't they let him weep a little , like his fathers before him ? His plans stiffened , his views grew cold ; behind that merry mask was the empty mind of the atheist . At last , to keep up his hilarious public level , he fell back on that dram - drinking he had abandoned long ago . But there is this horror about alcoholism in a sincere teetotaler : that he pictures and expects that psychological inferno from which he has warned others . It leapt upon poor Armstrong prematurely , and by this morning he was in such a case that he sat here and cried he was in hell , in so crazy a voice that his daughter did not know it . He was mad for death , and with the monkey tricks of the mad he had scattered round him death in many shapes - a running noose and his friend 's revolver and a knife . Royce entered accidentally and acted in a flash . He flung the knife on the mat behind him , snatched up the revolver , and having no time to unload it , emptied it shot after shot all over the floor . The suicide saw a fourth shape of death , and made a dash for the window . The rescuer did the only thing he could - ran after him with the rope and tried to tie him hand and foot . Then it was that the unlucky girl ran in , and misunderstanding the struggle , strove to slash her father free . At first she only slashed poor Royce 's knuckles , from which has come all the little blood in this affair . But , of course , you noticed that he left blood , but no wound , on that servant 's face ? Only before the poor woman swooned , she did hack her father loose , so that he went crashing through that window into eternity . "
95130	95156	95127	95127	he	300	" I think I should have told the truth , sir . You and the young lady are worth more than Armstrong 's obituary notices . "
95157	95163	95165	95165	Royce	300	" Confound Armstrong 's notices , "
95168	95181	95165	95165	Royce	300	" Do n't you see it was because she must n't know ? "
95182	95188	95190	95190	Merton	302	" Must n't know what ? "
95192	95204	95206	95207	the other	482	" Why , that she killed her father , you fool ! "
95209	95228	95206	95207	the other	482	" He 'd have been alive now but for her . It might craze her to know that . "
95229	95239	95245	95245	he	121	" No , I do n't think it would , "
95251	95295	95245	95245	he	121	" I rather think I should tell her . Even the most murderous blunders do n't poison life like sins ; anyhow , I think you may both be the happier now . I 've got to go back to the Deaf School . "
95314	95328	95305	95308	an acquaintance from Highgate	3284	" The Coroner has arrived . The inquiry is just going to begin . "
95329	95341	95343	95344	Father Brown	121	" I 've got to get back to the Deaf School , "
95346	95358	95343	95344	Father Brown	121	" I 'm sorry I ca n't stop for the inquiry . "
