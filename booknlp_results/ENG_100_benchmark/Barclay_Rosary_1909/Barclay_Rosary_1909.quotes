I 've jolly well made up my mind to send no more bouquets to Tou - Tou . Hang it , boys ! You ca n't see yourself at champagne suppers with a dancing - woman , when you 've walked round the links , on a day like this , with the Honourable Jane . She drives like a rifle shot , and when she lofts , you 'd think the ball was a swallow ; and beat me three holes up and never mentioned it . By Jove , a fellow wants to have a clean bill when he shakes hands with her ! "

4156	4187	4153	4154	some one	503	" I wish to goodness they would hang this tree with Chinese lanterns and , have it out here . It is too hot to face a crowded function indoors . "
4188	4196	4198	4199	Garth Dalmain	111	" Oh , that 's all right , "
4201	4276	4198	4199	Garth Dalmain	111	" I 'm stage - manager , you know ; and I can promise you that all the long windows opening on to the terrace shall stand wide . So no one need be in the concert - room , who prefers to stop outside . There will be a row of lounge chairs placed on the terrace near the windows . You wo n't see much ; but you will hear , perfectly . "
4277	4288	4290	4294	one of the tennis girls	504	" Ah , but half the fun is in seeing , "
4296	4341	4290	4294	one of the tennis girls	504	" People who have remained on the terrace will miss all the point of it afterwards when the dear duchess shows us how everybody did it . I do n't care how hot it is . Book me a seat in the front row ! "
4342	4352	4354	4355	Lady Ingleby	112	" Who is the surprise packet to - night ? "

4371	4482	4368	4369	Mary Strathern	114	" She is coming for the week - end , and delightful it will be to have her . No one but the duchess could have worked it , and no place but Overdene would have tempted her . She will sing only one song at the concert ; but she is sure to break forth later on , and give us plenty . We will persuade Jane to drift to the piano accidentally and play over , just by chance , the opening bars of some of Velma 's best things , and we shall soon hear the magic voice . She never can resist a perfectly played accompaniment . "
4483	4494	4496	4497	a girl	437	" Why call Madame Velma the ` surprise packet ' ? "

4512	4518	4520	4521	Lady Ingleby	112	" That , my dear , "
4523	4777	4520	4521	Lady Ingleby	112	" is a little joke of the duchess 's . This concert is arranged for the amusement of her house party , and for the gratification and glorification of local celebrities . The whole neighbourhood is invited . None of you are asked to perform , but local celebrities are . In fact they furnish the entire programme , to their own delight , the satisfaction of their friends and relatives , and our entertainment , particularly afterwards when the duchess takes us through every item , with original notes , comments , and impersonations . Oh , Dal ! Do you remember when she tucked a sheet of white writing - paper into her tea - gown for a dog collar , and took off the high - church curate nervously singing a comic song ? Then at the very end , you see and really some of it is quite good for amateurs she trots out Velma , or some equally perfect artiste , to show them how it really can be done ; and suddenly the place is full of music , and a great hush falls on the audience , and the poor complacent amateurs realise that the noise they have been making was , after all , not music ; and they go dumbly home . But they have forgotten all about it by the following year ; or a fresh contingent of willing performers steps into the breach . The duchess 's little joke always comes off . "
4778	4788	4790	4792	young Ronald Ingram	117	" The Honourable Jane does not approve of it , "
4794	4902	4790	4792	young Ronald Ingram	117	" therefore she is generally given marching orders and departs to her next visit before the event . But no one can accompany Madame Velma so perfectly , so this time she is commanded to stay . But I doubt if the ' surprise packet ' will come off with quite such a shock as usual , and I am certain the fun wo n't be so good afterwards . The Honourable Jane has been known to jump on the duchess for that sort of thing . She is safe to get the worst of it at the time , but it has a restraining effect afterwards . "
4903	4912	4914	4919	a bright - faced American girl	507	" I think Miss Champion is quite right , "
4945	4971	4790	4792	young Ronald Ingram	117	" In my country we should call it real mean to laugh , at people who had been our guests and performed in our houses . "

4985	4991	4982	4983	Myra Ingleby	119	" you have no duchesses . "
4992	5004	5006	5008	the American girl	508	" Well , we supply you with quite a good few , "
5035	5042	5044	5044	someone	509	" Where is the Honourable Jane ? "

5057	5064	5054	5055	Ronald Ingram	117	" Ah , here they come . "
5308	5319	5321	5324	one of the men	517	" What did you go round in , Miss Champion ? "
5326	5331	5333	5333	Jane	101	" My ordinary clothes , "
5348	5353	5344	5344	Billy	108	" She went round in "
5354	5362	5364	5364	Jane	101	" Oh , be quiet , Billy , "
5366	5435	5364	5364	Jane	101	" You and I are practically the only golf maniacs present . Most of these dear people are even ignorant as to who ' bogie ' is , or why we should be so proud of beating him . Where is my aunt ? Poor Simmons was toddling all over the place when we went in to put away our clubs , searching for her with a telegram . "
5436	5444	5446	5446	Myra	119	" Why did n't you open it ? "
5448	5498	5446	5446	Myra	119	" Because my aunt never allows her telegrams to be opened . She loves shocks ; and there is always the possibility of a telegram containing startling news . She says it completely spoils it if some one else knows it first , and breaks it to her gently . "
5499	5505	5507	5508	Garth Dalmain	111	" Here comes the duchess , "
5526	5533	5535	5535	Jane	101	" Do not mention the telegram , "
5537	5583	5535	5535	Jane	101	" It would not please her that I should even know of its arrival . It would be a shame to take any of the bloom off the unexpected delight of a wire on this hot day , when nothing unusual seemed likely to happen . "
5710	5716	5717	5717	she	304	" There , good people ! "
5723	6004	5717	5717	she	304	" Help yourselves , and let me see you all wearing roses to - night . And the concert - room is to be a bower of roses . We will call it ' LA FETE DES ROSES . ' ... No , thank you , Ronnie . That tea has been made half an hour at least , and you ought to love me too well to press it upon me . Besides , I never take tea . I have a whiskey and soda when I wake from my nap , and that sustains me until dinner . Oh yes , my dear Myra , I know I came to your interesting meeting , and signed that excellent pledge ' POUR ENCOURAGER LES AUTRES ' ; but I drove straight to my doctor when I left your house , and he gave me a certificate to say I MUST take something when I needed it ; and I always need it when I wake from my nap .... Really , Dal , it is positively wicked for any man , off the stage , to look as picturesque as you do , in that pale violet shirt , and dark violet tie , and those white flannels . If I were your grandmother I should send you in to take them off . If you turn the heads of old dowagers such as I am , what chance have all these chickens ? ... Hush , Tommy ! That was a very naughty word ! And you need not be jealous of Dal . I admire you still more . Dal , will you paint my scarlet macaw ? "
6061	6067	6068	6068	he	529	" No , dear Duchess , "
6071	6269	6068	6068	he	529	" I beg respectfully to decline the commission , Tommy would require a Landseer to do full justice to his attitudes and expression . Besides , it would be demoralising to an innocent and well - brought - up youth , such as you know me to be , to spend long hours in Tommy 's society , listening to the remarks that sweet bird would make while I painted him . But I will tell you what I will do . I will paint you , dear Duchess , only not in that hat ! Ever since I was quite a small boy , a straw hat with black ribbons tied under the chin has made me feel ill . If I yielded to my natural impulses now , I should hide my face in Miss Champion 's lap , and kick and scream until you took it off . I will paint you in the black velvet gown you wore last night , with the Medici collar ; and the jolly arrangement of lace and diamonds on your head . And in your hand you shall hold an antique crystal mirror , mounted in silver . "
6332	6357	6328	6328	they	533	" Ah , there it is ! just as we saw it that day , before a stroke of it was on the canvas . "
6358	6518	6328	6328	they	533	" In your left hand , you shall hold the mirror , but you shall not be looking into it ; because you never look into mirrors , dear Duchess , excepting to see whether the scolding you are giving your maid , as she stands behind you , is making her cry ; and whether that is why she is being so clumsy in her manipulation of pins and things . If it is , you promptly promise her a day off , to go and see her old mother ; and pay her journey there and back . If it is n't , you scold her some more . Were I the maid , I should always cry , large tears warranted to show in the glass ; only I should not sniff , because sniffing is so intensely aggravating ; and I should be most frightfully careful that my tears did not run down your neck . "
6519	6526	6528	6529	the duchess	304	" Dal , you ridiculous CHILD ! "
6531	6563	6528	6529	the duchess	304	" Leave off talking about my maids , and my neck , and your crocodile tears , and finish describing the portrait . What do I do , with the mirror ? "
6564	6572	6574	6575	Garth Dalmain	111	" You do not look into it , "
6579	6822	6574	6575	Garth Dalmain	111	" because we KNOW that is a thing you never do . Even when you put on that hat , and tie those ribbons Miss Champion , I wish you would hold my hand in a bow under your chin , you do n't consult the mirror . But you shall sit with it in your left hand , your elbow resting on an Eastern table of black ebony inlaid with mother - of - pearl . You will turn it from you , so that it reflects something exactly in front of you in the imaginary foreground . You will be looking at this unseen object with an expression of sublime affection . And in the mirror I will paint a vivid , brilliant , complete reflection , minute , but perfect in every detail , of your scarlet macaw on his perch . We will call it ' Reflections , ' because one must always give a silly up - to - date title to pictures , and just now one nondescript word is the fashion , unless you feel it needful to attract to yourself the eye of the public , in the catalogue , by calling your picture twenty lines of Tennyson . But when the portrait goes down to posterity as a famous picture , it will figure in the catalogue of the National Gallery as ' The Duchess , the Mirror , and the Macaw . ' "
6823	6826	6828	6829	the duchess	304	" Bravo ! "
6833	6858	6828	6829	the duchess	304	" You shall paint it , Dal , in time for next year 's Academy , and we will all go and see it . "
6876	6897	6873	6873	they	539	" Ah , of course ! There it is ; just as we saw it under the cedar at Overdene . "
6898	6908	6910	6911	the duchess	304	" Here comes Simmons with something on a salver , "
6913	6991	6910	6911	the duchess	304	" How that man waddles ! Why ca n't somebody teach him to step out ? Jane ! You march across this lawn like a grenadier . Ca n't you explain to Simmons how it 's done ? ... Well ? What is it ? Ha ! A telegram . Now what horrible thing can have happened ? Who would like to guess ? I hope it is not merely some idiot who has missed a train . "
7066	7069	7071	7072	the duchess	304	" Creature ! "
7077	7129	7071	7072	the duchess	304	" Oh , creature ! This comes of asking them as friends . And I had a lovely string of pearls for her , worth far more than she would have been offered , professionally , for one song . And to fail at the last minute ! Oh , CREATURE ! "
7130	7134	7136	7136	Jane	101	" Dear aunt , "
7138	7172	7136	7136	Jane	101	" if poor Madame Velma has a sudden attack of laryngitis , she could not possibly sing a note , even had the Queen commanded her . Her telegram is full of regrets . "
7173	7180	7182	7183	the duchess	304	" Do n't argue , Jane ! "
7187	7293	7182	7183	the duchess	304	" And do n't drag in the Queen , who has nothing to do with my concert or Velma 's throat . I do abominate irrelevance , and you know it ! WHY must she have her what do you call it , just when she was coming to sing here ? In my young days people never had these new - fangled complaints . I have no patience with all this appendicitis and what not cutting people open at every possible excuse . In my young days we called it a good old - fashioned stomach - ache , and gave them Turkey rhubarb ! "
7311	7322	7305	7306	Garth Dalmain	111	" I do abominate irrelevance , and you know it ! "
7336	7342	7329	7329	him	111	" Tommy wants a gooseberry ! "
7355	7364	7366	7368	the worried duchess	546	" Oh , give it him , somebody ! "
7370	7374	7376	7376	Jane	101	" Dear aunt , "
7378	7384	7376	7376	Jane	101	" there are no gooseberries . "
7385	7392	7394	7395	the duchess	304	" Do n't argue , girl ! "
7410	7429	7400	7400	Garth	111	" When he says ' gooseberry , ' he means anything GREEN , as you very well know ! "
7474	7480	7482	7483	the duchess	304	" No answer , Simmons , "
7485	7563	7482	7483	the duchess	304	" Why do n't you go ? ... Oh , how that man waddles ! Teach him to walk , somebody ! Now the question is , What is to be done ? Here is half the county coming to hear Velma , by my invitation ; and Velma in London pretending to have appendicitis no , I mean the other thing . Oh , ' drat the woman ! ' as that clever bird would say . "
7564	7569	7571	7571	Tommy	100	" Hold your jaw ! "
7583	7589	7591	7591	Garth	111	" But , dear Duchess , "
7598	7637	7591	7591	Garth	111	" the county does not know Madame Velma was to be here . It was a profound secret . You were to trot her out at the end . Lady Ingleby called her your ' surprise packet . ' "
7655	7659	7660	7660	she	119	" Quite true , "
7663	7676	7660	7660	she	119	" That was the lovely part of it . Oh , creature ! "
7677	7683	7685	7685	Garth	111	" But , dear Duchess , "
7688	7751	7685	7685	Garth	111	" if the county did not know , the county will not be disappointed . They are coming to listen to one another , and to hear themselves , and to enjoy your claret - cup and ices . All this they will do , and go away delighted , saying how cleverly the dear duchess , discovers and exploits local talent . "
7752	7757	7759	7760	the duchess	304	" Ah , ha ! "
7796	7799	7779	7783	Mrs. Parker Bangs of Chicago	124	" genuine Plantagenet "
7800	7839	7779	7783	Mrs. Parker Bangs of Chicago	124	" but they will go away wise in their own conceits , and satisfied with their own mediocre performances . My idea is to let them do it , and then show them how it should be done . "

7919	7922	7924	7925	the duchess	304	" Jane , "
7927	7942	7924	7925	the duchess	304	" for the third time this afternoon I must request you not to argue . "
7943	7947	7949	7950	Garth Dalmain	111	" Miss Champion , "
7952	7966	7949	7950	Garth Dalmain	111	" if I were your grandmamma , I should send you to bed . "
7967	7974	7976	7977	the duchess	304	" What is to be done ? "
7979	8033	7976	7977	the duchess	304	" She was to sing THE ROSARY . I had set my heart on it . The whole decoration of the room is planned to suit that song festoons of white roses ; and a great red - cross at the back of the platform , made entirely of crimson ramblers . Jane ! "
8034	8039	7949	7950	Garth Dalmain	111	" Yes , aunt . "
8040	8064	7976	7977	the duchess	304	" Oh , do n't say ' Yes , aunt , ' in that senseless way ! Ca n't you make some suggestion ? "
8065	8070	8072	8072	Tommy	100	" Drat the woman ! "
8076	8083	8085	8086	the duchess	304	" Hark to that sweet bird ! "
8094	8111	8085	8086	the duchess	304	" Give him a strawberry , somebody . Now , Jane , what do you suggest ? "
8206	8232	8189	8189	She	101	" I will sing THE ROSARY for you , in Velma 's place , to - night , if you really wish it , aunt . "

8318	8324	8326	8326	her	304	" Have you the song ? "
8342	8346	8348	8348	Jane	101	" I have , "
8350	8409	8348	8348	Jane	101	" I spent a few hours with Madame Blanche when I was in town last month ; and she , who so rarely admires these modern songs , was immensely taken with it . She sang it , and allowed me to accompany her . We spent nearly an hour over it . I obtained a copy afterwards . "
8410	8413	8415	8416	the duchess	304	" Good , "
8418	8513	8415	8416	the duchess	304	" Then I count on you . Now I must send a sympathetic telegram to that poor dear Velma , who will be fretting at having to fail us . So ' au revoir , ' good people . Remember , we dine punctually at eight o'clock . Music is supposed to begin at nine . Ronnie , be a kind boy , and carry Tommy into the hall for me . He will screech so fearfully if he sees me walk away without him . He is so very loving , dear bird ! "
8586	8594	8596	8597	Myra Ingleby	119	" It is very brave of you , "
8602	8633	8596	8597	Myra Ingleby	119	" I would offer to play your accompaniment , dear ; but I can only manage Au clair de la lune , and Three Blind Mice , with one finger . "
8634	8646	8648	8649	Garth Dalmain	111	" And I would offer to play your accompaniment , dear , "
8651	8891	8648	8649	Garth Dalmain	111	" if you were going to sing Lassen 's Allerseelen , for I play that quite beautifully with ten fingers ! It is an education only to hear the way I bring out the tolling of the cemetery chapel bell right through the song . The poor thing with the bunch of purple heather can never get away from it . Even in the grand crescendo , appassionata , fortissimo , when they discover that ' in death 's dark valley this is Holy Day , ' I give then no holiday from that bell . I do n't know what it did ' once in May. ' It tolls all the time , with maddening persistence , in my accompaniment . But I have seen The Rosary , and I dare not face those chords . To begin with , you start in every known flat ; and before you have gone far you have gathered unto yourself handfuls of known and unknown sharps , to which you cling , not daring to let them go , lest they should be wanted again the next moment . Alas , no ! When it is a question of accompanying The Rosary , I must say , as the old farmer at the tenants ' dinner the other day said to the duchess when she pressed upon him a third helping of pudding : ' Madam , I CANNOT ! ' "
8892	8900	8902	8902	Jane	101	" Do n't be silly , Dal , "
8904	8929	8902	8902	Jane	101	" You could accompany The Rosary perfectly , if I wanted it done . But , as it happens , I prefer accompanying myself . "
8930	8933	8935	8936	Lady Ingleby	112	" Ah , "
8940	8977	8935	8936	Lady Ingleby	112	" I quite understand that . It would be such a relief all the time to know that if things seemed going wrong , you could stop the other part , and give yourself the note . "
8998	9008	9010	9010	Jane	101	" It certainly would be useful , if necessary , "
9012	9029	9031	9031	Garth	111	" I would ' stop the other part ' and ' give you the note , ' "
9035	9042	9044	9044	Jane	101	" I am sure you would , "
9046	9066	9044	9044	Jane	101	" You are always so very kind . But I prefer to keep the matter in my own hands . "
9067	9092	9093	9094	Garth Dalmain	111	" You realise the difficulty of making the voice carry in a place of that size unless you can stand and face the audience ? "
9216	9322	9201	9201	she	101	" Yes , I know . But the acoustic properties of the room are very perfect , and I have learned to throw my voice . Perhaps you may not know in fact , how should you know ? but I have had the immense privilege of studying with Madame Marchesi in Paris , and of keeping up to the mark since by an occasional delightful hour with her no less gifted daughter in London . So I ought to know all there is to know about the management of a voice , if I have at all adequately availed myself of such golden opportunities . "
9343	9353	9339	9339	Jane	101	" I have been learning Tonic sol - fa . "
9415	9421	9412	9413	The butler	358	" do a little bass , "
9463	9549	9459	9459	she	588	" ; in other words , she followed along , slightly behind the trebles as regarded time , and a major third below them as regarded pitch . The housekeeper , a large , dark person with a fringe on her upper lip , unshaven and unashamed , produced a really remarkable effect by singing the air an octave below the trebles . Unfortunately Lady Ingleby was apt to confuse her with the butler . Myra herself was the first to admit that she had not "
9552	9583	9459	9459	she	588	" ; but it was decidedly trying , at a moment when she dared not remove her eyes from the accompaniment of Good King Wenceslas , to have called out : "
9591	9707	9589	9589	Jenkins	134	" and then find it was Mrs. Jarvis who had been travelling upwards . But when a new footman , engaged by Lord Ingleby with no reference to his musical gifts , chanced to possess a fine throaty tenor , Myra felt she really had material with which great things might be accomplished , and decided herself to learn the Tonic sol - fa system . She easily mastered mi , re , do , and so , fa , fa , mi , because these represented the opening lines of Three Blind Mice , always a musical landmark to Myra . But when it came to the fugue - like intricacies in the theme of "
9717	9740	9712	9713	the farmer	591	" Lady Ingleby was lost without the words to cling to , and gave up the Tonic sol - fa system in despair .
9768	9791	9763	9764	Garth Dalmain	111	" I say ! No wonder you take it coolly . Why , Velma herself was a pupil of the great madame . "
9792	9805	9807	9807	Jane	101	" That is how it happens that I know her rather well , "
9809	9825	9807	9807	Jane	101	" I am here to - day because I was to have played her accompaniment . "
9826	9830	9832	9832	Garth	111	" I see , "
9834	9884	9832	9832	Garth	111	" And now you have to do both . ' Land 's sake ! ' as Mrs. Parker Bangs says when you explain who 's who at a Marlborough House garden party . But you prefer playing other people 's accompaniments , to singing yourself , do n't you ? "
9892	9897	9898	9898	she	101	" I prefer singing , "
9901	9908	9898	9898	she	101	" but accompanying is more useful . "
9909	9915	9917	9917	Garth	111	" Of course it is , "
9919	9935	9917	9917	Garth	111	" Heaps of people can sing a little , but very few can accompany properly . "
9936	9939	9941	9941	Myra	119	" Jane , "
9956	9984	9941	9941	Myra	119	" if you have had singing lessons , and know some songs , why has n't the duchess turned you on to sing to us before this ? "
9985	9991	9992	9992	Jane	101	" For a sad reason , "
9995	10154	9992	9992	Jane	101	" You know her only son died eight years ago ? He was such a handsome , talented fellow . He and I inherited our love of music from our grandfather . My cousin got into a musical set at college , studied with enthusiasm , and wanted to take it up professionally . He had promised , one Christmas vacation , to sing at a charity concert in town , and went out , when only just recovering from influenza , to fulfil this engagement . He had a relapse , double pneumonia set in , and he died in five days from heart failure . My poor aunt was frantic with grief ; and since then any mention of my love of music makes her very bitter . I , too , wanted to take it up professionally , but she put her foot down heavily . I scarcely ever venture to sing or play here . "
10155	10160	10162	10163	Garth Dalmain	111	" Why not elsewhere ? "
10165	10185	10162	10163	Garth Dalmain	111	" We have stayed about at the same houses , and I had not the faintest idea you sang . "
10186	10192	10194	10194	Jane	101	" I do not know , "
10197	10233	10194	10194	Jane	101	" But music means so much to me . It is a sort of holy of holies in the tabernacle of one 's inner being . And it is not easy to lift the veil . "
10234	10244	10246	10247	Myra Ingleby	119	" The veil will be lifted to - night , "
10249	10252	10254	10254	Jane	101	" Yes , "
10261	10267	10254	10254	Jane	101	" I suppose it will . "
10268	10275	10277	10278	Garth Dalmain	111	" And we shall pass in , "
10349	10354	10355	10355	she	119	" Ah , bah ! "
10358	10409	10355	10355	she	119	" It is so perfect out here , and I must go in to my maid . Jane , be advised in time . Do not ever begin facial massage . You become a slave to it , and it takes up hours of your day . Look at me . "
10422	10448	10410	10410	They	597	" For ordinary dressing purposes , I need not have gone in until seven ; and now I must lose this last , perfect hour . "
10449	10453	10455	10455	Jane	101	" What happens ? "
10457	10465	10455	10455	Jane	101	" I know nothing of the process . "
10466	10474	10476	10477	Lady Ingleby	112	" I ca n't go into details , "
10479	10528	10476	10477	Lady Ingleby	112	" but you know how sweet I have looked all day ? Well , if I did not go to my maid now , I should look less sweet by the end of dinner , and at the close of the evening I should appear ten years older . "
10529	10536	10538	10538	Jane	101	" You would always look sweet , "
10544	10554	10538	10538	Jane	101	" and why mind looking the age you are ? "
10555	10579	10581	10581	Myra	119	" My dear , ' a man is as old as he feels ; a woman is as old as she looks , ' "
10583	10589	10591	10591	Garth	111	" I FEEL just seven , "
10593	10599	10601	10601	Myra	119	" And you LOOK seventeen , "
10603	10611	10613	10613	Garth	111	" And I AM twenty - seven , "
10690	10690	10679	10680	the duchess	304	"
10703	10711	10712	10712	she	112	" Be quiet , you ridiculous child ! "
10715	10757	10712	10712	she	112	" You had no business to listen to what I was saying to Jane . You shall paint me this autumn . And after that I will give up facial massage , and go abroad , and come back quite old . "
10774	10780	10782	10782	Garth	111	" How lovely she is ! "
10788	10803	10782	10782	Garth	111	" How much of that was true , do you suppose , Miss Champion ? "
10804	10812	10814	10814	Jane	101	" I have not the slightest idea , "
10816	10828	10814	10814	Jane	101	" I am completely ignorant on the subject of facial massage . "
10829	10837	10839	10839	Garth	111	" Not much , I should think , "
10841	10850	10839	10839	Garth	111	" or she would not have told us . "
10851	10859	10861	10861	Jane	101	" Ah , you are wrong there , "
10865	11282	10861	10861	Jane	101	" Myra is extraordinarily honest , and always inclined to be frank about herself and her foibles . She had a curious upbringing . She is one of a large family , and was always considered the black sheep , not so much by her brothers and sisters , as by her mother . Nothing she was , or said , or did , was ever right . When Lord Ingleby met her , and I suppose saw her incipient possibilities , she was a tall , gawky girl , with lovely eyes , a sweet , sensitive mouth , and a what - on - earth - am - I - going - to - do - next expression on her face . He was twenty years her senior , but fell most determinedly in love with her and , though her mother pressed upon him all her other daughters in turn , he would have Myra or nobody . When he proposed to her it was impossible at first to make her understand what he meant . His meaning dawned on her at length , and he was not kept waiting long for her answer . I have often heard him tease her about it . She looked at him with an adorable smile , her eyes brimming over with tears , and said : ' Why , of course . I 'll marry you GRATEFULLY , and I think it is perfectly sweet of you to like me . But what a blow for mamma ! ' They were married with as little delay as possible , and he took her off to Paris , Italy , and Egypt , had six months abroad , and brought her back this ! I was staying with them once , and her mother was also there . We were sitting in the morning room , no men , just half a dozen women , and her mother began finding fault about something , and said : ' Has not Lord Ingleby often told you of it ? ' Myra looked up in her sweet , lazy way and answered : ' Dear mamma , I know it must seem strange to you , but , do you know , my husband thinks everything I do perfect . ' ' Your husband is a fool ! ' snapped her mother . ' From YOUR point of view , dear mamma , ' said Myra , sweetly . "
11283	11287	11289	11289	Garth	111	" Old curmudgeon ! "
11291	11357	11289	11289	Garth	111	" Why are people of that sort allowed to be called ' mothers ' ? We , who have had tender , perfect mothers , would like to make it law that the other kind should always be called ' she - parents , ' or ' female progenitors , ' or any other descriptive title , but not profane the sacred name of mother ! "
11614	11623	11624	11624	he	111	" Oh , I say , Miss Champion ! "
11629	11855	11624	11624	he	111	" Is n't it nice that they have all gone in ? I have been wanting a good jaw with you . Really , when we all get together we do drivel sometimes , to keep the ball rolling . It is like patting up air - balls ; and very often they burst , and one realises that an empty , shrivelled little skin is all that is left after most conversations . Did you ever buy air - balls at Brighton ? Do you remember the wild excitement of seeing the man coming along the parade , with a huge bunch of them blue , green , red , white , and yellow , all shining in the sun ? And one used to wonder how he ever contrived to pick them all up I do n't know how ! and what would happen if he put them all down . I always knew exactly which one I wanted , and it was generally on a very inside string and took a long time to disentangle . And how maddening it was if the grown - ups grew tired of waiting , and walked on with the penny . Only I would rather have had none , than not have the one on which I had fixed my heart . Would n't you ? "
11856	11866	11868	11868	Jane	101	" I never bought air - balls at Brighton , "
11914	11921	11922	11922	he	111	" Come along , Miss Champion , "
11925	12035	11922	11922	he	111	" I am so tired of doing nothing . Let us go down to the river and find a boat or two . Dinner is not until eight o'clock , and I am certain you can dress , even for the ROLE of Velma , in half an hour . I have known you do it in ten minutes , at a pinch . There is ample time for me to row you within sight of the minster , and we can talk as we go . Ah , fancy ! the grey old minster with this sunset behind it , and a field of cowslips in the foreground ! "
12042	12047	12048	12048	she	101	" My dear Dal , "
12051	12206	12048	12048	she	101	" you would not feel much enthusiasm for the minster or the sunset , after you had pulled my twelve stone odd up the river . You would drop exhausted among the cowslips . Surely you might know by now that I am not the sort of person to be told off to sit in the stern of a tiny skiff and steer . If I am in a boat , I like to row ; and if I row , I prefer rowing stroke . But I do not want to row now , because I have been playing golf the whole afternoon . And you know perfectly well it would be no pleasure to you to have to gaze at me all the way up and all the way down the river ; knowing all the time , that I was mentally criticising your stroke and marking the careless way you feathered . "
12245	12254	12255	12255	he	111	" How cross you are , old chap , "
12260	12266	12255	12255	he	111	" What is the matter ? "
12275	12327	12267	12267	Jane	101	" Oh , you dear boy ! I think you have the sweetest temper in the world . I wo n't be cross any more . The truth is , I hate the duchess 's concerts , and I do n't like being the duchess 's ' surprise - packet . ' "
12328	12332	12334	12334	Garth	111	" I see , "
12338	12350	12334	12334	Garth	111	" But , that being so , why did you offer ? "
12351	12358	12360	12360	Jane	101	" Ah , I had to , "
12362	12449	12360	12360	Jane	101	" Poor old dear ! She so rarely asks me anything , and her eyes besought . Do n't you know how one longs to have something to do for some one who belongs to one ? I would black her boots if she wished it . But it is so hard to stay here , week after week , and be kept at arm 's length . This one thing she asked of me , and her proud old eyes pleaded . Could I refuse ? "
12455	12460	12461	12461	he	111	" No , dear , "
12465	12557	12461	12461	he	111	" of course you could n't . And do n't bother over that silly joke about the ' surprise packet . ' You see , you wo n't be that . I have no doubt you sing vastly better than most of them , but they will not realise it . It takes a Velma to make such people as these sit up . They will think THE ROSARY a pretty song , and give you a mild clap , and there the thing will end . So do n't worry . "
12566	12569	12570	12570	she	101	" Dal , "
12573	12847	12570	12570	she	101	" I do hate singing before that sort of audience . It is like giving them your soul to look at , and you do n't want them to see it . It seems indecent . To my mind , music is the most REVEALING thing in the world . I shiver when I think of that song , and yet I dare n't do less than my best . When the moment comes , I shall live in the song , and forget the audience . Let me tell you a lesson I once had from Madame Blanche . I was singing Bemberg 's CHANT HINDOU , the passionate prayer of an Indian woman to Brahma . I began : ' BRAHMA ! DIEU DES CROYANTS , ' and sang it as I might have sung ' DO , RE , MI . ' Brahma was nothing to me . ' Stop ! ' cried Madame Blanche in her most imperious manner . ' Ah , vous Anglais ! What are you doing ? BRAHMA , c'est un Dieu ! He may not be YOUR God . He may not be MY God . But he is somebody 's God . He is the God of the song . Ecoutez ! ' And she lifted her head and sang : ' Brahma ! Dieu des croyants ! Maitre des cites saintes ! ' with her beautiful brow illumined , and a passion of religious fervour which thrilled one 's soul . It was a lesson I never forgot . I can honestly say I have never sung a song tamely , since . "
12848	12851	12853	12854	Garth Dalmain	111	" Fine ! "
12856	12883	12853	12854	Garth Dalmain	111	" I like enthusiasm in every branch of art . I never care to paint a portrait , unless I adore the woman I am painting . "
12902	12907	12908	12908	she	101	" Dal , dear , "
12911	12942	12908	12908	she	101	" you adore so many in turn , that we old friends , who have your real interest at heart , fear you will never adore to any definite purpose . "
12946	12950	12951	12951	he	111	" Oh bother ! "
12954	12988	12951	12951	he	111	" Are you like all the rest ? Do you also think adoration and admiration must necessarily mean marriage . I should have expected you to take a saner and more masculine view . "
12989	12994	12996	12996	Jane	101	" My dear boy , "
12998	13107	12996	12996	Jane	101	" your friends have decided that you need a wife . You are alone in the world . You have a lovely home . You are in a fair way to be spoiled by all the silly women who run after you . Of course we are perfectly aware that your wife must have every incomparable beauty under the sun united in her own exquisite person . But each new divinity you see and paint apparently fulfils , for the time being , this wondrous ideal ; and , perhaps , if you wedded one , instead of painting her , she might continue permanently to fulfil it . "
13124	13221	13121	13121	he	111	" Beauty is so much a thing of the surface . I see it , and admire it . I desire it , and paint it . When I have painted it , I have made it my own , and somehow I find I have done with it . All the time I am painting a woman , I am seeking for her soul . I want to express it on my canvas ; and do you know , Miss Champion , I find that a lovely woman does not always have a lovely soul . "
13239	13250	13252	13252	Garth	111	" There is just one who seems to me perfect , "
13254	13276	13252	13252	Garth	111	" I am to paint her this autumn . I believe I shall find her soul as exquisite as her body . "
13277	13282	13284	13284	Jane	101	" And she is ? "
13286	13290	13252	13252	Garth	111	" Lady Brand . "
13291	13294	13296	13296	Jane	101	" Flower ! "
13298	13306	13296	13296	Jane	101	" Are YOU so taken with Flower ? "
13307	13314	13316	13316	Garth	111	" Ah , she is lovely , "
13322	13359	13316	13316	Garth	111	" It positively is not right for any one to be so absolutely flawlessly lovely . It makes me ache . Do you know that feeling , Miss Champion , of perfect loveliness making you ache ? "
13360	13367	13369	13369	Jane	101	" No , I do n't , "
13373	13391	13369	13369	Jane	101	" And I do not think other people 's wives ought to have that effect upon you . "
13392	13398	13400	13400	Garth	111	" My dear old chap , "
13404	13480	13400	13400	Garth	111	" it has nothing to do with wives or no wives . A wood of bluebells in morning sunshine would have precisely the same effect . I ache to paint her . When I have painted her and really done justice to that matchless loveliness as I see it , I shall feel all right . At present I have only painted her from memory ; but she is to sit to me in October . "
13481	13485	13487	13487	Jane	101	" From memory ? "
13489	13567	13369	13369	Jane	101	" Yes , I paint a great deal from memory . Give me one look of a certain kind at a face , let me see it at a moment which lets one penetrate beneath the surface , and I can paint that face from memory weeks after . Lots of my best studies have been done that way . Ah , the delight of it ! Beauty the worship of beauty is to me a religion . "
13568	13576	13578	13578	Jane	101	" Rather a godless form of religion , "
13580	13584	13586	13586	Garth	111	" Ah no , "
13589	13722	13586	13586	Garth	111	" All true beauty comes from God , and leads back to God . ' Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights . ' I once met an old freak who said all sickness came from the devil . I never could believe that , for my mother was an invalid during the last years of her life , and I can testify that her sickness was a blessing to many , and borne to the glory of God . But I am , convinced all true beauty is God - given , and that is why the worship of beauty is to me a religion . Nothing bad was ever truly beautiful ; nothing good is ever really ugly . "
13804	13819	13820	13820	she	101	" Then are plain people to be denied their share of goodness , Dal ? "
13823	13829	13831	13832	Garth Dalmain	111	" Plainness is not ugliness , "
13835	14127	13831	13832	Garth Dalmain	111	" I learned that when quite a small boy . My mother took me to hear a famous preacher . As he sat on the platform during the preliminaries he seemed to me quite the ugliest man I had ever seen . He reminded me of a grotesque gorilla , and I dreaded the moment when he should rise up and face us and give out a text . It seemed to me there ought to be bars between , and that we should want to throw nuts and oranges . But when he rose to speak , his face was transfigured . Goodness and inspiration shone from it , making it as the face of an angel . I never again thought him ugly . The beauty of his soul shone through , transfiguring his body . Child though I was , I could differentiate even then between ugliness and plainness . When he sat down at the close of his magnificent sermon , I no longer thought him a complicated form of chimpanzee . I remembered the divine halo of his smile . Of course his actual plainness of feature remained . It was not the sort of face one could have wanted to live with , or to have day after day opposite to one at table . But then one was not called to that sort of discipline , which would have been martyrdom to me . And he has always stood to my mind since as a proof of the truth that goodness is never ugly ; and that divine love and aspiration shining through the plainest features may redeem them temporarily into beauty ; and , permanently , into a thing one loves to remember . "
14128	14132	14134	14134	Jane	101	" I see , "
14136	14211	14134	14134	Jane	101	" It must have often helped you to a right view to have realised that so long ago . But now let us return to the important question of the face which you ARE to have daily opposite you at table . It can not be Lady Brand 's , nor can it be Myra 's ; but , you know , Dal , a very lovely one is being suggested for the position . "
14212	14218	14220	14220	Garth	111	" No names , please , "
14224	14239	14220	14220	Garth	111	" I object to girls ' names being mentioned in this sort of conversation . "
14240	14398	14134	14134	Jane	101	" Very well , dear boy . I understand and respect your objection . You have made her famous already by your impressionist portrait of her , and I hear you are to do a more elaborate picture ' in the fall . ' Now , Dal , you know you admire her immensely . She is lovely , she is charming , she hails from the land whose women , when they possess charm , unite with it a freshness and a piquancy which place them beyond compare . In some ways you are so unique yourself that you ought to have a wife with a certain amount of originality . Now , I hardly know how far the opinion of your friends would influence you in such a matter , but you may like to hear how fully they approve your very open allegiance to shall we say the beautiful ' Stars and Stripes ' ? "
14423	14426	14428	14428	Jane	101	" Smoke , "
14430	14433	14435	14435	Garth	111	" Thanks , "
14594	14624	14591	14591	Garth	111	" I wonder why the smoke is that lovely pale blue as it curls up from the cigarette , and a greyish - white if one blows it out . "
14695	14754	14759	14759	Garth	111	" It is awfully good of you , Miss Champion , to take the trouble to think all this and to say it to me . May I prove my gratitude by explaining for once where my difficulty lies ? I have scarcely defined it to myself , and yet I believe I can express it to you . "
14792	14811	14779	14779	himself	111	" Then ever pray that heaven may send Such weeds , such chairs , and such a friend . "
14887	15484	14883	14883	he	111	" Two women the only two women who have ever really been in my life form for me a standard below which I can not fall , one , my mother , a sacred and ideal memory ; the other , old Margery Graem , my childhood 's friend and nurse , now my housekeeper and general tender and mender . Her faithful heart and constant remembrance help to keep me true to the ideal of that sweet presence which faded from beside me when I stood on the threshold of manhood . Margery lives at Castle Gleneesh . When I return home , the sight which first meets my eyes as the hall door opens is old Margery in her black satin apron , lawn kerchief , and lavender ribbons . I always feel seven then , and I always hug her . You , Miss Champion , do n't like me when I feel seven ; but Margery does . Now , this is what I want you to realise . When I bring a bride to Gleneesh and present her to Margery , the kind old eyes will try to see nothing but good ; the faithful old heart will yearn to love and serve . And yet I shall know she knows the standard , just as I know it ; I shall know she remembers the ideal of gentle , tender , Christian womanhood , just as I remember it ; and I must not , I dare not , fall short . Believe me , Miss Champion , more than once , when physical attraction has been strong , and I have been tempted in the worship of the outward loveliness to disregard or forget the essentials , the things which are unseen but eternal , then , all unconscious of exercising any such influence , old Margery 's clear eyes look into mine , old Margery 's mittened hand seems to rest upon my coat sleeve , and the voice which has guided me from infancy , says , in gentle astonishment : ` Is this your choice , Master Garthie , to fill my dear lady 's place ? ' No doubt , Miss Champion , it will seem almost absurd to you when you think of our set and our sentiments , and the way we racket round that I should sit here on the duchess 's lawn and confess that I have been held back from proposing marriage to the women I have most admired , because of what would have been my old nurse 's opinion of them ! But you must remember her opinion is formed by a memory , and that memory is the memory of my dead mother . Moreover , Margery voices my best self , and expresses my own judgment when it is not blinded by passion or warped by my worship of the beautiful . Not that Margery would disapprove of loveliness ; in fact , she would approve of nothing else for me , I know very well . But her penetration rapidly goes beneath the surface . According to one of Paul 's sublime paradoxes , she looks at the things that are not seen . It seems queer that I can tell you all this , Miss Champion , and really it is the first time I have actually formulated it in my own mind . But I think it so extremely friendly of you to have troubled to give me good advice in the matter . "
15715	15723	15692	15692	him	111	" I wish I knew old Margery . "
15732	15740	15741	15741	he	111	" Ah , I wish you did , "
15744	15870	15741	15741	he	111	" And I should like you to see Castle Gleneesh . You would enjoy the view from the terrace , sheer into the gorge , and away across the purple hills . And I think you would like the pine woods and the moor . I say , Miss Champion , why should not I get up a ' best party ' in September , and implore the duchess to come and chaperon it ? And then you could come , and any one else you would like asked . And and , perhaps we might ask the beautiful ' Stars and Stripes , ' and her aunt , Mrs. Parker Bangs of Chicago ; and then we should see what Margery thought of her ! "
15871	15874	15876	15876	Jane	101	" Delightful ! "
15878	15927	15876	15876	Jane	101	" I would come with pleasure . And really , Dal , I think that girl has a sweet nature . Could you do better ? The exterior is perfect , and surely the soul is there . Yes , ask us all , and see what happens . "
15928	15932	15934	15934	Garth	111	" I will , "
15938	15949	15934	15934	Garth	111	" And what will Margery think of Mrs. Parker Bangs ? "
15950	15954	15956	15956	Jane	101	" Never mind , "
15959	15973	15956	15956	Jane	101	" When you marry the niece , the aunt goes back to Chicago . "
15974	15984	15934	15934	Garth	111	" And I wish her people were not millionaires . "
15985	15992	15994	15994	Jane	101	" That ca n't be helped , "
15996	16011	15994	15994	Jane	101	" Americans are so charming , that we really must not mind their money . "
16012	16023	16025	16025	Garth	111	" I wish Miss Lister and her aunt were here , "
16027	16054	16025	16025	Garth	111	" But they are to be at Lady Ingleby 's , where I am due next Tuesday . Do you come on there , Miss Champion ? "
16055	16059	16061	16061	Jane	101	" I do , "
16063	16104	16061	16061	Jane	101	" I go to the Brands for a few days on Tuesday , but I have promised Myra to turn up at Shenstone for the week - end . I like staying there . They are such a harmonious couple . "
16105	16108	16110	16110	Garth	111	" Yes , "
16112	16129	16110	16110	Garth	111	" but no one could help being a harmonious couple , who had married Lady Ingleby . "
16130	16134	16136	16136	Jane	101	" What grammar ! "
16138	16185	16136	16136	Jane	101	" But I know what you mean , and I am glad you think so highly of Myra . She is a dear ! Only do make haste and paint her and get her off your mind , so as to be free for Pauline Lister . "
16209	16215	16217	16217	Jane	101	" Let us go in , "
16221	16231	16232	16232	she	101	" I am glad we have had this talk , "
16244	16247	16249	16249	Garth	111	" Yes , "
16251	16309	16249	16249	Garth	111	" Air - balls were n't in it ! It was a football this time good solid leather . And we each kicked one goal , a tie , you know . For your advice went home to me , and I think my reply showed you the true lie of things ; eh , Miss Champion ? "
16334	16337	16338	16338	she	101	" Yes , "
16351	16382	16338	16338	she	101	" we will consider it a tie , and surely it will prove a tie to our friendship . Thank you , Dal , for all you have told me . "
16463	16522	16439	16439	she	101	" MISS CHAMPION ! Oh , here you are ! Your turn next , please . The last item of the local programme is in course of performance , after which the duchess explains Velma 's laryngitis let us hope she will not call it ' appendicitis ' and then I usher you up . Are you ready ? "
16608	16613	16614	16614	she	101	" I am ready , "
16624	16630	16631	16631	she	101	" Has it gone well ? "
16634	16641	16614	16614	she	101	" Is it a good audience ? "
16642	16645	16647	16647	Garth	111	" Packed , "
16649	16681	16647	16647	Garth	111	" and the duchess has enjoyed herself . It has been funnier than usual . But now comes the event of the evening . I say , where is your score ? "
16682	16685	16687	16687	Jane	101	" Thanks , "
16689	16705	16687	16687	Jane	101	" I shall play it from memory . It obviates the bother of turning over . "
16740	16748	16750	16750	Garth	111	" Oh , hark to the duchess ! "
16752	16951	16750	16750	Garth	111	" My NIECE , JANE CHAMPION , HAS KINDLY CONSENTED TO STEP INTO THE BREACH ' Which means that you will have to step up on to that platform in another half - minute . Really it would be kinder to you if she said less about Velma . But never mind ; they are prepared to like anything . There ! APPENDICITIS ! I told you so . Poor Madame Velma ! Let us hope it wo n't get into the local papers . Oh , goodness ! She is going to enlarge on new - fangled diseases . Well , it gives us a moment 's breathing space .... I say , Miss Champion , I was chaffing this afternoon about sharps and flats . I can play that accompaniment for you if you like . No ? Well , just as you think best . But remember , it takes a lot of voice to make much effect in this concert - room , and the place is crowded . Now the duchess has done . Come on . Mind the bottom step . Hang it all ! How dark it is behind this curtain ! "
17230	17265	17302	17304	The listening crowd	650	" The hours I spent with thee , dear heart , Are as a string of pearls to me ; I count them over , ev'ry one apart , My rosary , my rosary . "
17359	17393	17524	17524	she	101	" Each hour a pearl , each pearl a prayer , To still a heart in absence wrung ; I tell each bead unto the end , and there A cross is hung ! "
17474	17510	17524	17524	she	101	" O memories that bless and burn ! O barren gain and bitter loss ! I kiss each bead , and strive at last to learn To kiss the cross ... to kiss the cross . "
17526	17532	17682	17682	men	657	" I KISS EACH BEAD . "
17688	17694	17801	17801	he	111	" Encore ! ' core ! "
17796	17800	17801	17801	he	111	" Go back ! "
17822	17871	18033	18034	the duchess	304	" Go back at once and sing it all over again , note for note , word for word , just as before . Ah , do n't stand here waiting ! Go back now ! Go back at once ! Do n't you know that you MUST ? "
18041	18043	18148	18148	She	101	" please "
18156	18161	18314	18314	she	101	" Where'er you walk , "
18340	18375	18394	18394	I	0	" The hours I spent with thee , dear heart , Are as a string of pearls to me ; I count them over , ev'ry one apart , My rosary , my rosary . "
18409	18445	18605	18605	he	111	" O memories that bless and burn ! O barren gain and bitter loss ! I kiss each bead , and strive at last to learn To kiss the cross ... to kiss the cross . "
18600	18604	18605	18605	he	111	" My God ! "
18608	18614	18620	18620	Jane	101	" Oh , my God ! "
18615	18618	18620	18620	Jane	101	" Hush , "
18622	18635	18641	18641	he	111	" I never like to hear that name spoken lightly , Dal . "
18636	18640	18641	18641	he	111	" Spoken lightly ! "
18644	18685	18711	18711	she	101	" No speaking lightly would be possible for me to - night . ' Every perfect gift is from above . ' When words fail me to speak of the gift , can you wonder if I apostrophise the Giver ? "
18703	18710	18722	18722	Garth	111	" So you liked my song ? "
18714	18720	18722	18722	Garth	111	" Liked liked your song ? "
18732	18743	18753	18753	Jane	101	" I do not know whether I liked your song . "
18744	18751	18762	18762	Garth	111	" Then why this flattering demonstration ? "
18757	18760	18762	18762	Garth	111	" Because , "
18767	18779	19233	19233	She	101	" you lifted the veil , and I I passed within . "
19246	19257	19233	19233	She	101	" How dared you behave in so unconventional a way ? "
19260	19277	19386	19386	she	101	" Tell me just what you want me to do , and I will do it . "
19378	19385	19386	19386	she	101	" Good - night , Dal , "
19389	19401	19422	19422	he	111	" And do you know that you are missing the curate ? "
19418	19421	19422	19422	he	111	" No , "
19425	19503	19515	19515	Jane	101	" I am neither missing nor missed . I was only waiting in there until you went up . I shall not go back . I am going out into the park now to breathe in the refreshing coolness of the night breeze . And I am going to stand under the oaks and tell my beads . I did not know I had a rosary , until to - night , but I have I have ! "
19504	19513	19528	19528	Garth	111	" I should say you have a dozen , "
19519	19526	19528	19528	Garth	111	" Then you would be wrong , "
19530	19569	19578	19578	Jane	101	" I have just one . But it has many hours . I shall be able to call them all to mind when I get out there alone . I am going to ' count each pearl . ' "
19570	19576	19590	19590	Garth	111	" How about the cross ? "
19580	19588	19590	19590	Garth	111	" I have not reached that yet , "
19592	19601	19618	19618	Jane	101	" There is no cross to my rosary . "
19602	19616	19618	19618	Jane	101	" I fear there is a cross to every true rosary , Dal , "
19621	19637	19652	19652	he	111	" and I also fear it will go hard with you when you find yours . "
19645	19651	19652	19652	he	111	" When I find mine , "
19655	19663	19696	19696	he	111	" I hope I shall be able to "
19689	19695	19671	19671	He	111	" to FACE the cross , "
19717	19747	19758	19758	Jane	101	" Just one moment , Miss Champion ! There is something I want to ask you . May I ? Will you think me impertinent , presuming , inquisitive ? "
19748	19756	19758	19758	Jane	101	" I have no doubt I shall , "
19760	19790	19671	19671	He	111	" But I am thinking you all sorts of unusual things to - night ; so three adjectives more or less will not matter much . You may ask . "
19791	19800	19824	19824	she	101	" Miss Champion , have YOU a rosary ? "
19816	19823	19824	19824	she	101	" My dear boy , NO ! "
19827	19867	19873	19873	Garth	111	" Thank goodness , I have kept clear of ' memories that bless and burn . ' None of these things enter into my rational and well - ordered life , and I have no wish that they should . "
19868	19871	19873	19873	Garth	111	" Then , "
19875	19906	19912	19912	Jane	101	" how came you to sing THE ROSARY as if each line were your own experience ; each joy or pain a thing long passed , perhaps but your own ? "
19907	19910	19912	19912	Jane	101	" Because , "
19914	19977	20000	20000	he	111	" I always live in a song when I sing it . Did I not tell you the lesson I learned over the CHANT HINDOU ? Therefore I had a rosary undoubtedly when I was singing that song to - night . But , apart from that , in the sense you mean , no , thank goodness , I have none . "
19993	19999	20000	20000	he	111	" But IF you cared , "
20007	20022	20030	20030	she	101	" that is how you would care ? that is as you would feel ? "
20026	20029	20030	20030	she	101	" Yes , "
20033	20056	20023	20023	Jane	101	" IF I cared , I suppose I should care just so , and feel as I felt during those few minutes . "
20057	20073	20082	20082	Jane	101	" Then it was YOU in the song , although the circumstances are not yours ? "
20074	20081	20082	20082	Jane	101	" Yes , I suppose so , "
20085	20116	20195	20195	He	685	" if we can consider ourselves apart from our circumstances . But surely this is rather an unprofitable ' air - ball . ' Goodnight , ' Master Garthie ! ' "
20117	20194	20258	20258	she	101	" I say , Miss Champion ! Just one thing more . Will you sing for me to - morrow ? Will you come to the music - room and sing all the lovely things I want to hear ? And will you let me play a few of your accompaniments ? Ah , promise you will come . And promise to sing whatever I ask , and I wo n't bother you any more now . "
20250	20257	20258	20258	she	101	" Oh , you dear boy ! "
20261	20509	20641	20641	She	101	" What an artist you are ! And how difficult it is for us commonplace , matter - of - fact people to understand the artistic temperament . Here you go , almost turning my steady old head by your rapture over what seemed to you perfection of sound which has reached you through the ear ; just as , again and again , you worship at the shrine of perfection of form , which reaches you through the eye . I begin to understand how it is you turn the heads of women when you paint them . However , you are very delightful in your delight , and I want to go up to bed . So I promise to sing all you want and as much as you wish to - morrow . Now keep your promise and do n't bother me any more to - night . Do n't spend the whole night in the park , and try not to frighten the deer . No , I do not need any assistance with my candle , and I am quite used to going upstairs by myself , thank you . Ca n't you hear what personal and appropriate remarks Tommy is making down there ? Now do run away , Master Garthie , and count your pearls . And if you suddenly come upon a cross remember , the cross can , in all probability , be persuaded to return to Chicago ! "
20644	20664	21145	21145	Jane	101	" SANG ' THE ROSARY ' AT AUNT ' GINA 'S CONCERT IN PLACE OF VELMA , FAILED LARYNGITIS , "
21140	21144	21152	21152	she	101	" absurd way , "
21164	21166	21210	21210	she	101	" extraordinary "
21216	21327	21388	21388	he	697	" Jane Champion , do n't be a fool ! You would wrong that dear , beauty - loving boy , more than you would wrong yourself , if you took him for one moment seriously . His homage to - night was no more personal to you than his appreciation of the excellent dinner was personal to Aunt Georgina 's chef . In his enjoyment of the production , the producer was included ; but that was all . Be gratified at the success of your art , and do not spoil that success by any absurd sentimentality . Now wash your very ungainly hands and go to bed . "
21381	21387	21388	21388	he	697	" I have found her , "
21397	21664	21700	21700	her	101	" the ideal woman , the crown of womanhood , the perfect mate for the spirit , soul , and body of the man who can win her . Jane ! Jane ! Ah , how blind I have been ! To have known her for years , and yet not realised her to be this . But she lifted the veil , and I passed in . Ah grand , noble heart ! She will never be able to draw the veil again between her soul and mine . And she has no rosary . I thank God for that . No other man possesses , or has ever possessed , that which I desire more than I ever desired anything upon this earth , Jane 's love , Jane 's tenderness . Ah , what will it mean ? ' I count each pearl . ' She WILL count them some day her pearls and mine . God spare us the cross . Must there be a cross to every true rosary ? Then God give me the heavy end , and may the mutual bearing of it bind us together . Ah , those dear hands ! Ah , those true steadfast eyes ! ... Jane ! Jane ! Surely it has always been Jane , though I did not know it , blind fool that I have been ! But one thing I know : whereas I was blind , now I see . And it will always be Jane from this night onward through time and - please God into eternity . "
21708	21725	21738	21738	she	101	" Anything you wish , Garth , just tell me , and I will do it . "
21749	21800	21920	21920	Garth	111	" Oh , you middle - aged donkey ! You call yourself staid and sensible , and a little flattery from a boy of whom you are fond turns your head completely . Come to your senses at once ; or leave Overdene by the first train in the morning . "
21915	21918	21920	21920	Garth	111	" Yes , "
21923	21927	21937	21937	Ronald	117	" I am . "
21928	21935	21964	21964	Garth	111	" Will she be at Shenstone ? "

21983	21995	21997	21997	Jane	101	" Prithee , Benedict , are we to take this seriously ? "
22032	22051	22057	22057	Garth	111	" Oh , Dal , I am so glad ! Did you make up your mind last night ? "
22052	22055	22062	22062	he	111	" Yes , "
22068	22072	21997	21997	Jane	101	" last night . "
22073	22087	22062	22062	he	111	" Did our talk in the afternoon have something to do with it ? "
22088	22094	21997	21997	Jane	101	" No , nothing whatever . "
22095	22101	22102	22102	He	111	" Was it THE ROSARY ? "
22113	22122	22351	22351	They	710	" The revelation of THE ROSARY ? Yes . "

22967	23007	23034	23034	she	101	" Not alone from selfish motives , my dear Miss Champion ; but for the good of my parish ; for the welfare of my flock , for the advancement of the work of the church in our midst , "
23022	23033	23034	23034	she	101	" I shall be delighted to subscribe , Mr. Bilberry , "

23067	23082	23090	23091	Jane Champion	101	" you misunderstand me . My desire is to lead you to the altar . "
23083	23088	23090	23091	Jane Champion	101	" Dear Mr. Bilberry , "
23093	23285	23804	23804	Jane	101	" that would be quite unnecessary . From any part of your church the fact that you need a new altar - cloth is absolutely patent to all comers . I will , with the greatest pleasure , give you a cheque for ten pounds towards it . I have attended your church rather often lately because I enjoy a long , quiet walk by myself through the woods . And now I am sure you would like to see my aunt before you go . She is in the aviary , feeding her foreign birds . If you go out by that window and pass along the terrace to your left , you will find the aviary and the duchess . I would suggest the advisability of not mentioning this conversation to my aunt . She does not approve of elaborate altar - cloths , and would scold us both , and insist on the money being spent in providing boots for the school children . No , please do not thank me . I am really glad of an opportunity of helping on your excellent work in this neighbourhood . "
23798	23802	23804	23804	Jane	101	" I know , "
23806	23884	24025	24025	She	101	" Of course ! Why did I not realise it before ? I had too much music during those last days at Overdene ; and SUCH music ! I have been suffering from a surfeit of music , and the miss of it has given me this blank feeling of loneliness . No doubt we shall have plenty at Myra 's , and Dal will be there to clamour for it if Myra fails to suggest it . "
24036	24046	24053	24054	Lady Ingleby	112	" Ah ! it is good to be here ! "
24047	24051	24057	24057	her	112	" You dear ! "
24073	24168	24215	24215	Traveller	164	" It is a comfort to have you ! I always feel you are like the bass of a tune something so solid and satisfactory and beneath one in case of a crisis . I hate crises . They are so tiring . As I say : Why ca n't things always go on as they are ? They are as they were , and they were as they will be , if only people would n't bother . However , I am certain nothing could go far wrong when YOU are anywhere near . "
24181	24213	24171	24172	the leader	755	" and they flew along between the high hedges , brushing lightly against overhanging masses of honeysuckle and wild clematis . Jane snatched a spray of the clematis , in passing . "
24220	24241	24247	24248	Lady Ingleby	112	" she said , with that same quiet smile of glad anticipation , and put the white blossom in her buttonhole .
24242	24245	24247	24248	Lady Ingleby	112	" Well , "
24250	24604	24615	24615	Jane	101	" my house party is going on quite satisfactorily . Oh , and , Jane , there seems no doubt about Dal . How pleased I shall be if it comes off under my wing ! The American girl is simply exquisite , and so vivacious and charming . And Dal has quite given up being silly not that I ever thought him silly , but I know YOU did and is very quiet and pensive ; really were it any one but he , one would almost say ' dull . ' And they roam about together in the most approved fashion . I try to get the aunt to make all her remarks to me . I am so afraid of her putting Dal off . He is so fastidious . I have promised Billy anything , up to the half of my kingdom , if he will sit at the feet of Mrs. Parker Bangs and listen to her wisdom , answer her questions , and keep her away from Dal . Billy is being so abjectly devoted in his attentions to Mrs. Parker Bangs that I begin to have fears lest he intends asking me to kiss him ; in which case I shall hand him over to you to chastise . You manage these boys so splendidly . I fully believe Dal will propose to Pauline Lister tonight . I ca n't imagine why he did n't last night . There was a most perfect moon , and they went on the lake . What more COULD Dal want ? a lake , and a moon , and that lovely girl ! Billy took Mrs. Parker Bangs in a double canoe and nearly upset her through laughing so much at the things she said about having to sit flat on the bottom . But he paddled her off to the opposite side of the lake from Dal and her niece , which was all we wanted . Mrs. Parker Bangs asked me afterwards whether Billy is a widower . Now what do you suppose she meant by that ? "
24605	24613	24615	24615	Jane	101	" I have n't the faintest idea , "
24617	24665	24673	24673	Myra	119	" But I am delighted to hear about Dal and Miss Lister . She is just the girl for him , and she will soon adapt herself to his ways and needs . Besides , Dal MUST have flawless loveliness , and really he gets it there . "
24666	24671	24673	24673	Myra	119	" He does indeed , "
24675	24729	24735	24735	Jane	101	" You should have seen her last night , in white satin , with wild roses in her hair . I can not imagine why Dal did not rave . But perhaps it is a good sign that he should take things more quietly . I suppose he is making up his mind . "
24730	24733	24735	24735	Jane	101	" No , "
24737	24766	24785	24785	she	112	" I believe he did that at Overdene . But it means a lot to him . He takes marriage very seriously . Whom have you at Shenstone ? "
24781	24784	24785	24785	she	112	" Delightful ! "
24788	24863	24873	24874	Lady Ingleby	112	" Oh ! how glad I am to be here ! London has been so hot and so dull . I never thought it hot or dull before . I feel a renegade . Ah ! there is the lovely little church ! I want to hear the new organ . I was glad your nice parson remembered me and let me have a share in it . Has it two manuals or three ? "
24864	24871	24873	24874	Lady Ingleby	112	" Half a dozen I think , "
24876	24922	24934	24934	Jane	101	" and you work them up and down with your feet . But I judged it wiser to leave them alone when I played for the children 's service one Sunday . You never know quite what will happen if you touch those mechanical affairs . "
24923	24932	24945	24945	Myra	119	" Do n't you mean the composition pedals ? "
24936	24943	24945	24945	Myra	119	" I dare say I do , "
24948	24968	25060	25060	she	101	" Those things underneath , like foot - rests , which startle you horribly if you accidentally kick them . "
25049	25059	25060	25060	she	101	" A miss is as good as a mile , "
25074	25291	25388	25388	Myra	119	" as I told dear mamma , when she expostulated wrathfully with me for what she called my ' furious driving ' the other day . By the way , Jane , dear mamma has been quite CORDIAL lately . By the time I am seventy and she is ninety - eight I think she will begin to be almost fond of me . Here we are . Do notice Lawson . He is new , and such a nice man . He sings so well , and plays the concertina a little , and teaches in the Sunday - school , and speaks really quite excellently at temperance meetings . He is extremely fond of mowing the lawns , and my maid tells me he is studying French with her . The only thing he seems really incapable of being , is an efficient butler ; which is so unfortunate , as I like him far too well ever to part with him . Michael says I have a perfectly fatal habit of LIKING PEOPLE , and of encouraging them to do the things they do well and enjoy doing , instead of the things they were engaged to do . I suppose I have ; but I do like my household to be happy . "
25378	25386	25388	25388	Myra	119	" Oh , that was not Lawson , "
25397	25617	25623	25623	Jane	101	" I had forgotten . He had to go to the vicarage this afternoon to see the vicar about a ' service of song ' they are getting up . That was Tom , but we call him ' Jephson ' in the house . He was one of Michael 's stud grooms , but he is engaged to one of the housemaids , and I found he so very much preferred being in the house , so I have arranged for him to understudy Lawson , and he is growing side whiskers . I shall have to break it to Michael on his return from Norway . This way , Jane . We have put you in the Magnolia room . I knew you would enjoy the view of the lake . Oh , I forgot to tell you , a tennis tournament is in progress . I must hasten to the courts . Tea will be going on there , under the chestnuts . Dal and Ronnie are to play the final for the men 's singles . It ought to be a fine match . It was to come on at about half - past four . Do n't wait to do any changings . Your maid and your luggage ca n't be here just yet . "
25618	25621	25623	25623	Jane	101	" Thanks , "
25625	25659	25819	25819	he	111	" I always travel in country clothes , and have done so to - day , as you see . I will just get rid of the railway dust , and follow you . "
25832	25836	25931	25931	Billy	108	" games all . "
25925	25929	25931	25931	Billy	108	" One all , "
25933	25969	26220	26221	Mrs. Parker	124	" Well ! I never saw Dal do THAT before . However ; it gives us the bliss of watching another set . They are splendidly matched . Dal is lightning , and Ronnie thunder . "
26176	26179	26220	26221	Mrs. Parker	124	" Deuce ! "
26187	26190	26198	26198	Ronnie	117	" vantage , "
26205	26207	26220	26221	Mrs. Parker	124	" deuce "
26210	26218	26224	26224	Billy	108	" Do n't it make one giddy ? "
26235	26272	26282	26282	Billy	108	" I should say it has gone on long enough . And they must both be wanting their tea . It would have been kind in Mr. Dalmain to have let that ball pass , anyway . "
26273	26280	26282	26282	Billy	108	" Yes , would n't it ? "
26285	26321	26331	26333	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" But you see , Dal is not naturally kind . Now , if I had been playing against Ronnie , I should have let those over - hand balls of his pass long ago . "
26322	26329	26364	26367	half a dozen voices	782	" I am sure you would , "
26357	26362	26378	26380	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" Deuce ! deuce ! "
26369	26376	26378	26380	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" They should n't say that , "
26382	26391	26419	26419	he	783	" even if they are mad about it . "
26410	26418	26419	26419	he	783	" No . Is n't it sad ? "
26422	26449	26470	26470	Myra	119	" I never say naughty words when I play . I always say ' Game love . ' It sounds so much nicer , I think . "
26465	26468	26496	26496	she	119	" Billy , "
26473	26495	26496	26496	she	119	" go into the hall and fetch my scarlet sunshade . Yes , I dare say you WILL miss the finish , "
26512	26519	26538	26538	he	783	" but you richly deserve it . "
26520	26534	26538	26538	he	783	" I have made up my mind what to ask , dear queen , "
26556	26583	26594	26594	Jane	101	" You promised me anything , up to the half of your kingdom . I will have the head of Mrs. Parker Bangs in a charger . "
26584	26592	26594	26594	Jane	101	" Oh , shut up , Billy ! "
26596	26615	26594	26594	Jane	101	" and get out of the light ! We missed that last stroke . What is the score ? "
26637	26643	26826	26826	His	111	" Play up , Dal ! "
26816	26825	27141	27141	she	101	" How do you do , Miss Champion ? "
27131	27140	27141	27141	she	101	" Very fit , thank you , Dal , "
27144	27165	27200	27200	he	111	" At least I am every moment improving in health and spirits , now I have arrived here at last . "
27192	27199	27238	27238	Jane	101	" Was anything wrong with London ? "
27229	27236	27238	27238	Jane	101	" Nothing was wrong with London , "
27241	27278	27355	27357	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" it was hot and dusty of course , but delightful as usual . Something was wrong with ME ; and you will be ashamed of me , Dal , if I confess what it was . "
27350	27353	27365	27365	Billy	108	" Liver ? "
27360	27363	27434	27434	she	101	" Muffins ! "
27428	27433	27434	27434	she	101	" I was dull , "
27437	27477	27534	27534	Jane	101	" intolerably dull . And Dal always says ' only a dullard is dull . ' But I diagnosed my dulness in the train just now and found it was largely his fault . Do you hear , Dal ? "
27522	27532	27542	27542	Garth	111	" It was your fault , my dear boy , "
27536	27540	27556	27556	his	111	" How so ? "
27562	27616	27622	27622	Myra	119	" Because , during those last days at Overdene , you led me on into a time of musical dissipation such as I had never known before , and I missed it to a degree which was positively alarming . I began to fear for the balance of my well - ordered mind . "
27617	27620	27622	27622	Myra	119	" Well , "
27632	27766	27775	27775	Jane	101	" you and Dal can have orgies of music here if you want them . You will find a piano in the drawing - room and another in the hall , and a Bechstein grand in the billiard - room . That is where I hold the practices for the men and maids . I could not make up my mind which makers I really preferred , Erard , Broadwood , Collard , or Bechstein ; so by degrees I collected one of each . And after all I think I play best upon the little cottage piano we had in the school - room at home . It stands in my boudoir now . I seem more accustomed to its notes , or it lends itself better to my way of playing . "
27767	27773	27775	27775	Jane	101	" Thank you , Myra , "
27777	27788	27805	27806	Lady Ingleby	112	" I fancy Dal and I will like the Bechstein . "
27789	27803	27805	27806	Lady Ingleby	112	" And if you want something really exciting in the way of music , "
27808	27843	27869	27869	Jane	101	" you might attend some of the rehearsals for this ' service of song ' they are getting up in aid of the organ deficit fund . I believe they are attempting great things . "
27844	27867	27880	27880	Garth	111	" I would sooner pay off the whole deficit , than go within a mile of a ' service of song , ' "
27872	27877	27884	27884	Myra	119	" Oh , no , "
27890	28024	28031	28031	Jane	101	" It is so good for people to work off their own debts and earn the things they need in their churches . And ' services of song ' are delightful if well done , as I am sure this will be if Lady Ingleby 's people are in it . Lawson outlined it to me this morning , and hummed all the principal airs . It is highly dramatic . Robinson Crusoe no , of course not ! What 's the beggar 's name ? ' Uncle Tom 's Cabin ' ? Yes , I knew it was something black . Lawson is Uncle Tom , and the vicar 's small daughter is to be little Eva . Miss Champion , you will walk down with me to the very next rehearsal . "
28025	28029	28060	28060	she	101	" Shall I ? "
28069	28086	28099	28101	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" Tell me just what you want me to do , and I will do it . "
28087	28097	28099	28101	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" Pauline will just love to go with you , "
28103	28110	28118	28119	Miss Lister	151	" She dotes on rural music . "
28111	28116	28118	28119	Miss Lister	151	" Rubbish , aunt ! "
28131	28156	28182	28182	she	101	" I agree with Miss Champion about ' services of song , ' and I do n't care for any music but the best . "
28173	28181	28182	28182	she	101	" Ah , but you must come , "
28185	28236	28253	28254	Pauline Lister	152	" We will be victimised together . And perhaps Dal and Lawson will succeed in converting us to the cult of the ' service of song . ' And anyway it will be amusing to have Dal explain it to us . He will need the courage of his convictions . "
28237	28251	28253	28254	Pauline Lister	152	" Talking of something ' really exciting in the way of music , ' "
28256	28717	28870	28870	he	111	" we had it on board when we came over . There was a nice friendly crowd on board the Arabic , and they arranged a concert for half - past eight on the Thursday evening . We were about two hundred miles off the coast of Ireland , and when we came up from dinner we had run into a dense fog . At eight o'clock they started blowing the fog - horn every half - minute , and while the fog - horn was sounding you could n't hear yourself speak . However , all the programmes were printed , and it was our last night on board , so they concluded to have the concert all the same . Down we all trooped into the saloon , and each item of that programme was punctuated by the stentorian BOO of the fog - horn every thirty seconds . You never heard anything so cute as the way it came in , right on time . A man with a deep bass voice sang ROCKED IN THE CRADLE OF THE DEEP , and each time he reached the refrain , ' And calm and peaceful is my sle - eep , ' BOO went the fog - horn , casting a certain amount of doubt on our expectations of peaceful sleep that night , anyway . Then a man with a sweet tenor sang OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT , and the fog - horn showed us just how oft , namely , every thirty seconds . But the queerest effect of all was when a girl had to play a piano - forte solo . It was something of Chopin 's , full of runs and trills and little silvery notes . She started all right ; but when she was half - way down the first page , BOO went the fog - horn , a longer blast than usual . We saw her fingers flying , and the turning of the page , but not a note could we hear ; and when the old horn stopped and we could hear the piano again , she had reached a place half - way down the second page , and we had n't heard what led to it . My ! it was funny . That went on all through . She was a plucky girl to stick to it . We gave her a good round of applause when she had finished , and the fog - horn joined in and drowned us . It was the queerest concert experience I ever had . But we all enjoyed it . Only we did n't enjoy that noise keeping right on until five o'clock next morning . "
28861	28869	28870	28870	he	111	" It must have been awfully funny , "
28873	28986	28870	28870	he	111	" And how well you told it . One could hear the fog - horn , and see the dismayed faces of the performers . Like an earthquake , a fog - horn is the sort of thing you do n't ever get used to . It sounds worse every time . Let 's each tell the funniest thing we remember at a concert . I once heard a youth recite Tennyson 's Charge of the Light Brigade with much dramatic action . But he was extremely nervous , and got rather mixed . In describing the attitude of mind of the noble six hundred , he told us impressively that it was "
28987	29009	28870	28870	he	111	" ' Theirs not to make reply ; Theirs not to do or die ; Theirs BUT TO REASON WHY . ' "
29010	29034	29042	29043	Ronald Ingram	117	" The tone and action were all right , and I doubt whether many of the audience noticed anything wrong with the words . "
29035	29040	29042	29043	Ronald Ingram	117	" That reminds me , "
29045	29109	28870	28870	he	111	" of quite the funniest thing I ever heard . It was at a Thanksgiving service when some of our troops returned from South Africa . The proceedings concluded by the singing of the National Anthem right through . You recollect how recently we had had to make the change of pronoun , and how difficult it was to remember not to shout : "
29110	29163	29042	29043	Ronald Ingram	117	" ' Send HER victorious ' ? Well , there was a fellow just behind me , with a tremendous voice , singing lustily , and taking special pains to get the pronouns correct throughout . And when he reached the fourth line of the second verse he sang with loyal fervour . "
29164	29176	29186	29187	Lady Ingleby	112	" ' Confound HIS politics , Frustrate HIS knavish tricks ! ' "
29177	29184	29186	29187	Lady Ingleby	112	" That would amuse the King , "
29189	29200	29042	29043	Ronald Ingram	117	" Are you sure it is a fact , Ronnie ? "
29201	29228	29186	29187	Lady Ingleby	112	" Positive ! I could tell you the church , and the day , and call a whole pewful of witnesses who were convulsed by it . "
29229	29304	29314	29314	Jane	101	" Well , I shall tell his Majesty at the next opportunity , and say you heard it . But how about the tennis ? What comes next ? Final for couples ? Oh , yes ! Dal , you and Miss Lister play Colonel Loraine and Miss Vermount ; and I think you ought to win fairly easily . You two are so well matched . Jane , this will be worth watching . "
29305	29312	29490	29490	Jane	101	" I am sure it will , "
29495	29511	29520	29520	Garth	111	" Dal , you will not mind if I ask ? Is it settled yet ? "
29512	29519	29520	29520	Garth	111	" I mind nothing you ask , "
29523	29533	29490	29490	Jane	101	" only be more explicit . Is what settled ? "
29534	29542	29547	29547	Garth	111	" Are you and Miss Lister engaged ? "
29543	29546	29547	29547	Garth	111	" No , "
29550	29559	29490	29490	Jane	101	" What made you suppose we should be ? "
29560	29587	29596	29596	Garth	111	" You said at Overdene on Tuesday TUESDAY ! oh ! does n't it seem weeks ago ? you said we were to take you seriously . "
29588	29594	29596	29596	Garth	111	" It seems years ago , "
29598	29738	29747	29747	Jane	101	" and I sincerely hope you will take me seriously . All the same I have not proposed to Miss Lister ; and I am anxious for an undisturbed talk with you on the subject . Miss Champion , after dinner to - night , when all the games and amusements are in full swing , and we can escape unobserved , will you come out onto the terrace with me , where I shall be able to speak to you without fear of interruption ? The moonlight on the lake is worth seeing from the terrace . I spent an hour out there last night ah , no ; you are wrong for once I spent it alone , when the boating was over , and thought of how to - night we might be talking there together . "
29739	29745	29747	29747	Jane	101	" Certainly I will come , "
29749	29776	29786	29786	Garth	111	" and you must feel free to tell me anything you wish , and promise to let me advise or help in any way I can . "
29777	29784	29786	29786	Garth	111	" I will tell you everything , "
29790	29802	30073	30073	she	101	" and you shall advise and help as ONLY you can . "
30065	30072	30073	30073	she	101	" ' Zenith , ' Marcovitch , "
30081	30125	30152	30152	his	111	" Packed in jolly green boxes , twelve shillings a hundred ! I must remember in case I want to give him a Christmas present . By then it will be difficult to find anything which has not already been showered upon him . "
30156	30179	30230	30230	he	111	" ' It is not mine to sing the stately grace , The great soul beaming in my lady 's face . ' "
30226	30229	30230	30230	he	111	" Hullo ! "
30233	30238	30244	30244	Jane	101	" YOU up there ? "
30239	30242	30244	30244	Jane	101	" Yes , "
30261	30279	30291	30291	Garth	111	" I up here . You are serenading the wrong window , dear ' devout lover . ' "
30280	30289	30303	30303	Jane	101	" What a lot you know about it , "
30296	30301	30303	30303	Jane	101	" Do n't I ? "
30305	30336	30365	30365	he	111	" But you must not mind , Master Garthie , because you know how truly I care . In old Margery 's absence , you must let me be mentor . "
30357	30364	30365	30365	he	111	" Shall I climb the magnolia ? "
30368	30389	30396	30396	Jane	101	" I have heaps to say to you which can not be shouted to the whole front of the house . "
30390	30394	30396	30396	Jane	101	" Certainly not , "
30398	30459	30466	30466	Garth	111	" I do n't want any Romeos coming in at my window . ' Hoity - toity ! What next ? ' as Aunt ' Gina would say . Run along and change your pinafore , Master Garthie . The ' heaps of things ' must keep until to - night , or we shall both be late for dinner . "
30460	30464	30466	30466	Garth	111	" All right , "
30468	30495	30510	30510	Jane	101	" all right . But you will come out here this evening , Miss Champion ? And you will give me as long as I want ? "
30496	30508	30510	30510	Jane	101	" I will come as soon as we can possibly escape , "
30512	30556	30586	30586	Jane	101	" and you can not be more anxious to tell me everything than I am to hear it . Oh ! the scent of these magnolias ! And just look at the great white trumpets ! Would you like one for your buttonhole ? "
30573	30584	30586	30586	Jane	101	" Why do I feel so inclined to tease him ? "
30596	30710	31139	31139	Jane	101	" Really it is I who have been silly this time ; and he , staid and sensible . Myra is quite right . He is taking it very seriously . And how about her ? Ah ! I hope she cares enough , and in the right way . Come in , Matthews ! And you can put out the gown I wore on the night of the concert at Overdene , and we must make haste . We have just twenty minutes . What a lovely evening ! Before you do anything else , come and see this sunset on the lake . Ah ! it is good to be here ! "
31134	31137	31139	31139	Jane	101	" Dal ! "
31148	31156	31169	31169	he	111	" Oh , Dal , do n't ! "
31163	31168	31169	31169	he	111	" Hush , dear , "
31172	31537	31743	31743	his	824	" I must tell you everything , and you have promised to listen , and to advise and help . Ah , Jane , Jane ! I shall need your help . I want it so greatly , and not only your help , Jane but YOU you , yourself . Ah , how I want you ! These three days have been one continual ache of loneliness , because you were not there ; and life began to live and move again , when you returned . And yet it has been so hard , waiting all these hours to speak . I have so much to tell you , Jane , of all you are to me all you have become to me , since the night of the concert . Ah , how can I express it ? I have never had any big things in my life ; all has been more or less trivial on the surface . This need of you this wanting you is so huge . It dwarfs all that went before ; it would overwhelm all that is to come , were it not that it will be the throne , the crown , the summit , of the future . Oh , Jane ! I have admired so many women . I have raved about them , sighed for them , painted them , and forgotten them . But I never LOVED a woman before ; I never knew what womanhood meant to a man , until I heard your voice thrill through the stillness ' I count each pearl . ' Ah , beloved , I have learned to count pearls since then , precious hours in the past , long forgotten , now remembered , and at last understood . ' Each hour a pearl , each pearl a prayer , ' ay , a passionate plea that past and present may blend together into a perfect rosary , and that the future may hold no possibility of pain or parting . Oh , Jane Jane ! Shall I ever be able to make you understand all how much Oh , JANE ! "
31758	31769	31930	31930	he	824	" You and I together , my own my own . "
31925	31929	32088	32088	Jane	101	" My wife ! "
32091	32109	32116	32116	he	111	" Do you mean that you wish to ask me to be to be THAT to you ? "
32110	32115	32123	32123	his	111	" Yes , dear , "
32134	32201	32449	32449	Jane	101	" At least I came out here intending to ask it of you . But I can not ask it now , beloved . I ca n't ask you TO BE what you ARE already . No promise , no ceremony , no giving or receiving of a ring , could make you more my wife than you have been just now in those wonderful moments . "
32297	32448	32449	32449	Jane	101	" You have taken me absolutely by surprise , Dal . I knew you had been delightfully nice and attentive since the concert evening , and that our mutual understanding of music and pleasure in it , coupled with an increased intimacy brought about by our confidential conversation under the cedar , had resulted in an unusually close and delightful friendship . I honestly admit it seems to have it has meant more to me than any friendship has ever meant . But that was partly owing to your temperament , Dal , which tends to make you always the most vivid spot in one 's mental landscape . But truly I thought you wanted me out here in order to pour out confidences about Pauline Lister . Everybody believes that her loveliness has effected your final capture , and truly , Dal , truly I thought so , too . "
32452	32455	32449	32449	Jane	101	" Well ? "
32468	32474	32449	32449	Jane	101	" You know otherwise now . "
32475	32510	32517	32517	he	830	" Dal you have so startled and astonished me . I can not give you an answer to - night . You must let me have until to - morrow to - morrow morning . "
32511	32516	32517	32517	he	830	" But , beloved , "
32526	32574	32584	32584	she	101	" there is no more need for you to answer than I felt need to put a question . Ca n't you realise this ? Question and answer were asked and given just now . Oh , my dearest come back to me . Sit down again . "
32580	32583	32584	32584	she	101	" No , "
32587	32729	32907	32907	his	111	" I ca n't allow you to take things for granted in this way . You took me by surprise , and I lost my head utterly unpardonably , I admit . But , my dear boy , marriage is a serious thing . Marriage is not a mere question of sentiment . It has to wear . It has to last . It must have a solid and dependable foundation , to stand the test and strain of daily life together . I know so many married couples intimately . I stay in their homes , and act sponsor to their children ; with the result that I vowed never to risk it myself . And now I have let you put this question , and you must not wonder if I ask for twelve hours to think it over . "
32918	32929	32938	32938	Jane	101	" Dearest tell me , did n't you feel just now "
32930	32935	32938	32938	Jane	101	" Oh , hush ! "
32943	33077	33123	33123	he	111	" hush , Dal ! Do n't talk about feelings with this question between us . Marriage is fact , not feeling . If you want to do really the best thing for us both , go straight indoors now and do n't speak to me again to - night . I heard you say you were going to try the organ in the church on the common at eleven o'clock to - morrow morning . Well I will come there soon after half - past eleven and listen while you play ; and at noon you can send away the blower , and I will give you my answer . But now oh , go away , dear ; for truly I can not bear anymore . I must be left alone . "
33133	33139	33403	33404	the women	841	" I kiss the cross , "
33397	33401	33543	33543	Garth	111	" good - nights "
33536	33542	33543	33543	Garth	111	" Sorry , dear ladies , "
33547	33571	33585	33587	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" but to - morrow morning is impossible . I have an engagement in the village . Yes really ! At eleven o'clock . "
33572	33583	33585	33587	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" That sounds so rural and pretty , Mr. Dalmain , "
33589	33648	33662	33663	Miss Lister	151	" Why not take Pauline and me along ? We have seen no dairies , and no dairy - maids , nor any of the things in Adam Bede , since we came over . I would just love to step into Mrs. Poyser 's kitchen and see myself reflected in the warming - pans on the walls . "
33649	33660	33781	33781	Garth	111	" Perhaps we would be DE TROP in the dairy , "
33759	33779	33781	33781	Garth	111	" But it happens , unfortunately , to be neither a dairy - maid nor a warming - pan , "
33783	33813	33819	33820	Miss Lister	151	" My appointment is with a very grubby small boy , whose rural beauties consist in a shock of red hair and a whole pepper - pot of freckles . "
33814	33817	33781	33781	Garth	111	" Philanthropic ? "
33822	33833	33843	33844	both ladies	844	" Yes , at the rate of threepence an hour . "
33834	33841	33861	33863	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" A caddy , of course , "
33847	33859	33861	33863	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" My ! What a mystery about a thing so simple ! "
33865	33905	33926	33926	he	111	" Now we have heard , Mr. Dalmain , that it is well worth the walk to the links to see you play . So you may expect us to arrive there , time to see you start around . "
33920	33925	33926	33926	he	111	" My dear lady , "
33929	34104	34105	34107	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" you overestimate my play as , in your great kindness of heart , you overestimate many other things connected with me . But I shall like to think of you at the golf links at eleven o'clock to - morrow morning . You might drive there , but the walk through the woods is too charming to miss . Only remember , you cross the park and leave by the north gate , not the main entrance by which we go to the railway station . I would offer to escort you , but duty takes me , at an early hour , in quite another direction . Besides , when Miss Lister 's wish to see the links is known , so many people will discover golf to be the one possible way of spending to - morrow morning , that I should be but a unit in the crowd which will troop across the park to the north gate . It will be quite impossible for you to miss your way . "
34132	34195	34361	34363	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" That will do , aunt . Do n't be silly . We are all units , except when we make a crowd ; which is what we are doing on this staircase at this present moment , so that Miss Champion has for some time been trying ineffectually to pass us . Do you golf to - morrow , Miss Champion ? "
34356	34359	34361	34363	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" Yes , "
34365	34381	34470	34470	she	101	" are you playing around with Mr. Dalmain to - morrow forenoon , Miss Champion ? "
34480	34521	34549	34549	he	111	" I am not golfing to - morrow ; but you could not do better than go to the links . Good - night , Mrs. Parker Bangs . Sleep well , Miss Lister . Good - night , Dal . "
34540	34548	34619	34621	Mrs. Parker Bangs	124	" Good - night , Miss Champion , "
34609	34617	34629	34630	Miss Lister	151	" There 's been a tiff there , "
34623	34627	34629	34630	Miss Lister	151	" Poor thing ! "
34633	34661	34670	34671	her aunt	543	" I like her . She 's a real good sort . I should have thought she would have been more sensible than the rest of us . "
34662	34668	34691	34692	Miss Lister	151	" A real plain sort , "
34678	34689	34629	34630	Miss Lister	151	" Well , she did n't make her own face , "
34695	34727	34734	34735	Miss Lister	151	" No , and she do n't pay other people to make it for her . She 's what Sir Walter Scott calls : ' Nature in all its ruggedness . ' "
34728	34732	34734	34735	Miss Lister	151	" Dear aunt , "
34738	35594	35737	35737	she	152	" I wish you would n't trouble to quote the English classics to me when we are alone . It is pure waste of breath , because you see I KNOW you have read them all . Here is my door . Now come right in and make yourself comfy on that couch . I am going to sit in this palatial arm - chair opposite , and do a little very needful explaining . My ! How they fix one to the floor ! These ancestral castles are all right so far as they go , but they do n't know a thing about rockers . Now I have a word or two to say about Miss Champion . She 's a real good sort , and I like her . She 's not a beauty ; but she has a fine figure , and she dresses right . She has heaps of money , and could have rarer pearls than mine ; but she knows better than to put pearls on that brown skin . I like a woman who knows her limitations and is sensible over them . All the men adore her , not for what she looks but for what she is , and , my word , aunt , that 's what pays in the long run . That is what lasts . Ten years hence the Honourable Jane will still be what she is , and I shall be trying to look what I 'm not . As for Garth Dalmain , he has eyes for all of us and a heart for none . His pretty speeches and admiring looks do n't mean marriage , because he is a man with an ideal of womanhood and he ca n't see himself marrying below it . If the Sistine Madonna could step down off those clouds and hand the infant to the young woman on her left , he might marry HER ; but even then he would be afraid he might see some one next day who did her hair more becomingly , or that her foot would not look so well on his Persian rugs as it does on that cloud . He wo n't marry money , because he has plenty of it . And even if he had n't , money made in candles would not appeal to him . He wo n't marry beauty , because he thinks too much about it . He adores so many lovely faces , that he is never sure for twenty - four hours which of them he admires most , bar the fact that , as in the case of fruit trees , the unattainable are usually the most desired . He wo n't marry goodness virtue worth whatever you choose to call the sterling qualities of character because in all these the Honourable Jane Champion is his ideal , and she is too sensible a woman to tie such an epicure to her plain face . Besides , she considers herself his grandmother , and does n't require him to teach her to suck eggs . But Garth Dalmain , poor boy , is so sublimely lacking in self - consciousness that he never questions whether he can win his ideal . He possesses her already in his soul , and it will be a fearful smack in the face when she says ' No , ' as she assuredly will do , for reasons aforesaid . These three days , while he has been playing around with me , and you and other dear match - making old donkeys have gambolled about us , and made sure we were falling in love , he has been worshipping the ground she walks on , and counting the hours until he should see her walk on it again . He enjoyed being with me more than with the other girls , because I understood , and helped him to work all conversations round to her , and he knew , when she arrived here , I could be trusted to develop sudden anxiety about you , or have important letters to write , if she came in sight . But that is all there will ever be between me and Garth Dalmain ; and if you had a really careful regard for my young affections you would drop your false set on the marble wash - stand , or devise some other equally false excuse for our immediate departure for town to - morrow . And now , dear , do n't stay to argue ; because I have said exactly all there is to say on the subject , and a little more . And try to toddle to bed without telling me of which cute character in Dickens I remind you , because I am cuter than any of them , and if I stay in this tight frock another second I ca n't answer for the consequences . Oui , Josephine , entrez ! Good - night , dear aunt . Happy dreams ! "
35651	35736	35993	35993	She	101	" I stated your case well , but you did n't quite deserve it , Dal . You ought to have let me know about Jane , weeks ago . Anyway , it will stop the talk about you and me . And as for you , dear , you will go on sighing for the moon ; and when you find the moon is unattainable , you will not dream of seeking solace in more earthly lights not even poppa 's best sperm , "
35973	35992	36626	36626	she	101	" Mine to have and hold , to fight for and enjoy ; and I slay all comers ! "
36617	36625	36633	36633	Garth	111	" Are you content , my beloved ? "
36650	36654	36678	36678	her	101	" Perfectly content . "
36699	36729	36830	36830	she	101	" He is mine and I am his . And because he is mine , my beloved is safe ; and because I am his , he is content . "
36826	36829	36830	36830	she	101	" Garth , "
36833	36925	37285	37285	she	101	" Garth , I UNDERSTAND . My own poor boy , it was so hard to you to be sent away just then . But you had had all all you wanted , in those few wonderful moments , and nothing can rob you of that fact . And you have made me SO yours that , whatever the future brings for you and me , no other face will ever be hidden here . It is yours , and I am yours to - night , and henceforward , forever . "
37291	37484	37494	37494	her	101	" His face was transfigured .... Goodness and inspiration shone from it , making it as the face of an angel .... I never thought him ugly again . Child though I was , I could differentiate even then between ugliness and plainness . I have associated his face ever since with the wondrous beauty of his soul . When he sat down , at the close of his address , I no longer thought him a complicated form of chimpanzee . I remembered the divine halo of his smile . Of course it was not the sort of face one COULD have wanted to live with , or to have day after day opposite one at table , but then one was not called to that sort of discipline , which would have been martyrdom to me . And he has always stood to my mind since as a proof of the truth that goodness is never ugly , and that divine love and aspiration , shining through the plainest features , may redeem them , temporarily , into beauty ; and permanently , into a thing one loves to remember . "
37502	37540	37860	37860	he	111	" Of course it was not the sort of face one COULD have wanted to live with , or to have day after day opposite one at table , ... which would have been martyrdom to me . "

37931	37935	37936	37936	he	111	" My wife ! "
37939	37945	38254	38254	Garth	111	" Oh ! my wife ! "

You shall have it because it is such a glorious day . There never was such a day , Jimmy ; and I want you to be happy also . Now run off quickly , and shut the church door behind you , my boy . "

39513	39520	39547	39547	he	111	" ANOINT AND CHEER OUR SOILED FACE "
39538	39546	39547	39547	he	111	" I had not thought of myself , "
39551	39615	39647	39647	he	111	" I can not explain how it comes to pass , but I have not thought of myself at all , since my mind has been full of you . Therefore I had not realised how little there is in me that you could care for . I believed you had felt as I did , that we were just each other 's . "
39640	39646	39647	39647	he	111	" You are quite right , "
39650	39664	39712	39712	he	111	" You could not marry any one whom you consider a mere boy . "
39705	39711	39766	39766	she	101	" I accept the cross , "
39759	39765	39803	39803	Garth	111	" O , my God , "

40440	40448	40450	40450	Pauline	152	" Is that you , Miss Champion ? "
40452	40581	40668	40668	their	943	" Well now , have you heard of Mr. Dalmain ? He has had to go to town unexpectedly , on the 1.15 train ; and aunt has dropped her false teeth on her marble wash - stand and must get to the dentist right away . So we go to town on the 2.30 . It 's an uncertain world . It complicates one 's plans , when they have to depend on other people 's teeth . But I would sooner break false teeth than true hearts , any day . One can get the former mended , but I guess no one can mend the latter . We are lunching early in our rooms ; so I wish you good - by , Miss Champion . "

I would be obliged if people who walk around the studio while I am being painted will in future refrain from humming tunes . I do n't want him to scoop off my topazes and call for my emeralds . Also I feel like offering a reward for the discovery of that tune . I want to know what it has to do with my scheme of colour , anyway . "
42622	42652	42657	42657	Garth	111	" The hours I spent with thee , dear heart , Are as a string of pearls to me ; I count them over , every one , apart . "
42684	42694	42743	42743	she	101	" I have learned to count pearls , beloved . "

42792	42798	42838	42838	he	940	" Sing it , Jane . "
42831	42837	42849	42849	she	101	" Sing it , Jane , "
42841	42848	42849	42849	she	101	" I ca n't , Deryck , "
42858	42866	42849	42849	she	101	" I have not sung for months . "
42867	42876	42896	42896	she	101	" What has been the matter for months ? "
42890	42895	42896	42896	she	101	" Oh , boy , "
42899	42935	43022	43023	The doctor	940	" I have made a bad mess of my life ! And yet I know I did right . I would do the same again ; at least at least , I hope I would . "
42976	43021	43022	43023	The doctor	940	" Boy I gave up something , which was more than life itself to me , for the sake of another , and I ca n't get over it . I know I did right , and yet I ca n't get over it . "
43034	43044	43022	43023	The doctor	940	" Can you tell me about it , Jeanette ? "
43045	43058	43022	43023	The doctor	940	" I can tell no one , Deryck ; not even you . "
43059	43080	43022	43023	The doctor	940	" If ever you find you must tell some one , Jane , will you promise to come to me ? "
43081	43084	43022	43023	The doctor	940	" Gladly . "
43085	43326	43022	43023	The doctor	940	" Good ! Now , my dear girl , here is a prescription for you . Go abroad . And , mind , I do not mean by that , just to Paris and back , or Switzerland this summer , and the Riviera in the autumn . Go to America and see a few big things . See Niagara . And all your life afterwards , when trivialities are trying you , you will love to let your mind go back to the vast green mass of water sweeping over the falls ; to the thunderous roar , and the upward rush of spray ; to the huge perpetual onwardness of it all . You will like to remember , when you are bothering about pouring water in and out of teacups , ' Niagara is flowing still . ' Stay in a hotel so near the falls that you can hear their great voice night and day , thundering out themes of power and progress . Spend hours walking round and viewing it from every point . Go to the Cave of the Winds , across the frail bridges , where the guide will turn and shout to you : ' Are your rings on tight ? ' Learn , in passing , the true meaning of the Rock of Ages . Receive Niagara into your life and soul as a possession , and thank God for it . "
43327	43442	43022	43023	The doctor	940	" Then go in for other big things in America . Try spirituality and humanity ; love and life . Seek out Mrs. Ballington Booth , the great ' Little Mother ' of all American prisoners . I know her well , I am proud to say , and can give you a letter of introduction . Ask her to take you with her to Sing - Sing , or to Columbus State Prison , and to let you hear her address an audience of two thousand convicts , holding out to them the gospel of hope and love , her own inspired and inspiring belief in fresh possibilities even for the most despairing . "
43443	43696	43902	43905	the doctor 's wife	1008	" Go to New York City and see how , when a man wants a big building and has only a small plot of ground , he makes the most of that ground by running his building up into the sky . Learn to do likewise . And then , when the great - souled , large - hearted , rapid - minded people of America have waked you to enthusiasm with their bigness , go off to Japan and see a little people nobly doing their best to become great . Then to Palestine , and spend months in tracing the footsteps of the greatest human life ever lived . Take Egypt on your way home , just to remind yourself that there are still , in this very modern world of ours , a few passably ancient things , a well - preserved wooden man , for instance , with eyes of opaque white quartz , a piece of rock crystal in the centre for a pupil . These glittering eyes looked out upon the world from beneath their eyelids of bronze , in the time of Abraham . You will find it in the museum at Cairo . Ride a donkey in the Mooskee if you want real sport ; and if you feel a little slack , climb the Great Pyramid . Ask for an Arab named Schehati , and tell him you want to do it one minute quicker than any lady has ever done it before . "
43697	43761	43776	43776	she	101	" Then come home , my dear girl , ring me up and ask for an appointment ; or chance it , and let Stoddart slip you into my consulting - room between patients , and report how the prescription has worked . I never gave a better ; and you need not offer me a guinea ! I attend old friends gratis . "
43770	43775	43826	43826	she	101	" Oh , boy , "
43779	43825	43826	43826	she	101	" I believe you are right . My whole ideas of life have been focussed on myself and my own individual pains and losses . I will do as you say ; and God bless you for saying it . Here comes Flower . Flower , "
43854	43896	43902	43903	the doctor	940	" will this boy of ours ever grow old ? Here he is , seriously advising that a stout , middle - aged woman should climb the Great Pyramid as a cure for depression , and do it in record time ! "
43897	43900	43908	43908	herself	1008	" Darling , "
43916	44054	44062	44062	Flower	144	" whom have you been seeing who is stout , or depressed , or middle - aged ? If you mean Mrs. Parker Bangs , she is not middle - aged , because she is an American , and no American is ever middle - aged . And she is only depressed because , even after painting her lovely niece 's portrait , Garth Dalmain has failed to propose to her . And it is no good advising her to climb the Great Pyramid , though she is doing Egypt this winter , because I heard her say yesterday that she should never think of going up the pyramids until the children of Israel , or whoever the natives are who live around those parts , have the sense to put an elevator right up the centre . "
44081	44114	44213	44213	he	940	" Jane , I heard you playing THE ROSARY just now , such a favourite of mine , and it is months since I heard it . Do sing it , dear . "
44204	44212	44213	44213	he	940	" But she had better go abroad , "
44216	44366	44661	44661	he	107	" It will take her mind off herself altogether , giving her a larger view of things in general , and a better proportioned view of things in particular . And the boy wo n't change ; or , if he does , Jane will be proved right , to her own satisfaction . But , if this is HER side , good heavens , what must HIS be ! I had wondered what was sapping all his buoyant youthfulness . To care for Jane would be an education ; but to have made Jane care ! And then to have lost her ! He must have nerves of steel , to be facing life at all . What is this cross they are both learning to kiss , and holding up between them ? Perhaps Niagara will sweep it away , and she will cable him from there . "
44667	44710	44926	44926	Schehati	196	" Nice gentleman - lady ! Give good backsheesh , and not sit down halfway and say : ` No top ' ! But real lady - gentleman ! Give backsheesh with kind face , and not send poor Arab to Assouan . "
44918	44924	45295	45295	Jane	101	" Nice gentleman - lady , "
45286	45293	45295	45295	Jane	101	" A parting of the ways , "
45297	45460	45583	45583	Garth	111	" a place of choice . How difficult to know which to choose liberty or fruitfulness . One would have to consult the Sphinx wise old guardian of the ages , silent keeper of Time 's secrets , gazing on into the future as It has always gazed , while future became present , and present glided into past . Come , Schehati , let us descend . Oh , yes , I will certainly sit upon the stone on which the King sat when he was Prince of Wales . Thank you for mentioning it . It will supply a delightful topic of conversation next time I am honoured by a few minutes of his gracious Majesty 's attention , and will save me from floundering into trite remarks about the weather . And now take me to the Sphinx , Schehati . There is a question I would ask of It , just as the sun dips below the horizon . "
45599	45628	45659	45659	Garth	111	" The moon shines bright : in such a night as this , When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees , And they did make no noise "
45666	45678	45835	45835	she	101	" Enable with perpetual light The dulness of our blinded sight . "
45839	45886	46066	46066	Jane	101	" It is all your own , Garth , to look at when you will . For your sake , I could wish it beautiful ; but if it is as you like it , my own Dear , why should I hide it from you ? "
46053	46064	46066	46066	Jane	101	" One thing is clear to me to - night , "
46068	46092	46144	46144	she	101	" If he still needs me wants me I can not live any longer away from him . I must go to him . "
46137	46143	46370	46374	the chaperon of the party	1059	" I will risk it , "
46360	46368	46390	46391	the girl	976	" Poor fellow ! How too sad ! "
46376	46388	46390	46391	the girl	976	" I should think he would sooner have been killed outright ! "
46393	46399	46409	46411	the young men	1061	" I know I would . "
46400	46405	46409	46411	the young men	1061	" Oh , no , "
46417	46426	46435	46437	the young voice	1062	" Life is sweet , under any circumstances . "
46427	46433	46435	46437	the young voice	1062	" Oh , but blind ! "
46443	46456	46466	46468	the older woman	1063	" Quite blind for the rest of one 's life . Horrible ! "
46457	46464	46466	46468	the older woman	1063	" Was it his own gun ? "
46470	46484	46596	46596	she	101	" And how came they to be having a shooting party in March ? "
46604	46681	46712	46712	he	1067	" One pair of eyes the less to look along a gun and frustrate the despairing dash for home and little ones of a terrified little mother rabbit . One hand that will never again change a soaring upward flight of spreading wings , into an agonised mass of falling feathers . One chance to the good , for the noble stag , as he makes a brave run to join his hinds in the valley . "
46708	46711	46733	46733	They	1069	" No , "
46738	46738	46746	46747	the girl	976	"
46739	46744	46754	46758	the owner of the letter	1071	" Was he shooting ? "
46749	46752	46754	46758	the owner of the letter	1071	" No , "
46760	46924	46932	46934	the young man	1072	" and that seems such hard luck . He had given up shooting altogether a year or two ago . He never really enjoyed it , because he so loved the beauty of life and hated death in every form . He has a lovely place in the North , and was up there painting . He happened to pass within sight of some fellows rabbit - shooting , and saw what he considered cruelty to a wounded rabbit . He vaulted over a gate to expostulate and to save the little creature from further suffering . Then it happened . One of the lads , apparently startled , let off his gun . The charge struck a tree a few yards off , and the shot glanced . It did not strike him full . The face is only slightly peppered and the brain quite uninjured . But shots pierced the retina of each eye , and the sight is hopelessly gone . "
46925	46930	46953	46959	the youth who had not yet spoken	1073	" Awful hard luck , "
46936	46951	46975	46976	the soldier	1074	" I never can understand a chap not bein ' keen on shootin ' , "
46961	46973	46975	46976	the soldier	1074	" Ah , but you would if you had known him , "
46978	47051	47060	47062	the older woman	1063	" He was so full of life and vivid vitality . One could not imagine him either dying or dealing death . And his love of the beautiful was almost a form of religious worship . I ca n't explain it ; but he had a way of making you see beauty in things you had hardly noticed before . And now , poor chap , he ca n't see them himself . "
47052	47058	46975	46976	the soldier	1074	" Has he a mother ? "
47064	47191	47203	47204	the girl	976	" No , he has no one . He is absolutely alone . Scores of friends of course ; he was a most popular man about town , and could stay in almost any house in the kingdom if he chose to send a post - card to say he was coming . But no relations , I believe , and never would marry . Poor chap ! He will wish he had been less fastidious , now . He might have had the pick of all the nicest girls , most seasons . But not he ! Just charming friendships , and wedded to his art . And now , as Lady Ingleby , says , he lies in the dark , helpless and alone . "
47192	47201	47203	47204	the girl	976	" Oh , do talk of something else ! "
47213	47266	47299	47299	he	1072	" I want to forget it . It 's too horribly sad . Fancy what it must be to wake up and not know whether it is day or night , and to have to lie in the dark and wonder . Oh , do come out and talk of something cheerful . "
47292	47298	47299	47299	he	1072	" Forget it , dear , "
47303	47315	47370	47370	she	101	" Come on out and see the old Sphinx by moonlight . "
47361	47369	47378	47378	he	1072	" May I look at your paper ? "
47374	47377	47359	47359	him	1072	" Certainly , "
47393	47417	47378	47378	he	1072	" Why , certainly , Miss Champion . And how do you do ? I did not know you were in these parts . "
47418	47467	47528	47528	she	101	" Ah , General Loraine ! Your face seemed familiar , but I had not recognised you , either . Thanks , I will borrow this if I may . And do n't let me keep you from your friends . We shall meet again by and by . "
47537	47549	47663	47663	she	101	" Enable with perpetual light The dulness of our blinded sight . "
47654	47659	47917	47917	her	101	" Strength and whiteness , "
47926	47942	48198	48198	he	1108	" O God , is it not simple ? Blind and alone ! MY Garth ! "
48044	48183	48194	48196	the efficient porter	1108	" We regret to announce that Mr. Garth Dalmain still lies in a most precarious condition at his house on Deeside , Aberdeenshire , as a result of the shooting accident a fortnight ago . His sight is hopelessly gone , but the injured parts were progressing favourably , and all fear of brain complications seemed over . During the last few days , however , a serious reaction from shock has set in , and it has been considered necessary to summon Sir Deryck Brand , the well - known nerve specialist , in consultation with the oculist and the local practitioner in charge of the case . There is a feeling of wide - spread regret and sympathy in those social and artistic circles where Mr. Dalmain was so well - known and so deservedly popular . "
48184	48192	48246	48246	he	1108	" Oh , thank you , m'lady , "
48257	48268	48283	48283	he	1108	" who knoweth that ye have need of these things , "

48516	48531	48622	48622	Jane	101	" Here , somebody ! Fetch me a cup of coffee , will you ? "
48610	48620	48632	48632	she	101	" Oh , thank you , my good fellow , "
48638	48672	48697	48697	he	1127	" Here ! you have done very well for me . No , never mind the change . Coffee at a moment 's notice should fetch a fancy price . Good - bye . "

49180	49187	49188	49188	he	107	" That is right , dear , "
49191	49304	49358	49359	the doctor	940	" All fit and well , I can see . Now hand over your keys . I suppose you have nothing contraband ? I telephoned the duchess to send some of her people to meet your luggage , and not to expect you herself until dinner time , as you were taking tea with us . Was that right ? This way . Come outside the barrier . What a rabble ! All wanting to break every possible rule and regulation , and each trying to be the first person in the front row . Really the patience and good temper of railway officials should teach the rest of mankind a lesson . "
49353	49356	49358	49359	the doctor	940	" Well , "
49361	49484	49509	49510	The doctor	940	" Niagara is a big thing is n't it ? When people say to me , ' Were you not disappointed in Niagara ? WE were ! ' I feel tempted to wish , for one homicidal moment , that the earth would open her mouth and swallow them up . People who can be disappointed in Niagara , and talk about it , should no longer be allowed to crawl on the face of the earth . And how about the ' Little Mother ' ? Is n't she worth knowing ? I hope she sent me her love . And New York harbour ! Did you ever see anything to equal it , as you steam away in the sunset ? "
49500	49508	49509	49510	The doctor	940	" Is there no hope , Deryck ? "
49517	49544	49509	49510	The doctor	940	" He will always be blind , dear . But life holds other things beside sight . We must never say : ' No hope . ' "
49545	49550	49509	49510	The doctor	940	" Will he live ? "
49551	49597	49598	49598	Jane	101	" There is no reason he should not live . But how far life will be worth living , largely depends upon what can be done for him , poor chap , during the next few months . He is more shattered mentally than physically . "
49614	49620	49681	49681	he	940	" Deryck I love him . "
49673	49680	49681	49681	he	940	" In that case , dear , "
49684	49765	49944	49944	he	940	" the future holds in store so great a good for Garth Dalmain that I think he may dispense with sight . Meanwhile you have much to say to me , and it is , of course , your right to hear every detail of his case that I can give . And here we are at Wimpole Street . Now come into my consulting - room . Stoddart has orders that we are on no account to be disturbed . "
49937	49943	49944	49944	he	940	" You understand , dear , "
49948	50189	50214	50214	He	940	" the actual wounds are going on well . Strangely enough , though the retina of each eye was pierced , and the sight is irrecoverably gone , there was very little damage done to surrounding parts , and the brain is quite uninjured . The present danger arises from the shock to the nervous system and from the extreme mental anguish caused by the realisation of his loss . The physical suffering during the first days and nights must have been terrible . Poor fellow , he looks shattered by it . But his constitution is excellent , and his life has been so clean , healthy , and normal , that he had every chance of making a good recovery , were it not that as the pain abated and his blindness became more a thing to be daily and hourly realised , his mental torture was so excessive . Sight has meant so infinitely much to him , beauty of form , beauty of colour . The artist in him was so all - pervading . They tell me he said very little . He is a brave man and a strong one . But his temperature began to vary alarmingly ; he showed symptoms of mental trouble , of which I need not give you technical details ; and a nerve specialist seemed more necessary than an oculist . Therefore he is now in my hands . "
50238	50597	50658	50659	The doctor	940	" I am satisfied on the whole . He needed a friendly voice to penetrate the darkness . He needed a hand to grasp his , in faithful comprehension . He did not want pity , and those who talked of his loss without understanding it , or being able to measure its immensity , maddened him . He needed a fellow - man to come to him and say : ' It is a fight an awful , desperate fight . But by God 's grace you will win through to victory . It would be far easier to die ; but to die would be to lose ; you must live to win . It is utterly beyond all human strength ; but by God 's grace you will come through conqueror . ' All this I said to him , Jeanette , and a good deal more ; and then a strangely beautiful thing happened . I can tell you , and of course I could tell Flower , but to no one else on earth would I repeat it . The difficulty had been to obtain from him any response whatever . He did not seem able to rouse sufficiently to notice anything going on around him . But those words , ' by God 's grace , ' appeared to take hold of him and find immediate echo in his inner consciousness . I heard him repeat them once or twice , and then change them to ' with the abundance of Thy grace . ' Then he turned his head slowly on the pillow , and what one could see of his face seemed transformed . He said : ' Now I remember it , and the music is this ' ; and his hands moved on the bedclothes , as if forming chords . Then , in a very low voice , but quite clearly , he repeated the second verse of the VENI , CREATOR SPIRITUS . I knew it , because I used to sing it as a chorister in my father 's church at home . You remember ? "
50598	50645	50214	50214	He	940	" ' Enable with perpetual light The dulness of our blinded sight . Anoint and cheer our soiled face With the abundance of Thy grace . Keep far our foes ; give peace at home ; Where Thou art Guide , no ill can come . ' "
50646	50657	50683	50684	the doctor	940	" It was the most touching thing I ever heard . "
50690	50874	50885	50885	she	101	" You see , this gave me something to go upon . When a crash such as this happens , all a man has left to hold on to is his religion . According as his spiritual side has been developed , will his physical side stand the strain . Dalmain has more of the real thing than any one would think who only knew him superficially . Well , after that we talked quite definitely , and I persuaded him to agree to one or two important arrangements . You know , he has no relations of his own , to speak of ; just a few cousins , who have never been very friendly . He is quite alone up there ; for , though he has hosts of friends , this is a time when friends would have to be very intimate to be admitted ; and though he seemed so boyish and easy to know , I begin to doubt whether any of us knew the real Garth the soul of the man , deep down beneath the surface . "
50880	50884	50894	50895	the doctor	940	" I did , "
50889	50892	50894	50895	the doctor	940	" Ah , "
50897	51509	51817	51817	him	940	" I see . Well , as I said , ordinary friends could not be admitted . Lady Ingleby went , in her sweet impulsive way , without letting them know she was coming ; travelled all the way up from Shenstone with no maid , and nothing but a handbag , and arrived at the door in a fly . Robert Mackenzie , the local medical man , who is an inveterate misogynist , feared at first she was an unsuspected wife of Dal 's . He seemed to think unannounced ladies arriving in hired vehicles must necessarily turn out to be undesirable wives . I gather they had a somewhat funny scene . But Lady Ingleby soon got round old Robbie , and came near to charming him as whom does she not ? But of course they did not dare let her into Dal 's room ; so her ministry of consolation appears to have consisted in letting Dal 's old housekeeper weep on her beautiful shoulder . It was somewhat of a comedy , hearing about it , when one happened to know them all , better than they knew each other . But to return to practical details . He has had a fully trained male nurse and his own valet to wait on him . He absolutely refused one of our London hospital nurses , who might have brought a little gentle comfort and womanly sympathy to his sick - room . He said he could not stand being touched by a woman ; so there it remained . A competent man was found instead . But we can now dispense with him , and I have insisted upon sending up a lady nurse of my own choosing ; not so much to wait on him , or do any of a sick - nurse 's ordinary duties his own man can do these , and he seems a capable fellow but to sit with him , read to him , attend to his correspondence , there are piles of unopened letters he ought to hear , in fact help him to take up life again in his blindness . It will need training ; it will require tact ; and this afternoon I engaged exactly the right person . She is a gentlewoman by birth , has nursed for me before , and is well up in the special knowledge of mental things which this case requires . Also she is a pretty , dainty little thing ; just the kind of elegant young woman poor Dal would have liked to have about him when he could see . He was such a fastidious chap about appearances , and such a connoisseur of good looks . I have written a descriptive account of her to Dr. Mackenzie , and he will prepare his patient for her arrival . She is to go up the day after to - morrow . We are lucky to get her , for she is quite first - rate , and she has only just finished with a long consumptive case , now on the mend and ordered abroad . So you see , Jeanette , all is shaping well . And now , my dear girl , you have a story of your own to tell me , and my whole attention shall be at your disposal . But first of all I am going to ring for tea , and you and I will have it quietly down here , if you will excuse me for a few minutes while I go upstairs and speak to Flower . "
51818	51820	52281	52281	Jane	101	" Boy "
52287	52340	52363	52363	his	940	" Deryck , I am going to tell you everything . I am going to speak of my heart , and mind , and feelings , exactly as if they were bones , and muscles , and lungs . I want you to combine the offices of doctor and confessor in one . "
52371	52420	52445	52445	his	940	" Deryck , mine has been a somewhat lonely existence . I have never been essential to the life of another , and no one has ever touched the real depths of mine . I have known they were there , but I have known they were unsounded . "
52449	52495	52514	52514	he	940	" I had never been loved with that love which makes one absolutely first to a person , nor had I ever so loved . I had cared very much ; but caring is not loving . Oh , Boy , I know that now ! "
52520	52535	52514	52514	he	940	" Quite true , dear . There is a distinction , and a difference . "
52536	52580	52620	52620	Jane	101	" I had heaps of friends , and amongst them a good many nice men , mostly rather younger than myself , who called me ' Miss Champion . ' to my face , and ' good old Jane ' behind my back . "
52612	52618	52620	52620	Jane	101	" Men as a rule , "
52622	52736	52741	52742	the doctor	940	" get on better with me than do women . Being large and solid , and usually calling a spade ' a spade ; ' and not ' a garden implement , ' women consider me strong - minded , and are inclined to be afraid of me . The boys know they can trust me ; they make a confidante of me , looking upon me as a sort of convenient elder sister who knows less about them than an elder sister would know , and is probably more ready to be interested in those things which they choose to tell . Among my men friends , Deryck , was Garth Dalmain . "
52750	52775	52741	52742	the doctor	940	" I was always interested in him , partly because he was so original and vivid in his way of talking , and partly because "
52785	53020	53026	53027	the doctor	940	cheeks-"well , though I did not realise it then , I suppose I found his extraordinary beauty rather fascinating . And then , our circumstances were so much alike , both orphans , and well off ; responsible to no one for our actions ; with heaps of mutual friends , and constantly staying at the same houses . We drifted into a pleasant intimacy , and of all my friends , he was the one who made me feel most like ` a man and a brother . ' We discussed women by the dozen , all his special admirations in turn , and the effect of their beauty upon him , and I watched with interest to see who , at last , would fix his roving fancy . But on one eventful day all this was changed in half an hour . We were both staying at Overdene . There was a big house party , and Aunt Georgina had arranged a concert to which half the neighbourhood was coming . Madame Velma failed at the last minute . Aunt ' Gina , in a great state of mind , was borrowing remarks from her macaw . You know how ? She always says she is merely quoting ` the dear bird . ' Something had to be done . I offered to take Velma 's place ; and I sang . "
53021	53024	53026	53027	the doctor	940	" Ah , "
53029	53050	53051	53052	The doctor	940	" I sang The Rosary the song Flower asked for the last time I was here . Do you remember ? "
53055	53059	53026	53027	the doctor	940	" I remember . "
53060	53501	53668	53668	he	940	" After that , all was changed between Garth and me . I did not understand it at first . I knew the music had moved him deeply , beauty of sound having upon him much the same effect as beauty of colour ; but I thought the effect would pass in the night . But the days went on , and there was always this strange sweet difference ; not anything others would notice ; but I suddenly became conscious that , for the first time in my whole life , I was essential to somebody . I could not enter a room without realising that he was instantly aware of my presence ; I could not leave a room without knowing that he would at once feel and regret my absence . The one fact filled and completed all things ; the other left a blank which could not be removed . I knew this , and yet incredible though it may appear I did not realise it meant LOVE . I thought it was an extraordinarily close bond of sympathy and mutual understanding , brought about principally by our enjoyment of one another 's music . We spent hours in the music - room . I put it down to that ; yet when he looked at me his eyes seemed to touch as well as see me , and it was a very tender and wonderful touch . And all the while I never thought of love . I was so plain and almost middle - aged ; and he , such a beautiful , radiant youth . He was like a young sun - god , and I felt warmed and vivified when he was near ; and he was almost always near . Honestly , that was my side of the days succeeding the concert . But HIS ! He told me afterwards , Deryck , it had been a sudden revelation to him when he heard me sing The Rosary , not of music only , but of ME . He said he had never thought of me otherwise than as a good sort of chum ; but then it was as if a veil were lifted , and he saw , and knew , and felt me as a woman . And no doubt it will seem odd to you . Boy ; it did to me ; but he said , that the woman he found then was his ideal of womanhood , and that from that hour he wanted me for his own as he had never wanted anything before . "
53672	53682	53710	53710	she	101	" I do not think it odd , dear . "
53701	53709	53710	53710	she	101	" I am glad you do n't , "
53713	54016	54017	54017	Jane	101	" I did . well , we both left Overdene on the same day . I came to you ; he went to Shenstone . It was a Tuesday . On the Friday I went down to Shenstone , and we met again . Having been apart for a little while seemed to make this curious feeling of ` togetherness , ' deeper and sweeter than ever . In the Shenstone house party was that lovely American girl , Pauline Lister . Garth was enthusiastic about her beauty , and set on painting her . Everybody made sure he was going to propose to her . Deryck , I thought so , too ; in fact I had advised him to do it . I felt so pleased and interested over it , though all the while his eyes touched me when he looked at me , and I knew the day did not begin for him until we had met , and was over when we had said good - night . And this experience of being first and most to him made everything so golden , and life so rich , and still I thought of it only as an unusually delightful friendship . But the evening of my arrival at Shenstone he asked me to come out on to the terrace after dinner , as he wanted specially to talk to me . Deryck , I thought it was the usual proceeding of making a confidante of me , and that I was to hear details of his intentions regarding Miss Lister . Thinking that , I walked calmly out beside him ; sat down on the parapet , in the brilliant moonlight , and quietly waited for him to begin . Then oh , Deryck ! It happened . "
54034	54231	54253	54254	Deryck Brand	107	" I can not tell you details . His love it just poured over me like molten gold . It melted the shell of my reserve ; it burst through the ice of my convictions ; it swept me off my feet upon a torrent of wondrous fire . I knew nothing in heaven or earth but that this love was mine , and was for me . And then oh , Deryck ! I ca n't explain I do n't know myself how it happened but this whirlwind of emotion came to rest upon my heart . He knelt with his arms around me , and we held each other in a sudden great stillness ; and in that moment I was all his , and he knew it . He might have stayed there hours if he had not moved or spoken ; but presently he lifted up his face and looked at me . Then he said two words . I ca n't repeat them , Boy ; but they brought me suddenly to my senses , and made me realise what it all meant . Garth Dalmain wanted me to marry him . "
54243	54251	54273	54273	Jane	101	" What else could it have meant ? "
54287	54295	54303	54303	Jane	101	" Well , dear , so you ? "
54296	54301	54303	54303	Jane	101	" I stood up , "
54305	54391	54408	54408	he	940	" for while he knelt there he was master of me , mind and body ; and some instinct told me that if I were to be won to wifehood , my reason must say ` yes ' before the rest of me . It is ` spirit , soul , and body ' in the Word , not ` body , soul , and spirit , ' as is so often misquoted ; and I believe the inspired sequence to be the right one . "
54401	54407	54408	54408	he	940	" Good heavens , Jane ! "
54411	54451	54469	54469	she	101	" You have got hold of a truth there , and you have expressed it exactly as I have often wanted to express it without being able to find the right words . You have found them , Jeanette . "
54462	54468	54469	54469	she	101	" Have I , Boy ? "
54472	54684	54751	54751	He	940	" Well , they have cost me dear . I put my lover from me and told him I must have twelve hours for calm reflection . He was so sure so sure of me , so sure of himself that he agreed without a protest . At my request he left me at once . The manner of his going I can not tell , even to you , Dicky . I promised to meet him at the village church next day and give him my answer . He was to try the new organ at eleven . We knew we should be alone . I came . He sent away the blower . He called me to him at the chancel step . The setting was so perfect . The artist in him sang for joy , and thrilled with expectation . The glory of absolute certainty was in his eyes ; though he had himself well in hand . He kept from touching me while he asked for my answer . Then I refused him , point blank , giving a reason he could not question . He turned from me and left the church , and I have not spoken to him from that day to this . "
54763	54773	54781	54781	Jane	101	" And why did you refuse him , Jane ? "
54790	55277	55307	55307	he	940	" Ah , Boy , I must make you understand ! How could I do otherwise , though , indeed , it was putting away the highest good life will ever hold for me ? Deryck , you know Garth well enough to realise how dependent he is on beauty ; he must be surrounded by it , perpetually . Before this unaccountable need of each other came to us he had talked to me quite freely on this point , saying of a plain person whose character and gifts he greatly admired , and whose face he grew to like in consequence : ' But of course it was not the sort of face one would have wanted to live with , or to have day after day opposite to one at table ; but then one was not called to that sort of discipline , which would be martyrdom to me . ' Oh , Deryck ! Could I have tied Garth to my plain face ? Could I have let myself become a daily , hourly discipline to that radiant , beauty - loving nature ? I know they say , ' Love is blind . ' But that is before Love has entered into his kingdom . Love desirous , sees only that , in the one beloved , which has awakened the desire . But Love content , regains full vision , and , as time goes on , those powers of vision increase and become , by means of daily , hourly , use , microscopic and telescopic . Wedded love is not blind . Bah ! An outsider staying with married people is apt to hear what love sees , on both sides , and the delusion of love 's blindness is dispelled forever . I know Garth was blind , during all those golden days , to my utter lack of beauty , because he wanted ME so much . But when he had had me , and had steeped himself in all I have to give of soul and spirit beauty ; when the daily routine of life began , which after all has to be lived in complexions , and with features to the fore ; when he sat down to breakfast and I saw him glance at me and then look away , when I was conscious that I was sitting behind the coffee - pot , looking my very plainest , and that in consequence my boy 's discipline had begun ; could I have borne it ? Should I not , in the miserable sense of failing him day by day , through no fault of my own , have grown plainer and plainer ; until bitterness and disappointment , and perhaps jealousy , all combined to make me positively ugly ? I ask you , Deryck , could I have borne it ? "
55292	55306	55307	55307	he	940	" How awfully well I diagnosed the case when I sent you abroad , "
55311	55321	55329	55329	Jane	101	" Really , with so little data to go upon "
55322	55327	55329	55329	Jane	101	" Oh , Boy , "
55337	55385	55406	55406	he	940	" do n't speak to me as if I were a patient . Treat me as a human being , at least , and tell me as man to man could I have tied Garth Dalmain to my plain face ? For you know it is plain . "
55400	55405	55406	55406	he	940	" My dear girl , "
55409	55664	55687	55687	Jane	101	" were we speaking as man to man , I should have a few very strong things to say to you . As we are speaking as man to woman , and as a man who has for a very long time respected , honoured , and admired a very dear and noble woman , I will answer your question frankly . You are not beautiful , in the ordinary acceptation of the word , and no one who really loves you would answer otherwise ; because no one who knows and loves you would dream of telling you a lie . We will even allow , if you like , that you are plain , although I know half a dozen young men who , were they here , would want to kick me into the street for saying so , and I should have to pretend in self - defence that their ears had played them false and I had said , ' You are JANE , ' which is all they would consider mattered . So long as you are yourself , your friends will be well content . At the same time , I may add , while this dear face is under discussion , that I can look back to times when I have felt that I would gladly walk twenty miles for a sight of it ; and in its absence I have always wished it present , and in its presence I have never wished it away . "
55665	55685	55727	55727	his	940	" Ah , but , Deryck , you did not have to have it always opposite you at meals , "
55690	55709	55723	55724	The doctor	940	" Unfortunately not . But I enjoyed the meals more on the happy occasions when it was there . "
55710	55722	55773	55774	the doctor	940	" And , Deryck YOU DID NOT HAVE TO KISS IT . "
55766	55771	55773	55774	the doctor	940	" No , dear , "
55780	55805	55852	55853	The doctor	940	" to my infinite credit be it recorded , that in all the years I have known it I have never once kissed it . "
55806	55851	55873	55873	he	940	" Dicky , do n't tease ! Oh , Boy , it is the most vital question of my whole life ; and if you do not now give me wise and thoughtful advice , all this difficult confession will have been for nothing . "
55869	55872	55873	55873	he	940	" Dear , "
55876	55929	55773	55774	the doctor	940	" forgive me if I seemed to take it lightly . My most earnest thought is wholly at your disposal . And now let me ask you a few questions . How did you ever succeed in convincing Dalmain that such a thing as this was an insuperable obstacle to your marriage ? "
55930	55940	55873	55873	he	940	" I did not give it as a reason . "
55941	55954	55773	55774	the doctor	940	" What then did you give as your reason for refusing him ? "
55955	55964	55873	55873	he	940	" I asked him how old he was . "
55965	55984	55773	55774	the doctor	940	" Jane ! Standing there beside him in the chancel , where he had come awaiting your answer ? "
55985	56005	55873	55873	he	940	" Yes . It did seem awful when I came to think it over afterwards . But it worked . "
56006	56017	55773	55774	the doctor	940	" I have no doubt it worked . What then ? "
56018	56067	55873	55873	he	940	" He said he was twenty - seven . I said I was thirty , and looked thirty - five , and felt forty . I also said he might be twenty - seven , but he looked nineteen , and I was sure he often felt nine . "
56068	56071	55773	55774	the doctor	940	" Well ? "
56072	56085	55873	55873	he	940	" Then I said that I could not marry a mere boy . "
56086	56091	55773	55774	the doctor	940	" And he acquiesced ? "
56092	56159	56165	56166	the doctor	940	" He seemed stunned at first . Then he said of course I could not marry him if I considered him that . He said it was the first time he had given a thought to himself in the matter . Then he said he bowed to my decision , and he walked down the church and went out , and we have not met since . "
56160	56163	56165	56166	the doctor	940	" Jane , "
56168	56207	55773	55774	the doctor	940	" I wonder he did not see through it . You are so unused to lying , that you can not have lied , on the chancel step , to the man you loved , with much conviction . "
56218	56260	56296	56297	the doctor	940	" Oh , Deryck , it was not entirely a lie . It was one of those dreadful lies which are ' part a truth , ' of which Tennyson says that they are ' a harder matter to fight . ' "
56261	56294	56304	56304	Jane	101	" ' A lie which is all a lie May be met and fought with outright ; But a lie which is part a truth Is a harder matter to fight , ' "
56299	56302	56304	56304	Jane	101	" Yes , "
56306	56450	56456	56457	the doctor	940	" And he could not fight this , just because it was partly true . He is younger than I by three years , and still more by temperament . It was partly for his delightful youthfulness that I feared my maturity and staidness . It was part a truth , but oh , Deryck , it was more a lie ; and it was altogether a lie to call him the man whom I had felt complete master of me the evening before ' a mere boy . ' Also he could not fight it because it took him so utterly by surprise . He had been all the time as completely without self - consciousness , as I had been morbidly full of it . His whole thought had been of me . Mine had been of him and of myself . "
56451	56454	56456	56457	the doctor	940	" Jane , "
56459	56475	56486	56486	she	101	" of all that you have suffered since that hour , you deserved every pang . "
56481	56485	56304	56304	Jane	101	" I know , "
56489	56609	56621	56621	she	101	" You were false to yourself , and not true to your lover . You robbed and defrauded both . Can not you now see your mistake ? To take it on the lowest ground , Dalmain , worshipper of beauty as he was , had had a surfeit of pretty faces . He was like the confectioner 's boy who when first engaged is allowed to eat all the cakes and sweets he likes , and who eats so many in the first week , that ever after he wants only plain bread - and - butter . YOU were Dal 's bread - and - butter . I am sorry if you do not like the simile . "
56613	56620	56854	56855	the doctor	940	" I do like the simile , "
56624	56852	56887	56887	she	101	" Ah , but you were far more than this , my dear girl . You were his ideal of womanhood . He believed in your strength and tenderness , your graciousness and truth . You shattered this ideal ; you failed this faith in you . His fanciful , artistic , eclectic nature with all its unused possibilities of faithful and passionate devotion , had found its haven in your love ; and in twelve hours you turned it adrift . Jane it was a crime . The magnificent strength of the fellow is shown by the way he took it . His progress in his art was not arrested . All his best work has been done since . He has made no bad mad marriage , in mockery of his own pain ; and no grand loveless one , to spite you . He might have done both I mean either . And when I realise that the poor fellow I was with yesterday making such a brave fight in the dark , and turning his head on the pillow to say with a gleam of hope on his drawn face : ` Where Thou art Guide , no ill can come ' had already been put through all this by you Jane , if you were a man , I 'd horsewhip you ! "
56877	56886	56887	56887	she	101	" You have lashed me well , Boy , "
56890	57200	57217	57217	he	940	" as only words spoken in faithful indignation can lash . And I feel the better for the pain . And now I think I ought to tell you that while I was on the top of the Great Pyramid I suddenly saw the matter from a different standpoint . You remember that view , with its sharp line of demarcation ? On one side the river , and verdure , vegetation , fruitfulness , a veritable ' garden enclosed ' ; on the other , vast space as far as the eye could reach ; golden liberty , away to the horizon , but no sign of vegetation , no hope of cultivation , just barren , arid , loneliness . I felt this was an exact picture of my life as I live it now . Garth 's love , flowing through it , as the river , could have made it a veritable ' garden of the Lord . ' It would have meant less liberty , but it would also have meant no loneliness . And , after all , the liberty to live for self alone becomes in time a weary bondage . Then I realised that I had condemned him also to this hard desert life . I came down and took counsel of the old Sphinx . Those calm , wise eyes , looking on into futurity , seemed to say : ' They only live who love . ' That evening I resolved to give up the Nile trip , return home immediately , send for Garth , admit all to him , asking him to let us both begin again just where we were three years ago in the moonlight on the terrace at Shenstone . Ten minutes after I had formed this decision , I heard of his accident . "
57210	57216	57217	57217	he	940	" The wheels of time , "
57224	57233	57241	57241	Jane	101	" move forward always ; backward , never . "
57234	57239	57250	57250	Flower	144	" Oh , Deryck , "
57257	57257	57271	57271	he	940	"
57266	57270	57271	57271	he	940	" I know , "
57274	57286	57288	57288	he	940	" that there is always one exception which proves every rule . "
57292	57337	57355	57355	Jane	101	" But , unquestionably , it helps to mend matters , so far as your own mental attitude is concerned , that before you knew of Dalmain 's blindness you should have admitted yourself wrong , and made up your mind to trust him . "
57338	57353	57355	57355	Jane	101	" I do n't know that I was altogether clear about having been wrong , "
57357	57413	57433	57433	he	940	" but I was quite convinced that I could n't live any longer without him , and was therefore prepared to risk it . And of course now , all doubt or need to question is swept away by my poor boy 's accident , which simplifies matters , where that particular point is concerned . "
57428	57432	57518	57519	the doctor	940	" Simplifies matters ? "
57508	57516	57523	57523	you	101	" And now , my dear Jeanette , "
57531	57531	57537	57537	Jane	101	"
57532	57535	57537	57537	Jane	101	" Doing ? "
57539	57653	57660	57661	the doctor	940	" Why , of course , I shall go straight to Garth . I only want you to advise me how best to let him know I am coming , and whether it is safe for him to have the emotion of my arrival . Also I do n't want to risk being kept from him by doctors or nurses . My place is by his side . I ask no better thing of life than to be always beside him . But sick - room attendants are apt to be pig - headed ; and a fuss under these circumstances would be unbearable . A wire from you will make all clear . "
57654	57658	57660	57661	the doctor	940	" I see , "
57664	57692	57789	57789	his	940	" Yes , a wire from me will undoubtedly open a way for you to Garth Dalmain 's bedside . And , arrived there , what then ? "
57740	57768	57804	57804	he	940	" What then , Deryck ? Love will know best what then . All barriers will be swept away , and Garth and I will be together . "
57798	57803	57804	57804	he	940	" Ah , Jane , "
57807	58261	58344	58344	he	940	" that is the woman 's point of view . It is certainly the simplest , and perhaps the best . But at Garth 's bedside you will be confronted with the man 's point of view ; and I should be failing the trust you have placed in me did I not put that before you now . From the man 's point of view , your own mistaken action three years ago has placed you now in an almost impossible position . If you go to Garth with the simple offer of your love the treasure he asked three years ago and failed to win he will naturally conclude the love now given is mainly pity ; and Garth Dalmain is not the man to be content with pity , where he has thought to win love , and failed . Nor would he allow any woman least of all his crown of womanhood to tie herself to his blindness unless he were sure such binding was her deepest joy . And how could you expect him to believe this in face of the fact that , when he was all a woman 's heart could desire , you refused him and sent him from you ? If , on the other hand , you explain , as no doubt you intend to do , the reason of that refusal , he can but say one thing : ' You could not trust me to be faithful when I had my sight . Blind , you come to me , when it is no longer in my power to prove my fidelity . There is no virtue in necessity . I can never feel I possess your trust , because you come to me only when accident has put it out of my power either to do the thing you feared , or to prove myself better than your doubts . ' My dear girl , that is how matters stand from the man 's point of view ; from his , I make no doubt , even more than from mine ; for I recognise in Garth Dalmain a stronger man than myself . Had it been I that day in the church , wanting you as he did , I should have grovelled at your feet and promised to grow up . Garth Dalmain had the iron strength to turn and go , without a protest , when the woman who had owned him mate the evening before , refused him on the score of inadequacy the next morning . I fear there is no question of the view he would take of the situation as it now stands . "
58275	58280	58344	58344	he	940	" But Deryck he loves "
58281	58307	58344	58344	he	940	" Just because he loves , my poor old girl , where you are concerned he could never be content with less than the best . "
58308	58326	58344	58344	he	940	" Oh , Boy , help me ! Find a way ! Tell me what to do ! "
58347	58531	58532	58532	Jane	101	" I see only one way out . If Dal could somehow be brought to realise your point of view at that time as a possible one , without knowing it had actually been the cause of your refusal of him , and could have the chance to express himself clearly on the subject to me , for instance in a way which might reach you without being meant to reach you , it might put you in a better position toward him . But it would be difficult to manage . If you could be in close contact with his mind , constantly near him unseen ah , poor chap , that is easy now I mean unknown to him ; if , for instance , you could be in the shoes of this nurse - companion person I am sending him , and get at his mind on the matter ; so that he could feel when you eventually made your confession , he had already justified himself to you , and thus gone behind his blindness , as it were . "
58538	58704	58714	58715	the doctor	940	" Deryck , I have it ! Oh , send ME as his nurse - companion ! He would never dream it was I. It is three years since he heard my voice , and he thinks me in Egypt . The society column in all the papers , a few weeks ago , mentioned me as wintering in Egypt and Syria and remaining abroad until May. Not a soul knows I have come home . You are the best judge as to whether I have had training and experience ; and all through the war our work was fully as much mental and spiritual , as surgical . It was not up to much otherwise . Oh , Dicky , you could safely recommend me ; and I still have my uniforms stowed away in case of need . I could be ready in twenty - four hours , and I would go as Sister anything , and eat in the kitchen if necessary . "
58705	58712	58714	58715	the doctor	940	" But , my dear girl , "
58718	59499	59507	59507	Jane	101	" you could not go as Sister Anything , unfortunately . You could only go as Nurse Rosemary Gray ; for I engaged her this morning , and posted a full and explicit account of her to Dr. Mackenzie , which he will read , to our patient . I never take a case from one nurse and give it to another , excepting for incompetency . And Nurse Rosemary Gray could more easily fly , than prove incompetent . She will not be required to eat in the kitchen . She is a gentlewoman , and will be treated as such . I wish indeed you could be in her shoes , though I doubt whether you could have carried it through And now I have something to tell you . Just before I left him , Dalmain asked after you . He sandwiched you most carefully in between the duchess and Flower ; but he could not keep the blood out of his thin cheeks , and he gripped the bedclothes in his effort to keep his voice steady . He asked where you were . I said , I believed , in Egypt . When you were coming home . I told him I had heard you intended returning to Jerusalem for Easter , and I supposed we might expect you home at the end of April or early in May. He inquired how you were . I replied that you were not a good correspondent , but I gathered from occasional cables and post - cards that you were very fit and having a good time . I then volunteered the statement that it was I who had sent you abroad because you were going all to pieces . He made a quick movement with his hand as if he would have struck me for using the expression . Then he said : ' Going to pieces ? SHE ! ' in a tone of most utter contempt for me and my opinions . Then he hastily made minute inquiries for Flower . He had already asked about the duchess all the questions he intended asking about you . When he had ascertained that Flower was at home and well , and had sent him her affectionate sympathy , he begged me to glance through a pile of letters which were waiting until he felt able to have them read to him , and to tell him any of the handwritings known to me . All the world seemed to have sent him letters of sympathy , poor chap . I told him a dozen or so of the names I knew , a royal handwriting among them . He asked whether there were any from abroad . There were two or three . I knew them all , and named them . He could not bear to hear any of them read ; even the royal letter remained unopened , though he asked to have it in his hand , and fingered the tiny crimson crown . Then he asked . ' Is there one from the duchess ? ' There was . He wished to hear that one , so I opened and read it . It was very characteristic of her Grace ; full of kindly sympathy , heartily yet tactfully expressed . Half - way through she said : ' Jane will be upset . I shall write and tell her next time she sends me an address . At present I have no idea in which quarter of the globe my dear niece is to be found . Last time I heard of her she seemed in a fair way towards marrying a little Jap and settling in Japan . Not a bad idea , my dear Dal , is it ? Though , if Japan is at all like the paper screens , I do n't know where in that Liliputian country they will find a house , or a husband , or a what - do - you - call-'em thing they ride in , solid enough for our good Jane ! ' With intuitive tact of a very high order , I omitted this entire passage about marrying the Jap . When your aunt 's letter was finished , he asked point blank whether there was one from you . I said No , but that it was unlikely the news had reached you , and I felt sure you would write when it did . So I hope you will , dear ; and Nurse Rosemary Gray will have instructions to read all his letters to him . "
59500	59505	59507	59507	Jane	101	" Oh , Deryck , "
59510	59523	59569	59569	Jane	101	" I ca n't bear it ! I must go to him ! "
59544	59568	59578	59579	the doctor	940	" Hullo ! ... Yes , it is Dr. Brand .... Who is speaking ? ... Oh , is it you , Matron ? "
59587	59721	59751	59751	he	940	" Yes ? What name did you say ? ... Undoubtedly . This morning ; quite definitely . A most important case . She is to call and see me to - night ... What ? ... Mistake on register ? Ah , I see ... Gone where ? ... Where ? ... Spell it , please ... Australia ! Oh , quite out of reach ! ... Yes , I heard he was ordered there ... Never mind , Matron . You are in no way to blame ... Thanks , I think not . I have some one in view ... Yes .... Yes .... No doubt she might do ... I will let you know if I should require her ... Good - bye , Matron , and thank you . "
59747	59750	59751	59751	he	940	" Jeanette , "
59754	59782	59801	59802	the doctor	940	" I do not believe in chance . But I do believe in a Higher Control , which makes and unmakes our plans . You shall go . "
59790	59799	59801	59802	the doctor	940	" And now as to ways and means , "
59809	59832	59840	59840	Jane	101	" You must leave by the night mail from Euston , the day after to - morrow . Can you be ready ? "
59833	59838	59801	59802	the doctor	940	" I am ready , "
59842	59851	59860	59860	Jane	101	" You must go as Nurse Rosemary Gray . "
59852	59859	59860	59860	Jane	101	" I do n't like that , "
59863	59886	59801	59802	the doctor	940	" I should prefer a fictitious name . Suppose the real Rosemary Gray turned up , or some one who knows her . "
59887	60076	59860	59860	Jane	101	" My , dear girl , she is half - way to Australia by now , and you will see no one up there but the household and the doctor . Any one who turned up would be more likely to know you . We must take these risks . Besides , in case of complications arising , I will give you a note , which you can produce at once , explaining the situation , and stating that in agreeing to fill the breach you consented at my request to take the name in order to prevent any necessity for explanations to the patient , which at this particular juncture would be most prejudicial . I can honestly say this , it being even more true than appears . So you must dress the part , Jane , and endeavour to look the part , so far as your five foot eleven will permit ; for please remember that I have described you to Dr. Mackenzie as ' a pretty , dainty little thing , refined and elegant , and considerably more capable than she looks . ' "
60077	60095	59801	59802	the doctor	940	" Dicky ! He will instantly realise that I am not the person mentioned in your letter . "
60096	60453	60469	60469	Jane	101	" Not so , dear . Remember we have to do with a Scotchman , and a Scotchman never realises anything ' instantly . ' The Gaelic mind works slowly , though it works exceeding sure . He will be exceeding sure , when he has contemplated you for a while , that I am a ' ve rra poor judge o ' women , ' and that Nurse Gray is a far finer woman than I described . But he will have already created for Dalmain , from my letter , a mental picture of his nurse ; which is all that really matters . We must trust to Providence that old Robbie does not proceed to amend it by the original . Try to forestall any such conversation . If the good doctor seems to mistrust you , take him on one side , show him my letter , and tell him the simple truth . But I do not suppose this will be necessary . With the patient , you must remember the extreme sensitiveness of a blind man 's hearing . Tread lightly . Do not give him any opportunity to judge of your height . Try to remember that you are not supposed to be able to reach the top shelf of an eight - foot bookcase without the aid of steps or a chair . And when the patient begins to stand and walk , try to keep him from finding out that his nurse is slightly taller than himself . This should not be difficult ; one of his fixed ideas being that in his blindness he will not be touched by a woman . His valet will lead him about . And , Jane , I can not imagine any one who has ever had your hand in his , failing to recognise it . So I advise you , from the first , to avoid shaking hands . But all these precautions do not obviate the greatest difficulty of all , your voice . Do you suppose , for a moment , he will not recognise that ? "
60454	60467	60469	60469	Jane	101	" I shall take the bull by the horns in that case , "
60471	60506	60518	60518	he	940	" and you must help me . Explain the fact to me now , as you might do if I were really Nurse Rosemary Gray , and had a voice so like my own . "
60511	60517	60518	60518	he	940	" My dear Nurse Rosemary , "
60521	60555	60563	60563	Jane	101	" you must not be surprised if our patient detects a remarkable similarity between your voice and that of a mutual friend of his and mine . I have constantly noticed it myself . "
60556	60561	60563	60563	Jane	101	" Indeed , sir , "
60565	60577	60587	60588	the doctor	940	" And may I know whose voice mine so closely resembles ? "
60578	60585	60596	60596	he	940	" The Honourable Jane Champion 's , "
60603	60609	60615	60615	Jane	101	" Do you know her ? "
60610	60613	60615	60615	Jane	101	" Slightly , "
60617	60633	60635	60635	they	1242	" and I hope to know her better and better as the years go by . "
60639	60695	60811	60811	They	1243	" Thank you , Dicky . Now I shall know what to say to the patient . Ah , but the misery of it ! Think of it being possible thus to deceive Garth , Garth of the bright , keen all perceiving vision ! Shall I ever have the courage to carry it through ? "
60696	60810	60828	60828	Jane	101	" If you value your own eventual happiness and his you will , dear . And now I must order the brougham and speed you to Portland Place , or you will be late for dinner , a thing the duchess can not overlook ' as you very well know , ' even in a traveller returned from round the world . And if you take my advice , you will tell your kind , sensible old aunt the whole story , omitting of course all moonlight details , and consult her about this plan . Her shrewd counsel will be invaluable , and you may be glad of her assistance later on . "
60823	60826	60828	60828	Jane	101	" Boy , "
60832	60854	60860	60861	the doctor	940	" you have been so good to me , and so faithful . Whatever happens , I shall be grateful always . "
60855	60858	61110	61111	the doctor	940	" Hush , "
60863	61109	61110	61111	the doctor	940	" No need for gratitude when long - standing debts are paid . To - morrow I shall not have a free moment , and I foresee the next day as very full also . But we might dine together at Euston at seven , and I will see you off . Your train leaves at eight o'clock , getting you to Aberdeen soon after seven the next morning , and out to Gleneesh in time for breakfast . You will enjoy arriving in the early morning light ; and the air of the moors braces you wonderfully . Thank you , Stoddart . Miss Champion is ready . Hullo , Flower ! Look up , Jane . Flower , and Dicky , and Blossom , are hanging over the topmost banisters , dropping you showers of kisses . Yes , the river you mentioned does produce a veritable ' garden of the Lord . ' God send you the same , dear . And now , sit well back , and lower your veil . Ah , I remember , you do n't wear them . Wise girl ! If all women followed your example it would impoverish the opticians . Why ? Oh , constant focussing on spots , for one thing . But lean back , for you must not be seen if you are supposed to be still in Cairo , waiting to go up the Nile . And , look here "
61120	61149	61158	61158	Jane	101	" very plain luggage , mind . The sort of thing nurses speak of as ' my box ' ; with a very obvious R. G. on it ! "
61150	61156	61158	61158	Jane	101	" Thank you , Boy , "
61160	61166	61175	61176	the doctor	940	" You think of everything . "
61167	61173	61201	61205	NURSE ROSEMARY Nurse Rosemary Gray	228	" I think of YOU , "
61215	61217	61546	61546	Garth	111	" box "
61565	61593	61546	61546	Garth	111	" I should like you to see Castle Gleneesh . You would enjoy the view from the terrace ; and the pine woods , and the moor . "
61606	61609	61673	61673	Jane	101	" best party "
61679	61690	61957	61957	She	101	" Yes , ask us , and see what happens . "
61960	61963	61987	61987	She	101	" Nurse Gray "
61992	62008	62458	62458	She	101	" You old dear ! How I shall enjoy being in the house with you ! "
62443	62457	62532	62532	She	101	" Anoint and cheer our soiled face With the abundance of Thy grace . "
62536	62548	62550	62550	Deryck	107	" Shall I ever have the courage to carry it through ? "
62556	62570	62605	62605	he	127	" If you value your own eventual happiness and his , you will . "
62594	62604	62605	62605	he	127	" Dr. Mackenzie is in the library , nurse , "
62608	62616	62634	62636	Nurse Rosemary Gray	228	" and wishes to see you there . "
62617	62632	62660	62662	Dr. Robert Mackenzie	216	" Then , will you kindly take me to the library , Mr. Simpson , "
62669	62672	62660	62662	Dr. Robert Mackenzie	216	" Dr. Rob "
62674	62678	62883	62884	his friends	1309	" Old Robbie , "
62891	62911	63035	63035	Deryck	107	" Robbie chews up dozens of good pen - holders , while Dr. Mackenzie is thinking out excellent prescriptions . "
63050	63079	63115	63115	he	1314	" The Gaelic mind works slowly , though it works exceeding sure . He will be exceeding sure that I am a verra poor judge o ' women . "
63110	63114	63145	63145	Jane	101	" Nurse er ? "
63139	63143	63197	63199	Dr. Robert Mackenzie	216	" Rosemary Gray , "
63192	63195	63197	63199	Dr. Robert Mackenzie	216	" Ah , "
63201	63205	63313	63313	he	107	" I see . "
63321	63356	63418	63418	he	107	" My dear Nurse SO - AND - SO , pray sit down . People who have much unavoidable standing to do should cultivate the habit of seating themselves comfortably at every possible opportunity . "
63408	63417	63447	63447	his	107	" So you have arrived , Nurse Gray , "
63421	63431	63492	63492	she	101	" Truly the mind of a Scotchman works slowly , "
63482	63491	63530	63530	he	107	" Yes , sir , I have arrived , "
63518	63529	63545	63545	Jane	101	" I am glad you have arrived , Nurse Gray , "
63533	63543	63552	63553	the duchess	304	" I am glad TO have arrived , sir , "
63556	63561	63634	63635	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" Ha , ha ! "
63648	63719	63850	63850	he	216	" I understand , Miss Gray , you have come to minister to the patient 's mind rather than to his body . You need not trouble to explain . I have it from Sir Deryck Brand , who prescribed a nurse - companion for the patient , and engaged you . I fully agreed with his prescription ; and , allow me to say , I admire its ingredients . "
63828	63849	63850	63850	he	216	" And I think there remains very little for me to say to you about the treatment , Miss Gray , "
63854	63930	63978	63978	she	101	" You will have received minute instructions from Sir Deryck himself . The great thing now is to help the patient to take an interest in the outer world . The temptation to persons who suddenly become totally blind , is to form a habit of living entirely in a world within ; a world of recollection , retrospection , and imagination ; the only world , in fact , in which they can see . "
63974	63977	63978	63978	she	101	" Yes ? "
63981	63987	63993	63994	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" Do tell me more . "
63988	63991	63993	63994	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" This , "
63996	64237	64282	64283	Dr. Rob	217	" is our present difficulty with Mr. Dalmain . There seems to be no possibility of arousing his interest in the outside world . He refuses to receive visitors ; he declines to hear his letters . Hours pass without a word being spoken by him . Unless you hear him speak to me or to his valet , you will easily suppose yourself to have a patient who has lost the power of speech as well as the gift of sight . Should he express a wish to speak to me alone when we are with him , do not leave the room . Walk over to the fireplace and remain there . I desire that you should hear , that when he chooses to rouse and make an effort , he is perfectly well able to do so . The most important part of your duties , Nurse Gray , will be the aiding him day by day to resume life , the life of a blind man , it is true ; but not therefore necessarily an inactive life . Now that all danger of inflammation from the wounds has subsided , he may get up , move about , learn to find his way by sound and touch . He was an artist by profession . He will never paint again . But there are other gifts which may form reasonable outlets to an artistic nature . "
64275	64280	64398	64398	Jane	101	" Does he play ? "
64297	64319	64327	64329	the little doctor	1329	" Sir Deryck did not happen to mention to me , Dr. Mackenzie , whether Mr. Dalmain is musical or not . "
64320	64325	64327	64329	the little doctor	1329	" Ah , well , "
64344	64368	64375	64375	Jane	101	" you must make it your business to find out . And , by the way , Nurse , do you play yourself ? "
64369	64373	64382	64383	Dr. Rob	217	" A little , "
64377	64380	64382	64383	Dr. Rob	217	" Ah , "
64385	64397	64398	64398	Jane	101	" And I dare say you sing a little , too ? "
64401	64515	64535	64535	she	101	" In that case , my dear lady , I leave most explicit orders that you neither sing a little nor play a little to Mr. Dalmain . We , who have our sight , can just endure while people who ' play a little ' show us how little they can play ; because we are able to look round about us and think of other things . But to a blind man , with an artist 's sensitive soul , the experience might culminate in madness . We must not risk it . I regret to appear uncomplimentary , but a patient 's welfare must take precedence of all other considerations . "
64527	64534	64535	64535	she	101	" I will be most careful , "
64538	64549	64555	64556	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" neither to play nor to sing to Mr. Dalmain . "
64550	64553	64555	64556	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" Good , "
64558	64778	64869	64869	Tommy	100	" But now let me tell you what you most certainly may do , by - and - by . Lead him to the piano . Place him there upon a seat where he will feel secure ; none of your twirly , rickety stools . Make a little notch on the key - board by which he can easily find middle C. Then let him relieve his pent - up soul by the painting of sound - pictures . You will find this will soon keep him happy for hours . And , if he is already something of a musician , as that huge grand piano , with no knick - knacks on it indicates , he may begin that sort of thing at once , before he is ready to be worried with the Braille system , or any other method of instructing the blind . But contrive an easy way a little notch in the wood - work below the note by means of which , without hesitation or irritation , he can locate himself instantly at middle C. Never mind the other notes . It is all the SEEING he will require when once he is at the piano . Ha , ha ! Not bad for a Scotchman , eh , Nurse Gray ? "
64886	64895	64902	64903	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" Kick him out ! Stop his jaw ! "
64896	64900	64902	64903	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" And now , "
64906	64925	64982	64983	Dr. Rob	217	" the next thing to be done , Nurse Gray , is to introduce you to the patient . "
64963	64980	64994	64994	Jane	101	" A decanter of sherry , a wine - glass , and a couple of biscuits , "
64988	64992	64994	64994	Jane	101	" Little beast ! "
64996	65004	65050	65051	Dr. Rob	217	" At eleven o'clock in the morning ! "
65070	65088	65089	65089	Jane	101	" Now , Nurse , sit down and drink that , and take a biscuit with it . "
65092	65101	65114	65115	Dr. Rob	217	" But , indeed , doctor , I never "
65102	65112	65114	65115	Dr. Rob	217	" I have no doubt you ' never , ' "
65117	65270	65406	65406	he	1335	" especially at eleven o'clock in the morning . But you will to - day ; so do not waste any time in discussion . You have had a long night journey ; you are going upstairs to a very sad sight indeed , a strain on the nerves and sensibilities . You have come through a trying interview with me , and you are praising Heaven it is over . But you will praise Heaven with more fervency when you have drunk the sherry . Also you have been standing during twenty - three minutes and a half . I always stand to speak myself , and I prefer folk should stand to listen . I can never talk to people while they loll around . But you will walk upstairs all the more steadily , Nurse Rosemary Gray , if you sit down now for five minutes at this table . "
65400	65405	65406	65406	he	1335	" Now , Nurse , "
65409	65468	65544	65544	he	1335	" follow me upstairs , and , just at first , speak as little as possible . Remember , every fresh voice intruding into the still depths of that utter blackness , causes an agony of bewilderment and disquietude to the patient . Speak little and speak low , and may God Almighty give you tact and wisdom . "
65533	65543	65595	65595	Jane	101	" May God Almighty give you tact and wisdom , "
65576	65587	65893	65893	Deryck	107	" Where Thou art Guide , no ill can come . "
65903	65913	65953	65953	he	216	" If you value your own eventual happiness and his "
65990	66190	66219	66219	SHE	101	" Good morning , Mr. Dalmain . Simpson tells me it has been an excellent night , the best you have yet had . Now that is good . No doubt you were relieved to be rid of Johnson , capable though he was , and to be back in the hands of your own man again . These trained attendants are never content with doing enough ; they always want to do just a little more , and that little more is a weariness to the patient . Now I have brought you to - day one who is prepared to do all you need , and yet who , I feel sure , will never annoy you by attempting more than you desire . Sir Deryck Brand 's prescription , Nurse Rosemary Gray , is here ; and I believe she is prepared to be companion , secretary , reader , anything you want , in fact a new pair of eyes for you , Mr. Dalmain , with a clever brain behind them , and a kind , sympathetic , womanly heart directing and controlling that brain . Nurse Gray arrived this morning , Mr. Dalmain . "
66221	66225	66257	66258	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" Nurse Gray . "
66262	66274	66306	66306	he	1343	" Nurse Rosemary Gray is in the room , Mr. Dalmain . "
66315	66343	66356	66357	Dr. Rob	217	" How do you do ? I am sure it is most kind of you to come so far . I hope you had an easy journey . "
66367	66404	66421	66423	the tired voice	1345	" Miss Gray had a very good journey , and looks as fresh this morning as if she had spent the night in bed . I can see she is a cold - water young lady . "
66405	66419	66463	66463	he	217	" I hope my housekeeper will make her comfortable . Please give orders , "
66470	66570	66589	66589	Jane	101	" Come over to the window , Nurse Gray . I want to show you a special chair we have obtained for Mr. Dalmain , in which he will be most comfortable as soon as he feels inclined to sit up . You see ? Here is an adjustable support for the head , if necessary ; and these various trays and stands and movable tables can be swung round into any position by a touch . I consider it excellent , and Sir Deryck approved it . Have you seen one of this kind before , Nurse Gray ? "
66571	66587	66647	66648	Garth Dalmain	111	" We had one at the hospital , but not quite so complete as this , "
66638	66645	66677	66678	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" WHO is in the room ? "
66681	66698	66711	66711	Garth	111	" No one is in the room , Mr. Dalmain , but myself and Nurse Gray . "
66699	66709	66711	66711	Garth	111	" There IS some one else in the room ! "
66714	66726	66761	66761	she	101	" How dare you lie to me ! Who was speaking ? "
66751	66760	66761	66761	she	101	" It was I who spoke , sir , "
66764	66825	66842	66842	he	111	" Nurse Rosemary Gray . And I feel sure I know why my voice startled you . Dr. Brand warned me it might do so . He said I must not be surprised if you detected a remarkable similarity between my voice and that of a mutual friend of yours and his . He said he had often noticed it . "
66846	66853	66883	66883	he	111	" Did he say whose voice ? "
66854	66870	66883	66883	he	111	" Yes , for I asked him . He said it was Miss Champion 's . "
66900	67034	67068	67069	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" You must forgive me , Miss Gray , for being so startled and so stupidly , unpardonably agitated . But , you know , being blind is still such a new experience , and every fresh voice which breaks through the black curtain of perpetual night , means so infinitely more than the speaker realises . The resemblance in your voice to that of the lady Sir Deryck mentioned is so remarkable that , although I know her to be at this moment in Egypt , I could scarcely believe she was not in the room . And yet the most unlikely thing in the world would be that she should have been in this room . So I owe you and Dr. Mackenzie most humble apologies for my agitation and unbelief . "
67056	67065	67068	67069	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" Now , Nurse , if you please , "
67077	67091	67102	67103	Dr. Rob	217	" I have a few more details to explain to you over here . "
67106	67116	67118	67118	Garth	111	" I suppose I will have to be going . "
67121	67137	67151	67151	Jane	101	" I wish to speak to you alone , doctor , for a few minutes . "
67138	67149	67244	67244	he	1351	" I will wait for you downstairs , Dr. Mackenzie , "
67237	67243	67272	67272	he	1351	" Now , Mr. Dalmain , "
67268	67271	67272	67272	he	1351	" Doctor , "
67275	67287	67342	67342	he	1351	" tell me about this nurse . Describe her to me . "
67333	67341	67342	67342	he	1351	" Describe her to me , doctor , "
67345	67356	67374	67375	Dr. Rob	217	" this Nurse Rosemary Gray , as you call her . "
67357	67372	67374	67375	Dr. Rob	217	" But it is not a pet name of mine , my dear sir , "
67378	67406	67415	67415	Garth	111	" It is the young lady 's own name , and a pretty one , too . ' Rosemary for remembrance . ' Is not that Shakespeare ? "
67407	67413	67476	67476	he	217	" Describe her to me , "
67472	67475	67506	67506	you	1356	" Well , "
67510	67510	67518	67518	Garth	111	"
67511	67516	67549	67550	Dr. Rob	217	" Dark or fair ? "
67544	67547	67525	67525	he	940	" Fair , "
67576	67579	67593	67594	Dr. Rob	217	" Hair ? "
67588	67591	67593	67594	Dr. Rob	217	" Well , "
67597	67649	67669	67669	he	111	" it is mostly tucked away under a modest little cap ; but , were it not for that wise restraint , I should say it might be that kind of fluffy , fly - away floss - silk , which puts the finishing touch to a dainty , pretty woman . "
67665	67668	67669	67669	he	111	" Doctor , "
67672	67722	67731	67732	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" I know I have given you heaps of trouble , and to - day you must think me a fool . But if you do not wish me to go mad in my blindness , send that girl away . Do not let her enter my room again . "
67723	67729	67731	67732	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" Now , Mr. Dalmain , "
67735	67780	67801	67801	he	111	" let us consider this thing . We may take it you have nothing against this young lady excepting a chance resemblance in her voice to that of a friend of yours now far away . Was not this other lady a pleasant person ? "
67795	67800	67801	67801	he	111	" Oh , yes , "
67812	67812	67822	67823	Dr. Rob	217	"
67813	67820	67822	67823	Dr. Rob	217	" ' Rosemary for remembrance , ' "
67825	67887	67899	67899	Garth	111	" Then why should not Nurse Rosemary call up a pleasant remembrance ? Also it seems to me to be a kind , sweet , womanly voice , which is something to be thankful for nowadays , when so many women talk , fit to scare the crows ; cackle , cackle , cackle like stones rattling in a tin canister . "
67888	67897	67899	67899	Garth	111	" But ca n't you understand , doctor , "
67902	67957	67971	67972	Dr. Rob	217	" that it is just the remembrance and the resemblance which , in my blindness , I can not bear ? I have nothing against her voice , Heaven knows ! But I tell you , when I heard it first I thought it was it was she the other come to me here and "
67964	67969	67971	67972	Dr. Rob	217	" The pleasant lady ? "
67974	68067	68098	68098	he	111	" I see . Well now , Mr. Dalmain , Sir Deryck said the best thing that could happen would be if you came to wish for visitors . It appears you have many friends ready and anxious to come any distance in order to bring you help or cheer . Why not let me send for this pleasant lady ? I make no doubt she would come . Then when she herself had sat beside you , and talked with you , the nurse 's voice would trouble you no longer . "
68092	68097	68098	68098	he	111	" No , doctor , "
68101	68126	68146	68146	he	216	" Oh , my God , no ! In the whole world , she is the last person I would have enter this room ! "
68141	68145	68156	68156	Garth	111	" And why ? "
68151	68154	68156	68156	Garth	111	" Because , "
68158	68253	68260	68261	Dr. Rob	217	" that pleasant lady , as you rightly call her , has a noble , generous heart , and it might overflow with pity for my blindness ; and pity from her I could not accept . It would be the last straw upon my heavy cross . I can bear the cross , doctor ; I hope in time to carry it manfully , until God bids me lay it down . But that last straw HER pity would break me . I should fall in the dark , to rise no more . "
68254	68258	68260	68261	Dr. Rob	217	" I see , "
68264	68275	68296	68296	he	217	" Poor laddie ! The pleasant lady must not come . "
68292	68295	68296	68296	he	217	" Meanwhile , "
68299	68430	68439	68439	he	111	" I must rely on you , Mr. Dalmain , to be agreeable to Nurse Rosemary Gray , and not to make her task too difficult . I dare not send her back . She is Dr. Brand 's choice . Besides think of the cruel blow to her in her profession . Think of it , man ! sent off at a moment 's notice , after spending five minutes in her patient 's room , because , forsooth , her voice maddened him ! Poor child ! What a statement to enter on her report ! See her appear before the matron with it ! Ca n't you be generous and unselfish enough to face whatever trial there may be for you in this bit of a coincidence ? "
68434	68438	68439	68439	he	111	" Dr. Mackenzie , "
68444	68463	68474	68475	Dr. Rob	217	" will you swear to me that your description of this young lady was accurate in every detail ? "
68464	68472	68474	68475	Dr. Rob	217	" ' Swear not at all , ' "
68478	68570	68579	68579	Garth	111	" I had a pious mother , laddie . Besides I can do better than that . I will let you into a secret . I was reading from Sir Deryck 's letter . I am no authority on women myself , having always considered dogs and horses less ensnaring and more companionable creatures . So I would not trust my own eyes , but preferred to give you Sir Deryck 's description . You will allow him to be a fine judge of women . You have seen Lady Brand ? "
68571	68577	68579	68579	Garth	111	" Seen her ? Yes , "
68590	68643	68649	68650	Dr. Rob	217	" and more than that , I 've painted her . Ah , such a picture ! standing at a table , the sunlight in her hair , arranging golden daffodils in an old Venetian vase . Did you see it , doctor , in the New Gallery , two years ago ? "
68644	68647	68667	68667	he	217	" No , "
68652	68666	68667	68667	he	217	" I am not finding myself in galleries , new or old . But "
68679	68690	68696	68696	Garth	111	" Nurse Gray was telling me she had seen it . "
68691	68694	68696	68696	Garth	111	" Really ? "
68700	68711	68722	68723	Dr. Rob	217	" Somehow one does not connect nurses with picture galleries . "
68712	68720	68722	68723	Dr. Rob	217	" I do n't know why not , "
68725	68797	68867	68867	he	111	" They must go somewhere for their outings . They ca n't be everlastingly nosing shop windows in all weathers ; so why not go in and have a look at your pictures ? Besides , Miss Rosemary is a young lady of parts . Sir Deryck assures me she is a gentlewoman by birth , well - read and intelligent . Now , laddie , what is it to be ? "
68830	68866	68881	68881	herself	101	" If only I could quite disassociate the voice from the from that other personality . If I could be quite sure that , though her voice is so extraordinarily like , she herself is not "
68884	68906	68912	68913	Dr. Rob	217	" is not at all like the face and figure which stand clear in my remembrance as associated with that voice . "
68907	68910	68912	68913	Dr. Rob	217	" Well , "
68915	69009	69035	69035	he	111	" I 'm thinking we can manage that for you . These nurses know their patients must be humoured . We will call the young lady back , and she shall kneel down beside your bed Bless you ! She wo n't mind , with me to play old Gooseberry ! and you shall pass your hands over her face and hair , and round her little waist , and assure yourself , by touch , what an elegant , dainty little person it is , in a blue frock and white apron . "
69027	69034	69035	69035	he	111	" Of all the preposterous suggestions ! "
69038	69101	69110	69111	Dr. Rob	217	" Good heavens ! What an ass I must have been making of myself ! And I begin to think I have exaggerated the resemblance . In a day or two , I shall cease to notice it . And , look here , doctor , if she really was interested in that portrait Here , I say where are you going ? "
69102	69108	69110	69111	Dr. Rob	217	" All right , sir , "
69113	69157	69035	69035	he	111	" I was merely moving a chair over to the fireside , and taking the liberty of pouring out a glass of water . Really you are becoming abnormally quick of hearing . Now I am all attention . What about the portrait ? "
69158	69353	69368	69369	Dr. Rob	217	" I was only going to say , if she the nurse , you know is really interested in my portrait of Lady Brand , there are studies of it up in the studio , which she might care to see . If she brought them here and described them to me I could explain But , I say , doctor . I ca n't have dainty young ladies in and out of my room while I 'm in bed . Why should n't I get up and try that chair of yours ? Send Simpson along ; and tell him to look out my brown lounge - suit and orange tie . Good heavens ! what a blessing to have the MEMORY of colours and of how they blend ! Think of the fellows who are BORN blind . And please ask Miss Gray to go out in the pine wood , or on the moor , or use the motor , or rest , or do anything she likes . Tell her to make herself quite at home ; but on no account to come up here until Simpson reports me ready . "
69354	69366	69368	69369	Dr. Rob	217	" You may rely on Nurse Gray to be most discreet , "
69379	69425	69435	69435	Garth	111	" And as for getting up , laddie , do n't go too fast . You will not find your strength equal to much . But I am bound to tell you there is nothing to keep you in bed if you feel like rising . "
69426	69433	69435	69435	Garth	111	" Good - bye , doctor , "
69442	69459	69486	69487	Dr. Rob	217	" and I am sorry I shall never be able to offer to paint Mrs. Mackenzie ! "
69460	69484	69486	69487	Dr. Rob	217	" You 'd have to paint her with a shaggy head , four paws , and the softest amber eyes in the world , "
69490	69605	69672	69672	he	216	" and , looking out from those eyes , the most faithful , loving dog - heart in creation . In all the years we 've kept house together she has never failed to meet me with a welcome , never contradicted me or wanted the last word , and never worried me for so much as the price of a bonnet . There 's a woman for you ! Well , good - bye , lad , and God Almighty bless you . And be careful how you go . Do not be surprised if I look in again on my way back from my rounds to see how you like that chair . "
69667	69671	69672	69672	he	216	" My dear , "
69675	69917	69932	69932	Jane	101	" I feel myself somewhat of a blundering old fool . You must forgive me . I never contemplated putting you through such an ordeal . I perfectly understand that , while he hesitated , you must have felt your whole career at stake . I see you have been weeping ; but you must not take it too much to heart that our patient made so much of your voice resembling this Miss Champion 's . He will forget all about it in a day or two , and you will be worth more to him than a dozen Miss Champions . See what good you have done him already . Here he is wanting to get up and explain his pictures to you . Never you fear . You will soon win your way , and I shall be able to report to Sir Deryck what a fine success you have made of the case . Now I must see the valet and give him very full instructions . And I recommend you to go for a blow on the moor and get an appetite for lunch . Only put on something warmer than that . You will have no sick - room work to do ; and having duly impressed me with your washableness and serviceableness , you may as well wear something comfortable to protect you from our Highland nip . Have you warmer clothing with you ? "
69918	69930	69932	69932	Jane	101	" It is the rule of our guild to wear uniform , "
69934	69942	69672	69672	he	216	" but I have a grey merino . "
69943	69979	69986	69986	Jane	101	" Ah , I see . Well , wear the grey merino . I shall return in two hours to observe how he stands that move . Now , do n't let me keep you . "
69980	69984	69986	69986	Jane	101	" Dr. Mackenzie , "
69989	70021	70068	70068	he	217	" may I ask why you described me as fair ; and my very straight , heavy , plainly coiled hair , as fluffy , fly - away floss - silk ? "
70056	70067	70068	70068	he	217	" Why certainly you may ask , Nurse Rosemary Gray , "
70071	70178	70204	70204	Jane	101	" though I wonder you think it necessary to do so . It was of course perfectly evident to me that , for reasons of his own , Sir Deryck wished to paint an imaginary portrait of you to the patient , most likely representing some known ideal of his . As the description was so different from the reality , I concluded that , to make the portrait complete , the two touches unfortunately left to me to supply , had better be as unlike what I saw before me as the rest of the picture . And now , if you will be good enough "
70186	70202	70217	70218	Dr. Rob	217	" And why did you take the risk of suggesting that he should feel me ? "
70206	70215	70217	70218	Dr. Rob	217	" Because I knew he was a gentleman , "
70221	70256	70266	70266	him	217	" Oh , come in , Simpson come in , my good fellow and shut that door ! And God Almighty be praised that He made you and me MEN , and not women ! "
70274	70302	70411	70412	Dr. Rob	217	" Deryck was right . But what a queer mixture of shrewdness and obtuseness , and how marvellously it worked out to the furtherance of our plans . "
70398	70409	70422	70423	Dr. Mackenzie	216	" Now what has brought the Honourable Jane up here ? "
70414	70420	70435	70436	Dr. Rob	217	" Dashed if I know , "
70425	70433	70435	70436	Dr. Rob	217	" You must not swear , laddie , "
70438	70445	70545	70545	I	0	" you had a pious mother . "
70535	70543	70686	70686	he	3099	" I hope you are quite well ; "
70689	70697	70723	70727	a careful and thoughtful judge	1373	" Oh , my God , NO ! "
70735	70738	70887	70887	Migdol	69	" cat , "

71234	71237	71251	71253	anybody passing "	3317	" put on "
71253	71259	71338	71338	Margery	147	" gives it a stir . "
71340	71343	71384	71384	Margery	147	" porridge , "
71387	71395	71507	71507	They	1392	" Stir the porridge , Nurse Gray . "
71509	71511	71507	71507	They	1392	" whenever "
71513	71516	71803	71803	he	230	" when , "
71807	71813	71995	71995	his	230	" Yessir ; certainly sir , "
72000	72008	72046	72046	She	247	" Certainly , miss . Quite so . "
72053	72195	72216	72216	she	1407	" And a very good thing , too , I am thinking . For Master Garth , poor laddie , was always so set upon having beauty about him . ' Master Garthie , ' I would say to him , when he had friends coming , and all his ideas in talking over the dinner concerned the cleaning up of the old silver , and putting out of Valentine glass and Worstered china ; ' Master Garthie , ' I would say , feeling the occasion called for the apt quoting of Scripture , ' it appears to me your attention is given entirely to the outside of the cup and platter , and you care nothing for all the good things that lie within . ' So it is just as well to keep him deceived , Miss Gray . "
72226	72253	72492	72493	Nurse Rosemary	228	" For , though a homey face may indeed be redeemed by its kindly expression , you can not very well explain expression to the blind . "
72486	72491	73000	73000	I	0	" a mere boy . "
72953	72985	73080	73080	herself	228	" Trust in the Lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . In all thy ways acknowledge Him , and He shall direct thy paths . "
73083	73085	73554	73554	Garth	111	" gone "
73543	73552	73563	73564	Nurse Rosemary	228	" A man 's letter , Miss Gray , "
73557	73561	73563	73564	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Quite right , "
73566	73572	73618	73619	Nurse Rosemary	228	" How did you know ? "
73573	73611	73618	73619	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Because it was on one sheet . A woman 's letter on a matter of great importance would have run to two , if not three . And that letter was on a matter of importance . "
73612	73616	73618	73619	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Right again , "
73623	73632	73618	73619	Nurse Rosemary	228	" And again , how did you know ? "
73633	73662	73663	73664	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Because you gave a little sigh of relief after reading the first line , and another , as you folded it and replaced it in the envelope . "
73667	73693	73704	73704	Garth	111	" You are getting on so fast , Mr. Dalmain , that soon we shall be able to keep no secrets . My letter was from "
73694	73702	73704	73704	Garth	111	" Oh , do n't tell me , "
73714	73754	73766	73767	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I had no idea of seeming curious as to your private correspondence , Miss Gray . Only it is such a pleasure to report progress to you in the things I manage to find out without being told . "
73755	73764	73766	73767	Nurse Rosemary	228	" But I meant to tell you anyway , "
73769	73795	73803	73803	Garth	111	" The letter is from Sir Deryck , and , amongst other things , he says he is coming up to see you next Saturday . "
73796	73801	73843	73843	he	111	" Ah , good ! "
73805	73841	73843	73843	he	111	" And what a change he will find ! And I shall have the pleasure of reporting on the nurse , secretary , reader , and unspeakably patient guide and companion he provided for me . "
73854	73867	73873	73874	Nurse Rosemary	228	" He is not coming to take you away , is he ? "
73868	73871	73873	73874	Nurse Rosemary	228	" No , "
73876	74001	74008	74008	Garth	111	" not yet . But , Mr. Dalmain , I was wanting to ask whether you could spare me just during forty - eight hours ; and Dr. Brand 's visit would be an excellent opportunity . I could leave you more easily , knowing you would have his companionship . If I may take the week - end , leaving on Friday night , I could return early on Monday morning , and be with you in time to do the morning letters . Dr. Brand would read you Saturday 's and Sunday 's Ah , I forgot ; there is no Sunday post . So I should miss but one ; and he would more than take my place in other ways . "
74002	74006	74008	74008	Garth	111	" Very well , "
74016	74044	74111	74112	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I should have liked that we three should have talked together . But no wonder you want a time off . Shall you be going far ? "
74045	74066	74072	74072	Garth	111	" No ; I have friends near by . And now , do you wish to attend to your letters ? "
74067	74070	74072	74072	Garth	111	" Yes , "
74079	74110	74140	74140	he	111	" Wait a minute . There is a newspaper among them . I smell the printing ink . I do n't want that . But kindly give me the rest . "
74134	74139	74261	74261	Garth	111	" What a lot ! "
74148	74260	74602	74602	he	111	" I say , Miss Gray , if you profit as you ought to do by the reading of so many epistles written in every possible and impossible style , you ought to be able to bring out a pretty comprehensive ' Complete Letter - writer . ' Do you remember the condolences of Mrs. Parker - Bangs ? I think that was the first time we really laughed together . Kind old soul ! But she should not have mentioned blind Bartimaeus dipping seven times in the pool of Siloam . It is always best to avoid classical allusions , especially if sacred , unless one has them accurately . Now "
74593	74601	74626	74626	she	228	" Did I shoot straight , nurse ? "
74621	74625	74626	74626	she	228	" Quite straight , "
74629	74670	74678	74678	Garth	111	" Mr. Dalmain , this letter has an Egyptian stamp , and the postmark is Cairo . It is sealed with scarlet sealing - wax , and the engraving on the seal is a plumed helmet with the visor closed . "
74671	74676	74678	74678	Garth	111	" And the writing ? "
74685	74709	74626	74626	she	228	" The handwriting is rather bold and very clear , with no twirls or flourishes . It is written with a broad nib . "
74710	74732	74780	74781	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Will you kindly open it , nurse , and tell me the signature before reading the rest of the letter . "
74766	74778	74791	74791	Garth	111	" It is signed ' Jane Champion , ' Mr. Dalmain , "
74783	74789	75131	75131	you	116	" Read it , please , "
75135	75138	75220	75220	God	145	" COME , "
75222	75225	75242	75242	Garth	111	" enable . "
75253	75345	75364	75364	her	228	" If you are not tired , Miss Gray , after reading so many letters , I should like to dictate my answer to that one immediately , while it is fresh in my mind . Have you paper there ? Thank you . May we begin ? Dear Miss Champion ... I am deeply touched by your kind letter of sympathy ... It was especially good of you to write to me from so far away amid so much which might well have diverted your attention from friends at home . "
75381	75394	75473	75473	Garth	111	" I am glad you did not give up the Nile trip but "
75416	75432	75473	75473	Garth	111	" but of course , if you had sent for me I should have come . "
75485	75501	75515	75515	she	228	" It is more than kind of you to suggest coming to see me , but "
75508	75514	75515	75515	she	228	" Oh , Mr. Dalmain , "
75518	75523	75542	75542	he	111	" let her come . "
75534	75541	75502	75503	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I do not wish it , "
75552	75582	75633	75634	Nurse Rosemary	228	" But think how hard it must be for any one to want so much to be near a a friend in trouble , and to be kept away . "
75583	75621	75633	75634	Nurse Rosemary	228	" It is only her wonderful kindness of heart makes her offer to come , Miss Gray . She is a friend and comrade of long ago . It would greatly sadden her to see me thus . "
75622	75631	75633	75634	Nurse Rosemary	228	" It does not seem so to her , "
75636	75675	75709	75709	he	111	" Ah , can not you read between the lines ? Or does it take a woman 's heart to understand a woman 's letter ? Did I read it badly ? May I read it over again ? "
75701	75708	75709	75709	he	111	" You read it quite well , "
75712	75741	75752	75753	Nurse Rosemary	228	" but you do not do well to discuss it . I must feel able to dictate my letters to my secretary , without having to explain them . "
75742	75750	75752	75753	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I beg your pardon , sir , "
75756	75761	75791	75791	he	111	" I was wrong . "
75786	75790	75791	75791	he	111	" Never mind , "
75799	75857	75867	75868	Nurse Rosemary	228	" my kind little mentor and guide . You can direct me in most things , but not in this . Now let us conclude . Where were we ? Ah ' to suggest coming to see me . ' Did you put ` It is most kind ' or ` It is more than kind ? ' "
75858	75865	75990	75990	Garth	111	" ' More than kind , ' "
75872	75988	75990	75990	Garth	111	" Right , for it is indeed more than kind . Only she and I can possibly know how much more . Now let us go on ... But I am receiving no visitors , and do not desire any until I have so mastered my new circumstances that the handicap connected with them shall neither be painful nor very noticeable to other people . During the summer I shall be learning step by step to live this new life , in complete seclusion at Gleneesh . I feel sure my friends will respect my wish in this matter . I have with me one who most perfectly and patiently is helping Ah , wait ! "
75993	76045	76123	76123	he	111	" I will not say that . She might think she might misunderstand . Had you begun to write it ? No ? What was the last word ? ' Matter ? ' Ah yes . That is right . Full stop after ' matter . ' Now let me think . "
76114	76122	76213	76214	Dr. Rob	217	" Yours very sincerely , Garth Dalmain ; "
76166	76210	76374	76375	Dr. Rob	217	" Which is the patient to - day ? The lady or the gentleman ? Ah , neither , I see . Both flaunt the bloom of perfect health and make the doctor shy . It is spring without , but summer within , "
76241	76319	76337	76337	Garth	111	" Flannels seem to call up boating and picnic parties ; and I see you have discarded the merino , Nurse Gray , and returned to the pretty blue washables . More becoming , undoubtedly ; only , do n't take cold ; and be sure you feed up well . In this air people must eat plenty , and you have been perceptibly losing weight lately . We do n't want TOO airy - fairy dimensions . "
76320	76335	76337	76337	Garth	111	" Why do you always chaff Miss Gray about being small , Dr. Rob ? "
76345	76359	76374	76375	Dr. Rob	217	" I am sure being short is in no way detrimental to her . "
76360	76372	76424	76424	Garth	111	" I will chaff her about being tall if you like , "
76406	76422	76424	76424	Garth	111	" I would sooner no comments of any kind were made upon her personal appearance , "
76433	76572	76615	76615	he	217	" You see , she is just a voice to me a kind , guiding voice . At first I used to form mental pictures of her , of a hazy kind ; but now I prefer to appropriate in all its helpfulness what I DO know , and leave unimagined what I do not . Did it ever strike you that she is the only person bar that fellow Johnson , who belongs to a nightmare time I am quickly forgetting I have yet had near me , in my blindness , whom I had not already seen ; the only voice I have ever heard to which I could not put a face and figure ? In time , of course , there will be many . At present she stands alone to me in this . "
76611	76614	76615	76615	he	217	" Hello ! "
76618	76638	76647	76647	Garth	111	" Pyramids ? The Egyptian stamp ? That 's interesting . Have you friends out there , Mr. Dalmain ? "
76639	76646	76647	76647	Garth	111	" That letter came from Cairo , "
76650	76664	76682	76682	he	217	" but I believe Miss Champion has by now gone on to Syria . "
76678	76681	76682	76682	he	217	" Champion ? "
76685	76706	76718	76718	Garth	111	" Champion ? It 's an uncommon name . Is your correspondent , by any chance , the Honourable Jane ? "
76707	76716	76718	76718	Garth	111	" Why , that letter is from her , "
76722	76728	76739	76740	Dr. Rob	217	" Do you know her ? "
76734	76737	76830	76830	He	1475	" Well , "
76746	76829	76922	76922	he	216	" I know her face , and I know her voice ; I know her figure , and I know a pretty good deal of her character . I know her at home , and I know her abroad . I 've seen her under fire , which is more than most men of her acquaintance can claim . But there is one thing I never knew until to - day and that is her handwriting . May I examine this envelope ? "
76918	76921	76922	76922	he	216	" Yes , "
76928	76994	77116	77116	Garth	111	" it is like her , clear , firm , unwavering ; knowing what it means to say , and saying it ; going where it means to go , and getting there . Ay , lad , it 's a grand woman that ; and if you have the Honourable Jane for your friend , you can be doing without a few other things . "
77110	77114	77134	77135	Dr. Rob	217	" Where when ? "
77118	77132	77134	77135	Dr. Rob	217	" I will tell you where , and I will tell you when , "
77137	77152	77168	77168	he	111	" if you feel inclined for a war tale on this peaceful spring morning . "
77159	77167	77168	77168	he	111	" Have you a chair , doctor ? "
77171	77179	77190	77191	Dr. Rob	217	" And has Miss Gray a chair ? "
77180	77188	77190	77191	Dr. Rob	217	" I have no chair , sir , "
77193	77863	77962	77963	Dr. Rob	217	" because when I intend thoroughly to enjoy my own eloquence it is my custom to stand . Nurse Gray has no chair , because she is standing at the window absorbed in the view . She has apparently ceased to pay any heed to you and me . You will very rarely find one woman take much interest in tales about another . But you lean back in your own chair , laddie , and light a cigarette . And a wonderful thing it is to see you do it , too , and better than pounding the wall . Eh ? All of which we may consider we owe to the lady who disdains us and prefers the scenery . Well , I 'm not much to look at , goodness knows ; and she can see you all the rest of the day . Now that 's a brand worth smoking . What do you call it ' Zenith ' ? Ah , and ' Marcovitch . ' Yes ; you ca n't better that for drawing - room and garden purposes . It mingles with the flowers . Lean back and enjoy it , while I smell gun - powder . For I will tell you where I first saw the Honourable Jane . Out in South Africa , in the very thick of the Boer war . I had volunteered for the sake of the surgery experience . She was out there , nursing ; but the real thing , mind you . None of your dabbling in eau - de - cologne with lace handkerchiefs , and washing handsome faces when the orderlies had washed them already ; making charming conversation to men who were getting well , but fleeing in dread from the dead or the dying . None of that , you may be sure , and none of that allowed in her hospital ; for Miss Champion was in command there , and I can tell you she made them scoot . She did the work of ten , and expected others to do it too . Doctors and orderlies adored her . She was always called ' The Honourable Jane , ' most of the men sounding the H and pronouncing the title as four syllables . Ay , and the wounded soldiers ! There was many a lad out there , far from home and friends , who , when death came , died with a smile on his lips , and a sense of mother and home quite near , because the Honourable Jane 's arm was around him , and his dying head rested against her womanly breast . Her voice when she talked to them ? No , that I shall never forget . And to hear her snap at the women , and order along the men ; and then turn and speak to a sick Tommy as his mother or his sweetheart would have wished to hear him spoken to , was a lesson in quick - change from which I am profiting still . And that big , loving heart must often have been racked ; but she was always brave and bright . Just once she broke down . It was over a boy whom she tried hard to save quite a youngster . She had held him during the operation which was his only chance ; and when it proved no good , and he lay back against her unconscious , she quite broke down and said : ' Oh , doctor , a mere boy and to suffer so , and then die like this ! ' and gathered him to her , and wept over him , as his own mother might have done . The surgeon told me of it himself . He said the hardest hearts in the tent were touched and softened . But , it was the only time the Honourable Jane broke down . "
77948	77960	77962	77963	Dr. Rob	217	" I came across her several times , at different centres , "
77965	78482	78498	78498	he	111	" but we were not in the same departments , and she spoke to me only once . I had ridden in , from a temporary overflow sort of place where we were dealing with the worst cases straight off the field , to the main hospital in the town for a fresh supply of chloroform . While they fetched it , I walked round the ward , and there in a corner was Miss Champion , kneeling beside a man whose last hour was very near , talking to him quietly , and taking measures at the same time to ease his pain . Suddenly there came a crash a deafening rush and another crash , and the Honourable Jane and her patient were covered with dust and splinters . A Boer shell had gone clean through the roof just over their heads . The man sat up , yelling with fear . Poor chap , you could n't blame him ; dying , and half under morphine . The Honourable Jane never turned a hair . ' Lie down , my man , ' she said , ' and keep still . ' ' Not here , ' sobbed the man . ' All right , ' said the Honourable Jane ; ' we will soon move you . ' Then she turned and saw me . I was in the most nondescript khaki , a non - com 's jacket which I had caught up on leaving the tent , and various odds and ends of my outfit which had survived the wear and tear of the campaign . Also I was dusty with a long gallop . ' Here , serjeant , ' she said , ' lend a hand with this poor fellow . I ca n't have him disturbed just now . ' That was Jane 's only comment on the passing of a shell within a few yards of her own head . Do you wonder the men adored her ? She placed her hands beneath his shoulders , and signed to me to take him under the knees , and together we carried him round a screen , out of the ward , and down a short passage ; turning unexpectedly into a quiet little room , with a comfortable bed , and photographs and books arranged on the tiny dressing - table . She said : ' Here , if you please , serjeant , ' and we laid him on the bed . ' Whose is it ? ' I asked . She looked surprised at being questioned , but seeing I was a stranger , answered civilly : ' Mine . ' And then , noting that he had dozed off while we carried him , added : ' And he will have done with beds , poor chap , before I need it . ' There 's nerve for you ! Well , that was my only conversation out there with the Honourable Jane . Soon after I had had enough and came home . "
78488	78497	78507	78508	Dr. Rob	217	" Did you ever meet her at home ? "
78501	78505	78507	78508	Dr. Rob	217	" I did , "
78510	78579	78581	78582	Dr. Rob	217	" But she did not remember me . Not a flicker of recognition . Well , how could I expect it ? I wore a beard out there ; no time to shave ; and my jacket proclaimed me a serjeant , not a surgeon . No fault of hers if she did not expect to meet a comrade from the front in the wilds of of Piccadilly , "
78585	78710	78507	78508	Dr. Rob	217	" Now , having spun so long a yarn , I must be off to your gardener 's cot in the wood , to see his good wife , who has had what he pathetically calls ' an increase . ' I should think a decrease would have better suited the size of his house . But first I must interview Mistress Margery in the dining - room . She is anxious about herself just now because she ' canna eat bacon . ' She says it flies between her shoulders . So erratic a deviation from its normal route on the part of the bacon , undoubtedly requires investigation . So , by your leave , I will ring for the good lady . "
78711	78718	78507	78508	Dr. Rob	217	" Not just yet , doctor , "
78727	78780	78827	78827	he	216	" I want to see you in the dining - room , and will follow you there immediately . And afterwards , while you investigate Margery , I will run up for my bonnet , and walk with you through the woods , if Mr. Dalmain will not mind an hour alone . "
78823	78826	78827	78827	he	216	" Well ? "
78830	78838	78856	78856	she	101	" Am I to pay the piper ? "
78850	78855	78856	78856	she	101	" Ah , serjeant ! "
78859	78905	78918	78919	Dr. Rob	217	" You dear faithful old serjeant ! See what comes of wearing another man 's coat . And my dilemma comes from taking another woman 's name . So you knew me all the time , from the first moment I came into the room ? "
78906	78916	78931	78931	Jane	101	" From the first moment you entered the room , "
78921	78929	78856	78856	she	101	" Why did you not say so ? "
78933	78963	78972	78972	Jane	101	" Well , I concluded you had your reasons for being ' Nurse Rosemary Gray , ' and it did not come within my province to question your identity . "
78964	78970	78972	78972	Jane	101	" Oh , you dear ! "
78974	79053	79063	79064	Dr. Rob	217	" Was there ever anything so shrewd , and so wise , and so bewilderingly far - seeing , standing on two legs on a hearth - rug before ! And when I remember how you said : ' So you have arrived , Nurse Gray ? ' and all the while you might have been saying . ' How do you do , Miss Champion ? And what brings you up here under somebody else 's name ? "
79054	79061	79063	79064	Dr. Rob	217	" I might have so said , "
79067	79076	79083	79083	Jane	101	" but praise be , I did not . "
79077	79081	78972	78972	Jane	101	" But tell me "
79084	79091	79095	79095	his	217	" why let it out now ? "
79101	79346	79376	79377	Dr. Rob	217	" My dear , I am an old fellow , and all my life I have made it my business to know , without being told . You have been coming through a strain , a prolonged period of strain , sometimes harder , sometimes easier , but never quite relaxed , a strain such as few women could have borne . It was not only with him ; you had to keep it up towards us all . I knew , if it were to continue , you must soon have the relief of some one with whom to share the secret , some one towards whom you could be yourself occasionally . And when I found you had been writing to him here , sending the letter to be posted in Cairo how like a woman , to strain at a gnat , after swallowing such a camel ! , awaiting its return day after day , then obliged to read it to him yourself , and take down his dictated answer , which I gathered from your faces when I entered was his refusal of your request to come and see him , well , it seemed to me about time you were made to realise that you might as well confide in an old fellow who , in common with all the men who knew you in South Africa , would gladly give his right hand for the Honourable Jane . "
79366	79374	79376	79377	Dr. Rob	217	" But tell me , my dear , "
79379	79424	79432	79432	Jane	101	" tell me , if you can : why does the lad put from him so firmly that which , if indeed it might be his for the asking , would mean for him so great , so wonderful , so comforting a good ? "
79425	79430	79432	79432	Jane	101	" Ah , doctor , "
79434	79536	79630	79630	She	101	" thereby hangs a tale of sad mistrust and mistake , and the mistrust and mistake , alas , were mine . Now , while you see Margery , I will prepare for walking ; and as we go through the wood I will try to tell you the woeful thing which came between him and me and placed our lives so far apart . Your wise advice will help me , and your shrewd knowledge of men and of the human heart may find us a way out , for indeed we are shut in between Migdol and the sea . "
79620	79629	79800	79800	Garth	111	" A mere boy and to suffer so ! "
79808	79818	79876	79876	Deryck	250	" OH , MY WIFE MY WIFE MY WIFE ! "
79865	79875	79925	79925	He	111	" IF YOU VALUE YOUR ULTIMATE HAPPINESS AND HIS , "
79928	79930	80041	80041	he	111	" COME "
80032	80040	80041	80041	he	111	" Was it lovely in the woods ? "
80044	80076	80125	80125	she	101	" Simpson shall take me up there after lunch . Meanwhile , is there time , if you are not tired , Miss Gray , to finish our morning 's work ? "
80115	80124	80125	80125	she	101	" And about the letter to Miss Champion ? "
80128	80142	80148	80148	he	111	" Do you wish it to go as it is , Mr. Dalmain ? "
80143	80147	80148	80148	he	111	" Why certainly , "
80151	80158	80165	80165	Jane	101	" Did we not finish it ? "
80159	80163	80165	80165	Jane	101	" I thought , "
80175	80186	80211	80211	Garth	111	" I thought perhaps after Dr. Rob 's story you might "
80187	80209	80211	80211	Garth	111	" Dr. Rob 's story could make no possible difference as to whether I should let her come here or not , "
80219	80224	80231	80231	Jane	101	" It only reminded me "
80225	80229	80250	80251	Garth Dalmain	111	" Of what ? "
80239	80248	80306	80306	she	101	" Of what a glorious woman she is , "
80309	80314	80509	80509	He	223	" So much the better "
80513	80546	80687	80687	he	940	" It answers best , in the long run , to let them take their own time . The minute or two gained by hurrying them is lost in the final results . "
80679	80686	80698	80700	the Scotch porter	1515	" Now then , my man ! "
80690	80696	80663	80665	porter and portmanteau	1512	" I beg your pardon ? "
80702	80708	80718	80719	the porter	1127	" I want my portmanteau . "
80709	80716	80728	80729	the doctor	940	" Would this be your portmanteau ? "
80722	80726	80728	80729	the doctor	940	" It would , "
80731	80765	80776	80777	the porter	1127	" And it and I would be on our way to Castle Gleneesh , if you would be bringing it out and putting it into the motor , which I see waiting outside . "
80766	80774	80827	80827	he	1127	" I will be fetching a truck , "
80816	80826	81171	81171	Simpson	230	" I will be hoping it WAS his portmanteau , "
81158	81169	81294	81295	The doctor	940	" Mr. Dalmain is in the library , Sir Deryck , "
81309	81318	81326	81326	Garth	111	" My dear fellow ! What a change ! "
81319	81324	81363	81363	He	111	" Is n't it ? "
81329	81362	81394	81394	He	111	" And it is entirely she who has worked it , the capital little woman you sent up to me . I want to tell you how first - rate she is . "
81386	81393	81421	81421	he	111	" this is her own idea . "
81430	81457	81470	81471	the doctor	940	" There is one on this side leading to the piano , and one here to the window . Now how should you know them apart ? "
81458	81468	81478	81478	Garth	111	" They are brown , purple , and orange , "
81473	81476	81478	81478	Garth	111	" Yes , "
81480	81611	81627	81628	the doctor	940	" You know them by the colours , but I distinguish them by a slight difference in the thickness and in the texture , which you could not see , but which I can feel . And I enjoy thinking of the colours , too . And sometimes I wear ties and things to match them . You see , I know exactly how they look ; and it was so like her to remember that . An ordinary nurse would have put red , green , and blue , and I should have sat and hated the thought of them knowing how vilely they must be clashing with my Persian carpet . But she understands how much colours mean to me , even though I can not see them . "
81612	81625	81627	81628	the doctor	940	" I conclude that by ' she ' you mean Nurse Rosemary , "
81630	81639	81646	81646	Garth	111	" I am glad she is a success . "
81640	81644	81646	81646	Garth	111	" A success ! "
81648	81702	81627	81628	the doctor	940	" Why , she helped me to live again ! I am ashamed to remember how at the bottom of all things I was when you came up before , Brand , just pounding the wall , as old Robbie expresses it . You must have thought me a fool and a coward . "
81703	81737	81646	81646	Garth	111	" I thought you neither , my dear fellow . You were coming through a stiffer fight than any of us have been called to face . Thank God , you have won . "
81738	81773	81783	81784	the doctor	940	" I owe a lot to you , Brand , and still more to Miss Gray . I wish she were here to see you . She is away for the week - end . "
81774	81781	81646	81646	Garth	111	" Away ! J just now ? "
81792	81893	81646	81646	Garth	111	" Yes ; she went last night . She is week - ending in the neighbourhood . She said she was not going far , and should be back with me early on Monday morning . But she seemed to want a change of scene , and thought this a good opportunity , as I shall have you here most of the time . I say , Brand , I do think it is extraordinarily good of you to come all this way to see me . You know , from such a man as yourself it is almost overwhelming . "
81894	81962	81970	81970	Garth	111	" You must not be overwhelmed , my dear chap ; and , though I very truly came to see you , I am also up , about another old friend in the near neighbourhood in whom I am interested . I only mention this in order to be quite honest , and to lift from off you any possible burden of feeling yourself my only patient . "
81963	81968	81970	81970	Garth	111	" Oh , thanks ! "
81972	82010	82011	82011	Garth	111	" It lessens my compunction without diminishing my gratitude . And now you must be wanting a brush up and breakfast , and here am I selfishly keeping you from both . And I say , Brand , "
82020	82065	82087	82087	he	940	" I am awfully sorry you will have no companion at your meals , Miss Gray being away . I do not like to think of you having them alone , but I I always have mine by myself . Simpson attends to them . "
82090	82100	82087	82087	he	940	" Ah , yes . Yes , of course , "
82110	82170	82181	82182	the doctor	940	" I could n't even have Miss Gray with me . We always take our meals apart . You can not imagine how awful it is chasing your food all round your plate , and never sure it is not on the cloth , after all , or on your tie , while you are hunting for it elsewhere . "
82171	82179	82181	82182	the doctor	940	" No , I ca n't imagine , "
82184	82220	82221	82221	Garth	111	" No one could who had not been through it . But can you bear it better with Simpson than with Nurse Rosemary ? She is trained to that sort of thing , you know . "
82225	82376	82382	82382	Simpson	230	" Well , you see , Simpson is the chap who shaves me , and gets me into my clothes , and takes me about ; and , though it will always be a trial , it is a trial to which I am growing accustomed . You might put it thus : Simpson is eyes to my body ; Miss Gray is vision to my mind . Simpson 's is the only touch which cores to me in the darkness . Do you know , Miss Gray has never touched me , not even to shake hands . I am awfully glad of this . I will tell you why presently , if I may . It makes her just a MIND and VOICE to me , and nothing more ; but a wonderfully kind and helpful voice . I feel as if I could not live without her . "
82385	82466	82560	82561	old Margery	255	" Take Sir Deryck to his room ; and he will tell you what time he would like breakfast . And when you have seen to it all , Simpson , I will go out for a turn . Then I shall be free , Brand , when you are . But do not give me any more time this morning if you ought to be resting , or out on the moors having a holiday from minds and men . "
82554	82558	82560	82561	old Margery	255	" A jug , "
82563	82585	82591	82591	Margery	255	" And would you be coming with me , Sir Deryck , and softly , whenever you have finished your breakfast ? "
82586	82589	82617	82617	she	255	" Softly , "
82623	82640	82641	82641	She	255	" It is not what ye make it IN ; it is HOW ye make it . "
82653	82662	82679	82680	old Margery	255	" It all hangs upon the word FRESH , "
82668	82677	82721	82722	the doctor	940	" Freshly roasted freshly ground water freshly - boiled "
82710	82719	82749	82749	Margery	255	" Where are we going , Mistress Margery ? "
82734	82747	82749	82749	Margery	255	" You will be seeing whenever we get there , Sir Deryck , "
82751	82840	82879	82879	her	255	" And never touch it with metal , Sir Deryck . Pop it into an earthenware jug , pour your boiling water straight upon it , stir it with a wooden spoon , set it on the hob ten minutes to settle ; the grounds will all go to the bottom , though you might not think it ; and you pour it out fragrant , strong , and clear . But the secret is , fresh , fresh , fresh , and do n't stint your coffee . "
82884	82897	82928	82928	he	940	" And you will not forget the wooden spoon , Sir Deryck ? "
82915	82927	82934	82935	old Margery	255	" I will not forget the wooden spoon , Mistress Margery , "
82949	82959	83031	83031	she	101	" It will be Sir Deryck , Miss Gray , "
83025	83030	83040	83040	her	101	" Oh , Dicky ! "
83043	83083	83122	83122	he	940	" is it you ? Oh , come in , Boy , and shut the door . Are we alone ? Come round here quick and shake hands , or I shall be plunging about trying to find you . "
83118	83121	83122	83122	he	940	" Jeanette ? "
83125	83128	83197	83198	the doctor	940	" Jeanette ! "
83192	83195	83197	83198	the doctor	940	" Jeanette ! "
83205	83214	83220	83220	Jane	101	" And you call this week - ending ? "
83215	83218	83220	83220	Jane	101	" Dear , "
83222	83646	83656	83657	The doctor	940	" I have gone into Sightless Land for my week - end . Oh , Deryck , I had to do it . The only way really to help him is to know exactly what it means , in all the small , trying details . I never had much imagination , and I have exhausted what little I had . And he never complains , or explains how things come hardest . So the only way to find out is to have forty - eight hours of it one 's self . Old Margery and Simpson quite enter into it , and are helping me splendidly . Simpson keeps the coast clear if we want to come down or go out ; because with two blind people about , it would be a complication if they ran into one another . Margery helps me with all the things in which I am helpless ; and , oh Dicky , you would never believe how many they are ! And the awful , awful dark a black curtain always in front of you , sometimes seeming hard and firm , like a wall of coal , within an inch of your face ; sometimes sinking away into soft depths of blackness miles and miles of distant , silent , horrible darkness ; until you feel you must fall forward into it and be submerged and overwhelmed . And out of that darkness come voices . And if they speak loudly , they hit you like tapping hammers ; and if they murmur indistinctly , they madden you because you ca n't SEE what is causing it . You ca n't see that they are holding pins in their mouths , and that therefore they are mumbling ; or that they are half under the bed , trying to get out something which has rolled there , and therefore the voice seems to come from somewhere beneath the earth . And , because you can not see these things to account for it , the variableness of sound torments you . Ah ! and the waking in the morning to the same blackness as you have had all night ! I have experienced it just once , I began my darkness before dinner last night , and I assure you , Deryck , I dread to - morrow morning . Think what it must be to wake to that always , with no prospect of ever again seeing the sunlight ! And then the meals "
83647	83655	83670	83670	Jane	101	" What ! You keep it on ? "
83664	83668	83670	83670	Jane	101	" Of course , "
83672	83797	83803	83804	the doctor	940	" And you can not imagine the humiliation of following your food all round the plate , and then finding it on the table - cloth ; of being quite sure there was a last bit somewhere , and when you had given up the search and gone on to another course , discovering it , eventually , in your lap . I do not wonder my poor boy would not let me come to his meals . But after this I believe he will , and I shall know exactly how to help him and how to arrange so that very soon he will have no difficulty . Oh , Dicky , I had to do it ! There was no other way . "
83798	83801	83803	83804	the doctor	940	" Yes , "
83807	83814	83830	83830	he	940	" you had to do it . "
83836	83849	83830	83830	he	940	" You being YOU , dear , there was no other way . "
83850	83918	83940	83940	he	940	" Ah , how glad I am you realise the necessity , Deryck ! I had so feared you might think it useless or foolish . And it was now or never ; because I trust if he forgives me this will be the only week - end I shall ever have to spend away from him . Boy , do you think he will forgive me ? "
83934	83939	83940	83940	he	940	" Hush , dear , "
83943	83980	83990	83990	Jane	101	" You make me sigh for the duchess 's parrot . And I shall do no good here , if I lose patience with Dalmain . Now tell me ; you really never remove that bandage ? "
83981	83988	83990	83990	Jane	101	" Only to wash my face , "
83994	84044	84094	84095	the doctor	940	" I can trust myself not to peep for two minutes . And last night I found it made my head so hot that I could not sleep ; so I slipped it off for an hour or two , but woke and put it on again before dawn . "
84045	84058	84083	84083	she	101	" And you mean to wear it until to - morrow morning ? "
84073	84082	84094	84095	the doctor	940	" Until to - morrow night , Boy , "
84087	84092	84111	84111	My	0	" But , Jeanette , "
84125	84125	84133	84133	Jane	101	"
84126	84131	84133	84133	Jane	101	" Ah , no , "
84144	84273	84332	84332	he	940	" Do n't you see , dear , you give me the chance of passing through what will in time be one of his hardest experiences , when his dearest friends will come and go , and be to him only voice and touch ; their faces unseen and but dimly remembered ? Deryck , just because this hearing and not seeing you IS so hard , I realise how it is enriching me in what I can share with him . He must not have to say : ' Ah , but you saw him before he left . ' I want to be able to say : ' He came and went , my greatest friend , and I did not see him at all . ' "
84322	84331	84332	84332	he	940	" You always were a THOROUGH old thing ! "
84335	84349	84363	84363	she	101	" No half - measures would do . I suppose I must agree . "
84357	84362	84363	84363	she	101	" Ah , Boy , "
84366	84383	84397	84398	the doctor	940	" now you will help me . But I never before knew you so nearly selfish . "
84384	84395	84397	84398	the doctor	940	" The ' other man ' is always a problem , "
84400	84674	84902	84902	he	940	" We male brutes , by nature , always want to be first with all our women ; not merely with the one , but with all those in whom we consider , sometimes with egregious presumption , that we hold a right . You see it everywhere , fathers towards their daughters , brothers as regards their sisters , friends in a friendship . The ' other man , ' when he arrives , is always a pill to swallow . It is only natural , I suppose ; but it is fallen nature and therefore to be surmounted . Now let me go and forage for your hat and coat , and take you out upon the moors . No ? Why not ? I often find things for Flower , so really I know likely places in which to search . Oh , all right ! I will send Margery . But do n't be long . And you need not be afraid of Dalmain hearing us , for I saw him just now walking briskly up and down the terrace , with only an occasional touch of his cane against the parapet . How much you have already accomplished ! We shall talk more freely out on the moor ; and , as I march you along , we can find out tips which may be useful when the time comes for you to lead the ' other man ' about . Only do be careful how you come downstairs with old Margery . Think if you fell upon her , Jane ! She does make such excellent coffee ! "
84904	84909	85069	85070	Dr. Brand	223	" happy and glorious , "
85065	85068	85069	85070	Dr. Brand	223	" Yes , "
85075	85244	85252	85252	Garth	111	" I can easily see that all things which reach you in that darkness assume a different proportion and possess a greatly enhanced value . But I think you will find , as time goes on , and you come in contact with more people , there will be a great readjustment , and you will become less consciously sensitive to sound and touch from others . At present your whole nervous system is highly strung , and responds with an exaggerated vibration to every impression made upon it . A highly strung nervous system usually exaggerates . And the medium of sight having been taken away , the other means of communication with the outer world , hearing and touch , draw to themselves an overplus of nervous force , and have become painfully sensitive . Eventually things will right themselves , and they will only be usefully keen and acute . What was it you were going to tell me about Nurse Rosemary not shaking hands ? "
85245	85250	85252	85252	Garth	111	" Ah , yes , "
85254	85296	85307	85308	the doctor	940	" But first I want to ask , Is it a rule of her order , or guild , or institution , or whatever it is to which she belongs , that the nurses should never shake hands with their patients ? "
85297	85305	85252	85252	Garth	111	" Not that I have ever heard , "
85310	85385	85394	85395	the doctor	940	" Well , then , it must have been Miss Gray 's own perfect intuition as to what I want , and what I do n't want . For from the very first she has never shaken hands , nor in any way touched me . Even in passing across letters , and handing me things , as she does scores of times daily , never once have I felt her fingers against mine . "
85386	85392	85423	85423	Garth	111	" And this pleases you ? "
85411	85421	85423	85423	Garth	111	" Ah , I am so grateful for it , "
85426	85457	85465	85466	the doctor	940	" Do you know , Brand , when you suggested sending me a lady nurse and secretary , I felt I could not possibly stand having a woman touch me . "
85458	85463	85465	85466	the doctor	940	" So you said , "
85469	85484	85492	85493	the doctor	940	" No ! Did I ? What a bear you must have thought me . "
85485	85490	85492	85493	the doctor	940	" By no means , "
85495	85507	85516	85516	Garth	111	" but a distinctly unusual patient . As a rule , men "
85508	85515	85516	85516	Garth	111	" Ah , I dare say , "
85521	85652	85659	85660	the doctor	940	" There was a time when I should have liked a soft little hand about me . And I dare say by now I should often enough have caught it and held it , perhaps kissed it who knows ? I used to do such things , lightly enough . But , Brand , when a man has known the touch of THE Woman , and when that touch has become nothing but a memory ; when one is dashed into darkness , and that memory becomes one of the few things which remain , and , remaining , brings untold comfort , can you wonder if one fears another touch which might in any way dim that memory , supersede it , or take away from its utter sacredness ? "
85653	85657	85659	85660	the doctor	940	" I understand , "
85663	85726	85735	85735	Garth	111	" It does not come within my own experience , but I understand . Only my dear boy , may I say it ? if the One Woman exists and it is excusable in your case to doubt it , because there were so many surely her place should be here ; her actual touch , one of the things which remain . "
85727	85733	85735	85735	Garth	111	" Ah , say it , "
85741	85796	85804	85805	the doctor	940	" I like to hear it said , although as a matter of fact you might as well say that if the view from the terrace exists , I ought to be able to see it . The view is there , right enough , but my own deficiency keeps me from seeing it . "
85797	85802	85804	85805	the doctor	940	" In other words , "
85830	85849	85855	85855	Garth	111	" in other words , though She was the One Woman , you were not the One Man ? "
85850	85853	85855	85855	Garth	111	" Yes , "
85864	85873	85884	85885	the doctor	940	" I was ' a mere boy . ' "
85874	85882	85884	85885	the doctor	940	" Or you thought you were not , "
85896	85936	85958	85958	he	111	" As a matter of fact , you are always the One Man to the One Woman , unless another is before you in the field . Only it may take time and patience to prove it to her . "
85951	85957	85958	85958	he	111	" What an extraordinary statement ! "
85961	85968	85974	85975	the doctor	940	" Do you really mean it ? "
85969	85972	85974	85975	the doctor	940	" Absolutely , "
85983	86165	86174	86174	Garth	111	" If you eliminate all other considerations , such as money , lands , titles , wishes of friends , attraction of exteriors that is to say , admiration of mere physical beauty in one another , which is after all just a question of comparative anatomy ; if , freed of all this social and habitual environment , you could place the man and the woman in a mental Garden of Eden , and let them face one another , stripped of all shams and conventionalities , soul viewing soul , naked and unashamed ; if under those circumstances she is so truly his mate , that all the noblest of the man cries out : ' This is the One Woman ! ' then I say , so truly is he her mate , that he can not fail to be the One Man ; only he must have the confidence required to prove it to her . On him it bursts , as a revelation ; on her it dawns slowly , as the breaking of the day . "
86166	86172	86174	86174	Garth	111	" Oh , my God , "
86177	86249	86255	86256	the doctor	940	" it was just that ! The Garden of Eden , soul to soul , with no reservations , nothing to fear , nothing to hide . I realised her my WIFE , and called her so . And the next morning she called ME ' a mere boy , ' whom she could not for a moment think of marrying . So what becomes of your fool theory , Brand ? "
86250	86253	86255	86256	the doctor	940	" Confirmed , "
86259	86326	86406	86406	he	111	" Eve , afraid of the immensity of her bliss , doubtful of herself , fearful of coming short of the marvel of his ideal of her , fleeing from Adam , to hide among the trees of the garden . Do n't talk about fool theories , my boy . The fool - fact was Adam , if he did not start in prompt pursuit . "
86400	86405	86406	86406	he	111	" Oh , Brand , "
86409	86426	86511	86517	This strained white face in the firelight	1611	" I am blind . Be merciful . Things mean so terribly much in the dark . "
86528	86533	86555	86555	he	940	" I am blind , "
86548	86552	86616	86617	the doctor	940	" the other man "
86595	86614	86630	86630	Garth	111	" You may be blind , Dalmain , but I do not want you to be a fool , "
86620	86628	86640	86641	the doctor	940	" Am I was I a fool ? "
86632	86638	86640	86641	the doctor	940	" How can I judge ? "
86643	86669	86969	86969	He	111	" Give me a clear account of the circumstances from your point of view , and I will give you my opinion of the case . "
86947	86968	86985	86985	he	111	" Keep far our foes ; give peace at home ; Where Thou art Guide , no ill can come . "
86981	86984	86985	86985	he	111	" Brand , "
86988	87028	87057	87057	he	111	" if , as you are so kind as to suggest , I give myself the extreme relief of confiding in you , will you promise me never to attempt to guess at the identity of the One Woman ? "
87051	87056	87057	87057	he	111	" My dear fellow , "
87060	87140	87148	87148	Garth	111	" I never guess at other people 's secrets . It is a form of mental recreation which does not appeal to me , and which I should find neither entertaining nor remunerative . If I know them already , I do not require to guess them . If I do not know them , and their possessors wish me to remain in ignorance , I would as soon think of stealing their purse as of filching their secret . "
87141	87146	87148	87148	Garth	111	" Ah , thanks , "
87150	87175	87181	87182	the doctor	940	" Personally , I do not mind what you know . But I owe it to her , that her name should not appear . "
87176	87179	87181	87182	the doctor	940	" Undoubtedly , "
87184	87223	87240	87240	Garth	111	" Except in so far as she herself , chooses to reveal it , the One Woman 's identity should always remain a secret . Get on with your tale , old chap . I will not interrupt . "
87224	87238	87240	87240	Garth	111	" I will state it as simply and as shortly as I can , "
87242	87523	87524	87525	The doctor	940	" And you will understand that there are details of which no fellow could speak . I had known her several years in a friendly way , just staying at the same houses , and meeting at Lord 's and Henley and all the places where those in the same set do meet . I always liked her , and always felt at my best with her , and thought no end of her opinion , and so forth . She was a friend and a real chum to me , and to lots of other fellows . But one never thought of love - making in connection with her . All the silly things one says to ordinary women she would have laughed at . If one had sent her flowers to wear , she would have put them in a vase and wondered for whom they had really been intended . She danced well , and rode straight ; but the man she danced with had to be awfully good at it , or he found himself being guided through the giddy maze ; and the man who wanted to be in the same field with her , must be prepared for any fence or any wall . Not that I ever saw her in the hunting - field ; her love of life and of fair play would have kept her out of that . But I use it as a descriptive illustration . One was always glad to meet her in a house party , though one could not have explained why . It is quite impossible to describe her . She was just well , just "
87527	87530	87562	87562	he	940	" just Jane "
87568	87582	87597	87600	the eager young voice	1630	" Just a good sort . Yes , I quite understand . Well ? "
87583	87594	87597	87600	the eager young voice	1630	" I had had my infatuations , plenty of them , "
87602	87887	87894	87895	Deryck Brand	107	" The one thing I thought of in women was their exteriors . Beauty of all kinds of any kind crazed me for the moment . I never wanted to marry them , but I always wanted to paint them . Their mothers , and aunts , and other old dowagers in the house parties used to think I meant marriage , but the girls themselves knew better . I do n't believe a girl now walks this earth who would accuse me of flirting . I admired their beauty , and they knew it , and they knew that was all my admiration meant . It was a pleasant experience at the time , and , in several instances , helped forward good marriages later on . Pauline Lister was apportioned to me for two whole seasons , but she eventually married the man on whose jolly old staircase I painted her . Why did n't I come a cropper over any of them ? Because there were too many , I suppose . Also , the attraction was skin - deep . I do n't mind telling you quite frankly : the only one whose beauty used to cause me a real pang was Lady Brand . But when I had painted it and shown it to the world in its perfection , I was content . I asked no more of any woman than to paint her , and find her paintable . I could not explain this to the husbands and mothers and chaperons , but the women themselves understood it well enough ; and as I sit here in my darkness not a memory rises up to reproach me . "
87888	87892	87894	87895	Deryck Brand	107	" Good boy , "
87899	87910	87917	87917	Garth	111	" You were vastly misunderstood , but I believe you . "
87911	87915	87917	87917	Garth	111	" You see , "
87919	88228	88261	88261	he	940	" that sort of thing being merely skin - deep , I went no deeper . The only women I really knew were my mother , who died when I was nineteen , and Margery Graem , whom I always hugged at meeting and parting , and always shall hug until I kiss the old face in its coffin , or she straightens me in mine . Those ties of one 's infancy and boyhood are among the closest and most sacred life can show . Well , so things were until a certain evening in June several years ago . She the One Woman and I were in the same house party at a lovely old place in the country . One afternoon we had been talking intimately , but quite casually and frankly . I had no more thought of wanting to marry her than of proposing to old Margery . Then something happened , I must not tell you what ; it would give too clear a clue to her identity . But it revealed to me , in a few marvellous moments , the woman in her ; the wife , the mother ; the strength , the tenderness ; the exquisite perfection of her true , pure soul . In five minutes there awakened in me a hunger for her which nothing could still , which nothing ever will still , until I stand beside her in the Golden City , where they shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; and there shall be no more darkness , or depending upon sun , moon , or candle , for the glory of God shall lighten it ; and there shall be no more sorrow , neither shall there be any more pain , for former things shall have passed away . "
88264	88267	88365	88366	The doctor	940	" Well ? "
88268	88271	88261	88261	he	940	" Well , "
88298	88351	88365	88366	The doctor	940	" I never had a moment 's doubt as to what had happened to me . I knew I loved her ; I knew I wanted her ; I knew her presence made my day and her absence meant chill night ; and every day was radiant , for she was there . "
88379	88390	88398	88398	Garth	111	" Was she a pretty woman ; handsome , beautiful ? "
88391	88396	88398	88398	Garth	111	" A pretty woman ? "
88402	88430	88365	88366	The doctor	940	" Good heavens , no ! Handsome ? Beautiful ? Well you have me there , for , ' pon my honour , I do n't know . "
88431	88443	88452	88452	Garth	111	" I mean , would you have wished to paint her ? "
88444	88450	88452	88452	Garth	111	" I HAVE painted her , "
88463	88530	88539	88540	the doctor	940	" and my two paintings of her , though done in sadness and done from memory , are the most beautiful work I ever produced . No eye but my own has ever seen them , and now none ever will see them , excepting those of one whom I must perforce trust to find them for me , and bring them to me for destruction . "
88531	88537	88549	88549	Garth	111	" And that will be ? "
88542	88547	88572	88572	he	111	" Nurse Rosemary Gray , "
88565	88571	88572	88572	he	111	" You have chosen well , "
88595	88616	88629	88629	he	111	" Nurse Rosemary will be discreet . Very good . Then we may take it the One Woman was beautiful ? "
88622	88628	88629	88629	he	111	" I do not know , "
88633	88704	88711	88712	the doctor	940	" I can not see her through the eyes of others . My vision of her , in that illuminating moment , followed the inspired order of things , spirit , soul , and body . Her spirit was so pure and perfect , her soul so beautiful , noble , and womanly , that the body which clothed soul and spirit partook of their perfection and became unutterably dear . "
88705	88709	88711	88712	the doctor	940	" I see , "
88717	88727	88755	88755	Garth	111	" Yes , you dear fellow , I see . "
88746	88753	88755	88755	Garth	111	" Several glorious days went by , "
88757	89054	89063	89064	the doctor	940	" I realise now that I was living in the glow of my own certainty that she was the One Woman . It was so clear and sweet and wonderful to me , that I never dreamed of it not being equally clear to her . We did a lot of music together for pure enjoyment ; we talked of other people for the fun of it ; we enjoyed and appreciated each other 's views and opinions ; but we did not talk of ourselves , because we KNEW , at least I knew , and , before God , I thought she did . Every time I saw her she seemed more grand and perfect . I held the golden key to trifling matters not understood before . We young fellows , who all admired her , used nevertheless to joke a bit about her wearing collars and stocks , top boots and short skirts ; whacking her leg with a riding - whip , and stirring the fire with her toe . But after that evening , I understood all this to be a sort of fence behind which she hid her exquisite womanliness , because it was of a deeper quality than any man looking upon the mere surface of her had ever fathomed or understood . And when she came trailing down in the evening , in something rich and clinging and black , with lots of soft old lace covering her bosom and moving with the beating of her great tender heart ; ah , then my soul rejoiced and my eyes took their fill of delight ! I saw her , as all day long I had known her to be , perfect in her proud , sweet womanliness . "
89055	89061	89063	89064	the doctor	940	" Is he really unconscious , "
89066	89080	89087	89087	Garth	111	" of how unmistakable a word - picture of Jane he is painting ? "
89081	89085	89087	89087	Garth	111	" Very soon , "
89089	89177	89215	89215	Garth	111	" we had three days apart , and then met again at another house , in a weekend party . One of the season 's beauties was there , with whom my name was being freely coupled , and something she said on that subject , combined with the fearful blankness of those three interminable days , made me resolve to speak without delay . I asked her to come out on to the terrace that evening . We were alone . It was a moonlight night . "
89219	89224	89236	89236	Jane	101	" I told her . "
89238	89243	89274	89275	the doctor	940	" Then it happened , "
89292	89550	89551	89552	The doctor	940	" I thought she understood completely . Afterwards I knew she had not understood at all . Her actions led me to believe I was accepted , taken into her great love , even as she was wrapped around by mine . Not through fault of hers , ah , no ; she was blameless throughout ; but because she did not , could not , understand what any touch of hers must mean to me . In her dear life , there had never been another man ; that much I knew by unerring instinct and by her own admission . I have sometimes thought that she may have had an ideal in her girlish days , against whom , in after years , she measured others , and , finding them come short , held them at arm 's length . But , if I am right in this surmise , he must have been a blind fool , unconscious of the priceless love which might have been his , had he tried to win it . For I am certain that , until that night , no man 's love had ever flamed about her ; she had never felt herself enveloped in a cry which was all one passionate , in - articulate , inexplicable , boundless need of herself . While I thought she understood and responded , Heaven knows I DID think it , she did not in the least understand , and was only trying to be sympathetic and kind . "
89581	89584	89600	89600	he	940	" other man "
89592	89599	89611	89611	Garth	111	" Are you sure of that ? "
89605	89609	89611	89611	Garth	111	" Quite sure , "
89613	89842	90010	90010	Jane	101	" Listen . I called her what she was to me just then , what I wanted her to be always , what she is forever , so far as my part goes , and will be till death and beyond . That one word , no , there were two , those two words made her understand . I see that now . She rose at once and put me from her . She said I must give her twelve hours for quiet thought , and she would come to me in the village church next morning with her answer . Brand , you may think me a fool ; you can not think me a more egregious ass than I now think myself ; but I was absolutely certain she was mine ; so sure that , when she came , and we were alone together in the house of God , instead of going to her with the anxious haste of suppliant and lover , I called her to me at the chancel step as if I were indeed her husband and had the right to bid her come . She came , and , just as a sweet formality before taking her to me , I asked for her answer . It was this : ' I can not marry a mere boy . ' "
90003	90009	90137	90137	he	940	" How old are you ? "
90132	90136	90137	90137	he	940	" Poor chap , "
90140	90147	90118	90118	He	940	" Ah , poor old chap . "
90165	90194	90289	90289	he	940	" So you expressed no opinion ? explained nothing ? let him go on believing that ? Oh , Dicky ! And you might have said so much ! "
90304	90413	90424	90424	Jane	101	" I expressed no opinion . I explained nothing . I let him continue to believe what he believes ; because it is the only way to keep you on the pinnacle where he has placed you . Let any other reason for your conduct than an almost infantine ignorance of men and things be suggested and accepted , and down you will come , my poor Jane , and great will be the fall . Mine shall not be the hand thus to hurl you headlong . As you say , I might have said so much , but I might also have lived to regret it . "
90414	90422	90424	90424	Jane	101	" I should fall into his arms , "
90427	90439	90450	90451	the doctor	940	" and I would sooner be there than on a pinnacle . "
90440	90448	90521	90522	the doctor	940	" Excuse me , my good girl , "
90453	90519	90521	90522	the doctor	940	" It is more likely you would fall into the first express going south . In fact , I am not certain you would wait for an express . I can almost see the Honourable Jane quitting yonder little railway station , seated in an empty coal - truck . No ! Do n't start up and attempt to stride about among the pine needles , "
90531	90556	90564	90564	Jane	101	" You will only trip over a fir cone and go headlong into the valley . It is no use forestalling the inevitable fall . "
90557	90562	90575	90575	her	101	" Oh , Dicky , "
90586	90666	90675	90675	Deryck	107	" I do n't know what has come to you to - day . You are not kind to me . You have harrowed my poor soul by repeating all Garth said last night ; and , thanks to that terribly good memory of yours , you have reproduced the tones of his voice in every inflection . And then , instead of comforting me , you leave me entirely in the wrong , and completely in the lurch . "
90667	90673	90675	90675	Deryck	107	" In the wrong yes , "
90677	90825	90837	90837	Jane	101	" in the lurch no . I did not say I would do nothing to - day . I only said I could do nothing last night . You can not take up a wounded thing and turn it about and analyse it . When we bade each other good - night , I told him I would think the matter over and give him my opinion to - day . I will tell you what has happened to me if you like . I have looked into the inmost recesses of a very rare and beautiful nature , and I have seen what havoc a woman can work in the life of the man who loves her . I can assure you , last night was no pastime . I woke this morning feeling as if I had , metaphorically , been beaten black and blue . "
90826	90835	90852	90852	Deryck	107	" Then what do you suppose I feel ? "
90840	90850	90852	90852	Deryck	107	" You still feel yourself in the right partly , "
90854	90892	90903	90903	Jane	101	" And so long as you think you have a particle of justification and cling to it , your case is hopeless . It will have to be : ' I confess . Can you forgive ? ' "
90893	90901	90903	90903	Jane	101	" But I acted for the best , "
90905	90936	90852	90852	Deryck	107	" I thought of him before I thought of myself . It would have been far easier to have accepted the happiness of the moment , and chanced the future . "
90937	91021	91028	91028	Jane	101	" That is not honest , Jeanette . You thought of yourself first . You dared not face the possibility of the pain to you if his love cooled or his admiration waned . When one comes to think of it , I believe every form of human love a mother 's only excepted is primarily selfish . The best chance for Dalmain is that his helpless blindness may awaken the mother love in you . Then self will go to the wall . "
91022	91026	91028	91028	Jane	101	" Ah me ! "
91030	91068	91081	91082	the doctor	940	" I am lost and weary and perplexed in this bewildering darkness . Nothing seems clear ; nothing seems right . If I could see your kind eyes , Boy , your hard voice would hurt less . "
91069	91079	91091	91091	Jane	101	" Well , take off the bandage and look , "
91084	91089	91091	91091	Jane	101	" I will not ! "
91094	91107	91028	91028	Jane	101	" Have I gone through all this to fail at the last ? "
91108	91137	91143	91143	Jane	101	" My dear girl , this self - imposed darkness is getting on your nerves . Take care it does not do more harm than good . Strong remedies "
91138	91141	91143	91143	Jane	101	" Hush ! "
91145	91150	91168	91169	the doctor	940	" I hear footsteps . "
91151	91166	91192	91192	Jane	101	" You can always hear footsteps in a wood if you hearken for them , "
91183	91190	91192	91192	Jane	101	" I hear Garth 's step , "
91194	91217	91244	91244	he	940	" Oh , Dicky , go to the edge and look over . You can see the windings of the path below . "
91240	91243	91244	91244	he	940	" Yes , "
91247	91269	91286	91286	Jane	101	" Fortune favours us . Dalmain is coming up the path with Simpson . He will be here in two minutes . "
91270	91285	91309	91309	he	940	" Fortune favours us ? My dear Dicky ! Of all mis - chances ! "
91303	91308	91309	91309	he	940	" Not at all , "
91312	91440	91467	91467	Deryck	107	" And do not fail at the last in your experiment . I ought to be able to keep you two blind people apart . Trust me , and keep dark I mean , sit still . And can you not understand why I said fortune favours us ? Dalmain is coming for my opinion on the case . You shall hear it together . It will be a saving of time for me , and most enlightening for you to mark how he takes it . Now keep quiet . I promise he shall not sit on your lap . But if you make a sound , I shall have to say you are a bunny or a squirrel , and throw fir cones at you . "
91459	91464	91467	91467	Deryck	107	" Hullo , Dalmain , "
91470	91491	91497	91497	Garth	111	" Found your way up here ? An ideal spot . Shall we dispense with Simpson ? Take my arm . "
91492	91495	91497	91497	Garth	111	" Yes , "
91499	91514	91535	91535	Garth	111	" I was told you were up here , Brand , and followed you . "
91528	91533	91535	91535	Garth	111	" Are you alone ? "
91539	91546	91553	91554	the doctor	940	" I thought I heard voices . "
91547	91551	91553	91554	the doctor	940	" You did , "
91556	91565	91575	91575	Garth	111	" I was talking to a young woman . "
91566	91573	91585	91586	the doctor	940	" What sort of young woman ? "
91577	91583	91585	91586	the doctor	940	" A buxom young person , "
91588	91595	91553	91554	the doctor	940	" with a decidedly touchy temper . "
91596	91603	91609	91610	the doctor	940	" Do you know her name ? "
91604	91607	91621	91621	Garth	111	" Jane , "
91613	91619	91621	91621	Garth	111	" Not ' Jane , ' "
91624	91647	91658	91659	the doctor	940	" Jean . I know her , my gardener 's eldest daughter . Rather weighed down by family cares , poor girl . "
91648	91656	91658	91659	the doctor	940	" I saw she was weighed down , "
91661	91688	91694	91694	Garth	111	" I did not know it was by family cares . Let us sit on this trunk . Can you call up the view to mind ? "
91689	91692	91694	91694	Garth	111	" Yes , "
91696	91720	91728	91729	the doctor	940	" I know it so well . But it terrifies me to find how my mental pictures are fading ; all but one . "
91721	91726	91741	91741	Garth	111	" And that is ? "
91731	91739	91755	91756	the doctor	940	" The face of the One Woman , "
91746	91753	91755	91756	the doctor	940	" Ah , my dear fellow , "
91758	91816	91866	91866	Deryck	107	" I have not forgotten my promise to give you this morning my opinion on your story . I have been thinking it over carefully , and have arrived at several conclusions . Shall we sit on this fallen tree ? Wo n't you smoke ? One can talk better under the influence of the fragrant weed . "
91860	91864	91866	91866	Deryck	107	" What nerve ! "
91871	91900	91919	91919	he	111	" Ninety - nine women out of a hundred would have said ' Ah ! ' and given away the show . Really , she deserves to win . "
91906	91918	91933	91933	he	111	" I think we shall do better on the other log , "
91923	91931	91982	91982	he	940	" It is always in fuller sunshine . "
91974	91981	92011	92012	the doctor	940	" How accurately you judge distance , "
92003	92009	92031	92031	Garth	111	" Now for our talk , "
92021	92029	92015	92015	he	940	" Are you sure we are alone ? "
92033	92041	92049	92050	the doctor	940	" I seem conscious of another presence . "
92042	92047	92049	92050	the doctor	940	" My dear fellow , "
92052	92104	92110	92110	Garth	111	" is one ever alone in a wood ? Countless little presences surround us . Bright eyes peep down from the branches ; furry tails flick in and out of holes ; things unseen move in the dead leaves at our feet . If you seek solitude , shun the woods . "
92105	92108	92110	92110	Garth	111	" Yes , "
92112	92188	92196	92197	the doctor	940	" I know , and I love listening to them . I meant a human presence . Brand , I am often so tried by the sense of an unseen human presence near me . Do you know , I could have sworn the other day that she the One Woman came silently , looked upon me in my blindness , pitied me , as her great tender heart would do , and silently departed . "
92189	92194	92049	92050	the doctor	940	" When was that ? "
92199	92248	92255	92256	the doctor	940	" A few days ago . Dr. Rob had been telling us how he came across her in Ah ! I must not say where . Then he and Miss Gray left me alone , and in the lonely darkness and silence I felt her eyes upon me . "
92249	92253	92255	92256	the doctor	940	" Dear boy , "
92258	92349	92356	92356	Garth	111	" you must not encourage this dread of unseen presences . Remember , those who care for us very truly and deeply can often make us conscious of their mental nearness , even when far away , especially if they know we are in trouble and needing them . You must not be surprised if you are often conscious of the nearness of the One Woman , for I believe and I do not say it lightly , Dalmain I believe her whole heart and love and life are yours . "
92350	92354	92394	92395	the doctor	940	" Good Lord ! "
92386	92392	92394	92395	the doctor	940	" Sit down , man , "
92397	92649	92822	92823	the doctor	940	" and listen to me . You gain nothing by dashing about in the dark in that way . I am going to prove my words . But you must give me your calm attention . Now listen . We are confronted in this case by a psychological problem , and one which very likely has not occurred to you . I want you for a moment to picture the One Man and the One Woman facing each other in the Garden of Eden , or in the moonlight wherever it was if you like better . Now will you realise this ? The effect upon a man of falling in love is to create in him a complete unconsciousness of self . On the other hand , the effect upon a woman of being loved and sought , and of responding to that love and seeking , is an accession of intense self - consciousness . He , longing to win and take , thinks of her only . She , called upon to yield and give , has her mind turned at once upon herself . Can she meet his need ? Is she all he thinks her ? Will she be able to content him completely , not only now but in the long vista of years to come ? The more natural and unconscious of self she had been before , the harder she would be hit by this sudden , overwhelming attack of self - consciousness . "
92708	92755	92761	92761	Garth	111	" You see , my dear chap , I gathered from yourself she was not of the type of feminine loveliness you were known to admire . Might she not have feared that her appearance would , after a while , have failed to content you ? "
92756	92759	92761	92761	Garth	111	" No , "
92768	92814	92822	92823	the doctor	940	" Such a suggestion is unworthy . Besides , had the idea by any possibility entered her mind , she would only have had to question me on the point . My decision would have been final ; my answer would have fully reassured her . "
92815	92820	92835	92835	Garth	111	" Love is blind , "
92826	92833	92835	92835	Garth	111	" They lie who say so , "
92838	92860	92872	92873	the doctor	940	" Love is so far - seeing that it sees beneath the surface and delights in beauties unseen by other eyes . "
92861	92870	92887	92887	Garth	111	" Then you do not accept my theory ? "
92875	92885	92887	92887	Garth	111	" Not as an explanation of my own trouble , "
92889	93072	93100	93100	he	940	" because I know the greatness of her nature would have lifted her far above such a consideration . But I do indeed agree as to the complete oblivion to self of the man in love . How else could we ever venture to suggest to a woman that she should marry us ? Ah , Brand , when one thinks of it , the intrusion into her privacy ; the asking the right to touch , even her hand , at will ; it could not be done unless the love of her and the thought of her had swept away all thoughts of self . Looking back upon that time I remember how completely it was so with me . And when she said to me in the church : ' How old are you ? ' ah , I did not tell you that last night the revulsion of feeling brought about by being turned at that moment in upon myself was so great , that my joy seemed to shrivel and die in horror at my own unworthiness . "
93103	93135	93143	93143	Garth	111	" Dalmain , there are two possible solutions to your problem . Do you think it was a case of Eve holding back in virginal shyness , expecting Adam to pursue ? "
93136	93141	93143	93143	Garth	111	" Ah , no , "
93146	93215	93227	93228	the doctor	940	" We had gone far beyond all that . Nor could you suggest it , did you know her . She is too honest , too absolutely straight and true , to have deceived me . Besides , had it been so , in all these lonely years , when she found I made no sign , she would have sent me word of what she really meant . "
93216	93225	93235	93235	Garth	111	" Should you have gone to her then ? "
93230	93233	93235	93235	Garth	111	" Yes , "
93238	93272	93278	93279	the doctor	940	" I should have gone and I should have forgiven because she is my own . But it could never have been the same . It would have been unworthy of us both . "
93273	93276	93278	93279	the doctor	940	" Well , "
93281	93409	93459	93459	Garth	111	" the other solution remains . You have admitted that the One Woman came somewhat short of the conventional standard of beauty . Your love of loveliness was so well known . Do you not think , during the long hours of that night , remember how new it was to her to be so worshipped and wanted , do you not think her courage failed her ? She feared she might come short of what eventually you would need in the face and figure always opposite you at your table ; and , despite her own great love and yours , she thought it wisest to avoid future disillusion by rejecting present joy . Her very love for you would have armed her to this decision . "
93454	93457	93459	93459	Garth	111	" No , "
93465	93493	93531	93531	he	940	" In that case she would have told me her fear , and I should have reassured her immediately . Your suggestion is unworthy of my beloved . "
93525	93530	93531	93531	he	940	" My dear boy , "
93543	93634	93640	93640	Garth	111	" I must maintain my unalterable belief that to the One Woman you are still the One Man . In your blindness her rightful place is by your side . Perhaps even now she is yearning to be here . Will you tell me her name , and give me leave to seek her out , hear from herself her version of the story ; and , if it be as I think , bring her to you , to prove , in your affliction , her love and tenderness ? "
93635	93638	93640	93640	Garth	111	" Never ! "
93642	93820	93830	93831	the doctor	940	" Never , while life shall last ! Can you not see that if when I had sight , and fame , and all heart could desire , I could not win her love , what she might feel for me now , in my helpless blindness , could be but pity ? And pity from her I could never accept . If I was ' a mere boy ' three years ago , I am ' a mere blind man ' now , an object for kind commiseration . If indeed you are right , and she mistrusted my love and my fidelity , it is now out of my power forever to prove her wrong and to prove myself faithful . But I will not allow the vision of my beloved to be dimmed by these suggestions . For her completion , she needed so much more than I could give . She refused me because I was not fully worthy . I prefer it should be so . Let us leave it at that . "
93821	93828	93841	93841	Garth	111	" It leaves you to loneliness , "
93834	93839	93841	93841	Garth	111	" I prefer loneliness , "
93846	93872	93895	93895	he	940	" to disillusion . Hark ! I hear the first gong , Brand . Margery will be grieved if we keep her Sunday dishes waiting . "
93885	93894	93895	93895	he	940	" Ah , how well I know it , "
93898	94022	94029	94030	the doctor	940	" When Miss Gray and I sit up here , she tells me all she sees , and I tell her what she does not see , but what I know is there . She is keen on art , and on most of the things I care about . I must ask for an arm , Brand , though the path is wide and good . I can not risk a tumble . I have come one or two awful croppers , and I promised Miss Gray The path is wide . Yes , we can walk two abreast , three abreast if necessary . It is well we had this good path made . It used to be a steep scramble . "
94023	94027	94040	94040	He	940	" Three abreast , "
94032	94039	94051	94051	her	101	" So we could if necessary . "
94059	94085	94138	94138	he	111	" Now , my dear fellow , my right arm will suit you best ; then you can keep your stick in your right hand . "
94129	94137	94138	94138	he	111	" I seem to hear another footstep , "
94141	94147	94158	94159	the doctor	940	" besides yours and mine . "
94148	94156	94158	94159	the doctor	940	" The wood is full of footsteps , "
94161	94186	94197	94197	Garth	111	" just as the heart is full of echoes . If you stand still and listen you can hear what you will in either . "
94187	94195	94197	94197	Garth	111	" Then let us not stand still , "
94199	94218	94158	94159	the doctor	940	" for in old days , if I was late for lunch , Margery used to spank me . "
94226	94255	94314	94314	He	111	" It will be absolutely impossible , Miss Gray , for me ever to tell you what I think of this that you have done for my sake . "
94348	94413	94422	94422	she	228	" And here was I , picturing you having a gay weekend , and wondering where , and who your friends in this neighbourhood could be . And all the while you were sitting blindfold in the room over my head . Ah , the goodness of it is beyond words ! But did you not feel somewhat of a deceiver , Miss Gray ? "
94426	94486	94497	94497	Garth	111	" Yes . And yet I told you I was not going far . And my friends in the neighbourhood were Simpson and Margery , who aided and abetted . And it was true to say I was going , for was I not going into darkness ? and it is a different world from the land of light . "
94487	94495	94497	94497	Garth	111	" Ah , how true that is ! "
94499	94559	94565	94566	Nurse Rosemary	228	" And how difficult to make people understand the loneliness of it , and how they seem suddenly to arrive close to one from another world ; stooping from some distant planet , with sympathetic voice and friendly touch ; and then away they go to another sphere , leaving one to the immensity of solitude in Sightless Land . "
94560	94563	94565	94566	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Yes , "
94568	94590	94601	94601	Garth	111	" and you almost dread the coming , because the going makes the darkness darker , and the loneliness more lonely . "
94591	94599	94601	94601	Garth	111	" Ah , so YOU experienced that ? "
94603	94650	94901	94901	her	101	" Do you know , now you have week - ended in Sightless Land , I shall not feel it such a place of solitude . At every turn I shall be able to say : ' A dear and faithful friend has been here . ' "
94858	94891	94918	94918	she	101	" Mr. Dalmain , there are many smaller details ; but before we talk of those I want to tell you the greatest of all the lessons I learned in Sightless Land . "
94947	95119	95197	95197	he	111	" Mr. Dalmain , it seems to me I learned to understand how that which is loneliness unspeakable to ONE might be Paradise of a very perfect kind for TWO . I realised that there might be circumstances in which the dark would become a very wonderful meeting - place for souls . If I loved a man who lost his sight , I should be glad to have mine in order to be eyes for him when eyes were needed ; just as , were I rich and he poor , I should value my money simply as a thing which might be useful to him . But I know the daylight would often be a trial to me , because it would be something he could not share ; and when evening came , I should long to say : ' Let us put out the lights and shut away the moonlight and sit together in the sweet soft darkness , which is more uniting than the light . ' "
95192	95196	95197	95197	he	111	" Nurse Rosemary , "
95216	95320	95498	95498	she	101	" it is kind of you to tell me all these beautiful thoughts which came to you in the darkness . But I hope the man who is happy enough to possess your love , or who is going to be fortunate enough to win it , will neither be so unhappy nor so unfortunate as to lose his sight . It will be better for him to live with you in the light , than to be called upon to prove the kind way in which you would be willing to adapt yourself to his darkness . How about opening our letters ? "
95483	95497	95498	95498	she	101	" I believe it was the thought of him made me realise this , "
95501	95523	95554	95554	he	111	" but just now I and my young man have fallen out . He does not even know I am here . "
95547	95553	95554	95554	he	111	" Ah , Miss Gray , "
95558	95586	95606	95606	she	228	" you will not think it impertinent or intrusive on my part , but do you know I have wondered sometimes whether there was a happy man . "
95591	95605	95650	95650	he	111	" Well , we ca n't call him a happy man just now , "
95660	95660	95668	95668	Garth	111	"
95661	95666	95668	95668	Garth	111	" What a fool ! "
95670	95677	95689	95689	she	228	" Are you and he engaged ? "
95682	95688	95689	95689	she	228	" Well not exactly engaged , "
95692	95712	95736	95737	the housemaid	1393	" though it practically amounts to that . Neither of us would give a thought to any one else . "
95728	95732	95689	95689	she	228	" keeping company , "
95739	95743	95846	95846	her	228	" walking out , "
95856	95860	95892	95892	her	1720	" an understanding . "
95886	95890	96051	96051	Garth	111	" a young man "
96021	96049	96067	96068	Dr. Rob	217	" I fear they do not let them go on indefinitely at one case ; but perhaps Sir Deryck can arrange that this should be an exception , "
96053	96065	96067	96068	Dr. Rob	217	" Oh , hang the matron , and blow Sir Deryck , "
96071	96099	96264	96264	SHE	1726	" If you want her as a permanency , make sure of her . Marry her , my boy ! I 'll warrant she 'd have you ! "
96269	96274	96309	96309	he	111	" a mere boy . "
96312	96365	96368	96368	Garth	111	" And the voice would be always Jane 's . You have never seen the nurse 's face ; you never will see it . You can go on putting to the voice the face and form you adore . You can marry the little nurse , and go on loving Jane . "
96374	96379	96508	96508	he	111	" Avaunt , Satan ! "
96503	96507	96508	96508	he	111	" Miss Gray , "
96528	96654	96684	96685	Nurse Rosemary	228	" it is good of you to have told me about yourself ; and , although I confess to feeling unreasonably jealous of the fortunate fellow who possesses your whole heart , I am glad he exists , because we all miss something unless we have in our lives the wonderful experience of the One Woman or the One Man . And I want to tell you something , dear sweet friend of mine , which closely touches you and me ; only , before I do so , put your hand in mine , that I may realise you in a closer intimacy than heretofore . You , who have been in Sightless Land , know how much a hand clasp means down here . "
96672	96682	96684	96685	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I can not do that , Mr. Dalmain , "
96695	96736	96834	96834	he	111	" I have burned my hands . Oh , not seriously . Do not look so distressed . Just a lighted match . Yes ; while I was blind . Now tell me the thing which touches you and me . "
96829	96833	96834	96834	he	111	" Tell me , "
96837	96845	96881	96881	she	101	" is he very much to you ? "
96871	96880	96866	96867	Nurse Rosemary	228	" He is all the world to me , "
96884	96896	96914	96915	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Does he love you as you deserve to be loved ? "
96918	96931	96866	96867	Nurse Rosemary	228	" He loved me far , FAR more than I ever deserved . "
96932	96950	96958	96959	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Why do you say ' loved ' ? Is not ' loves ' the truer tense ? "
96951	96956	96958	96959	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Alas , no ! "
96963	96985	96991	96991	Garth	111	" for I fear I have lost his love by my own mistrust of it and my own wrong - doing . "
96986	96989	96991	96991	Garth	111	" Never ! "
96993	97105	97120	97121	Nurse Rosemary	228	" ' Love never faileth . ' It may for a time appear to be dead , even buried . But the Easter morn soon dawns , and lo , Love ariseth ! Love grieved , is like a bird with wet wings . It can not fly ; it can not rise . It hops about upon the ground , chirping anxiously . But every flutter shakes away more drops ; every moment in the sunshine is drying the tiny feathers ; and very soon it soars to the tree top , all the better for the bath , which seemed to have robbed it of the power to rise . "
97106	97118	97120	97121	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Ah , if my beloved could but dry his wings , "
97123	97145	97159	97159	Garth	111	" But I fear I did more than wet them . I clipped them . Worse still , I broke them . "
97146	97158	97171	97172	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Does he know you feel yourself so in the wrong ? "
97166	97169	97171	97172	Nurse Rosemary	228	" No , "
97174	97206	97213	97213	Garth	111	" He will give me no chance to explain , and no opportunity to tell him how he wrongs himself and me by the view he now takes of my conduct . "
97207	97211	97213	97213	Garth	111	" Poor girl ! "
97221	97306	97334	97335	Nurse Rosemary	228	" My own experience has been such a tragedy that I can feel for those whose course of true love does not run smooth . But take my advice , Miss Gray . Write him a full confession . Keep nothing back . Tell him just how it all happened . Any man who truly loves would believe , accept your explanation , and be thankful . Only , I hope he would not come tearing up here and take you away from me ! "
97315	97332	97346	97346	Garth	111	" If he wanted me , Mr. Dalmain , I should have to go to him , "
97337	97344	97346	97346	Garth	111	" How I dread the day , "
97348	97721	97726	97727	Nurse Rosemary	228	" when you will come and say to me : ' I have to go . ' And , do you know , I have sometimes thought you have done so much for me and become so much to me I have sometimes thought I can tell you frankly now it might have seemed as if there were a very obvious way to try to keep you always . You are so immensely worthy of all a man could offer , of all the devotion a man could give . And because , to one so worthy , I never could have offered less than the best , I want to tell you that in my heart I hold shrined forever one beloved face . All others are gradually fading . Now , in my blindness , I can hardly recall clearly the many lovely faces I have painted and admired . All are more or less blurred and indistinct . But this one face grows clearer , thank God , as the darkness deepens . It will be with me through life , I shall see it in death , THE FACE OF THE WOMAN I LOVE . You said ' loved ' of your lover , hesitating to be sure of his present state of heart . I can neither say ' love ' nor ' loved ' of my beloved . She never loved me . But I love her with a love which makes it impossible for me to have any ' best ' to offer to another woman . If I could bring myself , from unworthy motives and selfish desires , to ask another to we d me , I should do her an untold wrong . For her unseen face would be nothing to me ; always that one and only face would be shining in my darkness . Her voice would be dear , only in so far as it reminded me of the voice of the woman I love . Dear friend , if you ever pray for me , pray that I may never be so base as to offer to any woman such a husk as marriage with me would mean . "
97722	97724	97726	97727	Nurse Rosemary	228	" But "
97729	97760	97766	97766	Garth	111	" She she who has made it a husk for others ; she who might have the finest of the wheat , the full corn in the ear , herself ? "
97761	97764	97766	97766	Garth	111	" She , "
97768	97807	97845	97845	he	111	" has refused it . It was neither fine enough nor full enough . It was not worthy . O my God , little girl ! What it means , to appear inadequate to the woman one loves ! "
97841	97844	97845	97845	he	111	" Now , "
97848	98112	98231	98232	Nurse Rosemary	228	" now I feel it , just as I told Brand , and never so clearly before , excepting once , when I was alone . Ah , Miss Gray ! Do n't move ! Do n't stir ! But look all round the room and tell me whether you see anything . Look at the window . Look at the door . Lean forward and look behind the screen . I can not believe we are alone . I will not believe it . I am being deceived in my blindness . And yet I am NOT deceived . I am conscious of the presence of the woman I love . Her eyes are fixed upon me in pity , sorrow , and compassion . Her grief at my woe is so great that it almost enfolds me , as I had dreamed her love would do ... O my God ! She is so near and it is so terrible , because I do not wish her near . I would sooner a thousand miles were between us and I am certain there are not many yards ! ... Is it psychic ? or is it actual ? or am I going mad ? ... Miss Gray ! YOU would not lie to me . No persuasion or bribery or confounded chicanery could induce YOU to deceive me on this point . Look around , for God 's sake , and tell me ! Are we alone ? And if not , WHO IS IN THE ROOM besides you and me ? "
98217	98229	98231	98232	Nurse Rosemary	228	" There is no one in the room , Mr. Dalmain , "
98234	98240	98257	98257	They	1737	" but YOU and ME . "
98247	98256	98424	98425	Nurse Rosemary	228	" So you enjoy motoring , Miss Gray ? "
98323	98339	98424	98425	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Yes , I like it , Mr. Dalmain ; particularly in this beautiful air . "
98340	98356	98357	98358	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Have you had a case before in a house where they kept a motor ? "
98361	98395	98404	98404	Garth	111	" Yes , I have stayed in houses where they had motors , and I have been in Dr. Brand 's . He met me at Charing Cross once with his electric brougham . "
98396	98402	98404	98404	Garth	111	" Ah , I know , "
98406	98423	98439	98439	she	228	" Very neat . On your way to a case , or returning from a case ? "
98433	98438	98439	98439	she	228	" To a case , "
98444	98461	98477	98477	Garth	111	" I was on my way to his house to talk it over and receive instructions . "
98462	98475	98477	98477	Garth	111	" It must be splendid working under such a fellow as Brand , "
98479	98747	98805	98806	Nurse Rosemary	228	" and yet I am certain most of the best things you do are quite your own idea . For instance , he did not suggest your week - end plan , did he ? I thought not . Ah , the difference it has made ! Now tell me . When we were motoring we never slowed up suddenly to pass anything , or tooted to make something move out of the way , without your having already told me what we were going to pass or what was in the road a little way ahead . It was : ' We shall be passing a hay cart at the next bend ; there will be just room , but we shall have to slow up ' ; or , ' An old red cow is in the very middle of the road a little way on . I think she will move if we hoot . ' Then , when the sudden slow down and swerve came , or the toot toot of the horn , I knew all about it and was not taken unawares . Did you know how trying it is in blindness to be speeding along and suddenly alter pace without having any idea why , or swerve to one side , and not know what one has just been avoiding ? This afternoon our spin was pure pleasure , because not once did you let these things happen . I knew all that was taking place , as soon as I should have known it had I had my sight . "
98797	98803	98805	98806	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Well , Mr. Dalmain , "
98808	98893	98902	98902	Garth	111	" I motored to the station with Sir Deryck yesterday afternoon , and I noticed all you describe . I have never before felt nervous in a motor , but I realised yesterday how largely that is owing to the fact that all the time one keeps an unconscious look - out ; measuring distances , judging speed , and knowing what each turn of the handle means . So when we go out you must let me be eyes to you in this . "
98894	98900	98902	98902	Garth	111	" How good you are ! "
98906	98915	98805	98806	Nurse Rosemary	228	" And did you see Sir Deryck off ? "
98916	98970	98902	98902	Garth	111	" No . I did not SEE Sir Deryck at all . But he said good - bye , and I felt the kind , strong grip of his hand as he left me in the car . And I sat there and heard his train start and rush away into the distance . "
98971	98991	99004	99005	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Was it not hard to you to let him come and go and not to see his face ? "
98995	99002	99004	99005	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Yes , it was hard , "
99007	99016	99032	99032	Garth	111	" but I wished to experience that hardness . "
99017	99030	99004	99005	Nurse Rosemary	228	" It gives one an awful blank feeling , does n't it ? "
99034	99048	99004	99005	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Yes . It almost makes one wish the friend had not come . "
99049	99051	99101	99101	Garth	111	" Ah "
99086	99099	99101	99101	Garth	111	" Next time I reach the Gulf of Partings in Sightless Land , "
99103	99120	99131	99132	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I shall say : ' A dear friend has stood here for my sake . ' "
99121	99129	99131	99132	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Oh , and one 's meals , "
99135	99142	99101	99101	Garth	111	" Are they not grotesquely trying ? "
99143	99181	99187	99188	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Yes , of course ; I had forgotten you would understand all that now . I never could explain to you before why I must have my meals alone . You know the hunt and chase ? "
99182	99185	99187	99188	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Yes , "
99190	99300	99308	99308	Garth	111	" and it usually resolves itself into ' gone away , ' and turns up afterwards unexpectedly ! But , Mr. Dalmain , I have thought out several ways of helping so much in that and making it all quite easy . If you will consent to have your meals with me at a small table , you will see how smoothly all will work . And later on , if I am still here , when you begin to have visitors , you must let me sit at your left , and all my little ways of helping would be so unobtrusive , that no one would notice . "
99301	99306	99308	99308	Garth	111	" Oh , thanks , "
99310	99632	99187	99188	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I am immensely grateful . I have often been reminded of a silly game we used to play at Overdene , at dessert , when we were a specially gay party . Do you know the old Duchess of Meldrum ? Or anyway , you may have heard of her ? Ah , yes , of course , Sir Deryck knows her . She called him in once to her macaw . She did not mention the macaw on the telephone , and Sir Deryck , thinking he was wanted for the duchess , threw up an important engagement and went immediately . Luckily she was at her town house . She would have sent just the same had she been at Overdene . I wish you knew Overdene . The duchess gives perfectly delightful ' best parties , ' in which all the people who really enjoy meeting one another find themselves together , and are well fed and well housed and well mounted , and do exactly as they like ; while the dear old duchess tramps in and out , with her queer beasts and birds , shedding a kindly and exciting influence wherever she goes . Last time I was there she used to let out six Egyptian jerboas in the drawing - room every evening after dinner , awfully jolly little beggars , like miniature kangaroos . They used to go skipping about on their hind legs , frightening some of the women into fits by hiding under their gowns , and making young footmen drop trays of coffee cups . The last importation is a toucan , a South American bird , with a beak like a banana , and a voice like an old sheep in despair . But Tommy , the scarlet macaw , remains prime favourite , and I must say he is clever and knows more than you would think . "
99633	99734	99740	99741	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Well , at Overdene we used to play a silly game at dessert with muscatels . We each put five raisins at intervals round our plates , then we shut our eyes and made jabs at them with forks . Whoever succeeded first in spiking and eating all five was the winner . The duchess never would play . She enjoyed being umpire , and screaming at the people who peeped . Miss Champion and I she is the duchess 's niece , you know always played fair , and we nearly always made a dead heat of it . "
99735	99738	99740	99741	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Yes , "
99743	99762	99768	99768	Garth	111	" I know that game . I thought of it at once when I had my blindfold meals . "
99763	99766	99768	99768	Garth	111	" Ah , "
99770	99784	99792	99793	Nurse Rosemary	228	" had I known , I would not have let you do it ! "
99785	99790	99792	99793	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I knew that , "
99795	99804	99822	99822	he	111	" That was why I week - ended . "
99818	99821	99822	99822	he	111	" Now , "
99825	100132	100169	100169	she	228	" I can venture to tell you one of my minor trials . I am always so awfully afraid of there being a FLY in things . Ever since I was a small boy I have had such a horror of inadvertently eating flies . When I was about six , I heard a lady visitor say to my mother : ' Oh , one HAS to swallow a fly about once a year ! I have just swallowed mine , on the way here ! ' This terrible idea of an annual fly took possession of my small mind . I used to be thankful when it happened , and I got it over . I remember quickly finishing a bit of bread in which I had seen signs of legs and wings , feeling it was an easy way of taking it and I should thus be exempt for twelve glad months ; but I had to run up and down the terrace with clenched hands while I swallowed it . And when I discovered the fallacy of the annual fly , I was just as particular in my dread of an accidental one . I do n't believe I ever sat down to sardines on toast at a restaurant without looking under the toast for my bugbear , though as I lifted it I felt rather like the old woman who always looks under the bed for a burglar . Ah , but since the accident this foolishly small thing HAS made me suffer ! I can not say : ' Simpson , are you sure there is not a fly in this soup ? ' Simpson would say : ' No sir ; no fly sir , ' and would cough behind his hand , and I could never ask him again . "
100160	100168	100169	100169	she	228	" Have all your meals with me , "
100187	100210	100212	100212	Garth	111	" and I can promise there shall never be any flies in anything . Could you not trust my eyes for this ? "
100222	100275	100296	100296	she	228	" I could trust your kind and faithful eyes for anything . Ah ! and that reminds me : I want to intrust to them a task I could confide to no one else . Is it twilight yet , Miss Gray , or is an hour of daylight left to us ? "
100289	100295	100296	100296	she	228	" We ordered tea early , "
100299	100331	100341	100341	Garth	111	" because we came in from our drive quite hungry . It is not five o'clock yet , and a radiant afternoon . The sun sets at half - past seven . "
100332	100339	100341	100341	Garth	111	" Then the light is good , "
100343	100594	100595	100596	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Have you finished tea ? The sun will be shining in at the west window of the studio . You know my studio at the top of the house ? You fetched the studies of Lady Brand from there . I dare say you noticed stacks of canvases in the corners . Some are unused ; some contain mere sketches or studies ; some are finished pictures . Miss Gray , among the latter are two which I am most anxious to identify and to destroy . I made Simpson guide me up the other day and leave me there alone . And I tried to find them by touch ; but I could not be sure , and I soon grew hopelessly confused amongst all the canvases . I did not wish to ask Simpson 's help , because the subjects , are well , somewhat unusual , and if he found out I had destroyed them it might set him wondering and talking , and one hates to awaken curiosity in a servant . I could not fall back on Sir Deryck because he would have recognised the portraits . The principal figure is known to him . When I painted those pictures I never dreamed of any eye but my own seeing them . So you , my dear and trusted secretary , are the one person to whom I can turn . Will you do what I ask ? And will you do it now ? "
100602	100631	100632	100632	Garth	111	" Why of course , Mr. Dalmain . I am here to do anything and everything you may desire ; and to do it when you desire it . "
100648	100720	100764	100764	she	228	" There is the studio latch - key . I think the canvases I want are in the corner furthest from the door , behind a yellow Japanese screen . They are large five feet by three and a half . If they are too cumbersome for you to bring down , lay them face to face , and ring for Simpson . But do not leave him alone with them . "
100758	100763	100764	100764	she	228	" Sit and play , "
100767	100840	100872	100872	he	1745	" while I am upstairs , doing your commission . But just tell me one thing . You know how greatly your work interests me . When I find the pictures , is it your wish that I give them a mere cursory glance , just sufficient for identification ; or may I look at them , in the beautiful studio light ? You can trust me to do whichever you desire . "
100858	100871	100872	100872	he	1745	" You may look at them of course , if you wish , "
100875	100948	100987	100987	she	228	" They are quite the best work I ever did , though I painted them wholly from memory . That is I mean , that used to be a knack of mine . And they are in no sense imaginary . I painted exactly what I saw at least , so far as the female face and figure are concerned . And they make the pictures . The others are mere accessories . "
100979	100986	101003	101003	Garth	111	" How shall I know them ? "
101027	101074	101177	101178	Nurse Rosemary	228	" A woman and a man ... alone , in a garden but the surroundings are only indicated . She is in evening dress ; soft , black , and trailing ; with lace at her breast . It is called : ' The Wife . ' "
101075	101078	101003	101003	Garth	111	" Yes ? "
101079	101121	101134	101137	the room-"a little child	3922	" The same woman ; the same scene ; but without the man , this time . No need to paint the man ; for now visible or invisible to her , he is always there . In her arms she holds "
101135	101148	101149	101150	The Veni	193	room-"a little child . It is called : ' The Mother . ' "
101161	101171	101940	101940	she	101	" Keep far our foes ; give peace at home "
101936	101939	101940	101940	she	101	" Before God "
101943	102015	102619	102619	they	1768	" in case I am never able to say or think it again , I will say it now I BELIEVE I WAS RIGHT . I considered Garth 's future happiness , and I considered my own . I decided as I did for both our sakes , at terrible cost to present joy . But , before God , I believed I was right ; and I BELIEVE IT STILL . "
102587	102597	103189	103189	she	101	" light that never was on sea or land . "
103183	103188	103189	103189	she	101	" It is true , "
103195	103221	103227	103227	she	400	" Yes ; it is true . I can not deny it . It is as I felt ; it must be as I looked . "
103236	103344	103509	103515	The same woman , seated as before	1782	" Oh , my God ! Is that as I looked ? And the next thing that happened was my boy lifting his shining eyes and gazing at me in the moonlight . Is THIS what he saw ? Did I look SO ? And did the woman who looked so ; and who , looking so , pressed his head down again upon her breast , refuse next day to marry him , on the grounds of his youth , and her superiority ? ... Oh , Garth , Garth ! ... O God , help him to understand ! ... help him to forgive me ! "
103412	103453	103494	103494	Jane	101	" O Love , that will not let me go , I rest my weary soul in Thee ; I give Thee back the life I owe , That in Thine ocean depths its flow May richer , fuller be . "
103454	103493	103639	103639	her	400	" O Light , that followest all my way , I yield my flick'ring torch to Thee ; My heart restores its borrowed ray , That in Thy sunshine 's blaze its day May brighter , fairer be . "

103843	103865	104046	104046	she	101	" It was not the sort of face one would have wanted to see always in front of one at table . "
103956	103996	104000	104000	Jane	101	" O Joy , that seekest me through pain , I can not close my heart to Thee ; I trace the rainbow through the rain , And feel the promise is not vain That morn shall tearless be . "
104003	104043	104187	104187	Jane	101	" Oh , my darling , forgive me . I was altogether wrong . I will confess ; and , God helping me , I will explain ; and , oh , my darling , you will forgive me ? "
104145	104186	104251	104251	Jane	101	" O Cross , that liftest up my head , I dare not ask to fly from Thee ; I lay in dust life 's glory dead , And from the ground there blossoms red Life that shall endless be . "
104268	104333	104367	104368	Truly Garth	276	" And the city was of pure gold ; and had no need of the sun , neither of the moon to shine in it : for the glory of God did lighten it . And there shall be no more death ; neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain : for the former things are passed away . "
104370	104376	104404	104404	she	101	" gone behind his blindness . "

104457	104461	104450	104450	her	101	" THE LADY PORTRAYED "
104462	104485	104572	104573	Nurse Rosemary	228	" It has taken you long , Miss Gray . I nearly sent Simpson up , to find out what had happened . "
104486	104533	104560	104560	he	111	" I am glad you did not do that , Mr. Dalmain . Simpson would have found me weeping on the studio floor ; and to ask his assistance under those circumstances , would have been more humbling than inquiring after the fly in the soup ! "
104556	104559	104560	104560	he	111	" Weeping ! "
104563	104566	104572	104573	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Why ? "
104567	104570	104572	104573	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Because , "
104575	104615	104644	104644	he	111	" I have been entranced . These pictures are so exquisite . They stir one 's deepest depths . And yet they are so pathetic ah , SO pathetic ; because you have made a plain woman , beautiful . "
104639	104643	104654	104655	Nurse Rosemary	228	" A WHAT ? "
104647	104652	104654	104655	Nurse Rosemary	228	" A plain woman , "
104659	104724	104744	104744	he	111	" Surely you realised your model to be that . And therein lies the wonder of the pictures . You have so beautified her by wifehood , and glorified her by motherhood , that the longer one looks the more one forgets her plainness ; seeing her as loving and loved ; lovable , and therefore lovely . It is a triumph of art . "
104735	104743	104744	104744	he	111	" It is a triumph of truth , "
104747	104754	104763	104764	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I painted what I saw . "
104755	104761	104763	104764	Nurse Rosemary	228	" You painted her soul , "
104766	104774	104783	104783	Garth	111	" and it illuminated her plain face . "
104775	104781	104783	104783	Garth	111	" I SAW her soul , "
104790	104813	104828	104829	Nurse Rosemary	228	" and that vision was so radiant that it illumined my dark life . The remembrance lightens my darkness , even now . "
104835	104859	104874	104874	he	111	" Mr. Dalmain , I have a request to make of you . I want to beg you not to destroy these pictures . "
104865	104873	104874	104874	he	111	" I must destroy them , child , "
104877	104896	104956	104957	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I can not risk their being seen by people who would recognise my the the lady portrayed . "
104897	104916	104924	104924	Garth	111	" At all events , there is one person who must see them , before they are destroyed . "
104917	104922	104933	104934	Nurse Rosemary	228	" And that is ? "
104926	104931	104956	104957	Nurse Rosemary	228	" The lady portrayed , "
104938	104949	104956	104957	Nurse Rosemary	228	" How do you know she has not seen them ? "
104950	104954	104964	104964	Garth	111	" Has she ? "
104959	104962	104964	104964	Garth	111	" No , "
104968	104974	104956	104957	Nurse Rosemary	228	" and she never will . "
104975	104979	104994	104994	he	111	" She must . "
104990	104993	104964	104964	Garth	111	" Why ? "
105005	105026	105047	105047	he	111	" Because of all it would mean to a woman who knows herself plain , to see herself thus beautified . "
105038	105046	105062	105063	Nurse Rosemary	228	" A woman who knows herself plain ? "
105057	105060	105062	105063	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Yes , "
105067	105146	105159	105160	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Do you suppose , for a moment , that that lady 's mirror has ever shown her a reflection in any way approaching what you have made her in these pictures ? When we stand before our looking - glasses , Mr. Dalmain , scowling anxiously at hats and bows , and partings , we usually look our very worst ; and that lady , at her very worst , would be of a most discouraging plainness . "
105152	105157	105178	105178	she	1804	" Depend upon it , "
105182	105183	105197	105197	he	111	" .
105193	105196	105238	105238	she	228	" Yes , "
105242	105248	105254	105254	Garth	111	" Is she a mother ? "
105249	105252	105254	105254	Garth	111	" No , "
105256	105264	105238	105238	she	228	" I painted what might have been . "
105265	105268	105277	105277	Garth	111	" If ? "
105269	105275	105292	105292	she	228	" If it HAD been , "
105286	105291	105292	105292	she	228	" Dear Mr. Dalmain , "
105297	105340	105346	105346	Garth	111	" I realise how officious I must seem to you , with all these questions , and suggestions . But you must blame the hold these wonderful paintings of yours have taken on my mind . Oh , they are beautiful beautiful ! "
105341	105344	105346	105346	Garth	111	" Ah , "
105359	105401	105660	105660	she	228	" Miss Gray , I have somewhat forgotten them . Have you them here ? That is right . Put them up before you , and describe them to me . Let me hear how they struck you , as pictures . "
105646	105659	105660	105660	she	228	" And it is such a beautiful crimson rambler , Mr. Dalmain , "
105663	105691	105712	105712	he	111	" I like the idea of its being small and in bud , in the first picture ; and blooming in full glory , in the second . "
105708	105711	105712	105712	he	111	" Yes , "
105715	105818	105827	105828	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I am glad you noticed that . And , look here . We will not destroy them at once . Now they are found , there is no hurry . I am afraid I am giving you a lot of trouble ; but will you ask for some large sheets of brown paper , and make a package , and write upon it : ' Not to be opened , ' and tell Margery to put them back in the studio . Then , when I want them , at any time , I shall have no difficulty in identifying them . "
105819	105825	105827	105828	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I am so glad , "
105830	105836	105849	105849	Garth	111	" Then perhaps the plain lady "
105837	105847	105849	105849	Garth	111	" I can not have her spoken of so , "
105853	105987	105994	105995	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I do not know what she thought of herself I doubt if she ever gave a thought to self at all . I do not know what you would have thought of her . I can only tell you that , to me , hers is the one face which is visible in my darkness . All the loveliness I have painted , all the beauty I have admired , fades from my mental vision , as wreaths of mist ; flutters from memory 's sight , as autumn leaves . Her face alone abides ; calm , holy , tender , beautiful , it is always before me . And it pains me that one who has only seen her as MY hand depicted her should speak of her as plain . "
105988	105992	105994	105995	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Forgive me , "
105999	106106	106168	106168	he	111	" I did not mean to pain you , sir . And , to show you what your pictures have done for me , may I tell you a resolution I made in the studio ? I can not miss what they depict the sweetest joys of life for want of the courage to confess myself wrong ; pocket my pride ; and be frank and humble . I am going to write a full confession to my young man , as to my share of the misunderstanding which has parted us . Do you think he will understand ? Do you think he will forgive ? "
106154	106167	106297	106297	she	101	" He will be a brute if he does n't , child , "
106321	106448	106859	106860	Nurse Rosemary	228	" the silly little minds of women who say they are afraid of her , and that she makes them nervous ! You see she looks right into their shallow shuffling little souls , full of conceited thoughts about themselves , and nasty ill - natured thoughts about her ; and no wonder they grow panic - stricken , and flee ; and talk of her as ' that formidable Miss Champion . ' I never found her formidable ; but , when I had the chance of a real talk with her , I used to be thankful I had nothing of which to be ashamed . Those clear eyes touched bottom every time , as our kindred over the water so expressively put it . "
106863	106882	106890	106890	Garth	111	" Mr. Dalmain , can you spare me for a few days at the end of this week ? "
106883	106888	106890	106890	Garth	111	" Oh , why ? "
106892	106970	106987	106987	she	228	" To go where ? And for how long ? Ah , I know I ought to say : ' Certainly ! Delighted ! ' after all your goodness to me . But I really can not ! You do n't know what life was without you , when you week - ended ! That week - end seemed months , even though Brand was here . It is your own fault for making yourself so indispensable . "
106975	106986	106987	106987	she	228	" I daresay I shall not be away for long , "
106990	107074	107113	107113	he	111	" That is , if you want me , I can return . But , Mr. Dalmain , I intend to - night to write that letter of which I told you . I shall post it to - morrow . I must follow it up almost immediately . I must be with him when he receives it , or soon afterwards . I think I hope he will want me at once . This is Monday . May I go on Thursday ? "
107081	107112	107130	107131	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Do nurses , as a rule , leave their patients , and rush off to their young men in order to find out how they have liked their letters ? "
107120	107128	107130	107131	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Not as a rule , sir , "
107135	107143	107216	107217	Nurse Rosemary	228	" But this is an exceptional case . "
107144	107151	107130	107131	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I shall wire to Brand . "
107152	107165	107175	107175	Garth	111	" He will send you a more efficient and more dependable person . "
107166	107173	107175	107175	Garth	111	" Oh you wicked little thing ! "
107177	107201	107216	107217	Nurse Rosemary	228	" If Miss Champion were here , she would shake you ! You , know perfectly well that nobody could fill your place ! "
107202	107214	107216	107217	Nurse Rosemary	228	" It is good of you to say so , sir , "
107221	107232	107130	107131	Nurse Rosemary	228	" And is Miss Champion much addicted to shaking people ? "
107233	107448	107216	107217	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Do n't call me ' sir ' ! Yes ; when people are tiresome she often says she would like to shake them ; and one has a mental vision of how their teeth would chatter . There is a certain little lady of our acquaintance whom we always call ' Mrs. Do - and - don't . ' She is n't in our set ; but she calls upon it ; and sometimes it asks her to lunch , for fun . If you inquire whether she likes a thing , she says : ' Well , I do , and I do n't . ' If you ask whether she is going to a certain function , she says : ' Well , I am , and I 'm not . ' And if you send her a note , imploring a straight answer to a direct question , the answer comes back : ' Yes AND no . ' Miss Champion used to say she would like to take her up by the scruff of her feather boa , and shake her , asking at intervals : ' Shall I stop ? ' so as to wring from Mrs. Do - and - don't a definite affirmative , for once . "
107449	107466	107130	107131	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Could Miss Champion carry out such a threat ? Is she a very massive person ? "
107467	107565	107611	107611	Garth	111	" Well , she could , you know ; but she would n't . She is most awfully kind , even to little freaks she laughs at . No , she is n't massive . That word does not describe her at all . But she is large , and very finely developed . Do you know the Venus of Milo ? Yes ; in the Louvre . I am glad you know Paris . Well , just imagine the Venus of Milo in a tailor - made coat and skirt , and you have Miss Champion . "
107594	107609	107611	107611	Garth	111	" Little Dicky Brand summed up Mrs. Do - and - don't rather well , "
107613	107696	107697	107697	I	0	" She was calling at Wimpole Street , on Lady Brand 's ' at home ' day . And Dicky stood talking to me , in his black velvets and white waistcoat , a miniature edition of Sir Deryck . He indicated Mrs. Do - and - don't on a distant lounge , and remarked : ' THAT lady never KNOWS ; she always THINKS . I asked her if her little girl might come to my party , and she said : "
107701	107721	107803	107803	I	0	" Now if she had asked ME if I was coming to HER party , I should have said : "
107728	107802	107803	107803	I	0	" It is very trying when people only THINK about important things , such as little girls and parties ; because their thinking never amounts to much . It does not so much matter what they think about other things the weather , for instance ; because that all happens , whether they think or not . Mummie asked that lady whether it was raining when she got here ; and she said : "
107807	107948	107955	107955	I	0	" I ca n't imagine why Mummie always wants to know what her friends think about the weather . I have heard her ask seven ladies this afternoon whether it is raining . Now if father or I wanted to know whether it was raining we should just step over to the window , and look out ; and then come back and go do with really interesting conversation . But Mummie asks them whether it is raining , or whether they think it has been raining , or is going to rain ; and when they have told her , she hurries away and asks somebody else . I asked the thinking lady in the feather thing , whether she knew who the father and mother were , of the young lady whom Cain married ; and she said : "
107959	107963	108082	108082	he	1828	" I said : "
108014	108080	108122	108122	you	1833	" But she thought she had to go , quite in a hurry . So I saw her off ; and then asked the Bishop alone . Bishops are most satisfactory kind of people ; because they are quite sure about everything ; and you feel safe in quoting them to Nurse . Nurse told Marsdon that this one is in ' sheep 's clothing , "
108129	108139	108122	108122	you	1833	" ? I asked father , and he said : "
108146	108174	108264	108265	Nurse Rosemary	228	" And mother seemed as shocked as if father and I had spoken in church , instead of just as we came out . And she said : "
108181	108185	108264	108265	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Possibly she thinks "
108187	108193	108264	108265	Nurse Rosemary	228	" is spelled with only one "
108195	108210	108222	108222	she	228	" Anyway father and I felt it best to let the subject drop . ' "
108215	108221	108222	108222	she	228	" How exactly like Dicky , "
108225	108244	108257	108257	Garth	111	" I could hear his grave little voice , and almost see him pull down his small waistcoat ! "
108245	108255	108264	108265	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Why , do you know the little chap ? "
108259	108262	108264	108265	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Yes , "
108267	108308	108316	108316	Garth	111	" I have stayed with them . Talking to Dicky is an education ; and Baby Blossom is a sweet romp . Here comes Simpson . How quickly the evening has flown . Then may I be off on Thursday ? "
108309	108314	108316	108316	Garth	111	" I am helpless , "
108318	108335	108264	108265	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I can not say ' no . ' But suppose you do not come back ? "
108336	108345	108357	108357	Garth	111	" Then you can wire to Dr. Brand . "
108346	108355	108371	108372	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I believe you want to leave me , "
108360	108369	108591	108591	Simpson	230	" I do , and I do n't ! "
108598	108606	108632	108632	he	230	" A telegram for you , miss . "
108635	108639	108632	108632	he	230	" unHaided HintuHition , "
108643	108646	108632	108632	he	230	" nurse , "

108768	108778	108788	108788	Maggie	147	" Said more than he knew , you mean , "
108783	108786	108788	108788	Maggie	147	" No , "
108790	108804	108825	108825	Margery	147	" I know what I said ; and I said what I meant . "
108805	108823	108849	108850	old Margery	147	" You may have said what you meant , but you did not mean what you knew , "
108827	108847	108868	108868	Maggie	147	" and if anybody says another word on the matter , I shall say grace and dismiss the table , "
108879	108882	108903	108903	Jane	101	" mean . "
108911	108919	108968	108969	Nurse Rosemary	228	" A telegram for you , miss . "
108980	108989	109000	109000	Garth	111	" No answer , thank you , Simpson . "
108990	108998	109007	109008	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Not bad news , I hope ? "
109002	109005	109007	109008	Nurse Rosemary	228	" No , "
109010	109057	109080	109080	Garth	111	" but it makes my departure on Thursday imperative . It is from an old aunt of mine , who is going to my ' young man 's ' home . I must be with him before she is , or there will be endless complications . "
109058	109078	109091	109092	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I do n't believe he will ever let you go again , when once he gets you back , "
109084	109089	109302	109302	Garth	111	" You think not ? "
109293	109300	109314	109315	Nurse Rosemary	228	" What shall I play next ? "
109306	109312	109353	109353	him	111	" Veni , Creator Spiritus , "
109326	109333	109353	109353	him	111	" SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN ! "
109363	109384	109471	109471	She	101	" It is not mine to sing the stately grace , The great soul beaming in my lady 's face . "
109479	109494	109664	109664	he	111	" Darling my Darling ! Good morning ! God bless you to - day . "
109671	109707	109715	109715	Jane	101	" But mine it is to follow in her train ; Do her behests in pleasure or in pain ; Burn at her altar love 's sweet frankincense , And worship her in distant reverence . "
109708	109713	109715	109715	Jane	101	" Ah , beloved ! "
109717	109751	109793	109793	Jane	101	" not ' distant . ' If you want her , and call her , it will be to the closest closeness love can devise . No more distance between you and me . "
109795	109830	109838	109838	she	101	" For He is our peace , Who hath made both one , and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us ... that He might reconcile both ... by the cross . "
109831	109837	109838	109838	she	101	" Ah , dear Christ ! "
109841	109889	109909	109909	He	230	" If Thy cross could do this for Jew and Gentile , may not my boy 's heavy cross , so bravely borne , do it for him and for me ? So shall we come at last , indeed , to ' kiss the cross . ' "

109989	110178	110238	110238	he	111	" What a May Day ! Simpson and I were up with the lark ; were n't we , Simpson ? Poor Simpson felt like a sort of ' Queen of the May , ' when my electric bell trilled in his room , at 5 A.M. But I could n't stay in bed . I woke with my something - is - going - to - happen feeling ; and when I was a little chap and woke with that , Margery used to say : ' Get up quickly then , Master Garth , and it will happen all the sooner . ' You ask her if she did n't , Simpson . Miss Gray , did you ever learn : ' If you 're waking call me early , call me early , mother dear ' ? I always hated that young woman ! I should think , in her excited state , she would have been waking long before her poor mother , who must have been worn to a perfect rag , making all the hussy 's May Queen - clothes , overnight . "
110232	110237	110238	110238	he	111	" Roses for Rosemary , "
110241	110421	110428	110429	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Wear it , if you are sure the young man would not object . I have been thinking about him and the aunt . I wish you could ask them both here , instead of going away on Thursday . We would have the ' maddest , merriest time ! ' I would play with the aunt , while you had it out with the young man . And I could easily keep the aunt away from nooks and corners , because my hearing is sharper than any aunt 's eyes could be , and if you gave a gentle cough , I would promptly clutch hold of auntie , and insist upon being guided in the opposite direction . And I would take her out in the motor ; and you and the young man could have the gig . And then when all was satisfactorily settled , we could pack them off home , and be by ourselves again . Ah , Miss Gray , do send for them , instead of leaving me on Thursday . "
110422	110426	110434	110434	she	228	" Mr. Dalmain , "
110449	110477	110486	110486	Garth	111	" this May - Day morning has gone to your head . I shall send for Margery . She may have known the symptoms , of old . "
110478	110484	110488	110488	He	111	" It is not that , "
110495	110647	110655	110656	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Something is going to happen to - day , little Rosemary . Whenever I feel like this , something happens . The first time it occurred , about twenty - five years ago , there was a rocking - horse in the hall , when I ran downstairs ! I have never forgotten my first ride on that rocking - horse . The fearful joy when he went backward ; the awful plunge when he went forward ; and the proud moment when it was possible to cease clinging to the leather pommel . I nearly killed the cousin who pulled out his tail . I thrashed him , then and there , WITH the tail ; which was such a silly thing to do ; because , though it damaged the cousin , it also spoiled the tail . The next time ah , but I am boring you ! "
110648	110653	110655	110656	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Not at all , "
110660	110681	110717	110717	she	228	" but I want you to have some breakfast ; and the letters will be here in a few minutes . "
110720	110727	110737	110737	Garth	111	" The letters will be here . "
110728	110735	110737	110737	Garth	111	" Oh , bother the letters ! "
110739	110816	110823	110824	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Let 's have a holiday from letters on May Day ! You shall be Queen of the May ; and Margery shall be the old mother . I will be Robin , with the breaking heart , leaning on the bridge beneath the hazel tree ; and Simpson can be the ' bolder lad . ' And we will all go and ' gather knots of flowers , and buds , and garlands gay . ' "
110817	110821	110823	110824	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Mr. Dalmain , "
110833	110858	110878	110878	Garth	111	" you really must be sensible , or I shall go and consult Margery . I have never seen you in such a mood . "
110859	110876	110969	110970	Nurse Rosemary	228	" You have never seen me , on a day when something was going to happen , "

111051	111068	111086	111086	he	111	" on this lovely May morning , will you take old Margery up into the woods ? "
111077	111085	111086	111086	he	111	" Of course I will , Margie , "
111089	111102	111112	111114	the old woman	1865	" And , I say Margie , SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN . "
111103	111110	111123	111123	she	1865	" I know it , laddie , "
111136	111188	111232	111232	he	111	" I woke with it too , Master Garthie ; and now we will go into the woods , and listen to the earth , and trees , and flowers , and they will tell us whether it is for joy , or for sorrow . Come , my own laddie . "
111224	111231	111232	111232	he	111	" Where is that secretary person ? "
111237	111246	111257	111258	old Margery	147	" She kept trying to shut me up . "
111247	111255	111257	111258	old Margery	147	" I know she did , laddie , "
111265	111290	111300	111300	Jane	101	" You see she does not know the ' something - is - going - to - happen - to - day ' awakening . "
111291	111298	111300	111300	Jane	101	" Ah , does n't she ? "
111309	111343	111439	111439	she	101	" But as my Garth has gone off his dear head , and been taken away by his nurse , the thing that is going to happen , ca n't happen just yet . "

111565	111571	111655	111655	he	1874	" I accept the cross , "
111650	111654	111655	111655	he	1874	" Miss Gray , "
111665	111773	111779	111780	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I must apologise for my behaviour this morning . I was what they call up here ' fey . ' Margery understands the mood ; and together she and I have listened to kind Mother Earth , laying our hands on her sympathetic softness , and she has told us her secrets . Then I lay down under the fir trees and slept ; and awakened calm and sane , and ready for what to - day must bring . For it WILL bring something . That is no delusion . It is a day of great things . That much , Margery knows , too . "
111774	111777	111779	111780	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Perhaps , "
111784	111795	111801	111801	Garth	111	" there may be news of interest in your letters . "
111796	111799	111801	111801	Garth	111	" Ah , "
111803	111831	111839	111840	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I forgot . We have not even opened this morning 's letters . Let us take time for them immediately after lunch . Are there many ? "
111832	111837	111801	111801	Garth	111	" Quite a pile , "
111842	111852	111990	111991	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Good . We will work soberly through them . "
111997	112018	112025	112025	Garth	111	" Mr. Dalmain , here is a letter , sealed with scarlet wax . The seal is a helmet with visor "
112019	112023	112025	112025	Garth	111	" I know , "
112027	112039	112040	112041	Nurse Rosemary	228	" You need not describe it further . Kindly open it . "
112045	112056	112103	112104	Nurse Rosemary	228	" It is a very long letter , Mr. Dalmain . "
112057	112071	112103	112104	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Indeed ? Will you please read it to me , Miss Gray . "
112107	112129	112130	112130	Garth	111	" Indeed , sir , it seems a most private letter . I find it difficult to read it to you . "
112144	112209	112219	112220	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Never mind , my dear child . It in no way concerns you . It is a private letter to me ; but my only means of hearing it is through your eyes , and from your lips . Besides , the lady , whose seal is a plumed helmet , can have nothing of a very private nature to say to me . "
112210	112217	112239	112239	he	111	" Ah , but she has , "
112232	112238	112239	112239	he	111	" Turn over the page , "
112242	112249	112258	112259	Nurse Rosemary	228	" and tell me the signature . "
112250	112256	112270	112270	Garth	111	" There are many pages , "
112261	112268	112270	112270	Garth	111	" Turn over the pages then , "
112274	112287	112294	112295	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Do not keep me waiting . How is that letter signed ? "
112288	112292	112330	112330	he	111	" YOUR WIFE , "
112336	112408	112437	112437	his	111	" Will you give me that letter , if you please , Miss Gray ? Thank you . I wish to be alone for a quarter of an hour . I shall be glad if you will be good enough to sit in the dining - room , and stop any one from coming into this room . I must be undisturbed . At the end of that time kindly return . "
112447	112453	112527	112527	herself	101	" I accept the cross . "

113626	113632	113633	113633	he	111	" My dear Miss Gray , "
113636	113816	113826	113827	Nurse Rosemary	228	" we have a difficult task before us . I have received a letter , which it is essential I should hear . I am obliged to ask you to read it to me , because there is absolutely no one else to whom I can prefer such a request . I can not but know that it will be a difficult and painful task for you , feeling yourself an intermediary between two wounded and sundered hearts . May I make it easier , my dear little girl , by assuring you that I know of no one in this world from whose lips I could listen to the contents of that letter with less pain ; and , failing my own , there are no eyes beneath which I could less grudgingly let it pass , there is no mind I could so unquestioningly trust , to judge kindly , both of myself and of the writer ; and to forget faithfully , all which was not intended to come within the knowledge of a third person . "
113817	113824	113851	113851	he	111	" Thank you , Mr. Dalmain , "
113843	113850	113861	113862	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Now , if you please , "
113867	114078	114090	114091	Nurse Rosemary	228	" DEAR GARTH , As you will not let me come to you , so that I could say , between you and me alone , that which must be said , I am compelled to write it . It is your own fault , Dal ; and we both pay the penalty . For how can I write to you freely when I know , that as you listen , it will seem to you of every word I am writing , that I am dragging a third person into that which ought to be , most sacredly , between you and me alone . And yet , I must write freely ; and I must make you fully understand ; because the whole of your future life and mine will depend upon your reply to this letter . I must write as if you were able to hold the letter in your own hands , and read it to yourself . Therefore , if you can not completely trust your secretary , with the private history of your heart and mine , bid her give it you back without turning this first page ; and let me come myself , Garth , and tell you all the rest . "
114079	114088	114116	114116	he	111	" That is the bottom of the page , "
114103	114115	114119	114120	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I do completely trust ; and she must not come , "
114130	114337	114411	114412	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I want you to remember , Garth , that every word I write , is the simple unvarnished truth . If you look back over your remembrance of me , you will admit that I am not naturally an untruthful person , nor did I ever take easily to prevarication . But , Garth , I told you one lie ; and that fatal exception proves the rule of perfect truthfulness , which has always otherwise held , between you and me ; and , please God , always will hold . The confession herein contained , concerns that one lie ; and I need not ask you to realise how humbling it is to my pride to have to force the hearing of a confession upon the man who has already refused to admit me to a visit of friendship . You will remember that I am not naturally humble ; and have a considerable amount of proper pride ; and , perhaps , by the greatness of the effort I have had to make , you will be able to gauge the greatness of my love . God help you to do so my darling ; my beloved ; my poor desolate boy ! "
114420	114618	114698	114698	he	111	" Ah , what a wrong I have done , both to you , and to myself ! Dear , you remember the evening on the terrace at Shenstone , when you asked me to be when you called me when I WAS YOUR WIFE ? Garth , I leave this last sentence as it stands , with its two attempts to reach the truth . I will not cross them out , but leave them to be read to you ; for , you see Garth , I finally arrived ! I WAS your wife . I did not understand it then . I was intensely surprised ; unbelievably inexperienced in matters of feeling ; and bewildered by the flood of sensation which swept me off my feet and almost engulfed me . But even then I knew that my soul arose and proclaimed you mate and master . And when you held me , and your dear head lay upon my heart , I knew , for the first time the meaning of the word ecstasy ; and I could have asked no kinder gift of heaven , than to prolong those moments into hours . "
114692	114697	114698	114698	he	111	" Poor little girl , "
114701	114744	114746	114747	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I am so sorry . It is rough on you . If only it had come when Brand was here ! I am afraid you MUST go on ; but try to read without realising . Leave the realising to me . "
114751	115338	114746	114747	Nurse Rosemary	228	" When you lifted your head in the moonlight and gazed long and earnestly at me Ah , those dear eyes ! your look suddenly made me self - conscious . There swept over me a sense of my own exceeding plainness , and of how little there was in what those dear eyes saw , to provide reason , for that adoring look . Overwhelmed with a shy shame I pressed your head back to the place where the eyes would be hidden ; and I realise now what a different construction you must have put upon that action . Garth , I assure you , that when you lifted your head the second time , and said , ' My wife , ' it was the first suggestion to my mind that this wonderful thing which was happening meant marriage . I know it must seem almost incredible , and more like a child of eighteen , than a woman of thirty . But you must remember , all my dealings with men up to that hour had been handshakes , heartiest comradeship , and an occasional clap on the shoulder given and received . And do n't forget , dear King of my heart , that , until one short week before , you had been amongst the boys who called me ' good old Jane , ' and addressed me in intimate conversation as ' my dear fellow ' ! Do n't forget that I had always looked upon you as YEARS younger than myself ; and though a strangely sweet tie had grown up between us , since the evening of the concert at Overdene , I had never realised it as love . Well you will remember how I asked for twelve hours to consider my answer ; and you yielded , immediately ; you were so perfect , all the time , Garth and left me , when I asked to be alone ; left me , with a gesture I have never forgotten . It was a revelation of the way in which the love of a man such as you exalts the woman upon whom it is outpoured . The hem of that gown has been a sacred thing to me , ever since . It is always with me , though I never wear it . A detailed account of the hours which followed , I shall hope to give you some day , my dearest . I can not write it . Let me hurl on to paper , in all its crude ugliness , the miserable fact which parted us ; turning our dawning joy to disillusion and sadness . Garth it was this . I did not believe your love would stand the test of my plainness . I knew what a worshipper of beauty you were ; how you must have it , in one form or another , always around you . I got out my diary in which I had recorded verbatim our conversation about the ugly preacher , whose face became illumined into beauty , by the inspired glory within . And you added that you never thought him ugly again ; but he would always be plain . And you said it was not the sort of face one would want to have always before one at meals ; but that you were not called upon to undergo that discipline , which would be sheer martyrdom to you . "
115339	115982	114746	114747	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I was so interested , at the time ; and so amused at the unconscious way in which you stood and explained this , to quite the plainest woman of your acquaintance , that I recorded it very fully in my journal . Alas ! On that important night , I read the words , over and over , until they took morbid hold upon my brain . Then such is the self - consciousness awakened in a woman by the fact that she is loved and sought I turned on all the lights around my mirror , and critically and carefully examined the face you would have to see every day behind your coffee - pot at breakfast , for years and years , if I said ' Yes , ' on the morrow . Darling , I did not see myself through your eyes , as , thank God , I have done since . And I DID NOT TRUST YOUR LOVE TO STAND THE TEST . It seemed to me , I was saving both of us from future disappointment and misery , by bravely putting away present joy , in order to avoid certain disenchantment . My beloved , it will seem to you so coolly calculating , and so mean ; so unworthy of the great love you were even then lavishing upon me . But remember , for years , your remarkable personal grace and beauty had been a source of pleasure to me ; and I had pictured you wedded to Pauline Lister , for instance , in her dazzling whiteness , and soft radiant youth . So my morbid self - consciousness said : ' What ! This young Apollo , tied to my ponderous plainness ; growing handsomer every year , while I grow older and plainer ? ' Ah , darling ! It sounds so unworthy , now we know what our love is . But it sounded sensible and right that night ; and at last , with a bosom that ached , and arms that hung heavy at the thought of being emptied of all that joy , I made up my mind to say ' no . ' Ah , believe me , I had no idea what it already meant to you . I thought you would pass on at once to another fancy ; and transfer your love to one more able to meet your needs , at every point . Honestly , Garth , I thought I should be the only one left desolate . Then came the question : how to refuse you . I knew if I gave the true reason , you would argue it away , and prove me wrong , with glowing words , before which I should perforce yield . So as I really meant not to let you run the risk , and not to run it myself I lied to you , my beloved . To you , whom my whole being acclaimed King of my heart , Master of my will ; supreme to me , in love and life , to YOU I said : ' I can not marry a mere boy . ' Ah , darling ! I do not excuse it . I do not defend it . I merely confess it ; trusting to your generosity to admit , that no other answer would have sent you away . Ah , your poor Jane , left desolate ! If you could have seen her in the little church , calling you back ; retracting and promising ; listening for your returning footsteps , in an agony of longing . But my Garth is not made of the stuff which stands waiting on the door - mat of a woman 's indecision . "
115983	116138	114746	114747	Nurse Rosemary	228	" The lonely year which followed so broke my nerve , that Deryck Brand told me I was going all to pieces , and ordered me abroad . I went , as you know ; and in other , and more vigorous , surroundings , there came to me a saner view of life . In Egypt last March , on the summit of the Great Pyramid , I made up my mind that I could live without you no longer . I did not see myself wrong ; but I yearned so for your love , and to pour mine upon you , my beloved , that I concluded it was worth the risk . I made up my mind to take the next boat home , and send for you . Then oh , my own boy I heard . I wrote to you ; and you would not let me come . "
116139	116337	114746	114747	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Now I know perfectly well , that you might say : ' She did not trust me when I had my sight . Now that I can not see , she is no longer afraid . ' Garth , you might , say that ; but it would not be true . I have had ample proof lately that I was wrong , and ought to have trusted you all through . What it is , I will tell you later . All I can say now is : that , if your dear shining eyes could see , they would see , NOW , a woman who is , trustfully and unquestioningly , all your own . If she is doubtful of her face and figure , she says quite simply : ' They pleased HIM ; and they are just HIS . I have no further right to criticise them . If he wants them , they are not mine , but his . ' Darling , I can not tell you now , how I have arrived at this assurance . But I have had proofs beyond words of your faithfulness and love . "
116338	116426	114746	114747	Nurse Rosemary	228	" The question , therefore , simply resolves itself into this : Can you forgive me ? If you can forgive me , I can come to you at once . If this thing is past forgiveness , I must make up my mind to stay away . But , oh , my own Dear , the bosom on which once you laid your head waits for you with the longing ache of lonely years . If you need it , do not thrust it from you . "
116427	116496	116564	116564	he	111	" Write me one word by your own hand : ' Forgiven . ' It is all I ask . When it reaches me , I will come to you at once . Do not dictate a letter to your secretary . I could not bear it . Just write if you can truly write it ' FORGIVEN ' ; and send it to ' Your Wife . ' "
116552	116563	116595	116596	Nurse Rosemary	228	" She has asked me to do a thing impossible , "
116584	116593	116605	116605	Garth	111	" CAN you not write ' forgiven ' ? "
116600	116603	116605	116605	Garth	111	" No , "
116607	116626	116680	116680	he	111	" I can not . Little girl , give me a sheet of paper , and a pencil . "
116674	116679	116695	116695	she	228	" Is that legible ? "
116690	116694	116715	116715	Garth	111	" Quite legible , "
116711	116714	116715	116715	Garth	111	" forgiven , "
116719	116722	116732	116732	Garth	111	" LOVED . "
116723	116731	116732	116732	Garth	111	" Can you post it at once ? "
116742	116776	116800	116800	she	228	" And she will come oh , my God , she will come ! If we catch to - night 's mail , she may be here the day after to - morrow ! "
116795	116799	116800	116800	she	228	" Mr. Dalmain , "
116803	116825	116844	116844	he	111	" there is a postscript to this letter . It says : ' Write to The Palace Hotel , Aberdeen . ' "
116839	116843	116844	116844	he	111	" In Aberdeen ? "
116847	116943	117028	117028	she	228	" Jane , in Aberdeen ! Oh , my God ! If she gets this paper to - morrow morning , she may be here any time in the day . Jane ! Jane ! Dear little Rosemary , do you hear ? Jane will come to - morrow ! Did n't I tell you something was going to happen ? You and Simpson were too British to understand ; but Margery knew ; and the woods told us it was Joy coming through Pain . Could that be posted at once , Miss Gray ? "
117013	117027	117028	117028	she	228	" I will go to the post - office myself , Mr. Dalmain , "
117031	117050	117075	117075	she	228	" I shall be glad of the walk ; and I can be back by tea - time . "
117094	117105	117075	117075	she	228	" Come here by 5.50 train without fail this evening . "
117118	117123	117137	117138	Nurse Rosemary	228	" All is right . "
117131	117135	117137	117138	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Mr. Dalmain , "
117144	117249	117436	117437	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I really do want you to sit down , and give your mind to the tea - table . How can you remember where each thing is placed , if you keep jumping up , and moving your chair into different positions ? And last time you pounded the table to attract my attention , which was already anxiously fixed upon you , you nearly knocked over your own tea , and sent floods of mine into the saucer . If you can not behave better , I shall ask Margery for a pinafore , and sit you up on a high chair ! "
117276	117350	117369	117370	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Then I should have to say : ' Please , Nurse , may I get down ? ' What a cheeky little thing you are becoming ! And you used to be quite oppressively polite . I suppose you would answer : ' If you say your grace nicely , Master Garth , you may . ' Do you know the story of ' Tommy , you should say Your Grace ' ? "
117351	117367	117436	117437	Nurse Rosemary	228	" You have told it to me twice in the last forty - eight hours , "
117374	117421	117436	117437	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Oh , what a pity ! I felt so like telling it now . If you had really been the sort of sympathetic person Sir Deryck described , you would have said : ' No ; and I should so LOVE to hear it ! ' "
117422	117434	117436	117437	Nurse Rosemary	228	" No ; and I should so LOVE to hear it ! "
117439	117561	117572	117573	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Too late ! That sort of thing , to have any value should be spontaneous . It need not be true ; but it MUST be spontaneous . But , talking of a high chair , when you say those chaffy things in a voice like Jane 's , and just as Jane would have said them oh , my wig ! Do you know , that is the duchess 's only original little swear . All the rest are quotations . And when she says : ' My wig ! ' we all try not to look at it . It is usually slightly awry . The toucan tweaks it . He is so very LOVING , dear bird ! "
117562	117570	117572	117573	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Now hand me the buttered toast , "
117575	117654	117672	117672	Garth	111	" and do n't tell me any more naughty stories about the duchess . No ! That is the thin bread - and - butter . I told you you would lose your bearings . The toast is in a warm plate on your right . Now let us make believe I am Miss Champion , and hand it to me , as nicely as you will be handing it to her , this time to - morrow . "
117655	117670	117672	117672	Garth	111	" It is easy to make believe you are Jane , with that voice , "
117674	117868	117572	117573	Nurse Rosemary	228	" and yet I do n't know . I have never really associated you with her . One little sentence of old Rob 's made all the difference to me . He said you had fluffy floss - silk sort of hair . No one could ever imagine Jane with fluffy floss - silk sort of hair ! And I believe that one sentence saved the situation . Otherwise , your voice would have driven me mad , those first days . As it was , I used to wonder sometimes if I could possibly bear it . You understand why , now ; do n't you ? And yet , in a way , it is NOT like hers . Hers is deeper ; and she often speaks with a delicious kind of drawl , and uses heaps of slang ; and you are such a very proper little person ; and possess what the primers call ' perfectly correct diction . ' What fun it would be to hear you and Jane talk together ! And yet I do n't know . I should be on thorns , all the time . "
117869	117872	117922	117922	Garth	111	" Why ? "
117873	117920	117922	117922	Garth	111	" I should be so awfully afraid lest you should not like one another . You see , YOU have really , in a way , been more to me than any one else in the world ; and SHE well , she IS my world , "
117926	117987	117997	117998	Nurse Rosemary	228	" And I should be so afraid lest she should not fully appreciate you ; and you should not quite understand her . She has a sort of way of standing and looking people up and down , and , women hate it ; especially pretty fluffy little women . They feel she spots all the things that come off . "
117988	117995	117997	117998	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Nothing of mine comes off , "
118000	118014	118020	118020	Garth	111	" excepting my patient , when he will not stay on his chair . "
118015	118018	118036	118036	Jane	101	" Once , "
118039	118865	118972	118973	Nurse Rosemary	228	" there was a fearfully silly little woman staying at Overdene , when a lot of us were there . We never could make out why she was included in one of the duchess 's ' best parties , ' except that the dear duchess vastly enjoyed taking her off , and telling stories about her ; and we could not appreciate the cleverness of the impersonation , unless we had seen the original . She was rather pretty , in a fussy , curling - tongs , wax - doll sort of way ; but she never could let her appearance alone , or allow people to forget it . Almost every sentence she spoke , drew attention to it . We got very sick of it , and asked Jane to make her shut up . But Jane said : ' It does n't hurt you , boys ; and it pleases her . Let her be . ' Jane was always extra nice to people , if she suspected they were asked down in order to make sport for the duchess afterwards . Jane hated that sort of thing . She could n't say much to her aunt ; but we had to be very careful how we egged the duchess on , if Jane was within hearing . Well one evening , after tea , a little group of us were waiting around the fire in the lower hall , to talk to Jane . It was Christmas time . The logs looked so jolly on the hearth . The red velvet curtains were drawn right across , covering the terrace door and the windows on either side . Tommy sat on his perch , in the centre of the group , keeping a keen lookout for cigarette ends . Outside , the world was deep in snow ; and that wonderful silence reigned ; making the talk and laughter within all the more gay by contrast you know , that PENETRATING silence ; when trees , and fields , and paths , are covered a foot thick in soft sparkling whiteness . I always look forward , just as eagerly , each winter to the first sight ah , I forgot ! ... Fancy never seeing snow again ! ... Never mind . It is something to remember HAVING seen it ; and I shall hear the wonderful snow - silence more clearly than ever . Perhaps before other people pull up the blinds , I shall be able to say : ' There 's been a fall of snow in the night . ' What was I telling you ? Yes , I remember . About little Mrs. Fussy . Well all the women had gone up to dress for dinner ; excepting Jane , who never needed more than half an hour ; and Fussy , who was being sprightly , in a laboured way ; and fancied herself the centre of attraction which kept us congregated in the hall . As a matter of fact , we were waiting to tell Jane some private news we had just heard about a young chap in the guards , who was in fearful hot water for ragging . His colonel was an old friend of Jane 's , and we thought she could put in a word , and improve matters for Billy . So Mrs. Fussy was very much de trop , and did n't know it . Jane was sitting with her back to all of us , her feet on the fender , and her skirt turned up over her knees . Oh , there was another one , underneath ; a handsome silk thing , with rows of little frills , which you would think should have gone on outside . But Jane 's best things are never paraded ; always hidden . I do n't mean clothes , now ; but her splendid self . Well little Fussy was ' chatting ' she never talked about herself and her conquests ; quite unconscious that we all wished her at Jericho . Jane went on reading the evening paper ; but she felt the atmosphere growing restive . Presently ah , but I must not tell you the rest . I have just remembered . Jane made us promise never to repeat it . She thought it detrimental to the other woman . But we just had time for our confab ; and Jane caught the evening post with the letter which got Billy off scot - free ; and yet came down punctually to dinner , better dressed than any of them . We felt it rather hard luck to have to promise ; because we had each counted on being the first to tell the story to the duchess . But , you know , you always have to do as Jane says . "
118866	118869	118036	118036	Jane	101	" Why ? "
118870	118901	118972	118973	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Oh , I do n't know ! I ca n't explain why . If you knew her , you would not need to ask . Cake , Miss Gray ? "
118902	118911	118036	118036	Jane	101	" Thank you . Right , this time . "
118912	118960	118972	118973	Nurse Rosemary	228	" There ! That is exactly as Jane would have said : ' Right , this time . ' Is it not strange that after having for weeks thought your voice so like hers , to - morrow I shall be thinking her voice so like yours ? "
118961	118970	118972	118973	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Oh , no , you will not , "
118975	118991	119001	119001	Garth	111	" When she is with you , you will have no thoughts for other people . "
118992	118999	119001	119001	Garth	111	" Indeed , but I shall ! "
119003	119033	119034	119034	he	111	" And , dear little Rosemary , I shall miss you , horribly . No one not even she can take your place . And , do you know , "
119049	119088	119219	119219	Garth	111	" I am beginning to feel anxious about it . She has not seen me since the accident . I am afraid it will give her a shock . Do you think she will find me much changed ? "
119211	119217	119237	119238	Nurse Rosemary	228	" Is it very bad ? "
119226	119235	119237	119238	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I can not answer for another woman , "
119240	119259	119304	119304	he	111	" but I should think your face , just as it is , will always be her joy . "
119289	119303	119304	119304	he	111	" But then , she will not be accustomed to my blind ways , "
119307	119481	119505	119505	she	228	" I am afraid I shall seem so helpless and so blundering . She has not been in Sightless Land , as you and I have been . She does not know all our plans of cords , and notches , and things . Ah , little Rosemary ! Promise not to leave me to - morrow . I want Her only God , knows how I want her ; but I begin to be half afraid . It will be so wonderful , for the great essentials ; but , for the little every - day happenings , which are so magnified by the darkness , oh , my kind unseen guide , how I shall need you . At first , I thought it lucky you had settled to go , just when she is coming ; but now , just because she is coming , I can not let you go . Having her will be wonderful beyond words ; but it will not be the same as having you . "
119510	119599	119609	119609	Garth	111	" Do n't excite yourself over it , Mr. Dalmain . Believe me , when you have been with her for five minutes , you will find it just the same as having me . And how do you know she has not also been in Sightless Land ? A nurse would do that sort of thing , because she was very keen on her profession , and on making a success of her case . The woman who loves you would do it for love of you . "
119600	119607	119505	119505	she	228	" It would be like her , "
119625	119640	119656	119656	she	228	" Oh , Jane ! Jane ! She is coming ! She is coming ! "
119648	119655	119656	119656	she	228	" Yes ; she is coming , "
119670	119752	119759	119759	Garth	111	" And , as it is our last evening together under quite the same circumstances as during all these weeks , will you agree to a plan of mine ? I must go upstairs now , and do some packing , and make a few arrangements . But will you dress early ? I will do the same ; and if you could be down in the library by half - past six , we might have some music before dinner . "
119753	119757	119759	119759	Garth	111	" Why certainly , "
119761	119797	119808	119809	Nurse Rosemary	228	" It makes no difference to me at what time I dress ; and I am always ready for music . But , I say : I wish you were not packing , Miss Gray . "
119798	119806	119808	119809	Nurse Rosemary	228	" I am not exactly packing up , "
119811	119818	119759	119759	Garth	111	" I am packing things away . "
119819	119842	119808	119809	Nurse Rosemary	228	" It is all the same , if it means leaving . But you have promised not to go until she comes ? "
119843	119852	119759	119759	Garth	111	" I will not go until she comes . "
119853	119867	119808	119809	Nurse Rosemary	228	" And you will tell her all the things she ought to know ? "
119868	119883	119759	119759	Garth	111	" She shall know all I know , which could add to your comfort . "
119884	119903	119918	119919	Nurse Rosemary	228	" And you will not leave me , until I am really well , getting on all right ? "
119904	119916	119960	119960	he	111	" I will never leave you , while you need me , "
119946	119959	119967	119967	he	111	" Do you know , you are no end of a brick , "
119975	119996	120063	120063	she	228	" Put your hands in mine just for once , little Rosemary . I want to try to thank you . "
120058	120062	120063	120063	she	228	" This evening , "
120068	120162	120173	120173	Garth	111	" after the music , we will shake hands . Now be careful , sir . You are stranded . Wait . Here is the garden - cord , just to your left . Take a little air on the terrace ; and sing again the lovely song I heard under my window this morning . And now that you know what it is that is ' going to happen , ' this exquisite May - Day evening will fill you with tender expectation . Good - bye , sir for an hour . "
120163	120171	120173	120173	Garth	111	" What has come to little Rosemary ? "
120189	120213	120241	120241	he	111	" We could not have gone on indefinitely quite as we have been , since she came in from the post - office . "
120237	120240	120241	120241	he	111	" Duffer ! "
120244	120361	120463	120463	Jane	101	" Oh , what a conceited duffer ! She is thinking of her ' young man . ' She is going to him to - morrow ; and her mind is full of him ; just as mine is full of Jane . Dear , good , clever , little Rosemary ! I hope he is worthy of her . No ; that he can not be . I hope he knows he is NOT worthy of her . That is more to the point . I hope he will receive her as she expects . Somehow , I hate letting her go to him . Oh , hang the fellow ! as Tommy would say . "
120458	120461	120463	120463	Jane	101	" Simpson , "
120465	120593	120603	120603	Simpson	127	" my aunt , the Duchess of Meldrum , and her maid , and her footman , and a rather large quantity of luggage , will be arriving from Aberdeen , at about half - past seven . Mrs. Graem knows about preparing rooms ; and I have given James orders for meeting the train with the brougham , and the luggage - cart . The duchess dislikes motors . When her Grace arrives , you can show her into the library . We will dine in the dining - room at a quarter past eight . Meanwhile , Mr. Dalmain and myself are particularly engaged just now , and must not be disturbed on any account , until the duchess 's arrival . You quite understand ? "
120594	120601	120650	120650	she	101	" Yes , miss - m'lady , "
120639	120649	120687	120687	he	111	" ' Miss ' is quite sufficient , Simpson , "
120680	120686	120687	120687	he	111	" Hullo , Miss Gray , "
120690	120695	120701	120701	Jane	101	" Packed your uniform ? "
120696	120699	120701	120701	Jane	101	" Yes , "
120703	120711	120818	120818	she	101	" I told you I was packing . "
120809	120817	120826	120826	Garth	111	" I did not hear the song , "
120821	120824	120826	120826	Garth	111	" No , "
120828	120870	120877	120877	Jane	101	" At first , I forgot . And when I remembered , I had been thinking of other things , and somehow ah , Miss Gray ! I can not sing to - night . My soul is dumb with longing . "
120871	120875	120877	120877	Jane	101	" I know , "
120881	120891	120908	120908	he	111	" and I am going to sing to you . "
120902	120907	120908	120908	he	111	" Do you sing ? "
120911	120920	120928	120928	Jane	101	" Then why have you not sung before ? "
120921	120926	120928	120928	Jane	101	" When I arrived , "
120930	120990	121003	121003	he	111	" Dr. Rob asked me whether I played . I said : ' A little . ' Thereupon he concluded I sang a little , too ; and he forbade me , most peremptorily , either to play a little ; or sing a little , to you . He said he did not want you driven altogether mad . "
120996	121002	121003	121003	he	111	" How like old Robbie , "
121006	121037	121043	121043	Jane	101	" And , in spite of his injunctions , are you going to take the risk , and ' sing a little , ' to me , to - night ? "
121038	121041	121043	121043	Jane	101	" No , "
121045	121097	121188	121188	she	101	" I take no risks . I am going to sing you one song . Here is the purple cord , at your right hand . There is nothing between you and the piano ; and you are facing towards it . If you want to stop me you can come . "
121216	121255	121363	121363	he	111	" The hours I spent with thee , dear heart , Are as a string of pearls to me ; I count them over , ev'ry one apart , My rosary , my rosary . Each hour a pearl "
121359	121362	121363	121363	he	111	" You ? "
121366	121374	121399	121399	Jane	101	" YOU ? You all the time ? "
121388	121397	121399	121399	Jane	101	" Oh , my boy , my darling ! "
121409	121506	121570	121570	Jane	101	" Yes ; I , all the time ; all the time near him , in his loss and pain . Could I have stopped away ? But , oh , Garth ! What it is , at last to hold you , and touch you , and feel you here ! ... Yes , it is I. Oh , my beloved , are you not quite sure ? Who else could hold you thus ? ... Take care , my darling ! Come over to the couch , just here ; and sit beside me . "
121561	121568	121794	121794	Jane	101	" Ah , darling , darling , "
121590	121793	121816	121816	Jane	101	" it has been so sweet to wait upon my boy ; and help him in his darkness ; and shield him from unnecessary pain ; and be always there , to meet his every need . But I could not come myself until he knew ; and understood ; and had forgiven no , not ' forgiven ' ; understood , and yet still LOVED . For he does now understand ? And he does forgive ? ... Oh , Garth ! ... Oh hush , my darling ! ... You frighten me ! ... No , I will never leave you ; never , never ! ... Oh , ca n't you understand , my beloved ? ... Then I must tell you more plainly . Darling , do be still , and listen . Just for a few days we must be as we have been ; only my boy will know it is I who am near him . Aunt ' Gina is coming this evening . She will be here in half an hour . Then , as soon as possible we will get a special license ; and we will be married , Garth ; and then "
121810	121814	121816	121816	Jane	101	" and then , "
121835	121855	121816	121816	Jane	101	" then it will be my highest joy , to be always with my husband , night and day . "
121882	121887	121910	121910	he	111	" Peace , be still "
121903	121909	121898	121898	Garth	111	" Always ? Always together ? "
121913	121924	121926	121926	Simpson	127	" Ah , that will be ' perpetual light ! ' "
121941	121950	121997	121997	She	101	" Her Grace , the Duchess of Meldrum , "
122008	122041	122048	122048	Garth	111	" Goodness gracious , my dear Dal ! How you surprise me ! I expected to find you blind ! And here you are striding about , just your old handsome self ! "
122042	122046	122048	122048	Garth	111	" Dear Duchess , "
122062	122097	121997	121997	She	101	" I can not see you , I am sorry to say ; but I do n't feel very blind to - night . My darkness has been lightened by a joy beyond expression . "
122098	122171	122196	122196	she	101	" Oh ho ! So that 's the way the land lies ! Now which are you going to marry ? The nurse , who , I gather , is a most respectable young person , and highly recommended ; or that hussy , Jane ; who , without the smallest compunction , orders her poor aunt from one end of the kingdom to the other , to suit her own convenience ? "
122189	122195	122196	122196	she	101	" Dear Aunt ' Gina , "
122199	122264	122300	122300	she	304	" you know you loved coming ; because you enjoy a mystery , and like being a dear old ' deus ex machina , ' at the right moment . And he is going to marry them both ; because they both love him far too dearly ever to leave him again ; and he seems to think he can not do without either . "

Well , we always thought one girl would not do for Dal ; he would need the combined perfections of several ; and he appears to think he has found them . God bless you both , you absurdly happy people ; and I will bless you , too ; but not until I have dined . Now , ring for that very nervous person , with side - whiskers ; and tell him I want my maid , and my room , and I want to know where they have put my toucan . I had to bring him , Jane . He is so LOVING , dear bird ! I knew you would think him in the way ; but I really could not leave him behind . "

122673	122687	122706	122706	Jane	101	" Then in what do you intend to be married , unnatural girl ? "
122692	122704	122747	122747	her	101	" In whatever I happen to put on , that morning , "

122769	122784	122786	122786	Jane	101	" We can always send to the station , at a moment 's notice , "
122799	122820	122836	122837	the duchess	304	" But where are you going , dear Aunt ' Gina ? You know Deryck and Flower arrive this evening . "
122821	122834	122851	122851	Jane	101	" I am washing my hands of you , and going South , "
122841	122849	122851	122851	Jane	101	" Do n't do that , dear , "
122855	122897	122851	122851	Jane	101	" You have washed your hands of me so often ; and , like the blood of King Duncan of Scotland , I am upon them still . ' All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand . ' "
122904	122931	122942	122942	Garth	111	" Garth , if you want to walk , just give a call . I am here , talking over my trousseau with Aunt ' Gina . "
122932	122938	122959	122959	Jane	101	" What is a trousseau ? "
122947	122957	122972	122972	Garth	111	" A thing you get into to be married , "
122961	122970	122983	122983	Jane	101	" Then let 's get into it quickly , "

122985	123038	123340	123340	she	147	" let us make a compromise . I have some quite nice clothes upstairs , including Redfern tailor - mades , and several uniforms .

124844	124853	124855	124855	Garth	111	" Not in Sightless Land , my beloved , "
124857	124897	125098	125098	He	111	" but in the Land where they need no candle neither light of the sun . However , and wherever , I take YOU as my wife , I shall be standing on the summit of God 's heaven . "
125103	125107	125123	125123	he	111	" My wife . "

125126	125156	125173	125173	she	101	" how soon will they all go ? How soon shall we be quite alone ? Oh , why could n't they drive to the station from the church ? "
125163	125172	125173	125173	she	101	" Because we must lunch them , dear , "
125176	125234	125249	125249	Garth	111	" Think how good they have all been . And we could not start our married life by being inhospitable . It is just one o'clock ; and we ordered luncheon at half - past . Their train leaves the station at half - past four . In three hours , Garth , we shall be alone . "
125235	125247	125259	125259	Jane	101	" Shall I be able to behave nicely for three hours ? "
125253	125257	125259	125259	Jane	101	" You must , "
125261	125269	125275	125275	he	111	" or I shall fetch Nurse Rosemary . "
125270	125274	125294	125294	he	111	" Oh hush ! "
125278	125293	125300	125300	his	111	" All that is too precious , to - day , for chaff . Jane "
125304	125318	125355	125355	she	101	" Jane ! Do you understand that you are now actually my wife ? "
125350	125354	125355	125355	she	101	" My darling , "
125358	125380	125575	125575	Garth	111	" I do not understand it . But I know ah , thank God ! I know it to be true . "
125599	125610	125575	125575	Garth	111	" I can not let her out of my sight , "
125616	125627	126002	126002	Garth	111	" I can not let her be beyond my touch . "
125701	125709	125731	125731	Jane	101	" Sweet , sweet , sweet thrill , "
125724	125729	125731	125731	Jane	101	" Oh , darling , "
125733	126001	126034	126034	he	111	" that reminds me ; there is something I do so want you to sing to me . I do n't know what it is ; but I think you will remember . It was on that Monday evening , after I had seen the pictures , and Nurse Rosemary had described them to you . Both our poor hearts were on the rack ; and I went up early in order to begin my letter of confession ; but you told Simpson not to come for you until eleven . While I was writing in the room above , I could hear you playing in the library . You played many things I knew music we had done together , long ago . And then a theme I had never heard crept in , and caught my ear at once , because it was quite new to me , and so marvellously sweet . I put down my pen and listened . You played it several times , with slight variations , as if trying to recall it . And then , to my joy , you began to sing . I crossed the room ; softly opened my window , and leaned out . I could hear some of the words ; but not all . Two lines , however , reached me distinctly , with such penetrating , tender sadness , that I laid my head against the window - frame , feeling as if I could write no more , and wait no longer , but must go straight to you at once . "
126026	126033	126002	126002	Garth	111	" What were they , Jane ? "
126037	126056	126002	126002	Garth	111	" ' Lead us , O Christ , when all is gone , Safe home at last . ' "
126057	126129	126002	126002	Garth	111	" And oh , my darling , the pathos of those words , ' when all is gone ' ! Whoever wrote that music , had been through suffering such as ours . Then came a theme of such inspiring hopefulness and joy , that I arose , armed with fresh courage ; took up my pen , and went on with my letter . Again two lines had reached me : "
126130	126146	126002	126002	Garth	111	" ' Where Thou , Eternal Light of Light , Art Lord of All . ' "
126147	126196	126407	126407	So	301	" What is it , Garth ? And whose ? And where did you hear it ? And will you sing it to me now , darling ? I have a sudden wish that you should sing it , here and now ; and I ca n't wait ! "
126217	126406	126451	126451	he	2024	" Jane ! I like to hear you say you ca n't wait . It is n't like you ; because you are so strong and patient . And yet it is so deliciously like you , if you FEEL it , to SAY it . I found the words in the Anthem - book at Worcester Cathedral , this time last year , at even - song . I copied them into my pocket - book , during the reading of the first lesson , I am ashamed to say ; but it was all about what Balak said unto Balaam , and Balaam said unto Balak , so I hope I may be forgiven ! They seemed to me some of the most beautiful words I had ever read ; and , fortunately , I committed them to memory . Of course , I will sing them to you , if you wish , here and now . But I am afraid the air will sound rather poor without the accompaniment . However , not for worlds would I move from here , at this moment . "
126471	126497	126518	126518	Christ	298	" The radiant morn hath passed away , And spent too soon her golden store ; The shadows of departing day Creep on once more . "
126530	126558	126602	126602	she	1166	" Where saints are clothed in spotless white , And evening shadows never fall ; where Thou , Eternal Light of Light , Art Lord of All . "
126598	126601	126602	126602	she	1166	" Beautiful ! "
126605	126651	126662	126662	Garth	111	" Beautiful ! Garthie perhaps it is because YOU sang it ; and to - night ; but it seems to me the most beautiful thing I ever heard . Ah , and how appropriate for us ; on this day , of all days . "
126652	126660	126674	126674	his	111	" Oh , I do n't know , "
126682	126712	126730	126730	she	101	" I certainly feel ' Safe home at last ' not because ' all is gone ' ; but because I HAVE all , in having you , Jane . "
126724	126729	126730	126730	she	101	" My own boy , "
126733	126855	126895	126895	he	111	" you have all I have to give all , ALL . But , darling , in those dark days which are past , all seemed gone , for us both . ' Lead us , O Christ ' It was He who led us safely through the darkness , and has brought us to this . And Garth , I love to know that He is Lord of All Lord of our joy ; Lord of our love ; Lord of our lives our wedded lives , my husband . We could not be so safely , so blissfully , each other 's , were we not ONE , IN HIM . Is this true for you also , Garth ? "
126888	126894	126895	126895	he	111	" Yes , my wife , "
126898	126925	126932	126932	Jane	101	" I thank God , that I can say in all things : ' Thou , Eternal Light of Light , art Lord of All . ' "
126937	126961	126985	126985	he	111	" Oh , but the music , Garthie ! That exquisite setting . Whose is it ? And where did you hear it ? "
126974	126984	126985	126985	he	111	" I am glad you like it , Jane , "
126988	127137	127166	127166	he	111	" because I must plead guilty to the fact that it is my own . You see , I knew no music for it ; the Anthem - book gave the words only . And on that awful night , when little Rosemary had mercilessly rubbed it in , about ' the lady portrayed ' ; and what her love MUST have been , and WOULD have been , and COULD have been ; and had made me SEE ' The Wife ' again , and ' The ' the other picture ; I felt so bruised , and sore , and lonely . And then those words came to my mind : ' Lead us , O Christ , when all is gone , safe home at last . ' All seemed gone indeed ; and there seemed no home to hope for , in this world . "
127159	127165	127184	127184	he	111	" Safe home at last , "
127194	127222	127184	127184	he	111	" So those words came back to me ; and to get away from despairing thoughts , I began reciting them , to an accompaniment of chords . "
127223	127246	127184	127184	he	111	" ' The radiant morn hath passed away , And spent too soon her golden store ; The shadows of departing day ' "
127247	127507	127534	127534	he	2031	" And then suddenly , Jane I SAW it , pictured in sound ! Just as I used to SEE a sunset , in light and shadow , and then transfer it to my canvas in shade and colour,-so I heard a SUNSET in harmony , and I felt the same kind of tingle in my fingers as I used to feel when inspiration came , and I could catch up my brushes and palette . So I played the sunset . And then I got the theme for life fading , and what one feels when the glorious noon is suddenly plunged into darkness ; and then the prayer . And then , I HEARD a vision of heaven , where evening shadows never fall : And after that came the end ; just certainty , and worship , and peace . You see the eventual theme , worked out of all this . It was like making studies for a picture . That was why you heard it over and over . I was n't trying to remember . I was gathering it into final form . I am awfully glad you like it , Jane ; because if I show you how the harmonies go , perhaps you could write it down . And it would mean such a lot to me , if you thought it worth singing . I could play the accompaniment Hullo ! Is it beginning to rain ? I felt a drop on my cheek , and another on my hand . "
127544	127584	127779	127779	his	111	" Jane ! Why , what is the matter ; Sweet ? What on earth ? Have I said anything to trouble you ? Jane , what is it ? O God , why ca n't I see her ! "
127606	127772	127800	127800	he	111	" Hush , darling , hush ! It is only a great joy a wonderful surprise . Lean against me again , and I will try to tell you . Do you know that you have composed some of the most beautiful music in the world ? Do you know , my own boy , that not only your proud and happy wife , but ALL women who can sing , will want to sing your music ? Garthie , do you realise what it means ? The creative faculty is so strong in you , that when one outlet was denied it , it burst forth through another . When you had your sight , you created by the hand and EYE . Now , you will create by the hand and EAR . The power is the same . It merely works through another channel . But oh , think what it means ! Think ! The world lies before you once more ! "
127792	127799	127800	127800	he	111	" Oh , bother the world ! "
127803	127817	127905	127905	she	101	" I do n't want the world . I only want my wife . "
127898	127904	127905	127905	she	101	" I know , darling , "
127908	128022	128040	128040	he	111	" And you have her . She is just ALL YOURS . But think of the wonderful future . Thank God , I know enough of the technical part , to write the scores of your compositions . And , Garth , fancy going together to noble cathedrals , and hearing your anthems sung ; and to concerts where the most perfect voices in the world will be doing their utmost adequately to render your songs . Fancy thrilling hearts with pure harmony , stirring souls with tone - pictures ; just as before you used to awaken in us all , by your wonderful paintings , an appreciation and comprehension of beauty . "
128028	128039	128048	128048	Jane	101	" Is it really as good as that , Jane ? "
128043	128046	128048	128048	Jane	101	" Dear , "
128052	128094	128102	128102	Garth	111	" I can only tell you , that when you sang it first , and I had not the faintest idea it was yours , I said to myself : ' It is the most beautiful thing I ever heard . ' "
128095	128100	128102	128102	Garth	111	" I am glad , "
128106	128147	128048	128048	Jane	101	" And now , let 's talk of something else . Oh , I say , Jane ! The present is too wonderful , to leave any possible room for thoughts about the future . Do talk about the present . "
128157	128160	128171	128171	She	101	" The Wife "
128184	128204	128171	128171	She	101	" Yes , darling . We will talk of this very moment , if you wish . You begin . "
128205	128225	128171	128171	She	101	" Look at the house , and describe it to me , as you see it in the moonlight . "
128226	128246	128171	128171	She	101	" Very grey , and calm , and restful - looking . And so home - like , Garthie . "
128247	128255	128171	128171	She	101	" Are there lights in the windows ? "
128256	128322	128171	128171	She	101	" Yes . The library lights are just as we left them . The French window is standing wide open . The pedestal lamp , under a crimson silk shade , looks very pretty from here , shedding a warm glow over the interior . Then , I can see one candle in the dining - room . I think Simpson is putting away silver . "
128323	128329	128171	128171	She	101	" Any others , Jane ? "
128330	128429	128441	128441	Garth	111	" Yes , darling . There is a light in the Oriel chamber . I can see Margery moving to and fro . She seems to be arranging my things , and giving final touches . There is also a light in your room , next door . Ah , now she has gone through . I see her standing and looking round to make sure all is right . Dear faithful old heart ! Garth , how sweet it is to be at home to - day ; served and tended by those who really love us . "
128430	128439	128441	128441	Garth	111	" I am so glad you feel that , "
128443	128490	128171	128171	She	101	" I half feared you might regret not having an ordinary honeymoon And yet , no ! I was n't really afraid of that , or of anything . Just , together at last , was all we wanted . Was n't it , my wife ? "
128491	128494	128510	128510	Garth	111	" All . "
128503	128508	128510	128510	Garth	111	" Dear old clock , "
128514	128614	128171	128171	She	101	" I used to hear it strike nine , when I was a little chap in my crib , trying to keep awake until my mother rustled past ; and went into her room . The door between her room and mine used to stand ajar , and I could see her candle appear in a long streak upon my ceiling . When I saw that streak , I fell asleep immediately . It was such a comfort to know she was there ; and would not go down again . Jane , do you like the Oriel chamber ? "
128615	128702	128710	128710	Garth	111	" Yes , dear . It is a lovely room ; and very sacred because it was hers . Do you know , Aunt Georgina insisted upon seeing it , Garth ; and said it ought to be whitened and papered . But I would not hear of that ; because the beautiful old ceiling is hand - painted , and so are the walls ; and I was certain you had loved those paintings , as a little boy ; and would remember them now . "
128703	128708	128710	128710	Garth	111	" Ah , yes , "
128714	128803	128810	128810	Jane	101	" A French artist stayed here , and did them . Water and rushes , and the most lovely flamingoes ; those on the walls standing with their feet in the water ; and those on the ceiling , flying with wings outspread , into a pale green sky , all over white billowy clouds . Jane , I believe I could walk round that room , blindfold no ! I mean , as I am now ; and point out the exact spot where each flamingo stands . "
128804	128808	128171	128171	She	101	" You shall , "
128830	128870	128880	128880	Garth	111	" By degrees you must tell me all the things you specially did and loved , as a little boy . I like to know them . Had you always that room , next door to your mother 's ? "
128871	128878	128880	128880	Garth	111	" Ever since I can remember , "
128882	129092	129151	129151	he	111	" And the door between was always open . After my mother 's death , I kept it locked . But the night before my birthday , I used to open it ; and when I woke early and saw it ajar , I would spring up , and go quickly in ; and it seemed as if her dear presence was there to greet me , just on that one morning . But I had to go quickly , and immediately I wakened ; just as you must go out early to catch the rosy glow of sunrise on the fleeting clouds ; or to see the gossamer webs on the gorse , outlined in diamonds , by the sparkling summer dew . But , somehow , Margery found out about it ; and the third year there was a sheet of writing - paper firmly stuck to the pincushion by a large black - headed pin , saying , in Margery 's careful caligraphy : ' Many happy returns of the day , Master Garthie . ' It was very touching , because it was meant to be so comforting and tactful . But it destroyed the illusion ! Since then the door has been kept closed . "
129133	129150	129201	129201	she	101	" You said Margery had ' gone through . ' Is it open to - night ? "
129193	129200	129201	129201	she	101	" Yes , my own boy , "
129204	129208	129216	129216	He	111	" it is . "
129209	129215	129249	129249	she	101	" Jane ! Oh , Jane "
129243	129248	129249	129249	she	101	" Ah , darling , "
129252	129302	129393	129393	he	111	" take me away from this horrible white moonlight ! I can not bear it . It reminds me of Shenstone . It reminds me of the wrong I did you . It seems a separating thing between you and me this cruel brightness which you can not share . "
129386	129392	129393	129393	he	111	" Hush , sweetest wife , "
129396	129620	129626	129626	Jane	101	" Neither light nor darkness can separate between you and me : This quiet moonlight can not take you from me ; but in the still , sweet darkness you will feel more completely my own , because it will hold nothing we can not share . Come with me to the library , and we will send away the lamps , and close the curtains ; and you shall sit on the couch near the piano , where you sat , on that wonderful evening when I found you , and when I almost frightened my brave Jane . But she will not be frightened now , because she is so my own ; and I may say what I like ; and do what I will ; and she must not threaten me with Nurse Rosemary ; because it is Jane I want Jane , Jane ; just ONLY Jane ! Come in , beloved ; and I , who see as clearly in the dark as in the light , will sit and play THE ROSARY for you ; and then Veni , Creator Spiritus ; and I will sing you the verse which has been the secret source of peace , and the sustaining power of my whole inner life , through the long , hard years , apart . "
129621	129624	129626	129626	Jane	101	" Now , "
129628	129635	129637	129637	Garth	111	" Now , as we go . "
129654	129700	None	None	None	None	" Enable with perpetual light , The dulness of our blinded sight ; Anoint and cheer our soiled face With the abundance of Thy grace . Keep far our foes ; give peace at home ; Where Thou art Guide , no ill can come . "
