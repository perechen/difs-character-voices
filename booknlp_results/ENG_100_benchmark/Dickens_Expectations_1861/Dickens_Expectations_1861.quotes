You do it , and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me , or any person sumever , and you shall be let to live . You fail , or you go from my words in any partickler , no matter how small it is , and your heart and your liver shall be tore out , roasted , and ate . Now , I ai n't alone , as you may think I am . There 's a young man hid with me , in comparison with which young man I am a Angel . That young man hears the words I speak . That young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself , of getting at a boy , and at his heart , and at his liver . It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man . A boy may lock his door , may be warm in bed , may tuck himself up , may draw the clothes over his head , may think himself comfortable and safe , but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open . I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment , with great difficulty . I find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside . Now , what do you say ? "
1749	1760	1762	1763	the man	433	" Say Lord strike you dead if you do n't ! "
1775	1778	1779	1779	he	433	" Now , "

2914	2934	2912	2912	Joe	154	" I always treated him as a larger species of child , and as no more than my equal . "

3093	3135	3090	3090	her	154	" Tell me directly what you 've been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit , or I 'd have you out of that corner if you was fifty Pips , and he was five hundred Gargerys . "
3136	3145	3147	3147	I	0	" I have only been to the churchyard , "
3158	3161	3163	3164	my sister	402	" Churchyard ! "
3166	3193	3163	3164	my sister	402	" If it warn't for me you 'd have been to the churchyard long ago , and stayed there . Who brought you up by hand ? "
3194	3198	3200	3200	I.	0	" You did , "
3201	3215	3217	3218	my sister	402	" And why did I do it , I should like to know ? "
3223	3229	3220	3220	I	0	" I do n't know . "
3230	3235	3237	3238	my sister	402	" I do n't ! "
3240	3289	3237	3238	my sister	402	" I 'd never do it again ! I know that . I may truly say I 've never had this apron of mine off since born you were . It 's bad enough to be a blacksmith 's wife and him a Gargery without being your mother . "
3351	3354	3356	3357	Mrs. Joe	154	" Hah ! "
3365	3379	3356	3357	Mrs. Joe	154	" Churchyard , indeed ! You may well say churchyard , you two . "
3395	3427	3429	3429	she	154	" You 'll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you , one of these days , and O , a pr - r - recious pair you 'd be without me ! "
4127	4134	4136	4136	she	402	" What 's the matter now ? "
4147	4154	4156	4156	Joe	154	" I say , you know ! "
4168	4195	4159	4159	his	507	" Pip , old chap ! You 'll do yourself a mischief . It 'll stick somewhere . You ca n't have chawed it , Pip . "
4196	4203	4205	4206	my sister	402	" What 's the matter now ? "
4213	4234	4236	4236	Joe	154	" If you can cough any trifle on it up , Pip , I 'd recommend you to do it , "
4241	4254	4236	4236	Joe	154	" Manners is manners , but still your elth 's your elth . "
4304	4316	4318	4319	my sister	402	" Now , perhaps you 'll mention what 's the matter , "
4325	4332	4318	4319	my sister	402	" you staring great stuck pig . "
4354	4360	4362	4362	Joe	154	" You know , Pip , "
4389	4415	4416	4416	he	521	" you and me is always friends , and I 'd be the last to tell upon you , any time . But such a - "
4443	4444	4451	4451	he	521	" "
4453	4458	4451	4451	he	521	" cried my sister . "
4465	4487	4451	4451	he	521	" said Joe , looking at me , and not at Mrs. Joe , with his bite still in his cheek , "
4535	4560	4561	4561	You	0	" My sister made a dive at me , and fished me up by the hair , saying nothing more than the awful words , "
4568	4721	4561	4561	You	0	" Some medical beast had revived Tar - water in those days as a fine medicine , and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard ; having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness . At the best of times , so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice restorative , that I was conscious of going about , smelling like a new fence . On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture , which was poured down my throat , for my greater comfort , while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm , as a boot would be held in a bootjack . Joe got off with half a pint ; but was made to swallow that much to his disturbance , as he sat slowly munching and meditating before the fire , "
4729	5109	4723	4723	he	529	" Judging from myself , I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards , if he had had none before . Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy ; but when , in the case of a boy , that secret burden co - operates with another secret burden down the leg of his trousers , it is as I can testify a great punishment . The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe - I never thought I was going to rob Joe , for I never thought of any of the housekeeping property as his - united to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter as I sat , or when I was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand , almost drove me out of my mind . Then , as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare , I thought I heard the voice outside , of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to secrecy , declaring that he could n't and would n't starve until to - morrow , but must be fed now . At other times , I thought , What if the young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience , or should mistake the time , and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to - night , instead of to - morrow ! If ever anybody 's hair stood on end with terror , mine must have done so then . But , perhaps , nobody 's ever did ? It was Christmas Eve , and I had to stir the pudding for next day , with a copper - stick , from seven to eight by the Dutch clock . I tried it with the load upon my leg and that made me think afresh of the man with the load on his leg , and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at my ankle , quite unmanageable . Happily I slipped away , and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom . "
5112	5140	4723	4723	he	529	" said I , when I had done my stirring , and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed ; "
5148	5149	5146	5146	Joe	154	" "
5152	5156	5146	5146	Joe	154	" said Joe . "
5163	5164	5170	5170	Joe	154	" "
5172	5189	5170	5170	Joe	154	" said I. Mrs. Joe , who always took explanations upon herself , said , snappishly , "
5194	5227	5287	5287	they	531	" Administering the definition like Tar - water . While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework , I put my mouth into the forms of saying to Joe , "
5233	5261	5262	5262	Pip	241	" Joe put his mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer , that I could make out nothing of it but the single word "
5264	5265	5262	5262	Pip	241	" "
5274	5280	5287	5287	they	531	" said Joe , aloud , "
5304	5305	5297	5297	they	531	" "
5310	5313	5314	5314	Drat	165	" said I. "
5318	5330	5314	5314	Drat	165	" interposed my sister , frowning at me over her work , "
5349	5426	5314	5314	Drat	165	" It was not very polite to herself , I thought , to imply that I should be told lies by her even if I did ask questions . But she never was polite unless there was company . At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his mouth very wide , and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like ' sulks . "

5593	5601	5603	5603	I.	0	" And please , what 's Hulks ? "
5604	5613	5629	5629	her	402	" That 's the way with this boy ! "
5634	5662	5629	5629	her	402	" Answer him one question , and he 'll ask you a dozen directly . Hulks are prison - ships , right ' cross th ' meshes . "
5675	5693	5695	5695	I	0	" I wonder who 's put into prison - ships , and why they 're put there ? "
5719	5728	5730	5730	she	154	" I tell you what , young fellow , "
5732	5803	5730	5730	she	154	" I did n't bring you up by hand to badger people 's lives out . It would be blame to me and not praise , if I had . People are put in the Hulks because they murder , and because they rob , and forge , and do all sorts of bad ; and they always begin by asking questions . Now , you get along to bed ! "
6211	6215	6243	6243	I	0	" Stop thief ! "

7690	7730	7731	7731	He	578	" I 'd do that , if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is over there , directly afterwards . I 'll beat the shivers so far , I 'll bet you . "
7807	7822	7801	7801	he	578	" You 're not a deceiving imp ? You brought no one with you ? "
7823	7830	7921	7921	he	578	" No , sir ! No ! "

8439	8451	8437	8437	himself	433	" I wonder you should n't have been sure of that , "
8455	8477	8437	8437	himself	433	" for we heard it up at home , and that 's farther away , and we were shut in besides . "
8478	8484	8486	8486	he	433	" Why , see now ! "
8488	8650	8652	8652	he	433	" When a man 's alone on these flats , with a light head and a light stomach , perishing of cold and want , he hears nothin' all night , but guns firing , and voices calling . Hears ? He sees the soldiers , with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore , closing in round him . Hears his number called , hears himself challenged , hears the rattle of the muskets , hears the orders ' Make ready ! Present ! Cover him steady , men ! ' and is laid hands on - and there 's nothin' ! Why , if I see one pursuing party last night - coming up in order , Damn 'em , with their tramp , tramp - I see a hundred . And as to firing ! Why , I see the mist shake with the cannon , arter it was broad day , - But this man "
8668	8676	8652	8652	he	433	" did you notice anything in him ? "
8677	8685	8687	8687	I	0	" He had a badly bruised face , "

8747	8782	8783	8783	I	0	" Show me the way he went . I 'll pull him down , like a bloodhound . Curse this iron on my sore leg ! Give us hold of the file , boy . "

9120	9125	9127	9128	Mrs. Joe	154	" Ah ! well ! "
9130	9138	9127	9128	Mrs. Joe	154	" You might ha ' done worse . "

9185	9208	9182	9183	Mrs. Joe	154	" I 'm rather partial to Carols , myself , and that 's the best of reasons for my never hearing any . "
9385	9391	9393	9394	Mrs. Joe	154	" for I ai n't , "
9397	9427	9393	9394	Mrs. Joe	154	" I ai n't a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now , with what I 've got before me , I promise you ! "

10405	10409	10411	10412	Uncle Pumblechook	172	" Mrs. Joe , "
10466	10505	10447	10447	he	172	" I have brought you as the compliments of the season - I have brought you , Mum , a bottle of sherry wine - and I have brought you , Mum , a bottle of port wine . "
10547	10563	10543	10543	she	154	" O , Un - cle Pum - ble - chook ! This is kind ! "
10576	10599	10572	10572	he	172	" It 's no more than your merits . And now are you all bobbish , and how 's Sixpennorth of halfpence ? "
11038	11047	11026	11026	her	402	" Do you hear that ? Be grateful . "
11048	11051	11053	11054	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" Especially , "
11056	11071	11053	11054	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" be grateful , boy , to them which brought you up by hand . "
11095	11106	11075	11075	her	171	" Why is it that the young are never grateful ? "
11125	11129	11117	11118	Mr. Hubble	170	" Naterally wicious . "
11133	11136	11130	11130	Everybody	678	" True ! "
11259	11262	11284	11284	he	169	" thrown open "
11315	11319	11306	11306	he	169	" going about . "
11320	11324	11326	11327	Uncle Pumblechook	172	" True again , "
11329	11382	11326	11327	Uncle Pumblechook	172	" You 've hit it , sir ! Plenty of subjects going about , for them that know how to put salt upon their tails . That 's what 's wanted . A man need n't go far to find a subject , if he 's ready with his salt - box . "
11394	11415	11383	11384	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" Look at Pork alone . There 's a subject ! If you want a subject , look at Pork ! "
11416	11428	11430	11431	Mr. Wopsle	169	" True , sir . Many a moral for the young , "
11450	11458	11437	11437	he	169	" might be deduced from that text . "
11459	11465	11467	11468	my sister	402	" You listen to this , "
11484	11487	11489	11490	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Swine , "
11540	11562	11527	11527	Swine	178	" I thought this pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy . "
11576	11577	11579	11579	girl	687	" "
11581	11586	11579	11579	girl	687	" suggested Mr. Hubble . "
11596	11604	11593	11594	Mr. Hubble	170	" assented Mr. Wopsle , rather irritably , "
11612	11613	11608	11610	no girl present	689	" "
11616	11626	11593	11594	Mr. Hubble	170	" said Mr. Pumblechook , turning sharp on me , "
11645	11646	11647	11647	He	690	" "
11656	11671	11647	11647	He	690	" said my sister , most emphatically . Joe gave me some more gravy . "
11683	11688	11677	11681	a four - footed Squeaker	692	" said Mr. Pumblechook . "
11706	11707	11704	11704	you	0	" "
11713	11723	11677	11681	a four - footed Squeaker	692	" said Mr. Wopsle , nodding towards the dish . "
11735	11748	11749	11749	I	0	" returned Mr. Pumblechook , who had an objection to being interrupted ; "
11796	11802	11803	11803	You	0	" turning on me again . "
11898	11912	11913	11913	He	697	" Joe offered me more gravy , which I was afraid to take . "
11924	11933	11913	11913	He	697	" said Mrs. Hubble , commiserating my sister . "
11936	11941	11913	11913	He	697	" echoed my sister ; "
11944	12136	11913	11913	He	697	" and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of , and all the acts of sleeplessness I had committed , and all the high places I had tumbled from , and all the low places I had tumbled into , and all the injuries I had done myself , and all the times she had wished me in my grave , and I had contumaciously refused to go there . I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much , with their noses . Perhaps , they became the restless people they were , in consequence . Anyhow , Mr. Wopsle 's Roman nose so aggravated me , during the recital of my misdemeanours , that I should have liked to pull it until he howled . But , all I had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sister 's recital , and in which pause everybody had looked at me as I felt painfully conscious with indignation and abhorrence . "
12139	12158	11913	11913	He	697	" said Mr. Pumblechook , leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed , "
12174	12175	12181	12181	uncle	658	" "
12183	12503	12181	12181	uncle	658	" said my sister . O Heavens , it had come at last ! He would find it was weak , he would say it was weak , and I was lost ! I held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth , with both hands , and awaited my fate . My sister went for the stone bottle , came back with the stone bottle , and poured his brandy out : no one else taking any . The wretched man trifled with his glass , - took it up , looked at it through the light , put it down , - prolonged my misery . All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding . I could n't keep my eyes off him . Always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet , I saw the miserable creature finger his glass playfully , take it up , smile , throw his head back , and drink the brandy off . Instantly afterwards , the company were seized with unspeakable consternation , owing to his springing to his feet , turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping - cough dance , and rushing out at the door ; he then became visible through the window , violently plunging and expectorating , making the most hideous faces , and apparently out of his mind . I held on tight , while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him . I did n't know how I had done it , but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow . In my dreadful situation , it was a relief when he was brought back , and surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him , sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp , "
12506	12553	12554	12554	Tar	181	" I had filled up the bottle from the tar - water jug . I knew he would be worse by and by . I moved the table , like a Medium of the present day , by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it . "
12556	12564	12554	12554	Tar	181	" cried my sister , in amazement . "
12574	12751	12570	12570	Tar	181	" But , Uncle Pumblechook , who was omnipotent in that kitchen , would n't hear the word , would n't hear of the subject , imperiously waved it all away with his hand , and asked for hot gin and water . My sister , who had begun to be alarmingly meditative , had to employ herself actively in getting the gin the hot water , the sugar , and the lemon - peel , and mixing them . For the time being at least , I was saved . I still held on to the leg of the table , but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude . By degrees , I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding . Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding . All partook of pudding . The course terminated , and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water . I began to think I should get over the day , when my sister said to Joe , "
12758	12808	12570	12570	Tar	181	" I clutched the leg of the table again immediately , and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul . I foresaw what was coming , and I felt that this time I really was gone . "
12813	12826	12827	12827	you	701	" said my sister , addressing the guests with her best grace - "
12846	12858	12859	12859	You	701	" Must they ! Let them not hope to taste it ! "
12863	12870	12859	12859	You	701	" said my sister , rising , "
12881	12913	12859	12859	You	701	" The company murmured their compliments . Uncle Pumblechook , sensible of having deserved well of his fellow - creatures , said , - quite vivaciously , all things considered , - "
12936	12980	12916	12917	Mrs. Joe	154	" My sister went out to get it . I heard her steps proceed to the pantry . I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife . I saw reawakening appetite in the Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle . I heard Mr. Hubble remark that "
13001	13008	13009	13009	You	703	" and I heard Joe say , "
13016	13115	13014	13014	Pip	241	" I have never been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror , merely in spirit , or in the bodily hearing of the company . I felt that I could bear no more , and that I must run away . I released the leg of the table , and ran for my life . But I ran no farther than the house door , for there I ran head - foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets , one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me , saying , "
13126	13188	13192	13192	me	0	" Chapter V The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but - ends of their loaded muskets on our door - step , caused the dinner - party to rise from table in confusion , and caused Mrs. Joe re - entering the kitchen empty - handed , to stop short and stare , in her wondering lament of "
13203	13269	13192	13192	me	0	" The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring ; at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses . It was the sergeant who had spoken to me , and he was now looking round at the company , with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right hand , and his left on my shoulder . "
13277	13282	13192	13192	me	0	" said the sergeant , "
13297	13303	13285	13285	I	0	" which he had n't , "
13322	13323	13317	13317	I	0	" "
13333	13347	13348	13348	Missis	709	" retorted my sister , quick to resent his being wanted at all . "
13350	13389	13348	13348	Missis	709	" returned the gallant sergeant , ' speaking for myself , I should reply , the honor and pleasure of his fine wife 's acquaintance ; speaking for the king , I answer , a little job done . "
13407	13411	13402	13403	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" Good again ! "
13412	13418	13420	13421	the sergeant	4614	" You see , blacksmith , "
13435	13480	13420	13421	the sergeant	4614	" we have had an accident with these , and I find the lock of one of 'em goes wrong , and the coupling do n't act pretty . As they are wanted for immediate service , will you throw your eye over them ? "
13511	13526	13528	13532	the off - hand sergeant	713	" Will it ? Then will you set about it at once , blacksmith ? "
13534	13560	13528	13532	the off - hand sergeant	713	" as it 's on his Majesty 's service . And if my men can bear a hand anywhere , they 'll make themselves useful . "
13709	13717	13719	13720	the sergeant	4614	" Would you give me the time ? "
13746	13755	13719	13720	the sergeant	4614	" It 's just gone half past two . "
13756	13763	13765	13766	the sergeant	4614	" That 's not so bad , "
13770	13807	13765	13766	the sergeant	4614	" even if I was forced to halt here nigh two hours , that 'll do . How far might you call yourselves from the marshes , hereabouts ? Not above a mile , I reckon ? "
13808	13813	13815	13816	Mrs. Joe	154	" Just a mile , "
13818	13846	13815	13816	Mrs. Joe	154	" That 'll do . We begin to close in upon 'em about dusk . A little before dusk , my orders are . That 'll do . "
13847	13852	13854	13855	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Convicts , sergeant ? "
13866	13869	13871	13872	the sergeant	4614	" Ay ! "
13874	13912	13871	13872	the sergeant	4614	" two . They 're pretty well known to be out on the marshes still , and they wo n't try to get clear of 'em before dusk . Anybody here seen anything of any such game ? "
13929	13932	13934	13935	the sergeant	4614	" Well ! "
13937	13971	13934	13935	the sergeant	4614	" they 'll find themselves trapped in a circle , I expect , sooner than they count on . Now , blacksmith ! If you 're ready , his Majesty the King is . "
14097	14114	14091	14092	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" Give him wine , Mum . I 'll engage there 's no Tar in that : "
14173	14181	14183	14184	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" Good stuff , eh , sergeant ? "
14186	14193	14195	14196	the sergeant	4614	" I 'll tell you something , "
14198	14208	14195	14196	the sergeant	4614	" I suspect that stuff 's of your providing . "
14221	14228	14209	14210	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" Ay , ay ? Why ? "
14229	14232	14234	14235	the sergeant	4614	" Because , "
14243	14254	14234	14235	the sergeant	4614	" you 're a man that knows what 's what . "
14255	14260	14266	14266	his	176	" D'ye think so ? "
14270	14275	14266	14266	his	176	" Have another glass ! "
14276	14284	14286	14287	the sergeant	4614	" With you . Hob and nob , "
14289	14358	14286	14287	the sergeant	4614	" The top of mine to the foot of yours , - the foot of yours to the top of mine , - Ring once , ring twice , - the best tune on the Musical Glasses ! Your health . May you live a thousand years , and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life ! "

14883	14895	14897	14897	Joe	154	" I hope , Joe , we sha n't find them . "

16171	16186	16163	16164	my convict	814	" I took him . He knows it . That 's enough for me . "
16249	16262	16264	16264	his	820	" Take notice , guard , - he tried to murder me , "
16268	16274	16276	16277	my convict	814	" Tried to murder him ? "
16281	16379	16380	16382	The other one	815	" Try , and not do it ? I took him , and giv ' him up ; that 's what I done . I not only prevented him getting off the marshes , but I dragged him here , - dragged him this far on his way back . He 's a gentleman , if you please , this villain . Now , the Hulks has got its gentleman again , through me . Murder him ? Worth my while , too , to murder him , when I could do worse and drag him back ! "
16386	16403	16380	16382	The other one	815	" He tried - he tried - to - murder me . Bear - bear witness . "

16416	16523	16525	16525	he	827	" Single - handed I got clear of the prison - ship ; I made a dash and I done it . I could ha ' got clear of these death - cold flats likewise - look at my leg : you wo n't find much iron on it - if I had n't made the discovery that he was here . Let him go free ? Let him profit by the means as I found out ? Let him make a tool of me afresh and again ? Once more ? No , no , no . If I had died at the bottom there , "
16538	16562	16563	16565	The other fugitive	828	" I 'd have held to him with that grip , that you should have been safe to find him in my hold . "
16579	16600	16563	16565	The other fugitive	828	" He tried to murder me . I should have been a dead man if you had not come up . "

16722	16758	16759	16760	The other	831	" Do you see what a villain he is ? Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes ? That 's how he looked when we were tried together . He never looked at me . "

17700	17721	17690	17690	he	814	" I wish to say something respecting this escape . It may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me . "
17722	17730	17732	17733	the sergeant	4614	" You can say what you like , "
17745	17780	17690	17690	he	814	" but you have no call to say it here . You 'll have opportunity enough to say about it , and hear about it , before it 's done with , you know . "
17781	17830	17838	17839	the sergeant	4614	" I know , but this is another pint , a separate matter . A man ca n't starve ; at least I ca n't . I took some wittles , up at the willage over yonder , - where the church stands a'most out on the marshes . "
17831	17836	17838	17839	the sergeant	4614	" You mean stole , "
17841	17855	17838	17839	the sergeant	4614	" And I 'll tell you where from . From the blacksmith 's . "
17856	17859	17861	17862	the sergeant	4614	" Halloa ! "
17868	17873	17875	17875	Joe	154	" Halloa , Pip ! "
17881	17904	17875	17875	Joe	154	" It was some broken wittles - that 's what it was - and a dram of liquor , and a pie . "
17905	17920	17922	17923	the sergeant	4614	" Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie , blacksmith ? "
17927	17948	17922	17923	the sergeant	4614	" My wife did , at the very moment when you came in . Do n't you know , Pip ? "
17949	17952	17958	17958	his	814	" So , "
17999	18000	17993	17993	I	0	" "
18018	18030	18031	18031	We	885	" returned Joe , with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe . "
18064	18176	18062	18062	Pip	241	" The something that I had noticed before , clicked in the man 's throat again , and he turned his back . The boat had returned , and his guard were ready , so we followed him to the landing - place made of rough stakes and stones , and saw him put into the boat , which was rowed by a crew of convicts like himself . No one seemed surprised to see him , or interested in seeing him , or glad to see him , or sorry to see him , or spoke a word , except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs , "
18182	18889	18180	18180	you	887	" which was the signal for the dip of the oars . By the light of the torches , we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore , like a wicked Noah 's ark . Cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains , the prison - ship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners . We saw the boat go alongside , and we saw him taken up the side and disappear . Then , the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water , and went out , as if it were all over with him . Chapter VI My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure ; but I hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it . I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to Mrs. Joe , when the fear of being found out was lifted off me . But I loved Joe , - perhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear fellow let me love him , - and , as to him , my inner self was not so easily composed . It was much upon my mind particularly when I first saw him looking about for his file that I ought to tell Joe the whole truth . Yet I did not , and for the reason that I mistrusted that if I did , he would think me worse than I was . The fear of losing Joe 's confidence , and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend , tied up my tongue . I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it , I never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker , without thinking that he was meditating on it . That , if Joe knew it , I never afterwards could see him glance , however casually , at yesterday 's meat or pudding when it came on to - day 's table , without thinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry . That , if Joe knew it , and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick , the conviction that he suspected Tar in it , would bring a rush of blood to my face . In a word , I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right , as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong . I had had no intercourse with the world at that time , and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner . Quite an untaught genius , I made the discovery of the line of action for myself . As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison - ship , Joe took me on his back again and carried me home . He must have had a tiresome journey of it , for Mr. Wopsle , being knocked up , was in such a very bad temper that if the Church had been thrown open , he would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition , beginning with Joe and myself . In his lay capacity , he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent , that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire , the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have hanged him , if it had been a capital offence . By that time , I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard , through having been newly set upon my feet , and through having been fast asleep , and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of tongues . As I came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders , and the restorative exclamation "
18901	19023	19231	19234	wife of the Above	890	" from my sister , I found Joe telling them about the convict 's confession , and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he had got into the pantry . Mr. Pumblechook made out , after carefully surveying the premises , that he had first got upon the roof of the forge , and had then got upon the roof of the house , and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut into strips ; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very positive and drove his own chaise - cart - over Everybody - it was agreed that it must be so . Mr. Wopsle , indeed , wildly cried out , "
19026	19230	19231	19234	wife of the Above	890	" with the feeble malice of a tired man ; but , as he had no theory , and no coat on , he was unanimously set at naught , - not to mention his smoking hard behind , as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out : which was not calculated to inspire confidence . This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me , as a slumberous offence to the company 's eyesight , and assisted me up to bed with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on , and to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs . My state of mind , as I have described it , began before I was up in the morning , and lasted long after the subject had died out , and had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasions . Chapter VII At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones , I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out . My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct , for I read "
19235	19263	19231	19234	wife of the Above	890	" as a complimentary reference to my father 's exaltation to a better world ; and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as "
19266	19320	19231	19234	wife of the Above	890	" I have no doubt I should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family . Neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me , at all accurate ; for , I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my declaration that I was to "
19332	19400	19231	19234	wife of the Above	890	" laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction , and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwright 's or up by the mill . When I was old enough , I was to be apprenticed to Joe , and until I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called "
19403	19647	19231	19234	wife of the Above	890	" or as I render it pampered . Therefore , I was not only odd - boy about the forge , but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten birds , or pick up stones , or do any such job , I was favored with the employment . In order , however , that our superior position might not be compromised thereby , a money - box was kept on the kitchen mantel - shelf , in to which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped . I have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt , but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure . Mr. Wopsle 's great - aunt kept an evening school in the village ; that is to say , she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity , who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening , in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each , for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it . She rented a small cottage , and Mr. Wopsle had the room up stairs , where we students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner , and occasionally bumping on the ceiling . There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle "
19649	20142	20143	20145	MI DEER JO	189	" the scholars once a quarter . What he did on those occasions was to turn up his cuffs , stick up his hair , and give us Mark Antony 's oration over the body of Caesar . This was always followed by Collins 's Ode on the Passions , wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood - stained sword in thunder down , and taking the War - denouncing trumpet with a withering look . It was not with me then , as it was in later life , when I fell into the society of the Passions , and compared them with Collins and Wopsle , rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen . Mr. Wopsle 's great - aunt , besides keeping this Educational Institution , kept in the same room - a little general shop . She had no idea what stock she had , or what the price of anything in it was ; but there was a little greasy memorandum - book kept in a drawer , which served as a Catalogue of Prices , and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transaction . Biddy was Mr. Wopsle 's great - aunt 's granddaughter ; I confess myself quiet unequal to the working out of the problem , what relation she was to Mr. Wopsle . She was an orphan like myself ; like me , too , had been brought up by hand . She was most noticeable , I thought , in respect of her extremities ; for , her hair always wanted brushing , her hands always wanted washing , and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel . This description must be received with a week - day limitation . On Sundays , she went to church elaborated . Much of my unassisted self , and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr. Wopsle 's great - aunt , I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a bramble - bush ; getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter . After that I fell among those thieves , the nine figures , who seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and baffle recognition . But , at last I began , in a purblind groping way , to read , write , and cipher , on the very smallest scale . One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate , expending great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe . I think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes , for it was a long time after , and it was winter and a hard frost . With an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference , I contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle : - "
20189	20238	20239	20239	I	0	" There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by letter , inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone . But I delivered this written communication slate and all with my own hand , and Joe received it as a miracle of erudition . "
20247	20257	20242	20242	Pip	241	" cried Joe , opening his blue eyes wide , "
20267	20268	20269	20269	I	0	" "
20275	20298	20269	20269	I	0	" said I , glancing at the slate as he held it ; with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly . "
20306	20310	20326	20326	Pip	241	" said Joe , "
20336	20417	20334	20334	Joe	189	" I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable , and I had observed at church last Sunday , when I accidentally held our Prayer - Book upside down , that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right . Wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe , I should have to begin quite at the beginning , I said , "
20427	20428	20425	20425	Jo	189	" "
20436	20450	20434	20434	Pip	241	" said Joe , looking at it with a slow , searching eye , "
20480	20500	20478	20478	Pip	241	" I leaned over Joe , and , with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole letter . "
20503	20512	20478	20478	Pip	241	" said Joe , when I had finished . "
20518	20519	20513	20513	You	241	" "
20528	20538	20522	20522	you	241	" I asked him , with a modest patronage . "
20547	20551	20522	20522	you	241	" said Joe . "
20557	20558	20554	20554	you	241	" "
20565	20569	20554	20554	you	241	" said Joe . "
20581	20582	20572	20572	I	0	" "
20588	20589	20586	20586	Joe	154	" "
20597	20601	20554	20554	you	241	" said Joe , "
20628	20639	20626	20626	Lord	895	" he continued , after rubbing his knees a little , "
20655	20674	20653	20653	you	241	" Here , at last , is a J - O , Joe , how interesting reading is ! "
20702	20721	20698	20698	I	0	" Did n't you ever go to school , Joe , when you were as little as me ? "
20722	20727	20698	20698	I	0	" No , Pip . "
20728	20748	20698	20698	I	0	" Why did n't you ever go to school , Joe , when you were as little as me ? "
20749	20754	20756	20756	Joe	154	" Well , Pip , "
20785	20871	20771	20771	he	896	" I 'll tell you . My father , Pip , he were given to drink , and when he were overtook with drink , he hammered away at my mother , most onmerciful . It were a'most the only hammering he did , indeed , ' xcepting at myself . And he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he did n't hammer at his anwil . - You 're a listening and understanding , Pip ? "
20872	20877	20923	20923	God	192	" Yes , Joe . "
20878	20911	20771	20771	he	896	" ' Consequence , my mother and me we ran away from my father several times ; and then my mother she 'd go out to work , and she 'd say , "
20914	20919	20912	20912	Joe	154	" she 'd say , "
20933	21025	21027	21027	Joe	154	" and she 'd put me to school . But my father were that good in his hart that he could n't abear to be without us . So , he 'd come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was , that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him . And then he took us home and hammered us . Which , you see , Pip , "
21043	21051	21027	21027	Joe	154	" were a drawback on my learning . "
21052	21058	21031	21031	his	898	" Certainly , poor Joe ! "
21059	21066	21068	21068	Joe	154	" Though mind you , Pip , "
21084	21114	21068	21068	Joe	154	" rendering unto all their doo , and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man , my father were that good in his hart , do n't you see ? "
21127	21130	21131	21131	Joe	154	" Well ! "
21157	21166	21154	21154	you	0	" I saw that , and said so . "
21272	21296	21297	21297	I	0	" Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity , that I asked him if he had made it himself . "
21301	21305	21306	21306	my	0	" said Joe , "
21453	21494	21433	21433	She	405	" Joe 's blue eyes turned a little watery ; he rubbed first one of them , and then the other , in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner , with the round knob on the top of the poker . "
21501	21505	21433	21433	She	405	" said Joe , "
21522	21543	21520	21520	Pip	241	" - Joe looked firmly at me as if he knew I was not going to agree with him ; - "
21554	21571	21547	21552	a fine figure of a woman	908	" I could not help looking at the fire , in an obvious state of doubt . "
21595	21609	21589	21589	Pip	241	" Joe tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following , "
21622	21632	21633	21633	I	0	" I could think of nothing better to say than "
21642	21643	21640	21640	Joe	154	" "
21648	21656	21640	21640	Joe	154	" returned Joe , catching me up . "
21687	21706	21664	21664	Pip	241	" I sagaciously observed , if it did n't signify to him , to whom did it signify ? "
21709	21713	21664	21664	Pip	241	" assented Joe . "
21771	21785	21758	21758	I	0	" Joe pursued with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed , "
21815	21824	21804	21804	you	241	" Not exactly relishing this , I said , "
21831	21832	21804	21804	you	241	" "
21841	21848	21839	21839	Pip	241	" he returned with tender simplicity . "
21918	21946	21901	21901	I	0	" I broke out crying and begging pardon , and hugged Joe round the neck : who dropped the poker to hug me , and to say , "
21965	21977	21962	21963	old chap	4500	" When this little interruption was over , Joe resumed : - "
22070	22093	22068	22068	Pip	241	" He had taken up the poker again ; without which , I doubt if he could have proceeded in his demonstration . "
22101	22102	22094	22095	Your sister	906	" "
22109	22147	22107	22107	Joe	154	" I was startled , for I had some shadowy idea and I am afraid I must add , hope that Joe had divorced her in a favor of the Lords of the Admiralty , or Treasury . "
22152	22156	22107	22107	Joe	154	" said Joe . "
22167	22168	22174	22174	she	906	" "
22171	22172	22174	22174	she	906	" "
22185	22189	22174	22174	she	906	" Joe continued , "
22222	22238	22212	22215	a sort or rebel	931	" I was going to retort with an inquiry , and had got as far as "
22241	22247	22212	22215	a sort or rebel	931	" when Joe stopped me . "
22326	22340	22324	22324	Pip	241	" Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door , "
22352	22369	22347	22347	she	906	" Joe pronounced this word , as if it began with at least twelve capital Bs . "
22388	22389	22392	22392	Joe	154	" "
22394	22395	22392	22392	Joe	154	" "
22398	22432	22392	22392	Joe	154	" said Joe , passing the poker into his left hand , that he might feel his whisker ; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid occupation ; "
22446	22447	22441	22444	A master - mind	938	" "
22452	22493	22494	22494	Her	906	" I asked , in some hope of bringing him to a stand . But Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected , and completely stopped me by arguing circularly , and answering with a fixed look , "
22496	22497	22494	22494	Her	906	" "
22507	22525	22499	22499	I	0	" Joe resumed , when he had unfixed his look , and got back to his whisker . "
22684	22751	22677	22677	I	0	" Young as I was , I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that night . We were equals afterwards , as we had been before ; but , afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him , I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my heart . "
22754	22764	22677	22677	I	0	" said Joe , rising to replenish the fire ; "
22815	22982	22794	22797	Uncle Pumblechook 's mare	949	" Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market - days , to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a woman 's judgment ; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no confidences in his domestic servant . This was market - day , and Mrs. Joe was out on one of these expeditions . Joe made the fire and swept the hearth , and then we went to the door to listen for the chaise - cart . It was a dry cold night , and the wind blew keenly , and the frost was white and hard . A man would die to - night of lying out on the marshes , I thought . And then I looked at the stars , and considered how awful if would be for a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death , and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude . "
22988	22992	22794	22797	Uncle Pumblechook 's mare	949	" said Joe , "
23000	23137	22794	22797	Uncle Pumblechook 's mare	949	" The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical , as she came along at a much brisker trot than usual . We got a chair out , ready for Mrs. Joe 's alighting , and stirred up the fire that they might see a bright window , and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place . When we had completed these preparations , they drove up , wrapped to the eyes . Mrs. Joe was soon landed , and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too , covering the mare with a cloth , and we were soon all in the kitchen , carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire . "
23140	23167	22794	22797	Uncle Pumblechook 's mare	949	" said Mrs. Joe , unwrapping herself with haste and excitement , and throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings , "
23182	23205	23177	23177	he	4533	" I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could , who was wholly uninformed why he ought to assume that expression . "
23213	23218	23177	23177	he	4533	" said my sister , "
23232	23233	23234	23234	She	951	" "
23243	23248	23241	23241	Mum	174	" said Mr. Pumblechook . "
23253	23270	23271	23271	She	951	" She ? I looked at Joe , making the motion with my lips and eyebrows , "
23273	23288	23289	23289	She	951	" Joe looked at me , making the motion with his lips and eyebrows , "
23291	23324	23289	23289	She	951	" My sister catching him in the act , he drew the back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions , and looked at her . "
23327	23337	23289	23289	She	951	" said my sister , in her snappish way . "
23349	23350	23364	23364	she	951	" "
23356	23361	23353	23354	some individual	954	" Joe politely hinted , "
23366	23367	23364	23364	she	951	" "
23377	23382	23372	23372	she	951	" said my sister . "
23404	23405	23396	23396	you	952	" "
23412	23416	23406	23407	Miss Havisham	223	" said Joe . "
23425	23430	23420	23421	Miss Havisham	223	" returned my sister . "
23455	23475	23449	23449	he	4533	" said my sister , shaking her head at me as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive , "
23482	23533	23477	23477	I	0	" I had heard of Miss Havisham up town , - everybody for miles round had heard of Miss Havisham up town , - as an immensely rich and grim lady who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers , and who led a life of seclusion . "
23539	23545	23477	23477	I	0	" said Joe , astounded . "
23555	23556	23549	23549	she	961	" "
23559	23564	23557	23557	Noodle	962	" cried my sister . "
23571	23572	23567	23567	she	961	" "
23578	23584	23587	23587	she	961	" Joe again politely hinted , "
23596	23597	23587	23587	she	961	" "
23712	23731	23692	23693	Uncle Pumblechook	172	" in a tone of the deepest reproach , as if he were the most callous of nephews , "
23740	23751	23692	23693	Uncle Pumblechook	172	" - which I solemnly declare I was not doing - "
23763	23764	23692	23693	Uncle Pumblechook	172	" "
23768	23773	23692	23693	Uncle Pumblechook	172	" cried Uncle Pumblechook . "
23791	23792	23786	23786	you	172	" "
23797	23823	23824	23824	you	172	" said my sister , still in a reproachful manner , while Joe apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose , "
23937	23950	23935	23935	me	0	" cried my sister , casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation , "
23994	24170	24171	24171	Boy	4519	" With that , she pounced upon me , like an eagle on a lamb , and my face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks , and my head was put under taps of water - butts , and I was soaped , and kneaded , and towelled , and thumped , and harrowed , and rasped , until I really was quite beside myself . I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than any living authority , with the ridgy effect of a wedding - ring , passing unsympathetically over the human countenance . When my ablutions were completed , I was put into clean linen of the stiffest character , like a young penitent into sackcloth , and was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit . I was then delivered over to Mr. Pumblechook , who formally received me as if he were the Sheriff , and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been dying to make all along : "
24191	24192	24197	24197	Joe	172	" "
24199	24200	24197	24197	Joe	172	" "
24210	24794	24205	24205	Pip	241	" I had never parted from him before , and what with my feelings and what with soapsuds , I could at first see no stars from the chaise - cart . But they twinkled out one by one , without throwing any light on the questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham 's , and what on earth I was expected to play at . Chapter VIII Mr. Pumblechook 's premises in the High Street of the market town , were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character , as the premises of a cornchandler and seedsman should be . It appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed , to have so many little drawers in his shop ; and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers , and saw the tied - up brown paper packets inside , whether the flower - seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails , and bloom . It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this speculation . On the previous night , I had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof , which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was , that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows . In the same early morning , I discovered a singular affinity between seeds and corduroys . Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys , and so did his shopman ; and somehow , there was a general air and flavor about the corduroys , so much in the nature of seeds , and a general air and flavor about the seeds , so much in the nature of corduroys , that I hardly knew which was which . The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler , who appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker , who appeared to get on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker , who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer , who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist . The watchmaker , always poring over a little desk with a magnifying - glass at his eye , and always inspected by a group of smock - frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop - window , seemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade engaged his attention . Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlor behind the shop , while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises . I considered Mr. Pumblechook wretched company . Besides being possessed by my sister 's idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my diet , - besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter , and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogether , - his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic . On my politely bidding him Good morning , he said , pompously , "
24801	24850	24205	24205	Pip	241	" And how should I be able to answer , dodged in that way , in a strange place , on an empty stomach ! I was hungry , but before I had swallowed a morsel , he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast . "
24853	24854	24205	24205	Pip	241	" "
24858	24859	24205	24205	Pip	241	" "
24863	24864	24205	24205	Pip	241	" "
24868	24869	24205	24205	Pip	241	" "
24873	24874	24205	24205	Pip	241	" "
24878	25088	24205	24205	Pip	241	" And so on . And after each figure was disposed of , it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a sup , before the next came ; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing , and eating bacon and hot roll , in if I may be allowed the expression a gorging and gormandizing manner . For such reasons , I was very glad when ten o'clock came and we started for Miss Havisham 's ; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the manner in which I should acquit myself under that lady 's roof . Within a quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham 's house , which was of old brick , and dismal , and had a great many iron bars to it . Some of the windows had been walled up ; of those that remained , all the lower were rustily barred . There was a courtyard in front , and that was barred ; so we had to wait , after ringing the bell , until some one should come to open it . While we waited at the gate , I peeped in even then Mr. Pumblechook said , "
25092	25147	24205	24205	Pip	241	" but I pretended not to hear him , and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery . No brewing was going on in it , and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time . A window was raised , and a clear voice demanded "
25151	25158	25159	25159	Pumblechook	176	" To which my conductor replied , "
25161	25166	25159	25159	Pumblechook	176	" The voice returned , "
25170	25195	25159	25159	Pumblechook	176	" and the window was shut again , and a young lady came across the court - yard , with keys in her hand . "
25198	25203	25205	25205	Pip	241	" said Mr. Pumblechook , "
25207	25208	25205	25205	Pip	241	" "
25216	25231	25235	25235	Pip	241	" returned the young lady , who was very pretty and seemed very proud ; "
25237	25253	25235	25235	Pip	241	" Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also , when she stopped him with the gate . "
25256	25260	25235	25235	Pip	241	" she said . "
25269	25270	25262	25262	you	176	" "
25279	25286	25272	25273	Miss Havisham	223	" returned Mr. Pumblechook , discomfited . "
25289	25294	25296	25296	you	176	" said the girl ; "
25302	25357	25298	25298	she	223	" She said it so finally , and in such an undiscussible way , that Mr. Pumblechook , though in a condition of ruffled dignity , could not protest . But he eyed me severely , - as if I had done anything to him ! - and departed with the words reproachfully delivered : "
25376	25394	25368	25368	them	985	" I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound through the gate , "
25398	25533	25368	25368	them	985	" But he did n't . My young conductress locked the gate , and we went across the courtyard . It was paved and clean , but grass was growing in every crevice . The brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it , and the wooden gates of that lane stood open , and all the brewery beyond stood open , away to the high enclosing wall ; and all was empty and disused . The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate ; and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the brewery , like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea . She saw me looking at it , and she said , "
25551	25552	25549	25549	boy	4519	" "
25561	25570	25553	25553	I	0	" said I , in a shy way . "
25595	25596	25602	25602	miss	988	" "
25604	25605	25602	25602	miss	988	" "
25613	25617	25602	25602	miss	988	" she added , "
25660	25661	25670	25670	miss	988	" "
25672	25673	25670	25670	miss	988	" "
25681	25682	25670	25670	miss	988	" "
25693	25694	25691	25691	miss	988	" "
25727	25728	25670	25670	miss	988	" "
25732	25736	25670	25670	miss	988	" said I ; "
25745	25746	25743	25743	miss	988	" "
25749	25753	25743	25743	miss	988	" she replied ; "
25801	25806	25807	25807	boy	4519	" Though she called me "
25808	25965	25743	25743	miss	988	" so often , and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary , she was of about my own age . She seemed much older than I , of course , being a girl , and beautiful and self - possessed ; and she was as scornful of me as if she had been one - and - twenty , and a queen . We went into the house by a side door , the great front entrance had two chains across it outside , - and the first thing I noticed was , that the passages were all dark , and that she had left a candle burning there . She took it up , and we went through more passages and up a staircase , and still it was all dark , and only the candle lighted us . At last we came to the door of a room , and she said , "
25969	25979	25743	25743	miss	988	" I answered , more in shyness than politeness , "
25985	25991	25743	25743	miss	988	" To this she returned : "
26005	26607	25999	25999	I	0	" And scornfully walked away , and - what was worse - took the candle with her . This was very uncomfortable , and I was half afraid . However , the only thing to be done being to knock at the door , I knocked , and was told from within to enter . I entered , therefore , and found myself in a pretty large room , well lighted with wax candles . No glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it . It was a dressing - room , as I supposed from the furniture , though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me . But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking - glass , and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady 's dressing - table . Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lady sitting at it , I can not say . In an arm - chair , with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand , sat the strangest lady I have ever seen , or shall ever see . She was dressed in rich materials , - satins , and lace , and silks , - all of white . Her shoes were white . And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair , and she had bridal flowers in her hair , but her hair was white . Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands , and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table . Dresses , less splendid than the dress she wore , and half - packed trunks , were scattered about . She had not quite finished dressing , for she had but one shoe on , - the other was on the table near her hand , - her veil was but half arranged , her watch and chain were not put on , and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets , and with her handkerchief , and gloves , and some flowers , and a Prayer - Book all confusedly heaped about the looking - glass . It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things , though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed . But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white , had been white long ago , and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow . I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress , and like the flowers , and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes . I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman , and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone . Once , I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair , representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state . Once , I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement . Now , waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me . I should have cried out , if I could . "
26612	26620	26621	26621	Pip	241	" said the lady at the table . "
26625	26626	26621	26621	Pip	241	" "
26629	26630	26627	26627	Pip	241	" "
26643	26644	26627	26627	Pip	241	" "
26657	26709	26649	26649	me	0	" It was when I stood before her , avoiding her eyes , that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail , and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine , and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine . "
26714	26719	26720	26720	You	698	" said Miss Havisham . "
26738	26757	26725	26732	a woman who has never seen the sun	1010	" I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer "
26760	26761	26725	26732	a woman who has never seen the sun	1010	" "
26770	26788	26766	26766	I	0	" she said , laying her hands , one upon the other , on her left side . "
26793	26803	26766	26766	I	0	" It made me think of the young man . "
26809	26810	26806	26806	I	0	" "
26814	26815	26806	26806	I	0	" "
26818	26869	26766	26766	I	0	" She uttered the word with an eager look , and with strong emphasis , and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it . Afterwards she kept her hands there for a little while , and slowly took them away as if they were heavy . "
26874	26879	26870	26870	I	0	" said Miss Havisham . "
26895	26933	26934	26934	I	0	" I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader , that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances . "
26940	26945	26947	26947	I	0	" she went on , "
26964	26977	26934	26934	I	0	" with an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand ; "
26984	27073	26934	26934	I	0	" For a moment , with the fear of my sister 's working me before my eyes , I had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character of Mr. Pumblechook 's chaise - cart . But I felt myself so unequal to the performance that I gave it up , and stood looking at Miss Havisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner , inasmuch as she said , when we had taken a good look at each other , - "
27080	27081	27075	27075	you	1014	" "
27146	27209	27247	27247	she	1018	" I stopped , fearing I might say too much , or had already said it , and we took another look at each other . Before she spoke again , she turned her eyes from me , and looked at the dress she wore , and at the dressing - table , and finally at herself in the looking - glass . "
27215	27245	27247	27247	she	1018	" she muttered , ' so old to me ; so strange to him , so familiar to me ; so melancholy to both of us ! Call Estella . "
27270	27274	27275	27275	she	1018	" Call Estella , "
27284	27297	27275	27275	she	1018	" You can do that . Call Estella . At the door . "
27397	27424	27364	27365	Miss Havisham	223	" Your own , one day , my dear , and you will use it well . Let me see you play cards with this boy . "
27425	27439	27440	27440	I	0	" With this boy ? Why , he is a common laboring boy ! "
27456	27465	27444	27445	Miss Havisham	223	" Well ? You can break his heart . "
27466	27474	27476	27476	Estella	195	" What do you play , boy ? "
27485	27494	27444	27445	Miss Havisham	223	" Nothing but beggar my neighbor , miss . "
27495	27499	27501	27502	Miss Havisham	223	" Beggar him , "
27760	27770	27772	27772	Estella	195	" He calls the knaves Jacks , this boy ! "
27783	27796	27772	27772	Estella	195	" And what coarse hands he has ! And what thick boots ! "
27882	27889	27891	27892	Miss Havisham	223	" You say nothing of her , "
27901	27924	27891	27892	Miss Havisham	223	" She says many hard things of you , but you say nothing of her . What do you think of her ? "
27925	27933	27934	27934	I	0	" I do n't like to say , "
27937	27944	27946	27947	Miss Havisham	223	" Tell me in my ear , "
27952	27960	27961	27961	I	0	" I think she is very proud , "
27968	27972	27961	27961	I	0	" Anything else ? "
27973	27981	27891	27892	Miss Havisham	223	" I think she is very pretty . "
27982	27986	27961	27961	I	0	" Anything else ? "
27987	27995	27996	27996	She	223	" I think she is very insulting . "
28009	28013	27996	27996	She	223	" Anything else ? "
28014	28024	27961	27961	I	0	" I think I should like to go home . "
28025	28038	27961	27961	I	0	" And never see her again , though she is so pretty ? "
28039	28063	27961	27961	I	0	" I am not sure that I should n't like to see her again , but I should like to go home now . "
28064	28070	28072	28073	Miss Havisham	223	" You shall go soon , "
28077	28083	28072	28073	Miss Havisham	223	" Play the game out . "
28242	28251	28253	28254	Miss Havisham	223	" When shall I have you here again ? "
28256	28261	28253	28254	Miss Havisham	223	" Let me think . "
28292	28324	28276	28276	she	223	" There , there ! I know nothing of days of the week ; I know nothing of weeks of the year . Come again after six days . You hear ? "
28325	28330	28276	28276	she	223	" Yes , ma'am . "
28331	28361	28362	28362	I	0	" Estella , take him down . Let him have something to eat , and let him roam and look about him while he eats . Go , Pip . "
28442	28452	28454	28454	Estella	195	" You are to wait here , you boy , "
29885	29892	29877	29877	she	195	" Why do n't you cry ? "
29893	29901	29877	29877	she	195	" Because I do n't want to . "
29902	29906	29908	29908	she	195	" You do , "
29910	29929	29908	29908	she	195	" You have been crying till you are half blind , and you are near crying again now . "
30395	30400	30401	30402	Uncle Pumblechook	172	" Well , boy , "
30420	30429	30430	30430	I	0	" How did you get on up town ? "
30433	30439	30430	30430	I	0	" Pretty well , sir , "

30458	30476	30454	30455	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" Pretty well is no answer . Tell us what you mean by pretty well , boy ? "
30525	30531	30507	30507	I	0	" I mean pretty well . "
30568	30591	30564	30565	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" No ! Do n't lose your temper . Leave this lad to me , ma'am ; leave this lad to me . "
30614	30628	30602	30602	he	176	" First to get our thoughts in order : Forty - three pence ? "

30912	30934	30908	30909	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" This is the way to have him ! We are beginning to hold our own , I think , Mum ? "
30935	30942	30944	30945	Mrs. Joe	154	" I am sure , uncle , "
30947	30965	30944	30945	Mrs. Joe	154	" I wish you had him always ; you know so well how to deal with him . "
30966	30984	30986	30987	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" Now , boy ! What was she a doing of , when you went in today ? "
30989	30994	30995	30995	I	0	" She was sitting , "

Do n't you tell no more of 'em , Pip . That ai n't the way to get out of being common , old chap . And as to being common , I do n't make it out at all clear . You are oncommon in some things . You 're oncommon small . Likewise you 're a oncommon scholar . "
32719	32730	32582	32582	Joe	154	" No , I am ignorant and backward , Joe . "

32805	32875	32877	32877	Joe	154	" be it so or be it son't , you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one , I should hope !

32891	32924	32877	32877	Joe	154	" and begun at A. too , and worked his way to Z. And I know what that is to do , though I ca n't say I 've exactly done it . "

33004	33125	32953	32953	Joe	154	" I 'm sorry there were n't a flag , Pip . Whether that might be or might n't be , is a thing as ca n't be looked into now , without putting your sister on the Rampage ; and that 's a thing not to be thought of as being done intentional . Lookee here , Pip , at what is said to you by a true friend . Which this to you the true friend say . If you ca n't get to be oncommon through going straight , you 'll never get to do it through going crooked . So do n't tell no more on 'em , Pip , and live well and die happy . "

But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort , - alluding to them which bordered on weal - cutlets and dog - fighting , - a sincere well - wisher would adwise , Pip , their being dropped into your meditations , when you go up stairs to bed . That 's all , old chap , and do n't never do it no more . "

38014	38017	38019	38019	she	195	" Now ? "
38021	38035	38019	38019	she	195	" You little coarse monster , what do you think of me now ? "
38036	38043	37998	37998	she	195	" I shall not tell you . "
38044	38058	38019	38019	she	195	" Because you are going to tell up stairs . Is that it ? "
38059	38062	38064	38064	I	0	" No , "
38066	38072	38064	38064	I	0	" that 's not it . "
38073	38085	38019	38019	she	195	" Why do n't you cry again , you little wretch ? "
38086	38096	38098	38098	I.	0	" Because I 'll never cry for you again , "
38165	38171	38173	38174	the gentleman	1244	" Whom have we here ? "
38182	38186	38188	38188	Estella	195	" A boy , "
38345	38353	38355	38355	he	4657	" Boy of the neighborhood ? Hey ? "
38357	38362	38355	38355	he	4657	" Yes , sir , "
38365	38372	38364	38364	I.	0	" How do you come here ? "
38373	38382	38383	38383	I	0	" Miss Havisham sent for me , sir , "
38386	38413	38415	38415	he	4657	" Well ! Behave yourself . I have a pretty large experience of boys , and you 're a bad set of fellows . Now mind ! "
38430	38435	38415	38415	he	4657	" you behave yourself ! "
38557	38560	38561	38561	she	223	" So ! "
38570	38580	38561	38561	she	223	" the days have worn away , have they ? "
38581	38591	38605	38605	her	223	" Yes , ma'am . To - day is - "
38592	38599	38605	38605	her	223	" There , there , there ! "
38608	38622	38561	38561	she	223	" I do n't want to know . Are you ready to play ? "
38632	38642	38623	38623	I	0	" I do n't think I am , ma'am . "
38643	38649	38650	38650	she	223	" Not at cards again ? "
38658	38673	38650	38650	she	223	" Yes , ma'am ; I could do that , if I was wanted . "
38674	38686	38688	38689	Miss Havisham	223	" Since this house strikes you old and grave , boy , "
38693	38707	38688	38689	Miss Havisham	223	" and you are unwilling to play , are you willing to work ? "
38737	38745	38747	38747	she	223	" Then go into that opposite room , "
38760	38768	38747	38747	she	223	" and wait there till I come . "
39157	39160	39162	39162	she	223	" This , "
39173	39194	39162	39162	she	223	" is where I will be laid when I am dead . They shall come and look at me here . "
39231	39239	39240	39240	she	223	" What do you think that is ? "
39250	39258	39240	39240	she	223	" that , where those cobwebs are ? "
39259	39270	39247	39247	her	223	" I ca n't guess what it is , ma'am . "
39271	39285	39286	39286	She	223	" It 's a great cake . A bride - cake . Mine ! "
39311	39324	39305	39305	her	223	" Come , come , come ! Walk me , walk me ! "
39406	39409	39393	39393	She	223	" Slower ! "
39460	39464	39457	39457	she	223	" Call Estella ! "
39594	39599	39601	39603	Miss Sarah Pocket	208	" Dear Miss Havisham , "
39605	39611	39601	39603	Miss Sarah Pocket	208	" How well you look ! "
39612	39617	39619	39620	Miss Havisham	223	" I do not , "
39622	39630	39631	39631	Camilla	206	" I am yellow skin and bone . "
39652	39672	39642	39642	she	223	" Poor dear soul ! Certainly not to be expected to look well , poor thing . The idea ! "
39673	39679	39681	39682	Miss Havisham	223	" And how are you ? "
39726	39733	39734	39734	she	223	" Thank you , Miss Havisham , "
39737	39747	39734	39734	she	223	" I am as well as can be expected . "
39748	39758	39760	39761	Miss Havisham	223	" Why , what 's the matter with you ? "
39767	39772	39774	39774	Camilla	206	" Nothing worth mentioning , "
39776	39807	39774	39774	Camilla	206	" I do n't wish to make a display of my feelings , but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am quite equal to . "
39808	39816	39818	39819	Miss Havisham	223	" Then do n't think of me , "
39821	39826	39828	39828	Camilla	206	" Very easily said ! "
39849	39949	39845	39845	her	1281	" Raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night . Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs . Chokings and nervous jerkings , however , are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love . If I could be less affectionate and sensitive , I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves . I am sure I wish it could be so . But as to not thinking of you in the night - The idea ! "
39997	40029	39979	39979	He	207	" Camilla , my dear , it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other . "
40030	40036	40038	40047	the grave lady whose voice I had heard but once	1283	" I am not aware , "
40049	40069	40038	40047	the grave lady whose voice I had heard but once	1283	" that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person , my dear . "
40122	40132	40141	40143	the grave lady	1285	" No , indeed , my dear . Hem ! "
40133	40139	40141	40143	the grave lady	1285	" Thinking is easy enough , "
40145	40153	40141	40143	the grave lady	1285	" What is easier , you know ? "
40159	40166	40168	40168	Camilla	206	" Oh , yes , yes ! "
40183	40257	40168	40168	Camilla	206	" It 's all very true ! It 's a weakness to be so affectionate , but I ca n't help it . No doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise , still I would n't change my disposition if I could . It 's the cause of much suffering , but it 's a consolation to know I posses it , when I wake up in the night . "
40304	40309	40311	40311	Camilla	206	" There 's Matthew ! "
40313	40371	40311	40311	Camilla	206	" Never mixing with any natural ties , never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is ! I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut , and have lain there hours insensible , with my head over the side , and my hair all down , and my feet I do n't know where - "
40372	40382	40384	40385	Mr. Camilla	206	" Much higher than your head , my love , "
40387	40416	40384	40385	Mr. Camilla	206	" I have gone off into that state , hours and hours , on account of Matthew 's strange and inexplicable conduct , and nobody has thanked me . "
40417	40427	40429	40431	the grave lady	1285	" Really I must say I should think not ! "
40433	40440	40442	40444	Miss Sarah Pocket	208	" You see , my dear , "
40450	40470	40442	40444	Miss Sarah Pocket	208	" the question to put to yourself is , who did you expect to thank you , my love ? "
40471	40483	40485	40485	Camilla	206	" Without expecting any thanks , or anything of the sort , "
40487	40563	40485	40485	Camilla	206	" I have remained in that state , hours and hours , and Raymond is a witness of the extent to which I have choked , and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been , and I have been heard at the piano - forte tuner 's across the street , where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance , - and now to be told - "
40625	40635	40637	40638	Miss Havisham	223	" Matthew will come and see me at last , "
40642	40660	40665	40665	her	223	" when I am laid on that table . That will be his place , - there , "
40668	40717	40725	40725	she	223	" at my head ! And yours will be there ! And your husband 's there ! And Sarah Pocket 's there ! And Georgiana 's there ! Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me . And now go ! "
40742	40749	40738	40738	She	223	" Walk me , walk me ! "
40756	40766	40768	40768	Camilla	206	" I suppose there 's nothing to be done , "
40770	40878	40879	40880	Mr. Camilla	206	" but comply and depart . It 's something to have seen the object of one 's love and duty for even so short a time . I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night . I wish Matthew could have that comfort , but he sets it at defiance . I am determined not to make a display of my feelings , but it 's very hard to be told one wants to feast on one 's relations , - as if one was a Giant , - and to be told to go . The bare idea ! "
40979	40987	40972	40972	her	208	" Bless you , Miss Havisham dear ! "
41054	41062	41035	41035	she	223	" This is my birthday , Pip . "
41079	41124	41074	41074	she	223	" I do n't suffer it to be spoken of . I do n't suffer those who were here just now , or any one to speak of it . They come here on the day , but they dare not refer to it . "
41137	41156	41159	41159	her	223	" On this day of the year , long before you were born , this heap of decay , "
41176	41208	41209	41209	She	223	" was brought here . It and I have worn away together . The mice have gnawed at it , and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me . "
41259	41266	41268	41268	she	223	" When the ruin is complete , "
41275	41323	41268	41268	she	223	" and when they lay me dead , in my bride 's dress on the bride 's table , - which shall be done , and which will be the finished curse upon him , - so much the better if it is done on this day ! "
41425	41440	41421	41422	Miss Havisham	223	" Let me see you two play cards ; why have you not begun ? "
41849	41852	41854	41854	he	1309	" Halloa ! "
41856	41860	41854	41854	he	1309	" young fellow ! "
41881	41884	41878	41878	I	0	" Halloa ! "

41900	41904	41898	41898	he	1309	" Miss Estella . "
41905	41914	41878	41878	I	0	" Who gave you leave to prowl about ? "
41915	41919	41898	41898	he	1309	" Miss Estella . "
41920	41925	41927	41930	the pale young gentleman	1311	" Come and fight , "
41984	41991	41992	41992	he	1311	" Stop a minute , though , "
42004	42021	41992	41992	he	1311	" I ought to give you a reason for fighting , too . There it is ! "
42116	42122	42113	42113	he	1311	" Aha ! Would you ? "
42139	42145	42147	42147	he	1311	" Laws of the game ! "
42162	42166	42169	42169	he	1311	" Regular rules ! "
42180	42192	42195	42195	he	1311	" Come to the ground , and go through the preliminaries ! "
42343	42348	42349	42349	he	1311	" Available for both , "
42812	42819	42795	42795	his	1311	" That means you have won . "
42891	42897	42888	42888	I	0	" Can I help you ? "
42901	42905	42888	42888	I	0	" No thankee , "
42909	42913	42915	42915	he	1311	" Good afternoon , "
42917	42922	42915	42915	he	1311	" Same to you . "
42996	43009	42985	42985	she	195	" Come here ! You may kiss me , if you like . "
44056	44066	44040	44041	Miss Havisham	223	" Does she grow prettier and prettier , Pip ? "
44152	44169	44135	44136	Miss Havisham	223	" Break their hearts my pride and hope , break their hearts and have no mercy ! "
44336	44345	44333	44333	her	223	" There , there , there ! Sing ! "
44806	44855	44858	44858	he	1381	" Now , Mum , here is this boy ! Here is this boy which you brought up by hand . Hold up your head , boy , and be forever grateful unto them which so did do . Now , Mum , with respections to this boy ! "
45193	45220	45172	45172	herself	402	" Come ! there 's enough of you ! You get along to bed ; you 've given trouble enough for one night , I hope ! "
45293	45301	45280	45280	she	223	" You are growing tall , Pip ! "
45400	45412	45388	45388	she	223	" Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours . "
45413	45419	45395	45395	her	223	" Joe Gargery , ma'am . "
45420	45431	45395	45395	her	223	" Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to ? "
45432	45438	45395	45395	her	223	" Yes , Miss Havisham . "
45439	45464	45465	45465	I	0	" You had better be apprenticed at once . Would Gargery come here with you , and bring your indentures , do you think ? "
45483	45489	45472	45472	he	1392	" Then let him come . "
45490	45499	45395	45395	her	223	" At any particular time , Miss Havisham ? "
45500	45522	45472	45472	he	1392	" There , there ! I know nothing about times . Let him come soon , and come along with you . "
45539	45545	45557	45557	She	402	" went on the Rampage , "

46381	46388	46389	46389	Joe	172	" Which I meantersay , Pip , "
46411	46439	46389	46389	Joe	172	" as I hup and married your sister , and I were at the time what you might call if you was anyways inclined a single man . "
46440	46443	46445	46446	Miss Havisham	223	" Well ! "
46448	46473	46445	46446	Miss Havisham	223	" And you have reared the boy , with the intention of taking him for your apprentice ; is that so , Mr. Gargery ? "
46474	46480	46482	46482	Joe	172	" You know , Pip , "
46484	46558	46482	46482	Joe	172	" as you and me were ever friends , and it were looked for'ard to betwixt us , as being calc'lated to lead to larks . Not but what , Pip , if you had ever made objections to the business , - such as its being open to black and sut , or such - like , - not but what they would have been attended to , do n't you see ? "
46559	46564	46566	46567	Miss Havisham	223	" Has the boy , "
46569	46581	46566	46567	Miss Havisham	223	" ever made any objection ? Does he like the trade ? "
46582	46593	46595	46595	Joe	172	" Which it is well beknown to yourself , Pip , "
46609	46620	46595	46595	Joe	172	" that it were the wish of your own hart . "
46645	46667	46640	46640	he	172	" And there were n't no objection on your part , and Pip it were the great wish of your hart ! "
46719	46728	46730	46731	Miss Havisham	223	" Have you brought his indentures with you ? "

47000	47008	47009	47009	she	223	" Pip has earned a premium here , "
47012	47038	47009	47009	she	223	" and here it is . There are five - and - twenty guineas in this bag . Give it to your master , Pip . "

47686	47694	47696	47696	Joe	172	" Which that were my own belief , "
47698	47706	47696	47696	Joe	172	" her compliments to Mrs. J. Gargery - "
47707	47715	47717	47718	my sister	402	" Much good they 'll do me ! "
47725	47729	47731	47731	Joe	172	" And wishing , "
47746	47768	47731	47731	Joe	172	" that the state of Miss Havisham 's elth were sitch as would have - allowed , were it , Pip ? "
47769	47776	47777	47777	I	0	" Of her having the pleasure , "
47780	47786	47788	47788	Joe	172	" Of ladies ' company , "
47796	47799	47801	47802	my sister	402	" Well ! "
47812	47843	47801	47802	my sister	402	" She might have had the politeness to send that message at first , but it 's better late than never . And what did she give young Rantipole here ? "
47844	47850	47852	47852	Joe	172	" She giv ' him , "
47854	47857	47852	47852	Joe	172	" nothing . "
47871	47877	47879	47879	Joe	154	" What she giv ' , "
47931	47941	47925	47925	She	218	" added Joe , with an appearance of reflection , "
47950	47987	47948	47948	Jorge	220	" My sister looked at Pumblechook : who smoothed the elbows of his wooden arm - chair , and nodded at her and at the fire , as if he had known all about it beforehand . "
47995	48005	47992	47992	you	172	" asked my sister , laughing . Positively laughing ! "
48015	48019	48020	48020	They	1428	" demanded Joe . "
48024	48031	48020	48020	They	1428	" returned my sister , curtly , "
48043	48044	48020	48020	They	1428	" "
48053	48078	48085	48085	Mum	174	" said Joe . That fearful Impostor , Pumblechook , immediately nodded , and said , as he rubbed the arms of his chair , "
48087	48088	48085	48085	Mum	174	" "
48098	48103	48091	48091	you	172	" began my sister . "
48110	48114	48108	48108	Mum	174	" said Pumblechook ; "
48132	48133	48108	48108	Mum	174	" "
48140	48144	48108	48108	Mum	174	" proceeded Joe , "
48149	48150	48108	48108	Mum	174	" "
48157	48162	48108	48108	Mum	174	" returned my sister . "
48167	48171	48108	48108	Mum	174	" said Joe , "
48179	48197	48108	48108	Mum	174	" That abject hypocrite , Pumblechook , nodded again , and said , with a patronizing laugh , "
48215	48216	48213	48213	Joseph	154	" "
48225	48237	48213	48213	Joseph	154	" said Joe , delightedly handing the bag to my sister ; "
48247	48248	48213	48213	Joseph	154	" "
48260	48276	48258	48258	Mum	174	" echoed that basest of swindlers , Pumblechook , rising to shake hands with her ; "
48303	48346	48295	48295	I	0	" If the villain had stopped here , his case would have been sufficiently awful , but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody , with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind . "
48355	48370	48351	48351	Joseph	154	" said Pumblechook , as he took me by the arm above the elbow , "
48407	48408	48409	48409	Goodness	221	" "
48415	48423	48412	48413	Uncle Pumblechook	172	" said my sister grasping the money , "
48431	48432	48424	48424	we	1434	" "
48439	48445	48437	48437	Mum	174	" returned that diabolical cornchandler . "
48483	48579	48469	48469	I	0	" The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand , and we at once went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial presence . I say we went over , but I was pushed over by Pumblechook , exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick ; indeed , it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red - handed ; for , as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd , I heard some people say , "
48585	48589	48582	48582	he	1437	" and others , "
48607	48757	48605	48605	he	1437	" One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausage - shop of fetters , and entitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL . The Hall was a queer place , I thought , with higher pews in it than a church , - and with people hanging over the pews looking on , - and with mighty Justices one with a powdered head leaning back in chairs , with folded arms , or taking snuff , or going to sleep , or writing , or reading the newspapers , - and with some shining black portraits on the walls , which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and sticking - plaster . Here , in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested , and I was "
48759	49185	49191	49191	their	1439	" ; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold , to have those little preliminaries disposed of . When we had come out again , and had got rid of the boys who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured , and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me , we went back to Pumblechook 's . And there my sister became so excited by the twenty - five guineas , that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar , and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise - cart , and bring the Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle . It was agreed to be done ; and a most melancholy day I passed . For , it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason , in the minds of the whole company , that I was an excrescence on the entertainment . And to make it worse , they all asked me from time to time , - in short , whenever they had nothing else to do , - why I did n't enjoy myself ? And what could I possibly do then , but say I was enjoying myself , - when I was n't ! However , they were grown up and had their own way , and they made the most of it . That swindling Pumblechook , exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion , actually took the top of the table ; and , when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound , and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I played at cards , drank strong liquors , kept late hours or bad company , or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable , he placed me standing on a chair beside him to illustrate his remarks . My only other remembrances of the great festival are , That they would n't let me go to sleep , but whenever they saw me dropping off , woke me up and told me to enjoy myself . That , rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins 's ode , and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down , with such effect , that a waiter came in and said , "
49203	49745	48605	48605	he	1437	" That , they were all in excellent spirits on the road home , and sang , O Lady Fair ! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass , and asserting with a tremendously strong voice in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner , by wanting to know all about everybody 's private affairs that he was the man with his white locks flowing , and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going . Finally , I remember that when I got into my little bedroom , I was truly wretched , and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Joe 's trade . I had liked it once , but once was not now . Chapter XIV It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home . There may be black ingratitude in the thing , and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved ; but that it is a miserable thing , I can testify . Home had never been a very pleasant place to me , because of my sister 's temper . But , Joe had sanctified it , and I had believed in it . I had believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon ; I had believed in the front door , as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls ; I had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment ; I had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence . Within a single year all this was changed . Now it was all coarse and common , and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella see it on any account . How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault , how much Miss Havisham 's , how much my sister 's , is now of no moment to me or to any one . The change was made in me ; the thing was done . Well or ill done , excusably or inexcusably , it was done . Once , it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my shirt - sleeves and go into the forge , Joe 's ' prentice , I should be distinguished and happy . Now the reality was in my hold , I only felt that I was dusty with the dust of small - coal , and that I had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather . There have been occasions in my later life I suppose as in most lives when I have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and romance , to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more . Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank , as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of apprenticeship to Joe . I remember that at a later period of my "
49748	50834	48605	48605	he	1437	" I used to stand about the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling , comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view , and making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low both were , and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea . I was quite as dejected on the first working - day of my apprenticeship as in that after - time ; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe while my indentures lasted . It is about the only thing I am glad to know of myself in that connection . For , though it includes what I proceed to add , all the merit of what I proceed to add was Joe 's . It was not because I was faithful , but because Joe was faithful , that I never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor . It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of industry , but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry , that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain . It is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honest - hearted duty - doing man flies out into the world ; but it is very possible to know how it has touched one 's self in going by , and I know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe , and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me . What I wanted , who can say ? How can I say , when I never knew ? What I dreaded was , that in some unlucky hour I , being at my grimiest and commonest , should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge . I was haunted by the fear that she would , sooner or later , find me out , with a black face and hands , doing the coarsest part of my work , and would exult over me and despise me . Often after dark , when I was pulling the bellows for Joe , and we were singing Old Clem , and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss Havisham 's would seem to show me Estella 's face in the fire , with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me , - often at such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were , and would fancy that I saw her just drawing her face away , and would believe that she had come at last . After that , when we went in to supper , the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever , and I would feel more ashamed of home than ever , in my own ungracious breast . Chapter XV As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle 's great - aunt 's room , my education under that preposterous female terminated . Not , however , until Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew , from the little catalogue of prices , to a comic song she had once bought for a half - penny . Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines , When I went to Lunnon town sirs , Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul Was n't I done very brown sirs ? Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul - still , in my desire to be wiser , I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity ; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit , except that I thought as I still do the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry . In my hunger for information , I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me , with which he kindly complied . As it turned out , however , that he only wanted me for a dramatic lay - figure , to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways , I soon declined that course of instruction ; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me . Whatever I acquired , I tried to impart to Joe . This statement sounds so well , that I can not in my conscience let it pass unexplained . I wanted to make Joe less ignorant and common , that he might be worthier of my society and less open to Estella 's reproach . The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study , and a broken slate and a short piece of slate - pencil were our educational implements : to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco . I never knew Joe to remember anything from one Sunday to another , or to acquire , under my tuition , any piece of information whatever . Yet he would smoke his pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else , - even with a learned air , - as if he considered himself to be advancing immensely . Dear fellow , I hope he did . It was pleasant and quiet , out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork , and sometimes , when the tide was low , looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water . Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread , I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and Estella ; and whenever the light struck aslant , afar off , upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water - line , it was just the same . - Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque . One Sunday when Joe , greatly enjoying his pipe , had so plumed himself on being "
50839	50904	50905	50905	Joe	172	" that I had given him up for the day , I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand , descrying traces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect , in the sky and in the water , until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head . "
50907	50911	50905	50905	Joe	172	" said I ; "
50925	50926	50920	50921	Miss Havisham	223	" "
50931	50938	50929	50929	Pip	241	" returned Joe , slowly considering . "
50942	50943	50947	50947	Joe	172	" "
50956	50957	50947	50947	Joe	172	" "
50964	50968	50978	50978	Pip	241	" said Joe , "
51001	51002	50988	50988	She	223	" "
51017	51018	51019	51019	You	241	" "
51025	51029	51019	51019	You	241	" said Joe . "
51041	51073	51037	51037	she	223	" Joe felt , as I did , that he had made a point there , and he pulled hard at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition . "
51079	51092	51077	51077	Pip	241	" Joe pursued , as soon as he was past that danger , "
51125	51126	51112	51112	she	223	" "
51135	51136	51133	51133	her	223	" "
51139	51146	51149	51149	Joe	172	" Joe repeated , very emphatically . "
51159	51160	51157	51157	her	223	" "
51204	51239	51242	51242	Joe	172	" I had thought of that too , and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he had thought of it ; for it seemed to render it more probable . "
51244	51245	51242	51242	Joe	172	" "
51251	51252	51248	51249	old chap	4500	" "
51296	51297	51294	51294	her	223	" "
51349	51350	51351	51351	I	0	" "
51369	51388	51362	51362	I	0	" But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it . "
51392	51396	51362	51362	I	0	" said he , "
51461	51462	51463	51463	I	0	" "
51474	51478	51472	51472	Joe	172	" I interposed . "
51481	51497	51472	51472	Joe	172	" said Joe , still harping on it as though I had particularly pressed it , "
51580	51603	51605	51605	you	241	" said Joe , steadfastly impressing it upon me , as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion , "
51637	51638	51641	51641	Joe	172	" "
51643	51656	51641	51641	Joe	172	" I cried , in desperation , taking hold of his coat , "
51675	51676	51665	51665	I	0	" "
51681	51697	51679	51679	Pip	241	" Joe assented , as if he had been contending for that , all along ; "
51712	51713	51706	51706	you	241	" "
51767	51768	51762	51765	Miss Est - Havisham	223	" "
51773	51779	51762	51765	Miss Est - Havisham	223	" said Joe , gravely , "
51792	51793	51794	51794	I	0	" "
51818	52403	51811	51811	you	172	" In brief , Joe thought that if I thought well of it , he thought well of it . But , he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received with cordiality , or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favor received , then this experimental trip should have no successor . By these conditions I promised to abide . Now , Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick . He pretended that his Christian name was Dolge , - a clear Impossibility , - but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular , but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding . He was a broadshouldered loose - limbed swarthy fellow of great strength , never in a hurry , and always slouching . He never even seemed to come to his work on purpose , but would slouch in as if by mere accident ; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner , or went away at night , he would slouch out , like Cain or the Wandering Jew , as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back . He lodged at a sluice - keeper 's out on the marshes , and on working - days would come slouching from his hermitage , with his hands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck and dangling on his back . On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the sluice - gates , or stood against ricks and barns . He always slouched , locomotively , with his eyes on the ground ; and , when accosted or otherwise required to raise them , he looked up in a half - resentful , half - puzzled way , as though the only thought he ever had was , that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking . This morose journeyman had no liking for me . When I was very small and timid , he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner of the forge , and that he knew the fiend very well : also that it was necessary to make up the fire , once in seven years , with a live boy , and that I might consider myself fuel . When I became Joe 's ' prentice , Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him ; howbeit , he liked me still less . Not that he ever said anything , or did anything , openly importing hostility ; I only noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction , and that whenever I sang Old Clem , he came in out of time . Dolge Orlick was at work and present , next day , when I reminded Joe of my half - holiday . He said nothing at the moment , for he and Joe had just got a piece of hot iron between them , and I was at the bellows ; but by and by he said , leaning on his hammer , - "
52437	52460	52434	52435	Old Orlick	225	" I suppose he was about five - and - twenty , but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person . "
52478	52482	52485	52485	I	0	" said Joe . "
52507	52511	52497	52497	I	0	" said Orlick . "
52522	52526	52516	52516	he	241	" said Joe . "
52542	52547	52535	52535	he	225	" retorted that worthy . "
52563	52570	52572	52572	Joe	172	" Do n't lose your temper , "
52574	52580	52582	52582	Orlick	225	" Shall if I like , "
52584	52608	52609	52610	The master	1454	" Some and their up - towning ! Now , master ! Come . No favoring in this shop . Be a man ! "
52715	52720	52707	52707	he	225	" Now , master ! "
52721	52728	52730	52730	Joe	172	" Are you all right now ? "
52732	52740	52742	52744	gruff Old Orlick	225	" Ah ! I am all right , "
52746	52763	52765	52765	Joe	172	" Then , as in general you stick to your work as well as most men , "
52767	52778	52765	52765	Joe	172	" let it be a half - holiday for all . "
52814	52821	52823	52823	she	402	" Like you , you fool ! "
52827	52861	52823	52823	she	402	" giving holidays to great idle hulkers like that . You are a rich man , upon my life , to waste wages in that way . I wish I was his master ! "
52862	52874	52876	52876	Orlick	225	" You 'd be everybody 's master , if you durst , "
52885	52890	52892	52892	Joe	172	" Let her alone , "
52894	52907	52915	52915	herself	402	" I 'd be a match for all noodles and all rogues , "
52921	52987	52915	52915	herself	402	" And I could n't be a match for the noodles , without being a match for your master , who 's the dunder - headed king of the noodles . And I could n't be a match for the rogues , without being a match for you , who are the blackest - looking and the worst rogue between this and France . Now ! "
52988	52998	53000	53001	the journeyman	1455	" You 're a foul shrew , Mother Gargery , "
53003	53019	53000	53001	the journeyman	1455	" If that makes a judge of rogues , you ought to be a good'un . "
53020	53028	53030	53030	Joe	172	" Let her alone , will you ? "
53032	53038	53040	53041	my sister	402	" What did you say ? "
53047	53082	53040	53041	my sister	402	" What did you say ? What did that fellow Orlick say to me , Pip ? What did he call me , with my husband standing by ? Oh ! oh ! oh ! "
53153	53178	53192	53192	his	1455	" what was the name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me ? Oh ! Hold me ! Oh ! "
53179	53186	53192	53192	his	1455	" Ah - h - h ! "
53195	53222	53192	53192	his	1455	" I 'd hold you , if you was my wife . I 'd hold you under the pump , and choke it out of you . "

53236	53243	53252	53252	her	402	" Oh ! To hear him ! "
53266	53300	53245	53246	my sister	402	" To hear the names he 's giving me ! That Orlick ! In my own house ! Me , a married woman ! With my husband standing by ! Oh ! Oh ! "
53725	53744	53703	53703	Joe	154	" On the Rampage , Pip , and off the Rampage , Pip : - such is Life ! "
53846	53855	53857	53858	Miss Pocket	208	" How , then ? You here again ? "
53860	53866	53857	53858	Miss Pocket	208	" What do you want ? "
53917	53921	53902	53902	she	208	" come up . "
53932	53935	53937	53937	she	208	" Well ? "
53945	53957	53937	53937	she	208	" I hope you want nothing ? You 'll get nothing . "
53958	53989	53940	53940	her	208	" No indeed , Miss Havisham . I only wanted you to know that I am doing very well in my apprenticeship , and am always much obliged to you . "
53990	53995	53937	53937	she	208	" There , there ! "
54002	54016	54017	54017	she	208	" Come now and then ; come on your birthday . - Ay ! "
54029	54039	54017	54017	she	208	" You are looking round for Estella ? Hey ? "
54064	54067	54069	54070	Miss Havisham	223	" Abroad , "
54072	54103	54069	54070	Miss Havisham	223	" educating for a lady ; far out of reach ; prettier than ever ; admired by all who see her . Do you feel that you have lost her ? "
54671	54680	54665	54665	his	172	" Take warning , boy , take warning ! "
54823	54826	54827	54827	we	1504	" Halloa ! "
54832	54836	54827	54827	we	1504	" Orlick there ? "
54837	54840	54841	54841	he	428	" Ah ! "
54847	54861	54841	54841	he	428	" I was standing by a minute , on the chance of company . "
54862	54867	54868	54868	I	0	" You are late , "
54876	54884	54871	54871	Orlick	225	" Well ? And you 're late . "
54885	54890	54892	54893	Mr. Wopsle	169	" We have been , "
54902	54916	54917	54918	Old Orlick	225	" we have been indulging , Mr. Orlick , in an intellectual evening . "
54956	54959	54961	54961	he	225	" Yes , "
54963	55000	54961	54961	he	225	" all of it . I come in behind yourself . I did n't see you , but I must have been pretty close behind you . By the by , the guns is going again . "
55001	55006	55008	55008	I.	0	" At the Hulks ? "
55009	55039	55008	55008	I.	0	" Ay ! There 's some of the birds flown from the cages . The guns have been going since dark , about . You 'll hear one presently . "
55088	55097	55099	55099	Orlick	225	" A good night for cutting off in , "
55101	55122	55099	55099	Orlick	225	" We 'd be puzzled how to bring down a jail - bird on the wing , to - night . "
55258	55282	55285	55285	he	225	" Beat it out , beat it out , - Old Clem ! With a clink for the stout , - Old Clem ! "
55385	55391	55393	55393	he	225	" There 's something wrong , "
55398	55409	55393	55393	he	225	" up at your place , Pip . Run all ! "
55410	55415	55416	55416	I	0	" What is it ? "
55432	55464	55426	55426	Orlick	225	" I ca n't quite understand . The house seems to have been violently entered when Joe Gargery was out . Supposed by convicts . Somebody has been attacked and hurt . "
57151	57166	57146	57146	his	1584	" Such a fine figure of a woman as she once were , Pip ! "
57554	57560	57562	57562	Biddy	188	" Why , of course ! "
57569	57579	57562	57562	Biddy	188	" Do n't you see ? It 's him ! "
58275	58278	58280	58280	I	0	" Biddy , "
58282	58301	58280	58280	I	0	" how do you manage it ? Either I am very stupid , or you are very clever . "
58302	58315	58317	58317	Biddy	188	" What is it that I manage ? I do n't know , "
58349	58357	58359	58359	I	0	" How do you manage , Biddy , "
58361	58377	58359	58359	I	0	" to learn everything that I learn , and always to keep up with me ? "
58433	58441	58443	58443	Biddy	188	" I might as well ask you , "
58445	58450	58443	58443	Biddy	188	" how you manage ? "
58451	58486	58500	58500	Biddy	188	" No ; because when I come in from the forge of a night , any one can see me turning to at it . But you never turn to at it , Biddy . "
58487	58498	58500	58500	Biddy	188	" I suppose I must catch it like a cough , "
58605	58614	58616	58616	I	0	" You are one of those , Biddy , "
58618	58644	58616	58616	I	0	" who make the most of every chance . You never had a chance before you came here , and see how improved you are ! "
58660	58672	58674	58674	she	188	" I was your first teacher though ; was n't I ? "
58680	58683	58684	58684	I	0	" Biddy ! "
58690	58697	58684	58684	I	0	" Why , you are crying ! "
58698	58704	58706	58706	Biddy	188	" No I am not , "
58713	58721	58706	58706	Biddy	188	" What put that in your head ? "
58926	58931	58932	58932	I	0	" Yes , Biddy , "
58943	58970	58932	58932	I	0	" you were my first teacher , and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this , in this kitchen . "
58971	58977	58979	58979	Biddy	188	" Ah , poor thing ! "
59011	59017	58984	58984	her	188	" that 's sadly true ! "
59018	59021	59023	59023	I	0	" Well ! "
59025	59074	59023	59023	I	0	" we must talk together a little more , as we used to do . And I must consult you a little more , as I used to do . Let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday , Biddy , and a long chat . "
59223	59226	59228	59228	I	0	" Biddy , "
59236	59244	59228	59228	I	0	" I want to be a gentleman . "
59245	59257	59258	59258	she	188	" O , I would n't , if I was you ! "
59261	59270	59228	59228	I	0	" I do n't think it would answer . "
59271	59274	59276	59276	I	0	" Biddy , "
59282	59294	59276	59276	I	0	" I have particular reasons for wanting to be a gentleman . "
59295	59314	59228	59228	I	0	" You know best , Pip ; but do n't you think you are happier as you are ? "
59315	59318	59319	59319	I	0	" Biddy , "
59324	59363	59319	59319	I	0	" I am not at all happy as I am . I am disgusted with my calling and with my life . I have never taken to either , since I was bound . Do n't be absurd . "
59364	59369	59371	59371	Biddy	188	" Was I absurd ? "
59378	59405	59375	59375	her	188	" I am sorry for that ; I did n't mean to be . I only want you to do well , and to be comfortable . "
59406	59451	59319	59319	I	0	" Well , then , understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortable - or anything but miserable - there , Biddy ! - unless I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now . "
59452	59458	59460	59460	Biddy	188	" That 's a pity ! "
59547	59555	59556	59556	I	0	" If I could have settled down , "
59593	59702	59703	59703	Biddy	188	" if I could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was little , I know it would have been much better for me . You and I and Joe would have wanted nothing then , and Joe and I would perhaps have gone partners when I was out of my time , and I might even have grown up to keep company with you , and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine Sunday , quite different people . I should have been good enough for you ; should n't I , Biddy ? "
59719	59729	59706	59706	she	188	" Yes ; I am not over - particular . "
59742	59747	59749	59749	I	0	" Instead of that , "
59796	59821	59770	59770	Dissatisfied	235	" Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine , and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships . "
59836	59848	59770	59770	Dissatisfied	235	" she remarked , directing her eyes to the ships again . "
59853	59887	59888	59895	The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham 's	1632	" I was disconcerted , for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was going to . It was not to be shuffled off now , however , and I answered , "
59924	59954	59914	59914	I	0	" Having made this lunatic confession , I began to throw my torn - up grass into the river , as if I had some thoughts of following it . "
59972	59982	59956	59956	you	0	" Biddy quietly asked me , after a pause . "
59988	59993	59983	59983	I	0	" I moodily answered . "
60003	60007	60008	60008	I	0	" Biddy pursued , "
60057	60106	60046	60046	you	0	" Exactly what I myself had thought , many times . Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment . But how could I , a poor dazed village lad , avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day ? "
60114	60120	60046	60046	you	0	" said I to Biddy , "
60127	60328	60122	60122	I	0	" In short , I turned over on my face when I came to that , and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head , and wrenched it well . All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced , that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right , if I had lifted it up by my hair , and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot . Biddy was the wisest of girls , and she tried to reason no more with me . She put her hand , which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work , upon my hands , one after another , and gently took them out of my hair . Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way , while with my face upon my sleeve I cried a little , - exactly as I had done in the brewery yard , - and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill - used by somebody , or by everybody ; I ca n't say which . "
60336	60340	60346	60346	you	1636	" said Biddy , "
60454	60482	60440	60440	you	1636	" So , with a quiet sigh for me , Biddy rose from the bank , and said , with a fresh and pleasant change of voice , "
60494	60495	60496	60496	Biddy	188	" "
60498	60518	60496	60496	Biddy	188	" I cried , getting up , putting my arm round her neck , and giving her a kiss , "
60526	60527	60519	60519	I	0	" "
60534	60538	60529	60529	you	1636	" said Biddy . "
60580	60581	60571	60571	I	0	" "
60584	60623	60624	60624	I	0	" said Biddy , quite in a whisper , as she looked away at the ships . And then repeated , with her former pleasant change , ' shall we walk a little farther , or go home ? "
60806	60815	60801	60801	I	0	" Pip , what a fool you are ! "
60901	60904	60906	60906	I	0	" Biddy , "
60914	60923	60906	60906	I	0	" I wish you could put me right . "
60924	60930	60932	60932	Biddy	188	" I wish I could ! "
60934	60963	60932	60932	Biddy	188	" If I could only get myself to fall in love with you , - you do n't mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance ? "
60964	60972	60974	60974	Biddy	188	" Oh dear , not at all ! "
60976	60982	60974	60974	Biddy	188	" Do n't mind me . "
60983	61002	60932	60932	Biddy	188	" If I could only get myself to do it , that would be the thing for me . "
61003	61012	61014	61014	Biddy	188	" But you never will , you see , "
61149	61152	61153	61153	he	1653	" Halloa ! "
61156	61163	61153	61153	he	1653	" where are you two going ? "
61164	61174	61208	61208	his	1653	" Where should we be going , but home ? "
61175	61180	61182	61182	he	1653	" Well , then , "
61184	61196	61182	61182	he	1653	" I 'm jiggered if I do n't see you home ! "
61296	61309	61279	61279	Biddy	188	" Do n't let him come ; I do n't like him . "
61402	61405	61406	61406	she	402	" Oh ! "
61419	61430	61406	61406	she	402	" because I - I am afraid he likes me . "
61431	61441	61442	61442	I	0	" Did he ever tell you he liked you ? "
61446	61449	61451	61451	Biddy	188	" No , "
61459	61479	61451	61451	Biddy	188	" he never told me so ; but he dances at me , whenever he can catch my eye . "
61524	61536	61538	61538	Biddy	188	" But it makes no difference to you , you know , "
61542	61568	61538	61538	Biddy	188	" No , Biddy , it makes no difference to me ; only I do n't like it ; I do n't approve of it . "
61569	61574	61576	61576	Biddy	188	" Nor I neither , "
61578	61587	61576	61576	Biddy	188	" Though that makes no difference to you . "
61588	61591	61593	61593	I	0	" Exactly , "
61595	61621	61593	61593	I	0	" but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you , Biddy , if he danced at you with your own consent . "
62032	62038	62028	62028	He	169	" I am done for , "
62048	62055	62044	62044	he	169	" I 'll serve you out , "
62212	62215	62217	62218	the stranger	1159	" Well ! "
62229	62245	62246	62246	Everybody	678	" you have settled it all to your own satisfaction , I have no doubt ? "
62267	62273	62275	62275	he	1674	" Guilty , of course ? "
62277	62284	62259	62259	He	1674	" Out with it . Come ! "
62285	62288	62290	62291	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Sir , "
62293	62307	62290	62291	Mr. Wopsle	169	" without having the honor of your acquaintance , I do say Guilty . "
62321	62327	62329	62330	the stranger	1159	" I know you do , "
62332	62385	62329	62330	the stranger	1159	" I knew you would . I told you so . But now I 'll ask you a question . Do you know , or do you not know , that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent , until he is proved - proved - to be guilty ? "
62386	62389	62390	62391	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Sir , "
62396	62404	62390	62391	Mr. Wopsle	169	" as an Englishman myself , I - "
62405	62408	62410	62411	the stranger	1159	" Come ! "
62419	62444	62445	62445	He	1159	" Do n't evade the question . Either you know it , or you do n't know it . Which is it to be ? "
62489	62492	62494	62494	he	1159	" Now ! "
62496	62509	62494	62494	he	1159	" Do you know it , or do n't you know it ? "
62510	62516	62518	62519	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Certainly I know it , "
62521	62546	62518	62519	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Certainly you know it . Then why did n't you say so at first ? Now , I 'll ask you another question , "
62564	62580	62581	62582	Mr. Wopsle	169	" do you know that none of these witnesses have yet been cross - examined ? "
62586	62592	62581	62582	Mr. Wopsle	169	" I can only say - "
62599	62621	62594	62595	the stranger	1159	" What ? You wo n't answer the question , yes or no ? Now , I 'll try you again . "
62629	62671	62623	62623	his	1159	" Attend to me . Are you aware , or are you not aware , that none of these witnesses have yet been cross - examined ? Come , I only want one word from you . Yes , or no ? "
62689	62692	62694	62695	the stranger	1159	" Come ! "
62697	62729	62694	62695	the stranger	1159	" I 'll help you . You do n't deserve help , but I 'll help you . Look at that paper you hold in your hand . What is it ? "
62730	62735	62737	62738	Mr. Wopsle	169	" What is it ? "
62748	62752	62757	62757	his	1159	" Is it , "
62764	62775	62757	62757	his	1159	" the printed paper you have just been reading from ? "
62776	62779	62694	62695	the stranger	1159	" Undoubtedly . "
62780	62814	62757	62757	his	1159	" Undoubtedly . Now , turn to that paper , and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence ? "
62815	62822	62823	62824	Mr. Wopsle	169	" I read that just now , "
62827	62910	62823	62824	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Never mind what you read just now , sir ; I do n't ask you what you read just now . You may read the Lord 's Prayer backwards , if you like , - and , perhaps , have done it before to - day . Turn to the paper . No , no , no my friend ; not to the top of the column ; you know better than that ; to the bottom , to the bottom . "
62922	62930	62916	62917	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Well ? Have you found it ? "
62931	62936	62938	62939	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Here it is , "
62941	62986	62938	62939	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Now , follow that passage with your eye , and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence ? Come ! Do you make that of it ? "
62991	62999	62987	62988	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Those are not the exact words . "
63000	63006	63008	63009	the gentleman	1244	" Not the exact words ! "
63012	63019	63008	63009	the gentleman	1244	" Is that the exact substance ? "
63020	63023	63025	63026	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Yes , "
63028	63031	63033	63034	the stranger	1159	" Yes , "
63055	63097	63045	63045	his	1159	" And now I ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who , with that passage before his eyes , can lay his head upon his pillow after having pronounced a fellow - creature guilty , unheard ? "
63125	63133	63135	63136	the gentleman	1244	" And that same man , remember , "
63147	63228	63139	63139	his	1244	" that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial , and , having thus deeply committed himself , might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow , after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar , and would a true verdict give according to the evidence , so help him God ! "
63343	63350	63352	63352	he	1696	" From information I have received , "
63365	63392	63352	63352	he	1696	" I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you , by name Joseph - or Joe - Gargery . Which is the man ? "
63393	63399	63401	63401	Joe	154	" Here is the man , "
63417	63423	63425	63426	the stranger	1159	" You have an apprentice , "
63428	63438	63425	63426	the stranger	1159	" commonly known as Pip ? Is he here ? "
63439	63444	63445	63445	I	0	" I am here ! "
63560	63572	63574	63574	he	1159	" I wish to have a private conference with you two , "
63585	63639	63577	63577	he	1159	" It will take a little time . Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence . I prefer not to anticipate my communication here ; you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards ; I have nothing to do with that . "
63790	63794	63795	63795	he	1701	" My name , "
63798	63884	63795	63795	he	1701	" is Jaggers , and I am a lawyer in London . I am pretty well known . I have unusual business to transact with you , and I commence by explaining that it is not of my originating . If my advice had been asked , I should not have been here . It was not asked , and you see me here . What I have to do as the confidential agent of another , I do . No less , no more . "
63936	63983	63899	63899	he	1701	" Now , Joseph Gargery , I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow your apprentice . You would not object to cancel his indentures at his request and for his good ? You would want nothing for so doing ? "
63984	64000	64002	64002	Joe	154	" Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip 's way , "
64006	64018	64020	64021	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Lord forbidding is pious , but not to the purpose , "
64023	64038	64020	64021	Mr. Jaggers	237	" The question is , Would you want anything ? Do you want anything ? "
64039	64044	64046	64046	Joe	154	" The answer is , "
64050	64053	64046	64046	Joe	154	" No . "
64091	64095	64097	64098	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Very well , "
64100	64118	64097	64098	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Recollect the admission you have made , and do n't try to go from it presently . "
64119	64127	64129	64129	Joe	154	" Who 's a going to try ? "
64131	64145	64129	64129	Joe	154	" I do n't say anybody is . Do you keep a dog ? "
64146	64155	64185	64186	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Yes , I do keep a dog . "
64156	64183	64185	64186	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Bear in mind then , that Brag is a good dog , but Holdfast is a better . Bear that in mind , will you ? "
64206	64232	64233	64233	Joe	154	" Now , I return to this young fellow . And the communication I have got to make is , that he has Great Expectations . "
64244	64253	64255	64256	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I am instructed to communicate to him , "
64265	64327	64259	64259	his	237	" that he will come into a handsome property . Further , that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property , that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life and from this place , and be brought up as a gentleman , - in a word , as a young fellow of great expectations . "
64355	64361	64363	64364	the lawyer	1715	" Now , Mr. Pip , "
64366	64447	64363	64364	the lawyer	1715	" I address the rest of what I have to say , to you . You are to understand , first , that it is the request of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of Pip . You will have no objection , I dare say , to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition . But if you have any objection , this is the time to mention it . "
64475	64786	64466	64466	I	0	" I should think not ! Now you are to understand , secondly , Mr. Pip , that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret , until the person chooses to reveal it . I am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself . When or where that intention may be carried out , I can not say ; no one can say . It may be years hence . Now , you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head , or any allusion or reference , however distant , to any individual whomsoever as the individual , in all the communications you may have with me . If you have a suspicion in your own breast , keep that suspicion in your own breast . It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are ; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons , or they may be mere whim . This is not for you to inquire into . The condition is laid down . Your acceptance of it , and your observance of it as binding , is the only remaining condition that I am charged with , by the person from whom I take my instructions , and for whom I am not otherwise responsible . That person is the person from whom you derive your expectations , and the secret is solely held by that person and by me . Again , not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune ; but if you have any objection to it , this is the time to mention it . Speak out . "
64800	64817	64466	64466	I	0	" I should think not ! Now , Mr. Pip , I have done with stipulations . "
64890	64957	64872	64872	he	1716	" We come next , to mere details of arrangement . You must know that , although I have used the term ' expectations ' more than once , you are not endowed with expectations only . There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance . You will please consider me your guardian . Oh ! "
64966	65023	65024	65024	I	0	" I tell you at once , I am paid for my services , or I should n't render them . It is considered that you must be better educated , in accordance with your altered position , and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage . "
65033	65046	65047	65047	he	1716	" Never mind what you have always longed for , Mr. Pip , "
65050	65088	65047	65047	he	1716	" keep to the record . If you long for it now , that 's enough . Am I answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor ? Is that it ? "
65097	65138	65139	65139	I	0	" Good . Now , your inclinations are to be consulted . I do n't think that wise , mind , but it 's my trust . Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another ? "
65164	65186	65188	65189	Mr. Jaggers	237	" There is a certain tutor , of whom I have some knowledge , who I think might suit the purpose , "
65191	65217	65188	65189	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I do n't recommend him , observe ; because I never recommend anybody . The gentleman I speak of is one Mr. Matthew Pocket . "
65272	65278	65280	65281	Mr. Jaggers	237	" You know the name ? "
65313	65316	65318	65318	he	237	" Oh ! "
65320	65340	65318	65318	he	237	" You have heard of the name . But the question is , what do you say of it ? "
65360	65367	65368	65368	he	237	" No , my young friend ! "
65378	65382	65368	65368	he	237	" Recollect yourself ! "
65401	65408	65409	65409	he	237	" No , my young friend , "
65424	65465	65409	65409	he	237	" no , no , no ; it 's very well done , but it wo n't do ; you are too young to fix me with it . Recommendation is not the word , Mr. Pip . Try another . "
65486	65493	65495	65496	Mr. Jaggers	237	" That 's more like it ! "
65510	65551	65552	65552	I	0	" Good . You had better try him in his own house . The way shall be prepared for you , and you can see his son first , who is in London . When will you come to London ? "
65573	65576	65578	65579	Mr. Jaggers	237	" First , "
65581	65619	65620	65620	He	237	" you should have some new clothes to come in , and they should not be working - clothes . Say this day week . You 'll want some money . Shall I leave you twenty guineas ? "
65682	65692	65676	65676	his	237	" Well , Joseph Gargery ? You look dumbfoundered ? "
65693	65697	65699	65699	Joe	154	" I am ! "
65707	65720	65699	65699	Joe	154	" It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself , remember ? "
65721	65726	65728	65728	Joe	154	" It were understood , "
65730	65744	65728	65728	Joe	154	" And it are understood . And it ever will be similar according . "
65745	65749	65755	65755	his	237	" But what , "
65759	65776	65751	65752	Mr. Jaggers	237	" what if it was in my instructions to make you a present , as compensation ? "
65777	65783	65784	65784	Joe	154	" As compensation what for ? "
65787	65795	65784	65784	Joe	154	" For the loss of his services . "
65842	65849	65851	65851	Joe	154	" Pip is that hearty welcome , "
65853	65907	65851	65851	Joe	154	" to go free with his services , to honor and fortun ' , as no words can tell him . But if you think as Money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child - what come to the forge - and ever the best of friends ! - "
66119	66175	66103	66103	he	1729	" Now , Joseph Gargery , I warn you this is your last chance . No half measures with me . If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge to make you , speak out , and you shall have it . If on the contrary you mean to say - "
66202	66207	66209	66209	Joe	154	" Which I meantersay , "
66211	66259	66209	66209	Joe	154	" that if you come into my place bull - baiting and badgering me , come out ! Which I meantersay as sech if you 're a man , come on ! Which I meantersay that what I say , I meantersay and stand or fall by ! "
66349	66456	66457	66457	He	1729	" Well , Mr. Pip , I think the sooner you leave here - as you are to be a gentleman - the better . Let it stand for this day week , and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime . You can take a hackney - coach at the stage - coach office in London , and come straight to me . Understand , that I express no opinion , one way or other , on the trust I undertake . I am paid for undertaking it , and I do so . Now , understand that , finally . Understand that ! "
66519	66528	66534	66534	he	1729	" I beg your pardon , Mr. Jaggers . "
66529	66532	66534	66534	he	1729	" Halloa ! "
66539	66545	66534	66534	he	1729	" what 's the matter ? "
66546	66595	66534	66534	he	1729	" I wish to be quite right , Mr. Jaggers , and to keep to your directions ; so I thought I had better ask . Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know , about here , before I go away ? "
66596	66599	66601	66601	he	1729	" No , "
66611	66625	66601	66601	he	1729	" I do n't mean in the village only , but up town ? "
66626	66629	66631	66631	he	1729	" No , "
66633	66637	66631	66631	he	1729	" No objection . "
66787	66795	66783	66783	I	0	" Joe , have you told Biddy ? "
66796	66801	66803	66803	Joe	154	" No , Pip , "
66831	66841	66819	66819	he	1742	" which I left it to yourself , Pip . "
66842	66851	66887	66887	his	1742	" I would rather you told , Joe . "
66852	66862	66864	66864	Joe	154	" Pip 's a gentleman of fortun ' then , "
66866	66874	66864	66864	Joe	154	" and God bless him in it ! "
67032	67045	67023	67023	Joe	154	" Ay , ay , I 'll be ekervally partickler , Pip ; "
67127	67129	67112	67112	her	188	" Pip "
67131	67134	67112	67112	her	188	" Property . "
67391	67395	67397	67397	I	0	" Saturday night , "
67412	67430	67397	67397	I	0	" Five more days , and then the day before the day ! They 'll soon go . "
67431	67436	67438	67438	Joe	154	" Yes , Pip , "
67450	67456	67438	67438	Joe	154	" They 'll soon go . "
67457	67463	67465	67465	Biddy	188	" Soon , soon go , "
67467	67532	67465	67465	Biddy	188	" I have been thinking , Joe , that when I go down town on Monday , and order my new clothes , I shall tell the tailor that I 'll come and put them on there , or that I 'll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook 's . It would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here . "
67533	67554	67556	67556	Joe	154	" Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen - teel figure too , Pip , "
67597	67613	67585	67585	he	1755	" So might Wopsle . And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment . "
67614	67651	67585	67585	he	1755	" That 's just what I do n't want , Joe . They would make such a business of it , - such a coarse and common business , - that I could n't bear myself . "
67652	67660	67662	67662	Joe	154	" Ah , that indeed , Pip ! "
67664	67672	67662	67662	Joe	154	" If you could n't abear yourself - "
67687	67718	67679	67679	she	188	" Have you thought about when you 'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery , and your sister and me ? You will show yourself to us ; wo n't you ? "
67719	67722	67723	67723	I	0	" Biddy , "
67729	67745	67723	67723	I	0	" you are so exceedingly quick that it 's difficult to keep up with you . "
67746	67752	67754	67754	Joe	154	" She always were quick , "
67756	67796	67754	67754	Joe	154	" If you had waited another moment , Biddy , you would have heard me say that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening , - most likely on the evening before I go away . "
68769	68784	68752	68752	He	1789	" As being the last time , Pip , I thought I 'd foller . "
68785	68797	68752	68752	He	1789	" And Joe , I am very glad you did so . "
68798	68803	68752	68752	He	1789	" Thankee , Pip . "
68804	68813	68814	68814	I	0	" You may be sure , dear Joe , "
68824	68832	68814	68814	I	0	" that I shall never forget you . "
68833	68840	68842	68842	Joe	154	" No , no , Pip ! "
68849	68911	68842	68842	Joe	154	" I 'm sure of that . Ay , ay , old chap ! Bless you , it were only necessary to get it well round in a man 's mind , to be certain on it . But it took a bit of time to get it well round , the change come so oncommon plump ; did n't it ? "
68944	68952	68933	68933	him	1791	" It does you credit , Pip , "
69014	69019	69021	69021	Joe	154	" Have you though ? "
69023	69026	69021	69021	Joe	154	" Astonishing ! "
69027	69036	69038	69038	I	0	" It 's a pity now , Joe , "
69040	69062	69038	69038	I	0	" that you did not get on a little more , when we had our lessons here ; is n't it ? "
69063	69071	69073	69073	Joe	154	" Well , I do n't know , "
69075	69126	69073	69073	Joe	154	" I 'm so awful dull . I 'm only master of my own trade . It were always a pity as I was so awful dull ; but it 's no more of a pity now , than it was - this day twelvemonth - do n't you see ? "
69250	69257	69259	69259	I	0	" And it is , Biddy , "
69261	69277	69259	69259	I	0	" that you will not omit any opportunity of helping Joe on , a little . "
69278	69284	69286	69286	Biddy	188	" How helping him on ? "
69295	69342	69286	69286	Biddy	188	" Well ! Joe is a dear good fellow , - in fact , I think he is the dearest fellow that ever lived , - but he is rather backward in some things . For instance , Biddy , in his learning and his manners . "
69373	69386	69388	69388	Biddy	188	" O , his manners ! wo n't his manners do then ? "
69397	69408	69388	69388	Biddy	188	" My dear Biddy , they do very well here - "
69409	69418	69420	69420	Biddy	188	" O ! they do very well here ? "
69431	69471	69420	69420	Biddy	188	" Hear me out , - but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere , as I shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property , they would hardly do him justice . "
69472	69482	69484	69484	Biddy	188	" And do n't you think he knows that ? "
69513	69521	69522	69522	Biddy	188	" Biddy , what do you mean ? "
69566	69577	69507	69507	I	0	" Have you never considered that he may be proud ? "
69578	69581	69582	69582	I	0	" Proud ? "
69589	69599	69601	69601	Biddy	188	" O ! there are many kinds of pride , "
69612	69621	69601	69601	Biddy	188	" pride is not all of one kind - "
69622	69631	69633	69633	I.	0	" Well ? What are you stopping for ? "
69634	69641	69643	69643	Biddy	188	" Not all of one kind , "
69645	69707	69601	69601	Biddy	188	" He may be too proud to let any one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill , and fills well and with respect . To tell you the truth , I think he is ; though it sounds bold in me to say so , for you must know him far better than I do . "
69708	69713	69715	69715	I	0	" Now , Biddy , "
69717	69766	69715	69715	I	0	" I am very sorry to see this in you . I did not expect to see this in you . You are envious , Biddy , and grudging . You are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune , and you ca n't help showing it . "
69767	69777	69779	69779	Biddy	188	" If you have the heart to think so , "
69801	69802	69715	69715	I	0	" "
69817	69828	69812	69812	you	188	" said I , in a virtuous and superior tone ; "
69903	69907	69901	69901	Biddy	188	" I repeated . "
69921	69922	69924	69924	you	188	" "
69932	69937	69924	69924	you	188	" returned poor Biddy , "
69988	70184	69980	69981	a gentleman	4657	" said Biddy , turning away her head . I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which sentiment , waiving its application , I have since seen reason to think I was right , and I walked down the little path away from Biddy , and Biddy went into the house , and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper - time ; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this , the second night of my bright fortunes , should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first . But , morning once more brightened my view , and I extended my clemency to Biddy , and we dropped the subject . Putting on the best clothes I had , I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open , and presented myself before Mr. Trabb , the tailor , who was having his breakfast in the parlor behind his shop , and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me , but called me in to him . "
70187	70205	69980	69981	a gentleman	4657	" said Mr. Trabb , in a hail - fellow - well - met kind of way . "
70218	70302	70303	70304	Mr. Trabb	243	" Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather - beds , and was slipping butter in between the blankets , and covering it up . He was a prosperous old bachelor , and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard , and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace , and I did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags . "
70306	70310	70303	70304	Mr. Trabb	243	" said I , "
70336	70367	70328	70328	I	0	" A change passed over Mr. Trabb . He forgot the butter in bed , got up from the bedside , and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth , exclaiming , "
70373	70374	70328	70328	I	0	" "
70385	70402	70404	70404	I	0	" said I , casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them ; "
70422	70437	70415	70415	I	0	" I added - otherwise I thought he might only pretend to make them , "
70442	70443	70444	70444	My	0	" "
70448	70478	70444	70444	My	0	" said Mr. Trabb , as he respectfully bent his body , opened his arms , and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow , "
70506	70586	70495	70495	you	1806	" Mr. Trabb 's boy was the most audacious boy in all that country - side . When I had entered he was sweeping the shop , and he had sweetened his labors by sweeping over me . He was still sweeping when I came out into the shop with Mr. Trabb , and he knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles , to express as I understood it equality with any blacksmith , alive or dead . "
70591	70601	70495	70495	you	1806	" said Mr. Trabb , with the greatest sternness , "
70625	70661	70673	70673	your	1808	" said Mr. Trabb , taking down a roll of cloth , and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter , preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss , "
70699	70771	70694	70695	Number Four	244	" To the boy , and with a dreadfully severe stare ; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant 's brushing me with it , or making some other sign of familiarity . Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again . Then he commanded him to bring number five , and number eight . "
70782	70787	70774	70774	me	0	" said Mr. Trabb , "
70806	70878	70794	70796	you young scoundrel	1811	" Mr. Trabb then bent over number four , and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear , an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry , an article that it would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellow - townsman 's if he might claim me for a fellow - townsman having worn . "
70890	70900	70880	70880	you	1808	" said Mr. Trabb to the boy after that , "
70915	70966	70880	70880	you	1808	" I selected the materials for a suit , with the assistance of Mr. Trabb 's judgment , and re - entered the parlor to be measured . For although Mr. Trabb had my measure already , and had previously been quite contented with it , he said apologetically that it "
70983	71067	70880	70880	you	1808	" So , Mr. Trabb measured and calculated me in the parlor , as if I were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor , and gave himself such a world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains . When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to Mr. Pumblechook 's on the Thursday evening , he said , with his hand upon the parlor lock , "
71124	71381	71421	71421	I	0	" The last word was flung at the boy , who had not the least notion what it meant . But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands , and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was , that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb 's boy . After this memorable event , I went to the hatter 's , and the bootmaker 's , and the hosier 's , and felt rather like Mother Hubbard 's dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades . I also went to the coach - office and took my place for seven o'clock on Saturday morning . It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome property ; but whenever I said anything to that effect , it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the High Street , and concentrated his mind upon me . When I had ordered everything I wanted , I directed my steps towards Pumblechook 's , and , as I approached that gentleman 's place of business , I saw him standing at his door . He was waiting for me with great impatience . He had been out early with the chaise - cart , and had called at the forge and heard the news . He had prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor , and he too ordered his shopman to "
71387	71394	71395	71397	My dear friend	1820	" as my sacred person passed . "
71399	71420	71395	71397	My dear friend	1820	" said Mr. Pumblechook , taking me by both hands , when he and I and the collation were alone , "
71436	71455	71421	71421	I	0	" This was coming to the point , and I thought it a sensible way of expressing himself . "
71459	71473	71421	71421	I	0	" said Mr. Pumblechook , after snorting admiration at me for some moments , "
71493	71514	71515	71515	My	0	" I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted , on that point . "
71520	71525	71515	71515	My	0	" said Mr. Pumblechook ; "
71536	71539	71527	71527	you	1820	" I murmured "
71542	71574	71527	71527	you	1820	" and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again , and communicated a movement to his waistcoat , which had an emotional appearance , though it was rather low down , "
71604	71617	71618	71618	Joseph	154	" said Mr. Pumblechook , in the way of a compassionate adjuration . "
71625	71643	71621	71621	Joseph	154	" Thereupon he shook his head and tapped it , expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph . "
71650	71655	71645	71648	my dear young friend	1821	" said Mr. Pumblechook , "
71714	71756	71712	71712	I	0	" said Mr. Pumblechook , getting up again the moment after he had sat down , ' see afore me , him as I ever sported with in his times of happy infancy ? And may I - may I - ? "
71781	71786	71788	71789	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" Here is wine , "
71791	71818	71820	71821	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" Let us drink , Thanks to Fortune , and may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment ! And yet I can not , "
71850	71947	71847	71847	I	0	" I said he might , and he shook hands with me again , and emptied his glass and turned it upside down . I did the same ; and if I had turned myself upside down before drinking , the wine could not have gone more direct to my head . Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing , and to the best slice of tongue none of those out - of - the - way No Thoroughfares of Pork now , and took , comparatively speaking , no care of himself at all . "
71958	71970	71954	71954	You	0	" said Mr. Pumblechook , apostrophizing the fowl in the dish , "
72010	72019	72007	72007	you	0	" said Mr. Pumblechook , getting up again , "
72028	72069	72025	72025	I	0	" It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might , so he did it at once . How he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife , I do n't know . "
72074	72084	72025	72025	I	0	" he resumed , after a little steady eating , "
72118	72135	72136	72136	We	1827	" I saw he was about to come at me again , and I stopped him . "
72142	72145	72136	72136	We	1827	" said I. "
72148	72164	72169	72169	you	0	" cried Mr. Pumblechook , leaning back in his chair , quite flaccid with admiration , "
72175	72199	72169	72169	you	0	" I do n't know who Sir was , but he certainly was not I , and there was no third person present ; "
72222	72241	72204	72204	you	0	" said the servile Pumblechook , putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again , "
72258	72275	72255	72255	I	0	" When he had done it , he resumed his seat and drank to my sister . "
72282	72287	72289	72289	her	1834	" said Mr. Pumblechook , "
72304	72750	72300	72300	she	1834	" At about this time , I began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face ; as to myself , I felt all face , steeped in wine and smarting . I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes sent to his house , and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him . I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village , and he lauded it to the skies . There was nobody but himself , he intimated , worthy of my confidence , and - in short , might he ? Then he asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums , and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice , and , in effect , how he had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend ? If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had , I should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me , and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea . Yet for all that , I remember feeling convinced that I had been much mistaken in him , and that he was a sensible , practical , good - hearted prime fellow . By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me , as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs . He mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises , if enlarged , such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighborhood . What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune , he considered to be More Capital . Those were the two little words , more capital . Now it appeared to him Pumblechook that if that capital were got into the business , through a sleeping partner , sir , - which sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in , by self or deputy , whenever he pleased , and examine the books , - and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his pocket , to the tune of fifty per cent , - it appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property , which would be worthy of his attention . But what did I think ? He had great confidence in my opinion , and what did I think ? I gave it as my opinion . "
72755	72867	72300	72300	she	1834	" The united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him , that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me , but said he really must , - and did . We drank all the wine , and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep Joseph up to the mark I do n't know what mark , and to render me efficient and constant service I do n't know what service . He also made known to me for the first time in my life , and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well , that he had always said of me , "
72889	72998	72884	72886	no common fortun	1837	" He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now , and I said so too . Finally , I went out into the air , with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine , and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road . There , I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook 's hailing me . He was a long way down the sunny street , and was making expressive gestures for me to stop . I stopped , and he came up breathless . "
73005	73017	72884	72886	no common fortun	1837	" said he , when he had recovered wind for speech . "
73054	73483	73484	73484	You	1841	" We shook hands for the hundredth time at least , and he ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation . Then , he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road ; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home . I had scant luggage to take with me to London , for little of the little I possessed was adapted to my new station . But I began packing that same afternoon , and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next morning , in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost . So , Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday , passed ; and on Friday morning I went to Mr. Pumblechook 's , to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to Miss Havisham . Mr. Pumblechook 's own room was given up to me to dress in , and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event . My clothes were rather a disappointment , of course . Probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in , fell a trifle short of the wearer 's expectation . But after I had had my new suit on some half an hour , and had gone through an immensity of posturing with Mr. Pumblechook 's very limited dressing - glass , in the futile endeavor to see my legs , it seemed to fit me better . It being market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off , Mr. Pumblechook was not at home . I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave , and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing . This was all as it should be , and I went out in my new array , fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman , and suspicious after all that I was at a personal disadvantage , something like Joe 's in his Sunday suit . I went circuitously to Miss Havisham 's by all the back ways , and rang at the bell constrainedly , on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves . Sarah Pocket came to the gate , and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed ; her walnut - shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow . "
73486	73490	73491	73491	You	1841	" said she . "
73501	73502	73498	73498	you	1841	" "
73512	73516	73509	73510	Miss Pocket	208	" said I , "
73527	73627	73524	73525	Miss Havisham	223	" I was not expected , for she left me locked in the yard , while she went to ask if I were to be admitted . After a very short delay , she returned and took me up , staring at me all the way . Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table , leaning on her crutch stick . The room was lighted as of yore , and at the sound of our entrance , she stopped and turned . She was then just abreast of the rotted bride - cake . "
73634	73638	73632	73632	Sarah	208	" she said . "
73643	73644	73641	73641	Pip	241	" "
73657	73666	73650	73651	Miss Havisham	223	" I was exceedingly careful what I said , "
73681	73682	73670	73670	you	223	" "
73691	73721	73689	73689	Pip	241	" said she , making her crutch stick play round me , as if she , the fairy godmother who had changed me , were bestowing the finishing gift . "
73738	73742	73735	73736	Miss Havisham	223	" I murmured . "
73754	73755	73751	73752	Miss Havisham	223	" "
73760	73775	73751	73752	Miss Havisham	223	" said she , looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah , with delight . "
73797	73798	73801	73802	Miss Havisham	223	" "
73804	73805	73801	73802	Miss Havisham	223	" "
73815	73816	73819	73820	Miss Havisham	223	" "
73822	73823	73819	73820	Miss Havisham	223	" "
73827	73828	73831	73832	Miss Havisham	223	" "
73834	73835	73831	73832	Miss Havisham	223	" "
73844	73845	73848	73849	Miss Havisham	223	" "
73851	73873	73848	73849	Miss Havisham	223	" She quite gloated on these questions and answers , so keen was her enjoyment of Sarah Pocket 's jealous dismay . "
73876	73881	73848	73849	Miss Havisham	223	" she went on ; "
73904	73929	73899	73900	Mr. Jaggers	237	" She looked at me , and looked at Sarah , and Sarah 's countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile . "
73948	73949	73952	73953	Miss Havisham	223	" "
73955	73956	73952	73953	Miss Havisham	223	" "
73962	74093	73960	73960	Pip	241	" She stretched out her hand , and I went down on my knee and put it to my lips . I had not considered how I should take leave of her ; it came naturally to me at the moment to do this . She looked at Sarah Pocket with triumph in her weird eyes , and so I left my fairy godmother , with both her hands on her crutch stick , standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride - cake that was hidden in cobwebs . Sarah Pocket conducted me down , as if I were a ghost who must be seen out . She could not get over my appearance , and was in the last degree confounded . I said "
74100	74687	74097	74098	Miss Pocket	208	" but she merely stared , and did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken . Clear of the house , I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook 's , took off my new clothes , made them into a bundle , and went back home in my older dress , carrying it - to speak the truth - much more at my ease too , though I had the bundle to carry . And now , those six days which were to have run out so slowly , had run out fast and were gone , and to - morrow looked me in the face more steadily than I could look at it . As the six evenings had dwindled away , to five , to four , to three , to two , I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy . On this last evening , I dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight , and sat in my splendor until bedtime . We had a hot supper on the occasion , graced by the inevitable roast fowl , and we had some flip to finish with . We were all very low , and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits . I was to leave our village at five in the morning , carrying my little hand - portmanteau , and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all alone . I am afraid - sore afraid - that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe , if we went to the coach together . I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement ; but when I went up to my little room on this last night , I felt compelled to admit that it might be so , and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in the morning . I did not . All night there were coaches in my broken sleep , going to wrong places instead of to London , and having in the traces , now dogs , now cats , now pigs , now men , - never horses . Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing . Then , I got up and partly dressed , and sat at the window to take a last look out , and in taking it fell asleep . Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast , that , although I did not sleep at the window an hour , I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon . But long after that , and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready , I wanted the resolution to go down stairs . After all , I remained up there , repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again , until Biddy called to me that I was late . It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it . I got up from the meal , saying with a sort of briskness , as if it had only just occurred to me , "
74697	74800	74690	74690	I	0	" and then I kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair , and kissed Biddy , and threw my arms around Joe 's neck . Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out . The last I saw of them was , when I presently heard a scuffle behind me , and looking back , saw Joe throwing an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe . I stopped then , to wave my hat , and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head , crying huskily "
74803	74954	74690	74690	I	0	" and Biddy put her apron to her face . I walked away at a good pace , thinking it was easier to go than I had supposed it would be , and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach , in sight of all the High Street . I whistled and made nothing of going . But the village was very peaceful and quiet , and the light mists were solemnly rising , as if to show me the world , and I had been so innocent and little there , and all beyond was so unknown and great , that in a moment with a strong heave and sob I broke into tears . It was by the finger - post at the end of the village , and I laid my hand upon it , and said , "
74965	75380	74690	74690	I	0	" Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears , for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth , overlying our hard hearts . I was better after I had cried than before , - more sorry , more aware of my own ingratitude , more gentle . If I had cried before , I should have had Joe with me then . So subdued I was by those tears , and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk , that when I was on the coach , and it was clear of the town , I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed horses and walk back , and have another evening at home , and a better parting . We changed , and I had not made up my mind , and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back , when we changed again . And while I was occupied with these deliberations , I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us , and my heart would beat high . - As if he could possibly be there ! We changed again , and yet again , and it was now too late and too far to go back , and I went on . And the mists had all solemnly risen now , and the world lay spread before me . This is the end of the first stage of Pip 's expectations . Chapter XX The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hours . It was a little past midday when the four - horse stage - coach by which I was a passenger , got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys , Wood Street , Cheapside , London . We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything : otherwise , while I was scared by the immensity of London , I think I might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly , crooked , narrow , and dirty . Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address ; it was , Little Britain , and he had written after it on his card , "
75394	75621	74690	74690	I	0	" Nevertheless , a hackney - coachman , who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy great - coat as he was years old , packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps , as if he were going to take me fifty miles . His getting on his box , which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather - stained pea - green hammercloth moth - eaten into rags , was quite a work of time . It was a wonderful equipage , with six great coronets outside , and ragged things behind for I do n't know how many footmen to hold on by , and a harrow below them , to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation . I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw - yard it was , and yet how like a rag - shop , and to wonder why the horses ' nose - bags were kept inside , when I observed the coachman beginning to get down , as if we were going to stop presently . And stop we presently did , in a gloomy street , at certain offices with an open door , whereon was painted MR . JAGGERS . "
75625	75635	74690	74690	I	0	" I asked the coachman . The coachman answered , "
75647	75660	74690	74690	I	0	" I naturally said I had no wish to make it more . "
75668	75673	74690	74690	I	0	" observed the coachman . "
75687	75757	75683	75683	I	0	" He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers 's name , and shook his head . When he had got his shilling , and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box , and had got away which appeared to relieve his mind , I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked , Was Mr. Jaggers at home ? "
75762	75767	75768	75768	He	1848	" returned the clerk . "
75781	75791	75778	75779	Mr. Pip	241	" I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip . "
75841	75899	75905	75905	Mike	249	" With those words , the clerk opened a door , and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back . Here , we found a gentleman with one eye , in a velveteen suit and knee - breeches , who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper . "
75907	76738	75905	75905	Mike	249	" said the clerk . I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting , when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used , and tossing his fur cap out after him , left me alone . Mr. Jaggers 's room was lighted by a skylight only , and was a most dismal place ; the skylight , eccentrically pitched like a broken head , and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it . There were not so many papers about , as I should have expected to see ; and there were some odd objects about , that I should not have expected to see , - such as an old rusty pistol , a sword in a scabbard , several strange - looking boxes and packages , and two dreadful casts on a shelf , of faces peculiarly swollen , and twitchy about the nose . Mr. Jaggers 's own high - backed chair was of deadly black horsehair , with rows of brass nails round it , like a coffin ; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it , and bit his forefinger at the clients . The room was but small , and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall ; the wall , especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers 's chair , being greasy with shoulders . I recalled , too , that the one - eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out . I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers 's chair , and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place . I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else 's disadvantage , as his master had . I wondered how many other clerks there were up - stairs , and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow - creatures . I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room , and how it came there . I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers 's family , and , if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill - looking relations , why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on , instead of giving them a place at home . Of course I had no experience of a London summer day , and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air , and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything . But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr. Jaggers 's close room , until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers 's chair , and got up and went out . When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited , he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into Smithfield . So I came into Smithfield ; and the shameful place , being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam , seemed to stick to me . So , I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul 's bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison . Following the wall of the jail , I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles ; and from this , and from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer , I inferred that the trials were on . While I looked about me here , an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial or so : informing me that he could give me a front place for half a crown , whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in his wig and robes , - mentioning that awful personage like waxwork , and presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen - pence . As I declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment , he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept , and also where people were publicly whipped , and then he showed me the Debtors ' Door , out of which culprits came to be hanged ; heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that "
76742	76955	76956	76956	Jaggers	237	" would come out at that door the day after to - morrow at eight in the morning , to be killed in a row . This was horrible , and gave me a sickening idea of London ; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice 's proprietor wore from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pocket - handkerchief inclusive mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him originally , and which I took it into my head he had bought cheap of the executioner . Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling . I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet , and I found he had not , and I strolled out again . This time , I made the tour of Little Britain , and turned into Bartholomew Close ; and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers , as well as I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close , and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together , one of whom said to the other when they first passed me , that "
76967	77013	77014	77014	Jaggers	237	" There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner , and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl , and the other comforted her by saying , as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders , "
77029	77107	77026	77026	you	251	" There was a red - eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there , in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand ; and while the messenger was gone , I remarked this Jew , who was of a highly excitable temperament , performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp - post and accompanying himself , in a kind of frenzy , with the words , "
77126	77240	77118	77120	Cag - Maggerth	253	" These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me , and I admired and wondered more than ever . At length , as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into Little Britain , I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards me . All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time , and there was quite a rush at him . Mr. Jaggers , putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me , addressed himself to his followers . First , he took the two secret men . "
77251	77262	77243	77243	I	0	" said Mr. Jaggers , throwing his finger at them . "
77303	77304	77299	77299	you	1851	" "
77315	77333	77305	77305	We	1852	" said one of the men , submissively , while the other perused Mr. Jaggers 's face . "
77362	77363	77358	77358	Wemmick	254	" "
77368	77375	77366	77366	sir	4451	" said both the men together . "
77392	77408	77386	77386	I	0	" said Mr Jaggers , waving his hand at them to put them behind him . "
77424	77425	77426	77426	We	1855	" "
77432	77444	77426	77426	We	1855	" one of the men began , pulling off his hat . "
77455	77460	77461	77461	You	1851	" said Mr. Jaggers . "
77510	77536	77539	77539	you	1851	" The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind again , and humbly fell back and were heard no more . "
77541	77569	77539	77539	you	1851	" said Mr. Jaggers , suddenly stopping , and turning on the two women with the shawls , from whom the three men had meekly separated , - "
77577	77578	77572	77572	Amelia	255	" "
77584	77585	77581	77582	Mr. Jaggers	237	" "
77591	77596	77588	77588	you	1851	" retorted Mr. Jaggers , "
77612	77613	77601	77601	you	1851	" "
77619	77625	77617	77617	sir	4451	" exclaimed both women together . "
77637	77638	77628	77628	you	4451	" "
77642	77647	77617	77617	sir	4451	" said Mr. Jaggers , "
77653	77654	77649	77649	you	1851	" "
77660	77666	77658	77658	sir	4451	" the crying woman pleaded . "
77674	77679	77669	77669	I	0	" said Mr. Jaggers . "
77736	77737	77732	77732	you	1851	" "
77746	77747	77743	77744	Every farden	1863	" "
77779	77818	77819	77819	I	0	" This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately . No one remained now but the excitable Jew , who had already raised the skirts of Mr. Jaggers 's coat to his lips several times . "
77826	77837	77823	77824	this man	581	" said Mr. Jaggers , in the same devastating strain : "
77844	77845	77846	77849	Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth	252	" "
77857	77858	77861	77861	he	581	" "
77863	77868	77861	77861	he	581	" said Mr. Jaggers . "
77875	77892	77861	77861	he	581	" The suitor , kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it , replied , "
77901	77902	77893	77894	Habraham Latharuth	256	" "
77908	77913	77914	77914	I	0	" said Mr. Jaggers . "
77920	77921	77922	77923	Holy father	1866	" "
77928	77937	77893	77894	Habraham Latharuth	256	" cried my excitable acquaintance , turning white , "
77947	77948	77949	77949	I	0	" "
77952	77957	77949	77949	I	0	" said Mr. Jaggers , "
77972	77973	77974	77975	Mithter Jaggerth	252	" "
78042	78092	78036	78037	Mithter Jaggerth	252	" My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference , and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot . Without further interruption , we reached the front office , where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap . "
78097	78114	78095	78095	Mike	249	" said the clerk , getting down from his stool , and approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially . "
78117	78154	78155	78156	your man	1870	" said Mr. Jaggers , turning to the man , who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his forehead , like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the bell - rope ; "
78164	78165	78155	78156	your man	1870	" "
78171	78186	78168	78169	Mas'r Jaggers	257	" returned Mike , in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold ; "
78205	78206	78199	78199	sir	4451	" "
78214	78215	78209	78209	he	1870	" "
78221	78235	78218	78219	Mas'r Jaggers	257	" said Mike , wiping his nose on his fur cap this time ; "
78243	78251	78218	78219	Mas'r Jaggers	257	" Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate . "
78259	78271	78254	78254	I	0	" said he , throwing his forefinger at the terrified client , "
78303	78323	78298	78298	you	1872	" The client looked scared , but bewildered too , as if he were unconscious what he had done . "
78326	78344	78324	78324	Spooney	258	" said the clerk , in a low voice , giving him a stir with his elbow . "
78356	78357	78349	78349	you	1872	" "
78368	78376	78364	78364	you	1872	" said my guardian , very sternly , "
78397	78422	78386	78391	the man you have brought here	1874	" Mike looked hard at my guardian , as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face , and slowly replied , "
78444	78445	78386	78391	the man you have brought here	1874	" "
78460	78500	78501	78501	We	1877	" Mike looked at his cap , and looked at the floor , and looked at the ceiling , and looked at the clerk , and even looked at me , before beginning to reply in a nervous manner , "
78508	78516	78501	78501	We	1877	" when my guardian blustered out , - "
78525	78526	78523	78523	you	1872	" "
78529	78552	78553	78553	He	581	" added the clerk again , with another stir . After some helpless casting about , Mike brightened and began again : - "
78570	78571	78562	78568	A sort of a pastry - cook	1879	" "
78576	78581	78582	78582	I	0	" asked my guardian . "
78586	78590	78562	78568	A sort of a pastry - cook	1879	" said Mike , "
78600	78601	78582	78582	I	0	" "
78614	78694	78582	78582	I	0	" The window indicated was the office window . We all three went to it , behind the wire blind , and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner , with a murderous - looking tall individual , in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap . This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober , and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery , which was painted over . "
78704	78716	78582	78582	I	0	" said my guardian to the clerk , in extreme disgust , "
78731	78788	78721	78721	he	581	" My guardian then took me into his own room , and while he lunched , standing , from a sandwich - box and a pocket - flask of sherry he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it , informed me what arrangements he had made for me . I was to go to "
78793	78911	78721	78721	he	581	" to young Mr. Pocket 's rooms , where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation ; I was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday ; on Monday I was to go with him to his father 's house on a visit , that I might try how I liked it . Also , I was told what my allowance was to be , - it was a very liberal one , - and had handed to me from one of my guardian 's drawers , the cards of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes , and such other things as I could in reason want . "
78922	78943	78919	78920	Mr. Pip	241	" said my guardian , whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole caskful , as he hastily refreshed himself , "
78986	79104	79105	79105	I	0	" After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment , I asked Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach ? He said it was not worth while , I was so near my destination ; Wemmick should walk round with me , if I pleased . I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room . Another clerk was rung down from up stairs to take his place while he was out , and I accompanied him into the street , after shaking hands with my guardian . We found a new set of people lingering outside , but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively , "
79126	79387	79113	79113	he	0	" and we soon got clear of them , and went on side by side . Chapter XXI Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along , to see what he was like in the light of day , I found him to be a dry man , rather short in stature , with a square wooden face , whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull - edged chisel . There were some marks in it that might have been dimples , if the material had been softer and the instrument finer , but which , as it was , were only dints . The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose , but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off . I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen , and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements ; for he wore at least four mourning rings , besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it . I noticed , too , that several rings and seals hung at his watch - chain , as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends . He had glittering eyes , - small , keen , and black , - and thin wide mottled lips . He had had them , to the best of my belief , from forty to fifty years . "
79396	79403	79389	79389	you	1886	" said Mr. Wemmick to me . "
79406	79409	79389	79389	you	1886	" said I. "
79416	79421	79410	79410	I	0	" said Mr. Wemmick . "
79428	79429	79410	79410	I	0	" "
79438	79439	79430	79430	You	1886	" "
79444	79449	79430	79430	You	1886	" said Mr. Wemmick . "
79457	79458	79450	79450	I	0	" "
79466	79481	79482	79482	You	1886	" I asked , more for the sake of saying something than for information . "
79509	79510	79499	79500	people anywhere	1889	" "
79521	79532	79499	79500	people anywhere	1889	" said I , to soften it off a little . "
79543	79548	79535	79535	I	0	" returned Mr. Wemmick ; "
79572	79573	79557	79557	They	1890	" "
79579	79580	79581	79581	You	1886	" "
79585	79590	79581	79581	You	1886	" returned Mr. Wemmick . "
79600	79687	79581	79581	You	1886	" He wore his hat on the back of his head , and looked straight before him : walking in a self - contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention . His mouth was such a post - office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling . We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance , and that he was not smiling at all . "
79697	79703	79692	79694	Mr. Matthew Pocket	211	" I asked Mr. Wemmick . "
79706	79715	79692	79694	Mr. Matthew Pocket	211	" said he , nodding in the direction . "
79723	79724	79692	79694	Mr. Matthew Pocket	211	" "
79729	79730	79692	79694	Mr. Matthew Pocket	211	" "
79737	79738	79692	79694	Mr. Matthew Pocket	211	" "
79744	79745	79740	79740	you	0	" "
79756	79769	79748	79748	you	0	" said Mr. Wemmick , looking at me with an approving air . "
79780	80172	79778	79778	him	211	" There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these words that rather depressed me ; and I was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text , when he said here we were at Barnard 's Inn . My depression was not alleviated by the announcement , for , I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard , to which the Blue Boar in our town was a mere public - house . Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit , or a fiction , and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tom - cats . We entered this haven through a wicket - gate , and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying - ground . I thought it had the most dismal trees in it , and the most dismal sparrows , and the most dismal cats , and the most dismal houses in number half a dozen or so , that I had ever seen . I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain , crippled flower - pot , cracked glass , dusty decay , and miserable makeshift ; while To Let , To Let , To Let , glared at me from empty rooms , as if no new wretches ever came there , and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel . A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard , and it had strewn ashes on its head , and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust - hole . Thus far my sense of sight ; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar , - rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching - stables near at hand besides - addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell , and moaned , "
80178	80201	80174	80174	Barnard	260	" So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations , that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick . "
80204	80211	80174	80174	Barnard	260	" said he , mistaking me ; "
80225	80313	80223	80223	me	0	" He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs , - which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust , so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming down , - to a set of chambers on the top floor . MR . POCKET , JUN . , was painted on the door , and there was a label on the letter - box , "
80317	80318	80319	80319	He	0	" "
80328	80333	80319	80319	He	0	" Mr. Wemmick explained . "

80381	80417	80347	80347	you	0	" I put out my hand , and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought I wanted something . Then he looked at me , and said , correcting himself , - "
80433	80453	80424	80424	You	1893	" I was rather confused , thinking it must be out of the London fashion , but said yes . "
80462	80468	80454	80454	I	0	" said Mr. Wemmick , - "
80488	80686	80687	80688	Mr. Pip	241	" When we had shaken hands and he was gone , I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself , for , the lines had rotted away , and it came down like the guillotine . Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out . After this escape , I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window 's encrusting dirt , and to stand dolefully looking out , saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated . Mr. Pocket , Junior 's , idea of Shortly was not mine , for I had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour , and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window , before I heard footsteps on the stairs . Gradually there arose before me the hat , head , neckcloth , waistcoat , trousers , boots , of a member of society of about my own standing . He had a paper - bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand , and was out of breath . "
80690	80694	80687	80688	Mr. Pip	241	" said he . "
80698	80701	80695	80696	Mr. Pocket	262	" said I. "
80705	80709	80695	80696	Mr. Pocket	262	" he exclaimed . "
80792	80828	80781	80781	I	0	" For a reason that I had , I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head . I acknowledged his attention incoherently , and began to think this was a dream . "
80832	80839	80781	80781	I	0	" said Mr. Pocket , Junior . "
80845	80953	80781	80781	I	0	" As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while the paper - bags were under his arms , I begged him to allow me to hold them . He relinquished them with an agreeable smile , and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast . It yielded so suddenly at last , that he staggered back upon me , and I staggered back upon the opposite door , and we both laughed . But still I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head , and as if this must be a dream . "
80958	80965	80967	80967	me	0	" said Mr. Pocket , Junior . "
81287	81333	81282	81282	I	0	" As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket , Junior , delivering him the bags , One , Two , I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to be in mine , and he said , falling back , - "
81344	81345	81338	81338	you	1900	" "
81349	81353	81347	81347	you	1900	" said I , "
81360	81385	81355	81358	the pale young gentleman	1311	" Chapter XXII The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in Barnard 's Inn , until we both burst out laughing . "
81393	81397	81355	81358	the pale young gentleman	1311	" said he . "
81405	81420	81403	81403	you	1900	" said I. And then we contemplated one another afresh , and laughed again . "
81423	81438	81456	81456	you	1900	" said the pale young gentleman , reaching out his hand good - humoredly , "
81467	81508	81459	81459	me	0	" I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket for Herbert was the pale young gentleman 's name still rather confounded his intention with his execution . But I made a modest reply , and we shook hands warmly . "
81521	81526	81509	81509	You	1900	" said Herbert Pocket . "
81529	81532	81509	81509	You	1900	" said I. "
81535	81539	81540	81540	I	0	" he acquiesced : "
81559	81560	81548	81548	I	0	" "
81563	81564	81586	81586	she	223	" "
81599	81614	81595	81595	she	223	" I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that . "
81618	81624	81595	81595	she	223	" said Herbert , laughing , "
81676	81677	81667	81667	you	1916	" "
81682	81720	81667	81667	you	1916	" I asked , with sudden gravity . He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked , which divided his attention , and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word . "
81723	81733	81667	81667	you	1916	" he explained , still busy with the fruit . "
81750	81751	81740	81740	his	1919	" "
81759	81763	81754	81754	you	0	" I asked . "
81766	81770	81754	81754	you	0	" said he , "
81784	81785	81779	81779	She	195	" "
81789	81790	81786	81787	Miss Havisham	223	" "
81834	81835	81823	81824	Miss Havisham	223	" "
81844	81845	81841	81842	Miss Havisham	223	" "
81848	81852	81853	81854	Only adopted	1923	" said he . "
81856	81857	81853	81854	Only adopted	1923	" "
81872	81873	81874	81874	Lord	1925	" "
81879	81883	81876	81877	Mr. Pip	241	" said he . "
81889	81890	81886	81886	you	241	" "
81893	81896	81886	81886	you	241	" said I. "
81937	81986	81930	81930	you	241	" I told him , and he was attentive until I had finished , and then burst out laughing again , and asked me if I was sore afterwards ? I did n't ask him if he was , for my conviction on that point was perfectly established . "
81996	82001	81987	81988	Mr. Jaggers	237	" he went on . "
82004	82005	81987	81988	Mr. Jaggers	237	" "
82028	82092	82093	82093	He	237	" This was bringing me I felt towards dangerous ground . I answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise , that I had seen Mr. Jaggers in Miss Havisham 's house on the very day of our combat , but never at any other time , and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there . "
82159	82510	82148	82148	he	400	" Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking . I had never seen any one then , and I have never seen any one since , who more strongly expressed to me , in every look and tone , a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean . There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air , and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich . I do n't know how this was . I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner , but I can not define by what means . He was still a pale young gentleman , and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness , that did not seem indicative of natural strength . He had not a handsome face , but it was better than handsome : being extremely amiable and cheerful . His figure was a little ungainly , as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it , but it looked as if it would always be light and young . Whether Mr. Trabb 's local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me , may be a question ; but I am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit . As he was so communicative , I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years . I therefore told him my small story , and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was . I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place , and knew very little of the ways of politeness , I would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong . "
82514	82518	82148	82148	he	400	" said he , "
82573	82594	82554	82554	you	1941	" I thanked him and said I would . I informed him in exchange that my Christian name was Philip . "
82602	82608	82595	82595	I	0	" said he , smiling , "
82711	82712	82702	82703	a blacksmith	4506	" "
82722	82726	82713	82713	I	0	" I answered , "
82734	82735	82728	82728	I	0	" "
82760	82761	82762	82762	I	0	" "
82769	82770	82762	82762	I	0	" "
82777	82788	82775	82775	Handel	266	" said he , turning round as the door opened , "
82816	83066	83087	83087	Handel	266	" This I would not hear of , so he took the top , and I faced him . It was a nice little dinner , - seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor 's Feast , - and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances , with no old people by , and with London all around us . This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off ; for while the table was , as Mr. Pumblechook might have said , the lap of luxury , - being entirely furnished forth from the coffee - house , - the circumjacent region of sitting - room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character ; imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor where he fell over them , the melted butter in the arm - chair , the bread on the bookshelves , the cheese in the coal - scuttle , and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room , - where I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired for the night . All this made the feast delightful , and when the waiter was not there to watch me , my pleasure was without alloy . We had made some progress in the dinner , when I reminded Herbert of his promise to tell me about Miss Havisham . "
83069	83073	83087	83087	Handel	266	" he replied . "
83206	83227	83186	83186	you	1950	" He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way , that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed . "
83230	83234	83236	83237	Miss Havisham	223	" he pursued , "
83334	83335	83328	83328	You	1950	" "
83350	83353	83348	83348	he	4657	" said I. "
83359	83363	83348	83348	he	4657	" returned Herbert ; "
83390	83391	83387	83388	his daughter	1964	" "
83399	83403	83387	83388	his daughter	1964	" I hazarded . "
83443	83444	83436	83437	his cook	1969	" "
83451	83454	83447	83447	he	1954	" said I. "
83617	83643	83569	83570	Miss Havisham	223	" I had been doing this , in an excess of attention to his recital . I thanked him , and apologized . He said , "
83648	83652	83569	83570	Miss Havisham	223	" and resumed . "
83772	83837	83842	83842	I	0	" Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler , I am wholly unable to say . I only know that I found myself , with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause , making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits . Again I thanked him and apologized , and again he said in the cheerfullest manner , "
83846	83850	83842	83842	I	0	" and resumed . "
84254	84262	84263	84263	Matthew	211	" I thought of her having said , "
84280	84294	84263	84263	Matthew	211	" and I asked Herbert whether his father was so inveterate against her ? "
84300	84304	84306	84306	she	223	" said he , "
84410	84411	84404	84404	He	211	" "
84416	84421	84404	84404	He	211	" I struck in , "
84436	84437	84404	84404	He	211	" "
84444	84450	84453	84453	she	223	" said Herbert , nodding , "
84524	84525	84499	84499	she	223	" "
84532	84540	84499	84499	she	223	" I asked , after considering it . "
84642	84643	84646	84646	he	2021	" "
84657	84660	84646	84646	he	2021	" said I. "
84685	84689	84669	84669	her	223	" said Herbert . "
84698	84699	84692	84692	I	0	" "
84707	84717	84718	84718	They	5588	" I asked , after again considering the subject . "
84735	84736	84718	84718	They	5588	" "
84742	84743	84744	84744	I	0	" "
84749	84750	84751	84751	You	0	" "
84770	84776	84751	84751	You	0	" Herbert shrugged his shoulders . "
84803	84816	84801	84801	Handel	266	" said he , finally throwing off the story as it were , "
84837	84838	84834	84834	you	0	" "
84845	84849	84850	84850	you	0	" I retorted , "
84853	84854	84850	84850	you	0	" "
84933	85078	85079	85080	A capitalist	2027	" In truth , he said this with so much delicacy , that I felt the subject done with , even though I should be under his father 's roof for years and years to come . Yet he said it with so much meaning , too , that I felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress , as I understood the fact myself . It had not occurred to me before , that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way ; but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it , that I now perceived this to be the case . We were very gay and sociable , and I asked him , in the course of conversation , what he was ? He replied , "
85088	85113	85079	85080	A capitalist	2027	" I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping , or capital , for he added , "
85118	85190	85191	85191	I	0	" I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the City , and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer on his back , blackened his enterprising eye , and cut his responsible head open . But again there came upon me , for my relief , that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich . "
85256	85266	85250	85250	I	0	" said he , leaning back in his chair , "
85293	85294	85250	85250	I	0	" "
85301	85304	85250	85250	I	0	" said I. "
85307	85327	85328	85328	I	0	" said he . I wavered again , and began to think here were greater expectations than my own . "
85336	85350	85330	85330	I	0	" said he , putting his thumbs in his waist - coat pockets , "
85374	85375	85376	85376	You	0	" "
85384	85387	85376	85376	You	0	" said I. "
85392	85419	85420	85420	I	0	" said he . Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions , I asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present ? "
85427	85431	85420	85420	I	0	" he replied . "
85438	85460	85432	85432	I	0	" Somehow , that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard 's Inn . I said in a tone of conviction , "
85465	85466	85432	85432	I	0	" "
85482	85483	85469	85469	I	0	" "
85491	85495	85469	85469	I	0	" I asked . "
85510	85517	85499	85499	you	0	" he asked , in reply . "
85523	85524	85499	85499	you	0	" "
85535	85552	85499	85499	you	0	" He said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance . "
85575	85612	85499	85499	you	0	" This certainly had not a profitable appearance , and I shook my head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income . "
85618	85623	85625	85625	you	0	" said Herbert Pocket , "
85653	85689	85648	85648	you	0	" It struck me as a singular implication that you could n't be out of a counting - house , you know , and look about you ; but I silently deferred to his experience . "
85695	85699	85701	85701	you	0	" said Herbert , "
85745	86549	86550	86550	Mamma	2036	" This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden ; very like . His manner of bearing his poverty , too , exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat . It seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then . It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries , for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee - house or somewhere else . Yet , having already made his fortune in his own mind , he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up . It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways , and we got on famously . In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets , and went half - price to the Theatre ; and next day we went to church at Westminster Abbey , and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks ; and I wondered who shod all the horses there , and wished Joe did . On a moderate computation , it was many months , that Sunday , since I had left Joe and Biddy . The space interposed between myself and them partook of that expansion , and our marshes were any distance off . That I could have been at our old church in my old church - going clothes , on the very last Sunday that ever was , seemed a combination of impossibilities , geographical and social , solar and lunar . Yet in the London streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening , there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away ; and in the dead of night , the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard 's Inn , under pretence of watching it , fell hollow on my heart . On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine , Herbert went to the counting - house to report himself , - to look about him , too , I suppose , - and I bore him company . He was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to Hammersmith , and I was to wait about for him . It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat , like the eggs of ostriches , judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning . Nor did the counting - house where Herbert assisted , show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory ; being a back second floor up a yard , of a grimy presence in all particulars , and with a look into another back second floor , rather than a look out . I waited about until it was noon , and I went upon ' Change , and I saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping , whom I took to be great merchants , though I could n't understand why they should all be out of spirits . When Herbert came , we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated , but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe , and where I could not help noticing , even then , that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters ' clothes , than in the steaks . This collation disposed of at a moderate price considering the grease , which was not charged for , we went back to Barnard 's Inn and got my little portmanteau , and then took coach for Hammersmith . We arrived there at two or three o'clock in the afternoon , and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket 's house . Lifting the latch of a gate , we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river , where Mr. Pocket 's children were playing about . And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned , I saw that Mr. and Mrs. Pocket 's children were not growing up or being brought up , but were tumbling up . Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree , reading , with her legs upon another garden chair ; and Mrs. Pocket 's two nurse - maids were looking about them while the children played . "
86552	86556	86550	86550	Mamma	2036	" said Herbert , "
86563	86577	86560	86561	Mr. Pip	241	" Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity . "
86584	86596	86560	86561	Mr. Pip	241	" cried one of the nurses to two of the children , "
86625	86642	86620	86621	your pa	2040	" At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket 's handkerchief , and said , "
86657	86666	86655	86655	Mum	174	" Upon which Mrs. Pocket laughed and said , "
86672	86725	86670	86670	Flopson	271	" and settling herself in one chair only , resumed her book . Her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week , but before she could have read half a dozen lines , she fixed her eyes upon me , and said , "
86734	86792	86728	86729	your mamma	2042	" This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments , when the nurse came to my rescue . "
86795	86806	86865	86865	Flopson	271	" she cried , picking up the pocket - handkerchief , "
86826	86861	86824	86824	Mum	2043	" Mrs. Pocket received her property , at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before , and then with a laugh of recognition , and said , "
86867	86929	86865	86865	Flopson	271	" and forgot me , and went on reading . I found , now I had leisure to count them , that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present , in various stages of tumbling up . I had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard , as in the region of air , wailing dolefully . "
86936	86947	86952	86952	Millers	2044	" said Flopson , appearing to think it most surprising . "
86954	87161	86952	86952	Millers	2044	" Millers , who was the other nurse , retired into the house , and by degrees the child 's wailing was hushed and stopped , as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth . Mrs. Pocket read all the time , and I was curious to know what the book could be . We were waiting , I supposed , for Mr. Pocket to come out to us ; at any rate we waited there , and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs. Pocket in their play , they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her , - always very much to her momentary astonishment , and their own more enduring lamentation . I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance , and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it , until by and by Millers came down with the baby , which baby was handed to Flopson , which Flopson was handing it to Mrs. Pocket , when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket , baby and all , and was caught by Herbert and myself . "
87167	87180	87163	87163	me	0	" said Mrs. Pocket , looking off her book for a moment , "
87185	87186	87188	87188	you	0	" "
87194	87204	87192	87192	Mum	174	" returned Flopson , very red in the face ; "
87211	87212	87207	87207	you	0	" "
87219	87224	87217	87217	Flopson	271	" asked Mrs. Pocket . "
87234	87238	87231	87231	your	0	" cried Flopson . "
87270	87457	87267	87267	your	0	" Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice , and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap , while the other children played about it . This had lasted but a very short time , when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap . Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion , that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down . Under these circumstances , when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house , like a little flock of sheep , and Mr. Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance , I was not much surprised to find that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face , and with his very gray hair disordered on his head , as if he did n't quite see his way to putting anything straight . Chapter XXIII Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me , and he hoped I was not sorry to see him . "
87465	87475	87476	87478	an alarming personage	2048	" he added , with his son 's smile , "
87480	87581	87582	87582	Belinda	274	" He was a young - looking man , in spite of his perplexities and his very gray hair , and his manner seemed quite natural . I use the word natural , in the sense of its being unaffected ; there was something comic in his distraught way , as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so . When he had talked with me a little , he said to Mrs. Pocket , with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows , which were black and handsome , "
87592	87604	87589	87590	Mr. Pip	241	" And she looked up from her book , and said , "
87607	88054	87589	87590	Mr. Pip	241	" She then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind , and asked me if I liked the taste of orange - flower water ? As the question had no bearing , near or remote , on any foregone or subsequent transaction , I consider it to have been thrown out , like her previous approaches , in general conversational condescension . I found out within a few hours , and may mention at once , that Mrs. Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased Knight , who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody 's determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives , - I forget whose , if I ever knew , - the Sovereign 's , the Prime Minister 's , the Lord Chancellor 's , the Archbishop of Canterbury 's , anybody 's , - and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact . I believe he had been knighted himself for storming the English grammar at the point of the pen , in a desperate address engrossed on vellum , on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other , and for handing some Royal Personage either the trowel or the mortar . Be that as it may , he had directed Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title , and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge . So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent , that she had grown up highly ornamental , but perfectly helpless and useless . With her character thus happily formed , in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket : who was also in the first bloom of youth , and not quite decided whether to mount to the Woolsack , or to roof himself in with a mitre . As his doing the one or the other was a mere question of time , he and Mrs. Pocket had taken Time by the forelock when , to judge from its length , it would seem to have wanted cutting , and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent . The judicious parent , having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing , had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle , and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was "
88061	88597	88869	88869	ma'am	698	" Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince 's treasure in the ways of the world ever since , and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest . Still , Mrs. Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity , because she had not married a title ; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach , because he had never got one . Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room : which was a pleasant one , and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for my own private sitting - room . He then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms , and introduced me to their occupants , by name Drummle and Startop . Drummle , an old - looking young man of a heavy order of architecture , was whistling . Startop , younger in years and appearance , was reading and holding his head , as if he thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge . Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else 's hands , that I wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there , until I found this unknown power to be the servants . It was a smooth way of going on , perhaps , in respect of saving trouble ; but it had the appearance of being expensive , for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking , and to keep a deal of company down stairs . They allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket , yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen , - always supposing the boarder capable of self - defence , for , before I had been there a week , a neighboring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted , wrote in to say that she had seen Millers slapping the baby . This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket , who burst into tears on receiving the note , and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbors could n't mind their own business . By degrees I learnt , and chiefly from Herbert , that Mr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge , where he had distinguished himself ; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life , he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder . After grinding a number of dull blades , - of whom it was remarkable that their fathers , when influential , were always going to help him to preferment , but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone , - he had wearied of that poor work and had come to London . Here , after gradually failing in loftier hopes , he had "
88599	88797	88869	88869	ma'am	698	" with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them , and had refurbished divers others for special occasions , and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction , and on such means , added to some very moderate private resources , still maintained the house I saw . Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor ; a widow lady of that highly sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody , blessed everybody , and shed smiles and tears on everybody , according to circumstances . This lady 's name was Mrs. Coiler , and I had the honor of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation . She gave me to understand on the stairs , that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him . That did not extend to me , she told me in a gush of love and confidence at that time , I had known her something less than five minutes ; if they were all like Me , it would be quite another thing . "
88803	88808	88799	88801	dear Mrs. Pocket	268	" said Mrs. Coiler , "
88831	88832	88835	88835	ma'am	698	" "
88837	88855	88857	88857	she	268	" I said , to stop her , for I was afraid she was going to cry . "
88865	88866	88869	88869	ma'am	698	" "
88871	88883	88869	88869	ma'am	698	" I said again , with the same object as before . "
88890	88895	88869	88869	ma'am	698	" said Mrs. Coiler , "
88911	89524	88907	88909	dear Mrs. Pocket	268	" I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher 's time and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket ; but I said nothing , and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manners . It came to my knowledge , through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork , spoon , glasses , and other instruments of self - destruction , that Drummle , whose Christian name was Bentley , was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy . It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the garden was all about titles , and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book , if he ever had come at all . Drummle did n't say much , but in his limited way he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow he spoke as one of the elect , and recognized Mrs. Pocket as a woman and a sister . No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation , and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert ; but it promised to last a long time , when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction . It was , in effect , that the cook had mislaid the beef . To my unutterable amazement , I now , for the first time , saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary , but which made no impression on anybody else , and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest . He laid down the carving - knife and fork , - being engaged in carving , at the moment , - put his two hands into his disturbed hair , and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it . When he had done this , and had not lifted himself up at all , he quietly went on with what he was about . Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me . I liked it for a few moments , but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over . She had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities I had left , which was altogether snaky and fork - tongued ; and when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop who said very little to her , or upon Drummle who said less , I rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table . After dinner the children were introduced , and Mrs. Coiler made admiring comments on their eyes , noses , and legs , - a sagacious way of improving their minds . There were four little girls , and two little boys , besides the baby who might have been either , and the baby 's next successor who was as yet neither . They were brought in by Flopson and Millers , much as though those two non - commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these , while Mrs. Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before , but did n't quite know what to make of them . "
89539	89543	89529	89529	your	2052	" said Flopson . "
89561	89592	89552	89552	you	2052	" Thus advised , Mrs. Pocket took it the other way , and got its head upon the table ; which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion . "
89604	89608	89602	89602	Mum	174	" said Flopson ; "
89621	89924	89925	89925	You	2057	" One of the little girls , a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others , stepped out of her place by me , and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying , and laughed . Then , all the children laughed , and Mr. Pocket who in the meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair laughed , and we all laughed and were glad . Flopson , by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll , then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket 's lap , and gave it the nut - crackers to play with ; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes , and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same . Then , the two nurses left the room , and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner , and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gaming - table . I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket 's falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies , while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine , and , forgetting all about the baby on her lap , who did most appalling things with the nut - crackers . At length little Jane , perceiving its young brains to be imperilled , softly left her place , and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away . Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time , and not approving of this , said to Jane , - "
89940	89941	89942	89942	Mamma	279	" "
89945	89951	89952	89952	baby	5762	" lisped the little girl , "
89960	89961	89952	89952	baby	5762	" "
89969	89974	89964	89964	you	2057	" retorted Mrs. Pocket . "
89985	90011	90012	90012	Belinda	274	" Mrs. Pocket 's dignity was so crushing , that I felt quite abashed , as if I myself had done something to rouse it . "
90014	90027	90030	90030	you	2057	" remonstrated Mr. Pocket , from the other end of the table , "
90044	90045	90035	90035	Jane	270	" "
90054	90059	90046	90046	I	0	" said Mrs. Pocket . "
90077	90078	90067	90067	you	211	" "
90082	90094	90079	90080	Good God	2064	" cried Mr. Pocket , in an outbreak of desolate desperation . "
90113	90114	90115	90115	I	0	" "
90124	90139	90122	90122	Jane	270	" said Mrs. Pocket , with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender . "
90154	90179	90150	90150	Jane	270	" Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again , and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his chair . "
90183	90191	90150	90150	Jane	270	" he helplessly exclaimed to the elements . "
90209	90279	90280	90281	Mr. Drummle	275	" Then he let himself down again , and became silent . We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on . A pause succeeded , during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane , who appeared to me to be the only member of the family irrespective of servants with whom it had any decided acquaintance . "
90283	90288	90280	90281	Mr. Drummle	275	" said Mrs. Pocket , "
90316	90818	90314	90314	ma	2072	" The baby was the soul of honor , and protested with all its might . It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket 's arm , exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face , and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny . And it gained its point after all , for I saw it through the window within a few minutes , being nursed by little Jane . It happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinner - table , through Flopson 's having some private engagement , and their not being anybody else 's business . I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket , which were exemplified in the following manner . Mr. Pocket , with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled , looked at them for some minutes , as if he could n't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment , and why they had n't been billeted by Nature on somebody else . Then , in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain questions , - as why little Joe had that hole in his frill , who said , Pa , Flopson was going to mend it when she had time , - and how little Fanny came by that whitlow , who said , Pa , Millers was going to poultice it when she did n't forget . Then , he melted into parental tenderness , and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play ; and then as they went out , with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the hopeless subject . In the evening there was rowing on the river . As Drummle and Startop had each a boat , I resolved to set up mine , and to cut them both out . I was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts , but as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames , - not to say for other waters , - I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize - wherry who plied at our stairs , and to whom I was introduced by my new allies . This practical authority confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith . If he could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil , I doubt if he would have paid it . There was a supper - tray after we got home at night , and I think we should all have enjoyed ourselves , but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence . Mr. Pocket was in good spirits , when a housemaid came in , and said , "
90833	90834	90825	90825	I	0	" "
90840	90851	90825	90825	I	0	" said Mrs. Pocket , whose dignity was roused again . "
90877	90878	90880	90880	your	2073	" "
90885	90890	90880	90880	your	2073	" returned the housemaid , "
90905	90928	90903	90903	master	1447	" Hereupon , Mr. Pocket went out of the room , and we made the best of ourselves until he came back . "
90937	90952	90935	90935	Belinda	274	" said Mr. Pocket , returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair . "
90983	90995	91000	91000	Sophia	283	" Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion , and said , "
91004	91005	91000	91000	Sophia	283	" "
91013	91018	91008	91008	you	274	" demanded Mr. Pocket . "
91024	91029	91019	91019	Sophia	283	" said Mrs. Pocket . "
91060	91061	91064	91064	she	283	" "
91073	91078	91064	91064	she	283	" returned Mr. Pocket , "
91090	91091	91064	91064	she	283	" "
91100	91105	91094	91094	you	2073	" said Mrs. Pocket , "
91110	91118	91094	91094	you	2073	" Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan . "
91133	91138	91120	91120	I	0	" said Mrs. Pocket . "
91179	91214	91169	91169	she	5841	" There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood , and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator . Still in that attitude he said , with a hollow voice , "
91221	91328	91169	91169	she	5841	" when I deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him . Chapter XXIV After two or three days , when I had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to London several times , and had ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen , Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together . He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself , for he referred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession , and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could "
91332	91672	91218	91219	Mr. Pip	241	" with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances . I acquiesced , of course , knowing nothing to the contrary . He advised my attending certain places in London , for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted , and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies . He hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me , and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his . Through his way of saying this , and much more to similar purpose , he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner ; and I may state at once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his compact with me , that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling mine with him . If he had shown indifference as a master , I have no doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil ; he gave me no such excuse , and each of us did the other justice . Nor did I ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about him - or anything but what was serious , honest , and good - in his tutor communication with me . When these points were settled , and so far carried out as that I had begun to work in earnest , it occurred to me that if I could retain my bedroom in Barnard 's Inn , my life would be agreeably varied , while my manners would be none the worse for Herbert 's society . Mr. Pocket did not object to this arrangement , but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it , it must be submitted to my guardian . I felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save Herbert some expense , so I went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mr. Jaggers . "
91684	91688	91218	91219	Mr. Pip	241	" said I , "
91705	91706	91218	91219	Mr. Pip	241	" "
91710	91720	91218	91219	Mr. Pip	241	" said Mr. Jaggers , with a short laugh . "
91737	91747	91734	91734	you	0	" I said I did n't know how much . "
91750	91755	91734	91734	you	0	" retorted Mr. Jaggers . "
91762	91763	91734	91734	you	0	" "
91771	91772	91734	91734	you	0	" "
91776	91794	91734	91734	you	0	" said Mr. Jaggers . This was such a great fall , that I said in discomfiture , "
91801	91802	91734	91734	you	0	" "
91809	91842	91734	91734	you	0	" retorted Mr. Jaggers , lying in wait for me , with his hands in his pockets , his head on one side , and his eyes on the wall behind me ; "
91847	91848	91734	91734	you	0	" "
91858	91864	91734	91734	you	0	" said I , hesitating . "
91867	91872	91734	91734	you	0	" said Mr. Jaggers . "
91902	91912	91734	91734	you	0	" I said I thought that would do handsomely . "
91923	91932	91734	91734	you	0	" said Mr. Jaggers , knitting his brows . "
91944	91945	91937	91937	you	0	" "
91953	91954	91948	91948	I	0	" "
91957	91962	91948	91948	I	0	" said Mr. Jaggers ; "
91966	91967	91968	91968	I	0	" "
91976	91982	91970	91970	you	0	" said I , smiling . "
91993	92008	91986	91986	I	0	" observed Mr. Jaggers , with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head . "
92018	92019	92014	92014	you	0	" "
92026	92027	92014	92014	you	0	" "
92030	92040	92014	92014	you	0	" said Mr. Jaggers , opening his office door . "
92054	92168	92014	92014	you	0	" This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me , and that not of an agreeable kind . Mr. Jaggers never laughed ; but he wore great bright creaking boots , and , in poising himself on these boots , with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together , awaiting an answer , he sometimes caused the boots to creak , as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way . As he happened to go out now , and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative , I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers 's manner . "
92182	92186	92187	92187	he	241	" answered Wemmick ; "
92204	92210	92187	92187	he	241	" for I looked surprised , "
92223	92264	92277	92277	he	241	" Wemmick was at his desk , lunching - and crunching - on a dry hard biscuit ; pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth , as if he were posting them . "
92270	92274	92277	92277	he	241	" said Wemmick , "
92297	92321	92277	92277	he	241	" Without remarking that man - traps were not among the amenities of life , I said I supposed he was very skilful ? "
92324	92328	92277	92277	he	241	" said Wemmick , "
92332	92367	92277	92277	he	241	" Pointing with his pen at the office floor , to express that Australia was understood , for the purposes of the figure , to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe . "
92374	92384	92385	92385	he	241	" added Wemmick , bringing his pen to paper , "
92390	92407	92385	92385	he	241	" Then , I said I supposed he had a fine business , and Wemmick said , "
92414	92430	92408	92412	Ca - pi - tal	285	" Then I asked if there were many clerks ? to which he replied , - "
92481	92637	92470	92470	You	2097	" I accepted the offer . When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post , and had paid me my money from a cash - box in a safe , the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coat - collar like an iron - pigtail , we went up stairs . The house was dark and shabby , and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr. Jaggers 's room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years . In the front first floor , a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat - catcher - a large pale , puffed , swollen man - was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance , whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers 's coffers . "
92642	92652	92470	92470	You	2097	" said Mr. Wemmick , as we came out , "
92657	92830	92470	92470	You	2097	" In the room over that , a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes , whom Mr. Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling , and who would melt me anything I pleased , - and who was in an excessive white - perspiration , as if he had been trying his art on himself . In a back room , a high - shouldered man with a face - ache tied up in dirty flannel , who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed , was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen , for Mr. Jaggers 's own use . This was all the establishment . When we went down stairs again , Wemmick led me into my guardian 's room , and said , "
92837	92838	92470	92470	You	2097	" "
92841	92861	92470	92470	You	2097	" said I , as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again , "
92867	92868	92470	92470	You	2097	" "
92871	92893	92470	92470	You	2097	" said Wemmick , getting upon a chair , and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down . "
92964	92965	92969	92969	him	2104	" "
92971	92995	92997	92997	him	2104	" I asked , recoiling from the brute , as Wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve . "
93035	93069	93032	93033	Old Artful	286	" said Wemmick . He then explained this affectionate apostrophe , by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it , and saying , "
93078	93079	93032	93033	Old Artful	286	" "
93085	93088	93083	93083	anybody	4526	" said I. "
93091	93095	93083	93083	anybody	4526	" returned Wemmick . "
93163	93190	93148	93148	her	5934	" Wemmick 's attention being thus directed to his brooch , he put down the cast , and polished the brooch with his pocket - handkerchief . "
93201	93205	93206	93206	He	2104	" I asked . "
93212	93213	93206	93206	He	2104	" "
93218	93222	93214	93214	You	2100	" said Wemmick ; "
93296	93303	93305	93305	you	2100	" Mr. Wemmick was again apostrophizing , "
93331	93353	93329	93329	you	2100	" Before putting his late friend on his shelf again , Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said , "
93367	93430	93329	93329	you	2100	" While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair , the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived from like sources . As he had shown no diffidence on the subject , I ventured on the liberty of asking him the question , when he stood before me , dusting his hands . "
93434	93438	93329	93329	you	2100	" he returned , "
93524	93546	93500	93500	your	2100	" When I had rendered homage to this light , he went on to say , in a friendly manner : - "
93627	93639	93640	93640	Thankee	288	" I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality . "
93642	93646	93640	93640	Thankee	288	" said he ; "
93671	93672	93664	93664	you	2100	" "
93676	93677	93685	93685	he	237	" "
93680	93684	93685	93685	he	237	" said Wemmick , "
93728	93729	93725	93726	his housekeeper	2118	" "
93737	93738	93731	93731	I	0	" "
93741	93745	93746	93746	you	2100	" said Wemmick , "
93801	93843	93796	93796	your	2100	" I told him I would do so , with all the interest and curiosity that his preparation awakened . As I was taking my departure , he asked me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers "
93847	93869	93796	93796	your	2100	" For several reasons , and not least because I did n't clearly know what Mr. Jaggers would be found to be "
93872	93985	93796	93796	your	2100	" I replied in the affirmative . We dived into the City , and came up in a crowded police - court , where a blood - relation in the murderous sense of the deceased , with the fanciful taste in brooches , was standing at the bar , uncomfortably chewing something ; while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross - examination , - I do n't know which , - and was striking her , and the bench , and everybody present , with awe . If anybody , of whatsoever degree , said a word that he did n't approve of , he instantly required to have it "
93989	94001	94002	94002	I	0	" If anybody would n't make an admission , he said , "
94010	94021	94002	94002	I	0	" and if anybody made an admission , he said , "
94028	94356	94366	94366	her	2122	" The magistrates shivered under a single bite of his finger . Thieves and thief - takers hung in dread rapture on his words , and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction . Which side he was on I could n't make out , for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill ; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe , he was not on the side of the bench ; for , he was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided , quite convulsive under the table , by his denunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and justice in that chair that day . Chapter XXV Bentley Drummle , who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury , did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit . Heavy in figure , movement , and comprehension , - in the sluggish complexion of his face , and in the large , awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a room , - he was idle , proud , niggardly , reserved , and suspicious . He came of rich people down in Somersetshire , who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead . Thus , Bentley Drummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman , and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen . Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school , but he was devotedly attached to her , and admired her beyond measure . He had a woman 's delicacy of feature , and was - "
94368	94374	94366	94366	her	2122	" said Herbert to me - "
94380	94965	94366	94366	her	2122	" It was but natural that I should take to him much more kindly than to Drummle , and that , even in the earliest evenings of our boating , he and I should pull homeward abreast of one another , conversing from boat to boat , while Bentley Drummle came up in our wake alone , under the overhanging banks and among the rushes . He would always creep in - shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature , even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way ; and I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back - water , when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid - stream . Herbert was my intimate companion and friend . I presented him with a half - share in my boat , which was the occasion of his often coming down to Hammersmith ; and my possession of a half - share in his chambers often took me up to London . We used to walk between the two places at all hours . I have an affection for the road yet though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then , formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope . When I had been in Mr. Pocket 's family a month or two , Mr. and Mrs. Camilla turned up . Camilla was Mr. Pocket 's sister . Georgiana , whom I had seen at Miss Havisham 's on the same occasion , also turned up . She was a cousin , - an indigestive single woman , who called her rigidity religion , and her liver love . These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment . As a matter of course , they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness . Towards Mr. Pocket , as a grown - up infant with no notion of his own interests , they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express . Mrs. Pocket they held in contempt ; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life , because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves . These were the surroundings among which I settled down , and applied myself to my education . I soon contracted expensive habits , and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous ; but through good and evil I stuck to my books . There was no other merit in this , than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies . Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast ; and , with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted , and clear obstructions out of my road , I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less . I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks , when I thought I would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening . He replied that it would give him much pleasure , and that he would expect me at the office at six o'clock . Thither I went , and there I found him , putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck . "
94975	94979	94967	94967	you	2124	" said he . "
94982	94986	94967	94967	you	2124	" said I , "
94991	94992	94988	94988	you	2125	" "
94996	95002	94988	94988	you	2125	" was Wemmick 's reply , "
95115	95149	95112	95112	I	0	" Pick us out a good one , old Briton , because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two , we could easily have done it . "
95155	95170	95150	95150	He	2125	" Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop . "
95202	95218	95199	95199	I	0	" I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl , until he added , "
95230	95238	95223	95225	an aged parent	2131	" I then said what politeness required . "
95250	95259	95246	95247	Mr. Jaggers	237	" he pursued , as we walked along . "
95263	95264	95265	95265	He	237	" "
95307	95328	95289	95289	He	237	" Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my intimate associates , I answered , "
95331	95332	95289	95289	He	237	" "
95344	95355	95335	95335	he	237	" - I hardly felt complimented by the word , - "
95390	95410	95411	95411	he	237	" proceeded Wemmick , after a moment 's pause , as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood ; "
95423	95424	95411	95411	he	237	" "
95430	95431	95426	95426	he	237	" "
95436	95440	95441	95441	He	237	" returned Wemmick . "
95450	95462	95441	95441	He	237	" I want to see the man who 'll rob me . "
95492	95528	95480	95480	him	237	" You know where I live ; now , no bolt is ever drawn there ; why do n't you do a stroke of business with me ? Come ; ca n't I tempt you ? "
95551	95552	95553	95553	They	2143	" "
95559	95562	95553	95553	They	2143	" said I. "
95566	95570	95571	95571	I	0	" said Wemmick . "
95603	95604	95573	95573	you	4451	" "
95612	95616	95619	95619	they	2143	" I observed , "
95621	95622	95573	95573	you	4451	" "
95631	95639	95626	95626	he	237	" said Wemmick , cutting me short , "
95687	95704	95680	95680	he	237	" I was falling into meditation on my guardian 's greatness , when Wemmick remarked : - "
95748	95749	95738	95738	his	237	" "
95755	95758	95738	95738	his	237	" said I. "
95761	95765	95766	95766	I	0	" repeated Wemmick . "
95852	95957	95958	95958	My	0	" At first with such discourse , and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature , did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road , until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth . It appeared to be a collection of back lanes , ditches , and little gardens , and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement . Wemmick 's house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden , and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns . "
95962	95966	95958	95958	My	0	" said Wemmick . "
95974	96017	95958	95958	My	0	" I highly commended it , I think it was the smallest house I ever saw ; with the queerest gothic windows by far the greater part of them sham , and a gothic door almost too small to get in at . "
96027	96031	95958	95958	My	0	" said Wemmick , "
96066	96120	96053	96053	I	0	" The bridge was a plank , and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep . But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast ; smiling as he did so , with a relish and not merely mechanically . "
96130	96134	96053	96053	I	0	" said Wemmick , "
96163	96203	96155	96155	you	2153	" The piece of ordnance referred to , was mounted in a separate fortress , constructed of lattice - work . It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella . "
96210	96214	96155	96155	you	2153	" said Wemmick , "
96263	96269	96260	96260	your	2153	" I said , decidedly . "
96323	96340	96321	96321	sir	4451	" said Wemmick , smiling again , but seriously too , as he shook his head , "
96364	96495	96496	96496	I	0	" Then , he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off , but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at ; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth . Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake , on whose margin the bower was raised . This piece of water with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper was of a circular form , and he had constructed a fountain in it , which , when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe , played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet . "
96525	96534	96520	96523	Jack of all Trades	2165	" said Wemmick , in acknowledging my compliments . "
96580	96628	96629	96631	Well aged parent	2168	" I expressed the readiness I felt , and we went into the castle . There we found , sitting by a fire , a very old man in a flannel coat : clean , cheerful , comfortable , and well cared for , but intensely deaf . "
96633	96648	96675	96676	aged parent	2169	" said Wemmick , shaking hands with him in a cordial and jocose way , "
96653	96654	96651	96651	you	2168	" "
96663	96669	96658	96658	John	291	" replied the old man . "
96678	96682	96672	96673	Mr. Pip	241	" said Wemmick , "
96718	96719	96712	96712	you	2168	" "
96732	96748	96730	96730	sir	4451	" cried the old man , while I nodded as hard as I possibly could . "
96788	96789	96790	96790	You	4451	" "
96805	96821	96803	96803	Aged	2178	" said Wemmick , contemplating the old man , with his hard face really softened ; "
96829	96836	96803	96803	Aged	2178	" giving him a tremendous one ; "
96843	96852	96853	96853	you	4451	" giving him a still more tremendous one ; "
96895	96962	96886	96886	You	4451	" I tipped him several more , and he was in great spirits . We left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls , and we sat down to our punch in the arbor ; where Wemmick told me , as he smoked a pipe , that it had taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection . "
96971	96972	96968	96969	Mr. Wemmick	254	" "
96976	96980	96968	96969	Mr. Wemmick	254	" said Wemmick , "
97002	97003	97000	97000	George	231	" "
97015	97016	97010	97011	Mr. Jaggers	237	" "
97021	97025	97010	97011	Mr. Jaggers	237	" said Wemmick . "
97113	97150	97104	97104	I	0	" Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request . The punch being very nice , we sat there drinking it and talking , until it was almost nine o'clock . "
97157	97169	97172	97173	the Aged	2166	" said Wemmick then , as he laid down his pipe ; "
97177	97315	97172	97173	the Aged	2166	" Proceeding into the Castle again , we found the Aged heating the poker , with expectant eyes , as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony . Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the moment was come for him to take the red - hot poker from the Aged , and repair to the battery . He took it , and went out , and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces , and made every glass and teacup in it ring . Upon this , the Aged - who I believe would have been blown out of his arm - chair but for holding on by the elbows - cried out exultingly , "
97324	97422	97320	97320	I	0	" and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him . The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities . They were mostly of a felonious character ; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed , a distinguished razor or two , some locks of hair , and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation , - upon which Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being , to use his own words , "
97431	97914	97429	97429	sir	4451	" These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass , various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum , and some tobacco - stoppers carved by the Aged . They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted , and which served , not only as the general sitting - room but as the kitchen too , if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob , and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting - jack . There was a neat little girl in attendance , who looked after the Aged in the day . When she had laid the supper - cloth , the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress , and she withdrew for the night . The supper was excellent ; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry - rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut , and though the pig might have been farther off , I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment . Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom , beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff , that when I lay down on my back in bed , it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night . Wemmick was up early in the morning , and I am afraid I heard him cleaning my boots . After that , he fell to gardening , and I saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged , and nodding at him in a most devoted manner . Our breakfast was as good as the supper , and at half - past eight precisely we started for Little Britain . By degrees , Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along , and his mouth tightened into a post - office again . At last , when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coat - collar , he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged , had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger . Chapter XXVI It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would , that I had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian 's establishment with that of his cashier and clerk . My guardian was in his room , washing his hands with his scented soap , when I went into the office from Walworth ; and he called me to him , and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive . "
97918	97922	97429	97429	sir	4451	" he stipulated , "
97934	97972	97429	97429	sir	4451	" I asked him where we should come to for I had no idea where he lived , and I believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission , that he replied , "
97985	98680	98681	98681	Pip	241	" I embrace this opportunity of remarking that he washed his clients off , as if he were a surgeon or a dentist . He had a closet in his room , fitted up for the purpose , which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer 's shop . It had an unusually large jack - towel on a roller inside the door , and he would wash his hands , and wipe them and dry them all over this towel , whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room . When I and my friends repaired to him at six o'clock next day , he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual , for we found him with his head butted into this closet , not only washing his hands , but laving his face and gargling his throat . And even when he had done all that , and had gone all round the jack - towel , he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat on . There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street , who were evidently anxious to speak with him ; but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence , that they gave it up for that day . As we walked along westward , he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets , and whenever that happened he talked louder to me ; but he never otherwise recognized anybody , or took notice that anybody recognized him . He conducted us to Gerrard Street , Soho , to a house on the south side of that street . Rather a stately house of its kind , but dolefully in want of painting , and with dirty windows . He took out his key and opened the door , and we all went into a stone hall , bare , gloomy , and little used . So , up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor . There were carved garlands on the panelled walls , and as he stood among them giving us welcome , I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like . Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms ; the second was his dressing - room ; the third , his bedroom . He told us that he held the whole house , but rarely used more of it than we saw . The table was comfortably laid - no silver in the service , of course - and at the side of his chair was a capacious dumb - waiter , with a variety of bottles and decanters on it , and four dishes of fruit for dessert . I noticed throughout , that he kept everything under his own hand , and distributed everything himself . There was a bookcase in the room ; I saw from the backs of the books , that they were about evidence , criminal law , criminal biography , trials , acts of Parliament , and such things . The furniture was all very solid and good , like his watch - chain . It had an official look , however , and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen . In a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp : so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too , and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work . As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now , - for he and I had walked together , - he stood on the hearth - rug , after ringing the bell , and took a searching look at them . To my surprise , he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle . "
98683	98701	98681	98681	Pip	241	" said he , putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window , "
98716	98717	98713	98714	the Spider	2189	" "
98721	98724	98725	98731	The blotchy , sprawly , sulky fellow	2190	" said I. "
98733	98734	98725	98731	The blotchy , sprawly , sulky fellow	2190	" "
98740	98744	98745	98750	the one with the delicate face	2191	" I replied ; "
98754	98761	98762	98767	the one with the delicate face	2191	" Not making the least account of "
98769	98773	98762	98767	the one with the delicate face	2191	" he returned , "
98791	99680	98788	98789	that fellow	2193	" He immediately began to talk to Drummle : not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way , but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him . I was looking at the two , when there came between me and them the housekeeper , with the first dish for the table . She was a woman of about forty , I supposed , - but I may have thought her younger than she was . Rather tall , of a lithe nimble figure , extremely pale , with large faded eyes , and a quantity of streaming hair . I can not say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting , and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter ; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre , a night or two before , and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air , like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches ' caldron . She set the dish on , touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready , and vanished . We took our seats at the round table , and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him , while Startop sat on the other . It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table , and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards , and then an equally choice bird . Sauces , wines , all the accessories we wanted , and all of the best , were given out by our host from his dumb - waiter ; and when they had made the circuit of the table , he always put them back again . Similarly , he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks , for each course , and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair . No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared . She set on every dish ; and I always saw in her face , a face rising out of the caldron . Years afterwards , I made a dreadful likeness of that woman , by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room . Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper , both by her own striking appearance and by Wemmick 's preparation , I observed that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my guardian , and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him , hesitatingly , as if she dreaded his calling her back , and wanted him to speak when she was nigh , if he had anything to say . I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this , and a purpose of always holding her in suspense . Dinner went off gayly , and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects , I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us . For myself , I found that I was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure , and to patronize Herbert , and to boast of my great prospects , before I quite knew that I had opened my lips . It was so with all of us , but with no one more than Drummle : the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest , was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off . It was not then , but when we had got to the cheese , that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats , and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his . Drummle upon this , informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company , and that as to skill he was more than our master , and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff . By some invisible agency , my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle ; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was , and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner . Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table ; my guardian , taking no heed of her , but with the side of his face turned from her , was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle , that , to me , was quite inexplicable . Suddenly , he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper 's , like a trap , as she stretched it across the table . So suddenly and smartly did he do this , that we all stopped in our foolish contention . "
99687	99692	99693	99693	I	0	" said Mr. Jaggers , "
99708	99729	99730	99730	Master	1447	" Her entrapped hand was on the table , but she had already put her other hand behind her waist . "
99732	99751	99730	99730	Master	1447	" she said , in a low voice , with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him . "
99755	99756	99730	99730	Master	1447	" "
99764	99777	99778	99778	Molly	296	" repeated Mr. Jaggers , with an immovable determination to show it . "
99786	99787	99788	99788	Master	1447	" "
99790	99795	99788	99788	Master	1447	" she again murmured . "
99798	99799	99800	99800	Molly	296	" "
99802	99823	99800	99800	Molly	296	" said Mr. Jaggers , not looking at her , but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room , "
99836	99916	99788	99788	Master	1447	" He took his hand from hers , and turned that wrist up on the table . She brought her other hand from behind her , and held the two out side by side . The last wrist was much disfigured , - deeply scarred and scarred across and across . When she held her hands out she took her eyes from Mr. Jaggers , and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession . "
99922	99936	99788	99788	Master	1447	" said Mr. Jaggers , coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger . "
99991	100031	100036	100036	Molly	296	" While he said these words in a leisurely , critical style , she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat . The moment he ceased , she looked at him again . "
100038	100049	100036	100036	Molly	296	" said Mr. Jaggers , giving her a slight nod ; "
100059	100094	100036	100036	Molly	296	" She withdrew her hands and went out of the room , and Mr. Jaggers , putting the decanters on from his dumb - waiter , filled his glass and passed round the wine . "
100103	100107	100036	100036	Molly	296	" said he , "
100138	100303	100133	100133	I	0	" If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more , it perfectly succeeded . In a sulky triumph , Drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us , in a more and more offensive degree , until he became downright intolerable . Through all his stages , Mr. Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest . He actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers 's wine . In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink , and I know we talked too much . We became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummle 's , to the effect that we were too free with our money . It led to my remarking , with more zeal than discretion , that it came with a bad grace from him , to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before . "
100306	100310	100354	100354	You	0	" retorted Drummle ; "
100316	100317	100318	100318	I	0	" "
100329	100333	100325	100325	he	2205	" said I , "

100358	100362	100354	100354	You	0	" retorted Drummle . "

100372	100383	100354	100354	You	0	" I went on , meaning to be very severe , "
100399	100400	100385	100385	you	2205	" "
100405	100409	100401	100401	You	0	" said Drummle . "

100448	100452	100444	100444	You	0	" repeated Drummle . "
100456	100491	100444	100444	You	0	" This was so very aggravating - the more especially as I found myself making no way against his surly obtuseness - that I said , disregarding Herbert 's efforts to check me , - "
100522	100523	100504	100504	I	0	" "
100538	100564	100524	100524	I	0	" growled Drummle . And I think he added in a lower growl , that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves . "
100572	100576	100565	100565	I	0	" said I , "
100617	100812	100601	100601	you	275	" Drummle laughed outright , and sat laughing in our faces , with his hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised ; plainly signifying that it was quite true , and that he despised us as asses all . Hereupon Startop took him in hand , though with a much better grace than I had shown , and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable . Startop , being a lively , bright young fellow , and Drummle being the exact opposite , the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront . He now retorted in a coarse , lumpish way , and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh . Resenting this little success more than anything , Drummle , without any threat or warning , pulled his hands out of his pockets , dropped his round shoulders , swore , took up a large glass , and would have flung it at his adversary 's head , but for our entertainer 's dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose . "
100815	100837	100813	100813	Gentlemen	4982	" said Mr. Jaggers , deliberately putting down the glass , and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain , "
100851	100874	100875	100876	old boy	2211	" On this hint we all rose to depart . Before we got to the street door , Startop was cheerily calling Drummle "
100878	101047	100875	100876	old boy	2211	" as if nothing had happened . But the old boy was so far from responding , that he would not even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way ; so Herbert and I , who remained in town , saw them going down the street on opposite sides ; Startop leading , and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses , much as he was wo nt to follow in his boat . As the door was not yet shut , I thought I would leave Herbert there for a moment , and run up stairs again to say a word to my guardian . I found him in his dressing - room surrounded by his stock of boots , already hard at it , washing his hands of us . I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred , and that I hoped he would not blame me much . "
101050	101066	101071	101071	Pip	241	" said he , sluicing his face , and speaking through the water - drops ; "
101079	101100	101073	101073	I	0	" He had turned towards me now , and was shaking his head , and blowing , and towelling himself . "
101110	101114	101108	101108	sir	4451	" said I - "
101120	101121	101116	101116	I	0	" "
101126	101131	101108	101108	sir	4451	" my guardian assented ; "
101177	101189	101170	101170	I	0	" Looking out of the towel , he caught my eye . "
101199	101221	101191	101191	I	0	" he said , letting his head drop into a festoon of towel , and towelling away at his two ears . "
101237	101238	101235	101235	Pip	241	" "
101244	101288	101242	101242	sir	4451	" In about a month after that , the Spider 's time with Mr. Pocket was up for good , and , to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket , he went home to the family hole . Chapter XXVII "
101295	101422	101423	101423	BIDDY	188	" I write this by request of Mr. Gargery , for to let you know that he is going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you . He would call at Barnard 's Hotel Tuesday morning at nine o'clock , when if not agreeable please leave word . Your poor sister is much the same as when you left . We talk of you in the kitchen every night , and wonder what you are saying and doing . If now considered in the light of a liberty , excuse it for the love of poor old days . No more , dear Mr. Pip , from your ever obliged , and affectionate servant , "
101425	101426	101423	101423	BIDDY	188	" "
101505	102164	101494	101494	he	2219	" I received this letter by the post on Monday morning , and therefore its appointment was for next day . Let me confess exactly with what feelings I looked forward to Joe 's coming . Not with pleasure , though I was bound to him by so many ties ; no ; with considerable disturbance , some mortification , and a keen sense of incongruity . If I could have kept him away by paying money , I certainly would have paid money . My greatest reassurance was that he was coming to Barnard 's Inn , not to Hammersmith , and consequently would not fall in Bentley Drummle 's way . I had little objection to his being seen by Herbert or his father , for both of whom I had a respect ; but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle , whom I held in contempt . So , throughout life , our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise . I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other , and very expensive those wrestles with Barnard proved to be . By this time , the rooms were vastly different from what I had found them , and I enjoyed the honor of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring upholsterer . I had got on so fast of late , that I had even started a boy in boots , - top boots , - in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been said to pass my days . For , after I had made the monster out of the refuse of my washerwoman 's family , and had clothed him with a blue coat , canary waistcoat , white cravat , creamy breeches , and the boots already mentioned , I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat ; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my existence . This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday morning in the hall , it was two feet square , as charged for floorcloth , and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he thought Joe would like . While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being so interested and considerate , I had an odd half - provoked sense of suspicion upon me , that if Joe had been coming to see him , he would n't have been quite so brisk about it . However , I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe , and I got up early in the morning , and caused the sitting - room and breakfast - table to assume their most splendid appearance . Unfortunately the morning was drizzly , and an angel could not have concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window , like some weak giant of a Sweep . As the time approached I should have liked to run away , but the Avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall , and presently I heard Joe on the staircase . I knew it was Joe , by his clumsy manner of coming up stairs , - his state boots being always too big for him , - and by the time it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his ascent . When at last he stopped outside our door , I could hear his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name , and I afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole . Finally he gave a faint single rap , and Pepper - such was the compromising name of the avenging boy - announced "
102168	102201	102202	102202	Joe	154	" I thought he never would have done wiping his feet , and that I must have gone out to lift him off the mat , but at last he came in . "
102210	102211	102212	102212	Pip	241	" "
102220	102266	102218	102218	Pip	241	" With his good honest face all glowing and shining , and his hat put down on the floor between us , he caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down , as if I had been the last - patented Pump . "
102281	102327	102278	102278	your	154	" But Joe , taking it up carefully with both hands , like a bird's - nest with eggs in it , would n't hear of parting with that piece of property , and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way . "
102334	102338	102329	102329	you	154	" said Joe , "
102349	102360	102278	102278	your	154	" Joe considered a little before he discovered this word ; "
102375	102376	102278	102278	your	154	" "
102386	102387	102378	102378	you	154	" "
102391	102395	102389	102389	God	192	" said Joe , "
102446	102487	102440	102440	he	2229	" All this time still with both hands taking great care of the bird's - nest , Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room , and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing - gown . "
102494	102495	102492	102492	Joe	154	" "
102499	102507	102492	102492	Joe	154	" said Joe , lowering his voice , "
102537	102565	102533	102533	his	2229	" said Joe , getting the bird's - nest under his left arm for the moment , and groping in it for an egg with his right ; "
102578	102613	102575	102575	you	2231	" I took what Joe gave me , and found it to be the crumpled play - bill of a small metropolitan theatre , announcing the first appearance , in that very week , of "
102646	102647	102649	102649	you	0	" "
102656	102660	102661	102661	I	0	" I inquired . "
102664	102673	102661	102661	I	0	" said Joe , with emphasis and solemnity . "
102680	102681	102661	102661	I	0	" "
102684	102688	102661	102661	I	0	" said Joe , "
102745	102748	102749	102750	A man	428	" Amen ! "
102763	102777	102749	102750	A man	428	" said Joe , lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone , "
102855	102904	102905	102906	Your servant	2244	" A ghost - seeing effect in Joe 's own countenance informed me that Herbert had entered the room . So , I presented Joe to Herbert , who held out his hand ; but Joe backed from it , and held on by the bird's - nest . "
102910	102914	102916	102916	I	0	" said Joe , "
102922	102966	102967	102967	I	0	" - here his eye fell on the Avenger , who was putting some toast on table , and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family , that I frowned it down and confused him more - "
103003	103009	103011	103011	I	0	" said Joe , confidentially , "
103052	103079	103080	103080	Joe	154	" Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwelling - place , and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me ' sir , "
103153	103165	103167	103167	Herbert	265	" Do you take tea , or coffee , Mr. Gargery ? "
103176	103181	103183	103183	Joe	154	" Thankee , Sir , "
103191	103202	103183	103183	Joe	154	" I 'll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself . "
103203	103211	103167	103167	Herbert	265	" What do you say to coffee ? "
103212	103217	103219	103219	Joe	154	" Thankee , Sir , "
103261	103262	103183	103183	Joe	154	" "
103267	103325	103183	103183	Joe	154	" said Herbert , pouring it out . Here Joe 's hat tumbled off the mantel - piece , and he started out of his chair and picked it up , and fitted it to the same exact spot . As if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon . "
103336	103337	103333	103334	Mr. Gargery	203	" "
103343	103369	103333	103334	Mr. Gargery	203	" said Joe , after coughing behind his hand , as if he had had time to catch the whooping - cough since he came . "
103385	103399	103381	103381	It	2254	" with an appearance of mingled wisdom , relief , and strict impartiality . "
103408	103409	103401	103401	you	154	" "
103416	103420	103414	103414	Sir	4451	" said Joe , "
103459	103468	103456	103456	I	0	" added Joe , in an explanatory manner , "
103477	103831	103832	103832	Us	2258	" I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know into a perfect Chorus , but for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat , which was toppling . Indeed , it demanded from him a constant attention , and a quickness of eye and hand , very like that exacted by wicket - keeping . He made extraordinary play with it , and showed the greatest skill ; now , rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped ; now , merely stopping it midway , beating it up , and humoring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall , before he felt it safe to close with it ; finally splashing it into the slop - basin , where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it . As to his shirt - collar , and his coat - collar , they were perplexing to reflect upon , - insoluble mysteries both . Why should a man scrape himself to that extent , before he could consider himself full dressed ? Why should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes ? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation , with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth ; had his eyes attracted in such strange directions ; was afflicted with such remarkable coughs ; sat so far from the table , and dropped so much more than he ate , and pretended that he had n't dropped it ; that I was heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City . I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault , and that if I had been easier with Joe , Joe would have been easier with me . I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him ; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head . "
103840	103845	103846	103846	Joe	154	" - began Joe . "
103848	103854	103846	103846	Joe	154	" I interrupted , pettishly , "
103863	103903	103857	103857	you	154	" Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach . Utterly preposterous as his cravat was , and as his collars were , I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look . "
103910	103914	103916	103916	me	0	" resumed Joe , "
103955	103967	103969	103969	my	0	" said Joe , with his old air of lucid exposition , "
103997	104017	104020	104020	sir	4451	" I was so unwilling to see the look again , that I made no remonstrance against this tone . "
104022	104026	104020	104020	sir	4451	" pursued Joe , "
104043	104067	104041	104041	Pip	241	" - whenever he subsided into affection , he called me Pip , and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir ; "
104085	104095	104141	104141	you	0	" said Joe , going down a new track , "
104135	104136	104141	104141	you	0	" "

104156	104165	104154	104154	Pip	241	" said Joe , slightly tossing his head , "
104237	104238	104239	104240	Miss Havisham	223	" "
104244	104245	104247	104247	She	223	" "
104263	104274	104277	104277	Joe	154	" Joe sat and rolled his eyes at the ceiling . "
104284	104285	104277	104277	Joe	154	" "
104291	104307	104310	104310	myself	0	" said Joe , looking at me as if I were a long way off , "

104337	104356	104357	104358	Miss A.	301	" replied Joe , with an air of legal formality , as if he were making his will , "
104460	104502	104503	104503	Biddy	188	" I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe . I hope one remote cause of its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his errand , I should have given him more encouragement . "
104505	104509	104503	104503	Biddy	188	" pursued Joe , "
104533	104562	104530	104530	Biddy	188	" I know he will be very glad to have it by word of mouth , it is holiday time , you want to see him , go ! "
104570	104579	104563	104563	I	0	" said Joe , rising from his chair , "

104639	104650	104630	104630	Joe	154	" said Joe . Our eyes met , and all the "
104652	104666	104667	104667	Pip	241	" melted out of that manly heart as he gave me his hand . "
104954	105622	105623	105623	convict	2298	" I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him . The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he spoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven . He touched me gently on the forehead , and went out . As soon as I could recover myself sufficiently , I hurried out after him and looked for him in the neighboring streets ; but he was gone . Chapter XXVIII It was clear that I must repair to our town next day , and in the first flow of my repentance , it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe 's . But , when I had secured my box - place by to - morrow 's coach , and had been down to Mr. Pocket 's and back , I was not by any means convinced on the last point , and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the Blue Boar . I should be an inconvenience at Joe 's ; I was not expected , and my bed would not be ready ; I should be too far from Miss Havisham 's , and she was exacting and might n't like it . All other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self - swindlers , and with such pretences did I cheat myself . Surely a curious thing . That I should innocently take a bad half - crown of somebody else 's manufacture is reasonable enough ; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money ! An obliging stranger , under pretence of compactly folding up my bank - notes for security 's sake , abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells ; but what is his sleight of hand to mine , when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes ! Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar , my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger . It was tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the Blue Boar 's posting - yard ; it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailor 's shop , and confounding the disrespectful senses of Trabb 's boy . On the other hand , Trabb 's boy might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things ; or , reckless and desperate wretch as I knew he could be , might hoot him in the High Street , My patroness , too , might hear of him , and not approve . On the whole , I resolved to leave the Avenger behind . It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place , and , as winter had now come round , I should not arrive at my destination until two or three hours after dark . Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was two o'clock . I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare , attended by the Avenger , - if I may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it . At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock - yards by stage - coach . As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers , and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof , I had no cause to be surprised when Herbert , meeting me in the yard , came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me . But I had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word "
105625	105626	105623	105623	convict	2298	" "
105635	105639	105627	105627	You	2299	" said Herbert . "
105643	105644	105627	105627	You	2299	" "
105657	105658	105647	105647	you	2299	" "
105684	105685	105678	105678	I	0	" "
105692	105696	105689	105689	they	2300	" said Herbert , "
105712	106271	105689	105689	they	2300	" They had been treating their guard , I suppose , for they had a gaoler with them , and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands . The two convicts were handcuffed together , and had irons on their legs , - irons of a pattern that I knew well . They wore the dress that I likewise knew well . Their keeper had a brace of pistols , and carried a thick - knobbed bludgeon under his arm ; but he was on terms of good understanding with them , and stood with them beside him , looking on at the putting - to of the horses , rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment , and he the Curator . One was a taller and stouter man than the other , and appeared as a matter of course , according to the mysterious ways of the world , both convict and free , to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes . His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes , and his attire disguised him absurdly ; but I knew his half - closed eye at one glance . There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night , and who had brought me down with his invisible gun ! It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in his life . He looked across at me , and his eye appraised my watch - chain , and then he incidentally spat and said something to the other convict , and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle , and looked at something else . The great numbers on their backs , as if they were street doors ; their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface , as if they were lower animals ; their ironed legs , apologetically garlanded with pocket - handkerchiefs ; and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them ; made them as Herbert had said a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle . But this was not the worst of it . It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London , and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachman . Hereupon , a choleric gentleman , who had taken the fourth place on that seat , flew into a most violent passion , and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company , and that it was poisonous , and pernicious , and infamous , and shameful , and I do n't know what else . At this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient , and we were all preparing to get up , and the prisoners had come over with their keeper , - bringing with them that curious flavor of bread - poultice , baize , rope - yarn , and hearthstone , which attends the convict presence . "
106282	106291	106280	106280	sir	4451	" pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger ; "
106327	106328	106319	106319	You	4451	" "
106335	106343	106344	106344	I	0	" growled the convict I had recognized . "
106373	106374	106376	106376	mine	2309	" "
106378	106385	106386	106386	I	0	" said the other , gruffly . "
106402	106525	106399	106399	my	0	" Then they both laughed , and began cracking nuts , and spitting the shells about . - As I really think I should have liked to do myself , if I had been in their place and so despised . At length , it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman , and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind . So he got into his place , still making complaints , and the keeper got into the place next him , and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could , and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head . "
106531	106858	106529	106529	Handel	266	" Herbert called out as we started . I thought what a blessed fortune it was , that he had found another name for me than Pip . It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict 's breathing , not only on the back of my head , but all along my spine . The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid , it set my very teeth on edge . He seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man , and to make more noise in doing it ; and I was conscious of growing high - shouldered on one side , in my shrinking endeavors to fend him off . The weather was miserably raw , and the two cursed the cold . It made us all lethargic before we had gone far , and when we had left the Half - way House behind , we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent . I dozed off , myself , in considering the question whether I ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him , and how it could best be done . In the act of dipping forward as if I were going to bathe among the horses , I woke in a fright and took the question up again . But I must have lost it longer than I had thought , since , although I could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps , I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us . Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind , the convicts were closer to me than before . The very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious , were the words of my own thought , "
106864	106865	106529	106529	Handel	266	" "
106872	106881	106868	106868	he	2310	" said the convict I had never seen . "
106887	106892	106893	106893	He	2310	" returned the other . "
106908	106909	106910	106910	I	0	" "
106913	106926	106893	106893	He	2310	" said the other , with a bitter curse upon the cold , "
106933	106934	106928	106928	I	0	" "
106943	106944	106928	106928	I	0	" "
106977	106978	106973	106973	he	2310	" "
106983	106992	106980	106980	he	2310	" resumed the convict I had recognized , - "
107064	107065	107061	107061	I	0	" "
107070	107075	107068	107068	you	2317	" growled the other . "
107107	107108	107101	107101	he	428	" "
107133	107134	107130	107131	a Lifer	2323	" "

107199	107475	107479	107479	you	2329	" They both execrated the place in very strong language , and gradually growled themselves out , and had nothing left to say . After overhearing this dialogue , I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway , but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity . Indeed , I was not only so changed in the course of nature , but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced , that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help . Still , the coincidence of our being together on the coach , was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me , in his hearing , with my name . For this reason , I resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town , and put myself out of his hearing . This device I executed successfully . My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet ; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out ; I threw it down before me , got down after it , and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement . As to the convicts , they went their way with the coach , and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river . In my fancy , I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime - washed stairs , - again heard the gruff "
107481	107647	107479	107479	you	2329	" like and order to dogs , - again saw the wicked Noah 's Ark lying out on the black water . I could not have said what I was afraid of , for my fear was altogether undefined and vague , but there was great fear upon me . As I walked on to the hotel , I felt that a dread , much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition , made me tremble . I am confident that it took no distinctness of shape , and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood . The coffee - room at the Blue Boar was empty , and I had not only ordered my dinner there , but had sat down to it , before the waiter knew me . As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory , he asked me if he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook ? "
107650	107654	107479	107479	you	2329	" said I , "
107658	108537	108538	108538	Orlick	225	" The waiter it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the Commercials , on the day when I was bound appeared surprised , and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way , that I took it up and read this paragraph : - Our readers will learn , not altogether without interest , in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighborhood what a theme , by the way , for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY , the poet of our columns ! that the youth 's earliest patron , companion , and friend , was a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade , and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street . It is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor of our young Telemachus , for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latter 's fortunes . Does the thought - contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes ? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp . VERB . SAP . I entertain a conviction , based upon large experience , that if in the days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole , I should have met somebody there , wandering Esquimaux or civilized man , who would have told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes . Chapter XXIX Betimes in the morning I was up and out . It was too early yet to go to Miss Havisham 's , so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham 's side of town , - which was not Joe 's side ; I could go there to - morrow , - thinking about my patroness , and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for me . She had adopted Estella , she had as good as adopted me , and it could not fail to be her intention to bring us together . She reserved it for me to restore the desolate house , admit the sunshine into the dark rooms , set the clocks a - going and the cold hearths a - blazing , tear down the cobwebs , destroy the vermin , - in short , do all the shining deeds of the young Knight of romance , and marry the Princess . I had stopped to look at the house as I passed ; and its seared red brick walls , blocked windows , and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons , as if with sinewy old arms , had made up a rich attractive mystery , of which I was the hero . Estella was the inspiration of it , and the heart of it , of course . But , though she had taken such strong possession of me , though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her , though her influence on my boyish life and character had been all - powerful , I did not , even that romantic morning , invest her with any attributes save those she possessed . I mention this in this place , of a fixed purpose , because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into my poor labyrinth . According to my experience , the conventional notion of a lover can not be always true . The unqualified truth is , that when I loved Estella with the love of a man , I loved her simply because I found her irresistible . Once for all ; I knew to my sorrow , often and often , if not always , that I loved her against reason , against promise , against peace , against hope , against happiness , against all discouragement that could be . Once for all ; I loved her none the less because I knew it , and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection . I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time . When I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand , I turned my back upon the gate , while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet . I heard the side - door open , and steps come across the courtyard ; but I pretended not to hear , even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges . Being at last touched on the shoulder , I started and turned . I started much more naturally then , to find myself confronted by a man in a sober gray dress . The last man I should have expected to see in that place of porter at Miss Havisham 's door . "

108840	108987	108837	108838	a scholar	893	" By this time we had come to the house , where I found his room to be one just within the side - door , with a little window in it looking on the courtyard . In its small proportions , it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate - porter in Paris . Certain keys were hanging on the wall , to which he now added the gate key ; and his patchwork - covered bed was in a little inner division or recess . The whole had a slovenly , confined , and sleepy look , like a cage for a human dormouse ; while he , looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window , looked like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up , - as indeed he was .

110963	110999	110961	110961	Estella	195	" and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be . But you know what I mean . I have no softness there , no - sympathy - sentiment - nonsense . "
111129	111134	111136	111136	Estella	195	" I am serious , "
111157	111177	111145	111145	her	195	" if we are to be thrown much together , you had better believe it at once . No ! "
111187	111204	111145	111145	her	195	" I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere . I have never had any such thing . "
111307	111313	111315	111315	Estella	195	" What is the matter ? "
111317	111323	111315	111315	Estella	195	" Are you scared again ? "
111324	111338	111339	111339	I	0	" I should be , if I believed what you said just now , "
111347	111432	111339	111339	I	0	" Then you do n't ? Very well . It is said , at any rate . Miss Havisham will soon be expecting you at your old post , though I think that might be laid aside now , with other old belongings . Let us make one more round of the garden , and then go in . Come ! You shall not shed tears for my cruelty to - day ; you shall be my Page , and give me your shoulder . "
111859	111875	111847	111847	she	223	" Is she beautiful , graceful , well - grown ? Do you admire her ? "
111876	111886	111887	111887	She	223	" Everybody must who sees her , Miss Havisham . "
111910	111926	111904	111904	she	223	" Love her , love her , love her ! How does she use you ? "
111945	112002	111942	111942	she	223	" Love her , love her , love her ! If she favors you , love her . If she wounds you , love her . If she tears your heart to pieces , - and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper , - love her , love her , love her ! "
112040	112082	112083	112083	She	223	" Hear me , Pip ! I adopted her , to be loved . I bred her and educated her , to be loved . I developed her into what she is , that she might be loved . Love her ! "
112136	112142	112144	112144	she	223	" I 'll tell you , "
112153	112198	112144	112144	she	223	" what real love is . It is blind devotion , unquestioning self - humiliation , utter submission , trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world , giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter - as I did ! "
112441	112446	112427	112427	he	1805	" Indeed ? Singular ! "
112498	112504	112505	112505	he	1805	" As punctual as ever , "
112513	112542	112543	112543	I	0	" How do you do , Pip ? Shall I give you a ride , Miss Havisham ? Once round ? And so you are here , Pip ? "
112569	112577	112566	112566	he	1805	" Ah ! Very fine young lady ! "
112614	112628	112630	112630	he	1805	" Well , Pip ! How often have you seen Miss Estella before ? "
112639	112643	112630	112630	he	1805	" How often ? "
112644	112655	112674	112675	Miss Havisham	223	" Ah ! How many times ? Ten thousand times ? "
112656	112664	112630	112630	he	1805	" Oh ! Certainly not so many . "
112665	112668	112674	112675	Miss Havisham	223	" Twice ? "
112669	112672	112630	112630	he	1805	" Jaggers , "
112682	112696	112697	112697	He	1805	" leave my Pip alone , and go with him to your dinner . "
112767	112770	112761	112761	I	0	" Never . "
112771	112778	112779	112779	he	1805	" And never will , Pip , "
112787	112826	112779	112779	he	1805	" She has never allowed herself to be seen doing either , since she lived this present life of hers . She wanders about in the night , and then lays hands on such food as she takes . "

112836	112844	112834	112834	I	0	" may I ask you a question ? "
112845	112849	112851	112851	he	1805	" You may , "
112853	112866	112851	112851	he	1805	" and I may decline to answer it . Put your question . "
112867	112878	112879	112879	I	0	" Estella 's name . Is it Havisham or - ? "
112885	112889	112891	112891	he	1805	" Or what ? "
112893	112898	112891	112891	he	1805	" Is it Havisham ? "
112899	112904	112915	112915	she	2404	" It is Havisham . "
113776	113786	113771	113772	Miss Havisham	223	" Love her , love her , love her ! "

114009	114024	114026	114027	my guardian	1805	" Why of course he is not the right sort of man , Pip , "
114037	114055	114026	114027	my guardian	1805	" because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man . "
114099	114105	114106	114106	he	1805	" Very good , Pip , "
114114	114127	114106	114106	he	1805	" I 'll go round presently , and pay our friend off . "
114156	114163	114169	114169	his	1805	" Oh no he wo n't , "
114180	114193	114169	114169	his	1805	" I should like to see him argue the question with me . "
114574	114583	114555	114555	he	5407	" Hold me ! I 'm so frightened ! "
114870	114876	114867	114867	his	5407	" Do n't know yah ! "
114937	114957	114962	114962	his	5407	" Do n't know yah , do n't know yah , ' pon my soul do n't know yah ! "
115399	115413	115394	115394	I	0	" My dear Herbert , I have something very particular to tell you . "
115414	115419	115420	115420	he	265	" My dear Handel , "
115423	115432	115420	115420	he	265	" I shall esteem and respect your confidence . "
115433	115440	115442	115442	I	0	" It concerns myself , Herbert , "
115444	115450	115442	115442	I	0	" and one other person . "
115488	115491	115493	115493	I	0	" Herbert , "
115502	115511	115493	115493	I	0	" I love - I adore - Estella . "
115527	115532	115517	115517	Herbert	265	" Exactly . Well ? "
115533	115546	115517	115517	Herbert	265	" Well , Herbert ? Is that all you say ? Well ? "
115547	115554	115556	115556	Herbert	265	" What next , I mean ? "
115558	115565	115556	115556	Herbert	265	" Of course I know that . "
115566	115573	115575	115575	I.	0	" How do you know it ? "
115576	115590	115575	115575	I.	0	" How do I know it , Handel ? Why , from you . "
115591	115597	115556	115556	Herbert	265	" I never told you . "
115598	115692	115556	115556	Herbert	265	" Told me ! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut , but I have had senses to perceive it . You have always adored her , ever since I have known you . You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together . Told me ! Why , you have always told me all day long . When you told me your own story , you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her , when you were very young indeed . "
115693	115699	115701	115701	I	0	" Very well , then , "
115714	115756	115701	115701	I	0	" I have never left off adoring her . And she has come back , a most beautiful and most elegant creature . And I saw her yesterday . And if I adored her before , I now doubly adore her . "
115757	115765	115767	115767	Herbert	265	" Lucky for you then , Handel , "
115769	115820	115767	115767	Herbert	265	" that you are picked out for her and allotted to her . Without encroaching on forbidden ground , we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact . Have you any idea yet , of Estella 's views on the adoration question ? "
115827	115840	115842	115842	I.	0	" Oh ! She is thousands of miles away , from me , "
115843	115864	115842	115842	I.	0	" Patience , my dear Handel : time enough , time enough . But you have something more to say ? "
115865	115873	115874	115874	I	0	" I am ashamed to say it , "
115877	115928	115874	115874	I	0	" and yet it 's no worse to say it than to think it . You call me a lucky fellow . Of course , I am . I was a blacksmith 's boy but yesterday ; I am - what shall I say I am - to - day ? "
115929	115941	115943	115943	Herbert	265	" Say a good fellow , if you want a phrase , "
115957	115980	115949	115949	his	265	" a good fellow , with impetuosity and hesitation , boldness and diffidence , action and dreaming , curiously mixed in him . "
116017	116033	116034	116034	I	0	" When I ask what I am to call myself to - day , Herbert , "
116038	116089	116034	116034	I	0	" I suggest what I have in my thoughts . You say I am lucky . I know I have done nothing to raise myself in life , and that Fortune alone has raised me ; that is being very lucky . And yet , when I think of Estella - "
116090	116100	116101	116101	Herbert	265	" And when do n't you , you know ? "
116121	116197	116113	116113	I	0	" - Then , my dear Herbert , I can not tell you how dependent and uncertain I feel , and how exposed to hundreds of chances . Avoiding forbidden ground , as you did just now , I may still say that on the constancy of one person naming no person all my expectations depend . And at the best , how indefinite and unsatisfactory , only to know so vaguely what they are ! "
116224	116229	116230	116230	Herbert	265	" Now , Handel , "
116240	116377	116378	116378	I	0	" it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion , we are looking into our gift - horse 's mouth with a magnifying - glass . Likewise , it seems to me that , concentrating our attention on the examination , we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal . Did n't you tell me that your guardian , Mr. Jaggers , told you in the beginning , that you were not endowed with expectations only ? And even if he had not told you so , - though that is a very large If , I grant , - could you believe that of all men in London , Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his ground ? "
116421	116431	116433	116433	Herbert	265	" I should think it was a strong point , "
116435	116514	116433	116433	Herbert	265	" and I should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger ; as to the rest , you must bide your guardian 's time , and he must bide his client 's time . You 'll be one - and - twenty before you know where you are , and then perhaps you 'll get some further enlightenment . At all events , you 'll be nearer getting it , for it must come at last . "
116515	116523	116525	116525	I	0	" What a hopeful disposition you have ! "
116533	116539	116541	116541	Herbert	265	" I ought to have , "
116543	116596	116541	116541	Herbert	265	" for I have not much else . I must acknowledge , by the by , that the good sense of what I have just said is not my own , but my father 's . The only remark I ever heard him make on your story , was the final one , "
116613	116654	116605	116606	Mr. Jaggers	237	" And now before I say anything more about my father , or my father 's son , and repay confidence with confidence , I want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment , - positively repulsive . "
116655	116661	116663	116663	I.	2483	" You wo n't succeed , "
116664	116670	116672	116672	he	237	" O yes I shall ! "
116674	116695	116698	116698	he	237	" One , two , three , and now I am in for it . Handel , my good fellow ; "
116713	116799	116705	116705	he	237	" I have been thinking since we have been talking with our feet on this fender , that Estella surely can not be a condition of your inheritance , if she was never referred to by your guardian . Am I right in so understanding what you have told me , as that he never referred to her , directly or indirectly , in any way ? Never even hinted , for instance , that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately ? "
116800	116803	116698	116698	he	237	" Never . "
116804	116849	116850	116850	I	0	" Now , Handel , I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes , upon my soul and honor ! Not being bound to her , can you not detach yourself from her ? - I told you I should be disagreeable . "
116929	116937	116938	116938	Herbert	265	" Yes ; but my dear Handel , "
116953	117014	116938	116938	Herbert	265	" its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic , renders it very serious . Think of her bringing - up , and think of Miss Havisham . Think of what she is herself now I am repulsive and you abominate me . This may lead to miserable things . "
117015	117022	117024	117024	I	0	" I know it , Herbert , "
117033	117041	117024	117024	I	0	" but I ca n't help it . "
117042	117049	116938	116938	Herbert	265	" You ca n't detach yourself ? "
117050	117055	116938	116938	Herbert	265	" No . Impossible ! "
117056	117064	117024	117024	I	0	" You ca n't try , Handel ? "
117065	117070	116938	116938	Herbert	265	" No . Impossible ! "
117071	117074	117076	117076	Herbert	265	" Well ! "
117096	117107	117076	117076	Herbert	265	" now I 'll endeavor to make myself agreeable again ! "
117177	117226	117165	117165	he	265	" I was going to say a word or two , Handel , concerning my father and my father 's son . I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father 's son to remark that my father 's establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping . "
117227	117235	117237	117237	I	0	" There is always plenty , Herbert , "
117244	117363	117237	117237	I	0	" O yes ! and so the dustman says , I believe , with the strongest approval , and so does the marine - store shop in the back street . Gravely , Handel , for the subject is grave enough , you know how it is as well as I do . I suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up ; but if ever there was , the time is gone . May I ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking , down in your part of the country , that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married ? "
117378	117383	117372	117372	I	0	" Is it so ? "
117384	117390	117392	117392	Herbert	265	" I do n't know , "
117394	117499	117392	117392	Herbert	265	" that 's what I want to know . Because it is decidedly the case with us . My poor sister Charlotte , who was next me and died before she was fourteen , was a striking example . Little Jane is the same . In her desire to be matrimonially established , you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss . Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew . And indeed , I think we are all engaged , except the baby . "
117500	117505	117507	117507	I.	2490	" Then you are ? "
117508	117512	117514	117514	Herbert	265	" I am , "
117516	117523	117514	117514	Herbert	265	" but it 's a secret . "
117562	117569	117570	117570	I	0	" May I ask the name ? "
117573	117578	117580	117580	Herbert	265	" Name of Clara , "
117582	117587	117580	117580	Herbert	265	" Live in London ? "
117588	117597	117599	117599	Herbert	265	" Yes , perhaps I ought to mention , "
117617	117652	117599	117599	Herbert	265	" that she is rather below my mother 's nonsensical family notions . Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger - ships . I think he was a species of purser . "
117653	117659	117661	117661	I.	0	" What is he now ? "
117662	117669	117671	117671	Herbert	265	" He 's an invalid now , "
117673	117678	117671	117671	Herbert	265	" Living on - ? "

117710	117757	117699	117699	I	0	" I have never seen him , for he has always kept his room overhead , since I have known Clara . But I have heard him constantly . He makes tremendous rows , - roars , and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument . "
117777	117786	117788	117788	I.	0	" Do n't you expect to see him ? "
117789	117800	117802	117802	Herbert	265	" O yes , I constantly expect to see him , "
117804	117833	117802	117802	Herbert	265	" because I never hear him , without expecting him to come tumbling through the ceiling . But I do n't know how long the rafters may hold . "
117882	117899	117869	117869	He	265	" But you ca n't marry , you know , while you 're looking about you . "
117971	117977	117978	117978	I	0	" And bless my heart , "
117983	117990	117978	117978	I	0	" it 's to - night ! "

119466	119469	119471	119471	I.	0	" Oh ! "
119472	119480	119471	119471	I.	0	" Yes . Shall we follow you ? "
119481	119488	119455	119455	Herbert	265	" A few steps , please . "
119502	119515	119497	119497	he	265	" How did you think he looked ? - I dressed him . "
119573	119581	119565	119565	I	0	" When he come to the grave , "
119586	119625	119626	119626	I	0	" he showed his cloak beautiful . But , judging from the wing , it looked to me that when he see the ghost in the queen 's apartment , he might have made more of his stockings . "
119696	119699	119701	119702	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Gentlemen , "
119704	119757	119701	119702	Mr. Wopsle	169	" I am proud to see you . I hope , Mr. Pip , you will excuse my sending round . I had the happiness to know you in former times , and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged , on the noble and the affluent . "
119779	119787	119789	119793	the owner of that property	2558	" Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver , "
119795	119838	119842	119842	he	315	" or you 'll bust 'em . Bust 'em , and you 'll bust five - and - thirty shillings . Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair . Keep quiet in your chair now , and leave 'em to me . "
119913	119929	119930	119930	Herbert	265	" Gentlemen , how did it seem to you , to go , in front ? "
119941	119944	119930	119930	Herbert	265	" Capitally . "
119948	119951	119946	119946	I	0	" Capitally . "
119952	119965	119967	119968	Mr. Waldengarver	315	" How did you like my reading of the character , gentlemen ? "
119987	119992	119979	119979	Herbert	265	" Massive and concrete . "
120013	120018	119994	119994	I	0	" Massive and concrete . "
120019	120030	120032	120033	Mr. Waldengarver	315	" I am glad to have your approbation , gentlemen , "
120064	120076	120078	120094	the man who was on his knees , " in which you 're out in your reading	6446	" But I 'll tell you one thing , Mr. Waldengarver , "
120086	120196	120078	120094	the man who was on his knees , " in which you 're out in your reading	6446	" in which you 're out in your reading . Now mind ! I do n't care who says contrairy ; I tell you so . You 're out in your reading of Hamlet when you get your legs in profile . The last Hamlet as I dressed , made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal , till I got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins , and then at that rehearsal which was the last I went in front , sir , to the back of the pit , and whenever his reading brought him into profile , I called out "
120204	120213	120214	120215	Mr. Waldengarver	315	" And at night his reading was lovely . "
120225	120235	120214	120215	Mr. Waldengarver	315	" a faithful Dependent - I overlook his folly ; "
120241	120263	120264	120264	Herbert	265	" My view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here ; but they will improve , they will improve . "
120278	120285	120287	120288	Mr. Waldengarver	315	" Did you observe , gentlemen , "
120290	120315	120287	120288	Mr. Waldengarver	315	" that there was a man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service , - I mean , the representation ? "
120333	120341	120330	120330	I	0	" He was drunk , no doubt . "
120342	120349	120351	120352	Mr. Wopsle	169	" O dear no , sir , "
120354	120377	120351	120352	Mr. Wopsle	169	" not drunk . His employer would see to that , sir . His employer would not allow him to be drunk . "
120378	120384	120386	120386	I.	0	" You know his employer ? "
120404	120412	120414	120414	he	169	" You must have observed , gentlemen , "
120416	120474	120414	120414	he	169	" an ignorant and a blatant ass , with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity , who went through - I will not say sustained - the role if I may use a French expression of Claudius , King of Denmark . That is his employer , gentlemen . Such is the profession ! "
120794	120845	120846	120846	Yours	2571	" I am to come to London the day after to - morrow by the midday coach . I believe it was settled you should meet me ? At all events Miss Havisham has that impression , and I write in obedience to it . She sends you her regard . "
120850	121012	120848	120848	ESTELLA	195	" If there had been time , I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion ; but as there was not , I was fain to be content with those I had . My appetite vanished instantly , and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived . Not that its arrival brought me either ; for , then I was worse than ever , and began haunting the coach - office in Wood Street , Cheapside , before the coach had left the Blue Boar in our town . For all that I knew this perfectly well , I still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach - office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time ; and in this condition of unreason I had performed the first half - hour of a watch of four or five hours , when Wemmick ran against me . "
121018	121022	121015	121016	Mr. Pip	241	" said he ; "
121038	121065	121035	121035	your	241	" I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach , and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged . "
121070	121074	121077	121078	the Aged	293	" said Wemmick , "
121142	121143	121135	121135	you	0	" "
121148	121160	121135	121135	you	0	" said I , for he was tending in that direction . "
121166	121170	121135	121135	you	0	" returned Wemmick , "
121217	121218	121214	121215	our client	2576	" "
121226	121230	121214	121215	our client	2576	" I asked . "
121239	121246	121214	121215	our client	2576	" answered Wemmick , very drily . "
121273	121274	121270	121270	you	0	" "
121281	121285	121270	121270	you	0	" I remarked . "
121288	121301	121302	121302	you	0	" said Wemmick , touching me on the breast with his forefinger ; "
121327	121653	121322	121322	you	0	" I had so much time to spare , that the proposal came as a relief , notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach - office . Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether I had time to walk with him , I went into the office , and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper , the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected , - which I knew beforehand , quite as well as he . I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick , and affecting to consult my watch , and to be surprised by the information I had received , accepted his offer . We were at Newgate in a few minutes , and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules , into the interior of the jail . At that time jails were much neglected , and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoing - and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment - was still far off . So felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers , to say nothing of paupers , and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup . It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in , and a potman was going his rounds with beer ; and the prisoners , behind bars in yards , were buying beer , and talking to friends ; and a frowzy , ugly , disorderly , depressing scene it was . It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among his plants . This was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night , and saying , "
121667	121671	121660	121660	you	209	" and also , "
121697	121879	121681	121681	I	0	" Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers , - always singly , - Wemmick with his post - office in an immovable state , looked at them while in conference , as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made , since last observed , towards coming out in full blow at their trial . He was highly popular , and I found that he took the familiar department of Mr. Jaggers 's business ; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers hung about him too , forbidding approach beyond certain limits . His personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod , and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands , and then tightening the post - office , and putting his hands in his pockets . In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees , and then Mr. Wemmick , backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced , said , "
121992	122010	122012	122018	the man I shall shake hands with	2586	" Thus , we walked through Wemmick 's greenhouse , until he turned to me and said , "
122020	122138	122139	122139	Colonel	2587	" I should have done so , without the preparation , as he had shaken hands with no one yet . Almost as soon as he had spoken , a portly upright man whom I can see now , as I write in a well - worn olive - colored frock - coat , with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion , and eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them , came up to a corner of the bars , and put his hand to his hat - which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth - with a half - serious and half - jocose military salute . "
122144	122148	122139	122139	Colonel	2587	" said Wemmick ; "
122155	122156	122153	122153	Colonel	320	" "
122163	122164	122160	122161	Mr. Wemmick	254	" "
122184	122185	122182	122182	Colonel	320	" "
122202	122203	122197	122197	I	0	" "
122208	122214	122215	122215	you	2587	" said Wemmick , coolly , "
122220	122227	122215	122215	you	2587	" Then , turning to me , "
122245	122249	122215	122215	you	2587	" I said , "
122252	122288	122289	122289	I	0	" and the man 's eyes looked at me , and then looked over my head , and then looked all round me , and then he drew his hand across his lips and laughed . "
122302	122308	122291	122291	I	0	" he said to Wemmick . "
122311	122316	122291	122291	I	0	" returned my friend , "
122323	122324	122325	122325	I	0	" "
122341	122354	122338	122339	Mr. Wemmick	254	" said the man , stretching out his hand between two bars . "
122357	122366	122355	122355	Thankye	321	" said Wemmick , shaking hands with him . "
122373	122374	122371	122371	Colonel	320	" "
122390	122402	122387	122388	Mr. Wemmick	254	" said the man , unwilling to let his hand go , "
122421	122422	122423	122423	I	0	" "
122432	122436	122423	122423	I	0	" said Wemmick . "
122449	122458	122441	122441	you	0	" The man looked up at the sky . "
122492	122493	122484	122484	you	4451	" "
122501	122502	122484	122484	you	4451	" "
122506	122510	122484	122484	you	4451	" said Wemmick , "
122526	122542	122543	122544	A Coiner	2601	" They shook hands again , and as we walked away Wemmick said to me , "
122592	122673	122676	122677	Mr. Wemmick	254	" With that , he looked back , and nodded at this dead plant , and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard , as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place . As we came out of the prison through the lodge , I found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys , no less than by those whom they held in charge . "
122679	122707	122676	122677	Mr. Wemmick	254	" said the turnkey , who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates , and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other , "
122740	122741	122733	122733	he	237	" "
122749	122753	122745	122745	you	254	" returned Wemmick . "
122761	122766	122745	122745	you	254	" said the turnkey . "
122780	122794	122777	122778	Mr. Pip	241	" remarked Wemmick , turning to me with his post - office elongated . "
122821	122822	122813	122813	'em	2606	" "
122839	122853	122855	122855	he	2608	" asked the turnkey , with a grin at Mr. Wemmick 's humor . "
122862	122866	122855	122855	he	2608	" cried Wemmick , "
122894	122895	122887	122888	Mr. Pip	241	" "
122899	122907	122908	122908	he	2608	" said the turnkey , grinning again , "
122915	122916	122911	122912	Mr. Jaggers	237	" "
122919	122934	122908	122908	he	2608	" cried Wemmick , suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way , "
122981	123012	122970	122970	him	2607	" The turnkey laughed , and gave us good day , and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street . "
123019	123038	123016	123017	Mr. Pip	241	" said Wemmick , gravely in my ear , as he took my arm to be more confidential ; "
123132	123592	123124	123124	he	237	" I was very much impressed , and not for the first time , by my guardian 's subtlety . To confess the truth , I very heartily wished , and not for the first time , that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities . Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain , where suppliants for Mr. Jaggers 's notice were lingering about as usual , and I returned to my watch in the street of the coach - office , with some three hours on hand . I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime ; that , in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening , I should have first encountered it ; that , it should have reappeared on two occasions , starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone ; that , it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement . While my mind was thus engaged , I thought of the beautiful young Estella , proud and refined , coming towards me , and I thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her . I wished that Wemmick had not met me , or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him , so that , of all days in the year on this day , I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes . I beat the prison dust off my feet as I sauntered to and fro , and I shook it out of my dress , and I exhaled its air from my lungs . So contaminated did I feel , remembering who was coming , that the coach came quickly after all , and I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick 's conservatory , when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me . What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed ? Chapter XXXIII In her furred travelling - dress , Estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet , even in my eyes . Her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before , and I thought I saw Miss Havisham 's influence in the change . We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me , and when it was all collected I remembered - having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile - that I knew nothing of her destination . "
123599	123604	123593	123593	I	0	" she told me . "
123703	123736	123702	123702	I.	0	" As she looked at me in giving me the purse , I hoped there was an inner meaning in her words . She said them slightingly , but not with displeasure . "
123755	123756	123749	123749	you	195	" "
123786	123966	123776	123776	you	2620	" She drew her arm through mine , as if it must be done , and I requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life , to show us a private sitting - room . Upon that , he pulled out a napkin , as if it were a magic clew without which he could n't find the way up stairs , and led us to the black hole of the establishment , fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous article , considering the hole 's proportions , an anchovy sauce - cruet , and somebody 's pattens . On my objecting to this retreat , he took us into another room with a dinner - table for thirty , and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy - book under a bushel of coal - dust . Having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head , he took my order ; which , proving to be merely , "
123973	124092	123776	123776	you	2620	" sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind . I was , and I am , sensible that the air of this chamber , in its strong combination of stable with soup - stock , might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well , and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department . Yet the room was all in all to me , Estella being in it . I thought that with her I could have been happy there for life . I was not at all happy there at the time , observe , and I knew it well . "
124102	124107	124095	124095	you	2624	" I asked Estella . "
124114	124118	124136	124136	she	2625	" said she , "
124159	124160	124136	124136	she	2625	" "
124172	124173	124163	124163	you	2624	" "
124180	124190	124191	124191	You	2624	" She answered so carelessly , that I said , "
124203	124204	124191	124191	You	2624	" "
124219	124226	124227	124227	you	2624	" said Estella , smiling delightfully , "
124255	124256	124252	124253	Mr. Pocket	265	" "
124266	124278	124257	124257	I	0	" It appeared to me that I was losing a chance . "
124282	124286	124257	124257	I	0	" repeated Estella . "
124298	124299	124257	124257	I	0	" "
124304	124311	124257	124257	I	0	" said Estella , quite composedly , "
124336	124337	124321	124322	Mr. Matthew	211	" "
124348	124350	124355	124355	his	2276	" - "
124358	124362	124355	124355	his	2276	" interposed Estella , "
124388	124389	124372	124372	he	2276	" "
124401	124402	124393	124393	I	0	" "
124418	124438	124403	124403	You	2624	" said Estella , nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying , "
124492	124493	124494	124494	They	2640	" "
124503	124557	124558	124558	I	0	" Instead of answering , Estella burst out laughing . This was very singular to me , and I looked at her in considerable perplexity . When she left off - and she had not laughed languidly , but with real enjoyment - I said , in my diffident way with her , - "
124576	124577	124581	124581	you	2624	" "
124588	124592	124593	124593	You	2624	" said Estella . "
124618	124685	124593	124593	You	2624	" She laughed again , and even now when she had told me why , her laughter was very singular to me , for I could not doubt its being genuine , and yet it seemed too much for the occasion . I thought there must really be something more here than I knew ; she saw the thought in my mind , and answered it . "
124694	124698	124692	124692	you	2624	" said Estella , "
124823	124864	124820	124820	I	0	" It was no laughing matter with Estella now , nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place . I would not have been the cause of that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap . "
124872	124876	124867	124867	I	0	" said Estella . "
124955	124985	124986	124986	You	2624	" As she gave it to me playfully , - for her darker mood had been but Momentary , - I held it and put it to my lips . "
124990	124994	124996	124996	you	2624	" said Estella , "
125021	125022	125003	125003	you	2624	" "
125028	125031	125032	125032	I	0	" said I. "

125082	125097	125079	125079	you	0	" I leaned down , and her calm face was like a statue 's . "
125100	125113	125114	125114	you	2624	" said Estella , gliding away the instant I touched her cheek , "
125134	125480	125126	125126	you	2624	" Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us , and we were mere puppets , gave me pain ; but everything in our intercourse did give me pain . Whatever her tone with me happened to be , I could put no trust in it , and build no hope on it ; and yet I went on against trust and against hope . Why repeat it a thousand times ? So it always was . I rang for the tea , and the waiter , reappearing with his magic clew , brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment , but of tea not a glimpse . A teaboard , cups and saucers , plates , knives and forks including carvers , spoons various , saltcellars , a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover , Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley , a pale loaf with a powdered head , two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread , and ultimately a fat family urn ; which the waiter staggered in with , expressing in his countenance burden and suffering . After a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment , he at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs . These I steeped in hot water , and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I do n't know what for Estella . The bill paid , and the waiter remembered , and the ostler not forgotten , and the chambermaid taken into consideration , - in a word , the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity , and Estella 's purse much lightened , - we got into our post - coach and drove away . Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street , we were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed . "
125486	125523	125126	125126	you	2624	" Estella asked me . I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it , and then told her . As she looked at it , and drew in her head again , murmuring , "
125526	125539	125540	125541	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration . "
125543	125557	125540	125541	Mr. Jaggers	237	" said I , by way of putting it neatly on somebody else , "
125577	125578	125579	125579	He	237	" "
125592	125601	125589	125589	I	0	" said Estella , in a low voice . "

125728	125925	125687	125687	you	0	" I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her ; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in Gerrard Street , if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas . It seemed , while it lasted , to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before ; and when we were out of it , I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning . So we fell into other talk , and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling , and about what parts of London lay on this side of it , and what on that . The great city was almost new to her , she told me , for she had never left Miss Havisham 's neighborhood until she had gone to France , and she had merely passed through London then in going and returning . I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here ? To that she emphatically said "
125929	126067	125687	125687	you	0	" and no more . It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me ; that she made herself winning , and would have won me even if the task had needed pains . Yet this made me none the happier , for even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others , I should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do it , and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush it and throw it away . When we passed through Hammersmith , I showed her where Mr. Matthew Pocket lived , and said it was no great way from Richmond , and that I hoped I should see her sometimes . "
126101	126118	126126	126126	mother	2659	" I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of ? "
126147	126148	126149	126149	I	0	" "
126161	126162	126151	126152	Miss Havisham	223	" "
126177	126191	126175	126175	Pip	241	" said Estella , with a sigh , as if she were tired ; "
126225	127323	127324	127324	Gentlemen	4982	" It was the first time she had ever called me by my name . Of course she did so purposely , and knew that I should treasure it up . We came to Richmond all too soon , and our destination there was a house by the green , - a staid old house , where hoops and powder and patches , embroidered coats , rolled stockings , ruffles and swords , had had their court days many a time . Some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts ; but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off , and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest . A bell with an old voice - which I dare say in its time had often said to the house , Here is the green farthingale , Here is the diamond - hilted sword , Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire - sounded gravely in the moonlight , and two cherry - colored maids came fluttering out to receive Estella . The doorway soon absorbed her boxes , and she gave me her hand and a smile , and said good night , and was absorbed likewise . And still I stood looking at the house , thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with her , and knowing that I never was happy with her , but always miserable . I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith , and I got in with a bad heart - ache , and I got out with a worse heart - ache . At our own door , I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover ; and I envied her little lover , in spite of his being subject to Flopson . Mr. Pocket was out lecturing ; for , he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy , and his treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best text - books on those themes . But Mrs. Pocket was at home , and was in a little difficulty , on account of the baby 's having been accommodated with a needle - case to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the Foot Guards of Millers . And more needles were missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic . Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice , and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind , I had some notion in my heart - ache of begging him to accept my confidence . But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign remedy for baby , I thought - Well - No , I would n't . Chapter XXXIV As I had grown accustomed to my expectations , I had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me . Their influence on my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible , but I knew very well that it was not all good . I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe . My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy . When I woke up in the night , - like Camilla , - I used to think , with a weariness on my spirits , that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham 's face , and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest old forge . Many a time of an evening , when I sat alone looking at the fire , I thought , after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home . Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind , that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production . That is to say , supposing I had had no expectations , and yet had had Estella to think of , I could not make out to my satisfaction that I should have done much better . Now , concerning the influence of my position on others , I was in no such difficulty , and so I perceived - though dimly enough perhaps - that it was not beneficial to anybody , and , above all , that it was not beneficial to Herbert . My lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford , corrupted the simplicity of his life , and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets . I was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor arts they practised ; because such littlenesses were their natural bent , and would have been evoked by anybody else , if I had left them slumbering . But Herbert 's was a very different case , and it often caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work , and placing the Canary - breasted Avenger at his disposal . So now , as an infallible way of making little ease great ease , I began to contract a quantity of debt . I could hardly begin but Herbert must begin too , so he soon followed . At Startop 's suggestion , we put ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove : the object of which institution I have never divined , if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight , to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner , and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs . I know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished , that Herbert and I understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society : which ran "
127343	128066	127324	127324	Gentlemen	4982	" The Finches spent their money foolishly the Hotel we dined at was in Covent Garden , and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle , at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own , and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners . Occasionally , he shot himself out of his equipage headforemost over the apron ; and I saw him on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way - like coals . But here I anticipate a little , for I was not a Finch , and could not be , according to the sacred laws of the society , until I came of age . In my confidence in my own resources , I would willingly have taken Herbert 's expenses on myself ; but Herbert was proud , and I could make no such proposal to him . So he got into difficulties in every direction , and continued to look about him . When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company , I noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfast - time ; that he began to look about him more hopefully about mid - day ; that he drooped when he came into dinner ; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance , rather clearly , after dinner ; that he all but realized Capital towards midnight ; and that at about two o'clock in the morning , he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America , with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune . I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week , and when I was at Hammersmith I haunted Richmond , whereof separately by and by . Herbert would often come to Hammersmith when I was there , and I think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for , had not appeared yet . But in the general tumbling up of the family , his tumbling out in life somewhere , was a thing to transact itself somehow . In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew grayer , and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the hair . While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool , read her book of dignities , lost her pocket - handkerchief , told us about her grandpapa , and taught the young idea how to shoot , by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her notice . As I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me , I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard 's Inn . We spent as much money as we could , and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us . We were always more or less miserable , and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition . There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves , and a skeleton truth that we never did . To the best of my belief , our case was in the last aspect a rather common one . Every morning , with an air ever new , Herbert went into the City to look about him . I often paid him a visit in the dark back - room in which he consorted with an ink - jar , a hat - peg , a coal - box , a string - box , an almanac , a desk and stool , and a ruler ; and I do not remember that I ever saw him do anything else but look about him . If we all did what we undertake to do , as faithfully as Herbert did , we might live in a Republic of the Virtues . He had nothing else to do , poor fellow , except at a certain hour of every afternoon to "
128071	128155	128069	128069	Lloyd	326	" - in observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal , I think . He never did anything else in connection with Lloyd 's that I could find out , except come back again . When he felt his case unusually serious , and that he positively must find an opening , he would go on ' Change at a busy time , and walk in and out , in a kind of gloomy country dance figure , among the assembled magnates . "
128158	128175	128069	128069	Lloyd	326	" says Herbert to me , coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions , "
128207	128313	128203	128203	I	0	" If we had been less attached to one another , I think we must have hated one another regularly every morning . I detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance , and could not endure the sight of the Avenger 's livery ; which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the four - and - twenty hours . As we got more and more into debt , breakfast became a hollower and hollower form , and , being on one occasion at breakfast - time threatened by letter with legal proceedings , "
128318	128327	128203	128203	I	0	" as my local paper might put it , "
128331	128409	128410	128410	My	0	" I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feet , - so that he was actually in the air , like a booted Cupid , - for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll . At certain times - meaning at uncertain times , for they depended on our humor - I would say to Herbert , as if it were a remarkable discovery , - "

128426	128456	128424	128424	Handel	266	" Herbert would say to me , in all sincerity , if you will believe me , those very words were on my lips , by a strange coincidence . "
128457	128462	128463	128463	I	0	" Then , Herbert , "
128467	128475	128463	128463	I	0	" let us look into out affairs . "

132047	132236	132237	132237	Biddy	188	" They are very slight , poor thing . She had been in one of her bad states - though they had got better of late , rather than worse - for four days , when she came out of it in the evening , just at tea - time , and said quite plainly , ' Joe . ' As she had never said any word for a long while , I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge . She made signs to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her , and wanted me to put her arms round his neck . So I put them round his neck , and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied . And so she presently said ' Joe ' again , and once ' Pardon , ' and once ' Pip . ' And so she never lifted her head up any more , and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed , because we found she was gone . "
132263	132271	132237	132237	Biddy	188	" Nothing was ever discovered , Biddy ? "

132287	132305	132237	132237	Biddy	188	" I should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the quarries . "

132802	132819	132821	132821	Biddy	188	" Are you quite sure , then , that you WILL come to see him often ? "

132866	132896	132851	132851	I	0	" This really is a very bad side of human nature ! Do n't say any more , if you please , Biddy . This shocks me very much . "

133580	133596	133578	133578	he	1805	" I must call you Mr. Pip to - day . Congratulations , Mr. Pip . "
133616	133624	133626	133627	my guardian	1805	" Take a chair , Mr. Pip , "
133701	133707	133708	133709	my guardian	1805	" Now my young friend , "
133722	133735	133708	133709	my guardian	1805	" I am going to have a word or two with you . "
133736	133743	133752	133753	Mr. Jaggers	237	" If you please , sir . "

133912	133925	133927	133928	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Now , I have asked you a question , my friend , "
133930	133938	133927	133928	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Have you anything to ask me ? "
133939	133964	133904	133904	his	237	" Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several questions , sir ; but I remember your prohibition . "
133965	133969	133971	133972	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Ask one , "
133974	133988	133971	133972	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Is my benefactor to be made known to me to - day ? "
133989	133995	133904	133904	his	237	" No . Ask another . "
133996	134007	133904	133904	his	237	" Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon ? "
134008	134015	134017	134018	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Waive that , a moment , "
134020	134025	134017	134018	Mr. Jaggers	237	" and ask another . "
134044	134055	134026	134026	I	0	" Have - I - anything to receive , sir ? "
134065	134074	134059	134060	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I thought we should come to it ! "
134097	134103	134105	134106	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Now , Mr. Pip , "
134108	134144	134105	134106	Mr. Jaggers	237	" attend , if you please . You have been drawing pretty freely here ; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick 's cash - book ; but you are in debt , of course ? "
134145	134156	134059	134060	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I am afraid I must say yes , sir . "
134157	134169	134171	134172	Mr. Jaggers	237	" You know you must say yes ; do n't you ? "
134174	134179	134171	134172	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Yes , sir . "
134180	134220	134222	134223	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I do n't ask you what you owe , because you do n't know ; and if you did know , you would n't tell me ; you would say less . Yes , yes , my friend , "
134239	134297	134226	134226	his	237	" it 's likely enough that you think you would n't , but you would . You 'll excuse me , but I know better than you . Now , take this piece of paper in your hand . You have got it ? Very good . Now , unfold it and tell me what it is . "
134298	134306	134308	134308	I	0	" This is a bank - note , "
134310	134316	134308	134308	I	0	" for five hundred pounds . "
134317	134325	134327	134328	Mr. Jaggers	237	" That is a bank - note , "
134330	134353	134327	134328	Mr. Jaggers	237	" for five hundred pounds . And a very handsome sum of money too , I think . You consider it so ? "
134354	134361	134308	134308	I	0	" How could I do otherwise ! "
134362	134370	134372	134373	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Ah ! But answer the question , "
134375	134378	134372	134373	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Undoubtedly . "
134379	134550	134551	134551	I	0	" You consider it , undoubtedly , a handsome sum of money . Now , that handsome sum of money , Pip , is your own . It is a present to you on this day , in earnest of your expectations . And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum , and at no higher rate , you are to live until the donor of the whole appears . That is to say , you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands , and you will draw from Wemmick one hundred and twenty - five pounds per quarter , until you are in communication with the fountain - head , and no longer with the mere agent . As I have told you before , I am the mere agent . I execute my instructions , and I am paid for doing so . I think them injudicious , but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits . "
134577	134585	134587	134587	he	237	" I am not paid , Pip , "
134591	134600	134587	134587	he	237	" to carry your words to any one ; "
134642	134675	134638	134638	I	0	" There was a question just now , Mr. Jaggers , which you desired me to waive for a moment . I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again ? "
134676	134681	134683	134683	he	237	" What is it ? "
134717	134722	134723	134723	I	0	" Is it likely , "
134729	134749	134723	134723	I	0	" that my patron , the fountain - head you have spoken of , Mr. Jaggers , will soon - "
134755	134760	134762	134763	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Will soon what ? "
134765	134777	134762	134763	Mr. Jaggers	237	" That 's no question as it stands , you know . "
134778	134785	134787	134787	I	0	" Will soon come to London , "
134799	134806	134787	134787	I	0	" or summon me anywhere else ? "
134807	134812	134814	134815	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Now , here , "
134831	134857	134814	134815	Mr. Jaggers	237	" we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village . What did I tell you then , Pip ? "
134858	134877	134824	134824	his	237	" You told me , Mr. Jaggers , that it might be years hence when that person appeared . "
134878	134882	134884	134885	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Just so , "
134887	134893	134884	134885	Mr. Jaggers	237	" that 's my answer . "
134956	134970	134974	134974	his	237	" Do you suppose it will still be years hence , Mr. Jaggers ? "
135039	135042	135044	135045	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Come ! "
135061	135119	135120	135120	He	237	" I 'll be plain with you , my friend Pip . That 's a question I must not be asked . You 'll understand that better , when I tell you it 's a question that might compromise me . Come ! I 'll go a little further with you ; I 'll say something more . "
135148	135154	135156	135157	Mr. Jaggers	237	" When that person discloses , "
135162	135216	135160	135160	himself	237	" you and that person will settle your own affairs . When that person discloses , my part in this business will cease and determine . When that person discloses , it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it . And that 's all I have got to say . "
135327	135339	135340	135340	I	0	" If that is all you have to say , sir , "
135343	135354	135340	135340	I	0	" there can be nothing left for me to say . "
135601	135605	135607	135607	I	0	" Mr. Wemmick , "
135609	135626	135607	135607	I	0	" I want to ask your opinion . I am very desirous to serve a friend . "
135652	135656	135657	135657	I	0	" This friend , "
135660	135697	135657	135657	I	0	" is trying to get on in commercial life , but has no money , and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning . Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning . "
135698	135703	135705	135705	Wemmick	254	" With money down ? "
135715	135721	135722	135722	I	0	" With some money down , "
135741	135755	135722	135722	I	0	" with some money down , and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations . "
135756	135760	135762	135762	Wemmick	254	" Mr. Pip , "
135764	135825	135826	135826	He	254	" I should like just to run over with you on my fingers , if you please , the names of the various bridges up as high as Chelsea Reach . Let 's see ; there 's London , one ; Southwark , two ; Blackfriars , three ; Waterloo , four ; Westminster , five ; Vauxhall , six . "
135851	135866	135826	135826	He	254	" There 's as many as six , you see , to choose from . "
135867	135874	135876	135876	I.	2808	" I do n't understand you , "
135877	135885	135887	135887	Wemmick	254	" Choose your bridge , Mr. Pip , "
135889	135948	135949	135949	I	0	" and take a walk upon your bridge , and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch of your bridge , and you know the end of it . Serve a friend with it , and you may know the end of it too , - but it 's a less pleasant and profitable end . "
135968	135974	135976	135976	I.	0	" This is very discouraging , "
135977	135983	135985	135985	Wemmick	254	" Meant to be so , "
135987	135994	135985	135985	Wemmick	254	" Then is it your opinion , "
136003	136010	135995	135995	I	0	" that a man should never - "
136011	136020	136022	136022	Wemmick	254	" - Invest portable property in a friend ? "
136024	136061	136022	136022	Wemmick	254	" Certainly he should not . Unless he wants to get rid of the friend , - and then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him . "
136062	136066	136068	136068	I	0	" And that , "
136070	136079	136068	136068	I	0	" is your deliberate opinion , Mr. Wemmick ? "

136087	136096	136068	136068	I	0	" is my deliberate opinion in this office . "

136118	136128	136112	136112	him	254	" but would that be your opinion at Walworth ? "

136140	136194	136134	136134	he	254	" Walworth is one place , and this office is another . Much as the Aged is one person , and Mr. Jaggers is another . They must not be confounded together . My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth ; none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office . "
136195	136199	136201	136201	I	0	" Very well , "
136206	136222	136201	136201	I	0	" then I shall look you up at Walworth , you may depend upon it . "

136231	136245	136228	136228	he	254	" you will be welcome there , in a private and personal capacity . "
136555	136561	136563	136565	the old man	6015	" My son , sir , "
136572	136624	136563	136565	the old man	6015	" rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in , and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoon 's walk . He is very regular in his walks , is my son . Very regular in everything , is my son . "
136649	136659	136661	136663	the old man	6015	" You made acquaintance with my son , sir , "
136679	136687	136688	136688	I	0	" at his office , I expect ? "
136691	136710	136711	136711	I	0	" Hah ! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at his business , sir ? "
136715	136729	136711	136711	I	0	" Yes ; so they tell me . His business is the Law ? "
136734	136744	136746	136748	the old man	6015	" Which makes it more surprising in my son , "
136750	136768	136746	136748	the old man	6015	" for he was not brought up to the Law , but to the Wine - Coopering . "

136994	137048	137050	137052	the old man	6015	" - Yes , hard of hearing ; having that infirmity coming upon me , my son he went into the Law , and he took charge of me , and he by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property . But returning to what you said , you know , "
137058	137073	137050	137052	the old man	6015	" what I say is , No to be sure ; you 're right . "

137549	137556	137558	137559	Miss Skiffins	332	" And Mr. Wemmick made them , "

138173	138181	138189	138189	he	254	" I thank you ten thousand times . "
138182	138187	138189	138189	he	254	" On the contrary , "
138191	138226	138189	138189	he	254	" I thank you , for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity , still it may be mentioned that there are Newgate cobwebs about , and it brushes them away . "
138643	138654	138640	138640	Wemmick	254	" Now , Aged Parent , tip us the paper . "

140607	140612	140614	140614	I	0	" At any rate , "
140616	140639	140614	140614	I	0	" I have no warning given me just now , for you wrote to me to come to you , this time . "
140640	140645	140647	140647	Estella	195	" That 's true , "
140678	140748	140671	140671	she	195	" The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day at Satis . You are to take me there , and bring me back , if you will . She would rather I did not travel alone , and objects to receiving my maid , for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people . Can you take me ? "
140749	140757	140671	140671	she	195	" Can I take you , Estella ! "
140758	140793	140671	140671	she	195	" You can then ? The day after to - morrow , if you please . You are to pay all charges out of my purse , You hear the condition of your going ? "
140794	140799	140801	140801	I.	2930	" And must obey , "
140981	140996	140997	140997	she	223	" How does she use you , Pip ; how does she use you ? "
141660	141663	141665	141666	Miss Havisham	223	" What ! "
141674	141681	141665	141666	Miss Havisham	223	" are you tired of me ? "
141682	141690	141692	141692	Estella	195	" Only a little tired of myself , "
141716	141724	141726	141727	Miss Havisham	223	" Speak the truth , you ingrate ! "
141737	141744	141731	141731	her	223	" you are tired of me . "
141787	141793	141795	141796	Miss Havisham	223	" You stock and stone ! "
141798	141805	141795	141796	Miss Havisham	223	" You cold , cold heart ! "
141806	141809	141811	141811	Estella	195	" What ? "
141833	141844	141811	141811	Estella	195	" do you reproach me for being cold ? You ? "
141845	141850	141795	141796	Miss Havisham	223	" Are you not ? "
141856	141861	141863	141863	Estella	195	" You should know , "
141865	141900	141863	141863	Estella	195	" I am what you have made me . Take all the praise , take all the blame ; take all the success , take all the failure ; in short , take me . "
141901	141912	141914	141915	Miss Havisham	223	" O , look at her , look at her ! "
141919	141964	141914	141915	Miss Havisham	223	" Look at her so hard and thankless , on the hearth where she was reared ! Where I took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs , and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her ! "
141965	141976	141978	141978	Estella	195	" At least I was no party to the compact , "
141980	142029	141978	141978	Estella	195	" for if I could walk and speak , when it was made , it was as much as I could do . But what would you have ? You have been very good to me , and I owe everything to you . What would you have ? "

142054	142059	142061	142061	Estella	195	" Mother by adoption , "
142091	142159	142051	142052	Miss Havisham	223	" mother by adoption , I have said that I owe everything to you . All I possess is freely yours . All that you have given me , is at your command to have again . Beyond that , I have nothing . And if you ask me to give you , what you never gave me , my gratitude and duty can not do impossibilities . "
142160	142168	142170	142171	Miss Havisham	223	" Did I never give her love ! "
142178	142219	142170	142171	Miss Havisham	223	" Did I never give her a burning love , inseparable from jealousy at all times , and from sharp pain , while she speaks thus to me ! Let her call me mad , let her call me mad ! "
142220	142228	142230	142230	Estella	195	" Why should I call you mad , "
142232	142319	142230	142230	Estella	195	" I , of all people ? Does any one live , who knows what set purposes you have , half as well as I do ? Does any one live , who knows what a steady memory you have , half as well as I do ? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there , learning your lessons and looking up into your face , when your face was strange and frightened me ! "
142320	142324	142326	142327	Miss Havisham	223	" Soon forgotten ! "
142329	142334	142326	142327	Miss Havisham	223	" Times soon forgotten ! "
142335	142341	142343	142343	Estella	195	" No , not forgotten , "
142346	142386	142387	142387	she	195	" not forgotten , but treasured up in my memory . When have you found me false to your teaching ? When have you found me unmindful of your lessons ? When have you found me giving admission here , "
142395	142407	142387	142387	she	195	" to anything that you excluded ? Be just to me . "
142408	142415	142417	142418	Miss Havisham	223	" So proud , so proud ! "
142430	142438	142440	142440	Estella	195	" Who taught me to be proud ? "
142442	142452	142440	142440	Estella	195	" Who praised me when I learnt my lesson ? "
142453	142460	142462	142463	Miss Havisham	223	" So hard , so hard ! "
142470	142478	142480	142480	Estella	195	" Who taught me to be hard ? "
142482	142492	142480	142480	Estella	195	" Who praised me when I learnt my lesson ? "
142493	142503	142504	142505	Miss Havisham	223	" But to be proud and hard to me ! "
142516	142531	142510	142510	she	223	" Estella , Estella , Estella , to be proud and hard to me ! "
142566	142572	142574	142574	Estella	195	" I can not think , "
142582	142633	142577	142577	her	195	" why you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation . I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes . I have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling . I have never shown any weakness that I can charge myself with . "
142634	142644	142646	142647	Miss Havisham	223	" Would it be weakness to return my love ? "
142649	142661	142646	142647	Miss Havisham	223	" But yes , yes , she would call it so ! "
142662	142668	142670	142670	Estella	195	" I begin to think , "
142684	142770	142670	142670	Estella	195	" that I almost understand how this comes about . If you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms , and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she had never once seen your face , - if you had done that , and then , for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it , you would have been disappointed and angry ? "
142799	142802	142804	142804	Estella	195	" Or , "
142807	142913	142804	142804	Estella	195	" which is a nearer case , - if you had taught her , from the dawn of her intelligence , with your utmost energy and might , that there was such a thing as daylight , but that it was made to be her enemy and destroyer , and she must always turn against it , for it had blighted you and would else blight her ; - if you had done this , and then , for a purpose , had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she could not do it , you would have been disappointed and angry ? "
142937	142940	142942	142942	Estella	195	" So , "
142944	142974	142942	142942	Estella	195	" I must be taken as I have been made . The success is not mine , the failure is not mine , but the two together make me . "

143962	143967	143960	143960	Drummle	275	" O , Lord ! "
144224	144233	144213	144213	his	241	" having been betrayed into a warmth which . "

144786	144791	144758	144758	her	195	" You should be . "
144792	144818	144758	144758	her	195	" Say rather , I should not be ; for I have my letter to Satis House to write , before I go to sleep . "

144902	144927	144896	144896	her	195	" What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder , - to use your words , - that I need look at ? "
144928	144942	144944	144944	I.	0	" Indeed , that is the very question I want to ask you , "
144945	144956	144944	144944	I.	0	" For he has been hovering about you all night . "
144957	144967	144969	144969	Estella	195	" Moths , and all sorts of ugly creatures , "
144977	144990	144969	144969	Estella	195	" hover about a lighted candle . Can the candle help it ? "

145031	145063	144995	144995	I	0	" But , Estella , do hear me speak . It makes me wretched that you should encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle . You know he is despised . "
145064	145067	145069	145069	she	195	" Well ? "
145071	145094	145069	145069	she	195	" You know he is as ungainly within as without . A deficient , ill - tempered , lowering , stupid fellow . "

148346	148359	148360	148360	I	0	" Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me , "

148455	148550	148443	148443	You	3062	" I took out my purse . He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it , and he watched me as I separated two one - pound notes from its contents . They were clean and new , and I spread them out and handed them over to him . Still watching me , he laid them one upon the other , folded them long - wise , gave them a twist , set fire to them at the lamp , and dropped the ashes into the tray . "
148557	148581	148552	148552	I	0	" he said then , with a smile that was like a frown , and with a frown that was like a smile , "

148611	148733	148594	148594	me	0	" He emptied his glass , got up , and stood at the side of the fire , with his heavy brown hand on the mantel - shelf . He put a foot up to the bars , to dry and warm it , and the wet boot began to steam ; but , he neither looked at it , nor at the fire , but steadily looked at me . It was only now that I began to tremble . When my lips had parted , and had shaped some words that were without sound , I forced myself to tell him though I could not do it distinctly , that I had been chosen to succeed to some property . "
148742	148749	148750	148750	I	0	" said he . I faltered , "
148755	148756	148750	148750	I	0	" "
148765	148773	148774	148774	I	0	" said he . I faltered again , "

148790	148795	148782	148782	I	0	" said the Convict , "
148814	148850	148807	148809	the first figure	3068	" With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action , I rose out of my chair , and stood with my hand upon the back of it , looking wildly at him . "
148855	148860	148807	148809	the first figure	3068	" he went on . "
148902	148950	148900	148900	J	346	" All the truth of my position came flashing on me ; and its disappointments , dangers , disgraces , consequences of all kinds , rushed in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath I drew . "
148954	148958	148900	148900	J	346	" he resumed , "
149055	149169	149053	149053	Wemmick	254	" I could not have spoken one word , though it had been to save my life . I stood , with a hand on the chair - back and a hand on my breast , where I seemed to be suffocating , - I stood so , looking wildly at him , until I grasped at the chair , when the room began to surge and turn . He caught me , drew me to the sofa , put me up against the cushions , and bent on one knee before me , bringing the face that I now well remembered , and that I shuddered at , very near to mine . "
149315	149354	149309	149309	Pip	241	" The abhorrence in which I held the man , the dread I had of him , the repugnance with which I shrank from him , could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast . "
149587	149626	149574	149574	You	3079	" In his heat and triumph , and in his knowledge that I had been nearly fainting , he did not remark on my reception of all this . It was the one grain of relief I had . "
149630	149667	149574	149574	You	3079	" he went on , taking my watch out of my pocket , and turning towards him a ring on my finger , while I recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake , "
149728	149736	149724	149724	your	3104	" turning his eyes round the room , "
149810	149832	149799	149799	I	0	" Again he took both my hands and put them to his lips , while my blood ran cold within me . "
149841	149886	149887	149887	you	3104	" said he , after again drawing his sleeve over his eyes and forehead , as the click came in his throat which I well remembered , - and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much in earnest ; "
149931	149932	149923	149923	you	3104	" "
149940	149944	149923	149923	you	3104	" I returned , "

149985	149989	149981	149983	no one else	4591	" I asked . "
149992	150002	149981	149983	no one else	4591	" said he , with a glance of surprise : "

150247	150275	150236	150236	he	237	" O that he had never come ! That he had left me at the forge , - far from contented , yet , by comparison happy ! "
150474	150502	150450	150450	I	0	" He laid his hand on my shoulder . I shuddered at the thought that for anything I knew , his hand might be stained with blood . "
150564	150619	150560	150560	I	0	" I tried to collect my thoughts , but I was stunned . Throughout , I had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him ; even now , I could not separate his voice from those voices , though those were loud and his was silent . "
150626	150632	150622	150622	you	0	" he asked , presently . "
150642	150643	150622	150622	you	0	" "
150647	150650	150622	150622	you	0	" said I. "
150660	150664	150622	150622	you	0	" he answered ; "

150688	150697	150683	150683	My	0	" said I , rising from the sofa , "

150721	150722	150709	150709	He	3137	" "
150725	150740	150709	150709	He	3137	" said I , answering almost mechanically , in spite of my utmost efforts ; "
150746	150747	150709	150709	He	3137	" "
150756	150777	150709	150709	He	3137	" he said , dropping his voice , and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner , "
150782	150783	150786	150786	you	0	" "
150791	150792	150786	150786	you	0	" "

150844	151088	150834	150834	I	0	" Nothing was needed but this ; the wretched man , after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years , had risked his life to come to me , and I held it there in my keeping ! If I had loved him instead of abhorring him ; if I had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection , instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance ; it could have been no worse . On the contrary , it would have been better , for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart . My first care was to close the shutters , so that no light might be seen from without , and then to close and make fast the doors . While I did so , he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit ; and when I saw him thus engaged , I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again . It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently , to file at his leg . When I had gone into Herbert 's room , and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held , I asked him if he would go to bed ? He said yes , but asked me for some of my "
151092	152386	150834	150834	I	0	" to put on in the morning . I brought it out , and laid it ready for him , and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good night . I got away from him , without knowing how I did it , and mended the fire in the room where we had been together , and sat down by it , afraid to go to bed . For an hour or more , I remained too stunned to think ; and it was not until I began to think , that I began fully to know how wrecked I was , and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces . Miss Havisham 's intentions towards me , all a mere dream ; Estella not designed for me ; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience , a sting for the greedy relations , a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand ; those were the first smarts I had . But , sharpest and deepest pain of all , - it was for the convict , guilty of I knew not what crimes , and liable to be taken out of those rooms where I sat thinking , and hanged at the Old Bailey door , that I had deserted Joe . I would not have gone back to Joe now , I would not have gone back to Biddy now , for any consideration ; simply , I suppose , because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration . No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity ; but I could never , never , undo what I had done . In every rage of wind and rush of rain , I heard pursuers . Twice , I could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door . With these fears upon me , I began either to imagine or recall that I had had mysterious warnings of this man 's approach . That , for weeks gone by , I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his . That these likenesses had grown more numerous , as he , coming over the sea , had drawn nearer . That his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine , and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word , and with me . Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man ; that I had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him ; that I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast . Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a half - formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him in the dead of the wild solitary night . This dilated until it filled the room , and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden . He had rolled a handkerchief round his head , and his face was set and lowering in his sleep . But he was asleep , and quietly too , though he had a pistol lying on the pillow . Assured of this , I softly removed the key to the outside of his door , and turned it on him before I again sat down by the fire . Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor . When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness , the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five , the candles were wasted out , the fire was dead , and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness . THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP 'S EXPECTATIONS . Chapter XL It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure so far as I could the safety of my dreaded visitor ; for , this thought pressing on me when I awoke , held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance . The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self - evident . It could not be done , and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion . True , I had no Avenger in my service now , but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female , assisted by an animated rag - bag whom she called her niece , and to keep a room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration . They both had weak eyes , which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes , and they were always at hand when not wanted ; indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny . Not to get up a mystery with these people , I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country . This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light . Not stumbling on the means after all , I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern . Now , in groping my way down the black staircase I fell over something , and that something was a man crouching in a corner . As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there , but eluded my touch in silence , I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly ; telling him of the incident on the way back . The wind being as fierce as ever , we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase , but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there . It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms ; so , lighting my candle at the watchman 's , and leaving him standing at the door , I examined them carefully , including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep . All was quiet , and assuredly no other man was in those chambers . It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs , on that night of all nights in the year , and I asked the watchman , on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at the door , whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out ? Yes , he said ; at different times of the night , three . One lived in Fountain Court , and the other two lived in the Lane , and he had seen them all go home . Again , the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks , and he certainly had not returned in the night , because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came up - stairs . "
152395	152408	152393	152393	sir	4451	" said the watchman , as he gave me back my glass , "
152446	152447	152440	152441	a stranger	1158	" "
152451	152455	152440	152441	a stranger	1158	" I muttered . "
152458	152459	152440	152441	a stranger	1158	" "
152466	152467	152460	152460	You	0	" "

152487	152491	152485	152485	him	1497	" I repeated . "
152501	152506	152492	152492	I	0	" returned the watchman . "
152532	152533	152527	152527	he	5329	" "
152539	153131	153132	153132	I	0	" The watchman had not particularly noticed ; he should say a working person ; to the best of his belief , he had a dust - colored kind of clothes on , under a dark coat . The watchman made more light of the matter than I did , and naturally ; not having my reason for attaching weight to it . When I had got rid of him , which I thought it well to do without prolonging explanations , my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together . Whereas they were easy of innocent solution apart , - as , for instance , some diner out or diner at home , who had not gone near this watchman 's gate , might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep there , - and my nameless visitor might have brought some one with him to show him the way , - still , joined , they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me . I lighted my fire , which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning , and fell into a doze before it . I seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six . As there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight , I dozed again ; now , waking up uneasily , with prolix conversations about nothing , in my ears ; now , making thunder of the wind in the chimney ; at length , falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start . All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation , nor could I do so yet . I had not the power to attend to it . I was greatly dejected and distressed , but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way . As to forming any plan for the future , I could as soon have formed an elephant . When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning , all of a leaden hue ; when I walked from room to room ; when I sat down again shivering , before the fire , waiting for my laundress to appear ; I thought how miserable I was , but hardly knew why , or how long I had been so , or on what day of the week I made the reflection , or even who I was that made it . At last , the old woman and the niece came in , - the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom , - and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire . To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep , and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly . Then I washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust ; and so , in a sort of dream or sleep - waking , I found myself sitting by the fire again , waiting for - Him - to come to breakfast . By and by , his door opened and he came out . I could not bring myself to bear the sight of him , and I thought he had a worse look by daylight . "

153264	153273	153262	153262	Magwitch	349	" he answered , in the same tone ; "

153295	153312	153289	153290	A warmint	3158	" He answered quite seriously , and used the word as if it denoted some profession . "
153322	153344	153314	153314	you	3151	" said I , pausing to wonder whether that could really have been last night , which seemed so long ago . "

153446	153466	153435	153435	you	3151	" said he , giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that made me turn hot and sick . "
153475	153476	153468	153468	you	3151	" "
153492	153493	153495	153495	you	3151	" "

153507	153516	153495	153495	you	3151	" said he , with a sharp look . "
153521	153525	153495	153495	you	3151	" He nodded . "
153538	153570	153533	153533	Jaggers	237	" It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for , but he took up a knife , gave it a flourish , and with the words , "
153582	153703	153704	153704	I	0	" fell to at his breakfast . He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable , and all his actions were uncouth , noisy , and greedy . Some of his teeth had failed him since I saw him eat on the marshes , and as he turned his food in his mouth , and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon it , he looked terribly like a hungry old dog . If I had begun with any appetite , he would have taken it away , and I should have sat much as I did , - repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion , and gloomily looking at the cloth . "
153713	153732	153704	153704	I	0	" he said , as a polite kind of apology when he made an end of his meal , "
153807	153930	153799	153799	I	0	" As he said so , he got up from table , and putting his hand into the breast of the pea - coat he wore , brought out a short black pipe , and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro - head . Having filled his pipe , he put the surplus tobacco back again , as if his pocket were a drawer . Then , he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs , and lighted his pipe at it , and then turned round on the hearth - rug with his back to the fire , and went through his favorite action of holding out both his hands for mine . "
153934	153955	153799	153799	I	0	" said he , dandling my hands up and down in his , as he puffed at his pipe , - "
153999	154067	154068	154068	I	0	" I released my hands as soon as I could , and found that I was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition . What I was chained to , and how heavily , became intelligible to me , as I heard his hoarse voice , and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron gray hair at the sides . "
154167	154192	154161	154161	Pip	241	" He took out of his pocket a great thick pocket - book , bursting with papers , and tossed it on the table . "
154280	154299	154301	154301	you	3079	" he wound up , looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with a loud snap , "
154336	154337	154324	154326	a better gentleman	3124	" "
154340	154353	154324	154326	a better gentleman	3124	" said I , almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike , "
154398	154399	154403	154403	Pip	241	" "
154405	154423	154403	154403	Pip	241	" said he , laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner ; "

154475	154482	154462	154462	I	0	" I resumed , half groaning , "

154502	154513	154456	154456	Pip	241	" he said , in the same tone as before , "
154569	154588	154589	154589	I	0	" Some sense of the grimly - ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh , as I replied , "

154614	154618	154619	154620	Dear boy	3079	" he persisted . "

154734	154738	154643	154643	You	3201	" he returned , "

154895	154899	154892	154893	Dear boy	3079	" he returned , "

154976	154980	154970	154970	You	3079	" said I , "

155006	155018	155020	155020	Death	353	" said he , putting his pipe back in his mouth , "
155181	155332	155172	155172	me	0	" Once more , he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship : smoking with great complacency all the while . It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet lodging hard by , of which he might take possession when Herbert returned : whom I expected in two or three days . That the secret must be confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity , even if I could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with him out of the question , was plain to me . But it was by no means so plain to Mr. Provis I resolved to call him by that name , who reserved his consent to Herbert 's participation until he should have seen him and formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy .

155340	155356	155172	155172	me	0	" said he , pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of his pocket , "
155365	155559	155362	155362	his	3214	" To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency , would be to state what I never quite established ; but this I can say , that I never knew him put it to any other use . The book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice , and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents , combined with his own experience in that wise , gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm . On this first occasion of his producing it , I recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago , and how he had described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude . As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit , in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of , I next discussed with him what dress he should wear . He cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of ' shorts "

155859	155863	155857	155857	he	237	" be careful . "
155864	155870	155871	155871	I	0	" I will , sir , "
155890	155896	155898	155899	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Do n't commit yourself , "
155901	155934	155898	155899	Mr. Jaggers	237	" and do n't commit any one . You understand - any one . Do n't tell me anything : I do n't want to know anything ; I am not curious . "
155947	155955	155957	155957	I	0	" I merely want , Mr. Jaggers , "
155959	155989	155957	155957	I	0	" to assure myself that what I have been told is true . I have no hope of its being untrue , but at least I may verify it . "
155994	156007	156008	156008	he	237	" But did you say ' told ' or ' informed ' ? "
156035	156061	156008	156008	he	237	" Told would seem to imply verbal communication . You ca n't have verbal communication with a man in New South Wales , you know . "
156062	156072	156008	156008	he	237	" I will say , informed , Mr. Jaggers . "
156073	156076	156008	156008	he	237	" Good . "
156077	156100	156008	156008	he	237	" I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch , that he is the benefactor so long unknown to me . "
156101	156107	156109	156110	Mr. Jaggers	237	" That is the man , "

156127	156132	156134	156135	Mr. Jaggers	237	" And only he , "
156137	156169	156134	156135	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I am not so unreasonable , sir , as to think you at all responsible for my mistakes and wrong conclusions ; but I always supposed it was Miss Havisham . "
156170	156177	156179	156180	Mr. Jaggers	237	" As you say , Pip , "
156197	156207	156194	156194	his	237	" I am not at all responsible for that . "
156208	156219	156220	156220	I	0	" And yet it looked so like it , sir , "
156227	156236	156238	156239	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Not a particle of evidence , Pip , "
156250	156268	156242	156242	his	237	" Take nothing on its looks ; take everything on evidence . There 's no better rule . "

156293	156306	156242	156242	his	237	" I have verified my information , and there 's an end . "
156307	156322	156324	156325	Mr. Jaggers	237	" And Magwitch - in New South Wales - having at last disclosed himself , "
156327	156374	156324	156325	Mr. Jaggers	237	" you will comprehend , Pip , how rigidly throughout my communication with you , I have always adhered to the strict line of fact . There has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact . You are quite aware of that ? "
156375	156380	156242	156242	his	237	" Quite , sir . "
156381	156522	156524	156525	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I communicated to Magwitch - in New South Wales - when he first wrote to me - from New South Wales - the caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact . I also communicated to him another caution . He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here . I cautioned him that I must hear no more of that ; that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon ; that he was expatriated for the term of his natural life ; and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony , rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law . I gave Magwitch that caution , "
156532	156550	156524	156525	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I wrote it to New South Wales . He guided himself by it , no doubt . "
156551	156555	156557	156557	I.	0	" No doubt , "
156558	156566	156568	156569	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I have been informed by Wemmick , "
156577	156600	156568	156569	Mr. Jaggers	237	" that he has received a letter , under date Portsmouth , from a colonist of the name of Purvis , or - "
156601	156605	156606	156606	I	0	" Or Provis , "
156609	156630	156606	156606	I	0	" Or Provis - thank you , Pip . Perhaps it is Provis ? Perhaps you know it 's Provis ? "
156631	156634	156636	156636	I.	0	" Yes , "
156637	156706	156636	156636	I.	0	" You know it 's Provis . A letter , under date Portsmouth , from a colonist of the name of Provis , asking for the particulars of your address , on behalf of Magwitch . Wemmick sent him the particulars , I understand , by return of post . Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of Magwitch - in New South Wales ? "
156707	156713	156714	156714	I	0	" It came through Provis , "
156717	156723	156725	156726	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Good day , Pip , "
156732	156797	156729	156729	his	237	" glad to have seen you . In writing by post to Magwitch - in New South Wales - or in communicating with him through Provis , have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you , together with the balance ; for there is still a balance remaining . Good day , Pip ! "
156858	156867	156868	156868	Wemmick	254	" O , what a man he is ! "
157706	157713	157696	157696	he	237	" Foreign language , dear boy ! "

158187	158219	158183	158183	he	265	" I said to Herbert . So , Herbert , looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement , complied , and Provis immediately shaking hands with him , said , "
158247	158354	158368	158368	he	3079	" Chapter XLI In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of Herbert , when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire , and I recounted the whole of the secret . Enough , that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herbert 's face , and not least among them , my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me . What would alone have set a division between that man and us , if there had been no other dividing circumstance , was his triumph in my story . Saving his troublesome sense of having been "
158472	158482	158483	158483	he	3079	" Though , look'ee here , Pip 's comrade , "
158495	158626	158627	158627	Herbert	265	" I know very well that once since I come back - for half a minute - I 've been low . I said to Pip , I knowed as I had been low . But do n't you fret yourself on that score . I ai n't made Pip a gentleman , and Pip ai n't a going to make you a gentleman , not fur me not to know what 's due to ye both . Dear boy , and Pip 's comrade , you two may count upon me always having a gen - teel muzzle on . Muzzled I have been since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness , muzzled I am at the present time , muzzled I ever will be . "
158630	158633	158627	158627	Herbert	265	" Certainly , "
159108	159111	159113	159113	I	0	" What , "
159126	159133	159113	159113	I	0	" what is to be done ? "
159134	159140	159141	159141	he	265	" My poor dear Handel , "
159148	159156	159141	159141	he	265	" I am too stunned to think . "
159157	159204	159113	159113	I	0	" So was I , Herbert , when the blow first fell . Still , something must be done . He is intent upon various new expenses , - horses , and carriages , and lavish appearances of all kinds . He must be stopped somehow . "
159205	159214	159113	159113	I	0	" You mean that you ca n't accept - "
159215	159220	159221	159221	I	0	" How can I ? "
159228	159237	159225	159225	Herbert	265	" Think of him ! Look at him ! "
159247	159278	159225	159225	Herbert	265	" Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is , Herbert , that he is attached to me , strongly attached to me . Was there ever such a fate ! "
159279	159285	159286	159286	Herbert	265	" My poor dear Handel , "

159296	159356	159294	159294	I	0	" after all , stopping short here , never taking another penny from him , think what I owe him already ! Then again : I am heavily in debt , - very heavily for me , who have now no expectations , - and I have been bred to no calling , and I am fit for nothing . "
159357	159364	159365	159365	Herbert	265	" Well , well , well ! "
159368	159376	159365	159365	Herbert	265	" Do n't say fit for nothing . "
159377	159428	159431	159431	I	0	" What am I fit for ? I know only one thing that I am fit for , and that is , to go for a soldier . And I might have gone , my dear Herbert , but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection . "
159456	159463	159465	159465	he	265	" Anyhow , my dear Handel , "
159549	159560	159538	159538	I	0	" Poor fellow ! He little suspected with whose money . "

I said to Herbert , meanwhile , that even if Provis were recognized and taken , in spite of himself , I should be wretched as the cause , however innocently . Yes ; even though I was so wretched in having him at large and near me , and even though I would far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would ever have come to this ! But there was no staving off the question , What was to be done ? "

160189	160214	160215	160215	Handel	266	" Herbert got up , and linked his arm in mine , and we slowly walked to and fro together , studying the carpet . "

I had the wildest dreams concerning him , and woke unrefreshed ; I woke , too , to recover the fear which I had lost in the night , of his being found out as a returned transport . Waking , I never lost that fear . He came round at the appointed time , took out his jackknife , and sat down to his meal . He was full of plans "

He put it back again , stuck his pipe in a button - hole of his coat , spread a hand on each knee , and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments , looked round at us and said what follows . Chapter XLII "
161031	161157	161026	161026	Pip	241	" I 've been done everything to , pretty well - except hanged . I 've been locked up as much as a silver tea - kittle . I 've been carted here and carted there , and put out of this town , and put out of that town , and stuck in the stocks , and whipped and worried and drove . I 've no more notion where I was born than you have - if so much . I first become aware of myself down in Essex , a thieving turnips for my living . Summun had run away from me - a man - a tinker - and he 'd took the fire with him , and left me wery cold . "
161219	161286	161216	161216	mine	0	" So fur as I could find , there warn't a soul that see young Abel Magwitch , with us little on him as in him , but wot caught fright at him , and either drove him off , or took him up . I was took up , took up , took up , to that extent that I reg'larly grow'd up took up . "
161339	161347	161348	161348	they	3303	" This is a terrible hardened one , "
161358	161370	161348	161348	they	3303	" May be said to live in jails , this boy . "
161490	161654	161482	161482	you	3079	" Tramping , begging , thieving , working sometimes when I could , - though that warn't as often as you may think , till you put the question whether you would ha ' been over - ready to give me work yourselves , - a bit of a poacher , a bit of a laborer , a bit of a wagoner , a bit of a haymaker , a bit of a hawker , a bit of most things that do n't pay and lead to trouble , I got to be a man . A deserting soldier in a Traveller 's Rest , what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs , learnt me to read ; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write . I warn't locked up as often now as formerly , but I wore out my good share of key - metal still . "
161740	161870	161873	161873	he	364	" He set up fur a gentleman , this Compeyson , and he 'd been to a public boarding - school and had learning . He was a smooth one to talk , and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks . He was good - looking too . It was the night afore the great race , when I found him on the heath , in a booth that I know'd on . Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when I went in , and the landlord which had a knowledge of me , and was a sporting one called him out , and said , ' I think this is a man that might suit you , ' - meaning I was . "
161908	161927	161886	161886	He	364	" ' To judge from appearances , you 're out of luck , ' says Compeyson to me . "
161971	161989	161990	161990	I	0	" ' Luck changes , ' says Compeyson ; ' perhaps yours is going to change . ' "
162006	162017	162024	162024	I	0	" ' What can you do ? ' says Compeyson . "
162036	162062	162024	162024	I	0	" Compeyson laughed , looked at me again very noticing , giv me five shillings , and appointed me for next night . Same place . "
162184	162315	162174	162174	he	364	" There was another in with Compeyson , as was called Arthur , - not as being so chrisen'd , but as a surname . He was in a Decline , and was a shadow to look at . Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore , and they 'd made a pot of money by it ; but Compeyson betted and gamed , and he 'd have run through the king 's taxes . So , Arthur was a dying , and a dying poor and with the horrors on him , and Compeyson 's wife which Compeyson kicked mostly was a having pity on him when she could , and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody . "
162536	162583	162521	162521	she	6959	" Says Compeyson : ' Why , you fool , do n't you know she 's got a living body ? And how should she be up there , without coming through the door , or in at the window , and up the stairs ? ' "
162642	162690	162691	162691	Compeyson	364	" Compeyson spoke hardy , but he was always a coward . ' Go up alonger this drivelling sick man , ' he says to his wife , ' and Magwitch , lend her a hand , will you ? ' But he never come nigh himself . "
162812	162931	162932	162932	He	3332	" Compeyson 's wife , being used to him , giv him some liquor to get the horrors off , and by and by he quieted . ' O , she 's gone ! Has her keeper been for her ? ' he says . ' Yes , ' says Compeyson 's wife . ' Did you tell him to lock her and bar her in ? ' ' Yes . ' ' And to take that ugly thing away from her ? ' ' Yes , yes , all right . ' ' You 're a good creetur , ' he says , ' do n't leave me , whatever you do , and thank you ! ' "
163065	163115	163055	163055	he	3332	" Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides . Him and me was soon busy , and first he swore me being ever artful on my own book , - this here little black book , dear boy , what I swore your comrade on . "
163241	163293	163234	163234	I	0	" He looked about him in a confused way , as if he had lost his place in the book of his remembrance ; and he turned his face to the fire , and spread his hands broader on his knees , and lifted them off and put them on again . "
163304	163313	163234	163234	I	0	" he said , looking round once more . "
163355	163361	163338	163338	I	0	" I answered , No . "
163364	163368	163369	163369	I	0	" he said , "
163482	164072	164073	164073	He	3342	" When we was put in the dock , I noticed first of all what a gentleman Compeyson looked , wi ' his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pocket - handkercher , and what a common sort of a wretch I looked . When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short , aforehand , I noticed how heavy it all bore on me , and how light on him . When the evidence was giv in the box , I noticed how it was always me that had come for'ard , and could be swore to , how it was always me that the money had been paid to , how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit . But when the defence come on , then I see the plan plainer ; for , says the counsellor for Compeyson , ' My lord and gentlemen , here you has afore you , side by side , two persons as your eyes can separate wide ; one , the younger , well brought up , who will be spoke to as such ; one , the elder , ill brought up , who will be spoke to as such ; one , the younger , seldom if ever seen in these here transactions , and only suspected ; t'other , the elder , always seen in 'em and always wi'his guilt brought home . Can you doubt , if there is but one in it , which is the one , and , if there is two in it , which is much the worst one ? ' And such - like . And when it come to character , warn't it Compeyson as had been to the school , and warn't it his schoolfellows as was in this position and in that , and warn't it him as had been know'd by witnesses in such clubs and societies , and nowt to his disadvantage ? And warn't it me as had been tried afore , and as had been know'd up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock - Ups ! And when it come to speech - making , warn't it Compeyson as could speak to 'em wi ' his face dropping every now and then into his white pocket - handkercher , - ah ! and wi ' verses in his speech , too , - and warn't it me as could only say , ' Gentlemen , this man at my side is a most precious rascal ' ? And when the verdict come , warn't it Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company , and giving up all the information he could agen me , and warn't it me as got never a word but Guilty ? And when I says to Compeyson , ' Once out of this court , I 'll smash that face of yourn ! ' ai n't it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected , and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us ? And when we 're sentenced , ai n't it him as gets seven year , and me fourteen , and ai n't it him as the Judge is sorry for , because he might a done so well , and ai n't it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion , likely to come to worse ? "
164114	164127	164128	164128	He	3342	" I ai n't a going to be low , dear boy ! "
164156	164294	164295	164295	He	3343	" I had said to Compeyson that I 'd smash that face of his , and I swore Lord smash mine ! to do it . We was in the same prison - ship , but I could n't get at him for long , though I tried . At last I come behind him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at him , when I was seen and seized . The black - hole of that ship warn't a strong one , to a judge of black - holes that could swim and dive . I escaped to the shore , and I was a hiding among the graves there , envying them as was in 'em and all over , when I first see my boy ! "
164321	164438	164441	164441	he	3344	" By my boy , I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes too . Upon my soul , I half believe he escaped in his terror , to get quit of me , not knowing it was me as had got ashore . I hunted him down . I smashed his face . ' And now , ' says I ' as the worst thing I can do , caring nothing for myself , I 'll drag you back . ' And I 'd have swum off , towing him by the hair , if it had come to that , and I 'd a got him aboard without the soldiers . "
164514	164515	164516	164516	He	3344	" "
164559	164564	164565	164565	I	0	" Is he dead ? "
164572	164580	164565	164565	I	0	" Is who dead , dear boy ? "
164581	164584	164631	164631	He	265	" Compeyson . "
164585	164601	164631	164631	He	265	" He hopes I am , if he 's alive , you may be sure , "
164607	164616	164617	164617	Herbert	265	" I never heerd no more of him . "
164658	164679	164652	164652	I	0	" Young Havisham 's name was Arthur . Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham 's lover . "
165718	165724	165726	165727	Mr. Drummle	275	" Is this a cut ? "
165729	165732	165734	165734	I	0	" Oh ! "
165740	165766	165734	165734	I	0	" it 's you , is it ? How do you do ? I was wondering who it was , who kept the fire off . "
165798	165805	165807	165808	Mr. Drummle	275	" You have just come down ? "
165819	165822	165824	165824	I	0	" Yes , "
165835	165839	165841	165841	Drummle	275	" Beastly place , "
165843	165853	165841	165841	Drummle	275	" Your part of the country , I think ? "
165854	165857	165858	165858	I	0	" Yes , "
165861	165872	165858	165858	I	0	" I am told it 's very like your Shropshire . "
165873	165881	165883	165883	Drummle	275	" Not in the least like it , "
165913	165920	165908	165908	I	0	" Have you been here long ? "
165934	165943	165945	165945	Drummle	275	" Long enough to be tired of it , "
165955	165962	165945	165945	Drummle	275	" Do you stay here long ? "
165963	165968	165970	165971	Mr. Drummle	275	" Ca n't say , "
165973	165977	165970	165971	Mr. Drummle	275	" Do you ? "
165978	165983	165985	165985	I.	0	" Ca n't say , "
166053	166064	166066	166066	Drummle	275	" Large tract of marshes about here , I believe ? "
166068	166075	166077	166077	I.	0	" Yes . What of that ? "
166094	166097	166078	166079	Mr. Drummle	275	" Oh ! "
166101	166109	166078	166079	Mr. Drummle	275	" Are you amused , Mr. Drummle ? "
166110	166113	166115	166115	he	275	" No , "
166117	166169	166115	166115	he	275	" not particularly . I am going out for a ride in the saddle . I mean to explore those marshes for amusement . Out - of - the - way villages there , they tell me . Curious little public - houses - and smithies - and that . Waiter ! "
166170	166175	166078	166079	Mr. Drummle	275	" Yes , sir . "
166176	166184	166078	166079	Mr. Drummle	275	" Is that horse of mine ready ? "
166185	166194	166115	166115	he	275	" Brought round to the door , sir . "
166195	166220	166078	166079	Mr. Drummle	275	" I say . Look here , you sir . The lady wo n't ride to - day ; the weather wo n't do . "
166221	166227	166078	166079	Mr. Drummle	275	" Very good , sir . "
166228	166246	166115	166115	he	275	" And I do n't dine , because I 'm going to dine at the lady 's . "
166247	166253	166078	166079	Mr. Drummle	275	" Very good , sir . "
166418	166427	166429	166429	Drummle	275	" Have you been to the Grove since ? "
166431	166434	166436	166436	I	0	" No , "
166438	166453	166436	166436	I	0	" I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was there . "
166454	166465	166490	166490	Drummle	275	" Was that when we had a difference of opinion ? "
166466	166469	166470	166470	I	0	" Yes , "
166476	166488	166490	166490	Drummle	275	" Come , come ! They let you off easily enough , "
166492	166501	166490	166490	Drummle	275	" You should n't have lost your temper . "
166502	166506	166508	166508	I	0	" Mr. Drummle , "
166510	166544	166508	166508	I	0	" you are not competent to give advice on that subject . When I lose my temper not that I admit having done so on that occasion , I do n't throw glasses . "
166545	166549	166551	166551	Drummle	275	" I do , "
166573	166594	166569	166569	I	0	" Mr. Drummle , I did not seek this conversation , and I do n't think it an agreeable one . "
166595	166603	166605	166605	he	275	" I am sure it 's not , "
166612	166621	166605	166605	he	275	" I do n't think anything about it . "
166622	166626	166627	166627	I	0	" And therefore , "
166631	166649	166627	166627	I	0	" with your leave , I will suggest that we hold no kind of communication in future . "
166650	166655	166657	166657	Drummle	275	" Quite my opinion , "
166659	166692	166657	166657	Drummle	275	" and what I should have suggested myself , or done - more likely - without suggesting . But do n't lose your temper . Have n't you lost enough without that ? "
166693	166701	166627	166627	I	0	" What do you mean , sir ? "
166702	166705	166707	166707	Drummle	275	" Waiter ! "
166719	166750	166715	166716	The waiter	5696	" Look here , you sir . You quite understand that the young lady do n't ride to - day , and that I dine at the young lady 's ? "
166751	166757	166787	166787	Drummle	275	" Quite so , sir ! "
167239	167244	167246	167247	Miss Havisham	223	" And what wind , "
167249	167256	167246	167247	Miss Havisham	223	" blows you here , Pip ? "
167326	167330	167332	167332	I	0	" Miss Havisham , "
167334	167359	167332	167332	I	0	" I went to Richmond yesterday , to speak to Estella ; and finding that some wind had blown her here , I followed . "
167415	167466	167467	167468	Miss Havisham	223	" What I had to say to Estella , Miss Havisham , I will say before you , presently - in a few moments . It will not surprise you , it will not displease you . I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be . "
167504	167560	167498	167498	she	223	" I have found out who my patron is . It is not a fortunate discovery , and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation , station , fortune , anything . There are reasons why I must say no more of that . It is not my secret , but another 's . "
167583	167596	167579	167580	Miss Havisham	223	" It is not your secret , but another 's . Well ? "
167597	167667	167680	167680	her	223	" When you first caused me to be brought here , Miss Havisham , when I belonged to the village over yonder , that I wish I had never left , I suppose I did really come here , as any other chance boy might have come , - as a kind of servant , to gratify a want or a whim , and to be paid for it ? "
167668	167673	167675	167676	Miss Havisham	223	" Ay , Pip , "
167683	167687	167680	167680	her	223	" you did . "
167688	167694	167680	167680	her	223	" And that Mr. Jaggers - "
167695	167699	167701	167702	Miss Havisham	223	" Mr. Jaggers , "
167712	167778	167701	167702	Miss Havisham	223	" had nothing to do with it , and knew nothing of it . His being my lawyer , and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence . He holds the same relation towards numbers of people , and it might easily arise . Be that as it may , it did arise , and was not brought about by any one . "
167798	167820	167822	167822	I.	0	" But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in , at least you led me on ? "
167823	167826	167827	167827	she	223	" Yes , "
167834	167841	167827	167827	she	223	" I let you go on . "
167842	167847	167855	167856	Miss Havisham	223	" Was that kind ? "
167848	167853	167855	167856	Miss Havisham	223	" Who am I , "
167880	167896	167871	167871	Estella	195	" who am I , for God 's sake , that I should be kind ? "
167928	167935	167936	167936	she	223	" Well , well , well ! "
167939	167943	167936	167936	she	223	" What else ? "
167944	167955	167956	167956	I	0	" I was liberally paid for my old attendance here , "
167963	168024	167956	167956	I	0	" in being apprenticed , and I have asked these questions only for my own information . What follows has another and I hope more disinterested purpose . In humoring my mistake , Miss Havisham , you punished - practised on - perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention , without offence - your self - seeking relations ? "
168025	168077	167936	167936	she	223	" I did . Why , they would have it so ! So would you . What has been my history , that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so ! You made your own snares . I never made them . "
168107	168220	168103	168103	I	0	" I have been thrown among one family of your relations , Miss Havisham , and have been constantly among them since I went to London . I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself . And I should be false and base if I did not tell you , whether it is acceptable to you or no , and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no , that you deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert , if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous , upright , open , and incapable of anything designing or mean . "
168221	168227	168229	168230	Miss Havisham	223	" They are your friends , "
168232	168239	168241	168241	I	0	" They made themselves my friends , "
168243	168272	168241	168241	I	0	" when they supposed me to have superseded them ; and when Sarah Pocket , Miss Georgiana , and Mistress Camilla were not my friends , I think . "
168311	168319	168295	168295	She	223	" What do you want for them ? "
168320	168323	168325	168325	I	0	" Only , "
168327	168359	168325	168325	I	0	" that you would not confound them with the others . They may be of the same blood , but , believe me , they are not of the same nature . "
168371	168379	168366	168367	Miss Havisham	223	" What do you want for them ? "
168380	168390	168391	168391	I	0	" I am not so cunning , you see , "
168404	168465	168391	168391	I	0	" as that I could hide from you , even if I desired , that I do want something . Miss Havisham , if you would spare the money to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life , but which from the nature of the case must be done without his knowledge , I could show you how . "
168466	168476	168477	168477	she	223	" Why must it be done without his knowledge ? "
168496	168499	168501	168501	I	0	" Because , "
168503	168560	168501	168501	I	0	" I began the service myself , more than two years ago , without his knowledge , and I do n't want to be betrayed . Why I fail in my ability to finish it , I can not explain . It is a part of the secret which is another person 's and not mine . "
168665	168669	168649	168649	she	223	" What else ? "
168670	168673	168675	168675	I	0	" Estella , "
168690	168708	168675	168675	I	0	" you know I love you . You know that I have loved you long and dearly . "
168756	168810	168742	168743	Miss Havisham	223	" I should have said this sooner , but for my long mistake . It induced me to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another . While I thought you could not help yourself , as it were , I refrained from saying it . But I must say it now . "
168828	168832	168825	168825	her	223	" I know , "
168843	168904	168834	168834	I	0	" I know . I have no hope that I shall ever call you mine , Estella . I am ignorant what may become of me very soon , how poor I may be , or where I may go . Still , I love you . I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house . "
168922	168999	168916	168916	she	223	" It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham , horribly cruel , to practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy , and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit , if she had reflected on the gravity of what she did . But I think she did not . I think that , in the endurance of her own trial , she forgot mine , Estella . "
169027	169031	169033	169033	Estella	195	" It seems , "
169038	169126	169127	169127	I	0	" that there are sentiments , fancies , - I do n't know how to call them , - which I am not able to comprehend . When you say you love me , I know what you mean , as a form of words ; but nothing more . You address nothing in my breast , you touch nothing there . I do n't care for what you say at all . I have tried to warn you of this ; now , have I not ? "
169134	169137	169127	169127	I	0	" Yes . "
169138	169165	169210	169210	she	3405	" Yes . But you would not be warned , for you thought I did not mean it . Now , did you not think so ? "
169166	169196	169210	169210	she	3405	" I thought and hoped you could not mean it . You , so young , untried , and beautiful , Estella ! Surely it is not in Nature . "
169197	169204	169205	169205	she	3405	" It is in my nature , "
169220	169253	169210	169210	she	3405	" It is in the nature formed within me . I make a great difference between you and all other people when I say so much . I can do no more . "
169254	169260	169262	169262	I	0	" Is it not true , "
169264	169277	169262	169262	I	0	" that Bentley Drummle is in town here , and pursuing you ? "
169278	169284	169285	169285	she	3405	" It is quite true , "
169298	169320	169285	169285	she	3405	" That you encourage him , and ride out with him , and that he dines with you this very day ? "
169336	169340	169321	169321	She	3405	" Quite true . "
169341	169350	169351	169351	Her	3405	" You can not love him , Estella ! "
169365	169391	169360	169360	she	3405	" What have I told you ? Do you still think , in spite of it , that I do not mean what I say ? "
169392	169401	169402	169402	She	3405	" You would never marry him , Estella ? "
169424	169441	169421	169421	she	3405	" Why not tell you the truth ? I am going to be married to him . "
169507	169627	169628	169628	My	0	" Estella , dearest Estella , do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this fatal step . Put me aside for ever , - you have done so , I well know , - but bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle . Miss Havisham gives you to him , as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better men who admire you , and to the few who truly love you . Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly , though he has not loved you as long , as I. Take him , and I can bear it better , for your sake ! "
169661	169666	169667	169667	she	3407	" I am going , "
169676	169717	169667	169667	she	3407	" to be married to him . The preparations for my marriage are making , and I shall be married soon . Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption ? It is my own act . "
169718	169733	169648	169648	she	3407	" Your own act , Estella , to fling yourself away upon a brute ? "
169734	169743	169744	169744	she	3407	" On whom should I fling myself away ? "
169751	169860	169667	169667	she	3407	" Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel if people do feel such things that I took nothing to him ? There ! It is done . I shall do well enough , and so will my husband . As to leading me into what you call this fatal step , Miss Havisham would have had me wait , and not marry yet ; but I am tired of the life I have led , which has very few charms for me , and I am willing enough to change it . Say no more . We shall never understand each other . "
169861	169872	169873	169873	I	0	" Such a mean brute , such a stupid brute ! "
169879	169892	169894	169894	Estella	195	" Do n't be afraid of my being a blessing to him , "
169896	169923	169894	169894	Estella	195	" I shall not be that . Come ! Here is my hand . Do we part on this , you visionary boy - or man ? "
169924	169928	169929	169929	I	0	" O Estella ! "
169950	169976	169944	169944	I	0	" even if I remained in England and could hold my head up with the rest , how could I see you Drummle 's wife ? "
169977	169980	169981	169981	she	195	" Nonsense , "
169985	169995	169981	169981	she	195	" nonsense . This will pass in no time . "
169996	170001	169944	169944	I	0	" Never , Estella ! "
170002	170015	169944	169944	I	0	" You will get me out of your thoughts in a week . "
170016	170267	169981	169981	she	195	" Out of my thoughts ! You are part of my existence , part of myself . You have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here , the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then . You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since , - on the river , on the sails of the ships , on the marshes , in the clouds , in the light , in the darkness , in the wind , in the woods , in the sea , in the streets . You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with . The stones of which the strongest London buildings are made are not more real , or more impossible to be displaced by your hands , than your presence and influence have been to me , there and everywhere , and will be . Estella , to the last hour of my life , you can not choose but remain part of my character , part of the little good in me , part of the evil . But , in this separation , I associate you only with the good ; and I will faithfully hold you to that always , for you must have done me far more good than harm , let me feel now what sharp distress I may . O God bless you , God forgive you ! "
170647	170687	170624	170624	he	3419	" I was not quite sure , sir , but I thought so . Here 's a note , sir . The messenger that brought it , said would you be so good as read it by my lantern ? "
170719	170726	170727	170727	I	0	" PLEASE READ THIS , HERE . "
170748	170753	170735	170735	his	6842	" DON'T GO HOME . "
171825	171831	171833	171833	Wemmick	254	" Halloa , Mr. Pip ! "
171835	171843	171833	171833	Wemmick	254	" You did come home , then ? "
171844	171847	171848	171848	I	0	" Yes , "
171851	171859	171848	171848	I	0	" but I did n't go home . "
171860	171866	171868	171868	he	254	" That 's all right , "
171874	171899	171900	171900	I	0	" I left a note for you at each of the Temple gates , on the chance . Which gate did you come to ? "
171904	171923	171925	171925	Wemmick	254	" I 'll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes , "
171927	171977	171978	171978	I	0	" it 's a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it , because you do n't know when it may be put in . I 'm going to take a liberty with you . Would you mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P. ? "
171988	172000	172002	172002	Wemmick	254	" Then you can go about your work , Mary Anne , "
172008	172023	172024	172024	he	254	" which leaves us to ourselves , do n't you see , Mr. Pip ? "
172069	172078	172080	172080	Wemmick	254	" Now , Mr. Pip , you know , "
172082	172124	172125	172125	I	0	" you and I understand one another . We are in our private and personal capacities , and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before to - day . Official sentiments are one thing . We are extra official . "
172156	172164	172166	172166	Wemmick	254	" I accidentally heard , yesterday morning , "
172168	172198	172166	172166	Wemmick	254	" being in a certain place where I once took you , - even between you and me , it 's as well not to mention names when avoidable - "
172199	172204	172206	172206	I.	0	" Much better not , "
172207	172212	172166	172166	Wemmick	254	" I understand you . "
172213	172223	172225	172225	Wemmick	254	" I heard there by chance , yesterday morning , "
172227	172264	172225	172225	Wemmick	254	" that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits , and not unpossessed of portable property , - I do n't know who it may really be , - we wo n't name this person - "
172265	172269	172271	172271	I.	0	" Not necessary , "
172272	172311	172271	172271	I.	0	" - Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go , not always in gratification of their own inclinations , and not quite irrespective of the government expense - "
172344	172363	172365	172365	Wemmick	254	" - By disappearing from such place , and being no more heard of thereabouts . From which , "
172367	172400	172365	172365	Wemmick	254	" conjectures had been raised and theories formed . I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court , Temple , had been watched , and might be watched again . "
172401	172405	172407	172407	I.	0	" By whom ? "
172408	172416	172418	172418	Wemmick	254	" I would n't go into that , "
172422	172463	172418	172418	Wemmick	254	" it might clash with official responsibilities . I heard it , as I have in my time heard other curious things in the same place . I do n't tell it you on information received . I heard it . "
172557	172568	172544	172544	he	254	" All right , ai n't you , Aged P. ? "
172576	172588	172571	172573	the cheerful Aged	3477	" All right , John , my boy , all right ! "
172628	172645	172646	172646	I	0	" This watching of me at my chambers which I have once had reason to suspect , "
172655	172670	172646	172646	I	0	" is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted ; is it ? "
172676	172723	172671	172671	Wemmick	254	" I could n't undertake to say that , of my own knowledge . I mean , I could n't undertake to say it was at first . But it either is , or it will be , or it 's in great danger of being . "
172859	172876	172877	172877	He	254	" You have heard of a man of bad character , whose true name is Compeyson ? "
172884	172889	172877	172877	He	254	" Is he living ? "
172894	172900	172901	172901	He	254	" Is he in London ? "
172928	172931	172933	172933	Wemmick	254	" Now , "
172935	172940	172942	172942	he	254	" questioning being over , "
172950	172987	172942	172942	he	254	" I come to what I did , after hearing what I heard . I went to Garden Court to find you ; not finding you , I went to Clarriker 's to find Mr. Herbert . "
172988	172994	172996	172996	I	0	" And him you found ? "
173002	173071	172996	172996	I	0	" And him I found . Without mentioning any names or going into any details , I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody - Tom , Jack , or Richard - being about the chambers , or about the immediate neighborhood , he had better get Tom , Jack , or Richard out of the way while you were out of the way . "
173072	173082	172942	172942	he	254	" He would be greatly puzzled what to do ? "
173083	173179	173180	173180	I	0	" He was puzzled what to do ; not the less , because I gave him my opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom , Jack , or Richard too far out of the way at present . Mr. Pip , I 'll tell you something . Under existing circumstances , there is no place like a great city when you are once in it . Do n't break cover too soon . Lie close . Wait till things slacken , before you try the open , even for foreign air . "
173196	173200	173202	173202	Wemmick	254	" Mr. Herbert , "
173204	173294	173202	173202	Wemmick	254	" after being all of a heap for half an hour , struck out a plan . He mentioned to me as a secret , that he is courting a young lady who has , as no doubt you are aware , a bedridden Pa. Which Pa , having been in the Purser line of life , lies a - bed in a bow - window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river . You are acquainted with the young lady , most probably ? "
173295	173299	173301	173301	I.	0	" Not personally , "
173476	173485	173487	173487	Wemmick	254	" The house with the bow - window , "
173489	173664	173487	173487	Wemmick	254	" being by the river - side , down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich , and being kept , it seems , by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let , Mr. Herbert put it to me , what did I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom , Jack , or Richard ? Now , I thought very well of it , for three reasons I 'll give you . That is to say : Firstly . It 's altogether out of all your beats , and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small . Secondly . Without going near it yourself , you could always hear of the safety of Tom , Jack , or Richard , through Mr. Herbert . Thirdly . After a while and when it might be prudent , if you should want to slip Tom , Jack , or Richard on board a foreign packet - boat , there he is - ready . "
173684	173854	173855	173855	Wemmick	254	" Well , sir ! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will , and by nine o'clock last night he housed Tom , Jack , or Richard , - whichever it may be , - you and I do n't want to know , - quite successfully . At the old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to Dover , and , in fact , he was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it . Now , another great advantage of all this is , that it was done without you , and when , if any one was concerning himself about your movements , you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged . This diverts suspicion and confuses it ; and for the same reason I recommended that , even if you came back last night , you should not go home . It brings in more confusion , and you want confusion . "
173876	173883	173885	173885	he	254	" And now , Mr. Pip , "
173895	174017	173885	173885	he	254	" I have probably done the most I can do ; but if I can ever do more , - from a Walworth point of view , and in a strictly private and personal capacity , - I shall be glad to do it . Here 's the address . There can be no harm in your going here to - night , and seeing for yourself that all is well with Tom , Jack , or Richard , before you go home , - which is another reason for your not going home last night . But , after you have gone home , do n't go back here . You are very welcome , I am sure , Mr. Pip "
174034	174046	174047	174047	He	3487	" and let me finally impress one important point upon you . "
174062	174096	174049	174049	his	3487	" Avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of his portable property . You do n't know what may happen to him . Do n't let anything happen to the portable property . "
174115	174120	174122	174122	Wemmick	254	" Time 's up , "
174124	174194	174122	174122	Wemmick	254	" and I must be off . If you had nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark , that 's what I should advise . You look very much worried , and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the Aged , - he 'll be up presently , - and a little bit of - you remember the pig ? "
174195	174199	174201	174201	I.	0	" Of course , "
174202	174249	174201	174201	I.	0	" Well ; and a little bit of him . That sausage you toasted was his , and he was in all respects a first - rater . Do try him , if it is only for old acquaintance sake . Good by , Aged Parent ! "
174255	174267	174269	174271	the old man	6015	" All right , John ; all right , my boy ! "
174913	174920	174922	174922	Herbert	265	" All is well , Handel , "
174924	174976	174922	174922	Herbert	265	" and he is quite satisfied , though eager to see you . My dear girl is with her father ; and if you 'll wait till she comes down , I 'll make you known to her , and then we 'll go up stairs . That 's her father . "
174997	175008	175010	175010	Herbert	265	" I am afraid he is a sad old rascal , "
175014	175034	175010	175010	Herbert	265	" but I have never seen him . Do n't you smell rum ? He is always at it . "
175035	175039	175041	175041	I.	0	" At rum ? "
175042	175045	175047	175047	Herbert	265	" Yes , "
175049	175107	175047	175047	Herbert	265	" and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout . He persists , too , in keeping all the provisions up stairs in his room , and serving them out . He keeps them on shelves over his head , and will weigh them all . His room must be like a chandler 's shop . "
175126	175134	175136	175136	Herbert	265	" What else can be the consequence , "
175141	175176	175177	175177	He	265	" if he will cut the cheese ? A man with the gout in his right hand - and everywhere else - ca n't expect to get through a Double Gloucester without hurting himself . "
175193	175209	175211	175211	Herbert	265	" To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple , "
175213	175236	175211	175211	Herbert	265	" for of course people in general wo n't stand that noise . A curious place , Handel ; is n't it ? "
175252	175256	175258	175258	Herbert	265	" Mrs. Whimple , "
175266	175311	175258	175258	Herbert	265	" is the best of housewives , and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her motherly help . For , Clara has no mother of her own , Handel , and no relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim . "
175312	175322	175383	175383	Herbert	265	" Surely that 's not his name , Herbert ? "
175323	175328	175330	175330	Herbert	265	" No , no , "
175332	175382	175330	175330	Herbert	265	" that 's my name for him . His name is Mr. Barley . But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations , and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her family ! "
175566	175569	175570	175570	She	3530	" Clara . "
175601	175605	175607	175607	Herbert	265	" Look here , "
175628	175740	175607	175607	Herbert	265	" here 's poor Clara 's supper , served out every night . Here 's her allowance of bread , and here 's her slice of cheese , and here 's her rum , - which I drink . This is Mr. Barley 's breakfast for to - morrow , served out to be cooked . Two mutton - chops , three potatoes , some split peas , a little flour , two ounces of butter , a pinch of salt , and all this black pepper . It 's stewed up together , and taken hot , and it 's a nice thing for the gout , I should think ! "
175909	175916	175904	175904	Clara	311	" Papa wants me , darling ! "
175921	175931	175933	175933	Herbert	265	" There is an unconscionable old shark for you ! "
175935	175946	175933	175933	Herbert	265	" What do you suppose he wants now , Handel ? "
175947	175953	175955	175955	I.	0	" I do n't know , "
175956	175961	175955	175955	I.	0	" Something to drink ? "
175962	175967	175969	175969	Herbert	265	" That 's it ! "
175982	176017	175969	175969	Herbert	265	" He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table . Wait a moment , and you 'll hear Clara lift him up to take some . There he goes ! "
176029	176032	176034	176034	Herbert	265	" Now , "
176043	176050	176052	176052	Herbert	265	" he 's drinking . Now , "
176064	176073	176052	176052	Herbert	265	" he 's down again on his back ! "
176132	176201	176098	176098	he	265	" Ahoy ! Bless your eyes , here 's old Bill Barley . Here 's old Bill Barley , bless your eyes . Here 's old Bill Barley on the flat of his back , by the Lord . Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder , here 's your old Bill Barley , bless your eyes . Ahoy ! Bless you . "
176424	176432	176433	176433	he	377	" Ay , ay , dear boy ! "
176441	176445	176433	176433	he	377	" Jaggers knows . "
176446	176455	176457	176457	I	0	" Then , I have talked with Wemmick , "
176459	176475	176457	176457	I	0	" and have come to tell you what caution he gave me and what advice . "
176768	176902	176903	176903	I	0	" We are both good watermen , Handel , and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes . No boat would then be hired for the purpose , and no boatmen ; that would save at least a chance of suspicion , and any chance is worth saving . Never mind the season ; do n't you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs , and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river ? You fall into that habit , and then who notices or minds ? Do it twenty or fifty times , and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty - first or fifty - first . "
177020	177030	177031	177031	I	0	" I do n't like to leave you here , "
177036	177053	177031	177031	I	0	" though I can not doubt your being safer here than near me . Good by ! "
177054	177058	177059	177059	he	348	" Dear boy , "
177066	177089	177059	177059	he	348	" I do n't know when we may meet again , and I do n't like good by . Say good night ! "
177090	177121	177122	177122	We	3553	" Good night ! Herbert will go regularly between us , and when the time comes you may be certain I shall be ready . Good night , good night ! "
179062	179067	179068	179073	A certain dark - complexioned Swab	3622	" Fill , fill ! "
179709	179715	179717	179717	I	0	" How do you do ? "
179731	179739	179717	179717	I	0	" I saw that you saw me . "
179740	179747	179748	179748	he	169	" Saw you , Mr. Pip ! "
179751	179766	179748	179748	he	169	" Yes , of course I saw you . But who else was there ? "
179767	179771	179717	179717	I	0	" Who else ? "
179772	179779	179781	179782	Mr. Wopsle	169	" It is the strangest thing , "
179791	179800	179786	179786	his	169	" and yet I could swear to him . "
179813	179828	179830	179831	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there , "
179841	179854	179830	179831	Mr. Wopsle	169	" I ca n't be positive ; yet I think I should . "
179883	179893	179895	179896	Mr. Wopsle	169	" Oh ! He ca n't be in sight , "
179898	179912	179895	179896	Mr. Wopsle	169	" He went out before I went off . I saw him go . "
179956	179991	179942	179942	I	0	" I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you , Mr. Pip , till I saw that you were quite unconscious of him , sitting behind you there like a ghost . "
180049	180099	180018	180018	he	3650	" I dare say you wonder at me , Mr. Pip ; indeed , I see you do . But it is so very strange ! You 'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you . I could hardly believe it myself , if you told me . "
180100	180103	180105	180105	I.	0	" Indeed ? "
180106	180153	180105	180105	I.	0	" No , indeed . Mr. Pip , you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day , when you were quite a child , and I dined at Gargery 's , and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended ? "
180154	180161	180018	180018	he	3650	" I remember it very well . "
180162	180210	180018	180018	he	3650	" And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts , and that we joined in it , and that Gargery took you on his back , and that I took the lead , and you kept up with me as well as you could ? "
180211	180219	180222	180222	he	0	" I remember it all very well . "
180231	180274	180222	180222	he	0	" And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch , and that there was a scuffle between them , and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other ? "
180275	180283	180018	180018	he	3650	" I see it all before me . "
180284	180354	180018	180018	he	3650	" And that the soldiers lighted torches , and put the two in the centre , and that we went on to see the last of them , over the black marshes , with the torchlight shining on their faces , - I am particular about that , - with the torchlight shining on their faces , when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us ? "
180355	180358	180360	180360	I.	3652	" Yes , "
180361	180367	180360	180360	I.	3652	" I remember all that . "
180368	180391	180018	180018	he	3650	" Then , Mr. Pip , one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight . I saw him over your shoulder . "
180392	180395	180396	180396	I	0	" Steady ! "
180404	180415	180399	180399	I	0	" Which of the two do you suppose you saw ? "
180416	180424	180425	180425	he	3653	" The one who had been mauled , "
180429	180453	180425	180425	he	3653	" and I 'll swear I saw him ! The more I think of him , the more certain I am of him . "
180454	180460	180462	180462	I	0	" This is very curious ! "
180480	180485	180462	180462	I	0	" Very curious indeed ! "
180515	180520	180523	180523	he	364	" like a ghost . "
181127	181150	181120	181120	he	237	" As we are going in the same direction , Pip , we may walk together . Where are you bound for ? "
181151	181159	181161	181161	I.	0	" For the Temple , I think , "
181162	181168	181170	181171	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Do n't you know ? "
181173	181176	181177	181177	I	0	" Well , "
181194	181209	181177	181177	I	0	" I do not know , for I have not made up my mind . "
181210	181217	181219	181220	Mr. Jaggers	237	" You are going to dine ? "
181222	181233	181219	181220	Mr. Jaggers	237	" You do n't mind admitting that , I suppose ? "
181234	181237	181238	181238	I	0	" No , "
181241	181249	181238	181238	I	0	" I do n't mind admitting that . "
181250	181256	181219	181220	Mr. Jaggers	237	" And are not engaged ? "
181257	181270	181219	181220	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I do n't mind admitting also that I am not engaged . "
181271	181274	181276	181277	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Then , "
181279	181286	181276	181277	Mr. Jaggers	237	" come and dine with me . "
181298	181303	181295	181295	he	237	" Wemmick 's coming . "
181647	181663	181664	181665	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Did you send that note of Miss Havisham 's to Mr. Pip , Wemmick ? "
181674	181679	181681	181681	Wemmick	254	" No , sir , "
181683	181703	181704	181704	He	237	" it was going by post , when you brought Mr. Pip into the office . Here it is . "
181715	181726	181728	181729	Mr. Jaggers	237	" It 's a note of two lines , Pip , "
181779	181780	181758	181758	she	223	" "
181783	181801	181758	181758	she	223	" said I , casting my eyes over the note , which was exactly in those terms . "
181810	181811	181804	181804	you	237	" "
181818	181836	181804	181804	you	237	" said I , glancing at Wemmick , who was putting fish into the post - office , "
181852	181853	181849	181849	I	0	" "
181865	181872	181873	181873	he	241	" said Wemmick to Mr. Jaggers , "
181883	181934	181873	181873	he	241	" Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay , I settled that I would go to - morrow , and said so . Wemmick drank a glass of wine , and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers , but not at me . "
181944	181949	181952	181952	his	297	" said Mr. Jaggers , "
181961	181973	181955	181955	He	297	" It was as much as I could do to assent . "
182025	182026	182016	182016	he	297	" "
182029	182040	182041	182041	you	3685	" I interrupted , with a burning face and heart , "
182057	182058	182054	182055	Mr. Jaggers	237	" "
182139	182140	182142	182142	I	0	" "
182148	182149	182142	182142	I	0	" "
182158	182163	182142	182142	I	0	" answered Mr. Jaggers , "
182193	182194	182189	182189	Wemmick	254	" "
182200	182212	182189	182189	Wemmick	254	" said Wemmick , not at all addressing himself to me . "
182221	182248	182217	182219	Mrs. Bentley Drummle	278	" said Mr. Jaggers , taking a decanter of choicer wine from his dumb - waiter , and filling for each of us and for himself , "
182296	182351	182286	182286	Molly	296	" She was at his elbow when he addressed her , putting a dish upon the table . As she withdrew her hands from it , she fell back a step or two , nervously muttering some excuse . And a certain action of her fingers , as she spoke , arrested my attention . "
182357	182362	182286	182286	Molly	296	" said Mr. Jaggers . "
182373	182377	182282	182282	Molly	296	" said I , "
182384	183035	182282	182282	Molly	296	" The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting . She stood looking at her master , not understanding whether she was free to go , or whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go . Her look was very intent . Surely , I had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very lately ! He dismissed her , and she glided out of the room . But she remained before me as plainly as if she were still there . I looked at those hands , I looked at those eyes , I looked at that flowing hair ; and I compared them with other hands , other eyes , other hair , that I knew of , and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life . I looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper , and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when I last walked - not alone - in the ruined garden , and through the deserted brewery . I thought how the same feeling had come back when I saw a face looking at me , and a hand waving to me from a stage - coach window ; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning , when I had passed in a carriage - not alone - through a sudden glare of light in a dark street . I thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre , and how such a link , wanting before , had been riveted for me now , when I had passed by a chance swift from Estella 's name to the fingers with their knitting action , and the attentive eyes . And I felt absolutely certain that this woman was Estella 's mother . Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella , and was not likely to have missed the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal . He nodded when I said the subject was painful to me , clapped me on the back , put round the wine again , and went on with his dinner . Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear , and then her stay in the room was very short , and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her . But her hands were Estella 's hands , and her eyes were Estella 's eyes , and if she had reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth . It was a dull evening , for Wemmick drew his wine , when it came round , quite as a matter of business , - just as he might have drawn his salary when that came round , - and with his eyes on his chief , sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross - examination . As to the quantity of wine , his post - office was as indifferent and ready as any other post - office for its quantity of letters . From my point of view , he was the wrong twin all the time , and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth . We took our leave early , and left together . Even when we were groping among Mr. Jaggers 's stock of boots for our hats , I felt that the right twin was on his way back ; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction , before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right twin , and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air . "
183038	183042	182282	182282	Molly	296	" said Wemmick , "
183082	183100	183076	183076	I	0	" I felt that this was a good statement of the case , and told him so . "
183110	183114	183076	183076	I	0	" he answered . "
183129	183206	183076	183076	I	0	" I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham 's adopted daughter , Mrs. Bentley Drummle . He said no . To avoid being too abrupt , I then spoke of the Aged and of Miss Skiffins . He looked rather sly when I mentioned Miss Skiffins , and stopped in the street to blow his nose , with a roll of the head , and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness . "
183209	183213	183215	183215	you	3697	" said I , "
183236	183237	183239	183239	I	0	" "
183241	183245	183239	183239	I	0	" he replied . "
183258	183264	183254	183254	Deuce	381	" he added , suddenly , "
183279	183280	183272	183272	I	0	" "
183290	183291	183288	183288	her	3699	" "
183299	183300	183295	183295	you	3697	" "
183313	183314	183306	183307	Mr. Jaggers	237	" "
183330	183331	183320	183320	She	3699	" "
183366	183367	183352	183352	You	3697	" "
183370	183374	183352	183352	You	3697	" Wemmick replied , "
183416	183417	183404	183404	We	3700	" "
183421	183422	183404	183404	We	3700	" "
183480	183481	183476	183476	you	3697	" "
183487	183488	183489	183490	Mr. Jaggers	237	" "
183495	183506	183489	183490	Mr. Jaggers	237	" pursued Wemmick , with a look full of meaning , "
183781	183791	183776	183776	You	3718	" said Wemmick , touching me on the sleeve , "
183810	183829	183805	183805	he	433	" I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists , that day of the dinner party . "
183834	183839	183847	183847	you	4451	" Wemmick went on ; "
184098	184238	184090	184091	Mr. Jaggers	237	" We say these are not marks of finger - nails , but marks of brambles , and we show you the brambles . You say they are marks of finger - nails , and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child . You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis . For anything we know , she may have destroyed her child , and the child in clinging to her may have scratched her hands . What then ? You are not trying her for the murder of her child ; why do n't you ? As to this case , if you will have scratches , we say that , for anything we know , you may have accounted for them , assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them ? "
184245	184249	184090	184091	Mr. Jaggers	237	" said Wemmick , "
184265	184266	184261	184261	they	3724	" "
184276	184277	184268	184268	she	3725	" "
184285	184330	184268	184268	she	3725	" said Wemmick , ' she went into his service immediately after her acquittal , tamed as she is now . She has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties , but she was tamed from the beginning . "
184331	184341	184261	184261	they	3724	" Do you remember the sex of the child ? "
184342	184350	184268	184268	she	3725	" Said to have been a girl . "
184351	184364	184268	184268	she	3725	" You have nothing more to say to me to - night ? "
184365	184378	184261	184261	they	3724	" Nothing . I got your letter and destroyed it . Nothing . "
184881	184886	184871	184871	She	223	" Is it real ? "
184887	184909	184871	184871	She	223	" It is I , Pip . Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday , and I have lost no time . "
184910	184917	184871	184871	She	223	" Thank you . Thank you . "
184950	184954	184955	184955	she	223	" I want , "
184958	185002	184955	184955	she	223	" to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here , and to show you that I am not all stone . But perhaps you can never believe , now , that there is anything human in my heart ? "
185045	185078	185028	185028	she	223	" You said , speaking for your friend , that you could tell me how to do something useful and good . Something that you would like done , is it not ? "
185079	185089	185123	185123	she	223	" Something that I would like done very much . "
185090	185095	185096	185096	I	0	" What is it ? "
185167	185173	185174	185174	she	223	" Do you break off , "
185188	185202	185179	185179	her	223	" because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me ? "
185203	185208	185209	185209	I	0	" No , no , "
185212	185235	185209	185209	I	0	" how can you think so , Miss Havisham ! I stopped because I thought you were not following what I said . "
185236	185242	185243	185243	she	223	" Perhaps I was not , "
185253	185271	185272	185272	She	223	" Begin again , and let me look at something else . Stay ! Now tell me . "
185364	185367	185369	185369	she	223	" So ! "
185382	185394	185369	185369	she	223	" And how much money is wanting to complete the purchase ? "
185410	185415	185373	185373	her	223	" Nine hundred pounds . "
185416	185439	185369	185369	she	223	" If I give you the money for this purpose , will you keep my secret as you have kept your own ? "
185440	185445	185472	185472	She	223	" Quite as faithfully . "
185446	185456	185505	185505	She	223	" And your mind will be more at rest ? "
185457	185463	185505	185505	She	223	" Much more at rest . "
185464	185471	185472	185472	She	223	" Are you very unhappy now ? "
185525	185556	185505	185505	She	223	" I am far from happy , Miss Havisham ; but I have other causes of disquiet than any you know of . They are the secrets I have mentioned . "
185574	185595	185562	185562	she	223	" It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness , Is it true ? "
185596	185600	185564	185564	her	223	" Too true . "
185601	185630	185684	185684	she	223	" Can I only serve you , Pip , by serving your friend ? Regarding that as done , is there nothing I can do for you yourself ? "
185631	185658	185659	185659	She	223	" Nothing . I thank you for the question . I thank you even more for the tone of the question . But there is nothing . "
185720	185731	185684	185684	she	223	" You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers ? "
185732	185741	185687	185687	her	223	" Quite . I dined with him yesterday . "
185742	185792	185813	185813	She	223	" This is an authority to him to pay you that money , to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend . I keep no money here ; but if you would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter , I will send it to you . "
185793	185812	185813	185813	She	223	" Thank you , Miss Havisham ; I have not the least objection to receiving it from him . "
185891	185909	185884	185884	she	223	" My name is on the first leaf . If you can ever write under my name , "
185914	185929	185864	185864	she	223	" though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do it ! "
185930	185935	185937	185937	I	0	" O Miss Havisham , "
185939	185979	185937	185937	I	0	" I can do it now . There have been sore mistakes ; and my life has been a blind and thankless one ; and I want forgiveness and direction far too much , to be bitter with you . "
186164	186167	186168	186168	she	223	" O ! "
186173	186184	186168	186168	she	223	" What have I done ! What have I done ! "
186185	186221	186168	186168	she	223	" If you mean , Miss Havisham , what have you done to injure me , let me answer . Very little . I should have loved her under any circumstances . Is she married ? "
186222	186225	186168	186168	she	223	" Yes . "
186245	186256	186257	186257	She	223	" What have I done ! What have I done ! "
186278	186284	186257	186257	She	223	" What have I done ! "
186475	186523	186536	186536	she	223	" Until you spoke to her the other day , and until I saw in you a looking - glass that showed me what I once felt myself , I did not know what I had done . What have I done ! What have I done ! "
186539	186543	186544	186544	I	0	" Miss Havisham , "
186554	186615	186544	186544	I	0	" you may dismiss me from your mind and conscience . But Estella is a different case , and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of her right nature away from her , it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past through a hundred years . "
186616	186632	186642	186642	her	223	" Yes , yes , I know it . But , Pip - my dear ! "
186646	186679	186544	186544	I	0	" My dear ! Believe this : when she first came to me , I meant to save her from misery like my own . At first , I meant no more . "
186680	186685	186687	186687	I.	0	" Well , well ! "
186688	186693	186687	186687	I.	0	" I hope so . "
186694	186759	186544	186544	I	0	" But as she grew , and promised to be very beautiful , I gradually did worse , and with my praises , and with my jewels , and with my teachings , and with this figure of myself always before her , a warning to back and point my lessons , I stole her heart away , and put ice in its place . "
186760	186763	186764	186764	I	0	" Better , "
186770	186786	186764	186764	I	0	" to have left her a natural heart , even to be bruised or broken . "
186811	186819	186820	186820	she	223	" If you knew all my story , "
186823	186838	186820	186820	she	223	" you would have some compassion for me and a better understanding of me . "
186839	186843	186844	186844	I	0	" Miss Havisham , "
186853	186930	186844	186844	I	0	" I believe I may say that I do know your story , and have known it ever since I first left this neighborhood . It has inspired me with great commiseration , and I hope I understand it and its influences . Does what has passed between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to Estella ? Not as she is , but as she was when she first came here ? "
186966	186970	186953	186953	She	3763	" Go on . "
186971	186977	186978	186978	She	3763	" Whose child was Estella ? "
186983	186989	186980	186980	her	3763	" You do n't know ? "
186996	187009	186992	186992	her	3763	" But Mr. Jaggers brought her here , or sent her here ? "
187010	187015	186980	186980	her	3763	" Brought her here . "
187016	187026	187027	187027	She	3763	" Will you tell me how that came about ? "
187037	187148	187027	187027	She	3763	" I had been shut up in these rooms a long time I do n't know how long ; you know what time the clocks keep here , when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear and love , and save from my fate . I had first seen him when I sent for him to lay this place waste for me ; having read of him in the newspapers , before I and the world parted . He told me that he would look about him for such an orphan child . One night he brought her here asleep , and I called her Estella . "
187149	187157	187027	187027	She	3763	" Might I ask her age then ? "
187158	187180	187027	187027	She	3763	" Two or three . She herself knows nothing , but that she was left an orphan and I adopted her . "
188480	188486	188470	188470	she	223	" What have I done ! "
188490	188506	188470	188470	she	223	" When she first came , I meant to save her from misery like mine . "
188510	188526	188470	188470	she	223	" Take the pencil and write under my name , ' I forgive her ! ' "
188672	188688	188663	188663	they	3793	" Take the pencil and write under my name , ' I forgive her . ' "
189151	189165	189144	189144	he	265	" I sat with Provis last night , Handel , two good hours . "
189166	189171	189393	189393	his	3801	" Where was Clara ? "
189172	189177	189179	189179	Herbert	265	" Dear little thing ! "
189181	189241	189179	189179	Herbert	265	" She was up and down with Gruffandgrim all the evening . He was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment she left his sight . I doubt if he can hold out long , though . What with rum and pepper , - and pepper and rum , - I should think his pegging must be nearly over . "
189242	189252	189393	189393	his	3801	" And then you will be married , Herbert ? "
189253	189319	189144	189144	he	265	" How can I take care of the dear child otherwise ? - Lay your arm out upon the back of the sofa , my dear boy , and I 'll sit down here , and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes . I was speaking of Provis . Do you know , Handel , he improves ? "
189320	189336	189179	189179	Herbert	265	" I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him . "
189337	189385	189386	189386	I	0	" So you did . And so he is . He was very communicative last night , and told me more of his life . You remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble with . - Did I hurt you ? "
189404	189422	189396	189396	His	3801	" I had forgotten that , Herbert , but I remember it now you speak of it . "
189423	189456	189386	189386	I	0	" Well ! He went into that part of his life , and a dark wild part it is . Shall I tell you ? Or would it worry you just now ? "
189457	189467	189468	189468	Herbert	265	" Tell me by all means . Every word . "
189497	189503	189504	189504	he	265	" Your head is cool ? "
189510	189513	189515	189515	I.	0	" Quite , "
189516	189527	189515	189515	I.	0	" Tell me what Provis said , my dear Herbert . "
189528	189532	189534	189534	Herbert	265	" It seems , "
189536	189606	189534	189534	Herbert	265	" - there 's a bandage off most charmingly , and now comes the cool one , - makes you shrink at first , my poor dear fellow , do n't it ? but it will be comfortable presently , - it seems that the woman was a young woman , and a jealous woman , and a revengeful woman ; revengeful , Handel , to the last degree . "
189607	189613	189515	189515	I.	0	" To what last degree ? "
189614	189628	189515	189515	I.	0	" Murder . - Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place ? "
189629	189646	189534	189534	Herbert	265	" I do n't feel it . How did she murder ? Whom did she murder ? "
189647	189662	189664	189664	Herbert	265	" Why , the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name , "
189666	189752	189664	189664	Herbert	265	" but , she was tried for it , and Mr. Jaggers defended her , and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis . It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim , and there had been a struggle - in a barn . Who began it , or how fair it was , or how unfair , may be doubtful ; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful , for the victim was found throttled . "
189753	189761	189534	189534	Herbert	265	" Was the woman brought in guilty ? "
189762	189778	189515	189515	I.	0	" No ; she was acquitted . - My poor Handel , I hurt you ! "
189779	189794	189515	189515	I.	0	" It is impossible to be gentler , Herbert . Yes ? What else ? "
189795	189953	189534	189534	Herbert	265	" This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child ; a little child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond . On the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you , the young woman presented herself before Provis for one moment , and swore that she would destroy the child which was in her possession , and he should never see it again ; then she vanished . - There 's the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more , and now there remains but the right hand , which is a far easier job . I can do it better by this light than by a stronger , for my hand is steadiest when I do n't see the poor blistered patches too distinctly . - You do n't think your breathing is affected , my dear boy ? You seem to breathe quickly . "
189954	189968	189515	189515	I.	0	" Perhaps I do , Herbert . Did the woman keep her oath ? "
189969	189983	189515	189515	I.	0	" There comes the darkest part of Provis 's life . She did . "
189984	189993	189534	189534	Herbert	265	" That is , he says she did . "
189994	190004	190006	190006	Herbert	265	" Why , of course , my dear boy , "
190026	190038	190006	190006	Herbert	265	" He says it all . I have no other information . "
190039	190046	189515	189515	I.	0	" No , to be sure . "
190047	190052	190054	190054	Herbert	265	" Now , whether , "
190056	190209	190054	190054	Herbert	265	" he had used the child 's mother ill , or whether he had used the child 's mother well , Provis does n't say ; but she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside , and he seems to have felt pity for her , and forbearance towards her . Therefore , fearing he should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child , and so be the cause of her death , he hid himself much as he grieved for the child , kept himself dark , as he says , out of the way and out of the trial , and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel , out of whom the jealousy arose . After the acquittal she disappeared , and thus he lost the child and the child 's mother . "
190210	190216	189515	189515	I.	0	" I want to ask - "
190217	190299	189515	189515	I.	0	" A moment , my dear boy , and I have done . That evil genius , Compeyson , the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels , knowing of his keeping out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so , of course afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him poorer and working him harder . It was clear last night that this barbed the point of Provis 's animosity . "
190300	190306	190308	190308	I	0	" I want to know , "
190310	190324	190308	190308	I	0	" and particularly , Herbert , whether he told you when this happened ? "
190325	190380	189515	189515	I.	0	" Particularly ? Let me remember , then , what he said as to that . His expression was , ' a round score o ' year ago , and a'most directly after I took up wi ' Compeyson . ' How old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard ? "
190381	190389	189515	189515	I.	0	" I think in my seventh year . "
190390	190427	190308	190308	I	0	" Ay . It had happened some three or four years then , he said , and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost , who would have been about your age . "
190428	190431	190433	190433	I	0	" Herbert , "
190445	190465	190433	190433	I	0	" can you see me best by the light of the window , or the light of the fire ? "
190466	190471	190473	190473	Herbert	265	" By the firelight , "
190479	190484	190473	190473	Herbert	265	" Look at me . "
190485	190496	190308	190308	I	0	" I do look at you , my dear boy . "
190497	190501	190308	190308	I	0	" Touch me . "
190502	190512	190473	190473	Herbert	265	" I do touch you , my dear boy . "
190513	190539	190308	190308	I	0	" You are not afraid that I am in any fever , or that my head is much disordered by the accident of last night ? "
190540	190549	190551	190551	Herbert	265	" N - no , my dear boy , "
190560	190572	190551	190551	Herbert	265	" You are rather excited , but you are quite yourself . "
190573	190597	190308	190308	I	0	" I know I am quite myself . And the man we have in hiding down the river , is Estella 's Father . "
191270	191277	191279	191279	he	237	" I am sorry , Pip , "
191296	191304	191279	191279	he	237	" that we do nothing for you . "
191305	191315	191316	191316	I	0	" Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me , "
191319	191334	191316	191316	I	0	" whether she could do nothing for me , and I told her No . "
191335	191343	191345	191346	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Everybody should know his own business , "
191357	191361	191351	191351	Wemmick	254	" portable property . "
191362	191377	191379	191380	Mr Jaggers	237	" I should not have told her No , if I had been you , "
191382	191394	191379	191380	Mr Jaggers	237	" but every man ought to know his own business best . "
191395	191401	191403	191403	Wemmick	254	" Every man 's business , "
191410	191415	191403	191403	Wemmick	254	" is portable property . "
191442	191477	191433	191433	I	0	" I did ask something of Miss Havisham , however , sir . I asked her to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter , and she gave me all she possessed . "
191478	191482	191484	191485	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Did she ? "
191499	191529	191497	191497	himself	237	" Hah ! I do n't think I should have done so , if I had been Miss Havisham . But she ought to know her own business best . "
191530	191556	191557	191558	Mr. Jaggers	237	" I know more of the history of Miss Havisham 's adopted child than Miss Havisham herself does , sir . I know her mother . "
191566	191569	191557	191558	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Mother ? "
191570	191581	191497	191497	himself	237	" I have seen her mother within these three days . "
191582	191585	191587	191588	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Yes ? "
191590	191607	191587	191588	Mr. Jaggers	237	" And so have you , sir . And you have seen her still more recently . "
191608	191611	191613	191614	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Yes ? "
191616	191630	191613	191614	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Perhaps I know more of Estella 's history than even you do , "
191633	191640	191632	191632	I.	0	" I know her father too . "
191771	191784	191786	191787	Mr. Jaggers	237	" So ! You know the young lady 's father , Pip ? "
191789	191792	191793	191793	I	0	" Yes , "
191796	191808	191793	191793	I	0	" and his name is Provis - from New South Wales . "
191902	191910	191912	191913	Mr. Jaggers	237	" And on what evidence , Pip , "
191930	191937	191919	191919	he	237	" does Provis make this claim ? "
191938	191945	191947	191947	I	0	" He does not make it , "
191949	191969	191947	191947	I	0	" and has never made it , and has no knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence . "
192127	192130	192138	192138	he	237	" Hah ! "
192147	192164	192138	192138	he	237	" What item was it you were at , Wemmick , when Mr. Pip came in ? "
192396	192473	192388	192388	I	0	" Wemmick , I know you to be a man with a gentle heart . I have seen your pleasant home , and your old father , and all the innocent , cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life . And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers , and to represent to him that , all circumstances considered , he ought to be more open with me ! "
192533	192539	192541	192542	Mr. Jaggers	237	" What 's all this ? "
192544	192559	192541	192542	Mr. Jaggers	237	" You with an old father , and you with pleasant and playful ways ? "
192560	192563	192565	192565	Wemmick	254	" Well ! "
192567	192581	192565	192565	Wemmick	254	" If I do n't bring 'em here , what does it matter ? "
192582	192585	192587	192588	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Pip , "
192601	192614	192591	192591	his	237	" this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London . "
192615	192622	192624	192624	Wemmick	254	" Not a bit of it , "
192631	192638	192640	192640	they	3824	" I think you 're another . "
192659	192666	192668	192669	Mr. Jaggers	237	" You with a pleasant home ? "
192671	192680	192668	192669	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Since it do n't interfere with business , "
192684	192732	192733	192734	Mr. Jaggers	237	" let it be so . Now , I look at you , sir , I should n't wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days , when you 're tired of all this work . "
192750	192753	192755	192755	he	237	" Pip , "
192757	192806	192807	192807	He	237	" we wo n't talk about ' poor dreams ; ' you know more about such things than I , having much fresher experience of that kind . But now about this other matter . I 'll put a case to you . Mind ! I admit nothing . "
192826	192831	192833	192834	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Now , Pip , "
192836	192929	192833	192834	Mr. Jaggers	237	" put this case . Put the case that a woman , under such circumstances as you have mentioned , held her child concealed , and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser , on his representing to her that he must know , with an eye to the latitude of his defence , how the fact stood about that child . Put the case that , at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up . "
192930	192937	192818	192818	he	237	" I follow you , sir . "
192938	193084	192833	192834	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil , and that all he saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction . Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar , where they were held up to be seen ; put the case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned , whipped , transported , neglected , cast out , qualified in all ways for the hangman , and growing up to be hanged . Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn , to develop into the fish that were to come to his net , - to be prosecuted , defended , forsworn , made orphans , bedevilled somehow . "
193085	193092	193145	193145	I	0	" I follow you , sir . "
193093	193144	192833	192834	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Put the case , Pip , that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved ; whom the father believed dead , and dared make no stir about ; as to whom , over the mother , the legal adviser had this power : "
193252	193268	193294	193294	Wemmick	254	" Put the case that this was done , and that the woman was cleared . "
193269	193275	193294	193294	Wemmick	254	" I understand you perfectly . "
193276	193284	193294	193294	Wemmick	254	" But that I make no admissions ? "
193285	193292	193294	193294	Wemmick	254	" That you make no admissions . "
193297	193301	193294	193294	Wemmick	254	" No admissions . "
193302	193402	193294	193294	Wemmick	254	" Put the case , Pip , that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the woman 's intellects , and that when she was set at liberty , she was scared out of the ways of the world , and went to him to be sheltered . Put the case that he took her in , and that he kept down the old , wild , violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out , by asserting his power over her in the old way . Do you comprehend the imaginary case ? "
193403	193406	193294	193294	Wemmick	254	" Quite . "
193407	193492	193294	193294	Wemmick	254	" Put the case that the child grew up , and was married for money . That the mother was still living . That the father was still living . That the mother and father , unknown to one another , were dwelling within so many miles , furlongs , yards if you like , of one another . That the secret was still a secret , except that you had got wind of it . Put that last case to yourself very carefully . "
193493	193497	193294	193294	Wemmick	254	" I do . "
193498	193510	193294	193294	Wemmick	254	" I ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully . "
193515	193519	193512	193512	Wemmick	254	" I do . "
193520	193711	193712	193712	I	0	" For whose sake would you reveal the secret ? For the father 's ? I think he would not be much the better for the mother . For the mother 's ? I think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was . For the daughter 's ? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her parentage for the information of her husband , and to drag her back to disgrace , after an escape of twenty years , pretty secure to last for life . But add the case that you had loved her , Pip , and had made her the subject of those ' poor dreams ' which have , at one time or another , been in the heads of more men than you think likely , then I tell you that you had better - and would much sooner when you had thought well of it - chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand , and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there , to cut that off too . "
193743	193748	193750	193751	the latter	1296	" Now , Wemmick , "
193759	193773	193750	193751	the latter	1296	" what item was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in ? "
194020	194026	194028	194028	Wemmick	254	" What are you about ? "
194035	194044	194028	194028	Wemmick	254	" What do you come snivelling here for ? "
194045	194057	193987	193987	he	3838	" I did n't go to do it , Mr. Wemmick . "
194058	194062	194064	194064	Wemmick	254	" You did , "
194066	194102	194064	194064	Wemmick	254	" How dare you ? You 're not in a fit state to come here , if you ca n't come here without spluttering like a bad pen . What do you mean by it ? "
194103	194115	194117	194117	Mike	249	" A man ca n't help his feelings , Mr. Wemmick , "
194119	194123	194125	194125	Wemmick	254	" His what ? "
194130	194135	194125	194125	Wemmick	254	" Say that again ! "
194136	194143	194145	194146	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Now look here my man , "
194158	194175	194145	194146	Mr. Jaggers	237	" Get out of this office . I 'll have no feelings here . Get out . "
194176	194182	194184	194184	Wemmick	254	" It serves you right , "
194186	194190	194184	194184	Wemmick	254	" Get out . "
194638	194676	194633	194633	Wemmick	254	" Walworth . Burn this as soon as read . Early in the week , or say Wednesday , you might do what you know of , if you felt disposed to try it . Now burn . "
194726	194736	194738	194738	Herbert	265	" I have thought it over again and again , "
194740	194775	194738	194738	Herbert	265	" and I think I know a better course than taking a Thames waterman . Take Startop . A good fellow , a skilled hand , fond of us , and enthusiastic and honorable . "
194785	194796	194776	194776	I	0	" But how much would you tell him , Herbert ? "
194797	194847	194738	194738	Herbert	265	" It is necessary to tell him very little . Let him suppose it a mere freak , but a secret one , until the morning comes : then let him know that there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away . You go with him ? "
194848	194852	194868	194868	I	0	" No doubt . "
194853	194856	194776	194776	I	0	" Where ? "
195385	195458	195459	195459	I	0	" If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to - night or tomorrow night at nine , and to come to the little sluice - house by the limekiln , you had better come . If you want information regarding your uncle Provis , you had much better come and tell no one , and lose no time . You must come alone . Bring this with you . "
196193	196201	196203	196203	I.	0	" Do you know the young man ? "
196204	196208	196210	196211	the landlord	1154	" Know him ! "
196213	196224	196210	196211	the landlord	1154	" Ever since he was - no height at all . "
196225	196235	196245	196246	the landlord	1154	" Does he ever come back to this neighborhood ? "
196236	196243	196245	196246	the landlord	1154	" Ay , he comes back , "
196248	196270	196245	196246	the landlord	1154	" to his great friends , now and again , and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him . "
196271	196277	196245	196246	the landlord	1154	" What man is that ? "
196278	196285	196287	196288	the landlord	1154	" Him that I speak of , "
196290	196294	196287	196288	the landlord	1154	" Mr. Pumblechook . "
196295	196304	196245	196246	the landlord	1154	" Is he ungrateful to no one else ? "
196305	196316	196318	196319	the landlord	1154	" No doubt he would be , if he could , "
196321	196337	196318	196319	the landlord	1154	" but he ca n't . And why ? Because Pumblechook done everything for him . "
196338	196344	196245	196246	the landlord	1154	" Does Pumblechook say so ? "
196345	196349	196351	196352	the landlord	1154	" Say so ! "
196354	196363	196351	196352	the landlord	1154	" He han't no call to say so . "
196364	196371	196245	196246	the landlord	1154	" But does he say so ? "
196372	196393	196395	196396	the landlord	1154	" It would turn a man 's blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of it , sir , "
196401	196433	196398	196398	I	0	" Yet Joe , dear Joe , you never tell of it . Long - suffering and loving Joe , you never complain . Nor you , sweet - tempered Biddy ! "
196434	196445	196447	196448	the landlord	1154	" Your appetite 's been touched like by your accident , "
196459	196465	196447	196448	the landlord	1154	" Try a tenderer bit . "
196466	196472	196473	196473	I	0	" No , thank you , "
196486	196498	196473	196473	I	0	" I can eat no more . Please take it away . "

198085	198096	198078	198078	he	433	" Why have you set upon me in the dark ? "
198097	198122	198123	198123	His	433	" Because I mean to do it all myself . One keeps a secret better than two . O you enemy , you enemy ! "

198254	198282	198204	198204	he	433	" You did that , and that would be enough , without more . How dared you to come betwixt me and a young woman I liked ? "
198283	198288	198230	198230	I	0	" When did I ? "
198289	198309	198204	198204	he	433	" When did n't you ? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to her . "
198310	198338	198204	198204	he	433	" You gave it to yourself ; you gained it for yourself . I could have done you no harm , if you had done yourself none . "
198339	198368	198370	198370	he	3952	" You 're a liar . And you 'll take any pains , and spend any money , to drive me out of this country , will you ? "
198386	198438	198370	198370	he	3952	" Now , I 'll tell you a piece of information . It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to - night . Ah ! If it was all your money twenty times told , to the last brass farden ! "
198464	198474	198457	198457	I	0	" What are you going to do to me ? "

I left her for dead , and if there had been a limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you , she should n't have come to life again . But it warn't Old Orlick as did it ; it was you . You was favored , and he was bullied and beat . Old Orlick bullied and beat , eh ? Now you pays for it . You done it ; now you pays for it . "
199749	199773	199714	199714	he	3967	" Wolf , I 'll tell you something more . It was Old Orlick as you tumbled over on your stairs that night . "
199836	200014	200052	200055	the good motherly woman	3983	" And why was Old Orlick there ? I 'll tell you something more , wolf . You and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country , so far as getting a easy living in it goes , and I 've took up with new companions , and new masters . Some of 'em writes my letters when I wants 'em wrote , - do you mind ? - writes my letters , wolf ! They writes fifty hands ; they 're not like sneaking you , as writes but one . I 've had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life , since you was down here at your sister 's burying . I han't seen a way to get you safe , and I 've looked arter you to know your ins and outs . For , says Old Orlick to himself , ' Somehow or another I 'll have him ! ' What ! When I looks for you , I finds your uncle Provis , eh ? "
200082	200235	200241	200241	he	3985	" You with a uncle too ! Why , I know'd you at Gargery 's when you was so small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked you away dead as I 'd thoughts o ' doing , odd times , when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday , and you had n't found no uncles then . No , not you ! But when Old Orlick come for to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg - iron wot Old Orlick had picked up , filed asunder , on these meshes ever so many year ago , and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it , like a bullock , as he means to drop you - hey ? - when he come for to hear that - hey ? "
200262	200265	200266	200266	he	3985	" Ah ! "
200276	200491	200266	200266	he	3985	" the burnt child dreads the fire ! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt , Old Orlick knowed you was smuggling your uncle Provis away , Old Orlick 's a match for you and know'd you 'd come to - night ! Now I 'll tell you something more , wolf , and this ends it . There 's them that 's as good a match for your uncle Provis as Old Orlick has been for you . Let him ' ware them , when he 's lost his nevvy ! Let him ' ware them , when no man ca n't find a rag of his dear relation 's clothes , nor yet a bone of his body . There 's them that ca n't and that wo n't have Magwitch , - yes , I know the name ! - alive in the same land with them , and that 's had such sure information of him when he was alive in another land , as that he could n't and should n't leave it unbeknown and put them in danger . P'raps it 's them that writes fifty hands , and that 's not like sneaking you as writes but one . ' Ware Compeyson , Magwitch , and the gallows ! "
201042	201050	201052	201052	Trabb	243	" I think he 's all right ! "

203853	203873	203846	203846	Herbert	265	" Right ! He was not to come down till he saw us . Can you see his signal ? "
203874	203902	203903	203903	We	4076	" Not well from here ; but I think I see it . - Now I see him ! Pull both . Easy , Herbert . Oars ! "
203956	203960	203961	203961	he	265	" Dear boy ! "
203977	203989	203961	203961	he	265	" Faithful dear boy , well done . Thankye , thankye ! "
204408	204416	204417	204417	he	4103	" If you knowed , dear boy , "
204422	204462	204417	204417	he	4103	" what it is to sit here alonger my dear boy and have my smoke , arter having been day by day betwixt four walls , you 'd envy me . But you do n't know what it is . "
204463	204473	204474	204474	I	0	" I think I know the delights of freedom , "
204477	204480	204482	204482	he	4103	" Ah , "
204489	204530	204482	204482	he	4103	" But you do n't know it equal to me . You must have been under lock and key , dear boy , to know it equal to me , - but I ai n't a going to be low . "
204604	204697	204595	204595	he	4103	" You see , dear boy , when I was over yonder , t'other side the world , I was always a looking to this side ; and it come flat to be there , for all I was a growing rich . Everybody knowed Magwitch , and Magwitch could come , and Magwitch could go , and nobody 's head would be troubled about him . They ai n't so easy concerning me here , dear boy , - would n't be , leastwise , if they knowed where I was . "
204698	204704	204706	204706	I	0	" If all goes well , "
204708	204722	204595	204595	he	4103	" you will be perfectly free and safe again within a few hours . "
204723	204726	204727	204727	he	4111	" Well , "
204735	204740	204727	204727	he	4111	" I hope so . "
204741	204746	204747	204747	He	4111	" And think so ? "
204778	204899	204902	204902	his	4111	" Ay , I s'pose I think so , dear boy . We 'd be puzzled to be more quiet and easy - going than we are at present . But - it 's a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water , p'raps , as makes me think it - I was a thinking through my smoke just then , that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what I catches hold of . Nor yet we ca n't no more hold their tide than I can hold this . And it 's run through my fingers and gone , you see ! "
204906	204920	204922	204922	I.	4113	" But for your face I should think you were a little despondent , "
204923	204969	204970	204970	He	4111	" Not a bit on it , dear boy ! It comes of flowing on so quiet , and of that there rippling at the boat 's head making a sort of a Sunday tune . Maybe I 'm a growing a trifle old besides . "
205058	205065	205055	205055	he	4111	" Do you , dear boy ? "
205908	205914	205915	205917	one of us	504	" What was that ripple ? "
205928	205935	205915	205917	one of us	504	" Is that a boat yonder ? "
206080	206106	206409	206409	you	4165	" the landlord said . No other company was in the house than the landlord , his wife , and a grizzled male creature , the "
206108	206365	206409	206409	you	4165	" of the little causeway , who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low - water mark too . With this assistant , I went down to the boat again , and we all came ashore , and brought out the oars , and rudder and boat - hook , and all else , and hauled her up for the night . We made a very good meal by the kitchen fire , and then apportioned the bedrooms : Herbert and Startop were to occupy one ; I and our charge the other . We found the air as carefully excluded from both , as if air were fatal to life ; and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have thought the family possessed . But we considered ourselves well off , notwithstanding , for a more solitary place we could not have found . While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal , the Jack - who was sitting in a corner , and who had a bloated pair of shoes on , which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon , as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashore - asked me if we had seen a four - oared galley going up with the tide ? When I told him No , he said she must have gone down then , and yet she "
206370	206376	206409	206409	you	4165	" when she left there . "
206390	206395	206377	206377	They	4163	" said the Jack , "
206400	206401	206409	206409	you	4165	" "
206412	206415	206409	206409	you	4165	" said I. "
206419	206424	206426	206427	two sitters	4166	" said the Jack , "
206429	206430	206426	206427	two sitters	4166	" "
206437	206438	206439	206439	They	4163	" "
206465	206470	206463	206463	myself	0	" said the Jack , "
206479	206480	206463	206463	myself	0	" "
206483	206484	206485	206485	I	0	" "
206489	206511	206512	206512	He	4169	" said the Jack . He spoke in a slushy voice , as if much mud had washed into his throat . "
206515	206539	206540	206540	he	4169	" said the landlord , a weakly meditative man with a pale eye , who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack , - "
206550	206551	206552	206552	I	0	" "
206558	206563	206555	206555	I	0	" observed the Jack . "
206572	206577	206578	206578	I	0	" said the landlord . "
206581	206586	206578	206578	I	0	" said the Jack . "
206594	206595	206588	206588	you	0	" "
206599	206668	206597	206597	I	0	" In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in his views , the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off , looked into it , knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor , and put it on again . He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he could afford to do anything . "
206686	206694	206677	206677	they	4171	" asked the landlord , vacillating weakly . "
206700	206705	206714	206714	'em	4173	" returned the Jack . "
206727	206728	206714	206714	'em	4173	" "
206736	206748	206734	206734	Jack	369	" remonstrated the landlord , in a melancholy and pathetic way . "
206762	206776	206749	206750	A Custum	4174	" said the Jack , repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt , "
206827	207882	206818	206818	Custum	385	" Saying which he went out in disdain ; and the landlord , having no one to reply upon , found it impracticable to pursue the subject . This dialogue made us all uneasy , and me very uneasy . The dismal wind was muttering round the house , the tide was flapping at the shore , and I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened . A four - oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of . When I had induced Provis to go up to bed , I went outside with my two companions Startop by this time knew the state of the case , and held another council . Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer 's time , which would be about one in the afternoon , or whether we should put off early in the morning , was the question we discussed . On the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were , until within an hour or so of the steamer 's time , and then to get out in her track , and drift easily with the tide . Having settled to do this , we returned into the house and went to bed . I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on , and slept well for a few hours . When I awoke , the wind had risen , and the sign of the house the Ship was creaking and banging about , with noises that startled me . Rising softly , for my charge lay fast asleep , I looked out of the window . It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat , and , as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon , I saw two men looking into her . They passed by under the window , looking at nothing else , and they did not go down to the landing - place which I could discern to be empty , but struck across the marsh in the direction of the Nore . My first impulse was to call up Herbert , and show him the two men going away . But reflecting , before I got into his room , which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine , that he and Startop had had a harder day than I , and were fatigued , I forbore . Going back to my window , I could see the two men moving over the marsh . In that light , however , I soon lost them , and , feeling very cold , lay down to think of the matter , and fell asleep again . We were up early . As we walked to and fro , all four together , before breakfast , I deemed it right to recount what I had seen . Again our charge was the least anxious of the party . It was very likely that the men belonged to the Custom House , he said quietly , and that they had no thought of us . I tried to persuade myself that it was so , - as , indeed , it might easily be . However , I proposed that he and I should walk away together to a distant point we could see , and that the boat should take us aboard there , or as near there as might prove feasible , at about noon . This being considered a good precaution , soon after breakfast he and I set forth , without saying anything at the tavern . He smoked his pipe as we went along , and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder . One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger , not he , and that he was reassuring me . We spoke very little . As we approached the point , I begged him to remain in a sheltered place , while I went on to reconnoitre ; for it was towards it that the men had passed in the night . He complied , and I went on alone . There was no boat off the point , nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it , nor were there any signs of the men having embarked there . But , to be sure , the tide was high , and there might have been some footpints under water . When he looked out from his shelter in the distance , and saw that I waved my hat to him to come up , he rejoined me , and there we waited ; sometimes lying on the bank , wrapped in our coats , and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves , until we saw our boat coming round . We got aboard easily , and rowed out into the track of the steamer . By that time it wanted but ten minutes of one o'clock , and we began to look out for her smoke . But , it was half - past one before we saw her smoke , and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer . As they were coming on at full speed , we got the two bags ready , and took that opportunity of saying good by to Herbert and Startop . We had all shaken hands cordially , and neither Herbert 's eyes nor mine were quite dry , when I saw a four - oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us , and row out into the same track . A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer 's smoke , by reason of the bend and wind of the river ; but now she was visible , coming head on . I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide , that she might see us lying by for her , and I adjured Provis to sit quite still , wrapped in his cloak . He answered cheerily , "
207890	208035	208036	208036	Hamburg	135	" and sat like a statue . Meantime the galley , which was very skilfully handled , had crossed us , let us come up with her , and fallen alongside . Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars , she kept alongside , drifting when we drifted , and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled . Of the two sitters one held the rudder - lines , and looked at us attentively , - as did all the rowers ; the other sitter was wrapped up , much as Provis was , and seemed to shrink , and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us . Not a word was spoken in either boat . Startop could make out , after a few minutes , which steamer was first , and gave me the word "
208038	208089	208036	208036	Hamburg	135	" in a low voice , as we sat face to face . She was nearing us very fast , and the beating of her peddles grew louder and louder . I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us , when the galley hailed us . I answered . "
208097	208106	208090	208090	You	4180	" said the man who held the lines . "
208143	209522	209523	209524	Dear boy	3079	" At the same moment , without giving any audible direction to his crew , he ran the galley abroad of us . They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead , had got their oars in , had run athwart us , and were holding on to our gunwale , before we knew what they were doing . This caused great confusion on board the steamer , and I heard them calling to us , and heard the order given to stop the paddles , and heard them stop , but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly . In the same moment , I saw the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner 's shoulder , and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide , and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically . Still , in the same moment , I saw the prisoner start up , lean across his captor , and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley . Still in the same moment , I saw that the face disclosed , was the face of the other convict of long ago . Still , in the same moment , I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that I shall never forget , and heard a great cry on board the steamer , and a loud splash in the water , and felt the boat sink from under me . It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand mill - weirs and a thousand flashes of light ; that instant past , I was taken on board the galley . Herbert was there , and Startop was there ; but our boat was gone , and the two convicts were gone . What with the cries aboard the steamer , and the furious blowing off of her steam , and her driving on , and our driving on , I could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore ; but the crew of the galley righted her with great speed , and , pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead , lay upon their oars , every man looking silently and eagerly at the water astern . Presently a dark object was seen in it , bearing towards us on the tide . No man spoke , but the steersman held up his hand , and all softly backed water , and kept the boat straight and true before it . As it came nearer , I saw it to be Magwitch , swimming , but not swimming freely . He was taken on board , and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles . The galley was kept steady , and the silent , eager look - out at the water was resumed . But , the Rotterdam steamer now came up , and apparently not understanding what had happened , came on at speed . By the time she had been hailed and stopped , both steamers were drifting away from us , and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water . The look - out was kept , long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone ; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now . At length we gave it up , and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left , where we were received with no little surprise . Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch , - Provis no longer , - who had received some very severe injury in the Chest , and a deep cut in the head . He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer , and to have been struck on the head in rising . The injury to his chest which rendered his breathing extremely painful he thought he had received against the side of the galley . He added that he did not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson , but that , in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him , that villain had staggered up and staggered back , and they had both gone overboard together , when the sudden wrenching of him Magwitch out of our boat , and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it , had capsized us . He told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each other 's arms , and that there had been a struggle under water , and that he had disengaged himself , struck out , and swum away . I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me . The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard . When I asked this officer 's permission to change the prisoner 's wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the public - house , he gave it readily : merely observing that he must take charge of everything his prisoner had about him . So the pocket - book which had once been in my hands passed into the officer 's . He further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London ; but declined to accord that grace to my two friends . The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down , and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore . His interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on . Probably , it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely ; and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay . We remained at the public - house until the tide turned , and then Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board . Herbert and Startop were to get to London by land , as soon as they could . We had a doleful parting , and when I took my place by Magwitch 's side , I felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived . For now , my repugnance to him had all melted away ; and in the Hunted , wounded , shackled creature who held my hand in his , I only saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor , and who had felt affectionately , gratefully , and generously , towards me with great constancy through a series of years . I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to Joe . His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on , and often he could not repress a groan . I tried to rest him on the arm I could use , in any easy position ; but it was dreadful to think that I could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt , since it was unquestionably best that he should die . That there were , still living , people enough who were able and willing to identify him , I could not doubt . That he would be leniently treated , I could not hope . He who had been presented in the worst light at his trial , who had since broken prison and had been tried again , who had returned from transportation under a life sentence , and who had occasioned the death of the man who was the cause of his arrest . As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us , and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back , I told him how grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake . "
209526	209530	209523	209524	Dear boy	3079	" he answered , "
209555	209606	209547	209547	he	4554	" No . I had thought about that , while we had been there side by side . No . Apart from any inclinations of my own , I understood Wemmick 's hint now . I foresaw that , being convicted , his possessions would be forfeited to the Crown . "
209613	209616	209547	209547	he	4554	" said he "
209675	209676	209668	209668	I	0	" "
209685	209689	209677	209677	I	0	" said I , "
209716	210007	209700	209700	God	192	" I felt his hand tremble as it held mine , and he turned his face away as he lay in the bottom of the boat , and I heard that old sound in his throat , - softened now , like all the rest of him . It was a good thing that he had touched this point , for it put into my mind what I might not otherwise have thought of until too late , - that he need never know how his hopes of enriching me had perished . Chapter LV He was taken to the Police Court next day , and would have been immediately committed for trial , but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prison - ship from which he had once escaped , to speak to his identity . Nobody doubted it ; but Compeyson , who had meant to depose to it , was tumbling on the tides , dead , and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give the required evidence . I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his private house , on my arrival over night , to retain his assistance , and Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner 's behalf would admit nothing . It was the sole resource ; for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there , and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us . I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the fate of his wealth . Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having "
210015	210403	209700	209700	God	192	" and said we must memorialize by and by , and try at all events for some of it . But he did not conceal from me that , although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted , there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them . I understood that very well . I was not related to the outlaw , or connected with him by any recognizable tie ; he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension , and to do so now would be idle . I had no claim , and I finally resolved , and ever afterwards abided by the resolution , that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one . There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture , and had obtained some accurate knowledge of Magwitch 's affairs . When his body was found , many miles from the scene of his death , and so horribly disfigured that he was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets , notes were still legible , folded in a case he carried . Among these were the name of a banking - house in New South Wales , where a sum of money was , and the designation of certain lands of considerable value . Both these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch , while in prison , gave to Mr. Jaggers , of the possessions he supposed I should inherit . His ignorance , poor fellow , at last served him ; he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe , with Mr. Jaggers 's aid . After three days ' delay , during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prison - ship , the witness came , and completed the easy case . He was committed to take his trial at the next Sessions , which would come on in a month . It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one evening , a good deal cast down , and said , - "
210418	210435	210408	210408	I	0	" His partner having prepared me for that , I was less surprised than he thought . "

Firstly , my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly . Secondly , - Yes ! Secondly , there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative . "

211116	211120	211111	211114	The dear little thing	4201	" returned Herbert , "
211150	211151	211139	211140	Mrs. Whimple	370	" "
211159	211163	211139	211140	Mrs. Whimple	370	" said I , "
211172	211173	211174	211174	I	0	" "
211182	211186	211174	211174	I	0	" said Herbert ; "
211255	211423	211424	211426	The late Compeyson	4217	" On the Saturday in that same week , I took my leave of Herbert , - full of bright hope , but sad and sorry to leave me , - as he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches . I went into a coffee - house to write a little note to Clara , telling her he had gone off , sending his love to her over and over again , and then went to my lonely home , - if it deserved the name ; for it was now no home to me , and I had no home anywhere . On the stairs I encountered Wemmick , who was coming down , after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door . I had not seen him alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight ; and he had come , in his private and personal capacity , to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure . "
211428	211432	211424	211426	The late Compeyson	4217	" said Wemmick , "
211567	211568	211553	211553	I	0	" "
211596	211597	211584	211584	I	0	" "
211612	211620	211622	211622	I	0	" said Wemmick , scratching his head , "
211653	211654	211651	211651	me	0	" "
211670	211671	211663	211668	the poor owner of the property	4224	" "
211678	211682	211663	211668	the poor owner of the property	4224	" said Wemmick . "
211785	211839	211782	211782	you	241	" I invited Wemmick to come up stairs , and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to Walworth . He accepted the invitation . While he was drinking his moderate allowance , he said , with nothing to lead up to it , and after having appeared rather fidgety , - "
211857	211858	211842	211842	you	241	" "
211874	211875	211863	211863	you	241	" "
211883	211887	211863	211863	you	241	" said Wemmick . "
211927	211949	211914	211914	I	0	" I was about to excuse myself , as being but a bad companion just then , when Wemmick anticipated me . "
211955	211959	211952	211952	your	241	" said he , "
212026	212239	212464	212464	Halloa	167	" He had done so much for me at various times , that this was very little to do for him . I said I could manage it , - would manage it , - and he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence , that I was pleased too . At his particular request , I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half past eight on Monday morning , and so we parted for the time . Punctual to my appointment , I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday morning , and was received by Wemmick himself , who struck me as looking tighter than usual , and having a sleeker hat on . Within , there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared , and two biscuits . The Aged must have been stirring with the lark , for , glancing into the perspective of his bedroom , I observed that his bed was empty . When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits , and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us , I was considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing - rod , and put it over his shoulder . "
212248	212251	212464	212464	Halloa	167	" said I. "
212254	212258	212464	212464	Halloa	167	" returned Wemmick , "
212267	212301	212302	212302	Halloa	167	" I thought this odd ; however , I said nothing , and we set off . We went towards Camberwell Green , and when we were thereabouts , Wemmick said suddenly , - "
212309	212341	212302	212302	Halloa	167	" There was nothing very surprising in that ; but again , I was rather surprised , when he said , as if he were animated by a brilliant idea , - "
212347	212389	212390	212390	Halloa	167	" We went in , Wemmick leaving his fishing - rod in the porch , and looked all round . In the mean time , Wemmick was diving into his coat - pockets , and getting something out of paper there . "
212392	212396	212390	212390	Halloa	167	" said he . "
212412	212463	212464	212464	Halloa	167	" As the gloves were white kid gloves , and as the post - office was widened to its utmost extent , I now began to have my strong suspicions . They were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side door , escorting a lady . "
212466	212470	212464	212464	Halloa	167	" said Wemmick . "
212482	212660	212661	212661	Halloa	167	" That discreet damsel was attired as usual , except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white . The Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of Hymen . The old gentleman , however , experienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on , that Wemmick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar , and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them , while I for my part held the old gentleman round the waist , that he might present and equal and safe resistance . By dint of this ingenious scheme , his gloves were got on to perfection . The clerk and clergyman then appearing , we were ranged in order at those fatal rails . True to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation , I heard Wemmick say to himself , as he took something out of his waistcoat - pocket before the service began , "
212668	212745	212661	212661	Halloa	167	" I acted in the capacity of backer , or best - man , to the bridegroom ; while a little limp pew - opener in a soft bonnet like a baby 's , made a feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins . The responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged , which led to the clergyman 's being unintentionally scandalized , and it happened thus . When he said , "
212757	212794	212661	212661	Halloa	167	" the old gentlemen , not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at , stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments . Upon which , the clergyman said again , "
212806	212829	212661	212661	Halloa	167	" The old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness , the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice , "
212839	212855	212859	212859	John	291	" To which the Aged replied with great briskness , before saying that he gave , "
212867	212955	212859	212859	John	291	" And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it , that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day . It was completely done , however , and when we were going out of church Wemmick took the cover off the font , and put his white gloves in it , and put the cover on again . Mrs. Wemmick , more heedful of the future , put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green . "
212961	212976	212978	212978	me	0	" said Wemmick , triumphantly shouldering the fishing - rod as we came out , "
212993	213112	212982	212982	anybody	4526	" Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern , a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green ; and there was a bagatelle board in the room , in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity . It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick 's arm when it adapted itself to her figure , but sat in a high - backed chair against the wall , like a violoncello in its case , and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done . We had an excellent breakfast , and when any one declined anything on table , Wemmick said , "
213127	213182	213218	213218	I	0	" I drank to the new couple , drank to the Aged , drank to the Castle , saluted the bride at parting , and made myself as agreeable as I could . Wemmick came down to the door with me , and I again shook hands with him , and wished him joy . "
213185	213193	213218	213218	I	0	" said Wemmick , rubbing his hands . "
213224	213233	213218	213218	I	0	" calling me back , and speaking low . "
213243	213244	213245	213245	I	0	" "
213256	213262	213245	213245	I	0	" said I. Wemmick nodded . "
213296	214556	213282	213282	He	237	" Chapter LVI He lay in prison very ill , during the whole interval between his committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions . He had broken two ribs , they had wounded one of his lungs , and he breathed with great pain and difficulty , which increased daily . It was a consequence of his hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible ; therefore he spoke very little . But he was ever ready to listen to me ; and it became the first duty of my life to say to him , and read to him , what I knew he ought to hear . Being far too ill to remain in the common prison , he was removed , after the first day or so , into the infirmary . This gave me opportunities of being with him that I could not otherwise have had . And but for his illness he would have been put in irons , for he was regarded as a determined prison - breaker , and I know not what else . Although I saw him every day , it was for only a short time ; hence , the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state . I do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better ; he wasted , and became slowly weaker and worse , day by day , from the day when the prison door closed upon him . The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man who was tired out . I sometimes derived an impression , from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him , that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a better man under better circumstances . But he never justified himself by a hint tending that way , or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape . It happened on two or three occasions in my presence , that his desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him . A smile crossed his face then , and he turned his eyes on me with a trustful look , as if he were confident that I had seen some small redeeming touch in him , even so long ago as when I was a little child . As to all the rest , he was humble and contrite , and I never knew him complain . When the Sessions came round , Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions . It was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long , and was refused . The trial came on at once , and , when he was put to the bar , he was seated in a chair . No objection was made to my getting close to the dock , on the outside of it , and holding the hand that he stretched forth to me . The trial was very short and very clear . Such things as could be said for him were said , - how he had taken to industrious habits , and had thriven lawfully and reputably . But nothing could unsay the fact that he had returned , and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury . It was impossible to try him for that , and do otherwise than find him guilty . At that time , it was the custom as I learnt from my terrible experience of that Sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing of Sentences , and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death . But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me , I could scarcely believe , even as I write these words , that I saw two - and - thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that sentence together . Foremost among the two - and - thirty was he ; seated , that he might get breath enough to keep life in him . The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment , down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court , glittering in the rays of April sun . Penned in the dock , as I again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine , were the two - and - thirty men and women ; some defiant , some stricken with terror , some sobbing and weeping , some covering their faces , some staring gloomily about . There had been shrieks from among the women convicts ; but they had been stilled , and a hush had succeeded . The sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays , other civic gewgaws and monsters , criers , ushers , a great gallery full of people , - a large theatrical audience , - looked on , as the two - and - thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted . Then the Judge addressed them . Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws ; who , after repeated imprisonments and punishments , had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years ; and who , under circumstances of great violence and daring , had made his escape and been re - sentenced to exile for life . That miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors , when far removed from the scenes of his old offences , and to have lived a peaceable and honest life . But in a fatal moment , yielding to those propensities and passions , the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society , he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance , and had come back to the country where he was proscribed . Being here presently denounced , he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of Justice , but being at length seized while in the act of flight , he had resisted them , and had - he best knew whether by express design , or in the blindness of his hardihood - caused the death of his denouncer , to whom his whole career was known . The appointed punishment for his return to the land that had cast him out , being Death , and his case being this aggravated case , he must prepare himself to Die . The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court , through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass , and it made a broad shaft of light between the two - and - thirty and the Judge , linking both together , and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on , with absolute equality , to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things , and can not err . Rising for a moment , a distinct speck of face in this way of light , the prisoner said , "
214577	215263	214572	214572	I	0	" and sat down again . There was some hushing , and the Judge went on with what he had to say to the rest . Then they were all formally doomed , and some of them were supported out , and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery , and a few nodded to the gallery , and two or three shook hands , and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about . He went last of all , because of having to be helped from his chair , and to go very slowly ; and he held my hand while all the others were removed , and while the audience got up putting their dresses right , as they might at church or elsewhere , and pointed down at this criminal or at that , and most of all at him and me . I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder 's Report was made ; but , in the dread of his lingering on , I began that night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State , setting forth my knowledge of him , and how it was that he had come back for my sake . I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could ; and when I had finished it and sent it in , I wrote out other petitions to such men in authority as I hoped were the most merciful , and drew up one to the Crown itself . For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair , but was wholly absorbed in these appeals . And after I had sent them in , I could not keep away from the places where they were , but felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when I was near them . In this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening , wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions . To the present hour , the weary western streets of London on a cold , dusty spring night , with their ranges of stern , shut - up mansions , and their long rows of lamps , are melancholy to me from this association . The daily visits I could make him were shortened now , and he was more strictly kept . Seeing , or fancying , that I was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him , I asked to be searched before I sat down at his bedside , and told the officer who was always there , that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs . Nobody was hard with him or with me . There was duty to be done , and it was done , but not harshly . The officer always gave me the assurance that he was worse , and some other sick prisoners in the room , and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses , malefactors , but not incapable of kindness , God be thanked ! always joined in the same report . As the days went on , I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling , with an absence of light in his face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant , and then it would subside again . Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak , then he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand , and I grew to understand his meaning very well . The number of the days had risen to ten , when I saw a greater change in him than I had seen yet . His eyes were turned towards the door , and lighted up as I entered . "
215267	215279	215264	215265	Dear boy	3079	" he said , as I sat down by his bed : "
215295	215296	215289	215289	you	3079	" "
215303	215306	215307	215307	I	0	" said I. "
215315	215316	215307	215307	I	0	" "
215331	215332	215326	215326	you	3079	" "
215344	215345	215326	215326	you	3079	" "
215365	215387	215356	215356	You	3079	" I pressed his hand in silence , for I could not forget that I had once meant to desert him . "
215396	215400	215401	215401	you	3079	" he said , "
215429	215475	215401	215401	you	3079	" He lay on his back , breathing with great difficulty . Do what he would , and love me though he did , the light left his face ever and again , and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling . "
215485	215486	215401	215401	you	3079	" "
215497	215498	215487	215487	I	0	" "
215504	215586	215487	215487	I	0	" He had spoken his last words . He smiled , and I understood his touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand , and lay it on his breast . I laid it there , and he smiled again , and put both his hands upon it . The allotted time ran out , while we were thus ; but , looking round , I found the governor of the prison standing near me , and he whispered , "
215593	215602	215587	215587	You	3079	" I thanked him gratefully , and asked , "
215615	215658	215610	215610	he	4248	" The governor stepped aside , and beckoned the officer away . The change , though it was made without noise , drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling , and he looked most affectionately at me . "
215677	215685	215674	215674	I	0	" A gentle pressure on my hand . "
215698	215706	215688	215689	a child	691	" A stronger pressure on my hand . "
215733	215849	215729	215729	I	0	" With a last faint effort , which would have been powerless but for my yielding to it and assisting it , he raised my hand to his lips . Then , he gently let it sink upon his breast again , with his own hands lying on it . The placid look at the white ceiling came back , and passed away , and his head dropped quietly on his breast . Mindful , then , of what we had read together , I thought of the two men who went up into the Temple to pray , and I knew there were no better words that I could say beside his bed , than "
215860	216325	215850	215851	O Lord	4252	" Chapter LVII Now that I was left wholly to myself , I gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine , and in the meanwhile to underlet them . At once I put bills up in the windows ; for , I was in debt , and had scarcely any money , and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs . I ought rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that I was falling very ill . The late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness , but not to put it away ; I knew that it was coming on me now , and I knew very little else , and was even careless as to that . For a day or two , I lay on the sofa , or on the floor , - anywhere , according as I happened to sink down , - with a heavy head and aching limbs , and no purpose , and no power . Then there came , one night which appeared of great duration , and which teemed with anxiety and horror ; and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it , I found I could not do so . Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night , groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there ; whether I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror , not knowing how I had got out of bed ; whether I had found myself lighting the lamp , possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs , and that the lights were blown out ; whether I had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking , laughing , and groaning of some one , and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making ; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room , and a voice had called out , over and over again , that Miss Havisham was consuming within it , - these were things that I tried to settle with myself and get into some order , as I lay that morning on my bed . But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them , disordering them all , and it was through the vapor at last that I saw two men looking at me . "
216331	216337	216328	216328	you	4254	" I asked , starting ; "
216344	216345	216338	216338	I	0	" "
216350	216365	216328	216328	you	4254	" returned one of them , bending down and touching me on the shoulder , "
216385	216386	216381	216381	you	4451	" "
216392	216393	216405	216405	Jeweller	4256	" "
216412	216413	216409	216409	I	0	" "
216420	216421	216422	216422	You	4451	" "
216430	216435	216422	216422	You	4451	" said the man . "
216443	216481	216482	216482	You	4259	" I made some attempt to get up and dress myself . When I next attended to them , they were standing a little off from the bed , looking at me . I still lay there . "
216487	216490	216482	216482	You	4259	" said I. "
216523	216998	216514	216514	I	0	" Perhaps they replied , or argued the point , or tried to encourage me to believe that I was better than I thought . Forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread , I do n't know what they did , except that they forbore to remove me . That I had a fever and was avoided , that I suffered greatly , that I often lost my reason , that the time seemed interminable , that I confounded impossible existences with my own identity ; that I was a brick in the house - wall , and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me ; that I was a steel beam of a vast engine , clashing and whirling over a gulf , and yet that I implored in my own person to have the engine stopped , and my part in it hammered off ; that I passed through these phases of disease , I know of my own remembrance , and did in some sort know at the time . That I sometimes struggled with real people , in the belief that they were murderers , and that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good , and would then sink exhausted in their arms , and suffer them to lay me down , I also knew at the time . But , above all , I knew that there was a constant tendency in all these people , - who , when I was very ill , would present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face , and would be much dilated in size , - above all , I say , I knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people , sooner or later , to settle down into the likeness of Joe . After I had turned the worst point of my illness , I began to notice that while all its other features changed , this one consistent feature did not change . Whoever came about me , still settled down into Joe . I opened my eyes in the night , and I saw , in the great chair at the bedside , Joe . I opened my eyes in the day , and , sitting on the window - seat , smoking his pipe in the shaded open window , still I saw Joe . I asked for cooling drink , and the dear hand that gave it me was Joe 's . I sank back on my pillow after drinking , and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe . At last , one day , I took courage , and said , "
217003	217013	217001	217001	Joe	154	" And the dear old home - voice answered , "
217021	217022	217018	217019	old chap	4500	" "
217057	217089	217095	217096	old chap	4500	" For Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side , and put his arm round my neck , in his joy that I knew him . "

217126	217170	217174	217174	him	241	" After which , Joe withdrew to the window , and stood with his back towards me , wiping his eyes . And as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him , I lay there , penitently whispering , "
217184	217211	217215	217216	dear Joe	154	" Joe 's eyes were red when I next found him beside me ; but I was holding his hand , and we both felt happy . "
217218	217219	217215	217216	dear Joe	154	" "
217237	217238	217241	217241	Joe	154	" "

217352	217353	217349	217350	his hart	4768	" "
217375	217376	217370	217370	you	241	" "
217381	217385	217370	217370	you	241	" said Joe , "
217436	217447	217417	217417	Biddy	188	" said Joe , summing up with his judicial air , "
217480	217490	217473	217473	I	0	" Joe added , after a little grave reflection , "
217515	217983	217500	217502	that young woman	4271	" There Joe cut himself short , and informed me that I was to be talked to in great moderation , and that I was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times , whether I felt inclined for it or not , and that I was to submit myself to all his orders . So I kissed his hand , and lay quiet , while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy , with my love in it . Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write . As I lay in bed looking at him , it made me , in my weak state , cry again with pleasure to see the pride with which he set about his letter . My bedstead , divested of its curtains , had been removed , with me upon it , into the sitting - room , as the airiest and largest , and the carpet had been taken away , and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day . At my own writing - table , pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles , Joe now sat down to his great work , first choosing a pen from the pen - tray as if it were a chest of large tools , and tucking up his sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow - bar or sledgehammer . It was necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow , and to get his right leg well out behind him , before he could begin ; and when he did begin he made every down - stroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long , while at every up - stroke I could hear his pen spluttering extensively . He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not , and constantly dipped his pen into space , and seemed quite satisfied with the result . Occasionally , he was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling - block ; but on the whole he got on very well indeed ; and when he had signed his name , and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with his two forefingers , he got up and hovered about the table , trying the effect of his performance from various points of view , as it lay there , with unbounded satisfaction . Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much , even if I had been able to talk much , I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day . He shook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered . "
217990	217991	217988	217988	Joe	154	" "
217999	218019	217993	217993	you	4273	" said Joe , in a tone of remonstrance , and by way of getting at it by degrees , "
218044	218045	218040	218040	she	4272	" "
218050	218051	218048	218048	Joe	154	" "
218059	218069	218048	218048	Joe	154	" said Joe ; ' she ai n't living . "
218070	218078	218048	218048	Joe	154	" Did she linger long , Joe ? "
218079	218102	218104	218104	Joe	154	" Arter you was took ill , pretty much about what you might call if you was put to it a week , "
218120	218133	218104	218104	Joe	154	" Dear Joe , have you heard what becomes of her property ? "
218134	218140	218142	218142	Joe	154	" Well , old chap , "
218144	218245	218247	218247	Joe	154	" it do appear that she had settled the most of it , which I meantersay tied it up , on Miss Estella . But she had wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the accident , leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket . And why , do you suppose , above all things , Pip , she left that cool four thousand unto him ? ' Because of Pip 's account of him , the said Matthew . ' I am told by Biddy , that air the writing , "
218261	218279	218247	218247	Joe	154	" ' account of him the said Matthew . ' And a cool four thousand , Pip ! "
218357	218361	218363	218363	Joe	154	" Miss Sarah , "
218409	218410	218411	218411	Camels	4279	" "
218413	218429	218430	218431	Mrs. Camels	393	" said I , wondering why he could possibly want to know . Joe nodded . "
218433	218465	218430	218431	Mrs. Camels	393	" by which I presently understood he meant Camilla , ' she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in spirits when she wake up in the night . "
218487	218491	218493	218493	Joe	154	" And now , "
218495	218534	218493	218493	Joe	154	" you ai n't that strong yet , old chap , that you can take in more nor one additional shovelful to - day . Old Orlick he 's been a bustin ' open a dwelling - ouse . "
218535	218538	218540	218540	I.	0	" Whose ? "
218541	218557	218559	218559	Joe	154	" Not , I grant you , but what his manners is given to blusterous , "
218606	218607	218598	218601	a corn and seedsman	4283	" "
218621	218622	218610	218610	Pumblechook	176	" "
218629	218633	218627	218627	Pip	241	" said Joe ; "
218718	218869	218706	218706	he	4280	" By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation . I was slow to gain strength , but I did slowly and surely become less weak , and Joe stayed with me , and I fancied I was little Pip again . For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need , that I was like a child in his hands . He would sit and talk to me in the old confidence , and with the old simplicity , and in the old unassertive protecting way , so that I would half believe that all my life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone . He did everything for me except the household work , for which he had engaged a very decent woman , after paying off the laundress on his first arrival . "
218878	218890	218871	218871	I	0	" he would often say , in explanation of that liberty ; "
218966	219435	218919	218919	she	4289	" We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride , as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship . And when the day came , and an open carriage was got into the Lane , Joe wrapped me up , took me in his arms , carried me down to it , and put me in , as if I were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature . And Joe got in beside me , and we drove away together into the country , where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass , and sweet summer scents filled all the air . The day happened to be Sunday , and when I looked on the loveliness around me , and thought how it had grown and changed , and how the little wild - flowers had been forming , and the voices of the birds had been strengthening , by day and by night , under the sun and under the stars , while poor I lay burning and tossing on my bed , the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace . But when I heard the Sunday bells , and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty , I felt that I was not nearly thankful enough , - that I was too weak yet to be even that , - and I laid my head on Joe 's shoulder , as I had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not , and it was too much for my young senses . More composure came to me after a while , and we talked as we used to talk , lying on the grass at the old Battery . There was no change whatever in Joe . Exactly what he had been in my eyes then , he was in my eyes still ; just as simply faithful , and as simply right . When we got back again , and he lifted me out , and carried me - so easily ! - across the court and up the stairs , I thought of that eventful Christmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes . We had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune , nor did I know how much of my late history he was acquainted with . I was so doubtful of myself now , and put so much trust in him , that I could not satisfy myself whether I ought to refer to it when he did not . "
219442	219462	219437	219437	you	4291	" I asked him that evening , upon further consideration , as he smoked his pipe at the window , "
219468	219469	219470	219470	I	0	" "
219473	219477	219470	219470	I	0	" returned Joe , "
219488	219489	219482	219483	Miss Havisham	223	" "
219499	219500	219497	219497	Joe	154	" "
219529	219530	219527	219527	Pip	241	" "
219535	219536	219527	219527	Pip	241	" "
219539	219548	219527	219527	Pip	241	" said Joe , in the placidest way . "
219559	219568	219550	219550	you	154	" I presently asked , with increasing diffidence . "
219581	219582	219579	219579	Pip	241	" "
219585	219586	219579	219579	Pip	241	" "
219590	219610	219579	219579	Pip	241	" said Joe , after meditating a long time , and looking rather evasively at the window - seat , "
219631	219632	219612	219612	I	0	" "
219643	219644	219641	219641	Joe	154	" "
219650	219651	219648	219648	Pip	241	" "
219661	219676	219659	219659	Joe	154	" I was beginning , when Joe got up and came to my sofa . "
219683	219691	219680	219681	old chap	4500	" said Joe , bending over me . "
219704	219712	219713	219713	Wery	4300	" I was ashamed to answer him . "
219718	219728	219713	219713	Wery	4300	" said Joe , as if I had answered ; "
219791	219792	219793	219793	I	0	" "
219799	219800	219797	219797	Joe	154	" "
219807	219811	219804	219805	old chap	4500	" said Joe . "
219856	219866	219868	219868	she	6149	" said Joe , in his favorite argumentative way , "
220019	220020	220021	220022	The man	433	" "
220025	220037	220038	220039	The man	433	" I observed , as Joe waited for me to speak . "
220042	220046	220038	220039	The man	433	" Joe assented . "
220054	220055	220048	220048	he	433	" "
220064	220065	220059	220059	he	433	" "
220071	220075	220068	220069	old chap	4500	" said Joe , "
220220	220231	220210	220210	I	0	" said Joe , quite charmed with his logical arrangement , "
220277	220432	220436	220437	old chap	4500	" The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme , and the sweet tact and kindness with which Biddy - who with her woman 's wit had found me out so soon - had prepared him for it , made a deep impression on my mind . But whether Joe knew how poor I was , and how my great expectations had all dissolved , like our own marsh mists before the sun , I could not understand . Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself , but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of , was this : As I became stronger and better , Joe became a little less easy with me . In my weakness and entire dependence on him , the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone , and called me by the old names , the dear "
220439	220655	220436	220437	old chap	4500	" that now were music in my ears . I too had fallen into the old ways , only happy and thankful that he let me . But , imperceptibly , though I held by them fast , Joe 's hold upon them began to slacken ; and whereas I wondered at this , at first , I soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me , and that the fault of it was all mine . Ah ! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy , and to think that in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off ? Had I given Joe 's innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got stronger , his hold upon me would be weaker , and that he had better loosen it in time and let me go , before I plucked myself away ? It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the Temple Gardens leaning on Joe 's arm , that I saw this change in him very plainly . We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight , looking at the river , and I chanced to say as we got up , - "
220677	220678	220668	220668	you	154	" "
220687	220691	220685	220685	Pip	241	" said Joe ; "
220705	221019	221020	221020	I	0	" The last word grated on me ; but how could I remonstrate ! I walked no further than the gate of the gardens , and then pretended to be weaker than I was , and asked Joe for his arm . Joe gave it me , but was thoughtful . I , for my part , was thoughtful too ; for , how best to check this growing change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts . That I was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed , and what I had come down to , I do not seek to conceal ; but I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one . He would want to help me out of his little savings , I knew , and I knew that he ought not to help me , and that I must not suffer him to do it . It was a thoughtful evening with both of us . But , before we went to bed , I had resolved that I would wait over to - morrow , - to - morrow being Sunday , - and would begin my new course with the new week . On Monday morning I would speak to Joe about this change , I would lay aside this last vestige of reserve , I would tell him what I had in my thoughts that Secondly , not yet arrived at , and why I had not decided to go out to Herbert , and then the change would be conquered for ever . As I cleared , Joe cleared , and it seemed as though he had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too . We had a quiet day on the Sunday , and we rode out into the country , and then walked in the fields . "
221031	221035	221029	221029	Joe	154	" I said . "
221051	221052	221049	221049	sir	4451	" "
221064	221065	221062	221062	Joe	154	" "
221072	221076	221070	221070	sir	4451	" Joe returned . "
221115	221116	221117	221117	Pip	241	" "
221119	221130	221117	221117	Pip	241	" said Joe , appearing a little hurried and troubled , "
221150	221193	221217	221218	dear Joe	154	" At night , when I had gone to bed , Joe came into my room , as he had done all through my recovery . He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning ? "
221201	221202	221217	221218	dear Joe	154	" "
221213	221214	221217	221218	dear Joe	154	" "
221222	221247	221217	221218	dear Joe	154	" Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand , and said , in what I thought a husky voice , "
221251	221361	221217	221218	dear Joe	154	" When I got up in the morning , refreshed and stronger yet , I was full of my resolution to tell Joe all , without delay . I would tell him before breakfast . I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him ; for , it was the first day I had been up early . I went to his room , and he was not there . Not only was he not there , but his box was gone . I hurried then to the breakfast - table , and on it found a letter . These were its brief contents : - "
221383	221391	221381	221381	JO	154	" P.S. Ever the best of friends . "
221589	221827	221583	221583	I	0	" Biddy , I think you once liked me very well , when my errant heart , even while it strayed away from you , was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since . If you can like me only half as well once more , if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head , if you can receive me like a forgiven child and indeed I am as sorry , Biddy , and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand , I hope I am a little worthier of you that I was , - not much , but a little . And , Biddy , it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe , or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in this country , or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which I set aside , when it was offered , until I knew your answer . And now , dear Biddy , if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me , you will surely make it a better world for me , and me a better man for it , and I will try hard to make it a better world for you . "
222322	222348	222350	222350	he	176	" Young man , I am sorry to see you brought low . But what else could be expected ! what else could be expected ! "
222376	222379	222381	222382	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" William , "
222387	222407	222408	222408	I	0	" put a muffin on table . And has it come to this ! Has it come to this ! "
222450	222453	222455	222456	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" William , "
222460	222470	222455	222456	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" put the salt on . In happier times , "
222474	222500	222455	222456	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" I think you took sugar ? And did you take milk ? You did . Sugar and milk . William , bring a watercress . "
222501	222505	222507	222507	I	0	" Thank you , "
222511	222519	222507	222507	I	0	" but I do n't eat watercresses . "
222520	222527	222529	222530	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" You do n't eat 'em , "
222560	222580	222581	222581	I	0	" True . The simple fruits of the earth . No . You need n't bring any , William . "
222608	222616	222604	222604	he	176	" Little more than skin and bone ! "
222623	222659	222618	222619	Mr. Pumblechook	176	" And yet when he went from here I may say with my blessing , and I spread afore him my humble store , like the Bee , he was as plump as a Peach ! "
222685	222689	222673	222673	he	176	" May I ? "
222707	222710	222711	222711	he	176	" Hah ! "

222748	222765	222740	222740	I	0	" what does it matter to you where I am going ? Leave that teapot alone . "
222785	222791	222793	222793	he	176	" Yes , young man , "
222827	222890	222892	222892	Pumblechook	176	" I will leave that teapot alone . You are right , young man . For once you are right . I forgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast , as to wish your frame , exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality , to be stimilated by the ' olesome nourishment of your forefathers . And yet , "
222910	222941	222946	222947	the two	856	" this is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy infancy ! Tell me not it can not be ; I tell you this is him ! "

222967	223023	222965	222965	Pumblechook	176	" as I have rode in my shay - cart . This is him as I have seen brought up by hand . This is him untoe the sister of which I was uncle by marriage , as her name was Georgiana M'ria from her own mother , let him deny it if he can ! "
223045	223049	223051	223051	Pumblechook	176	" Young man , "

223321	223324	223316	223316	you	0	" said I. "

223334	223339	223332	223332	you	0	" Pumblechook went on , "
223405	223416	223403	223403	you	0	" here Pumblechook shook his head and hand at me , "
223459	223482	223484	223484	you	0	" Windy donkey as he was , it really amazed me that he could have the face to talk thus to mine . "
223605	223606	223557	223558	that man	6907	" "
223611	223624	223557	223558	that man	6907	" said I , scornfully , as I finished my interrupted breakfast , "
223640	223641	223632	223632	he	6907	" "
223647	223655	223657	223657	William	394	" Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord , "
223707	223743	223701	223701	I	0	" With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand , with an air , and left the house ; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite "
223746	224381	223701	223701	I	0	" I was not long after him in leaving the house too , and when I went down the High Street I saw him holding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a select group , who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the way . But , it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe , whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before , if that could be , contrasted with this brazen pretender . I went towards them slowly , for my limbs were weak , but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew nearer to them , and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind . The June weather was delicious . The sky was blue , the larks were soaring high over the green corn , I thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet . Many pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there , and of the change for the better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved , beguiled my way . They awakened a tender emotion in me ; for my heart was softened by my return , and such a change had come to pass , that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel , and whose wanderings had lasted many years . The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen ; but , the little roundabout lane by which I entered the village , for quietness ' sake , took me past it . I was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday ; no children were there , and Biddy 's house was closed . Some hopeful notion of seeing her , busily engaged in her daily duties , before she saw me , had been in my mind and was defeated . But the forge was a very short distance off , and I went towards it under the sweet green limes , listening for the clink of Joe 's hammer . Long after I ought to have heard it , and long after I had fancied I heard it and found it but a fancy , all was still . The limes were there , and the white thorns were there , and the chestnut - trees were there , and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen ; but , the clink of Joe 's hammer was not in the midsummer wind . Almost fearing , without knowing why , to come in view of the forge , I saw it at last , and saw that it was closed . No gleam of fire , no glittering shower of sparks , no roar of bellows ; all shut up , and still . But the house was not deserted , and the best parlor seemed to be in use , for there were white curtains fluttering in its window , and the window was open and gay with flowers . I went softly towards it , meaning to peep over the flowers , when Joe and Biddy stood before me , arm in arm . At first Biddy gave a cry , as if she thought it was my apparition , but in another moment she was in my embrace . I wept to see her , and she wept to see me ; I , because she looked so fresh and pleasant ; she , because I looked so worn and white . "
224391	224392	224383	224384	dear Biddy	188	" "
224398	224399	224383	224384	dear Biddy	188	" "
224408	224409	224401	224401	Joe	154	" "
224419	224436	224416	224417	old chap	4500	" I looked at both of them , from one to the other , and then - "
224444	224454	224416	224417	old chap	4500	" cried Biddy , in a burst of happiness , "
224462	224504	224506	224506	he	4500	" They had taken me into the kitchen , and I had laid my head down on the old deal table . Biddy held one of my hands to her lips , and Joe 's restoring touch was on my shoulder . "
224519	224527	224528	224528	I	0	" said Joe . And Biddy said , "
224545	224643	224540	224540	I	0	" They were both so overjoyed to see me , so proud to see me , so touched by my coming to them , so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day complete ! My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed this last baffled hope to Joe . How often , while he was with me in my illness , had it risen to my lips ! How irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it , if he had remained with me but another hour ! "
224647	224651	224652	224652	you	188	" said I , "
224689	224690	224679	224679	you	188	" "
224698	224702	224693	224693	I	0	" said Biddy . "
224740	224759	224719	224719	she	4399	" Joe looked at me with a quivering lip , and fairly put his sleeve before his eyes . "
224900	224918	224920	224920	I	0	" They were both melted by these words , and both entreated me to say no more . "
225039	225040	225020	225020	I	0	" "
225047	225056	225041	225041	I	0	" said Joe , from behind his sleeve , "
225080	225081	225075	225078	no one ai n't	4410	" "
225157	225158	225164	225165	old chap	4500	" "
225167	225171	225162	225162	Pip	241	" said Joe . "
225186	225187	225191	225191	God	192	" "
225196	225200	225191	225191	God	192	" echoed Biddy . "
225257	225747	225748	225748	We	4415	" I sold all I had , and put aside as much as I could , for a composition with my creditors , - who gave me ample time to pay them in full , - and I went out and joined Herbert . Within a month , I had quitted England , and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co. , and within four months I assumed my first undivided responsibility . For the beam across the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under old Bill Barley 's growls and was at peace , and Herbert had gone away to marry Clara , and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until he brought her back . Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House ; but I lived happily with Herbert and his wife , and lived frugally , and paid my debts , and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe . It was not until I became third in the Firm , that Clarriker betrayed me to Herbert ; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert 's partnership had been long enough upon his conscience , and he must tell it . So he told it , and Herbert was as much moved as amazed , and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment . I must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House , or that we made mints of money . We were not in a grand way of business , but we had a good name , and worked for our profits , and did very well . We owed so much to Herbert 's ever cheerful industry and readiness , that I often wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude , until I was one day enlightened by the reflection , that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all , but had been in me . Chapter LIX For eleven years , I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily Eyes , - though they had both been often before my fancy in the East , - when , upon an evening in December , an hour or two after dark , I laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door . I touched it so softly that I was not heard , and looked in unseen . There , smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight , as hale and as strong as ever , though a little gray , sat Joe ; and there , fenced into the corner with Joe 's leg , and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire , was - I again ! "
225764	225788	225748	225748	We	4415	" said Joe , delighted , when I took another stool by the child 's side but I did not rumple his hair , "
225807	225885	225886	225886	Biddy	188	" I thought so too , and I took him out for a walk next morning , and we talked immensely , understanding one another to perfection . And I took him down to the churchyard , and set him on a certain tombstone there , and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of Philip Pirrip , late of this Parish , and Also Georgiana , Wife of the Above . "
225888	225910	225886	225886	Biddy	188	" said I , when I talked with her after dinner , as her little girl lay sleeping in her lap , "
225930	225931	225886	225886	Biddy	188	" "
225936	225942	225886	225886	Biddy	188	" said Biddy , gently . "
225947	225948	225886	225886	Biddy	188	" "
225990	226051	225986	225988	an old bachelor	4421	" Biddy looked down at her child , and put its little hand to her lips , and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine . There was something in the action , and in the light pressure of Biddy 's wedding - ring , that had a very pretty eloquence in it . "
226055	226059	226052	226053	Dear Pip	241	" said Biddy , "
226070	226071	226063	226063	you	241	" "
226082	226083	226080	226080	Biddy	188	" "
226099	226153	226094	226094	you	188	" My dear Biddy , I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a foremost place there , and little that ever had any place there . But that poor dream , as I once used to call it , has all gone by , Biddy , - all gone by ! "
226612	226615	226607	226607	I	0	" Estella ! "
226616	226628	226607	226607	I	0	" I am greatly changed . I wonder you know me . "
226707	226738	226704	226704	I	0	" After so many years , it is strange that we should thus meet again , Estella , here where our first meeting was ! Do you often come back ? "
226739	226747	226704	226704	I	0	" I have never been here since . "
226748	226751	226704	226704	I	0	" Nor I. "
226816	226842	226803	226803	Estella	195	" I have very often hoped and intended to come back , but have been prevented by many circumstances . Poor , poor old place ! "
226891	226911	226886	226886	she	195	" Were you wondering , as you walked along , how it came to be left in this condition ? "
226912	226917	226886	226886	she	195	" Yes , Estella . "
226918	226969	226886	226886	she	195	" The ground belongs to me . It is the only possession I have not relinquished . Everything else has gone from me , little by little , but I have kept this . It was the subject of the only determined resistance I made in all the wretched years . "
226970	226978	226886	226886	she	195	" Is it to be built on ? "
226979	227001	227002	227002	she	195	" At last , it is . I came here to take leave of it before its change . And you , "
227016	227022	227002	227002	she	195	" you live abroad still ? "
227023	227026	226886	226886	she	195	" Still . "
227027	227036	226886	226886	she	195	" And do well , I am sure ? "
227037	227056	226886	226886	she	195	" I work pretty hard for a sufficient living , and therefore - yes , I do well . "
227057	227065	227067	227067	Estella	195	" I have often thought of you , "
227069	227073	227002	227002	she	195	" Have you ? "
227074	227135	226886	226886	she	195	" Of late , very often . There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth . But since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance , I have given it a place in my heart . "
227136	227147	227148	227148	I	0	" You have always held your place in my heart , "
227160	227165	227167	227167	Estella	195	" I little thought , "
227169	227192	227167	227167	Estella	195	" that I should take leave of you in taking leave of this spot . I am very glad to do so . "
227193	227226	226886	226886	she	195	" Glad to part again , Estella ? To me , parting is a painful thing . To me , the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful . "
227227	227234	227236	227236	Estella	195	" But you said to me , "
227241	227334	227236	227236	Estella	195	" ' God bless you , God forgive you ! ' And if you could say that to me then , you will not hesitate to say that to me now , - now , when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching , and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be . I have been bent and broken , but - I hope - into a better shape . Be as considerate and good to me as you were , and tell me we are friends . "
227335	227340	227342	227342	I	0	" We are friends , "
227357	227364	227366	227366	Estella	195	" And will continue friends apart , "
