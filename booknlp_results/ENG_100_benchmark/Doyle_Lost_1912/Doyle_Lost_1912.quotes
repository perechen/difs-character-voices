179	208	173	173	he	133	" that all the debts in the world were called up simultaneously , and immediate payment insisted upon , - what under our present conditions would happen then ? "
662	693	694	694	I	0	" I have a presentiment that you are going to propose , Ned . I do wish you would n't ; for things are so much nicer as they are . "
702	716	717	717	I	0	" Now , how did you know that I was going to propose ? "
723	795	717	717	I	0	" Do n't women always know ? Do you suppose any woman in the world was ever taken unawares ? But - oh , Ned , our friendship has been so good and so pleasant ! What a pity to spoil it ! Do n't you feel how splendid it is that a young man and a young woman should be able to talk face to face as we have talked ? "
796	821	822	822	I	0	" I do n't know , Gladys . You see , I can talk face to face with - with the station - master . "
845	879	836	836	he	277	" That does not satisfy me in the least . I want my arms round you , and your head on my breast , and - oh , Gladys , I want - - "
901	909	910	910	she	279	" You 've spoiled everything , Ned , "
913	942	910	910	she	279	" It 's all so beautiful and natural until this kind of thing comes in ! It is such a pity ! Why ca n't you control yourself ? "
943	950	951	951	I	0	" I did n't invent it , "
954	963	951	951	I	0	" It 's nature . It 's love . "
964	983	1049	1049	She	279	" Well , perhaps if both love , it may be different . I have never felt it . "
984	1013	951	951	I	0	" But you must - you , with your beauty , with your soul ! Oh , Gladys , you were made for love ! You must love ! "
1014	1022	1049	1049	She	279	" One must wait till it comes . "
1023	1042	951	951	I	0	" But why ca n't you love me , Gladys ? Is it my appearance , or what ? "
1084	1091	1092	1092	she	279	" No it is n't that , "
1097	1123	1092	1092	she	279	" You 're not a conceited boy by nature , and so I can safely tell you it is not that . It 's deeper . "
1124	1128	1072	1072	she	279	" My character ? "
1133	1164	1165	1165	She	279	" What can I do to mend it ? Do sit down and talk it over . No , really , I wo n't if you 'll only sit down ! "
1223	1233	1219	1219	she	279	" Now tell me what 's amiss with me ? "
1234	1243	1245	1245	she	279	" I 'm in love with somebody else , "
1258	1265	1266	1266	she	279	" It 's nobody in particular , "
1277	1293	1266	1266	she	279	" only an ideal . I 've never met the kind of man I mean . "
1294	1306	1266	1266	she	279	" Tell me about him . What does he look like ? "
1307	1318	1266	1266	she	279	" Oh , he might look very much like you . "
1319	1381	1266	1266	she	279	" How dear of you to say that ! Well , what is it that he does that I do n't do ? Just say the word , - teetotal , vegetarian , aeronaut , theosophist , superman . I 'll have a try at it , Gladys , if you will only give me an idea what would please you . "
1391	1410	1412	1412	she	279	" Well , in the first place , I do n't think my ideal would speak like that , "
1414	1588	1412	1412	she	279	" He would be a harder , sterner man , not so ready to adapt himself to a silly girl 's whim . But , above all , he must be a man who could do , who could act , who could look Death in the face and have no fear of him , a man of great deeds and strange experiences . It is never a man that I should love , but always the glories he had won ; for they would be reflected upon me . Think of Richard Burton ! When I read his wife 's life of him I could so understand her love ! And Lady Stanley ! Did you ever read the wonderful last chapter of that book about her husband ? These are the sort of men that a woman could worship with all her soul , and yet be the greater , not the less , on account of her love , honored by all the world as the inspirer of noble deeds . "
1620	1630	1632	1632	I	0	" We ca n't all be Stanleys and Burtons , "
1634	1665	1632	1632	I	0	" besides , we do n't get the chance , - at least , I never had the chance . If I did , I should try to take it . "
1666	1844	1589	1589	She	280	" But chances are all around you . It is the mark of the kind of man I mean that he makes his own chances . You ca n't hold him back . I 've never met him , and yet I seem to know him so well . There are heroisms all round us waiting to be done . It 's for men to do them , and for women to reserve their love as a reward for such men . Look at that young Frenchman who went up last week in a balloon . It was blowing a gale of wind ; but because he was announced to go he insisted on starting . The wind blew him fifteen hundred miles in twenty - four hours , and he fell in the middle of Russia . That was the kind of man I mean . Think of the woman he loved , and how other women must have envied her ! That 's what I should like to be , - envied for my man . "
1845	1855	1632	1632	I	0	" I 'd have done it to please you . "
1856	1929	1589	1589	She	280	" But you should n't do it merely to please me . You should do it because you ca n't help yourself , because it 's natural to you , because the man in you is crying out for heroic expression . Now , when you described the Wigan coal explosion last month , could you not have gone down and helped those people , in spite of the choke - damp ? "
1930	1934	1632	1632	I	0	" I did . "
1935	1941	1589	1589	She	280	" You never said so . "
1942	1950	1632	1632	I	0	" There was nothing worth bucking about . "
1951	1957	1958	1958	She	281	" I did n't know . "
1967	1974	1958	1958	She	281	" That was brave of you . "
1975	1996	1632	1632	I	0	" I had to . If you want to write good copy , you must be where the things are . "
1997	2032	2033	2033	She	281	" What a prosaic motive ! It seems to take all the romance out of it . But , still , whatever your motive , I am glad that you went down that mine . "
2054	2110	2033	2033	She	281	" I dare say I am merely a foolish woman with a young girl 's fancies . And yet it is so real with me , so entirely part of my very self , that I can not help acting upon it . If I marry , I do want to marry a famous man ! "
2111	2117	2118	2118	I	0	" Why should you not ? "
2121	2192	2118	2118	I	0	" It is women like you who brace men up . Give me a chance , and see if I will take it ! Besides , as you say , men ought to MAKE their own chances , and not wait until they are given . Look at Clive - just a clerk , and he conquered India ! By George ! I 'll do something in the world yet ! "
2201	2205	2206	2206	she	282	" Why not ? "
2209	2252	2206	2206	she	282	" You have everything a man could have , - youth , health , strength , education , energy . I was sorry you spoke . And now I am glad - so glad - if it wakens these thoughts in you ! "
2253	2260	2261	2261	Her	282	" And if I do - - "
2272	2326	2261	2261	Her	282	" Not another word , Sir ! You should have been at the office for evening duty half an hour ago ; only I had n't the heart to remind you . Some day , perhaps , when you have won your place in the world , we shall talk it over again . "
2617	2624	2625	2625	I	0	" Try Your Luck with Professor Challenger "
2766	2785	2787	2787	he	299	" Well , Mr. Malone , from all I hear , you seem to be doing very well , "
2798	2827	2794	2794	I	0	" The colliery explosion was excellent . So was the Southwark fire . You have the true descreeptive touch . What did you want to see me about ? "
2828	2834	2835	2835	He	299	" To ask a favor . "
2845	2854	2835	2835	He	299	" Tut , tut ! What is it ? "
2855	2891	2794	2794	I	0	" Do you think , Sir , that you could possibly send me on some mission for the paper ? I would do my best to put it through and get you some good copy . "
2892	2906	2835	2835	He	299	" What sort of meesion had you in your mind , Mr. Malone ? "
2907	2942	2794	2794	I	0	" Well , Sir , anything that had adventure and danger in it . I really would do my very best . The more difficult it was , the better it would suit me . "
2943	2953	2835	2835	He	299	" You seem very anxious to lose your life . "
2954	2962	2794	2794	I	0	" To justify my life , Sir . "
2963	3063	3064	3064	he	301	" Dear me , Mr. Malone , this is very - very exalted . I 'm afraid the day for this sort of thing is rather past . The expense of the ' special meesion ' business hardly justifies the result , and , of course , in any case it would only be an experienced man with a name that would command public confidence who would get such an order . The big blank spaces in the map are all being filled in , and there 's no room for romance anywhere . Wait a bit , though ! "
3075	3132	3064	3064	he	301	" Talking of the blank spaces of the map gives me an idea . What about exposing a fraud - a modern Munchausen - and making him rideeculous ? You could show him up as the liar that he is ! Eh , man , it would be fine . How does it appeal to you ? "
3133	3142	3286	3288	The news editor	302	" Anything - anywhere - I care nothing . "
3152	3172	3173	3173	he	301	" I wonder whether you could get on friendly - or at least on talking terms with the fellow , "
3179	3217	3173	3173	he	301	" You seem to have a sort of genius for establishing relations with people - seempathy , I suppose , or animal magnetism , or youthful vitality , or something . I am conscious of it myself . "
3218	3226	3286	3288	The news editor	302	" You are very good , sir . "
3227	3244	3173	3173	he	301	" So why should you not try your luck with Professor Challenger , of Enmore Park ? "
3254	3257	3258	3258	I	0	" Challenger ! "
3261	3285	3258	3258	I	0	" Professor Challenger , the famous zoologist ! Was n't he the man who broke the skull of Blundell , of the Telegraph ? "
3292	3308	3286	3288	The news editor	302	" Do you mind ? Did n't you say it was adventures you were after ? "
3309	3321	3322	3322	I	0	" It is all in the way of business , sir , "
3325	3393	3286	3288	The news editor	302	" Exactly . I do n't suppose he can always be so violent as that . I 'm thinking that Blundell got him at the wrong moment , maybe , or in the wrong fashion . You may have better luck , or more tact in handling him . There 's something in your line there , I am sure , and the Gazette should work it . "
3394	3402	3404	3404	I.	0	" I really know nothing about him , "
3405	3424	3404	3404	I.	0	" I only remember his name in connection with the police - court proceedings , for striking Blundell . "
3425	3451	3452	3452	He	303	" I have a few notes for your guidance , Mr. Malone . I 've had my eye on the Professor for some little time . "
3460	3475	3452	3452	He	303	" Here is a summary of his record . I give it you briefly : -
3476	3592	3286	3288	The news editor	302	" ' Challenger , George Edward . Born : Largs , N. B. , 1863 . Educ . : Largs Academy ; Edinburgh University . British Museum Assistant , 1892 . Assistant - Keeper of Comparative Anthropology Department , 1893 . Resigned after acrimonious correspondence same year . Winner of Crayston Medal for Zoological Research . Foreign Member of ' - well , quite a lot of things , about two inches of small type - ' Societe Belge , American Academy of Sciences , La Plata , etc . , etc . Ex - President Palaeontological Society . Section H , British Association ' - so on , so on ! - ' Publications : "
3601	3603	3452	3452	He	303	" ; "
3608	3615	3452	3452	He	303	" ; and numerous papers , including "
3622	3649	3452	3452	He	303	" which caused heated discussion at the Zoological Congress of Vienna . Recreations : Walking , Alpine climbing . Address : Enmore Park , Kensington , W. '
3650	3668	3452	3452	He	303	" There , take it with you . I 've nothing more for you to - night . "
3676	3682	3683	3683	I	0	" One moment , sir , "
3708	3728	3683	3683	I	0	" I am not very clear yet why I am to interview this gentleman . What has he done ? "
3735	3902	3687	3687	I	0	" Went to South America on a solitary expedeetion two years ago . Came back last year . Had undoubtedly been to South America , but refused to say exactly where . Began to tell his adventures in a vague way , but somebody started to pick holes , and he just shut up like an oyster . Something wonderful happened - or the man 's a champion liar , which is the more probable supposeetion . Had some damaged photographs , said to be fakes . Got so touchy that he assaults anyone who asks questions , and heaves reporters down the stairs . In my opinion he 's just a homicidal megalomaniac with a turn for science . That 's your man , Mr. Malone . Now , off you run , and see what you can make of him . You 're big enough to look after yourself . Anyway , you are all safe . Employers ' Liability Act , you know . "
4185	4194	4178	4178	I	0	" What do you know of Professor Challenger ? "
4195	4198	4199	4199	He	311	" Challenger ? "
4207	4226	4199	4199	He	311	" Challenger was the man who came with some cock - and - bull story from South America . "
4227	4231	4178	4178	I	0	" What story ? "
4232	4311	4199	4199	He	311	" Oh , it was rank nonsense about some queer animals he had discovered . I believe he has retracted since . Anyhow , he has suppressed it all . He gave an interview to Reuter 's , and there was such a howl that he saw it would n't do . It was a discreditable business . There were one or two folk who were inclined to take him seriously , but he soon choked them off . "
4312	4315	4178	4178	I	0	" How ? "
4316	4385	4199	4199	He	311	" Well , by his insufferable rudeness and impossible behavior . There was poor old Wadley , of the Zoological Institute . Wadley sent a message : ' The President of the Zoological Institute presents his compliments to Professor Challenger , and would take it as a personal favor if he would do them the honor to come to their next meeting . ' The answer was unprintable . "
4386	4392	4178	4178	I	0	" You do n't say ? "
4393	4435	4199	4199	He	311	" Well , a bowdlerized version of it would run : ' Professor Challenger presents his compliments to the President of the Zoological Institute , and would take it as a personal favor if he would go to the devil . ' "
4436	4440	4178	4178	I	0	" Good Lord ! "
4441	4483	4199	4199	He	311	" Yes , I expect that 's what old Wadley said . I remember his wail at the meeting , which began : ' In fifty years experience of scientific intercourse - - ' It quite broke the old man up . "
4484	4490	4178	4178	I	0	" Anything more about Challenger ? "
4491	4650	4199	4199	He	311	" Well , I 'm a bacteriologist , you know . I live in a nine - hundred - diameter microscope . I can hardly claim to take serious notice of anything that I can see with my naked eye . I 'm a frontiersman from the extreme edge of the Knowable , and I feel quite out of place when I leave my study and come into touch with all you great , rough , hulking creatures . I 'm too detached to talk scandal , and yet at scientific conversaziones I HAVE heard something of Challenger , for he is one of those men whom nobody can ignore . He 's as clever as they make 'em - a full - charged battery of force and vitality , but a quarrelsome , ill - conditioned faddist , and unscrupulous at that . He had gone the length of faking some photographs over the South American business . "
4651	4665	4178	4178	I	0	" You say he is a faddist . What is his particular fad ? "
4666	4695	4199	4199	He	311	" He has a thousand , but the latest is something about Weissmann and Evolution . He had a fearful row about it in Vienna , I believe . "
4696	4705	4178	4178	I	0	" Ca n't you tell me the point ? "
4706	4734	4199	4199	He	311	" Not at the moment , but a translation of the proceedings exists . We have it filed at the office . Would you care to come ? "
4735	4786	4178	4178	I	0	" It 's just what I want . I have to interview the fellow , and I need some lead up to him . It 's really awfully good of you to give me a lift . I 'll go with you now , if it is not too late . "

5251	5406	5247	5248	Tarp Henry	148	" by re - reading your masterly address at Vienna . That lucid and admirable statement seems to be the last word in the matter . There is one sentence in it , however - namely : ' I protest strongly against the insufferable and entirely dogmatic assertion that each separate i d is a microcosm possessed of an historical architecture elaborated slowly through the series of generations . ' Have you no desire , in view of later research , to modify this statement ? Do you not think that it is over - accentuated ? With your permission , I would ask the favor of an interview , as I feel strongly upon the subject , and have certain suggestions which I could only elaborate in a personal conversation . With your consent , I trust to have the honor of calling at eleven o'clock the day after to - morrow Wednesday morning .

I 'll have the answer for you here on Wednesday morning - if he ever deigns to answer you . He is a violent , dangerous , cantankerous character , hated by everyone who comes across him , and the butt of the students , so far as they dare take a liberty with him .

5689	5942	5978	5978	His	148	" SIR , - I have duly received your note , in which you claim to endorse my views , although I am not aware that they are dependent upon endorsement either from you or anyone else . You have ventured to use the word ' speculation ' with regard to my statement upon the subject of Darwinism , and I would call your attention to the fact that such a word in such a connection is offensive to a degree . The context convinces me , however , that you have sinned rather through ignorance and tactlessness than through malice , so I am content to pass the matter by . You quote an isolated sentence from my lecture , and appear to have some difficulty in understanding it . I should have thought that only a sub - human intelligence could have failed to grasp the point , but if it really needs amplification I shall consent to see you at the hour named , though visits and visitors of every sort are exceeding distasteful to me . As to your suggestion that I may modify my opinion , I would have you know that it is not my habit to do so after a deliberate expression of my mature views . You will kindly show the envelope of this letter to my man , Austin , when you call , as he has to take every precaution to shield me from the intrusive rascals who call themselves ' journalists . '

6152	6155	6156	6156	He	324	" Right ! "
6214	6218	6219	6219	she	329	" One moment , "
6222	6246	6219	6219	she	329	" You can wait , Austin . Step in here , sir . May I ask if you have met my husband before ? "
6247	6259	6194	6194	She	329	" No , madam , I have not had the honor . "
6260	6298	6219	6219	she	329	" Then I apologize to you in advance . I must tell you that he is a perfectly impossible person - absolutely impossible . If you are forewarned you will be the more ready to make allowances . "
6299	6309	6194	6194	She	329	" It is most considerate of you , madam . "
6310	6372	6219	6219	she	329	" Get quickly out of the room if he seems inclined to be violent . Do n't wait to argue with him . Several people have been injured through doing that . Afterwards there is a public scandal and it reflects upon me and all of us . I suppose it was n't about South America you wanted to see him ? "
6381	6496	6194	6194	She	329	" Dear me ! That is his most dangerous subject . You wo n't believe a word he says - I 'm sure I do n't wonder . But do n't tell him so , for it makes him very violent . Pretend to believe him , and you may get through all right . Remember he believes it himself . Of that you may be assured . A more honest man never lived . Do n't wait any longer or he may suspect . If you find him dangerous - really dangerous - ring the bell and hold him off until I come . Even at his worst I can usually control him . "
6817	6820	6822	6822	he	2374	" Well ? "
6830	6834	6822	6822	he	2374	" What now ? "
6859	6872	6874	6874	I	0	" You were good enough to give me an appointment , sir , "
6896	6928	6882	6882	He	2374	" Oh , you are the young person who can not understand plain English , are you ? My general conclusions you are good enough to approve , as I understand ? "
6929	6936	6937	6937	I	0	" Entirely , sir - entirely ! "
6942	7001	7002	7002	He	2374	" Dear me ! That strengthens my position very much , does it not ? Your age and appearance make your support doubly valuable . Well , at least you are better than that herd of swine in Vienna , whose gregarious grunt is , however , not more offensive than the isolated effort of the British hog . "
7014	7022	7024	7024	I.	0	" They seem to have behaved abominably , "
7025	7124	7131	7131	his	341	" I assure you that I can fight my own battles , and that I have no possible need of your sympathy . Put me alone , sir , and with my back to the wall . G. E. C. is happiest then . Well , sir , let us do what we can to curtail this visit , which can hardly be agreeable to you , and is inexpressibly irksome to me . You had , as I have been led to believe , some comments to make upon the proposition which I advanced in my thesis . "
7189	7194	7195	7195	he	341	" Come , come ! "
7198	7209	7211	7211	I	0	" I am , of course , a mere student , "
7218	7270	7211	7211	I	0	" hardly more , I might say , than an earnest inquirer . At the same time , it seemed to me that you were a little severe upon Weissmann in this matter . Has not the general evidence since that date tended to - well , to strengthen his position ? "
7271	7275	7276	7276	He	341	" What evidence ? "
7283	7328	7211	7211	I	0	" Well , of course , I am aware that there is not any what you might call DEFINITE evidence . I alluded merely to the trend of modern thought and the general scientific point of view , if I might so express it . "
7336	7343	7345	7345	he	341	" I suppose you are aware , "
7354	7364	7345	7345	he	341	" that the cranial index is a constant factor ? "
7365	7368	7370	7370	I.	0	" Naturally , "
7371	7380	7345	7345	he	341	" And that telegony is still sub judice ? "
7381	7384	7345	7345	he	341	" Undoubtedly . "
7385	7398	7345	7345	he	341	" And that the germ plasm is different from the parthenogenetic egg ? "
7399	7404	7405	7405	I	0	" Why , surely ! "
7415	7422	7423	7423	he	341	" But what does that prove ? "
7433	7439	7440	7440	I	0	" Ah , what indeed ? "
7443	7449	7440	7440	I	0	" What does it prove ? "
7450	7456	7457	7457	he	341	" Shall I tell you ? "
7460	7464	7457	7457	he	341	" Pray do . "
7465	7469	7470	7470	he	341	" It proves , "
7480	7509	7470	7470	he	341	" that you are the damnedest imposter in London - a vile , crawling journalist , who has no more science than he has decency in his composition ! "
7571	7574	7575	7575	he	341	" Gibberish ! "
7592	7807	7575	7575	he	341	" That 's what I have been talking to you , sir - scientific gibberish ! Did you think you could match cunning with me - you with your walnut of a brain ? You think you are omnipotent , you infernal scribblers , do n't you ? That your praise can make a man and your blame can break him ? We must all bow to you , and try to get a favorable word , must we ? This man shall have a leg up , and this man shall have a dressing down ! Creeping vermin , I know you ! You 've got out of your station . Time was when your ears were clipped . You 've lost your sense of proportion . Swollen gas - bags ! I 'll keep you in your proper place . Yes , sir , you have n't got over G. E. C. There 's one man who is still your master . He warned you off , but if you WILL come , by the Lord you do it at your own risk . Forfeit , my good Mr. Malone , I claim forfeit ! You have played a rather dangerous game , and it strikes me that you have lost it . "
7808	7814	7816	7816	I	0	" Look here , sir , "
7826	7848	7816	7816	I	0	" you can be as abusive as you like . But there is a limit . You shall not assault me . "
7849	7854	7855	7855	He	345	" Shall I not ? "
7889	7944	7945	7945	He	345	" I have thrown several of you out of the house . You will be the fourth or fifth . Three pound fifteen each - that is how it averaged . Expensive , but very necessary . Now , sir , why should you not follow your brethren ? I rather think you must . "
8017	8036	8006	8009	this man 's menaces	348	" I 'll trouble you to keep your hands off , sir . I 'll not stand it . "
8037	8041	8042	8042	His	345	" Dear me ! "
8055	8064	8042	8042	His	345	" You wo n't stand it , eh ? "
8065	8075	8076	8076	I	0	" Do n't be such a fool , Professor ! "
8079	8116	8076	8076	I	0	" What can you hope for ? I 'm fifteen stone , as hard as nails , and play center three - quarter every Saturday for the London Irish . I 'm not the man - - "
8285	8289	8290	8290	he	345	" Had enough ? "
8293	8298	8299	8299	I	0	" You infernal bully ! "

8378	8381	8382	8382	he	358	" Well , "
8389	8396	8382	8382	he	358	" what is it , then ? "
8397	8403	8405	8405	I.	0	" This man attacked me , "
8406	8412	8414	8415	the policeman	359	" Did you attack him ? "
8425	8435	8437	8438	the policeman	359	" It 's not the first time , either , "
8446	8476	8437	8438	the policeman	359	" You were in trouble last month for the same thing . You 've blackened this young man 's eye . Do you give him in charge , sir ? "
8480	8483	8485	8485	I	0	" No , "
8487	8492	8485	8485	I	0	" I do not . "
8493	8498	8500	8501	the policeman	359	" What 's that ? "
8503	8521	8485	8485	I	0	" I was to blame myself . I intruded upon him . He gave me fair warning . "
8529	8542	8544	8544	he	359	" Do n't let us have any more such goings - on , "
8546	8559	8544	8544	he	359	" Now , then ! Move on , there , move on ! "
8611	8615	8617	8617	he	2374	" Come in ! "
8619	8628	8617	8617	he	2374	" I 've not done with you yet . "
8667	8678	8647	8650	The man - servant	372	" It 's Just the very Biggest Thing in the World "
8736	8742	8743	8743	she	375	" You brute , George ! "

8763	8774	8760	8760	his	2328	" Here he is , safe and sound behind me . "
8784	8796	8723	8723	she	375	" I am so sorry , I did n't see you . "
8797	8810	8760	8760	his	2328	" I assure you , madam , that it is all right . "
8811	8860	8723	8723	she	375	" He has marked your poor face ! Oh , George , what a brute you are ! Nothing but scandals from one end of the week to the other . Everyone hating and making fun of you . You 've finished my patience . This ends it . "
8861	8865	8866	8866	he	2328	" Dirty linen , "
8869	8876	8877	8877	she	375	" It 's not a secret , "
8880	8956	8877	8877	she	375	" Do you suppose that the whole street - the whole of London , for that matter - - Get away , Austin , we do n't want you here . Do you suppose they do n't all talk about you ? Where is your dignity ? You , a man who should have been Regius Professor at a great University with a thousand students all revering you . Where is your dignity , George ? "
8957	8965	9021	9021	he	377	" How about yours , my dear ? "
8966	8988	8877	8877	she	375	" You try me too much . A ruffian - a common brawling ruffian - that 's what you have become . "
8989	8995	9021	9021	he	377	" Be good , Jessie . "
8996	9003	8877	8877	she	375	" A roaring , raging bully ! "
9004	9014	9016	9016	he	377	" That 's done it ! Stool of penance ! "
9101	9106	9107	9107	she	378	" Let me down ! "
9110	9116	9153	9154	the lady	332	" Say ' please . ' "

9130	9139	9153	9154	the lady	332	" Come into the study , Mr. Malone . "
9140	9147	9149	9149	I	0	" Really , sir - - ! "
9156	9177	9153	9154	the lady	332	" Here 's Mr. Malone pleading for you , Jessie . Say ' please , ' and down you come . "
9178	9188	9189	9189	He	381	" Oh , you brute ! Please ! please ! "
9201	9311	9189	9189	He	381	" You must behave yourself , dear . Mr. Malone is a Pressman . He will have it all in his rag to - morrow , and sell an extra dozen among our neighbors . ' Strange story of high life ' - you felt fairly high on that pedestal , did you not ? Then a sub - title , ' Glimpse of a singular menage . ' He 's a foul feeder , is Mr. Malone , a carrion eater , like all of his kind - porcus ex grege diaboli - a swine from the devil 's herd . That 's it , Malone - what ? "
9312	9318	9320	9320	I	0	" You are really intolerable ! "
9329	9337	9338	9338	he	382	" We shall have a coalition presently , "
9361	9402	9403	9403	He	382	" Excuse this frivolous family badinage , Mr. Malone . I called you back for some more serious purpose than to mix you up with our little domestic pleasantries . Run away , little woman , and do n't fret . "
9414	9469	9470	9470	He	382	" All that you say is perfectly true . I should be a better man if I did what you advise , but I should n't be quite George Edward Challenger . There are plenty of better men , my dear , but only one G. E. C. So make the best of him . "
9489	9495	9496	9496	he	382	" Now , Mr. Malone , "
9506	9514	9496	9496	he	382	" this way , if YOU please . "
9558	9564	9565	9565	he	382	" Real San Juan Colorado , "
9568	9627	9565	9565	he	382	" Excitable people like you are the better for narcotics . Heavens ! do n't bite it ! Cut - and cut with reverence ! Now lean back , and listen attentively to whatever I may care to say to you . If any remark should occur to you , you can reserve it for some more opportune time .
9628	9645	9647	9647	he	382	" First of all , as to your return to my house after your most justifiable expulsion "
9664	9831	9647	9647	he	382	" after , as I say , your well - merited expulsion . The reason lay in your answer to that most officious policeman , in which I seemed to discern some glimmering of good feeling upon your part - more , at any rate , than I am accustomed to associate with your profession . In admitting that the fault of the incident lay with you , you gave some evidence of a certain mental detachment and breadth of view which attracted my favorable notice . The sub - species of the human race to which you unfortunately belong has always been below my mental horizon . Your words brought you suddenly above it . You swam up into my serious notice . For this reason I asked you to return with me , as I was minded to make your further acquaintance . You will kindly deposit your ash in the small Japanese tray on the bamboo table which stands at your left elbow . "
9939	9951	9953	9953	he	387	" I am going to talk to you about South America , "
9955	10009	9953	9953	he	387	" No comments if you please . First of all , I wish you to understand that nothing I tell you now is to be repeated in any public way unless you have my express permission . That permission will , in all human probability , never be given . Is that clear ? "
10010	10016	10018	10018	I.	0	" It is very hard , "
10019	10026	10018	10018	I.	0	" Surely a judicious account - - "
10035	10040	10042	10042	he	387	" That ends it , "
10044	10053	10042	10042	he	387	" I wish you a very good morning . "
10054	10059	10060	10060	I	0	" No , no ! "
10063	10082	10060	10060	I	0	" I submit to any conditions . So far as I can see , I have no choice . "
10083	10089	10091	10091	he	387	" None in the world , "
10093	10101	10060	10060	I	0	" Well , then , I promise . "
10102	10107	10060	10060	I	0	" Word of honor ? "
10108	10113	10114	10114	He	387	" Word of honor . "
10125	10137	10139	10139	he	387	" After all , what do I know about your honor ? "
10141	10148	10149	10149	I	0	" Upon my word , sir , "
10154	10171	10149	10149	I	0	" you take very great liberties ! I have never been so insulted in my life . "
10182	10187	10188	10188	he	387	" Round - headed , "
10191	10213	10188	10188	he	387	" Brachycephalic , gray - eyed , black - haired , with suggestion of the negroid . Celtic , I presume ? "
10214	10222	10172	10172	He	387	" I am an Irishman , sir . "
10223	10227	10188	10188	he	387	" Irish Irish ? "
10228	10233	10172	10172	He	387	" Yes , sir . "
10234	10393	10188	10188	he	387	" That , of course , explains it . Let me see ; you have given me your promise that my confidence will be respected ? That confidence , I may say , will be far from complete . But I am prepared to give you a few indications which will be of interest . In the first place , you are probably aware that two years ago I made a journey to South America - one which will be classical in the scientific history of the world ? The object of my journey was to verify some conclusions of Wallace and of Bates , which could only be done by observing their reported facts under the same conditions in which they had themselves noted them . If my expedition had no other results it would still have been noteworthy , but a curious incident occurred to me while there which opened up an entirely fresh line of inquiry .
10394	10737	10172	10172	He	387	" You are aware - or probably , in this half - educated age , you are not aware - that the country round some parts of the Amazon is still only partially explored , and that a great number of tributaries , some of them entirely uncharted , run into the main river . It was my business to visit this little - known back - country and to examine its fauna , which furnished me with the materials for several chapters for that great and monumental work upon zoology which will be my life 's justification . I was returning , my work accomplished , when I had occasion to spend a night at a small Indian village at a point where a certain tributary - the name and position of which I withhold - opens into the main river . The natives were Cucama Indians , an amiable but degraded race , with mental powers hardly superior to the average Londoner . I had effected some cures among them upon my way up the river , and had impressed them considerably with my personality , so that I was not surprised to find myself eagerly awaited upon my return . I gathered from their signs that someone had urgent need of my medical services , and I followed the chief to one of his huts . When I entered I found that the sufferer to whose aid I had been summoned had that instant expired . He was , to my surprise , no Indian , but a white man ; indeed , I may say a very white man , for he was flaxen - haired and had some characteristics of an albino . He was clad in rags , was very emaciated , and bore every trace of prolonged hardship . So far as I could understand the account of the natives , he was a complete stranger to them , and had come upon their village through the woods alone and in the last stage of exhaustion .
10738	10815	10188	10188	he	387	" The man 's knapsack lay beside the couch , and I examined the contents . His name was written upon a tab within it - Maple White , Lake Avenue , Detroit , Michigan . It is a name to which I am prepared always to lift my hat . It is not too much to say that it will rank level with my own when the final credit of this business comes to be apportioned .
10816	10950	10172	10172	He	387	" From the contents of the knapsack it was evident that this man had been an artist and poet in search of effects . There were scraps of verse . I do not profess to be a judge of such things , but they appeared to me to be singularly wanting in merit . There were also some rather commonplace pictures of river scenery , a paint - box , a box of colored chalks , some brushes , that curved bone which lies upon my inkstand , a volume of Baxter 's ' Moths and Butterflies , ' a cheap revolver , and a few cartridges . Of personal equipment he either had none or he had lost it in his journey . Such were the total effects of this strange American Bohemian .
10951	11044	10188	10188	he	387	" I was turning away from him when I observed that something projected from the front of his ragged jacket . It was this sketch - book , which was as dilapidated then as you see it now . Indeed , I can assure you that a first folio of Shakespeare could not be treated with greater reverence than this relic has been since it came into my possession . I hand it to you now , and I ask you to take it page by page and to examine the contents . "

11312	11330	11264	11264	I	0	" I meant that I could see nothing unusual - nothing to justify what you have said . "

11488	11491	11492	11492	he	2374	" Well ? "
11495	11504	11506	11506	I	0	" It is no doubt a curious formation , "
11507	11521	11555	11555	I	0	" but I am not geologist enough to say that it is wonderful . "
11522	11525	11526	11526	he	2374	" Wonderful ! "
11529	11554	11526	11526	he	2374	" It is unique . It is incredible . No one on earth has ever dreamed of such a possibility . Now the next . "

11728	11743	11692	11692	his	2374	" Oh , that 's the best explanation you can give , is it ? "
11744	11753	11692	11692	his	2374	" Well , sir , what is yours ? "
11754	11771	11692	11692	his	2374	" The obvious one that the creature exists . That is actually sketched from the life . "

11801	11805	11799	11799	I	0	" no doubt , "
11812	11818	11819	11819	I	0	" I confess , however , "
11822	11863	11819	11819	I	0	" that this tiny human figure puzzles me . If it were an Indian we could set it down as evidence of some pigmy race in America , but it appears to be a European in a sun - hat . "
11872	11879	11881	11881	he	2374	" You really touch the limit , "
11883	11900	11881	11881	he	2374	" You enlarge my view of the possible . Cerebral paresis ! Mental inertia ! Wonderful ! "
11945	11955	11957	11957	I.	0	" It struck me that the man was small , "
11958	11962	11963	11963	he	2374	" Look here ! "
11982	12093	11963	11963	he	2374	" You see that plant behind the animal ; I suppose you thought it was a dandelion or a Brussels sprout - what ? Well , it is a vegetable ivory palm , and they run to about fifty or sixty feet . Do n't you see that the man is put in for a purpose ? He could n't really have stood in front of that brute and lived to draw it . He sketched himself in to give a scale of heights . He was , we will say , over five feet high . The tree is ten times bigger , which is what one would expect . "
12094	12098	12099	12099	I	0	" Good heavens ! "
12102	12126	12099	12099	I	0	" Then you think the beast was - - Why , Charing Cross station would hardly make a kennel for such a brute ! "
12127	12141	12143	12144	the Professor	2374	" Apart from exaggeration , he is certainly a well - grown specimen , "
12148	12151	12152	12152	I	0	" But , "
12176	12195	12143	12144	the Professor	2374	" - I had turned over the leaves and ascertained that there was nothing more in the book - "
12246	12246	12229	12229	You	0	"
12259	12273	12275	12275	he	2374	" This is an excellent monograph by my gifted friend , Ray Lankester ! "
12277	12338	12275	12275	he	2374	" There is an illustration here which would interest you . Ah , yes , here it is ! The inscription beneath it runs : ' Probable appearance in life of the Jurassic Dinosaur Stegosaurus . The hind leg alone is twice as tall as a full - grown man . ' Well , what do you make of that ? "
12378	12384	12386	12386	I.	0	" That is certainly remarkable , "
12387	12398	12386	12386	I.	0	" But you wo n't admit that it is final ? "
12399	12438	12386	12386	I.	0	" Surely it might be a coincidence , or this American may have seen a picture of the kind and carried it in his memory . It would be likely to recur to a man in a delirium . "
12439	12443	12445	12446	the Professor	2374	" Very good , "
12450	12468	12469	12469	He	2374	" we leave it at that . I will now ask you to look at this bone . "
12513	12523	12525	12526	the Professor	2374	" To what known creature does that bone belong ? "
12543	12555	12556	12556	I	0	" It might be a very thick human collar - bone , "
12568	12607	12562	12562	his	420	" The human collar - bone is curved . This is straight . There is a groove upon its surface showing that a great tendon played across it , which could not be the case with a clavicle . "
12608	12622	12562	12562	his	420	" Then I must confess that I do n't know what it is . "
12623	12651	12652	12652	He	2374	" You need not be ashamed to expose your ignorance , for I do n't suppose the whole South Kensington staff could give a name to it . "
12669	12729	12652	12652	He	2374	" So far as I am a judge this human bone is the analogue of the one which you hold in your hand . That will give you some idea of the size of the creature . You will observe from the cartilage that this is no fossil specimen , but recent . What do you say to that ? "
12730	12737	12562	12562	his	420	" Surely in an elephant - - "
12745	12767	12562	12562	his	420	" Do n't ! Do n't talk of elephants in South America . Even in these days of Board schools - - "
12768	12771	12772	12772	I	0	" Well , "
12775	12788	12772	12772	I	0	" any large South American animal - a tapir , for example . "
12789	12874	12562	12562	his	420	" You may take it , young man , that I am versed in the elements of my business . This is not a conceivable bone either of a tapir or of any other creature known to zoology . It belongs to a very large , a very strong , and , by all analogy , a very fierce animal which exists upon the face of the earth , but has not yet come under the notice of science . You are still unconvinced ? "
12875	12883	12772	12772	I	0	" I am at least deeply interested . "
12884	12995	12562	12562	his	420	" Then your case is not hopeless . I feel that there is reason lurking in you somewhere , so we will patiently grope round for it . We will now leave the dead American and proceed with my narrative . You can imagine that I could hardly come away from the Amazon without probing deeper into the matter . There were indications as to the direction from which the dead traveler had come . Indian legends would alone have been my guide , for I found that rumors of a strange land were common among all the riverine tribes . You have heard , no doubt , of Curupuri ? "
12996	12999	12772	12772	I	0	" Never . "
13000	13081	12562	12562	his	420	" Curupuri is the spirit of the woods , something terrible , something malevolent , something to be avoided . None can describe its shape or nature , but it is a word of terror along the Amazon . Now all tribes agree as to the direction in which Curupuri lives . It was the same direction from which the American had come . Something terrible lay that way . It was my business to find out what it was . "
13082	13088	12772	12772	I	0	" What did you do ? "
13105	13215	13216	13216	He	421	" I overcame the extreme reluctance of the natives - a reluctance which extends even to talk upon the subject - and by judicious persuasion and gifts , aided , I will admit , by some threats of coercion , I got two of them to act as guides . After many adventures which I need not describe , and after traveling a distance which I will not mention , in a direction which I withhold , we came at last to a tract of country which has never been described , nor , indeed , visited save by my unfortunate predecessor . Would you kindly look at this ? "
13227	13239	13241	13241	he	421	" The unsatisfactory appearance of it is due to the fact , "
13243	13319	13241	13241	he	421	" that on descending the river the boat was upset and the case which contained the undeveloped films was broken , with disastrous results . Nearly all of them were totally ruined - an irreparable loss . This is one of the few which partially escaped . This explanation of deficiencies or abnormalities you will kindly accept . There was talk of faking . I am not in a mood to argue such a point . "
13391	13404	13406	13406	I.	0	" I believe it is the same place as the painted picture , "
13407	13414	13415	13416	the Professor	2374	" It is the same place , "
13419	13434	13415	13416	the Professor	2374	" I found traces of the fellow 's camp . Now look at this . "
13472	13482	13484	13484	I.	0	" I have no doubt of it at all , "
13485	13493	13495	13495	he	421	" Well , that is something gained , "
13497	13525	13495	13495	he	421	" We progress , do we not ? Now , will you please look at the top of that rocky pinnacle ? Do you observe something there ? "
13526	13531	13547	13547	He	421	" An enormous tree . "
13532	13538	13495	13495	he	421	" But on the tree ? "
13539	13544	13547	13547	He	421	" A large bird , "
13553	13556	13557	13557	I	0	" Yes , "
13564	13589	13557	13557	I	0	" a large bird stands on the tree . It appears to have a considerable beak . I should say it was a pelican . "
13590	13600	13602	13603	the Professor	2374	" I can not congratulate you upon your eyesight , "
13605	13655	13602	13603	the Professor	2374	" It is not a pelican , nor , indeed , is it a bird . It may interest you to know that I succeeded in shooting that particular specimen . It was the only absolute proof of my experiences which I was able to bring away with me . "
13656	13663	13749	13749	he	2374	" You have it , then ? "
13671	13745	13749	13749	he	2374	" I had it . It was unfortunately lost with so much else in the same boat accident which ruined my photographs . I clutched at it as it disappeared in the swirl of the rapids , and part of its wing was left in my hand . I was insensible when washed ashore , but the miserable remnant of my superb specimen was still intact ; I now lay it before you . "
13788	13793	13794	13794	I	0	" A monstrous bat ! "
13797	13803	13805	13806	the Professor	2374	" Nothing of the sort , "
13810	13937	13805	13806	the Professor	2374	" Living , as I do , in an educated and scientific atmosphere , I could not have conceived that the first principles of zoology were so little known . Is it possible that you do not know the elementary fact in comparative anatomy , that the wing of a bird is really the forearm , while the wing of a bat consists of three elongated fingers with membranes between ? Now , in this case , the bone is certainly not the forearm , and you can see for yourself that this is a single membrane hanging upon a single bone , and therefore that it can not belong to a bat . But if it is neither bird nor bat , what is it ? "
13946	13953	13956	13956	He	2374	" I really do not know , "
13969	13972	13974	13974	he	2374	" Here , "
13986	14030	13974	13974	he	2374	" is an excellent reproduction of the dimorphodon , or pterodactyl , a flying reptile of the Jurassic period . On the next page is a diagram of the mechanism of its wing . Kindly compare it with the specimen in your hand . "
14125	14139	14141	14141	I	0	" It 's just the very biggest thing that I ever heard of ! "
14157	14210	14141	14141	I	0	" It is colossal . You are a Columbus of science who has discovered a lost world . I 'm awfully sorry if I seemed to doubt you . It was all so unthinkable . But I understand evidence when I see it , and this should be good enough for anyone . "
14217	14229	14211	14212	The Professor	2374	" And then , sir , what did you do next ? "
14230	14375	14211	14212	The Professor	2374	" It was the wet season , Mr. Malone , and my stores were exhausted . I explored some portion of this huge cliff , but I was unable to find any way to scale it . The pyramidal rock upon which I saw and shot the pterodactyl was more accessible . Being something of a cragsman , I did manage to get half way to the top of that . From that height I had a better idea of the plateau upon the top of the crags . It appeared to be very large ; neither to east nor to west could I see any end to the vista of green - capped cliffs . Below , it is a swampy , jungly region , full of snakes , insects , and fever . It is a natural protection to this singular country . "
14376	14386	14211	14212	The Professor	2374	" Did you see any other trace of life ? "
14387	14419	14211	14212	The Professor	2374	" No , sir , I did not ; but during the week that we lay encamped at the base of the cliff we heard some very strange noises from above . "
14420	14436	14211	14212	The Professor	2374	" But the creature that the American drew ? How do you account for that ? "
14437	14499	14211	14212	The Professor	2374	" We can only suppose that he must have made his way to the summit and seen it there . We know , therefore , that there is a way up . We know equally that it must be a very difficult one , otherwise the creatures would have come down and overrun the surrounding country . Surely that is clear ? "
14500	14510	14211	14212	The Professor	2374	" But how did they come to be there ? "
14511	14525	14527	14528	the Professor	2374	" I do not think that the problem is a very obscure one , "
14530	14709	14527	14528	the Professor	2374	" there can only be one explanation . South America is , as you may have heard , a granite continent . At this single point in the interior there has been , in some far distant age , a great , sudden volcanic upheaval . These cliffs , I may remark , are basaltic , and therefore plutonic . An area , as large perhaps as Sussex , has been lifted up en bloc with all its living contents , and cut off by perpendicular precipices of a hardness which defies erosion from all the rest of the continent . What is the result ? Why , the ordinary laws of Nature are suspended . The various checks which influence the struggle for existence in the world at large are all neutralized or altered . Creatures survive which would otherwise disappear . You will observe that both the pterodactyl and the stegosaurus are Jurassic , and therefore of a great age in the order of life . They have been artificially conserved by those strange accidental conditions . "
14710	14729	14211	14212	The Professor	2374	" But surely your evidence is conclusive . You have only to lay it before the proper authorities . "
14730	14740	14742	14743	the Professor	2374	" So in my simplicity , I had imagined , "
14747	14894	14742	14743	the Professor	2374	" I can only tell you that it was not so , that I was met at every turn by incredulity , born partly of stupidity and partly of jealousy . It is not my nature , sir , to cringe to any man , or to seek to prove a fact if my word has been doubted . After the first I have not condescended to show such corroborative proofs as I possess . The subject became hateful to me - I would not speak of it . When men like yourself , who represent the foolish curiosity of the public , came to disturb my privacy I was unable to meet them with dignified reserve . By nature I am , I admit , somewhat fiery , and under provocation I am inclined to be violent . I fear you may have remarked it . "
14903	14962	14963	14963	He	433	" My wife has frequently remonstrated with me upon the subject , and yet I fancy that any man of honor would feel the same . To - night , however , I propose to give an extreme example of the control of the will over the emotions . I invite you to be present at the exhibition . "
14972	15120	14963	14963	He	433	" You will perceive that Mr. Percival Waldron , a naturalist of some popular repute , is announced to lecture at eight - thirty at the Zoological Institute 's Hall upon ' The Record of the Ages . ' I have been specially invited to be present upon the platform , and to move a vote of thanks to the lecturer . While doing so , I shall make it my business , with infinite tact and delicacy , to throw out a few remarks which may arouse the interest of the audience and cause some of them to desire to go more deeply into the matter . Nothing contentious , you understand , but only an indication that there are greater deeps beyond . I shall hold myself strongly in leash , and see whether by this self - restraint I attain a more favorable result . "
15121	15127	15128	15128	I	0	" And I may come ? "
15132	15137	15138	15138	he	433	" Why , surely , "
15192	15322	15432	15432	he	434	" By all means , come . It will be a comfort to me to know that I have one ally in the hall , however inefficient and ignorant of the subject he may be . I fancy there will be a large audience , for Waldron , though an absolute charlatan , has a considerable popular following . Now , Mr. Malone , I have given you rather more of my time than I had intended . The individual must not monopolize what is meant for the world . I shall be pleased to see you at the lecture to - night . In the meantime , you will understand that no public use is to be made of any of the material that I have given you . "
15323	15344	15432	15432	he	434	" But Mr. McArdle - my news editor , you know - will want to know what I have done . "
15345	15413	15432	15432	he	434	" Tell him what you like . You can say , among other things , that if he sends anyone else to intrude upon me I shall call upon him with a riding - whip . But I leave it to you that nothing of all this appears in print . Very good . Then the Zoological Institute 's Hall at eight - thirty to - night . "
15442	15445	15432	15432	he	434	" Question ! "
15565	15568	15569	15569	he	143	" Well , "
15574	15604	15569	15569	he	143	" what may it run to ? I 'm thinking , young man , you have been in the wars . Do n't tell me that he assaulted you . "
15605	15614	15800	15800	McArdle	143	" We had a little difference at first . "
15615	15627	15569	15569	he	143	" What a man it is ! What did you do ? "
15628	15653	15800	15800	McArdle	143	" Well , he became more reasonable and we had a chat . But I got nothing out of him - nothing for publication . "
15654	15768	15569	15569	he	143	" I 'm not so sure about that . You got a black eye out of him , and that 's for publication . We ca n't have this reign of terror , Mr. Malone . We must bring the man to his bearings . I 'll have a leaderette on him to - morrow that will raise a blister . Just give me the material and I will engage to brand the fellow for ever . Professor Munchausen - how 's that for an inset headline ? Sir John Mandeville redivivus - Cagliostro - all the imposters and bullies in history . I 'll show him up for the fraud he is . "
15769	15778	15800	15800	McArdle	143	" I would n't do that , sir . "
15779	15783	15569	15569	he	143	" Why not ? "
15784	15794	15800	15800	McArdle	143	" Because he is not a fraud at all . "
15795	15798	15800	15800	McArdle	143	" What ! "
15802	15825	15800	15800	McArdle	143	" You do n't mean to say you really believe this stuff of his about mammoths and mastodons and great sea sairpents ? "
15826	15858	15800	15800	McArdle	143	" Well , I do n't know about that . I do n't think he makes any claims of that kind . But I do believe he has got something new . "
15859	15872	15800	15800	McArdle	143	" Then for Heaven 's sake , man , write it up ! "
15873	15896	15897	15897	I	0	" I 'm longing to , but all I know he gave me in confidence and on condition that I did n't . "
15908	15915	15800	15800	McArdle	143	" That 's how it stands . "
15921	15927	15928	15928	he	143	" Well , Mr. Malone , "
15933	16022	15928	15928	he	143	" about this scientific meeting to - night ; there can be no privacy about that , anyhow . I do n't suppose any paper will want to report it , for Waldron has been reported already a dozen times , and no one is aware that Challenger will speak . We may get a scoop , if we are lucky . You 'll be there in any case , so you 'll just give us a pretty full report . I 'll keep space up to midnight . "
16078	16133	16054	16054	He	148	" My dear chap , things do n't happen like that in real life . People do n't stumble upon enormous discoveries and then lose their evidence . Leave that to the novelists . The fellow is as full of tricks as the monkey - house at the Zoo . It 's all bosh . "
16134	16140	16280	16280	I	0	" But the American poet ? "
16141	16146	16054	16054	He	148	" He never existed . "
16147	16155	16280	16280	I	0	" I saw his sketch - book . "
16156	16163	16054	16054	He	148	" Challenger 's sketch - book . "
16164	16172	16280	16280	I	0	" You think he drew that animal ? "
16173	16182	16054	16054	He	148	" Of course he did . Who else ? "
16183	16191	16280	16280	I	0	" Well , then , the photographs ? "
16192	16210	16054	16054	He	148	" There was nothing in the photographs . By your own admission you only saw a bird . "
16211	16215	16280	16280	I	0	" A pterodactyl . "
16216	16231	16054	16054	He	148	" That 's what HE says . He put the pterodactyl into your head . "
16232	16240	16280	16280	I	0	" Well , then , the bones ? "
16241	16279	16054	16054	He	148	" First one out of an Irish stew . Second one vamped up for the occasion . If you are clever and know your business you can fake a bone as easily as you can a photograph . "
16307	16315	16316	16316	I	0	" Will you come to the meeting ? "
16324	16336	16338	16338	he	148	" He is not a popular person , the genial Challenger , "
16340	16393	16338	16338	he	148	" A lot of people have accounts to settle with him . I should say he is about the best - hated man in London . If the medical students turn out there will be no end of a rag . I do n't want to get into a bear - garden . "
16394	16411	16338	16338	he	148	" You might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case . "
16412	16432	16338	16338	he	148	" Well , perhaps it 's only fair . All right . I 'm your man for the evening . "
16652	16660	16662	16662	he	173	" Where DID you get that tile ? "
17587	17592	17594	17600	a sceptical student in the back row	488	" No , no , "
17612	17617	17603	17629	the young gentleman in the red tie who cried " No , no , " and who presumably claimed to have been hatched out of an egg	489	" No , no , "
17862	17869	17870	17870	he	174	" Hence , ladies and gentlemen , "
17873	17911	17870	17870	he	174	" that frightful brood of saurians which still affright our eyes when seen in the Wealden or in the Solenhofen slates , but which were fortunately extinct long before the first appearance of mankind upon this planet . "
17912	17915	17870	17870	he	174	" Question ! "
18017	18027	18009	18009	his	170	" Which were extinct before the coming of man . "
18028	18031	18033	18034	the voice	508	" Question ! "
18083	18087	18089	18089	Waldron	170	" I see ! "
18095	18103	18089	18089	Waldron	170	" It is my friend Professor Challenger , "
18214	18217	18171	18172	The audience	2633	" Question ! "
18229	18232	18171	18172	The audience	2633	" Order ! "
18234	18237	18171	18172	The audience	2633	" Shame ! "
18283	18289	18290	18290	he	170	" This is really intolerable ! "
18298	18315	18290	18290	he	170	" I must ask you , Professor Challenger , to cease these ignorant and unmannerly interruptions . "
18351	18362	18363	18363	he	170	" I must in turn ask you , Mr. Waldron , "
18366	18382	18363	18363	he	170	" to cease to make assertions which are not in strict accordance with scientific fact . "
18389	18394	18340	18340	Challenger	142	" Shame ! Shame ! "
18395	18401	18340	18340	Challenger	142	" Give him a hearing ! "
18402	18407	18340	18340	Challenger	142	" Put him out ! "
18408	18415	18340	18340	Challenger	142	" Shove him off the platform ! "
18416	18420	18340	18340	Challenger	142	" Fair play ! "
18445	18455	18439	18439	his	2407	" Professor Challenger - personal - views - later , "
18616	18621	18622	18622	he	170	" Ladies and Gentlemen , "
18633	18659	18622	18622	he	170	" I beg pardon - Ladies , Gentlemen , and Children - I must apologize , I had inadvertently omitted a considerable section of this audience "
18690	18790	18792	18792	he	170	" I have been selected to move a vote of thanks to Mr. Waldron for the very picturesque and imaginative address to which we have just listened . There are points in it with which I disagree , and it has been my duty to indicate them as they arose , but , none the less , Mr. Waldron has accomplished his object well , that object being to give a simple and interesting account of what he conceives to have been the history of our planet . Popular lectures are the easiest to listen to , but Mr. Waldron "
18799	18829	18792	18792	he	170	" will excuse me when I say that they are necessarily both superficial and misleading , since they have to be graded to the comprehension of an ignorant audience . "
18833	18842	18792	18792	he	170	" Popular lecturers are in their nature parasitic . "
18851	18949	18848	18849	Mr. Waldron	170	" They exploit for fame or cash the work which has been done by their indigent and unknown brethren . One smallest new fact obtained in the laboratory , one brick built into the temple of science , far outweighs any second - hand exposition which passes an idle hour , but can leave no useful result behind it . I put forward this obvious reflection , not out of any desire to disparage Mr. Waldron in particular , but that you may not lose your sense of proportion and mistake the acolyte for the high priest . "
18973	18979	18953	18954	Mr. Waldron	170	" But enough of this ! "
18985	19178	18953	18954	Mr. Waldron	170	" Let me pass to some subject of wider interest . What is the particular point upon which I , as an original investigator , have challenged our lecturer 's accuracy ? It is upon the permanence of certain types of animal life upon the earth . I do not speak upon this subject as an amateur , nor , I may add , as a popular lecturer , but I speak as one whose scientific conscience compels him to adhere closely to facts , when I say that Mr. Waldron is very wrong in supposing that because he has never himself seen a so - called prehistoric animal , therefore these creatures no longer exist . They are indeed , as he has said , our ancestors , but they are , if I may use the expression , our contemporary ancestors , who can still be found with all their hideous and formidable characteristics if one has but the energy and hardihood to seek their haunts . Creatures which were supposed to be Jurassic , monsters who would hunt down and devour our largest and fiercest mammals , still exist . "
19181	19184	19338	19339	the accused	531	" Bosh ! "
19185	19189	19338	19339	the accused	531	" Prove it ! "
19190	19196	19338	19339	the accused	531	" How do YOU know ? "
19197	19200	19338	19339	the accused	531	" Question ! "
19201	19231	19338	19339	the accused	531	" How do I know , you ask me ? I know because I have visited their secret haunts . I know because I have seen some of them . "
19240	19243	19338	19339	the accused	531	" Liar ! "
19244	19250	19338	19339	the accused	531	" Am I a liar ? "
19257	19286	19338	19339	the accused	531	" Did I hear someone say that I was a liar ? Will the person who called me a liar kindly stand up that I may know him ? "
19290	19297	19338	19339	the accused	531	" Here he is , sir ! "
19318	19328	19313	19316	a group of students	530	" Did you venture to call me a liar ? "
19329	19336	19338	19339	the accused	531	" No , sir , no ! "
19353	19381	19338	19339	the accused	531	" If any person in this hall dares to doubt my veracity , I shall be glad to have a few words with him after the lecture . "
19382	19385	19313	19316	a group of students	530	" Liar ! "
19386	19391	19393	19397	the inoffensive one plunging desperately	533	" Who said that ? "
19406	19415	19393	19397	the inoffensive one plunging desperately	533	" If I come down among you - - "
19419	19426	19338	19339	the accused	531	" Come , love , come ! "
19479	19557	19458	19458	his	2374	" Every great discoverer has been met with the same incredulity - the sure brand of a generation of fools . When great facts are laid before you , you have not the intuition , the imagination which would help you to understand them . You can only throw mud at the men who have risked their lives to open new fields to science . You persecute the prophets ! Galileo ! Darwin , and I - - "
19711	19718	19719	19719	he	2374	" I will not detain you , "
19722	19780	19719	19719	he	2374	" It is not worth it . Truth is truth , and the noise of a number of foolish young men - and , I fear I must add , of their equally foolish seniors - can not affect the matter . I claim that I have opened a new field of science . You dispute it . "
19783	19816	19719	19719	he	2374	" Then I put you to the test . Will you accredit one or more of your own number to go out as your representatives and test my statement in your name ? "
20129	20135	20126	20127	Mr. Summerlee	178	" Yes , I will . "
20142	20220	20139	20140	Professor Challenger	142	" Then I guarantee that I will place in your hands such material as will enable you to find your way . It is only right , however , since Mr. Summerlee goes to check my statement that I should have one or more with him who may check his . I will not disguise from you that there are difficulties and dangers . Mr. Summerlee will need a younger colleague . May I ask for volunteers ? "
20326	20341	20323	20323	him	148	" Sit down , Malone ! Do n't make a public ass of yourself . "
20392	20400	20401	20401	I	0	" I will go , Mr. Chairman , "
20409	20414	20416	20417	the audience	2633	" Name ! Name ! "
20419	20445	20416	20417	the audience	2633	" My name is Edward Dunn Malone . I am the reporter of the Daily Gazette . I claim to be an absolutely unprejudiced witness . "
20446	20454	20455	20456	the chairman	2407	" What is YOUR name , sir ? "
20463	20492	20455	20456	the chairman	2407	" I am Lord John Roxton . I have already been up the Amazon , I know all the ground , and have special qualifications for this investigation . "
20493	20514	20516	20517	the chairman	2407	" Lord John Roxton 's reputation as a sportsman and a traveler is , of course , world - famous , "
20519	20542	20516	20517	the chairman	2407	" at the same time it would certainly be as well to have a member of the Press upon such an expedition . "
20543	20548	20550	20551	Professor Challenger	142	" Then I move , "
20553	20586	20550	20551	Professor Challenger	142	" that both these gentlemen be elected , as representatives of this meeting , to accompany Professor Summerlee upon his journey to investigate and to report upon the truth of my statements . "
20762	20769	20771	20771	he	571	" Mr. Malone , I understand , "
20773	20823	20771	20771	he	571	" We are to be companions - what ? My rooms are just over the road , in the Albany . Perhaps you would have the kindness to spare me half an hour , for there are one or two things that I badly want to say to you . "
20826	20834	20835	20837	Lord John Roxton	181	" I was the Flail of the Lord "
21509	21512	21514	21514	he	181	" Well , "
21519	21532	21514	21514	he	181	" we 've gone and done it , young fellah my lad . "
21546	21555	21536	21536	he	181	" young - fellah - me - lad . "
21556	21592	21536	21536	he	181	" Yes , we 've taken a jump , you an ' me . I suppose , now , when you went into that room there was no such notion in your head - what ? "
21593	21599	21536	21536	he	181	" No thought of it . "
21600	21662	21536	21536	he	181	" The same here . No thought of it . And here we are , up to our necks in the tureen . Why , I 've only been back three weeks from Uganda , and taken a place in Scotland , and signed the lease and all . Pretty goin 's on - what ? How does it hit you ? "
21663	21685	21536	21536	he	181	" Well , it is all in the main line of my business . I am a journalist on the Gazette . "
21686	21718	21536	21536	he	181	" Of course - you said so when you took it on . By the way , I 've got a small job for you , if you 'll help me . "
21719	21723	21536	21536	he	181	" With pleasure . "
21724	21736	21536	21536	he	181	" Do n't mind takin ' a risk , do you ? "
21737	21743	21536	21536	he	181	" What is the risk ? "
21744	21762	21536	21536	he	181	" Well , it 's Ballinger - he 's the risk . You 've heard of him ? "
21763	21766	21536	21536	he	181	" No . "
21767	21956	21536	21536	he	181	" Why , young fellah , where HAVE you lived ? Sir John Ballinger is the best gentleman jock in the north country . I could hold him on the flat at my best , but over jumps he 's my master . Well , it 's an open secret that when he 's out of trainin ' he drinks hard - strikin ' an average , he calls it . He got delirium on Toosday , and has been ragin ' like a devil ever since . His room is above this . The doctors say that it is all up with the old dear unless some food is got into him , but as he lies in bed with a revolver on his coverlet , and swears he will put six of the best through anyone that comes near him , there 's been a bit of a strike among the serving - men . He 's a hard nail , is Jack , and a dead shot , too , but you ca n't leave a Grand National winner to die like that - what ? "
21957	21967	21968	21968	I	0	" What do you mean to do , then ? "
21971	22043	21536	21536	he	181	" Well , my idea was that you and I could rush him . He may be dozin ' , and at the worst he can only wing one of us , and the other should have him . If we can get his bolster - cover round his arms and then ' phone up a stomach - pump , we 'll give the old dear the supper of his life . "
22221	22230	22232	22232	I.	0	" Talking wo n't make it any better , "
22233	22237	22232	22232	I.	0	" Come on . "
22276	22288	22290	22290	he	181	" All right , sonny my lad - you 'll do , "
22298	22471	22292	22292	I	0	" I saw after Jack Ballinger myself this mornin ' . He blew a hole in the skirt of my kimono , bless his shaky old hand , but we got a jacket on him , and he 's to be all right in a week . I say , young fellah , I hope you do n't mind - what ? You see , between you an ' me close - tiled , I look on this South American business as a mighty serious thing , and if I have a pal with me I want a man I can bank on . So I sized you down , and I 'm bound to say that you came well out of it . You see , it 's all up to you and me , for this old Summerlee man will want dry - nursin ' from the first . By the way , are you by any chance the Malone who is expected to get his Rugby cap for Ireland ? "
22472	22478	22257	22257	he	181	" A reserve , perhaps . "
22479	22616	22292	22292	I	0	" I thought I remembered your face . Why , I was there when you got that try against Richmond - as fine a swervin ' run as I saw the whole season . I never miss a Rugby match if I can help it , for it is the manliest game we have left . Well , I did n't ask you in here just to talk sport . We 've got to fix our business . Here are the sailin 's , on the first page of the Times . There 's a Booth boat for Para next Wednesday week , and if the Professor and you can work it , I think we should take it - what ? Very good , I 'll fix it with him . What about your outfit ? "
22617	22625	22257	22257	he	181	" My paper will see to that . "
22626	22631	22292	22292	I	0	" Can you shoot ? "
22632	22638	22257	22257	he	181	" About average Territorial standard . "
22639	22742	22743	22743	He	600	" Good Lord ! as bad as that ? It 's the last thing you young fellahs think of learnin ' . You 're all bees without stings , so far as lookin ' after the hive goes . You 'll look silly , some o ' these days , when someone comes along an ' sneaks the honey . But you 'll need to hold your gun straight in South America , for , unless our friend the Professor is a madman or a liar , we may see some queer things before we get back . What gun have you ? "
22774	22789	22791	22791	he	600	" I 'll see what I can spare you out of my own battery , "
22838	22848	22850	22850	he	600	" This is a Bland 's .577 axite express , "
22852	22861	22862	22862	He	600	" I got that big fellow with it . "
22870	22885	22862	22862	He	600	" Ten more yards , and he 'd would have added me to HIS collection .
23107	23120	23165	23165	he	0	" He took out a beautiful brown - and - silver rifle . "
23144	23158	23136	23136	You	604	" He handed it to me and closed the door of his oak cabinet .
23159	23164	23165	23165	he	0	" By the way , "
23174	23184	23165	23165	he	0	" what do you know of this Professor Challenger ? "
23185	23195	23136	23136	You	604	" I never saw him till to - day . "
23196	23252	23165	23165	he	0	" Well , neither did I. It 's funny we should both sail under sealed orders from a man we do n't know . He seemed an uppish old bird . His brothers of science do n't seem too fond of him , either . How came you to take an interest in the affair ? "
23284	23298	23300	23300	he	0	" I believe every single word he said to you was the truth , "
23304	23504	23506	23506	he	616	" and , mind you , I have something to go on when I speak like that . South America is a place I love , and I think , if you take it right through from Darien to Fuego , it 's the grandest , richest , most wonderful bit of earth upon this planet . People do n't know it yet , and do n't realize what it may become . I 've been up an ' down it from end to end , and had two dry seasons in those very parts , as I told you when I spoke of the war I made on the slave - dealers . Well , when I was up there I heard some yarns of the same kind - traditions of Indians and the like , but with somethin' behind them , no doubt . The more you knew of that country , young fellah , the more you would understand that anythin ' was possible - ANYTHIN ' ! There are just some narrow water - lanes along which folk travel , and outside that it is all darkness . Now , down here in the Matto Grande "
23517	23666	23667	23667	he	617	" or up in this corner where three countries meet , nothin' would surprise me . As that chap said to - night , there are fifty - thousand miles of water - way runnin ' through a forest that is very near the size of Europe . You and I could be as far away from each other as Scotland is from Constantinople , and yet each of us be in the same great Brazilian forest . Man has just made a track here and a scrape there in the maze . Why , the river rises and falls the best part of forty feet , and half the country is a morass that you ca n't pass over . Why should n't somethin' new and wonderful lie in such a country ? And why should n't we be the men to find it out ? Besides , "
23679	23826	23667	23667	he	617	" there 's a sportin ' risk in every mile of it . I 'm like an old golf - ball - I 've had all the white paint knocked off me long ago . Life can whack me about now , and it ca n't leave a mark . But a sportin ' risk , young fellah , that 's the salt of existence . Then it 's worth livin ' again . We 're all gettin ' a deal too soft and dull and comfy . Give me the great waste lands and the wide spaces , with a gun in my fist and somethin' to look for that 's worth findin ' . I 've tried war and steeplechasin ' and aeroplanes , but this huntin ' of beasts that look like a lobster - supper dream is a brand - new sensation . "
24594	24599	24601	24601	he	142	" No thank you , "
24603	24953	24601	24601	he	142	" I should much prefer not to go aboard . I have only a few words to say to you , and they can very well be said where we are . I beg you not to imagine that I am in any way indebted to you for making this journey . I would have you to understand that it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , and I refuse to entertain the most remote sense of personal obligation . Truth is truth , and nothing which you can report can affect it in any way , though it may excite the emotions and allay the curiosity of a number of very ineffectual people . My directions for your instruction and guidance are in this sealed envelope . You will open it when you reach a town upon the Amazon which is called Manaos , but not until the date and hour which is marked upon the outside . Have I made myself clear ? I leave the strict observance of my conditions entirely to your honor . No , Mr. Malone , I will place no restriction upon your correspondence , since the ventilation of the facts is the object of your journey ; but I demand that you shall give no particulars as to your exact destination , and that nothing be actually published until your return . Good - bye , sir . You have done something to mitigate my feelings for the loathsome profession to which you unhappily belong . Good - bye , Lord John . Science is , as I understand , a sealed book to you ; but you may congratulate yourself upon the hunting - field which awaits you . You will , no doubt , have the opportunity of describing in the Field how you brought down the rocketing dimorphodon . And good - bye to you also , Professor Summerlee . If you are still capable of self - improvement , of which I am frankly unconvinced , you will surely return to London a wiser man . "

26453	26458	26459	26459	he	181	" What is there ? "
26468	26545	26459	26459	he	181	" Wood and marsh and unpenetrated jungle . Who knows what it may shelter ? And there to the south ? A wilderness of swampy forest , where no white man has ever been . The unknown is up against us on every side . Outside the narrow lines of the rivers what does anyone know ? Who will say what is possible in such a country ? Why should old man Challenger not be right ? "
27090	27113	27153	27153	he	182	" Instructions to Lord John Roxton and party . To be opened at Manaos upon July 15th , at 12 o'clock precisely . "
27126	27133	27135	27135	he	181	" We have seven more minutes , "
27137	27145	27135	27135	he	181	" The old dear is very precise . "
27163	27179	27181	27181	he	182	" What can it possibly matter whether we open it now or in seven minutes ? "
27183	27211	27181	27181	he	182	" It is all part and parcel of the same system of quackery and nonsense , for which I regret to say that the writer is notorious . "
27212	27227	27229	27230	Lord John	181	" Oh , come , we must play the game accordin ' to rules , "
27232	27267	27229	27230	Lord John	181	" It 's old man Challenger 's show and we are here by his good will , so it would be rotten bad form if we did n't follow his instructions to the letter . "
27268	27275	27277	27278	the Professor	2374	" A pretty business it is ! "
27282	27378	27277	27278	the Professor	2374	" It struck me as preposterous in London , but I 'm bound to say that it seems even more so upon closer acquaintance . I do n't know what is inside this envelope , but , unless it is something pretty definite , I shall be much tempted to take the next down - river boat and catch the Bolivia at Para . After all , I have some more responsible work in the world than to run about disproving the assertions of a lunatic . Now , Roxton , surely it is time . "
27379	27384	27386	27387	Lord John	181	" Time it is , "
27389	27396	27397	27397	He	181	" You can blow the whistle . "
27470	27477	27478	27478	he	182	" It is an open admission , "
27481	27514	27478	27478	he	182	" What more do you want ? The fellow is a self - confessed humbug . We have only to return home and report him as the brazen imposter that he is . "
27515	27519	27520	27520	I	0	" Invisible ink ! "
27523	27529	27531	27532	Lord Roxton	181	" I do n't think ! "
27541	27572	27531	27532	Lord Roxton	181	" No , young fellah my lad , there is no use deceiving yourself . I 'll go bail for it that nothing has ever been written upon this paper . "

27698	27702	27704	27704	he	142	" I fear , "
27711	27787	27704	27704	he	142	" that I am a few minutes too late . When I gave you this envelope I must confess that I had never intended that you should open it , for it had been my fixed intention to be with you before the hour . The unfortunate delay can be apportioned between a blundering pilot and an intrusive sandbank . I fear that it has given my colleague , Professor Summerlee , occasion to blaspheme . "
27788	27797	27799	27800	Lord John	181	" I am bound to say , sir , "
27808	27855	27799	27800	Lord John	181	" that your turning up is a considerable relief to us , for our mission seemed to have come to a premature end . Even now I ca n't for the life of me understand why you should have worked it in so extraordinary a manner . "
27897	27905	27906	27906	he	142	" Is all ready for your journey ? "
27909	27917	28055	28055	Challenger	142	" We can start to - morrow . "
27918	28027	28055	28055	Challenger	142	" Then so you shall . You need no chart of directions now , since you will have the inestimable advantage of my own guidance . From the first I had determined that I would myself preside over your investigation . The most elaborate charts would , as you will readily admit , be a poor substitute for my own intelligence and advice . As to the small ruse which I played upon you in the matter of the envelope , it is clear that , had I told you all my intentions , I should have been forced to resist unwelcome pressure to travel out with you . "
28028	28035	28037	28038	Professor Summerlee	182	" Not from me , sir ! "
28042	28054	28037	28038	Professor Summerlee	182	" So long as there was another ship upon the Atlantic . "
28065	28213	28055	28055	Challenger	142	" Your common sense will , I am sure , sustain my objection and realize that it was better that I should direct my own movements and appear only at the exact moment when my presence was needed . That moment has now arrived . You are in safe hands . You will not now fail to reach your destination . From henceforth I take command of this expedition , and I must ask you to complete your preparations to - night , so that we may be able to make an early start in the morning . My time is of value , and the same thing may be said , no doubt , in a lesser degree of your own . I propose , therefore , that we push on as rapidly as possible , until I have demonstrated what you have come to see . "

30675	30685	30670	30671	Lord John	181	" war drums . I have heard them before . "

30703	30727	30696	30696	Gomez	196	" Wild Indians , bravos , not mansos ; they watch us every mile of the way ; kill us if they can . "

31231	31253	31228	31228	Summerlee	182	" Like all such tribes , I shall expect to find them of poly - synthetic speech and of Mongolian type . "
31254	31258	31260	31260	Challenger	142	" Polysynthetic certainly , "
31264	31299	31260	31260	Challenger	142	" I am not aware that any other type of language exists in this continent , and I have notes of more than a hundred . The Mongolian theory I regard with deep suspicion . "
31300	31320	31322	31322	Summerlee	182	" I should have thought that even a limited knowledge of comparative anatomy would have helped to verify it , "
31342	31369	31333	31333	he	142	" No doubt , sir , a limited knowledge would have that effect . When one 's knowledge is exhaustive , one comes to other conclusions . "
31387	31401	31326	31326	Challenger	142	" We will kill you - we will kill you if we can . "
31673	31681	31682	31682	he	142	" What do you make of that ? "
31685	31693	31695	31695	Summerlee	182	" It is surely an Assai palm , "
31697	31785	31647	31647	he	142	" Exactly . It was an Assai palm which I took for my landmark . The secret opening is half a mile onwards upon the other side of the river . There is no break in the trees . That is the wonder and the mystery of it . There where you see light - green rushes instead of dark - green undergrowth , there between the great cotton woods , that is my private gate into the unknown . Push through , and you will understand . "
32256	32267	32269	32269	Gomez	196	" No Indian here . Too much afraid . Curupuri , "
32271	32280	32281	32282	Lord John	181	" Curupuri is the spirit of the woods , "
32285	32315	32281	32282	Lord John	181	" It 's a name for any kind of devil . The poor beggars think that there is something fearsome in this direction , and therefore they avoid it . "
32573	32580	32582	32582	Summerlee	182	" May I ask , sir , "
32588	32602	32582	32582	Summerlee	182	" in what capacity you take it upon yourself to issue these orders ? "
32608	32622	32582	32582	Summerlee	182	" I do it , Professor Summerlee , as leader of this expedition . "
32623	32643	32582	32582	Summerlee	182	" I am compelled to tell you , sir , that I do not recognize you in that capacity . "
32644	32647	32648	32648	Challenger	142	" Indeed ! "
32654	32663	32648	32648	Challenger	142	" Perhaps you would define my exact position . "
32664	32697	32582	32582	Summerlee	182	" Yes , sir . You are a man whose veracity is upon trial , and this committee is here to try it . You walk , sir , with your judges . "
32698	32702	32704	32704	Challenger	142	" Dear me ! "
32717	32754	32704	32704	Challenger	142	" In that case you will , of course , go on your way , and I will follow at my leisure . If I am not the leader you can not expect me to lead . "
33122	33140	33117	33119	the whole party	914	" trust the fallacious instincts of undeveloped savages rather than the highest product of modern European culture . "
33801	33807	33809	33809	Challenger	142	" Did you see it ? "
33814	33822	33809	33809	Challenger	142	" Summerlee , did you see it ? "
33836	33845	33846	33846	he	959	" What do you claim that it was ? "
33849	33860	33823	33824	His colleague	959	" To the best of my belief , a pterodactyl . "
33866	33872	33874	33874	he	182	" A pter - fiddlestick ! "
33876	33888	33874	33874	he	182	" It was a stork , if ever I saw one . "
33940	33951	33953	33953	he	181	" I focused it before it got over the trees , "
33955	33991	33953	33953	he	181	" I wo n't undertake to say what it was , but I 'll risk my reputation as a sportsman that it was n't any bird that ever I clapped eyes on in my life . "
34312	34319	34284	34284	I	0	" Who could have Foreseen it ? "
34851	34857	34859	34860	Professor Challenger	142	" It was on that , "
34867	34925	34859	34860	Professor Challenger	142	" that the pterodactyl was perched . I climbed half - way up the rock before I shot him . I am inclined to think that a good mountaineer like myself could ascend the rock to the top , though he would , of course , be no nearer to the plateau when he had done so . "
34996	35000	35002	35002	he	142	" Of course , "
35011	35053	35002	35002	he	142	" Professor Summerlee will understand that when I speak of a pterodactyl I mean a stork - only it is the kind of stork which has no feathers , a leathery skin , membranous wings , and teeth in its jaws . "
35282	35288	35290	35291	our leader	786	" I need not say , "
35293	35457	35290	35291	our leader	786	" that on the occasion of my last visit I exhausted every means of climbing the cliff , and where I failed I do not think that anyone else is likely to succeed , for I am something of a mountaineer . I had none of the appliances of a rock - climber with me , but I have taken the precaution to bring them now . With their aid I am positive I could climb that detached pinnacle to the summit ; but so long as the main cliff overhangs , it is vain to attempt ascending that . I was hurried upon my last visit by the approach of the rainy season and by the exhaustion of my supplies . These considerations limited my time , and I can only claim that I have surveyed about six miles of the cliff to the east of us , finding no possible way up . What , then , shall we now do ? "
35458	35468	35470	35471	Professor Summerlee	182	" There seems to be only one reasonable course , "
35473	35504	35470	35471	Professor Summerlee	182	" If you have explored the east , we should travel along the base of the cliff to the west , and seek for a practicable point for our ascent . "
35505	35510	35512	35513	Lord John	181	" That 's it , "
35515	35555	35512	35513	Lord John	181	" The odds are that this plateau is of no great size , and we shall travel round it until we either find an easy way up it , or come back to the point from which we started . "
35556	35567	35570	35570	he	142	" I have already explained to our young friend here , "
35589	35686	35570	35570	he	142	" that it is quite impossible that there should be an easy way up anywhere , for the simple reason that if there were the summit would not be isolated , and those conditions would not obtain which have effected so singular an interference with the general laws of survival . Yet I admit that there may very well be places where an expert human climber may reach the summit , and yet a cumbrous and heavy animal be unable to descend . It is certain that there is a point where an ascent is possible . "
35687	35696	35698	35698	Summerlee	182	" How do you know that , sir ? "
35702	35733	35570	35570	he	142	" Because my predecessor , the American Maple White , actually made such an ascent . How otherwise could he have seen the monster which he sketched in his notebook ? "
35734	35745	35747	35749	the stubborn Summerlee	182	" There you reason somewhat ahead of the proved facts , "
35751	35780	35747	35749	the stubborn Summerlee	182	" I admit your plateau , because I have seen it ; but I have not as yet satisfied myself that it contains any form of life whatever . "
35781	35819	35820	35820	He	1005	" What you admit , sir , or what you do not admit , is really of inconceivably small importance . I am glad to perceive that the plateau itself has actually obtruded itself upon your intelligence . "
35855	35859	35860	35860	he	1005	" Now sir ! "
35867	35882	35860	35860	he	1005	" Do I help you to realize that the plateau contains some animal life ? "
36001	36010	36012	36012	he	182	" I should be glad , Professor Challenger , "
36014	36055	36012	36012	he	182	" if you could see your way to make any remarks which may occur to you without seizing me by the chin . Even the appearance of a very ordinary rock python does not appear to justify such a liberty . "
36056	36068	36069	36070	his colleague	959	" But there is life upon the plateau all the same , "
36075	36124	36069	36070	his colleague	959	" And now , having demonstrated this important conclusion so that it is clear to anyone , however prejudiced or obtuse , I am of opinion that we can not do better than break up our camp and travel to westward until we find some means of ascent . "
36178	36181	36222	36222	Challenger	142	" Brandy , "
36216	36220	36222	36222	Challenger	142	" Not mine , "
36224	36232	36222	36222	Challenger	142	" It must be Maple White 's . "
36250	36258	36260	36260	he	181	" I say , look at this , "
36262	36274	36260	36260	he	181	" I believe it is meant for a sign - post . "
36297	36305	36307	36307	Challenger	142	" Most certainly a sign - post , "
36309	36353	36307	36307	Challenger	142	" What else ? Finding himself upon a dangerous errand , our pioneer has left this sign so that any party which follows him may know the way he has taken . Perhaps we shall come upon some other indications as we proceed . "
36575	36584	36895	36896	Lord John	181	" J. C. , from A. E. S. , "
36607	36613	36615	36616	Lord John	181	" Who can he be ? "
36618	36632	36615	36616	Lord John	181	" Poor devil ! every bone in his body seems to be broken . "
36633	36643	36645	36645	Summerlee	182	" And the bamboo grows through his smashed ribs , "
36647	36679	36645	36645	Summerlee	182	" It is a fast - growing plant , but it is surely inconceivable that this body could have been here while the canes grew to be twenty feet in length . "
36680	36688	36690	36691	Professor Challenger	142	" As to the man 's identity , "
36693	36889	36690	36691	Professor Challenger	142	" I have no doubt whatever upon that point . As I made my way up the river before I reached you at the fazenda I instituted very particular inquiries about Maple White . At Para they knew nothing . Fortunately , I had a definite clew , for there was a particular picture in his sketch - book which showed him taking lunch with a certain ecclesiastic at Rosario . This priest I was able to find , and though he proved a very argumentative fellow , who took it absurdly amiss that I should point out to him the corrosive effect which modern science must have upon his beliefs , he none the less gave me some positive information . Maple White passed Rosario four years ago , or two years before I saw his dead body . He was not alone at the time , but there was a friend , an American named James Colver , who remained in the boat and did not meet this ecclesiastic . I think , therefore , that there can be no doubt that we are now looking upon the remains of this James Colver . "
36890	36893	36895	36896	Lord John	181	" Nor , "
36898	36956	36895	36896	Lord John	181	" is there much doubt as to how he met his death . He has fallen or been chucked from the top , and so been impaled . How else could he come by his broken bones , and how could he have been stuck through by these canes with their points so high above our heads ? "
37130	37135	37137	37138	Professor Challenger	142	" Maple White again , "
37140	37154	37137	37138	Professor Challenger	142	" He had some presentiment that worthy footsteps would follow close behind him . "
37155	37162	37137	37138	Professor Challenger	142	" He had chalk , then ? "
37163	37191	37137	37138	Professor Challenger	142	" A box of colored chalks was among the effects I found in his knapsack . I remember that the white one was worn to a stump . "
37192	37199	37201	37201	Summerlee	182	" That is certainly good evidence , "
37203	37217	37201	37201	Summerlee	182	" We can only accept his guidance and follow on to the westward . "
37751	37756	37758	37758	he	181	" It 's blocked ! "
37782	37789	37762	37762	him	181	" The roof has fallen in ! "
38908	38912	38914	38914	he	182	" Professor Challenger , "
38926	38954	38914	38914	he	182	" I owe you an apology . Sir , I am very much in the wrong , and I beg that you will forget what is past . "
39423	39426	39428	39428	I	0	" Surely , "
39436	39458	39428	39428	I	0	" the rain must find its way down somehow . There are bound to be water - channels in the rocks . "
39459	39468	39470	39471	Professor Challenger	142	" Our young friend has glimpses of lucidity , "
39479	39486	39487	39487	I	0	" The rain must go somewhere , "
39490	39521	39470	39471	Professor Challenger	142	" He keeps a firm grip upon actuality . The only drawback is that we have conclusively proved by ocular demonstration that there are no water channels down the rocks . "
39522	39531	39532	39532	I	0	" Where , then , does it go ? "
39535	39555	39428	39428	I	0	" I think it may be fairly assumed that if it does not come outwards it must run inwards . "
39556	39566	39470	39471	Professor Challenger	142	" Then there is a lake in the center . "
39567	39573	39428	39428	I	0	" So I should suppose . "
39574	39589	39591	39591	Summerlee	182	" It is more than likely that the lake may be an old crater , "
39593	39652	39591	39591	Summerlee	182	" The whole formation is , of course , highly volcanic . But , however that may be , I should expect to find the surface of the plateau slope inwards with a considerable sheet of water in the center , which may drain off , by some subterranean channel , into the marshes of the Jaracaca Swamp . "
39653	39661	39663	39663	Challenger	142	" Or evaporation might preserve an equilibrium , "
39994	40019	39986	39986	his	142	" I know that I deserve all that you can say , but I pray you to spare my blushes by not saying it . "
40075	40078	40079	40079	he	142	" Eureka ! "
40089	40108	40082	40082	his	142	" Gentlemen , you may congratulate me and we may congratulate each other . The problem is solved . "
40109	40117	40133	40133	he	142	" You have found a way up ? "
40118	40125	40082	40082	his	142	" I venture to think so . "
40126	40130	40133	40133	he	142	" And where ? "
40183	40190	40191	40191	I	0	" We can never get across , "
40194	40204	40206	40206	he	142	" We can at least all reach the summit , "
40208	40232	40206	40206	he	142	" When we are up I may be able to show you that the resources of an inventive mind are not yet exhausted . "
40633	40641	40643	40643	he	2374	" This way , my young friend , "
40645	40661	40643	40643	he	2374	" vestigia nulla retrorsum . Never look rearwards , but always to our glorious goal . "
40779	40785	40791	40792	Professor Summerlee	182	" This is indeed curious , "
40828	40831	40832	40832	I	0	" Why , "
40835	40841	40832	40832	I	0	" it 's a beech ! "
40842	40845	40847	40847	Summerlee	182	" Exactly , "
40849	40859	40847	40847	Summerlee	182	" A fellow - countryman in a far land . "
40860	40872	40874	40874	Challenger	142	" Not only a fellow - countryman , my good sir , "
40876	40905	40874	40874	Challenger	142	" but also , if I may be allowed to enlarge your simile , an ally of the first value . This beech tree will be our saviour . "
40906	40910	40912	40913	Lord John	181	" By George ! "
40915	40919	40912	40913	Lord John	181	" a bridge ! "
40920	41025	40874	40874	Challenger	142	" Exactly , my friends , a bridge ! It is not for nothing that I expended an hour last night in focusing my mind upon the situation . I have some recollection of once remarking to our young friend here that G. E. C. is at his best when his back is to the wall . Last night you will admit that all our backs were to the wall . But where will - power and intellect go together , there is always a way out . A drawbridge had to be found which could be dropped across the abyss . Behold it ! "
41078	41088	41090	41090	he	142	" Our young friend has the thews and sinews , "
41092	41132	41090	41090	he	142	" I think he will be the most useful at this task . I must beg , however , that you will kindly refrain from thinking for yourself , and that you will do exactly what you are told . "
41305	41311	41313	41313	he	142	" I claim the honor , "
41315	41340	41313	41313	he	142	" to be the first to cross to the unknown land - a fitting subject , no doubt , for some future historical painting . "
41356	41361	41363	41363	he	181	" My dear chap , "
41365	41373	41363	41363	he	181	" I really can not allow it . "
41374	41382	41341	41341	He	142	" Can not allow it , sir ! "
41392	41439	41363	41363	he	181	" When it is a matter of science , do n't you know , I follow your lead because you are by way of bein ' a man of science . But it 's up to you to follow me when you come into my department . "
41440	41446	41363	41363	he	181	" Your department , sir ? "
41447	41510	41363	41363	he	181	" We all have our professions , and soldierin ' is mine . We are , accordin ' to my ideas , invadin ' a new country , which may or may not be chock - full of enemies of sorts . To barge blindly into it for want of a little common sense and patience is n't my notion of management . "
41530	41540	41363	41363	he	181	" Well , sir , what do you propose ? "
41541	41564	41566	41567	Lord John	181	" For all I know there may be a tribe of cannibals waitin ' for lunch - time among those very bushes , "
41574	41675	41566	41567	Lord John	181	" It 's better to learn wisdom before you get into a cookin'-pot ; so we will content ourselves with hopin ' that there is no trouble waitin ' for us , and at the same time we will act as if there were . Malone and I will go down again , therefore , and we will fetch up the four rifles , together with Gomez and the other . One man can then go across and the rest will cover him with guns , until he sees that it is safe for the whole crowd to come along . "
41788	41804	41806	41807	Lord John	181	" Now , Challenger , if you really insist upon being the first man in , "
41815	41827	41829	41831	the angry Professor	1157	" I am much indebted to you for your gracious permission , "
41846	41872	41829	41831	the angry Professor	1157	" Since you are good enough to allow it , I shall most certainly take it upon myself to act as pioneer upon this occasion . "
41919	41923	41924	41924	he	142	" At last ! "
41927	41931	41924	41924	he	142	" at last ! "
42331	42335	42336	42336	he	196	" Lord Roxton ! "
42339	42344	42336	42336	he	196	" Lord John Roxton ! "
42345	42348	42350	42351	our companion	1127	" Well , "
42353	42358	42350	42351	our companion	1127	" here I am . "
42368	42428	42336	42336	he	196	" Yes , there you are , you English dog , and there you will remain ! I have waited and waited , and now has come my chance . You found it hard to get up ; you will find it harder to get down . You cursed fools , you are trapped , every one of you ! "
42482	42494	42495	42495	he	1176	" We nearly killed you with a stone at the cave , "
42498	42574	42495	42495	he	1176	" but this is better . It is slower and more terrible . Your bones will whiten up there , and none will know where you lie or come to cover them . As you lie dying , think of Lopez , whom you shot five years ago on the Putomayo River . I am his brother , and , come what will I will die happy now , for his memory has been avenged . "
42740	42748	42750	42750	he	181	" I have been a blind simpleton , "
42754	42791	42750	42750	he	181	" It 's my folly that has brought you all into this trouble . I should have remembered that these people have long memories for blood - feuds , and have been more upon my guard . "
42792	42812	42750	42750	he	181	" What about the other one ? It took two of them to lever that tree over the edge . "
42813	42860	42750	42750	he	181	" I could have shot him , but I let him go . He may have had no part in it . Perhaps it would have been better if I had killed him , for he must , as you say , have lent a hand . "
43273	43279	43280	43280	he	195	" What I do now ? "
43283	43292	43280	43280	he	195	" You tell me and I do it . "
43332	43336	43337	43337	he	195	" No no ! "
43340	43389	43337	43337	he	195	" I not leave you . Whatever come , you always find me here . But no able to keep Indians . Already they say too much Curupuri live on this place , and they go home . Now you leave them me no able to keep them . "
43436	43447	43448	43448	I	0	" Make them wait till to - morrow , Zambo , "
43451	43461	43448	43448	I	0	" then I can send letter back by them . "
43462	43477	43479	43480	the negro	1220	" Very good , sarr ! I promise they wait till to - morrow , "
43482	43491	43479	43480	the negro	1220	" But what I do for you now ? "
43987	43994	43945	43945	Our	1190	" The most Wonderful Things have Happened "
44333	44337	44339	44339	Summerlee	182	" Most interesting , "
44346	44361	44339	44339	Summerlee	182	" An enormous blood - tick , as yet , I believe , unclassified . "
44362	44371	44373	44373	Challenger	142	" The first - fruits of our labors , "
44381	44445	44373	44373	Challenger	142	" We can not do less than call it Ixodes Maloni . The very small inconvenience of being bitten , my young friend , can not , I am sure , weigh with you as against the glorious privilege of having your name inscribed in the deathless roll of zoology . Unhappily you have crushed this fine specimen at the moment of satiation . "
44446	44450	44451	44451	I	0	" Filthy vermin ! "
44472	44485	44487	44487	he	142	" You should cultivate the scientific eye and the detached scientific mind , "
44489	44563	44487	44487	he	142	" To a man of philosophic temperament like myself the blood - tick , with its lancet - like proboscis and its distending stomach , is as beautiful a work of Nature as the peacock or , for that matter , the aurora borealis . It pains me to hear you speak of it in so unappreciative a fashion . No doubt , with due diligence , we can secure some other specimen . "
44564	44573	44575	44575	Summerlee	182	" There can be no doubt of that , "
44579	44591	44575	44575	Summerlee	182	" for one has just disappeared behind your shirt - collar . "
45267	45285	45287	45287	he	181	" So long as neither man nor beast has seen or heard us , we are safe , "
45289	45350	45287	45287	he	181	" From the time they know we are here our troubles begin . There are no signs that they have found us out as yet . So our game surely is to lie low for a time and spy out the land . We want to have a good look at our neighbors before we get on visitin ' terms . "
45351	45357	45358	45358	I	0	" But we must advance , "
45363	45416	45287	45287	he	181	" By all means , sonny my boy ! We will advance . But with common sense . We must never go so far that we ca n't get back to our base . Above all , we must never , unless it is life or death , fire off our guns . "
45417	45423	45425	45425	Summerlee	182	" But YOU fired yesterday , "
45427	45485	45287	45287	he	181	" Well , it could n't be helped . However , the wind was strong and blew outwards . It is not likely that the sound could have traveled far into the plateau . By the way , what shall we call this place ? I suppose it is up to us to give it a name ? "
45502	45510	45512	45512	he	182	" It can only have one name , "
45514	45531	45512	45512	he	182	" It is called after the pioneer who discovered it . It is Maple White Land . "
45940	45945	45947	45947	he	181	" Look at this ! "
45949	45965	45947	45947	he	181	" By George , this must be the trail of the father of all birds ! "
46063	46074	46076	46076	he	181	" I 'll stake my good name as a shikarree , "
46078	46121	46076	46076	he	181	" that the track is a fresh one . The creature has not passed ten minutes . Look how the water is still oozing into that deeper print ! By Jove ! See , here is the mark of a little one ! "
46140	46149	46151	46152	Professor Summerlee	182	" But what do you make of this ? "
46179	46182	46184	46184	Challenger	142	" Wealden ! "
46190	46238	46184	46184	Challenger	142	" I 've seen them in the Wealden clay . It is a creature walking erect upon three - toed feet , and occasionally putting one of its five - fingered forepaws upon the ground . Not a bird , my dear Roxton - not a bird . "
46239	46243	46293	46293	His	181	" A beast ? "
46244	46292	46184	46184	Challenger	142	" No ; a reptile - a dinosaur . Nothing else could have left such a track . They puzzled a worthy Sussex doctor some ninety years ago ; but who in the world could have hoped - hoped - to have seen a sight like that ? "
46916	46920	46921	46921	he	142	" Nunc dimittis ! "
46926	46936	46921	46921	he	142	" What will they say in England of this ? "
46937	46957	46959	46959	Challenger	142	" My dear Summerlee , I will tell you with great confidence exactly what they will say in England , "
46961	46985	46959	46959	Challenger	142	" They will say that you are an infernal liar and a scientific charlatan , exactly as you and others said of me . "
46986	46993	46921	46921	he	142	" In the face of photographs ? "
46994	47002	46959	46959	Challenger	142	" Faked , Summerlee ! Clumsily faked ! "
47003	47010	46921	46921	he	142	" In the face of specimens ? "
47011	47074	46959	46959	Challenger	142	" Ah , there we may have them ! Malone and his filthy Fleet Street crew may be all yelping our praises yet . August the twenty - eighth - the day we saw five live iguanodons in a glade of Maple White Land . Put it down in your diary , my young friend , and send it to your rag . "
47075	47092	47094	47095	Lord John	181	" And be ready to get the toe - end of the editorial boot in return , "
47097	47164	47094	47095	Lord John	181	" Things look a bit different from the latitude of London , young fellah my lad . There 's many a man who never tells his adventures , for he ca n't hope to be believed . Who 's to blame them ? For this will seem a bit of a dream to ourselves in a month or two . WHAT did you say they were ? "
47165	47168	47170	47170	Summerlee	182	" Iguanodons , "
47172	47239	47170	47170	Summerlee	182	" You 'll find their footmarks all over the Hastings sands , in Kent , and in Sussex . The South of England was alive with them when there was plenty of good lush green - stuff to keep them going . Conditions have changed , and the beasts died . Here it seems that the conditions have not changed , and the beasts have lived . "
47240	47258	47260	47261	Lord John	181	" If ever we get out of this alive , I must have a head with me , "
47263	47310	47260	47261	Lord John	181	" Lord , how some of that Somaliland - Uganda crowd would turn a beautiful pea - green if they saw it ! I do n't know what you chaps think , but it strikes me that we are on mighty thin ice all this time . "
48425	48434	48440	48440	his	181	" Make for the wood and keep together , "
48443	48449	48436	48437	Lord John	181	" The brutes mean mischief . "
48673	48676	48678	48679	Lord John	181	" Now , "
48681	48687	48678	48679	Lord John	181	" now for our lives ! "
48821	48829	48831	48831	Challenger	142	" A most interesting and convincing experience , "
48846	48864	48831	48831	Challenger	142	" We are exceptionally well informed , Summerlee , as to the habits of the enraged pterodactyl . "
48914	48920	48921	48921	Challenger	142	" It is worth noting , "
48924	48978	48921	48921	Challenger	142	" that our young friend has received an undoubted stab , while Lord John 's coat could only have been torn by a bite . In my own case , I was beaten about the head by their wings , so we have had a remarkable exhibition of their various methods of offence . "
48979	48990	48992	48993	Lord John	181	" It has been touch and go for our lives , "
48997	49038	48992	48993	Lord John	181	" and I could not think of a more rotten sort of death than to be outed by such filthy vermin . I was sorry to fire my rifle , but , by Jove ! there was no great choice . "
49039	49050	49052	49052	I	0	" We should not be here if you had n't , "
49057	49064	49066	49066	he	142	" It may do no harm , "
49068	49142	49066	49066	he	142	" Among these woods there must be many loud cracks from splitting or falling trees which would be just like the sound of a gun . But now , if you are of my opinion , we have had thrills enough for one day , and had best get back to the surgical box at the camp for some carbolic . Who knows what venom these beasts may have in their hideous jaws ? "
49417	49427	49428	49428	he	195	" All well , Massa Challenger , all well ! "
49431	49447	49428	49428	he	195	" Me stay here . No fear . You always find me when you want . "
49658	49664	49666	49666	he	181	" I say , Malone , "
49668	49679	49666	49666	he	181	" do you remember that place where those beasts were ? "
49680	49684	49650	49651	Lord John	181	" Very clearly . "
49685	49696	49666	49666	he	181	" A sort of volcanic pit , was it not ? "
49697	49700	49702	49702	I.	0	" Exactly , "
49703	49710	49666	49666	he	181	" Did you notice the soil ? "
49711	49714	49666	49666	he	181	" Rocks . "
49715	49726	49666	49666	he	181	" But round the water - where the reeds were ? "
49727	49739	49666	49666	he	181	" It was a bluish soil . It looked like clay . "
49740	49751	49666	49666	he	181	" Exactly . A volcanic tube full of blue clay . "
49752	49757	49758	49758	I	0	" What of that ? "
49761	49768	49770	49770	he	181	" Oh , nothing , nothing , "
49834	49844	49829	49829	him	181	" Blue clay - clay in a volcanic tube ! "
49862	49869	49876	49876	he	181	" For once I was the Hero "
50489	50494	50495	50495	I	0	" What was it ? "
50498	50506	50508	50509	Lord John	181	" We shall know in the morning , "
50511	50524	50508	50509	Lord John	181	" It was close to us - not farther than the glade . "
50525	50564	50566	50566	Challenger	142	" We have been privileged to overhear a prehistoric tragedy , the sort of drama which occurred among the reeds upon the border of some Jurassic lagoon , when the greater dragon pinned the lesser among the slime , "
50580	50656	50566	50566	Challenger	142	" It was surely well for man that he came late in the order of creation . There were powers abroad in earlier days which no courage and no mechanism of his could have met . What could his sling , his throwing - stick , or his arrow avail him against such forces as have been loose to - night ? Even with a modern rifle it would be all odds on the monster . "
50657	50667	50669	50670	Lord John	181	" I think I should back my little friend , "
50676	50688	50669	50670	Lord John	181	" But the beast would certainly have a good sporting chance . "
50694	50697	50698	50698	he	182	" Hush ! "
50701	50707	50698	50698	he	182	" Surely I hear something ? "
50811	50815	50816	50816	he	181	" By George ! "
50819	50827	50816	50816	he	181	" I think I can see it ! "
50952	50961	50963	50963	I	0	" I believe it is going to spring ! "
50969	50978	50980	50981	Lord John	181	" Do n't fire ! Do n't fire ! "
50983	51006	50980	50981	Lord John	181	" The crash of a gun in this silent night would be heard for miles . Keep it as a last card . "
51007	51018	51020	51020	Summerlee	182	" If it gets over the hedge we 're done , "
51034	51043	51045	51046	Lord John	181	" No , it must not get over , "
51048	51073	51045	51046	Lord John	181	" but hold your fire to the last . Perhaps I can make something of the fellow . I 'll chance it , anyhow . "
51205	51215	51223	51223	he	181	" I thought he would n't face the fire , "
51234	51244	51245	51245	we	1390	" You should not have taken such a risk ! "
51249	51332	51245	51245	we	1390	" There was nothin' else to be done . If he had got among us we should have shot each other in tryin ' to down him . On the other hand , if we had fired through the hedge and wounded him he would soon have been on the top of us - to say nothin' of giving ourselves away . On the whole , I think that we are jolly well out of it . What was he , then ? "
51344	51358	51360	51360	Summerlee	182	" Personally , I am unable to classify the creature with any certainty , "
51369	51384	51386	51386	Challenger	142	" In refusing to commit yourself you are but showing a proper scientific reserve , "
51392	51442	51386	51386	Challenger	142	" I am not myself prepared to go farther than to say in general terms that we have almost certainly been in contact to - night with some form of carnivorous dinosaur . I have already expressed my anticipation that something of the sort might exist upon this plateau . "
51443	51451	51453	51453	Summerlee	182	" We have to bear in mind , "
51455	51491	51453	51453	Summerlee	182	" that there are many prehistoric forms which have never come down to us . It would be rash to suppose that we can give a name to all that we are likely to meet . "
51492	51529	51386	51386	Challenger	142	" Exactly . A rough classification may be the best that we can attempt . To - morrow some further evidence may help us to an identification . Meantime we can only renew our interrupted slumbers . "
51530	51537	51539	51540	Lord John	181	" But not without a sentinel , "
51545	51572	51539	51540	Lord John	181	" We ca n't afford to take chances in a country like this . Two - hour spells in the future , for each of us . "
51573	51587	51589	51590	Professor Summerlee	182	" Then I 'll just finish my pipe in starting the first one , "
51742	51751	51753	51754	Professor Challenger	142	" Our judgment must still be in abeyance , "
51769	51820	51753	51754	Professor Challenger	142	" The indications would be consistent with the presence of a saber - toothed tiger , such as are still found among the breccia of our caverns ; but the creature actually seen was undoubtedly of a larger and more reptilian character . Personally , I should pronounce for allosaurus . "
51821	51825	51827	51827	Summerlee	182	" Or megalosaurus , "
51829	51869	51870	51870	He	142	" Exactly . Any one of the larger carnivorous dinosaurs would meet the case . Among them are to be found all the most terrible types of animal life that have ever cursed the earth or blessed a museum . "
51903	51910	51912	51913	Lord Roxton	181	" The less noise the better , "
51917	51966	51912	51913	Lord Roxton	181	" We do n't know who or what may be near us . If this fellah comes back for his breakfast and catches us here we wo n't have so much to laugh at . By the way , what is this mark upon the iguanodon 's hide ? "
52054	52076	52078	52078	he	142	" If your lordship will graciously permit me to open my mouth , I shall be happy to express my sentiments , "
52084	52127	52078	52078	he	142	" I am not in the habit of being taken to task in the fashion which seems to be customary with your lordship . I was not aware that it was necessary to ask your permission before smiling at a harmless pleasantry . "
52194	52201	52203	52203	he	142	" With regard to the marking , "
52205	52475	52203	52203	he	142	" I am inclined to agree with my friend and colleague , Professor Summerlee , that the stains are from asphalt . As this plateau is , in its very nature , highly volcanic , and as asphalt is a substance which one associates with Plutonic forces , I can not doubt that it exists in the free liquid state , and that the creatures may have come in contact with it . A much more important problem is the question as to the existence of the carnivorous monster which has left its traces in this glade . We know roughly that this plateau is not larger than an average English county . Within this confined space a certain number of creatures , mostly types which have passed away in the world below , have lived together for innumerable years . Now , it is very clear to me that in so long a period one would have expected that the carnivorous creatures , multiplying unchecked , would have exhausted their food supply and have been compelled to either modify their flesh - eating habits or die of hunger . This we see has not been so . We can only imagine , therefore , that the balance of Nature is preserved by some check which limits the numbers of these ferocious creatures . One of the many interesting problems , therefore , which await our solution is to discover what that check may be and how it operates . I venture to trust that we may have some future opportunity for the closer study of the carnivorous dinosaurs . "
52476	52486	52487	52487	I	0	" And I venture to trust we may not , "
52510	52521	52522	52522	he	2374	" Perhaps Professor Summerlee may have an observation to make , "
53127	53147	53149	53149	he	182	" What we ought to be doing to - day , to - morrow , and all the time , "
53151	53192	53149	53149	he	182	" is finding some way out of the trap into which we have fallen . You are all turning your brains towards getting into this country . I say that we should be scheming how to get out of it . "
53193	53200	53202	53202	Challenger	142	" I am surprised , sir , "
53209	53279	53202	53202	Challenger	142	" that any man of science should commit himself to so ignoble a sentiment . You are in a land which offers such an inducement to the ambitious naturalist as none ever has since the world began , and you suggest leaving it before we have acquired more than the most superficial knowledge of it or of its contents . I expected better things of you , Professor Summerlee . "
53280	53285	53287	53287	Summerlee	182	" You must remember , "
53291	53344	53287	53287	Summerlee	182	" that I have a large class in London who are at present at the mercy of an extremely inefficient locum tenens . This makes my situation different from yours , Professor Challenger , since , so far as I know , you have never been entrusted with any responsible educational work . "
53345	53349	53351	53351	Challenger	142	" Quite so , "
53353	53394	53351	53351	Challenger	142	" I have felt it to be a sacrilege to divert a brain which is capable of the highest original research to any lesser object . That is why I have sternly set my face against any proffered scholastic appointment . "
53395	53399	53401	53401	Summerlee	182	" For example ? "
53416	53421	53423	53423	he	142	" I must say , "
53425	53457	53423	53423	he	142	" that I think it would be a mighty poor thing to go back to London before I know a great deal more of this place than I do at present . "
53458	53477	53351	53351	Challenger	142	" I could never dare to walk into the back office of my paper and face old McArdle , "
53495	53535	53480	53480	You	1430	" He 'd never forgive me for leaving such unexhausted copy behind me . Besides , so far as I can see it is not worth discussing , since we ca n't get down , even if we wanted . "
53536	53555	53557	53557	Challenger	142	" Our young friend makes up for many obvious mental lacunae by some measure of primitive common sense , "
53559	53597	53557	53557	Challenger	142	" The interests of his deplorable profession are immaterial to us ; but , as he observes , we can not get down in any case , so it is a waste of energy to discuss it . "
53598	53610	53612	53612	Summerlee	182	" It is a waste of energy to do anything else , "
53618	53798	53612	53612	Summerlee	182	" Let me remind you that we came here upon a perfectly definite mission , entrusted to us at the meeting of the Zoological Institute in London . That mission was to test the truth of Professor Challenger 's statements . Those statements , as I am bound to admit , we are now in a position to endorse . Our ostensible work is therefore done . As to the detail which remains to be worked out upon this plateau , it is so enormous that only a large expedition , with a very special equipment , could hope to cope with it . Should we attempt to do so ourselves , the only possible result must be that we shall never return with the important contribution to science which we have already gained . Professor Challenger has devised means for getting us on to this plateau when it appeared to be inaccessible ; I think that we should now call upon him to use the same ingenuity in getting us back to the world from which we came . "
53843	53857	53859	53859	he	142	" The problem of the descent is at first sight a formidable one , "
53861	53947	53859	53859	he	142	" and yet I can not doubt that the intellect can solve it . I am prepared to agree with our colleague that a protracted stay in Maple White Land is at present inadvisable , and that the question of our return will soon have to be faced . I absolutely refuse to leave , however , until we have made at least a superficial examination of this country , and are able to take back with us something in the nature of a chart . "
53956	53966	53968	53968	he	142	" We have spent two long days in exploration , "
53970	54059	53968	53968	he	142	" and we are no wiser as to the actual geography of the place than when we started . It is clear that it is all thickly wooded , and it would take months to penetrate it and to learn the relations of one part to another . If there were some central peak it would be different , but it all slopes downwards , so far as we can see . The farther we go the less likely it is that we will get any general view . "
54228	54233	54235	54235	Challenger	142	" Our young friend , "
54246	54278	54235	54235	Challenger	142	" is capable of acrobatic exertions which would be impossible to a man of a more solid , though possibly of a more commanding , appearance . I applaud his resolution . "
54279	54294	54296	54297	Lord John	181	" By George , young fellah , you 've put your hand on it ! "
54305	54370	54296	54297	Lord John	181	" How we never came to think of it before I ca n't imagine ! There 's not more than an hour of daylight left , but if you take your notebook you may be able to get some rough sketch of the place . If we put these three ammunition cases under the branch , I will soon hoist you on to it . "
54830	54836	54838	54838	Roxton	181	" What 's the matter ? "
54842	54848	54838	54838	Roxton	181	" Anything wrong with you ? "
54849	54855	54856	54856	I	0	" Did you see it ? "
54871	54888	54838	54838	Roxton	181	" We heard a row , as if your foot had slipped . What was it ? "
55572	55581	55583	55583	I.	0	" He has been there all the time , "
55584	55591	55593	55594	Lord John	181	" How do you know that ? "
55596	55621	55593	55594	Lord John	181	" Because I have never been without that feeling that something malevolent was watching us . I mentioned it to you , Professor Challenger . "
55622	55656	55593	55594	Lord John	181	" Our young friend certainly said something of the kind . He is also the one among us who is endowed with that Celtic temperament which would make him sensitive to such impressions . "
55657	55665	55667	55667	Summerlee	182	" The whole theory of telepathy - - "
55673	55682	55684	55684	Challenger	142	" Is too vast to be now discussed , "
55689	55695	55696	55696	he	182	" Tell me , now , "
55711	55728	55696	55696	he	182	" did you happen to observe whether the creature could cross its thumb over its palm ? "
55729	55734	55593	55594	Lord John	181	" No , indeed . "
55735	55741	55696	55696	he	182	" Had it a tail ? "
55742	55745	55593	55594	Lord John	181	" No . "
55746	55752	55696	55696	he	182	" Was the foot prehensile ? "
55753	55779	55593	55594	Lord John	181	" I do not think it could have made off so fast among the branches if it could not get a grip with its feet . "
55780	55854	55855	55855	I	0	" In South America there are , if my memory serves me - you will check the observation , Professor Summerlee - some thirty - six species of monkeys , but the anthropoid ape is unknown . It is clear , however , that he exists in this country , and that he is not the hairy , gorilla - like variety , which is never seen out of Africa or the East . "
55877	55953	55868	55868	I	0	" This is a whiskered and colorless type , the latter characteristic pointing to the fact that he spends his days in arboreal seclusion . The question which we have to face is whether he approaches more closely to the ape or the man . In the latter case , he may well approximate to what the vulgar have called the ' missing link . ' The solution of this problem is our immediate duty . "
55954	55962	55964	55964	Summerlee	182	" It is nothing of the sort , "
55968	55980	55964	55964	Summerlee	182	" Now that , through the intelligence and activity of Mr. Malone "
55989	56015	55964	55964	Summerlee	182	" we have got our chart , our one and only immediate duty is to get ourselves safe and sound out of this awful place . "
56016	56024	56026	56026	Challenger	142	" The flesh - pots of civilization , "
56028	56073	55868	55868	I	0	" The ink - pots of civilization , sir . It is our task to put on record what we have seen , and to leave the further exploration to others . You all agreed as much before Mr. Malone got us the chart . "
56074	56077	56079	56079	Challenger	142	" Well , "
56081	56165	56079	56079	Challenger	142	" I admit that my mind will be more at ease when I am assured that the result of our expedition has been conveyed to our friends . How we are to get down from this place I have not as yet an idea . I have never yet encountered any problem , however , which my inventive brain was unable to solve , and I promise you that to - morrow I will turn my attention to the question of our descent . "
56234	56241	56242	56242	he	142	" What shall we call it ? "
56245	56259	56261	56261	Summerlee	182	" Why should you not take the chance of perpetuating your own name ? "
56270	56289	56291	56291	Challenger	142	" I trust , sir , that my name will have other and more personal claims upon posterity , "
56295	56320	56291	56291	Challenger	142	" Any ignoramus can hand down his worthless memory by imposing it upon a mountain or a river . I need no such monument . "
56342	56357	56359	56359	he	142	" It 's up to you , young fellah , to name the lake , "
56361	56391	56359	56359	he	142	" You saw it first , and , by George , if you choose to put ' Lake Malone ' on it , no one has a better right . "
56392	56406	56408	56408	Challenger	142	" By all means . Let our young friend give it a name , "
56410	56413	56415	56415	I	0	" Then , "
56428	56436	56415	56415	I	0	" let it be named Lake Gladys . "
56437	56450	56452	56452	Summerlee	182	" Do n't you think the Central Lake would be more descriptive ? "
56454	56461	56415	56415	I	0	" I should prefer Lake Gladys . "
56477	56483	56485	56485	he	142	" Boys will be boys , "

62616	62644	62565	62565	he	195	" You get creepers from trees , Massa Malone . Throw them over here . I make fast to this stump , and so you have bridge . "

Half a dozen tins will do . That 's all right ! Do n't wait to talk or think . Get a move on , or we are done ! "
63723	63726	63727	63727	he	181	" There ! "
63730	63762	63727	63727	he	181	" I think we are safe here . They 'll make for the camp as sure as fate . It will be their first idea . But this should puzzle 'em . "

63881	63885	63887	63887	he	181	" Pretty bad , "
63900	63950	63887	63887	he	181	" It is n't quite the place for a rest cure . What ? But I had no idea what its possibilities were until those devils got hold of us . The man - eatin ' Papuans had me once , but they are Chesterfields compared to this crowd . "
63951	63957	63958	63958	I	0	" How did it happen ? "
63961	64273	63887	63887	he	181	" It was in the early mornin ' . Our learned friends were just stirrin ' . Had n't even begun to argue yet . Suddenly it rained apes . They came down as thick as apples out of a tree . They had been assemblin ' in the dark , I suppose , until that great tree over our heads was heavy with them . I shot one of them through the belly , but before we knew where we were they had us spread - eagled on our backs . I call them apes , but they carried sticks and stones in their hands and jabbered talk to each other , and ended up by tyin ' our hands with creepers , so they are ahead of any beast that I have seen in my wanderin 's . Ape - men - that 's what they are - Missin ' Links , and I wish they had stayed missin ' . They carried off their wounded comrade - he was bleedin ' like a pig - and then they sat around us , and if ever I saw frozen murder it was in their faces . They were big fellows , as big as a man and a deal stronger . Curious glassy gray eyes they have , under red tufts , and they just sat and gloated and gloated . Challenger is no chicken , but even he was cowed . He managed to struggle to his feet , and yelled out at them to have done with it and get it over . I think he had gone a bit off his head at the suddenness of it , for he raged and cursed at them like a lunatic . If they had been a row of his favorite Pressmen he could not have slanged them worse . "
64274	64282	64283	64283	I	0	" Well , what did they do ? "
64319	64638	64312	64312	his	420	" I thought it was the end of us , but instead of that it started them on a new line . They all jabbered and chattered together . Then one of them stood out beside Challenger . You 'll smile , young fellah , but ' pon my word they might have been kinsmen . I could n't have believed it if I had n't seen it with my own eyes . This old ape - man - he was their chief - was a sort of red Challenger , with every one of our friend 's beauty points , only just a trifle more so . He had the short body , the big shoulders , the round chest , no neck , a great ruddy frill of a beard , the tufted eyebrows , the ' What do you want , damn you ! ' look about the eyes , and the whole catalogue . When the ape - man stood by Challenger and put his paw on his shoulder , the thing was complete . Summerlee was a bit hysterical , and he laughed till he cried . The ape - men laughed too - or at least they put up the devil of a cacklin ' - and they set to work to drag us off through the forest . They would n't touch the guns and things - thought them dangerous , I expect - but they carried away all our loose food . Summerlee and I got some rough handlin ' on the way - there 's my skin and my clothes to prove it - for they took us a bee - line through the brambles , and their own hides are like leather . But Challenger was all right . Four of them carried him shoulder high , and he went like a Roman emperor . What 's that ? "
64652	64657	64659	64660	my companion	420	" There they go ! "
64669	64672	64659	64660	my companion	420	" Express . "
64673	64774	64659	64660	my companion	420	" Load them all up , young fellah my lad , for we 're not going to be taken alive , and do n't you think it ! That 's the row they make when they are excited . By George ! they 'll have something to excite them if they put us up . The ' Last Stand of the Grays ' wo n't be in it . ' With their rifles grasped in their stiffened hands , mid a ring of the dead and dyin ' , ' as some fathead sings . Can you hear them now ? "
64775	64780	64659	64660	my companion	420	" Very far away . "
64781	65094	64659	64660	my companion	420	" That little lot will do no good , but I expect their search parties are all over the wood . Well , I was telling you my tale of woe . They got us soon to this town of theirs - about a thousand huts of branches and leaves in a great grove of trees near the edge of the cliff . It 's three or four miles from here . The filthy beasts fingered me all over , and I feel as if I should never be clean again . They tied us up - the fellow who handled me could tie like a bosun - and there we lay with our toes up , beneath a tree , while a great brute stood guard over us with a club in his hand . When I say ' we ' I mean Summerlee and myself . Old Challenger was up a tree , eatin ' pines and havin' the time of his life . I 'm bound to say that he managed to get some fruit to us , and with his own hands he loosened our bonds . If you 'd seen him sitting up in that tree hob - nobbin ' with his twin brother - and singin ' in that rollin ' bass of his , ' Ring out , wild bells , ' cause music of any kind seemed to put 'em in a good humor , you 'd have smiled ; but we were n't in much mood for laughin ' , as you can guess . They were inclined , within limits , to let him do what he liked , but they drew the line pretty sharply at us . It was a mighty consolation to us all to know that you were runnin ' loose and had the archives in your keepin ' .
65095	65338	64659	64660	my companion	420	" Well , now , young fellah , I 'll tell you what will surprise you . You say you saw signs of men , and fires , traps , and the like . Well , we have seen the natives themselves . Poor devils they were , down - faced little chaps , and had enough to make them so . It seems that the humans hold one side of this plateau - over yonder , where you saw the caves - and the ape - men hold this side , and there is bloody war between them all the time . That 's the situation , so far as I could follow it . Well , yesterday the ape - men got hold of a dozen of the humans and brought them in as prisoners . You never heard such a jabberin ' and shriekin ' in your life . The men were little red fellows , and had been bitten and clawed so that they could hardly walk . The ape - men put two of them to death there and then - fairly pulled the arm off one of them - it was perfectly beastly . Plucky little chaps they are , and hardly gave a squeak . But it turned us absolutely sick . Summerlee fainted , and even Challenger had as much as he could stand . I think they have cleared , do n't you ? "
65367	65708	65364	65364	his	181	" I think you have had the escape of your life , young fellah my lad . It was catchin ' those Indians that put you clean out of their heads , else they would have been back to the camp for you as sure as fate and gathered you in . Of course , as you said , they have been watchin ' us from the beginnin ' out of that tree , and they knew perfectly well that we were one short . However , they could think only of this new haul ; so it was I , and not a bunch of apes , that dropped in on you in the morning . Well , we had a horrid business afterwards . My God ! what a nightmare the whole thing is ! You remember the great bristle of sharp canes down below where we found the skeleton of the American ? Well , that is just under ape - town , and that 's the jumpin'-off place of their prisoners . I expect there 's heaps of skeletons there , if we looked for 'em . They have a sort of clear parade - ground on the top , and they make a proper ceremony about it . One by one the poor devils have to jump , and the game is to see whether they are merely dashed to pieces or whether they get skewered on the canes . They took us out to see it , and the whole tribe lined up on the edge . Four of the Indians jumped , and the canes went through 'em like knittin ' needles through a pat of butter . No wonder we found that poor Yankee 's skeleton with the canes growin ' between his ribs . It was horrible - but it was doocedly interestin ' too . We were all fascinated to see them take the dive , even when we thought it would be our turn next on the spring - board .
65709	66006	66246	66246	he	181	" Well , it was n't . They kept six of the Indians up for to - day - that 's how I understood it - but I fancy we were to be the star performers in the show . Challenger might get off , but Summerlee and I were in the bill . Their language is more than half signs , and it was not hard to follow them . So I thought it was time we made a break for it . I had been plottin ' it out a bit , and had one or two things clear in my mind . It was all on me , for Summerlee was useless and Challenger not much better . The only time they got together they got slangin ' because they could n't agree upon the scientific classification of these red - headed devils that had got hold of us . One said it was the dryopithecus of Java , the other said it was pithecanthropus . Madness , I call it - Loonies , both . But , as I say , I had thought out one or two points that were helpful . One was that these brutes could not run as fast as a man in the open . They have short , bandy legs , you see , and heavy bodies . Even Challenger could give a few yards in a hundred to the best of them , and you or I would be a perfect Shrubb . Another point was that they knew nothin' about guns . I do n't believe they ever understood how the fellow I shot came by his hurt . If we could get at our guns there was no sayin ' what we could do .
66007	66049	65364	65364	his	181	" So I broke away early this mornin ' , gave my guard a kick in the tummy that laid him out , and sprinted for the camp . There I got you and the guns , and here we are . "
66050	66055	66056	66056	I	0	" But the professors ! "
66062	66211	65364	65364	his	181	" Well , we must just go back and fetch 'em . I could n't bring 'em with me . Challenger was up the tree , and Summerlee was not fit for the effort . The only chance was to get the guns and try a rescue . Of course they may scupper them at once in revenge . I do n't think they would touch Challenger , but I would n't answer for Summerlee . But they would have had him in any case . Of that I am certain . So I have n't made matters any worse by boltin ' . But we are honor bound to go back and have them out or see it through with them . So you can make up your soul , young fellah my lad , for it will be one way or the other before evenin ' . "
66400	66404	66405	66405	he	181	" By George ! "
66408	66413	66405	66405	he	181	" here they come ! "
66550	66555	66557	66558	Lord John	181	" Not this time , "
66567	66613	66557	66558	Lord John	181	" Our best chance is to lie quiet until they have given up the search . Then we shall see whether we ca n't get back to their town and hit 'em where it hurts most . Give 'em an hour and we 'll march . "
66751	66767	66769	66769	he	181	" So long as we are among the thick trees these swine are our masters , "
66771	66870	66769	66769	he	181	" They can see us and we can not see them . But in the open it is different . There we can move faster than they . So we must stick to the open all we can . The edge of the plateau has fewer large trees than further inland . So that 's our line of advance . Go slowly , keep your eyes open and your rifle ready . Above all , never let them get you prisoner while there is a cartridge left - that 's my last word to you , young fellah . "
67034	67037	67039	67039	he	181	" Come ! "
67041	67057	67039	67039	he	181	" Come quick ! I hope to the Lord we are not too late already ! "
68106	68120	68122	68123	my companion	420	" Shoot into the thick of them ! Shoot ! sonny , shoot ! "
68687	68691	68693	68694	our peer	1793	" By George ! "
68704	68733	68693	68694	our peer	1793	" I say - what the deuce are we to do with these people ? Get up , little chappie , and take your face off my boots . "
68747	68756	68758	68758	he	182	" We 've got to see them safe , "
68760	68784	68758	68758	he	182	" You 've pulled us all out of the jaws of death . My word ! it was a good bit of work ! "
68785	68788	68790	68790	Challenger	142	" Admirable ! "
68792	68856	68790	68790	Challenger	142	" Admirable ! Not only we as individuals , but European science collectively , owe you a deep debt of gratitude for what you have done . I do not hesitate to say that the disappearance of Professor Summerlee and myself would have left an appreciable gap in modern zoological history . Our young friend here and you have done most excellently well . "
68958	68969	68971	68972	Lord John	181	" Do n't you be scared , my bonnie boy , "
68983	69024	68971	68972	Lord John	181	" He ca n't stick your appearance , Challenger ; and , by George ! I do n't wonder . All right , little chap , he 's only a human , just the same as the rest of us . "
69025	69030	69032	69033	the Professor	2374	" Really , sir ! "
69035	69067	68971	68972	Lord John	181	" Well , it 's lucky for you , Challenger , that you ARE a little out of the ordinary . If you had n't been so like the king - - "
69068	69082	68971	68972	Lord John	181	" Upon my word , Lord John , you allow yourself great latitude . "
69083	69091	68971	68972	Lord John	181	" Well , it 's a fact . "
69092	69143	68971	68972	Lord John	181	" I beg , sir , that you will change the subject . Your remarks are irrelevant and unintelligible . The question before us is what are we to do with these Indians ? The obvious thing is to escort them home , if we knew where their home was . "
69144	69152	69154	69154	I.	1800	" There is no difficulty about that , "
69155	69170	68971	68972	Lord John	181	" They live in the caves on the other side of the central lake . "
69171	69189	68971	68972	Lord John	181	" Our young friend here knows where they live . I gather that it is some distance . "
69190	69196	68971	68972	Lord John	181	" A good twenty miles , "
69204	69226	69228	69228	he	182	" I , for one , could never get there . Surely I hear those brutes still howling upon our track . "
69263	69272	69274	69275	Lord John	181	" We must move , and move quick ! "
69277	69303	69274	69275	Lord John	181	" You help Summerlee , young fellah . These Indians will carry stores . Now , then , come along before they can see us . "
69387	69407	69409	69409	he	142	" You keep a diary of these events , and you expect eventually to publish it , Mr. Malone , "
69414	69424	69425	69425	I	0	" I am only here as a Press reporter , "
69428	69457	69374	69374	someone	2531	" Exactly . You may have heard some rather fatuous remarks of Lord John Roxton 's which seemed to imply that there was some - some resemblance - - "
69458	69465	69374	69374	someone	2531	" Yes , I heard them . "
69466	69496	69374	69374	someone	2531	" I need not say that any publicity given to such an idea - any levity in your narrative of what occurred - would be exceedingly offensive to me . "
69497	69506	69374	69374	someone	2531	" I will keep well within the truth . "
69507	69549	69374	69374	someone	2531	" Lord John 's observations are frequently exceedingly fanciful , and he is capable of attributing the most absurd reasons to the respect which is always shown by the most undeveloped races to dignity and character . You follow my meaning ? "
69550	69553	69374	69374	someone	2531	" Entirely . "
69554	69563	69571	69571	he	142	" I leave the matter to your discretion . "
69574	69604	69571	69571	he	142	" The king of the ape - men was really a creature of great distinction - a most remarkably handsome and intelligent personality . Did it not strike you ? "
69605	69611	69613	69613	I.	1810	" A most remarkable creature , "
69634	69640	69613	69613	I.	1810	" Those Were the Real Conquests "
70089	70091	70080	70080	they	1826	" Accala "
70131	70136	70119	70119	they	1826	" Doda ! Doda ! "
70146	70156	70158	70159	Lord John	181	" What do you make of them , Challenger ? "
70161	70190	70158	70159	Lord John	181	" One thing is very clear to me , and that is that the little chap with the front of his head shaved is a chief among them . "
70294	70296	70290	70290	he	2456	" Maretas "
70331	70338	70340	70340	he	2374	" The type of these people , "
70346	70451	70340	70340	he	2374	" whether judged by cranial capacity , facial angle , or any other test , can not be regarded as a low one ; on the contrary , we must place it as considerably higher in the scale than many South American tribes which I can mention . On no possible supposition can we explain the evolution of such a race in this place . For that matter , so great a gap separates these ape - men from the primitive animals which have survived upon this plateau , that it is inadmissible to think that they could have developed where we find them . "
70452	70462	70464	70465	Lord John	181	" Then where the dooce did they drop from ? "
70467	70488	70489	70490	the Professor	2374	" A question which will , no doubt , be eagerly discussed in every scientific society in Europe and America , "
70493	70506	70507	70507	he	2374	" My own reading of the situation for what it is worth - "
70521	70670	70673	70673	he	2374	" is that evolution has advanced under the peculiar conditions of this country up to the vertebrate stage , the old types surviving and living on in company with the newer ones . Thus we find such modern creatures as the tapir - an animal with quite a respectable length of pedigree - the great deer , and the ant - eater in the companionship of reptilian forms of jurassic type . So much is clear . And now come the ape - men and the Indian . What is the scientific mind to think of their presence ? I can only account for it by an invasion from outside . It is probable that there existed an anthropoid ape in South America , who in past ages found his way to this place , and that he developed into the creatures we have seen , some of which "
70679	70852	70673	70673	he	2374	" were of an appearance and shape which , if it had been accompanied by corresponding intelligence , would , I do not hesitate to say , have reflected credit upon any living race . As to the Indians I can not doubt that they are more recent immigrants from below . Under the stress of famine or of conquest they have made their way up here . Faced by ferocious creatures which they had never before seen , they took refuge in the caves which our young friend has described , but they have no doubt had a bitter fight to hold their own against wild beasts , and especially against the ape - men who would regard them as intruders , and wage a merciless war upon them with a cunning which the larger beasts would lack . Hence the fact that their numbers appear to be limited . Well , gentlemen , have I read you the riddle aright , or is there any point which you would query ? "
70936	70945	70947	70948	Lord Roxton	181	" He has gone to fetch some water , "
70950	70965	70947	70948	Lord Roxton	181	" We fitted him up with an empty beef tin and he is off . "
70966	70972	70973	70973	I	0	" To the old camp ? "
70976	71011	70947	70948	Lord Roxton	181	" No , to the brook . It 's among the trees there . It ca n't be more than a couple of hundred yards . But the beggar is certainly taking his time . "
71012	71021	71023	71023	I.	233	" I 'll go and look after him , "
71703	71719	71721	71722	Lord Roxton	181	" But you 've had the escape of your life , young fellah my lad , "
71724	71813	71721	71722	Lord Roxton	181	" When I heard your cry and ran forward , and saw your head twisted half - off and your stohwassers kickin ' in the air , I thought we were one short . I missed the beast in my flurry , but he dropped you all right and was off like a streak . By George ! I wish I had fifty men with rifles . I 'd clear out the whole infernal gang of them and leave this country a bit cleaner than we found it . "
72835	72842	72844	72844	he	1908	" They may be undeveloped types , "
72855	72888	72844	72844	he	1908	" but their deportment in the presence of their superiors might be a lesson to some of our more advanced Europeans . Strange how correct are the instincts of the natural man ! "
72959	72962	72938	72938	Their	2527	" Doda , "
73062	73070	73071	73071	he	2889	" What is the use of returning ? "
73074	73121	73071	73071	he	2889	" Sooner or later the thing must be done . Your comrades have been murdered . What if I have returned safe ? These others have been done to death . There is no safety for any of us . We are assembled now and ready . "
73128	73156	73123	73123	he	2889	" These strange men are our friends . They are great fighters , and they hate the ape - men even as we do . They command , "
73164	73208	73158	73158	he	2889	" the thunder and the lightning . When shall we have such a chance again ? Let us go forward , and either die now or live for the future in safety . How else shall we go back unashamed to our women ? "
73286	73301	73303	73303	he	181	" Well , it 's up to you to say what you will do , "
73305	73372	73281	73281	he	181	" for my part I have a score to settle with these monkey - folk , and if it ends by wiping them off the face of the earth I do n't see that the earth need fret about it . I 'm goin' with our little red pals and I mean to see them through the scrap . What do you say , young fellah ? "
73373	73380	73281	73281	he	181	" Of course I will come . "
73381	73387	73281	73281	he	181	" And you , Challenger ? "
73388	73396	73281	73281	he	181	" I will assuredly co - operate . "
73397	73403	73281	73281	he	181	" And you , Summerlee ? "
73404	73456	73281	73281	he	181	" We seem to be drifting very far from the object of this expedition , Lord John . I assure you that I little thought when I left my professional chair in London that it was for the purpose of heading a raid of savages upon a colony of anthropoid apes . "
73457	73466	73468	73469	Lord John	181	" To such base uses do we come , "
73473	73487	73468	73469	Lord John	181	" But we are up against it , so what 's the decision ? "
73488	73496	73498	73498	Summerlee	182	" It seems a most questionable step , "
73505	73522	73498	73498	Summerlee	182	" but if you are all going , I hardly see how I can remain behind . "
73523	73529	73531	73532	Lord John	181	" Then it is settled , "
73940	73999	74000	74000	He	142	" An inflammable gas , and one markedly lighter than the atmosphere . I should say beyond doubt that it contained a considerable proportion of free hydrogen . The resources of G. E. C. are not yet exhausted , my young friend . I may yet show you how a great mind molds all Nature to its use . "
74279	74288	74290	74290	Summerlee	182	" Plesiosaurus ! A fresh - water plesiosaurus ! "
74292	74320	74290	74290	Summerlee	182	" That I should have lived to see such a sight ! We are blessed , my dear Challenger , above all zoologists since the world began ! "
75218	75223	75225	75226	Lord John	181	" It 's over , "
75228	75253	75225	75226	Lord John	181	" I think we can leave the tidying up to them . Perhaps the less we see of it the better we shall sleep . "
75265	75271	75272	75272	he	181	" We have been privileged , "
75281	75406	75272	75272	he	181	" to be present at one of the typical decisive battles of history - the battles which have determined the fate of the world . What , my friends , is the conquest of one nation by another ? It is meaningless . Each produces the same result . But those fierce fights , when in the dawn of the ages the cave - dwellers held their own against the tiger folk , or the elephants first found that they had a master , those were the real conquests - the victories that count . By this strange turn of fate we have seen and helped to decide even such a contest . Now upon this plateau the future must ever be for man . "
75747	75756	75757	75757	he	195	" Come away , Massas , come away ! "
75767	75779	75760	75760	his	195	" The debbil get you sure if you stay up there . "
75780	75788	75790	75790	Summerlee	182	" It is the voice of sanity ! "
75794	75843	75790	75790	Summerlee	182	" We have had adventures enough and they are neither suitable to our character or our position . I hold you to your word , Challenger . From now onwards you devote your energies to getting us out of this horrible country and back once more to civilization . "
75846	75853	75760	75760	his	195	" Our Eyes have seen Great Wonders "
76751	76753	76763	76763	men	2335	" Stoa "
78756	78781	78790	78790	Zambo	195	" They will soon come now , Massa Malone . Before another week pass Indian come back and bring rope and fetch you down . "
78930	78936	78938	78938	he	181	" Well , young fellah , "
78940	78952	78938	78938	he	181	" who would have thought of meetin ' you up here ? "
78953	78962	78963	78963	I	0	" What in the world are you doing ? "
78966	78975	78977	78977	he	181	" Visitin ' my friends , the pterodactyls , "
78979	78983	78938	78938	he	181	" But why ? "
78984	79026	78938	78938	he	181	" Interestin ' beasts , do n't you think ? But unsociable ! Nasty rude ways with strangers , as you may remember . So I rigged this framework which keeps them from bein ' too pressin ' in their attentions . "
79027	79037	78938	78938	he	181	" But what do you want in the swamp ? "
79056	79071	79072	79072	he	181	" Do n't you think other people besides Professors can want to know things ? "
79077	79092	79072	79072	he	181	" I 'm studyin ' the pretty dears . That 's enough for you . "
79093	79097	79099	79099	I.	0	" No offense , "
79109	79171	79106	79106	he	181	" No offense , young fellah . I 'm goin' to get a young devil chick for Challenger . That 's one of my jobs . No , I do n't want your company . I 'm safe in this cage , and you are not . So long , and I 'll be back in camp by night - fall . "
79689	79704	79706	79706	he	182	" You do n't mean us to go up in that thing , Challenger ? "
79713	79750	79706	79706	he	182	" I mean , my dear Summerlee , to give you such a demonstration of its powers that after seeing it you will , I am sure , have no hesitation in trusting yourself to it . "
79751	79766	79768	79768	Summerlee	182	" You can put it right out of your head now , at once , "
79772	79798	79768	79768	Summerlee	182	" nothing on earth would induce me to commit such a folly . Lord John , I trust that you will not countenance such madness ? "
79799	79807	79809	79810	our peer	1793	" Dooced ingenious , I call it , "
79812	79822	79809	79810	our peer	1793	" I 'd like to see how it works . "
79823	79828	79830	79830	Challenger	142	" So you shall , "
79832	79979	79830	79830	Challenger	142	" For some days I have exerted my whole brain force upon the problem of how we shall descend from these cliffs . We have satisfied ourselves that we can not climb down and that there is no tunnel . We are also unable to construct any kind of bridge which may take us back to the pinnacle from which we came . How then shall I find a means to convey us ? Some little time ago I had remarked to our young friend here that free hydrogen was evolved from the geyser . The idea of a balloon naturally followed . I was , I will admit , somewhat baffled by the difficulty of discovering an envelope to contain the gas , but the contemplation of the immense entrails of these reptiles supplied me with a solution to the problem . Behold the result ! "
80019	80023	80025	80025	Summerlee	182	" Midsummer madness ! "
80036	80045	80046	80046	he	181	" Clever old dear , ai n't he ? "
80057	80063	80046	80046	he	181	" What about a car ? "
80064	80106	80046	80046	he	181	" The car will be my next care . I have already planned how it is to be made and attached . Meanwhile I will simply show you how capable my apparatus is of supporting the weight of each of us . "
80107	80114	80046	80046	he	181	" All of us , surely ? "
80115	80188	80189	80189	He	142	" No , it is part of my plan that each in turn shall descend as in a parachute , and the balloon be drawn back by means which I shall have no difficulty in perfecting . If it will support the weight of one and let him gently down , it will have done all that is required of it . I will now show you its capacity in that direction . "
80344	80349	80351	80351	Challenger	142	" I will now , "
80360	80369	80351	80351	Challenger	142	" demonstrate the carrying power of my balloon . "
80579	80582	80584	80586	the undaunted Challenger	2165	" Splendid ! "
80593	80645	80584	80586	the undaunted Challenger	2165	" A most thorough and satisfactory demonstration ! I could not have anticipated such a success . Within a week , gentlemen , I promise that a second balloon will be prepared , and that you can count upon taking in safety and comfort the first stage of our homeward journey . "
81013	81029	81031	81031	I.	0	" Whatever it is , I can swear that it is of importance to us , "
81032	81045	81031	81031	I.	0	" I could read that on his face as he gave it . "
81046	81057	81058	81058	Summerlee	182	" Unless we have come upon a primitive practical joker , "
81061	81077	81058	81058	Summerlee	182	" which I should think would be one of the most elementary developments of man . "
81078	81087	81089	81089	Challenger	142	" It is clearly some sort of script , "
81091	81099	81101	81102	Lord John	181	" Looks like a guinea puzzle competition , "
81126	81130	81131	81131	he	181	" By George ! "
81134	81186	81131	81131	he	181	" I believe I 've got it . The boy guessed right the very first time . See here ! How many marks are on that paper ? Eighteen . Well , if you come to think of it there are eighteen cave openings on the hill - side above us . "
81187	81201	81203	81203	I.	2177	" He pointed up to the caves when he gave it to me , "
81204	81277	81131	81131	he	181	" Well , that settles it . This is a chart of the caves . What ! Eighteen of them all in a row , some short , some deep , some branching , same as we saw them . It 's a map , and here 's a cross on it . What 's the cross for ? It is placed to mark one that is much deeper than the others . "
81278	81284	81285	81285	I	0	" One that goes through , "
81288	81299	81301	81301	Challenger	142	" I believe our young friend has read the riddle , "
81303	81366	81301	81301	Challenger	142	" If the cave does not go through I do not understand why this person , who has every reason to mean us well , should have drawn our attention to it . But if it does go through and comes out at the corresponding point on the other side , we should not have more than a hundred feet to descend . "
81367	81372	81374	81374	Summerlee	182	" A hundred feet ! "
81376	81390	81391	81391	I	0	" Well , our rope is still more than a hundred feet long , "
81394	81401	81391	81391	I	0	" Surely we could get down . "
81402	81411	81412	81412	Summerlee	182	" How about the Indians in the cave ? "
81415	81429	81431	81431	I.	0	" There are no Indians in any of the caves above our heads , "
81432	81459	81431	81431	I.	0	" They are all used as barns and store - houses . Why should we not go up now at once and spy out the land ? "
81736	81743	81745	81747	the indomitable Challenger	142	" Never mind , my friends , "
81749	81760	81745	81747	the indomitable Challenger	142	" You have still my firm promise of a balloon . "
81764	81773	81774	81774	I	0	" Can we be in the wrong cave ? "
81777	81784	81786	81787	Lord John	181	" No use , young fellah , "
81796	81814	81790	81790	his	181	" Seventeen from the right and second from the left . This is the cave sure enough . "
81835	81848	81827	81827	I	0	" I believe I have it ! Follow me ! Follow me ! "
81865	81868	81870	81870	I	0	" Here , "
81880	81887	81870	81870	I	0	" is where we lit up . "
81888	81891	81936	81936	I	0	" Exactly . "
81892	81932	81870	81870	I	0	" Well , it is marked as a forked cave , and in the darkness we passed the fork before the torches were lit . On the right side as we go out we should find the longer arm . "
82081	82088	82090	82091	Lord John	181	" The moon , by George ! "
82093	82104	82090	82091	Lord John	181	" We are through , boys ! We are through ! "
82774	82781	82782	82782	I	0	" A Procession ! A Procession ! "
83544	83647	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" The much - discussed meeting of the Zoological Institute , convened to hear the report of the Committee of Investigation sent out last year to South America to test the assertions made by Professor Challenger as to the continued existence of prehistoric life upon that Continent , was held last night in the greater Queen 's Hall , and it is safe to say that it is likely to be a red letter date in the history of Science , for the proceedings were of so remarkable and sensational a character that no one present is ever likely to forget them . "
83660	83936	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" The tickets were theoretically confined to members and their friends , but the latter is an elastic term , and long before eight o'clock , the hour fixed for the commencement of the proceedings , all parts of the Great Hall were tightly packed . The general public , however , which most unreasonably entertained a grievance at having been excluded , stormed the doors at a quarter to eight , after a prolonged melee in which several people were injured , including Inspector Scoble of H. Division , whose leg was unfortunately broken . After this unwarrantable invasion , which not only filled every passage , but even intruded upon the space set apart for the Press , it is estimated that nearly five thousand people awaited the arrival of the travelers . When they eventually appeared , they took their places in the front of a platform which already contained all the leading scientific men , not only of this country , but of France and of Germany . Sweden was also represented , in the person of Professor Sergius , the famous Zoologist of the University of Upsala . The entrance of the four heroes of the occasion was the signal for a remarkable demonstration of welcome , the whole audience rising and cheering for some minutes . An acute observer might , however , have detected some signs of dissent amid the applause , and gathered that the proceedings were likely to become more lively than harmonious . It may safely be prophesied , however , that no one could have foreseen the extraordinary turn which they were actually to take .
83937	84078	84082	84082	Mac	244	" Of the appearance of the four wanderers little need be said , since their photographs have for some time been appearing in all the papers . They bear few traces of the hardships which they are said to have undergone . Professor Challenger 's beard may be more shaggy , Professor Summerlee 's features more ascetic , Lord John Roxton 's figure more gaunt , and all three may be burned to a darker tint than when they left our shores , but each appeared to be in most excellent health . As to our own representative , the well - known athlete and international Rugby football player , E. D. Malone , he looks trained to a hair , and as he surveyed the crowd a smile of good - humored contentment pervaded his honest but homely face . "
84091	84309	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" When quiet had been restored and the audience resumed their seats after the ovation which they had given to the travelers , the chairman , the Duke of Durham , addressed the meeting . ' He would not , ' he said , ' stand for more than a moment between that vast assembly and the treat which lay before them . It was not for him to anticipate what Professor Summerlee , who was the spokesman of the committee , had to say to them , but it was common rumor that their expedition had been crowned by extraordinary success . ' Applause . ' Apparently the age of romance was not dead , and there was common ground upon which the wildest imaginings of the novelist could meet the actual scientific investigations of the searcher for truth . He would only add , before he sat down , that he rejoiced - and all of them would rejoice - that these gentlemen had returned safe and sound from their difficult and dangerous task , for it can not be denied that any disaster to such an expedition would have inflicted a well - nigh irreparable loss to the cause of Zoological science . ' Great applause , in which Professor Challenger was observed to join .
84310	84522	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" Professor Summerlee 's rising was the signal for another extraordinary outbreak of enthusiasm , which broke out again at intervals throughout his address . That address will not be given in extenso in these columns , for the reason that a full account of the whole adventures of the expedition is being published as a supplement from the pen of our own special correspondent . Some general indications will therefore suffice . Having described the genesis of their journey , and paid a handsome tribute to his friend Professor Challenger , coupled with an apology for the incredulity with which his assertions , now fully vindicated , had been received , he gave the actual course of their journey , carefully withholding such information as would aid the public in any attempt to locate this remarkable plateau . Having described , in general terms , their course from the main river up to the time that they actually reached the base of the cliffs , he enthralled his hearers by his account of the difficulties encountered by the expedition in their repeated attempts to mount them , and finally described how they succeeded in their desperate endeavors , which cost the lives of their two devoted half - breed servants . "
84546	85153	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" Having conducted his audience in fancy to the summit , and marooned them there by reason of the fall of their bridge , the Professor proceeded to describe both the horrors and the attractions of that remarkable land . Of personal adventures he said little , but laid stress upon the rich harvest reaped by Science in the observations of the wonderful beast , bird , insect , and plant life of the plateau . Peculiarly rich in the coleoptera and in the lepidoptera , forty - six new species of the one and ninety - four of the other had been secured in the course of a few weeks . It was , however , in the larger animals , and especially in the larger animals supposed to have been long extinct , that the interest of the public was naturally centered . Of these he was able to give a goodly list , but had little doubt that it would be largely extended when the place had been more thoroughly investigated . He and his companions had seen at least a dozen creatures , most of them at a distance , which corresponded with nothing at present known to Science . These would in time be duly classified and examined . He instanced a snake , the cast skin of which , deep purple in color , was fifty - one feet in length , and mentioned a white creature , supposed to be mammalian , which gave forth well - marked phosphorescence in the darkness ; also a large black moth , the bite of which was supposed by the Indians to be highly poisonous . Setting aside these entirely new forms of life , the plateau was very rich in known prehistoric forms , dating back in some cases to early Jurassic times . Among these he mentioned the gigantic and grotesque stegosaurus , seen once by Mr. Malone at a drinking - place by the lake , and drawn in the sketch - book of that adventurous American who had first penetrated this unknown world . He described also the iguanodon and the pterodactyl - two of the first of the wonders which they had encountered . He then thrilled the assembly by some account of the terrible carnivorous dinosaurs , which had on more than one occasion pursued members of the party , and which were the most formidable of all the creatures which they had encountered . Thence he passed to the huge and ferocious bird , the phororachus , and to the great elk which still roams upon this upland . It was not , however , until he sketched the mysteries of the central lake that the full interest and enthusiasm of the audience were aroused . One had to pinch oneself to be sure that one was awake as one heard this sane and practical Professor in cold measured tones describing the monstrous three - eyed fish - lizards and the huge water - snakes which inhabit this enchanted sheet of water . Next he touched upon the Indians , and upon the extraordinary colony of anthropoid apes , which might be looked upon as an advance upon the pithecanthropus of Java , and as coming therefore nearer than any known form to that hypothetical creation , the missing link . Finally he described , amongst some merriment , the ingenious but highly dangerous aeronautic invention of Professor Challenger , and wound up a most memorable address by an account of the methods by which the committee did at last find their way back to civilization .
85154	85253	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" It had been hoped that the proceedings would end there , and that a vote of thanks and congratulation , moved by Professor Sergius , of Upsala University , would be duly seconded and carried ; but it was soon evident that the course of events was not destined to flow so smoothly . Symptoms of opposition had been evident from time to time during the evening , and now Dr. James Illingworth , of Edinburgh , rose in the center of the hall . Dr. Illingworth asked whether an amendment should not be taken before a resolution .
85254	85270	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" THE CHAIRMAN : ' Yes , sir , if there must be an amendment . '
85271	85286	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" DR . ILLINGWORTH : ' Your Grace , there must be an amendment . '
85287	85300	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" THE CHAIRMAN : ' Then let us take it at once . '
85301	85342	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" PROFESSOR SUMMERLEE springing to his feet : ' Might I explain , your Grace , that this man is my personal enemy ever since our controversy in the Quarterly Journal of Science as to the true nature of Bathybius ? '
85343	85360	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" THE CHAIRMAN : ' I fear I can not go into personal matters . Proceed . '
85361	85473	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" Dr. Illingworth was imperfectly heard in part of his remarks on account of the strenuous opposition of the friends of the explorers . Some attempts were also made to pull him down . Being a man of enormous physique , however , and possessed of a very powerful voice , he dominated the tumult and succeeded in finishing his speech . It was clear , from the moment of his rising , that he had a number of friends and sympathizers in the hall , though they formed a minority in the audience . The attitude of the greater part of the public might be described as one of attentive neutrality .
85474	85914	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" Dr. Illingworth began his remarks by expressing his high appreciation of the scientific work both of Professor Challenger and of Professor Summerlee . He much regretted that any personal bias should have been read into his remarks , which were entirely dictated by his desire for scientific truth . His position , in fact , was substantially the same as that taken up by Professor Summerlee at the last meeting . At that last meeting Professor Challenger had made certain assertions which had been queried by his colleague . Now this colleague came forward himself with the same assertions and expected them to remain unquestioned . Was this reasonable ? ' Yes , ' ' No , ' and prolonged interruption , during which Professor Challenger was heard from the Press box to ask leave from the chairman to put Dr. Illingworth into the street . A year ago one man said certain things . Now four men said other and more startling ones . Was this to constitute a final proof where the matters in question were of the most revolutionary and incredible character ? There had been recent examples of travelers arriving from the unknown with certain tales which had been too readily accepted . Was the London Zoological Institute to place itself in this position ? He admitted that the members of the committee were men of character . But human nature was very complex . Even Professors might be misled by the desire for notoriety . Like moths , we all love best to flutter in the light . Heavy - game shots liked to be in a position to cap the tales of their rivals , and journalists were not averse from sensational coups , even when imagination had to aid fact in the process . Each member of the committee had his own motive for making the most of his results . ' Shame ! shame ! ' He had no desire to be offensive . ' You are ! ' and interruption . The corroboration of these wondrous tales was really of the most slender description . What did it amount to ? Some photographs . Was it possible that in this age of ingenious manipulation photographs could be accepted as evidence ? What more ? We have a story of a flight and a descent by ropes which precluded the production of larger specimens . It was ingenious , but not convincing . It was understood that Lord John Roxton claimed to have the skull of a phororachus . He could only say that he would like to see that skull .
85915	85931	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" LORD JOHN ROXTON : ' Is this fellow calling me a liar ? ' Uproar .
85932	85961	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" THE CHAIRMAN : ' Order ! order ! Dr. Illingworth , I must direct you to bring your remarks to a conclusion and to move your amendment . '
85962	86031	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" DR . ILLINGWORTH : ' Your Grace , I have more to say , but I bow to your ruling . I move , then , that , while Professor Summerlee be thanked for his interesting address , the whole matter shall be regarded as ' non - proven , ' and shall be referred back to a larger , and possibly more reliable Committee of Investigation . '
86032	86226	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" It is difficult to describe the confusion caused by this amendment . A large section of the audience expressed their indignation at such a slur upon the travelers by noisy shouts of dissent and cries of , ' Do n't put it ! ' ' Withdraw ! ' ' Turn him out ! ' On the other hand , the malcontents - and it can not be denied that they were fairly numerous - cheered for the amendment , with cries of ' Order ! ' ' Chair ! ' and ' Fair play ! ' A scuffle broke out in the back benches , and blows were freely exchanged among the medical students who crowded that part of the hall . It was only the moderating influence of the presence of large numbers of ladies which prevented an absolute riot . Suddenly , however , there was a pause , a hush , and then complete silence . Professor Challenger was on his feet . His appearance and manner are peculiarly arresting , and as he raised his hand for order the whole audience settled down expectantly to give him a hearing .
86227	86730	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" ' It will be within the recollection of many present , ' said Professor Challenger , ' that similar foolish and unmannerly scenes marked the last meeting at which I have been able to address them . On that occasion Professor Summerlee was the chief offender , and though he is now chastened and contrite , the matter could not be entirely forgotten . I have heard to - night similar , but even more offensive , sentiments from the person who has just sat down , and though it is a conscious effort of self - effacement to come down to that person 's mental level , I will endeavor to do so , in order to allay any reasonable doubt which could possibly exist in the minds of anyone . ' Laughter and interruption . ' I need not remind this audience that , though Professor Summerlee , as the head of the Committee of Investigation , has been put up to speak to - night , still it is I who am the real prime mover in this business , and that it is mainly to me that any successful result must be ascribed . I have safely conducted these three gentlemen to the spot mentioned , and I have , as you have heard , convinced them of the accuracy of my previous account . We had hoped that we should find upon our return that no one was so dense as to dispute our joint conclusions . Warned , however , by my previous experience , I have not come without such proofs as may convince a reasonable man . As explained by Professor Summerlee , our cameras have been tampered with by the ape - men when they ransacked our camp , and most of our negatives ruined . ' Jeers , laughter , and ' Tell us another ! ' from the back . ' I have mentioned the ape - men , and I can not forbear from saying that some of the sounds which now meet my ears bring back most vividly to my recollection my experiences with those interesting creatures . ' Laughter . ' In spite of the destruction of so many invaluable negatives , there still remains in our collection a certain number of corroborative photographs showing the conditions of life upon the plateau . Did they accuse them of having forged these photographs ? ' A voice , ' Yes , ' and considerable interruption which ended in several men being put out of the hall . ' The negatives were open to the inspection of experts . But what other evidence had they ? Under the conditions of their escape it was naturally impossible to bring a large amount of baggage , but they had rescued Professor Summerlee 's collections of butterflies and beetles , containing many new species . Was this not evidence ? ' Several voices , ' No . ' ' Who said no ? '
86731	86759	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" DR . ILLINGWORTH rising : ' Our point is that such a collection might have been made in other places than a prehistoric plateau . ' Applause .
86760	86887	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" PROFESSOR CHALLENGER : ' No doubt , sir , we have to bow to your scientific authority , although I must admit that the name is unfamiliar . Passing , then , both the photographs and the entomological collection , I come to the varied and accurate information which we bring with us upon points which have never before been elucidated . For example , upon the domestic habits of the pterodactyl - ' A voice : ' Bosh , ' and uproar - ' I say , that upon the domestic habits of the pterodactyl we can throw a flood of light . I can exhibit to you from my portfolio a picture of that creature taken from life which would convince you - - '
86888	86902	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" DR . ILLINGWORTH : ' No picture could convince us of anything . '
86903	86917	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" PROFESSOR CHALLENGER : ' You would require to see the thing itself ? '
86918	86926	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" DR . ILLINGWORTH : ' Undoubtedly . '
86927	86938	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" PROFESSOR CHALLENGER : ' And you would accept that ? '
86939	86950	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" DR . ILLINGWORTH laughing : ' Beyond a doubt . '
86951	87597	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" It was at this point that the sensation of the evening arose - a sensation so dramatic that it can never have been paralleled in the history of scientific gatherings . Professor Challenger raised his hand in the air as a signal , and at once our colleague , Mr. E. D. Malone , was observed to rise and to make his way to the back of the platform . An instant later he re - appeared in company of a gigantic negro , the two of them bearing between them a large square packing - case . It was evidently of great weight , and was slowly carried forward and placed in front of the Professor 's chair . All sound had hushed in the audience and everyone was absorbed in the spectacle before them . Professor Challenger drew off the top of the case , which formed a sliding lid . Peering down into the box he snapped his fingers several times and was heard from the Press seat to say , ' Come , then , pretty , pretty ! ' in a coaxing voice . An instant later , with a scratching , rattling sound , a most horrible and loathsome creature appeared from below and perched itself upon the side of the case . Even the unexpected fall of the Duke of Durham into the orchestra , which occurred at this moment , could not distract the petrified attention of the vast audience . The face of the creature was like the wildest gargoyle that the imagination of a mad medieval builder could have conceived . It was malicious , horrible , with two small red eyes as bright as points of burning coal . Its long , savage mouth , which was held half - open , was full of a double row of shark - like teeth . Its shoulders were humped , and round them were draped what appeared to be a faded gray shawl . It was the devil of our childhood in person . There was a turmoil in the audience - someone screamed , two ladies in the front row fell senseless from their chairs , and there was a general movement upon the platform to follow their chairman into the orchestra . For a moment there was danger of a general panic . Professor Challenger threw up his hands to still the commotion , but the movement alarmed the creature beside him . Its strange shawl suddenly unfurled , spread , and fluttered as a pair of leathery wings . Its owner grabbed at its legs , but too late to hold it . It had sprung from the perch and was circling slowly round the Queen 's Hall with a dry , leathery flapping of its ten - foot wings , while a putrid and insidious odor pervaded the room . The cries of the people in the galleries , who were alarmed at the near approach of those glowing eyes and that murderous beak , excited the creature to a frenzy . Faster and faster it flew , beating against walls and chandeliers in a blind frenzy of alarm . ' The window ! For heaven 's sake shut that window ! ' roared the Professor from the platform , dancing and wringing his hands in an agony of apprehension . Alas , his warning was too late ! In a moment the creature , beating and bumping along the wall like a huge moth within a gas - shade , came upon the opening , squeezed its hideous bulk through it , and was gone . Professor Challenger fell back into his chair with his face buried in his hands , while the audience gave one long , deep sigh of relief as they realized that the incident was over .
87598	87669	83650	83652	brother scribe Macdona	243	" Then - oh ! how shall one describe what took place then - when the full exuberance of the majority and the full reaction of the minority united to make one great wave of enthusiasm , which rolled from the back of the hall , gathering volume as it came , swept over the orchestra , submerged the platform , and carried the four heroes away upon its crest ? "
87676	88048	87674	87674	Mac	244	" If the audience had done less than justice , surely it made ample amends . Every one was on his feet . Every one was moving , shouting , gesticulating . A dense crowd of cheering men were round the four travelers . ' Up with them ! up with them ! ' cried a hundred voices . In a moment four figures shot up above the crowd . In vain they strove to break loose . They were held in their lofty places of honor . It would have been hard to let them down if it had been wished , so dense was the crowd around them . ' Regent Street ! Regent Street ! ' sounded the voices . There was a swirl in the packed multitude , and a slow current , bearing the four upon their shoulders , made for the door . Out in the street the scene was extraordinary . An assemblage of not less than a hundred thousand people was waiting . The close - packed throng extended from the other side of the Langham Hotel to Oxford Circus . A roar of acclamation greeted the four adventurers as they appeared , high above the heads of the people , under the vivid electric lamps outside the hall . ' A procession ! A procession ! ' was the cry . In a dense phalanx , blocking the streets from side to side , the crowd set forth , taking the route of Regent Street , Pall Mall , St. James 's Street , and Piccadilly . The whole central traffic of London was held up , and many collisions were reported between the demonstrators upon the one side and the police and taxi - cabmen upon the other . Finally , it was not until after midnight that the four travelers were released at the entrance to Lord John Roxton 's chambers in the Albany , and that the exuberant crowd , having sung ' They are Jolly Good Fellows ' in chorus , concluded their program with ' God Save the King . ' So ended one of the most remarkable evenings that London has seen for a considerable time . "

89323	89370	89371	89371	He	2293	" How did you do it ? Have you searched for hidden treasure , or discovered a pole , or done time on a pirate , or flown the Channel , or what ? Where is the glamour of romance ? How did you get it ? "
89391	89404	89405	89405	he	2293	" Do n't you think all this is a little too personal ? "
89408	89415	89416	89416	I	0	" Well , just one question , "
89419	89429	89416	89416	I	0	" What are you ? What is your profession ? "
89430	89438	89440	89440	he	2293	" I am a solicitor 's clerk , "
89442	89455	89440	89440	he	2293	" Second man at Johnson and Merivale 's , 41 Chancery Lane . "
89456	89461	89463	89463	I	0	" Good - night ! "
89733	89739	89741	89741	he	142	" There 's one thing , "
89743	89841	89741	89741	he	142	" that maybe I should have spoken about before this , but I wanted to know a little more clearly where I was . No use to raise hopes and let them down again . But it 's facts , not hopes , with us now . You may remember that day we found the pterodactyl rookery in the swamp - what ? Well , somethin' in the lie of the land took my notice . Perhaps it has escaped you , so I will tell you . It was a volcanic vent full of blue clay . "
89846	89925	89926	89926	He	2304	" Well , now , in the whole world I 've only had to do with one place that was a volcanic vent of blue clay . That was the great De Beers Diamond Mine of Kimberley - what ? So you see I got diamonds into my head . I rigged up a contraption to hold off those stinking beasts , and I spent a happy day there with a spud . This is what I got . "
89961	90045	89937	89937	he	2304	" Perhaps you think I should have told you then . Well , so I should , only I know there are a lot of traps for the unwary , and that stones may be of any size and yet of little value where color and consistency are clean off . Therefore , I brought them back , and on the first day at home I took one round to Spink 's , and asked him to have it roughly cut and valued . "
90077	90083	90085	90085	he	2304	" There 's the result , "
90087	90132	90085	90085	he	2304	" He prices the lot at a minimum of two hundred thousand pounds . Of course it is fair shares between us . I wo n't hear of anythin ' else . Well , Challenger , what will you do with your fifty thousand ? "
90133	90143	90145	90146	the Professor	2374	" If you really persist in your generous view , "
90148	90165	90145	90146	the Professor	2374	" I should found a private museum , which has long been one of my dreams . "
90166	90172	90085	90085	he	2304	" And you , Summerlee ? "
90173	90193	90145	90146	the Professor	2374	" I would retire from teaching , and so find time for my final classification of the chalk fossils . "
90194	90201	90203	90205	Lord John Roxton	181	" I 'll use my own , "
90207	90245	90203	90205	Lord John Roxton	181	" in fitting a well - formed expedition and having another look at the dear old plateau . As to you , young fellah , you , of course , will spend yours in gettin ' married . "
90246	90251	90253	90253	I	0	" Not just yet , "
90260	90278	90253	90253	I	0	" I think , if you will have me , that I would rather go with you . "
