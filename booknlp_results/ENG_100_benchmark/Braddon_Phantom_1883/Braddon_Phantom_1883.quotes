435	449	450	451	H. French	446	' the Old Man Sat Looking at Mary in Silence for Some Moments . '
1085	1094	1096	1097	her ladyship	951	' My own idea was that she screamed , '
1099	1150	1156	1156	her	951	' But the new Rosinas generally do scream . Why do we have a new Rosina every year , whom nobody ever hears of afterwards ? What becomes of them ? Do they die , or do they set up as singing mistresses in second - rate watering - places ? '
1283	1290	1292	1292	one	959	' Indian mail in this morning , '
1293	1328	1292	1292	one	959	' nothing else talked of at the club . Very flagrant case ! A good deal worse than Warren Hastings . Quite clear there must be a public inquiry House of Lords criminal prosecution . '
1329	1352	1354	1355	another man	960	' I was told on very good authority , that he has been recalled , and is now on his passage home , '
1388	1399	1401	1402	Colonel Madison	452	' How will she take it , do you think ? '
1439	1448	1450	1451	his lordship	969	' You will have an opportunity of judging , '
1455	1464	1450	1451	his lordship	969	' She 's to be here this evening . '
1465	1474	1476	1477	the Colonel	970	' But do you think she 'll show ? '
1479	1520	1476	1477	the Colonel	970	' The mail must have brought the news to her , as well as to other people supposing she knew nothing about it beforehand . She must know that the storm has burst . Do you think she 'll - - '
1521	1530	1532	1533	Lord Denver	453	' Come out in the thunder and lightning ? '
1535	1537	1476	1477	the Colonel	970	' I 'm
1570	1570	1476	1477	the Colonel	970	'
1571	1620	1622	1623	Colonel Madison	452	' I think you are right . I knew her mother , Constance Talmash . Pluck was a family characteristic of the Talmashes . Wicked as devils , and brave as lions . Old Talmash , the grandfather , shot his valet in a paroxysm of delirium tremens , '
1625	1648	1622	1623	Colonel Madison	452	' She 's a splendid woman , and she wo n't flinch . I 'd rather back her than bet against her . '
1649	1653	1655	1659	the groom of the chambers	972	' Lady Maulevrier ! '
2643	2646	2656	2657	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Macbeth , '
2675	2688	2689	2689	she	524	' Perhaps you are surprised to see me in such good spirits , '
2719	2740	2689	2689	she	524	' but you will not wonder when I let you into the secret . Maulevrier is on his way home . '
2741	2744	2746	2747	Lord Denyer	447	' Indeed ! '
2785	2792	2762	2762	He	447	' You must be very glad . '
2793	2802	2804	2805	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I am gladder than I can say , '
2809	2884	2804	2805	Lady Maulevrier	524	' That horried climate a sky like molten copper an atmosphere that tastes of red - hot sand that flat barren coast never suited him . His term of office would expire in little more than a year , but I hardly think he could have lived out the year . However , I am happy to say the mail that came in to - day I suppose you know the mail is in ? '
2888	2929	2885	2886	Lord Denyer	447	' brought me a letter from his Lordship , telling me that he has sent in his resignation , and taken his passage by the next big ship that leaves Madras . I imagine he will be home in October . '
2930	2938	2940	2941	Lord Denyer	447	' If he have a favourable passage , '
2943	2961	2940	2941	Lord Denyer	447	' Favoured by your good wishes the winds and the waves ought to deal gently with him . '
2962	2984	2986	2987	her ladyship	951	' Ah , we have done with the old days of Greek story , when Neptune was open to feminine influence , '
2989	3003	2986	2987	her ladyship	951	' My poor Ulysses has no goddess of wisdom to look after him . '
3004	3022	2940	2941	Lord Denyer	447	' Perhaps not , but he has the most charming of Penelopes waiting for him at home . '
3023	3051	3053	3054	her ladyship	951	' A Penelope who goes to dinners , and takes life pleasantly in his absence . That is a new order of things , is it not ? '
3058	3084	3053	3054	her ladyship	951	' I hope my poor Ulysses will not come home thoroughly broken in health , but that our Sutherlandshire breezes will set him up again . '
3085	3096	3098	3099	Lord Denyer	447	' Rather an ordeal after India , I should think , '
3101	3114	3053	3054	her ladyship	951	' It is his native air . He will revel in it . '
3115	3122	3124	3125	his lordship	969	' Delicious country , no doubt , '
3910	3925	3927	3929	the court physician	1087	' One of the finest bits of acting I ever saw in my life , '
3931	3939	3927	3929	the court physician	1087	' Mademoiselle Mars never did anything better . '
3940	3949	3951	3952	Lord Denyer	447	' Do you really think it was acting ? '
3978	3983	3985	3986	the doctor	1088	' I know it , '
3988	4021	3985	3986	the doctor	1088	' I watched her while she was talking of Maulevrier , and I saw just one bead of perspiration break out on her upper lip an unmistakable sign of the mental struggle . '
4471	4493	4495	4496	Lady Diana	480	' If ever I have a house of my own , you shall have a better place in it , Steadman , '
4785	4843	4864	4864	she	480	' in Bond Street , a basket of fancy work , and her favourite Blenheim spaniel , Lalla Rookh ; but even these sources of amusement did not prevent the involuntary expression of weariness in occasional yawns , and frequent pacings up and down the room , where the formal hotel furniture had a comfortless and chilly look .
4930	4938	4939	4939	she	480	' His lordship is out of health , '
4942	4992	4939	4939	she	480	' and wants perfect rest and retirement . Now , Fellside is the only place we have in which he is likely to get perfect rest . Anywhere else we should have to entertain . Fellside is out of the world . There is no one to be entertained . '
4993	5007	5042	5043	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Except your neighbour , Wordsworth . I suppose you see him sometimes ? '
5008	5022	5024	5025	her ladyship	951	' Dear simple - minded old soul , he gives nobody any trouble , '
5027	5037	5039	5040	her friend	1158	' But is not Westmoreland very cold in winter ? '
5053	5057	5058	5058	she	524	' So sheltered , '
5061	5084	5058	5058	she	524	' We are at the base of the Fell . Loughrigg rises up like a cyclopean wall between us and the wind . '
5085	5096	5042	5043	Lady Maulevrier	524	' But when the wind is in the other direction ? '
5097	5116	5058	5058	she	524	' We have Nabb Scar . You do not know how we are girdled and defended by hills . '
5117	5121	5123	5124	the friend	1159	' Very pleasant , '
5126	5140	5123	5124	the friend	1159	' but for my own part I would rather winter in the south . '
5641	5646	5648	5649	his lordship	969	' A wretched afternoon , '
5672	5688	5662	5662	Steadman	478	' I had really underrated the disagreeableness of the English climate . It is abominable ! '
5689	5699	5701	5702	her ladyship	951	' To - day is not a fair sample , '
5709	5718	5701	5702	her ladyship	951	' we have had some pleasant autumn days . '
5719	5724	5726	5727	Lord Maulevrier	461	' I detest autumn ! '
5729	5757	5726	5727	Lord Maulevrier	461	' a season of dead leaves , damp , and dreariness . I should like to get away to Montpellier or Nice as soon as we can . '
5774	5785	5786	5786	she	951	' You surely would not dream of leaving the country , '
5789	5820	5786	5786	she	951	' under present circumstances . So long as you are here to answer all charges no one will interfere with your liberty ; but if you were to cross the Channel '
5821	5832	5834	5834	Maulevrier	461	' My slanderers might insinuate that I was running away , '
5836	5861	5834	5834	Maulevrier	461	' although the very fact of my return ought to prove to every one that I am able to meet and face this cabal . '
5862	5868	5870	5871	her ladyship	951	' Is it a cabal ? '
5884	5910	5870	5871	her ladyship	951	' Can you meet their charges ? Can you live down this hideous accusation , and hold up your head as a man of honour ? '
5947	5953	5954	5954	he	989	' I am not afraid , '
6214	6220	6222	6223	his wife	998	' You look very ill , '
6248	6273	6274	6274	He	989	' I am very ill . I have been worried to death surrounded by rogues and liars the victim of a most infernal conspiracy . '
6288	6302	6304	6305	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Do n't talk about it . You agitate yourself to no purpose , '
6323	6356	6304	6305	Lady Maulevrier	524	' If you are to face this scandal firmly and boldly next January , you must try to recover physical strength in the meanwhile . Mental energy may come with better health . '
6357	6365	6367	6368	Lord Maulevrier	461	' I shall never be any better , '
6372	6381	6367	6368	Lord Maulevrier	461	' that infernal climate has shattered my constitution . '
6382	6456	6304	6305	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Two or three months of perfect rest and good nursing will make a new man of you . I have arranged that we shall go straight from here to Fellside . No one can plague you there with that disguised impertinence called sympathy . You can give all your thoughts to the ordeal before you , and be ready to meet your accusers . Fortunately , you have no Burke against you . '
6457	6467	6367	6368	Lord Maulevrier	461	' Fellside ? You think of going to Fellside ? '
6468	6517	6304	6305	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Yes . You know how fond I am of that place . I little thought when you settled it upon me a cottage in Westmoreland with fifty acres of garden and meadow so utterly insignificant that I should ever like it better than any of your places . '
6518	6563	6367	6368	Lord Maulevrier	461	' A charming retreat in summer ; but we have never wintered there ? What put it into your head to go there at such a season as this ? Why , I daresay the snow is on the tops of the hills already . '
6564	6582	6584	6585	Lady Maulevrier	524	' It is the only place I know where you will not be watched and talked about , '
6587	6618	6584	6585	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You will be out of the eye of the world . I should think that consideration would weigh more with you than two or three degrees of the thermometer . '
6619	6624	6626	6627	the Earl	1111	' I detest cold , '
6629	6637	6626	6627	the Earl	1111	' and in my weak health - - '
6638	6646	6648	6649	her ladyship	951	' We will take care of you , '
6784	6794	6796	6797	his wife	998	' You can make all your preparations at Fellside , '
6801	6829	6796	6797	his wife	998	' I have seen Messrs. Rigby and Rider , and your own particular ally , Rigby , will go to you at Fellside whenever you want him . '
6830	6841	6843	6844	his lordship	969	' That is not like my being on the spot , '
6869	6892	6796	6797	his wife	998	' I ought to be on the spot . I am not without influence ; I have friends , men in power . '
6893	6955	6843	6843	his	1111	' Surely you are not going to appeal to friendship in order to vindicate your honour . These charges are true or false . If they are false your own manhood , your own rectitude , can face them and trample upon them , unaided by back - stairs influence . If they are true , no one can help you . '
6956	6975	6977	6978	the Earl	1111	' I think you , at least , ought to know that they are as false as hell , '
6988	6998	7000	7001	his wife	998	' I have acted as if I so believed , '
7003	7041	7000	7001	his wife	998	' I have lived as if there were no such slanders in the air . I have steadily ignored every report , every insinuation have held my head as high as if I knew you were immaculate . '
7042	7050	7052	7053	the Earl	1111	' I expected as much from you , '
7057	7076	7052	7053	the Earl	1111	' If I had not known you were a woman of sense I should not have married you . '
7637	7650	7652	7653	the Earl	1111	' You ought not to have brought me here in such weather , '
7678	7693	7661	7661	he	1111	' What is to become of us if we are caught in a snowstorm ? '
7694	7719	7721	7722	Lady Maulevrier	524	' We shall have no snow worth talking about before we are safely housed at Fellside , and then we can defy the elements , '
7885	7894	7895	7895	he	461	' It was murder to bring me here , '
7901	7933	7895	7895	he	461	' If I had gone to Hastings I should have been a new man by this time . As it is I am a great deal worse than when I landed . '
7974	7982	7983	7984	the landlord	1267	' I saw death in his face , '
8270	8276	8277	8277	he	1111	' As black as Erebus ! '
8280	8303	8277	8277	he	1111	' but we ought to be close at home by this time . Yes , thank God , there are the lights . '
8319	8361	8313	8313	Steadman	478	' Very sorry , my lord . The horses must have taken a wrong turn after we crossed the bridge . And now the men say they ca n't go back to Fellside unless we can get fresh horses ; and I 'm
8371	8371	8313	8313	Steadman	478	'
8372	8375	8377	8378	the Earl	1111	' Here ! '
8380	8394	8377	8378	the Earl	1111	' what do you mean by here ? Where the devil are we ? '
8395	8402	8313	8313	Steadman	478	' Great Langdale , my lord . '
8503	8511	8513	8514	the Earl	1111	' Have you any post - horses ? '
8533	8546	8530	8530	his	1267	' No , sir . We do n't keep post - horses . '
8547	8560	8562	8563	the Earl	1111	' Of course not . I knew as much before I asked , '
8565	8587	8530	8530	his	1267	' We are fixed in this dismal hole for the night , I suppose . How far are we from Fellside ? '
8588	8592	8594	8595	the landlord	1267	' Seven miles , '
8597	8615	8616	8616	he	1267	' I beg your pardon , my lord ; I did n't know it was your lordship , '
8621	8623	8616	8616	he	1267	' We 're
8647	8647	8616	8616	he	1267	'
8648	8659	8661	8662	the Earl	1111	' Is there no hope of getting on , Steadman ? '
8669	8678	8616	8616	he	1267	' Not with these horses , my lord . '
8679	8706	8616	8616	he	1267	' And you hear we ca n't get any others . Is there any farmer about here who could lend us a pair of carriage horses ? '
8715	8737	8739	8740	Lord Maulevrier	461	' Then we must stop here till to - morrow morning . What infernal fools those post - boys must be , '
8885	8892	8894	8895	her ladyship	951	' We might be worse off , '
8923	8934	8936	8937	her husband	989	' Hardly , unless we were out on the moor , '
8939	8975	8936	8937	her husband	989	' I am sick to death of this ill - advised , unreasonable journey . I am at a loss to imagine your motive in bringing me here . You must have had a motive . '
8976	8980	8982	8983	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I had , '
8990	9010	8982	8983	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I wanted to get you out of the way . I told you that plainly enough at Southampton . '
9011	9025	9027	9028	Lord Maulevrier	461	' I do n't see why I should be hurried away and hidden , '
9030	9041	9027	9028	Lord Maulevrier	461	' I must face my accusers , sooner or later . '
9042	9071	8982	8983	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Of course . The day of reckoning must come . But in the meantime have you no delicacy ? Do you want to be pointed at everywhere ? '
9072	9083	9085	9086	her husband	989	' All I know is that I am very ill , '
9088	9101	9085	9086	her husband	989	' and that this wretched journey has made me twenty years older . '
9102	9135	8982	8983	Lady Maulevrier	524	' We shall be safe at home before noon to - morrow , and you can have Horton to set you right again . You know you always believed in his skill . '
9136	9165	9167	9168	his lordship	969	' Horton is a clever fellow enough , as country doctors go ; but at Hastings I could have had the best physicians in London to see me , '
9200	9206	9208	9209	the Earl	1111	' I sha n't dine , '
9211	9236	9208	9209	the Earl	1111	' I am a great deal too ill and cold . Light a fire in my room , girl , and send Steadman to me '
9247	9267	9239	9245	the footman , who hastened to obey	1322	' You can send me up a basin of soup presently . I shall go to bed at once . '
9313	9322	9324	9325	her ladyship	951	' I do not care about dining alone , '
9327	9352	9324	9325	her ladyship	951	' We lunched at Windermere , and I have no appetite . You can clear away those things , and bring me some tea . '
9411	9421	9423	9424	her correspondent	1329	' I am very sorry he has come home , '
9426	9643	9423	9424	her correspondent	1329	' and yet if he had stayed in India there must have been an investigation on the spot . A public inquiry is inevitable , and the knowledge of his arrival in the country will precipitate matters . From all I hear I much fear that there is no chance of the result being favourable to him . You have asked me to write the unvarnished truth , to be brutal even , remember . His delinquencies are painfully notorious , and I apprehend that the last sixpence he owns will be answerable . His landed estate I am told can also be confiscated , in the event of an impeachment at the bar of the House of Lords , as in the Warren Hastings case . But as yet nobody seems clear as to the form which the investigation will take . In reply to your inquiry as to what would have happened if his lordship had died on the passage home , I believe I am justified in saying the scandal would have been allowed to die with him . He has contrived to provoke powerful animosities both in the Cabinet and at the India House , and there is , I fear , an intention to pursue the inquiry to the bitter end . '
9682	9692	9693	9693	she	951	' If he had died upon the passage home ! '
9696	9718	9693	9693	she	951	' Would to God that he had so died , and that my son 's name and fortune could be saved . '
9947	9969	9970	9970	she	1341	' I was afraid your fire must be getting low , and that you 'd be amost starved , my lady , '
9989	10004	9970	9970	she	1341	' Such a dreadful night . So early in the year , too . I 'm
10014	10014	9970	9970	she	1341	'
10015	10022	10024	10025	Lady Maulevrier	524	' That does not always follow , '
10027	10033	10024	10025	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Has Steadman come downstairs ? '
10034	10062	9970	9970	she	1341	' Yes , my lady . He told me to tell your ladyship that his lordship is pretty comfortable , and hopes to pass a good night . '
10063	10102	10024	10025	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I am glad to hear it . You can give me another room , I suppose . It would be better for his lordship not to be disturbed , as he is very much out of health . '
10103	10118	9970	9970	she	1341	' There is another room , my lady , but it 's very small . '
10119	10134	10024	10025	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I do n't mind how small , if it is clean and airy . '
10135	10165	10167	10168	the landlady	1341	' Yes , my lady . I am thankful to say you wo n't find dirt or stuffiness anywhere in this house . His lordship do look mortal badly , '
10175	10281	10171	10171	her	1341	' and I remember him such a fine young gentleman , when he used to come down the Rothay with the otter hounds , running along the bank joomping in and out of the beck up to his knees in the water and now to see him , so white and mashiated , and broken - down like , in the very prime of life , all along of living out in a hot country , among blackamoors , which is used to it poor , ignorant creatures and never knew no better . It must be a hard trial for you , my lady . '
10282	10289	10024	10025	Lady Maulevrier	524	' It is a hard trial . '
10290	10303	10305	10306	the woman	1346	' Ah ! we all have our trials , rich and poor , '
10370	10380	10972	10973	her ladyship	951	' We all have our trials high and low . '
10381	10386	10388	10389	Lady Maulevrier	524	' That reminds me , '
10396	10410	10388	10389	Lady Maulevrier	524	' your husband said you were in trouble . What did that mean ? '
10411	10576	11104	11104	her	1352	' Sickness in the house , my lady . A brother of mine that went to America to make his fortune , and seemed to be doing so well for the first five or six years , and wrote home such beautiful letters , and then left off writing all at once , and we made sure as he was dead , and never got a word from him for ten years , and just three weeks ago he drops in upon us as we was sitting over our tea between the lights , looking as white as a ghost . I gave a shriek when I saw him , for I was regular scared out of my senses . " Robert 's ghost ! " I cried ; but it was Robert himself , come home to us to die . And he 's lying upstairs now , with so little life in him that I expect every breath to be his last . '
10577	10583	10388	10389	Lady Maulevrier	524	' What is his complaint ? '
10584	10609	11104	11104	her	1352	' Apathy , my lady . Dear , dear , that 's not it . I never do remember the doctor 's foreign names . '
10610	10613	10388	10389	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Atrophy , '
10616	10641	11104	11104	her	1352	' Yes , my lady , that was it . Happen such crack - jaw words come easy to a scholar like your ladyship . '
10642	10650	11104	11104	her	1352	' Does the doctor give no hope ? '
10651	10751	10753	10754	the landlady	1341	' Well , no , my lady . He do n't go so far as to say there 's no hope , though Robert has been badly so long . It all depends , he says , upon the rallying power of the constitution . The lungs are not gone , and the heart is not diseased . If there 's rallying power , Robert will come round , and if there is n't he 'll sink . But the doctor says nature will have to make an effort . But I have my own idea about the case , '
10760	10766	11104	11104	her	1352	' What is your idea ? '
10767	10945	11104	11104	her	1352	' That our Robert was marked for death when he came into this house , and that he meant what he said when he spoke of coming home to die . Things had gone against him for the last ten years in America . He married and took his wife out to a farm in the Bush , and thought to make a good thing out of farming with the bit of brass he 'd saved at heeam . But America is n't Gert Langdale , you see , my lady , and his knowledge stood him in no stead in the Bush ; and first he lost his money , and he fashed himself terrible about that , and then he lost a child or two , and then he lost his wife , and he came back to us a broken - hearted man , with no wish to live . The doctor may call it atrophy , but I will call it what the Scripture calls it , a broken and a wounded spirit . '
10946	10952	11104	11104	her	1352	' Who is your doctor ? '
10953	10960	11104	11104	her	1352	' Mr. Evans , of Ambleside . '
10961	10970	10972	10973	her ladyship	951	' That little half - blind old man ! '
10975	10984	10972	10973	her ladyship	951	' Surely you have no confidence in him ? '
10985	11091	11104	11104	her	1352	' Not much , my lady . But I do n't believe all the doctors in London could do anything for Robert . Good nursing will bring him round if anything can ; and he gets that , I can assure your ladyship . He 's my only brother , the only kith and kin that 's left to me , and he and I were gay fond of each other when he was young . You may be sure I do n't spare any trouble , and my good man thinks the best of his larder or his celler hardly good enough for Robert . '
11092	11102	11104	11105	her ladyship	951	' I am sure you are kind good people , '
11108	11160	11104	11105	her ladyship	951	' but I should have thought Mr. Horton , of Grasmere , could have done more than old Evans . However , you know best . I hope his lordship is not going to add to your cares by being laid up here , but he looked very ill this evening . '
11161	11171	11104	11104	her	1352	' He did , my lady , mortal bad . '
11172	11235	11104	11105	her ladyship	951	' However , we must hope for the best . Steadman is a splendid servant in illness . He nursed my father for years . Will you tell him to come to me , if you please ? I want to hear what he thinks of his lordship , and to discuss the chances of our getting home early to - morrow . '
11353	11366	11368	11369	the landlord	1267	' Do you think his lordship will be well enough to travel ? '
11371	11385	11387	11387	Steadman	478	' He has made up his mind to get home ill or well , '
11389	11416	11387	11387	Steadman	478	' He has wasted about a week by his dawdling ways on the road ; and now he 's in a fever to get to Fellside . '
11781	11786	11777	11786	the doctor to be ' much the same . '	7021	' much the same . '
11961	11975	11977	11977	Steadman	478	' You are too late to be of any use , Mr. Evans , '
12022	12028	11995	11995	They	1397	' When did this happen ? '
12029	12044	12046	12046	Steadman	478	' A quarter of an hour after the messenger rode off to fetch you , '
12048	12140	12046	12046	Steadman	478	' His lordship lay all the afternoon in a heavy sleep , and we thought he was going on well ; but after dark there was a difficulty in his breathing which alarmed her ladyship , and she insisted upon you being sent for . The messenger had hardly been gone a quarter of an hour when his lordship woke suddenly , muttered to himself in a curious way , gave just one long drawn sigh , and and all was over . It was a terrible shock for her ladyship . '
12141	12148	12150	12152	the village doctor	1402	' Indeed it must have been , '
12154	12195	12150	12152	the village doctor	1402	' It is a great surprise to me . I knew Lord Maulevrier was low , very low , the pulse feeble and intermittent ; but I had no fear of anything of this kind . It is very sudden . '
12196	12204	12206	12206	Steadman	478	' Yes , it is awfully sudden , '
12218	12249	12210	12210	he	478	' You will give the necessary certificate , I hope , with as little trouble to her ladyship as possible . This is a dreadful blow , and she - - '
12250	12269	12150	12152	the village doctor	1402	' She shall not be troubled . The body will be removed to - morrow , I suppose . '
12270	12334	12210	12210	he	478	' Yes . He must be buried from his own house . I sent a second messenger to Ambleside for the undertaker . He will be here very soon , no doubt , and if the shell is ready by noon to - morrow , the body can be removed then . I have arranged to get her ladyship away to - night . '
12335	12342	12150	12152	the village doctor	1402	' So late ? After midnight ? '
12343	12381	12210	12210	he	478	' Why not ? She can not stay in this small house so near the dead . There is a moon , and there is no snow falling , and we are within seven miles of Fellside . '
12717	12723	12725	12726	Lady Mary	445	' What a horrid day ! '
12979	12981	12959	12959	She	499	' Lieder '
13526	13628	13518	13519	the Countess	1463	' minds , while for their physical training she provided another teacher in the person of a clever little Parisian dancing mistress , who had set up at the West - End of London as a teacher of dancing and calisthenics , and had utterly failed to find pupils enough to pay her rent and keep her modest pot - au - feu going . Mademoiselle Thiebart was very glad to exchange the uncertainties of a first floor in North Audley Street for the comfort and security of Fellside Manor , with a salary of one hundred and fifty pounds a year .
13959	13979	13980	13980	she	445	' I would much rather spend all my life among these dear hills than marry a nobody in London , '
13997	14037	13980	13980	she	445	' If you do n't think people will like me and admire me a little you had better save yourself the trouble of taking me to London . I do n't want to play second fiddle to my sister . '
14038	14055	14062	14062	her	445	' You are a very impertinent person , and deserve to be taken at your word , '
14064	14080	14062	14062	her	445	' but I have no doubt before you are twenty you will tell another story . '
14081	14084	14086	14086	Mary	445	' Oh ! '
14093	14106	14086	14086	Mary	445	' then I am not to come out till I am twenty . '
14107	14114	14116	14117	the Countess	1463	' That will be soon enough , '
14119	14148	14116	14117	the Countess	1463	' It will take you as long to get rid of those odious freckles . And no doubt by that time Lesbia will have made a brilliant marriage . '
14570	14573	14574	14574	she	445	' Oh , '
14590	14639	14584	14584	her	499	' how I wished something would happen anything to stir us out of this statuesque , sleeping - beauty state of being . I verily believe the spiders are all asleep in the ivy , and the mice behind the wainscot , and the horses in the stable . '
14640	14645	14647	14647	Lesbia	499	' What could happen ? '
14657	14662	14647	14647	Lesbia	499	' Are not these lovely lines
14699	14699	14584	14584	her	499	'
14700	14726	14728	14728	Mary	445	' Very well for your sleepy Keats , but I do n't suppose you would have noticed the passage if marigolds were not in fashion , '
14736	14782	14728	14728	Mary	445	' What could happen ? Why a hundred things an earthquake , flood , or fire . What could happen , do you say , Lesbia ? Why Maulevrier might come home unexpectedly , and charm us out of this death - in - life . '
14783	14796	14798	14798	Lesbia	499	' He would occasion a good deal of unpleasantness if he did , '
14802	14812	14798	14798	Lesbia	499	' You know how angry he has made grandmother . '
14813	14828	14830	14830	Mary	445	' Because he keeps race - horses which have an unlucky knack of losing , '
14834	14847	14830	14830	Mary	445	' I suppose if his horses won , grandmother would rather approve ? '
14848	14919	14798	14798	Lesbia	499	' Not at all . That would make hardly any difference , except that he would not ruin himself quite so quickly . Grandmother says that a young man who goes on the turf is sure to be ruined sooner or later . And then Maulevrier 's habits are altogether wild and foolish . It is very hard upon grandmother , who has such noble ambition for all of us . '
14920	14925	14927	14927	Mary	445	' Not for me , '
14930	15009	14927	14927	Mary	445	' Her views about me are very humble . She considers that I shall be most fortunate if a doctor or a lawyer condescend to like me well enough to make me an offer . He might make me the offer without liking me , for the sake of hearing himself and his wife announced as Mr. and Lady Mary Snooks at dinner parties . That would be too horrid ! But I daresay such things have happened . '
15010	15018	15020	15020	Lesbia	499	' Do n't talk nonsense , Mary , '
15024	15051	15020	15020	Lesbia	499	' There is no reason why you should not make a really good marriage , if you follow grandmother 's advice and do n't affect eccentricity . '
15052	15061	14927	14927	Mary	445	' I do n't affect eccentricity , but I 'm
15068	15074	14927	14927	Mary	445	' murmured Mary , meekly , '
15098	15098	14927	14927	Mary	445	'
15099	15114	15116	15116	Lesbia	499	' I daresay you will have tamed down a little before you are presented , '
15356	15362	15352	15354	the young man	1503	' no end of chums . '
18480	18493	18495	18495	Lesbia	499	' I shall be an old woman before I appear in society , '
18499	18526	18495	18495	Lesbia	499	' and I shall be like a wild woman of the woods ; for I have seen nothing , and know nothing of the civilised world . '
18527	18555	18557	18558	the dowager	1629	' You will be ever so much more attractive than the young women I hear of , who have seen and known a great deal too much , '
19133	19149	19151	19151	Lesbia	499	' One can tell when Mary is at home by a perpetual banging of doors , '
19873	19879	19881	19881	Lesbia	499	' What terribly hoydenish manners ! '
19936	19952	19954	19955	Lady Maulevrier	524	' What was the matter with Mary that she rushed off like a mad woman ? '
19963	19993	19954	19955	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I have n't the least idea . Mary 's movements are quite beyond the limits of my comprehension . Perhaps she has gone after a bird's - nest . '
20223	20226	20228	20228	Maulevrier	461	' Hulloa ! '
20230	20242	20228	20228	Maulevrier	461	' There 's Molly . How d'ye do , old girl ? '
20281	20319	20243	20245	The two men	1790	' O , Maulevrier , I am so glad ! I have been pining for you . Why did n't you write to say you were coming ? It would have been something to look forward to . '
20320	20350	20400	20400	Mary	445	' Could n't . Never knew from day to day what I was going to be up to ; besides , I knew I should find you at home . '
20351	20361	20363	20363	Mary	445	' Of course . We are always at home , '
20365	20385	20363	20363	Mary	445	' go up to the house as fast as ever you can . I 'll go and tell grandmother . '
20386	20396	20398	20398	Maulevrier	461	' And tell them to get us some dinner , '
20427	20433	20435	20435	Maulevrier	461	' We need n't hurry , '
20453	20463	20435	20435	Maulevrier	461	' We shall have to wait for our dinner . '
20464	20475	20477	20478	the other	1789	' And we shall have to change our dusty clothes , '
20480	20492	20477	20478	the other	1789	' I hope that man will bring our portmanteaux in time . '
20493	20514	20435	20435	Maulevrier	461	' Oh , we need n't dress . We can spend the evening in my den , if you like ! '
20545	20557	20559	20560	her ladyship	951	' Mary , may I ask the meaning of this excitement , '
20570	20576	20477	20478	the other	1789	' Maulevrier has come home . '

20582	20590	20477	20478	the other	1789	' And he has brought a friend . '
20591	20617	20435	20435	Maulevrier	461	' Indeed ! He might have done me the honour to inquire if his friend 's visit would be agreeable . What kind of person ? '
20618	20652	20477	20478	the other	1789	' I have no idea . I did n't look at him . Maulevrier is looking so well . They will be here in a minute . May I order dinner for them ? '
20653	20662	20664	20665	her ladyship	951	' Of course , they must have dinner , '
20789	20820	20782	20782	Maulevrier	461	' How d'ye do , grandmother ? how do , Lesbia ? This is my very good friend and Canadian travelling companion , Jack Hammond Lady Maulevrier , Lady Lesbia . '
20821	20831	20833	20834	the dowager	1629	' Very glad to see you , Mr. Hammond , '

21223	21254	21220	21221	her ladyship	951	' Your usual habits are as restless as if your life were a disease . It shall not be my fault if you and Mr. Hammond are uncomfortable at Fellside . '

21807	21822	21805	21805	Maulevrier	461	' come and tell me about the terriers , while I eat my dinner . '

21910	21942	21905	21905	she	499	' Is he to live with us , and be one of us , a person of whose belongings we know positively nothing , who owns that his people are common ? '
21943	21966	21876	21876	herself	499	' My dear , he is your brother 's friend , and we have the right to suppose he is a gentleman . '
21967	21973	21975	21975	Lesbia	499	' Not on that account , '
21984	22021	21975	21975	Lesbia	499	' Did n't he make a friend , or almost a friend of Jack Howell , the huntsman , and of Ford , the wrestler . I have no confidence in Maulevrier 's ideas of fitness . '

22047	22076	22042	22043	her ladyship	951	' and in the meantime we must tolerate him , and be grateful to him if he reconcile Maulevrier to remaining at Fellside for the next six weeks . '

23372	23380	23382	23383	Mr. Hammond	525	' Good - night , Lady Mary , '
23451	23465	23471	23471	he	969	' Well , Jack , what do you think of my beauty sister ? '
23542	23588	23528	23528	Mary	445	' What can any man think except that she is as lovely as the finest of Reynold 's portraits , as that Lady Diana Beauclerk of Colonel Aldridge 's , or the Kitty Fisher , or any example you please to name of womanly loveliness ? '
23589	23595	23597	23597	Maulevrier	461	' Glad to hear it , '
23603	23663	23597	23597	Maulevrier	461	' ca n't say I admire her myself not my style , do n't you know . Too much of my lady Di too little of poor Kitty . But still , of course , it always pleases a fellow to know that his people are admired ; and I know that my grandmother has views , grand views , '
23670	23675	23677	23677	he	461	' Shall I break ? '
23686	23690	23692	23693	Mr. Hammond	525	' Thank you , '
23699	23747	23692	23693	Mr. Hammond	525	' Matrimonial views , of course . Very natural that her ladyship should expect such a lovely creature to make a great match . Is there no one in view ? Has there been no family conclave no secret treaty ? Is the young lady fancy free ? '

She has been buried alive here ; except parsons and a few decent people whom she is allowed to meet now and then at the houses about here , she has seen nothing of the world . My grandmother has kept Lesbia as close as a nun . She is not so fond of Molly , and that young person has wild ways of her own , and gives everybody the slip . By - the - by , how do you like my little Moll ? '
23951	23953	23955	23956	Lady Mary	445	' I 'm

23977	24053	23955	23956	Lady Mary	445	' Oh , Molly is rather farouche in her manners ; never would train fine , do n't you know . Her ladyship lectured till she was tired , and now Mary runs wild , and I suppose will be left at grass till six months before her presentation , and then they 'll put her on the pillar - reins a bit to give her a better mouth . Good shot , by Jove ! '
24349	24499	24500	24501	Mr. Hammond	525	' rooms and coach - houses , which had no windows upon this inner enclosed side . The old buildings were low and irregular , one portion of the roof thatched , another tiled . In the quadrangle there was an old - fashioned garden , with geometrical flower - beds , a yew tree hedge , and a stone sun - dial in the centre . A peacock stalked about in the morning light , and greeted the newly risen sun with a discordant scream . Presently a man came out of a half glass door under a verandah which shaded one side of the quadrangle , and strolled about the garden , stopping here and there to cut a dead rose , or trim a geranium , a stoutly - built broad shouldered man , with gray hair and beard , the image of well - fed respectability .

24666	24683	24664	24664	Mary	445	' She is a most perfect darling , and laughs so deliciously whenever she sees me . '
24867	24874	24833	24833	she	445	' Rest , and be Thankful , '

25473	25482	25483	25483	she	524	' After all , what does it matter ? '
25493	25550	25483	25483	she	524	' I have only to marry my granddaughters creditably , and prevent my grandson going to the dogs , and then my mission on this insignificant planet will be accomplished . What new form that particular modification of molecules which you call Lady Maulevrier may take afterwards is hidden in the great mystery of material life . '

26109	26118	26106	26106	she	543	' I saw you from my bedroom window . '
26119	26141	26072	26072	He	526	' Did you ? Then I suppose yours is one of the few windows which look into that curious old quadrangle ? '
26142	26221	26106	26106	she	543	' No , there are no windows looking into the quadrangle . Those that were in the original plan of the house were walled up at her ladyship 's orders , to keep out the cold winds which sweep down from the hills in winter and early spring , when the edge of Loughrigg Fell is white with snow . My window looks into the gardens , and I saw you there with his lordship and Lady Mary . '
26466	26478	26480	26480	Maulevrier	524	' What are you going to do with yourself this morning ? '
26488	26493	26495	26495	Hammond	526	' Anything you like , '
26497	26522	26495	26495	Hammond	526	' Stay , there is one pilgrimage I am eager to make . I must see Wordsworth 's grave , and Wordsworth 's house . '
26523	26560	26480	26480	Maulevrier	524	' You shall see them both , but they are in opposite directions one at your elbow , the other a four mile walk . Which will you see first ? We 'll toss for it , '
26578	26634	26480	26480	Maulevrier	524	' Heads , house ; tails , grave . Tails it is . Come and have a smoke , and see the poet 's grave . The splendour of the monument , the exquisite neatness with which it is kept , will astound you , considering that we live in a period of Wordsworth worship . '
26644	26650	26652	26652	Maulevrier	524	' Are n't you coming ? '
26657	26671	26652	26652	Maulevrier	524	' It was a fair offer . I 've got my cigarette case . '
26672	26676	26652	26652	Maulevrier	524	' Yes , I 'm
26679	26688	26652	26652	Maulevrier	524	' answered the other , with a disappointed air .
26714	26730	26652	26652	Maulevrier	524	' Will you come with us , Lady Lesbia ? We 'll suppress the cigarettes ! '
26731	26736	26737	26737	she	499	' Thanks , no , '
26744	26751	26737	26737	she	499	' I am going to practice . '
26752	26768	26652	26652	Maulevrier	524	' Do you never walk in the morning on such a lovely morning as this ? '
26769	26774	26737	26737	she	499	' Not very often . '
26819	26822	26824	26824	Maulevrier	524	' Filons ! '
27138	27145	27147	27147	Maulevrier	524	' You like my sister Lesbia ? '
27149	27169	27111	27111	They	1793	' Like her ! well , yes . The difficulty with most men must be not to worship her . '
27170	27185	27111	27111	They	1793	' Ah , she 's not my style . And she 's beastly proud . '
27186	27202	27111	27111	They	1793	' A little hauteur gives piquancy to her beauty ; I admire a grand woman . '
27203	27300	27111	27111	They	1793	' So do I in a picture . Titian 's Queen of Cyprus , or any party of that kind ; but for flesh and blood I like humility a woman who knows she is human , and not infallible , and only just a little better than you or me . When I choose a wife , she will be no such example of cultivated perfection as my sister Lesbia . I want no goddess , but a nice little womanly woman , to jog along the rough and tumble road of life with me . '
27301	27355	27111	27111	They	1793	' Lady Maulevrier 's influence , no doubt , has in a great measure determined the bent of your sister 's character : and from what you have told me about her ladyship , I should think a fixed idea of her own superiority would be inevitable in any girl trained by her . '
27356	27400	27402	27402	Maulevrier	524	' Yes , she is a proud woman a proud , hard woman and she has steeped Lesbia 's mind in all her own pet ideas and prejudices . Yet , God knows , we have little reason to hold our heads high , '
27459	27486	27488	27488	Maulevrier	524	' Does n't somebody say there is always a skeleton in the cupboard , and the nobler and more ancient the race the bigger the skeleton ? '
27495	27550	27488	27488	Maulevrier	524	' Yes , your family secret is an attribute of a fine old race . The Pelopida , for instance in their case it was not a single skeleton , but a whole charnel house . I do n't think your skeleton need trouble you , Maulevrier . It belongs to the remote past . '
27551	27560	27562	27564	the young man	1503	' Those things never belong to the past , '
27566	27653	27562	27564	the young man	1503	' If it were any other kind of taint profligacy madness , even the story of a duel that went very near murder a runaway wife a rebellious son a cruel husband . I have heard such stories hinted at in the records of families . But our story means disgrace . I seldom see strangers putting their heads together at the club without fancying they are telling each other about my grandfather , and pointing me out as the grandson and heir of a thief . '
27654	27661	27488	27488	Maulevrier	524	' Why use unduly hard words ? '
27662	27704	27562	27564	the young man	1503	' Why should I stoop to sophistication with you , my friend . Dishonesty is dishonesty all the world over ; and to plunder Rajahs on a large scale is no less vile than to pick a pocket on Ludgate Hill . '
27705	27714	27488	27488	Maulevrier	524	' Nothing was ever proved against your grandfather . '
27715	27834	27562	27564	the young man	1503	' No , he died in the nick of time , and the inquiry was squashed , thanks to the Angersthorpe interest , and my grandmother 's cleverness . But if he had lived a few weeks longer England would have rung with the story of his profligacy and dishonour . Some people say he committed suicide in order to escape the inquiry ; but I have heard my mother emphatically deny this . My father told her that he had often talked with the people who kept the little inn where his father died , and they were clear enough in their assertion that the death was a natural death the sudden collapse of an exhausted constitution . '
27835	27857	27858	27858	Hammond	526	' Was it on account of this scandal that your father spent the best part of his life away from England ? '
27944	28297	27905	27905	Maulevrier	524	' I have very little doubt it was so though I was n't old enough when he died to hear as much from his own lips . My father went straight from the University to Vienna , where he began his career in the diplomatic service , and where he soon afterwards married a dowerless English girl of good family . He went to Rio as first secretary , and died of fever within seven years of his marriage , leaving a widow and three babies , the youngest in long clothes . Mother and babies all came over to England , and were at once established at Fellside . I can remember the voyage and I can remember my poor mother who never recovered the blow of my father 's death , and who died in yonder house , after five years of broken health and broken spirits . We had no one but the dowager to look to as children hardly another friend in the world . She did what she liked with us ; she kept the girls as close as nuns , so they have never heard a hint of the old history ; no breach of scandal has reached their ears . But she could not shut me up in a country house for ever , though she did succeed in keeping me away from a public school . The time came when I had to go to the University , and there I heard all that had been said about Lord Maulevrier . The men who told me about the old scandal in a friendly way pretended not to believe it ; but one night , when I had got into a row at a wine - party with a tailor 's son , he told me that if his father was a snip my grandfather was a thief , and so he thought himself the better bred of the two . I smashed his nose for him , but as it was a decided pug before the row began , that hardly squared the matter . '
28298	28307	28687	28687	He	2055	' Did you ever hear the exact story ? '
28308	28607	27905	27905	Maulevrier	524	' I have heard a dozen stories ; and if only a quarter of them are true my grandfather was a scoundrel . It seems that he was immensely popular for the first year or so of his government , gave more splendid entertainments than had been given at Madras for half a century before his time , lavished his wealth upon his favourites . Then arose a rumour that the governor was insolvent and harassed by his creditors , and then a new source of wealth seemed to be at his command ; he was more reckless , more princely than ever ; and then , little by little , there arose the suspicion that he was trafficking in English interests , selling his influence to petty princes , winking at those mysterious crimes by which rightful heirs are pushed aside to make room for usurpers . Lastly it became notorious that he was the slave of a wicked woman , false wife , suspected murderess , whose husband , a native prince , disappeared from the scene just when his existence became perilous to the governor 's reputation . According to one version of the story , the scandal of this Rajah 's mysterious disappearance , followed not long after by the Ranee 's equally mysterious death , was the immediate cause of my grandfather 's recall . How much , or how little of this story or other dark stories of the same kind is true , whether my grandfather was a consummate scoundrel , or the victim of a baseless slander , whether he left India a rich man or a poor man , is known to no mortal except Lady Maulevrier , and compared with her the Theban Sphinx was a communicative individual . '
28608	28616	28618	28618	Hammond	524	' Let the dead bury their dead , '
28620	28686	28618	28618	Hammond	524	' Neither you nor your sisters can be the worse for this ancient slander . No doubt every part of the story has been distorted and exaggerated in the telling ; and a great deal of it may be pure invention , evolved from the inner consciousness of the slanderer . God forbid that any whisper of scandal should ever reach Lady Lesbia 's ears . '
28724	28733	28734	28734	he	2055	' As for you , dear old fellow , '
28741	28759	28734	28734	he	2055	' no one will ever think the worse of you on account of your grandfather 's peccadilloes . '
28760	28844	28876	28876	Maulevrier	524	' Yes , they will . Hereditary genius is one of our modern crazes . When a man 's grandfather was a rogue , there must be a taint in his blood . People do n't believe in spontaneous generation , moral or physical , now - a - days . Typhoid breeds typhoid , and typhus breeds typhus , just as dog breeds dog ; and who will believe that a cheat and a liar can be the father of honest men ? '
28845	28870	28872	28872	Hammond	524	' In that case , knowing what kind of man the grandson is , I will never believe that the grandfather was a rogue , '
28894	28927	28929	28929	Hammond	524	' As for her ladyship , I respect and honour her as a woman who has led a life of self - sacrifice , and has worn her pride as an armour , '
28931	28944	28946	28946	Maulevrier	524	' Yes , I believe the dowager 's character is rather fine , '
28948	29057	28946	28946	Maulevrier	524	' but she and I have never hit our horses very well together . She would have liked such a fellow as you for a grandson , Jack a man who took high honours at Oxford , and could hold his own against all comers . Such a grandson would have gratified her pride , and would have repaid her for the trouble she had taken in nursing the Maulevrier estate ; for however poor a property it was when her husband went to India there is no doubt that it is a very fine estate now , and that the dowager has been the making of it . '
29205	29213	29216	29216	Molly	445	' No wonder Mr. Hammond admires her , '
29766	29769	29771	29771	Lesbia	499	' Poor Wordsworth '
29805	29855	29774	29774	she	499	' Is it not pitiable to think of the years he spent in this monotonous place , without any society worth speaking of , with only the shabbiest collection of books , with hardly any interest in life except the sky , and the hills , and the peasantry ? '
29856	29874	29876	29876	Hammond	525	' I think Wordsworth 's was an essentially happy life , in spite of his narrow range , '
29878	29935	29876	29876	Hammond	525	' You , with your ardent youth and vivid desire for a life of action , can not imagine the calm blisses of reverie and constant communion with nature . Wordsworth had a thousand companions you and I would never dream of ; for him every flower that grows was an individual existence almost a soul . '
29936	29974	29976	29976	Lesbia	499	' It was a mild kind of lunacy , an everlasting opium dream without the opium ; but I am grateful to him for living such a life , since it has bequeathed us some exquisite poetry , '
29991	30004	30006	30006	Molly	445	' I do believe there 's an otter just under that bank , '
30047	30056	30058	30058	Maulevrier	461	' Let him alone , ca n't you ? '
30060	30099	30058	30058	Maulevrier	461	' leave him in peace till he 's wanted . If you disturb him now he 'll desert his holt , and we may have a blank day . The hounds are to be out to - morrow . '
30100	30107	30109	30109	Mary	445	' I may go with you ? '
30113	30128	30129	30129	Molly	445	' Well , yes , I suppose you 'll want to be in it . '
30215	30227	30229	30229	Lesbia	499	' What would grandmother say if she were to see you ! '
30238	30255	30257	30257	Mary	445	' I am not going to let her see me , so she will say nothing , '
30267	30274	30261	30261	she	445	' Ammon , Agag , Angelina ; '
30390	30403	30405	30405	Lesbia	499	' Oh , grandmother , why did you not take your tea ! '
30411	30417	30405	30405	Lesbia	499	' It is six o'clock . '
30418	30433	30435	30436	the dowager	1629	' I am used to have you at home to hand me my cup , '
30444	30450	30452	30452	Lesbia	499	' I am so sorry , '
30468	30502	30452	30452	Lesbia	499	' Indeed , dear grandmother , I had no idea it was so late ; but it was such a lovely afternoon , and Mr. Hammond is so interested in everything connected with Wordsworth '
31263	31273	31275	31275	Mary	445	' I wonder whether he thinks me very ugly ? '
31317	31323	31331	31331	he	526	' Who thinks you ugly ? '
31324	31329	31331	31331	he	526	' Mr. Hammond . I 'm
31342	31342	31334	31334	I	0	'
31343	31360	31331	31331	he	526	' But you are not ugly . Why , Molly , what are you dreaming about ? '
31361	31406	31334	31334	I	0	' Oh , yes , I am ugly . I may not seem so to you , perhaps , because you are used to me , but I know he must think me very plain compared with Lesbia , whom he admires so much . '
31407	31421	31331	31331	he	526	' Yes , he admires Lesbia . There is no doubt of that . '
31422	31431	31433	31433	Molly	445	' And I know he thinks me plain , '
31448	31490	31331	31331	he	526	' My dearest girl , what nonsense ! Plain , forsooth ? Ugly , quotha ? Why , there are not a finer pair of eyes in Westmoreland than my Molly 's , or a prettier smile , or whiter teeth . '
31491	31499	31501	31501	Mary	445	' But all the rest is horrid , '
31507	31550	31501	31501	Mary	445	' I am sunburnt , freckled , and altogether odious like a haymaker or a market woman . Grandmother has said so often enough , and I know it is the truth . I can see it in Mr. Hammond 's manner . '
31551	31566	31568	31568	Maulevrier	524	' What ! freckles and sunburn , and the haymaker , and all that ? '
31572	31680	31568	31568	Maulevrier	524	' What an expressive manner Jack 's must be , if it can convey all that like Lord Burleigh 's nod , by Jove . Why , what a goose you are , Mary . Jack thinks you a very nice girl , and a very pretty girl , I 'll be bound ; but are n't you clever enough to understand that when a man is over head and ears in love with one woman , he is apt to seem just a little indifferent to all the other women in the world ? and there is no doubt Jack is desperately in love with Lesbia .

31698	31752	31696	31696	Mary	445	' You know it can only lead to his unhappiness . You must know what grandmother is , and how she has made up her mind that Lesbia is to marry some great person . You ought not to have brought Mr. Hammond here . It is like letting him into a trap . '
31753	31761	31763	31764	her brother	1386	' Do you think it was wrong ? '
31771	31808	31763	31764	her brother	1386	' I should be very sorry if poor Jack should come to grief . But still , if Lesbia likes him which I think she does we ought to be able to talk over the dowager . '
31809	31812	31814	31814	Mary	445	' Never , '
31816	31901	31814	31814	Mary	445	' Grandmother would never give way . You have no idea how ambitious she is . Why , once when Lesbia was in a poetical mood , and said she would marry the man she liked best in the world , if he were a pauper , her ladyship flew into a terrible passion , and told her she would renounce her , that she would curse her , if she were to marry beneath her , or marry without her grandmother 's consent . '
31902	31908	31910	31910	Maulevrier	524	' Hard lines for Hammond , '
31915	31933	31910	31910	Maulevrier	524	' Then I suppose we must give up the idea of a match between him and Lesbia . '
31934	31944	31946	31946	Mary	445	' You ought not to have brought him here , '
31948	31972	31946	31946	Mary	445	' You had better invent some plan for sending him away . If he stay it will be only to break his heart . '
31973	32010	31910	31910	Maulevrier	524	' Dear child , men 's hearts do not break so easily . I have fancied that mine was broken more than once in my life , yet it is sound enough , I assure you . '
32011	32014	32016	32016	Mary	445	' Oh ! '
32018	32035	32016	32016	Mary	445	' but you are not like him ; wounds do not go so deep with you . '
32415	32426	32400	32400	she	445	' You wo n't tell , will you , dear ? '
32427	32431	32432	32432	he	525	' Tell what ? '
32439	32480	32400	32400	she	445	' Do n't tell Mr. Hammond what I said about his thinking me ugly . He might want to apologise to me , and that would be too humiliating . I was very childish to say such a silly thing . '
32481	32486	32400	32400	she	445	' Undoubtedly you were . '
32487	32495	32400	32400	she	445	' And you wo n't tell him ? '
32496	32530	32400	32400	she	445	' Tell him anything that would degrade my Mary ? Assail her dignity by so much as a breath ? Sooner would I have this tongue torn out with red - hot pincers . '
32954	32966	32967	32967	he	526	' I had no idea you were such a tame cat , '
32970	33012	32967	32967	he	526	' if when we were salmon fishing in Canada anybody had told me you could loll about a drawing - room all day listening to a girl squalling and reading novels , I should n't have believed a word of it . '
33013	33027	33029	33029	Hammond	526	' We had plenty of roughing on the shores of the St. Lawrence , '
33031	33044	33029	33029	Hammond	526	' Summer idleness in a drawing - room is an agreeable variety . '
33233	33248	33250	33251	the dowager	1629	' You are making yourself too much a companion to Maulevrier and his friend , '
33253	33266	33250	33251	the dowager	1629	' If you do not take care you will grow like Mary . '
33267	33279	33281	33281	Lesbia	499	' I would do anything in the world to avoid that , '
33283	33305	33281	33281	Lesbia	499	' Our walks and drives have been very pleasant . Mr. Hammond is extremely clever , and can talk about everything . '
33326	33361	33313	33313	she	499	' No doubt the man is clever ; all adventurers are clever ; and you have sense enough to see that this man is an adventurer a mere sponge and toady of Maulevrier 's . '
33362	33376	33378	33379	Lady Lesbia	499	' There is nothing of the sponge or the toady in his manner , '
33394	33491	33313	33313	she	499	' My dear child , what do you know of such people or of the atmosphere in which they are generated ? The sponge and toady of to - day is not the clumsy fawning wretch you have read about in old - fashioned novels . He can flatter adroitly , and feed upon his friends , and yet maintain a show of manhood and independence . I 'll wager Mr. Hammond 's trip to Canada did not cost him sixpence , and that he hardly opened his purse all the time he was in Germany . '
33492	33515	33517	33517	Lesbia	499	' If my brother wants the company of a friend who is much poorer than himself , he must pay for it , '
33519	33534	33517	33517	Lesbia	499	' I think Maulevrier is lucky to have such a companion as Mr. Hammond . '
33740	33748	33750	33751	the dowager	1629	' Lord Hartfield has property in Argyleshire , '
33760	33770	33750	33751	the dowager	1629	' Do you know his estate , Mr. Hammond ? '
33771	33784	33786	33786	Maulevrier	524	' Hammond knows that there is such a place , I daresay , '
33793	33804	33819	33819	her	951	' But you do not know Lord Hartfield , perhaps , '
33840	33859	33819	33819	her	951	' Oh , yes ! I know him by sight every one in Argyleshire knows him by sight . '
33860	33878	33819	33819	her	951	' Naturally . A young man in his position must be widely known . Is he popular ? '
33879	33883	33819	33819	her	951	' Fairly so . '
33884	33895	33897	33898	Lady Maulevrier	524	' His father and I were friends many years ago , '
33905	33916	33897	33898	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Have you ever heard if he resembles his father ? '
33917	33933	33819	33819	her	951	' I believe not . I am told he is like his mother 's family . '
33934	33950	33897	33898	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Then he ought to be handsome . Lady Florence Ilmington was a famous beauty . '
34587	34594	34596	34597	her ladyship	951	' Is not that rather vague ? '
34599	34606	34596	34597	her ladyship	951	' Everything is vague at first . '
34607	34630	34596	34597	her ladyship	951	' But literature now as an amusement , no doubt , it is delightful but as a profession does literature ever pay ? '
34631	34638	34596	34597	her ladyship	951	' There have been such cases . '
34639	34728	34596	34597	her ladyship	951	' Yes , I suppose so . Walter Scott , Gibbon , Macaulay , Froude , those made money no doubt . But there is a suspicion of hopelessness in the idea of a young man starting in life intending to earn his bread by literature . One remembers Chatterton . I should have thought that in your case the law or the church would have been better . In the latter Maulevrier might have been useful to you . He is patron of three or four livings . '
34729	34742	34744	34744	Hammond	526	' You are too good even to think of such a thing , '
34746	34767	34744	34744	Hammond	526	' but I have set my heart upon a political career . I must swim or sink in that sea . '
34829	34853	34855	34856	her ladyship	951	' You have parents , perhaps , who are ambitious for you a mother who thinks her son a heaven - born statesman ! '
34860	34883	34855	34856	her ladyship	951	' Alas , no ! that incentive to ambition is wanting in my case . I have neither father nor mother living . '
34884	34905	34855	34856	her ladyship	951	' That is very sad . No doubt that fact has been a bond of sympathy between you and Maulevrier ? '
34906	34912	34855	34856	her ladyship	951	' I believe it has . '
34913	34925	34855	34856	her ladyship	951	' Well , I hope Providence will smile upon your path . '
34926	34944	34946	34946	Hammond	526	' Come what may , I shall never forget the happy weeks I have spent at Fellside , '
34948	34956	34946	34946	Hammond	526	' or your ladyship 's gracious hospitality . '
35010	35019	35003	35003	She	524	' You shall be welcome again at Fellside , '
35303	35416	35301	35302	The servants	1808	' rooms were all in a side wing , corresponding with those older buildings which had been given over to Steadman and his wife , and among the villagers of Grasmere enjoyed the reputation of being haunted . A wide panelled corridor extended from one end of the house to the other . It was lighted from the roof , and served as a gallery for the display of a small and choice collection of modern art , which her ladyship had acquired during her long residence at Fellside . Here , too , in Sheraton cabinets , were those treasures of old English china which Lady Maulevrier had inherited from past generations .
35662	35669	35670	35670	he	526	' I think she likes me , '
35676	35697	35670	35670	he	526	' There was a look in her eyes to - night that told me the time was come when - - '
35770	35778	35744	35745	a woman	1082	' O BITTERNESS OF THINGS TOO SWEET . '
36390	36396	36398	36398	Hammond	526	' You heard that scream ? '
36400	36419	36364	36366	an elderly man	2344	' Yes . It was her ladyship , I suppose . Nightmare . She is subject to nightmare . '
36420	36466	36364	36366	an elderly man	2344	' It is very dreadful . Her whole countenance was convulsed just now , when I went into her room to see what was wrong . I was almost afraid of a fit of some kind . Ought not her maid to go to her ? '
36467	36473	36474	36475	the man	1325	' She wants no assistance , '
36480	36528	36474	36475	the man	1325	' It was only a dream . It is not the first time I have been awakened by a shriek like that . It is a kind of nightmare , no doubt ; and it passes off in a few minutes , and leaves her sleeping calmly . '
36548	36560	36561	36561	he	1325	' Yes , she is sleeping as quietly as an infant , '
36572	36599	36569	36569	he	1325	' I am very glad ; but surely she ought to have her maid near her at night , if she is subject to those attacks . '
36600	36617	36619	36619	Steadman	478	' It is no attack , I tell you . It is nothing but a dream , '
36622	36643	36645	36645	Hammond	526	' Yet you were frightened , just as I was , or you would not have got up and dressed , '
36693	36751	36682	36682	he	526	' Yes , I came . It was my duty to come , knowing her ladyship 's habits . I am a light sleeper , and that scream woke me instantly . If her ladyship 's maid were wanted I should call her . I am a kind of watch - dog , you see , sir . '
36752	36762	36653	36653	He	526	' You seem to be a very faithful dog . '
36763	36836	36682	36682	he	526	' I have been in her ladyship 's service more than forty years . I have reason to be faithful . I know her ladyship 's habits better than any one in the house . I know that she had a great deal of trouble in her early life , and I believe the memory of it comes back upon her sometimes in her dreams , and gets the better of her . '
36837	36862	36653	36653	He	526	' If it was memory that wrung that agonised shriek from her just now , her recollections of the past must be very terrible . '
36863	36876	36878	36879	James Steadman	478	' Ah , sir , there is a skeleton in every house , '
36898	36905	36907	36907	Steadman	478	' Good - night , sir , '
36909	36935	36887	36887	Maulevrier	524	' Good - night . You are sure that Lady Maulevrier may be left safely that there is no fear of illness of any kind ? '
36936	36954	36966	36966	him	478	' No , sir . It was only a bad dream . Good - night , sir . '
37067	37077	37078	37079	John Hammond	526	' There are some minds which can not forget , '
37095	37322	37085	37085	he	526	' The story of her husband 's crime may still be fresh in her memory , though it is only a tradition for the outside world . His crime may have involved some deep wrong done to herself , some outrage against her love and faith as a wife . One of the stories Maulevrier spoke of the other day was of a wicked woman 's influence upon the governor a much more likely story than that of any traffic in British interests or British honour , which would have been almost impossible for a man in Lord Maulevrier 's position . If the scandal was of a darker kind a guilty wife the mysterious disappearance of a husband the horror of the thing may have made a deeper impression on Lady Maulevrier than even her nearest and dearest dream of : and that superb calm which she wears like a royal mantle may be maintained at the cost of struggles which tear her heart - strings . And then at night , when the will is dormant , when the nervous system is no longer ruled by the power of waking intelligence , the old familiar agony returns , the hated images flash back upon the brain , and in proportion to the fineness of the temperament is the intensity of the dreamer 's pain . '
37403	37426	37428	37428	Hammond	526	' I wonder that a woman of Lady Maulevrier 's intellect should not have better known how to treat her own malady , '
37449	37456	37458	37459	Lady Lesbia	499	' Grandmother is in capital spirits , '
37461	37512	37458	37459	Lady Lesbia	499	' She is pleased with the contents of yesterday 's Globe . Lord Denyer , the son of one of her oldest friends , has been making a great speech at Liverpool in the Conservative interest , and her ladyship thinks we shall have a change of parties before long . '
37513	37521	37523	37523	Maulevrier	461	' A general shuffle of the cards , '
37531	37533	37523	37523	Maulevrier	461	' I 'm
37540	37550	37584	37584	Lesbia	499	'm no politician , but I like a row . '
37551	37562	37564	37564	Lesbia	499	' I hope you are a Conservative , Mr. Hammond , '
37566	37583	37587	37587	his	461	' I had hoped you would have known that ever so long ago , Lady Lesbia . '
37596	37612	37613	37613	she	499	' I suppose I ought to have understood from the general tenor of your conversation , '
37616	37670	37613	37613	she	499	' but I am terribly stupid about politics . I take so little interest in them . I am always hearing that we are being badly governed that the men who legislate for us are stupid or wicked ; yet the world seems to go on somehow , and we are no worse . '
37671	37680	37682	37682	Maulevrier	461	' It is just the same with sport , '
37684	37734	37682	37682	Maulevrier	461	' Every rainy spring we are told that all the young birds have been drowned , or that the grouse - disease has decimated the fathers and mothers , and that we shall have nothing to shoot ; but when August comes the birds are there all the same . '
37735	37745	37747	37747	Hammond	526	' It is the nature of mankind to complain , '
37749	37766	37747	37747	Hammond	526	' Cain and Abel were the first farmers , and you see one of them grumbled . '
37866	37878	37880	37880	Maulevrier	461	' You need n't sit quite in my pocket , Molly , '
37886	37902	37904	37904	Mary	445	' I like to make the most of you , now you are going away , '
37906	37922	37904	37904	Mary	445	' Oh , dear , how dull we shall all be when you are gone . '
37923	37948	37966	37966	Maulevrier	461	' Not a bit of it ! You will have some fox - hunting , perhaps , before the snow is on the hills . '
37985	38005	38006	38006	he	461	' Did you ever hear of Molly 's fox - hunting , by - the - by , Hammond ? '
38024	38031	38032	38032	he	461	' Why should n't I tell ? '
38035	38277	38032	38032	he	461	' It was quite a heroic adventure . You must know our fox - hunting here is rather a peculiar institution , very good in its way , but strictly local . No horse could live among our hills , so we hunt on foot , and as the pace is good , and the work hard , nobody who starts with the hounds is likely to be in at the death , except the huntsmen . We are all mad for the sport , and off we go , over the hills and far away , picking up a fresh field as we go . The ploughman leaves his plough , and the shepherd leaves his flock , and the farmer leaves his thrashing , to follow us ; in every field we cross we get fresh blood , while those who join us at the start fall off by degrees . Well , it happened one day late in October , when there were long ridges of snow on Helvellyn , and patches of white on Fairfield , Mistress Mary here must needs take her bamboo staff and start for the Striding Edge . It was just the day upon which she might have met her death easily on that perilous point , but happily something occurred to divert her juvenile fancy , for scarcely had she got to the bottom of Dolly Waggon Pike you know Dolly - - '
38278	38281	38283	38283	Hammond	526	' Intimately , '
38289	38331	38032	38032	he	461	' Scarcely had she neared the base of Dolly Waggon when she heard the huntsman 's horn and the hounds at full cry , streaming along towards Dunmail Raise . Off flew Molly , all among the butcher boys , and farmers '
38499	38504	38506	38506	Hammond	526	' Poor Lady Mary ! '
38552	38557	38559	38559	Maulevrier	461	' Poor , indeed ! '
38561	38636	38559	38559	Maulevrier	461	' She came crawling home after dark , footsore and draggled , looking like a beggar girl , and as evil fate would have it , her ladyship , who so seldom goes out , must needs have been taking afternoon tea at the Vicarage upon that particular occasion , and was driving up the avenue as Mary crawled to the gate . The storm that followed may be more easily imagined than described . '
38637	38645	38647	38647	Mary	445	' It was years and years ago , '
38653	38665	38647	38647	Mary	445	' Grandmother need n't have made such a fuss about it . '
38666	38681	38683	38683	Maulevrier	461	' Ah , but in those days she still had hopes of civilising you , '
38685	38724	38683	38683	Maulevrier	461	' Since then she has abandoned all endeavour in that direction , and has given you over to your own devices and me . Since then you have become a chartered libertine . You have letters of mark . '
38725	38735	38737	38737	Mary	445	' I do n't care what you call me , '
38739	38762	38737	38737	Mary	445	' I only know that I am very happy when you are at home , and very miserable when you are away . '
38763	38777	38779	38781	Fršulein M ller	507	' It is hardly kind of you to say that , Lady Mary , '
38800	38819	38821	38821	Mary	445	' Oh , I do n't mean that any one is unkind to me or uses me badly , '
38823	38850	38821	38821	Mary	445	' I only mean that my life is empty when Maulevrier is away , and that I am always longing for him to come back again . '
38851	38876	38879	38879	Lesbia	499	' I thought you adored the hills , and the lake , and the villagers , and your pony , and Maulevrier 's dogs , '
38883	38894	38896	38896	Mary	445	' Yes , but one wants something human to love , '
39323	39349	39298	39299	the dowager	1629	' I do not think Lesbia 's frocks and your habits will agree , but you can have some pretty morning gowns if you like ; '
39393	39400	39402	39404	Fršulein M ller	507	' Fine feathers make fine birds , '
39406	39414	39402	39404	Fršulein M ller	507	' I should hardly have known you . '
39415	39425	39427	39427	Lesbia	499	' I wish you would always dress like that , '
39429	39438	39427	39427	Lesbia	499	' you really look like a young lady ; '
39607	39617	39618	39618	She	445	' content , while she was reading the Riot Act .
39643	39655	39656	39656	she	445	' Look what the terriers have done to me , grandmother , '
39663	39704	39656	39656	she	445	' It is all my own fault , of course . I ought not to have gone near them in that stupid muslin . Please forgive me for being so foolish . I am not fit to have pretty frocks . '
39705	39727	39729	39730	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I think , my dear , you can now have no doubt that the tailor gowns are fittest for you , '
39736	39779	39729	39730	Lady Maulevrier	524	' We have tried the experiment of dressing you like Lesbia , and you see it does not answer . Tell Kibble to throw your new gown in the rag - bag , and please let me hear no more about it . '
40165	40174	40175	40175	he	525	' This is to be my last morning , '
40182	40197	40175	40175	he	525	' Will you think me a great bore if I spend it with you ? '
40198	40208	40210	40210	Lesbia	499	' We shall think it very nice of you , '
40218	40227	40210	40210	Lesbia	499	' especially if you will read to us . '
40228	40244	40175	40175	he	525	' I will do any thing to make myself useful . What shall I read ? '
40245	40257	40210	40210	Lesbia	499	' Anything you like . What do you say to Tennyson ? '
40258	40346	40175	40175	he	525	' That he is a noble poet , a teacher of all good ; but too philosophical for my present mood . May I read you some of Heine 's ballads , those songs which you sing so exquisitely , or rather some you do not sing , and which will be fresher to you . My German is far from perfect , but I am told it is passable , and Fršulein M ller can throw her scissors at me when my accent is too dreadful . '
40347	40353	40355	40355	Fršulein	507	' You speak German beautifully , '
40357	40365	40355	40355	Fršulein	507	' I wonder where you learned it ? '
40366	40412	40175	40175	he	525	' I have been a good deal in Germany , and I had a Hanoverian valet who was quite a gentleman , and spoke admirably . I think I learned more from him than from grammars or dictionaries . I 'll go and fetch Heine . '
40413	40423	40425	40425	Fršulein	507	' What a very agreeable person Mr. Hammond is , '
40432	40439	40425	40425	Fršulein	507	' We shall quite miss him . '
40440	40452	40454	40454	Lesbia	499	' Yes , I have no doubt we shall miss him , '
40894	40947	40876	40876	her	499	' Lesbia , this is my last day at Fellside , and you and I may never have a minute alone together again while I am here . Will you come for a little walk with me on the Fell ? There is something I must say to you before I go . '
41188	41198	41199	41199	he	526	' Lesbia , you know that I love you , '
41213	41327	41199	41199	he	526	' No words I can say to - day can tell you of my love more plainly than my heart has been telling you in every hour of this happy , happy time that you and I have spent together . I love you as I never hoped to love , fervently , completely , believing that the perfection of earthly bliss will be mine if I can but win you . Dearest , is there such a sweet hope for me ; are you indeed my own , as I am yours , heart and soul , and mind and being , till the last throb of life in this poor clay ? '
41372	41385	41386	41386	she	2453	' I dare not answer as you would like me to answer , '
41394	41432	41386	41386	she	2453	' I am not my own mistress . My grandmother has brought me up , devoted herself to me almost , and she has her own views , her own plans . I dare not frustrate them ! '
41433	41656	41347	41347	She	2453	' She would like to marry you to a man of rank and fortune a man who will choose you , perhaps , because other people admire you , rather than because he himself loves you as you ought to be loved ; who will choose you because you are altogether the best and most perfect thing of your year ; just as he would buy a yearling at Newmarket or Doncaster . Her ladyship means you to make a great alliance coronets , not hearts , are the counters for her game ; but , Lesbia , would you , in the bloom and freshness of youth you with the pulses of youth throbbing at your heart lend yourself to the calculations of age which has lived its life and forgotten the very meaning of love ? Would you submit to be played as a card in the game of a dowager 's ambition ? Trust me , dearest , in the crisis of a woman 's life there is one only counsellor she should listen to , and that counsellor is her own heart . If you love me as I dare to hope you do trust in me , hold by me , and leave the rest to Heaven . I know that I can make your life happy . '
41657	41665	41667	41667	Lesbia	499	' You frighten me by your impetuosity , '
41669	41683	41667	41667	Lesbia	499	' Surely you forget how short a time we have known each other . '
41684	41715	41347	41347	She	2453	' An age . All my life before the day I saw you is a dead , dull blank as compared with the magical hours I have spent with you . '
41716	41728	41667	41667	Lesbia	499	' I do not even know who and what you are . '
41729	41815	41347	41347	She	2453	' First , I am a gentleman , or I should not be your brother 's friend . A poor gentleman , if you like , with only my own right arm to hew my pathway through the wood of life to the temple of fortune ; but trust me , only trust me , Lesbia , and I will so hew my path as to reach that temple . Look at me , love . Do I look like a man born to fail ? '
41944	41962	41963	41963	he	2456	' Have I the thews and sinews of a man doomed to be beaten in the battle ? '
41967	42001	41963	41963	he	2456	' No , dearest ; Heaven meant me to succeed ; and with you to fight for I shall not be beaten by adverse fortune . Can you not trust Providence and me ? '
42002	42016	41914	41914	Lesbia	499	' I can not disobey my grandmother . If she will consent - - '
42017	42100	41963	41963	he	2456	' She will not consent . You must defy Lady Maulevrier , Lesbia , if you mean to reward my love . But I will promise you this much , darling , that if you will be my wife with your brother 's consent which I am sure of before I ask for it , within one year of our marriage I will find means of reconciling her ladyship to the match , and winning her entire forgiveness for you and me . '
42101	42108	42110	42110	Lesbia	499	' You are talking of impossibilities , '
42114	42168	42110	42110	Lesbia	499	' Why do you talk to me as if I were a child ? I know hardly anything of the world , but I do know the woman who has reared and educated me . My grandmother would never forgive me if I married a poor man . I should be an outcast . '
42169	42197	41963	41963	he	2456	' We would be outcasts together happy outcasts . Besides , we should not always be poor . I tell you I am predestined to conquer fate . '
42198	42209	42110	42110	Lesbia	499	' But we should have to begin from the beginning . '
42210	42232	41963	41963	he	2456	' Yes , we should have to begin from the beginning , as Adam and Eve did when they left Paradise . '
42233	42277	42110	42110	Lesbia	499	' We are not told in the Bible that they had any happiness after that . It seems to have been all trouble and weariness , and toil and death , after the angel with the flaming sword drove them out of Eden . '
42278	42345	42346	42346	he	2461	' They were together , and they must have been happy . Oh , Lesbia , if you do not feel that you can face poverty and the world 's contempt by my side , and for my sake , you do not love me . Love never calculates so nicely ; love never fears the future ; and yet you do love me , Lesbia , '
42393	42402	42403	42403	she	2462	' You have no right to say that , '
42406	42514	42359	42359	she	2462	' I have the divine right of my own deep love of heart which cries out to heart . Do you think there is no magnetic power in true love which can divine the answering love in another ? Lesbia , call me an insolent coxcomb if you like , but I know you love me , and that you and I may be utterly happy together . Oh , why why do you shrink from me , my beloved ; why withhold yourself from my arms ! Oh , love , let me hold you to my heart let me seal our betrothal with a kiss ! '
42515	42526	42528	42528	Lesbia	499	' Betrothal no , no ; not for the world , '
42530	42545	42528	42528	Lesbia	499	' Lady Maulevrier would cast me off for ever ; she would curse me . '
42546	42579	42359	42359	she	2462	' What would the curse of an ambitious woman weigh against my love ? And I tell you that her anger would be only a passing tempest . She would forgive you . '
42580	42588	42528	42528	Lesbia	499	' Never you do n't know her . '
42589	42622	42359	42359	she	2462	' I tell you she would forgive you , and all would be well with us before we had been married a year . Why can not you believe me , Lesbia ? '
42623	42636	42637	42637	she	2464	' Because I can not believe impossibilities , even from your lips , '
42860	42892	42849	42849	she	499	' Oh , Lesbia , can you not be brave for my sake trustful for my sake ? God will be good to us if we are true to each other . '
42893	42946	43162	43162	Lesbia	499	' God will not be good to me if I disobey my grandmother . I owe her too much ; ingratitude in me would be doubly base . I will speak to her . I will tell her all you have said , and if she gives me the faintest encouragement - - '
42947	43117	42849	42849	she	499	' She will not ; that is a foregone conclusion . Tell her all , if you like ; but let us be prepared for the answer . When she denies the right of your heart to choose its own mate , then rise up in the might of your womanhood and defy her . Tell her , " I love him , and be he rich or poor , I will share his fate ; " tell her boldly , bravely , nobly , as a true woman should ; and if she be adamant still , proclaim your right to disobey her worldly wisdom rather than the voice of your own heart . And then come to me , darling , and be my own , and the world which you and I will face together shall not be a bad world . I will answer for that . No trouble shall come near you . No humiliation shall ever touch you . Only believe in me . '
43118	43131	43133	43133	Lesbia	499	' I can believe in you , but not in the impossible , '
43170	43177	43178	43178	she	499	' Is there any one listening ? '
43181	43186	43178	43178	she	499	' What was that ? '
43187	43260	43266	43266	Lesbia	499	' Only the breath of heaven . Oh , Lesbia , if you were but a little less wise , a little more trustful . Do not be a dumb idol . Say that you love me , or do not love me . If you can look me in the face and say the last , I will leave you without another word . I will take my sentence and go . '
43308	43319	43320	43320	she	499	' Give me time to breathe , time to think , '
43323	43352	43290	43290	She	499	' And then will you answer me plainly , truthfully , without a shadow of reserve , remembering that the fate of two lives hangs on your words . '
43353	43357	43400	43400	He	2473	' I will . '
43358	43399	43290	43290	She	499	' Let it be so , then . I 'll go for a ramble over the hills , and return in time for afternoon tea . I shall look for you on the tennis lawn at half - past four . '
43478	43488	43463	43463	he	2473	' IF I WERE TO DO AS ISEULT DID . '
43777	43784	43785	43785	she	524	' You are a late visitor , '
43788	43799	43785	43785	she	524	' why did you not come to me after breakfast ? '
43800	43827	43759	43759	her	524	' It was such a lovely morning , we went straight from the breakfast table to the garden ; I did not think you wanted me . '
43828	43864	43785	43785	she	524	' I did not want you ; but I am always glad to see my pet . What were you doing in the garden all the morning ? I did not hear you playing tennis . '
43892	43916	43759	43759	her	524	' No , it was too warm for tennis . Fršulein and I sat and worked , and Mr. Hammond read to us . '
43917	43923	43879	43879	she	524	' What did he read ? '
43924	43933	43759	43759	her	524	' Heine 's ballads . He reads German beautifully .
43934	43961	43879	43879	she	524	' Indeed ! I daresay he was at school in Germany . There are cheap schools there to which middle - class people send their boys . '
43972	43979	43980	43980	Lesbia	499	' Mr. Hammond was at Oxford , '
44014	44026	43993	43993	she	499	' Grandmother , Mr. Hammond has asked me to marry him . '
44027	44060	44062	44063	the dowager	1629	' Indeed ! Only that ? And pray , did he tell you what are his means of maintaining Lord Maulevrier 's sister in the position to which her birth entitles her ? '
44069	44104	43993	43993	she	499	' He is not rich ; indeed , I believe , he is poor ; but he is brave and clever , and he is full of confidence in his power to conquer fortune . '
44105	44255	44259	44260	her grandmother	1451	' No doubt ; that is your true adventurer 's style . He confides implicitly in his own talents , and in somebody else 's banker . Mr. Hammond would make a tremendous figure in the world , I daresay , and while he was making it your brother would have to keep him . Well , my dear Lesbia , I hope you gave this gentleman the answer his insolence deserved ; or that you did better , and referred him to me . I should be glad to give him my opinion of his conduct a person admitted to this house as your brother 's hanger - on tolerated only on your brother 's account ; such a person , nameless , penniless , friendless except for Maulevrier 's too facile patronage , to dare to lift his eyes to my granddaughter ! It is ineffable insolence ! '
44356	44404	44406	44407	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Lesbia , if I thought you had been silly enough , degraded enough , to give this young man encouragement , to have justified his audacity of to - day by any act or word of yours , I should despise , I should detest you , '
44411	44507	44406	44407	Lady Maulevrier	524	' What could be more contemptible , more hateful in a girl reared as you have been than to give encouragement to the first comer to listen greedily to the first adventurer who had the insolence to make love to you , to be eager to throw yourself into the arms of the first man who asked you . That my granddaughter , a girl reared and taught and watched and guarded by me , should have no more dignity , no more modesty , or womanly feeling , than a barmaid at an inn ! '
44513	44540	44541	44541	she	499	' I do n't see why a barmaid should not be a good woman , or why it should be a crime to fall in love , '
44551	44570	44541	44541	she	499	' You need not speak to me so unkindly . I am not going to marry Mr. Hammond . '
44571	44594	44741	44742	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Oh , you are not ? that is very good of you . I am deeply grateful for such an assurance . '
44595	44611	44541	44541	she	499	' But I like him better than anyone I ever saw in my life before . '
44612	44630	44741	44742	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You have seen so many people . You have had such a wide area for choice . '
44631	44671	44541	44541	she	499	' No ; I know I have been kept like a nun in a convent : but I do n't think when I go into the world I shall ever see anyone I should like better than Mr. Hammond . '
44672	44740	44741	44742	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Wait till you have seen the world before you make up your mind about that . And now , Lesbia , leave off talking and thinking like a child ; look me in the face and listen to me , for I am going to speak seriously ; and with me , when I am in earnest , what is said once is said for ever . '
44820	44837	44838	44838	she	524	' Lesbia , I think I have been good to you , and kind to you , '
44841	44852	44854	44854	Lesbia	499	' You have been all that is kind and dear , '
44856	45079	44838	44838	she	524	' Then give me measure for measure . My life has been a hard one , child ; hard and lonely , and loveless and joyless . My son , to whom I devoted myself in the vigour of youth and in the prime of life , never loved me , never repaid me for my love . He spent his days far away from me , when his presence would have gladdened my difficult life . He died in a strange land . Of his three children , you are the one I took into my heart . I did my duty to the others ; I lavished my love upon you . Do not give me cursing instead of blessing . Do not give me a stone instead of bread . I have built every hope of happiness or pleasure in this world upon you and your obedience . Obey me , be true to me , and I will make you a queen , and I will sit in the shadow of your throne . I will toil for you , and be wise for you . You shall have only to shine , and dazzle , and enjoy the glory of life . My beautiful darling , for pity 's sake do not give yourself over to folly . '
45080	45090	44838	44838	she	524	' Did not you marry for love , grandmother ? '
45091	45114	44838	44838	she	524	' No , Lesbia . Lord Maulevrier and I got on very well together , but ours was no love - match . '
45115	45135	44838	44838	she	524	' Does nobody in our rank ever marry for love ? are all marriages a mere exchange and barter ? '
45136	45290	44838	44838	she	524	' No , there are love - matches now and then , which often turn out badly . But , my darling , I am not asking you to marry for rank or for money . I am only asking you to wait till you find your mate among the noblest in the land . He may be the handsomest and most accomplished of men , a man born to win women 's hearts ; and you may love him as fervently as ever a village girl loved her first lover . I am not going to sacrifice you , or to barter you , dearest . I mean to marry you to the best and noblest young man of his day . You shall never be asked to stoop to the unworthy , not even if worthlessness wore strawberry leaves in his cap , and owned the greatest estate in the land . '
45291	45318	44838	44838	she	524	' And if instead of waiting for this King Arthur of yours I were to do as Iseult did as Guinevere did choose for myself - - '
45319	45338	44838	44838	she	524	' Iseult and Guinevere were wantons . I wonder that you can name them in comparison with yourself . '
45339	45366	44838	44838	she	524	' If I were to marry a good and honourable man who has his place to make in the world , would you never forgive me ? '
45367	45381	45383	45384	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You mean Mr. Hammond ? You may just as well speak plainly , '
45388	45482	45383	45384	Lady Maulevrier	524	' If you were capable of such idiocy as that , Lesbia , I would pluck you out of my heart like a foul weed . I would never look upon you , or hear your name spoken , or think of you again as long as I lived . My life would not last very long after that blow . Old age can not bear such shocks . Oh , Lesbia , I have been father and mother to you ; do not bring my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave . '
45578	45586	45587	45587	she	499	' What can I do , grandmother ? '
45594	45624	45587	45587	she	499	' He loves me , and I love him . How can I tell him that he and I can never be anything to each other in this world ? '
45625	45638	45752	45752	Lesbia	499	' Refer him to me . I will give him his answer . '
45639	45678	45587	45587	she	499	' No , no ; that will not do . I have promised to answer him myself . He has gone for a walk on the hills , and will come back at four o'clock for my answer . '
45679	45692	45752	45752	Lesbia	499	' Sit down at that table , and write as I dictate . '
45693	45702	45587	45587	she	499	' But a letter will be so formal . '
45703	45751	45752	45752	Lesbia	499	' It is the only way in which you can answer him . When he comes back from his walk you will have left Fellside . I shall send you off to St. Bees with Fršulein . You must never look upon that man 's face again . '
45783	45793	45752	45752	Lesbia	499	' THE GREATER CANTLE OF THE WORLD IS LOST . '
45909	45926	45927	45927	he	526	' How will she answer me ? Oh , my God ! how will she answer ? '
45953	46055	45927	45927	he	526	' Is my idol gold or clay ? How will she come through the crucible ? Oh , dearest , sweetest , loveliest , only be true to the instinct of your womanhood , and my cup will be full of bliss , and all my days will flow as sweetly as the burden of a song . But if you prove heartless , if you love the world 's wealth better than you love me ah ! then all is over , and you and I are lost to each other for ever . I have made up my mind . '
46267	46286	46287	46287	he	2520	' If it were Mary now whom I loved , I should have little fear of the issue , '
46304	46316	46287	46287	he	2520	' That young termagant would defy the world for her lover . '
46538	46552	46553	46553	he	2520	' Where the mischief have you been hiding yourself all day , Jack ? '
46582	46590	46553	46553	he	2520	' I have been for a walk . '
46591	46613	46553	46553	he	2520	' You might have had the civility to announce your design , and Molly and I would have shared your peregrinations . '
46614	46627	46553	46553	he	2520	' I am sorry that I lost the privilege of your company . '
46628	46642	46644	46644	Maulevrier	524	' I suppose you lost your luncheon , which was of more importance , '
46646	46653	46655	46655	Mary	445	' Will you have some tea ? '
46722	46727	46728	46728	he	525	' Thanks , yes , '
46786	46794	46795	46795	she	445	' Wo n't you have some cake , '
46814	46824	46795	46795	she	445	' I am sure you must be dreadfully hungry . '
46825	46856	46907	46908	a man	1295	' Not in the least , thanks . How came you to be entrusted with those sacred vessels , Lady Mary ? What has become of Fršulein and your sister ? '
46857	46889	46795	46795	she	445	' They have rushed off to St. Bees . Grandmother thought Lesbia looking pale and out of spirits , and packed her off to the seaside at a minute 's notice . '
46890	46898	46900	46900	Hammond	526	' What ! She has left Fellside ? '
46913	46927	46907	46908	a man	1295	' Lady Maulevrier , do I understand that Lady Lesbia has gone away ? '
46959	46971	46972	46972	she	1629	' My granddaughter has gone to the seaside with her governess , '
46977	46984	47027	47027	hers	1629	' At a minute 's notice ? '
46985	47013	47014	47014	She	1629	' At a minute 's notice . I am not in the habit of hesitating about any step which I consider necessary for my grandchildren 's welfare . '
47050	47053	47054	47054	he	526	' Well , '
47063	47097	47054	47054	he	526	' no doubt your ladyship has done wisely , and I must submit to your jurisdiction . But I had asked Lady Lesbia a question , and I had been promised an answer . '
47098	47115	47117	47118	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Your question has been answered by Lady Lesbia . She left a note for you , '
47120	47123	47125	47126	Mr. Hammond	525	' Thanks , '
47189	47270	47185	47185	Lesbia	499	' Dear Mr. Hammond , Lady Maulevrier desires me to say that the proposal which you honoured me by making this morning is one which I can not possibly accept , and that any idea of an engagement between you and me could result only in misery and humiliation to both . She thinks it best , under these circumstances , that we should not again meet , and I shall therefore have left Fellside before you receive this letter . '
47280	47284	47185	47185	Lesbia	499	' LESBIA HASELDEN . '
47285	47422	47423	47423	He	2549	' Very faithfully mine faithful to her false training , to the worldly mind that rules her ; faithful to the gods of this world Belial and Mammon , and the Moloch Fashion . Poor cowardly soul ! She loves me , and owns as much , yet weakly flies from me , afraid to trust the strong arm and the brave heart of the man who loves her , preferring the glittering shams of the world to the reality of true and honest love . Well , child , I have weighed you in the balance and found you wanting . Would to God it had been otherwise ! If you had been brave and bold for love 's sake , where is that pure and perfect chrysolite for which I would have bartered you ? '
47516	47527	47507	47507	She	2551	' Letting I dare not , wait upon I would . '
47547	47561	47562	47562	he	2549	' I have tried her , and found her not worth the winning , '
47641	47651	47652	47652	he	2549	' Another man would follow her to St. Bees , '
47655	47660	47652	47652	he	2549	' I will not . '
47968	47971	47973	47973	Maulevrier	461	' So , '
47975	48009	47973	47973	Maulevrier	461	' your ladyship has succeeded in driving my friend away . Hammond has left Fellside , and begs me to convey to you his compliments and his grateful acknowledgment of all your kindness . '
48010	48021	48023	48024	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I hope I have not been uncivil to him , '
48027	48055	48023	48024	Lady Maulevrier	524	' As you had both made up your minds to go to - morrow , it can matter very little that he should go to - day . '
48118	48126	48128	48128	Maulevrier	461	' No , perhaps it hardly matters , '
48134	48162	48128	48128	Maulevrier	461	' The man is not worth talking about or thinking about . What is he ? Only the best , truest , bravest fellow I ever knew . '
48163	48180	48182	48183	Lady Maulevrier	524	' There are shepherds and guides in Grasmere of whom we could say almost as much , '
48185	48232	48182	48183	Lady Maulevrier	524	' yet you would scarcely expect me to encourage one of them to pay his addresses to your sister ? Pray spare us all nonsense - talk , Maulevrier . This business is very well ended . You ought never to have brought Mr. Hammond here . '
48233	48250	48128	48128	Maulevrier	461	' I am sure of that now . I am very sorry I did bring him . '
48251	48297	48182	48183	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Oh , the man will not die for love . A disappointment of that kind is good for a young man in his position . It will preserve him from more vulgar entanglements , and perhaps from the folly of a too early marriage . '
48298	48311	48128	48128	Maulevrier	461	' That is a mighty philosophical way of looking at the matter . '
48312	48340	48182	48183	Lady Maulevrier	524	' It is the only true way . I hope when you are my age you will have learnt to look at everything in a philosophical spirit . '
48341	48356	48358	48360	the young man	1503	' Well , Lady Maulevrier , you have had it all your own way , '
48373	48400	48358	48360	the young man	1503	' I hope you will never be sorry for having come between two people who loved each other , and might have made each other happy . '
48401	48443	48449	48450	the butler	1806	' I shall never be sorry for having saved my granddaughter from an imprudent marriage . Give me your arm , Maulevrier , and let me hear no more about Mr. Hammond . We have all had quite enough of him , '
48457	48467	48358	48360	the young man	1503	' SINCE PAINTED OR NOT PAINTED ALL SHALL FADE . '
48511	48528	48529	48529	she	499	' It is a dull , horrid place , and I was bored to death there ! '
48541	48579	48529	48529	she	499	' There was no question of enjoyment . Grandmother took it into her head that I was looking ill , and sent me to the sea ; but I should have been just as well at Fellside . '
48734	48751	48752	48752	she	445	' I ca n't understand how you could treat that noble - minded man so badly , '
48790	48799	48769	48769	she	445	' Of whom are you speaking , pray ? '
48800	48812	48752	48752	she	445	' As if you did n't know ! Of Mr. Hammond . '
48813	48835	48769	48769	she	445	' And pray , how do you know that he is noble - minded , or that I treated him badly ? '
48836	48896	48752	48752	she	445	' Well , as to his being noble - minded , that jumps to the eyes , as French books say . As for your treatment of him , I was looking on all the time , and I know how unkind you were , and I heard him talking to you in the fir - copse that day . '
48897	48901	48903	48903	Lesbia	499	' You were listening '
48906	49011	48752	48752	she	445	' I was not listening ! I was passing by . And if people choose to carry on their love affairs out of doors they must expect to be overheard . I heard him pleading to you , telling you how he would work for you , fight the battle of life for you , asking you to be trustful and brave for his sake . But you have a heart of stone . You and grandmother both have hearts of stone . I think she must have taken out your heart when you were little , and put a stone in its place . '
49012	49015	49017	49017	Lesbia	499	' Really , '
49040	49058	49029	49029	her	499	' I think you ought to be very grateful to me and grandmother for refusing Mr. Hammond . '
49059	49063	48752	48752	she	445	' Why grateful ? '
49064	49103	49029	49029	her	499	' Because it leaves you a chance of getting him for yourself ; and everybody can see that you are over head and ears in love with him . That jumps to the eyes , as you say . '
49135	49153	49154	49154	she	445	' That is not true , and it is shameful for you to say such a thing , '
49157	49171	49154	49154	she	445	' Why , what a virago you are , Mary . Well , I 'm
49301	49312	49282	49282	her	524	'm sure I 've had quite enough unhappiness about him . '
49313	49317	49319	49319	Mary	445	' I see , '
49323	49348	49319	49319	Mary	445	' It is your own pain you think of , not his . He may suffer , so long as you are not worried . '
49349	49356	49358	49358	Lesbia	499	' You are an impertinent chit , '
49360	49368	49358	49358	Lesbia	499	' and you know nothing about it . '
50395	50400	50381	50383	the Miss Lorimers	590	' no good offer refused '
50442	50464	50427	50427	Maud	592	' Company , and had her town house and country house , and as fine a set of diamonds as a duchess .
50524	50542	50544	50545	Colonel Lorimer	587	' Directly the season is over I shall give up housekeeping and take a lodging at Bath , '
50547	50565	50544	50545	Colonel Lorimer	587	' If you do n't like Bath all the year round you can stay with your sisters . '
50566	50578	50580	50580	Georgina	586	' That is the last thing I am likely to do , '
50582	50626	50580	50580	Georgina	586	' my sisters were barely endurable when they were single and poor . They are quite intolerable now they are married and rich . I would sooner live in the monkey - house at the Zoological than stay with either Lucy or Maud . '
50627	50633	50635	50636	her father	2641	' That 's rank envy , '
50637	50652	50580	50580	Georgina	586	' You ca n't forgive them for having done so much better than you . '
50653	50673	50635	50636	her father	2641	' I ca n't forgive them for having married snobs . When I marry I shall marry a gentleman . '
50674	50677	50679	50680	the parent	2647	' When ! '
50687	50697	50679	50680	the parent	2647	' Had n't you better say " if " ? '
51324	51365	51303	51303	She	524	' I start for Scotland to - morrow , will break my journey by staying a night at Fellside , and will take Lady Lesbia on to Kirkbank with me next day , if she can be ready to go . '
51366	51372	51374	51375	Lady Maulevrier	524	' She shall be ready , '
51423	51432	51433	51433	she	499	' I shall be very glad to go , '
51436	51499	51433	51433	she	499	' this place is so dull . Of course I shall be sorry to leave you , grandmother , and I wish you would go with me ; but any change will be a relief . I think if I had to stay here all the winter , counting the days and the hours , I should go out of my mind . '
51519	51531	51533	51534	Lady Maulevrier	524	' My dearest child , I am so sorry for you , '
51536	51562	51533	51534	Lady Maulevrier	524	' But believe me the day will come when you will be very glad that you conquered the first foolish inclination of your girlish heart . '
51563	51574	51575	51575	Lesbia	499	' Yes , I daresay , when I am eighty , '
51809	51814	51816	51817	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My dearest Di , '
51819	51871	51816	51817	Lady Kirkbank	585	' what a delight to see you again after such ages ; and what a too lovely spot you have chosen for your retreat from the world , the flesh , and the devil . If I could be a recluse anywhere , it would be amongst just such delicious surroundings . '
52499	52510	52496	52496	she	524	' I am charmed to see you again , Georgie ! '
52511	52532	52496	52496	she	524	' You darling , I was sure you would be glad . But you must find me awfully changed awfully . '
52554	52591	52496	52496	she	524	' Society is so wearing , and George and I never seem to get an interval of quiet . Kirkbank is to be full of men next week . Your granddaughter will have a good time . '
52592	52603	52496	52496	she	524	' There will be a few women , of course ? '
52604	52646	52496	52496	she	524	' Oh , yes , there 's no avoiding that ; only one does n't reckon them . Sir George only counts his guns . We expect a splendid season . I shall send you some birds of my own shooting . '
52647	52651	52653	52654	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You shoot ! '
52658	52702	52496	52496	she	524	' Shoot ! I should think I do . What else is there to amuse one in Scotland , after the salmon fishing is over ? I have never missed a season for the last thirty years , unless we have been abroad . '
52703	52716	52496	52496	she	524	' Please , do n't innoculate Lesbia with your love of sport . '
52717	52760	52496	52496	she	524	' What ! you would n't like her to shoot ? Well , perhaps you are right . It is hardly the thing for a pretty girl with her fortune to make . It spoils the delicacy of the skin . But I 'm
52805	52805	52800	52800	I	0	'
52806	52827	52803	52803	you	2711	' I know she will enjoy herself with you . She has been accustomed to a very quiet life here . '
52828	52896	52800	52800	I	0	' It is a lovely spot ; but I own I can not understand how you can have lived here exclusively during all these years you who used to be all life and fire , loving change , action , political and diplomatic society , to dance upon the crest of the wave , as it were . Your whole nature must have suffered some curious change . '
52911	52924	52926	52927	Lady Maulevrier	524	' My nature did undergo a change , and a severe one , '
52931	52954	52956	52957	Lady Kirkbank	585	' It was that horrid and I daresay unfortunate scandal about his lordship ; and then the sad shock of his death , '
52961	53061	52956	52957	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Most women , with your youth and beauty , would have forgotten the scandal and the husband in a twelvemonth , and would have made a second marriage more brilliant than the first . But no Indian widow who ever performed suttee was more worthy of praise than you , or even that person of Ephesus , whose story I have heard somewhere . Indeed , I have always spoken of your life as a long suttee . But you mean to re - appear in society next season , I hope , when you present your granddaughter ? '
53062	53093	53192	53193	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I shall certainly go up to London to present her , and possibly I may spend the season in town ; but I shall feel like Rip Van Winkle . '
53094	53129	52956	52957	Lady Kirkbank	585	' No , no , you wo n't , my dear Di . You have kept yourself au courant , I know . Even my silly gossiping letters may have been of some use . '
53130	53146	53148	53149	Lady Maulevrier	524	' They have been most valuable . Let me give you another cup of tea , '
53313	53322	53323	53323	she	585	' There never was a more delicious cell ! '
53326	53473	53323	53323	she	585	' but still I should feel it a prison , if I had to spend six weeks in the year in it . I never stay more than six weeks anywhere out of London ; and I always find six weeks more than enough . The first fortnight is rapture , the third and fourth weeks are calm content , the fifth is weariness , the sixth a fever to be gone . I once tried a seventh week at Pontresina , and I hated the place so intensely that I dared not go back there for the next three years . But now tell me . Diana , have you really performed suttee , have you buried yourself alive in this sweet spot deliberately , or has the love of retirement grown upon you , and have you become a kind of lotus - eater ? '
53474	53501	53728	53729	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I believe I have become a kind of lotus - eater . My retirement here has been no sentimental sacrifice to Lord Maulevrier 's memory . '
53502	53574	53323	53323	she	585	' I am glad to hear that ; for I really think the worst possible use a woman can make of her life is in wasting it on lamentation for a dead and gone husband . Life is odiously short at the best , and it is mere imbecility to fritter away any of our scanty portion upon the dead , who can never be any the better for our tears . '
53575	53616	53728	53729	Lady Maulevrier	524	' My motive in living at Fellside was not reverence for the dead . And now let us talk of the gay world , of which you know all the secrets . Have you heard anything more about Lord Hartfield ? '
53617	53714	53323	53323	she	585	' Ah , there is a subject in which you have reason to be interested . I have not forgotten the romance of your youth that first season in which Ronald Hollister used to haunt every place at which you appeared . Do you remember that wet afternoon at the Chiswick flower - show , when you and he and I took shelter in the orange house , and you two made love to each other most audaciously in an atmosphere of orange - blossoms that almost stifled me ? Yes , those were glorious days ! '
53715	53726	53728	53729	Lady Maulevrier	524	' A short summer of gladness , a brief dream , '
53731	53740	53728	53729	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Is young Lord Hartfield like his father ? '
53741	53810	53323	53323	she	585	' No , he takes after the Ilmingtons ; but still there is a look of your old sweetheart yes , I think there is an expression . I have not seen him for nearly a year . He is still abroad , roaming about somewhere in search of adventures . These young men who belong to the Geographical and the Alpine Club are hardly ever at home . '
53811	53837	53839	53840	Lady Maulevrier	524	' But though they may be sometimes lost to society , they are all the more worthy of society 's esteem when they do appear , '
53842	53932	53839	53840	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I think there must be an ennobling influence in Alpine travel , or in the vast solitudes of the Dark Continent . A man finds himself face to face with unsophisticated nature , and with the grandest forces of the universe . Professor Tyndall writes delightfully of his Alpine experiences ; his mind seems to have ripened in the solitude and untainted air of the Alps . And I believe Lord Hartfield is a young man of very high character and of considerable cultivation , is he not ? '
53933	53975	53323	53323	she	585	' He is a splendid young fellow . I never heard a word to his disparagement , even from those people who pretend to know something bad about everybody . What a husband he would make for one of your girls ! '
53976	53998	54000	54001	the dowager	1629	' Admirable ! But those perfect arrangements , which seem predestined by heaven itself , are so rarely realised on earth , '
54020	54043	54045	54046	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Well , it would be very sweet if they were to meet next season and fall in love with each other , '
54048	54064	54045	54046	Lady Kirkbank	585	' He is enormously rich , and I daresay your girls will not be portionless . '
54065	54075	54077	54078	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Lesbia may take a modest place among heiresses , '
54080	54099	54077	54078	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I have lived so quietly during the last forty years that I could hardly help saving money . '
54100	54104	54106	54106	Georgie	597	' How nice ! '
54108	54123	54106	54106	Georgie	597	' I never saved sixpence in my life , and am always in debt . '
54124	54161	54077	54078	Lady Maulevrier	524	' The little fortune I have saved is much too small for division . Lesbia will therefore have all I can leave her . Mary has the usual provision as a daughter of the Maulevrier house . '
54162	54172	54106	54106	Georgie	597	' And I suppose Lesbia has that provision also ? '
54173	54177	54077	54078	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Of course . '
54178	54268	54106	54106	Georgie	597	' Lucky Lesbia . I only wish Hartfield were coming to us for the shooting . I would engage he should fall in love with her . Kirkbank is a splendid place for match - making . But the fact is I am not very intimate with him . He is almost always travelling , and when he is at home he is not in our set . And now , my dear Diana , tell me more about yourself , and your own life in this delicious place . '
54269	54346	54077	54078	Lady Maulevrier	524	' There is so little to tell . The books I have read , the theories of literature and art and science which I have adopted and dismissed , learnt and forgotten those are the history of my life . The ideas of the outside world reach me here only in books and newspapers ; but you who have been living in the world must have so much to say . Let me be the listener . '
54569	54578	54579	54579	she	599	' How do you do , my dear ? '
54612	54637	54579	54579	she	599	' I am going to be desperately fond of you , and I hope you will soon contrive to like me just a little . '
54638	54650	54651	54651	Lesbia	499	' I feel sure that I shall like you very much , '
54655	54668	54651	54651	Lesbia	499	' I am prepared to love you as grandmother 's old friend . '
54669	54690	54692	54693	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Oh , my dear , to think that I should ever be the old friend of anybody 's grandmother ! '
54699	54729	54692	54693	Lady Kirkbank	585	' When I was your age I used to think all old people odious . It never occurred to me that I should live to be one of them . '
54730	54741	54743	54743	Lesbia	499	' Then you had no dear grandmother whom you loved , '
54745	54757	54743	54743	Lesbia	499	' or you would have liked old people for her sake . '
54758	54806	54692	54693	Lady Kirkbank	585	' No , my love , I had no grandparents . I had a father , and he was all - sufficient anything beyond him in the ancestral line would have been a burden laid upon me greater than I could bear , as the poet says . '
54823	54833	54835	54836	Lady Kirkbank	585	' And this is Lady Mary , I suppose ? '
54845	54862	54835	54836	Lady Kirkbank	585	' How do you do , my dear ? I am going to steal your sister . '
54863	54869	54871	54871	Mary	445	' I am very glad , '
54873	54885	54871	54871	Mary	445	' I mean I am glad that Lesbia should enjoy herself . '
54886	54910	54912	54913	Lady Kirkbank	585	' And some fine day , when Lesbia is married and a great lady , I shall ask you to come to Scotland , '
54936	54949	54919	54919	she	585	' Quite an English girl . Very fresh and frank and nice , '
54966	54974	54976	54977	Lady Maulevrier	524	' What do you think of Lesbia ? '
54984	55045	55054	55055	Lady Kirkbank	585	' She is simply adorable . Your letters prepared me to expect beauty , but not such beauty . My dear , I thought the progress of the human race was all in a downward line since our time ; but your granddaughter is as handsome as you were in your first season , and that is going very far . '
55049	55053	54976	54977	Lady Maulevrier	524	' NOT YET . '
55081	55090	55076	55076	She	2488	' serious talk with her grandmother before she went .
55091	55101	55103	55104	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Lesbia , you are going into the world , '
55106	55146	55103	55104	Lady Maulevrier	524	' yes , even a country house is the world in little . You will have many admirers instead of one ; but I think , I believe , that you will be true to me and to yourself . '
55147	55179	55180	55180	Lesbia	499	' You need not fear , grandmother . I have been an idiot ; but but it was only a passing folly , and I shall never be so weak again . '
55229	55241	55243	55244	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I am delighted to hear you speak thus , dearest , '
55246	55281	55243	55244	Lady Maulevrier	524	' And if Mr. Hamilton Hammond , I mean should have the audacity to follow you to Kirkbank , and to intrude himself upon you there perhaps to persecute you with clandestine addresses - - '
55282	55293	55295	55295	Lesbia	499	' I do not believe he would do anything clandestine , '
55301	55308	55295	55295	Lesbia	499	' He is quite above that . '
55309	55367	55243	55244	Lady Maulevrier	524	' My dear child , we know absolutely nothing about him . He has his way to make in the world unaided by family or connections . He is clever daring . Such a man can not help being an adventurer ; and an adventurer is capable of anything . I warn you to beware of him . '
55368	55381	55383	55383	Lesbia	499	' I do n't suppose I shall ever see his face again , '
55445	55586	55691	55691	her	499	' I hope not . And you will beware of other adventurers , Lesbia , men of a worse stamp than Mr. Hammond , more experienced in ruse and iniquity , men steeped to the lips in worldly knowledge , men who look upon women as mere counters in the game of life . The world thinks that I am rich , and you will no doubt take rank as an heiress . You will therefore be a mark for every spendthrift , noble or otherwise , who wants to restore his broken fortunes by a wealthy marriage . And now , my dearest , good - bye . Half my heart goes with you . Nothing could induce me to part with you , even for a few weeks , except the conviction that it is for your good . '
55587	55602	55604	55604	Lesbia	499	' But we shall not be parted next year , I hope , grandmother , '
55608	55668	55604	55604	Lesbia	499	' You said something about presenting me , and then leaving me in Lady Kirkbank 's care for the season . I should not like that at all . I want you to go everywhere with me , to teach me all the mysteries of the great world . You have always promised me that it should be so . '
55669	55689	55691	55692	her grandmother	1451	' And I have always intended that it should be so . I hope that it will be so , '
55698	55716	55691	55692	her grandmother	1451	' but I am an old woman , Lesbia , and I am rooted to this place . '
55717	55801	55803	55803	Lesbia	499	' But why should you be rooted here ? What charm can keep you here , when you are so fitted to shine in society ? You are old in nothing but years , and not even old in years in comparison with women whom we hear of , going everywhere and mixing in every fashionable amusement . You are full of fire and energy , and as active as a girl . Why should you not enjoy a London season , grandmother ? '
55815	55893	55810	55811	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I should enjoy it , dearest , with you . It would be a renewal of my youth to see you shine and conquer . I should be as proud as if the glory were all my own . Yes , dear , I hope that I shall be a spectator of your triumphs . But do not let us plan the future . Life is so full of changes . Remember what Horace says - - '
55894	55900	55902	55902	Lesbia	499	' Horace is a bore , '
55904	55918	55902	55902	Lesbia	499	' I hate a poet who is always harping upon change and death . '
55950	55959	55961	55962	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You like Lady Kirkbank , I hope ? '
55991	56014	55961	55962	Lady Maulevrier	524	' She seems very kind , but I should like her better if she did not paint or if she painted better . '
56015	56020	56069	56070	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My dear child I 'm
56048	56048	56069	56070	Lady Kirkbank	585	'
56049	56061	56069	56070	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Well , I suppose I shall get hardened in time . '
56062	56067	56069	56070	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My dearest Lesbia , '
56074	56083	56069	56070	Lady Kirkbank	585	' remember we have to catch a train . '
56411	56418	56420	56420	Mary	445	' I shall miss her dreadfully , '
56440	56454	56456	56456	Mary	445	' I wonder if she will see Mr. Hammond at Lady Kirkbank 's ? '
56458	56505	56456	56456	Mary	445	' If he were anything like a lover he would find out all about her visit , and seize the opportunity of her being away from grandmother . But then if he had been much of a lover he would have followed her to St. Bees . '
56767	56778	56780	56780	Lesbia	499	' It is the most delightful house you can imagine , '
56782	56848	56780	56780	Lesbia	499	' and Lady Kirkbank is an admirable hostess . I have quite forgiven her for wearing false eyebrows ; for after all , you know , one must have eyebrows ; they are a necessity ; but why does she not have the two arches alike ? They are never a pair , and I really think that French maid of hers does it on purpose .
56849	56973	57070	57070	she	524	' By - the - bye , Lady Kirkbank is going to write to you to beseech you to let me go to Cannes and Monte Carlo with her . Sir George insists upon it . He says they both like young society , and will be horribly vexed if I refuse to go with them . And Lady Kirkbank thinks my chest is just a little weak I almost broke down the other night in that lovely little song of Jensen 's and that a winter in the south is just what I want . But , of course , dear grandmother , I wo n't ask you to let me be away so long if you think you will miss me . '
56974	56983	56985	56986	Lady Maulevrier	524	' If I think I shall miss her ! '
56988	57043	56985	56986	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Has the girl no heart , that she can ask such a question ? But can I wonder at that ? Of what account was I or my love to her father , although I sacrificed myself for his good name ? Can I expect that she should be of a different clay ? '
57189	57189	57193	57193	her	524	'
57229	57248	57250	57250	Lesbia	499	' Lady Kirkbank and I are both agreed , dearest , that you must join us at Cannes , '
57252	57343	57250	57250	Lesbia	499	' At your age it is very wrong of you to spend a winter in our horrible climate . You can travel with Steadman and your maid . Lady Kirkbank will secure you a charming suite of rooms at the hotel , or she would like it still better if you would stay at her own villa . Do consent to this plan , dear grandmother , and then we shall not be parted for a long winter . Of course Mary would be quite happy at home running wild . '
57543	57553	57554	57554	she	524	' I am at the bottom of a grave , '
57559	57668	57554	57554	she	524	' I am in a living tomb , from which there is no escape . Forty years ! Forty years of patience and hope , for what ? For dreams which may never be realised ; for descendants who may never give me the price of my labours . Yes , I should like to go to my dear one . I should like to revisit the South of France , to go on to Italy . I should feel young again amidst that eternal , unchangeable loveliness . I should forget all I have suffered . But it can not be . Not yet , not yet ! '
57680	57684	57676	57676	she	524	' Not yet ! '
57685	57736	57676	57676	she	524	' Surely at my age it must be folly to dream of the future ; and yet I feel as if there were half a century of life in me , as if I had lost nothing in either mental or bodily vigour since I came here forty years ago . '

58030	58043	58045	58046	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My dear , you have two gowns which are absolutely chien , '
58048	58072	58045	58046	Lady Kirkbank	585	' and you have a corset which gives you a figure , which you must forgive me for saying you never had before . '
58100	58110	58112	58112	Lesbia	499	' I hope my gowns will always be chien , '

58840	58891	58837	58837	she	1629	' How many times have I seen that sun go down from this spot , in winter and summer , in spring and autumn ! And now that the one being I loved and cared for is far away , I feel all the weariness and emptiness of my life . '

59636	59644	59626	59626	He	1599	' Louis Asoph , Rajah of Bisnagar . '
59645	59677	59679	59680	Lady Maulevrier	524	' If my memory does not deceive me as to the history of modern India , the territory from which you take your title has been absorbed into the English dominion ? '
59682	59759	59626	59626	He	1599	' It was trafficked away forty - three years ago , stolen , filched from my father ! but so long as I have power to think and to act I will maintain my claim to that land ; yes , if only by the empty mockery of a name on a visiting card . It is a duty I owe to myself as a man , which I owe still more to my murdered father . '
59760	59782	59783	59783	She	524	' Have you come all the way from London , and in such weather , only to tell me this story ? '
59831	59949	59626	59626	He	1599	' No , Lady Maulevrier , my mention of this story , with which you are no doubt perfectly familiar , is only a preliminary . I have come to claim my own , and to appeal to you as a woman of honour to do me justice . Nay , I will say as a woman of common honesty ; since there is no nice point of honour in question , only the plain laws of mine and thine , which I believe are the same among all nations and creeds . I come to you , Lady Maulevrier , to ask you to restore to me the wealth which your husband stole from my father . '
59950	59988	59990	59991	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You come to my house , to me , an old woman , helpless , defenceless , in the absence of my grandson , the present Earl , to insult me , and insult the dead , '
60004	60061	59990	59991	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You come to rake up old lies , and to fling them in the face of a solitary woman , old enough to be your mother . Do you think that is a noble thing to do ? Even in your barbarous Eastern code of morals and manners is that the act of a gentleman ? '
60062	60179	59626	59626	He	1599	' We are no barbarians in the East , Lady Maulevrier . I come from the cradle of civilisation , the original fount of learning . We were scholars and gentleman , priests and soldiers , two thousand years before your British ancestors ran wild in their woods , and sacrificed to their unknown gods or rocky altars reeking with human blood ! I know the errand upon which I have come is not a pleasant one , either for you or for me ; but I come to you strong in the right of a son to claim the heritage which was stolen from him by an infamous mother and her more infamous paramour - - '
60180	60188	60190	60191	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I will not hear another word ! '
60202	60231	60190	60191	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Do not dare to pronounce that name in my hearing the name of that abominable woman who brought disgrace and dishonour upon my husband and his race . '
60232	60245	60247	60248	the Indian	2874	' And who brought your husband the wealth of my murdered father , '
60252	60298	60247	60248	the Indian	2874	' Do not ignore that fact , Lady Maulevrier . What has become of that fortune two hundred thousand pounds in money and jewels . It was known to have passed into Lord Maulevrier 's possession after my father was put away by his paid instruments .
60299	60311	59626	59626	He	1599	' How dare you bring that vile charge against the dead ? '
60312	60687	60247	60248	the Indian	2874	' There are men living in India who know the truth of that charge : men who were at Bisnagar when my father , sick and heartbroken , was shut up in his deserted harem , hemmed in by spies and traitors , men with murder in their faces . There are those who know tint he was strangled by one of those wretches , that a grave was dug for him under the marble floor of his zenana , a grave in which his bones were found less than a year ago , in my presence , and fitly entombed at my bidding . He was said to have disappeared of his own free will to have left his palace under cover of night , and sought refuge from possible treachery in another province ; but there were those , and not a few , who knew the real history of his disappearance who knew , and at the time were ready to testify in any court of justice , that he had been got rid of by the Ranee 's agents , and at Lord Maulevrier 's instigation , and that his possessions in money and jewels had been conveyed in the palankins that carried the Ranee and her women to his lordship 's summer retreat near Madras . The Ranee died at that retreat six months after her husband 's murder , not without suspicion of poison , and the wealth which she carried with her when she left Bisnagar passed into his lordship 's possession . Had your husband lived , Lady Maulevrier , this story must have been brought to light . There were too many people in Madras interested in sifting the facts . There must have been a public inquiry . It was a happy thing for you and your race that Lord Maulevrier died before that inquiry had been instituted , and that many animosities died with him . Lucky too for you that I was a helpless infant at the time , and that the Mahratta adventurer to whom my father 's territory had been transferred in the shuffling of cards at the end of the war was deeply concerned in hushing up the story . '
60688	60723	59626	59626	He	1599	' And pray , why have you nursed your wrath in all these years ? Why do you intrude on me after nearly half a century , with this legend of rapine and murder ? '
60724	61085	60247	60248	the Indian	2874	' Because for nearly half a century I have been kept in profound ignorance of my father 's fate in ignorance of my race . Lord Maulevrier 's jealousy banished me from my mother 's arms shortly after my father 's death . I was sent to the South of France under the care of an ayah . My first memories are of a monastery near Marseilles , where I was reared and educated by a Jesuit community , where I was baptised and brought up in the Roman Catholic faith . By the influence of the Jesuit Fathers I was placed in a house of commerce at Marseilles . Funds to provide for my education and establishment in life , under very modest conditions , were sent periodically by an agent at Madras . It was known that I was of East Indian birth , but little more was known about me . It was only when years had gone by and I was a merchant on my own account and could afford to go to India on a voyage of discovery yes , as much a voyage of discovery as that of Vasco de Gama or of Drake that I got from the Madras agent the clue which enabled me , at the cost of infinite patience and infinite labour , to unravel the mystery of my birth . There is no need to enter now upon the details of that story . I have overwhelming documentary evidence a cloud of witnesses to convince the most sceptical as to who and what I am . The documents are some of them in my valise , at your ladyship 's service . Others are at my hotel in London , ready for the inspection of your ladyship 's lawyers . I do not think you will desire to invite a public inquiry , or force me to recover my birthright in a court of justice . I believe that you will take a broader and nobler view of the case , and that you will restore to the wronged and abandoned son the fortune stolen from his murdered father . '
61086	61142	59626	59626	He	1599	' How dare you come to me with this tissue of lies ? How dare you look me in the face and charge my dead husband with treachery and dishonour ? I believe neither in your story nor in you , and I defy you to the proof of this vile charge against the dead ! '
61143	61165	60247	60248	the Indian	2874	' In other words you mean that you will keep the money and jewels which Lord Maulevrier stole from my father ? '
61166	61268	59626	59626	He	1599	' I deny the fact that any such jewels or money ever passed into his lordship 's possession . That vile woman , your mother , whose infamy cast a dark cloud over Lord Maulevrier 's honour , may have robbed her husband , may have emptied the public treasury . But not a rupee or a jewel belonging to her ever came into my possession . I will not bear the burden of her crimes . Her existence spoiled my life banished me from India , a widow in all but the name , and more desolate than many widows . '
61269	61430	60247	60248	the Indian	2874	' Lord Maulevrier was known to leave India carrying with him two large chests supposed to contain books but actually containing treasure . A man who was in the Governor 's confidence , and who had been the go - between in his intrigues , confessed on his death - bed that he had assisted in removing the treasure . Now , Lady Maulevrier , since your husband died immediately after his arrival in England , and before he could have had any opportunity of converting or making away with the valuables so appropriated , it stands to reason that those valuables must have passed into your possession , and it is from your honour and good feeling that I claim their restitution . If you deny the claim so advanced , there remains but one course open to me , and that is to make my wrongs public , and claim my right from the law of the land . '
61431	61459	61461	61462	Lady Maulevrier	524	' And do you suppose that any English judge or English jury would believe so wild a story or countenance so vile an accusation against the defenceless ? '
61486	61553	61554	61554	She	524	' Bring forward your claim , produce your documents , your witnesses , your death - bed confessions . I defy you to injure my dead husband or me by your wild lies , your foul charges ! Go to an English lawyer , and see what an English law court will do for you and your claim . I will hear no more of either . '

A splendid constitution , a noble frame ; but I think she has overworked her brain a little , reading Huxley and Darwin , and the German physiologists upon whom Huxley and Darwin have built themselves . Metaphysics too . Schopenhauer , and the rest of them . A wonderful woman ! Very few brains could hold what hers has had poured into it in the last thirty years . The conducting nerves between the brain and the spinal marrow have been overworked : too much activity , too constant a strain . Even the rails and sleepers on the railroad wear out , do n't you know , if there 's excessive traffic . '

63528	63566	63506	63507	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Pleasant thoughts , truly ! Walled in by the hills walled in and hemmed round for ever . This place has always felt like a grave : and now I know that it is my grave . '
63784	63793	63795	63796	Mr. Horton	491	' She would talk to him of business , '
63811	63827	63799	63799	he	491	' and that can not be allowed , not for some little time at least . '
63828	63841	63843	63844	Lady Mary	445	' She is very angry with us for refusing to obey her , '
63846	63883	63799	63799	he	491	' Naturally , but it is for her own welfare she is disobeyed . She can have nothing to say to Steadman which will not keep till she is better . This establishment goes by clockwork . '
64087	64097	64111	64112	Lady Maulevrier	524	' AND THE SPRING COMES SLOWLY UP THIS WAY . '
64541	64565	64566	64567	Lady Maulevrier	524	' If I had a dog I loved , and he were to die , I would never have another in his place , '
64636	64660	64661	64661	she	524	' My dear , you want to be out in the air , riding your pony , or scampering about with your dogs , '
64666	64677	64661	64661	she	524	' It would be a cruelty to keep you indoors . '
64678	64700	64661	64661	she	524	' No , indeed , dear grandmother , I should like to stay . May I stop and read to you ? '
64701	64728	64661	64661	she	524	' No , thank you , Mary . I hate being read to . I like to devour a book . Reading aloud is such slow work .
64729	64740	64742	64742	Mary	445	' But I am afraid you must sometimes feel lonely , '
64744	64747	64749	64750	the dowager	1629	' Lonely , '
64756	64835	64749	64750	the dowager	1629	' I have been lonely for the last forty years I have been lonely all my life . Those I loved never gave me back love for love never not even your sister . See how lightly she cuts the link that bound her to me . How happy she is among strangers ! Yes , there was one who loved me truly , and fate parted us . Does fate part all true lovers , I wonder ? '
64836	64844	64846	64846	Mary	445	' You parted Lesbia and Mr. Hammond , '
64850	64860	64846	64846	Mary	445	' I am sure they loved each other truly . '
64861	64874	64876	64877	the dowager	1629	' The old and the worldly - wise are Fate , Mary , '
64886	64939	64876	64877	the dowager	1629	' I know your sister ; and I know she is not the kind of woman to be happy in an ignoble life to bear poverty and deprivation . If it had been you , now , whom Mr. Hammond had chosen , I might have taken the subject into my consideration . '
64944	64953	64954	64954	she	445	' Mr. Hammond never gave me a thought , '
64957	65012	64954	64954	she	445	' unless it was to think me contemptible . He is worlds too good for such a Tomboy . Maulevrier told him about the fox - hunt , and they both laughed at me at least I have no doubt Mr. Hammond laughed , though I was too much ashamed to look at him . '
65013	65032	65034	65035	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Poor Mary , you are beginning to find out that a young lady ought to be ladylike , '
65037	65139	65034	65035	Lady Maulevrier	524	' and now , my dear , you may go . I was only joking with you . Mr. Hammond would be no match for any granddaughter of mine . He is nobody , and has neither friends nor interest . If he had gone into the church Maulevrier could have helped him ; but I daresay his ideas are too broad for the church ; and he will have to starve at the bar , where nobody can help him . I hope you will bear this in mind , Mary , if Maulevrier should ever bring him here again . '
65140	65164	65182	65183	her ladyship	951	' He is never likely to come back again . He suffered too much ; he was treated too badly in this house . '
65165	65180	65182	65183	her ladyship	951	' Lady Mary , be good enough to remember to whom you are speaking , '
65189	65205	65182	65183	her ladyship	951	' And now please go , and tell some one to send Steadman to me . '
65657	65668	65669	65669	she	524	' I do n't want any fuss made about me , '
65672	65694	65669	65669	she	524	' I am content to trust myself to your skill , and I beg that no other doctor may be summoned . '
65763	65781	65782	65782	she	524	' It will be time enough for him to know all about me when he comes here , '
65785	65798	65782	65782	she	524	' I shall be obliged to see him whenever he does come . '
65826	65851	65852	65852	she	951	' Mr. Hammond is like the Umbra you were reading about the other day in Lord Lytton 's " Last Days of Pompeii , " '
65857	65878	65852	65852	she	951	' It must be very nice for him to go about the world with a friend who franks him everywhere . '
65879	65890	65892	65892	Mary	445	' But we do n't know that Maulevrier franks him , '
65896	65913	65892	65892	Mary	445	' We have no right to suppose that Mr. Hammond does not pay his own expenses . '
65914	65957	65852	65852	she	951	' My dear child , is it possible for a young man who has no private means to go gadding about the world on equal terms with a spendthrift like Maulevrier to pay for Moors in Scotland and apartments at the Bristol ? '
65958	65968	65970	65970	Mary	445	' But they are not staying at the Bristol , '
65972	66033	65970	65970	Mary	445	' They are staying at an old - established French hotel on the left side of the Seine . They are going about amongst the students and the workmen , dining at popular restaurants , hearing people talk . Maulevrier says it is delightfully amusing ever so much better than the beaten track of life in Anglo - American Paris . '
66034	66054	66056	66057	her ladyship	951	' I daresay they are leading a Bohemian life , and will get into trouble before they have done , '
66061	66070	66056	66057	her ladyship	951	' Maulevrier is as wild as a hawk . '
66071	66081	66083	66083	Mary	445	' He is the dearest boy in the world , '
66140	66148	66150	66150	Maulevrier	524	' Hammond is such a queer fellow , '
66152	66246	66150	66150	Maulevrier	524	' the strangest things interest him . He sits and talks to the workmen for hours ; he pokes his nose into all sorts of places hospitals , workshops , poverty - stricken dens and people are always civil to him . He is what Lesbia calls sympatico . Ah ! what a mistake Lesbia and my grandmother made when they rejected Hammond ! What a pearl above price they threw away ! But , you see , neither my lady nor Lesbia could appreciate a gem , unless it was richly set . '
66594	66607	66608	66608	he	478	' I hope I see you in better health , my lady , '
66622	66684	66972	66973	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I am better , thank you , Steadman ; better , but a poor lifeless log chained to this sofa . I sent for you because the time has come when I must talk to you upon a matter of business . You heard , I suppose , that a stranger called upon me just before I had my attack ? '
66685	66691	66617	66620	a soldier on parade	3036	' Yes , my lady . '
66692	66702	66972	66973	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Did you hear who and what he was ? '
66703	66714	66617	66620	a soldier on parade	3036	' Only that he was a foreigner , my lady . '
66715	66734	66972	66973	Lady Maulevrier	524	' He is of Indian birth . He claims to be the son of the Ranee of Bisnagar . '
66735	66754	66617	66620	a soldier on parade	3036	' He could do you no harm , my lady , if he were twenty times her son . '
66755	66804	66972	66973	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I hope not . Now , I want to ask you a question . Among those trunks and cases and packages of Lord Maulevrier 's which were sent here by heavy coach , after they were landed at Southampton , do you remember two cases of books ? '
66805	66837	66617	66620	a soldier on parade	3036	' There are two large cases among the luggage , my lady ; very heavy cases , iron clamped . I should not be surprised if they were full of books . '
66838	66845	66972	66973	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Have they never been opened ? '
66846	66852	66617	66620	a soldier on parade	3036	' Not to my knowledge . '
66853	66858	66972	66973	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Are they locked ? '
66859	66873	66617	66620	a soldier on parade	3036	' Yes , my lady . There are two padlocks on each chest . '
66874	66883	66972	66973	Lady Maulevrier	524	' And are the keys in your possession ? '
66884	66890	66617	66620	a soldier on parade	3036	' No , my lady . '
66891	66897	66972	66973	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Where are the cases ? '
66898	66912	66617	66620	a soldier on parade	3036	' In the Oak Room , with the rest of the Indian luggage . '
66913	66955	66972	66973	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Let them remain there . No doubt those cases contain the books of which I have been told . You have not heard that the person calling himself Rajah of Bisnagar has been here since my illness , have you ? '
66956	66971	66617	66620	a soldier on parade	3036	' No , my lady ; I am sure he has not been here . '
66980	67004	67005	67005	she	524	' He might have come , and my people might have kept the knowledge from me , out of consideration for my infirmity , '
67008	67029	67005	67005	she	524	' I should be very angry if it were so . I should hate to be treated like a child . '
67030	67066	66972	66973	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You shall not be so treated , my lady , while I am in this house ; but I know there is no member of the household who would presume so to treat you . '
67067	67083	67085	67086	Lady Maulevrier	524	' They might do it out of kindness ; but I should loathe such kindness , '
67090	67158	67085	67086	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Though I have been smitten down , though I lie here like a log , I have a mind to think and to plan ; and I am not afraid to meet danger , face to face . Are you telling me the truth , Steadman ? Have there been no visits concealed from me , no letters kept from me since I have been ill ? '
67159	67196	67085	67086	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I am telling you nothing but the truth , my lady . No letter has been kept from you ; no visitor has been to this house whose coming you have not been told of . '
67197	67203	67205	67206	her ladyship	951	' Then I am content , '
67560	67570	67572	67573	the butler	1806	' Mr. Steadman may be a very superior man , '
67574	67608	67572	67573	the butler	1806	' and I know that in his own estimation the Premier is n't in it compared with him ; but I never was fond of people who set themselves upon pinnacles , and I 'm
67615	67615	67572	67573	the butler	1806	'
67616	67625	67627	67628	the housekeeper	2681	' Mrs. Steadman 's plain and homely enough , '
67630	67681	67627	67628	the housekeeper	2681	' and I know she 'd like to be more sociable , and drop into my room for a cup of tea now and then ; but Steadman do so keep her under his thumb : and because he 's a misanthrope she 's obliged to sit and mope alone . '
68363	68376	68377	68377	she	2488	' You have no idea how the people dress in this place , '
68380	68792	68377	68377	she	2488	' I should have been quite out in the cold without my three new frocks from Worth . The little Princess bonnets I wear are the rage . Worth recommended me to adopt special flowers and colours ; so I have worn nothing but primroses since I have been here , and my little primrose bonnets are to be seen everywhere , sometimes on hideous old women . Lady Kirkbank hopes you will be able to go to London directly after Easter . She says I must be presented at the May drawing - room that is imperative . People have begun to talk about me ; and unless I make my dťbut while their interest is fresh I shall be a failure . There is an American beauty here , and I believe she and I are considered rivals , and young men lay wagers about us , as to which will look best at a ball , or a regatta , what colours we shall wear , and so on . It is immense fun . I only wish you were here to enjoy it . The American girl is a most insolent person , but I have had the pleasure of crushing her on several occasions in the calmest way . In the description of the concert in last week 's newspaper I was called l'Anglais de marbre . I certainly had the decency to hold my tongue while Faure was singing . Miss Bolsover 's voice was heard ever so many times above the music . According to our English ideas she has most revolting manners , and the money she spends on her clothes would make your hair stand on end . Now do , dearest grandmother , make all your arrangements for beginning the campaign directly after Easter . You must take a house in the very choicest quarter Lady Kirkbank suggests Grosvenor - place and it must be a large house , for of course you will give a ball . Lady K. says we might have Lord Porlock 's house poor Lady Porlock and her baby died a few weeks ago , and he has gone to Sweden quite broken - hearted . It is one of the new houses , exquisitely furnished , and Lady K. thinks you might have it for a song . Will you get Steadman to write to his lordship 's steward , and see what can be done ?
68793	68848	68849	68850	CHAPTER XVIII	637	' I hope the dear hand is better . You have never told me how you hurt it . It is very sweet of Mary to write me such long letters , and quite a pleasant surprise to find she can spell ; but I want to see your own dear hand once more . '
68852	68863	68377	68377	she	2488	' AND COME AGEN BE IT BY NIGHT OR DAY . '
69240	69255	69257	69257	Mary	445	' I wonder the lion and the lamb are not blown into the lake , '
69917	69920	69922	69923	the driver	3124	' Hi ! '
69925	69945	69922	69923	the driver	3124	' where are you coming , young woman ? Have you never seen a horse till to - day ? '
69994	70001	70003	70004	the driver	3124	' Why , it 's Molly ! '
70024	70032	70034	70044	the gentleman who had alighted , Maulevrier 's friend and shadow	3130	' I hope you are not hurt , '
70089	70097	70098	70098	he	525	' I am sure you are hurt , '
70102	70158	70098	70098	he	525	' the horse must have struck you , or the shaft perhaps , which was worse . Is it your shoulder that is hurt , or your chest ? Lean on me , if you feel faint or giddy . Maulevrier , you had better drive your sister home , and get her looked after . '
70159	70173	70175	70175	Mary	445	' Indeed , I am not hurt ; not the least little bit , '
70186	70204	70175	70175	Mary	445	' I was only frightened , and it was such a surprise to see you and Maulevrier . '
70360	70373	70375	70375	Mary	445	' It was very foolish of me to run into the horse , '
70388	70418	70378	70379	Mr. Hammond	525	' It was very foolish of Maulevrier to run into you . If he did n't drive at such a break - neck pace it would n't have happened . '
70430	70436	70438	70438	Maulevrier	461	' There 's rank ingratitude , '
70456	70511	70452	70452	his	461	' After my coming all the way round by Langdale to oblige you with a view of Elterwater . Molly 's all safe and sound . She would n't have minded if I 'd run over her . Come along , child , get up beside me , Hammond will take the back seat . '
70574	70585	70587	70587	Mary	445	' Dear Maulevrier , how delicious of you to come ! '
70597	70608	70587	70587	Mary	445	' I hope you are going to stay for ages . '
70609	70630	70631	70631	Mary	445	' Well , I dare say , if you make yourself very agreeable , I may stay till after Easter . '
70636	70643	70644	70644	she	445	' Easter is in three weeks , '
70649	70712	70631	70631	Mary	445	' And is n't three weeks an age , at such a place as Fellside ? I do n't know that I should have come at all on this side of the August sports , only as the grandmother was ill , I thought it a duty to come and see her . A fellow may n't care much for ancestors when they 're
70757	70757	70748	70748	I	0	'
70758	70765	70767	70767	Mary	445	' Thank you for the compliment , '
70769	70790	70792	70792	Maulevrier	461	' I brought Hammond along with me . Of course , I knew Lesbia was safe out of the way , '
70797	70812	70814	70814	Mary	445	' It is very obliging of Mr. Hammond always to go where you wish , '
70832	70843	70814	70814	Mary	445	' Has he no tastes or inclinations of his own ? '
70844	70967	70814	70814	Mary	445	' Yes , he has , plenty of them , and much loftier tastes than mine , I can tell you . But he 's kind enough to let me hang on to him , and to put up with my frivolity . There never were two men more different than he and I are ; and I suppose that 's why we get on so well together . When we were in Paris he was always up to his eyes in serious work lectures , public libraries , workmen 's syndicates , Mary Anne , the International heaven knows what , making himself master of the political situation in France ; while I was rigolant and chaloupant at the Bal Bullier . '
71367	71379	71380	71380	she	951	' I hope you have spent your winter profitably in Paris , '
71383	71401	71380	71380	she	951	' There is a great deal to be learnt there if you go into the right circles . '
71520	71533	71535	71536	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Your friend Mr. Hammond is with you , I am told , '
71543	71588	71535	71536	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Yes , I made him come ; but he is quite safe . He will bolt like a shot at the least hint of Lesbia 's return . He does n't want to meet that young lady again , I can assure you . '
71589	71643	71535	71536	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Pray do n't talk in that injured tone . Mr. Hammond is a gentlemanlike person , very well informed , very agreeable . I have never denied that . But you could not expect me to allow my granddaughter to throw herself away upon the first adventurer who made her an offer . '
71644	71651	71535	71536	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Hammond is not an adventurer . '
71652	71766	71535	71536	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Very well , I will not call him so , if the term offends you . But Mr. Hammond is Mr. Hammond , and I can not allow Lesbia to marry Mr. Hammond or Mr. Anybody , and I am very sorry you have brought him here again . There is Mary , a silly , romantic girl . I am very much afraid he has made an impression upon her . She colours absurdly when she talks of him , and flew into a passion with me the other day when I ventured to hint that he is not a Rothschild , and that his society must be expensive to you . '
71767	71870	71535	71536	Lady Maulevrier	524	' His society does not cost me anything . Hammond is the soul of independence . He worked as a blacksmith in Canada for three months , just to see what life was like in a wild district . There never was such a fellow to rough it . And as for Molly , well , now , really , if he happened to take a fancy to her , and if she happened to like him , I would n't bosh the business , if I were you , grandmother . Take my word for it , Molly might do worse . '
71871	71951	72034	72035	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Of course . She might marry a chimney sweep . There is no answering for a girl of her erratic nature . She is silly enough and romantic enough for anything ; but I shall not countenance her if she wants to throw herself away on a person without prospects or connections ; and I look to you , Maulevrier , to take care of her , now that I am a wretched log chained to this room . '
71952	71974	72034	72035	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You may rely upon me , grandmother , Molly shall come to no harm , if I can help it . '
71975	71979	71981	71982	her ladyship	951	' Thank you , '
72007	72032	72034	72035	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Tell Mrs. Power to get his lordship 's room ready immediately , and to give Mr. Hammond the room he had last summer , '
72644	72647	72630	72630	Fršulein	507	' Anstand , '
73654	73662	73664	73664	Hammond	526	' You are out early this morning , '
73671	73688	73759	73759	Steadman	478	' I am always pretty early , sir . I like a mouthful of morning air . '
73689	73734	73759	73759	Steadman	478	' So do I. By - the - bye , can you tell me anything about a queer - looking old man I passed just now a little higher up the Fell ? Such an old , old man , with long white hair . '
73735	73746	73759	73759	Steadman	478	' Yes , sir . I believe I know him . '
73747	73758	73759	73759	Steadman	478	' Who is he ? Does he live in Grasmere ? '
73763	73808	73759	73759	Steadman	478	' Well , you see , sir , your description might apply to a good many ; but if it 's the man I think you mean he lives in one of the cottages behind the church . Old Barlow , they call him . '
73809	73890	73759	73759	Steadman	478	' There ca n't be two such men he must be at least a century old . If any one told me he were a hundred and twenty I should n't be inclined to doubt the fact . I never saw such a shrivelled , wrinkled visage , bloodless , too , as if the poor old wretch never felt your fresh mountain air upon his hollow cheeks . A dreadful face . It will haunt me for a month . '
73891	73898	73900	73900	Steadman	478	' It must be old Barlow , '
73902	73908	73900	73900	Steadman	478	' Good day , sir . '
73949	73965	73967	73967	Hammond	526	' There 's a man who shows few traces of age , at any rate , '
73969	73981	73967	73967	Hammond	526	' Yet her ladyship told me that he is over seventy . '
74086	74099	74101	74101	Maulevrier	461	' I plunged awfully last year , and the year before that , '
74198	74212	74214	74214	Maulevrier	461	' You see , I did n't know what a racing stable meant , '
74218	74344	74214	74214	Maulevrier	461	' in fact , I thought it was an easy way for a nobleman to make as good a living as your City swells , with their soft goods or their Brummagem ware , a respectable trade for a gentleman to engage in . And it was only when I was half ruined that I began to understand the business ; and as soon as I did understand it I made up my mind to get out of it ; and I am happy to say that I sold the very last of my stud in February , and Tony Lumpkin is his own man again . So you may welcome the prodigal grandson , and order the fatted calf to be slain , grandmother ! '
74475	74491	74493	74494	her ladyship	951	' That is the best news I have heard for a long time , Maulevrier , '
74497	74533	74493	74494	her ladyship	951	' better medicine for my nerves than any of Mr. Horton 's preparations . If Mr. Hammond 's advice has influenced you to get rid of your stable I am deeply grateful to Mr. Hammond . '
74579	74594	74596	74596	Maulevrier	461	' Oh , you have no idea what a fellow Hammond is to lecture , '
74598	74690	74596	74596	Maulevrier	461	' He is a tremendous Radical , and he thinks that every young man in my position ought to be a reformer , and devote the greater part of his time and trouble to turning out the dirty corners of the world , upsetting those poor dear families who like to pig together in one room , ordering all the children off to school , marrying the fathers and mothers , thrusting himself between free labour and free beer , and interfering with the liberty of the subject in every direction . '
74691	74733	74735	74736	Lady Maulevrier	524	' All that may sound like Radicalism , but I think it is the true Conservatism , and that every young man ought to do as much , if he wants this timeworn old country to maintain its power and prosperity , '
74749	74756	74758	74758	Maulevrier	461	' Right you are , grandmother , '
74760	74778	74758	74758	Maulevrier	461	' and I believe Hammond calls himself a Conservative , and means to vote with the Conservatives . '
75178	75198	75200	75200	Hammond	526	' You seem to know every creature in Grasmere , down to the two - year - old babies , '
75220	75238	75202	75202	Mary	445	' Pray , do you happen to know a man called Barlow , a very old man ? '
75239	75244	75246	75246	Mary	445	' Old Sam Barlow , '
75248	75257	75246	75246	Mary	445	' why , of course I know him . '
75275	75292	75294	75294	Hammond	526	' He is an old man , a hundred , at least , I should think , '
75296	75336	75202	75202	Mary	445	' Poor old Sam , not much on the wrong side of eighty . I go to see him every week , and take him his week 's tobacco , poor old dear . It is his only comfort . '
75337	75341	75343	75343	Hammond	526	' Is it ? '
75345	75377	75343	75343	Hammond	526	' I should have doubted his having so humanising a taste as tobacco . He looks too evil a creature ever to have yielded to the softening influence of a pipe . '
75378	75427	75202	75202	Mary	445	' An evil creature ! What , old Sam ? Why he is the most genial old thing , and as cheery loves to hear the newspaper read to him the murders and railway accidents . He does n't care for politics . Everybody likes old Sam Barlow . '
75428	75457	75343	75343	Hammond	526	' I fancy the Grasmere idea of reverend and amiable age must be strictly local . I can only say that I never saw a more unholy countenance . '
75458	75469	75471	75471	Mary	445	' You must have been dreaming when you saw him , '
75473	75480	75471	75471	Mary	445	' Where did you meet him ? '
75481	75497	75343	75343	Hammond	526	' On the Fell , about a quarter of a mile from the shrubbery gate . '
75498	75535	75471	75471	Mary	445	' Did you ? I should n't have thought he could have got so far . I 've a good mind to take you to see him , this very afternoon , before we go home . '
75536	75539	75541	75541	Hammond	526	' Do , '
75543	75636	75541	75541	Hammond	526	' I should like it immensely . I thought him a hateful - looking old person ; but there was something so thoroughly uncanny about him that he exercised an absolute fascination upon me : he magnetised me , I think , as the green - eyed cat magnetises the bird . I have been positively longing to see him again . He is a kind of human monster , and I hope some one will have a big bottle made ready for him and preserve him in spirits when he dies . '
75637	75673	75674	75675	Mr. Hammond	525	' What a horrid idea ! No , sir , dear old Barlow shall lie beside the Rotha , under the trees Wordsworth planted . He is such a man as Wordsworth would have loved . '
76109	76123	76125	76125	Mary	445	' I have brought a gentleman from London to see you , Sam , '
76127	76140	76125	76125	Mary	445	' He fancied he met you on the Fell the other morning . '
76164	76321	76125	76125	Mary	445	' With my blessed rheumatics , you know it is n't in me , Lady Mary . I shall never get no further than the churchyard ; but I likes to sit on the wall hard by Wordsworth 's tomb in a warm afternoon , and to see the folks pass over the bridge ; and I can potter about looking after my flowers , I can . But it would be a dull life , now the poor old missus is gone and the bairns all out at service , if it was n't for some one dropping in to have a chat , or read me a bit of the news sometimes . And there is n't anybody in Grasmere , gentle or simple , that 's kinder to me than you , Lady Mary . Lord bless you , I do look forward to my newspaper . Any more of them dreadful smashes ? '
76322	76337	76125	76125	Mary	445	' No , Sam , thank Heaven , there have been no railway accidents . '
76338	76344	76125	76125	Mary	445	' Ah , we shall have 'em
76350	76358	76125	76125	Mary	445	' said the old man , cheerily . '
76360	76405	76125	76125	Mary	445	're bound to come then . There 's a time for all things , as Solomon says . When the season comes t'smashes all coom . And no more of these mysterious murders , I suppose , which baffle t'police and keep me awake o '
76409	76411	76125	76125	Mary	445	'em . '
76412	76425	76427	76427	Hammond	526	' Surely you do not take delight in murder , Mr. Barlow ? '
76429	76444	76125	76125	Mary	445	' No , sir , I do not wish my fellow - creatures to mak '
76446	76448	76125	76125	Mary	445	' wi '
76552	76559	76740	76740	He	3317	' Mr. de Quincey , sir ? '
76560	76572	76740	76740	He	3317	' I believe I have read every line he ever wrote . '
76573	76647	76740	76740	He	3317	' Ah , you should have heard him talk about murders . It would have made you dream queer dreams , just as he did . He lived for years in the white cottage that Wordsworth once lived in , just behind the street yonder a nice , neat , lile gentleman , in a houseful of books . I 've had many a talk with him when I was a young man . '
76648	76660	76740	76740	He	3317	' And how old may you be now , Mr. Barlow ? '
76661	76670	76740	76740	He	3317	' Getting on for eighty four , sir . '
76671	76690	76740	76740	He	3317	' But you are not the oldest man in Grasmere , I should say , by twenty years ? '
76691	76706	76740	76740	He	3317	' I do n't think there 's many much older than me , sir . '
76707	76739	76740	76740	He	3317	' The man I saw on the Fell looked at least a hundred . I wish you could tell me who he is ; I feel a morbid curiosity about him . '
76818	76822	76816	76817	LADY MAULEVRIER	524	'S LETTER - BAG .
77279	77284	77268	77277	a woman who , in the language of her friends	3350	' knew the ropes . '
77347	77368	77370	77370	Lesbia	499	' And then , dearest , I hope you will make up your mind to spend the season in London , '
77372	77483	77370	77370	Lesbia	499	' I shall expect to hear that you have secured Lord Porlock 's house . How dreadfully slow your poor dear hand is to recover ! I am afraid Horton is not treating the case cleverly . Why do you not send for Mr. Erichsen ? It is a shock to my nerves every time I receive a letter in Mary 's masculine hand , instead of in your lovely Italian penmanship . Strange is n't it ? how much better the women of your time write than the girls of the present day ! Lady Kirkbank receives letters from stylish girls in a hand that would disgrace a housemaid . '
77631	77636	77627	77627	Lesbia	499	' My dearest Child , '
77763	77837	77756	77756	Lesbia	499	' Fate has willed otherwise . The maimed hand does not recover , although Horton is very clever , and thoroughly understands my case . I am not ill , I am not in danger ; so you need feel no anxiety about me ; but I am a cripple ; and I am likely to remain a cripple for months ; so the idea of a London season this year is hopeless . '
78068	78168	78169	78170	The dowager	1629	' It is very good of you to think of travelling so long a distance to see me ; and I should love to look at your sweet face , and hear you describe your new experiences ; but I could not allow you to travel with only the protection of a maid ; and there are many reasons why I think it better to defer the meeting till the end of the season , when Lady Kirkbank will bring my treasure back to me , eager to tell me the history of all the hearts she has broken . '
78216	78221	78191	78191	Georgie	597	' My dear Georgie , '
78381	78505	78506	78507	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I must ask you to present my darling , and to deal with her exactly as if she were a daughter of your own . I think you know all my views and hopes about her ; and I feel that I can trust to your friendship in this my day of need . The dream of my life has been to launch her myself , and direct her every step in the mazes of town life ; but that dream is over . I have kept age and infirmity at a distance , have even forgotten that the years were going by ; and now I find myself an old woman all at once , and my golden dream has vanished . '
78531	78536	78537	78537	My	0	' My dearest Di , '
78692	78839	78840	78840	Lesbia	499	' As regards Lesbia , I can only say that I adore her , and I am enchanted at the idea that I am to run her myself . I intend her to be the beauty of the season not one of the loveliest debutantes , or any rot of that kind but just the girl whom everybody will be crazy about . There shall be a mob wherever she appears , Di , I promise you that . There is no one in London who can work a thing of that kind better than your humble servant . And when once the girl is the talk of the town , all the rest is easy . She can choose for herself among the very best men in society . Offers will pour in as thickly as circulars from undertakers and mourning warehouses after a death . '
78967	78997	78952	78952	she	499	' Be assured that I shall guard her as the apple of my eye , and that the detrimental who circumvents me will be a very Satan of schemers . '
79035	79135	79003	79003	your	3382	' Carson has long been forgotten , my dear soul , gone with the snows of last year . A long procession of fashionable French dressmakers has passed across the stage since her time , like the phantom kings in Macbeth ; and now the last rage is to have our gowns made by an Englishman who works for the Princess , and who gives himself most insufferable airs , or an Irishwoman who is employed by all the best actresses . It is to the latter , Kate Kearney , I shall entrust our sweet Lesbia 's toilettes . '
79172	79184	79185	79185	she	499	' Lady Kirkbank and I have been discussing my court dress , '
79188	79369	79185	79185	she	499	' and we have decided upon a white cut - velvet train , with a border of ostrich feathers , over a satin petticoat embroidered with seed pearl . It will be expensive , but we know you will not mind that . Lady Kirkbank takes the idea from the costume Buckingham wore at the Louvre the first time he met Anne of Austria . Is n't that clever of her ? She is not a deep thinker like you ; is horribly ignorant of science , metaphysics , poetry even . She asked me one day who Plato was , and whether he took his name from the battle of Platoea ; and she says she never could understand why people make a fuss about Shakespeare ; but she has read all the secret histories and memoirs that ever were written , and knows all the ins and outs of court life and high life for the last three hundred years ; and there is not a person in the peerage whose family history she has not at her fingers '
79433	79478	79425	79425	she	3387	' This passage in Lesbia 's letter affected Lady Maulevrier as if a scorpion had wriggled from underneath the sheet of paper . She folded the letter , and laid it in the satin - lined box on her table , with a deep sigh .
79479	79591	79640	79640	her	2488	' Yes , she is in the world now , and she will ask questions . I have never warned her against pronouncing her grandfather 's name . There are some who will not be so kind as Georgie Kirkbank ; some , perhaps , who will delight in humiliating her , and who will tell her the worst that can be told . My only hope is that she will make a great marriage , and speedily . Once the wife of a man with a high place in the world , worldlings will be too wise to wound her by telling her that her grandfather was an unconvicted felon . '
79968	79976	79977	79977	he	461	' Lady Mary must come with us , '
80150	80165	80167	80167	Mary	445	' We have not had any frost to speak of for the last fortnight , '
80188	80197	80199	80199	Maulevrier	461	' What a simpleton you are , Molly ! '
80201	80286	80199	80199	Maulevrier	461	' Do you suppose because there is no frost in your grandmother 's garden and if you were to ask Staples about his peaches he would tell you a very different story that there 's a tropical atmosphere on Dolly Waggon Pike ? Why , I 'd wager the ice on Grisdale Tarn is thick enough for skating . Helvellyn wo n't run away , child . You and Hammond can dance the Highland Schottische on Striding Edge in June , if you like . '
80287	80297	80299	80299	Mary	445	' Mr. Hammond wo n't be here in June , '
80301	80348	80199	80199	Maulevrier	461	' Who knows ? the train service is pretty fair between London and Windermere . Hammond and I would think nothing of putting ourselves in the mail on a Friday night , and coming down to spend Saturday and Sunday with you if you are good . '
80451	80456	80457	80457	she	445	' Dear old Maulevrier ! '
80460	80489	80490	80490	she	445	' you are always good to me . And now I shall be able to show you the Red Tarn , the highest pool of water in England , '
80497	80557	80490	80490	she	445	' And you will see Windermere winding like a silvery serpent between the hills , and Grasmere shining like a jewel in the depth of the valley , and the sea glittering like a line of white light between the edges of earth and heaven , and the dark Scotch hills like couchant lions far away to the north . '
80558	80608	80610	80610	Maulevrier	461	' That is to say these things are all supposed to be on view from the top of the mountain ; but as a peculiar and altogether exceptional state of the atmosphere is essential to their being seen , I need not tell you that they are rarely visible , '
80612	80661	80610	80610	Maulevrier	461	' You are talking to old mountaineers , Molly . Hammond has done Cotapaxi and had his little clamber on the equatorial Andes , and I well , child , I have done my Righi , and I have always found the boasted panorama enveloped in dense fog . '
80662	80672	80674	80674	Mary	445	' It wo n't be foggy to - day , '
80676	80693	80674	80674	Mary	445	' Shall we do the whole thing on foot , or shall I order the ponies ? '
80720	80730	80731	80731	he	525	' I 'll walk , and lead your pony , '
81059	81066	81067	81067	he	461	' How do you like it ? '
81079	81087	81067	81067	he	461	' I hope you are enjoying yourself . '
81088	81097	81099	81099	Hammond	526	' I never was happier in my life , '
81154	81160	81162	81162	Maulevrier	461	' Are n't you tired ? '
81164	81169	81162	81162	Maulevrier	461	' Not a whit . '
81170	81202	81465	81465	Mary	445	' Oh , I forgot you had done Cotapaxi , or as much of Cotapaxi as living mortal ever has done . That makes a difference . I am going home . '
81203	81208	81210	81210	Mary	445	' Oh , Maulevrier ! '
81214	81316	81465	81465	Mary	445	' I am going home . You two can go to the top . You are both hardened mountaineers , and I am not in it with either of you . When I rashly consented to a pedestrian ascent of Helvellyn I had forgotten what the gentleman was like ; and as to Dolly Waggon I had actually forgotten her existence . But now I see the lady as steep as the side of a house , and as stony no , naught but herself can be her parallel in stoniness . No , Molly , I will go no further . '
81317	81328	81330	81330	Mary	445	' But we shall go down on the other side , '
81332	81349	81330	81330	Mary	445	' It is a little steeper on the Cumberland side , but not nearly so far . '
81350	81464	81465	81465	Mary	445	' A little steeper ! I Can anything be steeper than Dolly Waggon ? Yes , you are right . It is steeper on the Cumberland side . I remember coming down a sheer descent , like an exaggerated sugar - loaf ; but I was on a pony , and it was the brute 's look - out . I will not go down the Cumberland side on my own legs . No , Molly , not even for you . But if you and Hammond want to go to the top , there is nothing to prevent you . He is a skilled mountaineer . I 'll trust you with him . '
81548	81559	81561	81561	Hammond	526	' Will you trust yourself with me , Lady Mary ? '
81588	81627	81561	81561	Hammond	526	' I have done a good deal of climbing in my day , and I am not afraid of anything Helvellyn can do to me . I promise to take great care of you if you will come . '
81694	81704	81705	81705	she	445	' I am afraid Fršulein would make a fuss , '
81712	81716	81722	81722	his	461	' Hang Fršulein , '
81736	81866	81722	81722	his	461	' I 'll square it with Fršulein . I 'll give her a pint of fiz with her lunch , and make her see everything in a rosy hue . The good soul is fond of her Heidseck . You will be back by afternoon tea . Why should there be any fuss about the matter ? Hammond wants to see the Red Tarn , and you are dying to show him the way . Go , and joy go with you both . Climbing a stony hill is a form of pleasure to which I have not yet risen . I shall stroll home at my leisure , and spend the afternoon on the billiard - room sofa reading Mudie 's last contribution to the comforts of home . '
81867	81872	81874	81874	Hammond	526	' What a Sybarite , '
81876	81899	81874	81874	Hammond	526	' Come , Lady Mary , we must n't loiter , if we are to be back at Fellside by five o'clock . '
81919	81926	81908	81908	he	1386	' Go , by all means ; '
82141	82148	82150	82150	Mary	445	' How fast he is going ! '
82152	82184	82186	82186	Hammond	526	' Easy is the descent of Avernus . He is going down - hill , and we are going upwards . That makes all the difference in life , you see , '
82461	82463	82484	82484	She	3458	' I 'm
82473	82483	82465	82465	you	3456	' shouted Mary , holding on her little cloth hat .
82520	82526	82528	82528	Hammond	526	' Never mind the view , '
82534	82560	82528	82528	Hammond	526	' but I really wish I had n't brought you up here . If this fog should get any worse , it may be dangerous . '
82561	82570	82572	82572	Mary	445	' The fog is sure to get worse , '
82584	82618	82572	82572	Mary	445	' but there is no danger . I know every inch of the hill , and I am not a bit afraid . I can guide you , if you will trust me . '
82619	82625	82626	82626	he	526	' My bravest of girls , '
82634	82659	82626	82626	he	526	' Trust you ! Yes , I would trust my life to you my soul my honour secure in your purity and good faith . '
82994	82997	82999	82999	Mary	445	' Look , '
83004	83018	82999	82999	Mary	445	' you must see the Red Tarn , the highest water in England ? '
83132	83141	83142	83142	he	526	' My love , my own dear love , '
83146	83422	83142	83142	he	526	' I will trust you with my life . Will you accept the trust ? I am hardly worthy ; for less than a year ago I offered myself to your sister , and I thought she was the only woman in this wide world who could make me happy . And when she refused me I was in despair , Mary ; and I left Fellside in the full belief that I had done with life and happiness . And then I came back , only to oblige Maulevrier , and determined to be utterly miserable at Fellside . I was miserable for the first two hours . Memories of dead and gone joys and disappointed hopes were very bitter . And I tried honestly to keep up my feeling of wretchedness for the first few days . But it was no use , Molly . There was a genial spirit in the place , a laughing fairy who would not let me be sad ; and I found myself becoming most unromantically happy , eating my breakfast with a hearty appetite , thinking my cup of afternoon tea nectar for love of the dear hand that gave it . And so , and so , till the new love , the purer and better love , grew and grew into a mighty tree , which was as an oak to an orchid , compared with that passion flower of earlier growth . Mary , will you trust your life to me , as I trust mine to you . I say to you almost in the words I spoke last year to Lesbia , '

'
83517	83530	83531	83531	she	3486	' I will trust you in all things , and for ever , '
83534	83567	83531	83531	she	3486	' I am not afraid to face evil fortune . I do not care how poor you are how hard our lives may be if if you are sure you love me . '
83568	83668	83704	83704	He	3487	' Sure ! There is not a beat of my heart or a thought of my mind that does not belong to you . I am yours to the very depths of my soul . My innocent love , my clear - eyed , clear - souled angel ! I have studied you and watched you and thought of you , and sounded the depths of your lovely nature , and the result is that you are for me earth 's one woman . I will have no other , Mary , no other love , no other wife . '
83669	83677	83679	83679	Mary	445	' Lady Maulevrier will be dreadfully angry , '
83681	83689	83704	83704	He	3487	' Are you afraid of her anger ? '
83690	83703	83704	83704	He	3487	' No ; I am afraid of nothing , for your sake . '
83765	83797	83973	83974	Lady Mary	445	' If we are never to find our way down the hill ; if this were to be the last hour of our lives , Mary , would you be content ? '
83798	83802	83803	83803	she	445	' Quite content , '
83808	83829	83803	83803	she	445	' I think I have lived long enough , if you really love me if you are not making fun . '
83830	83848	83973	83974	Lady Mary	445	' What , Molly , do you still doubt ? Is it strange that I love you ? '
83849	83860	83803	83803	she	445	' Very strange . I am so different from Lesbia . '
83861	83927	83973	83974	Lady Mary	445	' Yes , very different , and the difference is your highest charm . And now , love , we had better go down whichever side of the hill is easiest , for this fog is rather appalling . I forgive the wind , because it blew you against my heart just now , and that is where I want you to dwell for ever ! '
83928	83934	83936	83936	Mary	445	' Do n't be frightened , '
83938	83947	83936	83936	Mary	445	' I know every step of the way . '
84218	84228	84230	84230	Hammond	525	' You are not going to walk another step , '
84232	84246	84230	84230	Hammond	525	' While you are taking your tea I will get you a carriage . '
84247	84258	84260	84260	Mary	445	' Indeed , I had rather hurry on at once , '
84262	84269	84260	84260	Mary	445	' We are so late already . '
84270	84292	84294	84294	Hammond	525	' You will get home all the sooner if you obey me . It is your duty to obey me now , '
84516	84528	84530	84530	Hammond	525	' Mary , you are my own property now , remember , '
84592	84611	84612	84612	he	525	' You are my very own mine to guard and cherish , mine to think and work for , '
84616	84641	84612	84612	he	525	' and you will have to trust me , sweet one , even if the beginning of things is not altogether free from trouble . '
84642	84650	84612	84612	he	525	' I am not afraid of trouble . '
84651	84723	84612	84612	he	525	' Bravely spoken ! First and foremost , then , you will have to announce your engagement to Lady Maulevrier . She will take it ill , no doubt ; will do her utmost to persuade you to give me up . Have you courage and resolution , do you think , to stand against her arguments ? Can you hold to your purpose bravely , and cry , no surrender ? '
84724	84731	84733	84733	Mary	445	' There shall be no surrender , '
84735	84795	84733	84733	Mary	445	' I promise you that . No doubt grandmother will be very angry . But she has never cared for me very much . It will not hurt her for me to make a bad match , as it would have done in Lesbia 's case . She has had no day - dreams no grand ambition about me ! '
84796	84907	84612	84612	he	525	' So much the better , my wayside flower ! When you have said all that is sweet and dutiful to her , and have let her know at the same time that you mean to be my wife , come weal come woe , I will see her , and will have my say . I will not promise her a grand career for my darling : but I will pledge myself that nothing of that kind which the world calls evil no penury , or shabbiness of surroundings shall ever touch Mary Haselden after she is Mary Hammond . I can promise at least so much as that . '
84908	84915	84917	84917	Mary	445	' It is more than enough , '
84919	84933	84917	84917	Mary	445	' I have told you that I would gladly share poverty with you . '
84934	84965	84612	84612	he	525	' Sweet ! it is good of you to say as much , but I would not take you at your word . You do n't know what poverty is . '
84966	84996	84917	84917	Mary	445	' Do you think I am a coward , or self - indulgent ? You are wrong , Jack . May I call you Jack , as Maulevrier does ? '
84997	85001	84612	84612	he	525	' May you ? '
85036	85137	84917	84917	Mary	445	' You are wrong , Jack . I do know what poverty means . I have studied the ways of the poor , tried to console them , and help them a little in their troubles ; and I know there is no pain that want of money can bring which I would not share willingly with you . Do you suppose my happiness is dependent on a fine house and powdered footmen ? I should like to go to the Red River with you , and wear cotton gowns , and tuck up my sleeves and clean our cottage . '
85138	85167	85242	85242	she	445	' Very pretty sport , dear , for a summer day ; but my Mary shall have a sweeter life , and shall occasionally walk in silk attire . '
85215	85241	85242	85242	she	445	' Confess , now , in the summer , when you were in love with Lesbia , you thought me a horrid kind of girl , '
85263	85342	85242	85242	she	445	' Never , Mary . My crime is to have thought very little about you in those days . I was so dazzled by Lesbia 's beauty , so charmed by her accomplishments and girlish graces , that I forgot to take notice of anything else in the world . If I thought of you at all it was as another Maulevrier a younger Maulevrier in petticoats , very gay , and good - humoured , and nice . '
85343	85361	85242	85242	she	445	' But when you saw me rushing about with the terriers I must have seemed utterly horrid . '
85362	85495	85242	85242	she	445	' Why , dearest ? There is nothing essentially horrible in terriers , or in a bright lively girl running races with them . You made a very pretty picture in the sunlight , with your hat hanging on your shoulder , and your curly brown hair and dancing hazel eyes . If I had not been deep in love with Lesbia 's peerless complexion and Grecian features , I should have looked below the surface of that Gainsborough picture , and discovered what treasures of goodness , and courage , and truth and purity those frank brown eyes and that wide forehead betokened . I was sowing my wild oats last summer , Mary , and they brought me a crop of sorrow . But I am wiser now wiser and happier .
85496	85512	85242	85242	she	445	' But if you were to see Lesbia again would not the old love revive ? '
85513	85543	85548	85548	his	3518	' The old love is dead , Mary . There is nothing left of it but a handful of ashes , which I scatter thus to the four winds , '
85555	85614	85548	85548	his	3518	' The new love absorbs and masters my being . If Lesbia were to re - appear at Fellside this evening , I could offer her my hand in all brotherly frankness , and ask her to accept me as a brother . Here comes the coach . We shall be at Fellside just in time for dinner . '
85752	85776	85778	85778	Maulevrier	524	' I did not think you would be such idiots as to come down the north side of the hill in a tempest , '
85780	85812	85778	85778	Maulevrier	524	' we could see the clouds racing over the crest of Seat Sandal , and knew it was blowing pretty hard up there , though it was calm enough down here . '
85813	85818	85820	85820	Hammond	524	' Blowing pretty hard ; '
85822	85873	85820	85820	Hammond	524	' I do n't think I was ever out in a worse gale ; and yet I have been across the Bay of Biscay when the waves struck the side of the steamer like battering rams , and when the whole surface of the sea was white with seething foam . '
85874	85889	85891	85893	Fršulein M ller	507	' It was a most imprudent thing to go up Helvellyn in such weather , '
86024	86040	86042	86043	Mr. Hammond	525	' We did not go up the hill in bad weather , Miss M ller , '
86045	86080	86042	86043	Mr. Hammond	525	' The sun was shining and the sky was blue when we started . We could not foresee darkness and storm at the top of the hill . That was the fortune of war . '
86081	86094	86096	86096	Fršulein	507	' I am very sorry Lady Mary had not more good sense , '
86110	86131	86132	86132	he	525	' If there was any want of sense in the business , that 's my look - out , Fršulein , '
86141	86181	86132	86132	he	525	' It was I who advised Hammond and Lady Mary to climb the hill . And here they are , safe and sound after their journey . I see no reason why there should be any fuss about it . '
86182	86241	86096	86096	Fršulein	507	' People have different ways of looking at things , replied Fršulein , plodding steadily on with her dinner . Mary rose directly the dessert had been handed round , and marched out of the room : like a warrior going to a battle in which the chances of defeat were strong . Fršulein M ller shuffled after her .
86242	86261	86262	86262	she	3527	' Will you be kind enough to go to her ladyship 's room at once , Lady Mary , '
86265	86273	86262	86262	she	3527	' She wants to speak to you . '
86274	86283	86285	86285	Mary	445	' And I want to speak to her , '
86459	86462	86464	86465	her grandmother	1451	' Mary , '
86471	86495	86464	86465	her grandmother	1451	' I have been surprised and shocked by your conduct to - day . Yes , surprised at such conduct even in you . '
86496	86510	86435	86435	she	524	' I do not think I have done anything very wrong , grandmother . '
86511	86573	86575	86576	her ladyship	951	' Not wrong ! You have done nothing wrong ? You have done something absolutely outrageous . You , my granddaughter , well born , well bred , reared under my roof , to go up Helvellyn and lose yourself in a fog alone with a young man . You could hardly have done worse if you were a Cockney tourist , '
86582	86590	86592	86592	Mary	445	' I could not help the fog , '
86611	86661	86604	86604	she	445	' I had no intention of going up Helvellyn alone with Mr. Hammond . Maulevrier was to have gone with us ; but when we got to Dolly Waggon he was tired , and would not go any further . He told me to go on with Mr. Hammond . '
86662	86793	86816	86816	her	524	' He told you ! Maulevrier ! - a young man who has spent some of the best hours of his youth in the company of jockeys and trainers who has n't the faintest idea of the fitness of things . You allow Maulevrier to be your guide in a matter in which your own instinct should have guided you your womanly instinct ! But you have always been an unwomanly girl . You have put me to shame many a time by your hoydenish tricks ; but I bore with you , believing that your madcap follies were at least harmless . To - day you have gone a step too far , and have been guilty of absolute impropriety , which I shall be very slow to pardon . '
86794	86809	86811	86811	Mary	445	' Perhaps you will be still more angry when you know all , grandmother , '
86850	86865	86816	86816	her	524	' When I know all ! What more is there for me to know ? '
86866	86894	86816	86816	her	524	' Only that while we were on the top of Helvellyn , in the fog and the wind , Mr. Hammond asked me to be his wife . '
86895	86904	86906	86907	her ladyship	951	' I am not surprised to hear it , '
86914	86990	86906	86907	her ladyship	951	' A girl who could act so boldly and flirtingly was a natural mark for an adventurer . Mr. Hammond no doubt has been told that you will have a little money by - and - by , and thinks he might do worse than marry you . And seeing how you have flung yourself at his head , he naturally concludes that you will not be too proud to accept your sister 's leavings . '
86991	87003	87005	87005	Mary	445	' There is nothing gained by making cruel speeches , grandmother , '
87009	87104	87005	87005	Mary	445	' I have promised to be John Hammond 's wife , and there is nothing you nor anyone else can say which will make me alter my mind . I wish to act dutifully to you , if I can , and I hope you will be good to me and consent to this marriage . But if you will not consent , I shall marry him all the same . I shall be full of sorrow at having to disobey you , but I have promised , and I will keep my promise . '
87105	87135	87291	87292	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You will act in open rebellion against me against the kinswoman who has reared you , and educated you , and cared for you in all these years ! '
87136	87144	87146	87146	Mary	445	' But you have never loved me , '
87150	87290	87146	87146	Mary	445	' Perhaps if you had given me some portion of that affection which you lavished on my sister I might be willing to sacrifice this new deep love for your sake to lay down my broken heart as a sacrifice on the altar of gratitude . But you never loved me . You have tolerated me , endured my presence as a disagreeable necessity of your life , because I am my father 's daughter . You and Lesbia have been all the world to each other ; and I have stood aloof , outside your charmed circle , almost a stranger to you . Can you wonder , grandmother , recalling this , that I am unwilling to surrender the love that has been given me to - day the true heart of a brave and good man ! '
87313	87317	87318	87318	she	524	' Poor child ! '
87321	87475	87318	87318	she	524	' poor ignorant , inexperienced baby ! For what a Will - o - the - wisp are you ready to sacrifice my regard , and all the privileges of your position as my granddaughter ! No doubt this Mr. Hammond has said all manner of fine things to you ; but can you be weak enough to believe that he who half a year ago was sighing and dying at the feet of your sister can have one spark of genuine regard for you ? The thing is not in nature ; it is an obvious absurdity . But it is easy enough to understand that Mr. Hammond without a penny in his pocket , and with his way to make in the world , would be very glad to secure Lady Mary Haselden and her five hundred a year , and to have Lord Maulevrier for his brother in - law ? '
87476	87496	87498	87498	Mary	445	' Have I really five hundred a year ? Shall I have five hundred a year when I marry ? '
87503	87515	87318	87318	she	524	' Yes ; if you marry with your brother 's consent . '
87516	87545	87318	87318	she	524	' I am so glad for his sake . He could hardly starve if I had five hundred a year . He need not be obliged to emigrate . '
87546	87561	87318	87318	she	524	' Has he been offering you the prospect of emigration as an additional inducement ? '
87562	87601	87318	87318	she	524	' Oh , no , he does not say that he is very poor , but since you say he is penniless I thought we might be obliged to emigrate . But as I have five hundred a year '
87602	87620	87622	87623	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You will stay at home , and set up a lodging - house , I suppose , '
87625	87676	87318	87318	she	524	' I will do anything my husband pleases . We can live in a humble way in some quiet part of London , while Mr. Hammond works at literature or politics . I am not afraid of poverty or trouble , I am willing to endure both for his sake . '
87677	87683	87685	87686	her grandmother	1451	' You are a fool ! '
87689	87709	87685	87686	her grandmother	1451	' And I have nothing more to say to you . Go away , and send Maulevrier to me . '
87743	87747	87748	87748	she	445	' Dear grandmother , '
87752	87886	87748	87748	she	445	' I am very sorry to rebel against you . But this is a question of life or death with me . I am not like Lesbia . I can not barter love and truth for worldly advantage for pride of race . Do not think me so weak or so vain as to be won by a few fine speeches from an adventurer . Mr. Hammond is no adventurer , he has made no fine speeches but , I will tell you a secret , grandmother . I have liked and admired him from the first time he came here . I have looked up to him and reverenced him ; and I must be a very foolish girl if my judgment is so poor that I can respect a worthless man . '
87887	87895	87897	87898	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You are a very foolish girl , '
87908	88052	87903	87903	she	524	' but you have been very good and dutiful to me since I have been ill , and I do n't wish to forget that . I never said that Mr. Hammond was worthless ; but I say that he is no fit husband for you . If you were as yielding and obedient as Lesbia it would be all the better for you ; for then I should provide for your establishment in life in a becoming manner . But as you are wilful , and bent upon taking your own way well my dear , you must take the consequence ; and when you are a struggling wife and mother , old before your time , weighed down with the weary burden of petty cares , do not say , " My grandmother might have saved me from this martyrdom . " '
88053	88071	88127	88127	he	461	' I will run the risk , grandmother . I will be answerable for my own fate . '
88072	88086	87903	87903	she	524	' So be it , Mary . And now send Maulevrier to me . '
88109	88122	88124	88124	Maulevrier	461	' Take my cue and beat him if you can , Molly , '
88134	88136	88127	88127	he	461	' I 'm

88163	88170	88172	88172	Mary	445	' I do n't think so , '
88174	88188	88190	88190	Hammond	525	' Well , my dearest , how did you fare in the encounter ? '
88197	88270	88193	88193	Maulevrier	461	' Oh , it was dreadful ! I made the most rebellious speeches to poor grandmother , and then I remembered her affliction , and I asked her to forgive me , and just at the last she was ever so much kinder , and I think that she will let me marry you , now she knows I have made up my mind to be your wife in spite of Fate . '
88271	88277	88152	88152	I	0	' My bravest and best . '
88278	88285	88290	88290	she	3544	' And do you know , Jack '
88295	88302	88290	88290	she	3544	' I have made a discovery ! '
88303	88306	88152	88152	I	0	' Indeed ! '
88307	88405	88290	88290	she	3544	' I find that I am to have five hundred a year when I am married . It is not much . But I suppose it will help , wo n't it ? We ca n't exactly starve if we have five hundred a year . Let me see . It is more than a pound a day . A sovereign ought to go a long way in a small house ; and , of course , we shall begin in a very wee house , like De Quincey 's cottage over there , only in London . '
88406	88429	88473	88473	She	3545	' Yes , dear , there are plenty of such cottages in London . In Mayfair , for instance , or Belgravia . '
88430	88455	88290	88290	she	3544	' Now , you are laughing at my rustic ignorance . But the five hundred pounds will be a help , wo n't it ? '
88456	88465	88473	88473	She	3545	' Yes , dear , a great help . '
88466	88468	88290	88290	she	3544	' I 'm

88778	88790	88792	88792	Mary	445	' Are we not to have any tea to - night ? '
88799	88814	88816	88816	Fršulein	507	' I think you are unconscious of the progress of time , Lady Mary , '
88820	88832	88816	88816	Fršulein	507	' The tea has been brought in and taken out again . '
88833	88847	88849	88849	Hammond	524	' Then it must be brought again , if Lady Mary wants some , '
88975	88986	88988	88988	Maulevrier	524	' Well , your ladyship , what 's the row ? '
89020	89032	89034	89035	her ladyship	951	' I suppose you know what has happened to - day ? '
89037	89087	88988	88988	Maulevrier	524	' Molly and Hammond 's expedition , yes , of course . I went part of the way with them , but I was out of training , got pumped out after a couple of miles , and was n't such a fool as to go to the top . '
89088	89113	89034	89035	her ladyship	951	' Do you know that Mr. Hammond made Mary an offer , while they were on the hill , and that she accepted him ? '
89114	89144	88988	88988	Maulevrier	524	' A queer place for a proposal , was n't it ? The wind blowing great guns all the time . I should have chosen a more tranquil spot . '
89145	89177	89034	89035	her ladyship	951	' Maulevrier , can not you be serious ? Do you forget that this business of to - day must affect your sister 's welfare for the rest of her life ? '
89178	89202	89207	89207	himself	524	' No , I do not . I will be as serious as a judge after he has put on the black cap , '
89220	89277	89207	89207	himself	524	' Seriously I am very glad that Hammond has asked Mary to be his wife , and still more glad that she is tremendously in love with him . I told you some time ago not to put your spoke in that wheel . There could not be a happier or a better marriage for Mary . '
89278	89312	89034	89035	her ladyship	951	' You must have rather a poor opinion , of your sister 's attractions , personal or otherwise , if you consider a penniless young man of no family good enough for her . '
89313	89380	89207	89207	himself	524	' I do not consider my sister a piece of merchandise to be sold to the highest bidder . Granted that Hammond is poor and a nobody . He is an honourable man , highly gifted , brave as a lion , and he is my dearest friend . Can you wonder that I rejoice at my sister 's having won him for her adoring lover ? '
89381	89394	89034	89035	her ladyship	951	' Can he really care for her , after having loved Lesbia ? '
89395	89481	89207	89207	himself	524	' That was the desire of the eye , this is the love of the heart . I know that he loves Mary ever so much better than he loved Lesbia . I can assure your ladyship that I am not such a fool as I look . I am very fond of my sister Mary , and I have not been blind to her interests . I tell you on my honour that she ought to be very happy as John Hammond 's wife . '
89482	89495	89497	89498	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I am obliged to believe what you say about his character , '
89500	89551	89497	89498	Lady Maulevrier	524	' And I am willing to admit that the husband 's character has a great deal to do with the wife 's happiness , from a moral point of view ; but still there are material questions to be considered . Has your friend any means of supporting a wife ? '
89552	89572	89207	89207	himself	524	' Yes , he has means ; quite sufficient means for Mary 's views , which are very simple . '
89573	89621	89497	89498	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You mean to say he would keep her in decent poverty ? Can not you be explicit , Maulevrier , and say what means the man has , whether an income or none ? If you can not tell me I must question Mr. Hammond himself . '
89622	89629	89631	89632	her grandson	2241	' Pray do not do that , '
89635	89675	89631	89632	her grandson	2241	' Do not take all the flavour of romance out of Molly 's love story , by going into pounds , shillings , and pence . She is very young . You would hardly wish her to marry immediately ? '
89676	89688	89497	89498	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Not for the next year , at the very least . '
89689	89797	89631	89632	her grandson	2241	' Then why enter upon this sordid question of ways and means . Make Hammond and Mary happy by consenting to their engagement , and trust the rest to Providence , and to me . Take my word for it , Hammond is not a beggar , and he is a man likely to make his mark in the world . If a year hence his income is not enough to allow of his marrying , I will double Mary 's allowance out of my own purse . Hammond 's friendship has steadied me , and saved me a good deal more than five hundred a year . '
89798	89880	89497	89498	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I can quite believe that . I believe Mr. Hammond is a worthy man , and that his influence has been very good for you ; but that does not make him a good match for Mary . However , you seem to have settled the business among you , and I suppose I must submit . You had better all drink tea with me to morrow afternoon ; and I will receive your friend as Mary 's future husband . '
89881	89891	89631	89632	her grandson	2241	' That is the best and kindest of grandmothers . '
89892	89907	89497	89498	Lady Maulevrier	524	' But I should like to know more of his antecedents and his relations . '
89908	89965	89631	89632	her grandson	2241	' His antecedents are altogether creditable . He took honours at the University ; he has been liked and respected everywhere . He is an orphan , and it is better not to talk to him of his family . He is sensitive on that point , like most men who stand alone in the world . '
89966	89995	89497	89498	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Well , I will hold my peace . You have taken this business into your hands , Maulevrier ; and you must be responsible for the result . '
90086	90093	90094	90094	he	3576	' Bless you , my children , '
90104	90144	90094	90094	he	3576	' I am the dove coming back to the ark . I am the bearer of happy tidings . Lady Maulevrier consents to your acquiring the legal right to make each other miserable for the rest of your lives . '
90145	90152	90154	90154	Hammond	526	' God bless you , Maulevrier , '
90162	90208	90094	90094	he	3576	' Only as this sister of mine is hardly out of the nursery you will have to wait for her at least a year . So says the dowager , whose word is like the law of the Medes and Persians , and altereth not . '
90209	90232	90234	90234	Hammond	526	' I would wait for her twice seven years , as Jacob waited , and toil for her , as Jacob toiled , '
90236	90255	90234	90234	Hammond	526	' but I should like to call her my own to - morrow , if it were possible . '
90313	90327	90328	90328	she	524	' I can not refuse my granddaughter to her brother 's dearest friend , '
90331	90343	90328	90328	she	524	' but I think you are two most imprudent young people . '
90344	90363	90365	90365	Hammond	526	' Providence takes care of imprudent lovers , just as it does of the birds in their nests , '
90369	90393	90328	90328	she	524	' Just as much and no more , I fear . Providence does not keep off the cat or the tax - gatherer . '

90432	90436	90438	90439	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I think , '
90446	90485	90438	90439	Lady Maulevrier	524	' you are just the kind of person who ought to emigrate . You have ideas that would do for the Bush or the Yosemite Valley , but which are too primitive for an over - crowded country . '
90486	90541	90438	90439	Lady Maulevrier	524	' No , Lady Maulevrier , I am not going to steal your granddaughter . When she is my wife she shall live within call . I know she loves her native land , and I do n't think either of us would care to put an ocean between us and rugged old Helvellyn . '
90542	90569	90571	90572	her ladyship	951	' Of course having made idiots of yourselves up there in the fog and the storm you are going to worship the mountain for ever afterwards , '

91134	91166	91131	91131	she	524	' Last night I thought you a fool , but I begin to think that you are wiser than Lesbia . You have won the heart of a noble young man . '

Do n't suppose , dear , that I am not grieved at this good - bye ; but before we are a year older I hope the time will have come when there will be no more farewells for you and me . I shall be a very exacting husband , Molly . I shall want to spend all the days and hours of my life with you ; to have not a fancy or a pursuit in which you can not share , or with which you can not sympathise .

'
99418	99438	99440	99440	Steadman	478	' I have a very great objection , Lady Mary , and that objection is chiefly in your interest , '
99444	99553	99440	99440	Steadman	478	' No one who is not experienced in the ways of lunatics can imagine the danger of any association with them their consummate craftiness , their capacity for crime . Every madman is harmless up to a certain point mild , inoffensive , perhaps , up to the very moment in which he commits some appalling crime . And then people cry out upon the want of prudence , the want of common - sense which allowed such an act to be possible . No , Lady Mary , I understand the benevolence of your motive , but I can not permit you to run such a risk . '
99554	99567	99569	99569	Mary	445	' I am convinced that the poor old creature is perfectly harmless , '
99575	99607	99569	99569	Mary	445	' I shall certainly ask Lady Maulevrier to speak to you on the subject . Perhaps her influence may induce you to be a little more considerate to your unhappy relation . '
99608	99644	99646	99646	Mary	445	' Lady Mary , I beg you not to say a word to Lady Maulevrier on this subject . You will do me the greatest injury if you speak of that man . I entreat you '

I am a wretched old woman , heart sick , heart sore , worn out by pain and weariness . There are times when I am beside myself ; moments when I am not much saner than Steadman 's lunatic uncle . This is one of my worst days , and you came bouncing in upon me , and tortured my nerves by your breathless torrent of words . Pray forgive me , if I said anything rude . '
102424	102427	102429	102429	Mary	445	' If , '

102592	102655	102657	102658	her ladyship	951	' and that it would never do for me to interfere in this matter . It stands to reason that he must know his old kinsman 's temperament much better than you can , after your half - hour interviews with him in the garden . Pray how long have these garden scenes been going on , by - the - by ? '
102687	102692	102694	102694	Mary	445	' About three weeks , '
102696	102729	102694	102694	Mary	445	' But it is more than a week now since I was in the garden . It was quite by accident that I first went there . Perhaps I ought to explain . '
102839	102861	102863	102864	her ladyship	951	' I am sorry to be obliged to refuse you a favour , Mary , but I must stand by Steadman , '
102866	103085	102863	102864	her ladyship	951	' When I gave Steadman permission to shelter his aged kinsman in my house , I made it a condition that the old man should be kept in the strictest care by himself and his wife , and that nobody in this establishment should be troubled by him . This condition has been so scrupulously adhered to that the old man 's existence is known to no one in this house except you and me ; and you have discovered the fact only by accident . I must beg you to keep this secret to yourself . Steadman has particular reasons for wishing to conceal the fact of his uncle 's residence here . The old man is not actually a lunatic . If he were we should be violating the law by keeping him here . He is only imbecile from extreme old age ; the body has outlived the mind , that is all . But should any officious functionary come down upon Fellside , this imbecility might be called madness , and the poor old creature whom you regard so compassionately , and whose case you think so pitiable here , would be carried off to a pauper lunatic asylum , which I can assure you would be a much worse imprisonment than Fellside Manor . '
103086	103093	103095	103095	Mary	445	' Yes , indeed , grandmother , '
103129	103171	102863	102864	her ladyship	951	' now I understand why the poor old soul has been kept so close why nobody knows of his existence . I beg Steadman 's pardon with all my heart . He is a much better fellow than I thought him . '
103172	103186	103188	103189	her ladyship	951	' Steadman is a thoroughly good fellow , and as true as steel , '
103191	103232	103188	103189	her ladyship	951	' No one can know that so well as the mistress he has served faithfully for nearly half a century . I hope , Mary , you have not been chattering to Fršulein or any one else about your discovery . '
103233	103251	102863	102864	her ladyship	951	' No , grandmother , I have not said a word to a mortal , but - - '
103252	103281	103188	103189	her ladyship	951	' Oh , there is a " but , " is there ? I understand . You have not been so reticent in your letters to Mr. Hammond . '
103282	103358	102863	102864	her ladyship	951	' I tell him all that happens to me . There is very little to write about at Fellside ; yet I contrive to send him volumes . I often wonder what poor girls did in the days of Miss Austen 's novels , when letters cost a shilling or eighteen pence for postage , and had to be paid for by the recipient . It must have been such a terrible check upon affection . '
103359	103364	103366	103367	Lady Maulevrier	524	' And upon twaddle , '
103369	103386	103366	103367	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Well you told Mr. Hammond about Steadman 's old uncle . What did he say ? '
103387	103403	103405	103405	Mary	445	' He thoroughly approved Steadman 's conduct in forbidding me to go and see him , '
103407	103432	103434	103434	Mary	445	' I could n't help thinking it rather unkind of him ; but , of course , I feel that he must be right , '
103448	103475	103477	103478	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I always thought Mr. Hammond a sensible young man , and I am glad to find that his conduct does not belie my good opinion , '
103480	103514	103477	103478	Lady Maulevrier	524	' And now , my dear , you had better go and make yourself decent before dinner . I am very weary this afternoon , and even our little talk has exhausted me . '
103515	103543	103550	103551	her ladyship	951	' Yes , dear grandmother , I am going this instant . But let me ask one question : What is the poor old man 's name ? '
103544	103548	103550	103551	her ladyship	951	' His name ! '
103570	103641	103550	103551	her ladyship	951	' His name oh , Steadman , I suppose , like his nephew 's ; but if I ever heard the name I have forgotten it , and I do n't know whether the kinship is on the father 's or the mother 's side . Steadman asked my permission to give shelter to a helpless old relative , and I gave it . That is really all I remember . '
103642	103648	103650	103650	Mary	445	' Only one other question , '
103662	103671	103650	103650	Mary	445	' Has he been at Fellside very long ? '
103672	103709	103550	103551	her ladyship	951	' Oh , I really do n't know ; a year , or two , or three , perhaps . Life in this house is all of a piece . I hardly keep count of time . '
103710	103721	103723	103723	Mary	445	' There is one thing that puzzles me very much , '
103779	103826	104044	104044	Her	445	' I thought from the old man 's talk that he , too , must be an old servant in our family . He talked of Maulevrier Castle , and said that I reminded him of a picture by Lely , a portrait of a Lady Maulevrier .
103827	103853	103855	103856	her ladyship	951	' It is quite possible that he may have been in service there , though I do not remember to have heard anything about it , '
103860	103927	103855	103856	her ladyship	951	' The Steadmans come from that part of the country , and theirs is a hereditary service . Good - night , Mary , I am utterly weary . Look at that glorious light yonder , that mighty world of fire and flame , without which our little world would be dark and dreary . I often think of that speech of Macbeth 's , " I '

But , dear grandmother , there ought to be plenty of happiness left for you , even if your recovery is slow to come . You are so clever , you have such resources in your own mind and memory , and you have your grandchildren , who love you dearly , '
104074	104107	104109	104110	her ladyship	951	' Yes , and whose love , as exemplified by Lesbia , is shown in a hurried scrap of a letter scrawled once a week a bone thrown to a hungry dog , '

For some natures consolations and soothing suggestions are like flowers thrown upon a granite tomb . They do just as much and just as little good to the heart that lies under the stone . Good - night . '

109715	109724	109726	109727	Lady Kirkbank	585	' What do you think of her figure ? '
109729	109739	109741	109742	the dressmaker	4097	' One can not criticise what does not exist , '
109747	109765	109741	109742	the dressmaker	4097	' The young lady has no figure . She has evidently been brought up in the country . '
109802	109815	109816	109816	she	714	' Waist three inches too large , shoulders six inches too narrow , '
109841	109847	109849	109849	Lesbia	499	' What does that mean ? '
109860	109872	109874	109875	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Only that Seraphine will make your corsets the right size , '
109877	109896	109821	109821	she	714	' What ? Three inches too small for my waist , and six too wide for my shoulders ? '
109897	109907	109909	109910	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My love , you must have a figure , '
109914	109934	109909	109910	Lady Kirkbank	585	' It is not what you are , but what you ought to be that has to be considered . '
110012	110026	110027	110027	she	499	' What would my grandmother think of me if she heard I painted ? '
110039	110055	110056	110056	she	585	' My dear child , your grandmother is just half a century behind the age , '
110059	110081	110056	110056	she	585	' I hope you are not going to allow your life in London to be regulated by an oracle at Grasmere ? '
110082	110092	110094	110094	Lesbia	499	' I am not going to paint my face , '
110098	110146	110056	110056	she	585	' Well , perhaps you are right . The eyebrows are a little weak and undecided , Seraphine , as you say , and the lashes would be all the better for your famous cosmetic ; but after all there is a charm in what the painters call '
110172	110172	110166	110166	One	959	'
110232	110250	110256	110256	she	585	' One is obliged to smother one 's self in satin and velvet for balls and dinners , '
110264	110281	110256	110256	she	585	' but I know I always look my best in my cotton frock and straw hat . '
110492	110506	110508	110508	Georgie	597	' My dear , Lady Maulevrier said you were to have carte blanche , '
110512	110574	110508	110508	Georgie	597	' Your dear grandmother is as rich as Croesus , and she is generosity itself ; and how should I ever forgive myself if I allowed you to appear in society in an inadequate style . You have to take a high place , the very highest place , Lesbia ; and you must be dressed in accordance with that position . '
110841	110854	110856	110857	the jeweller	4187	' I am sure you would not like the effect without diamonds , '
110859	110962	110856	110857	the jeweller	4187	' Your amethysts are very fine , but they are dark and heavy in tone , and want a good deal of lighting - up , especially for the present fashion of half - lighted rooms . If you will allow me to use my own discretion , and mix in a few brilliants , I shall be able to produce a really artistic parure ; otherwise I would not recommend you to touch them . The present setting is clumsy and inelegant ; but I really do not know that I could improve upon it , without an admixture of brilliants . '
110963	110974	110975	110975	Lesbia	499	' Will the diamonds add very much to the expense ? '
110980	110999	111001	111002	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My dear child , you are perfectly safe in leaving the matter in Mr. Cabochon 's hands , '
111022	111074	111001	111002	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Your dear grandmother gave you the amethysts to be reset ; and of course she would wish it to be done in an artistic manner . Otherwise , as Mr. Cabochon judiciously says , why have the stones reset at all ? Better wear them in all their present hideousness . '
111095	111101	111103	111104	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Which is simply perfect , '
111680	111689	111690	111691	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Has Lesbia happened to meet Lord Hartfield ? '
112096	112099	112112	112112	he	726	' House , '
112947	112959	112960	112960	he	726	' I do n't suppose the girl knows who I am , '
113044	113055	113010	113010	she	4268	' PROUD CAN I NEVER BE OF WHAT I HATE . '
113326	113332	113320	113321	Lady Kirkbank	585	' the man meant business . '
113333	113347	113349	113349	Georgie	597	' Smithson is caught at last , and I am glad of it , '
113351	113385	113320	113321	Lady Kirkbank	585	' The creature is an abominable flirt , and has broken more hearts than any man in London . He was all but the death of one of the dearest girls I know . '
113386	113392	113394	113394	Lesbia	726	' Mr. Smithson breaks hearts ! '
113398	113424	113394	113394	Lesbia	726	' I should not have thought that was in his line . Mr. Smithson is not an Adonis , nor are his manners particularly fascinating . '
113425	113639	113320	113321	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My child how fresh you are ! Do you suppose it is the handsome men or the fascinating men for whom women break their hearts in society ? It is the rich men they all want to marry men like Smithson , who can give them diamonds , and yachts , and a hunting stud , and half a dozen fine houses . Those are the prizes the blue ribbons of the matrimonial race - course men like Smithson , who pretend to admire all the pretty women , who dangle , and dangle , and keep off other offers , and give ten guinea bouquets , and then at the end of the season are off to Hombourg or the Scotch moors , without a word . Do you think that kind of treatment is not hard enough to break a penniless girl 's heart ? She sees the golden prize within her grasp , as she believes ; she thinks that she and poverty have parted company for ever ; she imagines herself mistress of town house and country houses , yachts and stables ; and then one fine morning the gentleman is off and away ! Do not you think that is enough to break a girl 's heart ? '
113640	113665	113667	113667	Lesbia	726	' I can imagine that a girl steeped to the lips in poverty might be willing to marry Mr. Smithson 's houses and yachts , '
113684	113710	113670	113670	her	4281	' but , I think it must have been a happy release for any one to be let off the sacrifice at the last moment . '
113711	113720	113320	113321	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Poor Belle Trinder did not think so . '
113721	113727	113670	113670	her	4281	' Who was Belle Trinder ? '
113728	113823	113320	113321	Lady Kirkbank	585	' An Essex parson 's daughter whom I took under my wing five years ago a splendid girl , large and fair , and just a trifle coarse not to be spoken of in the same day with you , dearest ; but still a decidedly handsome creature . And she took remarkably well . She was a very lively girl , " never ran mute , " Sir George used to say . Sir George was very fond of her . She amused him , poor girl , with her rather brainless rattle . '
113824	113831	113670	113670	her	4281	' And Mr. Smithson admired her ? '
113832	113957	113320	113321	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Followed her about everywhere , sent her whole flower gardens in the way of bouquets and Japanese baskets , and floral parures for her gowns , and opera boxes and concert tickets . Their names were always coupled . People used to call them Bel and the Dragon . The poor child made up her mind she was to be Mrs. Smithson . She used to talk of what she would do for her own people the poor old father , buried alive in a damp parsonage , and struggling every winter with chronic bronchitis ; the four younger sisters pining in dulness and penury ; the mother who hardly knew what it was to rest from the continual worries of daily life . '
113958	113962	113964	113964	Lesbia	726	' Poor things ! '
113977	113991	113993	113994	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Belle used to talk of what she would do for them all , '
113996	114115	113993	113994	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Father should go every year to the villa at Monte Carlo ; mother and the girls should have a month in Park Lane every season , and their autumn holiday at one of Mr. Smithson 's country houses . I knew the world well enough to be sure that this kind of thing would never answer with a man like Smithson . It is only one man in a thousand the modern Arthur , the modern Quixote who will marry a whole family . I told Belle as much , but she laughed . She felt so secure of her power over the man . " He will do anything I ask him , " she said . '
114116	114126	114128	114128	Lesbia	726	' Miss Trinder must be an extraordinary young person , '
114132	114142	114128	114128	Lesbia	726	' The man had not proposed , had he ? '
114143	114477	113993	113994	Lady Kirkbank	585	' No ; the actual proposal hung fire , but Belle thought it was a settled thing all the same . Everybody talked to her as if she were engaged to Smithson , and those poor , ignorant vicarage girls used to write her long letters of congratulation , envying her good fortune , speculating about what she would do when she was married . The girl was too open and candid for London society talked too much , " gave the view before she was sure of her fox , " Sir George said . All this silly talk came to Smithson 's ears , and one morning we read in the Post that Mr. Smithson had started the day before for Algiers , where he was to stay at the house of the English Consul , and hunt lions . We waited all day , hoping for some letter of explanation , some friendly farewell which would mean a revoir . But there was nothing , and then poor Belle gave way altogether . She shut herself up in her room , and went out of one hysterical fit into another . I never heard a girl sob so terribly . She was not fit to be seen for a week , and then she went home to her father 's parsonage in the flat swampy country on the borders of Suffolk , and eat her heart , as Byron calls it . And the worst of it was that she had no actual justification for considering herself jilted . She had talked , and other people had talked , and among them they had settled the business . But Smithson had said hardly anything . He had only flirted to his heart 's content , and had spent a few hundreds upon flowers , gloves , fans , and opera tickets , which perhaps would not have been accepted by a girl with a strong sense of her own dignity . '
114478	114486	114488	114488	Lesbia	726	' I should think not , indeed , '
114490	114502	113993	113994	Lady Kirkbank	585	' But which poor Belle was only too delighted to get . '
114503	114512	114514	114514	Lesbia	726	' Miss Trinder must be very bad style , '
114520	114533	114514	114514	Lesbia	726	' and Mr. Smithson is an execrable person . Did she die ? '
114534	114546	113993	113994	Lady Kirkbank	585	' No , my dear , she is alive poor soul ! '
114547	114555	114514	114514	Lesbia	726	' You said she broke her heart . '
114556	114569	114571	114572	Lady Kirkbank	585	' " The heart may break , yet brokenly live on , " '
114574	114675	114571	114572	Lady Kirkbank	585	' The disappointed young women do n't all die . They take to district visiting , or rational dressing , or china painting , or an ambulance brigade . The lucky ones marry well - to - do widowers with large families , and so slip into a comfortable groove by the time they are five - and - thirty . Poor Belle is still single , still buried in the damp parsonage , where she paints plates and teacups , and wears out my old gowns , just as she is wearing out her own life , poor creature ! '
114676	114688	114690	114690	Lesbia	726	' The idea of any one wanting to marry Mr. Smithson , '
114692	114698	114690	114690	Lesbia	726	' It seems too dreadful . '
114699	114732	114571	114572	Lady Kirkbank	585	' A case of real destitution , you think . Wait till you have seen Smithson 's house in Park Lane his team , his yacht , his orchid houses in Berkshire . '
114950	114953	114947	114947	He	4296	' somebody . '
115576	115593	115595	115596	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Life is about six times as expensive as it was in your grandmother 's time . '
115612	115775	115595	115596	Lady Kirkbank	585	' It is the pace that kills . Society , which used to jog along comfortably , like the old Brighton stage , at ten miles an hour , now goes as fast as the Brighton express . In my mother 's time poor Lord Byron was held up to the execration of respectable people as the type of cynical profligacy ; in my own time people talked about Lord Waterford ; but , my dear , the young men now are all Byrons and Waterfords , without the genius of the one or the generosity of the other . We are all going at steeplechase rate . Social success without money is impossible . The rich Americans , the successful Jews , will crowd us out unless we keep pace with them . Ah , Lesbia , my dear girl , there would be a great future before you if you could only make up your mind to accept Mr. Smithson . '
115776	115789	115791	115791	Lesbia	499	' How do you know that he means to propose to me ? '
115795	115810	115791	115791	Lesbia	499	' Perhaps he is only going to behave as he did to Miss Trinder . '
115811	115827	115829	115830	her chaperon	2173	' Lady Lesbia Haselden is a very different person from a country parson 's daughter , '
115832	116044	116046	116047	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Smithson told me all about it afterwards . He was really taken with Belle 's fine figure and good complexion ; but one of her particular friends told him of her foolish talk about her sisters , and how well she meant to get them married when she was Mrs. Smithson . This disgusted him . He went down to Essex , reconnoitered the parsonage , saw one of the sisters hanging out cuffs and collars in the orchard another feeding the fowls both in shabby gowns and country - made boots ; one of them with red hair and freckles . The mother was bargaining for fish with a hawker at the kitchen door . And these were the people he was expected to import into Park Lane , under ceilings painted by Leighton . These were the people he was to exhibit on board his yacht , to cart about on his drag . " I had half made up my mind to marry the girl , but I would sooner have hung myself than marry her mother and sisters so I took the first train for Dover , en route for Algiers , " said Smithson , and upon my word I could hardly blame the man , '
116232	116245	116246	116246	he	726	' I have been sitting here for an hour keeping your chairs , '
116256	116278	116246	116246	he	726	' You have no idea what work I have had , and how ferociously all the women have looked at me . '
116593	116601	116603	116605	a callow lieutenant	4359	' Can you really pour out tea ? '
116616	116628	116603	116605	a callow lieutenant	4359	' I did not think you could do anything so earthly . '
116629	116638	116640	116640	Lesbia	726	' I can , and drink it too , '
116644	116653	116640	116640	Lesbia	726	' I adore tea . Cream and sugar ? '
116654	116663	116665	116666	the youth	4360	' I I beg your pardon how many ? '
117229	117244	117246	117246	Lesbia	726	' Why did n't he go on the Stock Exchange and make his fortune ? '
117250	117260	117246	117246	Lesbia	726	' instead of talking vaguely about politics and literature . '
117374	117390	117392	117393	Mr. Smithson	726	' Do you know that Lady Kirkbank has promised and vowed three things for you ? '
117395	117424	117392	117393	Mr. Smithson	726	' Indeed ! I thought I was past the age at which one can be compromised by other people 's promises . Pray what are those three things ? '
117425	117522	117363	117364	Mr. Smithson	726	' First , that you will come to breakfast in Park Lane with Lady Kirkbank next Wednesday morning . I say Wednesday because that will give me time to ask some nice people to meet you ; secondly , that you will honour me by occupying my box at the Lyceum some evening next week ; and thirdly , that you will allow me to drive you down to the Orleans for supper after the play . The drive only takes an hour , and the moonlight nights are delicious at this time of the year . '
117523	117532	117534	117534	Lesbia	726	' I am in Lady Kirkbank 's hands , '
117538	117554	117534	117534	Lesbia	726	' I am her goods , her chattels ; she takes me wherever she likes . '
117555	117572	117363	117364	Mr. Smithson	726	' But would you refuse to do me this honour if you were a free agent ? '
117573	117642	117534	117534	Lesbia	726	' I ca n't tell . I hardly know what it is to be a free agent . At Grasmere I did whatever my grandmother told me ; in London I obey Lady Kirkbank . I was transferred from one master to another . Why should we breakfast in Park Lane instead of in Arlington Street ? What is the use of crossing Piccadilly to eat our breakfast ? '
117700	117709	117710	117710	he	726	' What a dreadfully practical person you are ! '
117713	117763	117710	117710	he	726	' What is the use of crossing Piccadilly ? Well , in the first place , you will make me ineffably happy . But perhaps that does n't count . In the second place , I shall be able to show you some rather good pictures of the French school '
117764	117771	117773	117773	Lesbia	726	' I hate the French school ! '
117775	117792	117773	117773	Lesbia	726	' Tricky , flashy , chalky , shallow , smelling of the footlights and the studio . '
117793	117821	117710	117710	he	726	' Well , sink the pictures . You will meet some very charming people , belonging to that artist world which is not to be met everywhere . '
117822	117842	117844	117844	Lesbia	726	' I will go to Park Lane to meet your people , if Lady Kirkbank likes to take me , '
117858	117884	117886	117887	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My pet , if you had made it the study of your life how to treat that man you could not do it better , '
117918	117935	117886	117887	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Upon my word , Lesbia , I begin to think you must be a genius . '
117936	117948	117950	117950	Lesbia	726	' Did you see any gowns you liked better than mine ? '
117965	117973	117886	117887	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Not one Seraphine has surpassed herself . '
117974	118048	117886	117887	Lady Kirkbank	585	' You are always saying that . One would suppose you were a sleeping partner in the firm . But I really think this brown and buttercups is rather nice . I saw that odious American girl just now Miss Miss Milwaukee , that mop - stick girl people raved about at Cannes . She was in pale blue and cream colour , a milk and water mixture , and looked positively plain . '
118238	118243	118245	118245	Smithson	726	' Dresden china incarnate ! '
118271	118301	118250	118251	Lady Lesbia	499	' Why do you make yourself so lovely ? I shall want to keep you in one of my Louis Seize cabinets , with the rest of my Dresden ! '
120107	120114	120115	120115	he	746	' It is the same line , '
120118	120195	120115	120115	he	746	' the line of lilies and flowing waters the gracious ineffable upward returning ripple of the true retroussť nose , the divine flou , the loveliness which has lain dormant for centuries nay , was at one period of debased art scorned and trampled under foot by the porcine multitude , as akin to the pug and the turn - up , until discovered and enshrined on the altar of the Beautiful by the Boticelli Revivalists . '
120337	120348	120349	120349	he	746	' Here if you like , are colour and beauty , '
120367	120532	120534	120535	the bard	4503	' These , dearest Smithson , are worth all the rest of your collection ; worth vanloads of your cloisonnť enamels , your dragon - jars in blood - colour and blue . This cloudy indefinable substance , not crudely transparent nor yet distinctly opaque , a something which touches the boundary line of two worlds the real and the ideal . And then the colour ! Great heaven , can anything be lovelier than this shadowy tint which is neither yellow nor green ; faint , faint as the dawn of newly - awakened day ? After the siege of blood - bedabbled Delhi , Baron Rothschild sent a special agent to India to buy him a little jade tea - pot which had been the joy of Eastern Kings . Only a tea - pot . Yet Rothschild deemed it worth a voyage from England to India . That is what the love of the beautiful means , in Jew or Gentile , '
120826	120835	120836	120836	he	4508	' That 's why I adore Lady Kirkbank , '
120841	120899	120836	120836	he	4508	' The dear soul never pretends to be any better than the rest of us . She gambles , and we all know she gambles ; she pegs , and we all know she pegs ; and she makes rather a boast of being up to her eyes in debt . No humbug about dear old Georgie . '
121451	121462	121463	121463	he	605	' You say that you regard me as your friend , '
121466	121505	121463	121463	he	605	' Do not withdraw that privilege from me because I have asked for a higher place in your esteem . Forget all I have said this morning . Be assured I shall never offend you by repeating it . '
121506	121513	121515	121515	Lesbia	499	' You are more than good , '
121534	121551	121553	121554	Mr. Smithson	726	' I hope that you and Lady Kirkbank will go and hear Madame Metzikoff this afternoon , '
121564	121579	121553	121554	Mr. Smithson	726	' The duchess 's rooms are lovely ; but no doubt you know them . '
121606	121618	121619	121619	she	499	' There are people Lady Kirkbank can not get on with , '
121622	121642	121619	121619	she	499	' Perhaps she will hardly like to go to the duchess 's , as she does not visit her . '
121643	121692	121619	121619	she	499	' Oh , but this affair counts for nothing . We go to hear Metzikoff , not to bow down to the duchess . All the people in town who care for music will be there , and you who play so divinely must enjoy fine professional playing . '
121693	121701	121703	121703	Lesbia	499	' I worship a really great player , '
121705	121725	121703	121703	Lesbia	499	' and if I can drag Lady Kirkbank to the house of the enemy , we will be there . '
121732	121736	121739	121739	his	726	' au revoir , '
121760	121765	121766	121766	he	726	' Refusal number one , '
121794	121841	121769	121769	himself	726	' We may have to go through refusal number two and number three ; but she means to have me . She is a very clever girl for a countrybred one ; and she knows that it is worth her while to be Lady Lesbia Smithson . '
122028	122038	122040	122041	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Mr. Smithson has been here , I understand , '
122062	122070	122056	122056	she	585	' Rilboche passed him on the stairs . '
122071	122081	122083	122083	Lesbia	726	' Rilboche is always passing people on the stairs , '
122087	122105	122083	122083	Lesbia	726	' I think she must spend her life on the landing , listening for arrivals and departures . '
122106	122164	122166	122167	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I had a kind of vague idea that Smithson would call to - day . He was so fussy about those tickets for the Metzikoff recital . I hate pianoforte recitals , and I detest that starched old duchess , but I suppose I shall have to take you there or poor Smithson will be miserable , '
122236	122269	122362	122363	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Well , my dear , has he proposed ? There was something in his manner last night when he put on your wraps that made me think the crisis was near . '
122270	122292	122362	122363	Lady Kirkbank	585	' The crisis is come and is past , and Mr. Smithson and I are just as good friends as ever . '
122293	122296	122298	122299	Lady Kirkbank	585	' What ! '
122301	122314	122298	122299	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Do you mean to tell me that you have refused him ? '
122315	122349	122362	122363	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Certainly . You know I never meant to do anything else . Did you think I was like Miss Trinder , bent upon marrying town and country houses , stables and diamonds ? '
122350	122360	122362	122363	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I did not think you were a fool , '
122416	122492	122402	122403	Lady Kirkbank	585	' What can be your motive in refusing one of the very best matches of the season or of ever so many seasons ? You think , perhaps , you will marry a duke , if you wait long enough for his Grace to appear ; but the number of marrying dukes is rather small , Lady Lesbia , and I do n't think any of those would care to marry Lord Maulevrier 's granddaughter . '
122503	122521	122522	122522	she	499	' Why do you fling my grandfather 's name in my face and with that diabolical sneer ? '
122525	122593	122522	122522	she	499	' When I have asked you about him you have always evaded my questions . Why should a man of the highest rank shrink from marrying Lord Maulevrier 's granddaughter ? My grandfather was a distinguished man Governor of Madras . Such posts are not given to nobodies . How can you dare to speak as if it were a disgrace to me to belong to him ? '
122597	122609	122610	122611	Lady Kirkbank	585	' CLUBS , DIAMONDS , HEARTS , IN WILD DISORDER SEEN . '
122692	122707	122709	122709	Georgie	597	' My dearest girl , I was beside myself , and talked sheer nonsense , '
122711	122999	122709	122709	Georgie	597	' But you know really now , dearest , any woman of the world would be provoked at your foolish refusal of that dear good Smithson . Only think of that too lovely house in Park Lane , a palace in the style of the Italian Renaissance such a house is in itself equivalent to a peerage and there is no doubt Smithson will be offered a peerage before he is much older . I have heard it confidently asserted that when the present Ministry retires Smithson will be made a Peer . You have no idea what a useful man he is , or what henchman 's service he has done the Ministry in financial matters . And then there is his villa at Deauville you do n't know Deauville a positively perfect place , the villa , I mean , built by the Duke de Morny in the golden days of the Empire and another at Cowes , and his palace in Berkshire , a manor , my love , with a glorious old Tudor manor - house ; and he has a pied a terre in Paris , in the Faubourg , a ground - floor furnished in the Pompeian style , half - a - dozen rooms opening one out of the other , and surrounding a small garden , with a fountain in the middle . Some of the greatest people in Paris occupy the upper part of the house , and their rooms of course are splendid ; but Smithson 's ground - floor is the gem of the Faubourg . However , I suppose there is no use in talking any more ; for there is the gong for luncheon . '
123008	123022	123023	123023	she	4561	' I would rather have a cup of tea in my own room , '
123026	123037	123023	123023	she	4561	' This Smithson business has given me an abominable headache . '
123038	123047	122709	122709	Georgie	597	' But you will go to hear Metzikoff ? '
123048	123076	123023	123023	she	4561	' No , thanks . You detest the Duchess of Lostwithiel , and you do n't care for pianoforte recitals . Why should I drag you there ? '
123077	123131	122709	122709	Georgie	597	' But , my dearest Lesbia , I am not such a selfish wretch as to keep you at home , when I know you are passionately fond of good music . Forget all about your headache , and let me see how that lovely little Catherine of Aragon bonnet suits you . I 'm
123183	123183	123147	123147	she	714	'
123184	123189	123191	123191	Lesbia	726	' Another new bonnet ! '
123193	123208	123191	123191	Lesbia	726	' What an infinity of things I seem to be having from Seraphine . I 'm
123220	123220	123210	123210	I	0	'
123331	123350	123352	123353	Lady Kirkbank	585	' If you had only accepted Mr. Smithson it would not matter how much money you owed people , '
123355	123376	123352	123353	Lady Kirkbank	585	' You had better come down to lunch . A glass of Heidseck will bring you up to concert pitch . '
123901	123906	123907	123907	Lesbia	726	' She is exquisite , '
123962	123965	123967	123967	he	726	' better form '
124186	124208	124209	124209	he	726	' You see that I am determined not to lose the privilege of your society , because I have been foolish ! '
124224	124243	124209	124209	he	726	' I hope you will consider me as much your friend to - day as I was yesterday . '
124244	124249	124250	124250	she	585	' Quite as much , '
124340	124351	124353	124354	Mr. Smithson	769	' I should love of all things to be there , '
124375	124394	124358	124358	He	726	' But how can I be sure that I shall not be turning Sir George out of doors ? '
124395	124425	124353	124354	Mr. Smithson	769	' Sir George can never sit out a serious play . He only cares for Chaumont or Judie . The Demi - monde is much too prosy for him . '
124426	124442	124444	124444	Smithson	769	' The Demi - monde is one of the finest plays in the French language , '
124446	124457	124444	124444	Smithson	769	' You know it , of course , Lady Lesbia ? '
124458	124491	124353	124354	Mr. Smithson	769	' Alas ! no . At Fellside I was not allowed to read French plays or novels : or only a novel now and then , which my grandmother selected for me . '
124492	124505	124444	124444	Smithson	769	' And now you read everything , I suppose , including Zola ? '
124506	124527	124529	124529	Lesbia	499	' The books are lying about , and I dip into them sometimes while I am having my hair brushed , '
124533	124549	124551	124552	Mr. Smithson	769	' I believe that is the only time ladies devote to literature during the season , '
124554	124577	124551	124552	Mr. Smithson	769	' Well , I envy you the delight of seeing the Demi - monde without knowing what it is all about beforehand . '
124578	124600	124602	124603	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I daresay there are a good many people who would not take their girls to see a play by Dumas , '
124605	124627	124602	124603	Lady Kirkbank	585	' but I make a point of letting my girls see everything . It widens their minds and awakens their intelligence . '
124628	124639	124641	124642	Mr. Smithson	769	' And does away with a good many silly prejudices , '
124716	124731	124733	124734	Lady Kirkbank	585	' If it were an English play we would not care for being punctual , '
124736	124755	124733	124734	Lady Kirkbank	585	' but I should hate to lose a word of Dumas . In his plays every speech tells . '
125069	125097	125099	125099	Maulevrier	461	' How d'ye do , Lady Kirkbank ? how d'ye do , Lesbia ? Just caught sight of you from below as the curtain was going down , '
125116	125159	125108	125109	Mr. Smithson	769	' Rather surprised to see you and Lesbia here to - night , Lady Kirkbank . Is n't the Demi - monde rather strong meat for babes , eh ? Not exactly the play one would take a young lady to see . '
125160	125186	125188	125189	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Why should a young lady be forbidden to see a fine play , because there are some hard and bitter truths told in it ? '
125191	125314	125188	125189	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Lesbia sees Madame d'Ange and all her sisterhood in the Park and about London every day of her life . Why should not she see them on the stage , and hear their history , and understand how cruel their fate is , and learn to pity them , if she can ? I really think this play is a lesson in Christian charity ; and I should like to see that Oliver man strangled , though Delaunay plays the part divinely . What a voice ! What a manner ! How polished ! How perfect ! And they tell me he is going to leave the stage in a year or two . What will the world do without him ? '
125585	125587	125582	125582	her	499	' run '
125622	125642	125644	125644	Lesbia	499	' I might as well be at Fellside and you in London , for anything I see of you , '
125646	125670	125671	125671	Maulevrier	461	' You are up to your eyes in engagements , and I do n't suppose you want to see any more of me . '
125676	125703	125671	125671	Maulevrier	461	' But I 'll call to - morrow morning , if I am likely to find you at home . I 've some news for you . '
125704	125733	125671	125671	Maulevrier	461	' Then I 'll stay at home on purpose to see you . News is always delightful . Is it good news , by - the - bye ? '
125734	125745	125671	125671	Maulevrier	461	' Very good ; at least , I think so . '
125746	125752	125671	125671	Maulevrier	461	' What is it about ? '
125753	125776	125671	125671	Maulevrier	461	' Oh ! that 's a long story , and the curtain is just going up . The news is about Mary . '
125777	125781	125783	125783	Lesbia	499	' About Mary ! '
125789	125799	125786	125786	her	499	' What news can there possibly be about Mary ? '
125800	125820	125671	125671	Maulevrier	461	' Such news as there generally is about every nice jolly girl , at least once in her life . '
125821	125834	125786	125786	her	499	' You do n't mean that she is engaged to a curate ? '
125835	125877	125671	125671	Maulevrier	461	' No , not to a curate . There goes the curtain . " I 'll see you later , " as the Yankee President used to say when people bothered him , and he did n't like to say no . '
126026	126034	126036	126036	Lesbia	499	' But who can the man be ? '
126038	126125	126036	126036	Lesbia	499	' Mary has been kept as secluded as a cloistered nun . There are so few families we have ever been allowed to mix with . The man must be a curate , who has taken advantage of grandmother 's illness to force his way into the family circle at Fellside and who has made love to Mary in some of her lonely rambles over the hills , I daresay . It is really very wrong to allow a girl to roam about in that way . '
126447	126451	126442	126444	the scientific matron	4649	' good fun . '
126493	126510	126512	126513	Colonel Delville	782	' Do you know you are making me positively wretched by your talk about that man ? '
126533	126553	126557	126558	Sir George	769	' No , I tell you there was never anything offered higher than five to four on the mare , '
126560	126587	126557	126558	Sir George	769	' There was a day when I thought I was your idea of an attractive man . Yes , George , a clear case of roping , '
126591	126608	126557	126558	Sir George	769	' And to hear you raving about this play - acting fellow it is too humiliating . '
126617	126624	126625	126625	she	585	' We are getting old together , '
126628	126709	126625	126625	she	585	' I have come to an age when one can only admire the charm of manner in the abstract the Beautiful for the sake of the Beautiful . I think if I were lying in my grave , the music of Delaunay 's voice would thrill me , under six feet of London clay . Will no one take any more wine ? No . Then we may as well go into the next room and begin our little Nap . '
126887	126909	126915	126915	he	769	' There is n't a room in my house that looks half as comfortable as this den of yours , George , '
126934	126950	126951	126951	Smithson	769	' Partners at cards , even if we are not to be partners for life , '
126987	127002	127004	127005	Sir George	769	' That is because everything in your house is so confoundedly handsome and expensive , '
127048	127088	127045	127046	Mr. Smithson	769	' No man can expect to be comfortable in a house in which every room has cost a small fortune . My wife re - arranged this den half - a - dozen years ago when we took to sittin '
127093	127110	127045	127046	Mr. Smithson	769	' . She picked up the chairs and the blue pots at Bonham 's , had everythin '

127346	127360	127362	127362	Lesbia	499	' I am afraid to think of how much I must owe you , '
127372	127387	127362	127362	Lesbia	499	' Oh , nothing worth speaking of sixteen or seventeen pounds , at most . '
127781	127791	127793	127794	Lady Kirkbank	585	' The sums people spend nowadays are positively appalling , '

128123	128144	128120	128120	she	499	' and tell me this nonsense about Mary . I am expiring with curiosity . The thing is too absurd . '
128145	128149	128151	128151	Maulevrier	524	' Why absurd ? '
128175	128183	128185	128185	Lesbia	499	' Oh , for a thousand reasons , '
128199	128243	128185	128185	Lesbia	499	' First and foremost it is absurd to think of any one so buried alive as poor Mary is finding an admirer ; and secondly well I do n't want to be rude to my own sister but Mary is not particularly attractive . '
128244	128254	128194	128194	her	499	' Mary is the dearest girl in the world . '
128255	128269	128185	128185	Lesbia	499	' Very likely . I only said that she is not particularly attractive . '
128270	128291	128194	128194	her	499	' And do you think there is no attraction in goodness , in freshness and innocence , candour , generosity ? '
128292	128329	128185	128185	Lesbia	499	' I do n't know . But I think that if Mary 's nose had been a thought longer , and if she had kept her skin free from freckles she would have been almost pretty . '
128330	128350	128194	128194	her	499	' Do you really ? Luckily for Mary the man who is going to marry her thinks her lovely . '
128351	128388	128185	128185	Lesbia	499	' I suppose he likes freckles . I once heard a man say he did . He said they were so original so much character about them . And , pray , who is the man ? '
128389	128402	128194	128194	her	499	' Your old adorer , and my dear friend , John Hammond . '
128490	128501	128502	128502	she	499	' Your friend Mr. Hammond must be a fickle fool , '
128505	128518	128502	128502	she	499	' who does not know his own mind from day to day . '
128519	128618	128476	128476	his	4694	' Oh , but it was more than a day after you rejected him that he engaged himself to Molly . It was all my doing , and I am proud of my work . I took the poor fellow back to Fellside last March , bruised and broken by your cruel treatment , heartsore and depressed . I gave him over to Molly , and Molly cured him . Unconsciously , innocently , she won that noble heart . Ah , Lesbia , you do n't know what a heart it is which you so nearly broke . '
128619	128634	128636	128636	Lesbia	499	' Girls in our rank of life ca n't afford to marry noble hearts , '

128656	128742	128476	128476	his	4694	' She cut up rather rough at first ; but Molly held her own like a young lioness and the grandmother gave way . You see she has a fixed idea that Molly is a very second - rate sort of person compared with you , and that a husband who was not nearly good enough for you might pass muster for Molly ; and so she gave way , and there is n't a happier young woman in the three kingdoms than Mary Haselden .

128743	128751	128753	128753	Lesbia	499	' What are they to live upon ? '
128760	128791	128476	128476	his	4694	' Mary will have her five hundred a year . And Hammond is a very clever fellow . You may be sure he will make his mark in the world . '
128792	128827	128476	128476	his	4694	' And how are they to live while he is making his mark ? Five hundred a year wo n't do more than pay for Mary 's frocks , if she goes into society . '
128828	128836	128476	128476	his	4694	' Perhaps they will live without society . '
128837	128853	128855	128855	Lesbia	499	' In some horrid little hovel in one of those narrow streets off Ecclestone Square , '
128859	128890	128855	128855	Lesbia	499	' It is too dreadful to think of a young woman dooming herself to life - long penury , just because she is so foolish as to fall in love . '
128891	128906	128908	128908	Maulevrier	524	' Your days for falling in love are over , I suppose , Lesbia ? '
128985	129001	129578	129578	Lesbia	499	' I do n't know ; I am too busy to think of such things . '
129002	129034	129578	129578	Lesbia	499	' You have done with love ; and you have begun to think of marriage , of establishing yourself properly . People tell me you are going to marry Mr. Smithson . '
129035	129048	129578	129578	Lesbia	499	' People tell you more about me than I know about myself . '
129049	129081	129578	129578	Lesbia	499	' Come now , Lesbia , I have a right to know the truth upon this point . Your brother your only brother should be the first person to be told . '
129082	129104	129106	129106	Lesbia	499	' When I am engaged , I have no doubt you will be the first person , or the second person , '
129110	129126	129106	129106	Lesbia	499	' Lady Kirkbank , living on the premises , is likely to be the first . '
129127	129136	129578	129578	Lesbia	499	' Then you are not engaged to Smithson ? '
129137	129175	129106	129106	Lesbia	499	' Did n't I tell you so just now ? Mr. Smithson did me the honour to make me an offer yesterday , at about this hour ; and I did myself the honour to reject him . '
129176	129241	129578	129578	Lesbia	499	' And yet you were whispering together in the box last night , and you were riding in the Row with him this morning . I just met a fellow who saw you together . Do you think it is right , Lesbia , to play fast and loose with the man to encourage him , if you do n't mean to marry him ? '
129242	129315	129106	129106	Lesbia	499	' How can you accuse me of encouraging a person whom I flatly refused yesterday morning ? If Mr. Smithson likes my society as a friend , must I needs deny him my friendship , ask Lady Kirkbank to shut her door against him ? Mr. Smithson is very pleasant as an acquaintance ; and although I do n't want to marry him , there 's no reason I should snub him . '
129316	129343	129578	129578	Lesbia	499	' Smithson is not a man to be trifled with . You will find yourself entangled in a web which you wo n't easily break through . '
129344	129371	129106	129106	Lesbia	499	' I am not afraid of webs . By - the - bye , is it true that Mr. Smithson is likely to get a peerage ? '
129372	129577	129578	129578	Lesbia	499	' I have heard people say as much . Smithson has spent no end of money on electioneering , and is a power in the House , though he very rarely speaks . His Berkshire estate gives him a good deal of influence in that county ; at the last general election he subscribed twenty thou to the Conservative cause ; for , like most men who have risen from nothing , your friend Smithson is a fine old Tory . He was specially elected at the Carlton six years ago , and has made himself uncommonly useful to his party . He is supposed to be great on financial questions , and comes out tremendously on colonial railways or drainage schemes , about which the House in general is in profound ignorance . On those occasions Smithson scores high . A man with immense wealth has always chances . No doubt , if you were to marry him , the peerage would be easily managed . Smithson 's money , backed by the Maulevrier influence , would go a long way . My grandmother would move heaven and earth in a case of that kind . You had better take pity on Smithson . '
129645	129666	129667	129667	she	499	' Suppose I were inclined to accept him , would you like him as a brother - in - law ? '
129671	129685	129667	129667	she	499	' I thought from your manner last night that you rather disliked him . '
129686	129839	129843	129843	his	4702	' I do n't quite like him or any of his breed , the newly rich , who go about in society swelling with the sense of their own importance , perspiring gold , as it were . And one has always a faint suspicion of men who have got rich very quickly , an idea that there must be some kind of juggling . Not in the case of a great contractor , perhaps , who can point to a viaduct and docks and railways , and say , " I built that , and that , and that . These are the sources of my wealth . " But a man who gets enormously rich by mere ciphering ! Where can his money come from , except out of other people 's pockets ? I know nothing against your Mr. Smithson , but I always suspect that class of men , '
129886	129897	129898	129898	she	499	' When are Mary and Mr. Hammond to be married ? '
129901	129931	129898	129898	she	499	' Grandmother says they must wait a year . Mary is much too young and so on , and so forth . But I see no reason for waiting . '
129932	129952	129866	129867	an oracle	4258	' Surely there are reasons financial reasons . Mr. Hammond can not be in a position to begin housekeeping . '
129953	129986	129898	129898	she	499	' Oh , they will risk all that . Molly is a daring girl . He proposed to her on the top of Helvellyn , in a storm of wind and rain . '
129987	130002	129866	129867	an oracle	4258	' And she never wrote me a word about it . How very unsisterly ! '
130003	130026	129898	129898	she	499	' She is as wild as a hawk , and I daresay she was too shy to tell you anything about it . '
130027	130035	129866	129867	an oracle	4258	' Pray when did it all occur ? '
130036	130044	129898	129898	she	499	' Just before I came to London . '
130045	130109	129866	129867	an oracle	4258	' Two months ago . How absurd for me to be in ignorance all this time ! Well , I hope Mary will be sensible , and not marry till Mr. Hammond is able to give her a decent home . It would be so dreadful to have a sister muddling in poverty , and clamouring for one 's cast - off gowns . '
130117	130127	130128	130128	he	4705	' It is not easy to foretell the future , '
130131	130151	130128	130128	he	4705	' but I think I may venture to promise that Molly will never wear your cast - off gowns . '
130152	130203	129898	129898	she	499	' Oh , you think she would be too proud . You do n't know , perhaps , how poverty genteel poverty lowers one 's pride . I have heard stories from Lady Kirkbank that would make your hair stand on end . I am beginning to know the world . '
130204	130264	130128	130128	he	4705	' I am glad of that . If you are to live in the world it is better that you should know what it is made of . But if I had a voice or a choice in the matter I had rather my sisters stayed at Grasmere , and remained ignorant of the world and all its ways . '
130265	130334	129898	129898	she	499	' While you enjoy your life in London . That is just like the selfishness of a man . Under the pretence of keeping his sisters or his wife secure from all possible contact with evil , he buries them alive in a country house , while he has all the wickedness for his own share in London . Oh , I am beginning to understand the creatures . '
130335	130364	130128	130128	he	4705	' I am afraid you are beginning to be wise . Remember that knowledge of evil was the prelude to the Fall . Well , good - bye . '
130365	130373	129898	129898	she	499	' Wo n't you stay to lunch ? '
130374	130404	130128	130128	he	4705	' No , thanks , I never lunch frightful waste of time . I shall drop in at the Haute Gomme and take a cup of tea later on . '
130475	130487	130488	130488	she	499	' Maulevrier , I want you to do me a favour , '
130530	130567	130518	130518	she	499	' I I lost money at Nap last night . Only seventeen pounds . Mr. Smithson and I were partners , and he paid my losses . I want to pay him immediately , and - - '
130568	130588	130590	130590	Maulevrier	524	' And you are too hard up to do it . I 'll write you a cheque this instant , '
130614	130625	130626	130626	she	499	' I am obliged to do as Lady Kirkbank does , '
130630	130648	130626	130626	she	499	' If I were to refuse to play it would be a kind of reproach to her . '
130649	130660	130662	130662	Maulevrier	524	' I do n't think that would kill Lady Kirkbank , '
130670	130714	130662	130662	Maulevrier	524	' She has had to endure a good many implied reproaches in her day , and they do n't seem to have hurt her very much . I wish to heaven my grandmother had chosen any one else in London for your chaperon . '
130715	130717	130626	130626	she	499	' I 'm
130728	130734	130736	130736	I	0	' answered Lesbia , coolly ; '
130814	130814	130805	130805	I	0	'
130815	130837	130839	130839	Maulevrier	524	' I 've made the cheque for five - and - twenty . You can cash it at your milliner 's , '
130841	130861	130839	130839	Maulevrier	524	' I should not like Smithson to know that you had been obliged to ask me for the money . '
130862	130880	130882	130882	Lesbia	499	' Apropos to Mr. Smithson , do you know if he is in quite the best society ? '
130884	131005	130805	130805	I	0	' I do n't know what you mean by quite the best . A man of Smithson 's wealth can generally poke his nose in anywhere , if he knows how to behave himself . But of course there are people with whom money and fine houses have no weight . The Conservatives are all civil to Smithson because he comes down handsomely at General Elections , and is useful to them in other ways . I believe that Smithson 's wife , if she were a thorough - bred one , could go into any society she liked , and make her house one of the most popular in London . Perhaps that is what you really wanted to ask .
131006	131013	131015	131015	Lesbia	499	' No , it was n't , '
131019	131042	131015	131015	Lesbia	499	' I was only talking for the sake of talking . A thousand thanks for the cheque , you best of brothers . '
131043	131071	130805	130805	I	0	' It is not worth talking about ; but , Lesbia , do n't play cards any more . Believe me , it is not good form . '
131072	131106	131015	131015	Lesbia	499	' Well , I 'll try to keep out of it in future . It is horrid to see one 's sovereigns melting away ; but there 's a delightful excitement in winning . '
131107	131111	131113	131113	Maulevrier	524	' No doubt , '
131894	131902	131903	131903	she	499	' It can not be so much , '
131908	131916	131903	131903	she	499	' It must be added up wrong ; '
132017	132041	131997	131997	she	714	' To re - setting a suite of amethysts , with forty - four finest Brazilian brilliants , three hundred and fifteen pounds . '
132102	132110	132154	132155	Lady Kirkbank	585	' ROSES CHOKED AMONG THORNS AND THISTLES . '
132326	132339	132340	132340	she	499	' Have you any idea how much I owe Seraphine and Cabochon ? '
132350	132361	132340	132340	she	499	' What , have they sent in their bills already ? '
132362	132385	132340	132340	she	499	' Already ! I wish they had sent them before . I should have known how deeply I was getting into debt . '
132386	132392	132340	132340	she	499	' Are they very heavy ? '
132393	132423	132340	132340	she	499	' They are dreadful ! I owe over two thousand pounds . How can I tell Lady Maulevrier that ? Two thousand one hundred pounds ! It is awful . '
132424	132441	132443	132444	Lady Kirkbank	585	' There are women in London who would think very little of owing twice as much , '
132463	132514	132443	132444	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Your grandmother said you were to have carte blanche . She may think that you have been just a little extravagant ; but she can hardly be angry with you for having taken her at her word . Two thousand pounds ! Yes , it certainly is rather stiff . '
132515	132521	132523	132523	Lesbia	499	' Seraphine is a cheat ! '
132527	132534	132523	132523	Lesbia	499	' Her prices are positively exorbitant ! '
132535	132557	132443	132444	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My dear child , you must not say that . Seraphine is positively moderate in comparison with the new people . '
132558	132583	132523	132523	Lesbia	499	' And Mr. Cabochon , too . The idea of his charging me three hundred guineas for re - setting those stupid old amethysts . '
132584	132596	132598	132599	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My dear , you would have diamonds mixed with them , '
132742	132755	132757	132757	Lesbia	499	' I must write to my grandmother by this afternoon 's post , '
132764	132805	133008	133008	Lesbia	762	' Impossible . We have to be at the Ranelagh by four o'clock . Smithson and some other men are to meet us there . I have promised to drive Mrs. Mostyn down . You had better begin to dress . '
132806	132855	133008	133008	Lesbia	762	' But I ought to write to - day . I had better ask for this money at once , and have done with it . Two thousand pounds ! I feel as if I were a thief . You say my grandmother is not a rich woman ? '
132856	132997	133008	133008	Lesbia	762	' Not rich as the world goes nowadays . Nobody is rich now , except your commercial magnates , like Smithson . Great peers , unless their money is in London ground - rents , are great paupers . To own land is to be destitute . I do n't suppose two thousand pounds will break your grandmother 's bank ; but of course it is a large sum to ask for at the end of two months ; especially as she sent you a good deal of money while we were at Cannes . If you were engaged about to make a really good match you could ask for the money as a matter of course ; but as it is , although you have been tremendously admired , from a practical point of view you are a failure . '
133038	133054	133056	133057	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Do n't tell your grandmother anything about the bills for a week or two , '
133061	133076	133056	133057	Lady Kirkbank	585	' The creatures can wait for their money . Give yourself time to think . '
133077	133081	133083	133083	Lesbia	762	' I will , '
133087	133123	133056	133057	Lady Kirkbank	585	' And now make haste , and get ready for the Ranelagh . My love , your eyes are dreadfully heavy . You must use a little belladonna . I 'll send Rilboche to you . '
133371	133389	133391	133392	Lady Kirkbank	585	' One can see the season is waning when these people begin to pester with their accounts , '
133713	133723	133725	133726	her chaperon	2173	' My dear , Mr. Smithson has forgiven you , '
133728	133737	133725	133726	her chaperon	2173	' He is the soul of good nature . '
133738	133749	133751	133751	Lesbia	762	' One would think he was accustomed to be refused , '
133753	133808	133751	133751	Lesbia	762	' I do n't want to go to Rood Hall , but I do n't want to spoil your Henley week . Could not I run down to Grasmere for a week , with Kibble to take care of me , and see dear grandmother ? I could tell her about those dreadful bills . '
133809	133892	133952	133952	She	762	' Bury yourself at Grasmere in the height of the season ! Not to be thought of ! Besides , Lady Maulevrier objected before to the idea of your travelling alone with Kibble . No ! if you ca n't make up your mind to go to Rood Hall , George and I must make up our minds to stay away . But it will be rather hard lines ; for that Henley week is quite the jolliest thing in the summer . '
133893	133899	133901	133901	Lesbia	762	' Then I 'll go , '
133908	133923	133901	133901	Lesbia	762	' Not for worlds would I deprive you and Sir George of a pleasure . '
134101	134107	134108	134108	she	762	' You are very good , '
134111	134138	134108	134108	she	762	' but I have really no wish to be consulted . I am not a royal personage , remember . I could not presume to dictate . '
134139	134160	134090	134090	he	769	' But I wish you to dictate . I wish you to be imperious in the expression of your wishes . '
134161	134178	134180	134180	Lesbia	762	' Lady Kirkbank has a better right than I , if anybody is to be consulted , '
134184	134247	134090	134090	he	769	' Lady Kirkbank is an old dear , who gets on delightfully with everybody . But you are more sensitive . Your comfort might be marred by an obnoxious presence . I will ask nobody whom you do not like who is not thoroughly simpatico . Have you no particular friends of your own choosing whom you would like me to ask ? '
134287	134305	134306	134306	she	762	' I can fancy two girls getting quite attached to each other , out of the season , '
134309	134325	134306	134306	she	762	' but in May and June life is all a rush and a scramble - - '
134326	134339	134341	134342	Mr. Smithson	769	' And one has no time to gather wayside flowers of friendship , '
134344	134368	134341	134342	Mr. Smithson	769	' Still , if there are no people for whom you have an especial liking , there must be people whom you detest . '
134383	134399	134401	134402	Mr. Smithson	769	' Then let me be sure I do not ask any of your pet aversions , '
134404	134424	134401	134402	Mr. Smithson	769	' You met Mr. Plantagenet Parsons , the theatrical critic , at my house . Shall we have him ? '
134425	134432	134341	134342	Mr. Smithson	769	' I like all amusing people . '
134433	134461	134401	134402	Mr. Smithson	769	' And Horace Meander , the poet . Shall we have him ? He is brimful of conceits and affectations , but he 's a tremendous joke . '
134462	134468	134341	134342	Mr. Smithson	769	' Mr. Meander is charming . '
134469	134487	134401	134402	Mr. Smithson	769	' Suppose we ask Mostyn and his wife ? Her scraps of science are rather good fun . '
134488	134499	134501	134501	Lesbia	762	' I have n't the faintest objection to the Mostyns , '
134503	134511	134501	134501	Lesbia	762	' But who are " we " ? '
134512	134540	134401	134402	Mr. Smithson	769	' We are you and I , for the nonce . The invitations will be issued ostensibly by me , but they will really emanate from you . '
134541	134552	134554	134554	Lesbia	762	' I am to be the shadow behind the throne , '
134556	134560	134554	134554	Lesbia	762	' How delightful ! '
134561	134575	134577	134577	Smithson	762	' I would rather you were the sovereign ruler , on the throne , '
134581	134592	134577	134577	Smithson	762	' That throne shall be empty till you fill it . '
134593	134603	134605	134605	Lesbia	762	' Please go on with your list of people , '
134936	134943	134945	134945	Lesbia	762	' What am I to do ? '
134949	135033	134945	134945	Lesbia	762	' There is only one thing that can be done . We must go instantly to Seraphine and insist upon her inventing something . If she has no idea ready she must telegraph Worth and get him to send something over . Your old things will do very well for Rood Hall . You have no end of pretty gowns for morning and evening ; but you must be original on the race days . Your gowns will be in all the papers . '
135034	135045	135047	135047	Lesbia	762	' But I shall be only getting deeper into debt , '
135053	135092	134945	134945	Lesbia	762	' That ca n't be helped . If you go into society you must be properly dressed . We 'll go to Clanricarde Place directly after luncheon , and see what that old harpy has to show us . '
135245	135260	135228	135229	the latter	4619	' Miladi says you want something of the most original tant soit peu risquť for '
135263	135267	135228	135229	the latter	4619	' she said . '
135273	135296	135228	135229	the latter	4619	' and she tapped her forehead with a gold thimble which nobody had ever seen her use , but which looked respectable . '
135344	135348	135559	135560	Lady Kirkbank	585	' screamer . " '
135349	135358	135360	135361	Lady Kirkbank	585	' What a genius you are , Fifine , '
135365	135396	135360	135361	Lady Kirkbank	585	' The Faute dans le Passť was only produced last week . No one will have thought of copying Chaumont 's gowns yet awhile . The idea is an inspiration . '
135397	135405	135407	135408	Lady Lesbia	762	' What is the boating costume like ? '
135412	135421	135423	135424	the dressmaker	4097	' An exquisite combination of simplicity with ťlan , '
135426	135489	135423	135424	the dressmaker	4097	' A skin - tight indigo silk Jersey bodice , closely studded with dark blue beads , a flounced petticoat of indigo and amber foulard , an amber scarf drawn tightly round the hips , and a dark blue toque with a large bunch of amber poppies . Tan - coloured mousquetaire gloves , and Hessian boots of tan - coloured kid . '
135490	135494	135496	135496	Lesbia	762	' Hessian boots ! '
135498	135545	135423	135424	the dressmaker	4097	' But , yes , Miladi . The petticoat is somewhat short , you comprehend , to escape the damp of the deck , and , after all , Hessians are much less indelicate than silk stockings , legs a cru , as one may say . '
135546	135557	135559	135560	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Lesbia , you will look enchanting in yellow Hessians , '

And now let us think of the second day . I think as your first costume is to be nautical , and rather masculine , your second should be somewhat languishing and vaporeux . Creamy Indian muslin , wild flowers , a large Leghorn hat . '

They are most absorbing creatures , if you only give yourself up to the study of them ; but it is no use to be half - hearted in a study of that kind .

Monotonous , yes ; my life has been monotonous . No conventual gloom was ever deeper than the gloom of Fellside . My boy did nothing to lighten it for me , and his son followed in his father 's footsteps . You and Lesbia have been my only consolation . Lesbia ! I was so proud of her beauty , so proud and fond of her , because she was like me , and recalled my own youth . And see how easily she forgets me . She has gone into a new world , in which my age and my infirmities have no part ; and I am as nothing to her . '

Yes , read to me , child , read . Give me new thoughts , if you can , for my brain is weary with grinding the old ones . There was a grand debate in the Lords last night , and Lord Hartfield spoke . Let me hear his speech . You can read what was said by the man before him ; never mind the rest . '

Yes , my dear , I loved him fondly , dearly , truly , as you love that young man of yours ; and he was the only man I ever really loved . Fate parted us . But I have never forgotten him never , Mary , never . At this moment I have but to close my eyes and I can see his face see him looking at me as he looked the last time we met . He was a younger son , poor , his future quite hopeless in those days ; but it was not my fault we were parted . I would have married him yes , wedded poverty , just as you are going to marry this Mr. Hammond ; but my people would not let me ; and I was too young , too helpless , to make a good fight . Oh , Mary , if I had only fought hard enough , what a happy woman I might have been , and how good a wife . '

141777	141827	141755	141755	she	524	' I was better than Casar 's wife , Mary , for no breath of suspicion ever rested upon my name . But if I had married Ronald Hollister , I should have been a happy woman ; and that I have never been since I parted from him . '
141828	141841	141755	141755	she	524	' You have never seen the present Lord Hartfield , I think ? '
141842	142158	141755	141755	she	524	' Never ; but I have watched his career , I have thought of him . His father died while he was an infant , and he was brought up in seclusion by a widowed mother , who kept him tied to her apron - strings till he went to Oxford . She idolised him , and I am told she taught herself Latin and Greek , mathematics even , in order to help him in his boyish studies , and , later on , read Greek plays and Latin poetry with him , till she became an exceptional classic for a woman . She was her son 's companion and friend , sympathised with his tastes , his pleasures , his friendships ; devoted every hour of her life , every thought of her mind to his welfare , his interests , walked with him , rode with him , travelled half over Europe , yachted with him . Her friends all declared that the lad would grow up an odious milksop ; but I am told that there never was a manlier man than Lord Hartfield . From his boyhood he was his mother 's protector , helped to administer her affairs , acquired a premature sense of responsibility , and escaped almost all those vices which make young men detestable . His mother died within a few months of his majority . He was broken - hearted at losing her , and left Europe immediately after her death . From that time he has been a great traveller . But I suppose now that he has taken his seat in the House of Lords , and has spoken a good many times , he means to settle down and take his place among the foremost men of his day . I am told that he is worthy to take such a place . '
142159	142170	142172	142172	Mary	445	' You must feel warmly interested in watching his career , '
142176	142217	142219	142220	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I am interested in everything that concerns him . I will tell you another secret , Mary . I think I am getting into my dotage , my dear , or I should hardly talk to you like this , '
142256	142283	142284	142284	she	445	' Dear grandmother , I think you are talking to me like this to - day because you are beginning to care for me a little , '
142289	142317	142319	142320	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Oh , my dear , you are very good , very sweet and forgiving to care for me at all , after my neglect of you , '
142326	142436	142319	142320	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I have kept you out in the cold so long , Mary . Lesbia well , Lesbia has been a kind of infatuation for me , and like all infatuations mine has ended in disappointment and bitterness . Ambition has been the bane of my life , Mary ; and when I could no longer be ambitious for myself when my own existence had become a mere death in life , I began to dream and to scheme for the aggrandisement of my granddaughter . Lesbia 's beauty , Lesbia 's elegance seemed to make success certain and so I dreamt my dream which may never be fulfilled . '
142437	142452	142319	142320	Lady Maulevrier	524	' What was your dream , grandmother ? May I know all about it ? '
142453	142589	142319	142320	Lady Maulevrier	524	' That was the secret I spoke of just now . Yes , Mary , you may know , for I fear the dream will never be realised . I wanted my Lesbia to become Lord Hartfield 's wife . I would have brought them together myself , could I have but gone to London ; but , failing that , I fancied Lady Kirkbank would have divined my wishes without being told them , and would have introduced Hartfield to Lesbia ; and now the London season is drawing to a close , and Hartfield and Lesbia have never met . He hardly goes anywhere , I am told . He devotes himself exclusively to politics ; and he is not in Lady Kirkbank 's set . A terrible disappointment to me , Mary ! '
142590	142596	142598	142598	Mary	445	' It is a pity , '
142600	142644	142598	142598	Mary	445	' Lesbia is so lovely . If Lord Hartfield were fancy - free he ought to fall in love with her , could they but meet . I thought that in London all fashionable people knew each other , and were continually meeting . '
142645	142764	142319	142320	Lady Maulevrier	524	' It used to be so in my day , Mary . Almack 's was a common ground , even if there had been no other . But now there are circles and circles , I believe , rings that touch occasionally , but never break and mingle . I am afraid poor Georgie 's set is not quite so nice as I could have wished . Yet Lesbia writes as if she were in raptures with her chaperon , and with all the people she meets . And then Georgie tells me that this Mr. Smithson whom Lesbia has refused is a very important personage , a millionaire , and very likely to be made a peer . '
142765	142770	142772	142772	Mary	445	' A new peer , '
142779	142815	142772	142772	Mary	445	' One would rather have an old commoner . I always fancy a newly - made peer must be like a newly - built house , glaring , and staring , and arid and uncongenial . '
142816	142820	142822	142823	Lady Maulevrier	524	' C'est selon , '
142825	142855	142822	142823	Lady Maulevrier	524	' One would not despise a Chatham or a Wellington because of the newness of his title ; but a man who has only money to recommend him - - '
142898	142911	142912	142912	she	445	' I hope Lesbia will marry some one better than Mr. Smithson , '
142915	143040	143047	143047	her	445	' I hope so too , dear ; and yet do you know I have an idea that Lesbia means to accept Mr. Smithson , or she would hardly have consented to go to his house for the Henley week . Here is a letter from Georgie Kirkbank which you will have to answer for me to - morrow a letter full of raptures about Mr. Smithson 's place in Berkshire , Rood Hall . I remember the house well . I was there nearly fifty years ago , when the Heronvilles owned it ; and now the Heronvilles are all dead or ruined , and this city person is master of the fine old mansion . It is a strange world , Mary . '
143179	143187	143188	143188	she	445	' What extraordinary young men you are , '
143201	143230	143188	143188	she	445	' The idea of your descending upon us without a moment 's notice . Why did you not write or telegraph , that your rooms might be ready ? '
143231	143255	143257	143257	Maulevrier	461	' Am I to understand that all the spare rooms at Fellside are kept as damp as at the bottom of the lake ? '
143259	143276	143257	143257	Maulevrier	461	' I did not think any preparation was necessary ; but we can go back if we 're

143334	143343	143332	143332	Maulevrier	461	' Jack does n't count , I suppose ? '
143344	143361	143363	143363	Mary	445	' You know how glad I am , and that I want to hide my gladness , '
143377	143412	143363	143363	Mary	445	' You men are so vain . And now come and see grandmother , she will be cheered by your arrival . She has been so good to me just lately , so sweet . '
143413	143427	143429	143429	Hammond	526	' She might have been good and sweet to you all your life , '
143431	143456	143429	143429	Hammond	526	' I am not prepared to be grateful to her at a moment 's notice for any crumbs of affection she may throw you . '
143457	143476	143478	143478	Mary	445	' Oh but you must be grateful , sir ; and you must love her and pity her , '
143480	143506	143478	143478	Mary	445	' Think how sadly she has suffered . We can not be too kind to her , or too fond of her , poor dear . '
143507	143512	143514	143514	Hammond	526	' Mary is right , '
143524	143533	143514	143514	Hammond	526	' What wonderful instincts these young women have . '
143534	143556	143558	143558	Mary	445	' Come and see her ladyship ; and then you must have dinner , just as you had that first evening , '
143560	143588	143558	143558	Mary	445	' We 'll act that first evening over again , Jack ; only you ca n't fall in love with Lesbia , as she is n't here . '
143589	143615	143514	143514	Hammond	526	' I do n't think I surrendered that first evening , Mary . Though I thought your sister the loveliest girl I had ever seen . '
143616	143631	143633	143633	Mary	445	' And what did you think of me , sir ? Tell me that , '
143635	143653	143514	143514	Hammond	526	' Shall I tell you the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ? '
143654	143658	143514	143514	Hammond	526	' Of course . '
143659	143717	143514	143514	Hammond	526	' Then I freely confess that I did not think about you at all . You were there a pretty , innocent , bright young maiden , with big brown eyes and auburn hair ; but I thought no more about you than I did about the Gainsborough on the wall , which you very much resemble . '
143718	143724	143726	143726	Mary	445	' That is most humiliating , '
143738	143748	143750	143750	Hammond	526	' No , dearest , it is only natural , '
143752	143849	143750	143750	Hammond	526	' I believe if all the happy lovers in this world could be questioned , at least half of them would confess to having thought very little about each other at first meeting . They meet , and touch hands , and part again , and never guess the mystery of the future , which wraps them round like a cloud , never say of each other . There is my fate ; and then they meet again , and again , as hazard wills , and never know that they are drifting to their doom . '
144004	144016	144023	144023	her	524	' I am very glad to see you , Mr. Hammond , '
144033	144094	144023	144023	her	524	' It was a happy thought that brought you and Maulevrier here . When an old woman is as near the grave as I am her relatives ought to look after her . I shall be glad to have a little private conversation with you to - morrow , Mr. Hammond , if you can spare me a few minutes . '
144095	144105	144107	144107	Hammond	526	' As many hours , if your ladyship pleases , '

144119	144162	144023	144023	her	524	' Oh , no , you will want to be roaming about the hills with Mary , discussing your plans for the future . I shall not encroach too much on your time . But I am very glad you are here . '
144163	144175	144177	144177	Maulevrier	524	' We shall only trespass on you for a few days , '
144179	144185	144177	144177	Maulevrier	524	' just a flying visit . '
144186	144198	144200	144200	Mary	445	' How is it that you are not both at Henley ? '
144202	144212	144200	144200	Mary	445	' I thought all the world was at Henley . '
144213	144222	144224	144224	Maulevrier	524	' Who is Henley ? what is Henley ? '
144229	144258	144260	144260	Hammond	526	' I believe Maulevrier has lost so much money backing his college boat on previous occasions that he is glad to run away from the regatta this year , '
144262	144269	144271	144272	his friend	7076	' I have a sister there , '
144274	144307	144271	144272	his friend	7076	' That 's an all - sufficient explanation . When a fellow 's women - kind take to going to races and regattas it is high time for him to stop away . '
144308	144315	144317	144318	his grandmother	1501	' Have you seen Lesbia lately ? '
144320	144326	144271	144272	his friend	7076	' About ten days ago . '
144327	144334	144271	144272	his friend	7076	' And did she seem happy ? '
144340	144382	144335	144335	Maulevrier	524	' She was vacillating between the refusal or the acceptance of a million of money and four or five fine houses . I do n't know whether that condition of mind means happiness . I should call it an intermediate state . '
144383	144405	144271	144272	his friend	7076	' Why do you make silly jokes about serious questions ? Do you think Lesbia means to accept this Mr. Smithson ? '
144406	144412	144335	144335	Maulevrier	524	' All London thinks so . '
144413	144421	144271	144272	his friend	7076	' And is he a good man ? '
144422	144436	144335	144335	Maulevrier	524	' Good for a hundred thousand pounds at half an hour 's notice . '
144437	144445	144271	144272	his friend	7076	' Is he worthy of your sister ? '
144461	144468	144335	144335	Maulevrier	524	' I think he is quite . '
144469	144480	144482	144483	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Then I am content that she should marry him , '
144485	144492	144482	144483	Lady Maulevrier	524	' although he is a nobody . '
144493	144528	144335	144335	Maulevrier	524	' Oh , but he is a very important nobody , a nobody who can get a peerage next year , backed by the Maulevrier influence , which I suppose would count for something . '
144529	144537	144539	144540	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Most of my friends are dead , '
144542	144557	144539	144540	Lady Maulevrier	524	' but there are a few survivors of the past who might help me . '
144558	144603	144335	144335	Maulevrier	524	' I do n't think there 'll be any difficulty or doubt about the peerage . Smithson stumped up very handsomely at the last General Election , and the Conservatives are not strong enough to be ungrateful . " These have no master . " '
144762	144775	144776	144776	she	445	' Dear grandmother , I believe you are beginning to love me , '
144812	144820	144822	144823	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I am beginning to know you , '
144827	144906	144907	144907	she	524	' I think it is the magic of love , Mary , that has sweetened and softened your nature , and endeared you to me . I think you have grown ever so much sweeter a girl since your engagement . Or it may be that you were the same always , and it was I who was blind . Lesbia was all in all to me . All in all and now I am nothing to her , '
144917	144935	144937	144937	Mary	445	' I am so proud to think that you see an improvement in me since my engagement , '
144941	144961	144937	144937	Mary	445	' I have tried very hard to improve myself , so that I might be more worthy of him . '
144962	145051	145076	145076	She	445	' You are worthy , Mary , worthy of the best and the highest : and I believe that , although you are making what the world calls a very bad match , you are marrying wisely . You are wedding yourself to a life of obscurity ; but what does that matter , if it be a happy life ? I have known what it is to pursue the phantom fortune , and to find youth and hope and happiness vanish from the pathway which I followed . '
145052	145070	145072	145072	Mary	445	' Dear grandmother , I wish you had been able to marry the man of your choice , '
145109	145131	145133	145134	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I should have been a happier woman and a better woman if fate had been kind to me , Mary , '
145138	145179	145133	145134	Lady Maulevrier	524	' and now that I am daily drawing nearer the land of shadows , I will not stand in the way of faithful lovers . I have a fancy , Mary , that I have not many months to live . '
145180	145187	145189	145189	Mary	445	' Only an invalid 's fancy , '
145206	145234	145189	145189	Mary	445	' only a morbid fancy , nursed in the monotony of this quiet room . Maulevrier and Jack and I must find some way of amusing you . '
145235	145314	145133	145134	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You will never amuse me out of that conviction , my dear . I can see the shadows lengthening and the sands running out . There are but a few grains left in the glass , Mary ; and while those last I should like to see you and Mr. Hammond married . I should like to feel that your fate is settled before I go . God knows what confusion and trouble may follow my death . '
145325	145336	145338	145338	Mary	445	' I am not going to leave you , grandmother , '
145340	145366	145133	145134	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Not even for the man you love ? You are a good girl , Mary . Lesbia has forsaken me for a lesser temptation . '
145367	145387	145389	145389	Mary	445	' Grandmother , that is hardly fair . It was your own wish to have Lesbia presented this season , '
145396	145422	145133	145134	Lady Maulevrier	524	' True , my dear . I saw she was very tired of her life here , and I thought it was better . But I 'm
145534	145534	145524	145524	I	0	'
145785	145797	145799	145799	Mary	445	' You are to come to her ladyship directly , please , '
145883	145900	145901	145901	he	525	' What does her ladyship want with me , darling ? and why are you blushing ? '
145904	145917	145919	145919	Mary	445	' I I think she is going to talk about our marriage , '
145921	145942	145944	145944	Hammond	524	' " Why , I will talk to her upon this theme until mine eyelids can no longer wag , " '
145946	145962	145944	145944	Hammond	524	' Take me to her , Mary . I hope her ladyship is growing sensible . '
145963	145980	145984	145984	him	525	' She is very kind , very sweet . She has changed so much of late . '
146248	146285	146287	146288	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Mr. Hammond , I feel a confidence in your integrity , your goodness of heart , and high principle which I never thought I could feel for a man of whom I know so little , '
146292	146376	146287	146288	Lady Maulevrier	524	' All I know of you or your antecedents is what my grandson has told me and I must say that the information so given has been very meagre . And yet I believe in you and yet I am going to trust you , wholly , blindly , implicitly and I am going to give you my granddaughter , ever so much sooner than I intended to give her to you . Soon , very soon , if you will have her ! '
146377	146396	146398	146398	Hammond	524	' I will have her to - morrow , if there is time to get a special licence , '
146413	146540	146287	146288	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You shall marry her very soon , if you like , marry her by special licence , in this room . I should like to see your wedding . I have a strange impatience to behold one of my granddaughters happily married , to know that her future is secure , that come weal , come woe , she is safe in the protection of a brave true man . I am not scared by the idea of a little poverty . That is often the best education for youth . But while you and I are alone we may as well talk about ways and means . Perhaps you may hardly feel prepared to take upon yourself the burden of a wife this year . '
146541	146554	146287	146288	Lady Maulevrier	524	' As well this year as next . I am not afraid . '
146555	146704	146287	146288	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Young men are so rash . However , as long as I live your responsibilities will be only nominal . This house will be Mary 's home , and yours whenever you are able to occupy it . Of course I should not like to interfere with your professional efforts but if you are cultivating literature , why books can be written at Fellside better than in London . This lakeland of ours has been the nursery of deathless writers . But I feel that my days are numbered and when I am dead well death is always a cause of change and trouble of some kind , and Mary will profit very little by my death . The bulk of my fortune is left to Lesbia . I have taught her to consider herself my heiress ; and it would be unjust to alter my will . '
146705	146724	146726	146726	Hammond	524	' Pray do not dream of such a thing there is no need Mary will be rich enough , '
146730	146743	146745	146746	Lady Maulevrier	524	' With five hundred a year and the fruits of your industry , '
146748	146818	146745	146746	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Yes , yes , with modest aspirations and simple habits , people can live happily , honourably , on a few hundreds a year . And if you really mean to devote yourself to literature , and do not mind burying yourself alive in this lake district until you have made your name as a writer , why the problem of ways and means will be easily solved . '
146819	146918	146945	146946	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Dear Lady Maulevrier , I am not afraid of ways and means . That is the last question which need trouble you . I told Lesbia when I offered myself to her nearly a year ago , that if she would trust me , if she would cleave to me , poverty should never touch her , sordid care should never come near her dwelling . But she could not believe me . She was like Thomas the twin . I could show her no palpable security for my promise and she would not believe for the promise '
146933	146933	146930	146930	her	445	'
146934	146943	146945	146946	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Ah ! it was different with Lesbia , '
146948	147054	146945	146946	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I taught her to be ambitious . She had been schooled to set a high price upon herself . I know she cared for you very much , even . But she could not face poverty ; or , if you like , I will say that she could not face an obscure existence sacrifice her ambition , a justifiable ambition in one so lovely , at the bidding of her first wooer . And then , again , she was told that if she married you , she would for ever forfeit my regard . You must not blame her for obeying me . '
147055	147129	146930	146930	her	445	' I do not blame her ; for I have won the peerless pearl the jewel above all price a perfect woman . And now , dear Lady Maulevrier , give me but your consent , and I am off to York this afternoon , to interview the Archbishop , and get the special licence , which will allow me to we d my darling here by your couch to - morrow afternoon . '
147130	147166	146945	146946	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I have no objection to your getting the licence immediately ; but you must let me write a cheque before you go . A special licence is expensive I believe it costs fifty pounds . '
147167	147204	146930	146930	her	445	' If it cost a thousand I should not think it dear . But I have a notion that I shall be able to get the licence cheap . You have made me wild with happiness . '
147205	147214	146945	146946	Lady Maulevrier	524	' But you must not refuse my cheque . '
147215	147235	146930	146930	her	445	' Indeed I must , Lady Maulevrier . I am not quite such a pauper as you think me . '
147236	147277	146945	146946	Lady Maulevrier	524	' But fifty pounds and the expenses of the journey ; an outlay altogether unexpected on your part . I begin to fear that you are very reckless . A spendthrift shall never marry my granddaughter , with my consent . '
147278	147289	146930	146930	her	445	' I have never yet spent above half my income . '
147319	147327	147328	147328	she	524	' But I thought you were poor , '
147331	147381	147392	147393	Lady Maulevrier	524	' It has pleased you to think so , dear Lady Maulevrier ; but I have more than enough for all my wants , and I shall be able to provide a fitting home for my Mary , when you can spare her to preside over her own establishment . '
147382	147384	147441	147441	she	524	' Establishment '
147427	147440	147441	147441	she	524	' Well , Mr. Hammond , this is quite an agreeable surprise , '
147449	147493	147441	147441	she	524	' I really thought you were poor as poor as a young man of gentlemanlike habits could be , and yet exist . Perhaps you will wonder why , thinking this , I brought myself to consent to your marriage with my granddaughter . '
147494	147510	147512	147512	Hammond	525	' It was a great proof of your confidence in me , or in Providence , '
147516	147549	147441	147441	she	524	' It was no such thing . I was governed by a sentiment a memory . It was my love for the dead which softened my heart towards you , John Hammond . '
147550	147553	147554	147554	he	525	' Indeed ! '
147559	147659	147441	147441	she	524	' There was but one man in this world I ever fondly loved the love of my youth my dearest and best , in the days when my heart was fresh and innocent and unambitious . That man was Ronald Hollister , afterwards Lord Hartfield . And yours is the only face that ever recalled his to my mind . It is but a vague likeness a look now and then ; but slight as that likeness is it has been enough to make my heart yearn towards you , as the heart of a mother to her son . '
147698	147722	147723	147723	he	526	' Dear Lady Maulevrier , think that it is the spirit of the dead which blesses you for your fidelity to old memories , '
148042	148075	148077	148078	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Lady Mary is going to be married to Mr. Hammond , by special licence , in this room , to - morrow afternoon , if it can be managed so soon , '
148080	148092	148094	148094	Steadman	478	' I am very glad to hear it , my lady , '
148103	148111	148113	148114	his mistress	1414	' Why are you so particularly glad ? '
148121	148181	148077	148078	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Because Lady Mary 's presence in this house is a source of danger to your arrangements . She is very energetic and enterprising very shrewd and well , she is a woman so I suppose there can be no harm in saying she is somewhat inquisitive . Things will be much safer here when Lady Mary is gone ! '
148182	148299	148336	148336	his	5089	' But she will not be gone she is not going away except for a very brief honeymoon . I can not possibly do without her . She has become necessary to my life , Steadman ; and there is so little left of that life now , that there is no need for me to sacrifice the last gleams of sunshine . The girl is very sweet , and loving , and true . I was not half fond enough of her in the past ; but she has made herself very dear to me of late . There are many things in this life , Steadman , which we only find out too late . '
148300	148325	148077	148078	Lady Maulevrier	524	' But , surely , my lady , Lady Mary will leave Fellside to go to a home of her own after her marriage . '
148326	148335	148336	148336	his	5089	' No , I tell you , Steadman , '
148346	148371	148336	148336	his	5089	' Lady Mary and her husband will make this house their home so long as I am here . It will not be long . '
148372	148388	148390	148390	Steadman	478	' God grant it may be very long before you cease to be mistress here , '
148406	148432	148402	148402	he	5089	' Pardon me , my lady , for the suggestion , but do you think it wise to have Mr. Hammond here as a resident ? '
148433	148447	148402	148402	he	5089	' Why should it not be wise ? Mr. Hammond is a gentleman . '
148448	148471	148402	148402	he	5089	' True , my lady ; but any accident , such as that which brought Lady Mary into the old garden - - '
148472	148485	148487	148488	Lady Maulevrier	524	' No such accident need occur it must not occur , Steadman , '
148512	148600	148494	148494	She	524	' There must have been gross carelessness that day carelessness on your part , or that stable door would never have been left open . The key ought to have been in your possession . It ought not to have been in the power of the stableman to open that door . As to Mr. Hammond 's presence at Fellside , I can not see any danger any reason why harm should come of it , more than of Lord Maulevrier 's presence here in the past . '
148601	148612	148614	148614	Steadman	478	' The two gentlemen are so different , my lady , '
148621	148691	148614	148614	Steadman	478	' His lordship is so light - hearted and careless , his mind taken up with his horses , guns , dogs , fishing , shooting , and all kinds of sport . He is not a gentleman to take much notice of anything out of his own line . But this Mr. Hammond is different a very thoughtful gentleman , an inquiring mind , as one would say . '
148692	148730	148494	148494	She	524	' Steadman , you are getting cowardly in your old age . The danger such a risk as you hint at , must be growing less and less every day . After forty years of security - - '
148731	148733	148735	148735	Steadman	478	' Security '
148746	148841	148735	148735	Steadman	478	' Say forty years during which I have felt myself upon the edge of a precipice every day and every hour . Security ! But perhaps you are right , my lady , I am growing old and nervous , a feebler man than I was a few years ago , feebler in body and mind . Let Mr. Hammond make his home here , if it pleases your ladyship to have him . So long as I am well and able to get about there can be no danger of anything awkward happening . '
148847	148870	148494	148494	She	524	' But you have no expectation of falling ill , I hope , Steadman ; you have no premonition of any malady ? '
148871	148926	148494	148494	She	524	' No , my lady , none except the malady of old age . I feel that I am not the man I once was , that is all . My brain is getting woolly , and my sight is clouded now and then . And if I were to fall ill suddenly - - '
148927	148957	148494	148494	She	524	' Oh , it would be terrible , it would be a dire calamity ! There is your wife , certainly , to look after things , but - - '
148958	148995	148494	148494	She	524	' My wife would do her best , my lady . She is a faithful creature , but she is not yes , without any unkindness I must say that Mrs. Steadman is not a genius ! '
148996	149017	149019	149020	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Oh , Steadman , you must not fail me ! I am horror - stricken at the mere idea , '
149022	149118	149019	149020	Lady Maulevrier	524	' After forty years great God ! it would be terrible . Lesbia , Mary , Maulevrier ! the great , malignant , babbling world outside these doors . I am hemmed round with perils . For God 's sake preserve your strength . Take care of your health . You are my strong rock . If you feel that there is anything amiss with you , or that your strength is failing , consult Mr. Horton neglect no precaution . The safety of this house , of the family honour , hangs upon you . '
149119	149129	149131	149131	Steadman	630	' Pray do not agitate yourself , my lady , '
149133	149167	149131	149131	Steadman	630	' I was wrong to trouble you with my fears . I shall not fail you , be sure . Although I am getting old , I shall hold out to the end . '
149168	149178	149180	149181	Lady Maulevrier	524	' The end can not be very far off , '
149185	149226	149180	149181	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I thought that forty years ago , my lady . But you are right the end must be near now . Yes , it must be near . And now , my lady , your orders about the wedding . '
149227	149386	149419	149419	He	989	' It will take place to - morrow , as I told you , in this room . You will go to the Vicar and ask him to officiate . His two daughters will no doubt consent to be Lady Mary 's bridesmaids . You will make the request in my name . Perhaps the Vicar will call this afternoon and talk matters over with me . Lady Mary and her husband will go to Cumberland for a brief honeymoon a week at most and then they will come back to Fellside . Tell Mrs. Power to prepare the east wing for them . She will make one of the rooms into a boudoir for Lady Mary ; and let everything be as bright and pretty as good taste can make it . She can telegraph to London for any new furniture that may be wanted to complete her arrangements . And now send Lady Mary to me . '
149458	149471	149473	149473	Mary	445	' It is more wonderful than any dream that I ever dreamt . '
149475	149490	149473	149473	Mary	445	' But how can it be ? I have not even a wedding gown . '
149491	149601	149419	149419	He	989	' A fig for wedding gowns ! It is Mary I am to we d , not her gown . Were you clad like patient Grisel I should be content . Besides you have no end of pretty gowns . And you are to be dressed for travelling , remember ; for I am going to carry you off to Lodore directly we are married , and you will have to clamber up the rocky bed of the waterfall to see the sun set behind the Borrowdale hills in your wedding gown . It had better be one of those neat little tailor gowns which become you so well . '
149602	149611	149613	149613	Mary	445	' I will wear whatever you tell me , '
149615	149630	149613	149613	Mary	445	' I shall always dress to please you , and not the outside world . '
149631	149646	149419	149419	He	989	' Will you , my Griselda . Some day you shall be dressed as Grisel was
149667	149698	149700	149700	Mary	445	' Yes , you darling , when you are Lord Chancellor ; and till that day comes I will wear tailor gowns , linsey - wolsey , anything you like , '
149745	149763	149765	149766	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Mary , I am going to send you off upon your honeymoon to - morrow afternoon , '
149781	149798	149765	149766	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Will you come back and nurse a fretful old woman when the honeymoon is over ? '
149799	149807	149809	149809	Mary	445	' The honeymoon will never be over , '
149813	149861	149809	149809	Mary	445	' Our wedded life is to be one long honeymoon . But I will come back in a very few days , and take care of you . I am not going to let you do without me , now that you have learnt to love me . '
149862	149880	149925	149926	Lady Maulevrier	524	' And will you be content to stay with me when your husband has gone to London ? '
149881	149924	149809	149809	Mary	445	' Yes , but I shall try to prevent his going very often , or staying very long . I shall try to wind myself into his heart , so that there will be an aching void there when we are parted . '
149999	150026	150028	150029	Lady Maulevrier	524	' And if your husband really means to devote himself to literature , he can have no better workshop than the library I have put together , '
150031	150061	150087	150088	Lady Maulevrier	524	' And no better adviser and guide than you , dear grandmother , you who have read everything that has been written worth reading during the last half century . '
150062	150085	150087	150088	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I have read a great deal , Mary , but I hardly know if I am any wiser on that account , '
150090	150201	150087	150088	Lady Maulevrier	524	' After all , however much of other people 's wisdom we may devour , it is in ourselves that we are thus , or thus . Our past follies rise up against us at the end of life ; and we see how little our book - learning has helped us to stand against foolish impulses , against evil passions . " Be good , " Mary , " and let who will be wise , " as the poet says . A faithful heart is your only anchor in the stormy seas of life . My dear , I am so glad you are going to be married . '
150202	150208	150210	150210	Mary	445	' It is very sudden , '
150212	150240	150087	150088	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Very sudden ; yet in your case that does not much matter . You have quite made up your mind about Mr. Hammond , I believe . '
150241	150259	150087	150088	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Made up my mind ! I began to worship him the first night he came here . '
150260	150311	150087	150088	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Foolish child . Well , there is no need to wait for settlements . You have only your allowance as Lord Maulevrier 's daughter a first charge on the estate , which can not be made away with or anticipated , and of which no husband can deprive you . '
150312	150321	150323	150323	Mary	445	' He shall have every sixpence of it , '
150325	150360	150323	150323	Mary	445	' And Mr. Hammond , though he tells me he is better off than I supposed , can have nothing to settle . So there will be nothing forfeited by a marriage without settlements . '
150386	150404	150406	150407	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Steadman 's dogcart is to take Mr. Hammond to the station at half - past two , '
150409	150421	150406	150407	Lady Maulevrier	524	' so you had better go and give him his luncheon . '
150448	150457	150459	150460	the sailor	5111	' mounched , and mounched , and mounched , '
150546	150555	150557	150557	Mary	445	' You have had absolutely nothing to eat , '
150572	150610	150557	150557	Mary	445	' Oh , I have done splendidly thanks . I have just had a macaroon and some of that capital gorgonzola . God bless you , dearest , and a revoir , a revoir to - morrow . '
150611	150622	150624	150624	Mary	445	' And to - morrow I shall be Mary Hammond , '
150630	150637	150624	150624	Mary	445	' Is n't it capital fun ? '
150723	150730	150731	150731	Mary	445	' Life is full of partings , '
150754	150767	150731	150731	Mary	445	' but this one is to be very short , thank God . '
150822	150837	150839	150843	one of her humble friends	5128	' You 'll be away a long time , I suppose , Lady Mary ? '
150845	150871	150839	150843	one of her humble friends	5128	' you 'll be going to Switzerland or Italy , or some of those foreign parts where great ladies and gentlemen travel for their honeymoons ? '
151075	151140	151063	151063	herself	543	' I shall go back to Germany directly I leave you , and I shall live and die there , unless I am wanted by one of my old pupils . But should Lady Lesbia or Lady Mary need my services for their daughters , in days to come , they can command me . For no one else will I abandon the Fatherland . '
151251	151266	151267	151267	she	524	' I do n't know what Lesbia is going to do with her life , '
151274	151347	151267	151267	she	524	' Her letters tell me of nothing but gowns and parties ; and Georgina Kirkbank can only expatiate upon Mr. Smithson 's wealth , and the grand position he is going to occupy by - and - by . I should like to see both my granddaughters married before I die yes , I should like to see Lesbia 's fate secure , if she were to be only Lady Lesbia Smithson . '
151348	151361	151363	151363	Mary	445	' She can not fail to make a good match , grandmother , '
151365	151376	151378	151379	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I am beginning to lose faith in her future , '
151381	151517	151378	151379	Lady Maulevrier	524	' There seems to be a fatality about the career of particularly attractive girls . They are too confident of their power to succeed in life . They trifle with fortune , fascinate the wrong people , and keep the right people at arm 's length . I think if I had been Lesbia 's guide in society her first season would have counted for more than it is likely to count for under Lady Kirkbank 's management . I should have awakened Lesbia from the dream of dress and dancing the mere butterfly life of a girl who never looks beyond the present moment . But now go and give orders about your packing , Mary . It is past ten , and Clara had better pack your trunks early to - morrow morning . '
151684	151698	151700	151701	the damsel	2114	' You should have seen the things Miss Freeman had , Lady Mary , '
151703	151857	151700	151701	the damsel	2114	' the daughter of that cotton - spinning gentleman from Manchester , who lives at The Gables you should have seen her new gowns and things when she was married . Mrs. Freeman 's maid keeps company with my brother James he 's in the stables at Freeman 's , you know , Lady Mary and she asked me in to look at the trousseau two days before the wedding . I never saw such beautiful dresses such hats such bonnets such jackets and mantles . It was like going into one of those grand shops at York , and having all the things in the shop pulled out for one to look at such silks and satins and trimmed ah ! how those dresses was trimmed . The mystery was how the young lady could ever get herself into them , or sit down when she 'd got one of them on . '
151858	151889	151700	151701	the damsel	2114	' Instruments of torture , Clara . I should hate such gowns , even if I were going to marry a rich man , as I suppose Miss Freeman was . '
151890	151954	151700	151701	the damsel	2114	' Not a bit of it , Lady Mary . She was only going to marry a Bolton doctor with a small practice ; but her maid told me she was determined she 'd get all she could out of her pa , in case he should lose all his money and go bankrupt . They said that trousseau cost two thousand pounds . '
151955	151983	151700	151701	the damsel	2114	' Well , Clara , I 'd rather have my tailor gowns , in which I can scramble about the ghylls and crags just as I like . '
152322	152336	152338	152338	Clara	816	' He did ought to have sent you his photograph , Lady Mary , '
152345	152367	152435	152435	he	2454	' I daresay he would have done so , Clara , but he has been photographed only once in his life . '
152368	152421	152435	152435	he	2454	' Lawk a mercy , Lady Mary ! Why most young gentlemen have themselves photographed in every new place they go to ; and as Mr. Hammond has been a traveller , like his lordship , I made sure he 'd have been photographed in knickerbockers and every other kind of attitude . '
152468	152489	152490	152490	he	2454	' The present fashion of photographs staring out of every stationer 's window makes a man 's face public property , '
152494	152508	152490	152490	he	2454	' I do n't want every street Arab in London to recognise me . '
152509	152518	152520	152520	Mary	445	' But you are not a public man , '
152522	152547	152520	152520	Mary	445	' Your photograph would not be in all the windows ; although , in my humble opinion , you are a very handsome man . '
152570	152586	152587	152587	he	2454	' Millais shall paint me in his grand Reynolds manner by - and - by , '
152591	152615	152548	152548	Hammond	445	' Millais ! Oh , Jack ! When will you and I be able to give a thousand or so for a portrait ? '
152616	152644	152587	152587	he	2454	' Ah , when , indeed ? But we may as well enjoy our day - dreams , like Alnaschar , without smashing our basket of crockery . '
152809	152861	152802	152803	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Everything is arranged , Mary . I have had a telegram from Hammond , who has got the licence , and will come at half - past one . At three the Vicar will come to marry you , his daughters , Katie and Laura , acting as your bridesmaids . '
152862	152865	152867	152867	Mary	445	' Bridesmaids ! '
152869	152883	152867	152867	Mary	445	' I forgot all about bridesmaids . Am I really to have any ? '
152884	152945	152802	152803	Lady Maulevrier	524	' You will have two girls of your own age to bear you company , at any rate . I have asked dear old Horton to be present ; and he , Fršulein , and Maulevrier will complete the party . It will not be a brilliant wedding , Mary , or a costly ceremonial , except for the licence . '
152946	152957	152959	152959	Mary	445	' And poor Jack will have to pay for that , '
152966	152977	152979	152980	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Poor Jack refused to let me pay for it , '
152982	152994	152979	152980	Lady Maulevrier	524	' He is vastly independent , and I fear somewhat reckless . '
152995	153010	153012	153012	Mary	445	' I like him for his independence ; but he must n't be reckless , '
153363	153368	153370	153370	Hammond	445	' Dear Lady Maulevrier , '
153372	153436	153370	153370	Hammond	445	' I ventured to telegraph to my lawyer to meet me at York last night , and come on here with me this morning . He has prepared a settlement , which I should like you to hear him read , and which he will explain to you , if necessary , while Molly and I go for a stroll in the grounds . '
153524	153531	153533	153533	Mary	445	' Do you remember that day ? '
153541	153560	153562	153562	Hammond	526	' I remember every day and every hour we have spent together since I began to love you , '
153564	153577	153579	153579	Mary	445	' Ah , but this was before you began to love me , '
153587	153692	153579	153579	Mary	445	' This was while you were loving Lesbia as hard as ever you could . Do n't you remember the day you proposed to her a lovely summer day like this , the lake just as blue , the sun shining upon Fairfield just as it is shining now , and you sat there reading Heine those sweet , sweet verses , that seemed made of sighs and tears ; and every now and then you paused and looked up at Lesbia , and there was more love in your eyes than in all Heine 's poetry , though that brims over with love . '
153693	153709	153562	153562	Hammond	526	' But how did you know all this , Molly ? You were not here . '
153710	153786	153579	153579	Mary	445	' I was not very far off . I was behind those bushes , watching and listening . I knew you were in love with Lesbia , and I thought you despised me , and I was very , very wretched ; and I listened afterwards when you proposed to her there behind the pine trees and I hated her for refusing you , and I am afraid I hated you for proposing to her . '
153787	153805	153807	153807	Hammond	526	' When I ought to have been proposing to my Molly , blind fool that I was , '
153824	153923	153807	153807	Hammond	526	' My own sweet love , it was a terrible mistake , a mistake that might have cost me the happiness of a lifetime . But Fate was very good to me , and let me have my Mary after all . And now let us sit down under the old red beech and talk till it is time to go and get ready for our wedding . I suppose one ought to brush one 's hair and wash one 's hands for that kind of thing , even when the function is not on a ceremonious scale . '
153927	153948	153949	153949	she	445	' I have a prettier gown than this to be married in , although it is n't a wedding gown , '
153952	153967	154003	154003	He	2454	' Oh , by - the - by , I have something for you , '
153972	154002	154003	154003	He	2454	' something in the way of ornaments , but I do n't suppose you 'd care to wear them to - day . I 'll run and get them . '
154066	154068	154091	154091	he	2454	' clerks .
154069	154086	154087	154087	he	2454	' I do n't think I have given you anything since we were engaged , Mary , '
154114	154121	154122	154122	she	445	' You gave me my ring , '
154134	154146	154122	154122	she	445	' and you have given me ever so many delightful books . '
154147	154168	154169	154169	He	2454	' Those were very humble gifts , Molly : but to - day I have brought you a wedding present . '
154222	154231	154242	154242	he	2454	' shops for the last quarter of a century .
154232	154241	154242	154242	he	2454	' There is my wedding gift , Mary , '
154272	154283	154284	154284	he	2454	' You have asked me for my portrait , dearest , '
154287	154396	154284	154284	he	2454	' I give you my mother 's rather than my own , because I loved her as I never thought to love again , till I knew you . I should like you to wear that locket sometimes , Mary , as a kind of link between the love of the past and the love of the present . Were my mother living , she would welcome and cherish my bride and my wife . She is dead , and you and she can never meet on earth : but I should like you to be familiar with the face which was once the light of my life . '
154435	154447	154448	154448	she	445	' I shall treasure this picture always , above all things , '
154452	154479	154448	154448	she	445	' why did you have it set so splendidly , Jack ? No gems were needed to give your mother 's portrait value in my eyes . '
154480	154538	154539	154539	He	5209	' I know that , dearest , but I wanted to make the locket worth wearing . And now for the other cases . The locket is your lover 's free gift , and is yours to keep and to bequeath to your children . These are heirlooms , and yours only during your husband 's lifetime . '
154591	154597	154599	154599	Mary	445	' What are they for ? '
154601	154608	154599	154599	Mary	445	' For my wife to wear . '
154609	154620	154621	154621	she	445	' Oh , but I could never wear such things , '
154634	154656	154621	154621	she	445	' They are paste , of course very beautiful for people who like that kind of thing but I do n't . '
154693	154817	154599	154599	Mary	445	' No , Molly , they are not paste ; they are Brazilian diamonds , and , as Maulevrier would say , they are as good as they make them . They are heirlooms , Molly . My dear mother wore them in her summer - tide of wedded happiness . My grandmother wore them for thirty years before her ; my great grandmother wore them at the Court of Queen Charlotte , and they were worn at the Court of Queen Anne . They are nearly two hundred years old ; and those central stones in the tiara came out of a cap worn by the Great Mogul , and are the largest table diamonds known . They are historic , Mary . '
154818	154828	154924	154924	Mary	445	' Why , they must be worth a fortune . '
154829	154840	154599	154599	Mary	445	' They are valued at something over seventy thousand pounds . '
154841	154850	154852	154852	Mary	445	' But why do n't you sell them ? '
154861	154870	154852	154852	Mary	445	' they would give you a handsome income . '
154871	154902	154599	154599	Mary	445	' They are not mine to sell , Molly . Did not I tell you that they are heirlooms ? They are the family jewels of the Countesses of Hartfield . '
154903	154909	154852	154852	Mary	445	' Then what are you ? '
154910	154923	154599	154599	Mary	445	' Ronald Hollister , Earl of Hartfield , and your adoring lover ! '
154937	154945	154946	154946	she	445	' Oh , that is too dreadful ! '
154949	154975	154946	154946	she	445	' grandmother will be so unhappy . She had set her heart upon Lesbia marrying Lord Hartfield , the son of the man she loved . '
154976	154989	154991	154991	Hartfield	443	' I got wind of her wish more than a year ago , '
154993	155238	154991	154991	Hartfield	443	' from your brother ; and he and I hatched a little plot between us . He told me Lesbia was not worthy of his friend 's devotion told me that she was vain and ambitious that she had been educated to be so . I determined to come and try my fate . I would try to win her as plain John Hammond . If she was a true woman , I told myself , vanity and ambition would be blown to the four winds , provided I could win her love . I came , I saw her ; and to see was to love her . God knows I tried honestly to win her ; but I had sworn to myself that I would woo her as John Hammond , and I did not waver in my resolution no , not when a word would have turned the scale . She liked me , I think , a little ; but she did not like the notion of an obscure life as the wife of a hardworking professional man . The pomps and vanities of this world had it against love or liking , and she gave me up . I thank God that the pomps and vanities prevailed ; for this happy chance gave me Mary , my sweet Wordsworthian damsel , found , like the violet or the celandine , by the wayside , in Wordsworth 's own country . '
155239	155246	155248	155248	Mary	445	' And you are Lord Hartfield ! '
155269	155292	155248	155248	Mary	445	' I always knew you were a great man . But poor grandmother ! It will be a dreadful disappointment to her . '
155293	155377	154991	154991	Hartfield	443	' I think not . I think she has learned my Molly 's value ; rather late , as I learned it ; and I believe she will be glad that one of her granddaughters should marry the son of her first lover . Let us go to her , love , and see if she is reconciled to the idea , and whether the settlement is ready for execution . Dorncliffe and his clerk were working at it half through the night . '
155378	155387	155389	155389	Mary	445	' What is the good of a settlement ? '
155391	155393	154991	154991	Hartfield	443	' I 'm

155442	155475	155395	155395	I	0	' But I would rather be dependent on your pleasure . I shall never have any milliner 's bills ; and I am sure you would never deny me money for charity . '
155476	155519	155395	155395	I	0	' You shall not have to ask me for it , except when you have exceeded your pin - money . I hope you will do that now and then , just to afford me the pleasure of doing you a favour . '

155537	155558	155525	155525	Mary	445	' shall I have to call you Hartfield ? I do n't like the name nearly so well as Jack . '
155559	155571	155573	155573	Hartfield	824	' You shall call me Jack for old sake 's sake , '
155577	155589	155525	155525	Mary	445	' How did you think of such a name as Jack ? '
155590	155653	155525	155525	Mary	445	' Rather an effort of genius , was n't it . Well , first and foremost I was christened Ronald John all the Hollisters are christened John name of the founder of the race ; and , secondly , Maulevrier and I were always plain Mr. Morland and Mr. Hammond in our travels , and always called each other Jack and Jim . '
155654	155658	155660	155660	Mary	445	' How nice ! '
155662	155684	155660	155660	Mary	445	' would you very much mind our being plain Mr. and Mrs. Hammond , while we are on our honeymoon trip ? '
155685	155694	155525	155525	Mary	445	' I should like it of all things . '
155695	155723	155660	155660	Mary	445	' So should I. People will not take so much notice of us , and we can do what we like , and go where we like . '
155724	155746	155525	155525	Mary	445	' Delightful ! We 'll even disguise ourselves as Cook 's tourists , if you like . I would not mind . '
155772	155790	155792	155793	her ladyship	951	' Let me look at the Countess of Hartfield that is to be in half an hour , '
155795	155840	155792	155793	her ladyship	951	' Oh , Mary , Mary , what a blind idiot I have been , and what a lucky girl you are ! I told you once that you were wiser than Lesbia , but I little thought how much wiser you had been . '
155844	155857	155660	155660	Mary	445	' OUR LOVE WAS NEW , AND THEN BUT IN THE SPRING . '
156150	156171	156173	156174	Mr. Smithson	726	' When we are in Italy I will have her modelled , just in that attitude , and that dress , '
156176	156291	156173	156174	Mr. Smithson	726	' She will make a lovely companion for my Reading Girl : one all repose and reverie , the other all life and action . Dear Lady Kirkbank , you really must stay for another week at least . Why go back to the smoke and sultriness of town ? Here we can almost live on the water ; and I will send to London for some people to make music for us in the evenings , or if you miss your little game at " Nap , " we will play for an hour or so every night . It shall not be my fault if my house is not pleasant for you . '
156292	156326	156328	156328	Georgie	597	' Your house is charming , and I shall be here only too often in the days to come ; you will have more than enough of me then , I promise you , '
156335	156415	156328	156328	Georgie	597	' but we must not stop a day longer now . People would begin to talk . Besides , we have engagements for every hour of the week that is coming , and for a fortnight after ; and then I suppose I ought to take Lesbia to the North to see her grandmother , and to discuss all the preparations and arrangements for this very serious event in which you and Lesbia are to be the chief performers . '
156416	156442	156444	156445	Mr. Smithson	726	' I shall be very glad to go to Grasmere myself , and to make the acquaintance of my future grandmother - in - law , '
156447	156561	156444	156445	Mr. Smithson	726	' You will be charmed with her . She belongs to the old school something of a fossil , perhaps , but a very dignified fossil . She has grown old in a rustic seclusion , and knows less of our world than a mother abbess ; but she has read immensely , and is wonderfully clever . I am bound to tell you that she has very lofty ideas about her granddaughter ; and I believe she will only be reconciled to Lesbia 's marriage with a commoner by the notion that you are sure of a peerage . I ventured to hint as much in my letter to Lady Maulevrier yesterday . '
156573	156605	156606	156606	he	605	' I should hope that such settlements as I am in a position to make will convince Lady Maulevrier that I am a respectable suitor for her granddaughter , ex peerage , '
156612	156633	156635	156636	Lady Kirkbank	585	' My dear Smithson , did I not tell you that poor Lady Maulevrier is a century behind the times , '
156643	156770	156635	156636	Lady Kirkbank	585	' If she were one of us , of course she would know that wealth is the paramount consideration , and that you are quite the best match of the season . But she is dreadfully arriťrťe , poor dear thing ; and she must have amused herself with the day - dream of seeing Lesbia a duchess , or something of that kind . I shall tell her that Lesbia can be one of the queens of society without having strawberry leaves on her coach panels , and that my dear friend Horace Smithson is a much better match than a seedy duke . So do n't look cross , my dear fellow ; in me you have a friend who will never desert you . '
156771	156774	156776	156776	Smithson	605	' Thanks , '
156917	156995	156908	156908	she	499	' Garden , alone ? for happily Mr. Smithson was not so early a riser as the Grasmere - bred damsel , and she had this fresh morning hour to herself . Of what was she thinking as she paced slowly up and down the broad gravel walk , between two rows of tall old bushes , on which masses of purple blossom stood up from the pale grey foliage , silvery where the summer breeze touched it ?
157477	157487	157488	157488	she	499	' I suppose I always meant to marry him , '
157529	157597	157526	157527	Mr. Smithson	726	' Yes , I must have meant to give way at last , or I should hardly have tolerated his attentions . It would have been a pity to refuse such a place as this ; and , he is quite gentlemanlike ; and as I have done with all romantic ideas , I do not see why I should not learn to like him very much . '
157632	157641	157642	157642	she	499	' I hardly know whether I like it , '
157646	157808	157642	157642	she	499	' beautiful as it is , it is only a reproduction of bygone splendour , and it is painfully excruciating now . For my own part I would much rather have the shabbiest old house which had belonged to one 's ancestors , which had come to one as a heritage , by divine right as it were , instead of being bought with newly made money . To my mind it would rank higher . Yet I doubt if anybody nowadays sets a pin 's value upon ancestors . People ask , Who is he ? but they only mean , How much has he ? And provided a person is not absolutely in trade , not actually engaged in selling soap , or matches , or mustard , society does n't care a straw how his money has been made . The only secondary question is , How long will it last ? And that is of course important . '
157941	157954	157955	157955	he	2454	' My dearest , how lovely you look in this morning light , '
157958	157995	157955	157955	he	2454	' while all the other women are upstairs making up their faces to meet the sun , and we shall see every shade of bismuth by - and - by , from pale mauve to purple . '
157996	158012	158014	158014	Lesbia	726	' It is very uncivil of you to say such a thing of your guests , '
158016	158107	157955	157955	he	2454	' But they all indulge in bismuth you must be quite aware of that . They call the stuff by different names Blanc Rosati , Creme de l'Imperatrice , Milk of Beauty , Perline , Opaline , Ivorine but it means bismuth all the same . Expose your fashionable beauty to the fumes of sewer - gas , and that dazzling whiteness would turn to a dull brown hue , or even black . Thank heaven , my Lesbia wears real lilies and roses . Have you been here long ? '
158108	158113	157955	157955	he	2454	' About half an hour '
158114	158133	157955	157955	he	2454	' I only wish I had known . I should not have dawdled so long over my dressing . '
158134	158144	158145	158145	Lesbia	726	' I am very glad you did not know , '
158149	158194	158145	158145	Lesbia	726	' Do you suppose I never want to be alone ? Life in London is perpetual turmoil ; one 's eyes grow weary with ever - moving crowds , one 's ears ache with trying to distinguish one voice among the buzz of voices . '
158195	158250	158252	158252	Smithson	726	' Then why go back to town ? Why go back to the turmoil and the treadmill ? It is only a kind of treadmill , after all , though we choose to call it pleasure . Stay here , Lesbia , and let us live upon the river , and among the flowers , '
158360	158370	158355	158358	the stock - jobber	5275	' He who has once drunk will drink again . '
158379	158389	158390	158390	he	726	' Stay and hear the last of the nightingales , '
158393	158401	158390	158390	he	726	' we are famous for our nightingales . '
158402	158423	158711	158711	Lesbia	726	' I wonder you do n't order a fricassťe of their tongues , like that loathsome person in Roman history . '
158424	158441	158390	158390	he	726	' I hope I shall never resemble any loathsome person . Why can you not stay ? '
158442	158455	158711	158711	Lesbia	726	' Why , because it is not etiquette , Lady Kirkbank says . '
158456	158473	158390	158390	he	726	' Lady Kirkbank , eh ? la belle farce , Lady Kirkbank standing out for etiquette . '
158474	158503	158711	158711	Lesbia	726	' Do n't laugh at my chaperon , sir . Upon what rock can a poor girl lean if you undermine her faith in her chaperon , sir . '
158504	158557	158390	158390	he	726	' I hope you will have a better guardian before you are a month older . I mean to be a very strong rock , Lesbia . You do not know how firmly I shall stand between you and all the perils of society . You have been but poorly guarded hitherto . '
158558	158571	158573	158573	Lesbia	726	' You talk as if you mean to be an abominable tyrant , '
158575	158593	158573	158573	Lesbia	726	' If you do n't take care I shall change my mind , and recall my promise . '
158594	158651	158390	158390	he	726	' Not on that account , Lesbia : every woman likes a man who stands up for his own . It is only your invertebrate husband whose wife drifts into the divorce court . I mean to keep and hold the prize I have won . When is it to be , dearest our wedding day ? '
158652	158668	158573	158573	Lesbia	726	' Not for ages , I hope some time next summer , at the earliest . '
158669	158684	158390	158390	he	726	' You would not be so cruel as to keep me waiting a year ? '
158685	158689	158573	158573	Lesbia	726	' Why not ? '
158690	158701	158390	158390	he	726	' You would not ask that if you loved me . '
158702	158709	158711	158711	Lesbia	726	' You are asking too much , '
158719	158753	158711	158711	Lesbia	726	' There has been nothing said about love yet . You asked me to be your wife , and I said yes meaning that at some remote period such a thing might be . '
158791	158801	158802	158802	he	1325	' Did not that promise imply something like love ? '
158807	158882	158757	158758	the man	1325	' Perhaps it implied a little gratitude for your devotion , which I have neither courted nor encouraged ; a little respect for your talents , your perseverance a little admiration for your wonderful success in life . Perhaps love may follow these sentiments , naturally , easily , if you are very patient ; but if you talk about our being married before next year , you will simply make me hate you . '
158883	158934	158760	158765	her slave slave to her beauty	5278	' Then I will say very little , except to remind you that there is no earthly reason why we should not be married next month . October and November are the best months for Rome , and I heard you say last night you were pining to see Rome . '
158935	158947	158757	158758	the man	1325	' What then can not Lady Kirkbank take me to Rome ? '
158948	158960	158962	158963	Mr. Smithson	726	' And introduce you to the rowdiest people in the city , '
158965	159021	158962	158963	Mr. Smithson	726	' Lesbia , I adore you . It is the dream of my life to be your husband ; but if you are going to spend a winter in Italy with Lady Kirkbank , I renounce my right , I surrender my hope . You will not be the wife of my dreams after that . '
159022	159036	158757	158758	the man	1325	' Do you assert a right to control my life during our engagement ? '
159037	159108	158962	158963	Mr. Smithson	726	' Some little right ; above all , the privilege of choosing your friends . And that is one reason why I most fervently desire our marriage should not be delayed . You would find it difficult , impossible perhaps , to get out of Lady Kirkbank 's claws while you are single ; but once my wife , that amiable old person can be made to keep her distance . '
159109	159134	158757	158758	the man	1325	' Lady Kirkbank 's claws ! What a horrible way in which to speak of a friend . I thought you adored Lady Kirkbank . '
159135	159206	158962	158963	Mr. Smithson	726	' So I do . We all adore her , but not as a guide for youth . As a specimen of the elderly female of the latter half of the nineteenth century , she is perfect . Such gush , such juvenility , such broad views , such an utter absence of starch ; but as a lamp for the footsteps of girlhood no , there we must pause . '
159207	159228	158757	158758	the man	1325	' You are very ungrateful . Do you know that poor Lady Kirkbank has been most strenuous in your behalf ? '
159229	159238	158962	158963	Mr. Smithson	726	' Oh , yes , I know that . '
159239	159246	158757	158758	the man	1325	' And you are not grateful ? '
159247	159264	158962	158963	Mr. Smithson	726	' I intend to be very grateful , so grateful as to entirely satisfy Lady Kirkbank . '
159265	159302	158757	158758	the man	1325	' You are horribly cynical . That reminds me , there was a poor girl whom Lady Kirkbank had under her wing one season a Miss Trinder , to whom I am told you behaved shamefully . '
159303	159426	158962	158963	Mr. Smithson	726	' There was a parson 's daughter who threw herself at my head in a most audacious way , and who behaved so badly , egged on by Lady Kirkbank , that I had to take refuge in flight . Do you suppose I am the kind of man to marry the first adventurous damsel who takes a fancy to my town house , and thinks it would be a happy hunting ground for a herd of brothers and sisters ? Miss Trinder was shocking bad style , and her designs were transparent from the very beginning ! I let her flirt as much as she liked ; and when she began to be seriously sentimental I took wing for the East . '
159427	159432	159434	159434	Lesbia	726	' Was she pretty ? '
159450	159533	158962	158963	Mr. Smithson	726	' If you admire the Flemish type , as illustrated by Rubens , she was lovely . A complexion of lilies and roses cabbage roses , bien entendu , which were apt to deepen into peonies after champagne and mayonaise at Ascot or Sandown a figure oh well a tremendous figure hair of an auburn that touched perilously on the confines of red large , serviceable feet , and an appetite the appetite of a ploughman 's daughter reared upon short commons . '
159534	159547	159640	159640	She	5285	' You are very cruel to a girl who evidently admired you . '
159548	159567	158962	158963	Mr. Smithson	726	' A fig for her admiration ! She wanted to live in my house and spend my money . '
159568	159574	159576	159576	Lesbia	726	' There goes the gong , '
159578	159599	159576	159576	Lesbia	726	' pray let us go to breakfast . You are hideously cynical , and I am wofully tired of you . '
159655	159665	159640	159640	She	5285	' ALL FANCY , PRIDE , AND FICKLE MAIDENHOOD . '
160703	160710	160715	160716	Georgie Kirkbank	597	' It will be simple enchantment , '
160718	160792	160715	160716	Georgie Kirkbank	597	' There is nothing so rapturous as life on board a yacht ; there is a flavour of adventure , a sansgene , a in short everything in the world that I like . I shall wear my cotton frocks , and give myself up to enjoyment , lie on the deck and look up at the blue sky , too deliciously idle even to read the last horrid thing of Zola 's . '
160847	160865	160867	160868	one lounger	5336	' It 's as settled a business as the entries and bets for next year 's Derby , '
160881	160891	160867	160868	one lounger	5336	' Play or pay , do n't you know . '
161090	161098	161099	161099	she	5339	' Smithson is a most difficult person , '
161102	161198	161099	161099	she	5339	' The least error of taste on your dear girl 's part would have froissťd him . Men with that immense wealth are always suspicious , ready to imagine mercenary motives , on their guard against being trapped . But Lesbia had me at her back , and she managed him perfectly . He is positively her slave ; and you will be able to twist him round your little finger in the matter of settlements . You may do what you like with him , for the ground has been thoroughly prepared by me . '
161322	161330	161332	161333	Lady Maulevrier	524	' But it is not the first , '
161335	161511	161332	161333	Lady Maulevrier	524	' My pride has received crushing blows in days past , and I ought to be humbled to the dust . But there is a stubborn resistance in some natures which stands firm against every shock . You and Lesbia will both be surprised to hear that Mary , from whom I expected so little , has made a really great match . She was married yesterday afternoon in my morning room , by special licence , to the Earl of Hartfield , the lover of her choice , whom we at Fellside have all known as plain John Hammond . He is an admirable young man , and sure to make a great figure in the world , as no doubt you know better than I do , for you are in the way of hearing all about him . His courtship of Mary is quite an idyll ; and the happy issue of this romantic love - affair has cheered and comforted me more than anything that has happened since Lesbia left me . '
161591	161600	161602	161603	Lady Kirkbank	585	' A strange mystification , was n't it ? '
161636	161650	161652	161652	Lesbia	726	' Strange mystification ! It was base treachery a vile and wicked lie ! '
161656	161772	161652	161652	Lesbia	726	' What right had he to come to us under false colours , to pretend to be poor , a nobody with only the vaguest hope of making a decent position in the future ? and to offer himself under such impossible conditions to a girl brought up as I had been a girl educated by one of the proudest and most ambitious of women to force me to renounce everything except him ? How could he suppose that any girl , so placed , could decide in his favour ? If he had loved me he would have told me the truth he would not have made it impossible for me to accept him . '
161773	161785	161787	161788	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I believe he is a very high flown young man , '
161792	161877	161787	161788	Lady Kirkbank	585	' he was never in my set , you know , dear . And I suppose he had some old Minerva - press idea that he would find a girl who would marry him for his own sake . And your sister , no doubt , eager to marry anybody , poor child , for the sake of getting away from that very lovely dungeon of Lady Maulevrier 's , snapped at the chance ; and by a mere fluke she becomes a countess . '
162005	162009	162010	162010	she	5351	' Loved me ! '
162013	162148	162010	162010	she	5351	' he never loved me . If he had he would have told me the truth . What , when I was in his arms , my head upon his breast , my whole being surrendered to him , adoring him , what more could he want ? He must have known that this meant real love . And why should he put it upon me to fight so hard a fight to brave my grandmother 's anger to be cursed by her to face poverty for his sake ? I never professed to be a heroine . He knew that I was a woman , with all a woman 's weakness , a woman 's fear of trial and difficulty in the future . It was a cowardly thing to use me so . '
162149	162153	162155	162156	Lady Kirkbank	585	' It was , '
162164	162191	162155	162156	Lady Kirkbank	585	' but if you liked this Hammond - Hartfield creature a little in those old days , I know you have outlived that liking long ago . '
162192	162219	162221	162221	Lesbia	726	' Of course ; but it is a hard thing to know one has been fooled , cheated , weighed in the balance and found wanting , '
162254	162263	162265	162265	Georgie	597	' It was a caddish thing to do , '
162267	162337	162265	162265	Georgie	597	' and this Hartfield is just what I always thought him an insufferable prig . However , my sweetest girl , there is really nothing to lament in the matter . Your sister has made a good alliance , which will score high in your favour by - and - by , and you are going to marry a man who is three times as rich as Lord Hartfield . '
162338	162393	162155	162156	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Rich , yes ; and nothing but rich ; while Lord Hartfield is a man of the very highest standing , belongs to the flower of English nobility . Rich , yes ; Mr. Smithson is rich ; but , as Lady Maulevrier says , he has made his money heaven knows how . '
162394	162406	162408	162409	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Mr. Smithson has not made his money heaven knows how , '
162413	162529	162408	162409	Lady Kirkbank	585	' He has made it in cochineal , in iron , in gunpowder , in coal , in all kinds of commodities . Everybody in the City knows how he has made his money , and that he has a genius for turning everything into gold . If the gold changes back into one of the baser metals , it is only when Mr. Smithson has made all he wanted to make . And now he has quite done with the City . The House is the only business of his life ; and he is becoming a power in the House . You have every reason to be proud of your choice , Lesbia . '
162530	162540	162542	162542	Lesbia	726	' I will try to be proud of it , '
162546	162558	162542	162542	Lesbia	726	' I will not be scorned and trampled upon by Mary . '
162559	162568	162575	162575	she	585	' She seemed a harmless kind of girl , '
162583	162590	162592	162592	Lesbia	726	' She is a designing minx , '
162594	162608	162592	162592	Lesbia	726	' and has set her cap at that man from the very beginning . '
162609	162622	162542	162542	Lesbia	726	' But she could not have known that he was Lord Hartfield . '
162623	162639	162592	162592	Lesbia	726	' No ; but he was a man ; and that was enough for her . '
162764	162797	162801	162802	the damsel	2114	' Egad , if I saw myself in a fair way of being able to write cheques upon such an account as Smithson 's I should be as wild as Lady Lesbia , '
162810	162821	162801	162802	the damsel	2114	' And I believe the young lady was slightly dipped . '
162822	162828	162830	162831	his friend	7076	' Who told you that ? '
162833	162839	162841	162842	the youth	4360	' A mother of mine , '
162861	162909	162851	162851	he	4360	' Seraphine , the dressmaker , was complaining wanted to see the colour of Lady Lesbia Haselden 's money vulgar curiosity asked my old mother if she thought the account was safe , and so on . That 's how I came to know all about it . '
162910	162923	162972	162972	Lesbia	499	' Well , she 'll be able to pay Seraphine next season . '
163140	163147	163149	163150	the gossips	5378	' A man of stirling metal , '
163152	163167	163149	163150	the gossips	5378	' who can hold his own with many a fellow born in the purple . '
163226	163258	163259	163259	Lesbia	499	' On the 29th inst . , at Grasmere , by the Reverend Douglass Brooke , the Earl of Hartfield to Mary , younger daughter of the ninth Earl of Maulevrier . '
163378	163397	163398	163398	she	499	' Where have you been hiding yourself all this time , and why were you not at Henley ? '
163401	163408	163624	163624	Maulevrier	461	' I have been at Grasmere . '
163409	163444	163372	163372	Lesbia	499	' Oh , you were a witness of that most romantic marriage . The Lady of Lyons reversed , the gardener 's son turning out to be an earl . Was it excruciatingly funny ? '
163445	163458	163624	163624	Maulevrier	461	' It was one of the most solemn weddings I ever saw . '
163459	163473	163372	163372	Lesbia	499	' Solemn ! what , with my Tomboy sister as bride ! Impossible ! '
163474	163526	163624	163624	Maulevrier	461	' Your sister ceased to be a Tomboy when she fell in love . She is a sweet and womanly woman , and will make an adorable wife to the finest fellow I know . I hear I am to congratulate you , Lesbia , upon your engagement with Mr. Smithson . '
163527	163553	163372	163372	Lesbia	499	' If you think I am the person to be congratulated , you are at liberty to do so . My engagement is a fact . '
163554	163611	163624	163624	Maulevrier	461	' Oh , of course , Mr. Smithson is the winner . But as I hope you intend to be happy , I wish you joy . I am told Smithson is a really excellent fellow when one gets to know him ; and I shall make it my business to be better acquainted with him . '
163753	163763	163764	163764	she	998	' Of course they are stupid , my dear , '
163777	163822	163764	163764	she	998	' but I am always willing to know rich people . One drops in for so many good things ; and they never want any return in kind . It is quite enough for them to be allowed to spend their money upon us . '
164422	164428	164433	164435	the dark gentleman	5428	' Montesma is in Paris , '
164437	164448	164433	164435	the dark gentleman	5428	' I dined last week with him at the Continental . '
164488	164500	164449	164450	Mr. Smithson	726	' Indeed ! I thought he was played out years ago . '
164501	164567	164449	164450	Mr. Smithson	726	' A man of that kind is never played out . Don Gomez de Montesma is as clever as Satan , as handsome as Apollo , and he bears one of the oldest names in Castile . Such a man will always come to the front . C'est un rastaquouere mais rastaquouere de bon genre . You knew him intimately la bas , I believe ? '
164568	164581	164449	164450	Mr. Smithson	726	' In Cuba ; yes , we were pretty good friends once . '
164582	164593	164595	164596	Mr. Sampayo	840	' And were useful to each other , no doubt , '
164600	164614	164595	164596	Mr. Sampayo	840	' Was that Argentiferous Copper Company in sixty - four yours or his ? '
164615	164626	164449	164450	Mr. Smithson	726	' There were a good many people concerned in it . '
164627	164698	164595	164596	Mr. Sampayo	840	' No doubt ; it takes a good many people to work that kind of thing , but I fancy you and Montesma were about the only two who came out of it pleasantly . And he and you did a little in the shipping line , did n't you African produce ? However , that 's an old song . You have had so many good things since then . '
164699	164708	164449	164450	Mr. Smithson	726	' Did Montesma talk of coming to London ? '
164709	164772	164595	164596	Mr. Sampayo	840	' He did not talk about it ; but he would hardly go back to the tropics without having a look round on both sides of the Channel . He was always fond of society , pretty women , dancing , and amusements of all kinds . I have no doubt we shall see him here before the end of the season . '
165278	165287	165263	165299	that scion of an old Castilian race whom she had heard described the other evening ' clever as Satan , handsome as Apollo . ' Yes , this must be the man , Don Gomez de Montesma	5452	' clever as Satan , handsome as Apollo . '
165387	165394	165395	165395	she	585	' How perfectly you speak English ! '
165398	165409	165395	165395	she	585	' You must have lived in England a good deal . '
165410	165442	165501	165502	Lady Kirkbank	585	' On the contrary , it is my misfortune to have lived here very little , but I have known a good many English and Americans in Cuba and in Paris . '
165443	165498	165395	165395	she	585	' In Cuba ! Do you really come from Cuba ? I have always fancied that Cuba must be an altogether charming place to live in like Biarritz or Pau , do n't you know , only further away . Do please tell me where it is , and what kind of a place . '
165524	165532	165534	165536	the fervid creature	5458	' It must be a lovely spot ! '
165538	165564	165534	165536	the fervid creature	5458	' Let me see , now , what do we get from Cuba ? cigars and and tobacco . I suppose in Cuba everybody smokes ? '
165565	165573	165501	165502	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Men , women , and children . '
165574	165593	165534	165536	the fervid creature	5458	' How delicious ! Would that I were a Cuban ! And the natives , are they nice ? '
165594	165639	165501	165502	Lady Kirkbank	585	' There are no aborigines . The Indians whom Columbus found soon perished off the face of the island . European civilisation generally has that effect . But one of our most benevolent captain - generals provided us with an imported population of niggers . '
165640	165704	165706	165707	Lady Kirkbank	585	' How delightful . I have always longed to live among a slave population , dear submissive black things dressed in coral necklaces and feathers , instead of the horrid over - fed wretches we have to wait upon us . And if the aborigines were not wanted it was just as well for them to die out , do n't you know , '
165709	165749	165501	165502	Lady Kirkbank	585	' It was very accommodating of them , no doubt . Yet we could employ half a million of them , if we had them , in draining our swamps . Agriculture suffered by the loss of Indian labour . '
165750	165769	165771	165772	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I suppose they were like the creatures in Pizarro , poor dear yellow things with brass bracelets , '
165774	165789	165771	165772	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I remember seeing Macready as Rolla when I was quite a little thing . '
165800	165810	165812	165815	Mr. Smithson of Lesbia	726	' Do you care about staying for the end ? '
165817	165828	165812	165815	Mr. Smithson of Lesbia	726	' It will make us rather late at the Orleans . '
165829	165837	165839	165839	Lesbia	726	' Never mind how late we are , '
165843	165891	165839	165839	Lesbia	726	' I have always been cheated out of this last act for some stupid party . Imagine losing Gounod and Nillson for the sake of struggling through the mob on a stifling staircase , and being elbowed by inane young men , with gardenias in their coats . '
166305	166311	166298	166299	Mr. Smithson	726	' a bullock 's heart , '
166387	166399	166401	166402	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Why should not you go with us , Don Gomez ? '
166410	166460	166401	166402	Lady Kirkbank	585	' The drive will be charming not equal to your tropical Cuba but intensely nice . And the gardens will be something too sweet on such a night as this . I knew them when the dear Duc d'Aumale was there . Ay de mi , such a man ! '
166476	166482	166484	166485	Don Gomez	839	' I should be charmed , '
166487	166507	166484	166485	Don Gomez	839	' if I thought my friend Smithson wanted me . Would you really like to have me , Smithson ? '
166508	166514	166581	166582	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I should be enchanted . '
166515	166524	166484	166485	Don Gomez	839	' And there is room on the drag ? '
166525	166567	166581	166582	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Room enough for half - a - dozen . I am only taking Sir George Kirkbank and Colonel Delville whom we are to pick up at the Haute Gomme and Mr. and Mrs. Mostyn , who are in the stalls . '
166568	166575	166581	166582	Lady Kirkbank	585	' A nice snug little party , '
166584	166618	166581	166582	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I hate a crowd on a drag . The way some of the members of the Four - in - hand Club load their coaches on parade reminds me of a Beanfeast ! '
167000	167008	167010	167011	Sir George	597	' Could n't get on without Delville , '
167013	167034	167010	167011	Sir George	597	' dooced smart fellow , sir . Knows the ropes ; and does all the thinking for both of us . '
167297	167313	167315	167316	his wife	998	' Frank ought to be delightfully fresh , for he recuperated all the way down , '
167337	167353	167355	167356	Colonel Delville	782	' I would n't have minded his recuperating if he had n't snored so abominably , '
167944	167956	167958	167958	Smithson	726	' You wo n't dance to - night , I suppose ? '
168002	168009	167961	167961	Lesbia	726	' You must be horribly tired ? '
168010	168031	168033	168033	Lesbia	726	' I am not in the least tired , and I mean to waltz , if anyone will ask me , '
168037	168057	168059	168059	Smithson	726	' I ought to have asked you to dance , and then it would have been the other way , '
168067	168103	168059	168059	Smithson	726	' Surely you have dancing enough in town , and you might be obliging for once in a way , and come and sit with me in the garden , and listen to the nightingales . '
168104	168117	168119	168120	the band	5548	' There are no nightingales after June . There is the Manola , '
168124	168130	168119	168120	the band	5548	' my very favourite waltz . '
168140	168155	168156	168156	he	839	' May I have the honour of this waltz with you , Lady Lesbia ? '
168172	168180	168156	168156	he	839	' I do n't think Smithson waltzes ? '
168181	168201	168203	168203	Lesbia	499	' I have been told that nobody can waltz who has been born on this side of the Pyrenees , '
168512	168519	168521	168521	Smithson	605	' He robbed me of her ! '
168525	168570	168521	168521	Smithson	605	' Will he rob me of this one too ? Surely not ! Havana is Havana and this one is not a Creole . If I can not trust that lovely piece of marble , there is no woman on earth to be trusted . '
168953	168959	168963	168963	himself	605	' I must be diplomatic , '
169000	169050	168963	168963	himself	605	' I will give her a hint as to that man 's character , and I will keep them apart as much as I can . But if he forces himself upon me there is no help for it . I can not afford to be uncivil to him . '
169051	169055	168966	168966	he	605	' Can not afford '
169060	169064	168966	168966	he	605	' dare not , '
169563	169565	169567	169567	I	0	' I 'm
169574	169578	169567	169567	I	0	' said Don Gomez .
169579	169690	170008	170008	She	499	' On the contrary , it is a relief to get away from the lights and the people . How delicious this river is ! I was brought up on the shores of a lake ; but after all a lake is horribly tame . Its limits are always staring one in the face . There is no room for one 's imagination to wander . Now a river like this suggests an infinity of possibilities , drifting on and on and on into undiscovered regions , by ever - varying shores . I feel to - night as if I should like to step into that little boat yonder , '
169714	169725	170008	170008	She	499	' and let the stream take me wherever it chose . '
169726	169735	169737	169737	Gomez	839	' If I could but go with you , '
169753	169789	169737	169737	Gomez	839	' I would ask for neither compass nor rudder . What could it matter whither the boat took me ? There is no place under the stars which would not be a paradise with you . '
169790	169804	169806	169806	Lesbia	499	' Please do n't make a dreamy aspiration the occasion for a compliment , '
169810	169861	169806	169806	Lesbia	499	' What I said was so silly that I do n't wonder you thought it right to say something just a little sillier . But moonlight and running water have a curious effect upon me ; and I , who am the most prosaic among women , become ridiculously sentimental . '
169862	169872	169737	169737	Gomez	839	' I can not believe that you are prosaic . '
169873	169927	169806	169806	Lesbia	499	' I assure you it is perfectly true . I am of the earth , earthy ; a woman of the world , in my first season , ambitious , fond of pleasure , vain , proud , exacting , all those things which I am told a woman ought not to be . '
169928	169994	169737	169737	Gomez	839	' You pain me when you so slander yourself ; and I shall make it the business of my life to find out how much truth there is in that self - slander . For my own part I do not believe a word of it ; but as it is rude to contradict a lady I will only say that I reserve my opinion . '
169995	170004	170006	170006	Lesbia	499	' Are you to stay long in England ? '
170080	170129	170059	170059	she	499	' That will depend . I am not particularly fond of London . A very little of your English Babylon satisfies me , in a general way ; but there are conditions which might make England enchanting . Where do you go at the end of the season ? '
170130	170176	170613	170614	the Spaniard	5431	' First to Goodwood , and then to Cowes . Mr. Smithson is so kind as to place his yacht at Lady Kirkbank 's disposal , and I am to be her guest on board the Cayman , just as I am in Arlington Street . '
170177	170194	170059	170059	she	499	' The Cayman ! That name is a reminiscence of Mr. Smithson 's South American travels . '
170195	170206	170613	170614	the Spaniard	5431	' No doubt ! Was he long in South America ? '
170207	170213	170059	170059	she	499	' Three or four years . '
170214	170226	170613	170614	the Spaniard	5431	' But not in Cuba all that time , I suppose ? '
170227	170288	170059	170059	she	499	' He had business relations with Cuba all that time , and oscillated between our island and the main . He was rather fortunate in his little adventures with us made almost as much money as General Tacon , of blessed memory . But I dare say Smithson has told you all his adventures in that part of the world . '
170289	170334	170613	170614	the Spaniard	5431	' No , he very rarely talks about his travels : and I am not particularly interested in commercial speculations . There is always so much to think of and talk about in the business of the moment . Are you fond of Cuba ? '
170335	170420	170059	170059	she	499	' Not passionately . I always feel as if I were an exile there , and yet one of my ancestors was with Columbus when he discovered the island , and my race were among the earliest settlers . My family has given three Captain - generals to Cuba : but I can not forget that I belong to an older world , and have forfeited that which ought to have been a brilliant place in Europe for the luxurious obscurity of a colony . '
170421	170441	170613	170614	the Spaniard	5431	' But you must be attached to a place in which your family have lived for so many generations ? '
170442	170510	170059	170059	she	499	' I like the stars and the sea , the mountains and savannas , the tropical vegetation , and the dreamy , half - oriental life ; but at best it is a kind of stagnation , and after a residence of a few months in the island of my birth I generally spread my wings for the wider world of the old continent or the new . '
170511	170519	170521	170521	Lesbia	726	' You must have travelled so much , '
170527	170562	170521	170521	Lesbia	726	' I have been nowhere and seen nothing . I feel like a child who has been shut up in a nursery all its life , and knows of no world beyond four walls . '
170563	170572	170574	170575	Don Gomez	839	' Not to travel is not to live , '
170577	170590	170592	170592	Lesbia	726	' I am to be in Italy next November , I believe , '
170608	170611	170613	170614	the Spaniard	5431	' Italy ! '
170618	170684	170613	170614	the Spaniard	5431	' Once the finishing school of the English nobility ; now the happy hunting - ground of the Cockney tourist and the prosperous Yankee . All the poetry of Italy has been dried up , and the whole country vulgarised . If you want romance in the old world go to Spain ; in the new , try Peru or Brazil , Mexico or California . '
170685	170699	170750	170750	Lesbia	726	' I am afraid I am not adventurous enough to go so far . '
170700	170709	170613	170614	the Spaniard	5431	' No : women cling to beaten tracks . '
170710	170716	170718	170718	Lesbia	726	' We obey our masters , '
170722	170749	170613	170614	the Spaniard	5431	' Ah , I forgot . You are to have a master and soon . I heard as much before I saw you to - night . '
170766	170774	170775	170775	she	5621	' Yes , it is all settled , '
170778	170799	170775	170775	she	5621	' and now I think I must go back . Lady Kirkbank will be wondering what has become of me . '
170800	170808	170810	170811	Don Gomez	839	' Let her wonder a little longer , '
170813	170934	170810	170811	Don Gomez	839	' Why should we hurry away from this delightful spot ? Why break the spell of the river ? Life has so few moments of perfect contentment . If this is one with you as it is with me let us make the most of it . Lady Lesbia , do you see those weeds yonder , drifting with the tide , drifting side by side , touching as they drift ? They have met heaven knows how , and will part heaven knows where , on their way to the sea ; but they let themselves go with the tide . We have met like those poor weeds . Do n't let us part till the tide parts us . '
171105	171114	171115	171115	he	726	' I have been hunting for you everywhere , '
171120	171174	171115	171115	he	726	' If you want another waltz , Lady Lesbia , you had better take the next . I believe it is to be the last . At any rate our party are clamouring to be driven home . I found poor Lady Kirkbank fast asleep in a corner of the drawing - room . '
171175	171184	171186	171187	Don Gomez	839	' Will you give me that last waltz ? '
171267	171286	171265	171265	she	499	' No , I must not indulge myself . I must go and take care of Lady Kirkbank . '
171371	171412	171413	171413	he	839	' She is very lovely , and she is well not quite spoiled by her entourage , and they tell me she is an heiress sure to inherit a fine fortune from some ancient grandmother , buried alive in Westmoreland , '
171416	171569	171413	171413	he	839	' What a splendid opportunity it would be if if the business could be arranged on the square . But as it is well as it is there is the chance of an adventure ; and when did a Montesma ever avoid an adventure , although there were dagger or poison lurking in the background ? And here there is neither poison nor steel , only a lovely woman , and an infatuated stockbroker , about whom I know enough to disgrace and ruin an archbishop . Poor Smithson ! How very unlucky that I should happen to come across your pathway in the heyday of your latest love affair . We have had our little adventures in that line already , and we have measured swords together , metaphorically , before to - night . When it comes to a question of actual swords my Smithson declines . Pas si bete . '
171755	171766	171767	171767	she	445	' Am I really , really , really your wife ? '
171794	171804	171767	171767	she	445	' It is all so dreadfully like a dream . '
171805	171815	171817	171818	Lord Hartfield	443	' Thank God , it is the very truth , '
171846	171936	171823	171826	the fresh young face	5649	' And am I actually a Countess ? I do n't care about it one little bit , you know , except as a stupendous joke . If you were to tell me that you had been only making fun of poor grandmother and me , and that those diamonds are glass , and you only plain John Hammond , it would n't make the faintest difference . Indeed , it would be a weight off my mind . It is an awfully oppressive thing to be a Countess . '
171937	171939	171958	171959	Lady Hartfield	824	' I 'm
171976	171976	171964	171964	you	0	'
171977	171983	171985	171985	Mary	445	' It is very dreadful , '
171987	172035	171985	171985	Mary	445	' If her ladyship were as well and as active as she was when first you came to Fellside , she could have helped me ; but now there will be no one , except you . And you will help me , wo n't you Jack ? '
172036	172042	171964	171964	you	0	' With all my heart . '
172043	172049	172056	172056	his	5651	' My own true Jack , '
172060	172106	172056	172056	his	5651	' In society I suppose I shall have to call you Hartfield . " Hartfield , please ring the bell . " " Give me a footstool , Hartfield . " How odd it sounds . I shall be blurting out the old dear name . '
172107	172190	172241	172243	an affectionate wife	5653	' I do n't think it will much matter . It will pass for one of Lady Hartfield 's little ways . Every woman is supposed to have little ways , do n't you know . One has a little way of dropping her friends ; another has a little way of not paying her dressmaker ; another 's little way is to take too much champagne . I hope Lady Hartfield 's little way will be her devotion to her husband . '
172191	172193	172246	172246	you	5652	' I 'm
172212	172218	172206	172206	I	0	' answered Mary , gaily ; '
172257	172257	172246	172246	you	5652	'
172258	172271	172246	172246	you	5652	' I should very much object to your being in the fashion . '
172272	172382	172246	172246	you	5652	' Then I am happy . I do n't think it is in my nature to become a woman of fashion ; although I have cured myself , for your sake , of being a hoyden . I had so schooled myself for what I thought our new life was to be ; so trained myself to be a managing economical wife , that I feel quite at sea now that I am to be mistress of a house in Grosvenor Square and a place in Kent . Still , I will bear with it all ; yes , even endure the weight of those diamonds for your sake . '
172436	172441	172443	172443	Mary	445	' Our last day , '
172466	172496	172443	172443	Mary	445	' I shall be glad to go back to poor grandmother , who must be sadly lonely ; but it is so sweet to be quite alone with you . '
172584	172602	172603	172603	she	524	' You can never know how sweet it is to me to be able to love you , '
172607	172663	172603	172603	she	524	' You can never know how my heart yearned to you from the very first , and how hard it was to keep myself in check and not be too kind to you . Oh , Hartfield , you should have told me the truth . You should not have come here under false colours . '
172664	172796	172562	172562	she	524	' Should I not , Lady Maulevrier ? It was my only chance of being loved for my own sake ; or , at least of knowing that I was so loved . If I had come with my rank and my fortune in my hand , as it were one of the good matches of the year what security could I ever have felt in the disinterested love of the girl who chose me ? As plain John Hammond I wooed and was rejected ; as plain John Hammond I wooed and won ; and the prize which I so won is a pearl above price . Not for worlds , were the last year to be lived over again , would I have one day of my life altered . '
172797	172872	172896	172897	Lord Hartfield	443	' Well , I suppose I ought to be satisfied . I wanted you for Lesbia , and I have got you for Mary . Best of all , I have got you for myself . Ronald Hollister 's son is mine ; he is of my kin ; he belongs to me ; he will not forsake me in life ; he will be near me , God grant , when I die . '
172873	172894	172896	172897	Lord Hartfield	443	' Dear Lady Maulevrier , as far as in me lies , I will be to you as a son , '
172921	172936	172937	172937	she	445	' It makes me so happy to have won a little of your regard , '
172940	172955	172937	172937	she	445	' and to know that I have married a man whom you can love . '
172956	172967	172968	172969	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Of course you have heard of Lesbia 's engagement ? '
172980	172988	172968	172969	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Maulevrier wrote to us about it . '
172989	172993	173000	173000	Mary	445	' To us . '
173020	173029	172968	172969	Lady Maulevrier	524	' And do you know this Mr. Smithson ? '
173030	173042	172968	172969	Lady Maulevrier	524	' Not intimately . I have met him at the Carlton . '
173043	173075	172968	172969	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I am told that he is very much esteemed by your party , and that he is very likely to get a peerage when this Ministry goes out of office . '
173076	173103	172968	172969	Lady Maulevrier	524	' That is not improbable . Peerages are to be had if a man is rich enough ; and Smithson is supposed to be inordinately rich . '
173104	173115	173117	173118	Lady Maulevrier	524	' I hope he has character as well as money , '
173122	173142	173117	173118	Lady Maulevrier	524	' But do you think a man can become inordinately rich in a short time , with unblemished honour ? '
173143	173152	173154	173154	Hartfield	443	' We are told that nothing is impossible , '
173156	173198	173154	173154	Hartfield	443	' Faith can remove a mountain ; only one does not often see it done . However , I believe Mr. Smithson 's character is fairly good as millionaires go . We do not inquire too closely into these things nowadays . '
173319	173330	173331	173331	she	524	' I am to see the man early in August , '
173343	173384	173331	173331	she	524	' I hope I may like him . Lady Kirkbank tells me it is a brilliant marriage , and I must take her word . What can I do for my granddaughter a useless log a prisoner in two rooms ? '
173385	173391	173393	173393	Mary	445	' It is very hard , '
173397	173454	173393	173393	Mary	445	' but I do not see any reason why Lesbia should not be happy . She likes a brilliant life ; and Mr. Smithson can give her as much gaiety and variety as she can possibly desire . And , after all , yachts , and horses , and villas , and diamonds are nice things . '
173455	173475	173477	173478	Lady Maulevrier	524	' They are the things for which half the world is ready to cheat or murder the other half , '
173736	173746	173706	173706	they	5677	' wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake . '
173938	173944	173945	173945	he	989	' I was a wretch , '
173948	173955	173945	173945	he	989	' blind , besotted , imbecile . '
173956	173991	173993	173993	Mary	445	' No , no , no . Lesbia is very lovely and I could not expect you would care for me till she was gone away . How glad I am that she went , '
174039	174048	174049	174049	he	989	' You have your waterproof , of course , '
174073	174089	174049	174049	he	989	' No young woman in the Lake country would think of being without a waterproof . '
174343	174351	174353	174353	Mary	445	' Let us go to my boudoir , '
174355	174387	174353	174353	Mary	445	' Let me enjoy the full privilege of having a boudoir my very own room . Was n't it too good of grandmother to have it made so smart for me ? '
174388	174398	174400	174401	her husband	989	' Nothing can be too good for my Mary , '
174409	174424	174400	174401	her husband	989	' but it was very nice of her ladyship and the room is charming . '
174685	174695	174697	174697	Mary	445	' It will be delightful to read your speeches , '
174699	174738	174697	174697	Mary	445	' but I am silly and selfish enough to wish you were a country squire , with no business in London . And yet I do n't wish that either , for I am intensely proud of you . '
174739	174762	174656	174656	He	443	' And some day , before we are much older , you will sit in your robes in the peeress 's gallery . '
174763	174770	174772	174772	Mary	445	' Oh , I could n't , '
174774	174810	174772	174772	Mary	445	' I should make a fool of myself , somehow . I should look like a housemaid in borrowed plumes . Remember , I have no Anstand I have been told so all my life . '
174811	174837	174839	174842	her lover - husband	5725	' You will be one of the prettiest peeresses who ever sat in that gallery , and the purest , and truest , and dearest , '
174844	174898	174899	174899	She	445	' Oh , if I am good enough for you , I am satisfied . I married you , and not the House of Lords . But I am afraid your friends will all say , " Hartfield , why in heaven 's name did you marry that uncultivated person ? " Look ! '
174996	175003	175005	175005	Mary	445	' It is Steadman 's uncle , '
175007	175023	175005	175005	Mary	445	' Do let me go and speak to him , poor , poor old man . '
175024	175028	175030	175030	Hartfield	443	' The madman ! '
175032	175054	175030	175030	Hartfield	443	' No , Mary ; go to your room at once . I 'll get him back to his own den . '
175055	175087	175088	175089	Lord Hartfield	443	' But he is not mad at any rate , he is quite harmless . Let me just say a few words to him . Surely I am safe with you . '
175149	175160	175161	175161	she	445	' I hope you are better , poor old soul , '
175176	175183	175185	175187	the old man	921	' What , is it you ? '
175193	175233	175185	175187	the old man	921	' Oh , I have been looking for you looking looking waiting , waiting for you . I have been hoping for you every hour and every minute . Why did n't you come to me , cruel girl ? '
175234	175242	175244	175244	Mary	445	' I tried with all my might , '
175246	175278	175280	175280	Mary	445	' but people blocked up the door in the stables , and they would n't let me go to you ; and I have been rather busy for the last fortnight , '
175287	175296	175280	175280	Mary	445	' I I am married to this gentleman . '
175297	175322	175185	175187	the old man	921	' Married ! Ah , that is a good thing . He will take care of you , if he is an honest man . '
175323	175342	175344	175344	Mary	445	' I thought he was an honest man , but he has turned out to be an earl , '
175348	175355	175344	175344	Mary	445	' My husband is Lord Hartfield . '
175356	175360	175361	175363	the old man	921	' Hartfield Hartfield , '
175368	175377	175361	175363	the old man	921	' Surely I have heard that name before . '
175462	175465	175467	175468	the man	1325	' Come , '
175470	175519	175467	175468	the man	1325	' come with me , my dear . You forgot me , but I have not forgotten you . I mean to leave you my fortune . Come with me , and I 'll show you your legacy . It is all for you every rupee every jewel . '
175540	175547	175549	175550	the man	1325	' Come , child , come ! '
175553	175615	175549	175550	the man	1325	' Come and see what I have left you in my will . I make a new will every day , but I leave everything to you every will is in your favour . But if you are married you had better have your legacy at once . Your husband is strong enough to take care of you and your fortune . '
175616	175621	175623	175623	Mary	445	' Poor old man , '
175625	175632	175623	175623	Mary	445	' pray let us humour him . '
175688	175697	175699	175701	the old man	921	' Come , come , both of you , '
176486	176551	176478	176478	he	921	' Steadman is uncommonly clever thinks he knows everything but he does n't know the trick of this table . I could hide a regiment of Sepoys in this table , my dear . Well , well , perhaps not Sepoys too big , too big but I could hide all the State papers of the Presidency . There are drawers enough for that . '
176600	176607	176609	176611	the old man	921	' Now , come with me , '
176878	176881	176882	176882	he	1325	' Look , '
176886	176899	176882	176882	he	1325	' this is her legacy this is my little girl 's legacy . '
176988	176997	176999	177001	the old man	921	' These are all for her all all , '
177003	177104	177105	177105	he	921	' They are worth a prince 's ransom . Those rouleaux are all gold ; those gems are priceless . They were the dowry of a princess . But they are hers now yes , my dear , they are yours because you spoke sweetly , and smiled prettily , and were very good to a lonely old man and because you have my mother 's face , dear , a smile that recalls the days of my youth . Lift out the box and take it away with you , if you are strong enough , you , you , '
177112	177138	177105	177105	he	921	' Hide it somewhere keep it from her . Let no one know no one except your wife and you must be in the secret . '
177139	177169	176999	177001	the old man	921	' My dear sir , it is out of the question impossible that my wife or I should accept one of those coins or the smallest of those jewels . '
177170	177180	177105	177105	he	921	' Why not , in the devil 's name ? '
177181	177208	176999	177001	the old man	921	' First and foremost , we do not know how you came in possession of them ; secondly , we do not know who you are . '
177209	177244	177105	177105	he	921	' They came to me fairly enough bequeathed to me by one who had the right to leave them . Would you have had all that gold left for an adventurer to wallow in ? '
177245	177262	177264	177265	Lord Hartfield	443	' You must keep your treasure , sir , however it may have come to you , '
177268	177310	177264	177265	Lord Hartfield	443	' My wife can not take upon herself the burden of a single gold coin least of all from a stranger . Remember , sir , to us your possession of this wealth nay , your whole existence is a mystery . '
177311	177320	177322	177324	the old man	921	' You want to know who I am ? '
177347	177356	177326	177326	himself	921	' Well , sir . I am - - '
177372	177379	177380	177380	he	921	' No , no , no , '
177383	177413	177380	177380	he	921	' caution , caution ! They have not done with me yet ; she warned me they are lying in wait ; I must n't walk into their trap . '
177426	177463	177421	177421	he	921	' I shall not condescend to tell you who I am , sir . You must know that I am a gentleman , and that is enough for you . There is my gift to your wife '
177468	177475	177421	177421	he	921	' take it or leave it . '
177476	177489	177421	177421	he	921	' I shall leave it , sir , with all due respect . '
177523	177532	177533	177533	he	921	' Do you take me for a thief ? '
177536	177606	177533	177533	he	921	' Are you afraid to touch my gold that gold for which men and women sell their souls , blast their lives with shame , and pain , and dishonour , all the world over ? Do you stand aloof from it refuse to touch it , as if it were infected ? And you , too , girl ! Have you no sense ? Are you an idiot ? '
177607	177618	177619	177619	Mary	445	' I can do nothing against my husband 's wish , '
177624	177667	177619	177619	Mary	445	' and , indeed , there is no need for us to take your money . We are rich without it . Please leave that chest to a hospital . It will be ever so much better than giving it to us . '
177668	177681	177619	177619	Mary	445	' You told me you were going to marry a poor man ? '
177682	177706	177708	177708	Mary	445	' I know . But he cheated me , and turned out to be a rich man . He was a horrid impostor , '
177753	177760	177761	177761	he	921	' I have done with you . '
177764	177805	177761	177761	he	921	' You can go your ways , both of you . Fools , fools , fools ! The world is peopled with rogues and fools ; and , by heaven , I would rather have to do with the rogues ! '
177836	177843	177845	177846	Lord Hartfield	443	' Good - night , sir , '
177861	177868	177870	177870	Mary	445	' Good - night , sir , '
177881	177888	177889	177889	he	921	' Good - night , child , '
177892	177902	177889	177889	he	921	' I am sorry you have married an ass . '
178005	178019	178020	178020	she	445	' Goodness gracious , Lady Mary ! how ever did you come here ? '
178036	178050	178051	178051	Mary	445	' We came to please Steadman 's uncle he brought us in here , '
178056	178064	178102	178103	Mrs. Steadman	630	' But where did you find him ? '
178065	178076	178051	178051	Mary	445	' In the corridor just by her ladyship 's room . '
178077	178100	178102	178103	Mrs. Steadman	630	' Then he must have taken the key out of Steadman 's pocket , or Steadman must have left it about somewhere , '
178118	178157	178102	178103	Mrs. Steadman	630	' My poor husband is not the man he was . And so you met him in the corridor , and he brought you in here . Poor old gentleman ! He gets madder and madder every day . '
178158	178166	178168	178169	Lord Hartfield	443	' There is method in his madness , '
178171	178191	178168	178169	Lord Hartfield	443	' He talked very much like sanity just now . Has your husband had the charge of him long ? '
178198	178229	178102	178103	Mrs. Steadman	630	' A goodish time , sir . I ca n't quite exactly say time passes so quiet in a place like this . One hardly keeps count of the years . '
178230	178236	178237	178238	Mrs. Steadman	630	' Forty years , perhaps ? '
178256	178260	178261	178261	she	630	' Forty years , '
178269	178349	178261	178261	she	630	' Oh , dear no , sir , not a quarter as long . It is n't so many years , after all , since Steadman 's poor old uncle went a little queer in his head ; and Steadman , having such a quiet home here , and plenty of spare room , made bold to ask her ladyship if he might give the poor old man a home , where he would be in nobody 's way .

178369	178385	178366	178367	Lord Hartfield	443	' Pray when and where did Mr. Steadman 's uncle learn to smoke a hookah ? '
178412	178418	178420	178421	Lord Hartfield	443	' Where is your husband ? '
178423	178440	178420	178421	Lord Hartfield	443	' I should like to have a little talk with him , if he is disengaged . '
178441	178451	178453	178454	Mrs. Steadman	630	' He is not very well , my lord , '
178456	178591	178453	178454	Mrs. Steadman	630	' He has been ailing off and on for the last six months , but I could n't get him to see the doctor , or to tell her ladyship that he was in bad health . And about a week ago he broke down altogether , and fell into a kind of drowsy state . He keeps about , and he does his work pretty much the same as usual , but I can see that it 's too much for him . If you like to come downstairs I can let you through the lower door into the hall ; and if he should have woke up since I have left him he 'll be at your lordship 's service . But I 'd rather not wake him out of his sleep . '
178592	178610	178420	178421	Lord Hartfield	443	' There is no occasion . What I have to say will keep till to - morrow . '
178703	178721	178723	178724	Mrs. Steadman	630	' He was so chilly and shivery this afternoon that I was obliged to light a fire , '
178726	178734	178736	178736	Hartfield	443	' He seems to be sleeping heavily , '
178738	178758	178736	178736	Hartfield	443	' Do n't awaken him . I 'll see him to - morrow morning before I go to London . '
178759	178774	178776	178777	the wife	1182	' He sleeps half the day just as heavy as that , my lord , '
178784	178794	178776	178777	the wife	1182	' I do n't think it can be right . '
178795	178803	178805	178806	Lord Hartfield	443	' I do n't think so either , '
178808	178817	178805	178806	Lord Hartfield	443	' You had better call in the doctor . '
178818	178853	178854	178854	She	1182	' I will , my lord , to - morrow morning . James will be angry with me , I daresay ; but I must take upon myself to do it without his leave . '
178881	178897	178899	178900	Lord Hartfield	443	' Come , Molly , see if you can beat me at a fifty game , '
178920	178937	178939	178939	Mary	445	' Of course you will annihilate me , but it will be a relief to play , '
178941	179009	178939	178939	Mary	445	' That strange old man has given me a shock . Everything about his surroundings is so different from what I expected . And how could an uncle of Steadman 's come by all that money and those jewels if they were jewels , and not bits of glass which the poor old thing has chopped up , in order to delude himself with an imaginary treasure ? '
179010	179023	179098	179098	his	443	' I do not think they are bits of glass , Molly . '
179024	179038	179040	179040	Mary	445	' They sparkled tremendously almost as much as my our the family diamonds , '
179060	179086	179040	179040	Mary	445	' but if they are real jewels , and all those rouleaux real money , how could Steadman 's uncle become possessed of such wealth ? '
179087	179092	179094	179095	Lord Hartfield	443	' How , indeed ? '
179106	179109	179105	179107	THE ' CAYMAN	10094	' CAYMAN . '

179398	179437	179388	179396	an ancient dowager of the ever - young type	5848	' No , dear Lady Sevenoaks , she can only marry one , do n't you know ; but the other is nice to go about with ; and I believe it is the other she really likes . '
179438	179449	179451	179452	the dowager	1629	' It is always the other that a woman likes , '
179454	179545	179451	179452	the dowager	1629	' I am madly in love with this Peruvian no , I think you said Cuban myself . I wish some good - natured creature would present him to me . If you know anybody who knows him , tell them to bring him to my next afternoon Saturday . But why does chose machin Smithson allow such a handsome hanger - on ? After marriage I could understand that he might not be able to help himself ; but before marriage a man generally has some kind of authority . '

180294	180406	180291	180292	Lady Kirkbank	585	' and you do n't half enough appreciate him . He has given me his very own cabin such a dear little den ! There are his cigar boxes and everything lovely on the shelves , and his own particular dressing - case put open for me to use all the backs of all the brushes repoussť silver , and all the scent - bottles filled expressly for me . If the yacht would only stand quite still , I should think it more delicious than the best house I ever stayed in : only I do n't altogether enjoy that little way it has of gurgling up and down perpetually . '
180840	180855	180856	180856	he	5922	' You have contrived somehow to keep me very much at a distance hitherto , '
180860	180911	180856	180856	he	5922	' and I feel sometimes as if we were almost strangers ; but a yacht is the best place in the world to bring two people together , and a week at Cowes will make us nearer to each other and more to each other than three months in London ; '
180997	181039	180981	180981	she	5927	' I never liked you much , and now we are engaged I find myself liking you less and less every day . Save me from the irrevocable wickedness of a loveless marriage . Forgive me , and let me go . '
181960	181963	181951	181951	he	605	' good enough '
181997	182002	181987	181987	she	499	' They would do . '
182006	182015	182016	182016	she	499	' It is dreadfully small , of course , '
182019	182051	182016	182016	she	499	' when one is accustomed to rooms : but it is rather amusing to be in a sort of doll 's house , and on deck it is really very nice . '
182286	182306	182308	182308	Lesbia	726	' How good it is of somebody to row about , just to give us that nice soothing sound , '
182473	182479	182480	182480	he	839	' So good of you , '
182483	182497	182480	182480	he	839	' I really did not expect you till the beginning of the week . '
182498	182561	182684	182685	Lady Lesbia	499	' London is simply insupportable in this weather most of all for a man born in the Havanas . My soul thirsted for blue water . So I said to myself , This good Smithson is at Cowes ; he will give me the run of his yacht and a room at his villa . Why not go to Cowes at once ? '
182562	182592	182480	182480	he	839	' The room is at your service . I have only two or three of my people at Formosa , but just enough to look after a bachelor friend . '
182593	182604	182606	182606	Montesma	839	' I want very little service , my dear fellow , '
182610	182679	182606	182606	Montesma	839	' A man who has crossed the Cordilleras and camped in the primeval forest on the shores of the Amazon , learns to help himself . So this is the Cayman ? Muy deleitoso , mi amigo . A floating Paradise in little . If the ark had been like this , I do n't think any of the passengers would have wanted the flood to dry up . '
182734	182747	182748	182748	he	839	' I have left my portmanteaux at the end of the pier , '
182752	182772	182748	182748	he	839	' I dare say one of your fellows will be good enough to take them to Formosa for me ? '
182822	182845	182804	182804	he	726	' Don Gomez de Montesma , I do n't want you here , and I must request you to transfer yourself elsewhither . '

183657	183660	183666	183666	his	726	' Yes , '
183670	183728	183666	183666	his	726	' Spanish America and the West Indies are delightful places to talk about . There are so many things one leaves out of the picture thieves , niggers , jiggers , snakes , mosquitoes , yellow Jack , creeping , crawling creatures of all kinds . I always feel very glad I have been to South America . '
183729	183732	183666	183666	his	726	' Why ? '
183733	183744	183746	183747	Mr. Smithson	726	' In order that I may never go there again , '
183749	183763	183765	183765	Lesbia	726	' I was beginning to hope you would take me there some day , '
183767	183822	183666	183666	his	726	' Never again , no , not even for your sake . No man should ever leave Europe after he is five - and - thirty ; indeed , I doubt if after that age he should venture beyond the Mediterranean . That is the sea of civilisation . Anything outside it means barbarism . '
183823	183837	183839	183839	Lesbia	726	' I hope we are going to travel by - and - by , '
183841	183920	183839	183839	Lesbia	726	' I have been mewed up in Grasmere half my life , and if you are going to confine me to the shores of the Mediterranean , which is , after all , only a larger lake , for the other half of my life , my existence will be a dull piece of work after all . I agree with what Don Gomez said the other night : " Not to travel is not to live . " '
184891	184913	184914	184914	he	726	' Amigo , I do n't care even to look at land in such weather . It is so detestably dry , '
184917	184967	184914	184914	he	726	' It is only the sound of the sea gurgling against the hull that reconciles one to existence . Go , and be happy at your club , and send off those occult telegrams of yours , dearest . I shall not leave the Cayman till bed - time . '
185121	185135	185137	185137	Montesma	839	' There is a good deal of the dolce far niente about this , '
185141	185183	185137	185137	Montesma	839	' but do n't you think we have been anchored in sight of that shabby little town quite long enough , and that it would be rather nice to spread our wings and sail round the island before the racing begins ? '
185184	185190	185192	185192	Lesbia	726	' It would be exquisite , '
185194	185209	185210	185210	she	585	' I am very tired of inaction , though I dearly love learning Spanish , '
185229	185244	185210	185210	she	585	' But I have really been beginning to wonder whether this boat can move . '
185245	185279	185137	185137	Montesma	839	' You will see that she can , and at a smart pace , too , if I sail her . Shall we circumnavigate the island ? We can set sail after dinner . '
185280	185290	185210	185210	she	585	' Will Mr. Smithson consent , do you think ? '
185291	185302	185137	185137	Montesma	839	' Why does Smithson exist , except to obey you ? '
185303	185316	185318	185318	Lesbia	726	' I do n't know if Lady Kirkbank would quite like it , '
185351	185356	185357	185357	she	585	' Quite like what ? '
185362	185367	185137	185137	Montesma	839	' A little sail . '
185368	185385	185318	185318	Lesbia	726	' I should dearly love it , if it did n't make me sea - sick . '
185386	185399	185401	185401	Montesma	839	' Sea - sick on a glassy lake like this ! Impossible , '
185403	185416	185401	185401	Montesma	839	' I consider the thing settled . We set sail after dinner . '
186218	186225	186226	186226	she	585	' I am not going cabin , '
186235	186248	186230	186230	Lesbia	499	' only going saloon sofa lie down little Smithson take care you , '
186256	186262	186230	186230	Lesbia	499	' shall be quite close . '
186281	186293	186294	186294	he	839	' It is the only true way of learning a language , '
186297	186303	186294	186294	he	839	' grammars are a delusion . '
186413	186416	186417	186417	he	839	' Ten , '
186420	186456	186457	186457	she	499	' Ten ! Surely it must be later . It was past eight before we began dinner , and we have been sailing for ever so long . Captain , kindly tell me the time , '
186477	186484	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' Twelve o'clock , my lady . '
186485	186534	186457	186457	she	499	' Heavens , can I possibly have been sitting here so long . I should like to stay on deck all night and watch the sailing ; but I must really go and take care of poor Lady Kirkbank . I am afraid she is not very well . '
186535	186568	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' She had a somewhat distracted air when she went below , but I daresay she will sleep off her troubles . If I were you I should leave her to herself . '
186569	186580	186457	186457	she	499	' Impossible ! What can have become of Mr. Smithson ? '
186581	186598	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' I have a shrewd suspicion that it is with Smithson as with poor Lady Kirkbank . '
186599	186608	186457	186457	she	499	' Do you mean that he is ill ? '
186609	186612	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' Precisely . '
186613	186635	186457	186457	she	499	' What , on a calm summer night , sailing over a sea of glass . The owner of a yacht ! '
186636	186675	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' Rather ignominious for poor Smithson , is n't it ? But men who own yachts are only mortal , and are sometimes wretched sailors . Smithson is feeble on that point , as I know of old . '
186676	186690	186457	186457	she	499	' Then was n't it rather cruel of us to sail his yacht ? '
186691	186712	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' Yachts are meant for sailing , and again , sea - sickness is supposed to be a wholesome exercise . '
186713	186718	186457	186457	she	499	' Good - night . '
186719	186724	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' Good - night , '
186747	186753	186755	186755	Montesma	839	' Must you really go ? '

186790	186795	186787	186788	the poet	7169	' Really and truly . '
186796	186813	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' I am so sorry . I wish you could have stayed on deck all night . '
186814	186838	186787	186788	the poet	7169	' So do I , with all my heart . This calm sea under the starlit sky is like a dream of heaven . '
186839	186866	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' It is very nice , but if you stayed I think I could promise you considerable variety . We shall have a tempest before morning . '
186867	186884	186787	186788	the poet	7169	' Of all things in the world I should love to see a thunderstorm at sea . '
186885	186903	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' Be on the alert then , and Captain Parkes and I will try to oblige you . '
186904	186934	186787	186788	the poet	7169	' At any rate you have made it impossible for me to sleep . I shall stay with Lady Kirkbank in the saloon . Good - night , again . '
186935	186940	186460	186461	the skipper	6123	' Good - night . '
187110	187127	187129	187130	Lady Kirkbank	585	' What can you be thinking of , staying on deck all night with those men ? '
187134	187140	187129	187130	Lady Kirkbank	585	' It is hardly respectable . '
187159	187162	187151	187151	she	585	' that man '
187165	187169	187151	187151	she	585	' those men . '
187170	187179	187180	187180	Lesbia	726	' What do you mean by all night ? '
187185	187192	187180	187180	Lesbia	726	' it is only just twelve . '
187193	187213	187180	187180	Lesbia	726	' Only twelve . I thought we were close upon daylight . I have suffered an eternity of agony . '
187214	187234	187180	187180	Lesbia	726	' I am very sorry you should be ill ; but really the sea has been so deliciously calm . '
187235	187273	187180	187180	Lesbia	726	' I believe I should have suffered less if it had been diabolically rough . Oh , that monotonous flip - flap of the water , that slow heaving of the boat ! Nothing could be worse . '
187274	187296	187180	187180	Lesbia	726	' I am glad to hear you say that , for Don Gomez says we are likely to have a tempest . '
187297	187301	187303	187303	Georgie	597	' A tempest ! '
187305	187350	187303	187303	Georgie	597	' Then let him stop the boat this instant and put me on shore . Tell him to land me anywhere on the Needles even . I could stop at the lighthouse till morning . A storm at sea will be simply my death . '
187351	187361	187363	187363	Lesbia	726	' Dear Lady Kirkbank , I was only joking , '
187379	187387	187363	187363	Lesbia	726	' so far the night is lovely . '
187388	187400	187180	187180	Lesbia	726	' Give me a spoonful more brandy , my good creature , '
187404	187437	187180	187180	Lesbia	726	' Lesbia , you ought never to have brought me into this miserable state . I consented to staying on board the yacht ; but I never consented to sailing on her . '
187438	187463	187363	187363	Lesbia	726	' You will soon be well , dear Lady Kirkbank ; and you will have such an appetite for breakfast to - morrow morning . '
187464	187473	187180	187180	Lesbia	726	' Where shall we be at breakfast time ? '
187474	187490	187363	187363	Lesbia	726	' Off St. Catherine 's Point , I believe just half way round the island . '
187491	187503	187505	187505	Georgie	597	' If we are not at the bottom of the sea , '
187998	188006	188008	188008	Montesma	839	' You ought not to be here , '
188010	188019	188008	188008	Montesma	839	' it is much rougher than I expected . '
188020	188026	188027	188027	she	6156	' I am not afraid , '
188030	188046	188027	188027	she	6156	' but I will go back to my cabin if I am in your way . '
188047	188051	188008	188008	Montesma	839	' In my way '
188056	188105	188008	188008	Montesma	839	' yes , you are in my way , for I shall think of nothing else now you are here . But I believe we have done all that need be done to the yacht , and I can take care of you till the storm is over . '
188882	188920	188921	188921	he	726	' If I had stayed on deck I must have had my finger in the pie ; so I thought it better to go below and get a good night 's rest in the steward 's cabin , '
188959	188972	188973	188973	he	726	' I want to talk to you on a rather serious matter , '
189256	189270	189271	189271	he	726	' Smithson , do you know that you have an utterly incompetent crew ? '
189287	189308	189271	189271	he	726	' Indeed I do not . The men are all experienced sailors , and the captain ranks high among yachtsmen . '
189309	189430	189271	189271	he	726	' English yachtsmen are not particularly good judges of sailors . I tell you your skipper is no sailor , and his men are fools . If it had not been for me the Cayman would have gone to pieces on the rocks last night , and if you are to cross to St. Malo , as you talked of doing , for the regatta there , you had better sack these men and let me get you a South American crew . I know of a fellow who is in London just now the captain of a Rio steamer , who 'll send you a crew of picked men , if you give me authority to telegraph to him . '
189431	189439	189441	189441	Smithson	726	' I do n't like foreign sailors , '
189448	189457	189441	189441	Smithson	726	' and I have perfect confidence in Wilkinson . '
189458	189490	189492	189492	Montesma	839	' Which is as much as to say that you consider me a liar ! Go to the bottom your own way , mon ami : ce n'est pas mon affaire , '
190188	190205	190207	190207	Smithson	605	' I think you knew something of my captain , Wilkinson , before I engaged him , '
190213	190226	190228	190229	his friend	7076	' I know every skipper on board every boat in the squadron , '
190231	190241	190228	190229	his friend	7076	' A good fellow , Wilkinson thoroughly honest fellow . '
190242	190271	190207	190207	Smithson	605	' Honest ; oh yes , I know all about that . But how about his seamanship ? His certificates were wonderfully good , but they are not everything .
190272	190279	190281	190282	the other	1789	' Everything , my dear fellow , '
190284	190300	190281	190282	the other	1789	' they are next to nothing . But I believe Wilkinson is a tolerable sailor . '
190306	190316	190207	190207	Smithson	605	' He has never been unlucky , I believe . '
190317	190439	190281	190282	the other	1789	' My dear Smithson , you are a great authority in the City , but you are not very well up in the records of the yachting world , or you would know that your Captain Wilkinson was skipper on the Orinoco when she ran aground on the Chesil Bank , coming home from Cherbourg Regatta , fifteen lives lost , and the yacht , in less than half an hour , ground to powder . That was rather a bad case , I remember ; for though it was a tempestuous night , the accident would never have happened if Wilkinson had not mistaken the lights . So you see his Trinity House papers did n't prevent his going wrong . '
190668	190687	190663	190663	he	726	' Do you really care about crossing to St. Malo after this really prefer the idea to Ryde ? '
190688	190691	190693	190693	Lesbia	499	' Infinitely , '
190697	190764	190693	190693	Lesbia	499	' Ryde would only be Cowes ever again a lesser Cowes ; and I thought when you first proposed it that the plan was rather stupid , though I did not want to be uncivil and say so . But I was delighted with Don Gomez de Montesma 's amendment , substituting St. Malo for Ryde . In the first place the trip across will be delicious '
190771	190784	190663	190663	he	726	' and in the second place I am dying to see Brittany . '
190785	190806	190663	190663	he	726	' I doubt if you will highly appreciate St. Malo . It is a town of many and various smells . '
190807	190872	190663	190663	he	726	' But I want to smell those foreign smells of which one hears much . At least it is an experience . We need not be on shore any longer than we like . And I want to see that fine rocky coast , and Chateaubriand 's tomb on the what's - its - name . So nice to be buried in that way . '
190873	190896	190663	190663	he	726	' Then you have set your heart on going to St. Malo , and would not like any change in our plan ? '
190897	190905	190907	190907	Lesbia	499	' Any change will be simply detestable , '
191021	191081	190997	190997	she	499	' O God ! that I were on one of those islands in the Caribbean Sea an island where Europeans never come where I might lie down among the poisonous tropical flowers , and sleep the rest of my days away . I am sick to death of my life here ; of the yacht , the people everything . '
191082	191092	191093	191094	the girl	2488	' This air is too relaxing , Lady Lesbia , '
191099	191122	191093	191094	the girl	2488	' and you did n't have your natural rest last night . Shall I get you a nice strong cup of tea ? '
191123	191158	191160	191160	her	2488	' Tea ! no . I have been living upon tea for the last twenty - four hours . I have eaten nothing . My mouth is parched and burning . Oh , Kibble ! '
191175	191189	191160	191160	her	2488	' what a happy creature you are not a care not a care . '
191190	191192	191093	191094	the girl	2488	' I 'm
191204	191238	191201	191202	Lady Lesbia	499	' said Kibble , with an incredulous smile , trying to smooth the disordered hair , anxious to make haste with the unfinished toilet , for it was within a few minutes of eight .
191239	191286	191160	191160	her	2488	' I am full of care . I am in debt horribly in debt getting deeper and deeper every day and I am going to sell myself to the only man who can pay my debts and give me fine houses , and finery like this , '
191346	191368	191491	191492	poor Kibble	570	' But surely , dear Lady Lesbia , you wo n't marry Mr. Smithson , if you do n't love him ? '
191369	191383	191495	191495	Lesbia	499	' Do you suppose love has anything to do with marriages in society ? '
191384	191403	191491	191492	poor Kibble	570	' Oh , Lady Lesbia , it would be so unkind to him , so cruel to yourself . '
191404	191474	191495	191495	Lesbia	499	' Cruel to myself . Yes , I am cruel to myself . I had the chance of happiness a year ago , and I lost it . I have the chance of happiness now yes , of consummate bliss and have n't the courage to snatch at it . Take off this horrid gown , Kibble ; my head is splitting : I sha n't go to dinner . '
191475	191489	191491	191492	poor Kibble	570	' Oh , Lady Lesbia , you are treading on the pearl embroidery , '
191505	191511	191512	191512	she	499	' What does it matter ! '
191520	191533	191512	191512	she	499	' It has not been paid for perhaps it never will be . '
191664	191682	191684	191684	Smithson	726	' You can telegraph to your Rio Janeiro friend to - morrow morning , if you like , '
191688	191728	191684	191684	Smithson	726	' and tell him to send a first - rate skipper and crew . Lady Lesbia has made up her mind to see St. Malo Regatta , and with such a sacred charge I ca n't be too careful . '
191729	191740	191742	191742	Montesma	839	' I 'll wire before eight o'clock to - morrow , '
191744	191776	191742	191742	Montesma	839	' You have decided wisely . Your respectable English Wilkinson is an excellent man but nothing would surprise me less than his reducing your Cayman to matchwood in the next gale . '
191854	191862	191863	191863	she	445	' There is something wrong , Jack , '
191895	191975	191863	191863	she	445	' You try to talk and to be lively , but there is a little perpendicular wrinkle in your forehead which I know as well as the letters of the alphabet , and that little line means worry . I used to see it in the old days , when you were breaking your heart for Lesbia . Why can not you be frank and confide in me . It is your duty , sir , as my husband . '
191976	192009	192088	192088	her	6267	' Is it my duty to halve my burdens as well as my joys ? How do I know if those girlish shoulders are strong enough to bear the weight of them ? '
192010	192053	191863	191863	she	445	' I can bear anything you can bear , and I wo n't be cheated out of my share in your worries . If you were obliged to have a tooth out , I would have one out too , for company . '
192054	192067	192088	192088	her	6267	' I hope the dentist would be too conscientious to allow that . '
192068	192076	192077	192077	she	6267	' Tell me your trouble , Hartfield , '
192145	192155	192156	192156	Mary	445	' Tell me what it is that worries you , '
192160	192223	192156	192156	Mary	445	' I will , dear . After all perfect trust is the best ; nay , it is your due , for you are brave enough and true enough to be trusted with secrets that mean life and death . In a word , then , Mary , the cause of my trouble is that old man we saw the other night . '
192224	192229	192156	192156	Mary	445	' Steadman 's uncle ? '
192230	192242	192156	192156	Mary	445	' Do you really believe that he is Steadman 's uncle ? '
192243	192250	192252	192252	Mary	445	' My grandmother told me so , '
192305	192317	192263	192271	this girl , who was the soul of truth	6273	' Do you think my grandmother would tell me an untruth ? '
192318	192425	192263	192271	this girl , who was the soul of truth	6273	' I do not believe that man is a poor dependent , an old servant 's kinsman , sheltered and cared for in this house for charity 's sake . Forgive me , Mary , if I doubt the word of one you love ; but there are positions in life in which a man must judge for himself . Would Mr. Steadman 's kinsman be lodged as that old man is lodged ; would he talk as that old man talks ; and last and greatest perplexity of all , would he possess a treasure of gold and jewels which must be worth many thousands ? '
192426	192472	192263	192271	this girl , who was the soul of truth	6273	' But you can not know for certain that those things are valuable ; they may be rubbish that this poor old man has scraped together and hoarded for years , glass jewels bought at country fairs . Those rouleaux may contain lead or coppers . '
192473	192578	192263	192271	this girl , who was the soul of truth	6273	' I do not think so , Mary . The stones had all the brilliancy of valuable gems , and then there were others in the finest filagree settings goldsmith 's work which bore the stamp of an Eastern world . Take my word for it , that treasure came from India ; and it must have been brought to England by Lord Maulevrier . It may have existed all these years without your grandmother 's knowledge . That is quite possible ; but it seems to me impossible that such wealth should be within the knowledge and the power of a pauper lunatic . '
192579	192612	192614	192614	Mary	445	' But if that unhappy old man is not a relation of Steadman 's supported here by my grandmother 's benevolence , who can he be , and why is he here ? '
192616	192736	192263	192271	this girl , who was the soul of truth	6273	' Oh , Molly dear , these are two questions which I can not answer , and which yet ought to be answered somehow . Since that night I have felt as if there were a dark cloud lowering over this house a cloud almost as terrible in its menace of danger as the forshadowing of fate in a Greek legend . For your sake , for the honour of your race , for my own self - respect as your husband , I feel that this mystery ought to be solved , and all dark things made light before your grandmother 's death . When she is gone the master - key to the past will be lost . '
192737	192762	192763	192763	My	0	' But she will be spared for many years , I hope , spared to sympathise with my happiness , and with Lesbia 's . '
192817	192817	192790	192790	You	7315	'
192818	192837	192839	192839	Mary	445	' It will be very hard to part , just as she has begun to care for me , '
192848	192938	192790	192790	You	7315	' All such partings are hard , and your grandmother 's life has been so lonely and joyless that the memory of it must always have a touch of pain . One can not say of her as we can of the happy ; she has lived her life all things have been given to her , and she falls asleep at the close of a long and glorious day . For some reason which I can not understand , Lady Maulevrier 's life has been a prolonged sacrifice . '
192939	192962	192964	192964	Mary	445	' She has always given us to understand that she was fond of Fellside , and that this secluded life suited her , '
192968	193103	192790	192790	You	7315	' I can not help doubting her sincerity on that point . Lady Maulevrier is too clever a woman , and forgive me , dear , if I add too worldly a woman , to be content to live out of the world . The bird must have chafed its breast against the bars of the cage many and many a time when you thought that all was peace . Be sure , Mary , that your grandmother had a powerful motive for spending all her days in this place , and I can but think that the old man we saw the other night had some part in that motive . Do you remember telling me of her ladyship 's vehement anger when she heard you had made the acquaintance of her pensioner ? '
193104	193112	193113	193113	Mary	445	' Yes , she was very angry , '
193121	193149	193113	193113	Mary	445	' I never saw her so angry she was almost beside herself said the harshest things to me talked as if I had done some dreadful mischief . '
193150	193176	193113	193113	Mary	445	' Would she have been so moved , do you think , unless there was some fatal secret involved in that man 's presence here ? '
193177	193203	193113	193113	Mary	445	' I hardly know what to think . Tell me everything . What is it that you fear ? what is it that you suspect ? '
193204	193303	193113	193113	Mary	445	' To tell you my fears and suspicions is to tell you a family secret that has been kept from you out of kindness all the years of your life and I hardly think I could bring myself to that if I did not know what the world is , and how many good - natured friends Lady Hartfield will meet in society , by - and - by , ready to tell her , by hints and innuendoes , that her grandfather , the Governor of Madras , came back to England under a cloud of disgrace . '
193304	193312	193314	193314	Mary	445	' My poor grandfather ! How dreadful ! '
193322	193341	193314	193314	Mary	445	' Did he deserve his disgrace , poor unhappy creature or was he the victim of false accusation ? '
193342	193417	193113	193113	Mary	445	' I can hardly tell you that , Mary , any more than I can tell whether Warren Hastings deserved the abuse that was wreaked upon him at one time , or the acquittal that gave the lie to his slanderers in after years . The events occurred forty years ago the story was only half known then , and like all such stories formed the basis for every kind of exaggeration and perversion . '
193418	193423	193425	193425	Mary	445	' Does Maulevrier know ? '
193427	193443	193113	193113	Mary	445	' Maulevrier knows all that is known by the general public , and no more . '
193444	193456	193458	193458	Mary	445	' And you have married the granddaughter of a disgraced man , '
193465	193474	193458	193458	Mary	445	' Did you know when you married me ? '
193475	193533	193534	193534	She	6281	' As much as I know now , dear love . If you had been Jonathan Wild 's granddaughter you would have been just as dear to me . I married you , dearest ; I love you ; I believe in you . All the grandfathers in Christendom would not shake my faith by one tittle . '
193590	193597	193598	193598	she	6281	' Society never forgets a scandal , '
193601	193609	193598	193598	she	6281	' I have heard Maulevrier say that . '
193610	193715	193725	193725	he	6283	' Society has a long memory for other people 's sins , but it only avenges its own wrongs . Give the wicked fairy Society a bad dinner , or leave her out of your invitation list for a ball , and she will twit you with the crimes or the misfortunes of a remote ancestor she will go about talking of your grandfather the leper , or your great aunt who ran away with her footman . But so long as the wicked fairy gets all she wants out of you , she cares not a straw for the misdeeds of past generations . '

194107	194115	194089	194090	Lord Hartfield	443	' Going to you by first train . '

194358	194365	194366	194366	he	443	' That 's something like friendship , '
194395	194405	194406	194406	he	443	' Come and have some supper , old fellow , '
194409	194446	194406	194406	he	443	' and I can tell you my troubles while you are eating it . James , bring us a grill , and a lobster , and a bottle of Mumms , number 27 , you know . '
194447	194453	194377	194377	he	443	' Yes , my lord . '
194454	194465	194467	194468	Lord Hartfield	443	' Sorry to find you in this den , Maulevrier , '
194470	194545	194377	194377	he	443	' Have n't touched a card . Have n't done half an hour 's punting this season . But it 's a kind of habit with me to wander in here now and then . I know so many of the members . One poor devil lost nine thousand one night last week . Rather rough upon him , was n't it ? All ready money at this shop , do n't you know . '
194546	194569	194377	194377	he	443	' Thank God , I know nothing about it . And now , Maulevrier , what is wrong , and with whom ? '
194570	194581	194377	194377	he	443	' Everything is wrong , and with my sister Lesbia . '
194582	194591	194377	194377	he	443	' Good heavens ! what do you mean ? '
194592	194710	194377	194377	he	443	' Only this , that there is a fellow after her whose very name means ruin to women a Spanish - American adventurer reckless , handsome , a gambler , seducer , duellist , dare - devil . The man she is to marry seems to have neither nous nor spunk to defend her . Everybody at Goodwood saw the game that was being played , everybody at Cowes is watching the cards , betting on the result . Yes , great God , the men at the Squadron Club are staking their money upon my sister 's character even monkeys that she bolts with Montesma five to three against the marriage with Smithson ever coming off . '
194711	194716	194377	194377	he	443	' Is this true ? '
194717	194897	194377	194377	he	443	' It is as true as your marriage with Molly , as true as your loyalty to me . I was told of it all this morning at the Haute Gomme by a man I can rely upon , a really good fellow , who would not leave me in the dark about my sister 's danger when all the smoking - rooms in Pall Mall were sniggering about it . My first impulse was to take the train for Cowes ; but then I knew if I went alone I should let my temper get the better of me . I should knock somebody down throw somebody out of the window make a devil of a scene . And this would be fatal for Lesbia . I wanted your counsel , your cool head , your steady common - sense . " Not a step forward without Jack , " I said to myself , so I bolted off and sent that telegram . It relieved my feeling a little , but I 've had a wretched day . '
194898	194912	194914	194915	Lord Hartfield	443	' Waiter , bring me a Bradshaw , or an A B C , '
194966	194974	194976	194976	Maulevrier	461	' Eat your supper , old fellow , '
194978	195015	194976	194976	Maulevrier	461	' After all , the danger may not be so desperate as I fancied this morning . Slander is the favourite amusement of the age we live in . We must allow a margin for exaggeration . '
195016	195022	195024	195024	Hartfield	443	' A very liberal margin , '
195026	195085	195024	195024	Hartfield	443	' No doubt the man who warned you meant honestly , but this scandal may have grown out of the merest trifles . The feebleness of the Masher 's brain is only exceeded by the foulness of the Masher 's tongue . I daresay this rumour about Lady Lesbia has its beginning and end among the Masher species . '
195086	195174	194976	194976	Maulevrier	461	' I hope so , but I have seen those two together I met them at Victoria one evening after Goodwood . Old Kirkbank was shuffling on ahead , carrying Smithson with her , absorbing his attention by fussification about her carriage . Lesbia and that Cuban devil were in the rear . They looked as if they had all the world to themselves . Faust and Marguerite in the garden were not in it for the expression of intense absorbing feeling compared with those two . I 'm
195220	195220	195293	195293	Maulevrier	461	'
195221	195232	195293	195293	Maulevrier	461	' And you say this Montesma is a dangerous man ? '
195233	195236	195293	195293	Maulevrier	461	' Deadly . '
195237	195281	195293	195293	Maulevrier	461	' Well , we must lose no time . When we are on the spot it will be easy to find out the truth ; and it will be your duty , if there be danger , to warn Lesbia and her future husband .
195282	195291	195293	195293	Maulevrier	461	' I would much rather shoot the Cuban , '
195295	195361	195293	195293	Maulevrier	461	' I never knew much good come of a warning in such a case : it generally precipitates matters . If I could play ťcartť with him at the club , find him sporting an extra king , throw my cards in his face , and accept his challenge for an exchange of shots on the sands beyond Cherbourg there would be something like satisfaction . '

195372	195387	195293	195293	Maulevrier	461	' Report says something worse of him . Report says he is a cheat . '
195388	195398	195400	195401	Lord Hartfield	443	' We must not be dependent upon society gossip , '
195403	195427	195400	195401	Lord Hartfield	443	' I have an idea , Maulevrier . The more we know about this man Montesma , I think you called him - - '
195428	195433	195293	195293	Maulevrier	461	' Gomez de Montesma . '
195434	195548	195400	195401	Lord Hartfield	443	' The more fully we are acquainted with Don Gomez de Montesma 's antecedents the better we shall be able to cope with him , if we come to handy - grips . It 's too late to start for Cowes , but it is not too late to do something . Fitzpatrick , the political - economist , spent a quarter of a century in South America . He is a very old friend knew my father and I can venture to knock at his door after midnight all the more as I know he is a night - worker . He is very likely to enlighten us about your Cuban hidalgo . '
195549	195701	195293	195293	Maulevrier	461	' You shall finish your supper before I let you stir . After that you may do what you like . I was always a child in your hands , Jack , whether it was climbing a mountain or crossing the Horse - shoe Fall . I consider the business in your hands now . I 'll go with you wherever you like , and do what you tell me . When you want me to kick anybody , or fight anybody , you can give me the office and I 'll do it . I know that Lesbia 's interests are safe in your hands . You once cared very much for her . You are her brother - in - law now , and , next to me , you are her natural protector , taking into account that her future husband is a cad and does n't score . '
195702	195727	195400	195401	Lord Hartfield	443	' Meet me at Waterloo at ten minutes to seven to - morrow morning , and we 'll go down to Cowes together . I 'm

196021	196028	196004	196005	the Irishman	6331	' Just come from the House ? '
196029	196067	196140	196141	the clerk	6325	' No ; I 've just come from Westmoreland . I thought I should find you among those everlasting books of yours , late as it is . Can I have a few words alone with you ? '
196068	196081	196004	196005	the Irishman	6331	' Certainly . Morgan , you can go away for a bit . '
196082	196087	196140	196141	the clerk	6325	' Home , sir ? '
196088	196130	196004	196005	the Irishman	6331	' Home well yes , I suppose it 's late . You look sleepy . I should have been glad to finish the chapter on Beetroot Sugar to - night but it may stand over for the morning . Be sure you 're

196134	196139	196140	196141	the clerk	6325	' Yes , sir , '
196177	196191	196193	196193	Fitzpatrick	885	' Now , my dear Hartfield , what can I do for you ? '
196201	196221	196193	196193	Fitzpatrick	885	' I can see by your face that you 've something serious in hand . Can I help you ? '
196222	196247	196140	196141	the clerk	6325	' You can , I believe , in a very material way . You were five - and - twenty years in Spanish America ? '
196248	196254	196193	196193	Fitzpatrick	885	' Rather more than less . '
196255	196263	196140	196141	the clerk	6325	' Here , there , and everywhere ? '
196264	196290	196193	196193	Fitzpatrick	885	' Yes ; there is not a city in South America that I have not lived in for something between a day and a year . '
196291	196311	196140	196141	the clerk	6325	' You know something about most men of any mark in that part of the world , I conclude ? '
196312	196408	196193	196193	Fitzpatrick	885	' It was my business to know men of all kinds . I had my mission from the Spanish Government . I was engaged to examine the condition of commerce throughout the colony , the working of protection as against free trade , and so on . Strange , by - the - bye , that Cuba , the last place to foster the slave trade , was of all spots of the earth the first to carry free - trade principles into practical effect , long before they were recognised in any European country . '
196409	196426	196428	196429	Lord Hartfield	443	' Strange to me that you should speak of Cuba so soon after my coming in , '
196431	196455	196428	196429	Lord Hartfield	443	' I am here to ask you to help me to find out the antecedents of a man who hails from that island . '
196456	196469	196471	196472	Mr. Fitzpatrick	885	' I ought to know something about him , whoever he is , '
196476	196525	196471	196472	Mr. Fitzpatrick	885	' I spent six months in Cuba not very long before my return to England . Cuba is one of my freshest memories ; and I have a pretty tight memory for facts , names and figures . Never could remember two lines of poetry in my life . '
196526	196545	196193	196193	Fitzpatrick	885	' Did you ever hear of , or meet with , a man called Montesma Gomez de Montesma ? '
196546	196562	196564	196564	Fitzpatrick	885	' Could n't have stopped a month in Havana without hearing something about that gentleman , '
196566	196586	196564	196564	Fitzpatrick	885	' I hope he is n't a friend of yours , and that you have not lent him money ? '
196587	196603	196193	196193	Fitzpatrick	885	' Neither ; but I want to know all you can tell me about him . '
196604	196622	196624	196625	the other	1789	' You shall have it in black and white , out of my Cuban note - book , '
196635	196701	196624	196625	the other	1789	' I always take notes of anything worth recording , on the spot . A man is a fool who trusts to memory , where personal character is at stake . Montesma is as well known at Havana as the Morro Fort or the Tacon Theatre . I have heard stories enough about him to fill a big volume ; but all the facts recorded there '
196711	196723	196724	196724	He	1789	' have been thoroughly sifted ; I can vouch for them . '

196824	196833	196800	196800	he	1789	' Gospel truth : I knew the lady . '
196834	196839	196800	196800	he	1789	' And the rest ? '
196840	196844	196800	196800	he	1789	' All true . '
196845	196878	196800	196800	he	1789	' A thousand thanks . I know now upon what ground I stand . I have to save an innocent , high - bred girl from the clutches of a consummate scoundrel . '
196879	196907	196909	196910	Mr. Fitzpatrick	885	' Shoot him , and shoot her , too , if there 's no better way of saving her . It will be an act of mercy , '

197200	197204	197206	197207	the sailor	5111	' Is she ? '
197211	197229	197206	197207	the sailor	5111	' Look at her now . What do you call that , if it is n't soul ? '

198126	198153	198154	198154	she	499	' I suppose I am over - fatigued : that I have done too much in London and here . Life in Westmoreland was very different , '

198607	198632	198599	198600	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I never was so thoroughly fagged ; I feel as if I had been beaten with sticks , basti what 's its name . '

This is what you did for the girl placed under your charge . But , thank God , I have released myself from your clutches . I am going far away to a new world , where the memory of my old life can not follow me . People may be angry or pleased ! I do not care .

In your eyes my old friend Smithson is an admirable match . You measure him by his houses , his stable , his banker 's book ; but Lesbia would rather marry the man she loves , and take the risks of his fate . I am not a pauper , Lady Kirkbank , and the home to which I shall take my love is pretty enough for a princess of the blood royal , and for her sake I shall grow richer yet , '

It will be so nice when the Prince and all the best people are in Paris . We shall only stay in Cuba till the fuss about my running away is all over , and people have forgotten , do n't you know . As for Mr. Smithson , why should I have any more compunction about jilting him than he had about that poor Miss Trinder ? By - the - bye , I want you to send him back all his presents for me . They are almost all in Arlington Street . I brought nothing with me except my engagement ring , '

203950	203969	203948	203948	Maulevrier	461	' An appropriate place . A sailor has a wife in every port , do n't you know . '

204072	204102	204143	204144	Lord Hartfield	443	' I would rather talk below , if it is all the same to you , Senor ; and I should be glad to speak to Lady Lesbia alone . '
204103	204114	204116	204116	Montesma	839	' That you shall not do unless she desires it , '
204118	204139	204141	204141	Lesbia	499	' No , he shall hear all that you have to say . He shall hear how I answer you , '

204158	204181	204155	204155	he	443	' It will make the disclosure a little more painful than it need have been ; but that can not be helped . '
204185	204197	204198	204198	They	6538	' OH , SAD KISSED MOUTH , HOW SORROWFUL IT IS ! '
204231	204249	204250	204250	Maulevrier	461	' Did you give your consent to my sister 's elopement with this man , Lady Kirkbank ? '
204255	204302	204336	204336	he	461	' I give my consent ! Good gracious ! no . He has eloped with me ever so much more than with your sister . She knew all about it , I 've no doubt : but the wretch ran away with me in my sleep . '
204303	204325	204327	204327	Maulevrier	461	' I am glad , for your own self - respect , that you had no hand in this disgraceful business , '
204339	204378	204336	204336	he	461	' Hartfield , will you tell my sister who and what this man is ? Will you make her understand what kind of pitfall she has escaped ? Upon my soul , I can not speak of it . '
204379	204406	204408	204408	Lesbia	499	' I recognise no right of Lord Hartfield 's to interfere with my actions , and I will hear nothing that he may have to say , '
204426	204451	204453	204453	Hartfield	443	' Your sister 's husband has the strongest right to control your actions , Lady Lesbia , when the family honour is at stake , '
204459	204484	204453	204453	Hartfield	443	' Accept me at least as a member of your family , if you will not accept me as your disinterested and devoted friend . '
204485	204488	204490	204490	Lesbia	499	' Friend ! '
204494	204560	204490	204490	Lesbia	499	' You might have been my friend once . Your friendship then would have been of some value to me , if you had told me the truth , instead of approaching me with a lie upon your lips . You talk of honour , Lord Hartfield ; you , who came to my grandmother 's house as an impostor , under a false name ! '
204561	204651	204453	204453	Hartfield	443	' I went there as a man standing on his own merits , assuming no rank save that which God gave him among his fellow - men , claiming to be possessed of no fortune except intellect and industry . If I could not win a wife with such credentials , it were better for me never to marry at all , Lady Lesbia . But we have no time to speak of the past . I am here as your brother 's friend , here to save you . '
204652	204687	204689	204689	Lesbia	499	' To part me from the man to whom I have given my heart . That you can not do . Gomez , why do you not speak ? Tell him , tell him ! '
204698	204718	204689	204689	Lesbia	499	' tell him that I am to be your wife to - morrow , at Havre . Your wife ! '
204719	204729	204731	204732	Lord Hartfield	443	' Dear Lady Lesbia , that can not be , '
204756	204797	204743	204743	he	443	' I am assured upon undeniable authority that Senor Montesma has a wife living at Cuba ; and even were this not so were he free to marry you his character and antecedents would for ever forbid such a marriage . '
204798	204808	204810	204810	Lesbia	499	' A wife ! No , no , no ! '
204820	204880	204810	204810	Lesbia	499	' It is a lie a lie , invented by my brother , who always hated me by you , who fooled and deceived me ! It is a lie , an infamous invention ! Don Gomez , speak to them : for pity 's sake answer them ! Do n't you see that they are driving me mad ? '
204924	204934	204935	204935	he	461	' You shall not pollute her with your touch , '
204938	205274	204935	204935	he	461	' you have poisoned her mind already . Scoundrel , seducer , slave - dealer ! Do you hear , Lesbia ? Shall I tell you what this man is what trade he followed yonder , on his native island this Spanish hidalgo this all - accomplished gentleman lineal descendant of the Cid fine flower of Andalusian chivalry ? It was not enough for him to cheat at cards , to float bubble companies , bogus lotteries . His profligate extravagance , his love of sybarite luxury , required a larger resource than the petty schemes which enrich smaller men . A slave ship , which could earn nearly twenty thousand pounds on every voyage , and which could make two runs in a year that was the trade for Don Gomez de Montesma , and he carried it on merrily for six or seven years , till the British cruisers got too keen for him , and the good old game was played out . You see that scar upon the hidalgo 's forehead , Lesbia a token of knightly prowess , you think , perhaps . No , my girl , that is the mark of an English cutlass in a scuffle on board a slaver . A merry trade , Lesbia the living cargo stowed close under hatches have rather a bad time of it now and then short rations of food and water , yellow Jack . They die like rotten sheep sometimes bad then for the dealer . But if he can land the bulk of his human wares safe and sound the profits are enormous . The Captain - General takes his capitation fee , the blackies are drafted off to the sugar plantations , and everybody is satisfied ; but I think , Lesbia , that your British prejudices would go against marriage with a slave - trader , were he ever so free to make you his wife , which this particular dealer in blackamoors is not . '
205275	205287	205289	205289	Lesbia	499	' Is this true , this part of their vile story ? '
205326	205334	205335	205335	he	2454	' There is some truth in it , '
205340	205415	205335	205335	he	2454	' Everybody in Cuba had a finger in the African trade , before your British philanthropy spoiled it . Mr. Smithson made sixty thousand pounds in that line . It was the foundation of his fortune . And yet he had his misfortunes in running his cargo a ship burnt , a freight roasted alive . There are some very black stories in Cuba against poor Smithson . He will never go there again . '
205416	205438	205440	205441	Lord Hartfield	443	' Mr. Smithson may be a scoundrel ; indeed , I believe he is a pretty bad specimen in that line , '
205443	205556	205440	205441	Lord Hartfield	443	' But I doubt if there is any story that can be told of him quite so bad as the history of your marriage , and the events that went before it . I have been told the story of the beautiful Octoroon , who loved and trusted you , who shared your good and evil fortunes for the most desperate years of your life , was almost accepted as your wife , and whose strangled corpse was found in the harbour while the bells were ringing for your marriage with a rich planter 's heiress the lady who , no doubt , now patiently awaits your return to her native island . '
205557	205565	205567	205567	Montesma	839	' She will wait a long time , '
205569	205775	205567	205567	Montesma	839	' or fare ill if I go back to her . Lesbia , his lordship 's story of the Octoroon is a fable an invention of my Cuban enemies , who hate us old Spaniards with a poisonous hatred . But this much is true . I am a married man bound , fettered by a tie which I abhor . Our Havre marriage would have been bigamy on my part , a delusion on yours . I could not have taken you to Cuba . I had planned our life in a fairer , more civilised world . I am rich enough to have surrounded you with all that makes life worth living . I would have given you love as true and as deep as ever man gave to woman . All that would have been wanting would have been the legality of the tie : and as law never yet made a marriage happy which lacked the elements of bliss , our lawless union need not have missed happiness . Lesbia , you said that you would hold by me , come what might . The worst has come , love ; but it leaves me not the less your true lover . '
205918	205927	205903	205903	She	6548	' Let me go ! Let me go ! '
206128	206151	206152	206152	he	443	' If you consider yourself entitled to call me to account for this evening 's work you know where to find me , '
206170	206177	206178	206178	he	839	' Ce n'est pas la peine , '
206181	206318	206178	206178	he	839	' I am a dead shot , and should be pretty sure to send a bullet through you if you gave me the chance ; but I should not be any nearer winning her if I killed you : and it is she and she only that I want . You may think me an adventurer swindler gambler slave - dealer what you will but I love her as I never thought to love a woman , and I should have been true as steel , if she had been plucky enough to trust me . But , as I told her an hour ago , women have not lion hearts . They can talk tall while the sky is clear and the sun shines , but at the first crack of thunder va te promener . '
206319	206325	206327	206327	Hartfield	443	' If you have killed her '
206329	206389	206390	206390	He	443	' Killed her ! No . Some small bloodvessel burst in the agitation of that terrible scene . She will be well in a week , and she will forget me . But I shall not forget her . She is the one flower that has sprung on the barren plain of my life . She was my Picciola . '
206540	206549	206550	206550	she	585	' Never had a girl such a chance , '
206553	206581	206550	206550	she	585	' Quite the best match in society . The house in Park Lane alone cost a fortune . Her diamonds would have been the finest in London . '
206582	206600	206602	206602	Maulevrier	461	' They would have been stained with the blood of the niggers he traded in out yonder , '
206604	206620	206602	206602	Maulevrier	461	' Do you think I would have let my sister marry a slave - dealer ? '
206621	206631	206633	206634	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I do n't believe a syllable of it , '
206648	206672	206633	206634	Lady Kirkbank	585	' A vile fabrication of Montesma 's , who wanted to blacken poor Smithson 's character in order to extenuate his own crimes . '
206673	206684	206686	206686	Maulevrier	461	' Well , we wo n't go into that question , '
206689	206723	206686	206686	Maulevrier	461	' The Smithson match is off , anyhow ; and it matters very little to us whether he made most money out of niggers or bubble companies , or lotteries or gaming hells . '
206724	206739	206741	206742	Lady Kirkbank	585	' I am convinced that Smithson made his fortune in a thoroughly gentlemanlike manner , '
206744	206773	206741	206742	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Look at the people who visit him , and the houses he goes to . And I do n't see why the match need be off . I 'm
206792	206792	206783	206783	he	6571	'
206803	206819	206820	206820	he	461	' Does she look like a girl who will play her cards in your fashion ? '
206843	206892	206820	206820	he	461	' Upon my soul , Lady Kirkbank , I consider my sister 's elopement with this Spanish adventurer , with whom she was over head and ears in love , a far more respectable act than her engagement to Smithson , for whom she cared not a straw . '
206893	206920	206922	206923	Lady Kirkbank	585	' Well , I hope if you so approve of her conduct you will help her to pay her dressmaker , and the rest of them , '
206925	206960	206922	206923	Lady Kirkbank	585	' She has been plunging rather deeply , I believe , under the impression that Smithson would pay all her bills when she was married . Your grandmother may not quite like the budget . '
206961	206971	206973	206973	Maulevrier	461	' I will do all I can for her , '
206975	206996	206973	206973	Maulevrier	461	' I would do a great deal to save her from the degradation to which your teaching has brought her . '
207018	207038	207039	207039	she	585	' If I ever expected gratitude from people I might feel the injustice the insolence of your last remark , '
207042	207082	207083	207083	she	585	' but as I never do expect gratitude , I am not disappointed in this case . And now I think if there is a cabin which I can have to myself I should like to retire to it , '
207086	207094	207083	207083	she	585	' My cares are thrown away here . '
207481	207519	207521	207522	Lesbia Haselden	499	' She looked on many a face with vacant eye , On many a token without knowing what ; She saw them watch her , without asking why , And recked not who around her pillow sat . '
207595	207604	207606	207607	Lord Hartfield	443	' Do all you can to cheer her , '
207611	207649	207606	207607	Lord Hartfield	443	' and bring her to Fellside as soon as ever she is strong enough to bear the journey . You and Kibble , with your own man , will be able to do all that is necessary . '
207650	207654	207707	207707	Maulevrier	461	' Quite able . '
207655	207692	207606	207607	Lord Hartfield	443	' That 's right . I must be in the House for the expected division to - night , and I shall go back to Grasmere to - morrow morning . Poor Mary is horribly lonely . '
207853	207861	207862	207862	she	585	' I am evidently not wanted here , '
207870	207941	207862	207862	she	585	' and I must have everything at Kirkbank ready for a house full of people before the twelfth of August , so the sooner I get to Scotland the better . I shall make a dťtour in order to go and see Lady Maulevrier on my way down . It is due to myself that I should let her know that I am entirely blameless in this most uncomfortable business . '
207942	207952	207954	207954	Maulevrier	461	' You can tell her ladyship what you please , '
207958	208006	207954	207954	Maulevrier	461	' I shall not gainsay you , so long as you do not slander my sister ; but as long as I live I shall regret that I , knowing something of London society , did not interfere to prevent Lesbia being given over to your keeping . '
208007	208028	208030	208031	Lady Kirkbank	585	' If I had known the kind of girl she is I would have had nothing to do with her , '
208135	208145	208146	208146	Montesma	839	' You may examine every corner of your ship , '
208168	208204	208152	208152	Smithson	726	' The bird has flown : she will shelter in neither your nest nor in mine , Smithson . You have lost her and so have I. We may as well be friends in misfortune . '
208364	208375	208376	208376	he	726	' I daresay it will end in your marrying her , '
208384	208394	208376	208376	he	726	' If you do , be kind to her . '
208576	208591	208593	208593	Smithson	605	' It was her very innocence which made her a victim to that scoundrel , '
208595	208634	208593	208593	Smithson	605	' her girlish simplicity and Lady Kirkbank 's folly . But I love your sister too well to sacrifice her lightly , Lord Maulevrier ; and if she can forget this midsummer madness , why , so can I. '
208635	208644	208646	208646	Maulevrier	461	' She can not forget , Mr. Smithson , '
208650	208777	208646	208646	Maulevrier	461	' She has done you a great wrong by listening to your false friend 's addresses ; but she did you a still greater wrong when she accepted you as her husband without one spark of love for you . She and you are both happy in having escaped the degradation , the deep misery of a loveless union . I am glad yes , glad even of this shameful escapade with Montesma though it has dragged her good name through the gutter , glad of the catastrophe that has saved her from such a marriage . You are very generous in your willingness to forget my sister 's folly . Let your forgetfulness go a step further , and forget that you ever met her . '
208778	208793	208593	208593	Smithson	605	' That can not be , Lord Maulevrier . She has ruined my life . '
208794	208805	208807	208807	Maulevrier	461	' Not at all . An affair of a season , '
208811	208845	208807	208807	Maulevrier	461	' Next year I shall hear of you as the accepted husband of some new beauty . A man of Mr. Smithson 's wealth and good nature need not languish in single blessedness . '
208886	208895	208807	208807	Maulevrier	461	' THAT FELL ARREST , WITHOUT ALL BAIL . '
209261	209273	209274	209274	she	6629	' My dearest , Fate has not been kind to you , '
209288	209364	209274	209274	she	6629	' The handsomest women are seldom the happiest . Destiny seems to have a grudge against them . And if things have gone amiss it is I who am most to blame . I ought never to have entrusted you with such a woman as Georgina Kirkbank . But you will be happier next season , I hope , dearest . You can live with Mary and Hartfield . They will take care of you . '
209368	209381	209382	209382	she	6643	' Do you think I am going back to the society treadmill ? '
209385	209407	209382	209382	she	6643	' No , I have done with the world . I shall end my days here , or in a convent . '
209408	209462	209496	209496	milliner	6645	' You think so now , dear , but you will change your mind by - and - by . A fancy that has lasted only a few weeks can not alter your life . It will pass as other dreams have passed . At your age you have the future before you . '
209463	209476	209478	209478	Lesbia	726	' No , it is the past that is always before me , '
209480	209487	209478	209478	Lesbia	726	' My future is a blank . '
210050	210062	210063	210063	he	443	' I should only be in your way if I stopped , '
210066	210102	210063	210063	he	443	' for you and Molly have hardly got over the honeymoon stage yet , though you put on the airs of Darby and Joan . I shall be back in a week or ten days . '
210103	210123	210125	210125	Hartfield	443	' In Lady Maulevrier 's state of health I do n't think you ought to stay away very long , '
210127	210192	210193	210193	He	6665	' Poor Lady Maulevrier ! She never cared much for me , do n't you know . But I suppose it would seem unkind if I were to be out of the way when the end comes . The end ! Good heavens ! how coolly I talk of it ; and a year ago I thought she was as immortal as Fairfield yonder . '
210470	210484	210485	210485	she	499	' You know I never cared much for roaming about these everlasting hills , '
210489	210529	210485	210485	she	499	' I never had your passion for Lakeland . It is very good of you to wish to have me , but it is quite impossible . I have hardly strength enough for a little walk in the garden . '
210530	210542	210544	210544	Mary	445	' You would have more strength if you went out more , '
210550	210579	210544	210544	Mary	445	' Mr. Horton says sun and wind are the best doctors for you . Lesbia , you frighten me sometimes . You are just letting yourself fade away . '
210580	210606	210607	210607	Lesbia	499	' If you knew how I hate the world and the sky , Mary , you would n't urge me to go out of doors , '
210612	210694	210607	210607	Lesbia	499	' Indoors I can read , and get away from my own thoughts somehow , for a little while . But out yonder , face to face with the hills and the lake the scenes I have known all my life I feel a heart - sickness that is worse than death . It maddens me to see that old , old picture of mountain and water , the same for ever and ever , no matter what hearts are breaking . '
210937	211072	210931	210932	the materialist	3071	' My dearest , we know nothing except the immutable laws of material life . All the rest is a dream a beautiful dream , if you like a consolation to that kind of temperament which can take comfort from dreams ; but for anyone who has read much , and thought much , and kept as far as possible on a level with the scientific intellect of the age for such an one , Mary , these old fables are too idle . I shall die as I have lived , the victim of an inscrutable destiny , working blindly , evil to some , good to others . Ah ! love , life has begun very fairly for you . May the fates be kind always to my gentle and loving girl ! '
211379	211384	211386	211386	Hartfield	824	' Something has happened , '
211456	211460	211461	211461	she	3059	' The doctor , '
211464	211482	211461	211461	she	3059	' send for Mr. Horton , somebody , for God 's sake . Oh , my lord , '
211490	211492	211461	211461	she	3059	' I 'm
211498	211498	211521	211521	he	443	'
211499	211508	211510	211511	Lord Hartfield	443	' Mary , despatch some one for Horton , '
211721	211743	211744	211744	she	6706	' We have not had a happy life , though there are many who have envied us her ladyship 's favour , '
211753	211819	211744	211744	she	6706	' No one knows where the shoe pinches but those who have to wear it . Poor James ! Early and late , early and late , studying her ladyship 's interests , caring and thinking , in order to keep trouble away from her . Always on the watch , always on the listen . That 's what wore him out , poor fellow ! '
211820	211832	211834	211835	Lord Hartfield	443	' My good soul , your husband was an old man , '
211842	211854	211834	211835	Lord Hartfield	443	' and the end must come to all of us somehow . '
211855	211873	211875	211876	the wife	1182	' He might have lived to be a much older man if he had had less worry , '
211888	211917	211875	211876	the wife	1182	' His days were full of care . We should have been happier in the poorest cottage in Grasmere than we ever were in this big grand house . '
212171	212178	212179	212179	he	443	' Dreadfully bored on the moors , '
212187	212225	212179	212179	he	443	' No birds nobody to talk to could n't stand it any longer . How are the sisters ? Lesbia better ? Why , man alive , how queer you look ! Nothing amiss , I hope ? '
212226	212240	212155	212155	Maulevrier	524	' Yes , there is something very much amiss . Steadman is dead . '
212241	212300	212179	212179	he	443	' Steadman ! Her ladyship 's right hand . That 's rather bad . But you will drop into his stewardship . She 'll trust your long head , I know . Much better that she should look to her granddaughter 's husband for advice in all business matters than to a servant . When did it happen ? '
212301	212332	212155	212155	Maulevrier	524	' Half an hour ago . I was just going to Lady Maulevrier 's room when you rang the bell . Take off your Inverness , and come with me . '
212333	212338	212340	212340	Maulevrier	524	' The poor grandmother , '
212342	212344	212340	212340	Maulevrier	524	' I 'm
212352	212352	212340	212340	Maulevrier	524	'
212595	212610	212585	212585	himself	443	' Dear Lady Maulevrier , I have come to tell you some very bad news '
212611	212614	212616	212617	her ladyship	951	' Lesbia ? '
212624	212642	212585	212585	himself	443	' No , there is nothing wrong with Lesbia . It is about your old servant Steadman . '
212643	212646	212655	212655	she	524	' Dead ? '
212669	212692	212665	212665	his	6726	' Yes . He was seized with apoplexy fell from his chair to the hearth , and never spoke or stirred again . '
212922	212932	212933	212933	he	3220	' Good - evening to you , Lady Maulevrier , '
212940	212969	212933	212933	he	3220	' I should n't have known you if we had met anywhere else . I think , of the two of us , you are more changed than I. '
213035	213075	213031	213031	she	524	' Why did you let him come here ? He ought to be taken care of shut up . It is Steadman 's old uncle a lunatic I sheltered . Why is he allowed to come to my room ? '
213076	213082	213084	213086	the old man	921	' I am Lord Maulevrier , '
213100	213154	213084	213086	the old man	921	' I am Lord Maulevrier , and this woman is my wife . Yes , I am mad sometimes , but not always . I have my bad fits , but not often . But I never forget who and what I am , Algernon , Earl of Maulevrier , Governor of Madras . '
213155	213165	213167	213168	her grandson	2241	' Lady Maulevrier , is this horrible thing true ? '
213172	213188	213189	213189	she	6745	' He is mad , Maulevrier . Do n't you see that he is mad ? '
213212	213224	213226	213227	the accuser	6749	' I tell you , young man , I am Maulevrier , '
213229	213281	213226	213227	the accuser	6749	' there is no one else who has a right to be called by that name , while I live . They have shut me up she and her accomplice denied my name hidden me from the world . He is dead , and she lies there stricken for her sins . '
213282	213295	213318	213320	the old man	921	' My grandfather died at the inn at Great Langdale , faltered Maulevrier .
213296	213316	213318	213320	the old man	921	' Your grandfather was brought to this house ill out of his wits . All cloud and darkness here , '
213326	213424	213318	213320	the old man	921	' How long has it been ? Who can tell ? A weary time long , dark nights , full of ghosts . Yes , I have seen him the Rajah , that copper - faced scoundrel , seen him as she told me he looked when she gave the signal to her slaves to strangle him , there in the hall , where the grave was dug ready for the traitor 's carcass . She too yes , she has haunted me , calling upon me to give up her treasure , to restore her son . '
213425	213428	213430	213432	the paralytic woman	6751	' Yes , '
213462	213933	213934	213934	He	6752	' yes , this is Lord Maulevrier . You have heard the truth , and from his own lips . You , his only son 's only son . You his granddaughter 's husband . You hear him avow himself the instigator of a diabolical murder ; you hear him confess how his paramour 's husband was strangled at his false wife 's bidding , in his own palace , buried under the Moorish pavement in the hall of many arches . You hear how he inherited the Rajah 's treasures from a mistress who died strangely , swiftly , conveniently , as soon so he had wearied of her , and a new favourite had begun to exercise her influence . Such things are done in the East dynasties annihilated , kingdoms overthrown , poison or bowstring used at will , to gratify a profligate 's passion , or pay for a spendthrift 's extravagances . Such things were done when that man was Governor of Madras as were never done by an Englishman in India before his time . He went there fettered by no prejudices he was more Mussulman than the Mussulmen themselves a deeper , darker traitor . And it was to hide such crimes as these to interpose the great peacemaker Death between him and the Government which was resolved upon punishing him to save the honour , the fortune of my son , and the children who were to come after him , the name of a noble race , a name that was ever stainless until he defiled it it was for this great end I took steps to hide that feeble , useless life of his from the world he had offended ; it was for this end that I caused a peasant to be buried in the vault of the Maulevriers , with all the pomp and ceremony that befits the funeral of one of England 's oldest earls . I screened him from his enemies I saved him from the ignominy of a public trial from the execration of his countrymen . His only punishment was to eat his heart under this roof , in luxurious seclusion , his comfort studied , his whims gratified so far as they could be by the most faithful of servants . A light penance for the dark infamies of his life in India , I think . His mind was all but gone when he came here , but he had his rational intervals , and in these the burden of his lonely life may have weighed heavily upon him . But it was not such a heavy burden as I have borne I , his gaoler , I who have devoted my existence to the one task of guarding the family honour . '
214031	214037	214038	214038	he	6752	' My pipe , Steadman , '
214046	214052	214038	214038	he	6752	' bring me my pipe , '
214058	214073	214038	214038	he	6752	' What has become of Steadman ? He has been getting inattentive very inattentive . '
214150	214157	214158	214158	he	6752	' And so , Lady Maulevrier , '
214166	214212	214158	214158	he	6752	' I have borne a title that never belonged to me , and enjoyed the possession of another man 's estates all this time , thanks to your pretty little plot . A very respectable position for your grandson to occupy , upon my life ! '
214223	214227	214228	214228	he	443	' Spare her , '
214231	214242	214228	214228	he	443	' She is in no condition to endure your reproaches . '
214870	214875	214877	214878	the doctor	1088	' Brain quite gone , '
214880	214909	214877	214878	the doctor	1088	' bodily health very poor . Take him to the South of France for the winter Hyeres , or any quiet place . He ca n't last long . '
