353	358	351	351	himself	136	" Here they are . "
714	723	697	698	the crowd	249	" Where do you come from , citoyen ? "
725	734	735	735	Peyrol	136	" From the other side of the world , "
1059	1065	1072	1072	his	136	" gold - laced lot . "
1146	1191	1134	1135	That officer	291	" As a matter of fact you have been the best part of your life skimming the seas , if the truth were known . You must have been a deserter from the Navy at one time , whatever you may call yourself now . "
1206	1224	1225	1225	he	291	" If there was anything of the sort it was in the time of kings and aristocrats , "
1229	1323	1324	1324	He	291	" And now I have brought in a prize , and a service letter from Citizen Renaud , commanding in the Indian Seas . I can also give you the names of good republicans in this town who know my sentiments . Nobody can say I was ever anti - revolutionary in my life . I knocked about the Eastern seas for forty - five years - that 's true . But let me observe that it was the seamen who stayed at home that let the English into the Port of Toulon . "
1332	1376	1324	1324	He	291	" When one thinks of that , citoyen Commandant , any little slips I and fellows of my kind may have made five thousand leagues from here and twenty years ago can not have much importance in these times of equality and fraternity . "
1377	1382	1384	1391	the post - captain in the shabby coat	292	" As to fraternity , "
1393	1412	1384	1391	the post - captain in the shabby coat	292	" the only one you are familiar with is the Brotherhood of the Coast , I should say . "
1413	1427	1431	1432	Citizen Peyrol	136	" Everybody in the Indian Ocean except milksops and youngsters had to be , "
1434	1463	1431	1432	Citizen Peyrol	136	" And we practised republican principles long before a republic was thought of ; for the Brothers of the Coast were all equal and elected their own chiefs . "
1464	1474	1476	1477	the officer	293	" They were an abominable lot of lawless ruffians , "
1486	1495	1483	1483	his	293	" You will not dare to deny that . "
1855	1872	1846	1848	the friendly farmer	314	" Ah , we are not so young as we used to be - you and I. "
1874	1882	1884	1885	Citizen Peyrol	136	" I have also an awkward wound , "
2897	2908	2909	2909	he	136	" Yes , it must be somewhere in that direction , "
3002	3008	2996	2996	she	388	" H ! La mre , "
3012	3029	3030	3030	He	136	" Have you got a man to lend a hand with my chest into the house ? "
3047	3061	3038	3038	she	388	" Mais oui , citoyen . He will be here in a moment . "
3205	3212	3213	3213	he	136	" Tell me , my friend , "
3235	3244	3213	3213	he	136	" does n't this track lead to Almanarre ? "
3245	3248	3250	3251	the labourer	399	" Yes , "
3271	3295	3257	3258	The man	400	" To Almanarre and further too , beyond the great pond right out to the end of the land , to Cape Esterel . "
3305	3314	3315	3315	he	136	" If I had stayed in this country , "
3318	3327	3315	3315	he	136	" I would be talking like this fellow . "
3333	3347	3330	3330	he	136	" Are there any houses there , at the end of the land ? "
3348	3380	3381	3382	Citizen Peyrol	136	" Why , a hamlet , a hole , just a few houses round a church and a farm where at one time they would give you a glass of wine . "
5486	5490	5492	5492	Peyrol	136	" And you , "
5494	5501	5492	5492	Peyrol	136	" you have no land then ? "
5510	5516	5505	5505	his	400	" I have a boat . "
5567	5573	5575	5576	the man	400	" There is fish there , "
5578	5588	5590	5590	Peyrol	136	" And is the boat all your worldly goods ? "
5612	5629	5630	5631	the man	400	" I have a sort of hut down by the lagoon and a net or two , "
5649	5654	5638	5638	Peyrol	136	" And this dog . "
5664	5669	5655	5656	The man	400	" He is company . "
5678	5689	5690	5690	he	136	" You have n't much to make a living of , "
5696	5733	5690	5690	he	136	" However ! . . . Is there no inn , caf , or some place where one could put up for a day ? I have heard up inland that there was some such place . "
5734	5742	5744	5745	the man	400	" I will show it to you , "
5902	5908	5910	5910	Peyrol	136	" Will they lodge me there "
5912	5992	5910	5910	Peyrol	136	" I do n't know . They will have plenty of room , that 's certain . There are no travellers here . But as for a place of refreshment , it used to be that . You have only got to walk in . If he is n't there , the mistress is sure to be there to serve you . She belongs to the place . She was born on it . We know all about her . "
5993	6001	6003	6004	Citizen Peyrol	136	" What sort of woman is she ? "
6018	6035	6003	6004	Citizen Peyrol	136	" Well , you are going there . You shall soon see . She is young . "
6036	6041	6043	6043	Peyrol	136	" And the husband ? "
6068	6089	6090	6091	The other	506	" Why are you staring at me like this ? I have n't got a black skin , have I ? "
6223	6284	6285	6285	Astonishment	118	" For an aristocrat you do n't look like one , but neither do you look like a farmer or a pedlar or a patriot . You do n't look like anything that has been seen here for years and years and years . You look like one , I dare hardly say what . You might be a priest . "
6294	6299	6300	6300	he	136	" Do I dream ? "
6305	6311	6312	6312	he	136	" You are n't mad ? "
6316	6333	6312	6312	he	136	" Do you know what you are talking about ? Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? "
6334	6339	6341	6342	the other	506	" All the same , "
6345	6375	6341	6342	the other	506	" it is much less than ten years ago since I saw one of them of the sort they call bishops , who had a face exactly like yours . "
6420	6461	6413	6413	he	536	" Others too . . . . I remember perfectly . . . . It is n't so many years ago . Some of them skulk amongst the villages yet , for all the chasing they got from the patriots . "
6601	6610	6611	6611	he	136	" Well , it ca n't be helped , "
6614	6632	6611	6611	he	136	" I learned to shave from the English . I suppose that 's what 's the matter . "
6646	6658	6659	6659	he	257	" One ca n't tell where they are all gone to , "
6662	6717	6659	6659	he	257	" Only three years ago they swarmed about this coast in their big ships . You saw nothing but them , and they were fighting all round Toulon on land . Then in a week or two , crac ! - nobody ! Cleared out devil knows where . But perhaps you would know . "
6718	6723	6725	6725	Peyrol	136	" Oh , yes , "
6727	6742	6725	6725	Peyrol	136	" I know all about the English , do n't you worry your head . "
6743	6779	6659	6659	he	257	" I am not troubling my head . It is for you to think about what 's best to say when you speak with him up there . I mean the master of the farm . "
6780	6798	6800	6800	Peyrol	136	" He ca n't be a better patriot than I am , for all my shaven face , "
6802	6814	6800	6800	Peyrol	136	" That would only seem strange to a savage like you . "
6851	6858	6860	6865	the forlorn fisherman from the lagoon	548	" We are all savages here , "
6867	7008	6860	6865	the forlorn fisherman from the lagoon	548	" But the master up there is a real patriot from the town . If you were ever to go to Toulon and ask people about him they would tell you . He first became busy purveying the guillotine when they were purifying the town from all aristocrats . That was even before the English came in . After the English got driven out there was more of that work than the guillotine could do . They had to kill traitors in the streets , in cellars , in their beds . The corpses of men and women were lying in heaps along the quays . There were a good many of his sort that got the name of drinkers of blood . Well , he was one of the best of them . I am only just telling you . "
7012	7020	7021	7021	he	136	" That will do me all right , "
7184	7189	7191	7191	Peyrol	136	" Bonjour , citoyenne , "
7212	7215	7205	7205	she	558	" bonjour , "
7260	7268	7269	7269	he	136	" I am thirsty , of course , "
7272	7287	7269	7269	he	136	" but what I really want is to know whether I can stay here . "
7307	7348	7302	7303	the woman	561	" She is only going to the shed . She knows the way . As to what you said , the master will be here directly . Nobody ever comes here . And how long would you want to stay ? "
7360	7380	7381	7381	She	561	" To tell you the truth , citoyenne , it may be in a manner of speaking for ever . "
7418	7424	7425	7425	she	561	" It 's like me , "
7428	7436	7425	7425	she	561	" I lived as a child here . "
7437	7447	7449	7449	Peyrol	136	" You are but little more than that now , "
7474	7480	7481	7481	she	561	" Are you a patriot ? "
7501	7509	7493	7493	Peyrol	136	" done with all that damned nonsense , "
7521	7527	7528	7528	he	136	" I am a Frenchman , "
7532	7535	7538	7540	an aged woman	566	" Arlette ! "
7549	7555	7556	7556	she	561	" What do you want ? "
7560	7571	7556	7556	she	561	" There 's a saddled mule come into the yard . "
7572	7581	7582	7582	Her	561	" All right . The man is here . "
7616	7629	7601	7601	She	561	" Have you ever carried a woman 's head on a pike ? "
7679	7708	7709	7709	She	561	" No . I have heard men boast of having done so . They were mostly braggarts with craven hearts . But what is all this to you ? "
8000	8022	8028	8032	the man of violent deeds	577	" Yes . You may stay . I think we shall be friends . I 'll tell you about the Revolution . "
8047	8055	8056	8056	he	136	" What 's the good of that ? "
8059	8064	8065	8065	she	561	" It must be , "
8139	8147	8148	8148	he	136	" A bottle of wine , please , "
8275	8282	8260	8260	his	136	" J'en ai vu bien d'autres . "
8908	8911	8902	8902	his	136	" Salut . "
8918	8921	8912	8913	The other	506	" Salut , "
9165	9330	9151	9151	He	136	" You may have ! But you may all the same be corrupt . The seamen of the Republic were eaten up with corruption paid for with the gold of the tyrants . Who would have guessed it ? They all talked like patriots . And yet the English entered the harbour and landed in the town without opposition . The armies of the Republic drove them out , but treachery stalks in the land , it comes up out of the ground , it sits at our hearthstones , lurks in the bosom of the representatives of the people , of our fathers , of our brothers . There was a time when civic virtue flourished , but now it has got to hide its head . And I will tell you why : there has not been enough killing . It seems as if there could never be enough of it . It 's discouraging . Look what we have come to . "
9347	9354	9356	9356	Peyrol	136	" Bring another glass , citoyen , "
9363	9392	9356	9356	Peyrol	136	" and let 's drink together . We will drink to the confusion of traitors . I detest treachery as much as any man , but . . . "
9426	9502	9418	9418	he	136	" But you see I have nothing to do with your politics . I was at the other side of the world , therefore you ca n't suspect me of being a traitor . You showed no mercy , you other sans - culottes , to the enemies of the Republic at home , and I killed her enemies abroad , far away . You were cutting off heads without much compunction . . . . "
9520	9525	9526	9526	he	632	" Yes , yes , "
9531	9538	9526	9526	he	632	" Pity may be a crime . "
9539	9579	9580	9583	The master of Escampobar	633	" Yes . And I knocked the enemies of the Republic on the head whenever I had them before me without inquiring about the number . It seems to me that you and I ought to get on together . "
9740	9747	9752	9752	he	136	" Where do you come from ? "
9755	9763	9752	9752	he	136	" I left Toulon two days ago . "
9782	9803	9804	9804	he	123	" And that was the town of which by a decree not a stone upon another was to be left , "
9810	9818	9819	9819	Peyrol	136	" Most of it is still standing , "
9824	9869	9819	9819	Peyrol	136	" I do n't know whether it deserved the fate you say was decreed for it . I was there for the last month or so and I know it contains some good patriots . I know because I made friends with them all . "
9909	9924	9925	9925	he	136	" Come along and I will show you the place where you will sleep , "
10023	10031	10033	10034	his guide	649	" You will eat with us here , "
10122	10131	10133	10134	the master	2770	" We could arrange this place for you , "
10136	10150	10151	10151	he	2770	" but I do n't know what the mistress will have to say , "
10303	10310	10296	10296	he	571	" That 's all right then , "
10380	10394	10396	10399	Peyrol 's future host	667	" You have a view of salt water on three sides of you , "
10540	10549	10551	10551	Peyrol	136	" It 's like being in a lighthouse , "
10553	10565	10551	10551	Peyrol	136	" Not a bad place for a seaman to live in . "
10928	10934	10936	10936	Peyrol	136	" Tell me , patron , "
10938	10966	10936	10936	Peyrol	136	" is there anywhere near this house a little dent in the shore with a bit of beach in it perhaps where I could keep a boat ? "
10967	10976	10936	10936	Peyrol	136	" What do you want a boat for ? "
10977	10988	10990	10990	Peyrol	136	" To go fishing when I have a fancy to , "
11131	11141	11143	11144	the patriot	701	" It was when their fleet first came here , "
11150	11208	11143	11144	the patriot	701	" and hung round the coast before the anti - revolutionary traitors let them into Toulon , sold the sacred soil of their country for a handful of gold . Yes , in the days before the crime was consummated English officers used to land in that cove at night and walk up to this very house . "
11209	11213	11215	11215	Peyrol	136	" What audacity ! "
11222	11232	11215	11215	Peyrol	136	" But that 's just like what they are . "
11260	11270	11271	11271	he	701	" I swore to its truth before the tribunal , "
11274	11281	11282	11282	he	701	" It was a dark story , "
11289	11297	11298	11298	he	701	" It cost her father his life , "
11307	11319	11320	11320	he	701	" her mother too - but the country was in danger , "
11395	11408	11409	11409	he	136	" Did you actually drag him from this house to the guillotine ? "
11426	11503	11419	11419	his	701	" No , he came over to Toulon just before the evacuation , this friend of the English . . . sailed over in a tartane he owned that is still lying here at the Madrague . He had his wife with him . They came over to take home their daughter who was living then with some skulking old nuns . The victorious Republicans were closing in and the slaves of tyranny had to fly . "
11504	11511	11513	11513	Peyrol	136	" Came to fetch their daughter , "
11515	11525	11513	11513	Peyrol	136	" Strange , that guilty people should . . . "
11532	11537	11538	11538	he	136	" It was justice , "
11542	11569	11538	11538	he	136	" They were anti - revolutionists , and if they had never spoken to an Englishman in their life the atrocious crime was on their heads . "
11570	11580	11582	11582	Peyrol	136	" H'm , stayed too long for their daughter , "
11584	11595	11582	11582	Peyrol	136	" And so it was you who brought her home . "
11596	11600	11602	11603	the patron	710	" I did , "
11627	11638	11639	11639	he	710	" No lessons of base superstition could corrupt her soul , "
11644	11651	11639	11639	he	710	" I brought home a patriot . "
11664	11667	11668	11668	he	710	" Well , "
11671	11730	11731	11731	he	710	" all this wo n't prevent me sleeping wery well in this room . I always thought I would like to live in a lighthouse when I got tired of roving about the seas . This is as near a lighthouse lantern as can be . You will see me with all my little affairs to - morrow , "
11739	11744	11731	11731	he	710	" Salut , citoyen . "
13579	13583	13569	13570	old Catherine	127	" bonne mine . "
14235	14242	14244	14246	the young man	821	" Does that fellow never rest ? "
14267	14273	14275	14276	the rover	822	" Not on Sunday anyhow , "
14283	14316	14317	14317	he	823	" What can you expect ? The church bell is like poison to him . That fellow , I verily believe , has been born a sans - culotte . Every ` dcadi "
14355	14356	14346	14347	A Jacobin	825	" "
14391	14392	14378	14380	some of them	2735	" "
14442	14453	14378	14380	some of them	2735	" Peyrol turned slightly towards the young man . . . "
14463	14492	14378	14380	some of them	2735	" The officer nodded , and for a moment his face wore a troubled expression which did not escape the notice of Peyrol who went on speaking easily : "
14512	14526	14528	14528	you	833	" - Peyrol jerked his head in the direction of the salle door - "
14639	14771	14772	14772	He	843	" Out rushed some of them , and a man or two that were working in their home patches vaulted over the low walls . Pretty soon there was a crowd , mostly women , each with the first thing she could snatch up - stick , kitchen knife , anything . A few men with spades and cudgels joined them by the water - trough . He did n't quite like that . What could he do ? He turned and bolted up the hill , like a hare . It takes some pluck to face a mob of angry women . He ran along the cart track without looking behind him , and they after him , yelling : ` A mort ! A mort le buveur de sang ! "
15214	15238	15199	15199	she	857	" When Peyrol ceased , the ringing of the church bell went on faintly and then stopped as abruptly as it had begun . "
15244	15251	15199	15199	she	857	" said the young officer indolently , "
15257	15266	15199	15199	she	857	" Old Peyrol made a really pronounced movement . "
15272	15276	15199	15199	she	857	" he asked . "
15279	15280	15281	15281	I	0	" "
15339	15340	15330	15330	I	0	" "
15350	15355	15341	15341	One	2670	" growled old Peyrol . "
15389	15390	15391	15392	The patronne	857	" "
15394	15402	15391	15392	The patronne	857	" exclaimed Peyrol in a low voice , "
15405	15406	15391	15392	The patronne	857	" "
15428	15434	15435	15435	You	0	" asked the officer composedly . "
15482	15483	15473	15473	I	0	" "
15489	15499	15485	15485	you	0	" asked Peyrol after a moment of visible hesitation . "
15527	15532	15521	15521	Moreover	130	" he added grimly , "
15571	15585	15537	15541	somebody with a good conscience	877	" He glanced out of the corner of his eyes at old Peyrol . "
15593	15594	15595	15595	She	881	" "
15604	15619	15595	15595	She	881	" murmured Peyrol , with an uneasiness which he did not attempt to conceal . "
15712	15713	15693	15693	them	884	" "
15722	15727	15714	15715	The fellow	536	" said Peyrol earnestly . "
15736	15742	15714	15715	The fellow	536	" went on the officer , "
15760	15770	15771	15771	Lieutenant	888	" Peyrol , excited , lowered his voice forcibly . "
15773	15777	15771	15771	Lieutenant	888	" he said , "
15810	15828	15829	15829	I	0	" The lieutenant glanced sideways again and Peyrol let his raised fist fall heavily on his thigh . "
15884	15897	15904	15904	you	888	" A bitterly mocking smile touched the lips of the young man . "
15926	15946	15947	15947	You	888	" Without unfolding his arms he turned towards Peyrol , who was looking at him anxiously . . . . "
16050	16078	16043	16043	I	0	" Peyrol , with his elbow on his knee , leaned his head in the palm of his hand . The officer repeated through his clenched teeth : "
16085	16158	16043	16043	I	0	" Peyrol shook his head slightly . After having spoken , the young officer leaned back against the wall , but next moment the report of a piece of ordnance reached them as it were from below , travelling around the rising ground to the left in the form of a dull thud followed by a sighing sound that seemed to seek an issue amongst the stony ridges and rocks near by . "
16179	16212	16213	16213	She	898	" said the young officer , picking up his sword hastily . He stood up and buckled the belt on , while Peyrol rose more deliberately from the bench , and said : "
16272	16334	16265	16265	We	899	" He strode off , followed by Peyrol . There was not a human being in sight about the farm and not a sound of life except for the lowing of a cow coming faintly from behind a wall . Peyrol kept close behind the quickly moving officer who followed the footpath marked faintly on the stony slope of the hill . "
16341	16358	16359	16359	You	900	" he observed suddenly in a deep steady voice . The officer glanced over his shoulder . "
16404	16427	16428	16428	She	898	" He moved on , Peyrol following him on the awkward path without losing his wind and arguing in a steady voice : "
16444	16445	16433	16433	she	898	" "
16448	16457	16433	16433	she	898	" retorted the officer without checking his pace . "
16614	16620	16595	16595	you	914	" Peyrol growled in answer : "
16637	16638	16631	16631	She	898	" "
16685	16686	16735	16735	she	898	" "
16689	16697	16735	16735	she	898	" said Peyrol , stepping out steadily . "
16713	16714	16715	16715	You	0	" "
16720	16726	16715	16715	You	0	" The officer stopped suddenly . "
16754	16765	16735	16735	she	898	" Peyrol 's face expressed no emotion of any sort . "
16773	16780	16735	16735	she	898	" continued the officer with animation . "
16790	16798	16735	16735	she	898	" Peyrol said without the slightest excitement , "
16862	16891	16855	16855	They	115	" After uttering those words with a deliberation made venerable by his white hair , Peyrol made the gesture of wiping his brow , which was barely moist . "
16897	16903	16855	16855	They	115	" said the lieutenant abruptly . "
16909	16915	16855	16855	They	115	" argued Peyrol without moving . "
16930	16931	16934	16934	they	922	" "
16936	16942	16934	16934	they	922	" burst out the officer . "
16966	17537	17539	17539	he	926	" And he strode away before Peyrol could utter a word . The path following the contour of the hill took a turn towards its sea - face and very soon the lieutenant passed out of sight with startling suddenness . Then his head reappeared for a moment , only his head , and that too vanished suddenly . Peyrol remained perplexed . After gazing in the direction in which the officer had disappeared , he looked down at the farm buildings , now below him but not at a very great distance . He could see distinctly the pigeons walking on the roof ridges . Somebody was drawing water from the well in the middle of the yard . The patron , no doubt ; but that man , who at one time had the power to send so many luckless persons to their death , did not count for old Peyrol . He had even ceased to be an offence to his sight and a disturber of his feelings . By himself he was nothing . He had never been anything but a creature of the universal blood - lust of the time . The very doubts about him had died out by now in old Peyrol 's breast . The fellow was so insignificant that had Peyrol in a moment of particular attention discovered that he cast no shadow , he would not have been surprised . Below there he was reduced to the shape of a dwarf lugging a bucket away from the well . But where was she ? Peyrol asked himself , shading his eyes with his hand . He knew that the patronne could not be very far away , because he had a sight of her during the morning ; but that was before he had learned she had taken to roaming at night . His growing uneasiness came suddenly to an end when , turning his eyes away from the farm buildings , where obviously she was not , he saw her appear , with nothing but the sky full of light at her back , coming down round the very turn of the path which had taken the lieutenant out of sight . Peyrol moved briskly towards her . He was n't a man to lose time in idle wonder , and his sabots did not seem to weigh heavy on his feet . The fermire , whom the villagers down there spoke of as Arlette as though she had been a little girl , but in a strange tone of shocked awe , walked with her head drooping and her feet as Peyrol used to say touching the ground as lightly as falling leaves . The clatter of the clogs made her raise her black , clear eyes that had been smitten on the very verge of womanhood by such sights of bloodshed and terror , as to leave in her a fear of looking steadily in any direction for long , lest she should see coming through the empty air some mutilated vision of the dead . Peyrol called it trying not to see something that was not there ; and this evasive yet frank mobility was so much a part of her being that the steadiness with which she met his inquisitive glance surprised old Peyrol for a moment . He asked without beating about the bush : "
17544	17564	17565	17565	He	926	" She answered with something airy and provoking in her voice , which also struck Peyrol as a novelty : "
17579	17591	17569	17569	He	926	" - and then they both looked away from each other . "
17608	17636	17597	17597	you	927	" She did not expect that question . She hung her head and took a pleat of her skirt between her fingers , embarrassed like a child . "
17642	17660	17639	17639	I	0	" she murmured in a low shy note , as if she had two voices within her . "
17666	17667	17663	17663	Catherine	127	" "
17685	17686	17668	17668	She	127	" "
17692	17698	17688	17688	she	127	" asked Peyrol with incredulity . "
17701	17719	17722	17722	she	127	" Arlette gave Peyrol a queer , meaningless smile with which her eyes had nothing to do . "
17744	17745	17732	17732	She	127	" "
17753	17782	17732	17732	She	127	" Peyrol tried to catch her eyes , but they eluded him in the usual way . And now her face looked as though it could n't smile . "
17786	18005	18006	18006	Squat	132	" she said . For a moment Peyrol lost his tongue and even all power of motion . The fermire having lowered her eyelids , all her life seemed to have gone into her coral lips , vivid and without a quiver in the perfection of their design , and Peyrol , giving up the conversation with an upward fling of his arm , hurried up the path without looking behind him . But once round the turn of the path , he approached the lookout at an easier gait . It was a piece of smooth ground below the summit of the hill . It had quite a pronounced slope , so that a short and robust pine growing true out of the soil yet leaned well over the edge of the sheer drop of some fifty feet or so . The first thing that Peyrol 's eyes took in was the water of the Petite Passe with the enormous shadow of the Porquerolles Island darkening more than half of its width at this still early hour . He could not see the whole of it , but on the part his glance embraced there was no ship of any kind . The lieutenant , leaning with his chest along the inclined pine , addressed him irritably . "
18020	18100	18009	18009	you	132	" Peyrol obeyed without a word and for the space of a minute or so presented the bizarre sight of a rather bulky peasant with venerable white locks crawling on his hands and knees on a hillside for no visible reason . When he got to the foot of the pine he raised himself on his knees . The lieutenant , flattened against the inclined trunk and with a pocket - glass glued to his eye , growled angrily : "
18111	18216	18101	18101	You	132	" Peyrol in his kneeling position could see the ship now . She was less than a quarter of a mile from him up the coast , almost within hailing effort of his powerful voice . His unaided eyes could follow the movements of the men on board like dark dots about her decks . She had drifted so far within Cape Esterel that the low projecting mass of it seemed to be in actual contact with her stern . Her unexpected nearness made Peyrol draw a sharp breath through his teeth . The lieutenant murmured , still keeping the glass to his eye : "
18232	18851	18101	18101	You	132	" As Peyrol and the lieutenant had surmised from the report of the gun , the English ship which the evening before was lying in Hyres Roads had got under way after dark . The light airs had taken her as far as the Petite Passe in the early part of the night , and then had abandoned her to the breathless moonlight in which , bereft of all motion , she looked more like a white monument of stone dwarfed by the darkling masses of land on either hand than a fabric famed for its swiftness in attack or in flight . Her captain was a man of about forty , with clean - shaven , full cheeks and mobile thin lips which he had a trick of compressing mysteriously before he spoke and sometimes also at the end of his speeches . He was alert in his movements and nocturnal in his habits . Directly he found that the calm had taken complete possession of the night and was going to last for hours , Captain Vincent assumed his favourite attitude of leaning over the rail . It was then some time after midnight and in the pervading stillness the moon , riding on a speckless sky , seemed to pour her enchantment on an uninhabited planet . Captain Vincent did not mind the moon very much . Of course it made his ship visible from both shores of the Petite Passe . But after nearly a year of constant service in command of the extreme lookout ship of Admiral Nelson 's blockading fleet he knew the emplacement of almost every gun of the shore defences . Where the breeze had left him he was safe from the biggest gun of the few that were mounted on Porquerolles . On the Giens side of the pass he knew for certain there was not even a popgun mounted anywhere . His long familiarity with that part of the coast had imbued him with the belief that he knew the habits of its population thoroughly . The gleams of light in their houses went out very early and Captain Vincent felt convinced that they were all in their beds , including the gunners of the batteries who belonged to the local militia . Their interest in the movements of H.M. 's twenty - two gun sloop Amelia a had grown stale by custom . She never interfered with their private affairs , and allowed the small coasting craft to go to and fro unmolested . They would have wondered if she had been more than two days away . Captain Vincent used to say grimly that the Hyres roadstead had become like a second home to him . For an hour or so Captain Vincent mused a bit on his real home , on matters of service and other unrelated things , then getting into motion in a very wide - awake manner , he superintended himself the dispatch of that boat the existence of which had been acutely surmised by Lieutenant Ral and was a matter of no doubt whatever to old Peyrol . As to her mission , it had nothing to do with catching fish for the captain 's breakfast . It was the captain 's own gig , a very fast - pulling boat . She was already alongside with her crew in her when the officer , who was going in charge , was beckoned to by the captain . He had a cutlass at his side and a brace of pistols in his belt , and there was a businesslike air about him that showed he had been on such service before . "
18861	18866	18101	18101	You	132	" said the captain . "
18898	18899	18902	18902	sir	935	" "
18909	18910	18954	18955	Mr. Bolt	137	" "
18980	19263	18972	18972	I	0	" Captain Vincent paused suddenly . A doubt crossed his mind as to the wisdom of this nocturnal expedition . The hammer - head of the peninsula with its sea - face invisible from both sides of the coast was an ideal spot for a secret landing . Its lonely character appealed to his imagination , which in the first instance had been stimulated by a chance remark of Mr. Bolt himself . The fact was that the week before , when the Amelia was cruising off the peninsula , Bolt , looking at the coast , mentioned that he knew that part of it well ; he had actually been ashore there a good many years ago , while serving with Lord Howe 's fleet . He described the nature of the path , the aspect of a little village on the reverse slope , and had much to say about a certain farmhouse where he had been more than once , and had even stayed for twenty - four hours at a time on more than one occasion . This had aroused Captain Vincent 's curiosity . He sent for Bolt and had a long conversation with him . He listened with great interest to Bolt 's story - how one day a man was seen from the deck of the ship in which Bolt was serving then , waving a white sheet or table - cloth amongst the rocks at the water 's edge . It might have been a trap ; but , as the man seemed alone and the shore was within range of the ship 's guns , a boat was sent to take him off . "
19269	19274	19267	19267	sir	935	" Bolt pursued impressively , "
19295	20147	20148	20148	You	942	" Afterwards Bolt described to Captain Vincent the meetings of the Toulon royalists with the officers of the fleet . From the back of the farm he , Bolt himself , had often watched for hours the entrance of the Toulon harbour on the lookout for the boat bringing over the royalist emissaries . Then he would make an agreed signal to the advanced squadron and some English officers would land on their side and meet the Frenchmen at the farmhouse . It was as simple as that . The people of the farmhouse , husband and wife , were well - to - do , good class altogether , and staunch royalists . He had got to know them well . Captain Vincent wondered whether the same people were still living there . Bolt could see no reason why they should n't be . It was n't more than ten years ago , and they were by no means an old couple . As far as he could make out , the farm was their own property . He , Bolt , knew only very few French words at that time . It was much later , after he had been made a prisoner and kept inland in France till the Peace of Amiens , that he had picked up a smattering of the lingo . His captivity had done away with his feeble chance of promotion , he could not help remarking . Bolt was a master 's mate still . Captain Vincent , in common with a good many officers of all ranks in Lord Nelson 's fleet , had his misgivings about the system of distant blockade from which the Admiral apparently would not depart . Yet one could not blame Lord Nelson . Everybody in the fleet understood that what was in his mind was the destruction of the enemy ; and if the enemy was closely blockaded he would never come out to be destroyed . On the other hand it was clear that as things were conducted the French had too many chances left them to slip out unobserved and vanish from all human knowledge for months . Those possibilities were a constant worry to Captain Vincent , who had thrown himself with the ardour of passion into the special duty with which he was entrusted . Oh , for a pair of eyes fastened night and day on the entrance of the harbour of Toulon ! Oh , for the power to look at the very state of French ships and into the very secrets of French minds ! But he said nothing of this to Bolt . He only observed that the character of the French Government was changed and that the minds of the royalist people in the farmhouse might have changed too , since they had got back the exercise of their religion . Bolt 's answer was that he had had a lot to do with royalists , in his time , on board Lord Howe 's fleet , both before and after Toulon was evacuated . All sorts , men and women , barbers and noblemen , sailors and tradesmen ; almost every kind of royalist one could think of ; and his opinion was that a royalist never changed . As to the place itself , he only wished the captain had seen it . It was the sort of spot that nothing could change . He made bold to say that it would be just the same a hundred years hence . The earnestness of his officer caused Captain Vincent to look hard at him . He was a man of about his own age , but while Vincent was a comparatively young captain , Bolt was an old master 's mate . Each understood the other perfectly . Captain Vincent fidgeted for a while and then observed abstractedly that he was not a man to put a noose round a dog 's neck , let alone a good seaman 's . This cryptic pronouncement caused no wonder to appear in Bolt 's attentive gaze . He only became a little thoughtful before he said in the same abstracted tone that an officer in uniform was not likely to be hanged for a spy . The service was risky , of course . It was necessary , for its success , that , assuming the same people were there , it should be undertaken by a man well known to the inhabitants . Then he added that he was certain of being recognized . And while he enlarged on the extremely good terms he had been on with the owners of the farm , especially the farmer 's wife , a comely motherly woman , who had been very kind to him , and had all her wits about her , Captain Vincent , looking at the master 's mate 's bushy whiskers , thought that these in themselves were enough to insure recognition . This impression was so strong that he asked point - blank : "
20167	20214	20161	20162	Mr. Bolt	137	" There was just a touch of indignation in Bolt 's negative reply ; for he was proud of his whiskers . He declared he was ready to take the most desperate chances for the service of his king and his country . Captain Vincent added : "
20224	20596	20219	20220	Lord Nelson	141	" One understood well what his Lordship wished to bring about by that blockade at sixty leagues off . He was talking to a sailor , and there was no need to say any more . Did Bolt think that he could persuade those people to conceal him in their house on that lonely shore end of the peninsula for some considerable time ? Bolt thought it was the easiest thing in the world . He would simply go up there and renew the old acquaintance , but he did not mean to do that in a reckless manner . It would have to be done at night , when of course there would be no one about . He would land just where he used to before , wrapped up in a Mediterranean sailor 's cloak - he had one of his own - over his uniform , and simply go straight to the door , at which he would knock . Ten to one the farmer himself would come down to open it . He knew enough French by now , he hoped , to persuade those people to conceal him in some room having a view in the right direction ; and there he would stick day after day on the watch , taking a little exercise in the middle of the night , ready to live on mere bread and water if necessary , so as not to arouse suspicion amongst the farmhands . And who knows if , with the farmer 's help , he could not get some news of what was going on actually within the port . Then from time to time he could go down in the dead of night , signal to the ship and make his report . Bolt expressed the hope that the Amelia would remain as much as possible in sight of the coast . It would cheer him up to see her about . Captain Vincent naturally assented . He pointed out to Bolt , however , that his post would become most important exactly when the ship had been chased away or driven by the weather off her station , as could very easily happen . - "
20625	20924	20620	20621	Lord Nelson	141	" After dispatching his officer , Captain Vincent spent the night on deck . The break of day came at last , much paler than the moonlight which it replaced . And still no boat . And again Captain Vincent asked himself if he had not acted indiscreetly . Impenetrable , and looking as fresh as if he had just come up on deck , he argued the point with himself till the rising sun clearing the ridge on Porquerolles Island flashed its level rays upon his ship with her dew - darkened sails and dripping rigging . He roused himself then to tell his first lieutenant to get the boats out to tow the ship away from the shore . The report of the gun he ordered to be fired expressed simply his irritation . The Amelia , pointing towards the middle of the Passe , was moving at a snail 's pace behind her string of boats . Minutes passed . And then suddenly Captain Vincent perceived his boat pulling back in shore according to orders . When nearly abreast of the ship , she darted away , making for her side . Mr. Bolt clambered on board , alone , ordering the gig to go ahead and help with the towing . Captain Vincent , standing apart on the quarter - deck , received him with a grimly questioning look . Mr. Bolt 's first words were to the effect that he believed the confounded spot to be bewitched . Then he glanced at the group of officers on the other side of the quarter - deck . Captain Vincent led the way to his cabin . There he turned and looked at his officer , who , with an air of distraction , mumbled : "
20932	20933	20927	20930	night - walkers there	946	" "
20954	20955	20946	20946	you	137	" "
20967	20981	20956	20956	I	0	" said Bolt . And encouraged by the captain 's much less ferocious - "
20984	21828	20956	20956	I	0	" began his tale . He did not pull up to the path which he knew , but to a little bit of beach on which he told his men to haul up the boat and wait for him . The beach was concealed by a thick growth of bushes on the landward side and by some rocks from the sea . Then he went to what he called the ravine , still avoiding the path , so that as a matter of fact he made his way up on his hands and knees mostly , very carefully and slowly amongst the loose stones , till by holding on to a bush he brought his eyes on a level with the piece of flat ground in front of the farmhouse . The familiar aspect of the buildings , totally unchanged from the time when he had played his part in what appeared as a most successful operation at the beginning of the war , inspired Bolt with great confidence in the success of his present enterprise , vague as it was , but the great charm of which lay , no doubt , in mental associations with his younger years . Nothing seemed easier than to stride across the forty yards of open ground and rouse the farmer whom he remembered so well , the well - to - do man , a grave sagacious royalist in his humble way ; certainly , in Bolt 's view , no traitor to his country , and preserving so well his dignity in ambiguous circumstances . To Bolt 's simple vision neither that , man nor his wife could have changed . In this view of Arlette 's parents Bolt was influenced by the consciousness of there having been no change in himself . He was the same Jack Bolt , and everything around him was the same as if he had left the spot only yesterday . Already he saw himself in the kitchen which he knew so well , seated by the light of a single candle before a glass of wine and talking his best French to that worthy farmer of sound principles . The whole thing was as well as done . He imagined himself a secret inmate of that building , closely confined indeed , but sustained by the possible great results of his watchfulness , in many ways more comfortable than on board the Amelia and with the glorious consciousness that he was , in Captain Vincent 's phrase , the actual physical eyes of the fleet . He did n't , of course , talk of his private feelings to Captain Vincent . All those thoughts and emotions were compressed in the space of not much more than a minute or two while , holding on with one hand to his bush and having got a good foothold for one of his feet , he indulged in that pleasant anticipatory sense of success . In the old days the farmer 's wife used to be a light sleeper . The farmhands who , he remembered , lived in the village or were distributed in stables and outhouses , did not give him any concern . He would n't need to knock heavily . He pictured to himself the farmer 's wife sitting up in bed , listening , then rousing her husband , who , as likely as not , would take the gun standing against the dresser downstairs and come to the door . And then everything would be all right . . . . But perhaps . . . Yes ! It was just as likely the farmer would simply open the window and hold a parley . That really was most likely . Naturally . In his place Bolt felt he would do that very thing . Yes , that was what a man in a lonely house , in the middle of the night , would do most naturally . And he imagined himself whispering mysteriously his answers up the wall to the obvious questions - Ami - Bolt - Ouvrez - moi - vive le roi - or things of that sort . And in sequence to those vivid images it occurred to Bolt that the best thing he could do would be to throw small stones against the window shutter , the sort of sound most likely to rouse a light sleeper . He was n't quite sure which window on the floor above the ground floor was that of those people 's bedroom , but there were anyhow only three of them . In a moment he would have sprung up from his foothold on to the level if , raising his eyes for another look at the front of the house , he had not perceived that one of the windows was already open . How he could have failed to notice that before he could n't explain . He confessed to Captain Vincent in the course of his narrative that "
21887	22015	22016	22016	I	0	" That fascination of repose , of secretive friendliness , which houses present at night , was gone . By the power of an open window , a black square in the moon - lighted wall , the farmhouse took on the aspect of a man - trap . Bolt assured Captain Vincent that the window would not have stopped him ; he would have gone on all the same , though with an uncertain mind . But while he was thinking it out , there glided without a sound before his irresolute eyes from somewhere a white vision - a woman . He could see her black hair flowing down her back . A woman whom anybody would have been excused for taking for a ghost . "
22147	22155	22132	22132	she	953	" added Bolt in a grim tone . "
22160	22330	22132	22132	she	953	" he conceded charitably . One thing was clear to him : there had been changes in that farmhouse since his time . Bolt resented them , as if that time had been only last week . The woman concealed round the corner remained in his full view , watchful , as if only waiting for him to show himself in the open , to run off screeching and rouse all the countryside . Bolt came quickly to the conclusion that he must withdraw from the slope . On lowering himself from his first position he had the misfortune to dislodge a stone . This circumstance precipitated his retreat . In a very few minutes he found himself by the shore . He paused to listen . Above him , up the ravine and all round amongst the rocks , everything was perfectly still . He walked along in the direction of his boat . There was nothing for it but to get away quietly and perhaps . . . "
22347	22420	22336	22336	I	0	" interrupted Captain Vincent at that point . Bolt 's assent came reluctantly , and then he braced himself to confess that this was not the worst . Before the astonished face of Captain Vincent he hastened to blurt it out . He was very sorry , he could in no way account for it , but - he had lost a man . Captain Vincent seemed unable to believe his ears . "
22436	22727	22423	22423	you	137	" He was profoundly shocked . Bolt was correspondingly distressed . He narrated that , shortly after he had left them , the seamen had heard , or imagined they had heard , some faint and peculiar noises somewhere within the cove . The coxswain sent one of the men , the oldest of the boat 's crew , along the shore to ascertain whether their boat hauled on the beach could be seen from the other side of the cove . The man - it was Symons - departed crawling on his hands and knees to make the circuit and , well - he had not returned . This was really the reason why the boat was so late in getting back to the ship . Of course Bolt did not like to give up the man . It was inconceivable that Symons should have deserted . He had left his cutlass behind and was completely unarmed , but had he been suddenly pounced upon he surely would have been able to let out a yell that could have been heard all over the cove . But till daybreak a profound stillness , in which it seemed a whisper could have been heard for miles , had reigned over the coast . It was as if Symons had been spirited away by some supernatural means , without a scuffle , without a cry . For it was inconceivable that he should have ventured inland and got captured there . It was equally inconceivable that there should have been on that particular night men ready to pounce upon Symons and knock him on the head so neatly as not to let him give a groan even . Captain Vincent said : "
22737	22750	22734	22735	Mr. Bolt	137	" and compressed his lips firmly for a moment before he continued : "
22770	22771	22761	22761	you	137	" "
22795	22804	22778	22778	she	963	" protested Bolt with a sort of desperation . "
22866	22867	22855	22855	she	963	" "
22872	22877	22855	22855	she	963	" suggested Captain Vincent . "
22884	22888	22882	22882	sir	935	" confessed Bolt . "
22897	22909	22894	22895	somebody about	968	" concluded Captain Vincent with assurance . Bolt murmured a reluctant , "
22914	22937	22938	22938	I	0	" He had expected to get into enormous trouble over this affair and was much relieved by the captain 's quiet attitude . "
22958	22959	22943	22943	you	935	" "
22970	22975	22962	22962	You	935	" said the captain . "
23019	23020	23032	23033	Mr. Bolt	137	" "
23035	23041	23032	23033	Mr. Bolt	137	" Captain Vincent declared dryly . "
23065	23066	23032	23033	Mr. Bolt	137	" "
23082	23086	23076	23076	we	971	" Bolt suggested . "
23132	23137	23129	23129	she	978	" he added recklessly . "
23148	23149	23145	23146	a man	278	" "
23161	23167	23154	23159	a man not very far off	980	" said Captain Vincent equably . "
23185	23339	23340	23340	Her	981	" Bolt was glad to obey , for he was tired and hungry after his dismal failure . What vexed him most was its absurdity . Captain Vincent , though he too had passed a sleepless night , felt too restless to remain below . He followed his officer on deck . By that time the Amelia had been towed half a mile or so away from Cape Esterel . This change had brought her nearer to the two watchers on the hillside , who would have been plainly visible to the people on her deck , but for the head of the pine which concealed their movements . Lieutenant Ral , bestriding the rugged trunk as high as he could get , had the whole of the English ship 's deck open to the range of his pocket - glass which he used between the branches . He said to Peyrol suddenly : "
23348	23427	23340	23340	Her	981	" Peyrol , sitting at the foot of the tree , made no answer for a long while . A warm drowsiness lay over the land and seemed to press down his eyelids . But inwardly the old rover was intensely awake . Under the mask of his immobility , with half - shut eyes and idly clasped hands , he heard the lieutenant , perched up there near the head of the tree , mutter counting something : "
23434	23439	23340	23340	Her	981	" and then a loud "
23442	23475	23340	23340	Her	981	" after which the lieutenant in his trunk - bestriding attitude began to jerk himself backwards . Peyrol got up out of his way , but could not restrain himself from asking : "
23482	23483	23484	23484	I	0	" "
23493	23525	23484	23484	I	0	" said the other excitedly . As soon as he got his footing he walked up to old Peyrol and when quite close to him folded his arms across his chest . "
23623	23632	23617	23617	Englishman	43	" He seized Peyrol by both shoulders suddenly . "
23650	23703	23646	23646	I	0	" Peyrol , shaken violently by the shoulders , raised his eyes to look at the angry face within a few inches of his own . In his worn gaze there was no fear or shame , but a troubled perplexity and obvious concern . He remained passive , merely remonstrating softly : "
23708	23737	23706	23706	Doucement	147	" The lieutenant suddenly desisted with a final jerk which failed to stagger old Peyrol , who , directly he had been released , assumed an explanatory tone . "
23794	23844	23779	23780	those Englishmen	995	" Secretly Lieutenant Ral was daunted by Peyrol 's mildness . It could not be shaken . Even physically he had an impression of the utter futility of his effort , as though he had tried to shake a rock . He threw himself on the ground carelessly saying : "
23849	23862	23779	23780	those Englishmen	995	" Peyrol lowered himself with a deliberation appropriate to his grey hairs . "
23981	23982	23983	23983	I	0	" "
23995	24037	24051	24051	themselves	1004	" A sudden thought seemed to strike the lieutenant , a thought so intense and far - fetched as to give his mental effort a momentary aspect of vacancy . He shook it off and went on in a changed tone : "
24053	24054	24051	24051	themselves	1004	" "
24148	24161	24139	24139	I	0	" The lieutenant was recovering from the spell of that sudden thought . "
24167	24173	24139	24139	I	0	" he muttered to himself . "
24181	24211	24212	24212	I	0	" His parted lips came together in a slightly sarcastic smile with which he met Peyrol 's puzzled , sidelong glance provoked by the inexplicable character of these words . "
24215	24220	24212	24212	I	0	" said the lieutenant , "
24244	24249	24235	24235	your	1013	" Peyrol said simply : "
24313	24346	24300	24302	anybody looking on	1016	" The lieutenant sat up suddenly . By that time the English sloop , getting away from under the land , had become visible even from the spot on which they sat . "
24349	24353	24354	24354	She	1018	" exclaimed Ral . "
24364	24418	24354	24354	She	1018	" Peyrol , startled , raised his eyes and saw the Amelia clear of the edge of the cliff and heading across the Passe . All her boats were already alongside , and yet , as a minute or two of steady gazing was enough to convince Peyrol , she was not stationary . "
24466	24467	24468	24468	I	0	" "
24475	24487	24468	24468	I	0	" muttered the lieutenant , after a pause of intent gazing . "
24504	24522	24491	24491	Peyrol	136	" Peyrol , who had been shading his eyes from the sun , let his hand fall . "
24525	24575	24491	24491	Peyrol	136	" he said , ' she would answer to a child 's breath quicker than a feather , and the English very soon found it out when they got her . She was caught in Genoa only a few months after I came home and got my moorings here . "
24576	24582	24584	24586	the young man	821	" I did n't know , "
24588	24593	24595	24595	Peyrol	136	" Aha , lieutenant , "
24604	24673	24598	24598	his	136	" it hurts here , does n't it ? There is nobody but good Frenchmen here . Do you think it is a pleasure to me to watch that flag out there at her peak ? Look , you can see the whole of her now . Look at her ensign hanging down as if there were not a breath of wind under the heavens . . . . "
24680	24717	24676	24676	his	136	" And yet she moves ! Those in Toulon that may be thinking of catching her dead or alive would have to think hard and make long plans and get good men to carry them out . "
24718	24730	24732	24732	Ral	136	" There was some talk of it at the Toulon Admiralty , "
24740	24751	24752	24752	he	822	" They need not have sent you on the duty , "
24755	24820	24752	24752	he	822	" I have been watching her now for a month , her and the man who has got her now . I know all his tricks and all his habits and all his dodges by this time . The man is a seaman , that must be said for him , but I can tell beforehand what he will do in any given case . "
25533	25559	25521	25521	he	136	" Yes - I know all her moves , though I must say that this trick of dodging close to our peninsula is something new . "
25560	25570	25572	25572	Ral	136	" H'm ! Fish for the captain 's breakfast , "
25578	25584	25572	25572	Ral	136	" Where is she now ? "
25585	25625	25521	25521	he	136	" In the middle of the Passe , busy hoisting in her boats . And still moving ! That ship will keep her way as long as the flame of a candle on her deck will not stand upright . "
25626	25633	25572	25572	Ral	136	" That ship is a marvel . "
25634	25643	25645	25646	old Peyrol	136	" She has been built by French shipwrights , "
25668	25681	25660	25661	the lieutenant	2881	" You are very positive about that . How do you know ? "
25682	25723	25660	25661	the lieutenant	2881	" I have been looking at her for a month , whatever name she might have had or whatever name the English call her by now . Did you ever see such a bow on an English - built ship ? "
25836	25846	25847	25847	he	2881	" Have you ever tasted of prison , Peyrol ? "
25865	25890	25891	25891	he	2881	" Heavens ! No ! Prison ! What do you mean by prison ? . . . I have been a captive to savages , "
25897	25978	25891	25891	he	2881	" but that 's a very old story . I was young and foolish then . Later , when a grown man , I was a slave to the famous Ali - Kassim . I spent a fortnight with chains on my legs and arms in the yard of a mud fort on the shores of the Persian Gulf . There was nearly a score of us Brothers of the Coast in the same predicament in consequence of a shipwreck . "
25979	26008	25847	25847	he	2881	" Yes . . . . The lieutenant was very languid indeed . . . . And I daresay you all took service with that bloodthirsty old pirate . "
26009	26136	25891	25891	he	2881	" There was not a single one of his thousands of blackamoors that could lay a gun properly . But Ali - Kassim made war like a prince . We sailed , a regular fleet , across the gulf , took a town on the coast of Arabia somewhere , and looted it . Then I and the others managed to get hold of an armed dhow , and we fought our way right through the blackamoors ' fleet . Several of us died of thirst later . All the same , it was a great affair . But do n't you talk to me of prisons . A proper man if given a chance to fight can always get himself killed . You understand me ? "
26137	26144	26146	26147	the lieutenant	2881	" Yes , I understand you , "
26149	26166	26146	26147	the lieutenant	2881	" I think I know you pretty well . I suppose an English prison . . . "
26167	26176	26178	26178	Peyrol	136	" That is a horrible subject of conversation , "
26186	26211	26178	26178	Peyrol	136	" Naturally , any death is better than a prison . Any death ! What is it you have in your mind , lieutenant ? "
26212	26225	26227	26227	Ral	136	" Oh , it is n't that I want you to die , "
26291	26299	26284	26284	he	136	" Do you want to frighten me ? "
26382	26394	26396	26397	the officer	293	" I wonder why he put himself into this curious position , "
26399	26403	26405	26405	Peyrol	136	" I wonder , "
26408	26441	26405	26405	Peyrol	136	" If there had been only a couple of eighteen - pounders placed on the rocky ledge to the left of us , we could have unrigged her in about ten minutes . "
26442	26447	26449	26449	Ral	136	" Good old gunner , "
26452	26478	26449	26449	Ral	136	" And what afterwards ? Swim off , you and I , with our cutlasses in our teeth and take her by boarding , what ? "
26488	26493	26494	26494	he	136	" No ! No ! "
26498	26577	26494	26494	he	136	" But why not let Toulon know ? Bring out a frigate or two and catch him alive . Many a time have I planned his capture just to ease my heart . Often I have stared at night out of my window upstairs across the bay to where I knew he was lying at anchor , and thinking of a little surprise I could arrange for him if I were not only old Peyrol , the gunner . "
26578	26606	26405	26405	Peyrol	136	" Yes . And keeping out of the way at that , with a bad note against his name in the books of the Admiralty in Toulon . "
26607	26626	26629	26629	Peyrol	136	" You ca n't say I have tried to hide myself from you who are a naval officer , "
26632	26671	26629	26629	Peyrol	136	" I fear no man . I did not run . I simply went away from Toulon . Nobody had given me an order to stay there . And you ca n't say I ran very far either . "
26672	26688	26405	26405	Peyrol	136	" That was the cleverest move of all . You knew what you were doing . "
26689	26832	26405	26405	Peyrol	136	" Here you go again , hinting at something crooked like that fellow with big epaulettes at the Port Office that seemed to be longing to put me under arrest just because I brought a prize from the Indian Ocean , eight thousand miles , dodging clear of every Englishmen that came in my way , which was more perhaps than he could have done . I have my gunner 's warrant signed by Citizen Renaud , a chef d'escadre . It was n't given me for twirling my thumbs or hiding in the cable tier when the enemy was about . There were on board our ships some patriots that were n't above doing that sort of thing , I can tell you . But republic or no republic , that kind was n't likely to get a gunner 's warrant . "
26833	26839	26841	26841	Ral	136	" That 's all right , "
26866	26879	26880	26880	he	136	" Look , she seems to have lost her way at last , "
26897	26935	26880	26880	he	136	" That 's all right . But it 's on record that you managed in a very short time to get very thick with a lot of patriots ashore . Section leaders . Terrorists . . . . "
26936	27037	26880	26880	he	136	" Why , yes . I wanted to hear what they had to say . They talked like a drunken crew of scallywags that had stolen a ship . But at any rate it was n't such as they that had sold the Port to the English . They were a lot of bloodthirsty landlubbers . I did get out of town as soon as I could . I remembered I was born around here . I knew no other bit of France , and I did n't care to go any further . Nobody came to look for me . "
27038	27088	27095	27095	Peyrol	136	" No , not here . I suppose they thought it was too near . They did look for you , a little , but they gave it up . Perhaps if they had persevered and made an admiral of you we would not have been beaten at Aboukir . "
27105	27117	27118	27118	he	136	" And yet we were no worse men than the English , "
27121	27156	27118	27118	he	136	" and there are no such ships as ours in the world . You see , lieutenant , the republican god of these talkers would never give us seamen a chance of fair play . "
27164	27174	27175	27175	he	136	" What do you know about a republican god ? "
27178	27186	27175	27175	he	136	" What on earth do you mean ? "
27187	27251	27252	27252	he	136	" I have heard of and seen more gods than you could ever dream of in a long night 's sleep , in every corner of the earth , in the very heart of forests , which is an inconceivable thing . Figures , stones , sticks . There must be something in the idea . . . . And what I meant , "
27259	27298	27252	27252	he	136	" is that their republican god , which is neither stick nor stone , but seems to be some kind of lubber , has never given us seamen a chief like that one the soldiers have got ashore . "
27312	27355	27299	27300	Lieutenant Ral	136	" Well , the god of the aristocrats is coming back again and it looks as if he were bringing an emperor along with him . You 've heard something of that , you people in the farmhouse ? Have n't you ? "
27356	27359	27361	27361	Peyrol	136	" No , "
27363	27413	27361	27361	Peyrol	136	" I have heard no talk of an emperor . But what does it matter ? Under one name or another a chief can be no more than a chief , and that general whom they have been calling consul is a good chief - nobody can deny that . "
27441	27447	27423	27423	Peyrol	136	" pour manger la soupe . "
27526	27532	27533	27534	The lieutenant	2881	" And you , lieutenant ? "
28187	28190	28192	28192	Peyrol	136	" Sacrebleu ! "
28196	28215	28192	28192	Peyrol	136	" If you never say anything to anybody like this you will forget how to speak at last . "
28254	28262	28263	28263	he	136	" What is there to talk about ? "
28266	28310	28263	28263	he	136	" You live with us ; you have n't budged from here ; I suppose you have counted the bunches of grapes in the enclosure and the figs on the fig - tree on the west wall many times over . . . . "
28335	28347	28311	28311	He	136	" You and I know everything that is going on here . "
28419	28438	28416	28416	Peyrol	136	" We do n't want to talk about the farm . Have n't you heard any news lately ? "
28534	28538	28540	28540	Peyrol	136	" I know , "
28542	28562	28540	28540	Peyrol	136	" I saw the whole affair out of the window . You can run like a hare , citizen . "
28563	28577	28579	28580	Citizen Scevola	123	" Was I to allow myself to be sacrificed by those superstitious brutes ? "
28603	28624	28596	28596	He	136	" Perhaps it would have been just as well if I had let those reactionary dogs kill me that time . "
28642	28645	28647	28651	the lonely sans - culotte	1144	" No ! "
28653	28678	28683	28683	he	136	" It is n't possible ! There must be plenty of patriots left in France . The sacred fire is not burnt out yet . "
28748	28785	28718	28718	he	136	" No , it is n't possible . Some day tyranny will stumble and then it will be time to pull it down again . We will come out in our thousands and - a ira ! "
28894	28904	28883	28883	Catherine	127	" You come late for your dinner , Michel . "
29336	29345	29329	29329	Michel	150	" I thought I would come up here , "
29358	29368	29329	29329	Michel	150	" Trs bien . You will be my crew , "
29406	29430	29400	29400	he	150	" You will find a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine in a locker aft , to break your fast on . "
29444	29446	29400	29400	he	150	" crew "
29993	30005	29985	29991	a hunchbacked cripple swinging between two crutches	1215	" Is there anybody looking after this tartane , a caretaker ? "
30032	30047	30021	30021	his	152	" You are the first man that has been on board her for years . "
30068	30075	30077	30077	Peyrol	136	" I might have guessed that , "
30079	30087	30077	30077	Peyrol	136	" She is in a dreadful mess . "
30117	30124	30113	30113	He	136	" Who does she belong to ? "
30143	30152	30165	30165	he	136	" They are the only ones I know . "
30169	30194	30165	30165	he	136	" This craft used to belong to Escampobar . You know Escampobar ? It 's a house in the hollow between the hills there . "
30195	30202	30204	30204	Peyrol	136	" Yes , I know Escampobar , "
30462	30476	30444	30444	He	136	" They told me down there that she belonged to you , citoyen . "
30484	30508	30509	30509	Peyrol	136	" What 's the matter ? Is n't she the craft you came here in ? Wo n't you sell her to me ? "
30514	30521	30509	30509	Peyrol	136	" What objection can you have ? "
30553	30567	30544	30544	Peyrol	136	" I am ready to take her off your hands as she stands . "
30568	30681	30682	30682	Peyrol	136	" I will be frank with you , citoyen . You see , when she lay at the quay in Toulon a lot of fugitive traitors , men and women , and children too , swarmed on board of her , and cut the ropes with a view of escaping , but the avengers were not far behind and made short work of them . When we discovered her behind the Arsenal , I and another man , we had to throw a lot of bodies overboard , out of the hold and the cabin . You will find her very dirty all over . We had no time to clear up . "
30723	30735	30718	30718	He	136	" He had a hand in that massacre , no doubt , "
30763	30823	30759	30760	The terrorist	1230	" We really had not a moment to clean her up . The circumstances were such that it was necessary for me to get away quickly lest some of the false patriots should do me some carmagnole or other . There had been bitter quarrelling in my section . I was not alone in getting away , you know . "
31380	31389	31390	31390	he	136	" Is it that I am getting old ? "
31552	31574	31547	31547	Peyrol	136	" You must have been a handsome girl in your day , Catherine . It 's strange you never got married . "
31605	31638	31639	31639	She	828	" What 's the matter ? If the old moke in the yard had spoken you could not look more surprised . You ca n't deny that you were a handsome girl . "
31647	31671	31639	31639	She	828	" I was born here , grew up here , and early in my life I made up my mind to die here . "
31672	31677	31679	31679	Peyrol	136	" A strange notion , "
31681	31692	31679	31679	Peyrol	136	" for a young girl to take into her head . "
31693	31703	31705	31707	the old woman	1151	" It 's not a thing to talk about , "
31720	31728	31729	31729	she	1151	" I did not think , then , "
31739	31758	31729	31729	she	1151	" that I would live long . When I was eighteen I fell in love with a priest . "
31759	31764	31766	31766	Peyrol	136	" Ah , bah ! "
31771	31782	31783	31783	she	1151	" That was the time when I prayed for death , "
31790	31845	31783	31783	she	1151	" I spent nights on my knees upstairs in that room where you sleep now . I shunned everybody . People began to say I was crazy . We have always been hated by the rabble about here . They have poisonous tongues . I got the nickname of ` la fiance du prtre . "
31940	31998	31932	31932	I	0	" There were no signs of watchfulness and care in her bearing now . She stood straight as an arrow before Peyrol and looked at him with a confident air . The rover was not yet ready to speak . He only nodded twice and Catherine turned away to put the pot to cool in the sink . "
32020	32037	32013	32013	I	0	" she said , sitting down near the fireplace and taking her chin in her hand . "
32047	32056	32041	32041	you	1275	" she added . Peyrol got up deliberately . "
32061	32065	32066	32066	I	0	" he said . "
32084	32085	32072	32072	I	0	" "
32125	32415	32117	32117	I	0	" Moving calmly her faded lips which no lover or child had ever kissed , old Catherine told Peyrol of the days and nights of waiting , with the distant growl of the big guns in her ears . She used to sit outside on the bench longing for news , watching the flickers in the sky and listening to heavy bursts of gunfire coming over the water . Then came a night as if the world were coming to an end . All the sky was lighted up , the earth shook to its foundations , and she felt the house rock , so that jumping up from the bench she screamed with fear . That night she never went to bed . Next morning she saw the sea covered with sails , while a black and yellow cloud of smoke hung over Toulon . A man coming up from Madrague told her that he believed that the whole town had been blown up . She gave him a bottle of wine and he helped her to feed the stock that evening . Before going home he expressed the opinion that there could not be a soul left alive in Toulon , because the few that survived would have gone away in the English ships . Nearly a week later she was dozing by the fire when voices outside woke her up , and she beheld standing in the middle of the salle , pale like a corpse out of a grave , with a blood - soaked blanket over her shoulders and a red cap on her head , a ghastly looking young girl in whom she suddenly recognized her niece . She screamed in her terror : "
32420	32457	32458	32458	Franois	154	" This was her brother 's name , and she thought he was outside . Her scream scared the girl , who ran out of the door . All was still outside . Once more she screamed "
32460	32494	32458	32458	Franois	154	" and , tottering as far as the door , she saw her niece clinging to a strange man in a red cap and with a sabre by his side who yelled excitedly : "
32506	32507	32508	32508	I	0	" "
32514	32519	32508	32508	I	0	" went on Catherine . "
32566	32583	32560	32561	The child	1284	" she continued , getting up from the stool and moving a little closer to Peyrol . "
32810	32811	32812	32812	He	1290	" "
32816	32833	32812	32812	He	1290	" said Peyrol , looking at her steadily . Catherine moved a step nearer to him . "
32931	32932	32935	32935	he	1290	" "
32938	32942	32935	32935	he	1290	" said Peyrol . "
32952	32957	32958	32958	He	1290	" asked Catherine steadily . "
33069	33075	33055	33055	We	1305	" she said , proudly . "
33085	33756	33080	33080	I	0	" Her voice faltered , she sat down on the stool again and took her chin in the palm of her hand . As Peyrol left the house to go to the hamlet he saw Arlette and the patron come round the corner of the yard wall walking side by side but as if unconscious of each other . That night he slept on board the renovated tartane and the rising sun found him at work about the hull . By that time he had ceased to be the object of awed contemplation to the inhabitants of the hamlet who still , however , kept up a mistrustful attitude . His only intermediary for communicating with them was the miserable cripple . He was Peyrol 's only company , in fact , during his period of work on the tartane . He had more activity , audacity , and intelligence , it seemed to Peyrol , than all the rest of the inhabitants put together . Early in the morning he could be seen making his way on his crutches with a pendulum motion towards the hull on which Peyrol would have been already an hour or so at work . Peyrol then would throw him over a sound rope 's end and the cripple , leaning his crutches against the side of the tartane , would pull his wretched little carcass , all withered below the waist , up the rope , hand over hand , with extreme ease . There , sitting on the small foredeck , with his back against the mast and his thin , twisted legs folded in front of him , he would keep Peyrol company , talking to him along the whole length of the tartane in a strained voice and sharing his midday meal , as of right , since it was he generally who brought the provisions slung round his neck in a quaint flat basket . Thus were the hours of labour shortened for Peyrol by shrewd remarks and bits of local gossip . How the cripple got hold of it it was difficult to imagine , and the rover had not enough knowledge of European superstitions to suspect him of flying through the night on a broomstick like a sort of male witch - for there was a manliness in that twisted scrap of humanity which struck Peyrol from the first . His very voice was manly and the character of his gossip was not feminine . He did indeed mention to Peyrol that people used to take him about the neighbourhood in carts for the purpose of playing a fiddle at weddings and other festive occasions ; but this seemed hardly adequate , and even he himself confessed that there was not much of that sort of thing going on during the Revolution when people did n't like to attract attention and everything was done in a hole - and - corner manner . There were no priests to officiate at weddings , and if there were no ceremonies how could there be rejoicings ? Of course children were born as before , but there were no christenings - and people got to look funny somehow or other . Their countenances got changed somehow ; the very boys and girls seemed to have something on their minds . Peyrol , busy about one thing and another , listened without appearing to pay much attention to the story of the Revolution , as if to the tale of an intelligent islander on the other side of the world talking of bloody rites and amazing hopes of some religion unknown to the rest of mankind . But there was something biting in the speech of that cripple which confused his thoughts a little . Sarcasm was a mystery which he could not understand . On one occasion he remarked to his friend the cripple as they sat together on the foredeck munching the bread and figs of their midday meal : "
33779	33780	33853	33853	you	1310	" "
33785	33793	33853	33853	you	1310	" retorted the scrap of man vivaciously , "
33810	33835	33836	33836	You	1310	" Peyrol , whose trousers were rolled up above the knee because he had been washing the hold , looked at his calves complacently . "
33843	33849	33836	33836	You	1310	" he remarked with simplicity . "
33868	33873	33853	33853	you	1310	" said the cripple . "
33900	33926	33881	33881	Everybody	277	" His long face which , in repose , had an expression of suffering peculiar to cripples , was lighted up by an enormous grin . "
33937	33941	33927	33927	They	1314	" he added . "
33990	34000	33980	33980	They	1314	" He paused and seemed to contemplate himself mentally . "
34079	34141	34142	34142	You	1322	" Peyrol interrupted him by remarking that he knew all about Almanarre . This , on his part , was a simple delusion because in reality he knew much less of Almanarre than of Zanzibar or any pirate village from there up to Cape Guardafui . And the cripple contemplated him with his brown eyes which had an upward cast naturally . "
34151	34163	34164	34164	you	1322	" he went on , in a tone of quiet decision , "
34255	34423	34247	34248	many people	598	" Peyrol , without looking at the cripple , tried to imagine what sort of child he might have been - what sort of youth ? The rover had seen staggering deformities , dreadful mutilations which were the cruel work of man ; but it was amongst people with dusky skins . And that made a great difference . But what he had heard and seen since he had come back to his native land , the tales , the facts , and also the faces , reached his sensibility with a particular force , because of that feeling that came to him so suddenly after a whole lifetime spent amongst Indians , Malagashes , Arabs , blackamoors of all sorts , that he belonged there , to this land , and had escaped all those things by a mere hair 's breadth . His companion completed his significant silence , which seemed to have been occupied with thoughts very much like his own , by saying : "
34479	34480	34483	34484	a man	278	" "
34486	34579	34483	34484	a man	278	" said Peyrol . Only the misshapen character of the cripple 's back prevented Peyrol from giving him a hearty slap . He got up to begin his afternoon 's work . It was a bit of inside painting and from the foredeck the cripple watched him at it with dreamy eyes and something ironic on his lips . It was not till the sun had travelled over Cape Cici , which could be seen across the water like dark mist in the glare , that he opened his lips to ask : "
34593	34615	34583	34583	you	0	" Peyrol answered simply that the tartane was fit to go anywhere now , the very moment she took the water . "
34629	34634	34616	34616	You	0	" suggested the cripple . "
34638	34642	34616	34616	You	0	" said Peyrol . "
34656	34657	34644	34644	you	0	" "
34660	34669	34644	34644	you	0	" said Peyrol , using his brush steadily . "
34681	34996	34671	34671	I	0	" Peyrol never checked the to - and - fro movement of his brush , but it was with an effort . The fact was that he had discovered in himself a distinct reluctance to go away from the Escampobar Farm . His desire to have something of his own that could float was no longer associated with any desire to wander . The cripple was right . The voyage of the renovated tartane would not take her very far . What was surprising was the fellow being so very positive about it . He seemed able to read people 's thoughts . The dragging of the renovated tartane into the water was a great affair . Everybody in the hamlet , including the women , did a full day 's work and there was never so much coin passed from hand to hand in the hamlet in all the days of its obscure history . Swinging between his crutches on a low sand - ridge the cripple surveyed the whole of the beach . It was he that had persuaded the villagers to lend a hand and had arranged the terms for their assistance . It was he also who through a very miserable - looking pedlar the only one who frequented the peninsula had got in touch with some rich persons in Frjus who had changed for Peyrol a few of his gold pieces for current money . He had expedited the course of the most exciting and interesting experience of his life , and now planted on the sand on his two sticks in the manner of a beacon he watched the last operation . The rover , as if about to launch himself upon a track of a thousand miles , walked up to shake hands with him and look once more at the soft eyes and the ironic smile . "
35008	35009	35005	35006	a man	278	" "
35020	35056	35005	35006	a man	278	" said the cripple in a trembling voice . Till then , suspended between his two sticks and with his shoulders as high as his ears , he had not looked towards the approaching Peyrol . "
35065	35066	35067	35067	I	0	" "
35071	35102	35067	35067	I	0	" insisted the rover roughly , and as if the insignificance of mortal envelopes had presented itself to him for the first time at the end of his roving life , "
35129	35182	35103	35103	I	0	" As he went away from the cripple towards the tartane , while the whole population of the hamlet disposed around her waited for his word , some on land and some waist - deep in the water holding ropes in their hands , Peyrol had a slight shudder at the thought : "
35191	35805	35184	35184	I	0	" Ever since he had put his foot on his native land such thoughts had haunted him . They would have been impossible anywhere else . He could not have been like any blackamoor , good , bad , or indifferent , hale or crippled , king or slave ; but here , on this Southern shore that had called to him irresistibly as he had approached the Straits of Gibraltar on what he had felt to be his last voyage , any woman , lean and old enough , might have been his mother ; he might have been any Frenchman of them all , even one of those he pitied , even one of those he despised . He felt the grip of his origins from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet while he clambered on board the tartane as if for a long and distant voyage . As a matter of fact he knew very well that with a bit of luck it would be over in about an hour . When the tartane took the water the feeling of being afloat plucked at his very heart . Some Madrague fishermen had been persuaded by the cripple to help old Peyrol to sail the tartane round to the cove below the Escampobar Farm . A glorious sun shone upon that short passage and the cove itself was full of sparkling light when they arrived . The few Escampobar goats wandering on the hillside pretending to feed where no grass was visible to the naked eye never even raised their heads . A gentle breeze drove the tartane , as fresh as paint could make her , opposite a narrow crack in the cliff which gave admittance to a tiny basin , no bigger than a village pond , concealed at the foot of the southern hill . It was there that old Peyrol , aided by the Madrague men , who had their boat with them , towed his ship , the first really that he ever owned . Once in , the tartane nearly filled the little basin , and the fishermen , getting into their boat , rowed away for home . Peyrol , by spending the afternoon in dragging ropes ashore and fastening them to various boulders and dwarf trees , moored her to his complete satisfaction . She was as safe from the tempests there as a house ashore . After he had made everything fast on board and had furled the sails neatly , a matter of some time for one man , Peyrol contemplated his arrangements which savoured of rest much more than of wandering , and found them good . Though he never meant to abandon his room at the farmhouse he felt that his true home was in the tartane , and he rejoiced at the idea that it was concealed from all eyes except perhaps the eyes of the goats when their arduous feeding took them on the southern slope . He lingered on board , he even threw open the sliding door of the little cabin , which now smelt of fresh paint , not of stale blood . Before he started for the farm the sun had travelled far beyond Spain and all the sky to the west was yellow , while on the side of Italy it presented a sombre canopy pierced here and there with the light of stars . Catherine put a plate on the table , but nobody asked him any questions . He spent a lot of his time on board , going down early , coming up at midday "
35811	35937	35184	35184	I	0	" and sleeping on board almost every night . He did not like to leave the tartane alone for so many hours . Often , having climbed a little way up to the house , he would turn round for a last look at her in the gathering dusk , and actually would go back again . After Michel had been enlisted for a crew and had taken his abode on board for good , Peyrol found it a much easier matter to spend his nights in the lantern - like room at the top of the farmhouse . Often waking up at night he would get up to look at the starry sky out of all his three windows in succession , and think : "
35958	36099	35184	35184	I	0	" As a matter of fact it was possible for two men to manage the tartane . Thus Peyrol 's thought was comfortingly true in every way , for he loved to feel himself free , and Michel of the lagoon , after the death of his depressed dog , had no tie on earth . It was a fine thought which somehow made it quite easy for Peyrol to go back to his four - poster and resume his slumbers . Perched sideways on the circular wall bordering the well , in the full blaze of the midday sun , the rover of the distant seas and the fisherman of the lagoon , sharing between them a most surprising secret , had the air of two men conferring in the dark . The first word that Peyrol said was , "
36102	36103	35184	35184	I	0	" "
36107	36112	35184	35184	I	0	" said the other . "
36121	36122	36114	36114	you	1343	" "
36131	36186	36123	36123	You	1343	" Peyrol could not deny that . It was a sufficient answer . It shifted the responsibility on to his shoulders and all his life he had been accustomed to trust to the work of his own hands , in peace and in war . Yet he looked doubtfully at Michel before he remarked : "
36196	36260	36190	36190	I	0	" There could be no greater contrast than those two faces : Peyrol 's clean , like a carving of stone , and only very little softened by time , and that of the owner of the late dog , hirsute , with many silver threads , with something elusive in the features and the vagueness of expression of a baby in arms . "
36268	36292	36263	36263	I	0	" repeated Peyrol . Michel 's mouth fell open at this , a small oval set a little crookedly in the innocent face . "
36298	36320	36321	36321	You	1346	" he suggested timidly . The possession of a common and momentous secret drawing men together , Peyrol condescended to explain . "
36334	36367	36331	36331	I	0	" He spoke as though he had made it himself . Michel , who in the face of that positive statement had forgotten to shut his mouth , had nothing to say . "
36373	36377	36368	36368	He	400	" asked Peyrol . "
36401	36410	36398	36398	him	400	" Peyrol looked interested and also slightly anxious . "
36427	36431	36411	36411	I	0	" he said . "
36496	36511	36479	36479	him	400	" This seemed to be too much for Michel . He said almost indignantly : "
36518	36519	36512	36513	The man	400	" "
36545	36550	36540	36540	You	1349	" Peyrol continued placidly , "
36619	36620	36606	36606	he	400	" "
36632	36664	36625	36625	One	2670	" protested Michel against this accumulation of improbabilities . He did it , however , only in a whisper and with childlike shyness . Peyrol folded his arms on his breast : "
36671	36679	36625	36625	One	2670	" he commanded in a low voice , "
36698	36699	36695	36695	you	1349	" "
36705	36716	36717	36717	He	400	" protested Michel , staggered by this display of anxiety . "
36731	36732	36717	36717	He	400	" "
36816	37210	37211	37211	I	0	" The conference in the sunshine being ended , Peyrol walked leisurely out of the yard gate , and protruding his head beyond the corner of the house , saw Lieutenant Ral sitting on the bench . This he had expected to see . But he had not expected to see him there alone . It was just like this : wherever Arlette happened to be , there were worrying possibilities . But she might have been helping her aunt in the kitchen with her sleeves rolled up on such white arms as Peyrol had never seen on any woman before . The way she had taken to dressing her hair in a plait with a broad black velvet ribbon and an Arlesian cap was very becoming . She was wearing now her mother 's clothes of which there were chestfuls , altered for her of course . The late mistress of the Escampobar Farm had been an Arlesienne . Well - to - do , too . Yes , even for women 's clothes the Escampobar natives could do without intercourse with the outer world . It was quite time that this confounded lieutenant went back to Toulon . This was the third day . His short leave must be up . Peyrol 's attitude towards naval officers had been always guarded and suspicious . His relations with them had been very mixed . They had been his enemies and his superiors . He had been chased by them . He had been trusted by them . The Revolution had made a clean cut across the consistency of his wild life - Brother of the Coast and gunner in the national navy - and yet he was always the same man . It was like that , too , with them . Officers of the King , officers of the Republic , it was only changing the skin . All alike looked askance at a free rover . Even this one could not forget his epaulettes when talking to him . Scorn and mistrust of epaulettes were rooted deeply in old Peyrol . Yet he did not absolutely hate Lieutenant Ral . Only the fellow 's coming to the farm was generally a curse and his presence at that particular moment a confounded nuisance and to a certain extent even a danger . "
37227	37425	37426	37426	Tiens	157	" Peyrol said to himself . There was no trusting those epaulette - wearers . Any one of them was capable of jumping on his best friend on account of some officer - like notion or other . Peyrol , stepping round the corner , sat down by the side of Lieutenant Ral with the feeling somehow of coming to grips with a slippery customer . The lieutenant , as he sat there , unaware of Peyrol 's survey of his person , gave no notion of slipperiness . On the contrary , he looked rather immovably established . Very much at home . Too much at home . Even after Peyrol sat down by his side he continued to look immovable - or at least difficult to get rid of . In the still noonday heat the faint shrilling of cicadas was the only sound of life heard for quite a long time . Delicate , evanescent , cheerful , careless sort of life , yet not without passion . A sudden gloom seemed to be cast over the joy of the cicadas by the lieutenant 's voice though the words were the most perfunctory possible . "
37431	37444	37448	37448	he	1360	" In the stress of the situation Peyrol at once asked himself : "
37460	37503	37454	37454	he	1360	" The lieutenant need not have spoken at all . He had known him now for about two years off and on , and it had happened many times that they had sat side by side on that bench in a sort of "
37508	37554	37448	37448	he	1360	" equality without exchanging a single word . And why could he not have kept quiet now ? That naval officer never spoke without an object , but what could one make of words like that ? Peyrol achieved an insincere yawn and suggested mildly : "
37571	37578	37566	37566	you	1361	" And to himself he thought : "
37590	37674	37582	37582	he	1360	" He would stay there and thereby keep him , Peyrol , from going down to the cove . He turned his eyes on that naval officer , and if extreme and concentrated desire and mere force of will could have had any effect Lieutenant Ral would certainly have been removed suddenly from that bench . But he did n't move . And Peyrol was astonished to see that man smile , but what astonished him still more was to hear him say : "
37689	37690	37679	37679	you	888	" "
37695	37700	37693	37693	you	888	" repeated the rover . "
37722	37723	37712	37712	I	0	" "
37728	37733	37712	37712	I	0	" said Lieutenant Ral . "
37746	37747	37748	37748	Me	0	" "
37751	37755	37748	37748	Me	0	" cried Peyrol , "
37759	37779	37748	37748	Me	0	" But he faltered in his indignation as if frightened at it and ended in a very quiet tone : "
37812	37813	37780	37780	You	888	" "
37880	37881	37882	37882	You	888	" "
37896	37901	37884	37884	You	888	" cried the rover , "
37928	37965	37970	37970	anybody	1371	" The lieutenant turned his head sharply , and for a moment the naval officer and the free sea - rover looked at each other gloomily . When Peyrol spoke again he had changed his mood . "
38004	38009	37999	37999	I	0	" he added darkly . "
38020	38030	38010	38010	I	0	" the lieutenant said after a moment of thought . "
38059	38068	38054	38054	you	0	" Peyrol did not like the sarcastic tone . "
38075	38079	38081	38081	your	0	" he said , "
38095	38096	38081	38081	your	0	" "
38100	38111	38081	38081	your	0	" said the lieutenant , grave but a little puzzled . "
38138	38160	38194	38194	they	1377	" Peyrol was grumbling and swearing to himself with such concentration that the lieutenant stopped and waited till he had finished . "
38173	38178	38179	38179	You	0	" he continued then . "
38210	38211	38213	38213	they	1377	" "
38232	38252	38226	38226	he	136	" The rover suffered from great instability of feelings for he passed in a flash from melancholy into fierceness . "
38309	38317	38294	38296	a naval officer	1007	" Again a change came over him . "
38324	38341	38294	38296	a naval officer	1007	" he whispered , suddenly depressed . The lieutenant fell into the humour of that discourse . "
38351	38373	38342	38342	I	0	" he said , turning full to the rover who after his last words had fixed his eyes on the ground . "
38383	38396	38397	38397	He	136	" Peyrol , without raising his eyes from the ground , growled : "
38419	38420	38416	38416	Nobody	2665	" "
38423	38433	38416	38416	Nobody	2665	" said Lieutenant Ral , in a conversational tone , "
38499	38512	38497	38497	him	136	" Peyrol raised his big head slowly and looked at the lieutenant . "
38515	38652	38653	38653	You	1390	" he grunted . A heavy , non - committal grunt . His old heart was stirred , but the tangle was such that he had to be on his guard with any man who wore epaulettes . His profile preserved the immobility of a head struck on a medal while he listened to the lieutenant assuring him that this time he had come to Escampobar on purpose to speak with the gunner Peyrol . That he had not done so before was because it was a very confidential matter . At this point the lieutenant stopped and Peyrol made no sign . Inwardly he was asking himself what the lieutenant was driving at . But the lieutenant seemed to have shifted his ground . His tone , too , was slightly different . More practical . "
38710	38711	38688	38688	you	1390	" "
38718	38722	38714	38714	I	0	" said Peyrol . "
38758	38759	38751	38751	you	1390	" "
38762	38767	38751	38751	you	1390	" said Peyrol again . "
38776	38777	38772	38772	I	0	" "
38804	38805	38802	38802	you	1390	" "
38812	38829	38806	38806	I	0	" said Peyrol after a pause and with a face more like a carving than ever . "
38900	38901	38889	38889	you	1390	" "
38910	38911	38889	38889	you	1390	" "
38923	38924	38926	38926	you	1390	" "
38948	38956	38944	38944	you	1390	" Peyrol let out a heavy sigh . "
38996	38997	38998	38998	You	0	" "
39006	39011	38998	38998	You	0	" said the lieutenant . "
39019	39020	39014	39014	you	0	" "
39053	39080	39046	39046	They	1397	" They had never attained to such intimate terms before . There was no need for them to look at each other . The lieutenant thought : "
39091	39113	39083	39083	He	136	" There was no scorn or malice in that thought . It was much more like despair . He said mildly : "
39123	39124	39114	39114	You	0	" "
39138	39148	39131	39131	I	0	" said Peyrol in a sort of calm whisper . "
39156	39157	39159	39159	me	0	" "
39168	39211	39162	39162	I	0	" Again Peyrol turned his head slowly for a long , steady stare . And again the naval officer and the rover gazed at each other with a searching and sombre frankness . This new - born intimacy could go no further . "
39221	39222	39216	39216	Peyrol	136	" "
39225	39230	39216	39216	Peyrol	136	" said the other . "
39242	39295	39239	39240	the gunner	3261	" Though he seemed to have adopted the notion of a double personality the rover did not seem to be much easier in one character than in the other . Furrows of perplexity appeared on his brow , and as the lieutenant did not speak at once Peyrol the gunner asked impatiently : "
39305	39372	39297	39297	they	1401	" It did not please him to hear the lieutenant say that it was not exactly this that the chiefs in Toulon had in their minds . Peyrol at once expressed the opinion that of all the naval chiefs that ever were , Citizen Renaud was the only one that was worth anything . Lieutenant Ral , disregarding the challenging tone , kept to the point . "
39390	39391	39394	39394	she	1402	" "
39398	39469	39394	39394	she	1402	" said Peyrol : ' she leaves poor people alone , unless , I suppose , some craft acts suspiciously . I have seen her give chase to one or two . But even those she did not detain . Michel - you know Michel - has heard from the mainland people that she has captured several at various times . Of course , strictly speaking , nobody is safe . "
39470	39487	39394	39394	she	1402	" Well , no . I wonder now what that Englishman would call ` acting suspiciously . "
39488	39489	39394	39394	she	1402	" "
39578	39610	39554	39554	You	1404	" The lieutenant lending an attentive ear , Peyrol smoothed his brow and discoursed with gusto of Englishmen as if they had been a strange , very little - known tribe . "
39617	39621	39554	39554	You	1404	" he concluded , "
39639	39658	39554	39554	You	1404	" He shook his head , smiling to himself faintly as if remembering a quaint passage or two . "
39675	39681	39659	39659	You	1404	" observed the lieutenant dryly . "
39687	39691	39683	39683	you	1404	" said Peyrol . "
39723	39724	39725	39725	I	0	" "
39747	39748	39770	39770	I	0	" "
39751	39759	39770	39770	I	0	" said Peyrol , then added grumpily , "
39780	39781	39770	39770	I	0	" "
39897	39898	39886	39886	I	0	" "
39903	39908	39886	39886	I	0	" struck in Peyrol . "
39919	39920	39922	39922	you	0	" "
39934	39935	39936	39936	I	0	" "
39944	39958	39936	39936	I	0	" said the naval officer with emphasis . Peyrol looked at him searchingly . "
39977	39978	39960	39960	you	0	" "
40003	40004	39988	39989	My chief	1421	" "
40043	40064	40030	40030	you	0	" The lieutenant plunged his hand into the inside pocket of his naval jacket and then brought it out empty . "
40069	40074	40030	40030	you	0	" he said earnestly , "
40100	40101	40095	40096	the enemy	627	" "
40104	40112	40095	40096	the enemy	627	" said Peyrol in a judicial tone , "
40161	40162	40202	40202	he	141	" "
40192	40193	40197	40197	Nelson	141	" "
40208	40234	40202	40202	he	141	" After expressing that opinion the old rover pulled out a red bandana handkerchief and after rubbing his face with it repeated his opinion deliberately : "
40242	40258	40202	40202	he	141	" This time the lieutenant really brought out a paper from his pocket and saying , "
40269	40339	40259	40259	I	0	" handed it to the rover , who took it from him with a doubtful air . Lieutenant Ral watched old Peyrol handling it at arm 's length , then with his arm bent trying to adjust the distance to his eyesight , and wondered whether he had copied it in a hand big enough to be read easily by the gunner Peyrol . The order ran like this : "
40414	40446	40447	40447	Bonaparte	161	" The Prfet Maritime had called Ral , had shown him the paragraph of the letter from Paris , had turned the page over and laid his finger on the signature , "
40449	40526	40447	40447	Bonaparte	161	" Then after giving him a meaning glance , the admiral locked up the paper in a drawer and put the key in his pocket . Lieutenant Ral had written the passage down from memory directly the notion of consulting Peyrol had occurred to him . The rover , screwing his eyes and pursing his lips , had come to the end of it . The lieutenant extended his hand negligently and took the paper away : "
40534	40538	40531	40531	you	1438	" he asked . "
40565	40566	40560	40560	you	1438	" "
40572	40577	40560	40560	you	1438	" opined Peyrol curtly . "
40586	40587	40581	40581	I	0	" "
40603	40604	40581	40581	I	0	" "
40622	40623	40613	40613	He	1440	" "
40633	40634	40635	40635	He	1440	" "
40649	40676	40678	40679	the admiral	3016	" And I said - listen to me , gunner - I said : ` Oui , Amiral , I think I 've got a man , "
40735	40792	40726	40726	you	0	" They were already prepared , Peyrol , all those faked letters and dispatches . I carried it out of the admiral 's room , a parcel done up in sail - cloth , properly corded and sealed . I have had it in my possession for three days . It 's upstairs in my valise . "
40793	40802	40804	40805	old Peyrol	136	" That does n't advance you very much , "
40807	40810	40812	40813	the lieutenant	2881	" No , "
40815	40826	40812	40813	the lieutenant	2881	" I can also dispose of a few thousand francs . "
40827	40830	40832	40832	Peyrol	136	" Francs , "
40834	40862	40832	40832	Peyrol	136	" Well , you had better get back to Toulon and try to bribe some man to put his head into the jaws of the English lion . "
40870	40891	40863	40863	Ral	136	" I would n't tell any man that . Of course a service of danger , that would be understood . "
40892	40935	40812	40813	the lieutenant	2881	" It would be . And if you could get a fellow with some sense in his caboche , he would naturally try to slip past the English fleet and maybe do it , too . And then where 's your trick ? "
40936	40946	40812	40813	the lieutenant	2881	" We could give him a course to steer . "
40947	40986	40863	40863	Ral	136	" Yes . And it may happen that your course would just take him clear of all Nelson 's fleet , for you never can tell what the English are doing . They might be watering in Sardinia . "
40987	41000	40812	40813	the lieutenant	2881	" Some cruisers are sure to be out and pick him up . "
41001	41032	40812	40813	the lieutenant	2881	" Maybe . But that 's not doing the job , that 's taking a chance . Do you think you are talking to a toothless baby - or what ? "
41033	41052	40863	40863	Ral	136	" No , my gunner . It will take a strong man 's teeth to undo that knot . "
41066	41101	41060	41060	Peyrol	136	" I will tell you what it is , lieutenant . This seems to me just the sort of order that a landlubber would give to good seamen . You dare n't deny that . "
41102	41109	41110	41111	the lieutenant	2881	" I do n't deny it , "
41114	41233	41110	41111	the lieutenant	2881	" And look at the whole difficulty . For supposing even that the tartane blunders right into the English fleet , as if it had been indeed arranged , they would just look into her hold or perhaps poke their noses here and there but it would never occur to them to search for dispatches , would it ? Our man , of course , would have them well hidden , would n't he ? He is not to know . And if he were ass enough to leave them lying about the decks the English would at once smell a rat there . But what I think he would do would be to throw the dispatches overboard . "
41234	41247	41249	41249	Peyrol	136	" Yes - unless he is told the nature of the job , "
41251	41272	41249	41249	Peyrol	136	" Evidently . But where 's the bribe big enough to induce a man to taste of the English pontoons ? "
41273	41383	41110	41111	the lieutenant	2881	" The man will take the bribe all right and then will do his best not to be caught ; and if he ca n't avoid that , he will take jolly good care that the English should find nothing on board his tartane . Oh no , lieutenant , any damn scallywag that owns a tartane will take a couple of thousand francs from your hand as tame as can be ; but as to deceiving the English Admiral , it 's the very devil of an affair . Did n't you think of all that before you spoke to the big epaulettes that gave you the job ? "
41384	41398	41399	41400	the lieutenant	2881	" I did see it , and I put it all before him , "
41466	41500	41448	41449	The lieutenant	2881	" What I wanted was to hear you say all those things . Do you understand now what I meant this morning on the lookout ? Do n't you remember what I said ? "
41513	41604	41501	41501	Peyrol	136	" I remember a naval officer trying to shake old Peyrol off his feet and not managing to do it . I may be disparu but I am too solid yet for any blancbec that loses his temper , devil only knows why . And it 's a good thing that you did n't manage it , else I would have taken you down with me , and we would have made our last somersault together for the amusement of an English ship 's company . A pretty end that ! "
41605	41639	41641	41641	his	1453	" Do n't you remember me saying , when you mentioned that the English would have sent a boat to go through our pockets , that this would have been the perfect way ? "
41669	41846	41663	41664	the lieutenant	2881	" Well , it was in allusion to this affair , for , look here , gunner , what could be more convincing , if they had found the packet of dispatches on me ! What would have been their surprise , their wonder ! Not the slightest doubt could enter their heads . Could it , gunner ? Of course it could n't . I can imagine the captain of that corvette crowding sail on her to get this packet into the Admiral 's hands . The secret of the Toulon fleet 's destination found on the body of a dead officer . Would n't they have exulted at their enormous piece of luck ! But they would n't have called it accidental . Oh , no ! They would have called it providential . I know the English a little too . They like to have God on their side - the only ally they never need pay a subsidy to . Come , gunner , would it not have been a perfect way ? "
41867	41880	41881	41881	He	136	" Time yet . The English ship is still in the Passe . "
41897	41912	41893	41893	he	136	" You do n't seem in a hurry to go and take that leap . "
41913	41929	41930	41931	the lieutenant	2881	" Upon my word , I am almost sick enough of life to do it , "
41938	41957	41959	41959	Peyrol	136	" Well , do n't forget to run upstairs and take that packet with you before you go , "
41963	41997	41959	41959	Peyrol	136	" But do n't wait for me ; I am not sick of life . I am disparu , and that 's good enough . There 's no need for me to die . "
42037	42048	42001	42001	he	136	" Disparu ! Hein ! Well , I am damned ! "
42053	42055	42001	42001	he	136	" vanished "
42125	42138	42101	42102	The lieutenant	2881	" We are victims of the destiny which has brought us together . "
42234	42237	42239	42239	Peyrol	136	" No , "
42241	42267	42239	42239	Peyrol	136	" I am too old to break my bones for the sake of a lubberly soldier in Paris who fancies he has invented something clever . "
42268	42276	42277	42278	the lieutenant	2881	" I do n't ask you to , "
42296	42324	42277	42278	the lieutenant	2881	" You old sea - bandit . And it would n't be for the sake of a soldier anyhow . You and I are Frenchmen after all . "
42325	42334	42277	42278	the lieutenant	2881	" You have discovered that , have you ? "
42335	42338	42340	42340	Ral	136	" Yes , "
42342	42366	42340	42340	Ral	136	" This morning , listening to your talk on the hillside with that English corvette within one might say a stone 's throw . "
42367	42370	42372	42372	Peyrol	136	" Yes , "
42374	42381	42382	42382	He	136	" A French - built ship ! "
42390	42414	42382	42382	He	136	" It hurts one there to see her . It seemed to me I could jump down on her deck single - handed . "
42415	42426	42428	42429	the lieutenant	2881	" Yes , there you and I understood each other , "
42431	42493	42428	42429	the lieutenant	2881	" But look here , this affair is a much bigger thing than getting back a captured corvette . In reality it is much more than merely playing a trick on an admiral . It 's a part of a deep plan , Peyrol ! It 's another stroke to help us on the way towards a great victory at sea . "
42494	42497	42499	42499	Peyrol	136	" Us ! "
42501	42523	42499	42499	Peyrol	136	" I am a sea - bandit and you are a sea - officer . What do you mean by us ? "
42524	42530	42532	42533	the lieutenant	2881	" I mean all Frenchmen , "
42535	42550	42532	42533	the lieutenant	2881	" Or , let us say simply France , which you too have served . "
42574	42597	42551	42551	Peyrol	136	" You 've got something in your mind . Now what is it ? If you will trust a sea - bandit . "
42598	42659	42532	42533	the lieutenant	2881	" No , I will trust a gunner of the Republic . It occurred to me that for this great affair we could make use of this corvette that you have been observing so long . For to count on the capture of any old tartane by the fleet in a way that would not arouse suspicion is no use . "
42660	42665	42667	42667	Peyrol	136	" A lubberly notion , "
42681	42715	42673	42673	he	136	" Yes , but there 's that corvette . Could n't something be arranged to make them swallow the whole thing , somehow , some way ? You laugh . . . Why ? "
42716	42727	42729	42729	Peyrol	136	" I laugh because it would be a great joke , "
42739	42781	42782	42782	He	136	" That fellow on board , he thinks himself very clever . I never set my eyes on him , but I used to feel that I knew him as if he were my own brother ; but now . . . "
42804	42814	42786	42787	Lieutenant Ral	136	" I think you have just had an idea . "
42815	42820	42822	42822	Peyrol	136	" Not the slightest , "
42852	42860	42849	42849	Peyrol	136	" All the same one could see . "
42865	42875	42849	42849	Peyrol	136	" You meant to stay here to - night ? "
42876	42908	42786	42787	Lieutenant Ral	136	" Yes . I will only go down to Madrague and leave word with the sailing barge which was to come to - day from Toulon to go back without me . "
42909	43015	43016	43016	He	1468	" No , lieutenant . You must return to Toulon to - day . When you get there you must turn out some of those damned quill - drivers at the Port Office if it were midnight and have papers made out for a tartane - oh , any name you like . Some sort of papers . And then you must come back as soon as you can . Why not go down to Madrague now and see whether the barge is n't already there ? If she is , then by starting at once you may get back here some time about midnight . "
43058	43067	43069	43070	the lieutenant	2881	" Wo n't you tell me something more ? "
43072	43075	43077	43078	the rover	822	" No , "
43080	43179	43180	43180	He	822	" Not till we meet again . If you return during the night do n't you try to get into the house . Wait outside . Do n't rouse anybody . I will be about , and if there is anything to say I will say it to you then . What are you looking about you for ? You do n't want to go up for your valise . Your pistols up in your room too ? What do you want with pistols , only to go to Toulon and back with a naval boat 's crew ? "
43257	43273	43242	43242	He	822	" I see you want me out of the way for some reason or other , "
43655	43661	43647	43647	He	136	" I am growing old , "
43912	43919	43910	43910	himself	136	" Landed from an English boat . "
44239	44245	44264	44266	the Evil One	166	" You there , Michel , "
44403	44409	44410	44410	he	136	" His heart beats yet , "
44413	44423	44410	44410	he	136	" Go and light the cabin lamp , Michel . "
44424	44435	44395	44395	his	150	" You going to take that thing into the cabin ? "
44436	44439	44441	44441	Peyrol	136	" Yes , "
44443	44454	44441	44441	Peyrol	136	" The cabin is used to that kind of thing , "
44462	44481	44457	44457	he	136	" It has been a death - trap for better people than this fellow , whoever he is . "
44741	44750	44752	44752	Peyrol	136	" Go on deck to keep a lookout , "
44754	44767	44752	44752	Peyrol	136	" We may have to fight yet before the night 's out . "
45077	45087	45051	45051	he	136	" Hullo ! Hullo ! Wake up , shipmate ! "
45099	45104	45051	45051	he	136	" Voil ! Voil ! "
45133	45139	45114	45114	Michel	150	" You called , matre ? "
45140	45143	45145	45145	Peyrol	136	" Yes , "
45147	45157	45145	45145	Peyrol	136	" Come along and help me to shift him . "
45158	45161	45163	45163	Michel	150	" Overboard ? "
45166	45169	45171	45171	Peyrol	136	" No , "
45173	45186	45187	45187	he	136	" into that bunk . Steady ! Do n't bang his head , "
45193	45232	45187	45187	he	136	" Throw a blanket over him . Stay in the cabin and keep his bandages wetted with salt water . I do n't think anybody will trouble you to - night . I am going to the house . "
45233	45242	45244	45244	Michel	150	" The day is not very far off , "
45437	45441	45429	45429	himself	136	" Anything new ? "
45450	45459	45442	45442	She	127	" She has taken to roaming at night . "
45652	45659	45636	45636	He	136	" He 's anything but dead , "
45757	45768	45754	45754	Michel	150	" This is the third time he starts this game . "
45769	45776	45778	45778	Peyrol	136	" Not much strength in this , "
45781	45793	45795	45795	Michel	150	" That he can do it at all is a miracle , "
45802	45877	45878	45878	Peyrol	136	" He stands on the ladder and beats the door with his fists . He is getting better . He began about half an hour after I got back on board . He drummed for a bit and then fell off the ladder . I heard him . I had my ear against the scuttle . He lay there and talked to himself for a long time . Then he went at it again . "
45888	45904	45885	45885	his	150	" He will go on like that for ever . You ca n't stop him . "
45905	45909	45911	45911	Peyrol	136	" Easy there , "
45918	45925	45911	45911	Peyrol	136	" Time you finish that noise . "
45998	46002	45992	45992	he	150	" Stand clear ! "
46076	46081	46086	46086	he	136	" That will do . "
46089	46102	46086	46086	he	136	" You look bien malade , hein ? What you call sick , "
46115	46121	46086	46086	he	136	" We will remedy that . "
46122	46127	46129	46130	the prisoner	1542	" Who are you ? "
46215	46222	46208	46208	He	136	" My throat 's like tinder , "
46227	46236	46208	46208	He	136	" Was it you who broke my head ? "
46237	46242	46244	46244	Peyrol	136	" It was me , "
46265	46275	46277	46278	the other	506	" What the devil did you do that for ? "
46290	46327	46277	46278	the other	506	" Because you put your nose where you no business . Understand ? I see you there under the moon , pench , eating my tartane with your eyes . You never hear me , hein ? "
46328	46343	46277	46278	the other	506	" I believe you walked on air . Did you mean to kill me ? "
46344	46365	46277	46278	the other	506	" Yes , in preference to letting you go and make a story of it on board your cursed corvette . "
46366	46386	46277	46278	the other	506	" Well then , now 's your chance to finish me . I am as weak as a kitten . "
46387	46402	46404	46404	Peyrol	136	" How did you say that ? Kitten ? Ha , ha , ha ! "
46406	46414	46415	46415	He	136	" You make a nice petit chat . "
46427	46430	46431	46431	he	136	" There , "
46441	46449	46431	46431	he	136	" it 's good drink - that . "
46560	46590	46546	46546	he	144	" You played a damned dirty trick on me . Call yourself a man , walking on air behind a fellow 's back and felling him like a bullock ? "
46600	46639	46591	46591	Peyrol	136	" If I had met you anywhere else but looking at my tartane I would have done nothing to you . I would have permitted you to go back to your boat . Where was your damned boat ? "
46640	46669	46546	46546	he	144	" How can I tell you ? I ca n't tell where I am . I 've never been here before . How long have I been here ? "
46670	46677	46679	46679	Peyrol	136	" Oh , about fourteen hours , "
46681	46695	46697	46698	the other	506	" My head feels as if it would fall off if I moved , "
46703	46716	46697	46698	the other	506	" You are a damned bungler , that 's what you are . "
46717	46723	46745	46745	Peyrol	136	" What for - bungler ? "
46724	46733	46734	46734	He	136	" For not finishing me off at once . "
46767	46789	46755	46755	He	136	" How could I know it was you ? I hit hard enough to crack the skull of any other man . "
46790	46843	46745	46745	Peyrol	136	" What do you mean ? What do you know about my skull ? What are you driving at ? I do n't know you , you white - headed villain , going about at night knocking people on the head from behind . Did you do for our officer , too ? "
46844	46869	46734	46734	He	136	" Oh yes ! Your officer . What was he up to ? What trouble did you people come to make here , anyhow ? "
46870	46969	46970	46970	He	1549	" Do you think they tell a boat 's crew ? Go and ask our officer . He went up the gully and our coxswain got the jumps . He says to me : ` You are light - footed , Sam , says he ; ` you just creep round the head of the cove and see if our boat can be seen across from the other side . Well , I could n't see anything . That was all right . But I thought 1 would climb a little higher amongst the rocks . . . . "
46974	46983	46985	46985	Peyrol	136	" That was a silly thing to do , "
46991	47111	46985	46985	Peyrol	136	" I would 've sooner expected to see an elephant inland than a craft lying in a pool that seemed no bigger than my hand . Could not understand how she got there . Could n't help going down to find out - and the next thing I knew 1 was lying on my back with my head tied up , in a bunk in this kennel of a cabin here . Why could n't you have given me a hail and engaged me properly , yardarm to yardarm ? You would have got me all the same , because all I had in the way of weapons was the clasp - knife which you have looted off me . "
47112	47119	47121	47121	Peyrol	136	" Up on the shelf there , "
47126	47149	47121	47121	Peyrol	136	" No , my friend , I was n't going to take the risk of seeing you spread your wings and fly . "
47150	47192	47193	47193	Peyrol	136	" You need not have been afraid for your tartane . Our boat was after no tartane . We would n't have taken your tartane for a gift . Why , we see them by dozens every day - those tartanes . "
47200	47203	47204	47204	he	136	" Ah , "
47207	47239	47204	47204	he	136	" I daresay you see many tartanes , but this one is not like the others . You a sailor - and you could n't see that she was something extraordinary . "
47240	47245	47247	47248	the other	506	" Hellfire and gunpowder ! "
47250	47278	47247	47248	the other	506	" How can you expect me to have seen anything ? I just noticed that her sails were bent before your club hit me on the head . "
47289	47305	47281	47281	his	136	" Oh lord , I feel as though I had been drunk for a month . "
48294	48299	48300	48300	he	136	" Sacre tte dure , "
48377	48405	48367	48367	Peyrol	136	" I am an Englishman , I am . I am not going to knuckle under to anybody . What are you going to do with me ? "
48406	48414	48416	48416	Peyrol	136	" I will do what I please , "
48428	48461	48416	48416	Peyrol	136	" Well , then , be quick about it , whatever it is . I do n't care a damn what you do , but - be - quick - about it . "
48523	48528	48519	48519	he	136	" Allons . Drink . "
48560	48565	48566	48566	he	136	" Trinquons , eh ? "
48579	48587	48588	48588	he	136	" I 'm damned if I do , "
48607	48626	48627	48627	He	136	" You will have to explain to me first what you meant by knocking me on the head . "
48659	48711	48653	48653	he	136	" Sacr imbcile , va ! Did I not tell you it was because of the tartane ? If it had n't been for the tartane I would have hidden from you . I would have crouched behind a bush like a - what do you call them ? - livre . "
48728	48735	48737	48737	Peyrol	136	" You are of no account , "
48739	48766	48737	48737	Peyrol	136	" Ah ! if you had been an officer I would have gone for you anywhere . Did you say your officer went up the gully ? "
48773	48791	48767	48767	Symons	144	" That 's the way he went . We had heard on board of a house thereabouts . "
48792	48801	48803	48803	Peyrol	136	" Oh , he went to the house ! "
48805	48833	48803	48803	Peyrol	136	" Well , if he did get there he must be very sorry for himself . There is half a company of infantry billeted in the farm . "
48894	48909	48910	48910	he	1617	" What the devil have they stuck soldiers on this piece of rock for ? "
48913	48938	48910	48910	he	1617	" Oh , signalling post and things like that . I am not likely to tell you everything . Why ! you might escape . "
49008	49066	49067	49067	Peyrol	136	" You will have to get some of these soldiers to carry me up . I wo n't walk . I wo n't . Not after having had my brains nearly knocked out from behind . I tell you straight ! I wo n't walk . Not a step . They will have to carry me ashore . "
49074	49088	49090	49090	Symons	144	" Now you go and get a corporal with a file of men , "
49093	49186	49187	49187	He	1625	" I want to be made a proper prisoner of . Who the devil are you ? You had no right to interfere . I believe you are a civilian . A common marinero , whatever you may call yourself . You look to me a pretty fishy marinero at that . Where did you learn English ? In prison - eh ? You ai n't going to keep me in this damned dog - hole , on board your rubbishy tartane . Go and get that corporal , I tell you . "
49196	49205	49187	49187	He	1625	" I am an Englishman , I am . "
49213	49222	49223	49223	he	136	" Do n't you talk about the tartane , "
49235	49304	49223	49223	he	136	" I told you she was not like the other tartanes . That is because she is a courier boat . Every time she goes to sea she makes a pied - de - nez , what you call thumb to the nose , to all your English cruisers . I do not mind telling you because you are my prisoner . You will soon learn French now . "
49305	49318	49320	49322	the undaunted Symons	144	" Who are you ? The caretaker of this thing or what ? "
49413	49416	49422	49422	his	144	" fishy mariners "
49454	49459	49460	49460	He	136	" Come , grandfather ! "
49473	49488	49460	49460	He	136	" Come ! Let us finish what 's in that tiny bottle of yours . "
49489	49492	49494	49494	Peyrol	136	" No , "
49511	49514	49516	49516	Symons	144	" No ? "
49530	49536	49516	49516	Symons	144	" You must be a tinker "
49562	49564	49540	49540	He	144	" cochon "
49678	49690	49670	49670	Michel	150	" It looks as if he were not going to die . "
49691	49696	49698	49698	Peyrol	136	" He is dead , "
49703	49721	49698	49698	Peyrol	136	" Dead drunk . And you very likely will not see me till to - morrow sometime . "
49722	49730	49732	49732	Michel	150	" But what am I to do ? "
49735	49738	49740	49740	Peyrol	136	" Nothing , "
49742	49756	49740	49740	Peyrol	136	" Of course you must not let him set fire to the tartane . "
49757	49761	49763	49763	Michel	150	" But suppose , "
49765	49773	49763	49763	Michel	150	" he should give signs of escaping . "
49774	49783	49785	49785	Peyrol	136	" If you see him trying to escape , "
49790	49836	49785	49785	Peyrol	136	" then , Michel , it will be a sign for you to get out of his way as quickly as you can . A man who would try to escape with a head like this on him would just swallow you at one mouthful . "
50356	51582	51584	51584	he	1663	" cr nom de nom , staring at a silly bench with no one on it ? Was he going wrong in his head ? Or was it that he was getting really old ? He had noticed old men losing themselves like that . But he had something to do . First of all he had to go and see what the English sloop in the Passe was doing . While he was making his way towards the lookout on the hill where the inclined pine hung peering over the cliff as if an insatiable curiosity were holding it in that precarious position , Peyrol had another view from above of the farmyard and of the buildings and was again affected by their deserted appearance . Not a soul , not even an animal seemed to have been left ; only on the roofs the pigeons walked with smart elegance . Peyrol hurried on and presently saw the English ship well over on the Porquerolles side with her yards braced tip and her head to the southward . There was a little wind in the Passe , while the dull silver of the open had a darkling rim of rippled water far away to the cast in that quarter where , far or near , but mostly out of sight , the British Fleet kept its endless watch . Not a shadow of a spar or gleam of sail on the horizon betrayed its presence ; but Peyrol would not have been surprised to see a crowd of ships surge up , people the horizon with hostile life , come in running , and dot the sea with their ordered groups all about Cape Cici , parading their damned impudence . Then indeed that corvette , the big factor of everyday life on that stretch of coast , would become very small potatoes indeed ; and the man in command of her he had been Peyrol 's personal adversary in many imaginary encounters fought to a finish in the room upstairs then indeed that Englishman would have to mind his steps . He would be ordered to come within hail of the Admiral , be sent here and there , made to run like a little dog and as likely as not get called on board the flagship and get a dressing down for something or other . Peyrol thought for a moment that the impudence of this Englishman was going to take the form of running along the peninsula and looking into the very cove ; for the corvette 's head was falling off slowly . A fear for his tartane clutched Peyrol 's heart till he remembered that the Englishman did not know of her existence . Of course not . His cudgel had been absolutely effective in stopping that bit of information . The only Englishman who knew of the existence of the tartane was that fellow with the broken head . Peyrol actually laughed at his momentary scare . Moreover , it was evident that the Englishman did not mean to parade in front of the peninsula . He did not mean to be impudent . The sloop 's yards were swung right round and she came again to the wind but now heading to the northward back from where she came . Peyrol saw at once that the Englishman meant to pass to windward of Cape Esterel , probably with the intention of anchoring for the night off the long white beach which in a regular curve closes the roadstead of Hyres on that side . Peyrol pictured her to himself , on the clouded night , not so very dark since the fall moon was but a day old , lying at anchor within hail of the low shore , with her sails furled and looking profoundly asleep , but with the watch on deck lying by the guns . He gnashed his teeth . It had come to this at last , that the captain of the Amelia could do nothing with his ship without putting Peyrol into a rage . Oh , for forty Brothers , or sixty , picked ones , he thought , to teach the fellow what it might cost him taking liberties along the French coast ! Ships had been carried by surprise before , on nights when there was just light enough to see the whites of each other 's eyes in a close tussle . And what would be the crew of that Englishman ? Something between ninety and a hundred altogether , boys and landsman included . ... Peyrol shook his fist for a good - bye , just when Cape Esterel shut off the English sloop from his sight . But in his heart of hearts that seaman of cosmopolitan associations knew very well that no forty or sixty , not any given hundred Brothers of the Coast would have been enough to capture that corvette making herself at home within ten miles of where he had first opened his eyes to the world . He shook his head dismally at the leaning pine , his only companion . The disinherited soul of that rover ranging for so many years a lawless ocean with the coasts of two continents for a raiding ground , had come back to its crag , circling like a sea - bird in the dusk and longing for a great sea victory for its people : that inland multitude of which Peyrol knew nothing except the few individuals on that peninsula cut off from the rest of the land by the dead water of a salt lagoon ; and where only a strain of manliness in a miserable cripple and an unaccountable charm of a half - crazed woman had found response in his heart . This scheme of false dispatches was but a detail in a plan for a great , a destructive victory . just a detail , but not a trifle all the same . Nothing connected with the deception of an admiral could be called trifling . And such an admiral too . It was , Peyrol felt vaguely , a scheme that only a confounded landsman would invent . It behoved the sailors , however , to make a workable thing of it . It would have to be worked through that corvette . And here Peyrol was brought up by the question that all his life had not been able to settle for him - and that was whether the English were really very stupid or very acute . That difficulty had presented itself with every fresh case . The old rover had enough genius in him to have arrived at a general conclusion that if they were to be deceived at all it could not be done very well by words but rather by deeds ; not by mere wriggling , but by deep craft concealed under some sort of straightforward action . That conviction , however , did not take him forward in this case , which was one in which much thinking would be necessary . The Amelia had disappeared behind Cape Esterel , and Peyrol wondered with a certain anxiety whether this meant that the Englishman had given up his man for good . "
51587	51593	51584	51584	he	1663	" said Peyrol to himself , "
51612	52128	52129	52129	You	1664	" If , however , he did not see the ship again within the next hour or two , then she would be anchored off the beach , to wait for the night before making some attempt to discover what had become of her man . This could be done only by sending out one or two boats to explore the coast , and no doubt to enter the cove - perhaps even to land a small search party . After coming to this conclusion Peyrol began deliberately to charge his pipe . Had he spared a moment for a glance inland he might have caught a whisk of a black skirt , the gleam of a white fichu - Arlette running down the faint track leading from Escampobar to the village in the hollow ; the same track in fact up which Citizen Scevola , while indulging in the strange freak to visit the church , had been chased by the incensed faithful . But Peyrol , while charging and lighting his pipe , had kept his eyes fastened on Cape Esterel . Then , throwing his arm affectionately over the trunk of the pine , he had settled himself to watch . Far below him the roadstead , with its play of grey and bright gleams , looked like a plaque of mother - of - pearl in a frame of yellow rocks and dark green ravines set off inland by the masses of the hills displaying the tint of the finest purple ; while above his head the sun , behind a cloud - veil , hung like a silver disc . That afternoon , after waiting in vain for Lieutenant Ral to appear outside in the usual way , Arlette , the mistress of Escampobar , had gone unwillingly into the kitchen where Catherine sat upright in a heavy capacious wooden armchair , the back of which rose above the top of her white muslin cap . Even in her old age , even in her hours of ease , Catherine preserved the upright carriage of the family that had held Escampobar for so many generations . It would have been easy to believe that , like some characters famous in the world , Catherine would have wished to die standing up and with unbowed shoulders . With her sense of hearing undecayed she detected the light footsteps in the salle long before Arlette entered the kitchen . That woman , who had faced alone and unaided except for her brother 's comprehending silence the anguish of passion in a forbidden love , and of terrors comparable to those of the judgment Day , neither turned her face , quiet without serenity , nor her eyes , fearless but without fire , in the direction of her niece . Arlette glanced on all sides , even at the walls , even at the mound of ashes under the big overmantel , nursing in its heart a spark of fire , before she sat down and leaned her elbow on the table . "
52138	52155	52129	52129	You	1664	" said her aunt , sitting by the hearth like an old queen on her throne . "
52165	52166	52157	52157	you	1664	" "
52169	52173	52157	52157	you	1664	" remarked Catherine , "
52190	52191	52192	52192	I	0	" "
52242	52320	52225	52225	I	0	" Catherine turned her face away . Arlette rested her head on her half - closed hand , and her eyes , losing their steadiness , began to tremble amongst cruel visions . She got up suddenly and caressed the thin , half - averted , withered cheek with the tips of her fingers , and in a low voice , with that marvellous cadence that plucked at one 's heart - strings , she said coaxingly : "
52329	52434	52225	52225	I	0	" In her immobilitv the old woman called with all the might of her will for the presence of Peyrol . She had never been able to shake off a superstitious fear of that niece restored to her from the terrors of a Judgment Day in which the world had been given over to the devils . She was always afraid that this girl , wandering about with restless eyes and a dim smile on her silent lips , would suddenly say something atrocious , unfit to be heard , calling for vengeance from heaven , unless Peyrol were by . That stranger come from "
52439	52489	52490	52490	I	0	" was out of it altogether , cared probably for no one in the world but had struck her imagination by his massive aspect , his deliberation suggesting a mighty force like the reposeful attitude of a lion . Arlette desisted from caressing the irresponsive cheek , exclaimed petulantly : "
52495	52547	52490	52490	I	0	" and went out of the kitchen without having asked her aunt the question she had meant to ask , which was whether she knew what had become of the lieutenant . Her heart had failed her . She let herself drop on the bench outside the door of the salle . "
52556	52560	52561	52561	I	0	" she thought . "
52581	52751	52752	52752	Eugne	174	" Even Peyrol , so different from all mankind , who from the first moment when he stood before her had the power to soothe her aimless unrest , even Peyrol would now sit for hours with the lieutenant on the bench , gazing into the air and keeping him in talk about things without sense , as if on purpose to prevent him from thinking of her . Well , he could not do that . But the enormous change implied in the fact that every day had a to - morrow now , and that all the people around her had ceased to be mere phantoms for her wandering glances to glide over without concern , made her feel the need of support from somebody , from somewhere . She could have cried aloud for it . She sprang up and walked along the whole front of the farm building . At the end of the wall enclosing the orchard she called out in a modulated undertone : "
52754	52814	52815	52815	Eugne	174	" not because she hoped that the lieutenant was anywhere within earshot , but for the pleasure of hearing the sound of the name uttered for once above a whisper . She turned about and at the end of the wall on the yard side she repeated her call , drinking in the sound that came from her lips , "
52819	53679	52817	52817	Eugne	174	" with a sort of half - exulting despair . It was in such dizzy moments that she wanted a steadying support . But all was still . She heard no friendly murmur , not even a sigh . Above her head under the thin grey sky a big mulberry tree stirred no leaf . Step by step , as if unconsciously , she began to move down the track . At the end of fifty yards she opened the inland view , the roofs of the village between the green tops of the platanes overshadowing the fountain , and just beyond the flat blue - grey level of the salt lagoon , smooth and dull like a slab of lead . But what drew her on was the church - tower , where , in a round arch , she could see the black speck of the bell which escaping the requisitions of the Republican wars , and dwelling mute above the locked - up empty church , had only lately recovered its voice . She ran on , but when she had come near enough to make out the figures moving about the village fountain , she checked herself , hesitated a moment and then took the footpath leading to the presbytery . She pushed open the little gate with the broken latch . The humble building of rough stones , from between which much mortar had crumbled out , looked as though it had been sinking slowly into the ground . The beds of the plot in front were choked with weeds , because the abb had no taste for gardening . When the heiress of Escampobar opened the door , he was walking up and down the largest room which was his bedroom and sitting room and where he also took his meals . He was a gaunt man with a long , as if convulsed , face . In his young days he had been tutor to the sons of a great noble , but he did not emigrate with his employer . Neither did he submit to the Republic . He had lived in his native land like a hunted wild beast , and there had been many tales of his activities , warlike and others . When the hierarchy was re - established he found no favour in the eyes of his superiors . He had remained too much of a Royalist . He had accepted , without a word , the charge of this miserable parish , where he had acquired influence quickly enough . His sacerdotalism lay in him like a cold passion . Though accessible enough , he never walked abroad without his breviary , acknowledging the solemnly bared heads by a curt nod . He was not exactly feared , but some of the oldest inhabitants who remembered the previous incumbent , an old man who died in the garden after having been dragged out of bed by some patriots anxious to take him to prison in Hyres , jerked their heads sideways in a knowing manner when their cur was mentioned . On seeing this apparition in an Arlesian cap and silk skirt , a white fichu , and otherwise as completely different as any princess could be from the rustics with whom he was in daily contact , his face expressed the blankest astonishment . Then - for he knew enough of the gossip of his community - his straight , thick eyebrows came together inimically . This was no doubt the woman of whom he had heard his parishioners talk with bated breath as having given herself and her property up to a Jacobin , a Toulon sans - culotte who had either delivered her parents to execution or had murdered them himself during the first three days of massacres . No one was very sure which it was , but the rest was current knowledge . The abb , though persuaded that any amount of moral turpitude was possible in a godless country , had not accepted all that tale literally . No doubt those people were republican and impious , and the state of affairs up there was scandalous and horrible . He struggled with his feelings of repulsion and managed to smooth his brow and waited . He could not imagine what that woman with mature form and a youthful face could want at the presbytery . Suddenly it occurred to him that perhaps she wanted to thank him - it was a very old occurrence - for interposing between the fury of the villagers and that man . He could n't call him , even in his thoughts , her husband , for apart from all other circumstances , that connection could not imply any kind of marriage to a priest , even had there been legal form observed . His visitor was apparently disconcerted by the expression of his face , the austere aloofness of his attitude , and only a low murmur escaped her lips . He bent his head and was not very certain what he had heard . "
53687	53746	53680	53680	You	1671	" he asked in a doubting tone . She nodded slightly , and the abb went to the door she had left half open and looked out . There was not a soul in sight between the presbytery and the village , or between the presbytery and the church . He went back to face her , saying : "
53770	53845	53757	53762	The old woman in the kitchen	1673	" Now that he had been looking at Arlette closer the abb felt a sort of dread . The carmine of those lips , the pellucid , unstained , unfathomable blackness of those eyes , the pallor of her cheeks , suggested to him something provokingly pagan , something distastefully different from the common sinners of this earth . And now she was ready to speak . He arrested her with a raised hand . "
53848	53852	53853	53853	I	0	" he said . "
53888	53918	53919	53919	I	0	" Sombre under their bony arches , his eyes fastened on her face , noticed the delicacy of features , the naive pertinacity of her stare . She said : "
53924	53925	53926	53927	The daughter	1676	" "
53946	53953	53971	53971	they	1678	" She said a little impatiently : "
53958	53968	53955	53956	that rabble	1678	" and the priest remained mute for a moment . "
54012	54056	54057	54057	They	1678	" The absence of scorn in her tone was perfectly annihilating . Gentle sounds flowed from her lips and a disturbing charm from her strange equanimity . The abb frowned heavily at these fascinations , which seemed to have in them something diabolic . "
54103	54115	54116	54138	That man whose name you have just pronounced and which I have heard coupled with the epithet of ` blood - drinker '	1681	" He was exasperated by the unconsciousness of that fair face . "
54160	54161	54171	54171	he	1681	" "
54187	54188	54182	54182	Catherine	127	" "
54193	54199	54200	54200	She	127	" the abb asked harshly . "
54274	54290	54266	54270	the people in the village	1691	" She dropped her eyes and seemed to fall into deep thought , then added , "
54334	54344	54326	54326	he	1681	" She ceased but did not raise her eyes . "
54352	54373	54345	54345	You	0	" began the abb in a severe voice , frowning at her downcast eyes , and he heard a murmur : "
54378	54385	54386	54386	I	0	" He disregarded it and continued : "
54413	54414	54408	54408	you	0	" "
54418	54427	54408	54408	you	0	" she said , raising her eyes fearlessly , "
54460	54570	54438	54438	I	0	" For all answer the abb made a weary gesture and turned away to walk up and down the room . His face expressed neither curiosity nor pity , but a sort of repugnance which he made an effort to overcome . He dropped into a deep and shabby old armchair , the only object of luxury in the room , and pointed to a wooden straight - backed stool . Arlette sat down on it and began to speak . The abb listened , but looking far away ; his big bony hands rested on the arms of the chair . After the first words he interrupted her : "
54581	54582	54573	54573	your	0	" "
54585	54589	54573	54573	your	0	" said Arlette . "
54598	54599	54602	54602	Monsieur	1698	" "
54605	54606	54602	54602	Monsieur	1698	" "
54610	54642	54643	54643	You	0	" He bent his head a little , without , however , ceasing to look far away . Her voice now was very low . Suddenly the abb threw himself back . "
54660	54661	54643	54643	You	0	" "
54680	54712	54715	54715	I	0	" He turned his head to look at her grimly , but he said nothing and looked away again . He listened . At the beginning he muttered once or twice , "
54720	54741	54742	54742	You	0	" and then kept silent , not looking at her at all . Once he interrupted her by a question : "
54756	54757	54776	54779	two of those ladies	1702	" "
54760	54764	54776	54779	two of those ladies	1702	" she said , "
54772	54773	54776	54779	two of those ladies	1702	" "
54787	54788	54778	54779	those ladies	1703	" "
54859	54877	54848	54848	you	1315	" she asked , and waited with parted lips . With an impassible face the abb murmured : "
54884	55278	54878	54878	He	1315	" in a tone of bitter fatalism , which seemed to absolve that man and all the other men of whose actions and errors he had ever heard . For a long time , Arlette continued , her father could not discover the house where the nuns had taken refuge . He only obtained some information on the very day before the English evacuated Toulon . Late in the day he appeared before her and took her away . The town was full of retreating foreign troops . Her father left her with her mother and went out again to make preparations for sailing home that very night ; but the tartane was no longer in the place where he had left her lying . The two Madrague men that he had for a crew had disappeared also . Thus the family was trapped in that town full of tumult and confusion . Ships and houses were bursting into flames . Appalling explosions of gunpowder shook the earth . She spent that night on her knees with her face hidden in her mother 's lap , while her father kept watch by the barricaded door with a pistol in each hand . In the morning the house was filled with savage yells . People were heard rushing up the stairs , and the door was burst in . She jumped up at the crash and flung herself down on her knees in a corner with her face to the wall . There was a murderous uproar , she heard two shots fired , then somebody seized her by the arm and pulled her up to her feet . It was Scevola . He dragged her to the door . The bodies of her father and mother were lying across the doorway . The room was full of gunpowder smoke . She wanted to fling herself on the bodies and cling to them , but Scevola took her under the arms and lifted her over them . He seized her hand and made her run with him , or rather dragged her downstairs . Outside on the pavement some dreadful men and many fierce women with knives joined them . They ran along the streets brandishing pikes and sabres , pursuing other groups of unarmed people , who fled round corners with loud shrieks . "
55290	55299	55279	55279	I	0	" Arlette went on in a breathless murmur . "
55455	55515	55516	55516	I	0	" The eyes of the priest in their deep orbits glided towards her and then resumed their far - away fixity . Between his fatalism and his faith he was not very far from the belief of Satan taking possession of rebellious mankind , exposing the nakedness of hearts like flint and of the homicidal souls of the Revolution . "
55523	55534	55516	55516	I	0	" he whispered stealthily . She affirmed with quiet earnestness : "
55546	55710	55543	55543	my	0	" That night Scevola put her under the care of a woman called Perose . She was young and pretty and was a native of Arles , her mother 's country . She kept an inn . That woman locked her up in her own room , which was next to the room where the patriots kept on shouting , singing and making speeches far into the night . Several times the woman would look in for a moment , make a hopeless gesture at her with both arms , and vanish again . Later , on many other nights when all the band lay asleep on benches and on the floor , Perose would steal into the room , fall on her knees by the bed on which Arlette sat upright , open - eyed , and raving silently to herself , embrace her feet and cry herself to sleep . But in the morning she would jump up briskly and say : "
55734	55817	55820	55820	Monsieur	1717	" ; and they would join the band that was making ready for another day of traitor hunting . But after a time the victims , of which the streets were full at first , had to be sought for in back - yards , ferreted out of their hiding - places , dragged up out of the cellars , or down from the garrets of the houses , which would be entered by the band with howls of death and vengeance . "
55823	55827	55820	55820	Monsieur	1717	" said Arlette , "
55978	56013	55970	55970	She	179	" My time will come soon . You , Scevola , do n't you show yourself in Toulon , because nobody believes in you any more . Adieu , Arlette . Vive la Nation ! "
56228	56229	56203	56203	People	287	" "
56241	56250	56233	56233	you	1737	" asked the abb in a low voice . "
56292	56293	56289	56289	I	0	" "
56296	56316	56317	56317	You	1742	" thundered the abb , getting up . He saw her candid gaze uplifted and lowered his voice forcibly . "
56452	56472	56489	56491	Monsieur le Cur	180	" Arlette , lowering her eyes slowly , appealed to the abb as a symbolic figure of spiritual mystery . "
56483	56488	56489	56491	Monsieur le Cur	180	" he asked himself . "
56493	56498	56489	56491	Monsieur le Cur	180	" she said quietly , "
56529	56530	56526	56526	your	180	" "
56541	56546	56547	56547	I	0	" said the abb . "
56575	56576	56563	56563	you	0	" "
56579	56584	56563	56563	you	0	" murmured the abb , "
56598	56599	56600	56600	I	0	" "
56621	56622	56611	56611	you	0	" "
56632	56772	56611	56611	you	0	" he said , rousing himself and taking down a key that hung on the wall . He put on his broad - brimmed hat and without a word led the way through the wicket gate and along the path which he always used himself and which was out of sight of the village fountain . After they had entered the damp and dilapidated sacristy he locked the door behind them and only then opened another , a smaller one , leading into the church . When he stood aside , Arlette became aware of the chilly odour as of freshly turned - up earth mingled with a faint scent of incense . In the deep dusk of the nave a single little flame glimmered before an image of the virgin . The abb whispered as she passed on : "
56799	56939	56611	56611	you	0	" She did not look at him . Through the thin soles of her shoes she could feel the chill of the flagstones . The abb left the door ajar , sat down on a rush - bottomed chair , the only one in the sacristy , folded his arms and let his chin fall on his breast . He seemed to be sleeping profoundly , but at the end of half an hour he got up and , going to the doorway , stood looking at the kneeling figure sunk low on the altar steps . Arlette 's face was buried in her hands in a passion of piety and prayer . The abb waited patiently for a good many minutes more , before he raised his voice in a grave murmur which filled the whole dark place . "
56956	57019	56948	56948	I	0	" The view of her complete absorption before the Most High had touched him . He stepped back into the sacristy and after a time heard the faintest possible swish of the black silk skirt of the Escampobar daughter in her Arlesian costume . She entered the sacristy lightly with shining eyes , and the abb looked at her with some emotion . "
57028	57032	57020	57020	You	1755	" he said . "
57056	57086	57054	57054	God	153	" She raised her head and stayed her footsteps for a moment . In the dark little place he could see the gleam of her eyes swimming in tears . "
57092	57101	57054	57054	God	153	" she said in her clear seductive voice . "
57143	57303	57137	57137	my	0	" The abb paled under his tan of a village priest and leaned his shoulders against the wall without a word . After leaving the church by the sacristy door Arlette never looked back . The abb saw her flit past the presbytery , and the building hid her from his sight . He did not accuse her of duplicity . He had deceived himself . A heathen . White as her skin was , the blackness of her hair and of her eyes , the dusky red of her lips , suggested a strain of Saracen blood . He gave her up without a sigh . Arlette walked rapidly towards Escampobar as if she could not get there soon enough ; but as she neared the first enclosed field her steps became slower and after hesitating awhile she sat down between two olive trees , near a wall bordered by a growth of thin grass at the foot . "
57311	57317	57319	57320	the abb	3926	" she argued to herself , "
57368	58689	57319	57320	the abb	3926	" But now her true self had returned matured in its mysterious exile , hopeful and eager for love . She was certain that it had never been far away from that outcast body which Catherine had told her lately was fit for no man 's arms . That was all that old woman knew about it , thought Arlette , not in scorn but rather in pity . She knew better , she had gone to heaven for truth in that long prostration with its ardent prayers and its moment of ecstasy before an unlighted altar . She knew its meaning well , and also the meaning of another - of a terrestrial revelation which had come to her that day at noon while she waited on the lieutenant . Everybody else was in the kitchen ; she and Ral were as much alone together as had ever happened to them in their lives . That day she could not deny herself the delight to be near him , to watch him covertly , to hear him perhaps utter a few words , to experience that strange satisfying consciousness of her own existence which nothing but Ral 's presence could give her ; a sort of unimpassioned but all - absorbing bliss , warmth , courage , confidence ! . . . She backed away from Ral 's table , seated herself facing him and cast down her eyes . There was a great stillness in the salle except for the murmur of the voices in the kitchen . She had at first stolen a glance or two and then peeping again through her eyelashes , as it were , she saw his eyes rest on her with a peculiar meaning . This had never happened before . She jumped up , thinking that he wanted something , and while she stood in front of him with her hand resting on the table he stooped suddenly , pressed it to the table with his lips and began kissing it passionately without a sound , endlessly . . . . More startled than surprised at first , then infinitely happy , she was beginning to breathe quickly , when he left off and threw himself back in the chair . She walked away from the table and sat down again to gaze at him openly , steadily , without a smile . But he was not looking at her . His passionate lips were set hard now and his face had an expression of stern despair . No word passed between them . Brusquely he got up with averted eyes and went outside , leaving the food before him unfinished . In the usual course of things , on any other day , she would have got up and followed him , for she had always yielded to the fascination that had first roused her faculties . She would have gone out just to pass in front of him once or twice . But this time she had not obeyed what was stronger than fascination , something within herself which at the same time prompted and restrained her . She only raised her arm and looked at her hand . It was true . It had happened . He had kissed it . Formerly she cared not how gloomy he was as long as he remained somewhere where she could look at him - which she would do at every opportunity with an open and unbridled innocence . But now she knew better than to do that . She had got up , had passed through the kitchen , meeting without embarrassment Catherine 's inquisitive glance , and had gone upstairs . When she came down after a time , he was nowhere to be seen , and everybody else too seemed to have gone into hiding ; Michel , Peyrol , Scevola . . . But if she had met Scevola she would not have spoken to him . It was now a very long time since she had volunteered a conversation with Scevola . She guessed , however , that Scevola had simply gone to lie down in his lair , a narrow shabby room lighted by one glazed little window high up in the end wall . Catherine had put him in there on the very day he had brought her niece home and he had retained it for his own ever since . She could even picture him to herself in there stretched on his pallet . She was capable of that now . Formerly , for years after her return , people that were out of her sight were out of her mind also . Had they run away and left her she would not have thought of them at all . She would have wandered in and out of the empty house and round the empty fields without giving anybody a thought . Peyrol was the first human being she had noticed for years . Peyrol , since he had come , had always existed for her . And as a matter of fact the rover was generally very much in evidence about the farm . That afternoon , however , even Peyrol was not to be seen . Her uneasiness began to grow , but she felt a strange reluctance to go into the kitchen where she knew her aunt would be sitting in the armchair like a presiding genius of the house taking its rest , and unreadable in her immobility . And yet she felt she must talk about Ral to somebody . This was how the idea of going down to the church had come to her . She would talk of him to the priest and to God . The force of old associations asserted itself . She had been taught to believe that one could tell everything to a priest , and that the omnipotent God who know everything could be prayed to , asked for grace , for strength , for mercy , for protection , for pity . She had done it and felt she had been heard . Her heart had quietened down while she rested under the wall . Pulling out a long stalk of grass she twined it round her fingers absently . The veil of cloud had thickened over her head , early dusk had descended upon the earth , and she had not found out what had become of Ral . She jumped to her feet wildly . But directly she had done that she felt the need of self - control . It was with her usual light step that she approached the front of the house and for the first time in her life perceived how barren and sombre it looked when Ral was not about . She slipped in quietly through the door of the main building and ran upstairs . It was dark on the landing . She passed by the door leading into the room occupied by her aunt and herself . It had been her father and mother 's bedroom . The other big room was the lieutenant 's during his visits to Escampobar . Without even a rustle of her dress , like a shadow , she glided along the passage , turned the handle without noise and went in . After shutting the door behind her she listened . There was no sound in the house . Scevola was either already down in the yard or still lying open - eyed on his tumbled pallet in raging sulks about something . She had once accidentally caught , him at it , down on his face , one eye and cheek of which were buried in the pillow , the other eye glaring savagely , and had been scared away by a thick mutter : "
58698	59059	57319	57320	the abb	3926	" And all this had meant nothing to her then . Having ascertained that the inside of the house was as still as the grave , Arlette walked across to the window , which when the lieutenant was occupying the room stood always open and with the shutter pushed right back against the wall . It was of course uncurtained , and as she came near to it Arlette caught sight of Peyrol coming down the hill on his return from the lookout . His white head gleamed like silver against the slope of the ground and by and by passed out of her sight , while her ear caught the sound of his footsteps below the window . They passed into the house , but she did not hear him come upstairs . He had gone into the kitchen . To Catherine . They would talk about her and Eugne . But what would they say ? She was so new to life that everything appeared dangerous : talk , attitudes , glances . She felt frightened at the mere idea of silence between those two . It was possible . Suppose they did n't say anything to each other . That would be awful . Yet she remained calm like a sensible person , who knows that rushing about in excitement is not the way to meet unknown dangers . She swept her eyes over the room and saw the lieutenant 's valise in a corner . That was really what she had wanted to see . He was n't gone then . But it did n't tell her , though she opened it , what had become of him . As to his return , she had no doubt whatever about that . He had always returned . She noticed particularly a large packet sewn up in sail - cloth and with three large red seals on the seam . It did n't , however , arrest her thoughts . Those were still hovering about Catherine and Peyrol downstairs . How changed they were . Had they ever thought that she was mad ? She became indignant . "
59067	59439	59062	59062	I	0	" she asked herself with despair . She sat down on the edge of the bed in her usual attitude , her feet crossed , her hands lying in her lap . She felt on one of them the impress off Ral 's lips , soothing , reassuring like every certitude , but she was aware of a still remaining confusion in her mind , an indefinite weariness like the strain of an imperfect vision trying to discern shifting outlines , floating shapes , incomprehensible signs . She could not resist the temptation of resting her tired body , just for a little while . She lay down on the very edge of the bed , the kissed hand tucked under her cheek . The faculty of thinking abandoned her altogether , but she remained open - eyed , wide awake . In that position , without hearing the slightest sound , she saw the door handle move down as far as it would go , perfectly noiseless , as though the lock had been oiled not long before . Her impulse was to leap right out into the middle of the room , but she restrained herself and only swung herself into a sitting posture . The bed had not creaked . She lowered her feet gently to the ground , and by the time when holding her breath she put her ear against the door , the handle had come back into position . She had detected no sound outside . Not the faintest . Nothing . It never occurred to her to doubt her own eyes , but the whole thing had been so noiseless that it could not have disturbed the lightest sleeper . She was sure that had she been lying on her other side , that is with her back to the door , she would have known nothing . It was some time before she walked away from the door and sat on a chair which stood near a heavy and much - carved table , an heirloom more appropriate to a chteau than to a farmhouse . The dust of many months covered its smooth oval surface of dark , finely grained wood . "
59446	59696	59444	59444	Scevola	123	" thought Arlette . It could have been no one else . What could he have wanted ? She gave herself up to thought , but really she did not care . The absent Ral occupied all her mind . With an unconscious slowness her finger traced in the dust on the table the initials E A and achieved a circle round them . Then she jumped up , unlocked the door and went downstairs . In the kitchen , as she fully expected , she found Scevola with the others . Directly she appeared he got up and ran upstairs , but returned almost immediately looking as if he had seen a ghost , and when Peyrol asked him some insignificant question his lips and even his chin trembled before he could command his voice . He avoided looking anybody in the face . The others too seemed shy of meeting each other 's eyes , and the evening meal of the Escampobar seemed haunted by the absent lieutenant . Peyrol , besides , had his prisoner to think of . His existence presented a most interesting problem , and the proceedings of the English ship were another , closely connected with it and full of dangerous possibilities . Catherine 's black and ungleaming eyes seemed to have sunk deeper in their sockets , but her face wore its habitual severe aloofness of expression . Suddenly Scevola spoke as if in answer to some thought of his own . "
59704	59723	59726	59726	you	1761	" Peyrol swallowed the piece of bread and butter which he had been masticating slowly , and asked : "
59732	59733	59726	59726	you	1761	" "
59741	59753	59734	59734	I	0	" answered Scevola , in a more assured tone than usual . "
59827	59828	59822	59823	the Terror	1769	" "
59838	59842	59831	59831	you	1761	" growled Peyrol . "
59866	59993	59863	59863	you	1761	" he added in a good - humoured tone . Arlette , leaning her head on her left hand , was tracing with the forefinger of her right invisible initials on the table - cloth . Catherine , stooping to light a four - beaked oil lamp mounted on a brass pedestal , turned her finely carved face over her shoulder . The sans - culotte jumped up , flinging his arms about . His hair was tousled from his sleepless tumbling on his pallet . The unbuttoned sleeves of his shirt flapped against his thin hairy forearms . He no longer looked as though he had seen a ghost . He opened a wide black mouth , but Peyrol raised his finger at him calmly . "
60069	60182	60056	60056	people	287	" Scevola , who had shut his mouth , glanced over his shoulder , and as if impressed by his unsupported state went out of the kitchen , reeling , like a man who had been drinking . He had drunk nothing but water . Peyrol looked thoughtfully at the door which the indignant sans - culotte had slammed after him . During the colloquy between the two men , Arlette had disappeared into the salle . Catherine , straightening her long back , put the oil lamp with its four smoky flames on the table . It lighted her face from below . Peyrol moved it slightly aside before he spoke . "
60189	60196	60187	60187	you	1771	" he said , gazing upwards , "
60211	60212	60198	60198	Scevola	123	" "
60215	60219	60198	60198	Scevola	123	" she admitted . "
60316	60502	60503	60503	Peyrol	136	" He talked to me of his republican virtue . He was not a profligate . He could wait . She was , he said , sacred to him , and things like that . He would walk up and down for hours talking of her and I would sit there listening to him with the key of the room the child was locked in , in my pocket . I temporized , and , as you say yourself , it was perhaps because he had no one at his back that he did not try to kill me , which he might have done any day . I temporized . And after all , why should he want to kill me ? He told me more than once he was sure to have Arlette for his own . Many a time he made me shiver explaining why it must be so . She owed her life to him . Oh ! that dreadful crazy life . You know he is one of those men that can be patient as far as women are concerned . "
60507	60545	60503	60503	Peyrol	136	" Yes , some are like that . That kind is more impatient sometimes to spill blood . Still I think that your life was one long narrow escape , at least till I turned up here . "
60546	60554	60556	60556	Catherine	127	" Things had settled down , somehow , "
60558	60579	60556	60556	Catherine	127	" But all the same I was glad when you appeared here , a grey - headed man , serious . "
60580	60591	60593	60593	Peyrol	136	" Grey hairs will come to any sort of man , "
60596	60614	60593	60593	Peyrol	136	" and you did not know me . You do n't know anything of me even now . "
60615	60631	60633	60633	Catherine	127	" There have been Peyrols living less than half a day 's journey from here , "
60639	60645	60647	60648	the rover	822	" That 's all right , "
60660	60679	60655	60655	she	127	" What 's the matter ? Are n't you one of them ? Is n't Peyrol your name ? "
60680	60714	60593	60593	Peyrol	136	" I have had many names and this was one of them . So this name and my grey hair pleased you , Catherine ? They gave you confidence in me , hein ? "
60715	60758	60655	60655	she	127	" I was n't sorry to see you come . Scevola too , I believe . He heard that patriots were being hunted down , here and there , and he was growing quieter every day . You roused the child wonderfully . "
60759	60767	60655	60655	she	127	" And did that please Scevola too ? "
60768	60797	60799	60799	Catherine	127	" Before you came she never spoke to anybody unless first spoken to . She did n't seem to care where she was . At the same time , "
60891	60892	60878	60878	I	0	" "
60899	60906	60878	60878	I	0	" said Peyrol in an undertone . "
60916	60917	60913	60913	I	0	" "
60929	60941	60922	60922	you	1780	" Catherine said with unbending mien and in an unflinching voice . "
61002	61003	60993	60993	I	0	" "
61008	61012	60993	60993	I	0	" repeated Peyrol . "
61020	61024	61028	61028	you	1780	" said Catherine , "
61034	61035	61028	61028	you	1780	" "
61050	61078	61041	61043	some Indian witch	1784	" muttered Peyrol , so low that Catherine could not hear the words . But she did not seem to care , and presently went on again : "
61096	61097	61092	61092	her	1284	" "
61100	61105	61092	61092	her	1284	" assented Peyrol grimly . "
61122	61123	61112	61112	She	1284	" "
61141	61163	61128	61128	you	0	" said Catherine , speaking with a sort of regal composure down at Peyrol , like a chieftainess of a tribe . "
61182	61183	61184	61184	She	1284	" "
61190	61196	61187	61188	a child	2774	" struck in Peyrol abruptly . "
61223	61224	61227	61227	Peyrol	136	" "
61257	61258	61252	61252	I	0	" "
61269	61273	61274	61274	You	0	" muttered Peyrol . "
61283	61284	61274	61274	You	0	" "
61291	61297	61288	61288	I	0	" insisted Catherine without animation . "
61325	61343	61348	61348	you	0	" Peyrol , who had let his head fall on his breast , jerked it up suddenly . "
61352	61357	61348	61348	you	0	" he cried angrily . "
61366	61367	61348	61348	you	0	" "
61386	61393	61394	61394	I	0	" remarked Catherine . . . . "
61417	61418	61413	61413	he	2881	" "
61422	61426	61419	61419	I	0	" said Peyrol . "
61436	61437	61428	61428	he	2881	" "
61461	61469	61447	61447	you	0	" pronounced Catherine in an ominous voice . "
61517	61518	61519	61520	No man	502	" "
61527	61536	61537	61537	I	0	" opined Peyrol after a moment 's silence . "
61548	61549	61550	61550	You	0	" "
61598	61599	61591	61591	yourself	0	" "
61608	61635	61602	61606	a chicken - hearted spouter	1798	" said Peyrol contemptuously , but it did not affect Catherine 's attitude of an old sibyl risen from the tripod to prophesy calmly atrocious disasters . "
61642	61649	61650	61650	He	2881	" commented Peyrol with increased scorn . "
61659	61660	61650	61650	He	2881	" "
61667	61671	61650	61650	He	2881	" said Catherine . "
61764	61765	61766	61766	You	0	" "
61770	61784	61766	61766	You	0	" said the rover profoundly . He pondered full of his own experience . "
61792	61799	61786	61786	he	2881	" he muttered after a pause . "
61805	61806	61800	61800	You	0	" "
61812	61821	61807	61807	I	0	" repeated Catherine in a slightly indignant tone . "
61889	61890	61876	61876	my	0	" "
61900	61908	61894	61898	the lieutenant he is after	1803	" observed Peyrol in a lowered voice . "
61920	61921	61911	61911	I	0	" "
61930	61981	61982	61982	I	0	" whispered Catherine in a tone betraying her secret anguish . Peyrol rose quietly and went into the salle , leaving the door open . Catherine heard the latch of the outer door being lifted cautiously . In a few moments Peyrol returned as quietly as he had gone out . "
62013	62020	62004	62004	One	2670	" He lowered his voice considerably . "
62050	62051	62052	62052	She	121	" "
62065	62077	62079	62079	she	121	" affirmed Catherine , now in complete control of her voice . "
62110	62111	62101	62101	God	153	" "
62122	62130	62120	62120	her	121	" admitted Peyrol with a heavy sigh . "
62134	62141	62131	62132	This lieutenant	1808	" he continued after a pause , "
62240	62241	62229	62229	she	121	" "
62246	62252	62229	62229	she	121	" said the old woman . "
62312	62313	62298	62298	she	121	" "
62320	62324	62298	62298	she	121	" said Peyrol . "
62370	62393	62362	62362	I	0	" Her fine brown face seemed to grow more impassive before she went on much lower and as if arguing with herself : "
62425	62445	62446	62446	She	121	" The last words made Peyrol start . He had almost forgotten that story . He said to himself : "
62455	62456	62446	62446	She	121	" "
62462	62467	62460	62460	Catherine	127	" he said decisively , "
62516	62517	62511	62511	he	2881	" "
62542	62553	62554	62562	A man who has received a sign from death	1820	" she announced in a tone of solemn unemotional conviction . "
62569	62591	62554	62562	A man who has received a sign from death	1820	" Peyrol , who had seen death face to face many times , looked at Catherine 's fine brown profile curiously . "
62597	62601	62554	62562	A man who has received a sign from death	1820	" he murmured , "
62631	62632	62669	62669	they	1824	" "
62639	62651	62635	62635	anybody	1371	" asked Catherine , staring across the kitchen at the wall . "
62730	62842	62843	62843	I	0	" Peyrol folded his arms on his breast and dropped his head . Melancholy was a sentiment to which he was a stranger ; for what has melancholy to do with the life of a sea - rover , a Brother of the Coast , a simple , venturesome , precarious life , full of risks and leaving no time for introspection or for that momentary self - forgetfulness which is called gaiety . Sombre fury , fierce merriment , he had known in passing gusts , coming from outside ; but never this intimate inward sense of the vanity of all things , that doubt of the power within himself . "
62853	62939	62843	62843	I	0	" he thought ; and concluded with self - contempt that for him there would be no sign , that he would have to die in his bed like an old yard dog in his kennel . Having reached that depth of despondency , there was nothing more before him but a black gulf into which his consciousness sank like a stone . The silence which had lasted perhaps a minute after Catherine had finished speaking was traversed suddenly by a clear high voice saying : "
62947	63064	62942	62942	you	1830	" Arlette stood in the doorway of the salle . The gleam of light in the whites of her eyes set off her black and penetrating glance . The surprise was complete . The profile of Catherine , who was standing by the table , became if possible harder ; a sharp carving of an old prophetess of some desert tribe . Arlette made three steps forward . In Peyrol even extreme astonishment was deliberate . He had been famous for never looking as though he had been caught unprepared . Age had accentuated that trait of a born leader . He only slipped off the edge of the table and said in his deep voice : "
63083	63089	63090	63090	I	0	" Arlette moved nearer still . "
63093	63097	63090	63090	I	0	" she cried . "
63174	63220	63221	63221	I	0	" Her voice filled the kitchen . Peyrol went to the salle door and shut it . While coming back he was staggered by the brilliance of life within her that seemed to pale the flames of the lamp . He said half in jest : "
63237	63238	63233	63233	you	1830	" "
63253	63364	63240	63240	you	1830	" She dazzled him . Vitality streamed out of her eyes , her lips , her whole person , enveloped her like a halo and . . . yes , truly , the faintest possible flush had appeared on her cheeks , played on them faintly rosy like the light of a distant flame on the snow . She raised her arms up in the air and let her hands fall from on high on Peyrol 's shoulders , captured his desperately dodging eyes with her black and compelling glance , put out all her instinctive seduction - while he felt a growing fierceness in the grip of her fingers . "
63399	63436	63437	63437	He	128	" The rover , whom only that morning the powerful grasp of Lieutenant Ral found as unshakable as a rock , felt all his strength vanish under the hands of that woman . He said thickly : "
63448	63449	63443	63443	He	128	" "
63459	63460	63443	63443	He	128	" "
63469	63489	63443	63443	He	128	" mumbled Peyrol , with a sinking sensation as though the very ground were going soft under his feet . "
63493	63509	63443	63443	He	128	" he added in a growl . Her hands slipped suddenly from his big shoulders . "
63513	63517	63443	63443	He	128	" she repeated . "
63521	63528	63533	63533	His	128	" Her voice sank and the words "
63535	63647	63648	63648	Peyrol	136	" were hardly heard by Peyrol , who as soon as her hands had left his shoulders felt his strength returning to him and the yielding earth grow firm again under his feet . Right in front of him Arlette , silent , with her arms hanging down before her with entwined fingers , seemed stunned because Lieutenant Ral was not free from all earthly connections , like a visiting angel from heaven depending only on God to whom she had prayed . She had to share him with some service that could order him about . She felt in herself a strength , a power , greater than any service . "
63650	63655	63648	63648	Peyrol	136	" she cried low , "
63683	63700	63713	63713	patronne	1831	" She seized the rover 's thick hairy paw and pressed it hard against her breast . "
63709	63710	63713	63713	patronne	1831	" "
63721	63746	63747	63747	You	136	" began Peyrol with a great effort and snatching his captured hand away . He staggered backwards a little while Arlette shouted at him : "
63759	63808	63747	63747	You	136	" In all the changes from entreaty to anger she never struck a false note , so that her emotional outburst had the heart - moving power of inspired art . She turned round with a tempestuous swish to Catherine who had neither stirred nor emitted a sound : "
63820	63830	63831	63831	You	136	" The next moment she was facing Peyrol again . "
63859	63905	63907	63907	you	136	" The rover caught her under the elbows , swung her up clear of the ground , and set her down on her feet as if she had been a child . Directly he had let her go , she stamped her foot at him . "
63910	63914	63907	63907	you	136	" she cried . "
63927	64133	63917	63917	you	136	" Through all this scene Peyrol had kept his head as creditably as could have been expected , in the manner of a seaman caught by a white squall in the tropics . But at those words a dozen thoughts tried to rush together through his mind , in chase of that startling declaration . Something had happened ! Where ? How ? Whom to ? What thing ? It could n't be anything between her and the lieutenant . He had , it seemed to him , never lost sight of the lieutenant from the first hour when they met in the morning till he had sent him off to Toulon by an actual push on the shoulder ; except while he was having his dinner in the next room with the door open , and for the few minutes spent in talking with Michel in the yard . But that was only a very few minutes , and directly afterwards the first sight of the lieutenant sitting gloomily on the bench like a lonely crow did not suggest either elation or excitement or any emotion connected with a woman . In the face of these difficulties Peyrol 's mind became suddenly a blank . "
64138	64151	64136	64136	patronne	1831	" he began , unable to think of anything else to say . "
64169	64231	64159	64159	I	0	" He was extremely relieved to notice that she believed him . It was the truth . For indeed he did not know what he could have invented on the spur of the moment that would get her out of the way and induce her to go to bed . She treated him to a sinister frown and a terribly menacing , "
64241	64248	64250	64250	yourself	1831	" He produced an indulgent smile . "
64270	64283	64250	64250	yourself	1831	" She turned her back on him contemptuously , and said curtly , "
64289	64314	64287	64287	aunt	1845	" and went to the door leading to the passage . There she turned for a moment with her hand on the door handle . "
64334	64355	64360	64360	she	1847	" She went out . Only then did Catherine detach her gaze from the wall to meet Peyrol 's eyes . "
64374	64397	64369	64369	she	1847	" Peyrol nodded twice and there was a long pause , during which even the flames of the lamp did not stir . "
64405	64424	64402	64403	Mademoiselle Catherine	127	" he said at last with a shade of sympathy in his tone . She did not move . "
64430	64439	64402	64403	Mademoiselle Catherine	127	" he urged her deferentially as it were . "
64447	64523	64524	64524	He	1849	" Upright and deliberate , Catherine left the kitchen , and in the passage outside found Arlette waiting for her with a lighted candle in her hand . Her heart was filled with sudden desolation by the beauty of that young face enhaloed in the patch of light , with the profound darkness as of a dungeon for a background . At once her niece led the way upstairs muttering savagely through her pretty teeth : "
64535	64677	64678	64678	She	1851	" Peyrol did not take his eyes off Catherine 's straight back till the door had closed after her . Only then he relieved himself by letting the air escape through his pursed lips and rolling his eyes freely about . He picked up the lamp by the ring on the top of the central rod and went into the salle , closing behind him the door of the dark kitchen . He stood the lamp on the very table on which Lieutenant Ral had had his midday meal . A small white cloth was still spread on it and there was his chair askew as he had pushed it back when he got up . Another of the many chairs in the salle was turned round conspicuously to face the table . These things made Peyrol remark to himself bitterly : "
64702	64781	64678	64678	She	1851	" - a comparison reminiscent of certain idols he had seen in an Indian temple . Though not an iconoclast , Peyrol felt positively sick at the recollection , and hastened to step outside . The great cloud had broken up and the mighty fragments were moving to the westward in stately flight before the rising moon . Scevola , who had been lying extended full length on the bench , swung himself up suddenly , very upright . "
64790	64815	64678	64678	She	1851	" asked Peyrol , letting his eyes roam through the luminous space under the departing rearguard of the clouds jostling each other up there . "
64821	64828	64816	64816	I	0	" said the sans - culotte . "
64841	64842	64833	64833	my	0	" "
64852	64897	64847	64847	you	0	" suggested the deliberate Peyrol , whose thoughts were far away with the English ship . His mental eye contemplated her black image against the white beach of the Salins describing a sparkling curve under the moon , and meantime he went on slowly : "
64910	64987	64678	64678	She	1851	" On the level of Escampobar the shadows lay long on the ground while the side of the lookout hill remained yet black but edged with an increasing brightness . And the amenity of the stillness was such that if softened for a moment Peyrol 's hard inward attitude towards all mankind , including even the captain of the English ship . The old rover savoured a moment of serenity in the midst of his cares . "
64994	65064	64678	64678	She	1851	" declared Scevola suddenly . Peyrol , without turning his head , looked at him sideways . Though he had sprung up from his reclining posture smartly enough , the citizen had gone slack all over and was sitting all in a heap . His shoulders were hunched up , his hands reposed on his knees . With his staring eyes he resembled a sick child in the moonlight . "
65084	65117	65135	65135	citoyen	2654	" He shuddered and yawned a long irresistible nervous yawn with the gleam of unexpected long canines in a retracted , gaping mouth giving away the restless panther lurking in the man . "
65137	65138	65129	65129	You	1854	" "
65145	65152	65141	65141	I	0	" assented Peyrol with serene contempt . "
65162	65205	65158	65158	you	1854	" he added carelessly , in a social way , while enjoying the charm of a moonlit evening . Scevola , who did not expect that turn , managed , however , to produce a rattling sort of laugh almost at once . "
65234	65235	65232	65232	me	0	" "
65238	65243	65221	65221	Me	0	" said Peyrol carelessly , "
65291	65296	65289	65289	you	1854	" Scevola roused himself . "
65305	65309	65289	65289	you	1854	" he said . "
65322	65374	65318	65318	I	0	" He checked that strain . He was full of purely emotional suspicions . Peyrol was talking like this only to annoy him and to get him out of the way ; but in the particular state of his feelings Scevola was acutely aware of every syllable of these offensive remarks . "
65377	65383	65384	65384	he	0	" he thought to himself , "
65391	65619	65384	65384	he	0	" This omission seemed to the patriot of immense importance . If Peyrol had not mentioned the lieutenant it was because those two had been plotting some treachery together , all the afternoon on board that tartane . That 's why nothing had been seen of them for the best part of the day . As a matter of fact , Scevola too had observed Peyrol returning to the farm in the evening , only he had observed him from another window than Arlette . This was a few minutes before his attempt to open the lieutenant 's door , in order to find out whether Ral was in his room . He had tiptoed away , uncertain , and going into the kitchen had found only Catherine and Peyrol there . Directly Arlette joined them a sudden inspiration made him run upstairs and try the door again . It was open now ! A clear proof that it was Arlette who had been locked up in there . The discovery that she made herself at home like this in the lieutenant 's room gave Scevola such a sickening shock that he thought he would die of it . It was beyond doubt now that the lieutenant had been conspiring with Peyrol down on board that tartane ; for what else could they have been doing there ? "
65633	65658	65659	65659	he	1863	" Scevola asked himself , sitting on the bench with his hands clasped between his knees . . . . It 's their cunning , "
65663	65673	65659	65659	he	1863	" Conspirators always avoid being seen together . Ha ! "
65727	65731	65723	65723	somebody	876	" good - night "
65984	65989	65990	65990	he	136	" Conspiracy , conspiracy , "
66056	66094	66095	66095	He	136	" Have I been a slave to those two women , have I waited all those years , only to see that corrupt creature go off infamously with a ci - devant , with a conspiring aristocrat ? "
66157	66174	66146	66146	he	136	" If I had betrayed myself in the kitchen they would have murdered me in there . "
66190	66195	66196	66196	he	136	" Prudence ! Caution ! "
66225	66234	66235	66235	he	136	" They are trying to kill me now , "
66303	66310	66311	66311	he	136	" Here 's what I need , "
66315	66331	66332	66332	He	136	" I suppose that by now the lieutenant would think I am gone to bed . "
66575	66578	66571	66572	The terrorist	1230	" Michel ? "
66592	66599	66600	66600	he	150	" Hey , you , Scevola , "
66610	66641	66600	66600	he	150	" What are these tricks ? . . . Keep away , or I will heave that piece of rock at your head , and I am good at that . "
66650	66657	66658	66658	he	123	" I did n't recognize you , "
66661	66689	66658	66658	he	123	" That 's a story . Who did you think I was ? Not the other ! I have n't got a bandaged head , have I ? "
66696	66701	66702	66702	he	123	" What 's this ? "
66705	66713	66702	66702	he	123	" What head , did you say ? "
66714	66731	66733	66733	Michel	150	" I say that if you come near I will knock you over with that stone , "
66735	66774	66733	66733	Michel	150	" You are n't to be trusted when the moon is full . Not recognize ! There 's a silly excuse for flying at people like this . You have n't got anything against me , have you ? "
66775	66778	66780	66783	the ex - terrorist	1895	" No , "
66806	66821	66822	66822	Michel	150	" People have been saying for years that you are a kind of lunatic , "
66842	66870	66822	66822	Michel	150	" If a fellow can not come up now to get a snooze in the shed without being run at with a fork , well . . . "
66871	66882	66883	66883	Scevola	123	" I was only going to put this fork away , "
66888	66929	66883	66883	Scevola	123	" I had left it leaning against the wall , and as I. was passing along I suddenly saw it , so I thought I would put it in the stable before I went to bed . That 's all . "
66938	66966	66968	66968	Scevola	123	" Now what do you think I would want with a stable fork at this time of night , if it was n't to put it away ? "
66970	66974	66976	66976	Michel	150	" What indeed ! "
66988	67058	66976	66976	Michel	150	" You go about mooning like a fool and imagine a lot of silly things , you great , stupid imbecile . All I wanted to do was to ask whether everything was all right down there , and you , idiot , bound to one side like a goat and pick up a stone . The moon has affected your head , not mine . Now drop it . "
67095	67126	67086	67086	Scevola	123	" You are dangerous . You ought to have your feet and hands tied every full moon . What did you say about a head just now ? What head ? "
67127	67139	67086	67086	Scevola	123	" I said that I did n't have a broken head . "
67140	67145	67147	67147	Scevola	123	" Was that all ? "
67243	67281	67282	67282	He	123	" Now you may go into the shed . And do n't try any of your tricks with me any more , because next time you pick up a stone I will shoot you like a dog . "
67304	67356	67297	67297	his	123	" Go into the salle . Somebody has left a light in there . They all seem to have gone crazy to - day . Take the lamp into the kitchen and put it out and see that the door into the yard is shut . I am going to bed . "
67644	67650	67635	67635	Michel	150	" He 's at it ! "
67658	67665	67666	67666	he	136	" What is it you mean ? "
67669	67677	67666	67666	he	136	" He is making motions to escape . "
67693	67705	67684	67684	He	136	" Is he ? Have n't you locked the cabin door ? "
67722	67725	67727	67727	Peyrol	136	" No ? "
67730	67736	67727	67727	Peyrol	136	" I must have forgotten . "
67744	67749	67738	67738	Michel	150	" He is escaping . "
67750	67756	67758	67758	Peyrol	136	" That 's all right , "
67760	67777	67758	67758	Peyrol	136	" What are you fussing about ? How far can he escape , do you think ? "
67787	67812	67813	67813	he	150	" If he tries to scramble over the top of the rocks , he will get a broken neck in a very short time , "
67816	67831	67813	67813	he	150	" And he certainly wo n't get very far , that 's a fact . "
67832	67838	67840	67840	Peyrol	136	" Well - you see , "
67842	67902	67903	67903	he	150	" And he does n't seem strong either . He crawled out of the cabin door and got as far as the little water cask and he dipped and dipped into it . It must be half empty by now . After that he got on to his legs . I cleared out ashore directly I heard him move , "
67915	67928	67903	67903	he	150	" I hid myself behind a rock and watched him . ; ; "
67932	67950	67951	67951	He	150	" observed Peyrol . After that word of commendation , Michel 's face wore a constant grin . "
67959	67970	67972	67972	his	150	" he went on as if relating an immense joke , "
68059	68060	68071	68071	you	1912	" "
68064	68068	68071	68071	you	1912	" repeated Peyrol . "
68090	68091	68080	68080	you	1912	" "
68094	68098	68080	68080	you	1912	" said Michel . "
68136	68137	68125	68125	he	150	" "
68143	68148	68125	68125	he	150	" repeated Peyrol sharply . "
68187	68216	68178	68178	I	0	" Peyrol got down from the table with an air of concern which would have astonished Michel , if he had not been utterly incapable of observing things . "
68223	68235	68178	68178	I	0	" murmured the rover , buttoning the waistband of his trousers . "
68271	68303	68263	68263	you	1912	" This last observation was caused by Michel remaining in the doorway of the salle with his head out and looking to right and left along the front of the house . "
68328	68329	68314	68314	he	150	" "
68359	68360	68362	68362	he	150	" "
68366	68373	68362	68362	he	150	" asked Peyrol , with annoyance . "
68407	68511	68404	68404	you	1912	" Peyrol extinguished the lamp and , going out , closed the door without the slightest noise . The intelligence about Scevola being on the move did not please him very much , but he reflected that probably the sans - culotte had fallen asleep again and after waking up was on his way to bed when Michel caught sight of him . He had his own view of the patriot 's psychology and did not think the women were in any danger . Nevertheless he went to the shed and heard the rustling of straw as Michel settled himself for the night . "
68514	68519	68512	68512	Debout	188	" he cried low . "
68574	68575	68572	68572	you	188	" "
68586	68750	68579	68579	you	188	" said Michel , who , picking up his shoes , a present from Peyrol , walked barefoot towards the house . The rover watched him slipping noiselessly through the salle door . Having thus , so to speak , guarded his base , Peyrol proceeded down the ravine with a very deliberate caution . When he got as far as the little hollow in the ground from which the mastheads of the tartane could be seen , he squatted and waited . He did n't know what his prisoner had done or was doing and he did not want to blunder into the way of his escape . The day - old moon was high enough to have shortened the shadows almost to nothing and all the rocks were inundated by a yellow sheen , while the bushes by contrast looked very black . Peyrol reflected that he was not very well concealed . The continued silence impressed him in the end . "
68756	69126	68751	68751	He	1921	" he thought . Yet he was not sure . Nobody could be sure . He reckoned it was about an hour since Michel had left the tartane ; time enough for a man , even on all fours , to crawl down to the shore of the cove . Peyrol wished he had not hit so hard . His object could have been attained with half the force . On the other hand all the proceedings of his prisoner , as reported by Michel , seemed quite rational . Naturally the fellow was badly shaken . Peyrol felt as though he wanted to go on board and give him some encouragement , and even active assistance . The report of a gun from seaward cut his breath short as he lay there meditating . Within a minute there was a second report , sending another wave of deep sound among the crags and hills of the peninsula . The ensuing silence was so profound that it seemed to extend to the very inside of Peyrol 's head , and lull all his thoughts for a moment . But he had understood . He said to himself that after this his prisoner , if he had life enough left in him to stir a limb , would rather die than not try to make his way to the seashore . The ship was calling to her man . In fact those two guns had proceeded from the Amelia . After passing beyond Cape Esterel , Captain Vincent dropped an anchor under foot off the beach just as Peyrol had surmised he would do . From about six o'clock till nine the Amelia lay there with her unfurled sails hanging in the gear . Just before the moon rose the captain came up on deck and after a short conference with his first lieutenant , directed the master to get the ship under way and put her head again for the Petite Passe . Then he went below , and presently word was passed on deck that the captain wanted Mr. Bolt . When the master 's mate appeared in his cabin , Captain Vincent motioned him to a chair . "
69139	69143	69137	69137	you	1922	" he said . "
69283	69342	69346	69346	Bolt	137	" He talked for some time , giving more minute instructions , and then went on deck . The Amelia , with the two cutters towing alongside , reached about half - way down the Passe and then the boats were ordered to proceed . just before they shoved off , two guns were fired in quick succession . "
69348	69353	69346	69346	Bolt	137	" explained Captain Vincent , "
69388	70011	69373	69373	he	144	" The motive force of a fixed idea is very great . In the case of Scevola it was great enough to launch him down the slope and to rob him for the moment of all caution . He bounded amongst the boulders , using the handle of the stable fork for a staff . He paid no regard to the nature of the ground , till he got a fall and found himself sprawling on his face , while the stable fork went clattering down until it was stopped by a bush . It was this circumstance which saved Peyrol 's prisoner from being caught unawares . Since he had got out of the little cabin , simply because after coming to himself he had perceived it was open , Symons had been greatly refreshed by long drinks of cold water and by his little nap in the fresh air . Every moment he was feeling in better command of his limbs . As to the command of his thoughts , that was coming to him too rather quickly . The advantage of having a very thick skull became evident in the fact that as soon as he had dragged himself out of that cabin he knew where he was . The next thing he did was to look at the moon , to judge of the passage of time . Then he gave way to an immense surprise at the fact of being alone aboard the tartane . As he sat with his legs dangling into the open hold he tried to guess how it came about that the cabin had been left unlocked and unguarded . He went on thinking about this unexpected situation . What could have become of that white - headed villain ? Was he dodging about somewhere watching for a chance to give him another tap on the head ? Symons felt suddenly very unsafe sitting there on the after - deck in the full light of the moon . Instinct rather than reason suggested to him that he ought to get down into the dark hold . It seemed a great undertaking at first , but once he started he accomplished it with the greatest ease , though he could not avoid knocking down a small spar which was leaning up against the deck . It preceded him into the hold with a loud crash which gave poor Symons an attack of palpitation of the heart . He sat on the keelson of the tartane and gasped , but after a while reflected that all this did not matter . His head felt very big , his neck was very painful and one shoulder was certainly very stiff . He could never stand up against that old ruffian . But what had become of him ? Why ! He had gone to fetch the soldiers ! After that conclusion Symons became more composed . He began to try to remember things . When he had last seen that old fellow it was daylight , and now - Symons looked up at the moon again - it must be near six bells in the first watch . No doubt the old scoundrel was sitting in a wine shop drinking with the soldiers . They would be here soon enough ! The idea of being a prisoner of war made his heart sink a little . His ship appeared to him invested with an extraordinary number of lovable features which included Captain Vincent and the first lieutenant . He would have been glad to shake hands even with the corporal , a surly and malicious marine acting as master - at - arms of the ship . "
70019	70258	70012	70012	I	0	" he thought dismally , feeling his distaste for captivity grow with the increase of his strength . It was at this moment that he heard the noise of Scevola 's fall . It was pretty close ; but afterwards he heard no voices and footsteps heralding the approach of a body of men . If this was the old ruffian coming back , then he was coming back alone . At once Symons started on all fours for the fore - end of the tartane . He had an idea that ensconced under the fore - deck he would be in a better position to parley with the enemy and that perhaps he could find there a handspike or some piece of iron to defend himself with . just as he had settled himself in his hiding - place Scevola stepped from the shore on to the after - deck . At the very first glance Symons perceived that this one was very unlike the man he expected to see . He felt rather disappointed . As Scevola stood still in full moonlight Symons congratulated himself on having taken up a position under the fore - deck . That fellow , who had a beard , was like a sparrow in body compared with the other ; but he was armed dangerously with something that looked to Symons like either a trident or fishgrains on a staff . "
70266	70334	70335	70335	He	1934	" he thought , appalled . And what on earth did that beggar want on board ? What could he be after ? The new - comer acted strangely at first . He stood stock - still , craning his neck here and there , peering along the whole length of the tartane , then crossing the deck he repeated all those performances on the other side . "
70366	70372	70356	70356	He	1934	" said Symons to himself . "
70388	70421	70422	70422	He	1934	" For a moment he debated within himself whether it would n't be better to make a dash for it and scramble ashore ; but in the end he mistrusted his strength . "
70430	70434	70422	70422	He	1934	" he concluded . "
70468	70505	70459	70459	he	1934	" Scevola , after keeping perfectly still , straining his ears for any sound from below where he supposed Lieutenant Ral to be , stooped down to the cabin scuttle and called in a low voice : "
70512	70625	70626	70626	He	1939	" Symons saw these motions and could not imagine their purport . That excellent able seaman of proved courage in many cutting - out expeditions broke into a slight perspiration . In the light of the moon the prongs of the fork polished by much use shone like silver , and the whole aspect of the stranger was weird and dangerous in the extreme . Whom could that man be after but him , himself ? Scevola , receiving no answer , remained in a stooping position . He could not detect the slightest sound of breathing down there . He remained in this position so long that Symons became quite interested . "
70635	70737	70629	70629	I	0	" he whispered to himself . The next proceeding was quite astonishing . The man , taking up a position on one side of the cuddy scuttle and holding his horrid weapon as one would a boarding pike , uttered a terrific whoop and went on yelling in French with such volubility that he quite frightened Symons . Suddenly he left off , moved away from the scuttle and looked at a loss what to do next . Anybody who could have seen then Symons protruded head with his face turned aft would have seen on it an expression of horror , "
70742	70746	70629	70629	I	0	" he thought . "
70774	70825	70768	70768	he	1939	" Symons experienced the feeling of a very narrow escape ; yet it brought not much relief . It was simply a matter of time . The fellow 's homicidal purpose was evident . He was bound before long to come forward . Symons saw him move , and thought , "
70831	70839	70827	70827	he	1939	" and prepared himself for a dash . "
70859	71046	70848	70848	I	0	" he reflected , without , however , feeling much confidence in himself . But to his great relief Scevola 's purpose was simply to conceal the fork in the hold in such a manner that the handle of it just reached the edge of the after - deck . In that position it was of course invisible to anybody coming from the shore . Scevola had made up his mind that the lieutenant was out of the tartane . He had wandered away along the shore and would probably be back in a moment . Meantime it had occurred to him to see if he could discover anything compromising in the cabin . He did not take the fork down with him because in that confined space it would have been useless and rather a source of embarrassment than otherwise , should the returning lieutenant find him there . He cast a circular glance around the basin and then prepared to go down . Every movement of his was watched by Symons . He guessed Scevola 's purpose by his movements and said to himself : "
71062	71393	70848	70848	I	0	" Directly Scevola turned his back on the forepart of the tartane in order to go down the little cabin ladder , Symons crawled out from his concealment . He ran along the hold on all fours for fear the other should turn his head round before disappearing below , but directly he judged that the man had touched bottom , he stood on his feet and catching hold of the main rigging swung himself on the after - deck and , as it were in the same movement , flung himself on the doors of the cabin which came together with a crash . How he could secure them he had not thought , but as a matter of fact he saw the padlock hanging on a staple on one side ; the key was in it , and it was a matter of a fraction of a second to secure the doors effectually . Almost simultaneously with the crash of the cabin door there was a shrill exclamation of surprise down there , and just as Symons had turned the key the man he had trapped made an effort to break out . That , however , did not disturb Symons . He knew the strength of that door . His first action was to get possession of the stable fork . At once he felt himself a match for any single man or even two men unless they had fire - arms . He had no hope , however , of being able to resist the soldiers and really had no intention of doing so . He expected to see them appear at any moment led by that confounded marinero . As to what the farmer man had come for on board the tartane he had not the slightest doubt about it . Not being troubled by too much imagination , it seemed to him obvious that it was to kill an Englishman and for nothing else . "
71400	71405	71396	71396	I	0	" he exclaimed mentally . "
71426	71488	71418	71418	They	1942	" He looked anxiously up the slope . He would have welcomed the arrival of soldiers . He wanted more than ever to be made a proper prisoner , but a profound stillness reigned on the shore and a most absolute silence down below in the cabin . Absolute . No word , no movement . The silence of the grave . "
71495	71508	71489	71489	He	1941	" thought Symons , hitting in his simplicity on the exact truth . "
71539	72171	71529	71529	I	0	" He was getting angry . It occurred to him also that there was some wine down there too . He discovered he was very thirsty and he felt rather faint . He sat down on the little skylight to think the matter over while awaiting the soldiers . He even gave a friendly thought to Peyrol himself . He was quite aware that he could have gone ashore and hidden himself for a time , but that meant in the end being hunted among the rocks and , certainly , captured ; with the additional risk of getting a musket ball through his body . The first gun of the Amelia lifted him to his feet as though he had been snatched up by the hair of his head . He intended to give a resounding cheer , but produced only a feeble gurgle in his throat . His ship was talking to him . They had n't given him up . At the second report he scrambled ashore with the agility of a cat - in fact , with so much agility that he had a fit of giddiness . After it passed off he returned deliberately to the tartane to get hold of the stable fork . Then trembling with emotion , he staggered off quietly and resolutely with the only purpose of getting down to the seashore . He knew that as long as he kept downhill he would be all right . The ground in this part being a smooth rocky surface and Symons being barefooted , he passed at no great distance from Peyrol without being heard . When he got on rough ground he used the stable fork for a staff . Slowly as he moved he was not really strong enough to be sure - footed . Ten minutes later or so Peyrol , lying ensconced behind a bush , beard the noise of a rolling stone far away in the direction of the cove . Instantly the patient Peyrol got on his feet and started towards the cove himself . Perhaps he would have smiled if the importance and gravity of the affair in which he was engaged had not given all his thoughts a serious cast . Pursuing a higher path than the one followed by Symons , he had presently the satisfaction of seeing the fugitive , made very noticeable by the white bandages about his head , engaged in the last part of the steep descent . No nurse could have watched with more anxiety the adventure of a little boy than Peyrol the progress of his former prisoner . He was very glad to perceive that he had had the sense to take what looked like the tartane 's boathook to help himself with . As Symons ' figure sank lower and lower in his descent Peyrol moved on , step by step , till at last he saw him from above sitting down on the seashore , looking very forlorn and lonely , with his bandaged head between his hands . Instantly Peyrol sat down too , protected by a projecting rock . And it is safe to say that with that there came a complete cessation of all sound and movement on the lonely head of the peninsula for a full half hour . Peyrol was not in doubt as to what was going to happen . He was as certain that the corvette 's boat or boats were now on the way to the cove as though he had seen them leave the side of the Amelia . But he began to get a little impatient . He wanted to see the end of this episode . Most of the time he was watching Symons . "
72176	72180	72181	72181	He	1943	" he thought . "
72187	72365	72181	72181	He	1943	" Indeed Symons immobility was so complete that he might have been dead from his exertions : only Peyrol had a conviction that his once youthful chum was not the sort of person that dies easily . The part of the cove he had reached was all right for Peyrol 's purpose . But it would have been quite easy for a boat or boats to fail to notice Symons , and the consequence of that would be that the English would probably land in several parties for a search , discover the tartane . Peyrol shuddered . Suddenly he made out a boat just clear of the eastern point of the cove . Mr. Bolt had been hugging the coast and progressing very slowly , according to his instructions , till he had reached the edge of the point 's shadow where it lay ragged and black on the moonlit water . Peyrol could see the oars rise and fall . Then another boat glided into view . Peyrol 's alarm for his tartane grew intolerable . "
72374	72410	72369	72369	animal	1944	" he mumbled through his teeth . Slowly they glided on , and the first cutter was on the point of passing by the man on the shore when Peyrol was relieved by the hail of "
72413	72564	72369	72369	animal	1944	" reaching him faintly where he knelt leaning forward , an absorbed spectator . He saw the boat heading for Symons , who was standing up now and making desperate signs with both arms . Then he saw him dragged in over the bows , the boat back out , and then both of them tossed oars and floated side by side on the sparkling water of the cove . Peyrol got up from his knees . They had their man now . But perhaps they would persist in landing since there must have been some other purpose at first in the mind of the captain of the English corvette . This suspense did not last long . Peyrol saw the oars fall in the water , and in a very few minutes the boats , pulling round , disappeared one after another behind the eastern point of the cove . "
72569	72575	72576	72576	I	0	" muttered Peyrol to himself . "
72587	72741	72576	72576	I	0	" He had a strange notion that those English boats had carried off something belonging to him , not a man but a part of his own life , the sensation of a regained touch with the far - off days in the Indian Ocean . He walked down quickly as if to examine the spot from which Testa Dura had left the soil of France . He was in a hurry now to get back to the farmhouse and meet Lieutenant Ral , who would be due back from Toulon . The way by the cove was as short as any other . When he got down he surveyed the empty shore and wondered at a feeling of emptiness within himself . While walking up towards the foot of the ravine he saw an object lying on the ground . It was a stable fork . He stood over it asking himself , "
72751	72815	72817	72817	he	1945	" as though he had been too surprised to pick it up . Even after he had done so he remained motionless , meditating on it . He connected it with some activity of Scevola , since he was the man to whom it belonged , but that was no sort of explanation of its presence on that spot , unless . . . "
72822	72981	72982	72982	You	1946	" thought Peyrol , looking at the smooth and luminous water of the cove . It could give him no answer . Then at arm 's length he contemplated his find . At last he shook his head , shouldered the fork , and with slow steps continued on his way . The midnight meeting of Lieutenant Ral and Peyrol was perfectly silent . Peyrol , sitting on the bench outside the salle , had heard the footsteps coming up the Madrague track long before the lieutenant became visible . But he did not move . He did not even look at him . The lieutenant , unbuckling his sword - belt , sat down without uttering a word . The moon , the only witness of the meeting , seemed to shine on two friends so identical in thought and feeling that they could commune with each other without words . It was Peyrol who spoke first . "
72988	72989	72982	72982	You	1946	" "
73086	73087	73080	73080	I	0	" "
73101	73135	73092	73092	you	1946	" growled Peyrol perfunctorily . He had thrown the incomprehensible stable fork under the narrow bench , and with his feet drawn in he could feel it there , lying against the wall . "
73151	73214	73215	73215	I	0	" Ral drew a folded paper from his pocket and dropped it on the bench . Peyrol picked it up carelessly . That thing was meant only to throw dust into Englishmen 's eyes . The lieutenant , after a moment 's silence , went on with the sincerity of a man who suffered too much to keep his trouble to himself . "
73221	73222	73215	73215	I	0	" "
73228	73235	73236	73236	You	1946	" said Peyrol , very positively . "
73259	73260	73252	73252	you	1946	" "
73275	73334	73268	73268	I	0	" A ferocious , not unpleasing thought flashed through Peyrol 's mind . It was that this intruder on the Escampobar sinister solitude in which he , Peyrol , kept order was under a delusion . Mind ! Pah ! His mind had nothing to do with his return . He had returned because in Catherine 's words , "
73343	73357	73268	73268	I	0	" Meantime , Lieutenant Ral raised his hat to wipe his moist brow . "
73429	73556	73564	73564	he	1485	" Peyrol did not answer . He was thinking that Ral had got his sign , but whether it meant death from starvation or disease on board an English prison hulk , or in some other way , it was impossible to say . This naval officer was not a man he could trust ; to whom he could , for instance , tell the story of his prisoner and what he had done with him . Indeed , the story was altogether incredible . The Englishman commanding that corvette had no visible , conceivable or probable reason for sending a boat ashore to the cove of all places in the world . Peyrol himself could hardly believe that it had happened . And he thought : "
73611	73612	73613	73613	I	0	" "
73616	73626	73613	73613	I	0	" he burst out , but not very loud , "
73639	73660	73663	73663	Peyrol	136	" Ral leaned his back against the wall and folded his arms in the familiar attitude of their leisurely talks . "
73665	73675	73663	73663	Peyrol	136	" he said in a far - away tone . "
73679	73701	73663	73663	Peyrol	136	" Peyrol also , as if unable to resist the force of example , assumed the same attitude , and said : "
73713	73714	73702	73702	You	136	" "
73728	73729	73723	73726	that sort of man	1960	" "
73746	73769	73717	73717	Peyrol	136	" Lieutenant Ral leaned the back of his head against the wall and made no answer . Peyrol got on his legs . "
73806	73807	73795	73795	I	0	" "
73816	73960	73810	73810	I	0	" Peyrol laughed quite loud , tilting his head back . All at once the laugh stopped short and the lieutenant was amazed to see him reel as though he had been hit in the chest . While giving way to his bitter mirth , the rover had caught sight of Arlette 's face at the , open window of the lieutenant 's room . He sat heavily on the bench and was unable to make a sound . The lieutenant was startled enough to detach the back of his head from the wall to look at him . Peyrol stooped low suddenly , and began to drag the stable fork from its concealment . Then he got on his feet and stood leaning on it , glaring down at Ral , who gazed upwards with languid surprise . Peyrol was asking himself , "
73982	74057	73962	73962	I	0	" He felt suddenly overcome by a heaviness of arms and a heaviness of heart that made all movement impossible . His stiffened and powerless limbs refused all service . . . . Let Catherine look after her niece . He was sure that the old woman was not very far away . The lieutenant saw him absorbed in examining the points of the prongs carefully . There was something queer about all this . "
74067	74074	74075	74075	I	0	" he could n't help asking . "
74080	74084	74075	74075	I	0	" said Peyrol . "
74102	74111	74092	74092	I	0	" The lieutenant still gazed at him curiously . "
74121	74122	74141	74141	Scevola	189	" "
74125	74137	74141	74141	Scevola	189	" said Peyrol , who had recovered some self - control . "
74143	74144	74141	74141	Scevola	189	" "
74148	74168	74141	74141	Scevola	189	" said the lieutenant , falling back again . His interest seemed exhausted , but Peyrol did n't move . "
74180	74189	74169	74169	You	136	" he remarked suddenly in a deep voice . "
74229	74241	74221	74221	you	136	" Lieutenant Ral got up as if moved by a spring . "
74244	74252	74221	74221	you	136	" he repeated , standing very stiff : "
74275	74359	74360	74360	I	0	" He walked forward with a tense still face straight at Peyrol as though he had been blind . Startled , the rover stepped out of the way and , turning on his heels , followed him with his eyes . The lieutenant paced on , as if drawn by a magnet , in the direction of the door of the house . Peyrol , his eyes fastened on Ral 's back , let him nearly reach it before he called out tentatively : "
74365	74380	74360	74360	I	0	" To his extreme surprise , Ral swung round as if to a touch . "
74385	74394	74360	74360	I	0	" he answered , also in an undertone . "
74406	74424	74395	74395	We	1970	" Peyrol , who had approached him close , said in a whisper which sounded quite fierce : "
74453	74477	74440	74440	I	0	" Lieutenant Ral nodded . The expression on his face was so stony that Peyrol doubted whether he had understood . He added : "
74488	74501	74524	74524	you	888	" The lieutenant was about to open the door when Peyrol said : "
74505	74514	74524	74524	you	888	" and again the lieutenant turned about silently . "
74588	74676	74576	74576	you	888	" Lieutenant Ral 's eyes staring over his shoulder , seemed glazed and motionless in the moonlight like the eyes of a dead man . But he went in . Peyrol heard presently sounds within of somebody staggering in the passage and Michel projected himself outside headlong , but after a stumble or two pulled up , scratching his head and looking on every side in the moonlight without perceiving Peyrol , who was regarding him from a distance of five feet . At last Peyrol said : "
74686	74687	74684	74684	Michel	150	" "
74693	74694	74684	74684	Michel	150	" "
74703	74707	74698	74698	I	0	" said Peyrol . "
74715	74731	74698	74698	I	0	" Michel did n't offer to touch the stable fork extended to him by Peyrol . "
74739	74743	74698	74698	I	0	" asked Peyrol . "
74762	74770	74758	74758	Scevola	189	" He glanced up at the sky . "
74779	74780	74758	74758	Scevola	189	" "
74786	74787	74783	74783	he	150	" "
74797	74798	74783	74783	he	150	" "
74812	74816	74802	74802	you	0	" said Peyrol , "
74825	74850	74851	74851	He	150	" He waited with his hand over his chin till his henchman reappeared before him . But Michel had not got over his surprise . "
74860	74864	74851	74851	He	150	" he said . "
74895	74896	74888	74888	He	150	" "
74908	74943	74903	74903	He	150	" said Michel , very awake and round - eyed . Peyrol started towards the cove . After three or four steps he turned round and found Michel motionless where he had left him . "
74947	74951	74903	74903	He	150	" he cried , "
74966	75708	74903	74903	He	150	" Standing in the lieutenant 's room just clear of the open window , Arlette listened to their voices and to the sound of their footsteps diminishing down the slope . Before they had quite died out she became aware of a light tread approaching the door of the room . Lieutenant Ral had spoken the truth . While in Toulon he had more than once said to himself that he could never go back to that fatal farmhouse . His mental state was quite pitiable . Honour , decency , every principle forbade him to trifle with the feelings of a poor creature with her mind darkened by a very terrifying , atrocious and , as it were , guilty experience . And suddenly he had given way to a base impulse and had betrayed himself by kissing her hand ! He recognized with despair that this was no trifling , but that the impulse had come from the very depths of his being . It was an awful discovery for a man who on emerging from boyhood had laid for himself a rigidly straight line of conduct amongst the unbridled passions and the clamouring falsehoods of revolution which seemed to have destroyed in him all capacity for the softer emotions . Taciturn and guarded , he had formed no intimacies . Relations he had none . He had kept clear of social connections . It was in his character . At first he visited Escampobar because when he took his leave he had no place in the world to go to , and a few days there were a complete change from the odious town . He enjoyed the sense of remoteness from ordinary mankind . He had developed a liking for old Peyrol , the only man who had nothing to do with the revolution - who had not even seen it at work . The sincere lawlessness of the ex - Brother of the Coast was refreshing . That one was neither a hypocrite nor a fool . When he robbed or killed it was not in the name of the sacred revolutionary principles or for the love of humanity . Of course Ral had remarked at once Arlette 's black , profound and unquiet eyes and the persistent dim smile on her lips , her mysterious silences and the rare sound of her voice which made a caress of every word . He heard something of her story from the reluctant Peyrol who did not care to talk about it . It awakened in Ral more bitter indignation than pity . But it stimulated his imagination , confirmed him in that scorn and angry loathing for the revolution he had felt as a boy and had nursed secretly ever since . She attracted him by her unapproachable aspect . Later he tried not to notice that , in common parlance , she was inclined to hang about him . He used to catch her gazing at him stealthily . But he was free from masculine vanity . It was one day in Toulon that it suddenly dawned on him what her mute interest in his person might mean . He was then sitting outside a caf sipping some drink or other with three or four officers , and not listening to their uninteresting conversation . He marvelled that this sort of illumination should come to him like this , under these circumstances ; that he should have thought of her while seated in the street with these men round him , in the midst of more or less professional talk ! And then it suddenly dawned on him that he had been thinking of nothing but that woman for days . He got up brusquely , flung the money for his drink on the table , and without a word left his companions . But he had the reputation of an eccentric man and they did not even comment on his abrupt departure . It was a clear evening . He walked straight out of town , and that night wandered beyond the fortifications , not noticing the direction he took . All the countryside was asleep . There was not a human being stirring , and his progress in that desolate part of the country between the forts could have been traced only by the barking of dogs in the rare hamlets and scattered habitations . "
75729	75735	75736	75736	I	0	" he asked himself pedantically . "
75760	75827	75736	75736	I	0	" His despair at this awful discovery was so profound that if he had not been in uniform he would have tried to commit suicide with the small pistol he had in his pocket . He shrank from the act , and the thought of the sensation it would produce , from the gossip and comments it would raise , the dishonouring suspicions it would provoke . "
75830	75836	75736	75736	I	0	" he said to himself , "
75929	76182	76183	76183	I	0	" On that resolution he turned back abruptly and at daybreak found himself outside the gate of the town . He had to wait till it was opened , and then the morning was so far advanced that he had to go straight to work at his office at the Toulon Admiralty . Nobody noticed anything peculiar about him that day . He went through his routine tasks with outward composure , but all the same he never ceased arguing with himself . By the time he returned to his quarters he had come to the conclusion that as an officer in war - time he had no right to take his own life . His principles would not permit him to do that . In this reasoning he was perfectly sincere . During a deadly struggle against an irreconcilable enemy his life belonged to his country . But there were moments when his loneliness , haunted by the forbidden vision of Escampobar with the figure of that distracted girl , mysterious , awful , pale , irresistible in her strangeness , passing along the walls , appearing on the hill - paths , looking out of the window , became unbearable . He spent hours of solitary anguish shut up in his quarters , and the opinion amongst his comrades was that Ral 's misanthropy was getting beyond all bounds . One day it dawned upon him clearly that he could not stand this . It affected his power of thinking . "
76192	76198	76183	76183	I	0	" he said to himself . "
76262	76656	76657	76657	I	0	" And he went on a visit to Escampobar at the very first opportunity . He made up for himself a repellent face , he clung to Peyrol for society , out there on the bench , both with their arms folded and gazing into space . But whenever Arlette crossed his line of sight it was as if something had moved in his breast . Yet these visits made life just bearable ; they enabled him to attend to his work without beginning to talk nonsense to people . He said to himself that he was strong enough to rise above temptation , that he would never overstep the line ; but it had happened to him upstairs in his room at the farm , to weep tears of sheer tenderness while thinking of his fate . These tears would put out for a while the gnawing fire of his passion . He assumed austerity like an armour and in his prudence he , as a matter of fact , looked very seldom at Arlette for fear of being caught in the act . The discovery that she had taken to wandering at night had upset him all the same , because that sort of thing was unaccountable . It gave him a shock which unsettled , not his resolution , but his fortitude . That morning he had allowed himself , while she was waiting on him , to be caught looking at her and then , losing his self - control , had given her that kiss on the hand . Directly he had done it he was appalled . He had overstepped the line . Under the circumstances this was an absolute moral disaster . The full consciousness of it came to him slowly . In fact this moment of fatal weakness was one of the reasons why he had let himself be sent off so unceremoniously by Peyrol to Toulon . Even while crossing over he thought the only thing was not to come back any more . Yet while battling with himself he went on with the execution of the plan . A bitter irony presided over his dual state . Before leaving the Admiral who had received him in full uniform in a room lighted by a single candle , he was suddenly moved to say : "
76672	76679	76680	76680	I	0	" and the Admiral had answered : "
76751	76771	77078	77078	her	1995	" At the foot of the grand staircase in the lighted hall of the official building Ral suddenly thought : "
76781	76852	76774	76774	I	0	" Indeed he had to go to Escampobar because the false dispatches were there in the valise he had left behind . He could n't go back to the Admiral and explain that he had lost them . They would look on him as an unutterable idiot or a man gone mad . While walking to the quay where the naval boat was waiting for him he said to himself . "
76869	77042	76774	76774	I	0	" Going back in the boat , notwithstanding that the breeze was very light , he would not let the men take to the oars . He did n't want to return before the women had gone to bed . He said to himself that the proper and honest thing to do was not to see Arlette again . He even managed to persuade himself that his uncontrolled impulse had had no meaning for that witless and unhappy creature . She had neither started nor exclaimed ; she had made no sign . She had remained passive and then she had backed away and sat down quietly . He could not even remember that she had coloured at all . As to himself , he had enough self - control to rise from the table and go out without looking at her again . Neither did she make a sign . What could startle that body without mind ? She had made nothing of it , he thought with self - contempt . "
77051	77068	76774	76774	I	0	" he repeated with angry derision directed at himself . And all at once he thought : "
77097	77113	77091	77091	I	0	" This thought wrung from him a faint groan so that the coxswain asked respectfully : "
77121	77122	77115	77115	you	0	" "
77127	77153	77115	77115	you	0	" he muttered and set his teeth with the desperation of a man under torture . While talking with Peyrol outside the house , the words "
77161	77163	77158	77158	her	1995	" and "
77167	77253	77091	77091	I	0	" rang through his head . By the time he had left Peyrol and walked up the stairs his endurance was absolutely at an end . All he wanted was to be alone . Going along the dark , passage he noticed that the door of Catherine 's room was standing ajar . But that did not arrest his attention . He was approaching a state of insensibility . As he put his hand on the door handle of his room he said to himself . "
77260	77418	77434	77434	Scevola	189	" He was so tired out that he was almost unable to hold up his head , and on going in he did n't see Arlette , who stood against the wall on one side of the window , out of the moonlight and in the darkest corner of the room . He only became aware of somebody 's presence in the room as she flitted past him with the faintest possible rustle , when he staggered back two paces and heard behind him the key being turned in the lock . If the whole house had fallen into ruins , bringing him to the ground , lie could not have been more overwhelmed and , in a manner , more utterly bereft of all his senses . The first that came back to him was the sense of touch when Arlette seized his hand . He regained his hearing next . She was whispering to him : "
77455	77488	77451	77451	him	189	" He felt a significant pressure on his hand , but he could n't see her properly yet , though he was aware of her nearness with every fibre of his body . "
77495	77506	77451	77451	him	189	" she added in a low tone . Then suddenly : "
77519	77590	77451	77451	him	189	" A great square of moonlight lay on the floor . He obeyed the tug like a little child . She caught hold of his other hand as it hung by his side . He was rigid all over , without joints , and it did not seem to him that he was breathing . With her face a little below his she stared at him closely , whispering gently : "
77595	77607	77593	77593	Eugne	174	" and suddenly the livid immobility of his face frightened her . "
77625	77885	77886	77886	She	1999	" She let go his insensitive hands and began to feel him all over for evidence of some injury . She even snatched off his hat and flung it away in her haste to discover that his head was unharmed ; but finding no sign of bodily damage , she calmed down like a sensible , practical person . With her hands clasped round his neck she hung back a little . Her little even teeth gleamed , her black eyes , immensely profound , looked into his , not with a transport of passion or fear but with a sort of reposeful satisfaction , with a searching and appropriating expression . He came back to life with a low and reckless exclamation , felt horribly insecure at once as if he were standing on a lofty pinnacle above a noise as of breaking waves in his cars , in fear lest her fingers should part and she would fall off and be lost to him for ever . He flung his arms round her waist and hugged her close to his breast . In the great silence , in the bright moonlight falling through the window , they stood like that for a long , long time . He looked at her head resting on his shoulder . Her eyes were closed and the expression of her unsmiling face was that of a delightful dream , something infinitely ethereal , peaceful and , as it were , eternal . Its appeal pierced his heart with a pointed sweetness . "
77895	77904	77886	77886	She	1999	" he thought with a snort of terror . "
77909	77980	77886	77886	She	1999	" She made a movement to disengage herself , and instinctively he resisted , pressing her closer to his breast . She yielded for a moment and then tried again . He let her go . She stood at arm 's length , her hands on his shoulders , and her charm struck him suddenly as funny in the seriousness of expression as of a very capable , practical woman . "
77987	77995	77996	77996	We	2000	" she said in a businesslike undertone . "
78017	78026	78008	78008	I	0	" she added , feeling his slight start . "
78034	78056	78027	78027	Scevola	189	" She detached one hand to point a finger at the inner wall of the room , and lowered her voice . "
78090	78095	78096	78096	He	189	" Her murmur vibrated . "
78134	78149	78124	78124	he	189	" She felt Ral sway under her hands , paused in concern and said : "
78154	78205	78150	78150	You	189	" But as he did n't move , she actually led him to a chair , pushed him into it , and sat on the floor at his feet . She rested her head against his knees and kept possession of one of his hands . A sigh escaped her . "
78214	78220	78206	78206	I	0	" she said very low . "
78228	78229	78222	78222	I	0	" "
78240	78245	78232	78232	you	0	" he repeated faintly . "
78263	78272	78255	78255	you	189	" she asked , lingering on his name . "
78280	78288	78255	78255	you	189	" answered Ral in a sombre tone . "
78311	78349	78301	78301	I	0	" Ral could hardly believe his ears . . . . The abb let me in by the sacristy door . He told me to renounce the world . I was ready to renounce anything for you . "
78406	78430	78431	78431	She	2007	" So you knew that it was going to be ? Everything ? Yes ! And of me , what did you think ? "
78446	78451	78431	78431	She	2007	" I thought this . "
78452	78485	78486	78486	he	136	" But what did you think of my conduct at times ? You see , I did not know what was going to be . I . . . I was afraid , "
78492	78545	78486	78486	he	136	" Conduct ? What conduct ? You came , you went . When you were not here I thought of you , and when you were here I could look my fill at you . I tell you I knew how it was going to be . I was not afraid then . "
78546	78555	78556	78556	he	136	" You went about with a little smile , "
78567	78574	78576	78576	Arlette	121	" I was warm and quiet , "
78617	78622	78590	78590	her	121	" You were perfect , "
78627	78637	78590	78590	her	121	" Whenever you came near me everything seemed different . "
78638	78647	78590	78590	her	121	" What do you mean ? How different ? "
78648	78676	78677	78677	Nanette	191	" Altogether . The light , the very stones of the house , the hills , the little flowers amongst the rocks ! Even Nanette was different . "
78696	78704	78706	78706	Ral	136	" Oh , Nanette was different too , "
78757	78816	78817	78818	What people	2010	" Yes . Prettier . It 's only the people . . . . She ceased on an uncertain note . The crested wave of enchantment seemed to have passed over his head ebbing out faster than the sea , leaving the dreary expanses of the sand . He felt a chill at the roots of his hair . "
78820	78824	78825	78825	They	2010	" he asked . "
78868	78952	78864	78864	he	136	" He was struck by the tone of awe , by its profound conviction . He could not know that Peyrol , unforeseen , unexpected , inexplicable , had given by his mere appearance at Escampobar a moral and even a physical jolt to all her being , that he was to her an immense figure , like a messenger from the unknown entering the solitude of Escampobar ; something immensely strong , with inexhaustible power , unaffected by familiarity and remaining invincible . "
78971	78972	78974	78974	he	136	" "
78976	79008	78974	78974	he	136	" muttered Ral . She sat up on the floor , moved her head up and down several times as if to say that there could be no doubt about that . "
79019	79024	79010	79010	he	136	" asked Ral bitterly . "
79202	79203	79196	79196	he	136	" "
79204	79210	79212	79212	Ral	136	" And when I came ? "
79219	79226	79227	79227	she	2020	" You ! You were expected , "
79252	79312	79227	79227	she	2020	" Yes , I caught them at it last evening , he and Catherine in the kitchen , looking at each other and as quiet as mice . I told him he could n't order me about . Oh , mon chri , mon chri , do n't you listen to Peyrol - do n't let him . . . "
79332	79340	79341	79341	he	136	" He can do nothing to me , "
79381	79494	79376	79376	he	136	" She put an accent into those words which made Ral feel moved almost to tears . He repeated that Peyrol could have no influence over him , and he felt that he was speaking the truth . He was in the power of his own word . Ever since he had left the Admiral in a gold - embroidered uniform , impatient to return to his guests , he was on a service for which he had volunteered . For a moment he had the sensation of an iron hoop very tight round his chest . She peered at his face closely , and it was more than he could bear . "
79503	79507	79498	79498	I	0	" he said . "
79516	79549	79512	79512	she	127	" In the sheen of the moonlight Arlette , her neck and head above the gleams of the fichu , visible and elusive , smiled at him and moved a step closer . "
79554	79561	79550	79552	Poor Aunt Catherine	127	" she said . . . . "
79652	79653	79643	79643	Eugne	174	" "
79661	79677	79643	79643	Eugne	174	" said Ral in a tone which he tried to make as light as possible . "
79685	79686	79679	79679	Catherine	127	" "
79828	79920	79921	79921	She	2027	" She stopped her murmur suddenly and lifted a finger recommending silence . She listened and Ral listened too , he did not know for what ; and in this sudden concentration on a point , all that had happened since he had entered the room seemed to him a dream in its improbability and in the more than life - like force dreams have in their inconsequence . Even the woman letting herself go on his arm seemed to have no weight as it might have happened in a dream . "
79925	79940	79921	79921	She	2027	" breathed Arlette suddenly , rising on tiptoe to reach up to his ear . "
79949	79950	79941	79941	She	2027	" "
79955	79964	79953	79953	she	2027	" asked Ral with the same intense secrecy . "
79984	79996	79969	79969	She	2027	" Arlette breathed into his ear as if relating an enormity . "
80017	80087	79997	79997	She	2027	" At this he flung his other arm round her and looked into her enlarged as if frightened eyes , while she clasped him with all her strength and they stood like that a long time , lips pressed on lips without a kiss , and breathless in the closeness of their contact . To him the stillness seemed to extend to the limits of the universe . The thought "
80094	80137	80138	80138	Arlette	121	" flashed through that stillness and lost itself in it like a spark flying in an everlasting night . The only result of it was the tightening of his hold on Arlette . An aged and uncertain voice was heard uttering the word "
80140	80188	80138	80138	Arlette	121	" Catherine , who had been listening to their murmurs , could not bear the long silence . They heard her trembling tones as distinctly as though she had been in the room . Ral felt as if it had saved his life . They separated silently . "
80192	80197	80198	80198	Arl	192	" called out Arlette . "
80204	80205	80198	80198	Arl	192	" "
80209	80214	80215	80215	You	192	" she cried louder . "
80220	80221	80222	80222	Arlette	121	" "
80224	80234	80222	80222	Arlette	121	" came through the door , tremulous and commanding . "
80241	80270	80235	80235	She	2030	" remarked Arlette to Ral in a conversational tone . And they both waited for sounds that did not come . Arlette pointed her finger at the wall . "
80278	80279	80280	80280	He	189	" "
80284	80291	80280	80280	He	189	" muttered Ral . But the thought "
80295	80308	80309	80309	He	189	" which he formulated in his mind had no reference to Scevola . "
80313	80321	80309	80309	He	189	" said Arlette contemptuously in an undertone . "
80343	80375	80327	80327	He	189	" Slowly , as if drawn by the irresistible authority of the old woman , they had been moving towards the door . Ral thought with the sudden enlightenment of passion : "
80396	80447	80448	80448	You	2032	" He had no image of death before his eyes but of a long and intolerable separation . A sigh verging upon a moan reached them from the other side of the door and made the air around them heavy with sorrow against which locks and keys will not avail . "
80455	80463	80448	80448	You	2032	" he whispered in a penetrating tone . "
80469	80476	80477	80479	Poor old thing	2033	" said Arlette with some feeling . "
80507	80529	80503	80503	I	0	" With one of her hands on Ral 's shoulder she put her mouth close to the door and said distinctly : "
80545	80585	80538	80538	your	2036	" as if she had no doubt of being obeyed . A profound silence ensued . Perhaps Catherine had gone already . Ral and Arlette stood still for a whole minute as if both had been changed into stone . "
80589	80623	80538	80538	your	2036	" said Ral in a hoarse , hardly audible voice . She gave him a quick kiss on the lips and again they stood like a pair of enchanted lovers bewitched into immobility . "
80629	80633	80625	80625	she	2031	" thought Ral , "
80656	80698	80647	80647	I	0	" But when at last she moved he seized her again and held her as if she had been his very life . When he let her go he was appalled by hearing a very faint laugh of her secret joy . "
80704	80721	80701	80701	you	2031	" he asked in a scared tone . She stopped to answer him over her shoulder . "
80746	80747	80741	80741	you	2031	" "
80750	80881	80741	80741	you	2031	" Ral faltered , like a man stabbed to the heart , holding the door half open . And he was glad to have something to hold on to . She slipped out with a soft rustle of her silk skirt , but before he had time to close the door behind her she put back her arm for an instant . He had just time to press the palm of her hand to his lips . It was cool . She snatched it away and he had the strength of mind to shut the door after her . He felt like a man chained to the wall and dying of thirst , from whom a cold drink is snatched away . The room became dark suddenly . He thought , "
80898	80944	80945	80945	I	0	" while he walked rigidly to the window , insecure and swaying as if on a tight rope . After a moment he perceived the moon in a sky on which there was no sign of the smallest cloud anywhere . He said to himself , "
80956	80965	80741	80741	you	2031	" he went on thinking with deliberate cruelty , "
80987	80988	80975	80975	I	0	" "
80993	81145	80975	80975	I	0	" Only by stumbling against the side of the bed did he discover that he had gone away from the window . At once he flung himself violently on the bed with his face buried in the pillow , which he bit to restrain the cry of distress about to burst through his lips . Natures schooled into insensibility when once overcome by a mastering passion are like vanquished giants ready for despair . He , a man on service , felt himself shrinking from death and that doubt contained in itself all possible doubts of his own fortitude . The only thing he knew was that he would be gone to - morrow morning . He shuddered along his whole extended length , then lay still gripping a handful of bedclothes in each hand to prevent himself from leaping up in panicky restlessness . He was saying to himself pedantically , "
81168	81209	81164	81164	I	0	" while the tremendous struggle to keep still broke out in waves of perspiration on his forehead . At last sudden oblivion must have descended on him because he turned over and sat up suddenly with the sound of the word "
81211	81286	81287	81287	he	0	" in his ears . A strange , dim , cold light filled the room ; a light he did not recognize for anything he had known before , and at the foot of his bed stood a figure in dark garments with a dark shawl over its head , with a fleshless predatory face and dark hollows for its eyes , silent , expectant , implacable . . . . Is this death ? "
81304	81307	81300	81300	It	2038	" Ecoutez . "
81350	81357	81329	81329	He	0	" Yes , I hear you . "
81358	81365	81368	81368	Catherine	127	" You are an honest man . "
81373	81384	81368	81368	Catherine	127	" The day has broken . You will go away . "
81385	81388	81389	81389	he	0	" Yes , "
81396	81401	81404	81404	Catherine	127	" She is asleep , "
81410	81433	81404	81404	Catherine	127	" exhausted , and you would have to shake her hard before she would wake . You will go . You know , "
81470	81516	81464	81464	She	127	" Ral felt all the anguish of an unearthly experience . This thing that looked like Catherine and spoke like a cruel fate had to be faced . He raised his head in this light that seemed to him appalling and not of this world . "
81525	81529	81522	81522	you	0	" he said . "
81566	81580	81563	81563	you	0	" The apparition which resembled Catherine lowered and raised its hooded head slowly . "
81615	81616	81617	81617	I	0	" "
81622	81645	81619	81619	my	0	" said Lieutenant Ral in measured tones , as if calmed by the excess of horror that old woman inspired him with . "
81656	81657	81658	81658	I	0	" "
81667	81680	81658	81658	I	0	" he said . He sighed deeply and felt as if sleepy . "
81686	81690	81691	81691	Peyrol	136	" he muttered . "
81699	81703	81706	81706	he	136	" announced Catherine . "
81714	81785	81706	81706	he	136	" she added in a troubled voice . Ral , with his feet now on the ground , gave her a side glance ; but she was already gliding away , and when he looked again she had vanished from the room and the door was shut . Catherine , going downstairs , found Peyrol still at the well . He seemed to be looking into it with extreme interest . "
81793	81815	81791	81791	Peyrol	136	" she shouted to him from the doorway . He turned very sharply like a man surprised and came along smiling . "
81824	81828	81821	81822	Mademoiselle Catherine	127	" he said . "
81834	81835	81829	81829	You	127	" "
81838	81842	81829	81829	You	127	" she admitted , "
81862	81863	81864	81864	Michel	150	" "
81885	82162	82190	82190	Peyrol	136	" He drank a mouthful of coffee and took a bite out of a slice of bread . He was hungry . He had been up all night and had even had a conversation with Citizen Scevola . He had also done some work with Michel after daylight ; however , there had not been much to do because the tartane was always kept ready for sea . Then after having again locked up Citizen Scevola , who was extremely concerned as to what was going to happen to him but was left in a state of uncertainty , he had come up to the farm , had gone upstairs where he was busy with various things for a time , and then had stolen down very cautiously to the well , where Catherine , whom he had not expected downstairs so early , had seen him before she went into Lieutenant Ral 's room . While he enjoyed his coffee he listened without any signs of surprise to Catherine 's comments upon the disappearance of Scevola . She had looked into his den . He had not slept on his pallet last night , of that she was certain , and he was nowhere to be seen , not even in the most distant field , from the points of vantage around the farm . It was inconceivable that he should have slipped away to Madrague , where he disliked to go , or to the village , where he was afraid to go . Peyrol remarked that whatever happened to him he was no great loss , but Catherine was not to be soothed . "
82168	82172	82190	82190	Peyrol	136	" she said . "
82192	82193	82187	82187	I	0	" "
82253	82274	82275	82276	The lieutenant	2881	" Catherine stared at him , if such a word as stare can be applied to a profound contemplative gaze . "
82284	82289	82275	82276	The lieutenant	2881	" she repeated cautiously . "
82303	82314	82299	82299	you	136	" The old woman continued to look at him profoundly . "
82322	82428	82299	82299	you	136	" For another minute or so Catherine continued silent in her contemplative attitude . Then her hesitation came to an end . She could not resist the desire to inform Peyrol of the events of the night . As she went on Peyrol forgot the half - full bowl of coffee and his half - eaten piece of bread . Catherine 's voice flowed with austerity . She stood there , imposing and solemn like a peasant - priestess . The relation of what had been to her a soul - shaking experience did not take much time , and she finished with the words , "
82436	82445	82432	82434	an honest man	1955	" And after a pause she insisted further : "
82460	82496	82452	82452	He	2881	" For a moment longer Peyrol continued to look at the coffee in the bowl , then without warning got up with such violence that the chair behind him was thrown back upon the flagstones . "
82505	82537	82452	82452	He	2881	" he shouted suddenly in stentorian tones which not only caused Catherine to raise her hands , but frightened himself , and he dropped at once to a mere forcible utterance . "
82548	82557	82544	82544	me	0	" Even Catherine 's hieratic composure was disturbed . "
82560	82568	82544	82544	me	0	" she said , looking really disconcerted , "
82584	82599	82605	82606	Monsieur Peyrol	128	" Peyrol made as if to leave the kitchen , but Catherine stopped him . "
82608	82620	82605	82606	Monsieur Peyrol	128	" she said , half in entreaty and half in command , "
82670	82679	82663	82663	I	0	" She was shocked by hearing Peyrol declare : "
82686	82712	82663	82663	I	0	" But he sat down again , seemed to catch sight of the coffee bowl and emptied what was left in it down his throat . "
82729	82797	82713	82713	I	0	" said Catherine , in a sort of exasperation but in a very low tone . This phrase in its selfish form expressed a real and profound compassion for her niece . She dreaded the moment when that fatal Arlette would wake up and the dreadful complications of life which her slumbers had suspended would have to be picked up again . Peyrol fidgeted on his seat . "
82814	82818	82807	82807	He	128	" he asked . "
82835	82836	82819	82819	He	128	" "
82853	82889	82819	82819	He	128	" Peyrol exclaimed in a tone of profound annoyance , yet trying to moderate his voice , while Catherine , indulgent to his changing moods , only compressed her lips and nodded at him soothingly . "
82900	82904	82896	82898	people like that	2062	" he mumbled . "
82921	82959	82913	82913	she	1284	" Catherine was heard suddenly , towering above her end of the table . The two women had had a talk before Arlette had been induced by her aunt to lie down . Peyrol gave a start . "
82973	82981	82983	82983	you	127	" he went on with repressed ferocity , "
82994	82995	82983	82983	you	127	" "
83018	83049	83050	83050	He	2064	" she went on , reproducing the very phrase Arlette had used to Ral . She seemed to be thinking aloud , but noticed that Peyrol was listening with attention . "
83059	83073	83050	83050	He	2064	" and the old woman clasped her meagre hands with a sudden gesture . "
83085	83086	83087	83087	You	0	" "
83095	83099	83087	83087	You	0	" declared Peyrol . "
83163	83248	83158	83158	I	0	" He stopped because the inner door of the kitchen came open and Lieutenant Ral stepped in . His sword hung on his forearm by the belt , his hat was on his head . He dropped his little valise on the floor and sat down in the nearest chair to put on his shoes which he had brought down in his other hand . Then he came up to the table . Peyrol , who had kept his eyes on him , thought : "
83262	83284	83251	83260	one who looks like a moth scorched in the fire	2079	" Ral 's eyes were sunk , his cheeks seemed hollowed and the whole face had an arid and dry aspect . "
83301	83305	83287	83287	you	0	" Peyrol observed . "
83367	83393	83347	83347	I	0	" He snatched it from Catherine 's hand , poured some brandy into the lieutenant 's coffee , pushed the bowl towards him and waited . "
83398	83403	83347	83347	I	0	" he said forcibly , "
83420	83430	83406	83406	you	0	" Ral obeyed with a strange , automatic docility . "
83434	83441	83442	83442	I	0	" said Peyrol , getting up , "
83468	83490	83491	83491	Catherine	127	" Till then Ral had not uttered a word , but directly the door closed behind Peyrol he raised his head . "
83493	83514	83491	83491	Catherine	127	" His voice was like a rustle in his throat . She was looking at him steadily and he continued : "
83540	83541	83518	83518	she	127	" "
83548	83561	83518	83518	she	127	" said Catherine in an unmoved voice but clasping her hands convulsively . "
83572	83573	83574	83574	She	127	" "
83579	83584	83574	83574	She	127	" whispered Ral wildly . "
83592	83627	83587	83587	She	127	" repeated Catherine in a mournful tone . Ral got up , put the sword - belt over his head , picked up the valise . There was a little flush on his cheeks . "
83630	84014	83587	83587	She	127	" he said to the silent old woman . She made no answer , but as he turned away she raised her hand a little , hesitated , and let it fall again . It seemed to her that the women of Escampobar had been singled out for divine wrath . Her niece appeared to her like the scapegoat charged with all the murders and blasphemies of the Revolution . She herself too had been cast out from the grace of God . But that had been a long time ago . She had made her peace with Heaven since . Again she raised her hand and , this time , made in the air the sign of the cross at the back of Lieutenant Ral . Meanwhile upstairs Peyrol , scraping his big flat cheek with an English razor - blade at the window , saw Lieutenant Ral on the path to the shore ; and high above there , commanding a vast view of sea and land , he shrugged his shoulders impatiently with no visible provocation . One could not trust those epaulette - wearers . They would cram a fellow 's head with notions either for their own sake or for the sake of the service . Still , he was too old a bird to be caught with chaff ; and besides , that long - legged stiff beggar going down the path with all his officer airs , was honest enough . At any rate he knew a seaman when he saw one , though he was as cold - blooded as a fish . Peyrol had a smile which was a little awry . Cleaning the razor - blade one of a set of twelve in a case he had a vision of a brilliantly hazy ocean and an English Indiaman with her yards braced all ways , her canvas blowing loose above her bloodstained decks overrun by a lot of privateersmen and with the island of Ceylon swelling like a thin blue cloud on the far horizon . He had always wished to own a set of English blades and there he had got it , fell over it as it were , lying on the floor of a cabin which had been already ransacked . "
84024	84164	83587	83587	She	127	" he thought looking at the blade fixedly . And there it was , nearly worn out . The others too . That steel ! And here he was holding the case in his hand as though he had just picked it up from the floor . Same case . Same man . And the steel worn out . He shut the case brusquely , flung it into his sea - chest which was standing open , and slammed the lid down . The feeling which was in his breast and had been known to more articulate men than himself , was that life was a dream less substantial than the vision of Ceylon lying like a cloud on the sea . Dream left astern . Dream straight ahead . This disenchanted philosophy took the shape of fierce swearing . "
84180	84708	84175	84178	Tonnerre de bon Dieu	2086	" While tying his neckcloth he handled it with fury as though he meant to strangle himself with it . He rammed a soft cap on to his venerable locks recklessly , seized his cudgel - but before leaving the room walked up to the window giving on the east . He could not see the Petite Passe on account of the lookout hill , but to the left a great portion of the Hyres roadstead lay spread out before him , pale grey in the morning light , with the land about Cape Blanc swelling in the distance with all its details blurred as yet and only one conspicuous object presenting to his sight something that might have been a lighthouse by its shape , but which Peyrol knew very well was the English corvette already under way and with all her canvas set . This sight pleased Peyrol mainly because he had expected it . The Englishman was doing exactly what he had expected he would do , and Peyrol looked towards the English cruiser with a smile of malicious triumph as if he were confronting her captain . For some reason or other he imagined Captain Vincent as long - faced , with yellow teeth and a wig , whereas that officer wore his own hair and had a set of teeth which would have done honour to a London belle and was really the hidden cause of Captain Vincent appearing so often wreathed in smiles . That ship at this great distance and steering in his direction held Peyrol at the window long enough for the increasing light of the morning to burst into sunshine , colouring and filling - in the flat outline of the land with tints of wood and rock and field , with clear dots of buildings enlivening the view . The sun threw a sort of halo around the ship . Recollecting himself , Peyrol left the room and shut the door quietly . Quietly too he descended the stairs from his garret . On the landing he underwent a short inward struggle , at the end of which he approached the door of Catherine 's room and opening it a little , put his head in . Across the whole width of it he saw Arlette fast asleep . Her aunt had thrown a light coverlet over her . Her low shoes stood at the foot of the bed . Her black hair lay loose on the pillow ; and Peyrol 's gaze became arrested by the long eyelashes on her pale cheek . Suddenly he fancied she moved , and he withdrew his head sharply , pulling the door to . He listened for a moment as if tempted to open it again , but judging it too risky , continued on his way downstairs . At his reappearance in the kitchen Catherine turned sharply . She was dressed for the day , with a big white cap on her head , a black bodice and a brown skirt with ample folds . She had a pair of varnished sabots on her feet over her shoes . "
84714	84722	84175	84178	Tonnerre de bon Dieu	2086	" she said , advancing towards Peyrol . "
84732	84789	84724	84724	Michel	150	" Peyrol thought that if she had been only shorter , what with her black eyes and slightly curved nose she would have looked like a witch . But witches can read people 's thoughts , and he looked openly at Catherine with the pleasant conviction that she could not read his thoughts . He said : "
84817	84849	84850	84850	You	127	" She had a curious expression . She struck Peyrol suddenly as if she were lost in that kitchen in which A she had reigned for many years . He continued : "
84858	84875	84850	84850	You	127	" She seemed to be listening to some distant sound , and after Peyrol had added , "
84882	84900	84901	84902	Monsieur Peyrol	128	" she nodded and after a moment said in a manner that for her was unexpectedly impulsive : "
84910	84922	84923	84923	I	0	" He shrugged his shoulders and with somewhat sinister jocosity remarked : "
84938	84947	84923	84923	I	0	" She turned her back on him abruptly . "
84951	84965	84982	84982	Phew	195	" Peyrol excused himself in a tone of gloom rather than of apology . "
85055	85059	85060	85060	he	2091	" he repeated , "
85083	85084	85085	85085	He	0	" "
85100	85103	85091	85091	her	127	" Monsieur , "
85105	85108	85091	85091	her	127	" Peyrol , "
85153	85191	85141	85141	his	128	" But you see , Mademoiselle Catherine , you were not like the others . You allowed yourself to be struck all of a heap , and at the same time you were too hard on yourself . "
85211	85223	85208	85208	she	127	" Perhaps ! We Escampobar women were always hard on ourselves . "
85224	85247	85208	85208	she	127	" That 's what I say . If you had had things happen to you which happened to me . . . . "
85248	85289	85290	85290	He	2096	" But you men , you are different . lt does n't matter what you do . You have got your own strength . You need not be hard on yourselves . You go from one thing to another thoughtlessly . "
85354	85371	85373	85374	the rover	822	" It will be a good soup , I see , at noon to - day , "
85554	85573	85552	85552	He	2096	" H'm ! Thunder at sunrise . It must be in the west . It only wanted that ! "
85692	85715	85685	85685	he	2096	" Go from one thing to another thoughtlessly ! Indeed ! . . . That 's all old Catherine knows about it . "
85849	85852	85828	85828	Michel	150	" matre . "
86008	86013	86015	86015	Peyrol	128	" Le moment approche , "
86046	86053	86054	86054	He	128	" The great moment - eh ? "
86072	86079	86081	86082	the latter	1154	" What 's this infernal company ? "
86089	86096	86098	86098	Peyrol	128	" All old friends - quoi ? "
86104	86252	86098	86098	Peyrol	128	" We will keep that little affair amongst ourselves . The fewer the men the greater the glory . Catherine is getting the vegetables ready for the noonday soup and the Englishman is coming down towards the Passe where he will arrive about noon too , ready to have his eye put out . You know , lieutenant , that will be your job . You may depend on me for sending you off when the moment comes . For what is it to you ? You have no friends , you have not even a petite amie . As to expecting an old rover like me - oh no , lieutenant ! Of course liberty is sweet , but what do you know of it , you epaulette - wearers ? Moreover , I am no good for quarter - deck talks and all that politeness . "
86253	86266	86268	86269	Lieutenant Ral	136	" I wish , Peyrol , you would not talk so much , "
86290	86328	86276	86276	He	136	" And I do n't see what the actual moment matters . I am going to look for the fleet . All you have to do is to hoist the sails for me and then scramble ashore . "
86329	86333	86335	86335	Peyrol	128	" Very simple , "
86346	86369	86335	86335	Peyrol	128	" Quoique leurs chapeaux sont bien laids God - dam ! Moi , j'aime les Anglais Ils ont un si bon caractre ! "
86370	86375	86276	86276	He	136	" H ! Citoyen ! "
86383	86413	86415	86415	Peyrol	128	" He is n't asleep , you know , but he is n't like the English , he has a sacr mauvais caractre . He got into his head , "
86424	86448	86415	86415	Peyrol	128	" that you locked him up in this cabin last night . Did you notice the venomous glance he gave you just now ? "
86470	86556	86557	86557	He	136	" I wish to goodness I knew how that thunderstorm is getting on and what course it is shaping . I ca n't find that out unless I go up to the farm and get a view to the westward . It may be as far as the Rhne Valley ; no doubt it is and it will come out of it too , curses on it . One wo n't be able to reckon on half an hour of steady wind from any quarter . "
86649	86655	86656	86656	he	150	" It 's hot early , "
86737	86741	86743	86743	Peyrol	136	" Like this , "
86745	86763	86743	86743	Peyrol	136	" you have only to let go the ropes and you will be under canvas at once . "
86783	86828	86777	86777	He	150	" I am sneaking off . No , there is honour , duty . And of course I will return . But when ? They will forget all about me and I shall never be exchanged . This war may last for years , - "
86850	86857	86858	86858	he	150	" She will be in despair , "
86888	86903	86883	86883	he	150	" But in a month 's time will she even give me a thought ? "
86939	86944	86945	86945	he	150	" I am mad , "
86991	87044	86987	86987	He	150	" Young men have been known to die suddenly ; why should not I ? I am , as a matter of fact , at the end of my endurance . I am half dead already . Yes ! but what is left of that life does not belong to me now . "
87045	87048	87049	87049	he	150	" Peyrol , "
87080	87127	87065	87065	he	150	" I have left a letter for the Secretary General at the Majorit to pay twenty - five hundred francs to Jean - you are Jean , are you not ? - Peyrol , price of the tartane in which I sail . Is that right ? "
87128	87136	87138	87138	Peyrol	136	" What did you do that for ? "
87145	87152	87065	87065	he	150	" To get me into trouble ? "
87153	87204	87211	87211	his	136	" Do n't be a fool , gunner , nobody remembers your , name . It is buried under a stack of blackened paper . I must ask you to go there and tell them that you have seen with your own eyes Lieutenant Ral sail away on his mission . "
87218	87241	87242	87242	His	136	" Oh , yes , I see myself going there . Twenty - five hundred francs ! Twenty - five hundred fiddlesticks . "
87247	87279	87280	87280	He	136	" I heard some one say that you were an honest man , and I suppose this is a proof of it . Well , to the devil with your honesty . "
87289	87301	87280	87280	He	136	" He does n't even pretend to listen to what I say "
87325	87328	87329	87329	he	136	" Pah ! "
87397	87399	87392	87393	Citizen Scevola	123	" Citoyen "
87415	87418	87410	87410	Peyrol	136	" Well ? "
87419	87429	87431	87431	Scevola	123	" What are you going to do with me ? "
87433	87450	87452	87452	Peyrol	136	" You would not give me an account of how you came on board this tartane , "
87461	87475	87452	87452	Peyrol	136	" therefore I need not tell you what I will do with you . "
87699	87705	87706	87706	he	136	" Phew ! a chauffe , "
87779	87793	87794	87794	he	571	" I believe you are one of those wretches corrupted by English gold , "
87888	87903	87883	87883	Peyrol	136	" I am afraid you will get very wet , lieutenant , before long , "
87917	87927	87911	87911	he	571	" Wet ! He would n't mind getting drowned . "
87973	87984	87970	87970	Ral	136	" Is it not time to haul out , gunner ? "
87989	88001	87986	87986	Peyrol	136	" There is not a breath of wind anywhere for miles . "
88288	88298	88304	88304	her	127	" Scevola ! Was he murdering her up there ? "
88505	88510	88484	88484	Peyrol	136	" Peyrol , Peyrol ! "
88525	88528	88484	88484	Peyrol	136	" Peyrol ! "
88633	88649	88650	88650	she	127	" What is this , in Heaven 's name ? Where are you rushing to ? "
88664	88673	88654	88655	the other	506	" I woke up from an awful dream . "
88713	88718	88719	88719	she	1151	" Dreams are nothing , "
88722	88731	88719	88719	she	1151	" You are awake now . . . . "
88757	88763	88765	88765	Arlette	121	" They were killing him , "
88778	88787	88765	88765	Arlette	121	" I tell you they were killing him . "
88788	88798	88799	88799	She	121	" Be quiet . Were you dreaming of Peyrol ? "
88809	88814	88799	88799	She	121	" No . Eugne . "
89099	89104	89079	89079	Arlette	121	" Where is he ? "
89122	89124	89126	89126	Ral	136	" he "
89131	89139	89128	89128	She	127	" He went away a long time ago "
89155	89172	89128	89128	She	127	" He is coming back , Arlette - for nothing will keep him away from you . "
89187	89192	89173	89173	Arlette	121	" Peyrol , Peyrol ! "
89196	89205	89173	89173	Arlette	121	" I want Eugne now . This moment . "
89216	89223	89224	89224	she	127	" He has departed on service , "
89255	89287	89252	89252	she	127	" You and Peyrol have been plotting to rob me of my reason . But I will know how to make that old man give him up . He is mine ! "
89391	89396	89397	89397	she	121	" Peyrol , Peyrol ! "
89415	89421	89412	89412	she	121	" I want him back . "
89549	89559	89521	89521	Arlette	121	" Peyrol ! Help ! Pey - - rol ! "
89578	89585	89586	89586	he	136	" She is calling to me , "
89598	89611	89586	89586	he	136	" Well leaped ! Sacr nom ! . . . Well leaped ! "
89619	89629	89613	89613	he	136	" She will break her legs or her neck . "
89630	89637	89639	89639	Arlette	121	" I see you , Peyrol , "
89650	89656	89639	89639	Arlette	121	" Do n't you dare . "
89657	89664	89666	89667	the rover	822	" Yes , here I am , "
89762	89770	89776	89776	her	121	" Misrable ! Do n't you dare ! "
89793	89810	89785	89785	she	121	" Peyrol , my friend , my dear old friend . Give him back to me , "
89826	89835	89836	89836	she	121	" You used to love me , Peyrol , "
90033	90057	90026	90026	Peyrol	136	" We ca n't put her ashore and leave her lying in the rain . She must be taken up to the house . "
90106	90117	90118	90118	he	136	" She has fainted from rage at her old Peyrol , "
90124	90156	90118	90118	he	136	" Strange things do happen . However , lieutenant , you had better take her under the arms and step ashore first . I will help you . Ready ? Lift . "
90217	90220	90221	90221	he	136	" Ha ! "
90224	90291	90221	90221	he	136	" You will be able to carry her yourself the rest of the way and give her up to old Catherine . Get a firm footing and I will lift her and place her in your arms . You can walk the distance quite easily . There . . . . Hold her a little higher , or her feet will be catching on the stones . "
90329	90334	90322	90322	Peyrol	136	" I am tired . "
90335	90340	90342	90342	Ral	136	" She is light , "
90344	90396	90397	90398	The lieutenant	2881	" Parbleu , she is light . If she were dead , you would find her heavy enough . Allons , lieutenant . No ! I am not coming . What 's the good ? I 'll stay down here . I have no mind to listen to Catherine 's scolding . "
90445	90452	90454	90454	Ral	136	" What am I to do ? "
90456	90509	90454	90454	Ral	136	" Do ? Why , give her up to old Catherine . And you may just as well tell her that I will be coming along directly . That will cheer her up . I used to count for something in that house . Allez . For our time is very short . "
90708	90710	90671	90671	his	136	" Allez "
90799	90809	90774	90774	He	123	" What are you going to do with me ? "
90810	90822	90823	90823	Peyrol	136	" What do you think of a little promenade at sea ? "
90854	90862	90863	90863	Michel	150	" Unbind me . Put me ashore . "
90887	90894	90895	90895	he	136	" You shall be untied presently , "
90954	90962	90951	90951	his	136	" Haul on the line , Michel . "
91138	91167	91130	91130	He	123	" H , Michel ! Come here and cast loose the citizen . It is only fair that he should be untied for a little excursion at sea . "
91186	91213	91177	91177	himself	136	" Like this , should the tartane get capsized in a squall , you will have an equal chance with us to swim for your life . "
91233	91301	91219	91219	He	136	" You came on board for some murderous purpose . Who you were after unless it was myself , God only knows . I feel quite justified in giving you a little outing at sea . I wo n't conceal from you , citizen , that it may not be without risk to life or limb . But you have only yourself to thank for being here . "
91338	91344	91346	91346	Peyrol	136	" She feels the sea , "
91357	91367	91346	91346	Peyrol	136	" This is different from your lagoon , Michel . "
91368	91373	91375	91375	Michel	150	" To be sure , "
91380	91408	91409	91409	Michel	150	" Does n't it seem funny to you , as you look back at the shore , to think that you have left nothing and nobody behind ? "
91455	91458	91453	91453	he	150	" notre matre "
91469	91472	91473	91473	he	150	" Possibly , "
91482	91495	91497	91498	the rover	822	" Well , you are lucky , take my word for it , "
91514	91525	91497	91498	the rover	822	" You have not even a dog to miss you . "
91526	91535	91497	91498	the rover	822	" I have only you , Matre Peyrol . "
91536	91544	91546	91546	Peyrol	204	" That 's what I was thinking , "
91580	91583	91584	91584	Peyrol	204	" No , "
91594	91602	91603	91603	He	204	" I could not leave you behind . "
91611	91618	91619	91619	he	204	" Put your hand in there , "
91654	91684	91639	91639	Peyrol	204	" If I had gone away by myself , I would have left you marooned on this earth like a man thrown out to die on a desert island . "
91743	91752	91726	91726	he	150	" Somebody must be last in this world . "
91753	91776	91726	91726	he	150	" Well , then , you will have to forgive me all that may happen between this and the hour of sunset . "
91800	91811	91797	91797	Peyrol	204	" She has not forgotten how to walk the seas . "
91962	91965	91976	91976	He	136	" Peyrol , "
92092	92098	92084	92084	He	136	" Peyrol has betrayed me ! "
92302	92306	92295	92295	he	136	" Of course ! "
92480	92488	92475	92476	the master	2770	" there was a craft acting suspiciously . "
92702	92707	92709	92710	the captain	923	" Take the glass , "
92712	92739	92709	92710	the captain	923	" and have a look at that vessel under the land . Is she anything like the tartane that you say you have been aboard of ? "
92745	92790	92740	92740	Symons	144	" I think I can swear to those painted mastheads , your honour . It is the last thing I remember before that murderous ruffian knocked me senseless . The moon shone on them . I can make them out now with the glass . "
92866	92873	92875	92875	Symons	144	" You see , your honour , "
92877	92953	92954	92954	Symons	144	" he thought I was not likely to escape after getting a blow that would have killed nine out of any ten men . So he went away to boast of what he had done before the people ashore ; because one of his chums , worse than himself , came down thinking he would kill me with a dam big manure fork , saving your honour 's presence . A regular savage he was . "
93123	93149	93113	93113	he	144	" I can make out three heads aboard , your honour , and one is white . I would swear to that white head anywhere . "
93191	93324	93178	93178	He	133	" He has done a rather smart thing . He will dodge here till dark and then get away . lt is perfectly absurd . I do n't want to send the boats too close to the battery . And if I do he may simply sail away from them and be round the land long before we are ready to give him chase . Darkness will be his best friend . However , we will keep a watch on him in case he is tempted to give us the slip late in the afternoon . In that case we will have a good try to catch him . If he has anything aboard I should like to get hold of it . It may be of some importance , after all . "
93486	93491	93492	93492	he	136	" Let us go , "
93884	93900	93847	93847	Arlette	121	" To - morrow you and I will have to walk down to the church . "
93981	93991	93993	93993	Arlette	121	" Oh , yes , you will , Aunt , "
93995	94018	94019	94019	Catherine	127	" You will have to come with me to pray for Peyrol , whom you and I shall never see any more . "
94511	94540	94491	94491	He	133	" We must not sink that craft on any account . If we could get only an hour 's calm , we would carry her with the boats . "
94562	94565	94567	94568	Captain Vincent	133	" No , "
94570	94633	94634	94634	he	133	" and in about an hour it will be dark , and then he may very well give us the slip . The coast is not very far off and there are batteries on both sides of Frjus , under any of which he will be as safe from capture as though he were hove up on the beach . And look , "
94642	94652	94634	94634	he	133	" this is what the fellow means to do . "
94653	94658	94660	94661	the lieutenant	2881	" Yes , sir , "
94680	94688	94664	94664	his	2881	" he is keeping off the wind . "
94689	94700	94702	94703	Captain Vincent	133	" We will have him in less than an hour , "
94725	94729	94730	94730	he	133	" After all , "
94734	94749	94730	94730	he	133	" properly speaking , it is a race between the Amelia and the night . "
94750	94761	94763	94765	the first lieutenant	4323	" And it will be dark early to - day , "
94775	94789	94763	94765	the first lieutenant	4323	" Shall we take the yards off the back - stays , sir ? "
94790	94793	94795	94796	Captain Vincent	133	" No , "
94798	94852	94795	94796	Captain Vincent	133	" There is a clever seaman aboard that tartane . He is running off now , but at any time he may haul up again . We must not follow him too closely , or we shall lose the advantage which we have now . That man is determined on making his escape . "
94954	94960	94961	94961	his	133	" This is the moment , "
94967	94981	94961	94961	his	133	" Ease off the mainsheet , Michel . A little now , only . "
95052	95059	95060	95060	he	136	" That 's so , camarade , "
95116	95122	95123	95123	he	136	" Where is the citizen ? "
95136	95163	95123	95123	he	136	" He is n't gone overboard , is he ? I do n't seem to have seen him since we rounded the land near Porquerolles Castle . "
95189	95193	95195	95195	Peyrol	136	" Go forward , "
95197	95214	95215	95215	he	136	" and ease off the fore - sheet now a little . This tartane has wings , "
95386	95393	95379	95379	he	136	" La terre ! La terre ! "
95394	95397	95399	95399	Peyrol	136	" Certainly , "
95406	95411	95399	95399	Peyrol	136	" What of that ? "
95412	95421	95423	95424	the citizen	1232	" I do n't want to be drowned ! "
95443	95460	95461	95461	he	136	" If you stay where you are , I assure you that you will . . . "
95473	95479	95480	95480	He	136	" not die by drowning . "
95486	95494	95482	95482	his	136	" I know that man 's mind . "
95495	95502	95504	95504	Scevola	123	" What man ? Whose mind ? "
95511	95519	95504	95504	Scevola	123	" We are only three on board . "
95591	95596	95597	95597	he	2378	" We are gaining , "
95601	95736	95597	95597	he	2378	" I intend to close with him to windward . We wo n't risk any of his tricks . It is very difficult to outmanuvre a Frenchman , as you know . Send a few armed marines on the forecastle - head . I am afraid the only way to get hold of this tartane is to disable the men on board of her . I wish to goodness I could think of some other . When we close with her , let the marines fire a well - aimed volley . You must get some marines to stand by aft as well . I hope we may shoot away his halliards ; once his sails are down on his deck he is ours for the trouble of putting a boat over the side . "
95928	95931	95932	95932	he	136	" No ! "
95950	95995	95932	95932	he	136	" No ! I could not have left you behind with not even a dog for company . Devil take me if I do n't think you would not have thanked me for it either . What do you say to that , Michel ? "
96028	96037	96016	96016	he	136	" I think you are right , matre . "
96038	96070	95932	95932	he	136	" Listen then , Michel . That ship will be alongside of us in less than half an hour . As she comes up they will open on us with musketry . "
96071	96080	96082	96082	Michel	150	" They will open on us . . . "
96088	96101	96082	96082	Michel	150	" But how do you know they will do that , matre ? "
96102	96116	96118	96118	Peyrol	136	" Because her captain has got to obey what is in my mind , "
96129	96177	96178	96178	He	136	" He will do it as sure as if I were at his car telling him what to do . He will do it because he is a first - rate seaman , but I , Michel , I am just a little bit cleverer than he . "
96200	96223	96196	96196	his	136	" He will do it because no more than half a mile ahead of us is the spot where Peyrol will die ! "
96247	96258	96259	96259	he	822	" I may be shot through the heart at once , "
96262	96333	96259	96259	he	822	" and in that case you have my permission to let go the halliards if you are alive yourself . But if I live I mean to put the helm down . When I do that you will let go the foresheet to help the tartane to fly into the wind 's eye . This is my last order to you . Now go forward and fear nothing . Adieu . "
96470	96479	96484	96485	the master	2770	" had hit the white - haired chap . "
96487	96497	96480	96481	Captain Vincent	133	" Get the ship round on the other tack . "
96542	96550	96534	96536	boatswain 's mates	2401	" Hands shorten sail . About ship . "
96907	96915	96901	96901	Arlette	121	" Peyrol , do n't you dare ! "
97217	97222	97223	97223	he	136	" Hard a starboard ! "
97341	97344	97453	97454	Mr. Bolt	137	" Steady ! "
97345	97446	97453	97454	Mr. Bolt	137	" . . . And with the sound of that familiar English word ringing in his ears Peyrol smiled to his visions and died . The Amelia , stripped down to her topsails and hove to , rose and fell easily while on her quarter about a cable 's length away Peyrol 's tartane tumbled like a lifeless corpse amongst the seas . Captain Vincent , in his favourite attitude of leaning over the rail , kept his eyes fastened on his prize . Mr. Bolt , who had been sent for , waited patiently till his commander turned round . "
97587	97715	97581	97581	I	0	" Captain Vincent , his white teeth gleaming in the dusk , gave some further orders in a lower tone , and Mr. Bolt departed in a hurry . Half an hour afterwards he was back on board , and the Amelia , with the tartane in tow , made sail to the eastward in search of the blockading fleet . Mr. Bolt , introduced into a cabin strongly lighted by a swinging lamp , tendered to his captain across the table a sail - cloth package corded and scaled , and a piece of paper folded in four , which , he explained , seemed to be a certificate of registry , strangely enough mentioning no name . Captain Vincent seized the grey canvas package eagerly . "
97725	97736	97723	97723	Bolt	137	" he said , turning it over in his hands . "
97745	97798	97799	97799	he	137	" Bolt said that he had found three dead men , two on the after - deck and one lying at the bottom of the open hold with the bare end of the foresheet in his hand - ' shot down , I suppose , just as he had let it go , "
97875	97879	97880	97881	An officer	242	" E. Ral . "
97918	97927	97929	97929	Bolt	137	" Looks as if somebody had tumbled overboard , "
97952	97956	97958	97959	Captain Vincent	133	" By Heavens ! "
97961	97994	97958	97959	Captain Vincent	133	" he was that ! Do you know , Bolt , that he nearly managed to escape us ? Another twenty minutes would have done it . How many wounds had he ? "
97995	98008	98010	98010	Bolt	137	" Three I think , sir . I did not look closely , "
98012	98024	98026	98027	Captain Vincent	133	" I hated the necessity of shooting brave men like dogs , "
98029	98045	98046	98046	he	133	" Still , it was the only way ; and there may be something here , "
98058	98073	98046	98046	he	133	" that will justify me in my own eyes . You may go now . "
98166	98172	98128	98128	he	133	" What ship is that ? "
98173	98180	98183	98184	Captain Vincent	133	" His Majesty 's sloop Amelia , "
98186	98194	98183	98184	Captain Vincent	133	" What ship is that , pray ? "
98214	98232	98183	98184	Captain Vincent	133	" Is that you , Vincent ? Do n't you know the Superb when you see her ? "
98233	98255	98183	98184	Captain Vincent	133	" Not in the dark , Keats . How are you ? I am in a hurry to speak the Admiral . "
98256	98263	98183	98184	Captain Vincent	133	" The fleet is lying by , "
98289	98325	98183	98184	Captain Vincent	133	" The Admiral bears S.S.E. If you stretch on till daylight as you are , you will fetch him on the other tack in time for breakfast on board the Victory . Is anything up ? "
98352	98356	98358	98359	Captain Vincent	133	" Not much , "
98361	98367	98358	98359	Captain Vincent	133	" I made a prize . "
98368	98375	98377	98379	the swift inquiry	2449	" Have you been in action ? "
98381	98390	98377	98379	the swift inquiry	2449	" No , no . Piece of luck . "
98391	98397	98399	98401	the speaking trumpet	2450	" Where 's your prize ? "
98405	98410	98412	98413	Captain Vincent	133	" In my desk , "
98420	98454	98455	98455	He	133	" Enemy dispatches . . . . I say , Keats , fill on your ship . Fill on her , I say , or you will be falling on board of me . "
98461	98481	98482	98482	he	133	" Clap some hands at once on the tow - line and run that tartane close under our stern , "
98491	98508	98482	98482	he	133	" or else the old Superb will walk over her without ever knowing anything about it . "
98736	98765	98726	98727	Captain Vincent	133	" A tartane ! Captured on board a tartane ! How on earth did you pitch upon that one out of the hundreds you must see every month ? "
98766	98780	98782	98783	Captain Vincent	133	" I must confess that I got hold accidentally of some curious information , "
98785	98794	98782	98783	Captain Vincent	133	" It was all a piece of luck . "
98925	98928	98930	98931	Lord Nelson	141	" Why ! "
98943	98951	98930	98931	Lord Nelson	141	" you have that tartane in tow ! "
98952	98989	98930	98931	Lord Nelson	141	" I thought that your lordship would perhaps like to see a 40 - ton lateen craft which has led such a chase to , I daresay , the fastest sloop in his Majesty 's service . "
98990	98997	98999	99000	the Admiral	3016	" How did it all begin ? "
99009	99026	99028	99044	Captain Vincent , who did not think it necessary to enlarge upon that part of the story	2471	" As I have already hinted to your lordship , certain information came in my way , "
99046	99205	99206	99207	Captain Vincent	133	" This tartane , which is not very different to look at from the other tartanes along the coast between Cette and Genoa , had started from a cove on the Giens Peninsula . An old man with a white head of hair was entrusted with the service and really they could have found nobody better . He came round Cape Esterel intending to pass through the Hyres roadstead . Apparently he did not expect to find the Amelia in his way . And it was there that he made his only mistake . If he had kept on his course I would probably have taken no more notice of him than of two other craft that were in sight then . But he acted suspiciously by hauling up for the battery on Porquerolles . This manuvre in connection with the information of which I spoke decided me to overhaul him and see what he had on board . "
99217	99341	99342	99343	The Admiral	3016	" I assure your lordship that I never gave an order with greater reluctance than to open musketry fire on that craft ; but the old man had given such proofs of his seamanship and determination that there was nothing else for it . Why ! at the very moment he had the Amelia alongside of him he still made a most clever attempt to prolong the chase . There were only a few minutes of daylight left , and in the darkness we might very well have lost him . Considering that they all could have saved their lives simply by striking their sails on deck , I can not refuse them my admiration and especially to the white - haired man . "
99367	99397	99342	99343	The Admiral	3016	" You have a very smart little ship , Vincent . Very fit for the work I have given you to do . French built , is n't she ? "
99398	99409	99342	99343	The Admiral	3016	" Yes , my lord . They are great shipbuilders . "
99410	99422	99424	99425	the Admiral	3016	" You do n't seem to hate the French , Vincent , "
99430	99438	99440	99441	Captain Vincent	133	" Not that kind , my lord , "
99446	99482	99440	99441	Captain Vincent	133	" I detest their political principles and the characters of their public men , but your lordship will admit that for courage and determination we could not have found worthier adversaries anywhere on this globe . "
99483	99494	99496	99497	Lord Nelson	141	" I never said that they were to be despised , "
99499	99553	99554	99554	he	141	" Resource , courage , yes . . . . If that Toulon fleet gives me the slip , all our squadrons from Gibraltar to Brest will be in jeopardy . Why do n't they come out and be done with it ? Do n't I keep far enough out of their way ? "
99633	99641	99642	99642	he	141	" This is anxious work , Vincent , "
99645	99732	99733	99733	he	141	" It is killing me . I aspire to repose somewhere in the country , in the midst of fields , out of reach of the sea and the Admiralty and dispatches and orders , and responsibility too . I have been just finishing a letter to tell them at home I have hardly enough breath in my body to carry me on from day to day . . . . But I am like that white - headed man you admire so much , Vincent , "
99741	99780	99733	99733	he	141	" I will stick to my task till perhaps some shot from the enemy puts an end to everything . . . . Let us see what there may be in those papers you have brought on board . "
99793	99800	99802	99803	the Admiral	3016	" What is it all about ? "
99816	99850	99802	99803	the Admiral	3016	" At the first glance the most important , my lord , are the orders for marine authorities in Corsica and Naples to make certain dispositions in view of an expedition to Egypt . "
99851	99857	99859	99860	the Admiral	3016	" I always thought so , "
99873	99919	99920	99920	he	3016	" This is a smart piece of work on your part , Vincent . I can do no better than send you back to your station . Yes . . . Egypt . . . the Easts . . . . Everything points that way , "
99955	99962	99964	99965	Lord Nelson	141	" And , yet who knows ! "
99973	99993	99964	99965	Lord Nelson	141	" But the blame or the glory must be mine alone . I will seek counsel from no man . "
100018	100025	100026	100026	he	133	" How long can he last ? "
100338	100341	100342	100342	he	133	" Yet , "
100345	100397	100342	100342	he	133	" they have been asking for it . There could be only one end to that affair . But the fact remains that they were defenceless and unarmed and particularly harmless - looking , and at the same time as brave as any . That old chap now . . . . "
100612	100681	100682	100682	he	133	" He looks very thin and worn out , but I do n't think he is as ill as he thinks he is . I am sure you all would like to know that his lordship is pleased with our yesterday 's work - those papers were of some importance you know - and generally with the Amelia . It was a queer chase , was n't it ? "
100686	100708	100682	100682	he	133	" That tartane was clearly and unmistakably running away from us . But she never had a chance against the Amelia . "
100970	100989	100965	100967	the first lieutenant	4323	" What are we going to do with that tartane , sir ? Our men are on board . "
100990	101000	101002	101003	Captain Vincent	133	" We are going to sink her by gunfire , "
101006	101055	101056	101057	The lieutenant	2881	" His ship makes a very good coffin for a seaman , and those men deserve better than to be thrown overboard to roll on the waves . Let them rest quietly at the bottom of the sea in the craft to which they had stuck so well . "
101112	101118	101119	101119	he	133	" Ah ! Mr. Bolt , "
101133	101144	101119	101119	he	133	" Did they have a flag on board that craft ? "
101145	101180	101181	101181	He	133	" I think she had a tiny bit of ensign when the chase began , sir , but it must have blown away . It is not at the end of her mainyard now . "
101187	101195	101196	101196	he	133	" The halliards are rove , though , "
101199	101210	101212	101213	Captain Vincent	133	" We must have a French ensign somewhere on board , "
101215	101220	101212	101213	Captain Vincent	133	" Certainly , sir , "
101230	101236	101238	101239	Captain Vincent	133	" Well , Mr. Bolt , "
101241	101274	101275	101275	He	133	" you have had most to do with all this . Take a few men with you , bend the French ensign on the halliards and sway his mainyard to the masthead . "
101285	101309	101275	101275	He	133	" After all they never surrendered and , by heavens , gentlemen , we will let them go down with their colours flying . "
102338	102348	102350	102351	the priest	852	" But for whose soul are we to pray ? "
102358	102366	102368	102368	Catherine	127	" Pray for the soul of Jean , "
102370	102381	102368	102368	Catherine	127	" Yes , Jean . There is no other name . "
102834	102845	102847	102848	Madame Ral	212	" How did he get all that lot of gold ? "
102851	102872	102847	102848	Madame Ral	212	" He could not possibly want it ; and , Eugne , why should he have put it down there ? "
102873	102880	102882	102882	Ral	212	" That , ma chre amie , "
102884	102949	102882	102882	Ral	212	" is not an easy question to answer . Men and women are not so simple as they seem . Even you , fermire he used to give his wife that name jocularly , sometimes , are not so simple as some people would take you to be . I think that if Peyrol were here he could not perhaps answer your question himself . "
103187	103193	103155	103169	The cripple of the Madrague in his quality of Peyrol 's friend for the rover	2628	" C'est un homme , a "
103278	103288	103268	103268	his	2639	" Everything has been done as you ordered , madame "
103315	103323	103325	103326	Captain Ral	214	" We were just talking of Peyrol , "
