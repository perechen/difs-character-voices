1515	1548	1549	1550	The Hindus	814	' shrilled little Chota Lal in his gilt - embroidered cap . His father was worth perhaps half a million sterling , but India is the only democratic land in the world . '
1572	1710	1567	1570	a pastry - cook	4457	' He stopped ; for there shuffled round the corner , from the roaring Motee Bazar , such a man as Kim , who thought he knew all castes , had never seen . He was nearly six feet high , dressed in fold upon fold of dingy stuff like horse - blanketing , and not one fold of it could Kim refer to any known trade or profession . At his belt hung a long open - work iron pencase and a wooden rosary such as holy men wear . On his head was a gigantic sort of tam - o'-shanter . His face was yellow and wrinkled , like that of Fook Shing , the Chinese bootmaker in the bazar . His eyes turned up at the corners and looked like little slits of onyx . '
1715	1722	1726	1727	a man	750	' said Kim to his companions . '
1729	1739	1726	1727	a man	750	' said Abdullah , finger in mouth , staring . '

1761	1762	1763	1764	A priest	820	' '
1768	1777	1763	1764	A priest	820	' said Chota Lal , spying the rosary . '
1787	1788	1780	1780	He	750	' '
1793	1802	1780	1780	He	750	' said the policeman , shaking his head . '

1862	1892	1859	1860	a buffalo	825	' The man turned helplessly and drifted towards the boys . He was old , and his woollen gaberdine still reeked of the stinking artemisia of the mountain passes . '
1902	1910	1859	1860	a buffalo	825	' he said in very fair Urdu . '
1920	1942	1859	1860	a buffalo	825	' Kim gave him no title - such as Lala or Mian . He could not divine the man 's creed . '

2079	2103	2075	2077	Khitai a Chinaman	357	' said Abdullah proudly . Fook Shing had once chased him out of his shop for spitting at the joss above the boots . '

2250	2277	2247	2247	thou	849	' He fumbled in his bosom and drew forth a worn , wooden begging- bowl . The boys nodded . All priests of their acquaintance begged . '
2286	2299	2247	2247	thou	849	' He turned his head like an old tortoise in the sunlight . '
2315	2329	2247	2247	thou	849	' He repeated the last words as one making sure of an address . '

2420	2430	2431	2431	He	851	' said Abdullah , the Mohammedan . Kim laughed . '
2439	2448	2449	2449	Kim	344	' laps , and be safe . Come ! '
2672	2685	2686	2687	the lama	868	' The Lord ! The Lord ! It is Sakya Muni himself , '
2725	2752	2693	2693	his	868	' And He is here ! The Most Excellent Law is here also . My pilgrimage is well begun . And what work ! What work ! '
2753	2759	2761	2761	Kim	344	' Yonder is the Sahib . '
2809	2817	2894	2894	he	868	' Yes , that is my name , '
2826	2854	2856	2857	the lama	868	' One of us who had made pilgrimage to the Holy Places - he is now Abbot of the Lung - Cho Monastery - gave it me , '
2859	2865	2856	2857	the lama	868	' He spoke of these . '
2873	2892	2894	2894	he	868	' Welcome , then , O lama from Tibet . Here be the images , and I am here '
2902	2913	2894	2894	he	868	' to gather knowledge . Come to my office awhile . '
3008	3043	2980	2981	The lama	868	' march away . The Curator brought out a huge book of photos and showed him that very place , perched on its crag , overlooking the gigantic valley of many - hued strata . '
3048	3063	2980	2981	The lama	868	' The lama mounted a pair of horn - rimmed spectacles of Chinese work . '
3124	3125	3093	3095	Lung - Cho	365	' '
3143	3480	3482	3482	he	895	' Out shuffled the lama to the main hall , and , the Curator beside him , went through the collection with the reverence of a devotee and the appreciative instinct of a craftsman . Incident by incident in the beautiful story he identified on the blurred stone , puzzled here and there by the unfamiliar Greek convention , but delighted as a child at each new trove . Where the sequence failed , as in the Annunciation , the Curator supplied it from his mound of books - French and German , with photographs and reproductions . Here was the devout Asita , the pendant of Simeon in the Christian story , holding the Holy Child on his knee while mother and father listened ; and here were incidents in the legend of the cousin Devadatta . Here was the wicked woman who accused the Master of impurity , all confounded ; here was the teaching in the Deer - park ; the miracle that stunned the fire - worshippers ; here was the Bodhisat in royal state as a prince ; the miraculous birth ; the death at Kusinagara , where the weak disciple fainted ; while there were almost countless repetitions of the meditation under the Bodhi tree ; and the adoration of the alms - bowl was everywhere . In a few minutes the Curator saw that his guest was no mere bead- telling mendicant , but a scholar of parts . And they went at it all over again , the lama taking snuff , wiping his spectacles , and talking at railway speed in a bewildering mixture of Urdu and Tibetan . He had heard of the travels of the Chinese pilgrims , Fu- Hiouen and Hwen - Tsiang , and was anxious to know if there was any translation of their record . He drew in his breath as he turned helplessly over the pages of Beal and Stanislas Julien . " Tis all here . A treasure locked . '
3630	3689	3693	3693	his	868	' And thus it was , O Fountain of Wisdom , that I decided to go to the Holy Places which His foot had trod - to the Birthplace , even to Kapila ; then to Mahabodhi , which is Buddh Gaya - to the Monastery - to the Deer - park -to the place of His death . '
3696	3763	3693	3693	his	868	' And I come here alone . For five - seven - eighteen - forty years it was in my mind that the Old Law was not well followed ; being overlaid , as thou knowest , with devildom , charms , and idolatry . Even as the child outside said but now . Ay , even as the child said , with but - parasti . '
3764	3772	3693	3693	his	868	' So it comes with all faiths . '
3773	3850	3693	3693	his	868	' Thinkest thou ? The books of my lamassery I read , and they were dried pith ; and the later ritual with which we of the Reformed Law have cumbered ourselves - that , too , had no worth to these old eyes . Even the followers of the Excellent One are at feud on feud with one another . It is all illusion . Ay , maya , illusion . But I have another desire '
3875	3931	3932	3932	He	813	' Your scholars , by these books , have followed the Blessed Feet in all their wanderings ; but there are things which they have not sought out . I know nothing - nothing do I know - but I go to free myself from the Wheel of Things by a broad and open road . '
3939	3997	3932	3932	He	813	' As a pilgrim to the Holy Places I acquire merit . But there is more . Listen to a true thing . When our gracious Lord , being as yet a youth , sought a mate , men said , in His father 's Court , that He was too tender for marriage . Thou knowest ? '
4008	4052	3998	3999	The Curator	813	' So they made the triple trial of strength against all comers . And at the test of the Bow , our Lord first breaking that which they gave Him , called for such a bow as none might bend . Thou knowest ? '
4053	4062	4187	4188	the Curator	813	' It is written . I have read . '
4063	4138	3998	3999	The Curator	813	' And , overshooting all other marks , the arrow passed far and far beyond sight . At the last it fell ; and , where it touched earth , there broke out a stream which presently became a River , whose nature , by our Lord 's beneficence , and that merit He acquired ere He freed himself , is that whoso bathes in it washes away all taint and speckle of sin . '
4139	4145	4147	4148	the Curator	813	' So it is written , '
4174	4185	4187	4188	the Curator	813	' Alas , my brother , I do not know , '
4190	4287	4187	4188	the Curator	813	' Nay , if it please thee to forget - the one thing only that thou hast not told me . Surely thou must know ? See , I am an old man ! I ask with my head between thy feet , O Fountain of Wisdom . We know He drew the bow ! We know the arrow fell ! We know the stream gushed ! Where , then , is the River ? My dream told me to find it . So I came . I am here . But where is the River ? '
4288	4302	4147	4148	the Curator	813	' If I knew , think you I would not cry it aloud ? '
4303	4315	4316	4317	the lama	868	' By it one attains freedom from the Wheel of Things , '
4323	4356	4316	4317	the lama	868	' The River of the Arrow ! Think again ! Some little stream , maybe - dried in the heats ? But the Holy One would never so cheat an old man . '
4357	4368	4369	4370	The lama	868	' I do not know . I do not know . '
4386	4407	4369	4370	The lama	868	' I see thou dost not know . Not being of the Law , the matter is hid from thee . '
4408	4415	4316	4317	the lama	868	' Ay - hidden - hidden . '
4416	4431	4433	4433	he	868	' We are both bound , thou and I , my brother . But I '
4444	4455	4433	4433	he	868	' I go to cut myself free . Come also ! '
4456	4461	4463	4464	the Curator	813	' I am bound , '
4466	4472	4463	4464	the Curator	813	' But whither goest thou ? '
4473	4562	4369	4370	The lama	868	' First to Kashi Benares : where else ? There I shall meet one of the pure faith in a Jain temple of that city . He also is a Seeker in secret , and from him haply I may learn . Maybe he will go with me to Buddh Gaya . Thence north and west to Kapilavastu , and there will I seek for the River . Nay , I will seek everywhere as I go - for the place is not known where the arrow fell . '
4563	4583	4433	4433	he	868	' And how wilt thou go ? It is a far cry to Delhi , and farther to Benares . '
4584	4636	4638	4638	he	912	' By road and the trains . From Pathankot , having left the Hills , I came hither in a te - rain . It goes swiftly . At first I was amazed to see those tall poles by the side of the road snatching up and snatching up their threads , '
4654	4671	4638	4638	he	912	' But later , I was cramped and desired to walk , as I am used . '
4672	4681	4683	4684	the Curator	813	' And thou art sure of thy road ? '
4686	4722	4724	4725	the lama	868	' Oh , for that one but asks a question and pays money , and the appointed persons despatch all to the appointed place . That much I knew in my lamassery from sure report , '
4728	4735	4724	4725	the lama	868	' And when dost thou go ? '
4758	4800	4736	4737	The Curator	813	' As soon as may be . I follow the places of His life till I come to the River of the Arrow . There is , moreover , a written paper of the hours of the trains that go south . '
4801	4806	4736	4737	The Curator	813	' And for food ? '
4830	4918	4919	4919	He	813	' For the journey , I take up the Master 's begging - bowl . Yes . Even as He went so go I , forsaking the ease of my monastery . There was with me when I left the hills a chela disciple who begged for me as the Rule demands , but halting in Kulu awhile a fever took him and he died . I have now no chela , but I will take the alms- bowl and thus enable the charitable to acquire merit . '
4944	4949	4951	4952	the Curator	813	' Be it so , '
4956	5006	4951	4952	the Curator	813	' Suffer me now to acquire merit . We be craftsmen together , thou and I. Here is a new book of white English paper : here be sharpened pencils two and three - thick and thin , all good for a scribe . Now lend me thy spectacles . '
5041	5045	5031	5031	he	813	' Try these . '
5046	5057	5058	5060	The old man	861	' A feather ! A very feather upon the face . '
5071	5085	5062	5062	his	861	' How scarcely do I feel them ! How clearly do I see ! '
5086	5111	5062	5062	his	861	' They be bilaur - crystal - and will never scratch . May they help thee to thy River , for they are thine . '
5112	5127	5129	5130	the lama	868	' I will take them and the pencils and the white note - book , '
5132	5146	5129	5130	the lama	868	' as a sign of friendship between priest and priest - and now - '
5170	5194	5147	5147	He	868	' That is for a memory between thee and me - my pencase . It is something old - even as I am . '
5244	5286	5287	5287	he	868	' When I return , having found the River , I will bring thee a written picture of the Padma Samthora such as I used to make on silk at the lamassery . Yes - and of the Wheel of Life , '
5290	5300	5287	5287	he	868	' for we be craftsmen together , thou and I. '
5480	5488	5490	5491	the policeman	4469	' Do not sit under that gun , '
5494	5499	5501	5501	Kim	344	' Huh ! Owl ! '
5510	5531	5501	5501	Kim	344	' Sit under that gun if it please thee . When didst thou steal the milkwoman 's slippers , Dunnoo ? '
5570	5578	5580	5580	Kim	344	' And whom didst thou worship within ? '
5591	5605	5580	5580	Kim	344	' I worshipped none , child . I bowed before the Excellent Law . '
5621	5628	5614	5614	He	344	' And what dost thou do ? '
5629	5669	5580	5580	Kim	344	' I beg . I remember now it is long since I have eaten or drunk . What is the custom of charity in this town ? In silence , as we do of Tibet , or speaking aloud ? '
5670	5680	5682	5682	Kim	344	' Those who beg in silence starve in silence , '
5723	5752	5712	5712	Kim	344	' Give me the bowl . I know the people of this city - all who are charitable . Give , and I will bring it back filled . '
5765	5775	5776	5776	He	861	' Rest , thou . I know the people . '
5814	5827	5828	5828	she	954	' Oho , hast thou turned yogi with thy begging - bowl ? '
5831	5834	5836	5836	Kim	344	' Nay . '
5839	5858	5836	5836	Kim	344	' There is a new priest in the city - a man such as I have never seen . '
5859	5866	5868	5869	the woman	766	' Old priest - young tiger , '
5872	5905	5868	5869	the woman	766	' I am tired of new priests ! They settle on our wares like flies . Is the father of my son a well of charity to give to all who ask ? '
5906	5909	5911	5911	Kim	344	' No , '
5913	5960	5911	5911	Kim	344	' Thy man is rather yagi bad - tempered than yogi a holy man . But this priest is new . The Sahib in the Wonder House has talked to him like a brother . O my mother , fill me this bowl . He waits . '
5961	6013	6014	6024	The huge , mouse - coloured Brahmini bull of the ward	958	' That bowl indeed ! That cow - bellied basket ! Thou hast as much grace as the holy bull of Shiv . He has taken the best of a basket of onions already , this morn ; and forsooth , I must fill thy bowl . He comes here again . '
6113	6148	6094	6094	He	958	' See ! I have saved more than the bowl will cost thrice over . Now , mother , a little rice and some dried fish atop - yes , and some vegetable curry . '
6165	6172	6174	6175	the woman	766	' He drove away the bull , '
6180	6190	6191	6191	She	766	' It is good to give to the poor . '
6203	6212	6214	6214	Kim	344	' But my yogi is not a cow , '
6230	6254	6214	6214	Kim	344	' A little curry is good , and a fried cake , and a morsel of conserve would please him , I think . '
6255	6266	6268	6269	the woman	766	' It is a hole as big as thy head , '
6323	6351	6316	6316	Kim	344	' That is good . When I am in the bazar the bull shall not come to this house . He is a bold beggar - man . '
6352	6356	6358	6359	the woman	766	' And thou ? '
6361	6434	6358	6359	the woman	766	' But speak well of bulls . Hast thou not told me that some day a Red Bull will come out of a field to help thee ? Now hold all straight and ask for the holy man 's blessing upon me . Perhaps , too , he knows a cure for my daughter 's sore eyes . Ask . him that also , O thou Little Friend of all the World . '
6454	6466	6468	6468	he	344	' Thus do we beg who know the way of it , '
6485	6500	6501	6501	he	344	' Eat now and - I will eat with thee . Ohe , bhisti ! '
6515	6525	6501	6501	he	344	' Give water here . We men are thirsty . '
6526	6530	6532	6533	the bhisti	971	' We men ! '
6537	6558	6559	6559	He	344	' Is one skinful enough for such a pair ? Drink , then , in the name of the Compassionate . '
6592	6597	6598	6598	Kim	344	' Pardesi a foreigner , '
6813	6818	6820	6821	the boy	986	' What is this ? '
6827	6833	6820	6821	the boy	986	' Hast thou been robbed ? '
6834	6856	6789	6800	a Hindu urchin in a dirty turban and Isabella - coloured clothes	985	' It is my new chela disciple that is gone away from me , and I know not where he is . '
6857	6867	6820	6821	the boy	986	' And what like of man was thy disciple ? '
6868	6902	6903	6903	He	868	' It was a boy who came to me in place of him who died , on account of the merit which I had gained when I bowed before the Law within there . '
6909	7004	6903	6903	He	868	' He came upon me to show me a road which I had lost . He led me into the Wonder House , and by his talk emboldened me to speak to the Keeper of the Images , so that I was cheered and made strong . And when I was faint with hunger he begged for me , as would a chela for his teacher . Suddenly was he sent . Suddenly has he gone away . It was in my mind to have taught him the Law upon the road to Benares . '
7047	7077	7024	7026	the old man	861	' But I see now that he was but sent for a purpose . By this I know that I shall find a certain River for which I seek . '
7078	7085	7087	7087	Kim	344	' The River of the Arrow ? '
7094	7101	7103	7104	the lama	868	' Is this yet another Sending ? '
7106	7128	7103	7104	the lama	868	' To none have I spoken of my search , save to the Priest of the Images . Who art thou ? '
7129	7133	7135	7135	Kim	344	' Thy chela , '
7143	7198	7135	7135	Kim	344	' I have never seen anyone like to thee in all this my life . I go with thee to Benares . And , too , I think that so old a man as thou , speaking the truth to chance - met people at dusk , is in great need of a disciple . '
7199	7210	7103	7104	the lama	868	' But the River - the River of the Arrow ? '
7211	7231	7232	7233	The lama	868	' Oh , that I heard when thou wast speaking to the Englishman . I lay against the door . '
7236	7267	7232	7233	The lama	868	' I thought thou hadst been a guide permitted . Such things fall sometimes - but I am not worthy . Thou dost not , then , know the River ? '
7268	7277	7103	7104	the lama	868	' Not I , " Kim laughed uneasily . '
7301	7344	7232	7233	The lama	868	' Boylike , if an acquaintance had a scheme , Kim was quite ready with one of his own ; and , boylike , he had really thought for as much as twenty minutes at a time of his father 's prophecy . '
7350	7355	7356	7356	God	360	' said the lama . '
7365	7462	7361	7362	my father	4451	' . I heard thy talk in the Wonder House of all those new strange places in the Hills , and if one so old and so little - so used to truth - telling - may go out for the small matter of a river , it seemed to me that I too must go a - travelling . If it is our fate to find those things we shall find them - thou , thy River ; and I , my Bull , and the Strong Pillars and some other matters that I forget . '
7463	7478	7480	7481	the lama	868	' It is not pillars but a Wheel from which I would be free , '
7483	7497	7499	7499	Kim	344	' That is all one . Perhaps they will make me a king , '
7506	7519	7520	7521	the lama	868	' I will teach thee other and better desires upon the road , '
7529	7536	7520	7521	the lama	868	' Let us go to Benares . '
7537	7551	7480	7481	the lama	868	' Not by night . Thieves are abroad . Wait till the day . '
7552	7561	7562	7564	The old man	861	' But there is no place to sleep . '
7594	7605	7607	7607	Kim	344	' We shall get good lodging at the Kashmir Serai , '
7614	7623	7607	7607	Kim	344	' I have a friend there . Come ! '
7902	7910	7949	7950	the lama	868	' Lutuf Ullah is gone to Kurdistan . '
7917	7945	7949	7950	the lama	868	' O Allah , who sufferest lice to live on the coat of a Kabuli , why hast thou allowed this louse Lutuf to live so long ? '
8156	8161	8163	8163	Kim	344	' He is here , '
8175	8181	8182	8182	He	344	' Ohe . Mahbub Ali ! '
8252	8277	8278	8279	The lama	868	' Allah ! A lama ! A Red Lama ! It is far from Lahore to the Passes . What dost thou do here ? '
8288	8296	8298	8298	Mahbub	383	' God 's curse on all unbelievers ! '
8300	8343	8298	8298	Mahbub	383	' I do not give to a lousy Tibetan ; but ask my Baltis over yonder behind the camels . They may value your blessings . Oh , horseboys , here is a countryman of yours . See if he be hungry . '
8386	8389	8435	8435	God	360	' fire . '
8392	8415	8435	8435	God	360	' said Kim , pushing him lightly , and the lama strode away , leaving Kim at the edge of the cloister . '
8418	8428	8429	8430	Little Hindu	386	' said Mahbub Ali , returning to his hookah . '
8454	8455	8456	8456	Maharaj	387	' '
8458	8475	8456	8456	Maharaj	387	' whined Kim , using the Hindu form of address , and thoroughly enjoying the situation ; '
8491	8492	8481	8482	my mother	4610	' '
8513	8514	8501	8501	I	0	' '
8526	8546	8547	8552	Little Friend of all the World	4455	' said Kim in English . The trader gave no sign of astonishment , but looked under shaggy eyebrows . '
8554	8558	8547	8552	Little Friend of all the World	4455	' said he , '
8563	8564	8547	8552	Little Friend of all the World	4455	' '
8609	8610	8602	8602	I	0	' '
8623	8631	8615	8615	thou	1055	' The voice was harsh with suspicion . '
8702	8703	8693	8693	I	0	' '
8706	8714	8715	8715	Thou	1055	' said Mahbub Ali , thinking swiftly . '
8733	8734	8724	8725	that lama	1059	' '
8742	8748	8749	8749	We	1060	' said Kim , laughing . '
8754	8772	8773	8774	The boy	986	' said the lama , as soon as he understood the drift of Mahbub Ali 's questions . '
8787	8788	8792	8793	the boy	986	' '
8795	8796	8792	8793	the boy	986	' '
8855	8856	8844	8844	he	986	' '
8861	8862	8844	8844	he	986	' '
8875	8876	8870	8870	he	986	' '
8898	8899	8888	8891	Sikh Hindu - Jain	1071	' '
8947	8954	8955	8955	None	4586	' He wagged his head solemnly . '
8969	8985	8966	8966	my	0	' said Mahbub Ali , and the lama drifted off , soothed by the promise . '
8992	9003	8987	8987	he	986	' said Kim , coming forward to the light again . '
9013	9028	9006	9006	I	0	' Mahbub puffed his hookah in silence . Then he began , almost whispering : '
9044	9045	9006	9006	I	0	' '
9066	9067	9050	9050	I	0	' '
9151	9164	9136	9137	that officer	1079	' Mahbub here described the horse and the appearance of the officer . '
9223	9224	9214	9215	Mahbub Ali	383	' '
9235	9247	9214	9215	Mahbub Ali	383	' said Kim , with a giggle , his eyes aflame . '
9267	9285	9286	9286	Allah	382	' A shadow passed behind Kim , and a feeding camel . Mahbub Ali raised his voice . '
9319	9343	9354	9354	thou	1077	' He turned as feeling on the floor beside him and tossed a flap of soft , greasy Mussalman bread to the boy . '
9366	9608	9360	9360	I	0	' Kim slunk away , his teeth in the bread , and , as he expected , he found a small wad of folded tissue - paper wrapped in oilskin , with three silver rupees - enormous largesse . He smiled and thrust money and paper into his leather amulet - case . The lama , sumptuously fed by Mahbub 's Baltis , was already asleep in a corner of one of the stalls . Kim lay down beside him and laughed . He knew he had rendered a service to Mahbub Ali , and not for one little minute did he believe the tale of the stallion 's pedigree . But Kim did not suspect that Mahbub Ali , known as one of the best horse - dealers in the Punjab , a wealthy and enterprising trader , whose caravans penetrated far and far into the Back of Beyond , was registered in one of the locked books of the Indian Survey Department as C25 IB . Twice or thrice yearly C25 would send in a little story , baldly told but most interesting , and generally - it was checked by the statements of R17 and M4 - quite true . It concerned all manner of out - of - the - way mountain principalities , explorers of nationalities other than English , and the guntrade - was , in brief , a small portion of that vast mass of '
9611	9659	9356	9357	the lama	868	' on which the Indian Government acts . But , recently , five confederated Kings , who had no business to confederate , had been informed by a kindly Northern Power that there was a leakage of news from their territories into British India . So those Kings '
10086	10108	10069	10070	The public	1108	' Creighton , Laurel Bank , Umballa . Horse is Arabian as already advised . Sorrowful delayed pedigree which am translating . '
10116	10125	10069	10070	The public	1108	' Much sorrowful delay . Will forward pedigree . '
10136	10151	10133	10133	he	383	' Lutuf Ullah . Have wired two thousand rupees your credit Luchman Narain 's bank- '
10735	10740	10742	10743	the Flower	395	' And I think . '
10757	10800	10742	10743	the Flower	395	' that he is no more than a pig of an Afghan horse - dealer , with no thought except women and horses . Moreover , he may have sent it away by now - if ever there were such a thing . '
10801	10818	10820	10821	the pundit	1141	' Nay - in a matter touching Five Kings it would be next his black heart , '
10823	10828	10820	10821	the pundit	1141	' Was there nothing ? '
10841	10870	10835	10835	his	1144	' I searched between the soles of his slippers as the Flower searched his clothes . This is not the man but another . I leave little unseen . '
10871	10882	10884	10885	the pundit	1141	' They did not say he was the very man , '
10888	10907	10884	10885	the pundit	1141	' They said , " Look if he be the man , since our counsels are troubled . " '
10908	10947	10949	10950	the Flower	395	' That North country is full of horse - dealers as an old coat of lice . There is Sikandar Khan , Nur Ali Beg , and Farrukh Shah all heads of kafilas caravans - who deal there , '
10952	10960	10962	10963	the pundit	1141	' They have not yet come in , '
10965	10972	10962	10963	the pundit	1141	' Thou must ensnare them later . '
10975	10991	10992	10992	I	0	' said the Flower with deep disgust , rolling Mahbub 's head from her lap . '
11029	11085	11021	11022	This swine	1148	' When Mahbub woke , the Flower talked to him severely on the sin of drunkenness . Asiatics do not wink when they have outmanoeuvred an enemy , but as Mahbub Ali cleared his throat , tightened his belt , and staggered forth under the early morning stars , he came very near to it . '
11092	11098	11087	11088	a colt	1149	' said he to himself . '
11111	11178	11179	11179	He	1151	' twas prettily done . Now God He knows how many more there be upon the Road who have orders to test me - perhaps with the knife . So it stands that the boy must go to Umballa - and by rail - for the writing is something urgent . I abide here , following the Flower and drinking wine as an Afghan coper should . '
11209	11212	11213	11213	He	1151	' Up ! '
11218	11238	11213	11213	He	1151	' Whither went those who lay here last even - the lama and the boy ? Is aught missing ? '
11239	11242	11244	11245	the man	4471	' Nay , '
11247	11270	11244	11245	the man	4471	' the old madman rose at second cockcrow saying he would go to Benares , and the young one led him away . '
11271	11280	11282	11282	Mahbub	383	' The curse of Allah on all unbelievers ! '
11425	11440	11442	11442	he	344	' It must be the pedigree of that made - up horse - lie , '
11444	11495	11442	11442	he	344	' the thing that I carry to Umballa . Better that we go now . Those who search bags with knives may presently search bellies with knives . Surely there is a woman behind this . Hai ! Hai ! in a whisper to the light - sleeping old man . '
11508	11592	11409	11409	he	344	' The lama rose obediently , and they passed out of the serai like shadows . Chapter 2 And whoso will , from Pride released ; Contemning neither creed nor priest , May feel the Soul of all the East . About him at Kamakura . Buddha at Kamakura . They entered the fort - like railway station , black in the end of night ; the electrics sizzling over the goods - yard where they handle the heavy Northern grain - traffic . '
11600	11683	11409	11409	he	344	' said the lama , recoiling from the hollow echoing darkness , the glimmer of rails between the masonry platforms , and the maze of girders above . He stood in a gigantic stone hall paved , it seemed , with the sheeted dead third - class passengers who had taken their tickets overnight and were sleeping in the waiting - rooms . All hours of the twenty - four are alike to Orientals , and their passenger traffic is regulated accordingly . '
11698	11708	11693	11693	One	1164	' - Kim pointed to the ticket - office - '
11721	11722	11693	11693	One	1164	' '
11729	11734	11693	11693	One	1164	' he replied petulantly . '
11746	11747	11743	11743	she	1164	' '
11753	11823	11743	11743	she	1164	' The lama , not so well used to trains as he had pretended , started as the 3.25 a.m. south - bound roared in . The sleepers sprang to life , and the station filled with clamour and shoutings , cries of water and sweetmeat vendors , shouts of native policemen , and shrill yells of women gathering up their baskets , their families , and their husbands . '
11843	11891	11743	11743	she	1164	' Amazed at the lama 's immense simplicity he had handed him a small bag full of rupees , Kim asked and paid for a ticket to Umballa . A sleepy clerk grunted and flung out a ticket to the next station , just six miles distant . '
11894	11904	11743	11743	she	1164	' said Kim , scanning it with a grin . '
11934	11944	11948	11948	Amritzar	401	' The Babu scowled and dealt the proper ticket . '
11950	11975	11948	11948	Amritzar	401	' said Kim , who had no notion of spending Mahbub Ali 's money on anything so crude as a paid ride to Umballa . '
12011	12021	12008	12008	thou	1171	' he went on merrily to the bewildered lama . '
12040	12085	12110	12110	he	1173	' He returned the money , keeping only one anna in each rupee of the price of the Umballa ticket as his commission - the immemorial commission of Asia . The lama jibbed at the open door of a crowded third - class carriage . '
12093	12108	12110	12110	he	1173	' said he weakly . A burly Sikh artisan thrust forth his bearded head . '

12174	12222	12145	12145	I	0	' shrilled the wife of a well - to - do cultivator - a Hindu Jat from the rich Jullundur , district . Our night trains are not as well looked after as the day ones , where the sexes are very strictly kept to separate carriages . '
12235	12241	12225	12228	mother of my son	1176	' said the blueturbaned husband . '
12256	12257	12249	12251	a holy man	4605	' '
12285	12304	12225	12228	mother of my son	1176	' She looked round for approval . An Amritzar courtesan near the window sniffed behind her head drapery . '
12309	12335	12225	12228	mother of my son	1176	' cried a fat Hindu money - lender , his folded account - book in a cloth under his arm . With an oily smirk : '
12346	12347	12225	12228	mother of my son	1176	' '
12364	12380	12225	12228	mother of my son	1176	' said a young Dogra soldier going south on leave ; and they all laughed . '
12387	12392	12469	12469	I	0	' said the lama . '
12408	12412	12469	12469	I	0	' cried Kim . '

12674	12692	12658	12658	He	0	' For the lama , constrained by his Rule , took not the faintest notice of her . '

12706	12712	12704	12704	mother	4505	' said Kim most promptly . '

12736	12743	12731	12732	A beggar	1196	' said the Sikh , laughing . '
12753	12762	12744	12744	Thou	1197	' Kim 's hands were crooked in supplication . '
12768	12785	12766	12766	thou	1197	' said the woman , handing him the half of a cake from a greasy package . '
12790	12791	12766	12766	thou	1197	' '
12795	12801	12792	12793	Jugglers belike	1200	' the young soldier suggested . '

12950	12985	12987	12987	she	1210	' Nay , but all who serve the Sirkar with weapons in their hands are , as it were , one brotherhood . There is one brotherhood of the caste , but beyond that again '

13189	13248	13184	13184	they	1214	' said the banker , fumbling at his belt . The lamps were paling in the dawn when the half - caste guard came round . Ticket - collecting is a slow business in the East , where people secrete their tickets in all sorts of curious places . Kim produced his and was told to get out . '

All the carriage bade the guard be merciful - the banker was specially eloquent here - but the guard hauled Kim on to the platform . The lama blinked - he could not overtake the situation and Kim lifted up his voice and wept outside the carriage window . '

13565	13566	13552	13552	he	4622	' '
13603	13604	13598	13598	him	4622	' '
13609	13613	13598	13598	him	4622	' shrilled Kim . '
13646	13687	13640	13640	I	0	' The girl looked up at the lama , who had mechanically followed Kim to the platform . He bowed his head that he might not see her , and muttered in Tibetan as she passed on with the crowd . '
13694	13702	13703	13703	She	1238	' said the cultivator 's wife viciously . '
13708	13713	13718	13719	a nun	1239	' returned the lama . '
13721	13722	13718	13719	a nun	1239	' '
13748	13753	13735	13736	old man	1240	' cried the banker . '
13770	13779	13718	13719	a nun	1239	' said Kim , leaping to his place . '
13791	13839	13783	13784	Holy One	385	' Golden , rose , saffron , and pink , the morning mists smoked away across the flat green levels . All the rich Punjab lay out in the splendour of the keen sun . The lama flinched a little as the telegraph - posts swung by . '
13850	13860	13783	13784	Holy One	385	' said the banker , with a patronizing grin . '
13883	13884	13987	13987	ye	1243	' '
13893	13983	13987	13987	ye	1243	' said the lama wearily , mumbling over the cakes that Kim offered . They all unloosed their bundles and made their morning meal . Then the banker , the cultivator , and the soldier prepared their pipes and wrapped the compartment in choking , acrid smoke , spitting and coughing and enjoying themselves . The Sikh and the cultivator 's wife chewed pan ; the lama took snuff and told his beads , while Kim , cross - legged , smiled over the comfort of a full stomach . '
13991	14004	14005	14005	We	1243	' said the lama of a sudden to the carriage at large . '
14009	14021	14007	14007	Gunga	410	' returned the banker , when the little titter had subsided . '
14025	14026	14007	14007	Gunga	410	' '
14032	14033	14030	14030	Gunga	410	' '
14050	14051	14054	14054	Gunga	410	' '
14077	14083	14071	14071	I	0	' He looked round proudly . '
14088	14098	14071	14071	I	0	' said the young sepoy drily , and the travellers '
14105	14115	14116	14117	the lama	868	' Clean - to return again to the Gods , '
14120	14138	14116	14117	the lama	868	' And to go forth on the round of lives anew - still tied to the Wheel . '
14145	14163	14141	14141	his	868	' But maybe there is a mistake . Who , then , made Gunga in the beginning ? '
14164	14175	14176	14177	the banker	1207	' The Gods . Of what known faith art thou ? '
14182	14209	14176	14177	the banker	1207	' I follow the Law - the Most Excellent Law . So it was the Gods that made Gunga . What like of Gods were they ? '
14229	14237	14239	14242	the money - lender	4771	' What - what is thy God ? '
14246	14249	14251	14252	the lama	868	' Hear ! '
14261	14278	14279	14279	He	868	' Hear : for I speak of Him now ! O people of Hind , listen ! '
14370	14373	14375	14380	the soldier of the Ludhiana Sikhs	1257	' Um ! '
14382	14441	14375	14380	the soldier of the Ludhiana Sikhs	1257	' There was a Mohammedan regiment lay next to us at the Pirzai Kotal , and a priest of theirs - he was , as I remember , a naik - when the fit was on him , spake prophecies . But the mad all are in God 's keeping . His officers overlooked much in that man . '
14458	14473	14474	14474	he	868	' Hear the tale of the Arrow which our Lord loosed from the bow , '
14494	14528	14474	14474	he	868	' Now , O people of Hind , I go to seek that River . Know ye aught that may guide me , for we be all men and women in evil case . '
14529	14543	14474	14474	he	868	' There is Gunga - and Gunga alone - who washes away sin . '
14551	14563	14565	14568	the cultivator 's wife	1210	' Though past question we have good Gods Jullundur - way , '
14576	14585	14565	14568	the cultivator 's wife	1210	' See how they have blessed the crops . '
14586	14599	14601	14602	her husband	1264	' To search every river in the Punjab is no small matter , '
14604	14632	14633	14633	He	1264	' For me , a stream that leaves good silt on my land suffices , and I thank Bhumia , the God of the Home - stead . '
14641	14651	14653	14654	the lama	868	' Think you our Lord came so far North ? '
14660	14665	14666	14666	Kim	344	' It may be , '
14681	14689	14691	14692	the Sikh	4777	' The last of the Great Ones , '
14696	14739	14691	14692	the Sikh	4777	' was Sikander Julkarn Alexander the Great . He paved the streets of Jullundur and built a great tank near Umballa . That pavement holds to this day ; and the tank is there also . I never heard of thy God . '
14740	14750	14752	14754	the young soldier	4779	' Let thy hair grow long and talk Punjabi , '
14764	14773	14752	14754	the young soldier	4779	' That is all that makes a Sikh . '
14809	14820	14775	14775	he	4779	' Om mane pudme hum ! Om mane pudme hum ! '
14832	14837	14838	14838	he	868	' It irks me , '
14843	14869	14838	14838	he	868	' The speed and the clatter irk me . Moreover , my chela , I think that maybe we have over - passed that River . '
14870	14875	14877	14877	Kim	344	' Peace , peace , '
14879	14895	14877	14877	Kim	344	' Was not the River near Benares ? We are yet far from the place . '
14896	14920	14775	14775	he	4779	' But - if our Lord came North , it may be any one of these little ones that we have run across . '
14921	14927	14775	14775	he	4779	' I do not know . '
14928	14972	14877	14877	Kim	344	' But thou wast sent to me - wast thou sent to me ? - for the merit I had acquired over yonder at Such - zen . From beside the cannon didst thou come - bearing two faces - and two garbs . '
14973	14985	14987	14987	Kim	344	' Peace . One must not speak of these things here , '
14989	15017	14987	14987	Kim	344	' There was but one of me . Think again and thou wilt remember . A boy - a Hindu boy - by the great green cannon . '
15018	15048	14877	14877	Kim	344	' But was there not also an Englishman with a white beard holy among images - who himself made more sure my assurance of the River of the Arrow ? '
15049	15069	15070	15070	Kim	344	' He - we - went to the Ajaib - Gher in Lahore to pray before the Gods there , '
15078	15123	15070	15070	Kim	344	' And the Sahib of the Wonder House talked to him - yes , this is truth as a brother . He is a very holy man , from far beyond the Hills . Rest , thou . In time we come to Umballa . '
15124	15135	14877	14877	Kim	344	' But my River - the River of my healing ? '
15136	15172	15070	15070	Kim	344	' And then , if it please thee , we will go hunting for that River on foot . So that we miss nothing - not even a little rivulet in a field - side . '
15173	15183	15184	15185	The lama	868	' But thou hast a Search of thine own ? '
15199	15202	15204	15204	Kim	344	' Ay , '
15231	15268	15299	15300	The cultivator	4769	' It was a bull - a Red Bull that shall come and help thee and carry thee - whither ? I have forgotten . A Red Bull on a green field , was it not ? '
15269	15278	15280	15280	Kim	344	' Nay , it will carry me nowhere , '
15282	15292	15280	15280	Kim	344	' It is but a tale I told thee . '
15293	15298	15299	15300	The cultivator	4769	' What is this ? '
15313	15374	15306	15306	her	1210	' Do ye both dream dreams ? A Red Bull on a green field , that shall carry thee to the heavens or what ? Was it a vision ? Did one make a prophecy ? We have a Red Bull in our village behind Jullundur city , and he grazes by choice in the very greenest of our fields ! '
15375	15394	15396	15396	they	1278	' Give a woman an old wife 's tale and a weaver - bird a leaf and a thread '
15402	15407	15396	15396	they	1278	' said the Sikh . '
15425	15426	15396	15396	they	1278	' '
15438	15443	15396	15396	they	1278	' the lama repeated . '
15465	15466	15457	15458	the Bull	4617	' '
15511	15512	15522	15522	he	4617	' '
15530	15548	15522	15522	he	4617	' said the lama , hopefully as a child . Then to the company , indicating Kim : '
15569	15570	15558	15558	He	1289	' '
15593	15645	15589	15591	such a disciple	1294	' said the woman . Her husband touched his forehead lightly with one finger and smiled . But the next time the lama would eat they took care to give him of their best . And at last - tired , sleepy , and dusty - they reached Umballa City Station . '
15655	15664	15665	15665	We	1295	' said the cultivator 's wife to Kim . '
15699	15700	15693	15693	he	1299	' '
15741	15750	15705	15711	A woman with a heart of gold	1301	' The lama bowed his head in benediction . '
15763	15776	15705	15711	A woman with a heart of gold	1301	' the husband began , as he shouldered his heavy bamboo staff . '
15797	15803	15805	15805	him	1308	' said the woman crisply . '
15822	15823	15813	15814	The yogi	1310	' '
15831	15865	15826	15826	I	0	' said Kim , anxious only to get the lama under shelter for the night , that he might seek Mahbub Ali 's Englishman and deliver himself of the white stallion 's pedigree . '
15868	15893	15894	15894	I	0	' said he , when the lama had come to an anchor in the inner courtyard of a decent Hindu house behind the cantonments , '
15919	15920	15921	15921	Thou	1312	' '
15930	15939	15925	15925	Thou	1312	' The old man caught at his wrist . '
15961	15962	15925	15925	Thou	1312	' '
15988	15989	16183	16184	Mahbub Ali	383	' '
16008	16158	16159	16162	Protector of the Poor	1316	' Kim stole out and away , as unremarkable a figure as ever carried his own and a few score thousand other folk 's fate slung round his neck . Mahbub Ali 's directions left him little doubt of the house in which his Englishman lived ; and a groom , bringing a dog- cart home from the Club , made him quite sure . It remained only to identify his man , and Kim slipped through the garden hedge and hid in a clump of plumed grass close to the veranda . The house blazed with lights , and servants moved about tables dressed with flowers , glass , and silver . Presently forth came an Englishman , dressed in black and white , humming a tune . It was too dark to see his face , so Kim , beggar - wise , tried an old experiment . '
16164	16172	16173	16174	Mahbub Ali	383	' The man backed towards the voice . '
16177	16178	16173	16174	Mahbub Ali	383	' '
16186	16205	16183	16184	Mahbub Ali	383	' He made no attempt to look for the speaker , and that showed Kim that he knew . '
16216	16217	16209	16211	the white stallion	1081	' '
16223	16239	16240	16241	Mahbub Ali	383	' The Englishman switched at the rose - hedge in the side of the drive . '
16248	16455	16240	16241	Mahbub Ali	383	' Kim flipped the wad of folded paper into the air , and it fell in the path beside the man , who put his foot on it as a gardener came round the corner . When the servant passed he picked it up , dropped a rupee - Kim could hear the clink - and strode into the house , never turning round . Swiftly Kim took up the money ; but for all his training , he was Irish enough by birth to reckon silver the least part of any game . What he desired was the visible effect of action ; so , instead of slinking away , he lay close in the grass and wormed nearer to the house . He saw - Indian bungalows are open through and through - the Englishman return to a small dressing - room , in a comer of the veranda , that was half office , littered with papers and despatch- boxes , and sit down to study Mahbub Ali 's message . His face , by the full ray of the kerosene lamp , changed and darkened , and Kim , used as every beggar must be to watching countenances , took good note . '
16462	16469	16460	16460	dear	1319	' called a woman 's voice . '
16488	16495	16480	16480	They	1321	' The man still read intently . '
16498	16507	16508	16508	He	1322	' said the voice , five minutes later . '
16521	16590	16515	16516	the troopers	1323	' The man dashed out bareheaded as a big landau with four native troopers behind it halted at the veranda , and a tall , black haired man , erect as an arrow , swung out , preceded by a young officer who laughed pleasantly . Flat on his belly lay Kim , almost touching the high wheels . His man and the black stranger exchanged two sentences . '
16595	16602	16593	16593	sir	1325	' said the young officer promptly . '
16611	16612	16613	16613	We	1326	' '
16622	16628	16629	16629	You	1325	' said Kim 's man . '
16635	16642	16613	16613	We	1326	'em amused , and all that . '
16643	16652	16654	16656	the tall man	1327	' Tell one of the troopers to wait , '
16701	16720	16722	16723	the elder	1330	' It is n't a question of weeks . It is a question of days - hours almost , '
16725	16737	16739	16739	he	1325	' I 'd been expecting it for some time , but this '
16746	16762	16739	16739	he	1325	' clinches it . Grogan 's dining here to - night , is n't he ? '
16763	16772	16739	16739	he	1325	' Yes , sir , and Macklin too . '
16773	16853	16739	16739	he	1325	' Very good . I 'll speak to them myself . The matter will be referred to the Council , of course , but this is a case where one is justified in assuming that we take action at once . Warn the Pined and Peshawar brigades . It will disorganize all the summer reliefs , but we ca n't help that . This comes of not smashing them thoroughly the first time . Eight thousand should be enough . '
16854	16861	16739	16739	he	1325	' What about artillery , sir ? '
16862	16868	16739	16739	he	1325	' I must consult Macklin . '
16869	16875	16739	16739	he	1325	' Then it means war ? '
16876	16893	16739	16739	he	1325	' No . Punishment . When a man is bound by the action of his predecessor - '
16894	16901	16739	16739	he	1325	' But C25 may have lied . '
16902	16998	16739	16739	he	1325	' He bears out the other 's information . Practically , they showed their hand six months back . But Devenish would have it there was a chance of peace . Of course they used it to make themselves stronger . Send off those telegrams at once - the new code , not the old - mine and Wharton 's . I do n't think we need keep the ladies waiting any longer . We can settle the rest over the cigars . I thought it was coming . It 's punishment - not war . '
17047	17050	17052	17052	Kim	344	' Aie , '
17057	17070	17052	17052	Kim	344	' I came only to wash dishes in return for a bellyful . '
17071	17110	17041	17045	one of whom kicked him	1335	' All Umballa is on the same errand . Get hence . They go in now with the soup . Think you that we who serve Creighton Sahib need strange scullions to help us through a big dinner ? '
17111	17119	17121	17121	Kim	344	' It is a very big dinner , '
17128	17153	17121	17121	Kim	344	' Small wonder . The guest of honour is none other than the Jang - i- Lat Sahib the Commander - in - Chief . '
17154	17157	17159	17159	Kim	344	' Ho ! '
17185	17191	17193	17193	he	344	' And all that trouble , '
17203	17285	17193	17193	he	344	' for a horse 's pedigree ! Mahbub Ali should have come to me to learn a little lying . Every time before that I have borne a message it concerned a woman . Now it is men . Better . The tall man said that they will loose a great army to punish someone - somewhere - the news goes to Pindi and Peshawur . There are also guns . Would I had crept nearer . It is big news ! '
17520	17528	17517	17517	he	868	' I rose up to seek enlightenment . '
17644	17652	17654	17655	the cultivator	4769	' How thinkest thou of this one ? '
17661	17686	17654	17655	the cultivator	4769	' A holy man - a holy man indeed . His Gods are not the Gods , but his feet are upon the Way , '
17691	17709	17654	17655	the cultivator	4769	' And his methods of nativities , though that is beyond thee , are wise and sure . '
17710	17714	17716	17716	Kim	344	' Tell me , '
17719	17736	17716	17716	Kim	344	' whether I find my Red Bull on a green field , as was promised me . '
17737	17748	17749	17750	the priest	1044	' What knowledge hast thou of thy birth - hour ? '
17757	17769	17749	17750	the priest	1044	' Between first and second cockcrow of the first night in May. '
17770	17775	17716	17716	Kim	344	' Of what year ? '
17776	17801	17749	17750	the priest	1044	' I do not know ; but upon the hour that I cried first fell the great earthquake in Srinagar which is in Kashmir . '
17840	17843	17845	17846	a woman	1192	' Ai ! '
17871	17872	17863	17867	such an one 's daughter	1372	' '
17888	17903	17874	17875	her mother	1374	' cried the cultivator 's wife , sitting outside the circle in the shadow . '
17910	17916	17874	17875	her mother	1374	' said the family priest , '
17929	17941	17923	17923	their	1377	' He began to draw in the dust of the courtyard . '
17963	17964	17960	17960	thy	1379	' '
17969	17981	17960	17960	thy	1379	' said Kim , delighted at the sensation he was creating , '
18010	18011	18003	18008	two men making all things ready	1383	' '
18093	18150	18090	18091	little one	1389	' He knitted his brows , scratched , smoothed out , and scratched again in the dust mysterious signs - to the wonder of all save the lama , who , with fine instinct , forbore to interfere . At the end of half an hour , he tossed the twig from him with a grunt . '
18192	18193	18197	18214	a man of the Ludhiana Sikhs in the carriage from Lahore , ' said the cultivator 's wife	4977	' '
18209	18217	18218	18218	Tck	428	' said the cultivator 's wife hopefully . '
18233	18240	18220	18221	Armed men	1391	' said the priest to Kim . '
18257	18258	18220	18221	Armed men	1391	' '
18263	18269	18220	18221	Armed men	1391	' said the lama earnestly . '
18278	18311	18220	18221	Armed men	1391	' Kim smiled , remembering what he had overheard in the dressing- room . Decidedly he was a favourite of the stars . The priest brushed his foot over the rude horoscope . '
18331	18332	18334	18334	my	0	' '
18340	18345	18346	18346	I	0	' pleaded the lama . '

18383	18436	18368	18369	my brother	4548	' Next morning , though they were pressed to stay , the lama insisted on departure . They gave Kim a large bundle of good food and nearly three annas in copper money for the needs of the road , and with many blessings watched the two go southward in the dawn . '

18497	18518	18368	18369	my brother	4548	' said the lama , and he led from the white road across the fields ; walking into a very hornets '
18595	18600	18602	18603	the lama	868	' Such an one , '
18609	18630	18602	18603	the lama	868	' is impolite to strangers , intemperate of speech and uncharitable . Be warned by his demeanour , my disciple . '
18631	18637	18639	18640	the farmer	1409	' Ho , shameless beggars ! '
18642	18648	18639	18640	the farmer	1409	' Begone ! Get hence ! '
18649	18653	18654	18655	the lama	868	' We go , '
18662	18670	18654	18655	the lama	868	' We go from these unblessed fields . '
18671	18674	18676	18676	Kim	344	' Ah , '
18683	18698	18680	18680	his	344	' If the next crops fail , thou canst only blame thine own tongue . '
18707	18715	18716	18716	he	4471	' The land is full of beggars , '
18722	18740	18742	18742	Kim	344	' And by what sign didst thou know that we would beg from thee , O Mali ? '
18756	18771	18742	18742	Kim	344	' All we sought was to look at that river beyond the field there . '
18772	18777	18778	18779	the man	4471	' River , forsooth ! '
18782	18840	18778	18779	the man	4471	' What city do ye hail from not to know a canal - cut ? It runs as straight as an arrow , and I pay for the water as though it were molten silver . There is a branch of a river beyond . But if ye need water I can give that - and milk . '
18841	18851	18853	18854	the lama	868	' Nay , we will go to the river , '
18859	18865	18866	18867	the man	4471	' Milk and a meal . '
18879	18904	18871	18871	he	4471	' I - I would not draw evil upon myself - or my crops . But beggars are so many in these hard days . '
18905	18909	18910	18911	The lama	868	' Take notice . '
18916	18962	18910	18911	The lama	868	' He was led to speak harshly by the Red Mist of anger . That clearing from his eyes , he becomes courteous and of an affable heart . May his fields be blessed ! Beware not to judge men too hastily , O farmer . '
18963	18979	18981	18981	Kim	344	' I have met holy ones who would have cursed thee from hearthstone to byre , '
18987	19000	19001	19001	He	1418	' Is he not wise and holy ? I am his disciple . '
19021	19027	19029	19030	the lama	868	' There is no pride , '
19036	19049	19029	19030	the lama	868	' there is no pride among such as follow the Middle Way . '
19050	19063	19029	19030	the lama	868	' But thou hast said he was low - caste and discourteous . '
19064	19119	19120	19120	He	1418	' Low - caste I did not say , for how can that be which is not ? Afterwards he amended his discourtesy , and I forgot the offence . Moreover , he is as we are , bound upon the Wheel of Things ; but he does not tread the way of deliverance . '
19138	19148	19150	19150	Kim	344	' Now , how wilt thou know thy River ? '
19163	19213	19150	19150	Kim	344	' When I find it , an enlightenment will surely be given . This , I feel , is not the place . O littlest among the waters , if only thou couldst tell me where runs my River ! But be thou blessed to make the fields bear ! '
19214	19219	19220	19220	Kim	344	' Look ! Look ! '
19269	19280	19282	19282	Kim	344	' I have no stick - I have no stick , '
19284	19295	19282	19282	Kim	344	' 1 will get me one and break his back . '
19296	19333	19387	19388	the lama	868	' Why ? He is upon the Wheel as we are - a life ascending or descending - very far from deliverance . Great evil must the soul have done that is cast into this shape . '
19334	19340	19342	19342	Kim	344	' I hate all snakes , '
19358	19366	19387	19388	the lama	868	' Let him live out his life . '
19377	19386	19387	19388	the lama	868	' May thy release come soon , brother ! '
19392	19404	19387	19388	the lama	868	' Hast thou knowledge , by chance , of my River ? '
19405	19417	19418	19418	Kim	344	' Never have I seen such a man as thou art , '
19423	19432	19418	19418	Kim	344	' Do the very snakes understand thy talk ? '
19433	19437	19438	19438	He	344	' Who knows ? '
19458	19463	19464	19464	he	868	' Come , thou ! '
19470	19474	19476	19476	Kim	344	' Not I , '

19493	19535	19488	19488	He	1427	' Kim hesitated for a moment . The lama backed his order by some droned Chinese quotation which Kim took for a charm . He obeyed and bounded across the rivulet , and the snake , indeed , made no sign . '
19544	19553	19540	19542	such a man	842	' Kim wiped the sweat from his forehead . '

They sought a River : a River of miraculous healing . Had any one knowledge of such a stream ? Sometimes men laughed , but more often heard the story out to the end and offered them a place in the shade , a drink of milk , and a meal . The women were always kind , and the little children as children are the world over , alternately shy and venturesome . Evening found them at rest under the village tree of a mud - walled , mud - roofed hamlet , talking to the headman as the cattle came in from the grazing - grounds and the women prepared the day 's last meal . They had passed beyond the belt of market - gardens round hungry Umballa , and were among the mile - wide green of the staple crops . He was a white - bearded and affable elder , used to entertaining strangers . He dragged out a string bedstead for the lama , set warm cooked food before him , prepared him a pipe , and , the evening ceremonies being finished in the village temple , sent for the village priest . Kim told the older children tales of the size and beauty of Lahore , of railway travel , and such - like city things , while the men talked , slowly as their cattle chew the cud . '

20243	20289	20291	20291	thou	1443	' A deep , sing - song Chinese half - chant closed the sentence . Even the priest was impressed , and the headman feared an evil spell : but none could look at the lama 's simple , eager face and doubt him long . '

20605	20645	20569	20569	he	1458	' he replied pompously . Somebody laughed at the little tattered figure strutting on the brickwork plinth under the great tree . Where a native would have lain down , Kim 's white blood set him upon his feet . '

English officials - Deputy Commissioners even - turned aside from the main road to visit him , and on those occasions he dressed himself in the uniform of ancient days , and stood up like a ramrod .

There was a drowsy buzz of small life in hot sunshine , a cooing of doves , and a sleepy drone of well - wheels across the fields . Slowly and impressively the lama began . At the end of ten minutes the old soldier slid from his pony , to hear better as he said , and sat with the reins round his wrist . The lama 's voice faltered , the periods lengthened . Kim was busy watching a grey squirrel . When the little scolding bunch of fur , close pressed to the branch , disappeared , preacher and audience were fast asleep , the old officer 's strong - cut head pillowed on his arm , the lama 's thrown back against the tree - bole , where it showed like yellow ivory . A naked child toddled up , stared , and , moved by some quick impulse of reverence , made a solemn little obeisance before the lama - only the child was so short and fat that it toppled over sideways , and Kim laughed at the sprawling , chubby legs . The child , scared and indignant , yelled aloud . '

27345	27473	27311	27311	I	0	' muttered the lama , and to the click of his rosary they walked in silence mile upon mile . The lama as usual , was deep in meditation , but Kim 's bright eyes were open wide . This broad , smiling river of life , he considered , was a vast improvement on the cramped and crowded Lahore streets . There were new people and new sights at every stride - castes he knew and castes that were altogether out of his experience . They met a troop of long - haired , strong - scented Sansis with baskets of lizards and other unclean food on their backs , their lean dogs sniffing at their heels . These people kept their own side of the road '

The lama never raised his eyes . He did not note the money - lender on his goose - rumped pony , hastening along to collect the cruel interest ; or the long - shouting , deep - voiced little mob -still in military formation - of native soldiers on leave , rejoicing to be rid of their breeches and puttees , and saying the most outrageous things to the most respectable women in sight . Even the seller of Ganges - water he did not see , and Kim expected that he would at least buy a bottle of that precious stuff . He looked steadily at the ground , and strode as steadily hour after hour , his soul busied elsewhere . But Kim was in the seventh heaven of joy . The Grand Trunk at this point was built on an embankment to guard against winter floods from the foothills , so that one walked , as it were , a little above the country , along a stately corridor , seeing all India spread out to left and right . It was beautiful to behold the many - yoked grain and cotton wagons crawling over the country roads : one could hear their axles , complaining a mile away , coming nearer , till with shouts and yells and bad words they climbed up the steep incline and plunged on to the hard main road , carter reviling carter . It was equally beautiful to watch the people , little clumps of red and blue and pink and white and saffron , turning aside to go to their own villages , dispersing and growing small by twos and threes across the level plain . Kim felt these things , though he could not give tongue to his feelings , and so contented himself with buying peeled sugar - cane and spitting the pith generously about his path . From time to time the lama took snuff , and at last Kim could endure the silence no longer . '

A line of stalls selling very simple food and tobacco , a stack of firewood , a police - station , a well , a horse - trough , a few trees , and , under them , some trampled ground dotted with the black ashes of old fires , are all that mark a parao on the Grand Trunk ; if you except the beggars and the crows - both hungry . By this time the sun was driving broad golden spokes through the lower branches of the mango - trees ; the parakeets and doves were coming . home in their hundreds ; the chattering , grey - backed Seven Sisters , talking over the day 's adventures , walked back and forth in twos and threes almost under the feet of the travellers ; and shufflings and scufflings in the branches showed that the bats were ready to go out on the night - picket . Swiftly the light gathered itself together , painted for an instant the faces and the cartwheels and the bullocks '

30459	30517	30345	30345	Kim	344	' From behind the snows - from a very far place . He knows the stars ; he makes horoscopes ; he reads nativities . But he does not do this for money . He does it for kindness and great charity . I am his disciple . I am called also the Friend of the Stars . '
30518	30524	30382	30388	the flat thin voice behind the curtain	1871	' Thou art no hillman . '
30525	30550	30345	30345	Kim	344	' Ask him . He will tell thee I was sent to him from the Stars to show him an end to his pilgrimage . '
30551	30626	30345	30345	Kim	344	' Humph ! Consider , brat , that I am an old woman and not altogether a fool . Lamas I know , and to these I give reverence , but thou art no more a lawful chela than this my finger is the pole of this wagon . Thou art a casteless Hindu - a bold and unblushing beggar , attached , belike , to the Holy One for the sake of gain . '
30627	30636	30637	30637	Kim	344	' Do we not all work for gain ? '
30648	30652	30637	30637	Kim	344	' I have heard '
30663	30668	30637	30637	Kim	344	' I have heard - '
30669	30675	30676	30676	she	1873	' What hast thou heard ? '
30684	30712	30676	30676	she	1873	' Nothing that I well remember , but some talk in the bazars , which is doubtless a lie , that even Rajahs - small Hill Rajahs - '
30713	30723	30637	30637	Kim	344	' But none the less of good Rajput blood . '
30724	30758	30676	30676	she	1873	' Assuredly of good blood . That these even sell the more comely of their womenfolk for gain . Down south they sell them - to zemindars and such - all of Oudh . '
30856	30875	30876	30876	he	344	' Ahai ! I am only a beggar 's brat , as the Eye of Beauty has said , '
30882	30902	30876	30876	he	344	' Eye of Beauty , forsooth ! Who am I that thou shouldst fling beggar - endearments at me ? '
30913	30968	30905	30905	she	1825	' Forty years ago that might have been said , and not without truth . Ay . thirty years ago . But it is the fault of this gadding up and down Hind that a king 's widow must jostle all the scum of the land , and be made a mock by beggars . '
30969	30973	30975	30975	Kim	344	' Great Queen , '
30986	31019	30981	30981	her	1825	' I am even what the Great Queen says I am ; but none the less is my master holy . He has not yet heard the Great Queen 's order that - '
31020	31045	30905	30905	she	1825	' Order ? I order a Holy One - a Teacher of the Law - to come and speak to a woman ? Never ! '
31046	31060	30981	30981	her	1825	' Pity my stupidity . I thought it was given as an order - '
31061	31077	30981	30981	her	1825	' It was not . It was a petition . Does this make all clear ? '
31118	31137	31096	31098	The old lady	1825	' I am but the Holy One 's disciple . When he has eaten perhaps he will come . '
31138	31146	31160	31162	the old lady	1825	' Oh , villain and shameless rogue ! '
31166	31173	31174	31174	he	344	' Nay , what is it ? '
31198	31219	31174	31174	he	344	' Is - is there any need of a son in thy family ? Speak freely , for we priests - '
31234	31246	31247	31247	She	1825	' We priests ! Thou art not yet old enough to - '
31255	31287	31247	31247	She	1825	' Believe me , now and again , we women , O priest , think of other matters than sons . Moreover , my daughter has borne her man - child . '
31288	31305	31306	31306	Kim	344	' Two arrows in the quiver are better than one ; and three are better still . '
31319	31356	31306	31306	Kim	344	' True - oh , true . But perhaps that will come . Certainly those down- country Brahmins are utterly useless . I sent gifts and monies and gifts again to them , and they prophesied . '
31357	31360	31362	31362	Kim	344	' Ah , '
31368	31372	31362	31362	Kim	344	' they prophesied ! '
31381	31505	31362	31362	Kim	344	' And it was not till I remembered my own Gods that my prayers were heard . I chose an auspicious hour , and - perhaps thy Holy One has heard of the Abbot of the Lung - Cho lamassery . It was to him I put the matter , and behold in the due time all came about as I desired . The Brahmin in the house of the father of my daughter 's son has since said that it was through his prayers - which is a little error that I will explain to him when we reach our journey 's end . And so afterwards I go to Buddh Gaya , to make shraddha for the father of my children . '
31506	31511	31518	31520	the old lady	1825	' Thither go we . '
31512	31516	31518	31520	the old lady	1825	' Doubly auspicious , '
31522	31529	31518	31520	the old lady	1825	' A second son at least ! '
31530	31538	31539	31540	The lama	868	' O Friend of all the World ! '
31560	31570	31571	31571	He	868	' I come ! I come , Holy One ! '
31600	31606	31607	31607	Kim	344	' Go back ! Withdraw ! '
31610	31618	31607	31607	Kim	344	' Do we eat publicly like dogs ? '
31645	31704	31635	31635	Kim	344	' Have I not said an hundred times that the South is a good land ? Here is a virtuous and high - born widow of a Hill Rajah on pilgrimage , she says , to Buddha Gay . She it is sends us those dishes ; and when thou art well rested she would speak to thee . '
31705	31712	31713	31714	The lama	868	' Is this also thy work ? '
31723	31735	31713	31714	The lama	868	' Who else watched over thee since our wonderful journey began ? '
31760	31772	31744	31744	he	344	' Have I failed to oversee thy comforts , Holy One ? '
31773	31779	31780	31781	The lama	868	' A blessing on thee . '
31787	31845	31783	31783	his	868	' I have known many men in my so long life , and disciples not a few . But to none among men , if so be thou art woman - born , has my heart gone out as it has to thee - thoughtful , wise , and courteous ; but something of a small imp . '
31846	31858	31859	31859	Kim	344	' And I have never seen such a priest as thou . '
31869	31894	31859	31859	Kim	344	' It is less than three days since we took the road together , and it is as though it were a hundred years . '
31895	31914	31916	31916	he	868	' Perhaps in a former life it was permitted that I should have rendered thee some service . Maybe '
31919	31951	31916	31916	he	868	' I freed thee from a trap ; or , having caught thee on a hook in the days when I was not enlightened , cast thee back into the river . '
31952	31955	31957	31957	Kim	344	' Maybe , '
31984	32008	31916	31916	he	868	' Now , as regards that woman in the bullock - cart . I think she needs a second son for her daughter . '
32009	32018	32020	32021	the lama	868	' That is no part of the Way , '
32023	32045	32046	32046	He	868	' But at least she is from the Hills . Ah , the Hills , and the snow of the Hills ! '
32361	32368	32370	32370	Kim	344	' She deserves ten thousand grandchildren , '
32372	32388	32370	32370	Kim	344	' None the less , but for me , those gifts would not have come . '
32389	32399	32400	32401	The lama	868	' A virtuous woman - and a wise one . '
32414	32428	32429	32429	He	868	' The world is full of charity to those who follow the Way . '
32440	32446	32429	32429	He	868	' And what said she ? '
32456	32511	32429	32429	He	868	' She asked me many questions and propounded many problems - the most of which were idle tales which she had heard from devil- serving priests who pretend to follow the Way . Some I answered , and some I said were foolish . Many wear the Robe , but few keep the Way . '
32512	32519	32520	32520	Kim	344	' True . That is true . '
32535	32572	32520	32520	Kim	344	' But by her lights she is most right - minded . She desires greatly that we should go with her to Buddh Gaya ; her road being ours , as I understand , for many days '
32578	32579	32520	32520	Kim	344	' '
32582	32583	32520	32520	Kim	344	' '
32653	32654	32638	32638	she	1910	' '
32657	32658	32659	32659	I	0	' '
32694	32695	32678	32678	she	1910	' '
32710	32715	32699	32700	We women	1917	' said Kim sleepily . '
32762	32763	32753	32753	I	0	' '
32766	32787	32753	32753	I	0	' said Kim , turning and speaking in a sharp whisper to one of the Ooryas a few yards away . '
32795	32796	32835	32835	her	1910	' '
32807	32813	32835	32835	her	1910	' He named the village . '
32819	32824	32835	32835	her	1910	' said the lama . '
32837	32838	32835	32835	her	1910	' '
32844	32854	32835	32835	her	1910	' said the Oorya , in an abstracted voice . '
32869	32893	32866	32867	a Brahmin	1927	' Kim breathed the proverb impersonally to the shadow - tops of the trees overhead . The Oorya grunted and held his peace . '
32904	32905	32901	32902	Holy One	385	' '
32940	32988	32934	32934	She	1910	' Kim stifled a laugh in the quilt . When once that imperious old lady had recovered from her natural awe of a lama he thought it probable that she would be worth listening to . He was nearly asleep when the lama suddenly quoted a proverb : '
33000	33377	32934	32934	She	1910	' Then Kim heard him snuff thrice , and dozed off , still laughing . The diamond - bright dawn woke men and crows and bullocks together . Kim sat up and yawned , shook himself , and thrilled with delight . This was seeing the world in real truth ; this was life as he would have it - bustling and shouting , the buckling of belts , and beating of bullocks and creaking of wheels , lighting of fires and cooking of food , and new sights at every turn of the approving eye . The morning mist swept off in a whorl of silver , the parrots shot away to some distant river in shrieking green hosts : all the well - wheels within ear - shot went to work . India was awake , and Kim was in the middle of it , more awake and more excited than anyone , chewing on a twig that he would presently use as a toothbrush ; for he borrowed right- and left - handedly from all the customs of the country he knew and loved . There was no need to worry about food - no need to spend a cowrie at the crowded stalls . He was the disciple of a holy man annexed by a strong - willed old lady . All things would be prepared for them , and when they were respectfully invited so to do they would sit and eat . For the rest - Kim giggled here as he cleaned his teeth - his hostess would rather heighten the enjoyment of the road . He inspected her bullocks critically , as they came up grunting and blowing under the yokes . If they went too fast -it was not likely - there would be a pleasant seat for himself along the pole ; the lama would sit beside the driver . The escort , of course , would walk . The old lady , equally of course , would talk a great deal , and by what he had heard that conversation would not lack salt . She was already ordering , haranguing , rebuking , and , it must be said , cursing her servants for delays . '
33402	33415	33416	33416	She	1932	' cried an Oorya , tying up his shapeless bundles of bedding . '
33429	33430	33423	33423	They	1935	' '
33445	33475	33423	33423	They	1935	' They were backing and wheeling as a grain - cart 's axle caught them by the horns . " Son of an owl , where dost thou go ? '
33482	33504	33505	33506	the man	4471	' Ai ! Yai ! Yai ! That within there is the Queen of Delhi going to pray for a son , '
33514	33534	33505	33506	the man	4471	' Room for the Queen of Delhi and her Prime Minister the grey monkey climbing up his own sword ! '
33668	33673	33675	33675	Kim	344	' Oh , shabash ! '
33688	33787	33675	33675	Kim	344	' Well done , indeed ? It is a shame and a scandal that a poor woman may not go to make prayer to her Gods except she be jostled and insulted by all the refuse of Hindustan - that she must eat gali abuse as men eat ghi . But I have yet a wag left to my tongue - a word or two well spoken that serves the occasion . And still am I without my tobacco ! Who is the one - eyed and luckless son of shame that has not yet prepared my pipe ? '
34038	34042	34043	34043	he	1107	' O mother , '
34046	34068	34043	34043	he	1107	' do they do this in the zenanas ? Suppose an Englishman came by and saw that thou hast no nose ? '
34069	34072	34073	34073	she	1825	' What ? '
34077	34096	34073	34073	she	1825	' Thine own mother has no nose ? Why say so , then , on the open road ? '
34126	34136	34121	34121	She	1825	' Is this a face to tempt virtue aside ? '
34188	34197	34198	34198	she	1825	' That is a nut - cut rogue , '
34201	34242	34198	34198	she	1825	' All police - constables are nut - cuts ; but the police - wallahs are the worst . Hai , my son , thou hast never learned all that since thou camest from Belait Europe . Who suckled thee ? '
34243	34267	34269	34269	he	1970	' A pahareen - a hillwoman of Dalhousie , my mother . Keep thy beauty under a shade - O Dispenser of Delights , '
34273	34278	34280	34280	she	1825	' These be the sort '
34294	34345	34280	34280	she	1825	' These be the sort to oversee justice . They know the land and the customs of the land . The others , all new from Europe , suckled by white women and learning our tongues from books , are worse than the pestilence . They do harm to Kings . '
34946	35008	34945	34945	I	0	'm off to the styes afresh . The Prodigal Son . Once more the lazy , string - tied , shuffling procession got under way , and she slept till they reached the next halting - stage . It was a very short march , and time lacked an hour to sundown , so Kim cast about for means of amusement . '
35016	35023	35025	35026	the devils	2011	' said one of the escort . '
35037	35038	35028	35029	the English	1571	' '
35062	35211	35053	35054	No man	5156	' said his fellow . Kim turned a scornful back - he did not want to hear the old story how the Devil played with the boys and repented of it and walked idly across country . The lama strode after him . All that day , whenever they passed a stream , he had turned aside to look at it , but in no case had he received any warning that he had found his River . Insensibly , too , the comfort of speaking to someone in a reasonable tongue , and of being properly considered and respected as her spiritual adviser by a well - born woman , had weaned his thoughts a little from the Search . And further , he was prepared to spend serene years in his quest ; having nothing of the white man 's impatience , but a great faith . '
35216	35222	35214	35214	thou	2019	' he called after Kim . '
35234	35242	35053	35054	No man	5156	' - Kim waved his hands abroad - '
35248	35249	35053	35054	No man	5156	' '
35269	35270	35271	35272	All women	2022	' '
35276	35284	35271	35272	All women	2022	' Kim spoke as might have Solomon . '
35293	35306	35271	35272	All women	2022	' the lama muttered , looping up the well - worn rosary , '
35328	35337	35312	35312	I	0	' He clicked the beads , and began the '
35487	35493	35495	35495	he	344	' Soldiers . White soldiers ! '
35497	35502	35495	35495	he	344	' Let us see . '
35503	35526	35464	35465	four men	2033	' It is always soldiers when thou and I go out alone together . But I have never seen the white soldiers . '
35527	35543	35544	35544	They	2033	' They do no harm except when they are drunk . Keep behind this tree . '
35630	35638	35644	35644	I	0	' It 's here or hereabouts - officers '
35649	35669	35670	35670	They	2033	' the rest of us can stay outside . Have they marked out for the baggage - wagons behind ? '
35690	35699	35701	35701	one	1164	' Shove the flag in here , then , '
35703	35709	35711	35714	the lama , wonderstruck	2042	' What do they prepare ? '
35716	35733	35711	35714	the lama , wonderstruck	2042	' This is a great and terrible world . What is the device on the flag ? '
35799	35804	35805	35805	he	344	' O Holy One ! '
35808	35856	35805	35805	he	344	' My horoscope ! The drawing in the dust by the priest at Umballa ! Remember what he said . First come two - ferashes - to make all things ready - in a dark place , as it is always at the beginning of a vision . '
35857	35864	35866	35867	the lama	868	' But this is not vision , '
35869	35881	35866	35867	the lama	868	' It is the world 's Illusion , and no more . '
35882	35904	35905	35905	He	868	' And after them comes the Bull - the Red Bull on the green field . Look ! It is he ! '
35976	35985	35987	35988	the lama	868	' I see , and now I remember . '
35990	36010	35987	35988	the lama	868	' Certainly it is thy Bull . Certainly , also , the two men came to make all ready . '
36011	36050	35987	35988	the lama	868	' They are soldiers - white soldiers . What said the priest ? " The sign over against the Bull is the sign of War and armed men . " Holy One , this thing touches my Search . '
36051	36058	36059	36060	The lama	868	' True . It is true . '
36075	36089	36059	36060	The lama	868	' The priest at Umballa said that thine was the sign of War . '
36090	36097	35987	35988	the lama	868	' What is to do now ? '
36098	36105	35987	35988	the lama	868	' Wait . Let us wait . '
36106	36113	36115	36115	Kim	344	' Even now the darkness clears , '
36164	36167	36169	36170	the lama	868	' Hark ! '
36172	36181	36169	36170	the lama	868	' One beats a drum - far off ! '
36210	36216	36217	36217	Kim	344	' Ah ! The music , '
36384	36390	36392	36393	the lama	868	' But this is sorcery ! '
36477	36482	36484	36485	the lama	868	' Let us go , '
36508	36526	36528	36528	Kim	344	' Stand back in the shadow . No one can see beyond the light of a fire , '
36554	36561	36563	36564	the lama	868	' Look ! look ! look ! '
36566	36572	36563	36564	the lama	868	' Yonder comes a priest . '
36694	36706	36708	36715	the lama , who judged only by tone	2090	' The talk of white men is wholly lacking in dignity , '
36717	36752	36708	36715	the lama , who judged only by tone	2090	' But I considered the countenance of that priest and I think he is learned . Is it likely that he will understand our talk ? I would talk to him of my Search . '
36753	36765	36767	36767	Kim	344	' Never speak to a white man till he is fed , '
36776	36826	36767	36767	Kim	344	' They will eat now , and - and I do not think they are good to beg from . Let us go back to the resting - place . After we have eaten we will come again . It certainly was a Red Bull - my Red Bull . '
36861	36864	36866	36866	Kim	344	' Now , '
36872	36913	36866	36866	Kim	344	' we will return to that place ; but thou , O Holy One , must wait a little way off , because thy feet are heavier than mine and I am anxious to see more of that Red Bull . '
36914	36931	36932	36933	the lama	868	' But how canst thou understand the talk ? Walk slowly . The road is dark , '

36957	36968	36955	36955	he	344	' where thou canst sit till I call . Nay , '
36978	37023	36955	36955	he	344	' remember this is my Search - the Search for my Red Bull . The sign in the Stars was not for thee . I know a little of the customs of white soldiers , and I always desire to see some new things . '
37024	37034	37035	37036	The lama	868	' What dost thou not know of this world ? '
37066	37072	37073	37073	Kim	344	' Stay till I call . '
37678	37686	37687	37687	he	471	' Why , it 's a boy ! '
37711	37718	37691	37691	he	471	' What were you doing ? You 're
37726	37824	37691	37691	he	471	' His Hindustani was very limited , and the ruffled and disgusted Kim intended to keep to the character laid down for him . As he recovered his breath he was inventing a beautifully plausible tale of his relations to some scullion , and at the same time keeping a keen eye on and a little under the Chaplain 's left arm - pit . The chance came ; he ducked for the doorway , but a long arm shot out and clutched at his neck , snapping the amulet - string and closing on the amulet . '
37844	37869	37691	37691	he	471	' The words were in English - the tinny , saw - cut English of the native - bred , and the Chaplain jumped . '
37873	37881	37691	37691	he	471	' said he , opening his hand . '
37910	37911	37906	37906	You	0	' '
37921	37934	37916	37916	I	0	' Kim danced in agony like a terrier at a lifted stick . '
37953	37980	37981	37981	I	0	' The Chaplain took no heed , but , going to the tent door , called aloud . A fattish , clean - shaven man appeared . '
37989	37993	37986	37987	Father Victor	452	' said Bennett . '
38057	38129	38130	38131	A thief	2127	' Between himself and the Roman Catholic Chaplain of the Irish contingent lay , as Bennett believed , an unbridgeable gulf , but it was noticeable that whenever the Church of England dealt with a human problem she was very likely to call in the Church of Rome . Bennett 's official abhorrence of the Scarlet Woman and all her ways was only equalled by his private respect for Father Victor . '
38155	38162	38153	38153	Bennett	471	' He held out his hand . '
38176	38177	38178	38178	I	0	' '
38183	38187	38188	38188	You	471	' protested Kim . '
38209	38210	38188	38188	You	471	' '
38221	38233	38216	38216	We	2133	' said Father Victor , leisurely rolling out poor Kimball O'Hara 's '
38236	38274	38277	38278	the boy	986	' parchment , his clearance - certificate , and Kim 's baptismal certificate . On this last O'Hara - with some confused idea that he was doing wonders for his son - had scrawled scores of times : '
38285	38296	38304	38305	Father Victor	452	' - signing his name and regimental number in full . '
38314	38323	38311	38312	Mr Bennett	471	' Do you know what these things are ? '
38324	38327	38329	38329	Kim	344	' Yes . '
38331	38343	38329	38329	Kim	344	' They are mine , and I want to go away . '
38344	38351	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' I do not quite understand , '
38356	38374	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' He probably brought them on purpose . It may be a begging trick of some kind . '
38375	38408	38311	38312	Mr Bennett	471	' I never saw a beggar less anxious to stay with his company , then . There 's the makings of a gay mystery here . Ye believe in Providence , Bennett ? '
38409	38414	38311	38312	Mr Bennett	471	' I hope so . '
38415	38469	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' Well , I believe in miracles , so it comes to the same thing . Powers of Darkness ! Kimball O'Hara ! And his son ! But then he 's a native , and I saw Kimball married myself to Annie Shott . How long have you had these things , boy ? '
38470	38479	38480	38481	Father Victor	452	' Ever since I was a little baby . '
38495	38512	38480	38481	Father Victor	452	' You see , Bennett , he 's not very black . What 's your name ? '
38513	38516	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' Kim . '
38517	38521	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' Or Kimball ? '
38522	38532	38480	38481	Father Victor	452	' Perhaps . Will you let me go away ? '
38533	38537	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' What else ? '
38538	38553	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' They call me Kim Rishti ke . That is Kim of the Rishti . '
38554	38563	38480	38481	Father Victor	452	' What is that - " Rishti " ? '
38564	38578	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' Eye - rishti - that was the Regiment - my father 's . '
38579	38587	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' Irish - oh , I see . '
38588	38606	38480	38481	Father Victor	452	' Yess . That was how my father told me . My father , he has lived . '
38607	38612	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' Has lived where ? '
38613	38627	38353	38354	Mr Bennett	471	' Has lived . Of course he is dead - gone - out . '
38628	38643	38644	38644	Bennett	471	' Oh ! That 's your abrupt way of putting it , is it ? '
38647	38683	38644	38644	Bennett	471	' It is possible I have done the boy an injustice . He is certainly white , though evidently neglected . I am sure I must have bruised him . I do not think spirits - '
38684	38706	38708	38709	Father Victor	452	' Get him a glass of sherry , then , and let him squat on the cot . Now , Kim , '
38711	38738	38708	38709	Father Victor	452	' no one is going to hurt you . Drink that down and tell us about yourself . The truth , if you 've no objection . '
38842	38873	38874	38874	Kim	344	' My father , he is dead in Lahore city since I was very little . The woman , she kept kabarri shop near where the hire - carriages are . '
38891	38895	38874	38874	Kim	344	' Your mother ? '
38896	38899	38822	38824	the fat padre	2139	' No ! '
38907	38934	38935	38935	Bennett	471	' She went out when I was born . My father , he got these papers from the Jadoo - Gher what do you call that ? '
38937	38952	38935	38935	Bennett	471	' because he was in good - standing . What do you call that ? '
38957	39008	38954	38954	Bennett	471	' My father told me that . He said , too , and also the Brahmin who made the drawing in the dust at Umballa two days ago , he said , that I shall find a Red Bull on a green field and that the Bull shall help me . '
39009	39015	39017	39017	Bennett	471	' A phenomenal little liar , '
39019	39029	39031	39032	Father Victor	452	' Powers of Darkness below , what a country ! '
39034	39040	39031	39032	Father Victor	452	' Go on , Kim . '
39041	39250	38954	38954	Bennett	471	' I did not thieve . Besides , I am just now disciple of a very holy man . He is sitting outside . We saw two men come with flags , making the place ready . That is always so in a dream , or on account of a - a - prophecy . So I knew it was come true . I saw the Red Bull on the green field , and my father he said : " Nine hundred pukka devils and the Colonel riding on a horse will look after you when you find the Red Bull ! " I did not know what to do when I saw the Bull , but I went away and I came again when it was dark . I wanted to see the Bull again , and I saw the Bull again with the - the Sahibs praying to it . I think the Bull shall help me . The holy man said so too . He is sitting outside . Will you hurt him , if I call him a shout now ? He is very holy . He can witness to all the things I say , and he knows I am not a thief . '
39251	39270	39272	39272	Bennett	471	' " Sahibs praying to a bull ! " What in the world do you make of that ? '
39275	39288	39272	39272	Bennett	471	' Disciple of a holy man ! " Is the boy mad ? '
39289	39338	38954	38954	Bennett	471	' It 's O'Hara 's boy , sure enough . O'Hara 's boy leagued with all the Powers of Darkness . It 's very much what his father would have done if he was drunk . We 'd better invite the holy man . He may know something . '
39339	39346	39348	39348	Kim	344	' He does not know anything , '
39350	39371	39348	39348	Kim	344	' I will show you him if you come . He is my master . Then afterwards we can go . '
39372	39377	39381	39382	Father Victor	452	' Powers of Darkness ! '
39409	39419	39421	39421	Kim	344	' The Search is at an end for me , '
39426	39480	39421	39421	Kim	344	' I have found the Bull , but God knows what comes next . They will not hurt you . Come to the fat priest 's tent with this thin man and see the end . It is all new , and they can not talk Hindi . They are only uncurried donkeys . '
39481	39495	39496	39497	the lama	868	' Then it is not well to make a jest of their ignorance , '
39500	39511	39516	39516	he	2142	' I am glad if thou art rejoiced , chela . '
39581	39583	39556	39556	Bennett	471	' heathen '
39585	39603	39607	39607	himself	868	' And what was the end of the Search ? What gift has the Red Bull brought ? '
39611	39624	39625	39625	Bennett	471	' He says , " What are you going to do ? " '
39649	39672	39673	39673	Bennett	471	' I do not see what concern this fakir has with the boy , who is probably his dupe or his confederate , '
39676	39706	39673	39673	Bennett	471	' We can not allow an English boy - Assuming that he is the son of a Mason , the sooner he goes to the Masonic Orphanage the better . '
39707	39721	39723	39724	Father Victor	452	' Ah ! That 's your opinion as Secretary to the Regimental Lodge , '
39726	39751	39723	39724	Father Victor	452	' but we might as well tell the old man what we are going to do . He does n't look like a villain . '
39752	39783	39784	39784	Kim	344	' My experience is that one can never fathom the Oriental mind . Now , Kimball , I wish you to tell this man what I say word for word . '
39797	39819	39784	39784	Kim	344	' Holy One , the thin fool who looks like a camel says that I am the son of a Sahib . '
39820	39824	39723	39724	Father Victor	452	' But how ? '
39825	39953	39723	39724	Father Victor	452	' Oh , it is true . I knew it since my birth , but he could only find it out by rending the amulet from my neck and reading all the papers . He thinks that once a Sahib is always a Sahib , and between the two of them they purpose to keep me in this Regiment or to send me to a madrissah a school . It has happened before . I have always avoided it . The fat fool is of one mind and the camel - like one of another . But that is no odds . I may spend one night here and perhaps the next . It has happened before . Then I will run away and return to thee . '
39954	39994	39784	39784	Kim	344	' But tell them that thou art my chela . Tell them how thou didst come to me when I was faint and bewildered . Tell them of our Search , and they will surely let thee go now . '
39995	40012	39723	39724	Father Victor	452	' I have already told them . They laugh , and they talk of the police . '
40013	40019	40021	40022	Mr Bennett	471	' What are you saying ? '
40024	40055	40021	40022	Mr Bennett	471	' Oah . He only says that if you do not let me go it will stop him in his business - his ur - gent private af - fairs . '
40084	40106	40123	40123	he	452	' And if you did know what his business was you would not be in such a beastly hurry to interfere . '
40107	40113	40115	40116	Father Victor	452	' What is it then ? '
40130	40156	40123	40123	he	452	' There is a River in this country which he wishes to find so verree much . It was put out by an Arrow which - '
40177	40214	40163	40163	he	344	' Oah , it was made by our Lord God Buddha , you know , and if you wash there you are washed away from all your sins and made as white as cotton - wool . '
40225	40246	40163	40163	he	344	' I am his disciple , and we must find that River . It is so verree valuable to us . '
40247	40252	40254	40254	Bennett	471	' Say that again , '
40262	40269	40163	40163	he	344	' But this is gross blasphemy ! '
40276	40281	40283	40284	Father Victor	452	' Tck ! Tck ! '
40287	40320	40283	40284	Father Victor	452	' I 'd give a good deal to be able to talk the vernacular . A river that washes away sin ! And how long have you two been looking for it ? '
40321	40347	40163	40163	he	344	' Oh , many days . Now we wish to go away and look for it again . It is not here , you see . '
40348	40352	40354	40355	Father Victor	452	' I see , '
40358	40429	40354	40355	Father Victor	452	' But he ca n't go on in that old man 's company . It would be different , Kim , if you were not a soldier 's son . Tell him that the Regiment will take care of you and make you as good a man as your - as good a man as can be . Tell him that if he believes in miracles he must believe that - '
40430	40441	40442	40442	Bennett	471	' There is no need to play on his credulity , '
40445	40447	40442	40442	Bennett	471	' I 'm
40506	40539	40540	40540	He	471	' march for him to meet with ! It 's predestined on the face of it . Yes , tell him it 's Kismet . Kismet , mallum ? Do you understand ? '
40557	40561	40563	40565	the old man	861	' They say , '
40573	40772	40774	40775	the boy	986	' they say that the meaning of my horoscope is now accomplished , and that being led back - though as thou knowest I went out of curiosity - to these people and their Red Bull I must needs go to a madrissah and be turned into a Sahib . Now I make pretence of agreement , for at the worst it will be but a few meals eaten away from thee . Then I will slip away and follow down the road to Saharunpore . Therefore , Holy One , keep with that Kulu woman - on no account stray far from her cart till I come again . Past question , my sign is of War and of armed men . See how they have given me wine to drink and set me upon a bed of honour ! My father must have been some great person . So if they raise me to honour among them , good . If not , good again . However it goes , I will run back to thee when I am tired . But stay with the Rajputni , or I shall miss thy feet ... Oah yess , '
40777	40789	40774	40775	the boy	986	' I have told him everything you tell me to say . '
40790	40803	40805	40805	Bennett	471	' And I can not see any need why he should wait , '
40814	40830	40805	40805	Bennett	471	' We can investigate the details later - and I will give him a ru - '
40831	40844	40846	40847	Father Victor	452	' Give him time . Maybe he 's fond of the lad , '
40873	40880	40856	40857	The lama	868	' What can he want now ? '
40881	40884	40886	40886	Kim	344	' He says '
40892	40958	40886	40886	Kim	344	' He says : " Be quiet . " He wants to speak to me by himself . You see , you do not know one little word of what he says , and I think if you talk he will perhaps give you very bad curses . When he takes those beads like that , you see , he always wants to be quiet . '
40989	40999	41000	41001	The lama	868	' A Sahib and the son of a Sahib - '
41009	41034	41000	41001	The lama	868	' But no white man knows the land and the customs of the land as thou knowest . How comes it this is true ? '
41035	41082	40971	40971	Bennett	471	' What matter , Holy One ? - but remember it is only for a night or two . Remember , I can change swiftly . It will all be as it was when I first spoke to thee under Zam - Zammah the great gun - '
41083	41119	41120	41120	He	868	' As a boy in the dress of white men - when I first went to the Wonder House . And a second time thou wast a Hindu . What shall the third incarnation be ? '
41124	41146	41120	41120	He	868	' Ah , chela , thou has done a wrong to an old man because my heart went out to thee . '
41147	41169	41170	41171	The lama	868	' And mine to thee . But how could I know that the Red Bull would bring me to this business ? '
41197	41209	41210	41210	he	868	' Now it is understood that the boy is a Sahib ? '
41218	41234	41210	41210	he	868	' Such a Sahib as was he who kept the images in the Wonder House . '
41253	41280	41245	41245	He	868	' So then it is not seemly that he should do other than as the Sahibs do . He must go back to his own people . '
41281	41292	41293	41293	Kim	344	' For a day and a night and a day , '
41296	41303	41293	41293	Kim	344	' No , ye do n't ! '
41319	41385	41307	41307	Kim	344	' I do not understand the customs of white men . The Priest of the Images in the Wonder House in Lahore was more courteous than the thin one here . This boy will be taken from me . They will make a Sahib of my disciple ? Woe to me ! How shall I find my River ? Have they no disciples ? Ask . '
41386	41427	41439	41439	Kim	344	' He says he is very sorree that he can not find the River now any more . He says , Why have you no disciples , and stop bothering him ? He wants to be washed of his sins . '
41450	41506	41439	41439	Kim	344	' I think if you will let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal . We will look for that River like before I was caught . I wish I did not come here to find the Red Bull and all that sort of thing . I do not want it . '
41507	41525	41527	41527	Bennett	471	' It 's the very best day 's work you ever did for yourself , young man , '
41529	41542	41544	41545	Father Victor	452	' Good heavens , I do n't know how to console him , '
41552	41572	41576	41578	a good man	5663	' He ca n't take the boy away with him , and yet he 's a good man - I 'm

In the forenoon the column checked . A camel - orderly handed the Colonel a letter . He read it , and spoke to a Major . Half a mile in the rear , Kim heard a hoarse and joyful clamour rolling down on him through the thick dust . Then someone beat him on the back , crying : '

44197	44636	44659	44659	he	344	' For the rest of the day Kim found himself an object of distinguished consideration among a few hundred white men . The story of his appearance in camp , the discovery of his parentage , and his prophecy , had lost nothing in the telling . A big , shapeless white woman on a pile of bedding asked him mysteriously whether he thought her husband would come back from the war . Kim reflected gravely , and said that he would , and the woman gave him food . In many respects , this big procession that played music at intervals - this crowd that talked and laughed so easily - resembled a festival in Lahore city . So far , there was no sign of hard work , and he resolved to lend the spectacle his patronage . At evening there came out to meet them bands of music , and played the Mavericks into camp near Umballa railway station . That was an interesting night . Men of other regiments came to visit the Mavericks . The Mavericks went visiting on their own account . Their pickets hurried forth to bring them back , met pickets of strange regiments on the same duty ; and , after a while , the bugles blew madly for more pickets with officers to control the tumult . The Mavericks had a reputation for liveliness to live up to . But they fell in on the platform next morning in perfect shape and condition ; and Kim , left behind with the sick , women , and boys , found himself shouting farewells excitedly as the trains drew away . Life as a Sahib was amusing so far ; but he touched it with a cautious hand . Then they marched him back in charge of a drummer - boy to empty , lime - washed barracks , whose floors were covered with rubbish and string and paper , and whose ceilings gave back his lonely footfall . Native - fashion , he curled himself up on a stripped cot and went to sleep . An angry man stumped down the veranda , woke him up , and said he was a schoolmaster . This was enough for Kim , and he retired into his shell . He could just puzzle out the various English Police notices in Lahore city , because they affected his comfort ; and among the many guests of the woman who looked after him had been a queer German who painted scenery for the Parsee travelling theatre . He told Kim that he had been '
44641	44646	44659	44659	he	344	' Forty - eight , '
44689	44699	44701	44701	Kim	344	' I do not know anything . Go away ! '

44941	44953	44955	44955	Kim	344	' To the bazar - to get sweets - for you , '
44960	44968	44955	44955	Kim	344	' Well , the bazar 's out o '

45120	45238	45024	45024	you	344	' This did not impress Kim as much as the knowledge that his raiment would tire him out if he tried to run . He slouched to the tree at the corner of a bare road leading towards the bazar , and eyed the natives passing . Most of them were barrack - servants of the lowest caste . Kim hailed a sweeper , who promptly retorted with a piece of unnecessary insolence , in the natural belief that the European boy could not follow it . The low , quick answer undeceived him . Kim put his fettered soul into it , thankful for the late chance to abuse somebody in the tongue he knew best . '

He gazed imploringly at the clear - cut face in which there was no glimmer of recognition ; but even at this extremity it never occurred to him to throw himself on the white man 's mercy or to denounce the Afghan . And Mahbub stared deliberately at the Englishman , who stared as deliberately at Kim , quivering and tongue - tied . '

He was one insignificant person in all this roaring whirl of India , going southward to he knew not what fate . Presently the Colonel sent for him , and talked for a long time . So far as Kim could gather , he was to be diligent and enter the Survey of India as a chain - man . If he were very good , and passed the proper examinations , he would be earning thirty rupees a month at seventeen years old , and Colonel Creighton would see that he found suitable employment . Kim pretended at first to understand perhaps one word in three of this talk . Then the Colonel , seeing his mistake , turned to fluent and picturesque Urdu and Kim was contented . No man could be a fool who knew the language so intimately , who moved so gently and silently , and whose eyes were so different from the dull fat eyes of other Sahibs . '

54733	54736	54737	54737	he	344	' Stop ! '
54740	54754	54737	54737	he	344	' Stay here . I do not go to the school at once . '

54834	54891	54827	54828	the lama	868	' Nay , I had a disciple with me . He that was my friend at the Temple of the Tirthankars gave me a guide for this journey . I came from Benares in the te - rain , when thy letter was given me . Yes , I am well fed . I need nothing . '
54892	54926	54827	54828	the lama	868	' But why didst thou not stay with the Kulu woman , O Holy One ? In what way didst thou get to Benares ? My heart has been heavy since we parted . '
54927	55013	54827	54828	the lama	868	' The woman wearied me by constant flux of talk and requiring charms for children . I separated myself from that company , permitting her to acquire merit by gifts . She is at least a woman of open hands , and I made a promise to return to her house if need arose . Then , perceiving myself alone in this great and terrible world , I bethought me of the te - rain to Benares , where I knew one abode in the Tirthankars '

I had a fear that , perhaps , I came because I wished to see thee - misguided by the Red Mist of affection . It is not so ... Moreover , I am troubled by a dream . '
55332	55365	55383	55384	the driver	5427	' But surely , Holy One , thou hast not forgotten the Road and all that befell on it . Surely it was a little to see me that thou didst come ? '
55366	55381	55383	55384	the driver	5427	' The horses are cold , and it is past their feeding - time , '
55386	55398	55399	55399	Kim	344	' Go to Jehannum and abide there with thy reputationless aunt ! '
55405	55463	55399	55399	Kim	344	' I am all alone in this land ; I know not where I go nor what shall befall me . My heart was in that letter I sent thee . Except for Mahbub Ali , and he is a Pathan , I have no friend save thee , Holy One . Do not altogether go away . '
55464	55471	55472	55473	the lama	868	' I have considered that also , '
55481	55573	55575	55576	the lama	868	' It is manifest that from time to time I shall acquire merit if before that I have not found my River - by assuring myself that thy feet are set on wisdom . What they will teach thee I do not know , but the priest wrote me that no son of a Sahib in all India will be better taught than thou . So from time to time , therefore , I will come again . Maybe thou wilt be such a Sahib as he who gave me these spectacles '
55581	55618	55575	55576	the lama	868	' in the Wonder House at Lahore . That is my hope , for he was a Fountain of Wisdom - wiser than many abbots .... Again , maybe thou wilt forget me and our meetings . '
55619	55626	55628	55628	Kim	344	' If I eat thy bread , '
55631	55639	55628	55628	Kim	344	' how shall I ever forget thee ? '
55640	55645	55646	55646	He	868	' No - no . '
55652	55697	55646	55646	He	868	' I must go back to Benares . From time to time , now that I know the customs of letter- writers in this land , I will send thee a letter , and from time to time I will come and see thee . '
55698	55707	55709	55709	Kim	344	' But whither shall I send my letters ? '
55724	55828	55709	55709	Kim	344	' To the Temple of the Tirthankars at Benares . That is the place I have chosen till I find my River . Do not weep ; for , look you , all Desire is Illusion and a new binding upon the Wheel . Go up to the Gates of Learning . Let me see thee go ... Dost thou love me ? Then go , or my heart cracks ... I will come again . Surely I will come again . The lama watched the ticca - gharri rumble into the compound , and strode off , snuffing between each long stride . '
55833	56665	55646	55646	He	868	' shut with a clang . The country born and bred boy has his own manners and customs , which do not resemble those of any other land ; and his teachers approach him by roads which an English master would not understand . Therefore , you would scarcely be interested in Kim 's experiences as a St Xavier 's boy among two or three hundred precocious youths , most of whom had never seen the sea . He suffered the usual penalties for breaking out of bounds when there was cholera in the city . This was before he had learned to write fair English , and so was obliged to find a bazar letter - writer . He was , of course , indicted for smoking and for the use of abuse more full - flavoured than even St Xavier 's had ever heard . He learned to wash himself with the Levitical scrupulosity of the native - born , who in his heart considers the Englishman rather dirty . He played the usual tricks on the patient coolies pulling the punkahs in the sleeping- rooms where the boys threshed through the hot nights telling tales till the dawn ; and quietly he measured himself against his self- reliant mates . They were sons of subordinate officials in the Railway , Telegraph , and Canal Services ; of warrant - officers , sometimes retired and sometimes acting as commanders - in - chief to a feudatory Rajah 's army ; of captains of the Indian Marine Government pensioners , planters , Presidency shopkeepers , and missionaries . A few were cadets of the old Eurasian houses that have taken strong root in Dhurrumtollah - Pereiras , De Souzas , and D'Silvas . Their parents could well have educated them in England , but they loved the school that had served their own youth , and generation followed sallow- hued generation at St Xavier 's . Their homes ranged from Howrah of the railway people to abandoned cantonments like Monghyr and Chunar ; lost tea - gardens Shillong - way ; villages where their fathers were large landholders in Oudh or the Deccan ; Mission - stations a week from the nearest railway line ; seaports a thousand miles south , facing the brazen Indian surf ; and cinchona - plantations south of all . The mere story of their adventures , which to them were no adventures , on their road to and from school would have crisped a Western boy 's hair . They were used to jogging off alone through a hundred miles of jungle , where there was always the delightful chance of being delayed by tigers ; but they would no more have bathed in the English Channel in an English August than their brothers across the world would have lain still while a leopard snuffed at their palanquin . There were boys of fifteen who had spent a day and a half on an islet in the middle of a flooded river , taking charge , as by right , of a camp of frantic pilgrims returning from a shrine . There were seniors who had requisitioned a chance - met Rajah 's elephant , in the name of St Francis Xavier , when the Rains once blotted out the cart - track that led to their father 's estate , and had all but lost the huge beast in a quicksand . There was a boy who , he said , and none doubted , had helped his father to beat off with rifles from the veranda a rush of Akas in the days when those head - hunters were bold against lonely plantations . And every tale was told in the even , passionless voice of the native - born , mixed with quaint reflections , borrowed unconsciously from native foster - mothers , and turns of speech that showed they had been that instant translated from the vernacular . Kim watched , listened , and approved . This was not insipid , single - word talk of drummer - boys . It dealt with a life he knew and in part understood . The atmosphere suited him , and he throve by inches . They gave him a white drill suit as the weather warmed , and he rejoiced in the new- found bodily comforts as he rejoiced to use his sharpened mind over the tasks they set him . His quickness would have delighted an English master ; but at St Xavier 's they know the first rush of minds developed by sun and surroundings , as they know the half- collapse that sets in at twenty - two or twenty - three . None the less he remembered to hold himself lowly . When tales were told of hot nights , Kim did not sweep the board with his reminiscences ; for St Xavier 's looks down on boys who '
56672	56759	55646	55646	He	868	' One must never forget that one is a Sahib , and that some day , when examinations are passed , one will command natives . Kim made a note of this , for he began to understand where examinations led . Then came the holidays from August to October - the long holidays imposed by the heat and the Rains . Kim was informed that he would go north to some station in the hills behind Umballa , where Father Victor would arrange for him . '
56765	56778	55646	55646	He	868	' said Kim , who had asked many questions and thought more . '
56785	56790	56781	56781	I	0	' said the master . '
56818	57119	56810	56812	young De Castro	523	' Kim considered it in every possible light . He had been diligent , even as the Colonel advised . A boy 's holiday was his own property - of so much the talk of his companions had advised him , - and a barrack - school would be torment after St Xavier 's . Moreover - this was magic worth anything else - he could write . In three months he had discovered how men can speak to each other without a third party , at the cost of half an anna and a little knowledge . No word had come from the lama , but there remained the Road . Kim yearned for the caress of soft mud squishing up between the toes , as his mouth watered for mutton stewed with butter and cabbages , for rice speckled with strong scented cardamoms , for the saffron - tinted rice , garlic and onions , and the forbidden greasy sweetmeats of the bazars . They would feed him raw beef on a platter at the barrack- school , and he must smoke by stealth . But again , he was a Sahib and was at St Xavier 's , and that pig Mahbub Ali ... No , he would not test Mahbub 's hospitality - and yet ... He thought it out alone in the dormitory , and came to the conclusion he had been unjust to Mahbub . The school was empty ; nearly all the masters had gone away ; Colonel Creighton 's railway pass lay in his hand , and Kim puffed himself that he had not spent Colonel Creighton 's or Mahbub 's money in riotous living . He was still lord of two rupees seven annas . His new bullock - trunk , marked '
57122	57136	56810	56812	young De Castro	523	' , and bedding - roll lay in the empty sleeping - room . '
57145	57153	57154	57154	You	2684	' said Kim , nodding at them . '
57158	57185	57154	57154	You	2684	' He went out into the warm rain , smiling sinfully , and sought a certain house whose outside he had noted down some time before ... '
57187	57206	57154	57154	You	2684	' ! Dost thou know what manner of women we be in this quarter ? Oh , shame ! '
57207	57213	57214	57214	Kim	344	' Was I born yesterday ? '
57227	57248	57214	57214	Kim	344	' A little dyestuff and three yards of cloth to help out a jest . Is it much to ask ? '
57249	57267	57154	57154	You	2684	' Who is she ? Thou art full young , as Sahibs go , for this devilry . '
57268	57319	57154	57154	You	2684	' Oh , she ? She is the daughter of a certain schoolmaster of a regiment in the cantonments . He has beaten me twice because I went over their wall in these clothes . Now I would go as a gardener 's boy . Old men are very jealous . '
57320	57336	57214	57214	Kim	344	' That is true . Hold thy face still while I dab on the juice . '
57337	57355	57154	57154	You	2684	' Not too black , Naikan . I would not appear to her as a hubshi nigger . '
57356	57372	57154	57154	You	2684	' Oh , love makes nought of these things . And how old is she ? '
57373	57380	57382	57384	the shameless Kim	344	' Twelve years , I think , '
57386	57412	57413	57413	he	344	' Spread it also on the breast . It may be her father will tear my clothes off me , and if I am piebald - '
57442	57474	57416	57417	The girl	4813	' Now send out and get me a cloth for the turban . Woe is me , my head is all unshaved ! And he will surely knock off my turban . '
57475	57514	57515	57515	She	4813	' I am not a barber , but I will make shift . Thou wast born to be a breaker of hearts ! All this disguise for one evening ? Remember , the stuff does not wash away . '
57526	57546	57515	57515	She	4813	' But who is to pay me for this ? Huneefa herself could not have given thee better stuff . '
57547	57556	57558	57558	Kim	344	' Trust in the Gods , my sister , '
57570	57584	57558	57558	Kim	344	' Besides , hast thou ever helped to paint a Sahib thus before ? '
57585	57596	57515	57515	She	4813	' Never indeed . But a jest is not money . '
57597	57604	57515	57515	She	4813	' It is worth much more . '
57605	57658	57659	57659	She	4813	' Child , thou art beyond all dispute the most shameless son of Shaitan that I have ever known to take up a poor girl 's time with this play , and then to say : " Is not the jest enough ? " Thou wilt go very far in this world . '
57665	57670	57671	57672	All one	2689	' salutation in mockery . '
57683	57939	57659	57659	She	4813	' Kim shifted from foot to foot , his eyes ablaze with mirth as he thought of the fat days before him . He gave the girl four annas , and ran down the stairs in the likeness of a low - caste Hindu boy - perfect in every detail . A cookshop was his next point of call , where he feasted in extravagance and greasy luxury . On Lucknow station platform he watched young De Castro , all covered with prickly - heat , get into a second - class compartment . Kim patronized a third , and was the life and soul of it . He explained to the company that he was assistant to a juggler who had left him behind sick with fever , and that he would pick up his master at Umballa . As the occupants of the carriage changed , he varied this tale , or adorned it with all the shoots of a budding fancy , the more rampant for being held off native speech so long . In all India that night was no human being so joyful as Kim . At Umballa he got out and headed eastward , plashing over the sodden fields to the village where the old soldier lived . About this time Colonel Creighton at Simla was advised from Lucknow by wire that young O'Hara had disappeared . Mahbub Ali was in town selling horses , and to him the Colonel confided the affair one morning cantering round Annandale racecourse . '
57946	57953	57659	57659	She	4813	' said the horse - dealer . '
58046	58047	58055	58055	you	0	' '
58057	58058	58049	58049	he	2692	' '
58081	58098	58124	58124	he	2692	' Next morning , on the same course , Mahbub 's stallion ranged alongside the Colonel . '
58106	58113	58124	58124	he	2692	' said the horse - dealer . '
58142	58143	58124	58124	he	2692	' '
58146	58253	58124	58124	he	2692	' said the Colonel , with a sigh of relief . It was absurd that a man of his position should take an interest in a little country- bred vagabond ; but the Colonel remembered the conversation in the train , and often in the past few months had caught himself thinking of the queer , silent , self - possessed boy . His evasion , of course , was the height of insolence , but it argued some resource and nerve . Mahbub 's eyes twinkled as he reined out into the centre of the cramped little plain , where none could come near unseen . '

58779	58847	58776	58776	Sahibs	552	' This prophecy was fulfilled to the letter a month later . Mahbub had gone down to Umballa to bring up a fresh consignment of horses , and Kim met him on the Kalka road at dusk riding alone , begged an alms of him , was sworn at , and replied in English . There was nobody within earshot to hear Mahbub 's gasp of amazement . '

59745	59806	59807	59807	Mahbub	383	' It was my holiday , Hajji . I was a slave for many weeks . Why should I not run away when the school was shut ? Look , too , how I , living upon my friends or working for my bread , as I did with the Sikh , have saved the Colonel Sahib a great expense . '

59859	59862	59864	59864	Kim	344	' That , '
59867	59876	59864	59864	Kim	344	' I knew a very long time ago . '
59877	59881	59807	59807	Mahbub	383	' Who told ? '
59882	59925	59831	59831	his	2753	' The Colonel Sahib himself . Not in those many words , but plainly enough for one who is not altogether a mud - head . Yea , he told me in the te - rain when we went down to Lucknow . '
59926	59954	59864	59864	Kim	344	' Be it so . Then I will tell thee more , Friend of all the World , though in the telling I lend thee my head . '
59955	59962	59964	59964	Kim	344	' It was forfeit to me , '
59970	59991	59964	59964	Kim	344	' in Umballa , when thou didst pick me up on the horse after the drummer - boy beat me . '
59992	60025	59864	59864	Kim	344	' Speak a little plainer . All the world may tell lies save thou and I. For equally is thy life forfeit to me if I chose to raise my finger here . '
60026	60035	60037	60037	Kim	344	' And this is known to me also , '
60049	60154	60155	60155	he	344	' It is a very sure tie between us . Indeed , thy hold is surer even than mine ; for who would miss a boy beaten to death , or , it may be , thrown into a well by the roadside ? Most people here and in Simla and across the passes behind the Hills would , on the other hand , say : " What has come to Mahbub Ali ? " if he were found dead among his horses . Surely , too , the Colonel Sahib would make inquiries . But again,'- Kim 's face puckered with cunning , - '
60189	60190	60183	60183	I	0	' '
60197	60198	60183	60183	I	0	' '
60315	60337	60308	60309	Mahbub Ali	383	' Up went a gout of heavy smoke . There was a long pause : then Mahbub Ali spoke in admiration : '
60357	60371	60308	60309	Mahbub Ali	383	' little sons at the madrissah and meekly take instruction from thy teachers ? '
60372	60378	60380	60380	Kim	344	' It is an order , '
60383	60392	60380	60380	Kim	344	' Who am I to dispute an order ? '
60393	60401	60403	60404	Mahbub Ali	383	' A most finished Son of Eblis , '
60406	60419	60403	60404	Mahbub Ali	383	' But what is this tale of the thief and the search ? '
60420	60426	60428	60428	Kim	344	' That which I saw , '
60430	60533	60428	60428	Kim	344	' the night that my lama and I lay next thy place in the Kashmir Seral . The door was left unlocked , which I think is not thy custom , Mahbub . He came in as one assured that thou wouldst not soon return . My eye was against a knot - hole in the plank . He searched as it were for something - not a rug , not stirrups , nor a bridle , nor brass pots - something little and most carefully hid . Else why did he prick with an iron between the soles of thy slippers ? '
60534	60537	60538	60539	Mahbub Ali	383	' Ha ! '
60543	60562	60538	60539	Mahbub Ali	383	' And seeing these things , what tale didst thou fashion to thyself , Well of the Truth ? '
60563	60659	60660	60660	Kim	344	' None . I put my hand upon my amulet , which lies always next to my skin , and , remembering the pedigree of a white stallion that I had bitten out of a piece of Mussalmani bread , I went away to Umballa perceiving that a heavy trust was laid upon me . At that hour , had I chosen , thy head was forfeit . It needed only to say to that man , " I have here a paper concerning a horse which I can not read . " And then ? '
60668	60690	60692	60692	Mahbub	383	' Then thou wouldst have drunk water twice - perhaps thrice , afterwards . I do not think more than thrice , '
60695	60759	60692	60692	Mahbub	383	' It is true . I thought of that a little , but most I thought that I loved thee , Mahbub . Therefore I went to Umballa , as thou knowest , but and this thou dost not know I lay hid in the garden - grass to see what Colonel Creighton Sahib might do upon reading the white stallion 's pedigree . '
60760	60766	60768	60768	Kim	344	' And what did he ? '
60775	60789	60790	60790	Kim	344	' Dost thou give news for love , or dost thou sell it ? '
60793	60801	60790	60790	Kim	344	' I sell and - I buy . '
60818	60821	60823	60823	Kim	344	' Eight ! '
60843	60874	60834	60834	Mahbub	383	' It is too easy to deal in that market , Friend of all the World . Tell me for love . Our lives lie in each other 's hand . '
60875	60934	60802	60802	Mahbub	383	' Very good . I saw the Jang - i - Lat Sahib the Commander - in - Chief come to a big dinner . I saw him in Creighton Sahib 's office . I saw the two read the white stallion 's pedigree . I heard the very orders given for the opening of a great war . '
60935	60938	60939	60939	Mahbub	383	' Hah ! '
60946	60983	60939	60939	Mahbub	383	' The game is well played . That war is done now , and the evil , we hope , nipped before the flower - thanks to me - and thee . What didst thou later ? '
60984	61059	60802	60802	Mahbub	383	' I made the news as it were a hook to catch me victual and honour among the villagers in a village whose priest drugged my lama . But I bore away the old man 's purse , and the Brahmin found nothing . So next morning he was angry . Ho ! Ho ! And I also used the news when I fell into the hands of that white Regiment with their Bull ! '
61060	61065	61066	61066	Mahbub	383	' That was foolishness . '
61069	61090	61066	61066	Mahbub	383	' News is not meant to be thrown about like dung - cakes , but used sparingly - like bhang . '
61091	61115	61116	61116	he	383	' So I think now , and moreover , it did me no sort of good . But that was very long ago , '
61130	61153	60802	60802	Mahbub	383	' and since then , and especially in the nights under the punkah at the madrissah , I have thought very greatly . '
61154	61171	61173	61173	Mahbub	383	' Is it permitted to ask whither the Heaven - born 's thought might have led ? '
61185	61190	61192	61192	Kim	344	' It is permitted , '
61201	61221	61192	61192	Kim	344	' They say at Nucklao that no Sahib must tell a black man that he has made a fault . '
61236	61239	61233	61238	a Pathan a ' black man	6192	' black man '
61254	61264	61249	61249	he	383	' Speak , Sahib . Thy black man hears . '
61265	61268	61270	61270	Kim	344	' But , '
61272	61369	61270	61270	Kim	344	' I am not a Sahib , and I say I made a fault to curse thee , Mahbub Ali , on that day at Umballa when I thought I was betrayed by a Pathan . I was senseless ; for I was but newly caught , and I wished to kill that low - caste drummer - boy . I say now , Hajji , that it was well done ; and I see my road all clear before me to a good service . I will stay in the madrissah till I am ripe . '
61370	61402	61490	61491	the Colonel	757	' Well said . Especially are distances and numbers and the manner of using compasses to be learned in that game . One waits in the Hills above to show thee . '
61403	61436	61270	61270	Kim	344	' I will learn their teaching upon a condition - that my time is given to me without question when the madrissah is shut . Ask that for me of the Colonel . '
61437	61447	61270	61270	Kim	344	' But why not ask the Colonel in the Sahibs '
61450	61451	61270	61270	Kim	344	' '
61556	61557	61553	61553	I	0	' '
61570	61571	61553	61553	I	0	' '
61578	61608	61553	61553	I	0	' said Kim , waving his paw round the little clay - walled room where the oil - lamp in its niche burned heavily through the tobacco - smoke . '
61628	61629	61624	61624	I	0	' '
61637	61642	61624	61624	I	0	' said Mahbub ruefully . '
61659	61714	61624	61624	I	0	' hooves , and it must suffice for many days . As to all the rest , I am well pleased , and no further talk is needed . Make haste to learn , and in three years , or it may be less , thou wilt be an aid - even to me . '
61715	61725	61727	61727	Kim	344	' Have I been such a hindrance till now ? '
61735	61741	61727	61727	Kim	344	' Do not give answers , '
61745	61775	61742	61742	Mahbub	383	' Thou art my new horse - boy . Go and bed among my men . They are near the north end of the station , with the horses . '
61776	61794	61795	61795	Mahbub	383	' They will beat me to the south end of the station if I come without authority . '
61843	61858	61742	61742	Mahbub	383	' That is enough to show my headman . I come in the morning . '
61859	61864	61866	61866	Kim	344	' By which road ? '
61868	61896	61866	61866	Kim	344	' By the road from the city . There is but one , and then we return to Creighton Sahib . I have saved thee a beating . '
61897	61914	61915	61915	Kim	344	' Allah ! What is a beating when the very head is loose on the shoulders ? '
62055	62066	62068	62068	Kim	344	' The Hajji has of his favour given me service , '
62071	62093	62068	62068	Kim	344	' If this be doubted , wait till he comes in the morning . Meantime , a place by the fire . '
62227	62233	62234	62234	he	344	' I am very old , '
62238	62319	62234	62234	he	344	' Every month I become a year more old . I was very young , and a fool to boot , when I took Mahbub 's message to Umballa . Even when I was with that white Regiment I was very young and small and had no wisdom . But now I learn every day , and in three years the Colonel will take me out of the madrissah and let me go upon the Road with Mahbub hunting for horses '
62364	62411	62412	62412	He	868	' The thoughts came more slowly and disconnectedly . He was plunging into a beautiful dreamland when his ears caught a whisper , thin and sharp , above the monotonous babble round the fire . It came from behind the iron - skinned horse - truck . '
62419	62420	62412	62412	He	868	' '
62451	62452	62445	62445	He	868	' '
62470	62471	62473	62474	some woman	2804	' '
62492	62493	62495	62496	the woman	766	' '
62512	62513	62495	62496	the woman	766	' '
62540	62541	62545	62545	Peshawur	55	' '
62547	62553	62545	62545	Peshawur	55	' the second voice sneered . '
62588	62589	62581	62581	Jehannum	407	' '
62596	62597	62598	62599	O fool	2807	' '
62677	62678	62668	62668	thou	2809	' '
62681	62691	62668	62668	thou	2809	' thought Kim , behind close - shut eyes . '
62780	62787	62788	62788	I	0	' - he giggled almost aloud - '
62838	62866	62833	62834	a man	750	' He threw the blanket off his face , and raised himself suddenly with the terrible , bubbling , meaningless yell of the Asiatic roused by nightmare . '
62893	63087	62890	62891	The churel	2817	' A churel is the peculiarly malignant ghost of a woman who has died in child - bed . She haunts lonely roads , her feet are turned backwards on the ankles , and she leads men to torment . Louder rose Kim 's quavering howl , till at last he leaped to his feet and staggered off sleepily , while the camp cursed him for waking them . Some twenty yards farther up the line he lay down again , taking care that the whisperers should hear his grunts and groans as he recomposed himself . After a few minutes he rolled towards the road and stole away into the thick darkness . He paddled along swiftly till he came to a culvert , and dropped behind it , his chin on a level with the coping - stone . Here he could command all the night - traffic , himself unseen . Two or three carts passed , jingling out to the suburbs ; a coughing policeman and a hurrying foot - passenger or two who sang to keep off evil spirits . Then rapped the shod feet of a horse . '
63096	63112	63094	63094	Mahbub	383	' thought Kim , as the beast shied at the little head above the culvert . '
63114	63119	63120	63120	he	2819	' , Mahbub Ali , '
63123	63128	63120	63120	he	2819	' have a care ! '
63145	63149	63151	63151	Mahbub	383	' Never again , '
63153	63176	63177	63177	He	383	' will I take a shod horse for night- work . They pick up all the bones and nails in the city . '
63196	63202	63203	63203	he	383	' Down - keep down , '
63206	63214	63203	63203	he	383	' The night is full of eyes . '
63215	63253	63151	63151	Mahbub	383	' Two men wait thy coming behind the horse - trucks . They will shoot thee at thy lying down , because there is a price on thy head . I heard , sleeping near the horses . '
63254	63268	63203	63203	he	383	' Didst thou see them ? ... Hold still , Sire of Devils ! '
63275	63278	63203	63203	he	383	' No . '
63279	63288	63151	63151	Mahbub	383	' Was one dressed belike as a fakir ? '
63289	63312	63151	63151	Mahbub	383	' One said to the other , " What manner of fakir art thou , to shiver at a little watching ? " '
63313	63331	63332	63332	Mahbub	383	' Good . Go back to the camp and lie down . I do not die tonight . '
63374	63380	63381	63381	he	344	' At least Mahbub knows , '
63385	63409	63381	63381	he	344	' And certainly he spoke as one expecting it . I do not think those two men will profit by tonight 's watch . '
63616	63625	63626	63626	he	383	' The English do eternally tell the truth , '
63629	63715	63626	63626	he	383	' therefore we of this country are eternally made foolish . By Allah , I will tell the truth to an Englishman ! Of what use is the Government police if a poor Kabuli be robbed of his horses in their very trucks . This is as bad as Peshawur ! I should lay a complaint at the station . Better still , some young Sahib on the Railway ! They are zealous , and if they catch thieves it is remembered to their honour . '
63732	63737	63739	63752	a young Assistant District Traffic Superintendent who was waiting to go down the line	2830	' Hullo , Mahbub Ali '
63767	63779	63754	63765	a tall , tow- haired , horsey youth in dingy white linen	2831	' What are you doing here ? Selling weeds - eh ? '
63780	63820	63739	63752	a young Assistant District Traffic Superintendent who was waiting to go down the line	2830	' No ; I am not troubled for my horses . I come to look for Lutuf Ullah . I have a truck - load up the line . Could anyone take them out without the Railway 's knowledge ? '
63821	63838	63754	63765	a tall , tow- haired , horsey youth in dingy white linen	2831	' Should n't think so , Mahbub . You can claim against us if they do . '
63839	63881	63754	63765	a tall , tow- haired , horsey youth in dingy white linen	2831	' I have seen two men crouching under the wheels of one of the trucks nearly all night . Fakirs do not steal horses , so I gave them no more thought . I would find Lutuf Ullah , my partner . '
63882	63898	63739	63752	a young Assistant District Traffic Superintendent who was waiting to go down the line	2830	' The deuce you did ? And you did n't bother your head about it ? '
63921	63922	63916	63916	they	2833	' '
63972	63973	63969	63970	Lutuf Ullah	381	' '

64005	64006	63998	63998	they	2839	' '
64014	64015	63998	63998	they	2839	' '
64057	64099	64100	64100	They	2845	' The boy had hurried off to wake up a young and enthusiastic policeman ; for , as he said , the Railway had suffered much from depredations in the goods - yard . Mahbub Ali chuckled in his dyed beard . '
64134	64175	64176	64176	I	0	' He waited idly for a few minutes , expecting to see them hurry up the line girt for action . A light engine slid through the station , and he caught a glimpse of young Barton in the cab . '
64190	64195	64183	64183	He	2848	' said Mahbub Ali . '
64210	64270	64183	64183	He	2848	' When Mahbub Ali came to his camp in the dawn , no one thought it worth while to tell him any news of the night . No one , at least , but one small horseboy , newly advanced to the great man 's service , whom Mahbub called to his tiny tent to assist in some packing . '
64278	64286	64183	64183	He	2848	' whispered Kim , bending above saddlebags . '
64379	64398	64366	64367	one man	2857	' Kim meant the conjoined black - buck horns , which are a fakir 's sole temporal weapon - '
64440	64447	64432	64432	They	2852	' Mahbub smiled with heavenly resignation . '
64492	64493	64484	64484	thou	2862	' '
64535	64536	64537	64537	I	0	' '
64617	64803	64606	64606	We	2870	' Swiftly - as Orientals understand speed - with long explanations , with abuse and windy talk , carelessly , amid a hundred checks for little things forgotten , the untidy camp broke up and led the half- dozen stiff and fretful horses along the Kalka road in the fresh of the rain - swept dawn . Kim , regarded as Mahbub Ali 's favourite by all who wished to stand well with the Pathan , was not called upon to work . They strolled on by the easiest of stages , halting every few hours at a wayside shelter . Very many Sahibs travel along the Kalka road ; and , as Mahbub Ali says , every young Sahib must needs esteem himself a judge of a horse , and , though he be over head in debt to the money - lender , must make as if to buy . That was the reason that Sahib after Sahib , rolling along in a stage - carriage , would stop and open talk . Some would even descend from their vehicles and feel the horses '
64825	64856	64857	64857	Mahbub	383	' When first I dealt with Sahibs , and that was when Colonel Soady Sahib was Governor of Fort Abazai and flooded the Commissioner 's camping - ground for spite , '
64871	64892	64894	64894	he	383	' I did not know how greatly they were fools , and this made me wroth . As thus - , '
64915	64922	64924	64924	he	383	' Now I see , however , '
64929	64995	64924	64924	he	383	' that it is with them as with all men - in certain matters they are wise , and in others most foolish . Very foolish it is to use the wrong word to a stranger ; for though the heart may be clean of offence , how is the stranger to know that ? He is more like to search truth with a dagger . '
64996	65002	65004	65004	Kim	344	' True . True talk , '
65007	65029	65004	65004	Kim	344	' Fools speak of a cat when a woman is brought to bed , for instance . I have heard them . '
65030	65074	65075	65075	He	383	' Therefore , in one situate as thou art , it particularly behoves thee to remember this with both kinds of faces . Among Sahibs , never forgetting thou art a Sahib ; among the folk of Hind , always remembering thou art - '
65083	65103	65075	65075	He	383	' What am I ? Mussalman , Hindu , Jain , or Buddhist ? That is a hard knot . '
65104	65291	64924	64924	he	383	' Thou art beyond question an unbeliever , and therefore thou wilt be damned . So says my Law - or I think it does . But thou art also my Little Friend of all the World , and I love thee . So says my heart . This matter of creeds is like horseflesh . The wise man knows horses are good - that there is a profit to be made from all ; and for myself - but that I am a good Sunni and hate the men of Tirah - I could believe the same of all the Faiths . Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare taken from the sands of her birthplace and removed to the west of Bengal founders - nor is even a Balkh stallion and there are no better horses than those of Balkh , were they not so heavy in the shoulder of any account in the great Northern deserts beside the snow - camels I have seen . Therefore I say in my heart the Faiths are like the horses . Each has merit in its own country . '
65292	65302	65004	65004	Kim	344	' But my lama said altogether a different thing . '
65303	65342	65075	65075	He	383	' Oh , he is an old dreamer of dreams from Bhotiyal . My heart is a little angry , Friend of all the World , that thou shouldst see such worth in a man so little known . '
65343	65365	64924	64924	he	383	' It is true , Hajji ; but that worth do I see , and to him my heart is drawn . '

Shout Gul Sher Khan yonder to drive in that bay stallion 's pickets more firmly . We do not want a horse- fight at every resting - stage , and the dun and the black will be locked in a little ... Now hear me . Is it necessary to the comfort of thy heart to see that lama ? '

But it was all pure delight - the wandering road , climbing , dipping , and sweeping about the growing spurs ; the flush of the morning laid along the distant snows ; the branched cacti , tier upon tier on the stony hillsides ; the voices of a thousand water - channels ; the chatter of the monkeys ; the solemn deodars , climbing one after another with down - drooped branches ; the vista of the Plains rolled out far beneath them ; the incessant twanging of the tonga - horns and the wild rush of the led horses when a tonga swung round a curve ; the halts for prayers Mahbub was very religious in dry - washings and bellowings when time did not press ; the evening conferences by the halting - places , when camels and bullocks chewed solemnly together and the stolid drivers told the news of the Road - all these things lifted Kim 's heart to song within him .

Here , too , Mahbub Ali rented a room , much more securely locked than his bulkhead at Lahore , in the house of a Mohammedan cattle - dealer .

68052	68092	68093	68094	Lurgan Sahib	539	' From the darkness he fancied he could hear the echo of a chuckle . It could not be his soft - fleshed companion , because he was weeping . So Kim lifted up his voice and called aloud : '
68113	68114	68105	68106	thy servant	2925	' '
68120	68131	68105	68106	thy servant	2925	' The voice came from behind him and he started . '

68163	68289	68157	68157	I	0	' That was no cheerful night ; the room being overfull of voices and music . Kim was waked twice by someone calling his name . The second time he set out in search , and ended by bruising his nose against a box that certainly spoke with a human tongue , but in no sort of human accent . It seemed to end in a tin trumpet and to be joined by wires to a smaller box on the floor - so far , at least , as he could judge by touch . And the voice , very hard and whirring , came out of the trumpet . Kim rubbed his nose and grew furious , thinking , as usual , in Hindi . '
68329	68336	68337	68341	a boy of St Xavier	2932	' here he turned to English , '

68442	68502	68522	68522	Chup	545	' The trumpet - box was pouring out a string of the most elaborate abuse that even Kim had ever heard , in a high uninterested voice , that for a moment lifted the short hairs of his neck . When the vile thing drew breath , Kim was reassured by the soft , sewing - machine- like whirr . '
68507	68521	68522	68522	Chup	545	' he cried , and again he heard a chuckle that decided him . '
68530	68671	68525	68525	I	0	' The box took no heed . Kim wrenched at the tin trumpet and something lifted with a click . He had evidently raised a lid . If there were a devil inside , now was its time , for - he sniffed -thus did the sewing - machines of the bazar smell . He would clean that shaitan . He slipped off his jacket , and plunged it into the box 's mouth . Something long and round bent under the pressure , there was a whirr and the voice stopped - as voices must if you ram a thrice - doubled coat on to the wax cylinder and into the works of an expensive phonograph . Kim finished his slumbers with a serene mind . In the morning he was aware of Lurgan Sahib looking down on him . '
68674	68688	68525	68525	I	0	' said Kim , firmly resolved to cling to his Sahib - dom . '

68783	68878	68879	68879	I	0	' Kim looked him over out of the corners of his eyes . He was a Sahib in that he wore Sahib 's clothes ; the accent of his Urdu , the intonation of his English , showed that he was anything but a Sahib . He seemed to understand what moved in Kim 's mind ere the boy opened his mouth , and he took no pains to explain himself as did Father Victor or the Lucknow masters . Sweetest of all - he treated Kim as an equal on the Asiatic side . '
68951	69012	68940	68940	He	5796	' Now a genuine imported Sahib from England would have made a great to - do over this tale . Lurgan Sahib stated it as simply as Mahbub Ali was used to record his little affairs in the North . The back veranda of the shop was built out over the sheer hillside , and they looked down into their neighbours '

69391	69472	69473	69473	He	539	' There is no one but me can doctor a sick pearl and re - blue turquoises . I grant you opals - any fool can cure an opal - but for a sick pearl there is only me . Suppose I were to die ! Then there would be no one ... Oh no ! You can not do anything with jewels . It will be quite enough if you understand a little about the Turquoise - some day . '

69632	69639	69562	69562	Kim	344	' I said it would break . '
69640	69654	69562	69562	Kim	344	' All one . Look at it . Look at the largest piece . '

70185	70256	70167	70167	Kim	344	' No , that was not magic . It was only to see if there was - a flaw in a jewel . Sometimes very fine jewels will fly all to pieces if a man holds them in his hand , and knows the proper way . That is why one must be careful before one sets them . Tell me , did you see the shape of the pot ? '
70257	70274	70376	70377	Lurgan Sahib	539	' For a little time . It began to grow like a flower from the ground . '

70292	70318	70167	70167	Kim	344	' Oah ! I knew it was broken , and so , I think , that was what I thought - and it was broken . '
70319	70335	70376	70377	Lurgan Sahib	539	' Hm ! Has anyone ever done that same sort of magic to you before ? '

71756	71772	71722	71722	he	2990	' The Hindu boy , in highest feather , actually patted Kim on the back . '
71777	71781	71722	71722	he	2990	' he said . '
71788	71789	71782	71782	I	0	' '
71800	71811	71791	71791	I	0	' said Lurgan Sahib , still speaking in the vernacular , '
71891	72365	71885	71885	I	0	' They were a most mad ten days , but Kim enjoyed himself too much to reflect on their craziness . In the morning they played the Jewel Game - sometimes with veritable stones , sometimes with piles of swords and daggers , sometimes with photo - graphs of natives . Through the afternoons he and the Hindu boy would mount guard in the shop , sitting dumb behind a carpet - bale or a screen and watching Mr Lurgan 's many and very curious visitors . There were small Rajahs , escorts coughing in the veranda , who came to buy curiosities - such as phonographs and mechanical toys . There were ladies in search of necklaces , and men , it seemed to Kim - but his mind may have been vitiated by early training - in search of the ladies ; natives from independent and feudatory Courts whose ostensible business was the repair of broken necklaces - rivers of light poured out upon the table - but whose true end seemed to be to raise money for angry Maharanees or young Rajahs . There were Babus to whom Lurgan Sahib talked with austerity and authority , but at the end of each interview he gave them money in coined silver and currency notes . There were occasional gatherings of long - coated theatrical natives who discussed metaphysics in English and Bengali , to Mr Lurgan 's great edification . He was always interested in religions . At the end of the day , Kim and the Hindu boy - whose name varied at Lurgan 's pleasure - were expected to give a detailed account of all that they had seen and heard - their view of each man 's character , as shown in his face , talk , and manner , and their notions of his real errand . After dinner , Lurgan Sahib 's fancy turned more to what might be called dressing - up , in which game he took a most informing interest . He could paint faces to a marvel ; with a brush - dab here and a line there changing them past recognition . The shop was full of all manner of dresses and turbans , and Kim was apparelled variously as a young Mohammedan of good family , an oilman , and once - which was a joyous evening - as the son of an Oudh landholder in the fullest of full dress . Lurgan Sahib had a hawk 's eye to detect the least flaw in the make - up ; and lying on a worn teak - wood couch , would explain by the half - hour together how such and such a caste talked , or walked , or coughed , or spat , or sneezed , and , since '
72368	72376	71885	71885	I	0	' matter little in this world , the '
72378	72587	72588	72588	I	0	' of everything . The Hindu child played this game clumsily . That little mind , keen as an icicle where tally of jewels was concerned , could not temper itself to enter another 's soul ; but a demon in Kim woke up and sang with joy as he put on the changing dresses , and changed speech and gesture therewith . Carried away by enthusiasm , he volunteered to show Lurgan Sahib one evening how the disciples of a certain caste of fakir , old Lahore acquaintances , begged doles by the roadside ; and what sort of language he would use to an Englishman , to a Punjabi farmer going to a fair , and to a woman without a veil . Lurgan Sahib laughed immensely , and begged Kim to stay as he was , immobile for half an hour - cross - legged , ash - smeared , and wild - eyed , in the back room . At the end of that time entered a hulking , obese Babu whose stockinged legs shook with fat , and Kim opened on him with a shower of wayside chaff . Lurgan Sahib - this annoyed Kim - watched the Babu and not the play . '
72591	72601	72588	72588	I	0	' said the Babu heavily , lighting a cigarette , '
72653	72654	72647	72647	I	0	' '

72681	72718	72679	72679	Lurgan	539	' The Babu swung out with the gait of a bogged cow . When they were telling over the day 's list of visitors , Lurgan Sahib asked Kim who he thought the man might be . '
72722	72747	72719	72719	God	360	' said Kim cheerily . The tone might almost have deceived Mahbub Ali , but it failed entirely with the healer of sick pearls . '
72766	72783	72784	72784	I	0	' Kim glanced sideways at his companion , whose eye had a way of compelling truth . '
72800	72810	72786	72786	I	0	' - confidentially , as Lurgan Sahib nodded approval - '
72826	72827	72816	72816	he	0	' '

72985	72990	72969	72970	that boy	2413	' said Kim promptly . '
73005	73006	72969	72970	that boy	2413	' '
73024	73036	72969	72970	that boy	2413	' He smiled merrily at Lurgan 's Sahib 's very beard . '
73072	73073	72969	72970	that boy	2413	' '

73309	73317	73294	73297	a chain - man	5919	' - Kim started at the title . '
73355	73367	73351	73353	the Colonel Sahib	393	' Then , changing suddenly into English with a deep laugh : '
73433	73439	73413	73414	the English	346	' Kim 's face fell . '
73456	73517	73448	73448	I	0	' Four days later a seat was booked for Kim and his small trunk at the rear of a Kalka tonga . His companion was the whale - like Babu , who , with a fringed shawl wrapped round his head , and his fat openwork- stockinged left leg tucked under him , shivered and grunted in the morning chill . '
73529	73677	73522	73523	this man	937	' thought Kim considering the jelly back as they jolted down the road ; and the reflection threw him into most pleasant day - dreams . Lurgan Sahib had given him five rupees - a splendid sum - as well as the assurance of his protection if he worked . Unlike Mahbub , Lurgan Sahib had spoken most explicitly of the reward that would follow obedience , and Kim was content . If only , like the Babu , he could enjoy the dignity of a letter and a number - and a price upon his head ! Some day he would be all that and more . Some day he might be almost as great as Mahbub Ali ! The housetops of his search should be half India ; he would follow Kings and Ministers , as in the old days he had followed vakils and lawyers '
73914	73927	73929	73929	his	3024	' So I should lose Delhi for the sake of a fish , '
74296	74337	74291	74292	Hurree Chunder	551	' he might still tread his distances . To keep count of thousands of paces , Hurree Chunder 's experience had shown him nothing more valuable than a rosary of eighty - one or a hundred and eight beads , for '
74352	74431	74432	74432	I	0	' . Through the volleying drifts of English , Kim caught the general trend of the talk , and it interested him very much . Here was a new craft that a man could tuck away in his head and by the look of the large wide world unfolding itself before him , it seemed that the more a man knew the better for him . Said the Babu when he had talked for an hour and a half '
74477	74515	74453	74453	I	0	' It was a cheap , heart - shaped brass thing with three compartments for carrying the eternal betel - nut , lime and pan - leaf ; but it was filled with little tabloid - bottles . '
74616	74847	74606	74606	I	0	' He slipped out noiselessly as a cat , on the Umballa road , hailed a passing cart and jingled away , while Kim , tongue - tied , twiddled the brass betel - box in his hands . The record of a boy 's education interests few save his parents , and , as you know , Kim was an orphan . It is written in the books of St Xavier 's in Partibus that a report of Kim 's progress was forwarded at the end of each term to Colonel Creighton and to Father Victor , from whose hands duly came the money for his schooling . It is further recorded in the same books that he showed a great aptitude for mathematical studies as well as map - making , and carried away a prize The Life of Lord Lawrence , tree - calf , two vols . , nine rupees , eight annas for proficiency therein ; and the same term played in St Xavier 's eleven against the Alighur Mohammedan College , his age being fourteen years and ten months . He was also re - vaccinated from which we may assume that there had been another epidemic of smallpox at Lucknow about the same time . Pencil notes on the edge of an old muster - roll record that he was punished several times for '
74852	74866	74868	74868	himself	3049	' , and it seems that he was once sentenced to heavy pains for '
74879	75001	74868	74868	himself	3049	' . That was when he got over the gate and pleaded with the lama through a whole day down the banks of the Gumti to accompany him on the Road next holidays - for one month - for a little week ; and the lama set his face as a flint against it , averring that the time had not yet come . Kim 's business , said the old man as they ate cakes together , was to get all the wisdom of the Sahibs and then he would see . The Hand of Friendship must in some way have averted the Whip of Calamity , for six weeks later Kim seems to have passed an examination in elementary surveying '
75005	75051	74868	74868	himself	3049	' , his age being fifteen years and eight months . From this date the record is silent . His name does not appear in the year 's batch of those who entered for the subordinate Survey of India , but against it stand the words '
75056	75429	75436	75436	Devadatta	429	' Several times in those three years , cast up at the Temple of the Tirthankars in Benares the lama , a little thinner and a shade yellower , if that were possible , but gentle and untainted as ever . Sometimes it was from the South that he came - from south of Tuticorin , whence the wonderful fire - boats go to Ceylon where are priests who know Pali ; sometimes it was from the wet green West and the thousand cotton - factory chimneys that ring Bombay ; and once from the North , where he had doubled back eight hundred miles to talk for a day with the Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House . He would stride to his cell in the cool , cut marble - the priests of the Temple were good to the old man , - wash off the dust of travel , make prayer , and depart for Lucknow , well accustomed now to the way of the rail , in a third - class carriage . Returning , it was noticeable , as his friend the Seeker pointed out to the head - priest , that he ceased for a while to mourn the loss of his River , or to draw wondrous pictures of the Wheel of Life , but preferred to talk of the beauty and wisdom of a certain mysterious chela whom no man of the Temple had ever seen . Yes , he had followed the traces of the Blessed Feet throughout all India . The Curator has still in his possession a most marvellous account of his wanderings and meditations . There remained nothing more in life but to find the River of the Arrow . Yet it was shown to him in dreams that it was a matter not to be undertaken with any hope of success unless that seeker had with him the one chela appointed to bring the event to a happy issue , and versed in great wisdom - such wisdom as white - haired Keepers of Images possess . For example here came out the snuff - gourd , and the kindly Jain priests made haste to be silent : '
75690	75820	75822	75822	he	3058	' Then one day the young elephant saw the half - buried iron , and turning to the elder said : " What is this ? " " It is even my sorrow , " said he who had befriended him . Then that other put out his trunk and in the twinkling of an eyelash abolished the ring , saying : " The appointed time has come . " So the virtuous elephant who had waited temperately and done kind acts was relieved , at the appointed time , by the very calf whom he had turned aside to cherish - let all listen to the Tataka ! for the Elephant was Ananda , and the Calf that broke the ring was none other than The Lord Himself ...

76110	76116	76118	76119	the lama	868	' That may not be , '
76121	76131	76118	76119	the lama	868	' He has gone back to his own people . '
76132	76147	76148	76149	his host	2953	' He sat in that corner telling a hundred merry tales five nights ago , '
76152	76195	76148	76149	his host	2953	' True , he vanished somewhat suddenly in the dawn after foolish talk with my granddaughter . He grows apace , but he is the same Friend of the Stars as brought me true word of the war . Have ye parted ? '
76196	76202	76203	76204	the lama	868	' Yes - and no , '
76207	76241	76203	76204	the lama	868	' We - we have not altogether parted , but the time is not ripe that we should take the Road together . He acquires wisdom in another place . We must wait . '
76242	76264	76148	76149	his host	2953	' All one - but if it were not the boy how did he come to speak so continually of thee ? '
76265	76271	76273	76274	the lama	868	' And what said he ? '
76277	76311	76273	76274	the lama	868	' Sweet words - an hundred thousand - that thou art his father and mother and such all . Pity that he does not take the Qpeen 's service . He is fearless . '
76342	76354	76356	76358	the horse- dealer	5835	' There is no holding the young pony from the game , '
76374	76431	76356	76358	the horse- dealer	5835	' If permission be refused to go and come as he chooses , he will make light of the refusal . Then who is to catch him ? Colonel Sahib , only once in a thousand years is a horse born so well fitted for the game as this our colt . And we need men . '
76463	76903	76904	76905	That soldier	3100	' the air . Faith ! were he mine As mine 's the glove he binds to for his tirings I 'd fly him with a make - hawk . He 's in yarak Plumed to the very point - so manned , so weathered ... Give him the firmament God made him for , And what shall take the air of him ? Gow 's Watch Lurgan Sahib did not use as direct speech , but his advice tallied with Mahbub 's ; and the upshot was good for Kim . He knew better now than to leave Lucknow city in native garb , and if Mahbub were anywhere within reach of a letter , it was to Mahbub 's camp he headed , and made his change under the Pathan 's wary eye . Could the little Survey paint - box that he used for map - tinting in term- time have found a tongue to tell of holiday doings , he might have been expelled . Once Mahbub and he went together as far as the beautiful city of Bombay , with three truckloads of tram - horses , and Mahbub nearly melted when Kim proposed a sail in a dhow across the Indian Ocean to buy Gulf Arabs , which , he understood from a hanger- on of the dealer Abdul Rahman , fetched better prices than mere Kabulis . He dipped his hand into the dish with that great trader when Mahbub and a few co - religionists were invited to a big Haj dinner . They came back by way of Karachi by sea , when Kim took his first experience of sea - sickness sitting on the fore - hatch of a coasting- steamer , well persuaded he had been poisoned . The Babu 's famous drug - box proved useless , though Kim had restocked it at Bombay . Mahbub had business at Quetta , and there Kim , as Mahbub admitted , earned his keep , and perhaps a little over , by spending four curious days as scullion in the house of a fat Commissariat sergeant , from whose office - box , in an auspicious moment , he removed a little vellum ledger which he copied out - it seemed to deal entirely with cattle and camel sales - by moonlight , lying behind an outhouse , all through one hot night . Then he returned the ledger to its place , and , at Mahbub 's word , left that service unpaid , rejoining him six miles down the road , the clean copy in his bosom . '
76911	76916	76904	76905	That soldier	3100	' Mahbub Ali explained , '
76953	76954	76945	76945	I	0	' '

77030	77499	77017	77017	one	1164	' said Kim , and held his tongue . That was in the monsoon holidays , after he had taken the prize for mathematics . The Christmas holidays he spent - deducting ten days for private amusements - with Lurgan Sahib , where he sat for the most part in front of a roaring wood - fire - Jakko road was four feet deep in snow that year - and - the small Hindu had gone away to be married - helped Lurgan to thread pearls . He made Kim learn whole chapters of the Koran by heart , till he could deliver them with the very roll and cadence of a mullah . Moreover , he told Kim the names and properties of many native drugs , as well as the runes proper to recite when you administer them . And in the evenings he wrote charms on parchment - elaborate pentagrams crowned with the names of devils - Murra , and Awan the Companion of Kings - all fantastically written in the corners . More to the point , he advised Kim as to the care of his own body , the cure of fever - fits , and simple remedies of the Road . A week before it was time to go down , Colonel Creighton Sahib - this was unfair - sent Kim a written examination paper that concerned itself solely with rods and chains and links and angles . Next holidays he was out with Mahbub , and here , by the way , he nearly died of thirst , plodding through the sand on a camel to the mysterious city of Bikanir , where the wells are four hundred feet deep , and lined throughout with camel - bone . It was not an amusing trip from Kim 's point of view , because - in defiance of the contract - the Colonel ordered him to make a map of that wild , walled city ; and since Mohammedan horse - boys and pipe - tenders are not expected to drag Survey - chains round the capital of an independent Native State , Kim was forced to pace all his distances by means of a bead rosary . He used the compass for bearings as occasion served - after dark chiefly , when the camels had been fed - and by the help of his little Survey paint - box of six colour - cakes and three brushes , he achieved something not remotely unlike the city of Jeysulmir . Mahbub laughed a great deal , and advised him to make up a written report as well ; and in the back of the big account - book that lay under the flap of Mahbub 's pet saddle Kim fell to work .. '

Kim translated it , sweating under the light of an oil - lamp , to Mahbub , the second day of their return - journey . The Pathan rose and stooped over his dappled saddle - bags . '

There was a Delhi embroidered waistcoat to slip over a milky white shirt , fastening to the right , ample and flowing ; green pyjamas with twisted silk waist - string ; and that nothing might be lacking , russia - leather slippers , smelling divinely , with arrogantly curled tips .

The folly of the Sahibs has neither top nor bottom . No matter . Maybe thy written report shall save thee further bondage ; and God He knows we need men more and more in the Game . '

78831	78987	78826	78827	a man	750	' said Creighton . It was a wry - necked matter of unauthorized and incendiary correspondence between a person who claimed to be the ultimate authority in all matters of the Mohammedan religion throughout the world , and a younger member of a royal house who had been brought to book for kidnapping women within British territory . The Moslem Archbishop had been emphatic and over - arrogant ; the young prince was merely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges , but there was no need he should continue a correspondence which might some day compromise him . One letter indeed had been procured , but the finder was later found dead by the roadside in the habit of an Arab trader , as E.23 , taking up the work , duly reported . These facts , and a few others not to be published , made both Mahbub and Creighton shake their heads . '

79372	79407	79356	79357	an FRS	3155	' Oh , very indeed - we have had some pleasant evenings at my little place - but I think it would be waste to throw him away with Hurree on the Ethnological side . '
79408	79445	79352	79352	he	400	' Not for a first experience . How does that strike you , Mahbub ? Let the boy run with the lama for six months . After that we can see . He will get experience . '
79446	79479	79352	79352	he	400	' He has it already , Sahib - as a fish controls the water he swims in . But for every reason it will be well to loose him from the school . '

79939	79977	79861	79861	Mahbub	383	' Ye - es ; but first , he has nothing to tell ; and secondly , he knows what would happen . Also , he is very fond of Mahbub , and of me a little . '

It is great luck for you , for you are only sixteen ; but of course you understand that you do not become pukka permanent till you have passed the autumn examination . So you must not think you are going out into the world to enjoy yourself , or that your fortune is made . There is a great deal of hard work before you . Only , if you succeed in becoming pukka , you can rise , you know , to four hundred and fifty a month . '

Most true is it in the Great Game , for it is by means of women that all plans come to ruin and we lie out in the dawning with our throats cut . So it happened to such a one . '

No painting of a day or two . Also , we fortify thee against the chances of the Road . That is my gift to thee , my son . Take out all metals on thee and lay them here . Make ready , Huneefa . '

The Oswal , at peace with mankind , carried the message into the darkness behind him , and the easy , uncounted Eastern minutes slid by ; for the lama was asleep in his cell , and no priest would wake him . When the click of his rosary again broke the hush of the inner court where the calm images of the Arhats stand , a novice whispered , '
85741	85781	85736	85736	Thy	3294	' and the old man strode forth , forgetting the end of that prayer . Hardly had the tall figure shown in the doorway than the Jat ran before him , and , lifting up the child , cried : '
85801	85817	85798	85798	he	385	' He fumbled in his waist - belt and drew out a small silver coin . '
85822	85854	85736	85736	Thy	3294	' The lama 's eyes turned to Kim . It was noticeable he spoke far clearer Urdu than long ago , under ZamZammah ; but father would allow no private talk . '
85863	85867	85868	85869	The child	747	' said Kim . '
85875	85876	85877	85877	He	747	' '
85889	85890	85883	85884	his mother	727	' '
85903	85904	85900	85901	Holy One	385	' '
85917	86066	85908	85908	they	3299	' said the lama , and he sat down by the Jat upon the lowest step of the temple , while Kim , looking out of the corner of his eyes , slowly opened the little betel - box . He had dreamed dreams at school of returning to the lama as a Sahib - of chaffing the old man before he revealed himself - boy 's dreams all . There was more drama in this abstracted , brow- puckered search through the tabloid - bottles , with a pause here and there for thought and a muttered invocation between whiles . Quinine he had in tablets , and dark brown meat - lozenges - beef most probably , but that was not his business . The little thing would not eat , but it sucked at a lozenge greedily , and said it liked the salt taste . '
86072	86080	85908	85908	they	3299	' Kim handed them to the man . '
86105	86115	86161	86161	Gods	402	' it was the half of a quinine pill , '
86159	86160	86161	86161	Gods	402	' '
86166	86205	86161	86161	Gods	402	' said the Kamboh , snatching . It was as much as Kim could remember of his own treatment in a bout of autumn malaria - if you except the patter that he added to impress the lama . '
86215	86216	86161	86161	Gods	402	' '
86224	86236	86237	86237	My	0	' said the Jat , and threw back his sturdy shoulders . '
86279	86280	86281	86281	They	3306	' '
86288	86293	86285	86286	these Jats	606	' said Kim softly . '
86327	86344	86314	86314	he	601	' The Jat burst into a roar of laughter , stifled with apologies to the lama . '
86439	86469	86472	86473	the sick	5721	' He moved away , crooning and mumbling . The lama turned to Kim , and all the loving old soul of him looked out through his narrow eyes . '
86497	86498	86499	86499	I	0	' '
86509	86557	86506	86507	Holy One	385	' said Kim , forgetting the little play just ended ; forgetting St Xavier 's ; forgetting his white blood ; forgetting even the Great Game as he stooped , Mohammedan - fashion , to touch his master 's feet in the dust of the Jain temple . '
86590	86591	86585	86585	I	0	' '
86606	86622	86654	86655	a physician	3329	' They passed to the inner court , where the afternoon sun sloped golden across . '
86631	86636	86641	86642	a child	4501	' He peered critically . '
86689	86690	86685	86687	Zam - Zammah	343	' '
86693	86697	86685	86687	Zam - Zammah	343	' said Kim . '
86714	86715	86702	86702	I	0	' '
86759	86760	86754	86754	I	0	' '
86764	86768	86769	86769	I	0	' quoth Kim . '
86793	86799	86790	86791	Holy One	385	' he went on playfully . '
86810	86811	86803	86804	a Sahib	5596	' '
86829	86830	86807	86807	thy	3325	' '
86838	86843	86807	86807	thy	3325	' The lama smiled . '
86882	86909	86874	86874	I	0	' Colonel Creighton , who had succeeded to the trusteeship when Father Victor went to England with the Mavericks , was hardly the Chaplain 's brother . '
86917	86982	86983	86984	The lama	868	' letters . They must be interpreted to me . I chose a surer way . Many times when I returned from my Search to this Temple , which has always been a nest to me , there came one seeking Enlightenment - a man from Leh - that had been , he said , a Hindu , but wearied of all those Gods . '
86990	86995	86997	86997	Kim	344	' A fat man ? '
87005	87093	86997	86997	Kim	344	' Very fat ; but I perceived in a little his mind was wholly given up to useless things - such as devils and charms and the form and fashion of our tea - drinkings in the monasteries , and by what road we initiated the novices . A man abounding in questions ; but he was a friend of thine , chela . He told me that thou wast on the road to much honour as a scribe . And I see thou art a physician . '
87094	87132	87002	87002	his	344	' Yes , that am I - a scribe , when I am a Sahib , but it is set aside when I come as thy disciple . I have accomplished the years appointed for a Sahib . '
87133	87140	87142	87143	the lama	868	' As it were a novice ? '
87149	87164	87146	87146	his	868	' Art thou freed from the schools ? I would not have thee unripe . '
87165	87184	87002	87002	his	344	' I am all free . In due time I take service under the Government as a scribe - '
87185	87195	87002	87002	his	344	' Not as a warrior . That is well . '
87196	87219	87220	87220	he	868	' But first I come to wander with thee . Therefore I am here . Who begs for thee , these days ? '
87230	87302	87303	87303	He	868	' Very often I beg myself ; but , as thou knowest , I am seldom here , except when I come to look again at my disciple . From one end to another of Hind have I travelled afoot and in the te - rain . A great and a wonderful land ! But here , when I put in , is as though I were in my own Bhotiyal . '
87404	87424	87425	87425	he	868	' The Keeper of the Images in the Wonder House acquired merit by giving me these a year since , '
87433	87463	87464	87464	He	868	' When one is far from one 's own land such things carry remembrance ; and we must reverence the Lord for that He showed the Way . See ! '
87482	87551	87552	87552	He	868	' When I was Abbot in my own place - before I came to better knowledge I made that offering daily . It is the Sacrifice of the Universe to the Lord . Thus do we of Bhotiyal offer all the world daily to the Excellent Law . And I do it even now , though I know that the Excellent One is beyond all pinchings and pattings . '
87558	87567	87568	87568	Kim	344	' It is well done , Holy One , '
87584	87588	87589	87591	the old man	861	' And also , '
87594	87671	87672	87672	He	868	' I write pictures of the Wheel of Life . Three days to a picture . I was busied on it - or it may be I shut my eyes a little - when they brought word of thee . It is good to have thee here : I will show thee my art - not for pride 's sake , but because thou must learn . The Sahibs have not all this world 's wisdom . '
87832	87841	87843	87843	Kim	344	' I have a little learned to draw , '
87845	87854	87843	87843	Kim	344	' But this is a marvel beyond marvels . '
87855	87864	87866	87867	the lama	868	' I have written it for many years , '
87869	87909	87866	87867	the lama	868	' Time was when I could write it all between one lamp - lighting and the next . I will teach thee the art - after due preparation ; and I will show thee the meaning of the Wheel . '
87910	87918	87843	87843	Kim	344	' We take the Road , then ? '
87919	88050	88051	88051	He	3360	' The Road and our Search . I was but waiting for thee . It was made plain to me in a hundred dreams - notably one that came upon the night of the day that the Gates of Learning first shut that without thee I should never find my River . Again and again , as thou knowest , I put this from me , fearing an illusion . Therefore I would not take thee with me that day at Lucknow , when we ate the cakes . I would not take thee till the . time was ripe and auspicious . From the Hills to the Sea , from the Sea to the Hills have I gone , but it was vain . Then I remembered the Tataka . '
88077	88084	88085	88085	he	3360	' Further testimony is not needed , '
88089	88120	88085	88085	he	3360	' Thou wast sent for an aid . That aid removed , my Search came to naught . Therefore we will go out again together , and our Search sure . '
88121	88126	88051	88051	He	3360	' Whither go we ? '
88127	88236	88085	88085	he	3360	' What matters , Friend of all the World ? The Search , I say , is sure . If need be , the River will break from the ground before us . I acquired merit when I sent thee to the Gates of Learning , and gave thee the jewel that is Wisdom . Thou didst return , I saw even now , a follower of Sakyamuni , the Physician , whose altars are many in Bhotiyal . It is sufficient . We are together , and all things are as they were - Friend of all the World - Friend of the Stars - my chela ! '
88465	88480	88481	88481	he	868	' Holy One , there is the child to whom we gave the medicine , '
88507	88517	88481	88481	he	868	' The Jat will be here at the light . '
88518	88534	88535	88535	He	868	' I am well answered . In my haste I would have done a wrong . '
88547	88555	88556	88556	he	868	' Surely old folk are as children , '
88560	88639	88556	88556	he	868	' They desire a matter - behold , it must be done at once , or they fret and weep ! Many times when I was upon the Road I have been ready to stamp with my feet at the hindrance of an ox - cart in the way , or a mere cloud of dust . It was not so when I was a man - a long time ago . None the less it is wrongful - '
88640	88650	88481	88481	he	868	' But thou art indeed old , Holy One . '
88651	88716	88556	88556	he	868	' The thing was done . A Cause was put out into the world , and , old or young , sick or sound , knowing or unknowing , who can rein in the effect of that Cause ? Does the Wheel hang still if a child spin it - or a drunkard ? Chela , this is a great and a terrible world . '
88717	88723	88724	88724	Kim	344	' I think it good , '
88727	88742	88724	88724	Kim	344	' What is there to eat ? I have not eaten since yesterday even . '
88743	88759	88556	88556	he	868	' I had forgotten thy need . Yonder is good Bhotiyal tea and cold rice . '
88760	88770	88771	88771	Kim	344	' We can not walk far on such stuff . '
88831	88843	88844	88844	he	344	' In the night the fever broke and the sweat came , '
88847	88870	88871	88871	He	344	' Feel here - his skin is fresh and new ! He esteemed the salt lozenges , and took milk with greed . '
88953	88963	88964	88964	he	344	' Thank the Gods of the Jains , brother , '
88975	88982	88964	88964	he	344	' The fever is indeed broken . '
88983	88988	88989	88990	The lama	868	' Look ! See ! '
89002	89017	88989	88990	The lama	868	' Was there ever such a chela ? He follows our Lord the Healer . '
89117	89120	89122	89122	Kim	344	' Remember , '
89129	89136	89122	89122	Kim	344	' this trouble may come again . '
89137	89146	89148	89149	the father	3287	' Not if thou hast the proper spell , '
89151	89161	89148	89149	the father	3287	' But in a little while we go away . '
89162	89165	89167	89168	the lama	868	' True , '
89174	89221	89167	89168	the lama	868	' We go now together upon the Search whereof I have often spoken . I waited till my chela was ripe . Behold him ! We go North . Never again shall I look upon this place of my rest , O people of good will . '
89222	89230	89235	89235	his	4769	' But I am not a beggar . '
89242	89253	89254	89255	a priest	820	' Be still . Do not trouble the Holy One , '
89258	89261	89262	89262	Kim	344	' Go , '
89265	89308	89262	89262	Kim	344	' Meet us again under the big railway bridge , and for the sake of all the Gods of our Punjab , bring food - curry , pulse , cakes fried in fat , and sweetmeats . Specially sweetmeats . Be swift ! '
89518	89526	89527	89527	he	344	' But it is my own fault , '
89530	89593	89527	89527	he	344	' With Mahbub , I ate Mahbub 's bread , or Lurgan Sahib 's . At St Xavier 's , three meals a day . Here I must jolly - well look out for myself . Besides , I am not in good training . How I could eat a plate of beef now ! ... Is it finished , Holy One ? '
89609	89617	89619	89619	he	868	' I must lean on thy shoulder , '
89627	89635	89619	89619	he	868	' We grow stiff , I think . '
89679	89684	89685	89685	he	868	' Here we eat , '
89715	89722	89723	89723	he	868	' Fall to , Holy Ones ! '
89748	89773	89729	89729	They	3409	' Rice and good curry , cakes all warm and well scented with hing asafoetida , curds and sugar . King of my fields , '
89780	89813	89815	89815	he	868	' let us show these holy men that we Jats of Jullundur can pay a service ... I had heard the Jains would eat nothing that they had not cooked , but truly '
89824	89835	89815	89815	he	868	' where there is no eye there is no caste . '
89836	89840	89842	89842	Kim	344	' And we , '
89855	89861	89842	89842	Kim	344	' are beyond all castes . '
89899	89906	89907	89907	he	868	' If our roads lie together , '
89911	89942	89943	89943	He	868	' I go with thee . One does not often find a worker of miracles , and the child is still weak . But I am not altogether a reed . '
89970	89998	89943	89943	He	868	' The Jats are called quarrel - some , but that is not true . Except when we are crossed , we are like our own buffaloes . '
89999	90004	90006	90006	Kim	344	' So be it , '
90008	90017	90006	90006	Kim	344	' A good stick is a good reason . '
90071	90076	90078	90079	the Kamboh	614	' But for thee , '
90091	90202	90078	90079	the Kamboh	614	' I might today have gone thither - with this one . The priests tell us that Benares is holy - which none doubt - and desirable to die in . But I do not know their Gods , and they ask for money ; and when one has done one worship a shaved - head vows it is of none effect except one do another . Wash here ! Wash there ! Pour , drink , lave , and scatter flowers - but always pay the priests . No , the Punjab for me , and the soil of the Jullundur - doab for the best soil in it . '
90203	90236	90238	90239	the lama	868	' I have said many times - in the Temple , I think - that if need be , the River will open at our feet . We will therefore go North , '
90243	90283	90238	90239	the lama	868	' I remember a pleasant place , set about with fruit - trees , where one can walk in meditation - and the air is cooler there . It comes from the Hills and the snow of the Hills . '
90284	90290	90292	90292	Kim	344	' What is the name ? '
90294	90339	90292	90292	Kim	344	' How should I know ? Didst thou not - no , that was after the Army rose out of the earth and took thee away . I abode there in meditation in a room against the dovecot - except when she talked eternally . '
90340	90353	90354	90354	Kim	344	' Oho ! the woman from Kulu . That is by Saharunpore . '
90357	90378	90379	90380	the Jat	601	' How does the spirit move thy master ? Does he go afoot , for the sake of past sins ? '
90384	90393	90379	90380	the Jat	601	' It is a far cry to Delhi . '
90394	90397	90399	90399	Kim	344	' No , '
90401	90413	90399	90399	Kim	344	' I will beg a tikkut for the te - rain . '
90426	90492	90493	90493	They	3421	' Then , in the name of the Gods , let us take the fire - carriage . My son is best in his mother 's arms . The Government has brought on us many taxes , but it gives us one good thing - the te - rain that joins friends and unites the anxious . A wonderful matter is the te - rain . '
90936	90939	90940	90940	he	3442	' Yes , '
90947	91001	90940	90940	he	3442	' I was in haste , and the cart , driven by a bastard , bound its wheel in a water - cut , and besides the harm done to me there was lost a full dish of tarkeean . I was not a Son of the Charm a lucky man that day . '
91002	91009	91011	91012	the Kamboh	614	' That was a great loss , '
91026	91031	91033	91033	Kim	344	' Who cooked it ? '
91035	91039	91033	91033	Kim	344	' A woman . '
91046	91054	91056	91057	the Kamboh	614	' But all women can cook tarkeean , '
91059	91070	91056	91057	the Kamboh	614	' It is a good curry , as I know . '
91071	91081	91083	91084	the Mahratta	617	' Oh yes , it is a good curry , '
91086	91090	91092	91092	Kim	344	' And cheap , '
91094	91100	91092	91092	Kim	344	' But what about caste ? '
91101	91117	91118	91119	the Mahratta	3442	' Oh , there is no caste where men go to - look for tarkeean , '
91127	91134	91118	91119	the Mahratta	3442	' Of whose service art thou ? '
91135	91144	91145	91145	Kim	344	' Of the service of this Holy One . '
91166	91214	91148	91164	the happy , drowsy lama , who woke with a jerk at the well - loved word	3444	' Ah , he was sent from Heaven to aid me . He is called the Friend of all the World . He is also called the Friend of the Stars . He walks as a physician - his time being ripe . Great is his wisdom . '
91215	91223	91225	91225	Kim	344	' And a Son of the Charm , '
91245	91251	91252	91253	the Mahratta	617	' And who is that ? '
91260	91293	91252	91253	the Mahratta	617	' One whose child I - we have cured , who lies under great debt to us . Sit by the window , man from Jullundur . Here is a sick one . '
91294	91325	91326	91327	The Jat	601	' Humph ! I have no desire to mix with chance - met wastrels . My ears are not long . I am not a woman wishing to overhear secrets . '
91336	91352	91354	91355	the Mahratta	3442	' Art thou anything of a healer ? I am ten leagues deep in calamity , '
91362	91379	91380	91380	Kim	344	' This man is cut and bruised all over . I go about to cure him , '
91383	91392	91380	91380	Kim	344	' None interfered between thy babe and me . '
91393	91398	91400	91401	the Kamboh	614	' I am rebuked , '
91404	91427	91400	91401	the Kamboh	614	' I am thy debtor for the life of my son . Thou art a miracle - worker - I know it . '
91428	91434	91435	91435	Kim	344	' Show me the cuts . '
91459	91475	91400	91401	the Kamboh	614	' Now , tell thy tale swiftly , brother , while I say a charm . '
91476	91501	91502	91502	Kim	344	' I come from the South , where my work lay . One of us they slew by the roadside . Hast thou heard ? '
91530	91680	91507	91507	He	344	' Having found a certain letter which I was sent to seek , I came away . I escaped from the city and ran to Mhow . So sure was I that none knew , I did not change my face . At Mhow a woman brought charge against me of theft of jewellery in that city which I had left . Then I saw the cry was out against me . I ran from Mhow by night , bribing the police , who had been bribed to hand me over without question to my enemies in the South . Then I lay in old Chitor city a week , a penitent in a temple , but I could not get rid of the letter which was my charge . I buried it under the Queen 's Stone , at Chitor , in the place known to us all . '
91697	91709	91691	91691	he	344	' At Chitor , look you , I was all in Kings '
91792	91793	91782	91782	They	3454	' '
91801	91802	91803	91803	We	3457	' '
91909	91919	91901	91901	I	0	' Kim nodded . He understood that feeling well . '

91985	91986	91983	91983	thou	3465	' '
92008	92088	92003	92003	I	0	' Ward and came out by the House of the Jew , who feared a riot and pushed me forth . I came afoot to Somna Road - I had only money for my tikkut to Delhi - and there , while I lay in a ditch with a fever , one sprang out of the bushes and beat me and cut me and searched me from head to foot . Within earshot of the te- rain it was ! '
92089	92100	92191	92191	he	3468	' Why did he not slay thee out of hand ? '
92101	92189	92191	92191	he	3468	' They are not so foolish . If I am taken in Delhi at the instance of lawyers , upon a proven charge of murder , my body is handed over to the State that desires it . I go back guarded , and then - I die slowly for an example to the rest of Us . The South is not my country . I run in circles - like a goat with one eye . I have not eaten for two days . I am marked '
92200	92210	92191	92191	he	3468	' so that they will know me at Delhi . '
92211	92224	92191	92191	he	3468	' Thou art safe in the te - rain , at least . '
92225	92279	92280	92280	Kim	344	' Live a year at the Great Game and tell me that again ! The wires will be out against me at Delhi , describing every tear and rag upon me . Twenty - a hundred , if need be - will have seen me slay that boy . And thou art useless ! '
92352	92385	92333	92333	Kim	344	' Hast thou a charm to change my shape ? Else I am dead . Five - ten minutes alone , if I had not been so pressed , and I might - '
92386	92396	92398	92399	the Kamboh	614	' Is he cured yet , miracle - worker ? '
92402	92409	92398	92399	the Kamboh	614	' Thou hast chanted long enough . '
92410	92438	92333	92333	Kim	344	' Nay . There is no cure for his hurts , as I see , except he sit for three days in the habit of a bairagi . '
92456	92467	92469	92470	the retort	3473	' One priest always goes about to make another priest , '
92490	92510	92483	92483	his	614	' Will thy son be a priest , then ? It is time he took more of my quinine . '
92511	92518	92520	92521	the Kamboh	614	' We Jats are all buffaloes , '
92542	92549	92550	92550	he	344	' I have asked for nothing , '
92557	92581	92550	92550	he	344	' except food . Dost thou grudge me that ? I go to heal another man . Have I thy leave - Prince ? '
92592	92603	92584	92585	the man	4471	' Nay - nay . Do not mock me thus . '
92604	92646	92554	92555	the father	3287	' It pleases me to cure this sick one . Thou shalt acquire merit by aiding . What colour ash is there in thy pipe - bowl ? White . That is auspicious . Was there raw turmeric among thy foodstuffs ? '
92647	92652	92584	92585	the man	4471	' I - I - '
92653	92658	92584	92585	the man	4471	' Open thy bundle ! '

92771	92801	92763	92763	he	344	' There is a great evil in this man 's fortune , as shown by the Stars , which - which troubles him . Shall I take it away ? '
92802	92828	92837	92838	the Mahratta	617	' Friend of the Stars , thou hast done well in all things . Let it be at thy pleasure . Is it another healing ? '
92829	92835	92837	92838	the Mahratta	617	' Quick ! Be quick ! '
92840	92846	92837	92838	the Mahratta	617	' The train may stop . '
92847	92856	92858	92858	Kim	344	' A healing against the shadow of death , '
92899	92907	92908	92909	the jat	6754	' That is my food - priest , '
92912	92928	92930	92930	Kim	344	' A buffalo in the temple ! Hast thou dared to look even thus far ? '
92932	92970	92930	92930	Kim	344	' I must do mysteries before fools ; but have a care for thine eyes . Is there a film before them already ? I save the babe , and for return thou - oh , shameless ! '
92986	92996	92997	92997	He	344	' Shall I curse thee , or shall I - '
93014	93042	92997	92997	He	344	' Dare so much as to think a wish to see , and - and - even I can not save thee . Sit ! Be dumb ! '
93043	93081	92997	92997	He	344	' I am blind - dumb . Forbear to curse ! Co - come , child ; we will play a game of hiding . Do not , for my sake , look from under the cloth . '
93082	93087	93089	93089	E23	619	' I see hope , '
93091	93097	93089	93089	E23	619	' What is thy scheme ? '
93098	93103	93105	93105	Kim	344	' This comes next , '
93131	93140	93142	93142	Kim	344	' What is caste to a cut throat ? '
93150	93189	93190	93190	He	344	' We must make thee a yellow Saddhu all over . Strip - strip swiftly , and shake thy hair over thine eyes while I scatter the ash . Now , a caste - mark on thy forehead . '
93208	93215	93217	93217	E23	619	' Art thou only a beginner ? '
93258	93269	93270	93270	Kim	344	' But two days entered to the Game , brother , '
93273	93281	93270	93270	Kim	344	' Smear more ash on the bosom . '
93282	93293	93294	93294	He	344	' Hast thou met - a physician of sick pearls ? '
93330	93363	93326	93326	Saddhu	620	' Hah ! Dost thou know his touch , then ? He was my teacher for a while . We must bar thy legs . Ash cures wounds . Smear it again . '
93364	93388	93294	93294	He	344	' I was his pride once , but thou art almost better . The Gods are kind to us ! Give me that . '
93413	93433	93434	93434	he	619	' They are good against hunger , fear , and chill . And they make the eyes red too , '
93437	93462	93434	93434	he	619	' Now I shall have heart to play the Game . We lack only a Saddhu 's tongs . What of the old clothes ? '
93507	93520	93486	93486	he	344	' The blood on them is enough to hang thee , brother . '
93521	93539	93540	93540	His	344	' Maybe ; but no need to throw them out of the window ... It is finished . '
93553	93561	93540	93540	His	344	' Turn and look , O Jat ! '
93562	93568	93570	93572	the hooded Kamboh	614	' The Gods protect us , '
93582	93595	93570	93572	the hooded Kamboh	614	' But - whither went the Mahratta ? What hast thou done ? '
93706	93748	93694	93695	The child	747	' Look up , Princeling ! We travel with warlocks , but they will not hurt thee . Oh , do not cry ... What is the sense of curing a child one day and killing him with fright the next ? '
93749	93778	93694	93695	The child	747	' The child will be fortunate all his life . He has seen a great healing . When I was a child I made clay men and horses . '
93779	93808	93810	93811	the child	747	' I have made them too . Sir Banas , he comes in the night and makes them all alive at the back of our kitchen - midden , '
93813	93827	93810	93811	the child	747	' And so thou art not frightened at anything . Eh , Prince ? '
93828	93844	93694	93695	The child	747	' I was frightened because my father was frightened . I felt his arms shake . '
93845	93852	93854	93854	Kim	344	' Oh , chicken - man ! '
93863	93906	93858	93860	the abashed Jat	3490	' I have done a healing on this poor trader . He must forsake his gains and his account - books , and sit by the wayside three nights to overcome the malignity of his enemies . The Stars are against him . '
93907	93936	93694	93695	The child	747	' The fewer money - lenders the better , say I ; but , Saddhu or no Saddhu , he should pay for my stuff on his shoulders . '
93937	94082	93858	93860	the abashed Jat	3490	' So ? But that is thy child on thy shoulder - given over to the burning - ghat not two days ago . There remains one thing more . I did this charm in thy presence because need was great . I changed his shape and his soul . None the less , if , by any chance , O man from Jullundur , thou rememberest what thou hast seen , either among the elders sitting under the village tree , or in thine own house , or in company of thy priest when he blesses thy cattle , a murrain will come among the buffaloes , and a fire in thy thatch , and rats in the corn - bins , and the curse of our Gods upon thy fields that they may be barren before thy feet and after thy ploughshare . '
94113	94124	94126	94127	the Jat	601	' Cease , Holy One ! In mercy , cease ! '
94129	94149	94151	94151	he	601	' Do not curse the household . I saw nothing ! I heard nothing ! I am thy cow ! '
94167	94210	94212	94212	he	601	' But since thou hast been permitted to aid me in the matter of a pinch of flour and a little opium and such trifles as I have honoured by using in my art , so will the Gods return a blessing , '
94253	94259	94260	94260	he	601	' Friend of the Stars , '
94265	94302	94260	94260	he	601	' thou hast acquired great wisdom . Beware that it do not give birth to pride . No man having the Law before his eyes speaks hastily of any matter which he has seen or encountered . '
94303	94312	94314	94315	the farmer	1409	' No - no - no , indeed , '
94457	94491	94492	94492	I	0	' neath all showing - His Sea that his being fulfils ? So and no otherwise - so and no otherwise hill - men desire their Hills ! The Sea and the Hills . '
94499	94511	94492	94492	I	0	' said E23 , under cover of the platform 's tumult . '
94546	94593	94595	94597	the young Sahib	539	' A group of yellow - trousered Punjab policemen , headed by a hot and perspiring young Englishman , parted the crowd about the carriages . Behind them , inconspicuous as a cat , ambled a small fat person who looked like a lawyer 's tout . '
94610	94614	94607	94607	his	539	' said E23 . '
94629	94700	94607	94607	his	539	' When the procession reached their compartment , E23 was counting his beads with a steady jerk of the wrist ; while Kim jeered at him for being so drugged as to have lost the ringed fire - tongs which are the Saddhu 's distinguishing mark . The lama , deep in meditation , stared straight before him ; and the farmer , glancing furtively , gathered up his belongings . '
94711	94738	94607	94607	his	539	' said the Englishman aloud , and passed on amid a ripple of uneasiness ; for native police mean extortion to the native all India over . '
94743	94747	94607	94607	his	539	' whispered E23 , '
94781	94782	94768	94768	I	0	' '
94793	94794	94768	94768	I	0	' '
94820	94848	94815	94816	another Sahib	3507	' This was a tallish , sallowish District Superintendent of Police - belt , helmet , polished spurs and all - strutting and twirling his dark moustache . '
94856	94868	94815	94816	another Sahib	3507	' said Kim genially . E23 glanced up under his eyelids . '
94874	94882	94815	94816	another Sahib	3507	' he muttered in a changed voice . '
94893	94912	94815	94816	another Sahib	3507	' He blundered out almost into the Englishman 's arms , and was bad- worded in clumsy Urdu . '
94935	94985	94986	94988	My good fool	3511	' E23 , not moving a muscle of his countenance , answered with a stream of the filthiest abuse , at which Kim naturally rejoiced . It reminded him of the drummer - boys and the barrack - sweepers at Umballa in the terrible time of his first schooling . '
94990	94995	94996	94996	Nickle	622	' the Englishman drawled . '
95006	95072	95073	95073	I	0	' Step by step , withdrawing deferentially and dropping his voice , the yellow Saddhu clomb back to the carriage , cursing the D.S.P. to remotest posterity , by - here Kim almost jumped - by the curse of the Queen 's Stone , by the writing under the Queen 's Stone , and by an assortment of Gods " with wholly , new names . '
95079	95082	95084	95085	the Englishman	4653	're saying , '
95089	95104	95084	95085	the Englishman	4653	' but it 's some piece of blasted impertinence . Come out of that ! '
95125	95133	95135	95136	the Jat	6754	' Oh , zoolum ! What oppression ! '
95141	95151	95152	95152	He	6754	' All for the sake of a jest too . '
95165	95177	95152	95152	He	6754	' Thy charms do not work well today , Holy One ! '
95242	95246	95248	95249	the Saddhu	620	' It is well '
95287	95343	95277	95285	a Rajput falconer in the small of his back	3522	' He has gone now to send word of the letter which I hid . They told me he was in Peshawur . I might have known that he is like the crocodile - always at the other ford . He has saved me from present calamity , but I owe my life to thee . '
95344	95352	95353	95353	Kim	344	' Is he also one of Us ? '
95374	95405	95406	95406	He	344	' Not less than the greatest . We are both fortunate ! I will make report to him of what thou hast done . I am safe under his protection . '
95429	95479	95406	95406	He	344	' Return , or they take thy place ! Have no fear for the work , brother - or my life . Thou hast given me breathing - space , and Strickland Sahib has pulled me to land . We may work together at the Game yet . Farewell ! '
95506	95580	95581	95581	he	344	' I am only a beginner at the Game , that is sure . I could not have leaped into safety as did the Saddhu . He knew it was darkest under the lamp . I could not have thought to tell news under pretence of cursing ... and how clever was the Sahib ! No matter , I saved the life of one ... Where is the Kamboh gone , Holy One ? '
95595	95601	95602	95603	the lama	868	' A fear gripped him , '
95613	95702	95602	95603	the lama	868	' He saw thee change the Mahratta to a Saddhu in the twinkling of an eye , as a protection against evil . That shook him . Then he saw the Saddhu fall sheer into the hands of the polis - all the effect of thy art . Then he gathered up his son and fled ; for he said that thou didst change a quiet trader into an impudent bandier of words with the Sahibs , and he feared a like fate . Where is the Saddhu ? '
95703	95708	95710	95710	Kim	344	' With the polis , '
95712	95721	95722	95723	The lama	868	' Yet I saved the Kamboh 's child . '
95727	95787	95722	95723	The lama	868	' Ah , chela , see how thou art overtaken ! Thou didst cure the Kamboh 's child solely to acquire merit . But thou didst put a spell on the Mahratta with prideful workings - I watched thee - and with sidelong glances to bewilder an old old man and a foolish farmer : whence calamity and suspicion . '
95834	95839	95840	95840	he	344	' It is true , '
95843	95854	95840	95840	he	344	' Where I have offended thee I have done wrong . '
95855	95890	95840	95840	he	344	' It is more , chela . Thou hast loosed an Act upon the world , and as a stone thrown into a pool so spread the consequences thou canst not tell how far . '
96106	96115	96116	96116	he	868	' We will put these things behind us , '
96128	96156	96116	96116	he	868	' The jolting of the te - rain - though a wonderful thing - has turned my bones to water . We will use clean air henceforward . '
96157	96167	96169	96169	Kim	344	' Let us go to the Kulu woman 's house '
96211	96283	96190	96190	He	868	' Where is this new haste born from ? Wise men do not run about like chickens in the sun . We have come hundreds upon hundreds of koss already , and , till now , I have scarcely been alone with thee an instant . How canst thou receive instruction all jostled of crowds ? How can I , whelmed by a flux of talk , meditate upon the Way ? '
96284	96296	96297	96298	the disciple	3548	' Her tongue grows no shorter with the years , then ? '
96301	96319	96297	96298	the disciple	3548	' Nor her desire for charms . I remember once when I spoke of the Wheel of Life '
96332	96387	96297	96298	the disciple	3548	' she was only curious about the devils that besiege children . She shall acquire merit by entertaining us - in a little while - at an after - occasion - softly , softly . Now we will wander loose - foot , waiting upon the Chain of Things . The Search is sure . '
96981	96989	96991	96992	the lama	868	' Cure them if they are sick , '
97001	97022	96991	96992	the lama	868	' Cure them if they have fever , but by no means work charms . Remember what befell the Mahratta . '
97023	97030	97031	97031	Kim	344	' Then all Doing is evil ? '
97057	97070	96991	96992	the lama	868	' To abstain from action is well - except to acquire merit . '
97071	97096	96991	96992	the lama	868	' At the Gates of Learning we were taught that to abstain from action was unbefitting a Sahib . And I am a Sahib . '
97097	97104	97106	97107	the lama	868	' Friend of all the World , '
97113	97211	97106	97107	the lama	868	' I am an old man - pleased with shows as are children . To those who follow the Way there is neither black nor white , Hind nor Bhotiyal . We be all souls seeking escape . No matter what thy wisdom learned among Sahibs , when we come to my River thou wilt be freed from all illusion - at my side . Hai ! My bones ache for that River , as they ached in the te - rain ; but my spirit sits above my bones , waiting . The Search is sure ! '
97212	97225	97226	97227	The lama	868	' I am answered . Is it permitted to ask a question ? '
97233	97253	97226	97227	The lama	868	' I ate thy bread for three years - as thou knowest . Holy One , whence came - ? '
97254	97268	97269	97270	the lama	868	' There is much wealth , as men count it , in Bhotiyal , '
97275	97324	97269	97270	the lama	868	' In my own place I have the illusion of honour . I ask for that I need . I am not concerned with the account . That is for my monastery . Ai ! The black high seats in the monastery , and novices all in order ! '
97817	97822	97824	97825	the lama	868	' Now do I remember '
97836	97846	97824	97825	the lama	868	' She is virtuous , but an inordinate talker . '
97868	97886	97887	97887	he	868	' She will only ask for another son for her daughter . I have not forgotten her , '
97890	97903	97887	97887	he	868	' Let her acquire merit . Send word that we will come . '
98010	98024	98025	98025	she	1825	' But thou art still the shameless beggar - brat of the parao , '
98028	98061	98025	98025	she	1825	' I have not forgotten thee . Wash ye and eat . The father of my daughter 's son is gone away awhile . So we poor women are dumb and useless . '
98130	98156	98127	98127	she	1825	' Had the Holy One come alone , I should have received him otherwise ; but with this rogue , who can be too careful ? '
98157	98160	98162	98162	Kim	344	' Maharanee , '
98171	98195	98162	98162	Kim	344	' is it my fault that none other than a Sahib - a polis - Sahib - called the Maharanee whose face he - '
98196	98214	98127	98127	she	1825	' Chutt ! That was on the pilgrimage . When we travel - thou knowest the proverb . '
98215	98229	98127	98127	she	1825	' Called the Maharanee a Breaker of Hearts and a Dispenser of Delights ? '
98230	98255	98256	98256	She	1825	' To remember that ! It was true . So he did . That was in the time of the bloom of my beauty . '
98267	98381	98256	98256	She	1825	' Now tell me of thy goings and comings - as much as may be without shame . How many maids , and whose wives , hang upon thine eyelashes ? Ye hail from Benares ? I would have gone there again this year , but my daughter - we have only two sons . Phaii ! Such is the effect of these low plains . Now in Kulu men are elephants . But I would ask thy Holy One - stand aside , rogue - a charm against most lamentable windy colics that in mango - time overtake my daughter 's eldest . Two years back he gave me a powerful spell . '
98382	98388	98390	98390	Kim	344	' Oh , Holy One ! '
98402	98414	98390	98390	Kim	344	' It is true . I gave her one against wind . '
98415	98422	98424	98426	the old woman	1866	' Teeth - teeth - teeth , '
98429	98438	98439	98439	Kim	344	' Cure them if they are sick , " '
98444	98459	98439	98439	Kim	344	' but by no means work charms . Remember what befell the Mahratta . " '
98460	98475	98476	98477	The lama	868	' That was two Rains ago ; she wearied me with her continual importunity . '
98488	98529	98480	98482	the Unjust Judge	3634	' Thus it comes - take note , my chela - that even those who would follow the Way are thrust aside by idle women . Three days through , when the child was sick , she talked to me . '
98530	98580	98476	98477	The lama	868	' Arre ! and to whom else should I talk ? The boy 's mother knew nothing , and the father - in the nights of the cold weather it was - " Pray to the Gods , " said he , forsooth , and turning over , snored ! '
98581	98596	98642	98644	the old lady	1825	' I gave her the charm . What is an old man to do ? '
98598	98612	98480	98482	the Unjust Judge	3634	' To abstain from action is well - except to acquire merit . " '
98613	98627	98476	98477	The lama	868	' Ah chela , if thou desertest me , I am all alone . '
98628	98640	98642	98644	the old lady	1825	' He found his milk - teeth easily at any rate , '
98646	98653	98654	98654	Kim	344	' But all priests are alike . '
98669	98682	98661	98661	he	344	' To importune the wise out of season is to invite calamity . '
98683	98689	98476	98477	The lama	868	' There is a talking mynah '
98708	98819	98476	98477	The lama	868	' over the stables which has picked up the very tone of the family priest . Maybe I forget honour to my guests , but if ye had seen him double his fists into his belly , which was like a half - grown gourd , and cry : " Here is the pain ! " ye would forgive . I am half minded to take the hakim 's medicine . He sells it cheap , and certainly it makes him fat as Shiv 's own bull . He does not deny remedies , but I doubted for the child because of the in - auspicious colour of the bottles . '
98840	98848	98850	98850	Kim	344	' Thou hast angered him , belike , '
98852	98918	98850	98850	Kim	344	' Not he . He is wearied , and I forgot , being a grandmother . None but a grandmother should ever oversee a child . Mothers are only fit for bearing . Tomorrow , when he sees how my daughter 's son is grown , he will write the charm . Then , too , he can judge of the new hakim 's drugs . '
98919	98927	99101	99101	his	3639	' Who is the hakim , Maharanee ? '
98928	99039	98850	98850	Kim	344	' A wanderer , as thou art , but a most sober Bengali from Dacca - a master of medicine . He relieved me of an oppression after meat by means of a small pill that wrought like a devil unchained . He travels about now , vending preparations of great value . He has even papers , printed in Angrezi , telling what things he has done for weak - backed men and slack women . He has been here four days ; but hearing ye were coming hakims and priests are snake and tiger the world over he has , as I take it , gone to cover . '
99063	99098	99099	99099	He	3639	' This house is a cattle - pound , as it were , for all charlatans and - priests . Let the boy stop eating mangoes ... but who can argue with a grandmother ? '
99105	99124	99101	99101	his	3639	' Sahiba , the hakim sleeps after his meat . He is in the quarters behind the dovecote . '
99245	99248	99250	99250	Kim	344	' Yes , '
99256	99296	99297	99299	The old lady	1825	' Their stock - in - trade is a little coloured water and a very great shamelessness . Their prey are broken - down kings and overfed Bengalis . Their profit is in children - who are not born . '
99302	99333	99297	99299	The old lady	1825	' Do not be envious . Charms are better , eh ? I never gainsaid it . See that thy Holy One writes me a good amulet by the morning . '

99360	99381	99353	99354	a figure	3651	' None but the ignorant deny the value of charms . None but the ignorant deny the value of medicines . '
99382	99404	99405	99405	Kim	344	' A rat found a piece of turmeric . Said he : " I will open a grocer 's shop , " '
99424	99459	99417	99419	the old lady	1825	' The priest 's son knows the names of his nurse and three Gods . Says he : " Hear me , or I will curse you by the three million Great Ones . " '

99530	99599	99472	99472	He	3654	' I have , too , our drugs which loosen humours of the head in hot and angry men . Sina well compounded when the moon stands in the proper House ; yellow earths I have - arplan from China that makes a man renew his youth and astonish his household ; saffron from Kashmir , and the best salep of Kabul . Many people have died before - '
99600	99606	99608	99608	Kim	344	' That I surely believe , '
99610	99648	99608	99608	Kim	344	' They knew the value of my drugs . I do not give my sick the mere ink in which a charm is written , but hot and rending drugs which descend and wrestle with the evil . '

99682	99723	99662	99663	The voice	4941	' But for my fate , which overrules all , I had been now in Government employ . I bear a degree from the great school at Calcutta - whither , maybe , the son of this House shall go . '

99790	99836	99748	99748	she	1825	' have I seen such a child ! Born in an auspicious hour , and - but for that colic which , alas ! turning into black cholers , may carry him off like a pigeon - destined to many years , he is enviable . '

99847	99953	99843	99845	the old lady	1825	' To praise children is inauspicious , or I could listen to this talk . But the back of the house is unguarded , and even in this soft air men think themselves to be men , and women we know ... The child 's father is away too , and I must be chowkedar watchman in my old age . Up ! Up ! Take up the palanquin . Let the hakim and the young priest settle between them whether charms or medicine most avail . Ho ! worthless people , fetch tobacco for the guests , and - round the homestead go I ! '
100088	100106	100108	100109	the hakim	7103	' To discuss medicine before the ignorant is of one piece with teaching the peacock to sing , '

100386	100417	100418	100418	He	344	' Ah ha ! I told you at Lucknow - resurgam - I shall rise again and you shall not know me . How much did you bet - eh ? '
100432	100440	100428	100428	he	344	' But why come here , Babuji ? '
100441	100537	100543	100543	his	3676	' Ah ! Thatt is the question , as Shakespeare hath it . I come to congratulate you on your extraordinary effeecient performance at Delhi . Oah ! I tell you we are all proud of you . It was verree neat and handy . Our mutual friend , he is old friend of mine . He has been in some dam'-tight places . Now he will be in some more . He told me ; I tell Mr Lurgan ; and he is pleased you graduate so nicely . All the Department is pleased . '
100608	100615	100616	100616	he	3676	' Tell thy tale , Babu , '
100620	100651	100616	100616	he	3676	' Oah , it is nothing . Onlee I was at Simla when the wire came in about what our mutual friend said he had hidden , and old Creighton - '
100665	100670	100657	100657	Kim	344	' The Colonel Sahib , '
100679	100803	100657	100657	Kim	344	' Of course . He found me at a loose string , and I had to go down to Chitor to find that beastly letter . I do not like the South - too much railway travel ; but I drew good travelling allowance . Ha ! Ha ! I meet our mutual at Delhi on the way back . He lies quiett just now , and says Saddhu - disguise suits him to the ground . Well , there I hear what you have done so well , so quickly , upon the instantaneous spur of the moment . I tell our mutual you take the bally bun , by Jove ! It was splendid . I come to tell you so . '
100804	100807	100808	100809	The frogs	3680	' Umm ! '
100851	100858	100842	100842	Kim	344	' How didst thou follow us ? '
100859	101020	100657	100657	Kim	344	' Oah . Thatt was nothing . I know from our mutual friend you go to Saharunpore . So I come on . Red Lamas are not inconspicuous persons . I buy myself my drug - box , and I am very good doctor really . I go to Akrola of the Ford , and hear all about you , and I talk here and talk there . All the common people know what you do . I knew when the hospitable old lady sent the dooli . They have great recollections of the old lama 's visits here . I know old ladies can not keep their hands from medicines . So I am a doctor , and - you hear my talk ? I think it is verree good . My word , Mister O'Hara , they know about you and the lama for fifty miles - the common people . So I come . Do you mind ? '
101021	101024	101026	101026	Kim	344	' Babuji , '
101037	101043	101026	101026	Kim	344	' I am a Sahib . '
101044	101050	100657	100657	Kim	344	' My dear Mister O'Hara - '
101051	101061	100657	100657	Kim	344	' And I hope to play the Great Game . '
101062	101072	100657	100657	Kim	344	' You are subordinate to me departmentally at present . '
101073	101148	100657	100657	Kim	344	' Then why talk like an ape in a tree ? Men do not come after one from Simla and change their dress , for the sake of a few sweet words . I am not a child . Talk Hindi and let us get to the yolk of the egg . Thou art here - speaking not one word of truth in ten . Why art thou here ? Give a straight answer . '
101149	101174	100657	100657	Kim	344	' That is so verree disconcerting of the Europeans , Mister O'Hara . You should know a heap better at your time of life . '
101175	101182	101184	101184	Kim	344	' But I want to know , '
101188	101213	101184	101184	Kim	344	' If it is the Game , I may help . How can I do anything if you bukh babble all round the shop ? '
101229	101252	101214	101215	Hurree Babu	400	' Now I will speak vernacular . You sit tight , Mister O'Hara ... It concerns the pedigree of a white stallion . '
101253	101262	100657	100657	Kim	344	' Still ? That was finished long ago . '
101263	101327	100657	100657	Kim	344	' When everyone is dead the Great Game is finished . Not before . Listen to me till the end . There were Five Kings who prepared a sudden war three years ago , when thou wast given the stallion 's pedigree by Mahbub Ali . Upon them , because of that news , and ere they were ready , fell our Army . '
101328	101342	100657	100657	Kim	344	' Ay - eight thousand men with guns . I remember that night . '
101343	101414	101415	101415	He	3683	' But the war was not pushed . That is the Government custom . The troops were recalled because the Government believed the Five Kings were cowed ; and it is not cheap to feed men among the high Passes . Hilas and Bunar - Rajahs with guns - undertook for a price to guard the Passes against all coming from the North . They protested both fear and friendship . '
101424	101568	101415	101415	He	3683	' Of course , I tell you this unoffeecially to elucidate political situation , Mister O'Hara . Offeecially , I am debarred from criticizing any action of superiors . Now I go on . - This pleased the Government , anxious to avoid expense , and a bond was made for so many rupees a month that Hilas and Bunar should guard the Passes as soon as the State 's troops were withdrawn . At that time - it was after we two met - I , who had been selling tea in Leh , became a clerk of accounts in the Army . When the troops were withdrawn , I was left behind to pay the coolies who made new roads in the Hills . This road - making was part of the bond between Bunar , Hilas , and the Government . '
101569	101575	100657	100657	Kim	344	' So ? And then ? '
101576	101594	101596	101597	Hurree Babu	400	' I tell you , it was jolly - beastly cold up there too , after summer , '
101600	101720	101596	101597	Hurree Babu	400	' I was afraid these Bunar men would cut my throat every night for thee pay - chest . My native sepoy - guard , they laughed at me ! By Jove ! I was such a fearful man . Nevar mind thatt . I go on colloquially ... I send word many times that these two Kings were sold to the North ; and Mahbub Ali , who was yet farther North , amply confirmed it . Nothing was done . Only my feet were frozen , and a toe dropped off . I sent word that the roads for which I was paying money to the diggers were being made for the feet of strangers and enemies . '
101721	101724	100657	100657	Kim	344	' For ? '
101725	101773	101775	101775	he	3684	' For the Russians . The thing was an open jest among the coolies . Then I was called down to tell what I knew by speech of tongue . Mahbub came South too . See the end ! Over the Passes this year after snow - melting '
101779	101804	101775	101775	he	3684	' come two strangers under cover of shooting wild goats . They bear guns , but they bear also chains and levels and compasses . '
101805	101813	101596	101597	Hurree Babu	400	' Oho ! The thing gets clearer . '
101814	102016	102017	102017	Hurree	400	' They are well received by Hilas and Bunar . They make great promises ; they speak as the mouthpiece of a Kaisar with gifts . Up the valleys , down the valleys go they , saying , " Here is a place to build a breastwork ; here can ye pitch a fort . Here can ye hold the road against an army " - the very roads for which I paid out the rupees monthly . The Government knows , but does nothing . The three other Kings , who were not paid for guarding the Passes , tell them by runner of the bad faith of Bunar and Hilas . When all the evil is done , look you - when these two strangers with the levels and the compasses make the Five Kings to believe that a great army will sweep the Passes tomorrow or the next day - Hill - people are all fools - comes the order to me , Hurree Babu , " Go North and see what those strangers do . " I say to Creighton Sahib , " This is not a lawsuit , that we go about to collect evidence . " '
102027	102107	102017	102017	Hurree	400	' By Jove , " I said , " why the dooce do you not issue demi - offeecial orders to some brave man to poison them , for an example ? It is , if you permit the observation , most reprehensible laxity on your part . " And Colonel Creighton , he laughed at me ! It is all your beastly English pride . You think no one dare conspire ! That is all tommy - rott . '
102128	102138	102108	102108	Kim	344	' Then thou goest forth to follow the strangers ? '
102139	102195	102017	102017	Hurree	400	' No . To meet them . They are coming in to Simla to send down their horns and heads to be dressed at Calcutta . They are exclusively sporting gentlemen , and they are allowed special faceelities by the Government . Of course , we always do that . It is our British pride . '
102196	102205	102017	102017	Hurree	400	' Then what is to fear from them ? '
102206	102253	102108	102108	Kim	344	' By Jove , they are not black people . I can do all sorts of things with black people , of course . They are Russians , and highly unscrupulous people . I - I do not want to consort with them without a witness . '
102254	102260	102017	102017	Hurree	400	' Will they kill thee ? '
102261	102303	102017	102017	Hurree	400	' Oah , thatt is nothing . I am good enough Herbert Spencerian , I trust , to meet little thing like death , which is all in my fate , you know . But - but they may beat me . '
102304	102307	102308	102309	Hurree Babu	400	' Why ? '
102316	102408	102311	102311	his	400	' Of course I shall affeeliate myself to their camp in supernumerary capacity as perhaps interpreter , or person mentally impotent and hungree , or some such thing . And then I must pick up what I can , I suppose . That is as easy for me as playing Mister Doctor to the old lady . Onlee - onlee - you see , Mister O'Hara , I am unfortunately Asiatic , which is serious detriment in some respects . And all - so I am Bengali - a fearful man . '
102409	102421	102423	102423	Kim	344	' God made the Hare and the Bengali . What shame ? '
102429	102525	102526	102526	He	3685	' It was process of Evolution , I think , from Primal Necessity , but the fact remains in all the cui bono . I am , oh , awfully fearful ! - I remember once they wanted to cut off my head on the road to Lhassa . No , I have never reached to Lhassa . I sat down and cried , Mister O'Hara , anticipating Chinese tortures . I do not suppose these two gentlemen will torture me , but I like to provide for possible contingency with European assistance in emergency . '
102534	102642	102526	102526	He	3685	' It is purely unoffeecial indent , to which you can say " No , Babu " . If you have no pressing engagement with your old man - perhaps you might divert him ; perhaps I can seduce his fancies - I should like you to keep in Departmental touch with me till I find those sporting coves . I have great opeenion of you since I met my friend at Delhi . And also I will embody your name in my offeecial report when matter is finally adjudicated . It will be a great feather in your cap . That is why I come really . '
102643	102666	102311	102311	his	400	' Humph ! The end of the tale , I think , is true ; but what of the fore - part ? '
102667	102692	102694	102694	Hurree	400	' About the Five Kings ? Oah ! there is ever so much truth in it . A lots more than you would suppose , '
102697	102801	102694	102694	Hurree	400	' You come - eh ? I go from here straight into the Doon . It is verree verdant and painted meads . I shall go to Mussoorie to good old Munsoorie Pahar , as the gentlemen and ladies say . Then by Rampur into Chini . That is the only way they can come . I do not like waiting in the cold , but we must wait for them . I want to walk with them to Simla . You see , one Russian is a Frenchman , and I know my French pretty well . I have friends in Chandernagore . '
102802	102813	102815	102815	Kim	344	' He would certainly rejoice to see the Hills again , '
102818	102837	102815	102815	Kim	344	' All his speech these ten days past has been of little else . If we go together - '
102838	102939	102940	102940	He	344	' Oah ! We can be quite strangers on the road , if your lama prefers . I shall just be four or five miles ahead . There is no hurry for Hurree - that is an Europe pun , ha ! ha ! - and you come after . There is plenty of time ; they will plot and survey and map , of course . I shall go tomorrow , and you the next day , if you choose . Eh ? You go think on it till morning . By Jove , it is near morning now . '
102970	103064	103066	103066	he	344	' Well is the Game called great ! I was four days a scullion at Quetta , waiting on the wife of the man whose book I stole . And that was part of the Great Game ! From the South - God knows how far - came up the Mahratta , playing the Great Game in fear of his life . Now I shall go far and far into the North playing the Great Game . Truly , it runs like a shuttle throughout all Hind . And my share and my joy '
103071	103140	103066	103066	he	344	' I owe to the lama here . Also to Mahbub Ali - also to Creighton Sahib , but chiefly to the Holy One .

Ho ! Ho ! I know the road - every march of the road I know . Ye will find charity throughout - it is not denied to the well - looking . I will give orders for provision . A servant to set you forth upon your journey ? No ... Then I will at least cook ye good food . '

104526	104533	104535	104535	Kim	344	' Not I , Holy One , '
104545	104581	104535	104535	Kim	344	' In my mind - behind my eyes - I have tried to picture such an one altogether freed from the Wheel - desiring nothing , causing nothing - a nun , as it were . '

104651	104844	104589	104590	The lama	868	' Thy mind is set on things unworthy . But she has skill . I am refreshed all over . When we reach the lower hills I shall be yet stronger . The hakim spoke truly to me this morn when he said a breath from the snows blows away twenty years from the life of a man . We will go up into the Hills - the high hills - up to the sound of snow - waters and the sound of the trees - for a little while . The hakim said that at any time we may return to the Plains , for we do no more than skirt the pleasant places . The hakim is full of learning ; but he is in no way proud . I spoke to him - when thou wast talking to the Sahiba - of a certain dizziness that lays hold upon the back of my neck in the night , and he said it rose from excessive heat - to be cured by cool air . Upon consideration , I marvelled that I had not thought of such a simple remedy . '
104845	104854	104856	104856	Kim	344	' Didst thou tell him of thy Search ? '
104881	104909	104862	104862	He	344	' Assuredly . I told him of my dream , and of the manner by which I had acquired merit by causing thee to be taught wisdom . '
104910	104920	104589	104590	The lama	868	' Thou didst not say I was a Sahib ? '
104921	105091	105092	105092	He	3722	' What need ? I have told thee many times we be but two souls seeking escape . He said - and he is just herein - that the River of Healing will break forth even as I dreamed - at my feet , if need be . Having found the Way , seest thou , that shall free me from the Wheel , need I trouble to find a way about the mere fields of earth - which are illusion ? That were senseless . I have my dreams , night upon night repeated ; I have Jataka ; and I have thee , Friend of all the World . It was written in thy horoscope that a Red Bull on a green field - I have not forgotten - should bring thee to honour . Who but I saw that prophecy accomplished ? Indeed , I was the instrument . Thou shalt find me my River , being in return the instrument . The Search is sure ! '

105235	105380	105232	105232	his	3722	' They had crossed the Siwaliks and the half - tropical Doon , left Mussoorie behind them , and headed north along the narrow hill - roads . Day after day they struck deeper into the huddled mountains , and day after day Kim watched the lama return to a man 's strength . Among the terraces of the Doon he had leaned on the boy 's shoulder , ready to profit by wayside halts . Under the great ramp to Mussoorie he drew himself together as an old hunter faces a well - remembered bank , and where he should have sunk exhausted swung his long draperies about him , drew a deep double - lungful of the diamond air , and walked as only a hillman can . Kim , plains - bred and plains - fed , sweated and panted astonished . '
105386	105391	105232	105232	his	3722	' said the lama . '
105405	105500	105232	105232	his	3722	' ; and with steady , driving strokes from the loins he strode upwards . But it was on the steep downhill marches , three thousand feet in three hours , that he went utterly away from Kim , whose back ached with holding back , and whose big toe was nigh cut off by his grass sandal - string . Through the speckled shadow of the great deodar - forests ; through oak feathered and plumed with ferns ; birch , ilex , rhododendron , and pine , out on to the bare hillsides '
105510	105743	105232	105232	his	3722	' coolth again , till oak gave way to bamboo and palm of the valley , the lama swung untiring . Glancing back in the twilight at the huge ridges behind him and the faint , thin line of the road whereby they had come , he would lay out , with a hillman 's generous breadth of vision , fresh marches for the morrow ; or , halting in the neck of some uplifted pass that gave on Spiti and Kulu , would stretch out his hands yearningly towards the high snows of the horizon . In the dawns they flared windy - red above stark blue , as Kedar- nath and Badrinath - kings of that wilderness - took the first sunlight . All day long they lay like molten silver under the sun , and at evening put on their jewels again . At first they breathed temperately upon the travellers , winds good to meet when one crawled over some gigantic hog's - back ; but in a few days , at a height of nine or ten thousand feet , those breezes bit ; and Kim kindly allowed a village of hillmen to acquire merit by giving him a rough blanket - coat . The lama was mildly surprised that anyone should object to the knife - edged breezes which had cut the years off his shoulders . '

105787	105791	105793	105793	we	3728	' Kim growled ; '

105853	106028	105844	105844	We	3728	' Kim had all a plainsman 's affection for the well - trodden track , not six feet wide , that snaked among the mountains ; but the lama , being Tibetan , could not refrain from short cuts over spurs and the rims of gravel - strewn slopes . As he explained to his limping disciple , a man bred among mountains can prophesy the course of a mountain - road , and though low - lying clouds might be a hindrance to a short - cutting stranger , they made no earthly difference to a thoughtful man . Thus , after long hours of what would be reckoned very fair mountaineering in civilized countries , they would pant over a saddle - back , sidle past a few landslips , and drop through forest at an angle of forty- five onto the road again . Along their track lay the villages of the hillfolk - mud and earth huts , timbers now and then rudely carved with an axe - clinging like swallows '

106242	106287	106224	106225	a Betah	3744	' We do not use that often - except when calving cows stray in summer . There is a sudden wind among those stones that casts men down on the stillest day . But what should such folk care for the Devil of Eua ! '

106951	106962	106963	106963	they	3781	' - he drew a furrow from left to right - '
107065	107108	107059	107059	your	3787	' It nodded like a wind - blown harebell down the valleys and round the mountain sides , and in due time the lama and Kim , who steered by compass , would overhaul it , vending ointments and powders at eventide . '
107118	107422	107059	107059	your	3787	' The lama would throw a careless finger backward at the ridges , and the umbrella would expend itself in compliments . They crossed a snowy pass in cold moonlight , when the lama , mildly chaffing Kim , went through up to his knees , like a Bactrian camel - the snow - bred , shag - haired sort that came into the Kashmir Serai . They dipped across beds of light snow and snow - powdered shale , where they took refuge from a gale in a camp of Tibetans hurrying down tiny sheep , each laden with a bag of borax . They came out upon grassy shoulders still snow - speckled , and through forest , to grass anew . For all their marchings , Kedarnath and Badrinath were not impressed ; and it was only after days of travel that Kim , uplifted upon some insignificant ten - thousand - foot hummock , could see that a shoulder - knot or horn of the two great lords had - ever so slightly - changed outline . At last they entered a world within a world - a valley of leagues where the high hills were fashioned of a mere rubble and refuse from off the knees of the mountains . Here one day 's march carried them no farther , it seemed , than a dreamer 's clogged pace bears him in a nightmare . They skirted a shoulder painfully for hours , and , behold , it was but an outlying boss in an outlying buttress of the main pile ! A rounded meadow revealed itself , when they had reached it , for a vast tableland running far into the valley . Three days later , it was a dim fold in the earth to southward . '
107429	107452	107059	107059	your	3787	' said Kim , beaten down by the silence and the appalling sweep and dispersal of the cloud - shadows after rain . '

107467	107476	107059	107059	your	3787	' said the lama , as to himself , '
107563	107785	107541	107541	chela	5580	' Above them , still enormously above them , earth towered away towards the snow - line , where from east to west across hundreds of miles , ruled as with a ruler , the last of the bold birches stopped . Above that , in scarps and blocks upheaved , the rocks strove to fight their heads above the white smother . Above these again , changeless since the world 's beginning , but changing to every mood of sun and cloud , lay out the eternal snow . They could see blots and blurs on its face where storm and wandering wullie - wa got up to dance . Below them , as they stood , the forest slid away in a sheet of blue - green for mile upon mile ; below the forest was a village in its sprinkle of terraced fields and steep grazing - grounds . Below the village they knew , though a thunderstorm worried and growled there for the moment , a pitch of twelve or fifteen hundred feet gave to the moist valley where the streams gather that are the mothers of young Sutluj . As usual , the lama had led Kim by cow - track and by - road , far from the main route along which Hurree Babu , that '
107788	107840	107541	107541	chela	5580	' , had bucketed three days before through a storm to which nine Englishmen out of ten would have given full right of way . Hurree was no game- shot - the snick of a trigger made him change colour - but , as he himself would have said , he was '
107844	108238	107541	107541	chela	5580	' , and he had raked the huge valley with a pair of cheap binoculars to some purpose . Moreover , the white of worn canvas tents against green carries far . Hurree Babu had seen all he wanted to see when he sat on the threshing - floor of Ziglaur , twenty miles away as the eagle flies , and forty by road - that is to say , two small dots which one day were just below the snow - line , and the next had moved downward perhaps six inches on the hillside . Once cleaned out and set to the work , his fat bare legs could cover a surprising amount of ground , and this was the reason why , while Kim and the lama lay in a leaky hut at Ziglaur till the storm should be over - past , an oily , wet , but always smiling Bengali , talking the best of English with the vilest of phrases , was ingratiating himself with two sodden and rather rheumatic foreigners . He had arrived , revolving many wild schemes , on the heels of a thunderstorm which had split a pine over against their camp , and so convinced a dozen or two forcibly impressed baggage - coolies the day was inauspicious for farther travel that with one accord they had thrown down their loads and jibbed . They were subjects of a Hill Rajah who farmed out their services , as is the custom , for his private gain ; and , to add to their personal distresses , the strange Sahibs had already threatened them with rifles . The most of them knew rifles and Sahibs of old : they were trackers and shikarris of the Northern valleys , keen after bear and wild goat ; but they had never been thus treated in their lives . So the forest took them to her bosom , and , for all oaths and clamour , refused to restore . There was no need to feign madness or - the Babu had thought of another means of securing a welcome . He wrung out his wet clothes , slipped on his patent - leather shoes , opened the blue- and - white umbrella , and with mincing gait and a heart beating against his tonsils appeared as '
108261	108398	108254	108254	I	0	' The gentlemen were delighted . One was visibly French , the other Russian , but they spoke English not much inferior to the Babu 's . They begged his kind offices . Their native servants had gone sick at Leh . They had hurried on because they were anxious to bring the spoils of the chase to Simla ere the skins grew moth - eaten . They bore a general letter of introduction the Babu salaamed to it orientally to all Government officials . No , they had not met any other shooting - parties en route . They did for themselves . They had plenty of supplies . They only wished to push on as soon as might be . At this he waylaid a cowering hillman among the trees , and after three minutes '
108444	108506	108507	108507	He	400	' My royal master , he will be much annoyed , but these people are onlee common people and grossly ignorant . If your honours will kindly overlook unfortunate affair , I shall be much pleased . In a little while rain will stop and we can then proceed . You have been shooting , eh ? That is fine performance !

A huge pasture - ground ran up fan - shaped to the living snow . At its base was perhaps half an acre of flat land , on which stood a few soil and timber huts . Behind them - for , hill- fashion , they were perched on the edge of all things - the ground fell sheer two thousand feet to Shamlegh - midden , where never yet man has set foot .

116806	116836	116737	116737	he	344	' He will tell for the sake of a reward . Sahibs can not distinguish one hillman from another , but Babus have eyes for men - and women . '

117464	117508	117446	117446	Shamlegh	297	' She turned resolutely uphill , her silver necklaces clicking on her broad breast , to meet the morning sun fifteen hundred feet above them . This time Kim thought in the vernacular as he waxed down the oilskin edges of the packets . '
117603	118068	118078	118080	De - ch'en	523	' He went out to levy on the village - not with a begging - bowl , which might do for down - country , but in the manner of a prince . Shamlegh 's summer population is only three families - four women and eight or nine men . They were all full of tinned meats and mixed drinks , from ammoniated quinine to white vodka , for they had taken their full share in the overnight loot . The neat Continental tents had been cut up and shared long ago , and there were patent aluminium saucepans abroad . But they considered the lama 's presence a perfect safeguard against all consequences , and impenitently brought Kim of their best - even to a drink of chang - the barley - beer that comes from Ladakh - way . Then they thawed out in the sun , and sat with their legs hanging over infinite abysses , chattering , laughing , and smoking . They judged India and its Government solely from their experience of wandering Sahibs who had employed them or their friends as shikarris . Kim heard tales of shots missed upon ibex , serow , or markhor , by Sahibs twenty years in their graves - every detail lighted from behind like twigs on tree - tops seen against lightning . They told him of their little diseases , and , more important , the diseases of their tiny , sure - footed cattle ; of trips as far as Kotgarh , where the strange missionaries live , and beyond even to marvellous Simla , where the streets are paved with silver , and anyone , look you , can get service with the Sahibs , who ride about in two - wheeled carts and spend money with a spade . Presently , grave and aloof , walking very heavily , the lama joined himself to the chatter under the eaves , and they gave him great room . The thin air refreshed him , and he sat on the edge of precipices with the best of them , and , when talk languished , flung pebbles into the void . Thirty miles away , as the eagle flies , lay the next range , seamed and channelled and pitted with little patches of brush - forests , each a day 's dark march . Behind the village , Shamlegh hill itself cut off all view to southward . It was like sitting in a swallow 's nest under the eaves of the roof of the world . From time to time the lama stretched out his hand , and with a little low - voiced prompting would point out the road to Spiti and north across the Parungla . '
118081	118087	118078	118080	De - ch'en	523	' he meant Han - le '
118089	118112	118114	118114	he	523	' the great Monastery . s'Tag - stan - ras - ch'en built it , and of him there runs this tale . '
118154	118175	118078	118080	De - ch'en	523	' For thither came I in the old , old days . From Leh I came , over the Baralachi . '
118176	118185	118187	118193	the far - faring people of Shamlegh	4095	' Yes , yes ; we know it , '
118195	118276	118277	118277	He	4096	' And I slept two nights with the priests of Kailung . These are the Hills of my delight ! Shadows blessed above all other shadows ! There my eyes opened on this world ; there my eyes were opened to this world ; there I found Enlightenment ; and there I girt my loins for my Search . Out of the Hills I came - the high Hills and the strong winds . Oh , just is the Wheel ! '
118336	118349	118351	118354	the people of Shamlegh	4099	' Yes - yes . There is no place like our Hills , '
118450	118459	118460	118460	Kim	344	' I sent a word to the hakim , '
118468	118513	118464	118464	she	4110	' He joined himself to the idolaters ? Nay , I remember he did a healing upon one of them . He has acquired merit , though the healed employed his strength for evil . Just is the Wheel ! What of the hakim ? '
118514	118531	118532	118532	Kim	344	' I feared that thou hadst been bruised and - and I knew he was wise . '
118605	118635	118636	118637	The lama	868	' He says , Holy One , that he will escape from the idolaters , and will return to us . Shall we wait awhile at Shamlegh , then ? '
118650	118680	118647	118647	his	868	' That may not be , chela . From my bones outward I do desire it , but it is forbidden . I have seen the Cause of Things . '
118681	118709	118636	118637	The lama	868	' Why ? When the Hills give thee back thy strength day by day ? Remember we were weak and fainting down below there in the Doon . '
118710	118731	118732	118732	Kim	344	' I became strong to do evil and to forget . A brawler and a swashbuckler upon the hillsides was I. '
118738	118771	118772	118772	he	868	' Just and perfect is the Wheel , swerving not a hair . When I was a man - a long time ago - I did pilgrimage to Guru Ch'wan among the poplars '
118776	118784	118772	118772	he	868	' where they keep the Sacred Horse . '
118785	118791	118793	118793	Shamlegh	297	' Quiet , be quiet ! '
118798	118822	118793	118793	Shamlegh	297	' He speaks of Jam - lin - nin - k'or , the Horse That Can Go Round The World In a Day . '
118823	118831	118833	118834	the lama	868	' I speak to my chela only , '
118852	118943	118833	118834	the lama	868	' I did not seek truth in those days , but the talk of doctrine . All illusion ! I drank the beer and ate the bread of Guru Ch'wan . Next day one said : " We go out to fight Sangor Gutok down the valley to discover " mark again how Lust is tied to Anger ! " which Abbot shall bear rule in the valley and take the profit of the prayers they print at Sangor Gutok . " I went , and we fought a day . '
118944	118951	118793	118793	Shamlegh	297	' But how , Holy One ? '
118952	118991	118992	118992	He	4120	' With our long pencases as I could have shown ... I say , we fought under the poplars , both Abbots and all the monks , and one laid open my forehead to the bone . See ! '
119004	119125	118992	118992	He	4120	' Just and perfect is the Wheel ! Yesterday the scar itched , and after fifty years I recalled how it was dealt and the face of him who dealt it ; dwelling a little in illusion . Followed that which thou didst see - strife and stupidity . Just is the Wheel ! The idolater 's blow fell upon the scar . Then I was shaken in my soul : my soul was darkened , and the boat of my soul rocked upon the waters of illusion . Not till I came to Shamlegh could I meditate upon the Cause of Things , or trace the running grass - roots of Evil . I strove all the long night . '
119126	119145	119146	119146	Kim	344	' But , Holy One , thou art innocent of all evil . May I be thy sacrifice ! '
119166	119171	119172	119173	the lama	868	' In the dawn , '
119187	119385	119172	119173	the lama	868	' came enlightenment . It is here ... I am an old man ... hill - bred , hill - fed , never to sit down among my Hills . Three years I travelled through Hind , but - can earth be stronger than Mother Earth ? My stupid body yearned to the Hills and the snows of the Hills , from below there . I said , and it is true , my Search is sure . So , at the Kulu woman 's house I turned hillward , over - persuaded by myself . There is no blame to the hakim . He - following Desire - foretold that the Hills would make me strong . They strengthened me to do evil , to forget my Search . I delighted in life and the lust of life . I desired strong slopes to climb . I cast about to find them . I measured the strength of my body , which is evil , against the high Hills , I made a mock of thee when thy breath came short under Jamnotri . I jested when thou wouldst not face the snow of the pass . '
119386	119414	119172	119173	the lama	868	' But what harm ? I was afraid . It was just . I am not a hillman ; and I loved thee for thy new strength . '
119415	119421	119423	119423	he	4123	' More than once I remember '
119432	119484	119486	119486	he	4123	' I sought thy praise and the hakim 's for the mere strength of my legs . Thus evil followed evil till the cup was full . Just is the Wheel ! All Hind for three years did me all honour . From the Fountain of Wisdom in the Wonder House to '
119489	119508	119486	119486	he	4123	' a little child playing by a big gun - the world prepared my road . And why ? '
119509	119532	119172	119173	the lama	868	' Because we loved thee . It is only the fever of the blow . I myself am still sick and shaken . '
119533	119602	119603	119603	He	4123	' No ! It was because I was upon the Way - tuned as are si - nen cymbals to the purpose of the Law . I departed from that ordinance . The tune was broken : followed the punishment . In my own Hills , on the edge of my own country , in the very place of my evil desire , comes the buffet - here ! '
119608	119645	119603	119603	He	4123	' As a novice is beaten when he misplaces the cups , so am I beaten , who was Abbot of Such - zen . No word , look you , but a blow , chela . '
119646	119658	119172	119173	the lama	868	' But the Sahibs did not know thee , Holy One ? '
119659	119753	119172	119173	the lama	868	' We were well matched . Ignorance and Lust met Ignorance and Lust upon the road , and they begat Anger . The blow was a sign to me , who am no better than a strayed yak , that my place is not here . Who can read the Cause of an act is halfway to Freedom ! " Back to the path , " says the Blow . " The Hills are not for thee . Thou canst not choose Freedom and go in bondage to the delight of life . " '
119754	119764	119603	119603	He	4123	' Would we had never met that cursed Russian ! '
119765	119791	119792	119792	He	4124	' Our Lord Himself can not make the Wheel swing backward . And for my merit that I had acquired I gain yet another sign . '
119808	119834	119792	119792	He	4124	' Look ! I considered this after I had meditated . There remains untorn by the idolater no more than the breadth of my fingernail . '
119835	119839	119603	119603	He	4123	' I see . '
119840	119908	119909	119909	Kim	344	' So much , then , is the span of my life in this body . I have served the Wheel all my days . Now the Wheel serves me . But for the merit I have acquired in guiding thee upon the Way , there would have been added to me yet another life ere I had found my River . Is it plain , chela ? '

120050	120064	119976	119977	the lama	868	' But thou art all sick and shaken . Thou canst not walk . '
120065	120076	120077	120077	He	868	' How can I be sick if I see Freedom ? '
120084	120100	120077	120077	He	868	' Then I must get food from the village . Oh , the weary Road ! '
120109	120138	120139	120139	Kim	344	' That is lawful . Let us eat and go . The Arrow fell in the Plains ... but I yielded to Desire . Make ready , chela . '

120233	120293	120225	120225	Kim	344	' I spoke to the Bengali first - and to the people of a near - by village after . The Sahibs will be given food as they need it - nor will the people ask money .

122110	122133	122107	122108	the lama	868	' For to set a man upon the way to Freedom is half as great as though she had herself found it . '

Kindly villagers , remembering the Dacca drug - vendor of two months ago , give him shelter against evil spirits of the wood . He dreams of Bengali Gods , University text - books of education , and the Royal Society , London , England . Next dawn the bobbing blue - and - white umbrella goes forward . On the edge of the Doon , Mussoorie well behind them and the Plains spread out in golden dust before , rests a worn litter in which - all the Hills know it - lies a sick lama who seeks a River for his healing . Villages have almost come to blows over the honour of bearing it , for not only has the lama given them blessings , but his disciple good money - full one - third Sahibs '
123462	123468	123470	123471	the lama	868	' Ye have acquired merit , '
123473	123488	123489	123489	he	868	' Merit greater than your knowing . And ye will return to the Hills , '
123492	123504	123489	123489	he	868	' Surely . The high Hills as soon as may be . '

123738	123754	123628	123629	The lama	868	' Ay , our Search is sure . I have come out of great temptation . '
123885	123947	123859	123860	the lama	868	' Never was such a chela . I doubt at times whether Ananda more faithfully nursed Our Lord . And thou art a Sahib ? When I was a man - a long time ago - I forgot that . Now I look upon thee often , and every time I remember that thou art a Sahib . It is strange . '
123948	124000	123859	123860	the lama	868	' Thou hast said there is neither black nor white . Why plague me with this talk , Holy One ? Let me rub the other foot . It vexes me . I am not a Sahib . I am thy chela , and my head is heavy on my shoulders . '
124001	124038	123859	123860	the lama	868	' Patience a little ! We reach Freedom together . Then thou and I , upon the far bank of the River , will look back upon our lives as in the Hills we saw our days '

There fall shadows when I would look steadily . No matter - we know the tricks of the poor stupid carcass - shadow changing to another shadow . I am bound by the illusion of Time and Space . How far came we today in the flesh ? '
124148	124154	123859	123860	the lama	868	' Perhaps half a koss . '

124323	124401	124290	124290	he	344	' Not that either . I have moved in one matter without consulting thee . I have sent a message to the Kulu woman by that woman who gave us the goat 's milk this morn , saying that thou wast a little feeble and wouldst need a litter . I beat myself in my mind that I did not do it when we entered the Doon . We stay in this place till the litter returns . '
124402	124430	124290	124290	he	344	' I am content . She is a woman with a heart of gold , as thou sayest , but a talker - something of a talker . '
124431	124460	124290	124290	he	344	' She will not weary thee . I have looked to that also . Holy One , my heart is very heavy for my many carelessnesses towards thee . '
124469	124543	124290	124290	he	344	' I have walked thee too far : I have not picked good food always for thee ; I have not considered the heat ; I have talked to people on the road and left thee alone ...

Child , I have lived on thy strength as an old tree lives on the lime of a new wall . Day by day , since Shamlegh down , I have stolen strength from thee . Therefore , not through any sin of thine , art thou weakened . It is the Body - the silly , stupid Body - that speaks now . Not the assured Soul . Be comforted ! Know at least the devils that thou fightest . They are earth - born - children of illusion . We will go to the woman from Kulu . She shall acquire merit in housing us , and specially in tending me . Thou shalt run free till strength returns . I had forgotten the stupid Body . If there be any blame , I bear it . But we are too close to the Gates of Deliverance to weigh blame . I could praise thee , but what need ? In a little - in a very little - we shall sit beyond all needs . '
124833	124998	125003	125003	his	4302	' Hai ! hai ! Let us talk of the woman from Kulu . Think you she will ask another charm for her grandsons ? When I was a young man , a very long time ago , I was plagued with these vapours - and some others - and I went to an Abbot - a very holy man and a seeker after truth , though then I knew it not . Sit up and listen , child of my soul ! My tale was told . Said he to me , " Chela , know this . There are many lies in the world , and not a few liars , but there are no liars like our bodies , except it be the sensations of our bodies . " Considering this I was comforted , and of his great favour he suffered me to drink tea In his presence . Suffer me now to drink tea , for I am thirsty . '

Now a grandmother is far enough separated from the pain of bearing and the pleasure of giving the breast to consider whether a cry is wickedness pure or the wind . And since thou speakest once again of wind , when last the Holy One was here , maybe I offended in pressing for charms . '

Then , when he has nearly broken what thou hast left of my heart with anxiety , he tells me that he has acquired merit . Oh , how like are all men ! No , that was not it - he tells me that he is freed from all sin . I could have told him that before he wetted himself all over . He is well now - this happened a week ago - but burn me such holiness ! A babe of three would do better . Do not fret thyself for the Holy One .

By Jove ! they had not one dam'-thing that I did not get them . And I told the common people - oah , such tales and anecdotes ! - I will tell you at old Lurgan 's when you come up . We will have - ah - a night out ! It is feather in both our caps ! Yess , and they gave me a certificate . That is creaming joke . You should have seen them at the Alliance Bank identifying themselves ! And thank Almighty God you got their papers so well ! You do not laugh verree much , but you shall laugh when you are well . Now I will go straight to the railway and get out . You shall have all sorts of credits for your game . When do you come along ? We are very proud of you though you gave us great frights . And especially Mahbub . '
128856	128866	128581	128582	The Babu	400	' Ay , Mahbub . And where is he ? '
128867	128879	128273	128273	He	0	' Selling horses in this vi - cinity , of course . '
128880	128897	128898	128899	The Babu	400	' Here ! Why ? Speak slowly . There is a thickness in my head still . '
128906	129007	128898	128899	The Babu	400	' Well , you see , I am fearful man , and I do not like responsibility . You were sick , you see , and I did not know where deuce - an'-all the papers were , and if so , how many . So when I had come down here I slipped in private wire to Mahbub - he was at Meerut for races - and I tell him how case stands . He comes up with his men and he consorts with the lama , and then he calls me a fool , and is very rude - '
129008	129014	128273	128273	He	0	' But wherefore - wherefore ? '
129015	129065	128273	128273	He	0	' That is what I ask . I only suggest that if anyone steals the papers I should like some good strong , brave men to rob them back again . You see , they are vitally important , and Mahbub Ali he did not know where you were . '
129066	129082	129084	129084	Kim	344	' Mahbub Ali to rob the Sahiba 's house ? Thou art mad , Babu , '
129088	129116	129084	129084	Kim	344	' I wanted the papers . Suppose she had stole them ? It was only practical suggestion , I think . You are not pleased , eh ? '
129131	129134	129136	129136	Hurree	400	' Well , '
129141	129267	129136	129136	Hurree	400	' there is no accounting for thee taste . Mahbub was angry too . He has sold horses all about here , and he says old lady is pukka thorough old lady and would not condescend to such ungentlemanly things . I do not care . I have got the papers , and I was very glad of moral support from Mahbub . I tell you , I am fearful man , but , somehow or other , the more fearful I am the more dam'-tight places I get into . So I was glad you came with me to Chini , and I am glad Mahbub was close by . The old lady she is sometimes very rude to me and my beautiful pills . '
129268	129273	129275	129275	Kim	344	' Allah be merciful ! '
129282	129309	129275	129275	Kim	344	' What a beast of wonder is a Babu ! And that man walked alone - if he did walk - with robbed and angry foreigners ! '
129310	129435	129436	129436	He	4403	' Oah , thatt was nothing , after they had done beating me ; but if I lost the papers it was pretty - jolly serious . Mahbub he nearly beat me too , and he went and consorted with the lama no end . I shall stick to ethnological investigations henceforwards . Now good - bye , Mister O'Hara . I can catch 4.25 p.m. to Umballa if I am quick . It will be good times when we all tell thee tale up at Mr Lurgan 's . I shall report you offeecially better . Good - bye , my dear fallow , and when next you are under thee emotions please do not use the Mohammedan terms with the Tibetan dress . '
129473	129478	129480	129480	Kim	344	' He robbed them , '
129490	129562	129480	129480	Kim	344	' He tricked them . He lied to them like a Bengali . They give him a chit a testimonial . He makes them a mock at the risk of his life - I never would have gone down to them after the pistol - shots - and then he says he is a fearful man ... And he is a fearful man . I must get into the world again . '
129854	129868	129869	129869	His	344	' I am Kim . I am Kim . And what is Kim ? '
130034	130064	130023	130024	the Sahiba	633	' Let him go . I have done my share . Mother Earth must do the rest . When the Holy One comes back from meditation , tell him . '
130317	130331	130333	130336	the horse - dealer	2470	' Allah ! What a fool 's trick to play in open country ! '
130338	130354	130333	130336	the horse - dealer	2470	' He could be shot a hundred times - but this is not the Border . '
130355	130358	130360	130361	the lama	868	' And , '
130372	130410	130360	130361	the lama	868	' never was such a chela . Temperate , kindly , wise , of ungrudging disposition , a merry heart upon the road , never forgetting , learned , truthful , courteous . Great is his reward ! '
130411	130422	130333	130336	the horse - dealer	2470	' I know the boy - as I have said . '
130423	130431	130333	130336	the horse - dealer	2470	' And he was all those things ? '
130432	130461	130333	130336	the horse - dealer	2470	' Some of them - but I have not yet found a Red Hat 's charm for making him overly truthful . He has certainly been well nursed . '
130462	130471	130473	130474	the lama	868	' The Sahiba is a heart of gold , '
130477	130486	130473	130474	the lama	868	' She looks upon him as her son . '
130487	130535	130333	130336	the horse - dealer	2470	' Hmph ! Half Hind seems that way disposed . I only wished to see that the boy had come to no harm and was a free agent . As thou knowest , he and I were old friends in the first days of your pilgrimage together . '
130536	130544	130545	130546	The lama	868	' That is a bond between us . '
130550	130560	130545	130546	The lama	868	' We are at the end of the pilgrimage . '
130561	130596	130597	130597	Mahbub	383	' No thanks to thee thine was not cut off for good and all a week back . I heard what the Sahiba said to thee when we bore thee up on the cot . '
130607	130627	130602	130602	his	383	' I was meditating upon other matters that tide . It was the hakim from Dacca broke my meditations . '
130628	130630	130545	130546	The lama	868	' Otherwise '
130641	130680	130545	130546	The lama	868	' thou wouldst have ended thy meditations upon the sultry side of Hell - being an unbeliever and an idolater for all thy child 's simplicity . But now , Red Hat , what is to be done ? '
130681	130686	130545	130546	The lama	868	' This very night , '
130697	130738	130740	130740	he	383	' this very night he will be as free as I am from all taint of sin - assured as I am , when he quits this body , of Freedom from the Wheel of Things . I have a sign '
130752	130785	130740	130740	he	383	' that my time is short ; but I shall have safeguarded him throughout the years . Remember , I have reached Knowledge , as I told thee only three nights back . '
130786	130820	130822	130822	Mahbub	383	' It must be true , as the Tirah priest said when I stole his cousin 's wife , that I am a Sufi a free - thinker ; for here I sit , '
130826	130873	130824	130824	himself	383	' drinking in blasphemy unthinkable ... I remember the tale . On that , then , he goes to Fannatu l'Adn the Gardens of Eden . But how ? Wilt thou slay him or drown him in that wonderful river from which the Babu dragged thee ? '
130874	130882	130884	130885	the lama	868	' I was dragged from no river , '
130888	130901	130884	130885	the lama	868	' Thou hast forgotten what befell . I found it by Knowledge . '
130902	130909	130911	130911	Mahbub	383	' Oh , ay . True , '
130921	130938	130911	130911	Mahbub	383	' I had forgotten the exact run of what happened . Thou didst find it knowingly . '
130939	130980	130824	130824	himself	383	' And to say that I would take life is - not a sin , but a madness simple . My chela aided me to the River . It is his right to be cleansed from sin - with me . '
130981	130996	130824	130824	himself	383	' Ay , he needs cleansing . But afterwards , old man - afterwards ? '
130997	131017	130911	130911	Mahbub	383	' What matter under all the Heavens ? He is sure of Nibban - enlightened - as I am . '
131018	131036	130824	130824	himself	383	' Well said . I had a fear he might mount Mohammed 's Horse and fly away . '
131037	131048	130824	130824	himself	383	' Nay - he must go forth as a teacher . '
131049	131089	130911	130911	Mahbub	383	' Aha ! Now I see ! That is the right gait for the colt . Certainly he must go forth as a teacher . He is somewhat urgently needed as a scribe by the State , for instance . '
131090	131172	130824	130824	himself	383	' To that end he was prepared . I acquired merit in that I gave alms for his sake . A good deed does not die . He aided me in my Search . I aided him in his . Just is the Wheel , O horse - seller from the North . Let him be a teacher ; let him be a scribe - what matter ? He will have attained Freedom at the end . The rest is illusion . '
131173	131286	130824	130824	himself	383	' What matter ? When I must have him with me beyond Balkh in six months ! I come up with ten lame horses and three strong - backed men - thanks to that chicken of a Babu - to break a sick boy by force out of an old trot 's house . It seems that I stand by while a young Sahib is hoisted into Allah knows what of an idolater 's Heaven by means of old Red Hat . And I am reckoned something of a player of the Game myself ! But the madman is fond of the boy ; and I must be very reasonably mad too . '
131287	131293	131295	131296	the lama	868	' What is the prayer ? '
131308	131364	131295	131296	the lama	868	' No matter at all ; but now I understand that the boy , sure of Paradise , can yet enter Government service , my mind is easier . I must get to my horses . It grows dark . Do not wake him . I have no wish to hear him call thee master . '
131365	131375	130824	130824	himself	383	' But he is my disciple . What else ? '
131376	131382	131383	131383	Mahbub	383	' He has told me . '
131394	131414	131422	131423	the lama	868	' I am not altogether of thy faith , Red Hat - if so small a matter concern thee . '
131415	131420	131422	131423	the lama	868	' It is nothing , '
131425	131556	131422	131423	the lama	868	' I thought not . Therefore it will not move thee , sinless , new- washed and three parts drowned to boot , when I call thee a good man - a very good man . We have talked together some four or five evenings now , and for all I am a horse - coper I can still , as the saying is , see holiness beyond the legs of a horse . Yea , can see , too , how our Friend of all the World put his hand in thine at the first . Use him well , and suffer him to return to the world as a teacher , when thou hast - bathed his legs , if that be the proper medicine for the colt . '
131557	131571	131572	131572	Mahbub	383	' Why not follow the Way thyself , and so accompany the boy ? '
131607	131657	131422	131423	the lama	868	' Softly - softly - one foot at a time , as the lame gelding went over the Umballa jumps . I may come to Paradise later - I have workings that way - great motions - and I owe them to thy simplicity . Thou hast never lied ? '
131658	131662	131422	131423	the lama	868	' What need ? '
131663	131685	131422	131423	the lama	868	' O Allah , hear him ! " What need " in this Thy world ! Nor ever harmed a man ? '
131686	131698	131422	131423	the lama	868	' Once - with a pencase - before I was wise . '
131699	131728	131729	131729	He	4436	' So ? I think the better of thee . Thy teachings are good . Thou hast turned one man that I know from the path of strife . '
131733	131767	131729	131729	He	4436	' He came here open - minded to commit a dacoity a house - robbery with violence . Yes , to cut , rob , kill , and carry off what he desired . '
131768	131773	131422	131423	the lama	868	' A great foolishness ! '
131774	131816	131422	131423	the lama	868	' Oh ! black shame too . So he thought after he had seen thee - and a few others , male and female . So he abandoned it ; and now he goes to beat a big fat Babu man . '
131817	131823	131729	131729	He	4436	' I do not understand . '
131824	131867	131872	131872	his	4436	' Allah forbid it ! Some men are strong in knowledge , Red Hat . Thy strength is stronger still . Keep it - I think thou wilt . If the boy be not a good servant , pull his ears off . '
131902	131955	131885	131886	the lama	868	' That person lacks courtesy , and is deceived by the shadow of appearances . But he spoke well of my chela , who now enters upon his reward . Let me make the prayer ! ... Wake , O fortunate above all born of women . Wake ! It is found ! '
131981	132010	132012	132012	he	868	' I have slept a hundred years . Where - ? Holy One , hast thou been here long ? I went out to look for thee , but '
132016	132079	132012	132012	he	868	' I slept by the way . I am all well now . Hast thou eaten ? Let us go to the house . It is many days since I tended thee . And the Sahiba fed thee well ? Who shampooed thy legs ? What of the weaknesses - the belly and the neck , and the beating in the ears ? '
132080	132091	132012	132012	he	868	' Gone - all gone . Dost thou not know ? '
132092	132113	132012	132012	he	868	' I know nothing , but that I have not seen thee in a monkey 's age . Know what ? '
132114	132132	132012	132012	he	868	' Strange the knowledge did not reach out to thee , when all my thoughts were theeward . '
132133	132162	132163	132163	He	4440	' I can not see the face , but the voice is like a gong . Has the Sahiba made a young man of thee by her cookery ? '
132244	132252	132517	132517	his	344	' Hear me ! I bring news . '
132253	132258	132517	132517	his	344	' But let us - '
132279	132494	132268	132268	Kim	344	' Hear me ! I bring news ! The Search is finished . Comes now the Reward ... Thus . When we were among the Hills , I lived on thy strength till the young branch bowed and nigh broke . When we came out of the Hills , I was troubled for thee and for other matters which I held in my heart . The boat of my soul lacked direction ; I could not see into the Cause of Things . So I gave thee over to the virtuous woman altogether . I took no food . I drank no water . Still I saw not the Way . They pressed food upon me and cried at my shut door . So I removed myself to a hollow under a tree . I took no food . I took no water . I sat in meditation two days and two nights , abstracting my mind ; inbreathing and outbreathing in the required manner ... Upon the second night - so great was my reward - the wise Soul loosed itself from the silly Body and went free . This I have never before attained , though I have stood on the threshold of it . Consider , for it is a marvel ! '
132495	132513	132515	132515	Kim	344	' A marvel indeed . Two days and two nights without food ! Where was the Sahiba ? '
132520	133105	132515	132515	Kim	344	' Yea , my Soul went free , and , wheeling like an eagle , saw indeed that there was no Teshoo Lama nor any other soul . As a drop draws to water , so my Soul drew near to the Great Soul which is beyond all things . At that point , exalted in contemplation , I saw all Hind , from Ceylon in the sea to the Hills , and my own Painted Rocks at Such - zen ; I saw every camp and village , to the least , where we have ever rested . I saw them at one time and in one place ; for they were within the Soul . By this I knew the Soul had passed beyond the illusion of Time and Space and of Things . By this I knew that I was free . I saw thee lying in thy cot , and I saw thee falling downhill under the idolater - at one time , in one place , in my Soul , which , as I say , had touched the Great Soul . Also I saw the stupid body of Teshoo Lama lying down , and the hakim from Dacca kneeled beside , shouting in its ear . Then my Soul was all alone , and I saw nothing , for I was all things , having reached the Great Soul . And I meditated a thousand thousand years , passionless , well aware of the Causes of all Things . Then a voice cried : " What shall come to the boy if thou art dead ? " and I was shaken back and forth in myself with pity for thee ; and I said : " I will return to my chela , lest he miss the Way . " Upon this my Soul , which is the Soul of Teshoo Lama , withdrew itself from the Great Soul with strivings and yearnings and retchings and agonies not to be told . As the egg from the fish , as the fish from the water , as the water from the cloud , as the cloud from the thick air , so put forth , so leaped out , so drew away , so fumed up the Soul of Teshoo Lama from the Great Soul . Then a voice cried : " The River ! Take heed to the River ! " and I looked down upon all the world , which was as I had seen it before - one in time , one in place - and I saw plainly the River of the Arrow at my feet . At that hour my Soul was hampered by some evil or other whereof I was not wholly cleansed , and it lay upon my arms and coiled round my waist ; but I put it aside , and I cast forth as an eagle in my flight for the very place of the River . I pushed aside world upon world for thy sake . I saw the River below me - the River of the Arrow - and , descending , the waters of it closed over me ; and behold I was again in the body of Teshoo Lama , but free from sin , and the hakim from Decca bore up my head in the waters of the River . It is here ! It is behind the mango- tope here - even here ! '
133106	133124	132517	132517	his	344	' Allah kerim ! Oh , well that the Babu was by ! Wast thou very wet ? '
133125	133191	132517	132517	his	344	' Why should I regard ? I remember the hakim was concerned for the body of Teshoo Lama . He haled it out of the holy water in his hands , and there came afterwards thy horse - seller from the North with a cot and men , and they put the body on the cot and bore it up to the Sahiba 's house . '
133192	133198	132515	132515	Kim	344	' What said the Sahiba ? '
133199	133295	133296	133296	He	4443	' I was meditating in that body , and did not hear . So thus the Search is ended . For the merit that I have acquired , the River of the Arrow is here . It broke forth at our feet , as I have said . I have found it . Son of my Soul , I have wrenched my Soul back from the Threshold of Freedom to free thee from all sin - as I am free , and sinless ! Just is the Wheel ! Certain is our deliverance ! Come ! '
