14431	14437	14439	14441	the young gentleman	1223	" A fog , miss , "
14443	14448	14450	14450	I.	0	" Oh , indeed ! "
14623	14658	14660	14662	the young gentleman	1223	" In case you should wish to look at yourself , miss , after the journey , as you 're going before the Chancellor . Not that it 's requisite , I am sure , "
14665	14671	14660	14662	the young gentleman	1223	" Going before the Chancellor ? "
14680	14689	14691	14693	the young gentleman	1223	" Only a matter of form , miss , "
14695	14715	14691	14693	the young gentleman	1223	" Mr. Kenge is in court now . He left his compliments , and would you partake of some refreshment "
14730	14737	14739	14741	the young gentleman	1223	" and look over the paper , "
14973	14999	15000	15000	he	286	" As you are going to be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor 's private room , Miss Summerson , "
15003	15030	15000	15000	he	286	" we thought it well that you should be in attendance also . You will not be discomposed by the Lord Chancellor , I dare say ? "
15031	15036	15037	15037	I	0	" No , sir , "
15040	15048	15037	15037	I	0	" I do n't think I shall , "
15187	15191	15193	15194	Mr. Kenge	286	" Miss Ada , "
15196	15202	15193	15194	Mr. Kenge	286	" this is Miss Summerson . "
15718	15722	15724	15726	the Lord Chancellor	722	" Miss Clare , "
15728	15733	15724	15726	the Lord Chancellor	722	" Miss Ada Clare ? "
15811	15817	15819	15826	the Lord Chancellor , still turning over leaves	1279	" The Jarndyce in question , "
15828	15835	15819	15826	the Lord Chancellor , still turning over leaves	1279	" is Jarndyce of Bleak House . "
15836	15845	15847	15848	Mr. Kenge	286	" Jarndyce of Bleak House , my lord , "
15850	15855	15857	15859	the Lord Chancellor	722	" A dreary name , "
15861	15873	15875	15876	Mr. Kenge	286	" But not a dreary place at present , my lord , "
15878	15883	15885	15886	his lordship	1262	" And Bleak House , "
15888	15892	15885	15886	his lordship	1262	" is in - "
15893	15899	15912	15913	his lordship	1262	" Hertfordshire , my lord . "
15900	15910	15912	15913	his lordship	1262	" Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married ? "
15915	15923	15925	15926	Mr. Kenge	286	" He is not , my lord , "
15931	15939	15941	15943	the Lord Chancellor	722	" Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present ? "
15955	15958	15960	15962	the Lord Chancellor	722	" Hum ! "
15969	15979	15960	15962	the Lord Chancellor	722	" Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House , my lord , "
15988	16004	15980	15981	Mr. Kenge	286	" if I may venture to remind your lordship , provides a suitable companion for - "
16005	16011	16012	16012	I	0	" For Mr. Richard Carstone ? "
16035	16050	16022	16023	his lordship	1262	" For Miss Ada Clare . This is the young lady . Miss Summerson . "
16065	16081	16051	16052	His lordship	1262	" Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause , I think ? "
16082	16088	16089	16090	Mr. Kenge	286	" No , my lord . "
16289	16293	16295	16296	his lordship	1262	" Very well ! "
16299	16321	16295	16296	his lordship	1262	" I shall make the order . Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House has chosen , so far as I may judge , "
16331	16354	16355	16355	He	722	" a very good companion for the young lady , and the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the circumstances admit . "
16439	16442	16444	16445	Richard Carstone	295	" Well ! "
16447	16462	16444	16445	Richard Carstone	295	" THAT 'S over ! And where do we go next , Miss Summerson ? "
16463	16469	16470	16470	I	0	" Do n't you know ? "
16473	16479	16481	16481	he	722	" Not in the least , "
16483	16493	16481	16481	he	722	" And do n't YOU know , my love ? "
16498	16501	16503	16503	she	294	" No ! "
16505	16510	16503	16503	she	294	" Do n't you ? "
16511	16516	16518	16518	I.	0	" Not at all ! "
16565	16568	16570	16570	she	294	" Oh ! "
16572	16624	16570	16570	she	294	" The wards in Jarndyce ! Ve - ry happy , I am sure , to have the honour ! It is a good omen for youth , and hope , and beauty when they find themselves in this place , and do n't know what 's to come of it . "
16625	16628	16630	16630	Richard	295	" Mad ! "
16639	16647	16648	16648	she	294	" Right ! Mad , young gentleman , "
16658	16673	16648	16648	she	294	" I was a ward myself . I was not mad at that time , "
16683	16765	16648	16648	she	294	" I had youth and hope . I believe , beauty . It matters very little now . Neither of the three served or saved me . I have the honour to attend court regularly . With my documents . I expect a judgment . Shortly . On the Day of Judgment . I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in the Revelations is the Great Seal . It has been open a long time ! Pray accept my blessing . "
16791	16796	16797	16797	she	1301	" Ye - es ! "
16801	16823	16797	16797	she	1301	" I imagine so . And here is Conversation Kenge . With HIS documents ! How does your honourable worship do ? "
16824	16843	16845	16846	Mr. Kenge	286	" Quite well , quite well ! Now do n't be troublesome , that 's a good soul ! "
16853	16858	16860	16863	the poor old lady	1301	" By no means , "
16872	16918	16919	16919	She	1301	" Anything but troublesome . I shall confer estates on both - which is not being troublesome , I trust ? I expect a judgment . Shortly . On the Day of Judgment . This is a good omen for you . Accept my blessing ! "
16962	16985	16943	16943	she	1301	" Youth . And hope . And beauty . And Chancery . And Conversation Kenge ! Ha ! Pray accept my blessing ! "
17033	17041	17042	17042	I	0	" I really do n't , sir , "
17045	17054	17042	17042	I	0	" Perhaps Mr. Carstone - or Miss Clare - "
17066	17074	17076	17077	Mr. Kenge	286	" In - deed ! Mrs. Jellyby , "
17105	17229	17230	17231	Mr. Kenge	286	" is a lady of very remarkable strength of character who devotes herself entirely to the public . She has devoted herself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times and is at present until something else attracts her devoted to the subject of Africa , with a view to the general cultivation of the coffee berry - AND the natives - and the happy settlement , on the banks of the African rivers , of our superabundant home population . Mr. Jarndyce , who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely to be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists , has , I believe , a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby . "
17242	17249	17251	17251	Richard	295	" And Mr. Jellyby , sir ? "
17253	17259	17261	17262	Mr. Kenge	286	" Ah ! Mr. Jellyby , "
17264	17293	17261	17262	Mr. Kenge	286	" is - a - I do n't know that I can describe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of Mrs. Jellyby . "
17294	17300	17302	17302	Richard	295	" A nonentity , sir ? "
17308	17315	17317	17318	Mr. Kenge	286	" I do n't say that , "
17321	17383	17317	17318	Mr. Kenge	286	" I ca n't say that , indeed , for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby . I never , to my knowledge , had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby . He may be a very superior man , but he is , so to speak , merged - merged - in the more shining qualities of his wife . "
17493	17521	17473	17474	Mr. Kenge	286	" Mr. Guppy said yes , they had been sent round , and a coach was waiting to take us round too as soon as we pleased . "
17527	17537	17473	17474	Mr. Kenge	286	" said Mr. Kenge , shaking hands with us , "
17615	17616	17607	17607	Guppy	300	" "
17626	17634	17623	17624	Mr. Guppy	301	" said Richard as we went downstairs . "
17638	17643	17623	17624	Mr. Guppy	301	" said Mr. Guppy ; "
17652	17653	17654	17654	I	0	" "
17675	17676	17623	17624	Mr. Guppy	301	" "
17682	17687	17688	17688	We	1316	" said Mr. Guppy . "
17730	17741	17728	17728	miss	9656	" He seemed quite delighted with it on my account . "
17749	17752	17728	17728	miss	9656	" said I. "
17765	17775	17761	17761	I	0	" said Mr. Guppy , putting up the steps . "
17794	17903	17787	17787	miss	9656	" I knew he meant well in paying me this compliment , so I laughed at myself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon the box ; and we all three laughed and chatted about our inexperience and the strangeness of London until we turned up under an archway to our destination - a narrow street of high houses like an oblong cistern to hold the fog . There was a confused little crowd of people , principally children , gathered about the house at which we stopped , which had a tarnished brass plate on the door with the inscription JELLYBY . "
17909	17921	17922	17926	One of the young Jellybys	1319	" said Mr. Guppy , looking in at the coach- window . "
17937	17938	17930	17930	his	1319	" "
17944	17948	17930	17930	his	1319	" said I ; "
17957	17958	17930	17930	his	1319	" "
17976	18270	18272	18274	two young ladies	1324	" said Mr. Guppy . I made my way to the poor child , who was one of the dirtiest little unfortunates I ever saw , and found him very hot and frightened and crying loudly , fixed by the neck between two iron railings , while a milkman and a beadle , with the kindest intentions possible , were endeavouring to drag him back by the legs , under a general impression that his skull was compressible by those means . As I found after pacifying him that he was a little boy with a naturally large head , I thought that perhaps where his head could go , his body could follow , and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to push him forward . This was so favourably received by the milkman and beadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I had not held his pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down through the kitchen to catch him when he should be released . At last he was happily got down without any accident , and then he began to beat Mr. Guppy with a hoop - stick in quite a frantic manner . Nobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in pattens , who had been poking at the child from below with a broom ; I do n't know with what object , and I do n't think she did . I therefore supposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home , and was quite surprised when the person appeared in the passage without the pattens , and going up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me , announced us as , "
18279	18443	18272	18274	two young ladies	1324	" We passed several more children on the way up , whom it was difficult to avoid treading on in the dark ; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby 's presence , one of the poor little things fell downstairs - down a whole flight as it sounded to me , with a great noise . Mrs. Jellyby , whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we could not help showing in our own faces as the dear child 's head recorded its passage with a bump on every stair - Richard afterwards said he counted seven , besides one for the landing - received us with perfect equanimity . She was a pretty , very diminutive , plump woman of from forty to fifty , with handsome eyes , though they had a curious habit of seeming to look a long way off . As if - I am quoting Richard again - they could see nothing nearer than Africa ! "
18450	18459	18271	18271	Them	1323	" said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice , "
18494	18786	18787	18787	You	1326	" We expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door , where there was a lame invalid of a sofa . Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair but was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it . The shawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped onto her chair when she advanced to us ; and as she turned to resume her seat , we could not help noticing that her dress did n't nearly meet up the back and that the open space was railed across with a lattice - work of stay - lace - like a summer - house . The room , which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great writing - table covered with similar litter , was , I must say , not only very untidy but very dirty . We were obliged to take notice of that with our sense of sight , even while , with our sense of hearing , we followed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs : I think into the back kitchen , where somebody seemed to stifle him . But what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy - looking though by no means plain girl at the writing - table , who sat biting the feather of her pen and staring at us . I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink . And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet , which were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden down at heel , she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her , from a pin upwards , that was in its proper condition or its right place . "
18794	18843	18844	18844	you	1326	" said Mrs. Jellyby , snuffing the two great office candles in tin candlesticks , which made the room taste strongly of hot tallow the fire had gone out , and there was nothing in the grate but ashes , a bundle of wood , and a poker , "
18944	18963	18929	18934	the natives of Borrioboola - Gha	1334	" As Ada said nothing , but looked at me , I said it must be very gratifying . "
18968	18973	18929	18934	the natives of Borrioboola - Gha	1334	" said Mrs. Jellyby . "
19027	19057	19019	19019	YOU	1326	" This application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I was quite at a loss how to receive it . I hinted that the climate - "
19065	19070	19019	19019	YOU	1326	" said Mrs. Jellyby . "
19075	19076	19019	19019	YOU	1326	" "
19082	19087	19088	19088	You	1326	" said Mrs. Jellyby . "
19122	19126	19102	19102	You	1326	" I said , "
19130	19137	19102	19102	You	1326	" I meant as to Holborn . "
19143	19156	19139	19139	you	1326	" said Mrs. Jellyby , putting a number of papers towards us , "
19197	19224	19194	19195	my amanuensis	1339	" The girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to our recognition , which was half bashful and half sulky . "
19235	19244	19194	19195	my amanuensis	1339	" proceeded Mrs. Jellyby with a sweet smile , "
19258	19259	19262	19262	her	1338	" "
19272	19276	19262	19262	her	1338	" said Caddy . "
19282	19289	19293	19293	him	305	" said Mrs. Jellyby , dictating , "
19317	19390	19396	19396	Peepy	306	" Peepy so self - named was the unfortunate child who had fallen downstairs , who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting himself , with a strip of plaster on his forehead , to exhibit his wounded knees , in which Ada and I did not know which to pity most - the bruises or the dirt . Mrs. Jellyby merely added , with the serene composure with which she said everything , "
19398	19537	19396	19396	Peepy	306	" and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again . However , as she at once proceeded with her dictation , and as I interrupted nothing by doing it , I ventured quietly to stop poor Peepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse . He looked very much astonished at it and at Ada 's kissing him , but soon fell fast asleep in my arms , sobbing at longer and longer intervals , until he was quiet . I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in detail , though I derived such a general impression from it of the momentous importance of Africa , and the utter insignificance of all other places and things , that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so little about it . "
19541	19546	19396	19396	Peepy	306	" said Mrs. Jellyby . "
19610	19673	19607	19608	Miss Summerson	283	" I begged permission to retain him , truly saying that he was not at all troublesome , and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed . Ada and I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between . They were excessively bare and disorderly , and the curtain to my window was fastened up with a fork . "
19685	19706	19607	19608	Miss Summerson	283	" said Miss Jellyby , looking round for a jug with a handle to it , but looking in vain . "
19714	19718	19607	19608	Miss Summerson	283	" said we . "
19727	19732	19607	19608	Miss Summerson	283	" returned Miss Jellyby ; "
19742	20012	19607	19608	Miss Summerson	283	" The evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a marshy smell that I must confess it was a little miserable , and Ada was half crying . We soon laughed , however , and were busily unpacking when Miss Jellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot water , but they could n't find the kettle , and the boiler was out of order . We begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to get down to the fire again . But all the little children had come up to the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my bed , and our attention was distracted by the constant apparition of noses and fingers in situations of danger between the hinges of the doors . It was impossible to shut the door of either room , for my lock , with no knob to it , looked as if it wanted to be wound up ; and though the handle of Ada 's went round and round with the greatest smoothness , it was attended with no effect whatever on the door . Therefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be very good at my table , and I would tell them the story of Little Red Riding Hood while I dressed ; which they did , and were as quiet as mice , including Peepy , who awoke opportunely before the appearance of the wolf . When we went downstairs we found a mug with "
20018	20720	20721	20721	I	0	" on it lighted up in the staircase window with a floating wick , and a young woman , with a swelled face bound up in a flannel bandage blowing the fire of the drawing - room now connected by an open door with Mrs. Jellyby 's room and choking dreadfully . It smoked to that degree , in short , that we all sat coughing and crying with the windows open for half an hour , during which Mrs. Jellyby , with the same sweetness of temper , directed letters about Africa . Her being so employed was , I must say , a great relief to me , for Richard told us that he had washed his hands in a pie - dish and that they had found the kettle on his dressing - table , and he made Ada laugh so that they made me laugh in the most ridiculous manner . Soon after seven o'clock we went down to dinner , carefully , by Mrs. Jellyby 's advice , for the stair - carpets , besides being very deficient in stair - wires , were so torn as to be absolute traps . We had a fine cod - fish , a piece of roast beef , a dish of cutlets , and a pudding ; an excellent dinner , if it had had any cooking to speak of , but it was almost raw . The young woman with the flannel bandage waited , and dropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go , and never moved it again until she put it on the stairs . The person I had seen in pattens , who I suppose to have been the cook , frequently came and skirmished with her at the door , and there appeared to be ill will between them . All through dinner - which was long , in consequence of such accidents as the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle and the handle of the corkscrew coming off and striking the young woman in the chin - Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of her disposition . She told us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola - Gha and the natives , and received so many letters that Richard , who sat by her , saw four envelopes in the gravy at once . Some of the letters were proceedings of ladies ' committees or resolutions of ladies ' meetings , which she read to us ; others were applications from people excited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee , and natives ; others required answers , and these she sent her eldest daughter from the table three or four times to write . She was full of business and undoubtedly was , as she had told us , devoted to the cause . I was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in spectacles was , who dropped into a vacant chair there was no top or bottom in particular after the fish was taken away and seemed passively to submit himself to Borrioboola - Gha but not to be actively interested in that settlement . As he never spoke a word , he might have been a native but for his complexion . It was not until we left the table and he remained alone with Richard that the possibility of his being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head . But he WAS Mr. Jellyby ; and a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale , with large shining knobs for temples and his hair all brushed to the back of his head , who came in the evening , and told Ada he was a philanthropist , also informed her that he called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby with Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and matter . This young man , besides having a great deal to say for himself about Africa and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to teach the natives to turn piano - forte legs and establish an export trade , delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saving , "
20754	20757	20751	20751	you	298	" or , "
20789	20987	20773	20773	you	298	" - always repeating Mrs. Jellyby 's answer to us like an interpreter . During the whole evening , Mr. Jellyby sat in a corner with his head against the wall as if he were subject to low spirits . It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when alone with Richard after dinner , as if he had something on his mind , but had always shut it again , to Richard 's extreme confusion , without saying anything . Mrs. Jellyby , sitting in quite a nest of waste paper , drank coffee all the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter . She also held a discussion with Mr. Quale , of which the subject seemed to be - if I understood it - the brotherhood of humanity , and gave utterance to some beautiful sentiments . I was not so attentive an auditor as I might have wished to be , however , for Peepy and the other children came flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the drawing - room to ask for another story ; so we sat down among them and told them in whispers "
20991	21165	20773	20773	you	298	" and I do n't know what else until Mrs. Jellyby , accidentally remembering them , sent them to bed . As Peepy cried for me to take him to bed , I carried him upstairs , where the young woman with the flannel bandage charged into the midst of the little family like a dragon and overturned them into cribs . After that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in coaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn , which at last it did , quite brightly . On my return downstairs , I felt that Mrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous , and I was sorry for it , though at the same time I knew that I had no higher pretensions . It was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to bed , and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking coffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her pen . "
21171	21179	20773	20773	you	298	" said Ada when we got upstairs . "
21191	21192	21193	21194	My love	9686	" "
21196	21200	21193	21194	My love	9686	" said I , "
21221	21222	21213	21213	I	0	" "
21225	21233	21213	21213	I	0	" asked Ada with her pretty smile . "
21240	21243	21213	21213	I	0	" said I. "
21273	21309	21268	21268	Peepy	306	" Ada laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the fire , and told me I was a quiet , dear , good creature and had won her heart . "
21317	21321	21310	21310	You	1354	" she said , "
21347	21380	21336	21336	You	1354	" My simple darling ! She was quite unconscious that she only praised herself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she made so much of me ! "
21388	21402	21382	21382	I	0	" said I when we had sat before the fire a little while . "
21406	21410	21382	21382	I	0	" said Ada . "
21432	21466	21467	21467	Esther	283	" Shaking her golden hair , Ada turned her eyes upon me with such laughing wonder that I was full of wonder too , partly at her beauty , partly at her surprise . "
21469	21473	21467	21467	Esther	283	" she cried . "
21477	21478	21467	21467	Esther	283	" "
21488	21489	21479	21479	You	0	" "
21498	21499	21496	21496	him	1356	" "
21506	21587	21501	21501	I	0	" returned Ada . Well , to be sure ! No , she had never seen him . Young as she was when her mama died , she remembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of him and of the noble generosity of his character , which she had said was to be trusted above all earthly things ; and Ada trusted it . Her cousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months ago - "
21594	21611	21501	21501	I	0	" Ada said - proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on and telling her that "
21628	21695	21696	21700	a bluff , rosy fellow	1360	" She had replied , gratefully accepting his proposal . Richard had received a similar letter and had made a similar response . He HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once , but only once , five years ago , at Winchester school . He had told Ada , when they were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them , that he recollected him as "
21702	21801	21696	21700	a bluff , rosy fellow	1360	" This was the utmost description Ada could give me . It set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep , I still remained before the fire , wondering and wondering about Bleak House , and wondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long ago . I do n't know where my thoughts had wandered when they were recalled by a tap at the door . I opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a broken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg - cup in the other . "
21805	21811	21696	21700	a bluff , rosy fellow	1360	" she said very sulkily . "
21815	21818	21696	21700	a bluff , rosy fellow	1360	" said I. "
21824	21837	21820	21820	I	0	" she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same sulky way . "
21840	21843	21820	21820	I	0	" said I. "
21850	21897	21847	21848	Miss Clare	294	" She would not sit down , but stood by the fire dipping her inky middle finger in the egg - cup , which contained vinegar , and smearing it over the ink stains on her face , frowning the whole time and looking very gloomy . "
21904	21917	21918	21918	I	0	" she said on a sudden . I was going to remonstrate . "
21921	21924	21918	21918	I	0	" she said "
21946	22013	22014	22014	She	1361	" I told her she was tired , and I was sorry . I put my hand upon her head , and touched her forehead , and said it was hot now but would be cool to - morrow . She still stood pouting and frowning at me , but presently put down her egg - cup and turned softly towards the bed where Ada lay . "
22019	22040	22041	22042	An orphan	1362	" she said with the same knitted brow and in the same uncivil manner . I assented with a smile . "
22048	22049	22046	22046	she	1361	" "
22052	22053	22046	22046	she	1361	" "
22093	22094	22072	22072	She	1361	" "
22098	22101	22072	22072	She	1361	" said I. "
22106	22110	22111	22111	I	0	" she returned . "
22169	22202	22165	22165	I	0	" I could see that the poor girl was near crying , and I resumed my chair without speaking and looked at her I hope as mildly as I felt towards her . "
22207	22211	22212	22212	You	1363	" she said . "
22289	22290	22291	22291	My	0	" "
22300	22303	22294	22294	I	0	" said I. "
22307	22313	22304	22304	You	1363	" she said very shortly . "
22325	22326	22322	22322	You	1363	" "
22332	22335	22322	22322	You	1363	" said I. "
22344	22345	22346	22346	You	1363	" "
22364	22365	22361	22362	Miss Summerson	283	" "
22369	22373	22361	22362	Miss Summerson	283	" said I , "
22384	22385	22377	22377	you	9610	" "
22395	22396	22386	22386	I	0	" "
22406	22410	22403	22403	you	9610	" said I , "
22456	22457	22458	22458	You	9610	" "
22467	22471	22458	22458	You	9610	" said she . "
22477	22480	22458	22458	You	9610	" said I. "
22487	22549	22550	22550	I	0	" She was still standing by the bed , and now stooped down but still with the same discontented face and kissed Ada . That done , she came softly back and stood by the side of my chair . Her bosom was heaving in a distressful manner that I greatly pitied , but I thought it better not to speak . "
22556	22561	22562	22562	I	0	" she broke out . "
22579	22631	22632	22632	You	1375	" In a moment afterwards , she knelt on the ground at my side , hid her face in my dress , passionately begged my pardon , and wept . I comforted her and would have raised her , but she cried no , no ; she wanted to stay there ! "
22638	22642	22632	22632	You	1375	" she said , "
22671	23016	23017	23017	Ma	1377	" I could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a ragged stool to where she was kneeling , and take that , and still hold my dress in the same manner . By degrees the poor tired girl fell asleep , and then I contrived to raise her head so that it should rest on my lap , and to cover us both with shawls . The fire went out , and all night long she slumbered thus before the ashy grate . At first I was painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself , with my eyes closed , among the scenes of the day . At length , by slow degrees , they became indistinct and mingled . I began to lose the identity of the sleeper resting on me . Now it was Ada , now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted . Now it was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling , now some one in authority at Bleak House . Lastly , it was no one , and I was no one . The purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened my eyes to encounter those of a dirty - faced little spectre fixed upon me . Peepy had scaled his crib , and crept down in his bed - gown and cap , and was so cold that his teeth were chattering as if he had cut them all . CHAPTER V A Morning Adventure Although the morning was raw , and although the fog still seemed heavy - I say seemed , for the windows were so encrusted with dirt that they would have made midsummer sunshine dim - I was sufficiently forewarned of the discomfort within doors at that early hour and sufficiently curious about London to think it a good idea on the part of Miss Jellyby when she proposed that we should go out for a walk . "
23027	23031	23017	23017	Ma	1377	" she said , "
23129	23130	23131	23131	I	0	" "
23141	23145	23131	23131	I	0	" said I , "
23154	23155	23160	23160	you	1380	" "
23163	23168	23160	23160	you	1380	" returned Miss Jellyby , "
23176	23576	23160	23160	you	1380	" Ada said she would go too , and was soon astir . I made a proposal to Peepy , in default of being able to do anything better for him , that he should let me wash him and afterwards lay him down on my bed again . To this he submitted with the best grace possible , staring at me during the whole operation as if he never had been , and never could again be , so astonished in his life - looking very miserable also , certainly , but making no complaint , and going snugly to sleep as soon as it was over . At first I was in two minds about taking such a liberty , but I soon reflected that nobody in the house was likely to notice it . What with the bustle of dispatching Peepy and the bustle of getting myself ready and helping Ada , I was soon quite in a glow . We found Miss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing- room , which Priscilla was then lighting with a smutty parlour candlestick , throwing the candle in to make it burn better . Everything was just as we had left it last night and was evidently intended to remain so . Below - stairs the dinner - cloth had not been taken away , but had been left ready for breakfast . Crumbs , dust , and waste - paper were all over the house . Some pewter pots and a milk - can hung on the area railings ; the door stood open ; and we met the cook round the corner coming out of a public - house , wiping her mouth . She mentioned , as she passed us , that she had been to see what o'clock it was . But before we met the cook , we met Richard , who was dancing up and down Thavies Inn to warm his feet . He was agreeably surprised to see us stirring so soon and said he would gladly share our walk . So he took care of Ada , and Miss Jellyby and I went first . I may mention that Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her sulky manner and that I really should not have thought she liked me much unless she had told me so . "
23584	23588	23160	23160	you	1380	" she asked . "
23594	23598	23160	23160	you	1380	" I replied . "
23603	23611	23160	23160	you	1380	" said Miss Jellyby , stopping perversely . "
23620	23631	23632	23632	I	0	" said I. She then walked me on very fast . "
23637	23641	23632	23632	I	0	" she said . "
23707	23708	23709	23709	My	0	" "
23712	23731	23709	23709	My	0	" I remonstrated , in allusion to the epithet and the vigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it . "
23738	23739	23732	23732	Your	283	" "
23827	23835	23841	23841	I	0	" She walked me on faster yet . "
23932	24068	23928	23928	Ma	312	" I could not but understand her to refer to Mr. Quale , the young gentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday . I was saved the disagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada coming up at a round pace , laughing and asking us if we meant to run a race . Thus interrupted , Miss Jellyby became silent and walked moodily on at my side while I admired the long successions and varieties of streets , the quantity of people already going to and fro , the number of vehicles passing and repassing , the busy preparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping out of shops , and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly groping among the swept - out rubbish for pins and other refuse . "
24073	24085	24071	24071	cousin	1403	" said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me . "
24122	24150	24117	24119	the old lady	1406	" Truly , there she was , immediately in front of us , curtsying , and smiling , and saying with her yesterday 's air of patronage , "
24165	24166	24161	24161	I	0	" "
24174	24183	24184	24184	Ye	1406	" said I as she curtsied to me . "
24215	24222	24203	24203	I	0	" said the old lady mincingly . "
24246	24247	24252	24253	Miss Summerson	283	" "
24255	24284	24252	24253	Miss Summerson	283	" whispered Miss Jellyby , drawing my arm tighter through her own . The little old lady 's hearing was remarkably quick . She answered for herself directly . "
24322	24369	24309	24309	I	0	" said the old lady , recovering herself , with her head on one side , from a very low curtsy . Richard , anxious to atone for his thoughtlessness of yesterday , good - naturedly explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with the suit . "
24372	24378	24309	24309	I	0	" said the old lady . "
24461	24476	24459	24459	you	1417	" We said yes , as she seemed to expect us to say so . "
24505	24511	24459	24459	you	1417	" said the old lady , "
24572	24741	24565	24565	I	0	" She had taken my hand , and leading me and Miss Jellyby away , beckoned Richard and Ada to come too . I did not know how to excuse myself and looked to Richard for aid . As he was half amused and half curious and all in doubt how to get rid of the old lady without offence , she continued to lead us away , and he and Ada continued to follow , our strange conductress informing us all the time , with much smiling condescension , that she lived close by . It was quite true , as it soon appeared . She lived so close by that we had not time to have done humouring her for a few moments before she was at home . Slipping us out at a little side gate , the old lady stopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street , part of some courts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn , and said , "
24751	24966	24565	24565	I	0	" She had stopped at a shop over which was written KROOK , RAG AND BOTTLE WAREHOUSE . Also , in long thin letters , KROOK , DEALER IN MARINE STORES . In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill at which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags . In another was the inscription BONES BOUGHT . In another , KITCHEN - STUFF BOUGHT . In another , OLD IRON BOUGHT . In another , WASTE - PAPER BOUGHT . In another , LADIES ' AND GENTLEMEN 'S WARDROBES BOUGHT . Everything seemed to be bought and nothing to be sold there . In all parts of the window were quantities of dirty bottles - blacking bottles , medicine bottles , ginger - beer and soda- water bottles , pickle bottles , wine bottles , ink bottles ; I am reminded by mentioning the latter that the shop had in several little particulars the air of being in a legal neighbourhood and of being , as it were , a dirty hanger - on and disowned relation of the law . There were a great many ink bottles . There was a little tottering bench of shabby old volumes outside the door , labelled "
24974	25373	24565	24565	I	0	" Some of the inscriptions I have enumerated were written in law - hand , like the papers I had seen in Kenge and Carboy 's office and the letters I had so long received from the firm . Among them was one , in the same writing , having nothing to do with the business of the shop , but announcing that a respectable man aged forty - five wanted engrossing or copying to execute with neatness and dispatch : Address to Nemo , care of Mr. Krook , within . There were several second - hand bags , blue and red , hanging up . A little way within the shop - door lay heaps of old crackled parchment scrolls and discoloured and dog's - eared law - papers . I could have fancied that all the rusty keys , of which there must have been hundreds huddled together as old iron , had once belonged to doors of rooms or strong chests in lawyers ' offices . The litter of rags tumbled partly into and partly out of a one - legged wooden scale , hanging without any counterpoise from a beam , might have been counsellors ' bands and gowns torn up . One had only to fancy , as Richard whispered to Ada and me while we all stood looking in , that yonder bones in a corner , piled together and picked very clean , were the bones of clients , to make the picture complete . As it was still foggy and dark , and as the shop was blinded besides by the wall of Lincoln 's Inn , intercepting the light within a couple of yards , we should not have seen so much but for a lighted lantern that an old man in spectacles and a hairy cap was carrying about in the shop . Turning towards the door , he now caught sight of us . He was short , cadaverous , and withered , with his head sunk sideways between his shoulders and the breath issuing in visible smoke from his mouth as if he were on fire within . His throat , chin , and eyebrows were so frosted with white hairs and so gnarled with veins and puckered skin that he looked from his breast upward like some old root in a fall of snow . "
25378	25389	24565	24565	I	0	" said the old man , coming to the door . "
25396	25554	24565	24565	I	0	" We naturally drew back and glanced at our conductress , who had been trying to open the house - door with a key she had taken from her pocket , and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the pleasure of seeing where she lived , we would leave her , being pressed for time . But she was not to be so easily left . She became so fantastically and pressingly earnest in her entreaties that we would walk up and see her apartment for an instant , and was so bent , in her harmless way , on leading me in , as part of the good omen she desired , that I whatever the others might do saw nothing for it but to comply . I suppose we were all more or less curious ; at any rate , when the old man added his persuasions to hers and said , "
25588	25606	25607	25608	My landlord	1425	" we all went in , stimulated by Richard 's laughing encouragement and relying on his protection . "
25612	25633	25610	25610	Krook	251	" said the little old lady , condescending to him from her lofty station as she presented him to us . "
25675	25705	25670	25670	he	1425	" She shook her head a great many times and tapped her forehead with her finger to express to us that we must have the goodness to excuse him , "
25717	25734	25707	25707	he	1425	" said the old lady with great stateliness . The old man overheard , and laughed . "
25740	25751	25707	25707	he	1425	" he said , going before us with the lantern , "
25781	25782	25770	25770	they	1432	" "
25792	25798	25788	25788	I	0	" said Richard rather carelessly . "
25802	25813	25814	25814	they	1432	" said the old man , stopping and turning round , "
25850	25851	25856	25858	my good friend	706	" "
25860	25880	25856	25858	my good friend	706	" said Richard , strongly disapproving of his having drawn one of Ada 's tresses through his yellow hand . "
25895	25972	25973	25973	You	1431	" The old man darted at him a sudden look which even called my attention from Ada , who , startled and blushing , was so remarkably beautiful that she seemed to fix the wandering attention of the little old lady herself . But as Ada interposed and laughingly said she could only feel proud of such genuine admiration , Mr. Krook shrunk into his former self as suddenly as he had leaped out of it . "
25983	25992	25973	25973	You	1431	" he resumed , holding up the lantern , "
26188	26206	26185	26186	Lady Jane	317	" A large grey cat leaped from some neighbouring shelf on his shoulder and startled us all . "
26222	26256	26257	26257	She	1447	" said her master . The cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her tigerish claws , with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear . "
26272	26278	26279	26279	I	0	" said the old man . "
26328	26381	26326	26326	you	1449	" He had by this time led us across the shop , and now opened a door in the back part of it , leading to the house - entry . As he stood with his hand upon the lock , the little old lady graciously observed to him before passing out , "
26427	26428	26429	26429	Jarndyce	288	" "
26431	26440	26441	26441	Jarndyce	288	" said the old man with a start . "
26451	26456	26445	26447	The great suit	1453	" returned his lodger . "
26459	26478	26445	26447	The great suit	1453	" exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and with a wider stare than before . "
26483	26502	26445	26447	The great suit	1453	" He seemed so rapt all in a moment and looked so curiously at us that Richard said , "
26527	26528	26523	26525	the other Chancellor	1455	" "
26531	26538	26523	26525	the other Chancellor	1455	" said the old man abstractedly . "
26547	26548	26549	26550	Richard Carstone	295	" "
26552	26553	26554	26554	Carstone	295	" "
26556	26584	26554	26554	Carstone	295	" he repeated , slowly checking off that name upon his forefinger ; and each of the others he went on to mention upon a separate finger . "
26611	26612	26613	26613	He	1454	" "
26626	26638	26621	26624	the real salaried Chancellor	1456	" said Richard , quite astonished , to Ada and me . "
26641	26654	26621	26624	the real salaried Chancellor	1456	" said the old man , coming slowly out of his abstraction . "
26692	26699	26688	26688	she	1458	" nodding slightly at his lodger . "
26817	26823	26824	26824	He	256	" We listened with horror . "
26831	26846	26824	26824	He	256	" said the old man , slowly pointing an imaginary track along the shop , "
27062	27090	27091	27091	We	1470	" The old man stopped , looked hard at us , looked down into the lantern , blew the light out , and shut the lantern up . "
27191	27325	27326	27328	a little M	1478	" Ada 's colour had entirely left her , and Richard was scarcely less pale . Nor could I wonder , judging even from my emotions , and I was no party in the suit , that to hearts so untried and fresh it was a shock to come into the inheritance of a protracted misery , attended in the minds of many people with such dreadful recollections . I had another uneasiness , in the application of the painful story to the poor half - witted creature who had brought us there ; but , to my surprise , she seemed perfectly unconscious of that and only led the way upstairs again , informing us with the toleration of a superior creature for the infirmities of a common mortal that her landlord was "
27333	27447	27326	27328	a little M	1478	" She lived at the top of the house , in a pretty large room , from which she had a glimpse of Lincoln 's Inn Hall . This seemed to have been her principal inducement , originally , for taking up her residence there . She could look at it , she said , in the night , especially in the moonshine . Her room was clean , but very , very bare . I noticed the scantiest necessaries in the way of furniture ; a few old prints from books , of Chancellors and barristers , wafered against the wall ; and some half - dozen reticles and work - bags , "
27451	27534	27326	27328	a little M	1478	" as she informed us . There were neither coals nor ashes in the grate , and I saw no articles of clothing anywhere , nor any kind of food . Upon a shelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two , a cup or two , and so forth , but all dry and empty . There was a more affecting meaning in her pinched appearance , I thought as I looked round , than I had understood before . "
27542	27552	27538	27538	I	0	" said our poor hostess with the greatest suavity , "
27727	27776	27777	27777	I	0	" She partly drew aside the curtain of the long , low garret window and called our attention to a number of bird - cages hanging there , some containing several birds . There were larks , linnets , and goldfinches - I should think at least twenty . "
27785	27789	27777	27777	I	0	" she said , "
27890	27927	27857	27857	I	0	" Although she sometimes asked a question , she never seemed to expect a reply , but rambled on as if she were in the habit of doing so when no one but herself was present . "
27930	27934	27857	27857	I	0	" she pursued , "
27982	28027	28028	28028	I	0	" Richard , answering what he saw in Ada 's compassionate eyes , took the opportunity of laying some money , softly and unobserved , on the chimney - piece . We all drew nearer to the cages , feigning to examine the birds . "
28037	28044	28028	28028	I	0	" said the little old lady , "
28121	28127	28113	28113	they	1486	" a smile and curtsy , "
28130	28136	28113	28113	they	1486	" a smile and curtsy , "
28140	28146	28113	28113	they	1486	" a smile and curtsy . "
28157	28166	28149	28149	We	1491	" The birds began to stir and chirp . "
28175	28196	28167	28167	I	0	" said the little old lady - the room was close , and would have been the better for it - "
28229	28233	28225	28225	I	0	" whispering mysteriously , "
28301	28395	28296	28296	her	317	" Some neighbouring bells , reminding the poor soul that it was half- past nine , did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to an end than we could easily have done for ourselves . She hurriedly took up her little bag of documents , which she had laid upon the table on coming in , and asked if we were also going into court . On our answering no , and that we would on no account detain her , she opened the door to attend us downstairs . "
28419	28423	28414	28415	the Chancellor	813	" said she , "
28448	28519	28520	28523	The only other lodger	1495	" She stopped to tell us in a whisper as we were going down that the whole house was filled with strange lumber which her landlord had bought piecemeal and had no wish to sell , in consequence of being a little M. This was on the first floor . But she had made a previous stoppage on the second floor and had silently pointed at a dark door there . "
28525	28532	28520	28523	The only other lodger	1495	" she now whispered in explanation , "
28567	28583	28533	28535	a law- writer	1496	" She appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her even there , and repeating "
28586	28791	28533	28535	a law- writer	1496	" went before us on tiptoe as though even the sound of her footsteps might reveal to him what she had said . Passing through the shop on our way out , as we had passed through it on our way in , we found the old man storing a quantity of packets of waste - paper in a kind of well in the floor . He seemed to be working hard , with the perspiration standing on his forehead , and had a piece of chalk by him , with which , as he put each separate package or bundle down , he made a crooked mark on the panelling of the wall . Richard and Ada , and Miss Jellyby , and the little old lady had gone by him , and I was going when he touched me on the arm to stay me , and chalked the letter J upon the wall - in a very curious manner , beginning with the end of the letter and shaping it backward . It was a capital letter , not a printed one , but just such a letter as any clerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy 's office would have made . "
28797	28806	28793	28793	you	1500	" he asked me with a keen glance . "
28809	28812	28793	28793	you	1500	" said I. "
28818	28819	28793	28793	you	1500	" "
28824	28825	28793	28793	you	1500	" "
28827	28848	28533	28535	a law- writer	1496	" With another glance at me , and a glance at the door , he rubbed it out and turned an "
28850	28864	28793	28793	you	1500	" in its place not a capital letter this time , and said , "
28869	28883	28793	28793	you	1500	" I told him . He then rubbed that out and turned the letter "
28886	28932	28793	28793	you	1500	" and asked me the same question . He went on quickly until he had formed in the same curious manner , beginning at the ends and bottoms of the letters , the word Jarndyce , without once leaving two letters on the wall together . "
28938	28996	28793	28793	you	1500	" he asked me . When I told him , he laughed . In the same odd way , yet with the same rapidity , he then produced singly , and rubbed out singly , the letters forming the words Bleak House . These , in some astonishment , I also read ; and he laughed again . "
28999	29010	28793	28793	you	1500	" said the old man , laying aside the chalk . "
29033	29075	29076	29077	Miss Summerson	283	" He looked so disagreeable and his cat looked so wickedly at me , as if I were a blood - relation of the birds upstairs , that I was quite relieved by Richard 's appearing at the door and saying , "
29107	29215	29104	29105	Mr. Krook	251	" I lost no time in wishing Mr. Krook good morning and joining my friends outside , where we parted with the little old lady , who gave us her blessing with great ceremony and renewed her assurance of yesterday in reference to her intention of settling estates on Ada and me . Before we finally turned out of those lanes , we looked back and saw Mr. Krook standing at his shop - door , in his spectacles , looking after us , with his cat upon his shoulder , and her tail sticking up on one side of his hairy cap like a tall feather . "
29225	29232	29235	29235	cousin	1403	" said Richard with a sigh . "
29247	29248	29235	29235	cousin	1403	" "
29263	29267	29268	29268	I	0	" returned Ada . "
29366	29367	29370	29370	cousin	1403	" "
29372	29376	29370	29370	cousin	1403	" said Richard . "
29467	29468	29459	29459	Ada	294	" "
29477	29478	29459	29459	Ada	294	" "
29515	29516	29519	29519	I	0	" "
29525	30093	29522	29523	cousin Richard	295	" said Ada gently . Miss Jellyby gave my arm a squeeze and me a very significant look . I smiled in return , and we made the rest of the way back very pleasantly . In half an hour after our arrival , Mrs. Jellyby appeared ; and in the course of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast straggled one by one into the dining - room . I do not doubt that Mrs. Jellyby had gone to bed and got up in the usual manner , but she presented no appearance of having changed her dress . She was greatly occupied during breakfast , for the morning 's post brought a heavy correspondence relative to Borrioboola - Gha , which would occasion her she said to pass a busy day . The children tumbled about , and notched memoranda of their accidents in their legs , which were perfect little calendars of distress ; and Peepy was lost for an hour and a half , and brought home from Newgate market by a policeman . The equable manner in which Mrs. Jellyby sustained both his absence and his restoration to the family circle surprised us all . She was by that time perseveringly dictating to Caddy , and Caddy was fast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her . At one o'clock an open carriage arrived for us , and a cart for our luggage . Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to her good friend Mr. Jarndyce ; Caddy left her desk to see us depart , kissed me in the passage , and stood biting her pen and sobbing on the steps ; Peepy , I am happy to say , was asleep and spared the pain of separation I was not without misgivings that he had gone to Newgate market in search of me ; and all the other children got up behind the barouche and fell off , and we saw them , with great concern , scattered over the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out of its precincts . CHAPTER VI Quite at Home The day had brightened very much , and still brightened as we went westward . We went our way through the sunshine and the fresh air , wondering more and more at the extent of the streets , the brilliancy of the shops , the great traffic , and the crowds of people whom the pleasanter weather seemed to have brought out like many - coloured flowers . By and by we began to leave the wonderful city and to proceed through suburbs which , of themselves , would have made a pretty large town in my eyes ; and at last we got into a real country road again , with windmills , rick - yards , milestones , farmers ' waggons , scents of old hay , swinging signs , and horse troughs : trees , fields , and hedge - rows . It was delightful to see the green landscape before us and the immense metropolis behind ; and when a waggon with a train of beautiful horses , furnished with red trappings and clear - sounding bells , came by us with its music , I believe we could all three have sung to the bells , so cheerful were the influences around . "
30106	30110	30104	30104	Whittington	318	" said Richard , "
30126	30177	30178	30179	Our postilion	1519	" We had stopped , and the waggon had stopped too . Its music changed as the horses came to a stand , and subsided to a gentle tinkling , except when a horse tossed his head or shook himself and sprinkled off a little shower of bell - ringing . "
30186	30190	30192	30193	the waggoner	1520	" said Richard , "
30205	30215	30203	30203	friend	1522	" The waggoner was at our coach - door . "
30224	30234	30235	30235	He	1520	" added Richard , looking closely at the man . "
30247	30310	30311	30311	Master	1524	" He had all our names in his hat . Tucked within the band were three small notes - one addressed to Ada , one to Richard , one to me . These the waggoner delivered to each of us respectively , reading the name aloud first . In answer to Richard 's inquiry from whom they came , he briefly answered , "
30318	30348	30313	30313	sir	9569	" ; and putting on his hat again which was like a soft bowl , cracked his whip , re - awakened his music , and went melodiously away . "
30356	30366	30369	30369	sir	9569	" said Richard , calling to our post- boy . "
30371	30375	30369	30369	sir	9569	" he replied . "
30380	30404	30405	30405	I	0	" We opened the notes . Each was a counterpart of the other and contained these words in a solid , plain hand . "
30462	30465	30466	30466	I	0	" John Jarndyce "
31078	31084	31086	31086	his	1556	" That 's Bleak House ! "
31257	31296	31314	31314	his	1560	" Ada , my love , Esther , my dear , you are welcome . I rejoice to see you ! Rick , if I had a hand to spare at present , I would give it you ! "
31404	31409	31411	31411	he	1560	" Now , Rick ! "
31413	31448	31449	31449	Richard	295	" I have a hand at liberty . A word in earnest is as good as a speech . I am heartily glad to see you . You are at home . Warm yourself ! "
31487	31503	31506	31506	his	288	" You are very kind , sir ! We are very much obliged to you ! "
31517	31537	31539	31540	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" And how did you like the ride ? And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby , my dear ? "
31751	31762	31763	31763	I	0	" She exerts herself very much for Africa , sir , "
31766	31769	31763	31763	I	0	" Nobly ! "
31774	31781	31771	31772	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" But you answer like Ada . "
31788	31798	31771	31772	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" You all think something else , I see . "
31799	31804	31806	31806	I	0	" We rather thought , "
31823	31835	31812	31812	Ada	294	" that perhaps she was a little unmindful of her home . "
31836	31839	31841	31842	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Floored ! "
31850	31873	31844	31844	I	0	" Well ! I want to know your real thoughts , my dear . I may have sent you there on purpose . "
31874	31881	31883	31883	I	0	" We thought that , perhaps , "
31887	31923	31883	31883	I	0	" it is right to begin with the obligations of home , sir ; and that , perhaps , while those are overlooked and neglected , no other duties can possibly be substituted for them . "
31924	31929	31931	31931	Richard	295	" The little Jellybys , "
31938	31959	31931	31931	Richard	295	" are really - I ca n't help expressing myself strongly , sir - in a devil of a state . "
31960	31965	31967	31968	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" She means well , "
31971	31979	31967	31968	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" The wind 's in the east . "
31980	31994	31996	31996	Richard	295	" It was in the north , sir , as we came down , "
31998	32003	32005	32006	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" My dear Rick , "
32012	32049	32005	32006	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" I 'll take an oath it 's either in the east or going to be . I am always conscious of an uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing in the east . "
32050	32055	32057	32057	Richard	295	" Rheumatism , sir ? "
32059	32100	32102	32103	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" I dare say it is , Rick . I believe it is . And so the little Jell - I had my doubts about 'em - are in a - oh , Lord , yes , it 's easterly ! "
32202	32238	32240	32241	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Those little Jellybys . Could n't you - did n't you - now , if it had rained sugar - plums , or three - cornered raspberry tarts , or anything of that sort ! "
32243	32248	32249	32249	Ada	294	" Oh , cousin - "
32253	32272	32249	32249	Ada	294	" Good , my pretty pet . I like cousin . Cousin John , perhaps , is better . "
32273	32279	32280	32280	Ada	294	" Then , cousin John - "
32285	32294	32296	32297	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Ha , ha ! Very good indeed ! "
32302	32312	32296	32297	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Sounds uncommonly natural . Yes , my dear ? "
32313	32324	32280	32280	Ada	294	" It did better than that . It rained Esther . "
32325	32328	32330	32331	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Aye ? "
32333	32339	32330	32331	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" What did Esther do ? "
32340	32346	32348	32348	Ada	294	" Why , cousin John , "
32373	32405	32368	32368	her	294	" Esther was their friend directly . Esther nursed them , coaxed them to sleep , washed and dressed them , told them stories , kept them quiet , bought them keepsakes "
32432	32482	32483	32487	The warm - hearted darling	1570	" and , cousin John , she softened poor Caroline , the eldest one , so much and was so thoughtful for me and so amiable ! No , no , I wo n't be contradicted , Esther dear ! You know , you know , it 's true ! "
32508	32528	32533	32533	she	1570	" At all events , cousin John , I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me . "
32545	32556	32558	32559	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Where did you say the wind was , Rick ? "
32561	32572	32558	32559	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" In the north as we came down , sir . "
32573	32600	32558	32559	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" You are right . There 's no east in it . A mistake of mine . Come , girls , come and see your home ! "
33127	33130	33098	33098	you	1574	" Hold up "
33132	33136	33098	33098	you	1574	" Get over , "
33650	33658	33663	33663	he	288	" I am glad you like it , "
33676	33730	33663	33663	he	288	" It makes no pretensions , but it is a comfortable little place , I hope , and will be more so with such bright young looks in it . You have barely half an hour before dinner . There 's no one here but the finest creature upon earth - a child . "
33731	33737	33739	33739	Ada	294	" More children , Esther ! "
33741	33750	33739	33739	Ada	294	" I do n't mean literally a child , "
33755	33803	33739	33739	Ada	294	" not a child in years . He is grown up - he is at least as old as I am - but in simplicity , and freshness , and enthusiasm , and a fine guileless inaptitude for all worldly affairs , he is a perfect child . "
33813	33819	33821	33822	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" He knows Mrs. Jellyby , "
33824	33899	33821	33822	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" He is a musical man , an amateur , but might have been a professional . He is an artist too , an amateur , but might have been a professional . He is a man of attainments and of captivating manners . He has been unfortunate in his affairs , and unfortunate in his pursuits , and unfortunate in his family ; but he do n't care - he 's a child ! "
33900	33914	33916	33916	Richard	295	" Did you imply that he has children of his own , sir ? "
33918	33967	33969	33970	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Yes , Rick ! Half - a - dozen . More ! Nearer a dozen , I should think . But he has never looked after them . How could he ? He wanted somebody to look after HIM . He is a child , you know ! "
33972	33985	33987	33987	Richard	295	" And have the children looked after themselves at all , sir ? "
33989	33998	34000	34001	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Why , just as you may suppose , "
34008	34055	34056	34056	Richard	295	" It is said that the children of the very poor are not brought up , but dragged up . Harold Skimpole 's children have tumbled up somehow or other . The wind 's getting round again , I am afraid . I feel it rather ! "
34068	34073	34075	34076	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" It IS exposed , "
34078	34103	34075	34076	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" No doubt that 's the cause . Bleak House has an exposed sound . But you are coming my way . Come along ! "
34165	34175	34177	34177	she	294	" For you , miss , if you please , "
34179	34183	34177	34177	she	294	" For me ? "
34186	34193	34194	34194	I	0	" The housekeeping keys , miss . "
34211	34237	34200	34200	she	294	" I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone , miss . Miss Summerson , if I do n't deceive myself ? "
34238	34241	34243	34243	I.	0	" Yes , "
34244	34250	34243	34243	I.	0	" That is my name . "
34251	34294	34295	34295	I	0	" The large bunch is the housekeeping , and the little bunch is the cellars , miss . Any time you was pleased to appoint to - morrow morning , I was to show you the presses and things they belong to . "
34771	34775	34777	34778	Mr. Skimpole	326	" in which , "
34785	34791	34777	34778	Mr. Skimpole	326	" he was perfectly right , "
34806	34828	34801	34801	he	326	" nothing to live upon but love , fell in love , and married , and surrounded himself with rosy cheeks . "
35048	35097	35042	35042	He	326	" Go your several ways in peace ! Wear red coats , blue coats , lawn sleeves ; put pens behind your ears , wear aprons ; go after glory , holiness , commerce , trade , any object you prefer ; only - let Harold Skimpole live ! "
35253	35258	35260	35261	Mr. Skimpole	326	" I covet nothing , "
35268	35565	35260	35261	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Possession is nothing to me . Here is my friend Jarndyce 's excellent house . I feel obliged to him for possessing it . I can sketch it and alter it . I can set it to music . When I am here , I have sufficient possession of it and have neither trouble , cost , nor responsibility . My steward 's name , in short , is Jarndyce , and he ca n't cheat me . We have been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby . There is a bright - eyed woman , of a strong will and immense power of business detail , who throws herself into objects with surprising ardour ! I do n't regret that I have not a strong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself into objects with surprising ardour . I can admire her without envy . I can sympathize with the objects . I can dream of them . I can lie down on the grass - in fine weather - and float along an African river , embracing all the natives I meet , as sensible of the deep silence and sketching the dense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I were there . I do n't know that it 's of any direct use my doing so , but it 's all I can do , and I do it thoroughly . Then , for heaven 's sake , having Harold Skimpole , a confiding child , petitioning you , the world , an agglomeration of practical people of business habits , to let him live and admire the human family , do it somehow or other , like good souls , and suffer him to ride his rocking - horse ! "
35601	35615	35617	35618	Mr. Skimpole	326	" It 's only you , the generous creatures , whom I envy , "
35632	35768	35617	35618	Mr. Skimpole	326	" I envy you your power of doing what you do . It is what I should revel in myself . I do n't feel any vulgar gratitude to you . I almost feel as if YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the opportunity of enjoying the luxury of generosity . I know you like it . For anything I can tell , I may have come into the world expressly for the purpose of increasing your stock of happiness . I may have been born to be a benefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting me in my little perplexities . Why should I regret my incapacity for details and worldly affairs when it leads to such pleasant consequences ? I do n't regret it therefore . "
35961	35977	35957	35957	he	1659	" I am a child , you know ! You are designing people compared with me "
35987	36004	35957	35957	he	1659	" but I am gay and innocent ; forget your worldly arts and play with me ! "
36100	36107	36108	36108	he	1659	" She is like the morning , "
36111	36176	36108	36108	he	1659	" With that golden hair , those blue eyes , and that fresh bloom on her cheek , she is like the summer morning . The birds here will mistake her for it . We will not call such a lovely young creature as that , who is a joy to all mankind , an orphan . She is the child of the universe . "
36200	36204	36205	36205	he	288	" The universe , "
36208	36219	36205	36205	he	288	" makes rather an indifferent parent , I am afraid . "
36220	36228	36230	36231	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Oh ! I do n't know ! "
36234	36241	36243	36244	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" I think I do know , "
36246	36249	36251	36252	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Well ! "
36254	36287	36251	36252	Mr. Skimpole	326	" You know the world which in your sense is the universe , and I know nothing of it , so you shall have your way . But if I had mine , "
36293	36356	36290	36291	the cousins	1669	" there should be no brambles of sordid realities in such a path as that . It should be strewn with roses ; it should lie through bowers , where there was no spring , autumn , nor winter , but perpetual summer . Age or change should never wither it . The base word money should never be breathed near it ! "
36790	36803	36774	36781	the maid who had given me the keys	1677	" If you please , miss , could you spare a minute ? "
36823	36852	36815	36815	she	1677	" Oh , if you please , miss , Mr. Carstone says would you come upstairs to Mr. Skimpole 's room . He has been took , miss ! "
36853	36856	36858	36858	I.	0	" Took ? "
36859	36866	36868	36869	the maid	1173	" Took , miss . Sudden , "
37026	37030	37032	37032	Richard	295	" Miss Summerson , "
37035	37067	37032	37032	Richard	295	" I am glad you are come . You will be able to advise us . Our friend Mr. Skimpole - do n't be alarmed ! - is arrested for debt . "
37068	37077	37079	37080	Mr. Skimpole	326	" And really , my dear Miss Summerson , "
37086	37131	37082	37082	his	326	" I never was in a situation in which that excellent sense and quiet habit of method and usefulness , which anybody must observe in you who has the happiness of being a quarter of an hour in your society , was more needed . "
37159	37168	37155	37155	he	1685	" Are you arrested for much , sir ? "
37175	37181	37183	37183	he	326	" My dear Miss Summerson , "
37190	37211	37183	37183	he	326	" I do n't know . Some pounds , odd shillings , and halfpence , I think , were mentioned . "
37212	37226	37228	37229	the stranger	1240	" It 's twenty - four pound , sixteen , and sevenpence ha'penny , "
37231	37238	37183	37183	he	326	" That 's wot it is . "
37239	37248	37250	37251	Mr. Skimpole	326	" And it sounds - somehow it sounds , "
37253	37259	37250	37251	Mr. Skimpole	326	" like a small sum ? "
37288	37292	37294	37294	Richard	295	" Mr. Skimpole , "
37298	37326	37294	37294	Richard	295	" has a delicacy in applying to my cousin Jarndyce because he has lately - I think , sir , I understood you that you had lately - "
37327	37332	37334	37335	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Oh , yes ! "
37339	37381	37383	37383	he	326	" Though I forgot how much it was and when it was . Jarndyce would readily do it again , but I have the epicure - like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help , that I would rather , "
37390	37405	37383	37383	he	326	" develop generosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower . "
37406	37418	37420	37420	Richard	295	" What do you think will be best , Miss Summerson ? "
37444	37447	37449	37451	the strange man	1687	" Jail , "
37470	37474	37449	37451	the strange man	1687	" Or Coavinses . "
37475	37485	37449	37451	the strange man	1687	" May I ask , sir , what is - "
37486	37489	37491	37493	the strange man	1687	" Coavinses ? "
37495	37500	37491	37493	the strange man	1687	" A ' ouse . "
37570	37574	37575	37575	he	326	" I thought , "
37588	37666	37575	37575	he	326	" that being parties in a Chancery suit concerning as people say a large amount of property , Mr. Richard or his beautiful cousin , or both , could sign something , or make over something , or give some sort of undertaking , or pledge , or bond ? I do n't know what the business name of it may be , but I suppose there is some instrument within their power that would settle this ? "
37667	37674	37676	37678	the strange man	1687	" Not a bit on it , "
37680	37683	37676	37678	the strange man	1687	" Really ? "
37688	37705	37685	37686	Mr. Skimpole	326	" That seems odd , now , to one who is no judge of these things ! "
37706	37711	37713	37714	the stranger	1240	" Odd or even , "
37717	37728	37713	37714	the stranger	1240	" I tell you , not a bit on it ! "
37729	37742	37743	37744	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Keep your temper , my good fellow , keep your temper ! "
37767	37832	37750	37750	he	326	" Do n't be ruffled by your occupation . We can separate you from your office ; we can separate the individual from the pursuit . We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in private life you are otherwise than a very estimable man , with a great deal of poetry in your nature , of which you may not be conscious . "
37864	37878	37889	37889	he	326	" Now , my dear Miss Summerson , and my dear Mr. Richard , "
37901	37945	37889	37889	he	326	" here you see me utterly incapable of helping myself , and entirely in your hands ! I only ask to be free . The butterflies are free . Mankind will surely not deny to Harold Skimpole what it concedes to the butterflies ! "
37946	37952	37954	37954	Richard	295	" My dear Miss Summerson , "
37959	37979	37954	37954	Richard	295	" I have ten pounds that I received from Mr. Kenge . I must try what that will do . "
38232	38247	38221	38221	He	326	" Well , then , I 'll wish you a good evening , miss . "
38251	38274	38221	38221	He	326	" said Mr. Skimpole , standing with his back to the fire after giving up the sketch when it was half finished , "
38286	38293	38275	38275	I	0	" I think the reply was , "
38299	38300	38275	38275	I	0	" "
38318	38323	38302	38302	you	10042	" said Mr. Skimpole . "
38333	38337	38302	38302	you	10042	" said Coavinses . "
38353	38354	38302	38302	you	10042	" "
38359	38363	38364	38364	I	0	" said Coavinses . "
38390	38391	38440	38440	they	884	" "
38399	38404	38394	38394	you	10042	" proceeded Mr. Skimpole , "
38436	38437	38438	38438	Nobody	884	" "
38447	38451	38438	38438	Nobody	884	" returned Coavinses . "
38454	38459	38438	38438	Nobody	884	" observed Mr. Skimpole . "
38469	38470	38463	38463	you	10042	" "
38476	38486	38473	38473	you	10042	" growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong resentment . "
38508	38513	38473	38473	you	10042	" with profound contempt . "
38524	38529	38515	38515	you	10042	" proceeded Mr. Skimpole , "
38609	38610	38611	38611	I	0	" "
38619	38667	38611	38611	I	0	" said Coavinses , whose doggedness in utterly renouncing the idea was of that intense kind that he could only give adequate expression to it by putting a long interval between each word , and accompanying the last with a jerk that might have dislocated his neck . "
38685	38691	38693	38693	you	10042	" said Mr. Skimpole thoughtfully . "
38701	39009	39044	39044	they	1708	" As our absence had been long enough already to seem strange downstairs , I returned at once and found Ada sitting at work by the fireside talking to her cousin John . Mr. Skimpole presently appeared , and Richard shortly after him . I was sufficiently engaged during the remainder of the evening in taking my first lesson in backgammon from Mr. Jarndyce , who was very fond of the game and from whom I wished of course to learn it as quickly as I could in order that I might be of the very small use of being able to play when he had no better adversary . But I thought , occasionally , when Mr. Skimpole played some fragments of his own compositions or when , both at the piano and the violoncello , and at our table , he preserved with an absence of all effort his delightful spirits and his easy flow of conversation , that Richard and I seemed to retain the transferred impression of having been arrested since dinner and that it was very curious altogether . It was late before we separated , for when Ada was going at eleven o'clock , Mr. Skimpole went to the piano and rattled hilariously that the best of all ways to lengthen our days was to steal a few hours from night , my dear ! It was past twelve before he took his candle and his radiant face out of the room , and I think he might have kept us there , if he had seen fit , until daybreak . Ada and Richard were lingering for a few moments by the fire , wondering whether Mrs. Jellyby had yet finished her dictation for the day , when Mr. Jarndyce , who had been out of the room , returned . "
39023	39040	39044	39044	they	1708	" he said , rubbing his head and walking about with his good - humoured vexation . "
39095	39106	39088	39088	I	0	" We neither of us quite knew what to answer . "
39161	39162	39149	39149	Lord	1712	" "
39167	39171	39165	39165	sir	9569	" said Richard , "
39192	39193	39186	39187	Mr. Skimpole	326	" "
39207	39222	39225	39225	sir	9569	" said Mr. Jarndyce , giving his head a great rub and stopping short . "
39227	39228	39229	39229	Everybody	883	" "
39243	39266	39267	39267	He	326	" said Mr. Jarndyce , walking again at a great pace , with a candle in his hand that had gone out . "
39319	39326	39310	39311	Mrs. Skimpole	329	" Richard laughed heartily but added , "
39397	39398	39386	39386	I	0	" "
39401	39422	39386	39386	I	0	" cried Mr. Jarndyce , stopping again , and making several absent endeavours to put his candlestick in his pocket . "
39507	39566	39567	39567	Eh	1724	" He was now alternately putting his hands into his pockets as if he were going to keep them there a long time , and taking them out again and vehemently rubbing them all over his head . I ventured to take this opportunity of hinting that Mr. Skimpole , being in all such matters quite a child - "
39572	39582	39567	39567	Eh	1724	" said Mr. Jarndyce , catching at the word . "
39590	39594	39585	39586	a child	931	" said I , "
39602	39603	39567	39567	Eh	1724	" "
39608	39615	39604	39604	You	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce , brightening . "
39650	39658	39633	39633	I	0	" Certainly ! Certainly ! we said . "
39671	39688	39669	39669	he	1730	" asked Mr. Jarndyce , brightening more and more . He was indeed , we said . "
39710	39715	39704	39704	you	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce , "
39754	39836	39840	39841	a cod	1736	" It was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face clearing , and to see him so heartily pleased , and to know , as it was impossible not to know , that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which was tortured by condemning , or mistrusting , or secretly accusing any one , that I saw the tears in Ada 's eyes , while she echoed his laugh , and felt them in my own . "
39849	39854	39840	39841	a cod	1736	" said Mr. Jarndyce , "
39919	39941	39892	39893	a child	931	" said Mr. Jarndyce with his whole face in a glow . We all confirmed it from our night 's experience . "
39950	39955	39958	39958	Rick	319	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "
40010	40040	39963	39963	you	0	" We all promised faithfully , Richard with a merry glance at me touching his pocket as if to remind me that there was no danger of OUR transgressing . "
40045	40050	39963	39963	you	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce , "
40120	40141	40118	40118	you	1327	" He peeped in again , with a smiling face , before we had lighted our candles , and said , "
40171	40513	40514	40514	Esther	283	" And went away singing to himself . Ada and I agreed , as we talked together for a little while upstairs , that this caprice about the wind was a fiction and that he used the pretence to account for any disappointment he could not conceal , rather than he would blame the real cause of it or disparage or depreciate any one . We thought this very characteristic of his eccentric gentleness and of the difference between him and those petulant people who make the weather and the winds particularly that unlucky wind which he had chosen for such a different purpose the stalking - horses of their splenetic and gloomy humours . Indeed , so much affection for him had been added in this one evening to my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him through that mingled feeling . Any seeming inconsistencies in Mr. Skimpole or in Mrs. Jellyby I could not expect to be able to reconcile , having so little experience or practical knowledge . Neither did I try , for my thoughts were busy when I was alone , with Ada and Richard and with the confidence I had seemed to receive concerning them . My fancy , made a little wild by the wind perhaps , would not consent to be all unselfish , either , though I would have persuaded it to be so if I could . It wandered back to my godmother 's house and came along the intervening track , raising up shadowy speculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to what knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my earliest history - even as to the possibility of his being my father , though that idle dream was quite gone now . It was all gone now , I remembered , getting up from the fire . It was not for me to muse over bygones , but to act with a cheerful spirit and a grateful heart . So I said to myself , "
40525	40895	40522	40523	my dear	9610	" and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a shake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to bed . CHAPTER VII The Ghost 's Walk While Esther sleeps , and while Esther wakes , it is still wet weather down at the place in Lincolnshire . The rain is ever falling - drip , drip , drip - by day and night upon the broad flagged terrace- pavement , the Ghost 's Walk . The weather is so very bad down in Lincolnshire that the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever being fine again . Not that there is any superabundant life of imagination on the spot , for Sir Leicester is not here and , truly , even if he were , would not do much for it in that particular , but is in Paris with my Lady ; and solitude , with dusky wings , sits brooding upon Chesney Wold . There may be some motions of fancy among the lower animals at Chesney Wold . The horses in the stables - the long stables in a barren , red - brick court - yard , where there is a great bell in a turret , and a clock with a large face , which the pigeons who live near it and who love to perch upon its shoulders seem to be always consulting - THEY may contemplate some mental pictures of fine weather on occasions , and may be better artists at them than the grooms . The old roan , so famous for cross - country work , turning his large eyeball to the grated window near his rack , may remember the fresh leaves that glisten there at other times and the scents that stream in , and may have a fine run with the hounds , while the human helper , clearing out the next stall , never stirs beyond his pitchfork and birch - broom . The grey , whose place is opposite the door and who with an impatient rattle of his halter pricks his ears and turns his head so wistfully when it is opened , and to whom the opener says , "
40910	41145	40903	40903	Noabody	332	" may know it quite as well as the man . The whole seemingly monotonous and uncompanionable half - dozen , stabled together , may pass the long wet hours when the door is shut in livelier communication than is held in the servants ' hall or at the Dedlock Arms , or may even beguile the time by improving perhaps corrupting the pony in the loose - box in the corner . So the mastiff , dozing in his kennel in the court - yard with his large head on his paws , may think of the hot sunshine when the shadows of the stable - buildings tire his patience out by changing and leave him at one time of the day no broader refuge than the shadow of his own house , where he sits on end , panting and growling short , and very much wanting something to worry besides himself and his chain . So now , half - waking and all - winking , he may recall the house full of company , the coach - houses full of vehicles , the stables full of horses , and the out - buildings full of attendants upon horses , until he is undecided about the present and comes forth to see how it is . Then , with that impatient shake of himself , he may growl in the spirit , "
41161	41588	41591	41591	she	1752	" as he goes in again and lies down with a gloomy yawn . So with the dogs in the kennel - buildings across the park , who have their restless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been very obstinate have even made it known in the house itself - upstairs , downstairs , and in my Lady 's chamber . They may hunt the whole country - side , while the raindrops are pattering round their inactivity . So the rabbits with their self - betraying tails , frisking in and out of holes at roots of trees , may be lively with ideas of the breezy days when their ears are blown about or of those seasons of interest when there are sweet young plants to gnaw . The turkey in the poultry - yard , always troubled with a class - grievance probably Christmas , may be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully taken from him when he got into the lane among the felled trees , where there was a barn and barley . The discontented goose , who stoops to pass under the old gateway , twenty feet high , may gabble out , if we only knew it , a waddling preference for weather when the gateway casts its shadow on the ground . Be this as it may , there is not much fancy otherwise stirring at Chesney Wold . If there be a little at any odd moment , it goes , like a little noise in that old echoing place , a long way and usually leads off to ghosts and mystery . It has rained so hard and rained so long down in Lincolnshire that Mrs. Rouncewell , the old housekeeper at Chesney Wold , has several times taken off her spectacles and cleaned them to make certain that the drops were not upon the glasses . Mrs. Rouncewell might have been sufficiently assured by hearing the rain , but that she is rather deaf , which nothing will induce her to believe . She is a fine old lady , handsome , stately , wonderfully neat , and has such a back and such a stomacher that if her stays should turn out when she dies to have been a broad old - fashioned family fire - grate , nobody who knows her would have cause to be surprised . Weather affects Mrs. Rouncewell little . The house is there in all weathers , and the house , as she expresses it , "
41595	41732	41591	41591	she	1752	" She sits in her room in a side passage on the ground floor , with an arched window commanding a smooth quadrangle , adorned at regular intervals with smooth round trees and smooth round blocks of stone , as if the trees were going to play at bowls with the stones , and the whole house reposes on her mind . She can open it on occasion and be busy and fluttered , but it is shut up now and lies on the breadth of Mrs. Rouncewell 's iron - bound bosom in a majestic sleep . It is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine Chesney Wold without Mrs. Rouncewell , but she has only been here fifty years . Ask her how long , this rainy day , and she shall answer "
41755	42011	41591	41591	she	1752	" Mr. Rouncewell died some time before the decease of the pretty fashion of pig - tails , and modestly hid his own if he took it with him in a corner of the churchyard in the park near the mouldy porch . He was born in the market - town , and so was his young widow . Her progress in the family began in the time of the last Sir Leicester and originated in the still - room . The present representative of the Dedlocks is an excellent master . He supposes all his dependents to be utterly bereft of individual characters , intentions , or opinions , and is persuaded that he was born to supersede the necessity of their having any . If he were to make a discovery to the contrary , he would be simply stunned - would never recover himself , most likely , except to gasp and die . But he is an excellent master still , holding it a part of his state to be so . He has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell ; he says she is a most respectable , creditable woman . He always shakes hands with her when he comes down to Chesney Wold and when he goes away ; and if he were very ill , or if he were knocked down by accident , or run over , or placed in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage , he would say if he could speak , "
42021	42324	42017	42018	Mrs. Rouncewell	333	" feeling his dignity , at such a pass , safer with her than with anybody else . Mrs. Rouncewell has known trouble . She has had two sons , of whom the younger ran wild , and went for a soldier , and never came back . Even to this hour , Mrs. Rouncewell 's calm hands lose their composure when she speaks of him , and unfolding themselves from her stomacher , hover about her in an agitated manner as she says what a likely lad , what a fine lad , what a gay , good - humoured , clever lad he was ! Her second son would have been provided for at Chesney Wold and would have been made steward in due season , but he took , when he was a schoolboy , to constructing steam - engines out of saucepans and setting birds to draw their own water with the least possible amount of labour , so assisting them with artful contrivance of hydraulic pressure that a thirsty canary had only , in a literal sense , to put his shoulder to the wheel and the job was done . This propensity gave Mrs. Rouncewell great uneasiness . She felt it with a mother 's anguish to be a move in the Wat Tyler direction , well knowing that Sir Leicester had that general impression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a tall chimney might be considered essential . But the doomed young rebel otherwise a mild youth , and very persevering , showing no sign of grace as he got older but , on the contrary , constructing a model of a power - loom , she was fain , with many tears , to mention his backslidings to the baronet .

42328	42333	42325	42326	Mrs. Rouncewell	333	" said Sir Leicester , "
42390	42562	42569	42569	I	0	" Farther north he went , and farther north he grew up ; and if Sir Leicester Dedlock ever saw him when he came to Chesney Wold to visit his mother , or ever thought of him afterwards , it is certain that he only regarded him as one of a body of some odd thousand conspirators , swarthy and grim , who were in the habit of turning out by torchlight two or three nights in the week for unlawful purposes . Nevertheless , Mrs. Rouncewell 's son has , in the course of nature and art , grown up , and established himself , and married , and called unto him Mrs. Rouncewell 's grandson , who , being out of his apprenticeship , and home from a journey in far countries , whither he was sent to enlarge his knowledge and complete his preparations for the venture of this life , stands leaning against the chimney- piece this very day in Mrs. Rouncewell 's room at Chesney Wold . "
42592	42597	42590	42590	Watt	335	" says Mrs. Rouncewell . "
42615	42629	42630	42630	They	1761	" Mrs. Rouncewell 's hands unquiet , as usual , on this reference . "

42663	42671	42672	42672	He	10114	" Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again . "

42692	42725	42688	42688	I	0	" Mrs. Rouncewell is fond of her son but has a plaintive feeling towards him , much as if he were a very honourable soldier who had gone over to the enemy . "
42731	42735	42726	42726	He	10114	" says she . "
42738	42739	42726	42726	He	10114	" "

42809	42819	42807	42807	Grandmother	337	" says the young man , changing the subject , "
42839	42840	42834	42834	You	337	" "
42905	42906	42896	42896	She	1770	" "
42916	42917	42918	42918	She	1770	" "
42950	42963	42943	42945	a young woman	9762	" says Mrs. Rouncewell , expanding her stomacher to its utmost limits , "
42969	42988	42989	42989	Wheels	339	" The young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of experience . Mrs. Rouncewell listens . "
42991	43008	42989	42989	Wheels	339	" says she . They have long been audible to the younger ears of her companion . "
43022	43034	42989	42989	Wheels	339	" After a short interval , a tap at the door . "
43038	43084	42989	42989	Wheels	339	" A dark- eyed , dark - haired , shy , village beauty comes in - so fresh in her rosy and yet delicate bloom that the drops of rain which have beaten on her hair look like the dew upon a flower fresh gathered . "
43092	43097	43090	43090	Rosa	338	" says Mrs. Rouncewell . "
43128	43141	43123	43123	I	0	" in quick reply to a gesture of dissent from the housekeeper . "
43186	43187	43163	43168	the young man who was driving	1783	" "
43195	43234	43193	43193	Watt	335	" says the housekeeper . Rosa is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them and almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up . Rosa is shyer than before . "
43237	43246	43247	43247	Guppy	301	" is all the information the card yields . "
43249	43254	43247	43247	Guppy	301	" repeats Mrs. Rouncewell , "
43267	43268	43273	43273	he	301	" "
43278	43282	43273	43273	he	301	" says Rosa . "
43391	43518	43379	43379	he	301	" Finding , now she leaves off , that she has been making quite a long speech , Rosa is shyer than ever . Now , Mr. Tulkinghorn is , in a manner , part and parcel of the place , and besides , is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell 's will . The old lady relaxes , consents to the admission of the visitors as a favour , and dismisses Rosa . The grandson , however , being smitten by a sudden wish to see the house himself , proposes to join the party . The grandmother , who is pleased that he should have that interest , accompanies him - though to do him justice , he is exceedingly unwilling to trouble her . "
43526	43541	43542	43542	Us	1792	" says Mr. Guppy , divesting himself of his wet dreadnought in the hall . "
43569	43902	43903	43903	Dear	1100	" The old housekeeper , with a gracious severity of deportment , waves her hand towards the great staircase . Mr. Guppy and his friend follow Rosa ; Mrs. Rouncewell and her grandson follow them ; a young gardener goes before to open the shutters . As is usually the case with people who go over houses , Mr. Guppy and his friend are dead beat before they have well begun . They straggle about in wrong places , look at wrong things , do n't care for the right things , gape when more rooms are opened , exhibit profound depression of spirits , and are clearly knocked up . In each successive chamber that they enter , Mrs. Rouncewell , who is as upright as the house itself , rests apart in a window - seat or other such nook and listens with stately approval to Rosa 's exposition . Her grandson is so attentive to it that Rosa is shyer than ever - and prettier . Thus they pass on from room to room , raising the pictured Dedlocks for a few brief minutes as the young gardener admits the light , and reconsigning them to their graves as he shuts it out again . It appears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his inconsolable friend that there is no end to the Dedlocks , whose family greatness seems to consist in their never having done anything to distinguish themselves for seven hundred years . Even the long drawing - room of Chesney Wold can not revive Mr. Guppy 's spirits . He is so low that he droops on the threshold and has hardly strength of mind to enter . But a portrait over the chimney - piece , painted by the fashionable artist of the day , acts upon him like a charm . He recovers in a moment . He stares at it with uncommon interest ; he seems to be fixed and fascinated by it . "
43906	43911	43903	43903	Dear	1100	" says Mr. Guppy . "
43916	43917	43937	43938	Lady Dedlock	266	" "
43926	43930	43937	43938	Lady Dedlock	266	" says Rosa , "
43955	43956	43957	43957	Blest	342	" "
43959	43974	43957	43957	Blest	342	" says Mr. Guppy , staring in a kind of dismay at his friend , "
43996	43997	43994	43994	miss	9656	" "
44012	44013	44005	44006	Sir Leicester	268	" "
44016	44025	44005	44006	Sir Leicester	268	" says Mr. Guppy in a low voice . "
44052	44053	44072	44072	his	268	" "
44080	44092	44075	44078	the late Sir Leicester	268	" Mr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these magnates . "
44099	44109	44075	44078	the late Sir Leicester	268	" he says , still staring at the portrait , "
44121	44129	44117	44117	I	0	" adds Mr. Guppy , looking round , "
44148	44338	44145	44145	you	1800	" As no one present takes any especial interest in Mr. Guppy 's dreams , the probability is not pursued . But he still remains so absorbed by the portrait that he stands immovable before it until the young gardener has closed the shutters , when he comes out of the room in a dazed state that is an odd though a sufficient substitute for interest and follows into the succeeding rooms with a confused stare , as if he were looking everywhere for Lady Dedlock again . He sees no more of her . He sees her rooms , which are the last shown , as being very elegant , and he looks out of the windows from which she looked out , not long ago , upon the weather that bored her to death . All things have an end , even houses that people take infinite pains to see and are tired of before they begin to see them . He has come to the end of the sight , and the fresh village beauty to the end of her description ; which is always this : "
44363	44364	44358	44359	the Ghost	1803	" "
44367	44375	44358	44359	the Ghost	1803	" says Mr. Guppy , greedily curious . "
44390	44391	44381	44381	miss	9656	" "
44398	44406	44381	44381	miss	9656	" says Watt in a half whisper . "
44415	44422	44413	44413	sir	9569	" Rosa is shyer than ever . "
44435	44442	44413	44413	sir	9569	" says the housekeeper , advancing . "
44453	44454	44455	44455	You	9656	" "
44473	44478	44455	44455	You	9656	" observes Mr. Guppy , "
44505	44610	44494	44494	I	0	" The story has nothing to do with a picture ; the housekeeper can guarantee that . Mr. Guppy is obliged to her for the information and is , moreover , generally obliged . He retires with his friend , guided down another staircase by the young gardener , and presently is heard to drive away . It is now dusk . Mrs. Rouncewell can trust to the discretion of her two young hearers and may tell THEM how the terrace came to have that ghostly name . She seats herself in a large chair by the fast - darkening window and tells them : "
44684	44734	44676	44676	I	0	" Mrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she considers that a family of such antiquity and importance has a right to a ghost . She regards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes , a genteel distinction to which the common people have no claim . "
44739	44744	44735	44737	Sir Morbury Dedlock	344	" says Mrs. Rouncewell , "
44865	44873	44863	44863	Watt	335	" Rosa draws nearer to the housekeeper . "
44884	44890	44874	44874	I	0	" replies the young man , "
44911	44919	44898	44898	I	0	" The housekeeper gravely nods and continues : "
45128	45143	45144	45144	She	1035	" The housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a whisper . "
45346	45369	45338	45339	the Dedlocks	267	" Watt looks at Rosa . Rosa in the deepening gloom looks down upon the ground , half frightened and half shy . "
45381	45386	45393	45394	the Ghost	1803	" says Mrs. Rouncewell , "

45473	45482	45459	45459	grandmother	1763	" returns the housekeeper . Her grandson apologizes with "

45505	45516	45459	45459	grandmother	1763	" says Mrs. Rouncewell , getting up from her chair ; "

45698	46565	45694	45695	my Lady	934	" CHAPTER VIII Covering a Multitude of Sins It was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of window , where my candles were reflected in the black panes like two beacons , and finding all beyond still enshrouded in the indistinctness of last night , to watch how it turned out when the day came on . As the prospect gradually revealed itself and disclosed the scene over which the wind had wandered in the dark , like my memory over my life , I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects that had been around me in my sleep . At first they were faintly discernible in the mist , and above them the later stars still glimmered . That pale interval over , the picture began to enlarge and fill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough to look at for an hour . Imperceptibly my candles became the only incongruous part of the morning , the dark places in my room all melted away , and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape , prominent in which the old Abbey Church , with its massive tower , threw a softer train of shadow on the view than seemed compatible with its rugged character . But so from rough outsides I hope I have learnt , serene and gentle influences often proceed . Every part of the house was in such order , and every one was so attentive to me , that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys , though what with trying to remember the contents of each little store - room drawer and cupboard ; and what with making notes on a slate about jams , and pickles , and preserves , and bottles , and glass , and china , and a great many other things ; and what with being generally a methodical , old - maidish sort of foolish little person , I was so busy that I could not believe it was breakfast- time when I heard the bell ring . Away I ran , however , and made tea , as I had already been installed into the responsibility of the tea - pot ; and then , as they were all rather late and nobody was down yet , I thought I would take a peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too . I found it quite a delightful place - in front , the pretty avenue and drive by which we had approached and where , by the by , we had cut up the gravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll it ; at the back , the flower - garden , with my darling at her window up there , throwing it open to smile out at me , as if she would have kissed me from that distance . Beyond the flower - garden was a kitchen - garden , and then a paddock , and then a snug little rick - yard , and then a dear little farm - yard . As to the house itself , with its three peaks in the roof ; its various - shaped windows , some so large , some so small , and all so pretty ; its trellis - work , against the southfront for roses and honey - suckle , and its homely , comfortable , welcoming look - it was , as Ada said when she came out to meet me with her arm through that of its master , worthy of her cousin John , a bold thing to say , though he only pinched her dear cheek for it . Mr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as he had been overnight . There was honey on the table , and it led him into a discourse about bees . He had no objection to honey , he said and I should think he had not , for he seemed to like it , but he protested against the overweening assumptions of bees . He did n't at all see why the busy bee should be proposed as a model to him ; he supposed the bee liked to make honey , or he would n't do it - nobody asked him . It was not necessary for the bee to make such a merit of his tastes . If every confectioner went buzzing about the world banging against everything that came in his way and egotistically calling upon everybody to take notice that he was going to his work and must not be interrupted , the world would be quite an unsupportable place . Then , after all , it was a ridiculous position to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone as soon as you had made it . You would have a very mean opinion of a Manchester man if he spun cotton for no other purpose . He must say he thought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea . The drone said unaffectedly , "
46630	46827	46620	46628	somebody who does n't want to look about him	1854	" This appeared to Mr. Skimpole to be the drone philosophy , and he thought it a very good philosophy , always supposing the drone to be willing to be on good terms with the bee , which , so far as he knew , the easy fellow always was , if the consequential creature would only let him , and not be so conceited about his honey ! He pursued this fancy with the lightest foot over a variety of ground and made us all merry , though again he seemed to have as serious a meaning in what he said as he was capable of having . I left them still listening to him when I withdrew to attend to my new duties . They had occupied me for some time , and I was passing through the passages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm when Mr. Jarndyce called me into a small room next his bed - chamber , which I found to be in part a little library of books and papers and in part quite a little museum of his boots and shoes and hat- boxes . "
46834	46839	46620	46628	somebody who does n't want to look about him	1854	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "

46886	46890	46880	46880	you	9610	" he returned . "
46942	47054	46938	46938	you	9610	" I could not help it ; I tried very hard , but being alone with that benevolent presence , and meeting his kind eyes , and feeling so happy and so honoured there , and my heart so full - I kissed his hand . I do n't know what I said , or even that I spoke . He was disconcerted and walked to the window ; I almost believed with an intention of jumping out , until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in his eyes what he had gone there to hide . He gently patted me on the head , and I sat down . "
47059	47063	46938	46938	you	9610	" he said . "
47075	47076	47136	47137	that protector	1865	" "
47085	47089	47083	47083	sir	9569	" I returned , "

47220	47288	47292	47292	Esther	283	" And it had such a good effect that I folded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself . Mr. Jarndyce , expressing his approval in his face , began to talk to me as confidentially as if I had been in the habit of conversing with him every morning for I do n't know how long . I almost felt as if I had . "
47294	47298	47292	47292	Esther	283	" he said , "
47307	47316	47299	47299	you	283	" And of course I shook my head . "
47324	47328	47317	47317	I	0	" he returned . "

47469	47486	47467	47467	sir	9569	" said I , to bring him back , for he began to rub his head , "
47491	47492	47467	47467	sir	9569	" "
47508	47512	47513	47515	A certain Jarndyce	288	" he returned . "
47897	47898	47899	47901	The Mr. Jarndyce	288	" "
47911	47916	47917	47917	I	0	" He nodded gravely . "

48086	48125	48126	48126	I	0	" He walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a shudder , and then looked at me , and brightened , and came and sat down again with his hands in his pockets . "
48141	48157	48139	48139	I	0	" I reminded him , at the hopeful change he had made in Bleak House . "

48390	48397	48366	48367	the children	9760	" he answered much more cheerfully ; "
48415	48422	48403	48403	you	9610	" The idea of my wisdom ! "
48454	48460	48461	48461	you	9610	" looking seriously at me , "

48480	48483	48475	48475	I	0	" said I. "
48496	48511	48512	48512	Esther	283	" I felt that I was choking again - I taxed myself with it , "
48521	48580	48512	48512	Esther	283	" - when he feigned to say this slightly , as if it were a whim instead of a thoughtful tenderness . But I gave the housekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a reminder to myself , and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on the basket , looked at him quietly . "
48586	48590	48584	48584	guardian	1915	" said I , "
48652	48694	48695	48695	I	0	" He did not seem at all disappointed ; quite the contrary . He told me , with a smile all over his face , that he knew me very well indeed and that I was quite clever enough for him . "

48738	48743	48744	48750	the little old woman of the child	1922	" he returned playfully ; "
48760	48783	48784	48784	You	0	" ' Little old woman , and whither so high ? ' ' To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky . ' "
48821	48871	48784	48784	You	0	" This was the beginning of my being called Old Woman , and Little Old Woman , and Cobweb , and Mrs. Shipton , and Mother Hubbard , and Dame Durden , and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became quite lost among them . "
48874	48879	48928	48928	Esther	283	" said Mr. Jarndyce , "
48906	48923	48928	48928	Esther	283	" Oh , my goodness , the idea of asking my advice on such a point ! "
48930	48948	48925	48925	he	319	" said Mr. Jarndyce , comfortably putting his hands into his pockets and stretching out his legs . "

49174	49253	49165	49165	I	0	" He began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind . But it was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me that whether he rubbed his head , or walked about , or did both , his face was sure to recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine ; and he was sure to turn comfortable again and put his hands in his pockets and stretch out his legs . "
49264	49268	49165	49165	I	0	" said I , "

49347	49442	49344	49345	little woman	1937	" I really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was attaining and the number of things that were being confided to me . I had not meant this at all ; I had meant that he should speak to Richard . But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do my best , though I feared I realty felt it necessary to repeat this that he thought me much more sagacious than I was . At which my guardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard . "
49445	49456	49344	49345	little woman	1937	" he said , rising and pushing back his chair . "
49488	49508	49481	49481	you	283	" He looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him and felt sure I understood him . "
49514	49517	49481	49481	you	283	" said I. "
49520	49521	49481	49481	you	283	" "
49524	49547	49522	49522	Guardian	353	" said I , venturing to put my hand , which was suddenly colder than I could have wished , in his , "
49615	50364	50367	50368	young ladies	1942	" He drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for Ada . From that hour I felt quite easy with him , quite unreserved , quite content to know no more , quite happy . We lived , at first , rather a busy life at Bleak House , for we had to become acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood who knew Mr. Jarndyce . It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew him who wanted to do anything with anybody else 's money . It amazed us when we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him in the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the lives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form themselves into committees for getting in and laying out money . The ladies were as desperate as the gentlemen ; indeed , I think they were even more so . They threw themselves into committees in the most impassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite extraordinary . It appeared to us that some of them must pass their whole lives in dealing out subscription - cards to the whole post - office directory - shilling cards , half - crown cards , half - sovereign cards , penny cards . They wanted everything . They wanted wearing apparel , they wanted linen rags , they wanted money , they wanted coals , they wanted soup , they wanted interest , they wanted autographs , they wanted flannel , they wanted whatever Mr. Jarndyce had - or had not . Their objects were as various as their demands . They were going to raise new buildings , they were going to pay off debts on old buildings , they were going to establish in a picturesque building engraving of proposed west elevation attached the Sisterhood of Mediaeval Marys , they were going to give a testimonial to Mrs. Jellyby , they were going to have their secretary 's portrait painted and presented to his mother - in - law , whose deep devotion to him was well known , they were going to get up everything , I really believe , from five hundred thousand tracts to an annuity and from a marble monument to a silver tea - pot . They took a multitude of titles . They were the Women of England , the Daughters of Britain , the Sisters of all the cardinal virtues separately , the Females of America , the Ladies of a hundred denominations . They appeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing . They seemed to our poor wits , and according to their own accounts , to be constantly polling people by tens of thousands , yet never bringing their candidates in for anything . It made our heads ache to think , on the whole , what feverish lives they must lead . Among the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious benevolence if I may use the expression was a Mrs. Pardiggle , who seemed , as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce , to be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself . We observed that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the subject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr. Jarndyce and prevented his going any farther , when he had remarked that there were two classes of charitable people ; one , the people who did a little and made a great deal of noise ; the other , the people who did a great deal and made no noise at all . We were therefore curious to see Mrs. Pardiggle , suspecting her to be a type of the former class , and were glad when she called one day with her five young sons . She was a formidable style of lady with spectacles , a prominent nose , and a loud voice , who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room . And she really did , for she knocked down little chairs with her skirts that were quite a great way off . As only Ada and I were at home , we received her timidly , for she seemed to come in like cold weather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed . "
50370	50382	50367	50368	young ladies	1942	" said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility after the first salutations , "
50524	50646	50647	50647	You	1953	" We had never seen such dissatisfied children . It was not merely that they were weazened and shrivelled - though they were certainly that too - but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent . At the mention of the Tockahoopo Indians , I could really have supposed Egbert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe , he gave me such a savage frown . The face of each child , as the amount of his contribution was mentioned , darkened in a peculiarly vindictive manner , but his was by far the worst . I must except , however , the little recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy , who was stolidly and evenly miserable . "
50655	50660	50647	50647	You	1953	" said Mrs. Pardiggle , "
50666	50678	50662	50663	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" We said yes , we had passed one night there . "
50682	50740	50679	50680	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" pursued the lady , always speaking in the same demonstrative , loud , hard tone , so that her voice impressed my fancy as if it had a sort of spectacles on too - and I may take the opportunity of remarking that her spectacles were made the less engaging by her eyes being what Ada called "
50744	50749	50679	50680	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" meaning very prominent - "
50892	50931	50932	50932	They	1958	" I was afterwards convinced and so was Ada that from the ill- conditioned eldest child , these words extorted a sharp yell . He turned it off into a yawn , but it began as a yell . "
50962	50968	50970	50970	they	1958	" said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly , "
51192	51213	51214	51214	You	1972	" Alfred glowered at us as if he never could , or would , forgive the injury of that night . "
51222	51227	51214	51214	You	1972	" said Mrs. Pardiggle , "
51351	51409	51410	51410	You	363	" Suppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby , and suppose Mr. Jellyby were to relieve his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle , would Mr. Pardiggle , in return , make any confidential communication to Mr. Jellyby ? I was quite confused to find myself thinking this , but it came into my head . "
51417	51457	51410	51410	You	363	" said Mrs. Pardiggle . We were glad to change the subject , and going to the window , pointed out the beauties of the prospect , on which the spectacles appeared to me to rest with curious indifference . "
51463	51485	51460	51461	Mr. Gusher	364	" said our visitor . We were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher 's acquaintance . "
51495	51504	51491	51491	I	0	" said Mrs. Pardiggle with her commanding deportment . "
51566	51601	51605	51605	you	363	" said Mrs. Pardiggle , moving back to her chair and overturning , as if by invisible agency , a little round table at a considerable distance with my work - basket on it , "
51615	51660	51605	51605	you	363	" This was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in perfect dismay . As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after what I had been thinking , it must have been expressed in the colour of my cheeks . "
51667	51672	51664	51664	I	0	" said Mrs. Pardiggle , "
51751	51788	51789	51789	I	0	" We murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying , or something to that effect . I do n't think we knew what it was either , but this is what our politeness expressed . "
51809	51814	51800	51800	you	1985	" said Mrs. Pardiggle . "
51876	51930	51863	51863	I	0	" If that dark - visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had already looked , this was the time when he did it . I observed that he doubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of his cap , which was under his left arm . "
51944	51949	51863	51863	I	0	" said Mrs. Pardiggle . "
52025	52224	52225	52225	You	1990	" At first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general ground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect . But as this was an ineffectual protest , I then said , more particularly , that I was not sure of my qualifications . That I was inexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very differently situated , and addressing them from suitable points of view . That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must be essential to such a work . That I had much to learn , myself , before I could teach others , and that I could not confide in my good intentions alone . For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful as I could , and to render what kind services I could to those immediately about me , and to try to let that circle of duty gradually and naturally expand itself . All this I said with anything but confidence , because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I , and had great experience , and was so very military in her manners . "
52232	52236	52225	52225	You	1990	" said she , "
52315	52546	52308	52308	she	294	" Ada and I interchanged looks , and as we were going out in any case , accepted the offer . When we hastily returned from putting on our bonnets , we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs. Pardiggle sweeping about the room , knocking down nearly all the light objects it contained . Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada , and I followed with the family . Ada told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud tone that , indeed , I overheard all the way to the brickmaker 's about an exciting contest which she had for two or three years waged against another lady relative to the bringing in of their rival candidates for a pension somewhere . There had been a quantity of printing , and promising , and proxying , and polling , and it appeared to have imparted great liveliness to all concerned , except the pensioners - who were not elected yet . I am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being usually favoured in that respect , but on this occasion it gave me great uneasiness . As soon as we were out of doors , Egbert , with the manner of a little footpad , demanded a shilling of me on the ground that his pocket - money was "
52548	52573	52575	52575	her	1995	" from him . On my pointing out the great impropriety of the word , especially in connexion with his parent for he added sulkily "
52577	52585	52575	52575	her	1995	" , he pinched me and said , "
52641	53111	52628	52628	you	1996	" These exasperating questions so inflamed his mind and the minds of Oswald and Francis that they all pinched me at once , and in a dreadfully expert way - screwing up such little pieces of my arms that I could hardly forbear crying out . Felix , at the same time , stamped upon my toes . And the Bond of Joy , who on account of always having the whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to abstain from cakes as well as tobacco , so swelled with grief and rage when we passed a pastry - cook 's shop that he terrified me by becoming purple . I never underwent so much , both in body and mind , in the course of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally constrained children when they paid me the compliment of being natural . I was glad when we came to the brickmaker 's house , though it was one of a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick - field , with pigsties close to the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the doors growing nothing but stagnant pools . Here and there an old tub was put to catch the droppings of rain - water from a roof , or they were banked up with mud into a little pond like a large dirt- pie . At the doors and windows some men and women lounged or prowled about , and took little notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say something as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business and not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to look after other people 's . Mrs. Pardiggle , leading the way with a great show of moral determination and talking with much volubility about the untidy habits of the people though I doubted if the best of us could have been tidy in such a place , conducted us into a cottage at the farthest corner , the ground - floor room of which we nearly filled . Besides ourselves , there were in this damp , offensive room a woman with a black eye , nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire ; a man , all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated , lying at full length on the ground , smoking a pipe ; a powerful young man fastening a collar on a dog ; and a bold girl doing some kind of washing in very dirty water . They all looked up at us as we came in , and the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire as if to hide her bruised eye ; nobody gave us any welcome . "
53117	53144	52628	52628	you	1996	" said Mrs. Pardiggle , but her voice had not a friendly sound , I thought ; it was much too business - like and systematic . "
53186	53187	53172	53172	I	0	" "
53191	53211	53172	53172	I	0	" growled the man on the floor , whose head rested on his hand as he stared at us , "
53223	53224	53172	53172	I	0	" "
53230	53245	53172	53172	I	0	" said Mrs. Pardiggle , seating herself on one stool and knocking down another . "
53251	53252	53172	53172	I	0	" "
53264	53321	53322	53322	You	9940	" said the man , with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us . The young man and the girl both laughed . Two friends of the young man , whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with their hands in their pockets , echoed the laugh noisily . "
53331	53339	53322	53322	You	9940	" said Mrs. Pardiggle to these latter . "
53358	53359	53354	53354	I	0	" "
53367	53375	53354	53354	I	0	" growled the man upon the floor . "
53733	54079	53728	53728	she	2015	" He had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this , and he now turned over on his other side and smoked again . Mrs. Pardiggle , who had been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible composure , calculated , I could not help thinking , to increase his antagonism , pulled out a good book as if it were a constable 's staff and took the whole family into custody . I mean into religious custody , of course ; but she really did it as if she were an inexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station- house . Ada and I were very uncomfortable . We both felt intrusive and out of place , and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on infinitely better if she had not had such a mechanical way of taking possession of people . The children sulked and stared ; the family took no notice of us whatever , except when the young man made the dog bark , which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic . We both felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there was an iron barrier which could not be removed by our new friend . By whom or how it could be removed , we did not know , but we knew that . Even what she read and said seemed to us to be ill - chosen for such auditors , if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so much tact . As to the little book to which the man on the floor had referred , we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards , and Mr. Jarndyce said he doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it , though he had had no other on his desolate island . We were much relieved , under these circumstances , when Mrs. Pardiggle left off . The man on the floor , then turning his head round again , said morosely , "
54089	54090	54087	54087	you	2016	" "
54119	54127	54108	54108	I	0	" returned Mrs. Pardiggle with demonstrative cheerfulness . "
54135	54150	54151	54151	you	10042	" said he , folding his arms and shutting his eyes with an oath , "
54158	54393	54396	54396	Esther	283	" Mrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the confined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped . Taking one of her young family in each hand , and telling the others to follow closely , and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and all his house would be improved when she saw them next , she then proceeded to another cottage . I hope it is not unkind in me to say that she certainly did make , in this as in everything else , a show that was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of dealing in it to a large extent . She supposed that we were following her , but as soon as the space was left clear , we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the baby were ill . She only looked at it as it lay on her lap . We had observed before that when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her hand , as though she wished to separate any association with noise and violence and ill treatment from the poor little child . Ada , whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance , bent down to touch its little face . As she did so , I saw what happened and drew her back . The child died . "
54398	54409	54396	54396	Esther	283	" cried Ada , sinking on her knees beside it . "
54465	54679	54680	54680	Jenny	366	" Such compassion , such gentleness , as that with which she bent down weeping and put her hand upon the mother 's might have softened any mother 's heart that ever beat . The woman at first gazed at her in astonishment and then burst into tears . Presently I took the light burden from her lap , did what I could to make the baby 's rest the prettier and gentler , laid it on a shelf , and covered it with my own handkerchief . We tried to comfort the mother , and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children . She answered nothing , but sat weeping - weeping very much . When I turned , I found that the young man had taken out the dog and was standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes , but quiet . The girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground . The man had risen . He still smoked his pipe with an air of defiance , but he was silent . An ugly woman , very poorly clothed , hurried in while I was glancing at them , and coming straight up to the mother , said , "
54684	54757	54758	54758	Jenny	366	" The mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman 's neck . She also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage . She had no kind of grace about her , but the grace of sympathy ; but when she condoled with the woman , and her own tears fell , she wanted no beauty . I say condoled , but her only words were "
54762	55178	54760	54760	Jenny	366	" All the rest was in the tone in which she said them . I thought it very touching to see these two women , coarse and shabby and beaten , so united ; to see what they could be to one another ; to see how they felt for one another , how the heart of each to each was softened by the hard trials of their lives . I think the best side of such people is almost hidden from us . What the poor are to the poor is little known , excepting to themselves and God . We felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted . We stole out quietly and without notice from any one except the man . He was leaning against the wall near the door , and finding that there was scarcely room for us to pass , went out before us . He seemed to want to hide that he did this on our account , but we perceived that he did , and thanked him . He made no answer . Ada was so full of grief all the way home , and Richard , whom we found at home , was so distressed to see her in tears though he said to me , when she was not present , how beautiful it was too ! , that we arranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat our visit at the brick - maker 's house . We said as little as we could to Mr. Jarndyce , but the wind changed directly . Richard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning expedition . On our way there , we had to pass a noisy drinking- house , where a number of men were flocking about the door . Among them , and prominent in some dispute , was the father of the little child . At a short distance , we passed the young man and the dog , in congenial company . The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other young women at the corner of the row of cottages , but she seemed ashamed and turned away as we went by . We left our escort within sight of the brickmaker 's dwelling and proceeded by ourselves . When we came to the door , we found the woman who had brought such consolation with her standing there looking anxiously out . "
55189	55196	55181	55181	you	2023	" she said in a whisper . "
55229	55230	55222	55222	he	2025	" "
55237	55240	55222	55222	he	2025	" said I. "
55290	55404	55277	55277	I	0	" As she gave way for us , she went softly in and put what we had brought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept . No effort had been made to clean the room - it seemed in its nature almost hopeless of being clean ; but the small waxen form from which so much solemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh , and washed , and neatly dressed in some fragments of white linen ; and on my handkerchief , which still covered the poor baby , a little bunch of sweet herbs had been laid by the same rough , scarred hands , so lightly , so tenderly ! "
55410	55416	55277	55277	I	0	" we said to her . "
55423	55424	55425	55425	Me	0	" "
55430	55436	55425	55425	Me	0	" she returned with surprise . "
55443	55599	55600	55600	Jenny	366	" The mother had moaned in her sleep and moved . The sound of the familiar voice seemed to calm her again . She was quiet once more . How little I thought , when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the tiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around the child through Ada 's drooping hair as her pity bent her head - how little I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come to lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast ! I only thought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all unconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a hand ; not all unconscious of her presently , when we had taken leave , and left her at the door , by turns looking , and listening in terror for herself , and saying in her old soothing manner , "
55604	55671	55602	55602	Jenny	366	" CHAPTER IX Signs and Tokens I do n't know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself . I mean all the time to write about other people , and I try to think about myself as little as possible , and I am sure , when I find myself coming into the story again , I am really vexed and say , "
55687	55992	55683	55683	you	1100	" but it is all of no use . I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that if these pages contain a great deal about me , I can only suppose it must be because I have really something to do with them and ca n't be kept out . My darling and I read together , and worked , and practised , and found so much employment for our time that the winter days flew by us like bright - winged birds . Generally in the afternoons , and always in the evenings , Richard gave us his company . Although he was one of the most restless creatures in the world , he certainly was very fond of our society . He was very , very , very fond of Ada . I mean it , and I had better say it at once . I had never seen any young people falling in love before , but I found them out quite soon . I could not say so , of course , or show that I knew anything about it . On the contrary , I was so demure and used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within myself while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite deceitful . But there was no help for it . All I had to do was to be quiet , and I was as quiet as a mouse . They were as quiet as mice too , so far as any words were concerned , but the innocent manner in which they relied more and more upon me as they took more and more to one another was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing how it interested me . "
56005	56033	56000	56003	a capital old woman	2038	" Richard would say , coming up to meet me in the garden early , with his pleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush , "
56101	56102	56103	56103	You	2043	" "
56111	56133	56106	56107	Dame Durden	351	" Ada would say at night , with her head upon my shoulder and the firelight shining in her thoughtful eyes , "
56174	56321	56168	56170	the poor sailors	2047	" Ah ! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor . We had talked it over very often now , and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination of his childhood for the sea . Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation of the family , a great Sir Leicester Dedlock , for his interest in Richard 's favour , generally ; and Sir Leicester had replied in a gracious manner that he would be happy to advance the prospects of the young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his power , which was not at all probable , and that my Lady sent her compliments to the young gentleman to whom she perfectly remembered that she was allied by remote consanguinity and trusted that he would ever do his duty in any honourable profession to which he might devote himself . "
56330	56336	56323	56323	I	0	" said Richard to me , "
56414	56578	56581	56582	Mother Hubbard	350	" With a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever flagged , Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite perplexed me , principally because he mistook it , in such a very odd way , for prudence . It entered into all his calculations about money in a singular manner which I do n't think I can better explain than by reverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole . Mr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount , either from Mr. Skimpole himself or from Coavinses , and had placed the money in my hands with instructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to Richard . The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which Richard justified by the recovery of his ten pounds , and the number of times he talked to me as if he had saved or realized that amount , would form a sum in simple addition . "
56587	56609	56581	56582	Mother Hubbard	350	" he said to me when he wanted , without the least consideration , to bestow five pounds on the brickmaker . "
56623	56624	56610	56610	I	0	" "
56629	56632	56610	56610	I	0	" said I. "

56691	56695	56676	56676	I	0	" I hinted . "
56704	56708	56709	56709	I	0	" returned Richard . "
56733	56774	56776	56776	me	0	" In exactly the same way , when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice of these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good , he carried that sum to his credit and drew upon it . "
56779	56784	56776	56776	me	0	" he would say . "
56850	57063	57065	57065	Boythorn	367	" I believe Richard 's was as frank and generous a nature as there possibly can be . He was ardent and brave , and in the midst of all his wild restlessness , was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a few weeks . His gentleness was natural to him and would have shown itself abundantly even without Ada 's influence ; but with it , he became one of the most winning of companions , always so ready to be interested and always so happy , sanguine , and light - hearted . I am sure that I , sitting with them , and walking with them , and talking with them , and noticing from day to day how they went on , falling deeper and deeper in love , and saying nothing about it , and each shyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets , perhaps not yet suspected even by the other - I am sure that I was scarcely less enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased with the pretty dream . We were going on in this way , when one morning at breakfast Mr. Jarndyce received a letter , and looking at the superscription , said , "
57071	57099	57065	57065	Boythorn	367	" and opened and read it with evident pleasure , announcing to us in a parenthesis when he was about half - way through , that Boythorn was "
57102	57145	57146	57146	I	0	" on a visit . Now who was Boythorn , we all thought . And I dare say we all thought too - I am sure I did , for one - would Boythorn at all interfere with what was going forward ? "
57157	57173	57154	57155	Lawrence Boythorn	367	" said Mr. Jarndyce , tapping the letter as he laid it on the table , "
57248	57249	57244	57246	a tremendous fellow	2067	" "
57255	57259	57244	57246	a tremendous fellow	2067	" asked Richard . "
57269	57274	57263	57263	Rick	319	" said Mr. Jarndyce ; "
57340	57372	57379	57380	the man	9972	" As Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn , we observed the favourable omen that there was not the least indication of any change in the wind . "
57426	57430	57418	57419	a visitor	2077	" he pursued . "
57551	57555	57548	57549	his man	2082	" to me , "
57565	57666	57548	57549	his man	2082	" I took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr. Boythorn 's reception , and we looked forward to his arrival with some curiosity . The afternoon wore away , however , and he did not appear . The dinner - hour arrived , and still he did not appear . The dinner was put back an hour , and we were sitting round the fire with no light but the blaze when the hall - door suddenly burst open and the hall resounded with these words , uttered with the greatest vehemence and in a stentorian tone : "
57738	57739	57741	57741	he	2084	" "
57747	57752	57741	57741	he	2084	" Mr. Jarndyce inquired . "
57771	57776	57764	57764	his	2091	" returned the other . "
57824	57825	57808	57808	I	0	" "
57831	57836	57808	57808	I	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "
57843	57856	57808	57808	I	0	" laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn , really making the whole house vibrate . "
57942	57943	57933	57933	I	0	" "
57951	57956	57933	57933	I	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "
57964	57965	57960	57960	you	0	" "
57972	57985	57960	57960	you	0	" returned his guest , who seemed to refer to his watch , "
58025	58026	58019	58019	myself	0	" "
58035	58040	58019	58019	myself	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "
58049	58054	58055	58055	I	0	" cried the visitor . "
58090	58107	58080	58080	I	0	" Talking thus , they went upstairs , and presently we heard him in his bedroom thundering "
58114	58117	58080	58080	I	0	" and again "
58124	58450	58080	58080	I	0	" until the flattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and to laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him laugh . We all conceived a prepossession in his favour , for there was a sterling quality in this laugh , and in his vigorous , healthy voice , and in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word he spoke , and in the very fury of his superlatives , which seemed to go off like blank cannons and hurt nothing . But we were hardly prepared to have it so confirmed by his appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented him . He was not only a very handsome old gentleman - upright and stalwart as he had been described to us - with a massive grey head , a fine composure of face when silent , a figure that might have become corpulent but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it no rest , and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but for the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to assist ; but he was such a true gentleman in his manner , so chivalrously polite , his face was lighted by a smile of so much sweetness and tenderness , and it seemed so plain that he had nothing to hide , but showed himself exactly as he was - incapable , as Richard said , of anything on a limited scale , and firing away with those blank great guns because he carried no small arms whatever - that really I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat at dinner , whether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me , or was led by Mr. Jarndyce into some great volley of superlatives , or threw up his head like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous "
58457	58458	58080	58080	I	0	" "
58470	58475	58459	58459	You	2103	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "
58488	58493	58494	58494	He	2104	" replied the other . "
58555	58642	58540	58541	his father	1799	" The subject of this laudation was a very little canary , who was so tame that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn 's man , on his forefinger , and after taking a gentle flight round the room , alighted on his master 's head . To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the most implacable and passionate sentiments , with this fragile mite of a creature quietly perched on his forehead , was to have a good illustration of his character , I thought . "
58649	58668	58540	58541	his father	1799	" he said , very gently holding up a bit of bread to the canary to peck at , "
58744	58759	58760	58760	I	0	" All this time the very small canary was eating out of his hand . "
58778	58785	58760	58760	I	0	" returned Mr. Jarndyce , laughing , "
58806	58807	58760	58760	I	0	" "
58825	58830	58760	58760	I	0	" said Mr. Boythorn . "
58906	58952	58883	58884	the Devil	1499	" It was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he recommended this strong measure of reform . When we laughed , he threw up his head and shook his broad chest , and again the whole country seemed to echo to his "
58959	59014	58883	58884	the Devil	1499	" It had not the least effect in disturbing the bird , whose sense of security was complete and who hopped about the table with its quick head now on this side and now on that , turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if he were no more than another bird . "
59031	59036	59018	59018	you	2117	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "
59049	59050	59051	59052	The fellow	2119	" "
59071	59076	59062	59062	I	0	" returned Mr. Boythorn . "
59105	59106	59102	59103	Sir Lucifer	368	" "
59113	59123	59102	59103	Sir Lucifer	368	" said my guardian laughingly to Ada and Richard . "
59137	59142	59124	59124	I	0	" resumed our visitor , "
59180	59181	59183	59183	he	2119	" "
59187	59191	59183	59183	he	2119	" suggested Richard . "
59196	59206	59183	59183	he	2119	" exclaimed Mr. Boythorn , suddenly firing another volley , "
59626	59729	59602	59602	He	2119	" To hear him say all this with unimaginable energy , one might have thought him the angriest of mankind . To see him at the very same time , looking at the bird now perched upon his thumb and softly smoothing its feathers with his forefinger , one might have thought him the gentlest . To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of his face then , one might have supposed that he had not a care in the world , or a dispute , or a dislike , but that his whole existence was a summer joke . "
59734	59738	59602	59602	He	2119	" he said , "
59754	59762	59750	59750	I	0	" here he softened in a moment , "
59869	59870	59872	59887	the man to allow his junior to be walked over either ? " said my guardian	10531	" "
59884	59889	59872	59887	the man to allow his junior to be walked over either ? " said my guardian	10531	" said my guardian . "
59894	59920	59872	59887	the man to allow his junior to be walked over either ? " said my guardian	10531	" said Mr. Boythorn , clapping him on the shoulder with an air of protection that had something serious in it , though he laughed . "
59978	59979	59984	59984	Esther	283	" "
59986	59991	59994	59994	guardian	1915	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "

60001	60006	59994	59994	guardian	1915	" said Mr. Boythorn . "
60029	60042	60019	60020	Miss Summerson	283	" They all encouraged me ; they were determined to do it . "
60084	60176	60073	60073	I	0	" I saw him so often in the course of the evening , which passed very pleasantly , contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a satisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat at a little distance from the piano listening to the music - and he had small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music , for his face showed it - that I asked my guardian as we sat at the backgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married . "
60179	60183	60073	60073	I	0	" said he . "
60186	60187	60073	60073	I	0	" "
60194	60197	60073	60073	I	0	" said I. "
60205	60212	60200	60200	you	0	" he returned with a smile . "
60217	60234	60215	60215	guardian	1915	" I explained , not without reddening a little at hazarding what was in my thoughts , "
60260	60283	60248	60248	he	2168	" Mr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have just described him . I said no more . "
60291	60295	60284	60284	You	0	" he answered . "
60309	60310	60339	60339	you	0	" "

60394	60399	60383	60383	He	2168	" said Mr. Jarndyce , "
60430	60985	60424	60424	your	0	" I felt , from my guardian 's manner , that beyond this point I could not pursue the subject without changing the wind . I therefore forbore to ask any further questions . I was interested , but not curious . I thought a little while about this old love story in the night , when I was awakened by Mr. Boythorn 's lusty snoring ; and I tried to do that very difficult thing , imagine old people young again and invested with the graces of youth . But I fell asleep before I had succeeded , and dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother 's house . I am not sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is at all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my life . With the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to Mr. Boythorn informing him that one of their clerks would wait upon him at noon . As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills , and added up my books , and made all the household affairs as compact as possible , I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce , Ada , and Richard took advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion , Mr. Boythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy 's clerk and then was to go on foot to meet them on their return . Well ! I was full of business , examining tradesmen 's books , adding up columns , paying money , filing receipts , and I dare say making a great bustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in . I had had some idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young gentleman who had met me at the coach - office , and I was glad to see him , because he was associated with my present happiness . I scarcely knew him again , he was so uncommonly smart . He had an entirely new suit of glossy clothes on , a shining hat , lilac - kid gloves , a neckerchief of a variety of colours , a large hot - house flower in his button - hole , and a thick gold ring on his little finger . Besides which , he quite scented the dining - room with bear's - grease and other perfumery . He looked at me with an attention that quite confused me when I begged him to take a seat until the servant should return ; and as he sat there crossing and uncrossing his legs in a corner , and I asked him if he had had a pleasant ride , and hoped that Mr. Kenge was well , I never looked at him , but I found him looking at me in the same scrutinizing and curious way . When the request was brought to him that he would go upstairs to Mr. Boythorn 's room , I mentioned that he would find lunch prepared for him when he came down , of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would partake . He said with some embarrassment , holding the handle of the door , "
60998	61147	60987	60987	I	0	" I replied yes , I should be there ; and he went out with a bow and another look . I thought him only awkward and shy , for he was evidently much embarrassed ; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to wait until I saw that he had everything he wanted and then to leave him to himself . The lunch was soon brought , but it remained for some time on the table . The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one , and a stormy one too , I should think , for although his room was at some distance I heard his loud voice rising every now and then like a high wind , and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation . At last Mr. Guppy came back , looking something the worse for the conference . "
61153	61161	60987	60987	I	0	" he said in a low voice , "
61167	61168	61162	61162	he	2182	" "
61176	61273	61174	61174	sir	9569	" said I. Mr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the carving - knife on the carving - fork , still looking at me as I felt quite sure without looking at him in the same unusual manner . The sharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on me to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under which he seemed to labour , of not being able to leave off . He immediately looked at the dish and began to carve . "
61290	61291	61282	61282	You	9656	" "
61297	61300	61295	61295	you	9569	" said I. "
61315	61328	61313	61313	miss	9656	" said Mr. Guppy , hurriedly drinking off a glass of wine . "
61334	61337	61332	61332	you	9569	" said I. "
61360	61361	61354	61354	I	0	" "
61401	61422	61423	61423	I	0	" He drank off two more glasses of wine , one after another . I thought I had better go . "
61430	61442	61423	61423	I	0	" said Mr. Guppy , rising when he saw me rise . "
61457	61469	61445	61445	you	9656	" Not knowing what to say , I sat down again . "
61478	61491	61476	61476	miss	9656	" said Mr. Guppy , anxiously bringing a chair towards my table . "
61500	61506	61497	61497	you	0	" said I , wondering . "
61574	61575	61576	61576	I	0	" "

61641	61671	61630	61630	I	0	" All this time Mr. Guppy was either planing his forehead with his handkerchief or tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the palm of his right . "
61707	61728	61729	61729	You	9656	" He did so , and came back again . I took the opportunity of moving well behind my table . "
61743	61751	61740	61740	you	9656	" said Mr. Guppy , apparently refreshed . "
61755	61758	61740	61740	you	9656	" said I. "
61764	61769	61740	61740	you	9656	" said Mr. Guppy . "
62023	62046	62001	62001	you	283	" Mr. Guppy went down on his knees . I was well behind my table and not much frightened . I said , "
62072	62073	62058	62058	you	9569	" "
62080	62089	62058	62058	you	9569	" said Mr. Guppy , folding his hands . "
62101	62105	62099	62099	sir	9569	" I returned , "
62135	62147	62128	62128	you	9569	" He looked piteously , but slowly rose and did so . "
62157	62180	62155	62155	miss	9656	" he said with his hand upon his heart and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the tray , "
62203	62204	62191	62192	The soul	2206	" "
62211	62215	62216	62216	you	9569	" said I ; "
62232	62233	62234	62234	I	0	" "
62239	62244	62234	62234	I	0	" said Mr. Guppy . "

62278	62282	62258	62258	I	0	" said I , "
62290	62291	62292	62292	I	0	" "
62296	62331	62292	62292	I	0	" said Mr. Guppy , leaning forward over the tray and regarding me , as I again strangely felt , though my eyes were not directed to him , with his late intent look , "
62464	62509	62510	62511	Cruel miss	2211	" I told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my interest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination , and he would now understand that I requested him , if he pleased , to go away immediately . "
62513	62518	62510	62511	Cruel miss	2211	" said Mr. Guppy , "
62685	62686	62687	62687	I	0	" "
62695	62710	62692	62693	Mr. Guppy	301	" said I , rising and putting my hand upon the bell - rope , "
62781	62795	62778	62778	I	0	" I think I added , without very well knowing what I said , "
62821	62822	62827	62827	miss	9656	" "
62829	62843	62827	62827	miss	9656	" cried Mr. Guppy , checking me as I was about to ring . "
62850	62851	62852	62852	I	0	" "
62858	62862	62852	62852	I	0	" said I , "

62966	63583	62950	62951	Mrs. Guppy	300	" I rang the bell , the servant came , and Mr. Guppy , laying his written card upon the table and making a dejected bow , departed . Raising my eyes as he went out , I once more saw him looking at me after he had passed the door . I sat there for another hour or more , finishing my books and payments and getting through plenty of business . Then I arranged my desk , and put everything away , and was so composed and cheerful that I thought I had quite dismissed this unexpected incident . But , when I went upstairs to my own room , I surprised myself by beginning to laugh about it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry about it . In short , I was in a flutter for a little while and felt as if an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever had been since the days of the dear old doll , long buried in the garden . CHAPTER X The Law - Writer On the eastern borders of Chancery Lane , that is to say , more particularly in Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , Mr. Snagsby , law- stationer , pursues his lawful calling . In the shade of Cook 's Court , at most times a shady place , Mr. Snagsby has dealt in all sorts of blank forms of legal process ; in skins and rolls of parchment ; in paper - foolscap , brief , draft , brown , white , whitey- brown , and blotting ; in stamps ; in office - quills , pens , ink , India- rubber , pounce , pins , pencils , sealing - wax , and wafers ; in red tape and green ferret ; in pocket - books , almanacs , diaries , and law lists ; in string boxes , rulers , inkstands - glass and leaden - pen - knives , scissors , bodkins , and other small office - cutlery ; in short , in articles too numerous to mention , ever since he was out of his time and went into partnership with Peffer . On that occasion , Cook 's Court was in a manner revolutionized by the new inscription in fresh paint , PEFFER AND SNAGSBY , displacing the time - honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only . For smoke , which is the London ivy , had so wreathed itself round Peffer 's name and clung to his dwelling - place that the affectionate parasite quite overpowered the parent tree . Peffer is never seen in Cook 's Court now . He is not expected there , for he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard of St. Andrews , Holborn , with the waggons and hackney- coaches roaring past him all the day and half the night like one great dragon . If he ever steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in Cook 's Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the sanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street , whose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain , since he knows from his personal observation next to nothing about it - if Peffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook 's Court , which no law - stationer in the trade can positively deny , he comes invisibly , and no one is the worse or wiser . In his lifetime , and likewise in the period of Snagsby 's "
63585	64038	64039	64039	I	0	" of seven long years , there dwelt with Peffer in the same law- stationering premises a niece - a short , shrewd niece , something too violently compressed about the waist , and with a sharp nose like a sharp autumn evening , inclining to be frosty towards the end . The Cook 's Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of this niece did , in her daughter 's childhood , moved by too jealous a solicitude that her figure should approach perfection , lace her up every morning with her maternal foot against the bed - post for a stronger hold and purchase ; and further , that she exhibited internally pints of vinegar and lemon - juice , which acids , they held , had mounted to the nose and temper of the patient . With whichsoever of the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated , it either never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby , who , having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man 's estate , entered into two partnerships at once . So now , in Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one ; and the niece still cherishes her figure , which , however tastes may differ , is unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it . Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh , but , to the neighbours ' thinking , one voice too . That voice , appearing to proceed from Mrs. Snagsby alone , is heard in Cook 's Court very often . Mr. Snagsby , otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet tones , is rarely heard . He is a mild , bald , timid man with a shining head and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back . He tends to meekness and obesity . As he stands at his door in Cook 's Court in his grey shop - coat and black calico sleeves , looking up at the clouds , or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy flat ruler , snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two ' prentices , he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man . From beneath his feet , at such times , as from a shrill ghost unquiet in its grave , there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in the voice already mentioned ; and haply , on some occasions when these reach a sharper pitch than usual , Mr. Snagsby mentions to the ' prentices , "
64052	64189	64050	64050	Guster	373	" This proper name , so used by Mr. Snagsby , has before now sharpened the wit of the Cook 's Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the name of Mrs. Snagsby , seeing that she might with great force and expression be termed a Guster , in compliment to her stormy character . It is , however , the possession , and the only possession except fifty shillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with clothing , of a lean young woman from a workhouse by some supposed to have been christened Augusta who , although she was farmed or contracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of his species resident at Tooting , and can not fail to have been developed under the most favourable circumstances , "
64193	64885	64050	64050	Guster	373	" which the parish ca n't account for . Guster , really aged three or four and twenty , but looking a round ten years older , goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits , and is so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron saint that except when she is found with her head in the pail , or the sink , or the copper , or the dinner , or anything else that happens to be near her at the time of her seizure , she is always at work . She is a satisfaction to the parents and guardians of the ' prentices , who feel that there is little danger of her inspiring tender emotions in the breast of youth ; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby , who can always find fault with her ; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby , who thinks it a charity to keep her . The law - stationer 's establishment is , in Guster 's eyes , a temple of plenty and splendour . She believes the little drawing- room upstairs , always kept , as one may say , with its hair in papers and its pinafore on , to be the most elegant apartment in Christendom . The view it commands of Cook 's Court at one end not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street and of Coavinses ' the sheriff 's officer 's backyard at the other she regards as a prospect of unequalled beauty . The portraits it displays in oil - and plenty of it too - of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs. Snagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as achievements of Raphael or Titian . Guster has some recompenses for her many privations . Mr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the business to Mrs. Snagsby . She manages the money , reproaches the tax - gatherers , appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays , licenses Mr. Snagsby 's entertainments , and acknowledges no responsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner , insomuch that she is the high standard of comparison among the neighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides , and even out in Holborn , who in any domestic passages of arms habitually call upon their husbands to look at the difference between their the wives ' position and Mrs. Snagsby 's , and their the husbands ' behaviour and Mr. Snagsby 's . Rumour , always flying bat - like about Cook 's Court and skimming in and out at everybody 's windows , does say that Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is sometimes worried out of house and home , and that if he had the spirit of a mouse he would n't stand it . It is even observed that the wives who quote him to their self - willed husbands as a shining example in reality look down upon him and that nobody does so with greater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord is more than suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an instrument of correction . But these vague whisperings may arise from Mr. Snagsby 's being in his way rather a meditative and poetical man , loving to walk in Staple Inn in the summer - time and to observe how countrified the sparrows and the leaves are , also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a Sunday afternoon and to remark if in good spirits that there were old times once and that you 'd find a stone coffin or two now under that chapel , he 'll be bound , if you was to dig for it . He solaces his imagination , too , by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices , and Masters of the Rolls who are deceased ; and he gets such a flavour of the country out of telling the two ' prentices how he HAS heard say that a brook "
64890	65683	64050	64050	Guster	373	" once ran right down the middle of Holborn , when Turnstile really was a turnstile , leading slap away into the meadows - gets such a flavour of the country out of this that he never wants to go there . The day is closing in and the gas is lighted , but is not yet fully effective , for it is not quite dark . Mr. Snagsby standing at his shop - door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim westward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook 's Court . The crow flies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln 's Inn Garden into Lincoln 's Inn Fields . Here , in a large house , formerly a house of state , lives Mr. Tulkinghorn . It is let off in sets of chambers now , and in those shrunken fragments of its greatness , lawyers lie like maggots in nuts . But its roomy staircases , passages , and antechambers still remain ; and even its painted ceilings , where Allegory , in Roman helmet and celestial linen , sprawls among balustrades and pillars , flowers , clouds , and big - legged boys , and makes the head ache - as would seem to be Allegory 's object always , more or less . Here , among his many boxes labelled with transcendent names , lives Mr. Tulkinghorn , when not speechlessly at home in country - houses where the great ones of the earth are bored to death . Here he is to - day , quiet at his table . An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open . Like as he is to look at , so is his apartment in the dusk of the present afternoon . Rusty , out of date , withdrawing from attention , able to afford it . Heavy , broad - backed , old - fashioned , mahogany- and - horsehair chairs , not easily lifted ; obsolete tables with spindle - legs and dusty baize covers ; presentation prints of the holders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one , environ him . A thick and dingy Turkey - carpet muffles the floor where he sits , attended by two candles in old - fashioned silver candlesticks that give a very insufficient light to his large room . The titles on the backs of his books have retired into the binding ; everything that can have a lock has got one ; no key is visible . Very few loose papers are about . He has some manuscript near him , but is not referring to it . With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of sealing - wax he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of indecision is in his mind . Now the inkstand top is in the middle , now the red bit of sealing - wax , now the black bit . That 's not it . Mr. Tulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin again . Here , beneath the painted ceiling , with foreshortened Allegory staring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him , and he cutting it dead , Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office . He keeps no staff , only one middle - aged man , usually a little out at elbows , who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely overburdened with business . Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way . He wants no clerks . He is a great reservoir of confidences , not to be so tapped . His clients want HIM ; he is all in all . Drafts that he requires to be drawn are drawn by special- pleaders in the temple on mysterious instructions ; fair copies that he requires to be made are made at the stationers ' , expense being no consideration . The middle - aged man in the pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any crossing - sweeper in Holborn . The red bit , the black bit , the inkstand top , the other inkstand top , the little sand - box . So ! You to the middle , you to the right , you to the left . This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or never . Now ! Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up , adjusts his spectacles , puts on his hat , puts the manuscript in his pocket , goes out , tells the middle - aged man out at elbows , "
65690	65834	65835	65835	Master	1524	" Very rarely tells him anything more explicit . Mr. Tulkinghorn goes , as the crow came - not quite so straight , but nearly - to Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street . To Snagsby 's , Law- Stationer 's , Deeds engrossed and copied , Law - Writing executed in all its branches , c. , c. , c. It is somewhere about five or six o'clock in the afternoon , and a balmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook 's Court . It hovers about Snagsby 's door . The hours are early there : dinner at half - past one and supper at half - past nine . Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into the subterranean regions to take tea when he looked out of his door just now and saw the crow who was out late . "
65839	65933	65934	65934	Master	1524	" Guster is minding the shop , for the ' prentices take tea in the kitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby ; consequently , the robe - maker 's two daughters , combing their curls at the two glasses in the two second - floor windows of the opposite house , are not driving the two ' prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose , but are merely awakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster , whose hair wo n't grow , and never would , and it is confidently thought , never will . "
65938	66023	65934	65934	Master	1524	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn . Master is at home , and Guster will fetch him . Guster disappears , glad to get out of the shop , which she regards with mingled dread and veneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture of the law - a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off . Mr. Snagsby appears , greasy , warm , herbaceous , and chewing . Bolts a bit of bread and butter . Says , "
66033	66034	66030	66031	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" "
66045	66046	66043	66043	Snagsby	370	" "
66077	66121	66075	66075	sir	9569	" Snagsby has brightened in a moment . The confined room , strong of parchment - grease , is warehouse , counting - house , and copying - office . Mr. Tulkinghorn sits , facing round , on a stool at the desk . "
66128	66129	66132	66132	sir	9569	" "
66134	66175	66132	66132	sir	9569	" Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand , modestly anticipating profit . Mr. Snagsby , as a timid man , is accustomed to cough with a variety of expressions , and so to save words . "
66187	66188	66193	66193	we	2229	" "
66196	66197	66193	66193	we	2229	" "
66204	66228	66193	66193	we	2229	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn , carelessly feeling - tight , unopenable oyster of the old school ! - in the wrong coat- pocket , "
66295	66296	66285	66285	I	0	" "
66303	66339	66285	66285	I	0	" says Mr. Snagsby , taking it , laying it flat on the desk , and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a twist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers . "
66381	66427	66362	66362	I	0	" Mr. Snagsby takes his book down from the safe , makes another bolt of the bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short , eyes the affidavit aside , and brings his right forefinger travelling down a page of the book , "
66434	66435	66428	66432	Jewby - Packer - Jarndyce	377	" "
66444	66449	66442	66442	sir	9569	" says Mr. Snagsby . "
66482	66508	66513	66513	him	2235	" Mr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry , found it before the law- stationer , read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill . "
66517	66522	66523	66523	Nemo	378	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn . "
66557	66558	66559	66559	Nemo	378	" "
66561	66566	66559	66559	Nemo	378	" repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn . "
66574	66575	66567	66567	Nemo	378	" "
66589	66598	66584	66584	sir	9569	" Mr. Snagsby submits with his deferential cough . "
66637	66685	66689	66690	a customer	2244	" The tail of Mr. Snagsby 's eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs. Snagsby looking in at the shop - door to know what he means by deserting his tea . Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mrs. Snagsby , as who should say , "
66692	66693	66698	66698	sir	9569	" "
66700	66705	66698	66698	sir	9569	" repeats Mr. Snagsby . "
66792	66877	66780	66780	You	9569	" Mr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of Coavinses ' , the sheriff 's officer 's , where lights shine in Coavinses ' windows . Coavinses ' coffee - room is at the back , and the shadows of several gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds . Mr. Snagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head to glance over his shoulder at his little woman and to make apologetic motions with his mouth to this effect : "
66894	66895	66780	66780	You	9569	" "
66904	66909	66897	66897	you	9569	" asks Mr. Tulkinghorn . "
66922	66923	66920	66920	yours	9569	" "
66938	66939	66933	66933	you	9569	" "
66954	66971	66949	66949	he	2256	" Mr. Snagsby makes another bolt , as if the bit of bread and buffer were insurmountable "
66980	66981	66949	66949	he	2256	" "
66993	66994	66983	66983	you	9569	" "
67002	67027	67000	67000	sir	9569	" Mr. Snagsby pulls off his sleeves and his grey coat , pulls on his black coat , takes his hat from its peg . "
67036	67041	67000	67000	sir	9569	" he says aloud . "
67087	67131	67072	67073	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" Mrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer , retires behind the counter , peeps at them through the window - blind , goes softly into the back office , refers to the entries in the book still lying open . Is evidently curious . "
67143	67162	67141	67141	sir	9569	" says Mr. Snagsby , walking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to the lawyer ; "
67215	67406	67194	67194	He	2274	" It is quite dark now , and the gas - lamps have acquired their full effect . Jostling against clerks going to post the day 's letters , and against counsel and attorneys going home to dinner , and against plaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts , and against the general crowd , in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has interposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest business of life ; diving through law and equity , and through that kindred mystery , the street mud , which is made of nobody knows what and collects about us nobody knows whence or how - we only knowing in general that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to shovel it away - the lawyer and the law - stationer come to a rag and bottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise , lying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln 's Inn , and kept , as is announced in paint , to all whom it may concern , by one Krook . "
67415	67422	67413	67413	sir	9569	" says the law - stationer . "
67432	67438	67440	67440	you	9569	" says the lawyer unconcernedly . "
67442	67443	67440	67440	you	9569	" "
67452	67453	67445	67445	you	9569	" "
67477	67580	67475	67475	you	9569	" Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his little woman and his tea . But Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present . He goes a short way , turns back , comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook , and enters it straight . It is dim enough , with a blot - headed candle or so in the windows , and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by a fire . The old man rises and comes forward , with another blot - headed candle in his hand . "
67587	67588	67583	67584	your lodger	2278	" "
67595	67600	67601	67601	Male	2280	" says Mr. Krook . "
67609	67632	67603	67607	The person who does copying	2281	" Mr. Krook has eyed his man narrowly . Knows him by sight . Has an indistinct impression of his aristocratic repute . "
67642	67643	67634	67634	you	9569	" "
67646	67647	67634	67634	you	9569	" "
67656	67664	67651	67651	I	0	" says Mr. Krook with a grin . "
67684	67685	67682	67682	sir	9569	" "
67695	67700	67686	67686	I	0	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn . "
67713	67736	67686	67686	I	0	" Mr. Krook , with his cat beside him , stands at the bottom of the staircase , looking after Mr. Tulkinghorn . "
67741	67772	67686	67686	I	0	" he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly disappeared . The lawyer looks down over the hand - rail . The cat expands her wicked mouth and snarls at him . "
67795	67806	67789	67789	they	1807	" whispers Krook , going up a step or two . "
67814	67815	67809	67809	they	1807	" "
67882	68299	67879	67879	my	0	" Mr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way . He comes to the dark door on the second floor . He knocks , receives no answer , opens it , and accidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so . The air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it if he had not . It is a small room , nearly black with soot , and grease , and dirt . In the rusty skeleton of a grate , pinched at the middle as if poverty had gripped it , a red coke fire burns low . In the corner by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk , a wilderness marked with a rain of ink . In another corner a ragged old portmanteau on one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe ; no larger one is needed , for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man . The floor is bare , except that one old mat , trodden to shreds of rope - yarn , lies perishing upon the hearth . No curtain veils the darkness of the night , but the discoloured shutters are drawn together , and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them , famine might be staring in - the banshee of the man upon the bed . For , on a low bed opposite the fire , a confusion of dirty patchwork , lean - ribbed ticking , and coarse sacking , the lawyer , hesitating just within the doorway , sees a man . He lies there , dressed in shirt and trousers , with bare feet . He has a yellow look in the spectral darkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of its wick still burning has doubled over and left a tower of winding - sheet above it . His hair is ragged , mingling with his whiskers and his beard - the latter , ragged too , and grown , like the scum and mist around him , in neglect . Foul and filthy as the room is , foul and filthy as the air is , it is not easy to perceive what fumes those are which most oppress the senses in it ; but through the general sickliness and faintness , and the odour of stale tobacco , there comes into the lawyer 's mouth the bitter , vapid taste of opium . "
68305	68340	68341	68341	Hallo	379	" he cries , and strikes his iron candlestick against the door . He thinks he has awakened his friend . He lies a little turned away , but his eyes are surely open . "
68346	68351	68352	68352	Hallo	379	" he cries again . "
68356	68422	68354	68354	Hallo	379	" As he rattles on the door , the candle which has drooped so long goes out and leaves him in the dark , with the gaunt eyes in the shutters staring down upon the bed . CHAPTER XI Our Dear Brother A touch on the lawyer 's wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room , irresolute , makes him start and say , "
68427	68428	68354	68354	Hallo	379	" "
68433	68449	68431	68431	me	0	" returns the old man of the house , whose breath is in his ear . "
68456	68457	68452	68452	you	0	" "
68460	68461	68452	68452	you	0	" "
68470	68471	68464	68464	you	0	" "
68481	68599	68452	68452	you	0	" Krook takes it , goes to the fire , stoops over the red embers , and tries to get a light . The dying ashes have no light to spare , and his endeavours are vain . Muttering , after an ineffectual call to his lodger , that he will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from the shop , the old man departs . Mr. Tulkinghorn , for some new reason that he has , does not await his return in the room , but on the stairs outside . The welcome light soon shines upon the wall , as Krook comes slowly up with his green - eyed cat following at his heels . "
68608	68617	68601	68602	the man	9972	" inquired the lawyer in a low voice . "
68625	68637	68638	68638	I	0	" says Krook , shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows . "
68654	68691	68650	68650	himself	9972	" Thus whispering , they both go in together . As the light goes in , the great eyes in the shutters , darkening , seem to close . Not so the eyes upon the bed . "
68696	68701	68650	68650	himself	9972	" exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn . "
68706	68735	68650	68650	himself	9972	" Krook drops the heavy hand he has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over the bedside . They look at one another for a moment . "
68766	68794	68795	68796	Miss Flite	381	" says Krook , with his lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire 's wings . Mr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls , "
68811	68838	68809	68809	Flite	381	" Krook follows him with his eyes , and while he is calling , finds opportunity to steal to the old portmanteau and steal back again . "
68851	68901	68845	68847	The nearest doctor	2299	" So Mr. Krook addresses a crazy little woman who is his female lodger , who appears and vanishes in a breath , who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man brought from his dinner , with a broad , snuffy upper lip and a broad Scotch tongue . "
68911	68927	68909	68909	ye	381	" says the medical man , looking up at them after a moment 's examination . "
68936	68953	68928	68928	He	2300	" Mr. Tulkinghorn standing by the old portmanteau inquires if he has been dead any time . "
68959	68965	68957	68957	sir	9569	" says the medical gentleman . "
68978	68979	68969	68969	he	2300	" "
68988	69002	68969	68969	he	2300	" observes a dark young man on the other side of the bed . "
69013	69025	69011	69011	sir	9569	" inquires the first . The dark young man says yes . "
69035	69040	69027	69027	I	0	" replies the other , "
69048	69098	69099	69099	I	0	" With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and returns to finish his dinner . The dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face and carefully examines the law - writer , who has established his pretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one . "
69108	69112	69099	69099	I	0	" says he . "
69134	69142	69128	69129	anybody present	2304	" glancing round upon the three bystanders . "
69148	69163	69164	69164	He	2303	" grimly answers Krook , taking the candle from the surgeon 's outstretched hand . "
69176	69177	69164	69164	He	2303	" "
69182	69187	69178	69178	He	2303	" says the surgeon , "
69215	69226	69236	69236	you	0	" taking an old tea - pot from Mr. Krook , "
69233	69234	69238	69238	he	2303	" "
69244	69248	69238	69238	he	2303	" asks Krook . "
69255	69256	69238	69238	he	2303	" "
69259	69273	69274	69274	I	0	" Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible interest . "
69310	69311	69314	69314	he	2303	" "
69325	69346	69317	69317	His	2303	" says Krook , who might have changed eyes with his cat , as he casts his sharp glance around . "
69371	69372	69360	69360	he	2303	" "
69380	69381	69360	69360	he	2303	" "

69393	69403	69360	69360	he	2303	" says the young man , resuming his examination . "
69456	69488	69489	69489	I	0	" He says this , not unfeelingly , while sitting on the bedstead 's edge with his face towards that other face and his hand upon the region of the heart . "
69516	69526	69527	69527	You	0	" he continues , looking round . Krook replies , "
69580	69745	69746	69746	I	0	" During this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old portmanteau , with his hands behind him , equally removed , to all appearance , from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the bed - from the young surgeon 's professional interest in death , noticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as an individual ; from the old man 's unction ; and the little crazy woman 's awe . His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his rusty clothes . One could not even say he has been thinking all this while . He has shown neither patience nor impatience , nor attention nor abstraction . He has shown nothing but his shell . As easily might the tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case , as the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case . He now interposes , addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved , professional way . "
69751	69755	69746	69746	I	0	" he observes , "
69819	69859	69861	69861	you	2316	" to the little crazy woman , who has often seen him in court , and whom he has often seen , and who proposes , in frightened dumb - show , to go for the law - stationer . "
69864	69923	69861	69861	you	2316	" While she is gone , the surgeon abandons his hopeless investigation and covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane . Mr. Krook and he interchange a word or two . Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing , but stands , ever , near the old portmanteau . Mr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves . "
69930	69934	69927	69927	dear	1100	" he says ; "
69949	69950	69946	69946	my	0	" "
69968	69973	69952	69952	you	2316	" inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn . "

70000	70013	69998	69998	sir	9569	" says Mr. Snagsby , coughing his apologetic cough behind his hand , "
70031	70032	70033	70033	I	0	" "
70040	70045	70046	70046	I	0	" returns Mr. Tulkinghorn . "
70050	70051	70052	70053	No one	806	" "
70062	70072	70058	70058	I	0	" says Mr. Snagsby , with his deferential cough . "
70096	70097	70098	70098	I	0	" "
70104	70119	70098	70098	I	0	" says Mr. Snagsby after prefacing his reply with his cough of general propitiation , "
70133	70134	70130	70130	I	0	" "
70143	70179	70136	70136	he	2324	" suggests the surgeon to help him out . A pause . Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law - stationer . Mr. Krook , with his mouth open , looking for somebody to speak next . "
70187	70192	70194	70195	a person	1057	" says Mr. Snagsby , "
70270	70271	70257	70257	he	2324	" "
70277	70284	70257	70257	he	2324	" says Krook with a nod . "
70293	70300	70301	70301	he	2324	" says Mr. Snagsby , strengthened , "
70364	70386	70338	70338	her	2216	" a favourite apology for plain speaking with Mr. Snagsby , which he always offers with a sort of argumentative frankness , "
70483	70497	70499	70499	she	2216	" proceeds Mr. Snagsby after consulting his cough of consideration behind his hand , "
70642	70662	70663	70663	I	0	" Mr. Snagsby concludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed , as much as to add , "
70682	70683	70667	70669	my honourable friend	2347	" "
70690	70697	70667	70669	my honourable friend	2347	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook , "
70726	70727	70722	70722	You	370	" "
70734	70744	70730	70730	I	0	" returns the old man with a sudden grin . "
70747	70752	70730	70730	I	0	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn , "
70829	70830	70817	70817	he	370	" "
70844	71188	70842	70842	sir	9569	" says Snagsby . Ah , to be sure , so there is ! Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have seen it before , though he is standing so close to it , and though there is very little else , heaven knows . The marine - store merchant holds the light , and the law - stationer conducts the search . The surgeon leans against the corner of the chimney - piece ; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door . The apt old scholar of the old school , with his dull black breeches tied with ribbons at the knees , his large black waistcoat , his long- sleeved black coat , and his wisp of limp white neckerchief tied in the bow the peerage knows so well , stands in exactly the same place and attitude . There are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau ; there is a bundle of pawnbrokers ' duplicates , those turnpike tickets on the road of poverty ; there is a crumpled paper , smelling of opium , on which are scrawled rough memoranda - as , took , such a day , so many grains ; took , such another day , so many more - begun some time ago , as if with the intention of being regularly continued , but soon left off . There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers , all referring to coroners ' inquests ; there is nothing else . They search the cupboard and the drawer of the ink - splashed table . There is not a morsel of an old letter or of any other writing in either . The young surgeon examines the dress on the law- writer . A knife and some odd halfpence are all he finds . Mr. Snagsby 's suggestion is the practical suggestion after all , and the beadle must be called in . So the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle , and the rest come out of the room . "
71196	71201	70817	70817	he	370	" says the surgeon ; "
71207	71232	70817	70817	he	370	" Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him , and she goes furtively downstairs , winding her lithe tail and licking her lips . "
71236	71370	70842	70842	sir	9569	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn , and goes home to Allegory and meditation . By this time the news has got into the court . Groups of its inhabitants assemble to discuss the thing , and the outposts of the army of observation principally boys are pushed forward to Mr. Krook 's window , which they closely invest . A policeman has already walked up to the room , and walked down again to the door , where he stands like a tower , only condescending to see the boys at his base occasionally ; but whenever he does see them , they quail and fall back . Mrs. Perkins , who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms with Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in young Perkins ' having "
71372	71375	70842	70842	sir	9569	" young Piper "
71379	71681	71687	71687	his	2352	" renews her friendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion . The potboy at the corner , who is a privileged amateur , as possessing official knowledge of life and having to deal with drunken men occasionally , exchanges confidential communications with the policeman and has the appearance of an impregnable youth , unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable in station - houses . People talk across the court out of window , and bare - headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what 's the matter . The general feeling seems to be that it 's a blessing Mr. Krook warn't made away with first , mingled with a little natural disappointment that he was not . In the midst of this sensation , the beadle arrives . The beadle , though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a ridiculous institution , is not without a certain popularity for the moment , if it were only as a man who is going to see the body . The policeman considers him an imbecile civilian , a remnant of the barbarous watchmen times , but gives him admission as something that must be borne with until government shall abolish him . The sensation is heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the beadle is on the ground and has gone in . By and by the beadle comes out , once more intensifying the sensation , which has rather languished in the interval . He is understood to be in want of witnesses for the inquest to - morrow who can tell the coroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased . Is immediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing whatever . Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that Mrs. Green 's son "
71697	72628	71687	71687	his	2352	" which son of Mrs. Green 's appears , on inquiry , to be at the present time aboard a vessel bound for China , three months out , but considered accessible by telegraph on application to the Lords of the Admiralty . Beadle goes into various shops and parlours , examining the inhabitants , always shutting the door first , and by exclusion , delay , and general idiotcy exasperating the public . Policeman seen to smile to potboy . Public loses interest and undergoes reaction . Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with having boiled a boy , choruses fragments of a popular song to that effect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the workhouse . Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law and seize a vocalist , who is released upon the flight of the rest on condition of his getting out of this then , come , and cutting it - a condition he immediately observes . So the sensation dies off for the time ; and the unmoved policeman to whom a little opium , more or less , is nothing , with his shining hat , stiff stock , inflexible great - coat , stout belt and bracelet , and all things fitting , pursues his lounging way with a heavy tread , beating the palms of his white gloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a street - corner to look casually about for anything between a lost child and a murder . Under cover of the night , the feeble - minded beadle comes flitting about Chancery Lane with his summonses , in which every juror 's name is wrongly spelt , and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle 's own name , which nobody can read or wants to know . The summonses served and his witnesses forewarned , the beadle goes to Mr. Krook 's to keep a small appointment he has made with certain paupers , who , presently arriving , are conducted upstairs , where they leave the great eyes in the shutter something new to stare at , in that last shape which earthly lodgings take for No one - and for Every one . And all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau ; and the lonely figure on the bed , whose path in life has lain through five and forty years , lies there with no more track behind him that any one can trace than a deserted infant . Next day the court is all alive - is like a fair , as Mrs. Perkins , more than reconciled to Mrs. Piper , says in amicable conversation with that excellent woman . The coroner is to sit in the first - floor room at the Sol 's Arms , where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice a week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional celebrity , faced by Little Swills , the comic vocalist , who hopes according to the bill in the window that his friends will rally round him and support first - rate talent . The Sol 's Arms does a brisk stroke of business all the morning . Even children so require sustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has established himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says his brandy - balls go off like smoke . What time the beadle , hovering between the door of Mr. Krook 's establishment and the door of the Sol 's Arms , shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet spirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return . At the appointed hour arrives the coroner , for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle - ground attached to the Sol 's Arms . The coroner frequents more public - houses than any man alive . The smell of sawdust , beer , tobacco - smoke , and spirits is inseparable in his vocation from death in its most awful shapes . He is conducted by the beadle and the landlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room , where he puts his hat on the piano and takes a Windsor - chair at the head of a long table formed of several short tables put together and ornamented with glutinous rings in endless involutions , made by pots and glasses . As many of the jury as can crowd together at the table sit there . The rest get among the spittoons and pipes or lean against the piano . Over the coroner 's head is a small iron garland , the pendant handle of a bell , which rather gives the majesty of the court the appearance of going to be hanged presently . Call over and swear the jury ! While the ceremony is in progress , sensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a large shirt - collar , with a moist eye and an inflamed nose , who modestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public , but seems familiar with the room too . A whisper circulates that this is Little Swills . It is considered not unlikely that he will get up an imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the Harmonic Meeting in the evening . "
72633	72638	72631	72631	gentlemen	9573	" the coroner begins . "
72645	72661	72643	72643	you	9573	" says the beadle . Not to the coroner , though it might appear so . "
72666	72671	72664	72664	gentlemen	9573	" resumes the coroner . "
72744	72745	72874	72881	the active and intelligent beadle of the district	2359	" "
72750	72871	72872	72872	Mooney	392	" cries the beadle . So they go out in a loose procession , something after the manner of a straggling funeral , and make their inspection in Mr. Krook 's back second floor , from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and precipitately . The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons for whose accommodation he has provided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic Meeting Room should see all that is to be seen . For they are the public chroniclers of such inquiries by the line ; and he is not superior to the universal human infirmity , but hopes to read in print what "
72883	72983	72872	72872	Mooney	392	" said and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly and patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is , according to the latest examples . Little Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return . Mr. Tulkinghorn , also . Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction and seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer , a bagatelle - board , and the coal - box . The inquiry proceeds . The jury learn how the subject of their inquiry died , and learn no more about him . "
72994	72999	72984	72987	A very eminent solicitor	2361	" says the coroner , "
73062	73695	73054	73056	anybody in attendance	2367	" Mrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins . Mrs. Piper sworn . Anastasia Piper , gentlemen . Married woman . Now , Mrs. Piper , what have you got to say about this ? Why , Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say , chiefly in parentheses and without punctuation , but not much to tell . Mrs. Piper lives in the court which her husband is a cabinet - maker , and it has long been well beknown among the neighbours counting from the day next but one before the half - baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen months and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live such was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums as the plaintive - so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased - was reported to have sold himself . Thinks it was the plaintive 's air in which that report originatinin . See the plaintive often and considered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go about some children being timid and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins may be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her husband and herself and family . Has seen the plaintive wexed and worrited by the children for children they will ever be and you can not expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be Methoozellers which you was not yourself . On accounts of this and his dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick - axe from his pocket and split Johnny 's head which the child knows not fear and has repeatually called after him close at his eels . Never however see the plaintive take a pick - axe or any other wepping far from it . Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not partial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor grown person at any time excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing down the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here would tell you that he has been seen a - speaking to him frequent . Says the coroner , is that boy here ? Says the beadle , no , sir , he is not here . Says the coroner , go and fetch him then . In the absence of the active and intelligent , the coroner converses with Mr. Tulkinghorn . Oh ! Here 's the boy , gentlemen ! Here he is , very muddy , very hoarse , very ragged . Now , boy ! But stop a minute . Caution . This boy must be put through a few preliminary paces . Name , Jo . Nothing else that he knows on . Do n't know that everybody has two names . Never heerd of sich a think . Do n't know that Jo is short for a longer name . Thinks it long enough for HIM . HE do n't find no fault with it . Spell it ? No . HE ca n't spell it . No father , no mother , no friends . Never been to school . What 's home ? Knows a broom 's a broom , and knows it 's wicked to tell a lie . Do n't recollect who told him about the broom or about the lie , but knows both . Ca n't exactly say what 'll be done to him arter he 's dead if he tells a lie to the gentlemen here , but believes it 'll be something wery bad to punish him , and serve him right - and so he 'll tell the truth . "
73703	73715	73054	73056	anybody in attendance	2367	" says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head . "
73728	73734	73718	73718	you	2369	" asks an attentive juryman . "
73740	73745	73718	73718	you	2369	" says the coroner . "
73788	74025	73784	73785	the boy	1744	" Boy put aside , to the great edification of the audience , especially of Little Swills , the comic vocalist . Now . Is there any other witness ? No other witness . Very well , gentlemen ! Here 's a man unknown , proved to have been in the habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half , found dead of too much opium . If you think you have any evidence to lead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide , you will come to that conclusion . If you think it is a case of accidental death , you will find a verdict accordingly . Verdict accordingly . Accidental death . No doubt . Gentlemen , you are discharged . Good afternoon . While the coroner buttons his great - coat , Mr. Tulkinghorn and he give private audience to the rejected witness in a corner . That graceless creature only knows that the dead man whom he recognized just now by his yellow face and black hair was sometimes hooted and pursued about the streets . That one cold winter night when he , the boy , was shivering in a doorway near his crossing , the man turned to look at him , and came back , and having questioned him and found that he had not a friend in the world , said , "
74032	74101	74102	74102	I	0	" and gave him the price of a supper and a night 's lodging . That the man had often spoken to him since and asked him whether he slept sound at night , and how he bore cold and hunger , and whether he ever wished to die , and similar strange questions . That when the man had no money , he would say in passing , "
74114	74138	74112	74112	Jo	396	" but that when he had any , he had always as the boy most heartily believes been glad to give him some . "
74146	74159	74160	74160	Wen	398	" says the boy , wiping his eyes with his wretched sleeve . "
74195	74219	74192	74192	he	2378	" As he shuffles downstairs , Mr. Snagsby , lying in wait for him , puts a half - crown in his hand . "
74239	74250	74221	74221	you	2380	" says Mr. Snagsby with his finger on his nose , "
74257	74353	74221	74221	you	2380	" For some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol 's Arms colloquially . In the sequel , half - a - dozen are caught up in a cloud of pipe - smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol 's Arms ; two stroll to Hampstead ; and four engage to go half - price to the play at night , and top up with oysters . Little Swills is treated on several hands . Being asked what he thinks of the proceedings , characterizes them his strength lying in a slangular direction as "
74358	74477	74221	74221	you	2380	" The landlord of the Sol 's Arms , finding Little Swills so popular , commends him highly to the jurymen and public , observing that for a song in character he do n't know his equal and that that man 's character - wardrobe would fill a cart . Thus , gradually the Sol 's Arms melts into the shadowy night and then flares out of it strong in gas . The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving , the gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair , is faced red - faced by Little Swills ; their friends rally round them and support first - rate talent . In the zenith of the evening , Little Swills says , "
74506	74904	74906	74906	she	2384	" Is much applauded and encouraged ; goes out of the room as Swills ; comes in as the coroner not the least in the world like him ; describes the inquest , with recreative intervals of piano - forte accompaniment , to the refrain : With his the coroner 's tippy tol li doll , tippy tol lo doll , tippy tol li doll , Dee ! The jingling piano at last is silent , and the Harmonic friends rally round their pillows . Then there is rest around the lonely figure , now laid in its last earthly habitation ; and it is watched by the gaunt eyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night . If this forlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by the mother at whose breast he nestled , a little child , with eyes upraised to her loving face , and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon the neck to which it crept , what an impossibility the vision would have seemed ! Oh , if in brighter days the now- extinguished fire within him ever burned for one woman who held him in her heart , where is she , while these ashes are above the ground ! It is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby 's , in Cook 's Court , where Guster murders sleep by going , as Mr. Snagsby himself allows - not to put too fine a point upon it - out of one fit into twenty . The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender heart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been imagination , but for Tooting and her patron saint . Be it what it may , now , it was so direfully impressed at tea - time by Mr. Snagsby 's account of the inquiry at which he had assisted that at supper - time she projected herself into the kitchen , preceded by a flying Dutch cheese , and fell into a fit of unusual duration , which she only came out of to go into another , and another , and so on through a chain of fits , with short intervals between , of which she has pathetically availed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not to give her warning "
74911	74976	74906	74906	she	2384	" and also in appeals to the whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to bed . Hence , Mr. Snagsby , at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in Cursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his on the subject of daylight , says , drawing a long breath , though the most patient of men , "
74987	75369	74977	74977	I	0	" What question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he settles when he strains himself to such an extent , or why he should thus crow so men crow on various triumphant public occasions , however about what can not be of any moment to him , is his affair . It is enough that daylight comes , morning comes , noon comes . Then the active and intelligent , who has got into the morning papers as such , comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook 's and bears off the body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed - in churchyard , pestiferous and obscene , whence malignant diseases are communicated to the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed , while our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official back - stairs - would to heaven they HAD departed ! - are very complacent and agreeable . Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would reject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder at , they bring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian burial . With houses looking on , on every side , save where a reeking little tunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate - with every villainy of life in action close on death , and every poisonous element of death in action close on life - here they lower our dear brother down a foot or two , here sow him in corruption , to be raised in corruption : an avenging ghost at many a sick - bedside , a shameful testimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this boastful island together . Come night , come darkness , for you can not come too soon or stay too long by such a place as this ! Come , straggling lights into the windows of the ugly houses ; and you who do iniquity therein , do it at least with this dread scene shut out ! Come , flame of gas , burning so sullenly above the iron gate , on which the poisoned air deposits its witch - ointment slimy to the touch ! It is well that you should call to every passerby , "
75373	75471	74977	74977	I	0	" With the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel - court to the outside of the iron gate . It holds the gate with its hands and looks in between the bars , stands looking in for a little while . It then , with an old broom it carries , softly sweeps the step and makes the archway clean . It does so very busily and trimly , looks in again a little while , and so departs . Jo , is it thou ? Well , well ! Though a rejected witness , who "
75476	75514	75515	75515	He	2385	" what will be done to him in greater hands than men 's , thou art not quite in outer darkness . There is something like a distant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this : "
75525	76362	76363	76363	You	2386	" CHAPTER XII On the Watch It has left off raining down in Lincolnshire at last , and Chesney Wold has taken heart . Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares , for Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris . The fashionable intelligence has found it out and communicates the glad tidings to benighted England . It has also found out that they will entertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the ELITE of the BEAU MONDE the fashionable intelligence is weak in English , but a giant refreshed in French at the ancient and hospitable family seat in Lincolnshire . For the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle , and of Chesney Wold into the bargain , the broken arch of the bridge in the park is mended ; and the water , now retired within its proper limits and again spanned gracefully , makes a figure in the prospect from the house . The clear , cold sunshine glances into the brittle woods and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves and drying the moss . It glides over the park after the moving shadows of the clouds , and chases them , and never catches them , all day . It looks in at the windows and touches the ancestral portraits with bars and patches of brightness never contemplated by the painters . Athwart the picture of my Lady , over the great chimney- piece , it throws a broad bend - sinister of light that strikes down crookedly into the hearth and seems to rend it . Through the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind , my Lady and Sir Leicester , in their travelling chariot my Lady 's woman and Sir Leicester 's man affectionate in the rumble , start for home . With a considerable amount of jingling and whip - cracking , and many plunging demonstrations on the part of two bare - backed horses and two centaurs with glazed hats , jack - boots , and flowing manes and tails , they rattle out of the yard of the Hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome and canter between the sun - and - shadow - chequered colonnade of the Rue de Rivoli and the garden of the ill - fated palace of a headless king and queen , off by the Place of Concord , and the Elysian Fields , and the Gate of the Star , out of Paris . Sooth to say , they can not go away too fast , for even here my Lady Dedlock has been bored to death . Concert , assembly , opera , theatre , drive , nothing is new to my Lady under the worn - out heavens . Only last Sunday , when poor wretches were gay - within the walls playing with children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace Garden ; walking , a score abreast , in the Elysian Fields , made more Elysian by performing dogs and wooden horses ; between whiles filtering a few through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady to say a word or two at the base of a pillar within flare of a rusty little gridiron - full of gusty little tapers ; without the walls encompassing Paris with dancing , love - making , wine - drinking , tobacco - smoking , tomb - visiting , billiard card and domino playing , quack - doctoring , and much murderous refuse , animate and inanimate - only last Sunday , my Lady , in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant Despair , almost hated her own maid for being in spirits . She can not , therefore , go too fast from Paris . Weariness of soul lies before her , as it lies behind - her Ariel has put a girdle of it round the whole earth , and it can not be unclasped - but the imperfect remedy is always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced . Fling Paris back into the distance , then , exchanging it for endless avenues and cross - avenues of wintry trees ! And , when next beheld , let it be some leagues away , with the Gate of the Star a white speck glittering in the sun , and the city a mere mound in a plain - two dark square towers rising out of it , and light and shadow descending on it aslant , like the angels in Jacob 's dream ! Sir Leicester is generally in a complacent state , and rarely bored . When he has nothing else to do , he can always contemplate his own greatness . It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so inexhaustible a subject . After reading his letters , he leans back in his corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to society . "
76373	76397	76363	76363	You	2386	" says my Lady after a long time . She is fatigued with reading . Has almost read a page in twenty miles . "
76407	76408	76363	76363	You	2386	" "
76422	76423	76419	76419	I	0	" "
76428	76435	76424	76424	You	2386	" says Sir Leicester with admiration . "
76438	76443	76444	76444	He	271	" sighs my Lady . "
76452	76453	76454	76454	He	271	" "
76466	76478	76463	76463	he	271	" says Sir Leicester , selecting the letter and unfolding it , "
76512	76536	76509	76509	He	271	" Sir Leicester is so long in taking out his eye - glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks a little irritated . "
76645	76658	76639	76639	I	0	" My Lady , leaning forward , looks out of her window . "
76664	76669	76639	76639	I	0	" observes Sir Leicester . "
76678	76690	76670	76670	I	0	" says my Lady , still looking out of her window . "
76693	76703	76704	76704	I	0	" repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise . "
76712	76720	76704	76704	I	0	" says my Lady with unmistakable distinctness . "
76727	77326	76704	76704	I	0	" The carriage is stopped , the affectionate man alights from the rumble , opens the door , and lets down the steps , obedient to an impatient motion of my Lady 's hand . My Lady alights so quickly and walks away so quickly that Sir Leicester , for all his scrupulous politeness , is unable to assist her , and is left behind . A space of a minute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her . She smiles , looks very handsome , takes his arm , lounges with him for a quarter of a mile , is very much bored , and resumes her seat in the carriage . The rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three days , with more or less of bell - jingling and whip - cracking , and more or less plunging of centaurs and bare - backed horses . Their courtly politeness to each other at the hotels where they tarry is the theme of general admiration . Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady , says Madame , the hostess of the Golden Ape , and though he might be her amiable father , one can see at a glance that they love each other . One observes my Lord with his white hair , standing , hat in hand , to help my Lady to and from the carriage . One observes my Lady , how recognisant of my Lord 's politeness , with an inclination of her gracious head and the concession of her so - genteel fingers ! It is ravishing ! The sea has no appreciation of great men , but knocks them about like the small fry . It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester , whose countenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage - cheese and in whose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution . It is the Radical of Nature to him . Nevertheless , his dignity gets over it after stopping to refit , and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney Wold , lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire . Through the same cold sunlight , colder as the day declines , and through the same sharp wind , sharper as the separate shadows of bare trees gloom together in the woods , and as the Ghost 's Walk , touched at the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky , resigns itself to coming night , they drive into the park . The rooks , swinging in their lofty houses in the elm - tree avenue , seem to discuss the question of the occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath , some agreeing that Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down , some arguing with malcontents who wo n't admit it , now all consenting to consider the question disposed of , now all breaking out again in violent debate , incited by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will persist in putting in a last contradictory croak . Leaving them to swing and caw , the travelling chariot rolls on to the house , where fires gleam warmly through some of the windows , though not through so many as to give an inhabited expression to the darkening mass of front . But the brilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that . Mrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester 's customary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy . "
77342	77343	77344	77344	I	0	" "
77360	77361	77357	77358	Sir Leicester	268	" "
77369	77370	77366	77367	Mrs. Rouncewell	333	" "
77378	77443	77371	77372	My Lady	934	" says Mrs. Rouncewell with another curtsy . My Lady signifies , without profuse expenditure of words , that she is as wearily well as she can hope to be . But Rosa is in the distance , behind the housekeeper ; and my Lady , who has not subdued the quickness of her observation , whatever else she may have conquered , asks , "
77449	77450	77446	77447	that girl	2394	" "
77462	77463	77460	77460	Rosa	338	" "
77469	77482	77467	77467	Rosa	338	" Lady Dedlock beckons her , with even an appearance of interest . "
77495	77515	77486	77486	you	338	" she says , touching her shoulder with her two forefingers . Rosa , very much abashed , says , "
77525	77548	77486	77486	you	338	" and glances up , and glances down , and do n't know where to look , but looks all the prettier . "
77554	77555	77552	77552	you	338	" "
77561	77562	77552	77552	you	338	" "
77565	77571	77574	77574	they	2400	" repeats my Lady thoughtfully . "
77582	77583	77574	77574	they	2400	" "
77589	77786	77586	77587	my Lady	934	" My Lady taps her dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers and goes on to the foot of the oak staircase , where Sir Leicester pauses for her as her knightly escort . A staring old Dedlock in a panel , as large as life and as dull , looks as if he did n't know what to make of it , which was probably his general state of mind in the days of Queen Elizabeth . That evening , in the housekeeper 's room , Rosa can do nothing but murmur Lady Dedlock 's praises . She is so affable , so graceful , so beautiful , so elegant ; has such a sweet voice and such a thrilling touch that Rosa can feel it yet ! Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this , not without personal pride , reserving only the one point of affability . Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that . Heaven forbid that she should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of that excellent family , above all , of my Lady , whom the whole world admires ; but if my Lady would only be "
77792	77809	77586	77587	my Lady	934	" not quite so cold and distant , Mrs. Rouncewell thinks she would be more affable . "
77816	77822	77586	77587	my Lady	934	" Mrs. Rouncewell adds - only "
77824	77851	77586	77587	my Lady	934	" because it borders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it is , in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs - "
77890	77891	77878	77878	she	934	" "
77904	77924	77897	77897	her	934	" says Watt , who has been home and come back again , he is such a good grandson . "
77932	77939	77897	77897	her	934	" returns the housekeeper with dignity , "
77965	77966	77967	77967	I	0	" "
77983	77984	77975	77975	she	934	" "
78004	78005	77995	77997	The Dedlock family	2410	" "
78008	78012	77995	77997	The Dedlock family	2410	" says Watt , "
78046	78047	78048	78049	Sir Leicester	268	" "
78064	78065	78066	78067	Sir Leicester	268	" "
78075	78079	78066	78067	Sir Leicester	268	" says Watt , "
78128	78129	78137	78137	child	9593	" "
78139	78140	78137	78137	child	9593	" "
78147	78151	78141	78141	I	0	" says Watt , "
78167	78504	78153	78153	I	0	" He happens to glance at Rosa , who looks down and is very shy indeed . But according to the old superstition , it should be Rosa 's ears that burn , and not her fresh bright cheeks , for my Lady 's maid is holding forth about her at this moment with surpassing energy . My Lady 's maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty , from somewhere in the southern country about Avignon and Marseilles , a large - eyed brown woman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain feline mouth and general uncomfortable tightness of face , rendering the jaws too eager and the skull too prominent . There is something indefinably keen and wan about her anatomy , and she has a watchful way of looking out of the corners of her eyes without turning her head which could be pleasantly dispensed with , especially when she is in an ill humour and near knives . Through all the good taste of her dress and little adornments , these objections so express themselves that she seems to go about like a very neat she - wolf imperfectly tamed . Besides being accomplished in all the knowledge appertaining to her post , she is almost an Englishwoman in her acquaintance with the language ; consequently , she is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for having attracted my Lady 's attention , and she pours them out with such grim ridicule as she sits at dinner that her companion , the affectionate man , is rather relieved when she arrives at the spoon stage of that performance . Ha , ha , ha ! She , Hortense , been in my Lady 's service since five years and always kept at the distance , and this doll , this puppet , caressed - absolutely caressed - by my Lady on the moment of her arriving at the house ! Ha , ha , ha ! "
78516	78517	78507	78507	you	2421	" "
78523	78529	78507	78507	you	2421	" You are right there ! "
78551	80288	78541	78541	they	2425	" Oh , how droll ! It is the BEST thing altogether . In short , it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense ca n't forget it ; but at meals for days afterwards , even among her countrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of visitors , relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke - an enjoyment expressed , in her own convivial manner , by an additional tightness of face , thin elongation of compressed lips , and sidewise look , which intense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady 's mirrors when my Lady is not among them . All the mirrors in the house are brought into action now , many of them after a long blank . They reflect handsome faces , simpering faces , youthful faces , faces of threescore and ten that will not submit to be old ; the entire collection of faces that have come to pass a January week or two at Chesney Wold , and which the fashionable intelligence , a mighty hunter before the Lord , hunts with a keen scent , from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James 's to their being run down to death . The place in Lincolnshire is all alive . By day guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods , horsemen and carriages enliven the park roads , servants and hangers - on pervade the village and the Dedlock Arms . Seen by night from distant openings in the trees , the row of windows in the long drawing - room , where my Lady 's picture hangs over the great chimney- piece , is like a row of jewels set in a black frame . On Sunday the chill little church is almost warmed by so much gallant company , and the general flavour of the Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate perfumes . The brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it no contracted amount of education , sense , courage , honour , beauty , and virtue . Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of its immense advantages . What can it be ? Dandyism ? There is no King George the Fourth now more the pity to set the dandy fashion ; there are no clear - starched jack - towel neckcloths , no short - waisted coats , no false calves , no stays . There are no caricatures , now , of effeminate exquisites so arrayed , swooning in opera boxes with excess of delight and being revived by other dainty creatures poking long - necked scent - bottles at their noses . There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into his buckskins , or who goes to see all the executions , or who is troubled with the self - reproach of having once consumed a pea . But is there dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle notwithstanding , dandyism of a more mischievous sort , that has got below the surface and is doing less harmless things than jack- towelling itself and stopping its own digestion , to which no rational person need particularly object ? Why , yes . It can not be disguised . There ARE at Chesney Wold this January week some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion , who have set up a dandyism - in religion , for instance . Who in mere lackadaisical want of an emotion have agreed upon a little dandy talk about the vulgar wanting faith in things in general , meaning in the things that have been tried and found wanting , as though a low fellow should unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling after finding it out ! Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by putting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few hundred years of history . There are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion , not so new , but very elegant , who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world and to keep down all its realities . For whom everything must be languid and pretty . Who have found out the perpetual stoppage . Who are to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing . Who are not to be disturbed by ideas . On whom even the fine arts , attending in powder and walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain , must array themselves in the milliners ' and tailors ' patterns of past generations and be particularly careful not to be in earnest or to receive any impress from the moving age . Then there is my Lord Boodle , of considerable reputation with his party , who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester Dedlock with much gravity , after dinner , that he really does not see to what the present age is tending . A debate is not what a debate used to be ; the House is not what the House used to be ; even a Cabinet is not what it formerly was . He perceives with astonishment that supposing the present government to be overthrown , the limited choice of the Crown , in the formation of a new ministry , would lie between Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle - supposing it to be impossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle , which may be assumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of that affair with Hoodle . Then , giving the Home Department and the leadership of the House of Commons to Joodle , the Exchequer to Koodle , the Colonies to Loodle , and the Foreign Office to Moodle , what are you to do with Noodle ? You ca n't offer him the Presidency of the Council ; that is reserved for Poodle . You ca n't put him in the Woods and Forests ; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle . What follows ? That the country is shipwrecked , lost , and gone to pieces as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock because you ca n't provide for Noodle ! On the other hand , the Right Honourable William Buffy , M.P. , contends across the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the country - about which there is no doubt ; it is only the manner of it that is in question - is attributable to Cuffy . If you had done with Cuffy what you ought to have done when he first came into Parliament , and had prevented him from going over to Duffy , you would have got him into alliance with Fuffy , you would have had with you the weight attaching as a smart debater to Guffy , you would have brought to bear upon the elections the wealth of Huffy , you would have got in for three counties Juffy , Kuffy , and Luffy , and you would have strengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the business habits of Muffy . All this , instead of being as you now are , dependent on the mere caprice of Puffy ! As to this point , and as to some minor topics , there are differences of opinion ; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and distinguished circle , all round , that nobody is in question but Boodle and his retinue , and Buffy and HIS retinue . These are the great actors for whom the stage is reserved . A People there are , no doubt - a certain large number of supernumeraries , who are to be occasionally addressed , and relied upon for shouts and choruses , as on the theatrical stage ; but Boodle and Buffy , their followers and families , their heirs , executors , administrators , and assigns , are the born first - actors , managers , and leaders , and no others can appear upon the scene for ever and ever . In this , too , there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than the brilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the long run . For it is , even with the stillest and politest circles , as with the circle the necromancer draws around him - very strange appearances may be seen in active motion outside . With this difference , that being realities and not phantoms , there is the greater danger of their breaking in . Chesney Wold is quite full anyhow , so full that a burning sense of injury arises in the breasts of ill - lodged ladies'-maids , and is not to he extinguished . Only one room is empty . It is a turret chamber of the third order of merit , plainly but comfortably furnished and having an old - fashioned business air . It is Mr. Tulkinghorn 's room , and is never bestowed on anybody else , for he may come at any time . He is not come yet . It is his quiet habit to walk across the park from the village in fine weather , to drop into this room as if he had never been out of it since he was last seen there , to request a servant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived in case he should be wanted , and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of the library - door . He sleeps in his turret with a complaining flag- staff over his head , and has some leads outside on which , any fine morning when he is down here , his black figure may be seen walking before breakfast like a larger species of rook . Every day before dinner , my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the library , but he is not there . Every day at dinner , my Lady glances down the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive him if he had just arrived , but there is no vacant place . Every night my Lady casually asks her maid , "
80294	80301	80290	80291	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Every night the answer is , "
80310	80352	78541	78541	they	2425	" One night , while having her hair undressed , my Lady loses herself in deep thought after this reply until she sees her own brooding face in the opposite glass , and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her . "
80360	80372	80304	80305	my Lady	934	" says my Lady then , addressing the reflection of Hortense , "
80386	80387	80377	80377	You	271	" "
80397	80398	80392	80393	your Ladyship	2428	" "
80401	80406	80407	80407	you	271	" says my Lady , "
80414	80564	80407	80407	you	271	" At length , one afternoon a little before sunset , when the bright groups of figures which have for the last hour or two enlivened the Ghost 's Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady remain upon the terrace , Mr. Tulkinghorn appears . He comes towards them at his usual methodical pace , which is never quickened , never slackened . He wears his usual expressionless mask - if it be a mask - and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every crease of his dress . Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great or whether he yields them nothing beyond the services he sells is his personal secret . He keeps it , as he keeps the secrets of his clients ; he is his own client in that matter , and will never betray himself . "
80573	80632	80567	80567	you	2429	" says Sir Leicester , giving him his hand . Mr. Tulkinghorn is quite well . Sir Leicester is quite well . My Lady is quite well . All highly satisfactory . The lawyer , with his hands behind him , walks at Sir Leicester 's side along the terrace . My Lady walks upon the other side . "
80638	80653	80654	80655	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" says Sir Leicester . A gracious observation . As much as to say , "
80690	80707	80675	80675	We	2430	" Mr. Tulkinghorn , comprehending it , inclines his head and says he is much obliged . "
80715	80719	80708	80708	I	0	" he explains , "
80739	80740	80741	80749	A man of a very ill - regulated mind	2432	" "
80751	80758	80741	80749	A man of a very ill - regulated mind	2432	" observes Sir Leicester with severity . "
80777	80778	80779	80779	He	2434	" "
80783	80788	80779	80779	He	2434	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn . "
80800	80811	80812	80812	I	0	" says Sir Leicester , looking most profoundly obstinate himself . "
80822	80823	80812	80812	I	0	" "
80829	80834	80779	80779	He	2434	" pursues the lawyer , "

80962	80970	80971	80971	I	0	" Mr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again . "
80977	80981	80971	80971	I	0	" he says . "

81007	81013	81004	81005	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Sir Leicester interrupts him , "
81056	81066	81004	81005	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" adds Sir Leicester after a moment 's pause , "
81076	81108	81018	81025	An exceedingly ill - conditioned , levelling person	2439	" Sir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden in passing this capital sentence , as if it were the next satisfactory thing to having the sentence executed . "
81115	81119	81018	81025	An exceedingly ill - conditioned , levelling person	2439	" says he , "
81135	81155	81156	81156	You	271	" As they turn towards the hall - door , Lady Dedlock addresses Mr. Tulkinghorn for the first time . "
81215	81216	81217	81217	You	271	" "
81221	81226	81217	81217	You	271	" Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats . "
81231	81237	81217	81217	You	271	" returns my Lady carelessly . "
81270	81271	81248	81248	you	271	" "
81274	81275	81248	81248	you	271	" "
81280	81407	81248	81248	you	271	" They pass into a sombre breakfast - room on the ground floor , lighted in the day by two deep windows . It is now twilight . The fire glows brightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window - glass , where , through the cold reflection of the blaze , the colder landscape shudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along , the only traveller besides the waste of clouds . My Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney - corner , and Sir Leicester takes another great chair opposite . The lawyer stands before the fire with his hand out at arm 's length , shading his face . He looks across his arm at my Lady . "
81410	81414	81248	81248	you	271	" he says , "

81474	81496	81497	81497	I	0	" remonstrated Sir Leicester . Not so much shocked by the fact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned . "

81934	81940	81868	81868	They	10776	" says the lawyer meditatively , "
81954	82084	81868	81868	They	10776	" During the utterance of every word of this short dialogue , Lady Dedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn , without any other alteration in their customary deportment , have looked very steadily at one another - as was natural , perhaps , in the discussion of so unusual a subject . Sir Leicester has looked at the fire , with the general expression of the Dedlock on the staircase . The story being told , he renews his stately protest , saying that as it is quite clear that no association in my Lady 's mind can possibly be traceable to this poor wretch unless he was a begging - letter writer , he trusts to hear no more about a subject so far removed from my Lady 's station . "
82092	82104	82106	82106	they	2459	" says my Lady , gathering up her mantles and furs , "
82127	82472	82117	82118	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Mr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she passes out . She passes close to him , with her usual fatigued manner and insolent grace . They meet again at dinner - again , next day - again , for many days in succession . Lady Dedlock is always the same exhausted deity , surrounded by worshippers , and terribly liable to be bored to death , even while presiding at her own shrine . Mr. Tulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble confidences , so oddly but of place and yet so perfectly at home . They appear to take as little note of one another as any two people enclosed within the same walls could . But whether each evermore watches and suspects the other , evermore mistrustful of some great reservation ; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the other , and never to be taken unawares ; what each would give to know how much the other knows - all this is hidden , for the time , in their own hearts . CHAPTER XIII Esther 's Narrative We held many consultations about what Richard was to be , first without Mr. Jarndyce , as he had requested , and afterwards with him , but it was a long time before we seemed to make progress . Richard said he was ready for anything . When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he might not already be too old to enter the Navy , Richard said he had thought of that , and perhaps he was . When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what he thought of the Army , Richard said he had thought of that , too , and it was n't a bad idea . When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide within himself whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary boyish inclination or a strong impulse , Richard answered , Well he really HAD tried very often , and he could n't make out . "
82481	82488	82117	82118	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Mr. Jarndyce said to me , "
82623	82891	82892	82892	I	0	" I felt this to be true ; though if I may venture to mention what I thought besides , I thought it much to be regretted that Richard 's education had not counteracted those influences or directed his character . He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt , I understood , to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most admirable manner . But I never heard that it had been anybody 's business to find out what his natural bent was , or where his failings lay , or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM . HE had been adapted to the verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection that if he had remained at school until he was of age , I suppose he could only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had enlarged his education by forgetting how to do it . Still , although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful , and very improving , and very sufficient for a great many purposes of life , and always remembered all through life , I did doubt whether Richard would not have profited by some one studying him a little , instead of his studying them quite so much . To be sure , I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know whether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to the same extent - or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever did . "
82899	82905	82959	82959	sir	9569	" said Richard , musing , "
82935	82936	82937	82937	You	0	" "
82947	82952	82937	82937	You	0	" suggested Mr. Jarndyce . "
82961	82965	82959	82959	sir	9569	" replied Richard . "
82988	82989	82990	82990	Surgeon	2469	" "
82992	82997	82990	82990	Surgeon	2469	" suggested Mr. Jarndyce . "
83005	83021	83003	83003	sir	9569	" cried Richard . I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before . "
83029	83037	83027	83027	sir	9569	" repeated Richard with the greatest enthusiasm . "
83047	83234	83027	83027	sir	9569	" He was not to be laughed out of it , though he laughed at it heartily . He said he had chosen his profession , and the more he thought of it , the more he felt that his destiny was clear ; the art of healing was the art of all others for him . Mistrusting that he only came to this conclusion because , having never had much chance of finding out for himself what he was fitted for and having never been guided to the discovery , he was taken by the newest idea and was glad to get rid of the trouble of consideration , I wondered whether the Latin verses often ended in this or whether Richard 's was a solitary case . Mr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to put it to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter . Richard was a little grave after these interviews , but invariably told Ada and me that it was all right , and then began to talk about something else . "
83238	83265	83027	83027	sir	9569	" cried Mr. Boythorn , who interested himself strongly in the subject - though I need not say that , for he could do nothing weakly ; "
83330	83335	83339	83340	surgeons aboard	2477	" cried Mr. Boythorn , "
83391	83392	83395	83395	you	0	" "
83401	83406	83395	83395	you	0	" asked Mr. Jarndyce . "
83409	83415	83395	83395	you	0	" cried Mr. Boythorn firmly . "
83591	83612	83541	83541	clerks	893	" He wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a most agreeable smile and suddenly thundering , "
83619	83685	83541	83541	clerks	893	" over and over again , until anybody else might have been expected to be quite subdued by the exertion . As Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice after repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr. Jarndyce and had expired , and he still continued to assure Ada and me in the same final manner that it was "
83689	83754	83541	83541	clerks	893	" it became advisable to take Mr. Kenge into council . Mr. Kenge , therefore , came down to dinner one day , and leaned back in his chair , and turned his eye - glasses over and over , and spoke in a sonorous voice , and did exactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little girl . "
83757	83762	83541	83541	clerks	893	" said Mr. Kenge . "

83987	83997	83984	83985	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" said Mr. Kenge , gently nodding his head . "
84020	84029	84030	84030	I	0	" nodding feelingly and smoothly over those expressions , "
84077	84078	84079	84080	No one	806	" "
84087	84092	84082	84082	Rick	319	" said my guardian . "
84098	84102	84093	84094	No one	806	" said Richard . "
84106	84111	84093	84094	No one	806	" observed Mr. Kenge . "
84127	84128	84093	84094	No one	806	" "
84133	84137	84093	84094	No one	806	" said Richard . "
84141	84147	84148	84148	I	0	" observed Mr. Kenge again . "
84155	84159	84160	84160	I	0	" said Richard ; "

84176	84181	84160	84160	I	0	" returned Mr. Kenge . "
84317	84330	84287	84287	I	0	" said Mr. Kenge with a tinge of melancholy in his smile , "
84391	85356	84388	84388	he	2502	" As this was an opening in the prospect , it was arranged that Mr. Kenge should see his cousin . And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed to take us to London for a few weeks , it was settled next day that we should make our visit at once and combine Richard 's business with it . Mr. Boythorn leaving us within a week , we took up our abode at a cheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer 's shop . London was a great wonder to us , and we were out for hours and hours at a time , seeing the sights , which appeared to be less capable of exhaustion than we were . We made the round of the principal theatres , too , with great delight , and saw all the plays that were worth seeing . I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to be made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy . I was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada , and Richard was in the place he liked best , behind Ada 's chair , when , happening to look down into the pit , I saw Mr. Guppy , with his hair flattened down upon his head and woe depicted in his face , looking up at me . I felt all through the performance that he never looked at the actors but constantly looked at me , and always with a carefully prepared expression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection . It quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very embarrassing and so very ridiculous . But from that time forth , we never went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit , always with his hair straight and flat , his shirt - collar turned down , and a general feebleness about him . If he were not there when we went in , and I began to hope he would not come and yielded myself for a little while to the interest of the scene , I was certain to encounter his languishing eyes when I least expected it and , from that time , to be quite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening . I really can not express how uneasy this made me . If he would only have brushed up his hair or turned up his collar , it would have been bad enough ; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at me , and always in that demonstrative state of despondency , put such a constraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play , or to cry at it , or to move , or to speak . I seemed able to do nothing naturally . As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box , I could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on having me next them and that they could never have talked together so happily if anybody else had been in my place . So there I sat , not knowing where to look - for wherever I looked , I knew Mr. Guppy 's eyes were following me - and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this young man was putting himself on my account . Sometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce . Then I feared that the young man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him . Sometimes I thought of confiding in Richard , but was deterred by the possibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes . Sometimes I thought , should I frown at him or shake my head . Then I felt I could not do it . Sometimes I considered whether I should write to his mother , but that ended in my being convinced that to open a correspondence would be to make the matter worse . I always came to the conclusion , finally , that I could do nothing . Mr. Guppy 's perseverance , all this time , not only produced him regularly at any theatre to which we went , but caused him to appear in the crowd as we were coming out , and even to get up behind our fly - where I am sure I saw him , two or three times , struggling among the most dreadful spikes . After we got home , he haunted a post opposite our house . The upholsterer 's where we lodged being at the corner of two streets , and my bedroom window being opposite the post , I was afraid to go near the window when I went upstairs , lest I should see him as I did one moonlight night leaning against the post and evidently catching cold . If Mr. Guppy had not been , fortunately for me , engaged in the daytime , I really should have had no rest from him . While we were making this round of gaieties , in which Mr. Guppy so extraordinarily participated , the business which had helped to bring us to town was not neglected . Mr. Kenge 's cousin was a Mr. Bayham Badger , who had a good practice at Chelsea and attended a large public institution besides . He was quite willing to receive Richard into his house and to superintend his studies , and as it seemed that those could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger 's roof , and Mr. Badger liked Richard , and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger "
85360	85410	85672	85673	Miss Summerson	283	" an agreement was made , the Lord Chancellor 's consent was obtained , and it was all settled . On the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr. Badger , we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger 's house . We were to be "
85416	85631	85672	85673	Miss Summerson	283	" Mrs. Badger 's note said ; and we found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself . She was surrounded in the drawing - room by various objects , indicative of her painting a little , playing the piano a little , playing the guitar a little , playing the harp a little , singing a little , working a little , reading a little , writing poetry a little , and botanizing a little . She was a lady of about fifty , I should think , youthfully dressed , and of a very fine complexion . If I add to the little list of her accomplishments that she rouged a little , I do not mean that there was any harm in it . Mr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink , fresh - faced , crisp - looking gentleman with a weak voice , white teeth , light hair , and surprised eyes , some years younger , I should say , than Mrs. Bayham Badger . He admired her exceedingly , but principally , and to begin with , on the curious ground as it seemed to us of her having had three husbands . We had barely taken our seats when he said to Mr. Jarndyce quite triumphantly , "
85645	85646	85639	85641	Mrs. Bayham Badger	435	" "
85649	85654	85655	85655	Her	435	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "

85700	85710	85695	85698	And most remarkable men	2508	" said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence . "
85749	85757	85736	85737	Professor Dingo	436	" Mrs. Badger overheard him and smiled . "
85763	85771	85736	85737	Professor Dingo	436	" Mr. Badger replied to the smile , "

86126	86177	86112	86114	Mr. Bayham Badger	434	" in this portrait of Captain Swosser . It was taken on his return home from the African station , where he had suffered from the fever of the country . Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow . But it 's a very fine head . A very fine head ! "

86438	86531	86435	86435	he	288	" Excuse me ! This is an occasion , and ON an occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have . James , Captain Swosser 's wine ! Mr. Jarndyce , this is a wine that was imported by the captain , we will not say how many years ago . You will find it very curious . My dear , I shall he happy to take some of this wine with you . Captain Swosser 's claret to your mistress , James ! My love , your health ! "
86615	86621	86623	86624	Mrs. Badger	435	" The dear old Crippler ! "
86630	86760	86623	86624	Mrs. Badger	435	" She was a noble vessel . Trim , ship - shape , all a taunto , as Captain Swosser used to say . You must excuse me if I occasionally introduce a nautical expression ; I was quite a sailor once . Captain Swosser loved that craft for my sake . When she was no longer in commission , he frequently said that if he were rich enough to buy her old hulk , he would have an inscription let into the timbers of the quarter- deck where we stood as partners in the dance to mark the spot where he fell - raked fore and aft Captain Swosser used to say by the fire from my tops . It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes . "

86796	86881	86789	86789	she	435	" I felt it a good deal at first . Such an entire revolution in my mode of life ! But custom , combined with science - particularly science - inured me to it . Being the professor 's sole companion in his botanical excursions , I almost forgot that I had ever been afloat , and became quite learned . It is singular that the professor was the antipodes of Captain Swosser and that Mr. Badger is not in the least like either ! "

87562	87566	87568	87568	I	0	" And now , "
87570	87578	87568	87568	I	0	" I know the worst of it . "
87579	87594	87596	87596	Ada	294	" Oh , that 's not quite the worst of it , Esther dear ! "
87611	87614	87616	87616	I.	0	" No ? "
87617	87622	87616	87616	I.	0	" Not even that ? "
87623	87630	87632	87632	Ada	294	" No , not even that ! "
87638	87647	87635	87635	her	294	" Why , you never mean to say - "
87668	87682	87655	87655	Ada	294	" Yes , I do ! You know , you know I do ! "
87688	87704	87705	87705	I	0	" With all my heart I do ! With all my whole heart , Esther ! "
87764	87777	87778	87778	she	294	" Do you think my cousin John knows , dear Dame Durden ? "
87781	87792	87794	87794	I	0	" Unless my cousin John is blind , my pet , "
87796	87812	87794	87794	I	0	" I should think my cousin John knows pretty well as much as we know . "
87813	87824	87826	87826	Ada	294	" We want to speak to him before Richard goes , "
87829	87857	87826	87826	Ada	294	" and we wanted you to advise us , and to tell him so . Perhaps you would n't mind Richard 's coming in , Dame Durden ? "
87858	87871	87873	87873	I.	2553	" Oh ! Richard is outside , is he , my dear ? "
87874	87881	87883	87883	Ada	294	" I am not quite certain , "
87903	87914	87895	87895	she	294	" but I think he 's waiting at the door . "
88188	88194	88196	88196	he	10304	" Well , little woman , "
88203	88219	88196	88196	he	10304	" if you have accepted the trust , there can be no harm in it . "
88220	88227	88229	88229	I.	0	" I hope not , guardian , "
88230	88248	88229	88229	I.	0	" I can guarantee that there is no secrecy in it . For it only happened yesterday . "
88249	88259	88196	88196	he	10304	" Aye ? And what is it , Esther ? "
88260	88263	88265	88265	I	0	" Guardian , "
88267	88291	88265	88265	I	0	" you remember the happy night when first we came down to Bleak House ? When Ada was singing in the dark room ? "
88320	88323	88325	88325	I	0	" Because - "
88331	88337	88339	88339	he	10304	" Yes , my dear ! "
88341	88346	88339	88339	he	10304	" Do n't hurry . "
88347	88350	88352	88352	I	0	" Because , "
88354	88370	88352	88352	I	0	" Ada and Richard have fallen in love . And have told each other so . "
88371	88374	88376	88377	my guardian	10304	" Already ! "
88382	88385	88387	88387	I.	0	" Yes ! "
88388	88403	88387	88387	I.	0	" And to tell you the truth , guardian , I rather expected it . "
88404	88410	88412	88412	he	10304	" The deuce you did ! "
88479	88482	88484	88485	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Rick , "
88487	88594	88484	88485	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" I am glad to have won your confidence . I hope to preserve it . When I contemplated these relations between us four which have so brightened my life and so invested it with new interests and pleasures , I certainly did contemplate , afar off , the possibility of you and your pretty cousin here do n't be shy , Ada , do n't be shy , my dear ! being in a mind to go through life together . I saw , and do see , many reasons to make it desirable . But that was afar off , Rick , afar off ! "
88595	88603	88605	88605	Richard	295	" We look afar off , sir , "
88607	88610	88612	88613	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Well ! "
88615	88839	88612	88613	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" That 's rational . Now , hear me , my dears ! I might tell you that you do n't know your own minds yet , that a thousand things may happen to divert you from one another , that it is well this chain of flowers you have taken up is very easily broken , or it might become a chain of lead . But I will not do that . Such wisdom will come soon enough , I dare say , if it is to come at all . I will assume that a few years hence you will be in your hearts to one another what you are to - day . All I say before speaking to you according to that assumption is , if you DO change - if you DO come to find that you are more commonplace cousins to each other as man and woman than you were as boy and girl your manhood will excuse me , Rick ! - do n't be ashamed still to confide in me , for there will be nothing monstrous or uncommon in it . I am only your friend and distant kinsman . I have no power over you whatever . But I wish and hope to retain your confidence if I do nothing to forfeit it . "
88840	88848	88850	88850	Richard	295	" I am very sure , sir , "
88852	88885	88850	88850	Richard	295	" that I speak for Ada too when I say that you have the strongest power over us both - rooted in respect , gratitude , and affection - strengthening every day . "
88886	88891	88893	88893	Ada	294	" Dear cousin John , "
88899	88927	88893	88893	Ada	294	" my father 's place can never be empty again . All the love and duty I could ever have rendered to him is transferred to you . "
88928	88931	88933	88934	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Come ! "
88936	89104	88933	88934	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Now for our assumption . Now we lift our eyes up and look hopefully at the distance ! Rick , the world is before you ; and it is most probable that as you enter it , so it will receive you . Trust in nothing but in Providence and your own efforts . Never separate the two , like the heathen waggoner . Constancy in love is a good thing , but it means nothing , and is nothing , without constancy in every kind of effort . If you had the abilities of all the great men , past and present , you could do nothing well without sincerely meaning it and setting about it . If you entertain the supposition that any real success , in great things or in small , ever was or could be , ever will or can be , wrested from Fortune by fits and starts , leave that wrong idea here or leave your cousin Ada here . "
89105	89114	89116	89116	Richard	295	" I will leave IT here , sir , "
89119	89149	89116	89116	Richard	295	" if I brought it here just now but I hope I did not , and will work my way on to my cousin Ada in the hopeful distance . "
89150	89153	89155	89156	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Right ! "
89158	89174	89155	89156	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" If you are not to make her happy , why should you pursue her ? "
89175	89191	89193	89193	Richard	295	" I would n't make her unhappy - no , not even for her love , "
89196	89200	89202	89203	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Well said ! "
89205	89274	89275	89275	Ada	294	" That 's well said ! She remains here , in her home with me . Love her , Rick , in your active life , no less than in her home when you revisit it , and all will go well . Otherwise , all will go ill . That 's the end of my preaching . I think you and Ada had better take a walk . "
89467	89474	89483	89483	He	10304	" Am I right , Esther ? "
89497	89523	89529	89529	his	288	" Rick may gain , out of this , the quality he wants . Wants , at the core of so much that is good ! "
89532	89551	89529	89529	his	288	" I have said nothing to Ada , Esther . She has her friend and counsellor always near . "
89584	89588	89590	89590	he	10304	" Tut tut ! "
89592	89616	89590	89590	he	10304	" But we must take care , too , that our little woman 's life is not all consumed in care for others . "
89617	89635	89645	89645	he	10304	" Care ? My dear guardian , I believe I am the happiest creature in the world ! "
89636	89643	89645	89645	he	10304	" I believe so , too , "
89647	89674	89645	89645	he	10304	" But some one may find out what Esther never will - that the little woman is to be held in remembrance above all other people ! "
89935	89954	89956	89956	Richard	295	" And if the suit SHOULD make us rich , Esther - which it may , you know ! "
89968	89973	89975	89975	Richard	295	" My dearest Ada , "
89977	89981	89975	89975	Richard	295	" why not ? "
89982	89992	89994	89994	Ada	294	" It had better declare us poor at once , "
89996	90006	89994	89994	Ada	294	" Oh ! I do n't know about that , "
90010	90036	90008	90008	Richard	295	" but at all events , it wo n't declare anything at once . It has n't declared anything in heaven knows how many years . "
90037	90041	90043	90043	Ada	294	" Too true , "
90045	90050	90052	90052	Richard	295	" Yes , but , "
90064	90094	90052	90052	Richard	295	" the longer it goes on , dear cousin , the nearer it must be to a settlement one way or other . Now , is not that reasonable ? "
90095	90118	90008	90008	Richard	295	" You know best , Richard . But I am afraid if we trust to it , it will make us unhappy . "
90119	90134	90136	90136	Richard	295	" But , my Ada , we are not going to trust to it ! "
90139	90214	90136	90136	Richard	295	" We know it better than to trust to it . We only say that if it SHOULD make us rich , we have no constitutional objection to being rich . The court is , by solemn settlement of law , our grim old guardian , and we are to suppose that what it gives us when it gives us anything is our right . It is not necessary to quarrel with our right . "
90215	90218	90220	90220	Ada	294	" No , "
90222	90234	90220	90220	Ada	294	" but it may be better to forget all about it . "
90235	90240	90242	90242	Richard	295	" Well , well , "
90244	90274	90242	90242	Richard	295	" then we will forget all about it ! We consign the whole thing to oblivion . Dame Durden puts on her approving face , and it 's done ! "
90275	90282	90284	90284	I	0	" Dame Durden 's approving face , "
90299	90326	90284	90284	I	0	" was not very visible when you called it by that name ; but it does approve , and she thinks you ca n't do better . "
90633	90639	90631	90631	he	306	" gone after the sheep . "
90648	90652	90653	90653	she	9768	" The sheep ? "
90957	90963	90947	90947	she	308	" Oh , dear me ! "
90968	90972	90973	90973	Ada	294	" Due east ! "
90997	91054	90990	90990	she	308	" Ma 's compliments , and she hopes you 'll excuse her , because she 's correcting proofs of the plan . She 's going to put out five thousand new circulars , and she knows you 'll be interested to hear that . I have brought one of them with me . Ma 's compliments . "
91063	91067	91069	91070	my guardian	10304	" Thank you , "
91072	91093	91069	91070	my guardian	10304	" I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby . Oh , dear me ! This is a very trying wind ! "
91169	91183	91185	91185	she	308	" We are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn , "
91187	91221	91185	91185	she	308	" I have no peace of my life . Talk of Africa ! I could n't be worse off if I was a what's - his - name - man and a brother ! "
91229	91241	91243	91244	Miss Jellyby	308	" Oh , it 's of no use , Miss Summerson , "
91246	91299	91243	91244	Miss Jellyby	308	" though I thank you for the kind intention all the same . I know how I am used , and I am not to be talked over . YOU would n't be talked over if you were used so . Peepy , go and play at Wild Beasts under the piano ! "
91300	91305	91307	91307	Peepy	306	" I sha n't ! "
91309	91323	91307	91307	Peepy	306	" Very well , you ungrateful , naughty , hard - hearted boy ! "
91333	91345	91330	91330	her	308	" I 'll never take pains to dress you any more . "
91346	91355	91357	91357	Peepy	306	" Yes , I will go , Caddy ! "
91381	91391	91394	91395	Miss Jellyby	308	" It seems a little thing to cry about , "
91398	91458	91394	91395	Miss Jellyby	308	" but I am quite worn out . I was directing the new circulars till two this morning . I detest the whole thing so that that alone makes my head ache till I ca n't see out of my eyes . And look at that poor unfortunate child ! Was there ever such a fright as he is ! "
91497	91510	91512	91513	Miss Jellyby	308	" I have sent him to the other end of the room , "
91521	91583	91516	91516	her	308	" because I do n't want him to hear the conversation . Those little things are so sharp ! I was going to say , we really are going on worse than ever . Pa will be a bankrupt before long , and then I hope Ma will be satisfied . There 'll he nobody but Ma to thank for it . "
91602	91618	91624	91624	her	308	" It 's of no use hoping , though it 's very kind of you , "
91627	91725	91624	91624	her	308	" Pa told me only yesterday morning and dreadfully unhappy he is that he could n't weather the storm . I should be surprised if he could . When all our tradesmen send into our house any stuff they like , and the servants do what they like with it , and I have no time to improve things if I knew how , and Ma do n't care about anything , I should like to make out how Pa is to weather the storm . I declare if I was Pa , I 'd run away . "
91726	91730	91732	91732	I	0	" My dear ! "
91736	91747	91732	91732	I	0	" Your papa , no doubt , considers his family . "
91748	91763	91765	91766	Miss Jellyby	308	" Oh , yes , his family is all very fine , Miss Summerson , "
91768	91825	91765	91766	Miss Jellyby	308	" but what comfort is his family to him ? His family is nothing but bills , dirt , waste , noise , tumbles downstairs , confusion , and wretchedness . His scrambling home , from week 's end to week 's end , is like one great washing - day - only nothing 's washed ! "
91839	91850	91851	91851	she	308	" I am sure I pity Pa to that degree , "
91854	91929	91931	91933	poor Miss Jellyby	308	" and am so angry with Ma that I ca n't find words to express myself ! However , I am not going to bear it , I am determined . I wo n't be a slave all my life , and I wo n't submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale . A pretty thing , indeed , to marry a philanthropist . As if I had n't had enough of THAT ! "
91972	91989	91969	91969	she	2615	" If it was n't that we had been intimate when you stopped at our house , "
91994	92051	92052	92052	She	2615	" I should have been ashamed to come here to - day , for I know what a figure I must seem to you two . But as it is , I made up my mind to call , especially as I am not likely to see you again the next time you come to town . "
92072	92075	92081	92081	her	2615	" No ! "
92084	92111	92081	92081	her	2615	" Not at all likely ! I know I may trust you two . I am sure you wo n't betray me . I am engaged . "
92112	92119	92121	92121	I.	0	" Without their knowledge at home ? "
92122	92132	92133	92133	she	2615	" Why , good gracious me , Miss Summerson , "
92146	92172	92133	92133	she	2615	" how can it be otherwise ? You know what Ma is - and I need n't make poor Pa more miserable by telling HIM . "
92173	92194	92196	92196	I.	0	" But would it not he adding to his unhappiness to marry without his knowledge or consent , my dear ? "
92197	92200	92202	92203	Miss Jellyby	308	" No , "
92207	92256	92202	92203	Miss Jellyby	308	" I hope not . I should try to make him happy and comfortable when he came to see me , and Peepy and the others should take it in turns to come and stay with me , and they should have some care taken of them then . "
92431	92441	92442	92442	she	308	" It began in your coming to our house , "
92450	92458	92459	92459	she	308	" I felt I was so awkward , "
92462	92543	92459	92459	she	308	" that I made up my mind to be improved in that respect at all events and to learn to dance . I told Ma I was ashamed of myself , and I must be taught to dance . Ma looked at me in that provoking way of hers as if I was n't in sight , but I was quite determined to be taught to dance , and so I went to Mr. Turveydrop 's Academy in Newman Street . "
92544	92553	92554	92554	I	0	" And was it there , my dear - "
92557	92564	92566	92566	Caddy	304	" Yes , it was there , "
92568	92624	92566	92566	Caddy	304	" and I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop . There are two Mr. Turveydrops , father and son . My Mr. Turveydrop is the son , of course . I only wish I had been better brought up and was likely to make him a better wife , for I am very fond of him . "
92625	92633	92635	92635	I	0	" I am sorry to hear this , "
92637	92642	92635	92635	I	0	" I must confess . "
92643	92654	92655	92655	she	2620	" I do n't know why you should be sorry , "
92661	92737	92655	92655	she	2620	" but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop , whether or no , and he is very fond of me . It 's a secret as yet , even on his side , because old Mr. Turveydrop has a share in the connexion and it might break his heart or give him some other shock if he was told of it abruptly . Old Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed - very gentlemanly . "
92738	92746	92748	92748	Ada	294	" Does his wife know of it ? "
92750	92760	92762	92763	Miss Jellyby	308	" Old Mr. Turveydrop 's wife , Miss Clare ? "
92769	92781	92766	92766	her	308	" There 's no such person . He is a widower . "
92874	92883	92885	92885	Caddy	304	" That 's the state of the case , "
92887	92948	92950	92950	Caddy	304	" If I ever blame myself , I still think it 's Ma 's fault . We are to be married whenever we can , and then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma . It wo n't much agitate Ma ; I am only pen and ink to HER . One great comfort is , "
92955	92997	92950	92950	Caddy	304	" that I shall never hear of Africa after I am married . Young Mr. Turveydrop hates it for my sake , and if old Mr. Turveydrop knows there is such a place , it 's as much as he does . "
92998	93010	93012	93012	I.	2625	" It was he who was very gentlemanly , I think ! "
93013	93018	93020	93020	Caddy	304	" Very gentlemanly indeed , "
93022	93032	93020	93020	Caddy	304	" He is celebrated almost everywhere for his deportment . "
93033	93038	93040	93040	Ada	294	" Does he teach ? "
93042	93053	93055	93055	Caddy	304	" No , he do n't teach anything in particular , "
93057	93064	93065	93065	Caddy	304	" But his deportment is beautiful . "
93148	93156	93158	93158	Caddy	304	" I go there at other times , "
93160	93331	93333	93333	Caddy	304	" but Prince does not come then . Young Mr. Turveydrop 's name is Prince ; I wish it was n't , because it sounds like a dog , but of course he did n't christen himself . Old Mr. Turveydrop had him christened Prince in remembrance of the Prince Regent . Old Mr. Turveydrop adored the Prince Regent on account of his deportment . I hope you wo n't think the worse of me for having made these little appointments at Miss Flite 's , where I first went with you , because I like the poor thing for her own sake and I believe she likes me . If you could see young Mr. Turveydrop , I am sure you would think well of him - at least , I am sure you could n't possibly think any ill of him . I am going there now for my lesson . I could n't ask you to go with me , Miss Summerson ; but if you would , "
93344	93354	93333	93333	Caddy	304	" I should be very glad - very glad . "
93858	93866	93867	93867	I	0	" Miss Summerson , Mr. Prince Turveydrop ! "
93988	94000	94001	94001	he	2656	" I am very happy to see Miss Jellyby 's friend , "
94009	94015	94001	94001	he	2656	" I began to fear , "
94020	94036	94001	94001	he	2656	" as it was past the usual time , that Miss Jellyby was not coming . "
94037	94064	94066	94066	I.	0	" I beg you will have the goodness to attribute that to me , who have detained her , and to receive my excuses , sir , "
94067	94072	94074	94074	he	2656	" Oh , dear ! "
94076	94080	94081	94081	I	0	" And pray , "
94084	94098	94081	94081	I	0	" do not allow me to be the cause of any more delay . "
94434	94448	94414	94414	he	444	" Father ! A visitor . Miss Jellyby 's friend , Miss Summerson . "
94449	94452	94454	94455	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" Distinguished , "
94457	94464	94454	94455	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" by Miss Summerson 's presence . "
94489	94493	94495	94496	the son	11487	" My father , "
94510	94522	94495	94496	the son	11487	" is a celebrated character . My father is greatly admired . "
94523	94532	94534	94535	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" Go on , Prince ! Go on ! "
94550	94557	94546	94546	his	444	" Go on , my son ! "
94649	94657	94659	94665	the old lady of the censorious countenance	2668	" And he never does anything else , "
94667	94683	94659	94665	the old lady of the censorious countenance	2668	" Yet would you believe that it 's HIS name on the door - plate ? "
94684	94696	94698	94698	I.	2669	" His son 's name is the same , you know , "
94699	94717	94719	94721	the old lady	1406	" He would n't let his son have any name if he could take it from him , "
94723	94731	94719	94721	the old lady	1406	" Look at the son 's dress ! "
94742	94753	94755	94757	the old lady	1406	" Yet the father must be garnished and tricked out , "
94759	94776	94755	94757	the old lady	1406	" because of his deportment . I 'd deport him ! Transport him would be better ! "
94790	94799	94787	94787	I	0	" Does he give lessons in deportment now ? "
94800	94803	94805	94807	the old lady	1406	" Now ! "
94810	94814	94805	94807	the old lady	1406	" Never did . "
94831	94844	94846	94848	the old lady	1406	" I do n't believe he can fence at all , ma'am , "
95178	95186	95192	95192	her	2692	" The airs the fellow gives himself ! "
95219	95255	95257	95259	the old lady	1406	" He fully believes he is one of the aristocracy ! And he is so condescending to the son he so egregiously deludes that you might suppose him the most virtuous of parents . Oh ! "
95267	95273	95257	95259	the old lady	1406	" I could bite you ! "
95448	95456	95457	95457	he	444	" A lady so graceful and accomplished , "
95472	95492	95457	95457	he	444	" will look leniently on the deficiencies here . We do our best to polish - polish - polish ! "
95533	95541	95542	95542	he	444	" To polish - polish - polish ! "
95556	95579	95542	95542	he	444	" But we are not , if I may say so to one formed to be graceful both by Nature and Art - "
95604	95619	95542	95542	he	444	" - we are not what we used to be in point of deportment . "
95620	95627	95629	95629	I.	0	" Are we not , sir ? "
95630	95635	95636	95636	he	444	" We have degenerated , "
95656	95783	95640	95640	his	444	" A levelling age is not favourable to deportment . It develops vulgarity . Perhaps I speak with some little partiality . It may not be for me to say that I have been called , for some years now , Gentleman Turveydrop , or that his Royal Highness the Prince Regent did me the honour to inquire , on my removing my hat as he drove out of the Pavilion at Brighton that fine building , ' Who is he ? Who the devil is he ? Why do n't I know him ? Why has n't he thirty thousand a year ? ' But these are little matters of anecdote - the general property , ma'am - still repeated occasionally among the upper classes . "
95784	95787	95789	95789	I.	2702	" Indeed ? "
95799	95809	95810	95810	he	2703	" Where what is left among us of deportment , "
95859	95860	95857	95857	weavers	2708	" "
95874	95877	95861	95861	One	9864	" said I. "
95883	95894	95895	95895	You	2702	" He smiled with a high - shouldered bow again . "
95939	95940	95941	95941	He	2712	" "
95949	95953	95941	95941	He	2712	" I observed . "
95992	96010	95963	95965	an excellent master	10175	" He took another pinch of snuff and made the bow again , as if to add , "
96019	96048	95963	95965	an excellent master	10175	" I glanced towards the centre of the room , where Miss Jellyby 's lover , now engaged with single pupils , was undergoing greater drudgery than ever . "
96053	96062	95963	95965	an excellent master	10175	" murmured Mr. Turveydrop , adjusting his cravat . "
96068	96071	96063	96063	Your	0	" said I. "
96077	96082	96074	96074	my	0	" said Mr. Turveydrop , "
96115	96124	96112	96113	lovely wooman	2721	" said Mr. Turveydrop with very disagreeable gallantry , "
96131	96200	96201	96201	My	0	" I rose and joined Miss Jellyby , who was by this time putting on her bonnet . The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed , there was a general putting on of bonnets . When Miss Jellyby and the unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I do n't know , but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a dozen words . "
96204	96213	96215	96215	you	9610	" said Mr. Turveydrop benignly to his son , "
96220	96221	96215	96215	you	9610	" "
96226	96255	96215	96215	you	9610	" The son had no watch . The father had a handsome gold one , which he pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind . "
96259	96263	96215	96215	you	9610	" said he , "
96277	96278	96215	96215	you	9610	" "
96288	96292	96286	96286	father	11484	" said Prince . "
96305	96306	96307	96307	My	0	" "
96311	96316	96307	96307	My	0	" returned his father , "
96333	96334	96323	96323	You	9610	" "
96347	96348	96345	96345	father	11484	" "
96357	96374	96354	96354	I	0	" said Mr. Turveydrop , shutting his eyes and lifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness , "
96387	96388	96376	96376	I	0	" "
96397	96402	96403	96405	My dear child	2713	" said his son . "
96431	96432	96418	96418	I	0	" "
96443	96450	96441	96441	father	11484	" said Prince , shaking hands . "
96461	96797	96459	96459	you	11511	" Mr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner , and it seemed to do his son good , who , in parting from him , was so pleased with him , so dutiful to him , and so proud of him that I almost felt as if it were an unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly in the elder . The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking leave of us and particularly of one of us , as I saw , being in the secret , enhanced my favourable impression of his almost childish character . I felt a liking for him and a compassion for him as he put his little kit in his pocket - and with it his desire to stay a little while with Caddy - and went away good - humouredly to his cold mutton and his school at Kensington , that made me scarcely less irate with his father than the censorious old lady . The father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner , I must acknowledge , worthy of his shining original . In the same style he presently passed us on the other side of the street , on his way to the aristocratic part of the town , where he was going to show himself among the few other gentlemen left . For some moments , I was so lost in reconsidering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I was quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to fix my attention on what she said to me , especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether there were , or ever had been , any other gentlemen , not in the dancing profession , who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their deportment . This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility of so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said , "
96816	96903	96904	96904	He	2737	" I accordingly did so , and we chatted all the rest of the way to Lincoln 's Inn . Caddy told me that her lover 's education had been so neglected that it was not always easy to read his notes . She said if he were not so anxious about his spelling and took less pains to make it clear , he would do better ; but he put so many unnecessary letters into short words that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance . "
96912	96916	96904	96904	He	2737	" observed Caddy , "
96929	97012	96923	96923	he	2737	" Caddy then went on to reason , how could he be expected to be a scholar when he had passed his whole life in the dancing - school and had done nothing but teach and fag , fag and teach , morning , noon , and night ! And what did it matter ? She could write letters enough for both , as she knew to her cost , and it was far better for him to be amiable than learned . "
97034	97038	97020	97020	I	0	" said Caddy . "
97052	97068	97070	97070	Caddy	304	" There 's another thing I want to tell you , now we are alone , "
97072	97278	97280	97280	Caddy	304	" which I should not have liked to mention unless you had seen Prince , Miss Summerson . You know what a house ours is . It 's of no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for Prince 's wife to know in OUR house . We live in such a state of muddle that it 's impossible , and I have only been more disheartened whenever I have tried . So I get a little practice with - who do you think ? Poor Miss Flite ! Early in the morning I help her to tidy her room and clean her birds , and I make her cup of coffee for her of course she taught me , and I have learnt to make it so well that Prince says it 's the very best coffee he ever tasted , and would quite delight old Mr. Turveydrop , who is very particular indeed about his coffee . I can make little puddings too ; and I know how to buy neck of mutton , and tea , and sugar , and butter , and a good many housekeeping things . I am not clever at my needle , yet , "
97291	97379	97280	97280	Caddy	304	" but perhaps I shall improve , and since I have been engaged to Prince and have been doing all this , I have felt better - tempered , I hope , and more forgiving to Ma . It rather put me out at first this morning to see you and Miss Clare looking so neat and pretty and to feel ashamed of Peepy and myself too , but on the whole I hope I am better - tempered than I was and more forgiving to Ma . "
97398	97404	97405	97405	I	0	" Caddy , my love , "
97408	97427	97405	97405	I	0	" I begin to have a great affection for you , and I hope we shall become friends . "
97428	97434	97436	97436	Caddy	304	" Oh , do you ? "
97438	97446	97436	97436	Caddy	304	" How happy that would make me ! "
97447	97452	97454	97454	I	0	" My dear Caddy , "
97456	97485	97454	97454	I	0	" let us be friends from this time , and let us often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right way through them . "
97671	97676	97678	97678	Caddy	304	" You look pale , "
97684	97688	97678	97678	Caddy	304	" and cold ! "
97760	97768	97769	97769	he	2756	" I have finished my professional visit , "
97775	97807	97769	97769	he	2756	" Miss Flite is much better and may appear in court as her mind is set upon it to - morrow . She has been greatly missed there , I understand . "
97823	97828	97830	97830	she	381	" Honoured , indeed , "
97832	97857	97830	97830	she	381	" by another visit from the wards in Jarndyce ! Ve - ry happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath my humble roof ! "
97863	97870	97872	97872	she	381	" Fitz - Jarndyce , my dear "
97890	97895	97872	97872	she	381	" a double welcome ! "
97896	97903	97905	97906	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Has she been very ill ? "
97935	97947	97948	97948	she	381	" Oh , decidedly unwell ! Oh , very unwell indeed , "
97952	97974	97948	97948	she	381	" Not pain , you know - trouble . Not bodily so much as nervous , nervous ! The truth is , "
97982	98022	97948	97948	she	381	" we have had death here . There was poison in the house . I am very susceptible to such horrid things . It frightened me . Only Mr. Woodcourt knows how much . My physician , Mr. Woodcourt ! "
98027	98042	98060	98060	he	448	" The wards in Jarndyce - Jarndyce of Bleak House - Fitz - Jarndyce ! "
98043	98047	98049	98050	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" Miss Flite , "
98079	98164	98060	98060	he	448	" Miss Flite describes her illness with her usual accuracy . She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might have alarmed a stronger person , and was made ill by the distress and agitation . She brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery , though too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man . I have compensated myself for that disappointment by coming here since and being of some small use to her . "
98165	98173	98175	98176	Miss Flite	381	" The kindest physician in the college , "
98180	98198	98175	98176	Miss Flite	381	" I expect a judgment . On the day of judgment . And shall then confer estates . "
98199	98211	98213	98214	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" She will be as well in a day or two , "
98224	98248	98213	98214	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" as she ever will be . In other words , quite well of course . Have you heard of her good fortune ? "
98249	98253	98255	98256	Miss Flite	381	" Most extraordinary ! "
98261	98364	98366	98367	Miss Flite	381	" You never heard of such a thing , my dear ! Every Saturday , Conversation Kenge or Guppy clerk to Conversation K. places in my hand a paper of shillings . Shillings . I assure you ! Always the same number in the paper . Always one for every day in the week . Now you know , really ! So well - timed , is it not ? Ye - es ! From whence do these papers come , you say ? That is the great question . Naturally . Shall I tell you what I think ? I think , "
98388	98536	98379	98379	her	381	" that the Lord Chancellor , aware of the length of time during which the Great Seal has been open for it has been open a long time ! , forwards them . Until the judgment I expect is given . Now that 's very creditable , you know . To confess in that way that he IS a little slow for human life . So delicate ! Attending court the other day - I attend it regularly , with my documents - I taxed him with it , and he almost confessed . That is , I smiled at him from my bench , and HE smiled at me from his bench . But it 's great good fortune , is it not ? And Fitz- Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage . Oh , I assure you to the greatest advantage ! "
98601	98613	98615	98615	he	10304	" And what do you call these little fellows , ma'am ? "
98621	98627	98615	98615	he	10304	" Have they any names ? "
98628	98639	98641	98641	I	0	" I can answer for Miss Flite that they have , "
98643	98657	98641	98641	I	0	" for she promised to tell us what they were . Ada remembers ? "
98663	98667	98669	98670	Miss Flite	381	" Did I ? "
98672	98691	98669	98670	Miss Flite	381	" Who 's that at my door ? What are you listening at my door for , Krook ? "
98721	98729	98730	98730	he	10749	" I warn't listening , Miss Flite , "
98733	98751	98730	98730	he	10749	" I was going to give a rap with my knuckles , only you 're so quick ! "
98752	98763	98764	98766	the old lady	1406	" Make your cat go down . Drive her away ! "
98770	98783	98785	98786	Mr. Krook	251	" Bah , bah ! There ai n't no danger , gentlefolks , "
98824	98825	98818	98818	I	0	" "
98832	98842	98843	98843	M	450	" said the old lady with a dignified air . "
98860	98861	98853	98853	Krook	251	" "
98864	98870	98853	98853	Krook	251	" said the old man . "
98878	98879	98875	98876	the Chancellor	813	" "
98882	98887	98875	98876	the Chancellor	813	" returned Miss Elite . "
98892	98893	98875	98876	the Chancellor	813	" "
98898	98907	98895	98896	the Chancellor	813	" said the old man with a chuckle , "
98997	98998	98976	98976	I	0	" "
99004	99016	98976	98976	I	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce which he never did on any consideration . "
99025	99026	99028	99028	you	0	" "
99031	99037	99028	99028	you	0	" returned Krook , grinning . "
99084	99118	99072	99072	you	9569	" The old man had come by little and little into the room until he now touched my guardian with his elbow and looked close up into his face with his spectacled eyes . "
99148	99155	99143	99143	she	2288	" This was in a whisper . "
99164	99187	99157	99157	I	0	" he asked aloud , winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away , affecting to sweep the grate . "
99192	99217	99157	99157	I	0	" she answered hurriedly . The old man , looking up at the cages after another look at us , went through the list . "
99275	99281	99315	99315	his	1443	" said the old man , "
99294	99295	99291	99292	learned brother	2782	" "
99302	99307	99291	99292	learned brother	2782	" muttered my guardian . "
99326	99335	99315	99315	his	1443	" said Krook , winking at us again . "
99339	99347	99315	99315	his	1443	" he added , whispering and grinning , "
99371	99372	99315	99315	his	1443	" "
99382	99398	99399	99399	I	0	" said my guardian , pretending to look out of the window for a weathercock , "
99407	99776	99399	99399	I	0	" We found it very difficult to get away from the house . It was not Miss Flite who detained us ; she was as reasonable a little creature in consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be . It was Mr. Krook . He seemed unable to detach himself from Mr. Jarndyce . If he had been linked to him , he could hardly have attended him more closely . He proposed to show us his Court of Chancery and all the strange medley it contained ; during the whole of our inspection prolonged by himself he kept close to Mr. Jarndyce and sometimes detained him under one pretence or other until we had passed on , as if he were tormented by an inclination to enter upon some secret subject which he could not make up his mind to approach . I can not imagine a countenance and manner more singularly expressive of caution and indecision , and a perpetual impulse to do something he could not resolve to venture on , than Mr. Krook 's was that day . His watchfulness of my guardian was incessant . He rarely removed his eyes from his face . If he went on beside him , he observed him with the slyness of an old white fox . If he went before , he looked back . When we stood still , he got opposite to him , and drawing his hand across and across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of power , and turning up his eyes , and lowering his grey eyebrows until they appeared to be shut , seemed to scan every lineament of his face . At last , having been always attended by the cat all over the house and having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber , which was certainly curious , we came into the back part of the shop . Here on the head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink - bottle , some old stumps of pens , and some dirty playbills ; and against the wall were pasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands . "
99783	99788	99779	99779	you	2786	" asked my guardian . "
99798	99802	99779	99779	you	2786	" said Krook . "
99810	99811	99779	99779	you	2786	" "
99816	99823	99779	99779	you	2786	" returned the old man impatiently . "
99833	99834	99779	99779	you	2786	" "
99846	99851	99843	99844	some one	1103	" said my guardian . "
99861	99875	99876	99876	I	0	" returned the old man with a wonderfully suspicious flash of his eye . "
99904	99905	99891	99891	I	0	" "
99908	99919	99891	99891	I	0	" said my guardian with his good - humoured smile . "
99929	99930	99891	99891	I	0	" "
99942	99960	99936	99937	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" replied the old man , turning up his spectacles on his forehead and rubbing his hands . "
99980	100288	99936	99937	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" These answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian to inquire of Mr. Woodcourt , as we all walked across Lincoln 's Inn together , whether Mr. Krook were really , as his lodger represented him , deranged . The young surgeon replied , no , he had seen no reason to think so . He was exceedingly distrustful , as ignorance usually was , and he was always more or less under the influence of raw gin , of which he drank great quantities and of which he and his back - shop , as we might have observed , smelt strongly ; but he did not think him mad as yet . On our way home , I so conciliated Peepy 's affections by buying him a windmill and two flour - sacks that he would suffer nobody else to take off his hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my side . Caddy sat upon the other side of me , next to Ada , to whom we imparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back . We made much of Caddy , and Peepy too ; and Caddy brightened exceedingly ; and my guardian was as merry as we were ; and we were all very happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney- coach , with Peepy fast asleep , but holding tight to the windmill . I have forgotten to mention - at least I have not mentioned - that Mr. Woodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr. Badger 's . Or that Mr. Jarndyce invited him to dinner that day . Or that he came . Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada , "
100303	101206	100301	100301	Richard	295	" Ada laughed and said - But I do n't think it matters what my darling said . She was always merry . CHAPTER XV Bell Yard While we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly beset by the crowd of excitable ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much astonished us . Mr. Quale , who presented himself soon after our arrival , was in all such excitements . He seemed to project those two shining knobs of temples of his into everything that went on and to brush his hair farther and farther back , until the very roots were almost ready to fly out of his head in inappeasable philanthropy . All objects were alike to him , but he was always particularly ready for anything in the way of a testimonial to any one . His great power seemed to be his power of indiscriminate admiration . He would sit for any length of time , with the utmost enjoyment , bathing his temples in the light of any order of luminary . Having first seen him perfectly swallowed up in admiration of Mrs. Jellyby , I had supposed her to be the absorbing object of his devotion . I soon discovered my mistake and found him to be train - bearer and organ - blower to a whole procession of people . Mrs. Pardiggle came one day for a subscription to something , and with her , Mr. Quale . Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said , Mr. Quale repeated to us ; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out , he drew Mrs. Pardiggle out . Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in behalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher . With Mr. Gusher appeared Mr. Quale again . Mr. Gusher , being a flabby gentleman with a moist surface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they seemed to have been originally made for somebody else , was not at first sight prepossessing ; yet he was scarcely seated before Mr. Quale asked Ada and me , not inaudibly , whether he was not a great creature - which he certainly was , flabbily speaking , though Mr. Quale meant in intellectual beauty - and whether we were not struck by his massive configuration of brow . In short , we heard of a great many missions of various sorts among this set of people , but nothing respecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale 's mission to be in ecstasies with everybody else 's mission and that it was the most popular mission of all . Mr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his heart and his earnest desire to do all the good in his power ; but that he felt it to be too often an unsatisfactory company , where benevolence took spasmodic forms , where charity was assumed as a regular uniform by loud professors and speculators in cheap notoriety , vehement in profession , restless and vain in action , servile in the last degree of meanness to the great , adulatory of one another , and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help the weak from failing rather than with a great deal of bluster and self - laudation to raise them up a little way when they were down , he plainly told us . When a testimonial was originated to Mr. Quale by Mr. Gusher who had already got one , originated by Mr. Quale , and when Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a meeting , including two charity schools of small boys and girls , who were specially reminded of the widow 's mite , and requested to come forward with halfpence and be acceptable sacrifices , I think the wind was in the east for three whole weeks . I mention this because I am coming to Mr. Skimpole again . It seemed to me that his off - hand professions of childishness and carelessness were a great relief to my guardian , by contrast with such things , and were the more readily believed in since to find one perfectly undesigning and candid man among many opposites could not fail to give him pleasure . I should be sorry to imply that Mr. Skimpole divined this and was politic ; I really never understood him well enough to know . What he was to my guardian , he certainly was to the rest of the world . He had not been very well ; and thus , though he lived in London , we had seen nothing of him until now . He appeared one morning in his usual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever . Well , he said , here he was ! He had been bilious , but rich men were often bilious , and therefore he had been persuading himself that he was a man of property . So he was , in a certain point of view - in his expansive intentions . He had been enriching his medical attendant in the most lavish manner . He had always doubled , and sometimes quadrupled , his fees . He had said to the doctor , "
101248	101357	101230	101230	I	0	" And really he said he meant it to that degree that he thought it much the same as doing it . If he had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind attached so much importance to put in the doctor 's hand , he would have put them in the doctor 's hand . Not having them , he substituted the will for the deed . Very well ! If he really meant it - if his will were genuine and real , which it was - it appeared to him that it was the same as coin , and cancelled the obligation . "
101374	101379	101396	101396	he	2794	" said Mr. Skimpole , "
101482	101483	101477	101477	I	0	" "
101488	101495	101496	101496	he	2794	" said my guardian , laughing , "
101510	101511	101496	101496	he	2794	" "
101516	101520	101521	101521	you	288	" he returned , "
101709	101710	101712	101712	he	2801	" "
101718	101723	101712	101712	he	2801	" inquired my guardian . "
101731	101736	101712	101712	he	2801	" said Mr. Skimpole . "
101778	101779	101760	101760	you	2808	" "
101789	101794	101796	101796	I	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce , "
101802	101803	101804	101804	Nature	458	" "
101814	101823	101811	101811	I	0	" observed Mr. Skimpole to Ada and me . "
101866	101947	101948	101948	He	2801	" I should have been surprised if those two could have thought very highly of one another , Mr. Boythorn attaching so much importance to many things and Mr. Skimpole caring so little for anything . Besides which , I had noticed Mr. Boythorn more than once on the point of breaking out into some strong opinion when Mr. Skimpole was referred to . Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly pleased with him . "
101953	101958	101948	101948	He	2801	" said Mr. Skimpole ; "
102038	102064	102035	102036	Miss Summerson	283	" He asked me as the subject arose in his mind , in his graceful , light - hearted manner and without the least embarrassment . "
102069	102072	102035	102036	Miss Summerson	283	" said I. "
102082	102087	102088	102088	He	327	" said Mr. Skimpole . "
102099	102134	102088	102088	He	327	" It quite shocked me to hear it , for I had already recalled with anything but a serious association the image of the man sitting on the sofa that night wiping his head . "
102143	102148	102135	102136	His successor	2820	" said Mr. Skimpole . "
102219	102238	102240	102240	he	2820	" Mr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant absurdity and lightly touched the piano by which he was seated . "
102244	102258	102240	102240	he	2820	" he said , playing little chords where I shall put full stops , "
102289	102371	102372	102372	I	0	" Mr. Jarndyce got up , rubbing his head , and began to walk about . Mr. Skimpole played the melody of one of Ada 's favourite songs . Ada and I both looked at Mr. Jarndyce , thinking that we knew what was passing in his mind . After walking and stopping , and several times leaving off rubbing his head , and beginning again , my guardian put his hand upon the keys and stopped Mr. Skimpole 's playing . "
102380	102399	102372	102372	I	0	" he said thoughtfully . Mr. Skimpole , who had quite forgotten the subject , looked up surprised . "
102405	102452	102400	102401	The man	9972	" pursued my guardian , walking backward and forward in the very short space between the piano and the end of the room and rubbing his hair up from the back of his head as if a high east wind had blown it into that form . "
102508	102509	102512	102512	Coavinses	327	" "
102514	102526	102512	102512	Coavinses	327	" cried Mr. Skimpole , at length perceiving what he meant . "
102545	102560	102542	102542	you	2834	" Mr. Jarndyce nodded to us , who were only waiting for the signal . "
102581	102683	102686	102686	you	2836	" We were quickly ready and went out . Mr. Skimpole went with us and quite enjoyed the expedition . It was so new and so refreshing , he said , for him to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him ! He took us , first , to Cursitor Street , Chancery Lane , where there was a house with barred windows , which he called Coavinses ' Castle . On our going into the entry and ringing a bell , a very hideous boy came out of a sort of office and looked at us over a spiked wicket . "
102689	102703	102686	102686	you	2836	" said the boy , fitting two of the spikes into his chin . "
102718	102723	102706	102707	a follower	2837	" said Mr. Jarndyce , "
102728	102729	102706	102707	a follower	2837	" "
102732	102737	102706	102707	a follower	2837	" said the boy . "
102740	102741	102742	102742	I	0	" "
102753	102754	102742	102742	I	0	" "
102759	102764	102757	102757	Neckett	459	" said the boy . "
102769	102770	102766	102766	his	2839	" "
102774	102779	102780	102780	Chandler	460	" said the boy . "
102792	102793	102795	102795	he	2839	" "
102807	102812	102795	102795	he	2839	" murmured my guardian , "
102815	102816	102795	102795	he	2839	" "
102820	102825	102818	102818	Neckett	459	" said the boy . "
102863	102864	102865	102865	He	2839	" "
102871	102878	102879	102879	He	2839	" I heard my guardian soliloquize . "
102900	102997	102998	102998	Neckett	459	" We left the boy , with his head on one side and his arms on the gate , fondling and sucking the spikes , and went back to Lincoln 's Inn , where Mr. Skimpole , who had not cared to remain nearer Coavinses , awaited us . Then we all went to Bell Yard , a narrow alley at a very short distance . We soon found the chandler 's shop . In it was a good - natured - looking old woman with a dropsy , or an asthma , or perhaps both . "
103002	103011	102998	102998	Neckett	459	" said she in reply to my inquiry . "
103031	103141	103016	103016	miss	9656	" And she handed me the key across the counter . I glanced at the key and glanced at her , but she took it for granted that I knew what to do with it . As it could only be intended for the children 's door , I came out without asking any more questions and led the way up the dark stairs . We went as quietly as we could , but four of us made some noise on the aged boards , and when we came to the second story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there looking out of his room . "
103149	103163	103144	103144	Gridley	462	" he said , fixing his eyes on me with an angry stare . "
103168	103172	103166	103166	sir	9569	" said I ; "
103179	103218	103173	103173	I	0	" He looked at Ada , and at Mr. Jarndyce , and at Mr. Skimpole , fixing the same angry stare on each in succession as they passed and followed me . Mr. Jarndyce gave him good day . "
103222	103348	103349	103349	We	2847	" he said abruptly and fiercely . He was a tall , sallow man with a careworn head on which but little hair remained , a deeply lined face , and prominent eyes . He had a combative look and a chafing , irritable manner which , associated with his figure - still large and powerful , though evidently in its decline - rather alarmed me . He had a pen in his hand , and in the glimpse I caught of his room in passing , I saw that it was covered with a litter of papers . Leaving him standing there , we went up to the top room . I tapped at the door , and a little shrill voice inside said , "
103361	103477	103354	103355	Mrs. Blinder	461	" I applied the key on hearing this and opened the door . In a poor room with a sloping ceiling and containing very little furniture was a mite of a boy , some five or six years old , nursing and hushing a heavy child of eighteen months . There was no fire , though the weather was cold ; both children were wrapped in some poor shawls and tippets as a substitute . Their clothing was not so warm , however , but that their noses looked red and pinched and their small figures shrunken as the boy walked up and down nursing and hushing the child with its head on his shoulder . "
103486	103491	103492	103492	Charley	327	" we naturally asked . "
103494	103506	103492	103492	Charley	327	" said the boy , standing still to gaze at us . "
103512	103513	103508	103508	Charley	327	" "
103528	103529	103526	103526	Charley	327	" "
103539	103540	103541	103541	Me	0	" "
103543	103548	103550	103550	Emma	465	" said the boy , "
103552	103564	103566	103566	Charley	327	" patting the limp bonnet of the child he was nursing . "
103568	103569	103566	103566	Charley	327	" "
103575	103576	103572	103572	Charley	327	" "
103582	103785	103572	103572	Charley	327	" said the boy , beginning to walk up and down again and taking the nankeen bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to gaze at us at the same time . We were looking at one another and at these two children when there came into the room a very little girl , childish in figure but shrewd and older - looking in the face - pretty - faced too - wearing a womanly sort of bonnet much too large for her and drying her bare arms on a womanly sort of apron . Her fingers were white and wrinkled with washing , and the soap - suds were yet smoking which she wiped off her arms . But for this , she might have been a child playing at washing and imitating a poor working - woman with a quick observation of the truth . She had come running from some place in the neighbourhood and had made all the haste she could . Consequently , though she was very light , she was out of breath and could not speak at first , as she stood panting , and wiping her arms , and looking quietly at us . "
103792	103850	103790	103790	Charley	327	" said the boy . The child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be taken by Charley . The little girl took it , in a womanly sort of manner belonging to the apron and the bonnet , and stood looking at us over the burden that clung to her most affectionately . "
103855	103890	103790	103790	Charley	327	" whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the little creature and got her to sit down with her load , the boy keeping close to her , holding to her apron , "
103912	103960	103961	103961	Charley	327	" It was a thing to look at . The three children close together , and two of them relying solely on the third , and the third so young and yet with an air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the childish figure . "
103965	103970	103963	103963	Charley	327	" said my guardian . "
103976	103977	103974	103974	you	327	" "
103983	103988	103981	103981	sir	9569	" replied the child . "
103996	104001	103981	103981	sir	9569	" said my guardian . "
104009	104033	104007	104007	Charley	327	" I can not describe the tenderness with which he spoke to her , half playfully yet all the more compassionately and mournfully . "
104046	104051	104054	104054	sir	9569	" said my guardian . "
104056	104075	104054	104054	sir	9569	" returned the child , looking up into his face with perfect confidence , ' since father died . "
104076	104089	104091	104092	my guardian	10304	" And how do you live , Charley ? Oh ! Charley , "
104102	104108	104091	104092	my guardian	10304	" how do you live ? "
104109	104131	104054	104054	sir	9569	" Since father died , sir , I 've gone out to work . I 'm out washing to - day . "
104132	104139	104141	104142	my guardian	10304	" God help you , Charley ! "
104144	104155	104141	104142	my guardian	10304	" You 're not tall enough to reach the tub ! "
104156	104164	104165	104165	she	10304	" In pattens I am , sir , "
104169	104181	104165	104165	she	10304	" I 've got a high pair as belonged to mother . "
104182	104192	104141	104142	my guardian	10304	" And when did mother die ? Poor mother ! "
104193	104202	104204	104205	the child	9608	" Mother died just after Emma was born , "
104215	104277	104204	104205	the child	9608	" Then father said I was to be as good a mother to her as I could . And so I tried . And so I worked at home and did cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began to go out . And that 's how I know how ; do n't you see , sir ? "
104278	104286	104141	104142	my guardian	10304	" And do you often go out ? "
104287	104294	104296	104296	Charley	327	" As often as I can , "
104304	104312	104296	104296	Charley	327	" because of earning sixpences and shillings ! "
104313	104327	104141	104142	my guardian	10304	" And do you always lock the babies up when you go out ? "
104328	104341	104343	104343	Charley	327	" To keep 'em safe , sir , do n't you see ? "
104345	104390	104343	104343	Charley	327	" Mrs. Blinder comes up now and then , and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes , and perhaps I can run in sometimes , and they can play you know , and Tom an't afraid of being locked up , are you , Tom ? "
104391	104396	104398	104398	Tom	411	" No - o ! "
104401	104435	104398	104398	Tom	411	" When it comes on dark , the lamps are lighted down in the court , and they show up here quite bright - almost quite bright . Do n't they , Tom ? "
104436	104441	104443	104443	Tom	411	" Yes , Charley , "
104445	104450	104443	104443	Tom	411	" almost quite bright . "
104451	104460	104462	104464	the little creature	11724	" Then he 's as good as gold , "
104476	104532	104398	104398	Tom	411	" And when Emma 's tired , he puts her to bed . And when he 's tired he goes to bed himself . And when I come home and light the candle and has a bit of supper , he sits up again and has it with me . Do n't you , Tom ? "
104533	104540	104542	104542	Tom	411	" Oh , yes , Charley ! "
104544	104549	104542	104542	Tom	411	" That I do ! "
104776	104789	104790	104790	she	461	" It 's not much to forgive 'em the rent , sir , "
104793	104801	104790	104790	she	461	" who could take it from them ! "
104802	104807	104809	104810	my guardian	10304	" Well , well ! "
104815	104851	104852	104852	he	10304	" It is enough that the time will come when this good woman will find that it WAS much , and that forasmuch as she did it unto the least of these - This child , "
104859	104866	104852	104852	he	10304	" could she possibly continue this ? "
104867	104877	104879	104880	Mrs. Blinder	461	" Really , sir , I think she might , "
104890	105000	104879	104880	Mrs. Blinder	461	" She 's as handy as it 's possible to be . Bless you , sir , the way she tended them two children after the mother died was the talk of the yard ! And it was a wonder to see her with him after he was took ill , it really was ! ' Mrs. Blinder , ' he said to me the very last he spoke - he was lying there - ' Mrs. Blinder , whatever my calling may have been , I see a angel sitting in this room last night along with my child , and I trust her to Our Father ! ' "
105001	105008	105010	105011	my guardian	10304	" He had no other calling ? "
105013	105018	105010	105011	my guardian	10304	" No , sir , "
105023	105084	105086	105087	Mrs. Blinder	461	" he was nothing but a follerers . When he first came to lodge here , I did n't know what he was , and I confess that when I found out I gave him notice . It was n't liked in the yard . It was n't approved by the other lodgers . It is NOT a genteel calling , "
105089	105121	105086	105087	Mrs. Blinder	461	" and most people do object to it . Mr. Gridley objected to it very strong , and he is a good lodger , though his temper has been hard tried . "
105122	105129	105131	105132	my guardian	10304	" So you gave him notice ? "
105134	105141	105143	105144	Mrs. Blinder	461	" So I gave him notice , "
105146	105184	105186	105187	Mrs. Blinder	461	" But really when the time came , and I knew no other ill of him , I was in doubts . He was punctual and diligent ; he did what he had to do , sir , "
105197	105210	105194	105194	her	461	" and it 's something in this world even to do that . "
105211	105219	105131	105132	my guardian	10304	" So you kept him after all ? "
105220	105296	105194	105194	her	461	" Why , I said that if he could arrange with Mr. Gridley , I could arrange it with the other lodgers and should not so much mind its being liked or disliked in the yard . Mr. Gridley gave his consent gruff - but gave it . He was always gruff with him , but he has been kind to the children since . A person is never known till a person is proved . "
105297	105307	105309	105310	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Have many people been kind to the children ? "
105312	105323	105325	105326	Mrs. Blinder	461	" Upon the whole , not so bad , sir , "
105328	105506	105325	105326	Mrs. Blinder	461	" but certainly not so many as would have been if their father 's calling had been different . Mr. Coavins gave a guinea , and the follerers made up a little purse . Some neighbours in the yard that had always joked and tapped their shoulders when he went by came forward with a little subscription , and - in general - not so bad . Similarly with Charlotte . Some people wo n't employ her because she was a follerer 's child ; some people that do employ her cast it at her ; some make a merit of having her to work for them , with that and all her draw - backs upon her , and perhaps pay her less and put upon her more . But she 's patienter than others would be , and is clever too , and always willing , up to the full mark of her strength and over . So I should say , in general , not so bad , sir , but might be better . "
105573	105589	105590	105590	he	288	" I do n't know what you may be doing here , ladies and gentlemen , "
105600	105642	105590	105590	he	288	" but you 'll excuse my coming in . I do n't come in to stare about me . Well , Charley ! Well , Tom ! Well , little one ! How is it with us all to - day ? "
105691	105705	105706	105706	he	288	" No one , surely , would come here to stare about him , "
105710	105721	105723	105724	the other	10506	" May be so , sir , may be so , "
105737	105762	105723	105724	the other	10506	" I do n't want to argue with ladies and gentlemen . I have had enough of arguing to last one man his life . "
105763	105773	105775	105776	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" You have sufficient reason , I dare say , "
105778	105785	105775	105776	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" for being chafed and irritated - "
105786	105790	105792	105793	the man	9972	" There again ! "
105799	105816	105792	105793	the man	9972	" I am of a quarrelsome temper . I am irascible . I am not polite ! "
105817	105824	105775	105776	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Not very , I think . "
105825	105828	105830	105830	Gridley	462	" Sir , "
105849	105859	105843	105843	he	462	" do you know anything of Courts of Equity ? "
105860	105869	105775	105776	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Perhaps I do , to my sorrow . "
105870	105875	105877	105878	the man	9972	" To your sorrow ? "
105885	105909	105877	105878	the man	9972	" if so , I beg your pardon . I am not polite , I know . I beg your pardon ! Sir , "
105914	105981	105982	105982	he	9972	" I have been dragged for five and twenty years over burning iron , and I have lost the habit of treading upon velvet . Go into the Court of Chancery yonder and ask what is one of the standing jokes that brighten up their business sometimes , and they will tell you that the best joke they have is the man from Shropshire . I , "
105993	106000	105982	105982	he	9972	" am the man from Shropshire . "
106001	106023	106025	106026	my guardian	10304	" I believe I and my family have also had the honour of furnishing some entertainment in the same grave place , "
106029	106039	106025	106026	my guardian	10304	" You may have heard my name - Jarndyce . "
106040	106044	106046	106046	Gridley	462	" Mr. Jarndyce , "
106054	106150	106151	106151	he	2889	" you bear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine . More than that , I tell you - and I tell this gentleman , and these young ladies , if they are friends of yours - that if I took my wrongs in any other way , I should be driven mad ! It is only by resenting them , and by revenging them in my mind , and by angrily demanding the justice I never get , that I am able to keep my wits together . It is only that ! "
106166	106238	106151	106151	he	2889	" You may tell me that I over - excite myself . I answer that it 's in my nature to do it , under wrong , and I must do it . There 's nothing between doing it , and sinking into the smiling state of the poor little mad woman that haunts the court . If I was once to sit down under it , I should become imbecile . "
106275	106279	106280	106280	he	2889	" Mr. Jarndyce , "
106283	106705	106280	106280	he	2889	" consider my case . As true as there is a heaven above us , this is my case . I am one of two brothers . My father a farmer made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my mother for her life . After my mother 's death , all was to come to me except a legacy of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my brother . My mother died . My brother some time afterwards claimed his legacy . I and some of my relations said that he had had a part of it already in board and lodging and some other things . Now mind ! That was the question , and nothing else . No one disputed the will ; no one disputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had been already paid or not . To settle that question , my brother filing a bill , I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery ; I was forced there because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else . Seventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit ! It first came on after two years . It was then stopped for another two years while the master may his head rot off ! inquired whether I was my father 's son , about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal creature . He then found out that there were not defendants enough - remember , there were only seventeen as yet ! - but that we must have another who had been left out and must begin all over again . The costs at that time - before the thing was begun ! - were three times the legacy . My brother would have given up the legacy , and joyful , to escape more costs . My whole estate , left to me in that will of my father 's , has gone in costs . The suit , still undecided , has fallen into rack , and ruin , and despair , with everything else - and here I stand , this day ! Now , Mr. Jarndyce , in your suit there are thousands and thousands involved , where in mine there are hundreds . Is mine less hard to bear or is it harder to bear , when my whole living was in it and has been thus shamefully sucked away ? "
106735	106739	106741	106742	Mr. Gridley	462	" There again ! "
106750	106982	106747	106747	his	462	" The system ! I am told on all hands , it 's the system . I must n't look to individuals . It 's the system . I must n't go into court and say , ' My Lord , I beg to know this from you - is this right or wrong ? Have you the face to tell me I have received justice and therefore am dismissed ? ' My Lord knows nothing of it . He sits there to administer the system . I must n't go to Mr. Tulkinghorn , the solicitor in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , and say to him when he makes me furious by being so cool and satisfied - as they all do , for I know they gain by it while I lose , do n't I ? - I must n't say to him , ' I will have something out of some one for my ruin , by fair means or foul ! ' HE is not responsible . It 's the system . But , if I do no violence to any of them , here - I may ! I do n't know what may happen if I am carried beyond myself at last ! I will accuse the individual workers of that system against me , face to face , before the great eternal bar ! "
107000	107005	107006	107006	he	2890	" I have done ! "
107016	107290	107291	107291	he	2891	" Mr. Jarndyce , I have done ! I am violent , I know . I ought to know it . I have been in prison for contempt of court . I have been in prison for threatening the solicitor . I have been in this trouble , and that trouble , and shall be again . I am the man from Shropshire , and I sometimes go beyond amusing them , though they have found it amusing , too , to see me committed into custody and brought up in custody and all that . It would be better for me , they tell me , if I restrained myself . I tell them that if I did restrain myself I should become imbecile . I was a good - enough - tempered man once , I believe . People in my part of the country say they remember me so , but now I must have this vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits together . It would be far better for you , Mr. Gridley , ' the Lord Chancellor told me last week , ' not to waste your time here , and to stay , usefully employed , down in Shropshire . ' ' My Lord , my Lord , I know it would , ' said I to him , ' and it would have been far better for me never to have heard the name of your high office , but unhappily for me , I ca n't undo the past , and the past drives me here ! ' Besides , "
107298	107375	107291	107291	he	2891	" I 'll shame them . To the last , I 'll show myself in that court to its shame . If I knew when I was going to die , and could be carried there , and had a voice to speak with , I would die there , saying , ' You have brought me here and sent me from here many and many a time . Now send me out feet foremost ! ' "
107404	107419	107420	107420	he	2891	" I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour , "
107428	107463	107420	107420	he	2891	" and let them play about . I did n't mean to say all this , but it do n't much signify . You 're not afraid of me , Tom , are you ? "
107464	107467	107469	107469	Tom	411	" No ! "
107471	107479	107420	107420	he	2891	" You ai n't angry with ME . "
107480	107503	107504	107504	He	2891	" You are right , my child . You 're going back , Charley ? Aye ? Come then , little one ! "
107522	107545	107546	107546	He	2891	" I should n't wonder if we found a ginger - bread soldier downstairs . Let 's go and look for him ! "
107856	107872	107841	107841	he	462	" What does the Commander of the Faithful require at the hands of his slave ? "
107884	107890	107873	107873	he	2910	" The head of Coavinses ! "
107975	107992	107966	107966	he	462	" I was the great patron of Coavinses , and his little comforts were MY work ! "

108498	108545	108495	108495	he	268	" We have all yielded to this ; it belongs to us ; it has for some hundreds of years been understood that we are not to make the vaults in the park interesting on more ignoble terms ; and I submit myself to the compromise . "
108669	108704	108707	108707	their	2948	" Each of us was a passing reality here and left this coloured shadow of himself and melted into remembrance as dreamy as the distant voices of the rooks now lulling you to rest , "

110929	110950	110952	110952	Jo	396	" I do n't know nothink about no - where I was took by the beadle , do you mean ? "
110954	110965	110952	110952	Jo	396	" Was the boy 's name at the inkwhich Jo ? "
110966	110969	110895	110895	Jo	396	" Yes . "
110970	110975	110977	110977	Jo	396	" That 's me ! "
110979	110984	110977	110977	Jo	396	" Come farther up . "
110985	110992	110994	110994	Jo	396	" You mean about the man ? "
110998	111004	110994	110994	Jo	396	" Him as wos dead ? "
111005	111030	110977	110977	Jo	396	" Hush ! Speak in a whisper ! Yes . Did he look , when he was living , so very ill and poor ? "
111031	111036	111038	111038	Jo	396	" Oh , jist ! "
111040	111050	111052	111053	the woman	10391	" Did he look like - not like YOU ? "
111057	111066	111068	111068	Jo	396	" Oh , not so bad as me , "
111070	111088	111068	111068	Jo	396	" I 'm a reg'lar one I am ! You did n't know him , did you ? "

111168	111241	111242	111242	Jo	396	" Listen and be silent . Do n't talk to me , and stand farther from me ! Can you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I read ? The place he wrote for , the place he died at , the place where you were taken to , and the place where he was buried ? Do you know the place where he was buried ? "
111258	111304	111305	111305	Jo	396	" Go before me and show me all those dreadful places . Stop opposite to each , and do n't speak to me unless I speak to you . Do n't look back . Do what I want , and I will pay you well . "

111535	111540	111541	111541	Jo	396	" HE lived here , "

111559	111600	111521	111521	Jo	396	" In the back room up there . You can see the winder from this corner . Up there ! That 's where I see him stritched out . This is the public - ouse where I was took to . "
111601	111608	111521	111521	Jo	396	" Go on to the next ! "
111677	111683	111685	111685	Jo	396	" He was put there , "
111695	111706	111685	111685	Jo	396	" Where ? Oh , what a scene of horror ! "
111707	111710	111712	111712	Jo	396	" There ! "
111716	111779	111712	111712	Jo	396	" Over yinder . Among them piles of bones , and close to that there kitchin winder ! They put him wery nigh the top . They was obliged to stamp upon it to git it in . I could unkiver it for you with my broom if the gate was open . That 's why they locks it , I s'pose , "
111785	111796	111798	111798	Jo	396	" It 's always locked . Look at the rat ! "
111802	111817	111798	111798	Jo	396	" Hi ! Look ! There he goes ! Ho ! Into the ground ! "

111972	112000	111964	111964	Jo	396	" It an't done it much good if it is . Blest ? I should think it was t'othered myself . But I do n't know nothink ! "

At length , looking aside to see if he has made himself intelligible , he finds that he is alone . His first proceeding is to hold the piece of money to the gas - light and to be overpowered at finding that it is yellow - gold . His next is to give it a one - sided bite at the edge as a test of its quality . His next , to put it in his mouth for safety and to sweep the step and passage with great care . His job done , he sets off for Tom - all - Alone 's , stopping in the light of innumerable gas - lamps to produce the piece of gold and give it another one - sided bite as a reassurance of its being genuine .

112401	112754	112757	112758	Mr. Carstone	295	" CHAPTER XVII Esther 's Narrative Richard very often came to see us while we remained in London though he soon failed in his letter - writing , and with his quick abilities , his good spirits , his good temper , his gaiety and freshness , was always delightful . But though I liked him more and more the better I knew him , I still felt more and more how much it was to be regretted that he had been educated in no habits of application and concentration . The system which had addressed him in exactly the same manner as it had addressed hundreds of other boys , all varying in character and capacity , had enabled him to dash through his tasks , always with fair credit and often with distinction , but in a fitful , dazzling way that had confirmed his reliance on those very qualities in himself which it had been most desirable to direct and train . They were good qualities , without which no high place can be meritoriously won , but like fire and water , though excellent servants , they were very bad masters . If they had been under Richard 's direction , they would have been his friends ; but Richard being under their direction , they became his enemies . I write down these opinions not because I believe that this or any other thing was so because I thought so , but only because I did think so and I want to be quite candid about all I thought and did . These were my thoughts about Richard . I thought I often observed besides how right my guardian was in what he had said , and that the uncertainties and delays of the Chancery suit had imparted to his nature something of the careless spirit of a gamester who felt that he was part of a great gaming system . Mr. and Mrs. Bayham Badger coming one afternoon when my guardian was not at home , in the course of conversation I naturally inquired after Richard . "
112760	112765	112757	112758	Mr. Carstone	295	" said Mrs. Badger , "
112874	112892	112861	112861	I	0	" I said no , as Mrs. Badger 's insinuating tone seemed to require such an answer . "
112897	112914	112894	112895	Miss Clare	294	" said Mrs. Bayham Badger sweetly . Ada said no , too , and looked uneasy . "
112923	112928	112930	112930	you	295	" said Mrs. Badger , "
112939	112949	112930	112930	you	295	" We entreated Mrs. Badger not to mention it . "
112965	113000	112956	112956	I	0	" pursued Mrs. Badger , ' so perfectly charming . You see , my dears , that although I am still young - or Mr. Bayham Badger pays me the compliment of saying so - "
113001	113004	113005	113006	Mr. Badger	434	" No , "
113018	113023	113005	113006	Mr. Badger	434	" Not at all ! "
113024	113028	113030	113031	Mrs. Badger	435	" Very well , "
113033	113040	113030	113031	Mrs. Badger	435	" we will say still young . "
113041	113044	113046	113047	Mr. Badger	434	" Undoubtedly , "
113049	113170	113046	113047	Mr. Badger	434	" My dears , though still young , I have had many opportunities of observing young men . There were many such on board the dear old Crippler , I assure you . After that , when I was with Captain Swosser in the Mediterranean , I embraced every opportunity of knowing and befriending the midshipmen under Captain Swosser 's command . YOU never heard them called the young gentlemen , my dears , and probably would not understand allusions to their pipe - claying their weekly accounts , but it is otherwise with me , for blue water has been a second home to me , and I have been quite a sailor . Again , with Professor Dingo . "
113171	113178	113180	113181	Mr. Badger	434	" A man of European reputation , "
113183	113199	113201	113202	Mrs. Badger	435	" When I lost my dear first and became the wife of my dear second , "
113218	113309	113201	113202	Mrs. Badger	435	" I still enjoyed opportunities of observing youth . The class attendant on Professor Dingo 's lectures was a large one , and it became my pride , as the wife of an eminent scientific man seeking herself in science the utmost consolation it could impart , to throw our house open to the students as a kind of Scientific Exchange . Every Tuesday evening there was lemonade and a mixed biscuit for all who chose to partake of those refreshments . And there was science to an unlimited extent . "
113310	113318	113320	113321	Mr. Badger	434	" Remarkable assemblies those , Miss Summerson , "
113324	113343	113320	113321	Mr. Badger	434	" There must have been great intellectual friction going on there under the auspices of such a man ! "
113344	113348	113350	113351	Mrs. Badger	435	" And now , "
113353	113435	113350	113351	Mrs. Badger	435	" now that I am the wife of my dear third , Mr. Badger , I still pursue those habits of observation which were formed during the lifetime of Captain Swosser and adapted to new and unexpected purposes during the lifetime of Professor Dingo . I therefore have not come to the consideration of Mr. Carstone as a neophyte . And yet I am very much of the opinion , my dears , that he has not chosen his profession advisedly . "
113454	113460	113461	113461	she	435	" My dear Miss Summerson , "
113464	113611	113461	113461	she	435	" on Mr. Carstone 's character and conduct . He is of such a very easy disposition that probably he would never think it worth - while to mention how he really feels , but he feels languid about the profession . He has not that positive interest in it which makes it his vocation . If he has any decided impression in reference to it , I should say it was that it is a tiresome pursuit . Now , this is not promising . Young men like Mr. Allan Woodcourt who take it from a strong interest in all that it can do will find some reward in it through a great deal of work for a very little money and through years of considerable endurance and disappointment . But I am quite convinced that this would never be the case with Mr. Carstone . "
113612	113620	113622	113622	Ada	294	" Does Mr. Badger think so too ? "
113625	113628	113630	113631	Mr. Badger	434	" Why , "
113633	113739	113630	113631	Mr. Badger	434	" to tell the truth , Miss Clare , this view of the matter had not occurred to me until Mrs. Badger mentioned it . But when Mrs. Badger put it in that light , I naturally gave great consideration to it , knowing that Mrs. Badger 's mind , in addition to its natural advantages , has had the rare advantage of being formed by two such very distinguished I will even say illustrious public men as Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy and Professor Dingo . The conclusion at which I have arrived is - in short , is Mrs. Badger 's conclusion . "
113740	113750	113752	113753	Mrs. Badger	435	" It was a maxim of Captain Swosser 's , "
113821	113826	113828	113829	Mr. Badger	434	" To all professions , "
113831	113843	113828	113829	Mr. Badger	434	" It was admirably said by Captain Swosser . Beautifully said . "
113844	113863	113865	113866	Mrs. Badger	435	" People objected to Professor Dingo when we were staying in the north of Devon after our marriage , "
113868	113917	113865	113866	Mrs. Badger	435	" that he disfigured some of the houses and other buildings by chipping off fragments of those edifices with his little geological hammer . But the professor replied that he knew of no building save the Temple of Science . The principle is the same , I think ? "
113918	113923	113925	113926	Mr. Badger	434	" Precisely the same , "
113928	113974	113925	113926	Mr. Badger	434	" Finely expressed ! The professor made the same remark , Miss Summerson , in his last illness , when his mind wandering he insisted on keeping his little hammer under the pillow and chipping at the countenances of the attendants . The ruling passion ! "
114092	114102	114078	114078	she	294	" And how do you get on , Richard ? "
114124	114130	114132	114132	Richard	295	" Oh ! Well enough ! "
114134	114148	114150	114151	my pet	1289	" He ca n't say better than that , Esther , can he ? "
114173	114177	114178	114178	I	0	" Well enough ? "
114181	114184	114186	114186	Richard	295	" Yes , "
114188	114211	114186	114186	Richard	295	" well enough . It 's rather jog - trotty and humdrum . But it 'll do as well as anything else ! "
114212	114219	114220	114220	I	0	" Oh ! My dear Richard ! "
114223	114229	114231	114231	Richard	295	" What 's the matter ? "
114233	114241	114231	114231	Richard	295	" Do as well as anything else ! "
114242	114257	114259	114259	Ada	294	" I do n't think there 's any harm in that , Dame Durden , "
114269	114290	114259	114259	Ada	294	" because if it will do as well as anything else , it will do very well , I hope . "
114291	114300	114302	114302	Richard	295	" Oh , yes , I hope so , "
114312	114361	114362	114362	Ada	294	" After all , it may be only a kind of probation till our suit is - I forgot though . I am not to mention the suit . Forbidden ground ! Oh , yes , it 's all right enough . Let us talk about something else . "
114402	114408	114410	114410	I	0	" No , but Richard , "
114412	114474	114410	114410	I	0	" and my dear Ada ! Consider how important it is to you both , and what a point of honour it is towards your cousin , that you , Richard , should be quite in earnest without any reservation . I think we had better talk about this , really , Ada . It will be too late very soon . "
114475	114486	114488	114488	Ada	294	" Oh , yes ! We must talk about it ! "
114490	114498	114488	114488	Ada	294	" But I think Richard is right . "
114525	114536	114538	114538	I	0	" Mr. and Mrs. Badger were here yesterday , Richard , "
114540	114557	114538	114538	I	0	" and they seemed disposed to think that you had no great liking for the profession . "
114558	114563	114565	114565	Richard	295	" Did they though ? "
114567	114630	114565	114565	Richard	295	" Oh ! Well , that rather alters the case , because I had no idea that they thought so , and I should not have liked to disappoint or inconvenience them . The fact is , I do n't care much about it . But , oh , it do n't matter ! It 'll do as well as anything else ! "
114631	114638	114640	114640	I.	0	" You hear him , Ada ! "
114641	114646	114640	114640	I.	0	" The fact is , "
114656	114686	114647	114647	Richard	295	" it is not quite in my way . I do n't take to it . And I get too much of Mrs. Bayham Badger 's first and second . "
114687	114696	114698	114698	Ada	294	" I am sure THAT 'S very natural ! "
114703	114714	114698	114698	Ada	294	" The very thing we both said yesterday , Esther ! "
114715	114718	114720	114720	Richard	295	" Then , "
114722	114747	114720	114720	Richard	295	" it 's monotonous , and to - day is too like yesterday , and to - morrow is too like to - day . "
114748	114754	114756	114756	I	0	" But I am afraid , "
114758	114780	114756	114756	I	0	" this is an objection to all kinds of application - to life itself , except under some very uncommon circumstances . "
114781	114787	114789	114789	Richard	295	" Do you think so ? "
114794	114806	114807	114807	he	3098	" Perhaps ! Ha ! Why , then , you know , "
114815	114852	114807	114807	he	3098	" we travel outside a circle to what I said just now . It 'll do as well as anything else . Oh , it 's all right enough ! Let us talk about something else . "
114976	114982	114983	114983	he	3098	" My dear Mother Hubbard , "
114986	115091	115093	115093	Richard	295	" that 's the very thing ! I have thought of that several times and have been quite angry with myself for meaning to be so much in earnest and - somehow - not exactly being so . I do n't know how it is ; I seem to want something or other to stand by . Even you have no idea how fond I am of Ada my darling cousin , I love you , so much ! , but I do n't settle down to constancy in other things . It 's such uphill work , and it takes such a time ! "
115100	115105	115106	115106	I	0	" That may be , "
115109	115120	115106	115106	I	0	" because you do n't like what you have chosen . "
115121	115125	115127	115127	Ada	294	" Poor fellow ! "
115129	115140	115127	115127	Ada	294	" I am sure I do n't wonder at it ! "
115204	115212	115214	115214	Richard	295	" You see , my precious girl , "
115226	115289	115214	115214	Richard	295	" I was a little hasty perhaps ; or I misunderstood my own inclinations perhaps . They do n't seem to lie in that direction . I could n't tell till I tried . Now the question is whether it 's worth - while to undo all that has been done . It seems like making a great disturbance about nothing particular . "
115290	115295	115297	115297	I	0	" My dear Richard , "
115299	115308	115214	115214	Richard	295	" how CAN you say about nothing particular ? "
115309	115317	115318	115318	he	3100	" I do n't mean absolutely that , "
115321	115337	115339	115339	Ada	294	" I mean that it MAY be nothing particular because I may never want it . "
115384	115392	115394	115394	Richard	295	" There , my dear Mrs. Shipton , "
115396	115420	115394	115394	Richard	295	" you touch me home . Yes , I have . I have been thinking that the law is the boy for me . "
115421	115425	115427	115427	Ada	294	" The law ! "
115437	115446	115448	115448	Richard	295	" If I went into Kenge 's office , "
115450	115539	115448	115448	Richard	295	" and if I were placed under articles to Kenge , I should have my eye on the - hum ! - the forbidden ground - and should be able to study it , and master it , and to satisfy myself that it was not neglected and was being properly conducted . I should be able to look after Ada 's interests and my own interests the same thing ! ; and I should peg away at Blackstone and all those fellows with the most tremendous ardour . "
115609	115614	115616	115616	Richard	295	" My dear Minerva , "
115618	115666	115668	115668	Richard	295	" I am as steady as you are . I made a mistake ; we are all liable to mistakes ; I wo n't do so any more , and I 'll become such a lawyer as is not often seen . That is , you know , "
115674	115695	115668	115668	Richard	295	" if it really is worth - while , after all , to make such a disturbance about nothing particular ! "
115774	115777	115779	115780	my guardian	10304	" Rick , "
115787	115860	115779	115780	my guardian	10304	" we can retreat with honour , and we will . But we must be careful - for our cousin 's sake , Rick , for our cousin 's sake - that we make no more such mistakes . Therefore , in the matter of the law , we will have a good trial before we decide . We will look before we leap , and take plenty of time about it . "
115993	116008	116017	116017	he	3102	" Cousin John , I hope you do n't think the worse of Richard ? "
116009	116015	116017	116017	he	3102	" No , my love , "
116019	116041	116017	116017	he	3102	" Because it was very natural that Richard should be mistaken in such a difficult case . It is not uncommon . "
116042	116050	116052	116052	he	3102	" No , no , my love , "
116054	116060	116052	116052	he	3102	" Do n't look unhappy . "
116061	116072	116074	116074	Ada	294	" Oh , I am not unhappy , cousin John ! "
116097	116115	116087	116087	she	294	" But I should be a little so if you thought at all the worse of Richard . "
116116	116120	116122	116123	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" My dear , "
116125	116211	116122	116123	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" I should think the worse of him only if you were ever in the least unhappy through his means . I should be more disposed to quarrel with myself even then , than with poor Rick , for I brought you together . But , tut , all this is nothing ! He has time before him , and the race to run . I think the worse of him ? Not I , my loving cousin ! And not you , I swear ! "
116212	116220	116222	116222	Ada	294	" No , indeed , cousin John , "
116224	116268	116222	116222	Ada	294	" I am sure I could not - I am sure I would not - think any ill of Richard if the whole world did . I could , and I would , think better of him then than at any other time ! "
116301	116305	116307	116308	my guardian	10304	" I think , "
116314	116363	116307	116308	my guardian	10304	" I think it must be somewhere written that the virtues of the mothers shall occasionally be visited on the children , as well as the sins of the father . Good night , my rosebud . Good night , little woman . Pleasant slumbers ! Happy dreams ! "
116636	116648	116632	116632	I	0	" Esther ! You to be low - spirited . YOU ! "
116675	116698	116700	116700	I.	0	" As if you had anything to make you unhappy , instead of everything to make you happy , you ungrateful heart ! "
116951	116954	116955	116955	I	0	" Esther ! "
116964	116973	116955	116955	I	0	" At work so late , my dear ? "
116974	116983	116985	116985	I	0	" I am working late to - night , "
116987	117026	116985	116985	I	0	" because I could n't sleep and wished to tire myself . But , dear guardian , you are late too , and look weary . You have no trouble , I hope , to keep you waking ? "
117027	117039	117041	117041	he	10304	" None , little woman , that YOU would readily understand , "
117068	117075	117054	117054	I	0	" That I could readily understand ! "
117076	117083	117085	117085	he	10304	" Remain a moment , Esther , "
117087	117094	117085	117085	he	10304	" You were in my thoughts . "
117095	117106	117107	117107	He	10304	" I hope I was not the trouble , guardian ? "
117148	117155	117141	117141	I	0	" None that I could understand ! "
117156	117160	117162	117163	my guardian	10304	" Little woman , "
117165	117206	117162	117163	my guardian	10304	" I was thinking - that is , I have been thinking since I have been sitting here - that you ought to know of your own history all I know . It is very little . Next to nothing . "
117207	117211	117212	117212	I	0	" Dear guardian , "
117215	117226	117212	117212	I	0	" when you spoke to me before on that subject - "
117227	117232	117233	117233	he	10304	" But since then , "
117244	117284	117233	117233	he	10304	" I have reflected that your having anything to ask me , and my having anything to tell you , are different considerations , Esther . It is perhaps my duty to impart to you the little I know . "
117285	117297	117212	117212	I	0	" If you think so , guardian , it is right . "
117298	117303	117304	117304	he	10304	" I think so , "
117316	117371	117304	117304	he	10304	" My dear , I think so now . If any real disadvantage can attach to your position in the mind of any man or woman worth a thought , it is right that you at least of all the world should not magnify it to yourself by having vague impressions of its nature . "
117391	117451	117372	117372	I	0	" One of my earliest remembrances , guardian , is of these words : ' Your mother , Esther , is your disgrace , and you were hers . The time will come , and soon enough , when you will understand this better , and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can . ' "
117535	117542	117543	117543	he	3119	" Nine years , my dear , "
117552	117723	117543	117543	he	3119	" have passed since I received a letter from a lady living in seclusion , written with a stern passion and power that rendered it unlike all other letters I have ever read . It was written to me as it told me in so many words , perhaps because it was the writer 's idiosyncrasy to put that trust in me , perhaps because it was mine to justify it . It told me of a child , an orphan girl then twelve years old , in some such cruel words as those which live in your remembrance . It told me that the writer had bred her in secrecy from her birth , had blotted out all trace of her existence , and that if the writer were to die before the child became a woman , she would be left entirely friendless , nameless , and unknown . It asked me to consider if I would , in that case , finish what the writer had begun . "
117734	117807	117732	117732	him	3120	" Your early recollection , my dear , will supply the gloomy medium through which all this was seen and expressed by the writer , and the distorted religion which clouded her mind with impressions of the need there was for the child to expiate an offence of which she was quite innocent . I felt concerned for the little creature , in her darkened life , and replied to the letter . "
117816	117939	117940	117940	I	0	" It laid the injunction on me that I should never propose to see the writer , who had long been estranged from all intercourse with the world , but who would see a confidential agent if I would appoint one . I accredited Mr. Kenge . The lady said , of her own accord and not of his seeking , that her name was an assumed one . That she was , if there were any ties of blood in such a case , the child 's aunt . That more than this she would never and he was well persuaded of the steadfastness of her resolution for any human consideration disclose . My dear , I have told you all . "
117951	117962	117963	117963	he	3121	" I saw my ward oftener than she saw me , "
117972	118005	117963	117963	he	3121	" and I always knew she was beloved , useful , and happy . She repays me twenty - thousandfold , and twenty more to that , every hour in every day ! "
118006	118011	118013	118013	I	0	" And oftener still , "
118027	118090	118016	118016	she	3122	" At the word father , I saw his former trouble come into his face . He subdued it as before , and it was gone in an instant ; but it had been there and it had come so swiftly upon my words that I felt as if they had given him a shock . I again inwardly repeated , wondering , "
118104	118125	118016	118016	she	3122	" No , it was true . I did not understand it . Not for many and many a day . "
118135	118145	118016	118016	she	3122	" said he , kissing me on the forehead , "
118175	118959	118160	118160	You	9610	" I neither worked nor thought any more that night . I opened my grateful heart to heaven in thankfulness for its providence to me and its care of me , and fell asleep . We had a visitor next day . Mr. Allan Woodcourt came . He came to take leave of us ; he had settled to do so beforehand . He was going to China and to India as a surgeon on board ship . He was to be away a long , long time . I believe - at least I know - that he was not rich . All his widowed mother could spare had been spent in qualifying him for his profession . It was not lucrative to a young practitioner , with very little influence in London ; and although he was , night and day , at the service of numbers of poor people and did wonders of gentleness and skill for them , he gained very little by it in money . He was seven years older than I. Not that I need mention it , for it hardly seems to belong to anything . I think - I mean , he told us - that he had been in practice three or four years and that if he could have hoped to contend through three or four more , he would not have made the voyage on which he was bound . But he had no fortune or private means , and so he was going away . He had been to see us several times altogether . We thought it a pity he should go away . Because he was distinguished in his art among those who knew it best , and some of the greatest men belonging to it had a high opinion of him . When he came to bid us good - bye , he brought his mother with him for the first time . She was a pretty old lady , with bright black eyes , but she seemed proud . She came from Wales and had had , a long time ago , an eminent person for an ancestor , of the name of Morgan ap- Kerrig - of some place that sounded like Gimlet - who was the most illustrious person that ever was known and all of whose relations were a sort of royal family . He appeared to have passed his life in always getting up into mountains and fighting somebody ; and a bard whose name sounded like Crumlinwallinwer had sung his praises in a piece which was called , as nearly as I could catch it , Mewlinnwillinwodd . Mrs. Woodcourt , after expatiating to us on the fame of her great kinsman , said that no doubt wherever her son Allan went he would remember his pedigree and would on no account form an alliance below it . She told him that there were many handsome English ladies in India who went out on speculation , and that there were some to be picked up with property , but that neither charms nor wealth would suffice for the descendant from such a line without birth , which must ever be the first consideration . She talked so much about birth that for a moment I half fancied , and with pain - But what an idle fancy to suppose that she could think or care what MINE was ! Mr. Woodcourt seemed a little distressed by her prolixity , but he was too considerate to let her see it and contrived delicately to bring the conversation round to making his acknowledgments to my guardian for his hospitality and for the very happy hours - he called them the very happy hours - he had passed with us . The recollection of them , he said , would go with him wherever he went and would be always treasured . And so we gave him our hands , one after another - at least , they did - and I did ; and so he put his lips to Ada 's hand - and to mine ; and so he went away upon his long , long voyage ! I was very busy indeed all day and wrote directions home to the servants , and wrote notes for my guardian , and dusted his books and papers , and jingled my housekeeping keys a good deal , one way and another . I was still busy between the lights , singing and working by the window , when who should come in but Caddy , whom I had no expectation of seeing ! "
118967	118971	118962	118962	Caddy	304	" said I , "
118976	118988	118991	118991	I	0	" She had such an exquisite little nosegay in her hand . "
118997	119001	118995	118995	Esther	283	" replied Caddy . "
119010	119011	119012	119012	Prince	444	" "
119017	119024	119012	119012	Prince	444	" said I in a whisper . "
119027	119042	119044	119044	Prince	444	" answered Caddy , shaking her head and holding them to me to smell . "
119046	119047	119044	119044	Prince	444	" "
119056	119059	119054	119054	Caddy	304	" said I. "
119066	119067	119063	119064	two lovers	3130	" "
119079	119083	119071	119071	they	3130	" said Caddy . "
119093	119184	119071	119071	they	3130	" I repeated , pinching her cheek . Caddy only laughed in return , and telling me that she had come for half an hour , at the expiration of which time Prince would be waiting for her at the corner , sat chatting with me and Ada in the window , every now and then handing me the flowers again or trying how they looked against my hair . At last , when she was going , she took me into my room and put them in my dress . "
119188	119194	119071	119071	they	3130	" said I , surprised . "
119198	119205	119071	119071	they	3130	" said Caddy with a kiss . "
119213	119214	119211	119211	somebody	843	" "
119218	119219	119211	119211	somebody	843	" "
119226	119230	119211	119211	somebody	843	" said Caddy . "
119273	119284	119211	119211	somebody	843	" said Caddy , adjusting them with a careful hand , "
119303	119304	119297	119297	somebody	843	" "
119314	119330	119336	119336	they	3131	" said Ada , coming laughingly behind me and clasping me merrily round the waist . "
119363	119581	119342	119342	They	3131	" CHAPTER XVIII Lady Dedlock It was not so easy as it had appeared at first to arrange for Richard 's making a trial of Mr. Kenge 's office . Richard himself was the chief impediment . As soon as he had it in his power to leave Mr. Badger at any moment , he began to doubt whether he wanted to leave him at all . He did n't know , he said , really . It was n't a bad profession ; he could n't assert that he disliked it ; perhaps he liked it as well as he liked any other - suppose he gave it one more chance ! Upon that , he shut himself up for a few weeks with some books and some bones and seemed to acquire a considerable fund of information with great rapidity . His fervour , after lasting about a month , began to cool , and when it was quite cooled , began to grow warm again . His vacillations between law and medicine lasted so long that midsummer arrived before he finally separated from Mr. Badger and entered on an experimental course of Messrs. Kenge and Carboy . For all his waywardness , he took great credit to himself as being determined to be in earnest "
119585	119621	119342	119342	They	3131	" And he was so good - natured throughout , and in such high spirits , and so fond of Ada , that it was very difficult indeed to be otherwise than pleased with him . "
119627	119650	119342	119342	They	3131	" who , I may mention , found the wind much given , during this period , to stick in the east ; "
119656	119663	119653	119654	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Richard would say to me , "
119707	119887	119888	119888	My	0	" The idea of his taking himself well to task , with that laughing face and heedless manner and with a fancy that everything could catch and nothing could hold , was ludicrously anomalous . However , he told us between - whiles that he was doing it to such an extent that he wondered his hair did n't turn grey . His regular wind - up of the business was as I have said that he went to Mr. Kenge 's about midsummer to try how he liked it . All this time he was , in money affairs , what I have described him in a former illustration - generous , profuse , wildly careless , but fully persuaded that he was rather calculating and prudent . I happened to say to Ada , in his presence , half jestingly , half seriously , about the time of his going to Mr. Kenge 's , that he needed to have Fortunatus ' purse , he made so light of money , which he answered in this way , "
119973	120067	120070	120071	little woman	1937	" It was a question much discussed between him and my guardian what arrangements should be made for his living in London while he experimented on the law , for we had long since gone back to Bleak House , and it was too far off to admit of his coming there oftener than once a week . My guardian told me that if Richard were to settle down at Mr. Kenge 's he would take some apartments or chambers where we too could occasionally stay for a few days at a time ; "
120073	120083	120070	120071	little woman	1937	" he added , rubbing his head very significantly , "
120092	120441	120070	120071	little woman	1937	" The discussions ended in our hiring for him , by the month , a neat little furnished lodging in a quiet old house near Queen Square . He immediately began to spend all the money he had in buying the oddest little ornaments and luxuries for this lodging ; and so often as Ada and I dissuaded him from making any purchase that he had in contemplation which was particularly unnecessary and expensive , he took credit for what it would have cost and made out that to spend anything less on something else was to save the difference . While these affairs were in abeyance , our visit to Mr. Boythorn 's was postponed . At length , Richard having taken possession of his lodging , there was nothing to prevent our departure . He could have gone with us at that time of the year very well , but he was in the full novelty of his new position and was making most energetic attempts to unravel the mysteries of the fatal suit . Consequently we went without him , and my darling was delighted to praise him for being so busy . We made a pleasant journey down into Lincolnshire by the coach and had an entertaining companion in Mr. Skimpole . His furniture had been all cleared off , it appeared , by the person who took possession of it on his blue - eyed daughter 's birthday , but he seemed quite relieved to think that it was gone . Chairs and table , he said , were wearisome objects ; they were monotonous ideas , they had no variety of expression , they looked you out of countenance , and you looked them out of countenance . How pleasant , then , to be bound to no particular chairs and tables , but to sport like a butterfly among all the furniture on hire , and to flit from rosewood to mahogany , and from mahogany to walnut , and from this shape to that , as the humour took one ! "
120449	120461	120070	120071	little woman	1937	" said Mr. Skimpole with a quickened sense of the ludicrous , "
120567	120568	120562	120562	His	1425	" "
120571	120579	120562	120562	His	1425	" said my guardian good - humouredly , "
120600	120601	120562	120562	His	1425	" "
120604	120609	120562	120562	His	1425	" returned Mr. Skimpole . "
120673	120674	120667	120667	He	288	" "
120680	120685	120667	120667	He	288	" said my guardian . "
120690	120695	120696	120696	I	0	" returned Mr. Skimpole . "
120978	121302	120965	120965	he	288	" If these were some of the inconveniences of Mr. Skimpole 's childhood , it assuredly possessed its advantages too . On the journey he had a very good appetite for such refreshment as came in our way including a basket of choice hothouse peaches , but never thought of paying for anything . So when the coachman came round for his fee , he pleasantly asked him what he considered a very good fee indeed , now - a liberal one - and on his replying half a crown for a single passenger , said it was little enough too , all things considered , and left Mr. Jarndyce to give it him . It was delightful weather . The green corn waved so beautifully , the larks sang so joyfully , the hedges were so full of wild flowers , the trees were so thickly out in leaf , the bean - fields , with a light wind blowing over them , filled the air with such a delicious fragrance ! Late in the afternoon we came to the market- town where we were to alight from the coach - a dull little town with a church - spire , and a marketplace , and a market - cross , and one intensely sunny street , and a pond with an old horse cooling his legs in it , and a very few men sleepily lying and standing about in narrow little bits of shade . After the rustling of the leaves and the waving of the corn all along the road , it looked as still , as hot , as motionless a little town as England could produce . At the inn we found Mr. Boythorn on horseback , waiting with an open carriage to take us to his house , which was a few miles off . He was overjoyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity . "
121306	121363	121373	121374	Mr. Skimpole	326	" said he after giving us a courteous greeting . This a most infamous coach . It is the most flagrant example of an abominable public vehicle that ever encumbered the face of the earth . It is twenty - five minutes after its time this afternoon . The coachman ought to be put to death ! "
121364	121371	121373	121374	Mr. Skimpole	326	" IS he after his time ? "
121384	121390	121382	121382	himself	326	" You know my infirmity . "
121391	121402	121404	121405	Mr. Boythorn	367	" Twenty - five minutes ! Twenty - six minutes ! "
121412	121463	121404	121405	Mr. Boythorn	367	" With two ladies in the coach , this scoundrel has deliberately delayed his arrival six and twenty minutes . Deliberately ! It is impossible that it can be accidental ! But his father - and his uncle - were the most profligate coachmen that ever sat upon a box . "
121493	121500	121501	121501	he	367	" I am sorry , ladies , "
121518	121584	121501	121501	he	367	" that I am obliged to conduct you nearly two miles out of the way . But our direct road lies through Sir Leicester Dedlock 's park , and in that fellow 's property I have sworn never to set foot of mine , or horse 's foot of mine , pending the present relations between us , while I breathe the breath of life ! "
121615	121624	121626	121627	my guardian	10304	" Are the Dedlocks down here , Lawrence ? "
121644	121651	121653	121654	Mr. Boythorn	367	" Sir Arrogant Numskull is here , "
121656	121684	121653	121654	Mr. Boythorn	367	" Ha ha ha ! Sir Arrogant is here , and I am glad to say , has been laid by the heels here . My Lady , "
121707	121769	121688	121688	he	367	" is expected , I believe , daily . I am not in the least surprised that she postpones her appearance as long as possible . Whatever can have induced that transcendent woman to marry that effigy and figure - head of a baronet is one of the most impenetrable mysteries that ever baffled human inquiry . Ha ha ha ha ! "
121770	121774	121776	121777	my guardian	10304	" I suppose , "
121781	121805	121776	121777	my guardian	10304	" WE may set foot in the park while we are here ? The prohibition does not extend to us , does it ? "
121806	121816	121817	121817	he	367	" I can lay no prohibition on my guests , "
121838	121967	121817	121817	he	367	" except in the matter of their departure . I am only sorry that I can not have the happiness of being their escort about Chesney Wold , which is a very fine place ! But by the light of this summer day , Jarndyce , if you call upon the owner while you stay with me , you are likely to have but a cool reception . He carries himself like an eight - day clock at all times , like one of a race of eight - day clocks in gorgeous cases that never go and never went - Ha ha ha ! - but he will have some extra stiffness , I can promise you , for the friends of his friend and neighbour Boythorn ! "
121968	121978	121980	121981	my guardian	10304	" I shall not put him to the proof , "
121983	122034	121817	121817	he	367	" He is as indifferent to the honour of knowing me , I dare say , as I am to the honour of knowing him . The air of the grounds and perhaps such a view of the house as any other sightseer might get are quite enough for me . "
122035	122038	122040	122041	Mr. Boythorn	367	" Well ! "
122043	122157	122040	122041	Mr. Boythorn	367	" I am glad of it on the whole . It 's in better keeping . I am looked upon about here as a second Ajax defying the lightning . Ha ha ha ha ! When I go into our little church on a Sunday , a considerable part of the inconsiderable congregation expect to see me drop , scorched and withered , on the pavement under the Dedlock displeasure . Ha ha ha ha ! I have no doubt he is surprised that I do n't . For he is , by heaven , the most self - satisfied , and the shallowest , and the most coxcombical and utterly brainless ass ! "
122473	122486	122489	122489	he	367	" That 's the housekeeper 's grandson , Mr. Rouncewell by name , "
122491	122594	122489	122489	he	367	" and he is in love with a pretty girl up at the house . Lady Dedlock has taken a fancy to the pretty girl and is going to keep her about her own fair person - an honour which my young friend himself does not at all appreciate . However , he ca n't marry just yet , even if his Rosebud were willing ; so he is fain to make the best of it . In the meanwhile , he comes here pretty often for a day or two at a time to - fish . Ha ha ha ha ! "
122595	122607	122609	122609	Ada	294	" Are he and the pretty girl engaged , Mr. Boythorn ? "
122611	122619	122620	122620	he	3194	" Why , my dear Miss Clare , "
122623	122660	122661	122661	Ada	294	" I think they may perhaps understand each other ; but you will see them soon , I dare say , and I must learn from you on such a point - not you from me . "
123134	123150	123110	123110	himself	367	" Beware of the bull - dog . He is most ferocious . Lawrence Boythorn . "
123151	123162	123228	123228	he	367	" The blunderbus is loaded with slugs . Lawrence Boythorn . "
123163	123186	123110	123110	himself	367	" Man - traps and spring - guns are set here at all times of the day and night . Lawrence Boythorn . "
123187	123226	123228	123228	he	367	" Take notice . That any person or persons audaciously presuming to trespass on this property will be punished with the utmost severity of private chastisement and prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law . Lawrence Boythorn . "
123251	123262	123248	123248	he	367	" Ha ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ha ! "
123281	123292	123294	123295	Mr. Skimpole	326	" But this is taking a good deal of trouble , "
123301	123311	123297	123297	his	326	" when you are not in earnest after all . "
123312	123317	123319	123320	Mr. Boythorn	367	" Not in earnest ! "
123325	123414	123319	123320	Mr. Boythorn	367	" Not in earnest ! If I could have hoped to train him , I would have bought a lion instead of that dog and would have turned him loose upon the first intolerable robber who should dare to make an encroachment on my rights . Let Sir Leicester Dedlock consent to come out and decide this question by single combat , and I will meet him with any weapon known to mankind in any age or country . I am that much in earnest . Not more ! "
123839	123858	123860	123860	I	0	" ' Enter not into judgment with thy servant , O Lord , for in thy sight - ' "
124551	124557	124559	124560	Mr. Boythorn	367	" He believes he is ! "
124562	124583	124559	124560	Mr. Boythorn	367	" He firmly believes it . So did his father , and his grandfather , and his great - grandfather ! "
124584	124589	124591	124592	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Do you know , "
124599	124613	124591	124592	Mr. Skimpole	326	" it 's agreeable to me to see a man of that sort . "
124614	124618	124620	124621	Mr. Boythorn	367	" IS it ! "
124623	124632	124620	124621	Mr. Boythorn	367	" Say that he wants to patronize me , "
124637	124646	124591	124592	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Very well ! I do n't object . "
124647	124651	124653	124654	Mr. Boythorn	367	" I do , "
124659	124664	124666	124667	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Do you really ? "
124674	124883	124669	124669	his	326	" But that 's taking trouble , surely . And why should you take trouble ? Here am I , content to receive things childishly as they fall out , and I never take trouble ! I come down here , for instance , and I find a mighty potentate exacting homage . Very well ! I say ' Mighty potentate , here IS my homage ! It 's easier to give it than to withhold it . Here it is . If you have anything of an agreeable nature to show me , I shall be happy to see it ; if you have anything of an agreeable nature to give me , I shall be happy to accept it . ' Mighty potentate replies in effect , ' This is a sensible fellow . I find him accord with my digestion and my bilious system . He does n't impose upon me the necessity of rolling myself up like a hedgehog with my points outward . I expand , I open , I turn my silver lining outward like Milton 's cloud , and it 's more agreeable to both of us . ' That 's my view of such things , speaking as a child ! "
124884	124896	124898	124899	Mr. Boythorn	367	" But suppose you went down somewhere else to - morrow , "
124901	124919	124898	124899	Mr. Boythorn	367	" where there was the opposite of that fellow - or of this fellow . How then ? "
124920	124924	124926	124927	Mr. Skimpole	326	" How then ? "
124938	125043	124669	124669	his	326	" Just the same then ! I should say , ' My esteemed Boythorn ' - to make you the personification of our imaginary friend - ' my esteemed Boythorn , you object to the mighty potentate ? Very good . So do I. I take it that my business in the social system is to be agreeable ; I take it that everybody 's business in the social system is to be agreeable . It 's a system of harmony , in short . Therefore if you object , I object . Now , excellent Boythorn , let us go to dinner ! ' "
125044	125051	125053	125054	our host	3271	" But excellent Boythorn might say , "
125062	125067	125074	125075	Mr. Skimpole	326	" I 'll be - "
125068	125072	125074	125075	Mr. Skimpole	326	" I understand , "
125077	125083	125074	125075	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Very likely he would . "
125084	125093	125095	125096	Mr. Boythorn	367	" - if I WILL go to dinner ! "
125111	125132	125105	125105	his	367	" And he would probably add , ' Is there such a thing as principle , Mr. Harold Skimpole ? ' "
125133	125144	125145	125145	he	326	" To which Harold Skimpole would reply , you know , "
125158	125261	125145	125145	he	326	" ' Upon my life I have not the least idea ! I do n't know what it is you call by that name , or where it is , or who possesses it . If you possess it and find it comfortable , I am quite delighted and congratulate you heartily . But I know nothing about it , I assure you ; for I am a mere child , and I lay no claim to it , and I do n't want it ! ' So , you see , excellent Boythorn and I would go to dinner after all ! "
125437	125442	125443	125443	he	3278	" Enterprise and effort , "
125452	125659	125443	125443	he	3278	" are delightful to me . I believe I am truly cosmopolitan . I have the deepest sympathy with them . I lie in a shady place like this and think of adventurous spirits going to the North Pole or penetrating to the heart of the Torrid Zone with admiration . Mercenary creatures ask , ' What is the use of a man 's going to the North Pole ? What good does it do ? ' I ca n't say ; but , for anything I CAN say , he may go for the purpose - though he do n't know it - of employing my thoughts as I lie here . Take an extreme case . Take the case of the slaves on American plantations . I dare say they are worked hard , I dare say they do n't altogether like it . I dare say theirs is an unpleasant experience on the whole ; but they people the landscape for me , they give it a poetry for me , and perhaps that is one of the pleasanter objects of their existence . I am very sensible of it , if it be , and I should n't wonder if it were ! "
126234	126247	126261	126261	Ada	294	" Is it not dangerous to sit in so exposed a place ? "
126248	126256	126258	126258	Ada	294	" Oh , no , Esther dear ! "
126371	126377	126378	126378	she	266	" I have frightened you ? "
126394	126398	126400	126401	Lady Dedlock	266	" I believe , "
126406	126417	126400	126401	Lady Dedlock	266	" I have the pleasure of speaking to Mr. Jarndyce . "
126418	126435	126436	126436	he	10304	" Your remembrance does me more honour than I had supposed it would , Lady Dedlock , "
126439	126488	126400	126401	Lady Dedlock	266	" I recognized you in church on Sunday . I am sorry that any local disputes of Sir Leicester 's - they are not of his seeking , however , I believe - should render it a matter of some absurd difficulty to show you any attention here . "
126489	126497	126499	126500	my guardian	10304	" I am aware of the circumstances , "
126505	126511	126499	126500	my guardian	10304	" and am sufficiently obliged . "
126602	126636	126637	126637	she	3302	" Is the young gentleman disposed of whom you wrote to Sir Leicester about and whose wishes Sir Leicester was sorry not to have it in his power to advance in any way ? "
126646	126651	126653	126653	he	10304	" I hope so , "
126707	126719	126720	126720	He	10304	" I presume this is your other ward , Miss Clare ? "
126727	126740	126742	126743	Lady Dedlock	266	" You will lose the disinterested part of your Don Quixote character , "
126752	126768	126770	126770	she	3302	" if you only redress the wrongs of beauty like this . But present me , "
126776	126783	126770	126770	she	3302	" to this young lady too ! "
126784	126792	126794	126795	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Miss Summerson really is my ward , "
126797	126809	126794	126795	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" I am responsible to no Lord Chancellor in her case . "
126810	126819	126821	126822	my Lady	934	" Has Miss Summerson lost both her parents ? "
126824	126827	126821	126822	my Lady	934	" Yes . "
126828	126837	126838	126839	Lady Dedlock	266	" She is very fortunate in her guardian . "
126883	126899	126858	126858	she	266	" Ages have passed since we were in the habit of meeting , Mr. Jarndyce . "
126900	126922	126923	126923	he	288	" A long time . At least I thought it was a long time , until I saw you last Sunday , "
126926	126945	126946	126946	she	266	" What ! Even you are a courtier , or think it necessary to become one to me ! "
126952	126962	126946	126946	she	266	" I have achieved that reputation , I suppose . "
126963	126973	126975	126976	my guardian	10304	" You have achieved so much , Lady Dedlock , "
126978	126995	126975	126976	my guardian	10304	" that you pay some little penalty , I dare say . But none to me . "
126996	127000	127001	127001	she	266	" So much ! "
127007	127010	127012	127012	her	266	" Yes ! "
127079	127097	127098	127098	she	266	" I think you knew my sister when we were abroad together better than you know me ? "
127106	127115	127116	127116	he	3313	" Yes , we happened to meet oftener , "
127119	127126	127128	127129	Lady Dedlock	266	" We went our several ways , "
127131	127160	127128	127129	Lady Dedlock	266	" and had little in common even before we agreed to differ . It is to be regretted , I suppose , but it could not be helped . "
127233	127243	127245	127246	the keeper	3295	" The messenger is coming back , my Lady , "
127248	127253	127245	127246	the keeper	3295	" with the carriage . "
127309	127313	127315	127316	Lady Dedlock	266	" What now ? "
127318	127321	127315	127316	Lady Dedlock	266	" Two ! "
127322	127335	127337	127338	the Frenchwoman	3323	" I am your maid , my Lady , at the present , "
127340	127348	127337	127338	the Frenchwoman	3323	" The message was for the attendant . "
127349	127361	127363	127365	the pretty girl	12147	" I was afraid you might mean me , my Lady , "
127367	127375	127377	127378	her mistress	3327	" I did mean you , child , "
127381	127388	127389	127389	She	3327	" Put that shawl on me . "
127423	127428	127430	127431	Lady Dedlock	266	" I am sorry , "
127436	127468	127430	127431	Lady Dedlock	266	" that we are not likely to renew our former acquaintance . You will allow me to send the carriage back for your two wards . It shall be here directly . "
127520	127526	127527	127527	she	3323	" Come in , child , "
127534	127543	127527	127527	she	3323	" I shall want you . Go on ! "
127656	127663	127665	127666	my guardian	10304	" Is that young woman mad ? "
127668	127675	127677	127678	the keeper	3295	" Oh , no , sir ! "
127691	127748	127677	127678	the keeper	3295	" Hortense is not one of that sort . She has as good a head - piece as the best . But she 's mortal high and passionate - powerful high and passionate ; and what with having notice to leave , and having others put above her , she do n't take kindly to it . "
127749	127761	127763	127764	my guardian	10304	" But why should she walk shoeless through all that water ? "
127766	127781	127783	127784	the man	9972	" Why , indeed , sir , unless it is to cool her down ! "
127786	127795	127797	127798	the woman	10391	" Or unless she fancies it 's blood , "
127800	127821	127797	127798	the woman	10391	" She 'd as soon walk through that as anything else , I think , when her own 's up ! "
128519	128522	128512	128512	he	3382	" chaff , "
129187	129192	129179	129179	he	487	" in the ministry . "
129288	129293	129295	129296	Mr. Snagsby	370	" My little woman , "
129304	129316	129295	129296	Mr. Snagsby	370	" likes to have her religion rather sharp , you see ! "
129517	129532	129509	129509	his	370	" At what time did you expect Mr. and Mrs. Chadband , my love ? "
129533	129537	129539	129540	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" At six , "
129552	129558	129542	129543	Mr. Snagsby	370	" it 's gone that . "
129559	129569	129571	129572	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" Perhaps you 'd like to begin without them , "
129600	129614	129591	129591	he	370	" No , my dear , no . I merely named the time . "
129615	129620	129622	129623	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" What 's time , "
129625	129629	129622	129623	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" to eternity ? "
129630	129637	129639	129640	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Very true , my dear , "
129642	129686	129639	129640	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Only when a person lays in victuals for tea , a person does it with a view - perhaps - more to time . And when a time is named for having tea , it 's better to come up to it . "
129687	129694	129695	129696	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" To come up to it ! "
129701	129714	129695	129696	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" Up to it ! As if Mr. Chadband was a fighter ! "
129715	129723	129725	129726	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Not at all , my dear , "
129841	129854	129830	129830	she	373	" Mr. and Mrs. Cheeseming , least which , Imeantersay , whatsername ! "
129981	129985	129987	129988	Mr. Chadband	487	" My friends , "
129990	130083	129987	129988	Mr. Chadband	487	" peace be on this house ! On the master thereof , on the mistress thereof , on the young maidens , and on the young men ! My friends , why do I wish for peace ? What is peace ? Is it war ? No . Is it strife ? No . Is it lovely , and gentle , and beautiful , and pleasant , and serene , and joyful ? Oh , yes ! Therefore , my friends , I wish for peace , upon you and upon yours . "
130110	130116	130118	130119	Mr. Chadband	487	" Now , my friends , "
130129	130155	130118	130119	Mr. Chadband	487	" Guster presents herself . Mrs. Snagsby , in a spectral bass voice and without removing her eyes from Chadband , says with dreadful distinctness , "
130159	130160	130118	130119	Mr. Chadband	487	" "
130166	130186	130187	130187	Guster	373	" says Chadband , ' since I am upon this theme , and in my lowly path improving it - "
130193	130203	130187	130187	Guster	373	" one thousing seven hundred and eighty - two . "
130211	130215	130187	130187	Guster	373	" Go away ! "
130216	130222	130224	130225	Mr. Chadband	487	" Now , my friends , "
130227	130237	130224	130225	Mr. Chadband	487	" we will inquire in a spirit of love - "
130241	130250	130251	130252	Mr. Chadband	487	" one thousing seven hundred and eighty- two . "
130278	130289	130269	130269	his	487	" Let us hear the maiden ! Speak , maiden ! "
130290	130317	130319	130319	Guster	373	" One thousing seven hundred and eighty - two , if you please , sir . Which he wish to know what the shilling ware for , "
130323	130326	130328	130329	Mrs. Chadband	486	" For ? "
130331	130336	130337	130337	Guster	373	" For his fare ! "
130340	130353	130337	130337	Guster	373	" he insistes on one and eightpence or on summonsizzing the party . "
130378	130382	130384	130384	he	487	" My friends , "
130386	130418	130384	130384	he	487	" I remember a duty unfulfilled yesterday . It is right that I should be chastened in some penalty . I ought not to murmur . Rachael , pay the eightpence ! "
130438	130444	130430	130431	Mr. Snagsby	370	" You hear this apostle ! "
130504	130508	130510	130510	Chadband	486	" My friends , "
130512	130550	130510	130510	Chadband	486	" eightpence is not much ; it might justly have been one and fourpence ; it might justly have been half a crown . O let us be joyful , joyful ! O let us be joyful ! "
130586	130590	130592	130592	he	487	" My friends , "
130594	130680	130592	130592	he	487	" what is this which we now behold as being spread before us ? Refreshment . Do we need refreshment then , my friends ? We do . And why do we need refreshment , my friends ? Because we are but mortal , because we are but sinful , because we are but of the earth , because we are not of the air . Can we fly , my friends ? We can not . Why can we not fly , my friends ? "
130704	130708	130681	130682	Mr. Snagsby	370	" No wings . "
130718	130725	130727	130728	Mr. Chadband	487	" I say , my friends , "
130739	130839	130841	130841	Chadband	487	" why can we not fly ? Is it because we are calculated to walk ? It is . Could we walk , my friends , without strength ? We could not . What should we do without strength , my friends ? Our legs would refuse to bear us , our knees would double up , our ankles would turn over , and we should come to the ground . Then from whence , my friends , in a human point of view , do we derive the strength that is necessary to our limbs ? Is it , "
130848	130913	130841	130841	Chadband	487	" from bread in various forms , from butter which is churned from the milk which is yielded unto us by the cow , from the eggs which are laid by the fowl , from ham , from tongue , from sausage , and from such like ? It is . Then let us partake of the good things which are set before us ! "
131181	131202	131172	131172	Guster	373	" And being wanted in the - not to put too fine a point upon it - in the shop , "
131209	131222	131204	131205	Mr. Snagsby	370	" perhaps this good company will excuse me for half a minute . "
131247	131254	131256	131257	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Why , bless my heart , "
131259	131265	131256	131257	Mr. Snagsby	370	" what 's the matter ! "
131266	131270	131272	131273	the constable	3463	" This boy , "
131275	131288	131272	131273	the constable	3463	" although he 's repeatedly told to , wo n't move on - "
131289	131300	131302	131303	the boy	1744	" I 'm always a - moving on , sar , "
131314	131349	131311	131311	his	1744	" I 've always been a - moving and a - moving on , ever since I was born . Where can I possibly move to , sir , more nor I do move ! "
131350	131357	131359	131360	the constable	3463	" He wo n't move on , "
131380	131415	131359	131360	the constable	3463	" although he has been repeatedly cautioned , and therefore I am obliged to take him into custody . He 's as obstinate a young gonoph as I know . He WON'T move on . "
131416	131428	131430	131431	the boy	1744	" Oh , my eye ! Where can I move to ! "
131453	131471	131473	131474	the constable	3463	" Do n't you come none of that or I shall make blessed short work of you ! "
131482	131502	131473	131474	the constable	3463	" My instructions are that you are to move on . I have told you so five hundred times . "
131503	131507	131509	131510	the boy	1744	" But where ? "
131512	131522	131524	131525	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Well ! Really , constable , you know , "
131541	131555	131533	131533	his	370	" really , that does seem a question . Where , you know ? "
131556	131565	131567	131568	the constable	3463	" My instructions do n't go to that , "
131570	131582	131567	131568	the constable	3463	" My instructions are that this boy is to move on . "
131748	131756	131758	131759	the constable	3463	" The simple question is , sir , "
131761	131773	131758	131759	the constable	3463	" whether you know this boy . He says you do . "
131785	131791	131778	131778	her	372	" No he do n't ! "
131792	131799	131801	131802	Mr. Snagsby	370	" My lit - tle woman ! "
131809	131859	131801	131802	Mr. Snagsby	370	" My love , permit me ! Pray have a moment 's patience , my dear . I do know something of this lad , and in what I know of him , I ca n't say that there 's any harm ; perhaps on the contrary , constable . "
131880	131883	131885	131886	the constable	3463	" Well ! "
131980	132006	131976	131978	the young man	10205	" Enter Mr. Guppy , who nods to Mr. Snagsby and touches his hat with the chivalry of clerkship to the ladies on the stairs . "
132024	132034	132017	132017	I	0	" says Mr. Guppy to the law - stationer , "

132067	132072	132063	132063	you	3479	" says Mr. Snagsby , "
132080	132097	132100	132100	I	0	" And Mr. Snagsby again relates his experience , again suppressing the half - crown fact . "
132106	132116	132100	132100	I	0	" says the constable , then , to Jo . "
132142	132143	132144	132144	I	0	" "

132286	132290	132283	132284	Mr. Snagsby	370	" says Jo , "
132441	132449	132409	132409	she	3497	" says Jo , with dirty tears , "
132511	132512	132500	132500	he	2210	" "
132532	132544	132530	132530	you	0	" says the constable , eyeing him aside with ineffable disdain . "
132555	132559	132545	132545	I	0	" replies Jo . "
132581	132582	132583	132583	You	0	" "
132589	132597	132583	132583	You	0	" the constable observes to the audience . "
132621	132622	132614	132614	you	370	" "
132625	132633	132614	132614	you	370	" cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs . "
132638	132643	132644	132644	Constable	12271	" pleads her husband . "
132663	132668	132655	132655	You	12271	" says Mr. Snagsby . "
132676	132682	132669	132669	I	0	" says the hapless Jo . "
132688	132693	132694	132694	You	12271	" observes the constable . "
132740	133066	132694	132694	You	12271	" With this farewell hint and pointing generally to the setting sun as a likely place to move on to , the constable bids his auditors good afternoon and makes the echoes of Cook 's Court perform slow music for him as he walks away on the shady side , carrying his iron - bound hat in his hand for a little ventilation . Now , Jo 's improbable story concerning the lady and the sovereign has awakened more or less the curiosity of all the company . Mr. Guppy , who has an inquiring mind in matters of evidence and who has been suffering severely from the lassitude of the long vacation , takes that interest in the case that he enters on a regular cross- examination of the witness , which is found so interesting by the ladies that Mrs. Snagsby politely invites him to step upstairs and drink a cup of tea , if he will excuse the disarranged state of the tea - table , consequent on their previous exertions . Mr. Guppy yielding his assent to this proposal , Jo is requested to follow into the drawing - room doorway , where Mr. Guppy takes him in hand as a witness , patting him into this shape , that shape , and the other shape like a butterman dealing with so much butter , and worrying him according to the best models . Nor is the examination unlike many such model displays , both in respect of its eliciting nothing and of its being lengthy , for Mr. Guppy is sensible of his talent , and Mrs. Snagsby feels not only that it gratifies her inquisitive disposition , but that it lifts her husband 's establishment higher up in the law . During the progress of this keen encounter , the vessel Chadband , being merely engaged in the oil trade , gets aground and waits to be floated off . "
133069	133074	132694	132694	You	12271	" says Mr. Guppy . "
133109	133119	133120	133120	You	0	" Mrs. Chadband whispers Mrs. Snagsby , who exclaims , "
133126	133127	133120	133120	You	0	" "
133131	133136	133120	133120	You	0	" replied Mrs. Chadband . "
133147	133156	133120	133120	You	0	" Mrs. Snagsby triumphantly explains to Mr. Guppy . "
133169	133170	133165	133167	Reverend Mr. Chadband	487	" "
133175	133180	133165	133167	Reverend Mr. Chadband	487	" says Mr. Guppy . "
133188	133193	133201	133201	ma'am	9644	" says Mrs. Chadband . "
133203	133214	133195	133195	you	486	" says Mr. Guppy , transferring his cross - examination . "
133217	133218	133195	133195	you	486	" "
133227	133238	133225	133225	ma'am	9644	" says Mr. Guppy . Mrs. Chadband shakes her head . "
133254	133272	133244	133250	somebody who was a party in something	3520	" says Mr. Guppy , who likes nothing better than to model his conversation on forensic principles . "
133279	133294	133244	133250	somebody who was a party in something	3520	" replies Mrs. Chadband , humouring the joke with a hard - favoured smile . "
133301	133306	133244	133250	somebody who was a party in something	3520	" repeats Mr. Guppy . "
133367	133368	133363	133363	woman	11411	" "
133371	133378	133363	133363	woman	11411	" says Mrs. Chadband as before . "
133384	133407	133381	133382	A child	931	" says Mr. Guppy , throwing on the admiring Mrs. Snagsby the regular acute professional eye which is thrown on British jurymen . "
133424	133425	133413	133413	you	9644	" "
133435	133446	133433	133433	sir	9569	" says Mrs. Chadband with another hard - favoured smile . "
133489	133490	133487	133487	Carboy	283	" "
133496	133503	133491	133492	Miss Summerson	283	" cries Mr. Guppy , excited . "
133510	133517	133504	133504	I	0	" says Mrs. Chadband with austerity . "
133555	133556	133548	133548	she	3536	" "
133561	133572	133548	133548	she	3536	" returns Mr. Guppy , moving across the small apartment , "
133613	133646	133601	133601	me	0	" Mr. Chadband , at last seeing his opportunity , makes his accustomed signal and rises with a smoking head , which he dabs with his pocket - handkerchief . Mrs. Snagsby whispers "
133649	133650	133601	133601	me	0	" "
133654	133658	133601	133601	me	0	" says Chadband , "
133664	133677	133601	133601	me	0	" which was certainly not the case so far as he was concerned "
133779	133814	133815	133817	My young friend	12149	" Jo , thus apostrophized , gives a slouch backward , and another slouch forward , and another slouch to each side , and confronts the eloquent Chadband with evident doubts of his intentions . "
133819	133823	133815	133817	My young friend	12149	" says Chadband , "
133859	133860	133861	133861	I	0	" "
133866	133870	133861	133861	I	0	" replies Jo . "
133877	133878	133879	133881	My young friend	12149	" "
133883	133887	133879	133881	My young friend	12149	" says Chadband , "
134026	134040	134043	134043	you	12149	" O running stream of sparkling joy To be a soaring human boy ! "
134123	134176	134113	134113	us	3564	" At this threatening stage of the discourse , Jo , who seems to have been gradually going out of his mind , smears his right arm over his face and gives a terrible yawn . Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses her belief that he is a limb of the arch - fiend . "
134180	134200	134113	134113	us	3564	" says Mr. Chadband with his persecuted chin folding itself into its fat smile again as he looks round , "
134284	134294	134295	134295	My	0	" Great sensation on the part of Mrs. Snagsby . "
134298	134308	134295	134295	My	0	" says Chadband , looking round him in conclusion , "
134385	134683	135495	135495	you	3572	" This with a cow - like lightness . Jo , whose immediate object seems to be to get away on any terms , gives a shuffling nod . Mr. Guppy then throws him a penny , and Mrs. Snagsby calls to Guster to see him safely out of the house . But before he goes downstairs , Mr. Snagsby loads him with some broken meats from the table , which he carries away , hugging in his arms . So , Mr. Chadband - of whom the persecutors say that it is no wonder he should go on for any length of time uttering such abominable nonsense , but that the wonder rather is that he should ever leave off , having once the audacity to begin - retires into private life until he invests a little capital of supper in the oil - trade . Jo moves on , through the long vacation , down to Blackfriars Bridge , where he finds a baking stony corner wherein to settle to his repast . And there he sits , munching and gnawing , and looking up at the great cross on the summit of St. Paul 's Cathedral , glittering above a red - and - violet - tinted cloud of smoke . From the boy 's face one might suppose that sacred emblem to be , in his eyes , the crowning confusion of the great , confused city - so golden , so high up , so far out of his reach . There he sits , the sun going down , the river running fast , the crowd flowing by him in two streams - everything moving on to some purpose and to one end - until he is stirred up and told to "
134686	135484	135495	135495	you	3572	" too . CHAPTER XX A New Lodger The long vacation saunters on towards term - time like an idle river very leisurely strolling down a flat country to the sea . Mr. Guppy saunters along with it congenially . He has blunted the blade of his penknife and broken the point off by sticking that instrument into his desk in every direction . Not that he bears the desk any ill will , but he must do something , and it must be something of an unexciting nature , which will lay neither his physical nor his intellectual energies under too heavy contribution . He finds that nothing agrees with him so well as to make little gyrations on one leg of his stool , and stab his desk , and gape . Kenge and Carboy are out of town , and the articled clerk has taken out a shooting license and gone down to his father 's , and Mr. Guppy 's two fellow - stipendiaries are away on leave . Mr. Guppy and Mr. Richard Carstone divide the dignity of the office . But Mr. Carstone is for the time being established in Kenge 's room , whereat Mr. Guppy chafes . So exceedingly that he with biting sarcasm informs his mother , in the confidential moments when he sups with her off a lobster and lettuce in the Old Street Road , that he is afraid the office is hardly good enough for swells , and that if he had known there was a swell coming , he would have got it painted . Mr. Guppy suspects everybody who enters on the occupation of a stool in Kenge and Carboy 's office of entertaining , as a matter of course , sinister designs upon him . He is clear that every such person wants to depose him . If he be ever asked how , why , when , or wherefore , he shuts up one eye and shakes his head . On the strength of these profound views , he in the most ingenious manner takes infinite pains to counterplot when there is no plot , and plays the deepest games of chess without any adversary . It is a source of much gratification to Mr. Guppy , therefore , to find the new - comer constantly poring over the papers in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , for he well knows that nothing but confusion and failure can come of that . His satisfaction communicates itself to a third saunterer through the long vacation in Kenge and Carboy 's office , to wit , Young Smallweed . Whether Young Smallweed metaphorically called Small and eke Chick Weed , as it were jocularly to express a fledgling was ever a boy is much doubted in Lincoln 's Inn . He is now something under fifteen and an old limb of the law . He is facetiously understood to entertain a passion for a lady at a cigar - shop in the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane and for her sake to have broken off a contract with another lady , to whom he had been engaged some years . He is a town - made article , of small stature and weazen features , but may be perceived from a considerable distance by means of his very tall hat . To become a Guppy is the object of his ambition . He dresses at that gentleman by whom he is patronized , talks at him , walks at him , founds himself entirely on him . He is honoured with Mr. Guppy 's particular confidence and occasionally advises him , from the deep wells of his experience , on difficult points in private life . Mr. Guppy has been lolling out of window all the morning after trying all the stools in succession and finding none of them easy , and after several times putting his head into the iron safe with a notion of cooling it . Mr. Smallweed has been twice dispatched for effervescent drinks , and has twice mixed them in the two official tumblers and stirred them up with the ruler . Mr. Guppy propounds for Mr. Smallweed 's consideration the paradox that the more you drink the thirstier you are and reclines his head upon the window- sill in a state of hopeless languor . While thus looking out into the shade of Old Square , Lincoln 's Inn , surveying the intolerable bricks and mortar , Mr. Guppy becomes conscious of a manly whisker emerging from the cloistered walk below and turning itself up in the direction of his face . At the same time , a low whistle is wafted through the Inn and a suppressed voice cries , "
135491	135492	135495	135495	you	3572	" "
135501	135508	135509	135509	Small	491	" says Mr. Guppy , aroused . "
135515	135529	135513	135513	Jobling	492	" Small 's head looks out of window too and nods to Jobling . "
135537	135542	135532	135532	you	3572	" inquires Mr. Guppy . "
135585	135608	135609	135609	I	0	" Jobling looks hungry and also has the appearance of having run to seed in the market - gardens down by Deptford . "
135633	135634	135626	135626	I	0	" "
135643	135659	135636	135636	you	3572	" says Mr. Guppy , throwing out the coin , which Mr. Jobling catches neatly . "
135669	135673	135690	135691	Mr. Guppy	301	" says Jobling . "
135699	135703	135690	135691	Mr. Guppy	301	" What enemy ? "
135704	135718	135690	135691	Mr. Guppy	301	" A new one . Going to be articled . Will you wait ? "
135719	135732	135734	135735	Mr. Jobling	492	" Can you give a fellow anything to read in the meantime ? "
135752	135758	135751	135751	he	492	" ca n't stand it . "
135759	135766	135768	135769	Mr. Guppy	301	" You shall have the paper , "
135771	135801	135768	135769	Mr. Guppy	301	" He shall bring it down . But you had better not be seen about here . Sit on our staircase and read . It 's a quiet place . "
135855	135863	135865	135866	Mr. Guppy	301	" Well , and how are you ? "
135873	135882	135865	135866	Mr. Guppy	301	" So , so . How are you ? "
135902	135907	135895	135896	Mr. Jobling	492	" How is SHE ? "
135918	135929	135930	135930	Jobling	492	" Jobling , there ARE chords in the human mind - "
135934	135940	135942	135943	Mr. Guppy	301	" Any subject but that ! "
135952	135960	135942	135943	Mr. Guppy	301	" For there ARE chords , Jobling - "
135994	135998	136008	136008	he	301	" Return immediately . "
136360	136362	136385	136385	he	490	" bread "
136430	136438	136439	136439	Chick	495	" What do YOU take , Chick ? "
136450	136467	136473	136473	his	490	" veal and ham and French beans - and do n't you forget the stuffing , Polly "
136798	136804	136806	136807	Mr. Jobling	492	" Thank you , Guppy , "
136809	136822	136806	136807	Mr. Jobling	492	" I really do n't know but what I WILL take another . "
136893	136902	136889	136890	Mr. Guppy	301	" You are a man again , Tony ! "
136903	136910	136912	136913	Mr. Jobling	492	" Well , not quite yet , "
136915	136921	136912	136913	Mr. Jobling	492	" Say , just born . "
136922	136937	136889	136890	Mr. Guppy	301	" Will you take any other vegetables ? Grass ? Peas ? Summer cabbage ? "
136938	136944	136946	136947	Mr. Jobling	492	" Thank you , Guppy , "
136949	136963	136946	136947	Mr. Jobling	492	" I really do n't know but what I WILL take summer cabbage . "
136975	136981	136912	136913	Mr. Jobling	492	" Without slugs , Polly ! "
136986	136994	136996	136997	Mr. Jobling	492	" I am growing up , Guppy , "
137009	137015	137048	137049	Messrs. Guppy	500	" Glad to hear it . "
137016	137028	137030	137031	Mr. Jobling	492	" In fact , I have just turned into my teens , "
137078	137083	137085	137086	Mr. Guppy	301	" Now , Small , "
137088	137096	137085	137086	Mr. Guppy	301	" what would you recommend about pastry ? "
137097	137101	137103	137104	Mr. Smallweed	490	" Marrow puddings , "
137107	137112	137114	137115	Mr. Jobling	492	" Aye , aye ! "
137121	137148	137114	137115	Mr. Jobling	492	" You 're there , are you ? Thank you , Mr. Guppy , I do n't know but what I WILL take a marrow pudding . "
137180	137184	137177	137178	Mr. Smallweed	490	" three Cheshires , "
137188	137193	137256	137257	Mr. Guppy	301	" three small rums . "
137230	137245	137213	137213	his	492	" I am grown up now , Guppy . I have arrived at maturity . "
137246	137254	137256	137257	Mr. Guppy	301	" What do you think , now , "
137259	137268	137256	137257	Mr. Guppy	301	" about - you do n't mind Smallweed ? "
137269	137287	137213	137213	his	492	" Not the least in the worid . I have the pleasure of drinking his good health . "
137288	137294	137296	137297	Mr. Smallweed	490	" Sir , to you ! "
137299	137310	137312	137313	Mr. Guppy	301	" I was saying , what do you think NOW , "
137315	137319	137312	137313	Mr. Guppy	301	" of enlisting ? "
137320	137330	137332	137333	Mr. Jobling	492	" Why , what I may think after dinner , "
137335	137386	137388	137389	Mr. Jobling	492	" is one thing , my dear Guppy , and what I may think before dinner is another thing . Still , even after dinner , I ask myself the question , What am I to do ? How am I to live ? Ill fo manger , you know , "
137406	137435	137396	137396	he	492	" Ill fo manger . That 's the French saying , and mangering is as necessary to me as it is to a Frenchman . Or more so . "
137442	137447	137388	137389	Mr. Jobling	492	" much more so . "
137448	137456	137458	137458	Jobling	492	" If any man had told me , "
137460	137489	137458	137458	Jobling	492	" even so lately as when you and I had the frisk down in Lincolnshire , Guppy , and drove over to see that house at Castle Wold - "
137498	137548	137550	137551	Mr. Jobling	492	" Chesney Wold . I thank my honourable friend for that cheer . If any man had told me then that I should be as hard up at the present time as I literally find myself , I should have - well , I should have pitched into him , "
137568	137578	137550	137551	Mr. Jobling	492	" I should have let fly at his head . "
137579	137595	137597	137598	Mr. Guppy	301	" Still , Tony , you were on the wrong side of the post then , "
137600	137611	137597	137598	Mr. Guppy	301	" You were talking about nothing else in the gig . "
137612	137615	137617	137618	Mr. Jobling	492	" Guppy , "
137620	137645	137617	137618	Mr. Jobling	492	" I will not deny it . I was on the wrong side of the post . But I trusted to things coming round . "
137670	137672	137597	137598	Mr. Guppy	301	" coming "
137685	137687	137597	137598	Mr. Guppy	301	" coming "
137690	137705	137707	137708	Mr. Jobling	492	" I had confident expectations that things would come round and be all square , "
137720	137845	137707	137708	Mr. Jobling	492	" But I was disappointed . They never did . And when it came to creditors making rows at the office and to people that the office dealt with making complaints about dirty trifles of borrowed money , why there was an end of that connexion . And of any new professional connexion too , for if I was to give a reference to - morrow , it would be mentioned and would sew me up . Then what 's a fellow to do ? I have been keeping out of the way and living cheap down about the market - gardens , but what 's the use of living cheap when you have got no money ? You might as well live dear . "
137846	137849	137850	137851	Mr. Smallweed	490	" Better , "
137854	137881	137883	137884	Mr. Jobling	492	" Certainly . It 's the fashionable way ; and fashion and whiskers have been my weaknesses , and I do n't care who knows it , "
137886	137902	137883	137884	Mr. Jobling	492	" They are great weaknesses - Damme , sir , they are great . Well , "
137917	137931	137932	137933	Mr. Guppy	301	" what can a fellow do , I ask you , BUT enlist ? "
137986	137989	137991	137992	Mr. Guppy	301	" Jobling , "
137994	138002	137991	137992	Mr. Guppy	301	" myself and our mutual friend Smallweed - "
138008	138012	138003	138004	Mr. Smallweed	490	" Gentlemen both ! "
138016	138032	138003	138004	Mr. Smallweed	490	" - Have had a little conversation on this matter more than once since you - "
138033	138040	138042	138043	Mr. Jobling	492	" Say , got the sack ! "
138046	138056	138042	138043	Mr. Jobling	492	" Say it , Guppy . You mean it . "
138057	138068	138069	138070	Mr. Smallweed	490	" No - o - o ! Left the Inn , "
138074	138083	138085	138086	Mr. Guppy	301	" Since you left the Inn , Jobling , "
138088	138113	138085	138086	Mr. Guppy	301	" and I have mentioned to our mutual friend Smallweed a plan I have lately thought of proposing . You know Snagsby the stationer ? "
138114	138123	138125	138126	Mr. Jobling	492	" I know there is such a stationer , "
138128	138142	138125	138126	Mr. Jobling	492	" He was not ours , and I am not acquainted with him . "
138143	138157	138158	138159	Mr. Guppy	301	" He IS ours , Jobling , and I AM acquainted with him , "
138162	138231	138158	138159	Mr. Guppy	301	" Well , sir ! I have lately become better acquainted with him through some accidental circumstances that have made me a visitor of his in private life . Those circumstances it is not necessary to offer in argument . They may - or they may not - have some reference to a subject which may - or may not - have cast its shadow on my existence . "
138288	138294	138296	138297	Mr. Guppy	301	" Such things may be , "
138299	138380	138296	138297	Mr. Guppy	301	" or they may not be . They are no part of the case . It is enough to mention that both Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are very willing to oblige me and that Snagsby has , in busy times , a good deal of copying work to give out . He has all Tulkinghorn 's , and an excellent business besides . I believe if our mutual friend Smallweed were put into the box , he could prove this ? "
138391	138399	138401	138402	Mr. Guppy	301	" Now , gentlemen of the jury , "
138404	138470	138401	138402	Mr. Guppy	301	" - I mean , now , Jobling - you may say this is a poor prospect of a living . Granted . But it 's better than nothing , and better than enlistment . You want time . There must be time for these late affairs to blow over . You might live through it on much worse terms than by writing for Snagsby . "
138491	138496	138478	138480	the sagacious Smallweed	490	" Hem ! Shakspeare ! "
138497	138508	138510	138511	Mr. Guppy	301	" There are two branches to this subject , Jobling , "
138513	138540	138542	138543	Mr. Guppy	301	" That is the first . I come to the second . You know Krook , the Chancellor , across the lane . Come , Jobling , "
138553	138567	138545	138545	his	301	" I think you know Krook , the Chancellor , across the lane ? "
138568	138575	138577	138578	Mr. Jobling	492	" I know him by sight , "
138580	138596	138577	138578	Mr. Jobling	492	" You know him by sight . Very well . And you know little Flite ? "
138597	138602	138604	138605	Mr. Jobling	492	" Everybody knows her , "
138607	138753	138604	138605	Mr. Jobling	492	" Everybody knows her . VERY well . Now it has been one of my duties of late to pay Flite a certain weekly allowance , deducting from it the amount of her weekly rent , which I have paid in consequence of instructions I have received to Krook himself , regularly in her presence . This has brought me into communication with Krook and into a knowledge of his house and his habits . I know he has a room to let . You may live there at a very low charge under any name you like , as quietly as if you were a hundred miles off . He 'll ask no questions and would accept you as a tenant at a word from me - before the clock strikes , if you chose . And I tell you another thing , Jobling , "
138769	138838	138762	138762	his	301	" he 's an extraordinary old chap - always rummaging among a litter of papers and grubbing away at teaching himself to read and write , without getting on a bit , as it seems to me . He is a most extraordinary old chap , sir . I do n't know but what it might be worth a fellow 's while to look him up a bit . "
138839	138845	138846	138847	Mr. Jobling	492	" You do n't mean - "
138850	138854	138846	138847	Mr. Jobling	492	" I mean , "
138866	138899	138860	138860	his	301	" that I ca n't make him out . I appeal to our mutual friend Smallweed whether he has or has not heard me remark that I ca n't make him out . "
138907	138911	138900	138901	Mr. Smallweed	490	" A few ! "
138912	138927	138929	138930	Mr. Guppy	301	" I have seen something of the profession and something of life , Tony , "
138932	139074	138929	138930	Mr. Guppy	301	" and it 's seldom I ca n't make a man out , more or less . But such an old card as this , so deep , so sly , and secret though I do n't believe he is ever sober , I never came across . Now , he must be precious old , you know , and he has not a soul about him , and he is reported to be immensely rich ; and whether he is a smuggler , or a receiver , or an unlicensed pawnbroker , or a money - lender - all of which I have thought likely at different times - it might pay you to knock up a sort of knowledge of him . I do n't see why you should n't go in for it , when everything else suits . "
139129	139141	139143	139144	Mr. Guppy	301	" If I had the energy I once possessed , Tony ! "
139149	139159	139143	139144	Mr. Guppy	301	" But there are chords in the human mind - "
139199	139212	139173	139174	Mr. Guppy	301	" as far as three or four or even five pound goes , "
139219	139227	139228	139229	Mr. Guppy	301	" For never shall it be said , "
139234	139245	139228	139229	Mr. Guppy	301	" that William Guppy turned his back upon his friend ! "
139265	139274	139259	139260	Mr. Jobling	492	" Guppy , my trump , your fist ! "
139282	139292	139275	139276	Mr. Guppy	301	" Jobling , my boy , there it is ! "
139297	139309	139293	139294	Mr. Jobling	492	" Guppy , we have been pals now for some years ! "
139314	139320	139310	139311	Mr. Guppy	301	" Jobling , we have . "
139335	139357	139327	139328	Mr. Jobling	492	" Thank you , Guppy , I do n't know but what I WILL take another glass for old acquaintance sake . "
139358	139366	139368	139369	Mr. Guppy	301	" Krook 's last lodger died there , "
139375	139380	139382	139383	Mr. Jobling	492	" Did he though ! "
139385	139400	139382	139383	Mr. Jobling	492	" There was a verdict . Accidental death . You do n't mind that ? "
139401	139404	139406	139407	Mr. Jobling	492	" No , "
139409	139440	139406	139407	Mr. Jobling	492	" I do n't mind it ; but he might as well have died somewhere else . It 's devilish odd that he need go and die at MY place ! "
139458	139471	139441	139442	Mr. Jobling	492	" There are places enough to die in , I should think ! "
139474	139490	139441	139442	Mr. Jobling	492	" He would n't have liked my dying at HIS place , I dare say ! "
139584	139589	139567	139567	he	490	" like one o'clock . "
139590	139596	139598	139599	Mr. Guppy	301	" Then I 'll pay , "
139601	139617	139598	139599	Mr. Guppy	301	" and we 'll go and see him . Small , what will it be ? "
139639	139733	139631	139631	his	490	" Four veals and hams is three , and four potatoes is three and four , and one summer cabbage is three and six , and three marrows is four and six , and six breads is five , and three Cheshires is five and three , and four half - pints of half - and - half is six and three , and four small rums is eight and three , and three Pollys is eight and six . Eight and six in half a sovereign , Polly , and eighteenpence out ! "
139925	139930	139932	139933	Mr. Guppy	301	" Hold up here ! "
139946	139954	139932	139933	Mr. Guppy	301	" Mr. Krook ! Halloa , sir ! "
139976	139994	139996	139997	Mr. Guppy	301	" Did you ever see such a stupor as he falls into , between drink and sleep ? "
139999	140007	139996	139997	Mr. Guppy	301	" If this is his regular sleep , "
140014	140030	140009	140009	Jobling	492	" it 'll last a long time one of these days , I am thinking . "
140031	140043	140045	140046	Mr. Guppy	301	" It 's always more like a fit than a nap , "
140052	140072	140045	140046	Mr. Guppy	301	" Halloa , your lordship ! Why , he might be robbed fifty times over ! Open your eyes ! "
140128	140137	140139	140140	Mr. Guppy	301	" He is alive , at any rate , "
140142	140168	140139	140140	Mr. Guppy	301	" How are you , my Lord Chancellor . I have brought a friend of mine , sir , on a little matter of business . "
140211	140220	140222	140223	Mr. Guppy	301	" How do you do , Mr. Krook ? "
140228	140251	140252	140254	The old man	1212	" How do you do , sir ? You are looking charming , Mr. Krook . I hope you are pretty well ? "
140349	140371	140330	140330	He	1212	" Your servant , gentlemen ; I 've been dozing . Hi ! I am hard to wake , odd times . "
140372	140380	140382	140383	Mr. Guppy	301	" Rather so , indeed , sir , "
140385	140401	140405	140405	Krook	251	" What ? You 've been a - trying to do it , have you ? "
140407	140412	140405	140405	Krook	251	" Only a little , "
140443	140447	140448	140448	he	1212	" I say ! "
140457	140465	140448	140448	he	1212	" Somebody 's been making free here ! "
140466	140475	140477	140478	Mr. Guppy	301	" I assure you we found it so , "
140480	140492	140477	140478	Mr. Guppy	301	" Would you allow me to get it filled for you ? "
140493	140500	140502	140502	Krook	251	" Yes , certainly I would ! "
140507	140540	140541	140541	He	251	" Certainly I would ! Do n't mention it ! Get it filled next door - Sol 's Arms - the Lord Chancellor 's fourteenpenny . Bless you , they know ME ! "
140593	140599	140600	140600	he	1212	" But , I say , "
140613	140627	140600	140600	he	1212	" this ai n't the Lord Chancellor 's fourteenpenny . This is eighteenpenny ! "
140628	140637	140639	140640	Mr. Guppy	301	" I thought you might like that better , "
140642	140650	140639	140640	Mr. Guppy	301	" You 're a nobleman , sir , "
140670	140679	140658	140658	his	1212	" You 're a baron of the land . "
140742	140754	140755	140755	he	251	" You 'd like to see the room , young man ? "
140758	140806	140755	140755	he	251	" Ah ! It 's a good room ! Been whitewashed . Been cleaned down with soft soap and soda . Hi ! It 's worth twice the rent , letting alone my company when you want it and such a cat to keep the mice away . "
141573	141577	141570	141570	Krook	251	" very free , "
141642	141677	141626	141626	she	386	" Mark my words , Mrs. Perkins , ma'am , and do n't you be surprised , Lord bless you , if that young man comes in at last for old Krook 's money ! "
142199	142202	142194	142194	he	3693	" going out "
142633	142639	142640	142641	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" And where 's Bart ? "
142651	142658	142660	142660	Judy	508	" He an't come in yet , "
142662	142674	142660	142660	Judy	508	" It 's his tea - time , is n't it ? "
142675	142678	142640	142641	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" No . "
142679	142691	142660	142660	Judy	508	" How much do you mean to say it wants then ? "
142692	142696	142660	142660	Judy	508	" Ten minutes . "
142697	142700	142640	142641	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Hey ? "
142701	142705	142660	142660	Judy	508	" Ten minutes . "
142713	142716	142718	142719	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Ho ! "
142721	142725	142718	142719	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Ten minutes . "
142760	142767	142735	142735	her	337	" Ten ten - pound notes ! "
142777	142784	142786	142789	the good old man	3721	" Drat you , be quiet ! "
143410	143417	143419	143419	Judy	508	" Charley , do you mean ? "
143421	143424	143419	143419	Judy	508	" Hey ? "
143429	143436	143419	143419	Judy	508	" Charley , do you mean ? "
143456	143488	143442	143443	Grandmother Smallweed	337	" Over the water ! Charley over the water , Charley over the water , over the water to Charley , Charley over the water , over the water to Charley ! "
143510	143513	143514	143514	he	509	" Ha ! "
143521	143544	143514	143514	he	509	" If that 's her name . She eats a deal . It would be better to allow her for her keep . "
143567	143570	143572	143574	the old man	1212	" No ? "
143576	143580	143572	143574	the old man	1212	" Why not ? "
143581	143597	143599	143599	Judy	508	" She 'd want sixpence a day , and we can do it for less , "
143601	143604	143599	143599	Judy	508	" Sure ? "
143635	143644	143617	143617	she	508	" You , Charley , where are you ? "
143685	143693	143695	143695	Judy	508	" What work are you about now ? "
143710	143723	143725	143725	Charley	327	" I 'm a - cleaning the upstairs back room , miss , "
143727	143752	143754	143754	Judy	508	" Mind you do it thoroughly , and do n't loiter . Shirking wo n't do for me . Make haste ! Go along ! "
143762	143776	143754	143754	Judy	508	" You girls are more trouble than you 're worth , by half . "
143826	143833	143835	143836	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Aye , aye , Bart ! "
143838	143845	143835	143836	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Here you are , hey ? "
143846	143851	143853	143853	Bart	506	" Here I am , "
143855	143865	143866	143866	Small	491	" Been along with your friend again , Bart ? "
143869	143877	143878	143878	Small	491	" Dining at his expense , Bart ? "
143882	143923	143925	143927	the venerable sage	3747	" That 's right . Live at his expense as much as you can , and take warning by his foolish example . That 's the use of such a friend . The only use you can put him to , "
144010	144015	144017	144020	the good old gentleman	3751	" Yes , yes , "
144029	144061	144017	144020	the good old gentleman	3751	" That 's such advice as your father would have given you , Bart . You never saw your father . More 's the pity . He was my true son . "
144086	144093	144095	144097	the old gentleman	985	" He was my true son , "
144108	144119	144095	144097	the old gentleman	985	" a good accountant , and died fifteen years ago . "
144131	144158	144124	144124	her	510	" Fifteen hundred pound . Fifteen hundred pound in a black box , fifteen hundred pound locked up , fifteen hundred pound put away and hid ! "
144405	144574	144575	144575	Judy	508	" If your father , Bart , had lived longer , he might have been worth a deal of money - you brimstone chatterer ! - but just as he was beginning to build up the house that he had been making the foundations for , through many a year - you jade of a magpie , jackdaw , and poll - parrot , what do you mean ! - he took ill and died of a low fever , always being a sparing and a spare man , full of business care - I should like to throw a cat at you instead of a cushion , and I will too if you make such a confounded fool of yourself ! - and your mother , who was a prudent woman as dry as a chip , just dwindled away like touchwood after you and Judy were born - you are an old pig . You are a brimstone pig . You 're a head of swine ! "
144659	144670	144672	144674	the old gentleman	985	" But your father and me were partners , Bart , "
144676	144762	144672	144674	the old gentleman	985	" and when I am gone , you and Judy will have all there is . It 's rare for you both that you went out early in life - Judy to the flower business , and you to the law . You wo n't want to spend it . You 'll get your living without it , and put more to it . When I am gone , Judy will go back to the flower business and you 'll still stick to the law . "
144847	144855	144857	144857	Judy	508	" Now , if everybody has done , "
144863	144889	144857	144857	Judy	508	" I 'll have that girl in to her tea . She would never leave off if she took it by herself in the kitchen . "
144984	144996	144998	144998	Judy	508	" Now , do n't stare about you all the afternoon , "
145024	145036	145008	145008	she	508	" but take your victuals and get back to your work . "
145037	145042	145044	145044	Charley	327	" Yes , miss , "
145046	145052	145044	145044	Charley	327	" Do n't say yes , "
145057	145081	145054	145055	Miss Smallweed	514	" for I know what you girls are . Do it without saying it , and then I may begin to believe you . "
145109	145114	145115	145115	she	514	" in you girls , "
145145	145160	145162	145162	Judy	508	" See who it is , and do n't chew when you open it ! "
145220	145232	145234	145236	the snappish Judy	508	" Now ! Who is it , and what 's wanted ? "
145258	145261	145263	145264	Mr. George	515	" Whew ! "
145266	145290	145263	145264	Mr. George	515	" You are hot here . Always a fire , eh ? Well ! Perhaps you do right to get used to one . "
145306	145313	145315	145317	the old gentleman	985	" Ho ! It 's you ! "
145319	145328	145315	145317	the old gentleman	985	" How de do ? How de do ? "
145329	145332	145334	145335	Mr. George	515	" Middling , "
145341	145360	145334	145335	Mr. George	515	" Your granddaughter I have had the honour of seeing before ; my service to you , miss . "
145361	145367	145369	145370	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" This is my grandson , "
145372	145390	145369	145370	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" You ha'n't seen him before . He is in the law and not much at home . "
145391	145419	145421	145422	Mr. George	515	" My service to him , too ! He is like his sister . He is very like his sister . He is devilish like his sister , "
145437	145449	145421	145422	Mr. George	515	" And how does the world use you , Mr. George ? "
145459	145469	145450	145451	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Pretty much as usual . Like a football . "
145778	145790	145791	145791	he	509	" Do you rub your legs to rub life into 'em ? "
145802	145824	145825	145825	he	509	" Why , it 's partly a habit , Mr. George , and - yes - it partly helps the circulation , "
145828	145838	145840	145841	Mr. George	515	" The cir - cu - la - tion ! "
145857	145867	145840	145841	Mr. George	515	" Not much of that , I should think . "
145868	145877	145879	145880	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Truly I 'm old , Mr. George , "
145882	145896	145879	145880	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" But I can carry my years . I 'm older than HER , "
145902	145915	145879	145880	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" and see what she is ? You 're a brimstone chatterer ! "
145925	145930	145932	145933	Mr. George	515	" Unlucky old soul ! "
145942	145993	145995	145996	Mr. George	515	" Do n't scold the old lady . Look at her here , with her poor cap half off her head and her poor hair all in a muddle . Hold up , ma'am . That 's better . There we are ! Think of your mother , Mr. Smallweed , "
146007	146014	145995	145996	Mr. George	515	" if your wife an't enough . "
146015	146027	146028	146030	the old man	1212	" I suppose you were an excellent son , Mr. George ? "
146049	146057	146046	146046	he	515	" Why no . I was n't . "
146058	146065	145995	145996	Mr. George	515	" I am astonished at it . "
146066	146119	146046	146046	he	515	" So am I. I ought to have been a good son , and I think I meant to have been one . But I was n't . I was a thundering bad son , that 's the long and the short of it , and never was a credit to anybody . "
146120	146123	146125	146127	the old man	1212	" Surprising ! "
146129	146132	146125	146127	the old man	1212	" However , "
146137	146220	146133	146134	Mr. George	515	" the less said about it , the better now . Come ! You know the agreement . Always a pipe out of the two months ' interest ! Bosh ! It 's all correct . You need n't be afraid to order the pipe . Here 's the new bill , and here 's the two months ' interest - money , and a devil - and - all of a scrape it is to get it together in my business . "
146396	146434	146377	146377	he	1212	" Afraid to order the pipe ? We are not so mercenary as that , sir . Judy , see directly to the pipe and the glass of cold brandy - and - water for Mr. George . "
146490	146506	146508	146509	Mr. George	515	" And there you sit , I suppose , all the day long , eh ? "
146514	146521	146522	146524	the old man	1212	" Just so , just so , "
146527	146537	146522	146524	the old man	1212	" And do n't you occupy yourself at all ? "
146538	146551	146591	146591	his	1212	" I watch the fire - and the boiling and the roasting - "
146552	146558	146560	146561	Mr. George	515	" When there is any , "
146566	146575	146560	146561	Mr. George	515	" Just so . When there is any . "
146576	146586	146591	146591	his	1212	" Do n't you read or get read to ? "
146598	146627	146591	146591	his	1212	" No , no . We have never been readers in our family . It do n't pay . Stuff . Idleness . Folly . No , no ! "
146628	146640	146642	146643	the visitor	10509	" There 's not much to choose between your two states , "
146669	146673	146657	146657	he	1212	" I say ! "
146679	146684	146657	146657	he	1212	" I hear you . "
146685	146705	146642	146643	the visitor	10509	" You 'll sell me up at last , I suppose , when I am a day in arrear . "
146706	146711	146713	146714	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" My dear friend ! "
146724	146751	146713	146714	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Never ! Never , my dear friend ! But my friend in the city that I got to lend you the money - HE might ! "
146752	146762	146764	146765	Mr. George	515	" Oh ! You ca n't answer for him ? "
146777	146783	146764	146765	Mr. George	515	" You lying old rascal ! "
146784	146813	146713	146714	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" My dear friend , he is not to be depended on . I would n't trust him . He will have his bond , my dear friend . "
146814	146819	146821	146822	Mr. George	515	" Devil doubt him , "
146853	146868	146849	146849	he	515	" How do you come here ! You have n't got the family face . "
146869	146878	146880	146880	Charley	327	" I goes out to work , sir , "
146913	146937	146939	146939	he	515	" You give the house almost a wholesome look . It wants a bit of youth as much as it wants fresh air . "
146970	146983	146939	146939	he	515	" So you think he might be hard upon me , eh ? "
146984	147003	147005	147006	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" I think he might - I am afraid he would . I have known him do it , "
147009	147013	147005	147006	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" twenty times . "
147039	147066	146939	146939	he	515	" Twenty thousand pounds , twenty twenty - pound notes in a money - box , twenty guineas , twenty million twenty per cent , twenty - "
147105	147140	147142	147144	the old man	1212	" You 're a brimstone idiot . You 're a scorpion - a brimstone scorpion ! You 're a sweltering toad . You 're a chattering clattering broomstick witch that ought to be burnt ! "
147151	147164	147142	147144	the old man	1212	" My dear friend , will you shake me up a little ? "
147292	147296	147298	147299	Mr. Smallweed	490	" O Lord ! "
147301	147331	147298	147299	Mr. Smallweed	490	" That 'll do . Thank you , my dear friend , that 'll do . Oh , dear me , I 'm out of breath . O Lord ! "
147382	147407	147418	147420	the old man	1212	" The name of your friend in the city begins with a D , comrade , and you 're about right respecting the bond . "
147408	147416	147418	147420	the old man	1212	" Did you speak , Mr. George ? "
147501	147506	147507	147507	he	1212	" I take it , "
147539	147561	147507	147507	he	1212	" that I am the only man alive or dead either that gets the value of a pipe out of YOU ? "
147562	147565	147567	147569	the old man	1212	" Well , "
147571	147614	147567	147569	the old man	1212	" it 's true that I do n't see company , Mr. George , and that I do n't treat . I ca n't afford to it . But as you , in your pleasant way , made your pipe a condition - "
147615	147652	147507	147507	he	1212	" Why , it 's not for the value of it ; that 's no great thing . It was a fancy to get it out of you . To have something in for my money . "
147653	147664	147666	147667	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Ha ! You 're prudent , prudent , sir ! "
147673	147680	147681	147681	Puff	518	" Very . I always was . "
147683	147700	147701	147701	Puff	518	" It 's a sure sign of my prudence that I ever found the way here . "
147703	147713	147714	147714	Puff	518	" Also , that I am what I am . "
147716	147725	147727	147728	Mr. George	515	" I am well known to be prudent , "
147733	147741	147727	147728	Mr. George	515	" I rose in life that way . "
147742	147757	147758	147759	Mr. George	515	" Do n't he down - hearted , sir . You may rise yet . "
147764	147772	147758	147759	Mr. George	515	" Ha'n't you no relations , now , "
147783	147840	147780	147780	his	509	" who would pay off this little principal or who would lend you a good name or two that I could persuade my friend in the city to make you a further advance upon ? Two good names would be sufficient for my friend in the city . Ha'n't you no such relations , Mr. George ? "
147850	147941	147841	147842	Mr. George	515	" If I had , I should n't trouble them . I have been trouble enough to my belongings in my day . It MAY be a very good sort of penitence in a vagabond , who has wasted the best time of his life , to go back then to decent people that he never was a credit to and live upon them , but it 's not my sort . The best kind of amends then for having gone away is to keep away , in my opinion . "
147942	147950	147952	147953	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" But natural affection , Mr. George , "
147955	147963	147965	147966	Mr. George	515	" For two good names , hey ? "
147976	147986	147965	147966	Mr. George	515	" No . That 's not my sort either . "
148058	148061	148062	148062	he	509	" Ha ! "
148071	148183	148062	148062	he	509	" If you could have traced out the captain , Mr. George , it would have been the making of you . If when you first came here , in consequence of our advertisement in the newspapers - when I say ' our , ' I 'm alluding to the advertisements of my friend in the city , and one or two others who embark their capital in the same way , and are so friendly towards me as sometimes to give me a lift with my little pittance - if at that time you could have helped us , Mr. George , it would have been the making of you . "
148184	148200	148202	148203	Mr. George	515	" I was willing enough to be ' made , ' as you call it , "
148252	148266	148298	148298	his	509	" but on the whole , I am glad I was n't now . "
148267	148283	148285	148286	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Why , Mr. George ? In the name of - of brimstone , why ? "
148308	148315	148298	148298	his	509	" For two reasons , comrade . "
148316	148331	148298	148298	his	509	" And what two reasons , Mr. George ? In the name of the - "
148332	148340	148342	148343	Mr. George	515	" Of our friend in the city ? "
148348	148359	148342	148343	Mr. George	515	" Aye , if you like . What two reasons ? "
148360	148366	148368	148369	Mr. George	515	" In the first place , "
148397	148436	148394	148394	he	515	" you gentlemen took me in . You advertised that Mr. Hawdon Captain Hawdon , if you hold to the saying ' Once a captain , always a captain ' was to hear of something to his advantage . "
148437	148440	148442	148444	the old man	1212	" Well ? "
148449	148452	148454	148455	Mr. George	515	" Well ! "
148460	148486	148454	148455	Mr. George	515	" It would n't have been much to his advantage to have been clapped into prison by the whole bill and judgment trade of London . "
148487	148544	148546	148548	the old man	1212	" How do you know that ? Some of his rich relations might have paid his debts or compounded for 'em . Besides , he had taken US in . He owed us immense sums all round . I would sooner have strangled him than had no return . If I sit here thinking of him , "
148557	148565	148546	148548	the old man	1212	" I want to strangle him now . "
148595	148604	148606	148607	the trooper	3804	" I do n't need to be told , "
148640	148714	148606	148607	the trooper	3804	" that he carried on heavily and went to ruin . I have been at his right hand many a day when he was charging upon ruin full - gallop . I was with him when he was sick and well , rich and poor . I laid this hand upon him after he had run through everything and broken down everything beneath him - when he held a pistol to his head . "
148715	148724	148726	148729	the benevolent old man	3828	" I wish he had let it off , "
148731	148745	148726	148729	the benevolent old man	3828	" and blown his head into as many pieces as he owed pounds ! "
148746	148755	148757	148758	the trooper	3804	" That would have been a smash indeed , "
148761	148811	148757	148758	the trooper	3804	" any way , he had been young , hopeful , and handsome in the days gone by , and I am glad I never found him , when he was neither , to lead to a result so much to his advantage . That 's reason number one . "
148812	148821	148823	148825	the old man	1212	" I hope number two 's as good ? "
148827	148861	148823	148825	the old man	1212	" Why , no . It 's more of a selfish reason . If I had found him , I must have gone to the other world to look . He was there . "
148862	148871	148757	148758	the trooper	3804	" How do you know he was there ? "
148872	148878	148757	148758	the trooper	3804	" He was n't here . "
148879	148889	148823	148825	the old man	1212	" How do you know he was n't here ? "
148890	148902	148904	148905	Mr. George	515	" Do n't lose your temper as well as your money , "
148916	148966	148967	148967	he	515	" He was drowned long before . I am convinced of it . He went over a ship 's side . Whether intentionally or accidentally , I do n't know . Perhaps your friend in the city does . Do you know what that tune is , Mr. Smallweed ? "
148985	148988	148990	148992	the old man	1212	" Tune ! "
148994	149003	148990	148992	the old man	1212	" No . We never have tunes here . "
149004	149069	149108	149109	the trooper	3804	" That 's the Dead March in Saul . They bury soldiers to it , so it 's the natural end of the subject . Now , if your pretty granddaughter - excuse me , miss - will condescend to take care of this pipe for two months , we shall save the cost of one next time . Good evening , Mr. Smallweed ! "
149070	149075	149076	149078	the old man	1212	" My dear friend ! "
149085	149106	149108	149109	the trooper	3804	" So you think your friend in the city will be hard upon me if I fall in a payment ? "
149119	149130	149132	149134	the old man	1212	" My dear friend , I am afraid he will , "
149181	149188	149190	149192	the old gentleman	985	" You 're a damned rogue , "
149206	149221	149190	149192	the old gentleman	985	" But I 'll lime you , you dog , I 'll lime you ! "
149760	149763	149765	149766	the trooper	3804	" Phil ! "
149772	149776	149778	149778	Phil	521	" All right ! "
149785	149790	149778	149778	Phil	521	" Anything been doing ? "
149791	149799	149801	149801	Phil	521	" Flat as ever so much swipes , "
149803	149816	149817	149817	Phil	521	" Five dozen rifle and a dozen pistol . As to aim ! "
149825	149832	149817	149817	Phil	521	" Shut up shop , Phil ! "
149997	150002	149950	149950	He	521	" Phil 's mark . "
150075	150078	150080	150081	the master	1797	" Phil ! "
150102	150114	150080	150081	the master	1797	" You were found in a doorway , were n't you ? "
150115	150118	150120	150120	Phil	521	" Gutter , "
150122	150128	150120	150120	Phil	521	" Watchman tumbled over me . "
150129	150140	150080	150081	the master	1797	" Then vagabondizing came natural to YOU from the beginning . "
150141	150147	150149	150149	Phil	521	" As nat'ral as possible , "
150151	150155	150149	150149	Phil	521	" Good night ! "
150156	150162	150080	150081	the master	1797	" Good night , guv'ner . "
150886	150891	150893	150894	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Now , Snagsby , "
150896	150905	150893	150894	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" to go over this odd story again . "
150906	150913	150982	150983	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" If you please , sir . "
150914	150931	150893	150894	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" You told me when you were so good as to step round here last night - "
150932	150981	150982	150983	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" For which I must ask you to excuse me if it was a liberty , sir ; but I remember that you had taken a sort of an interest in that person , and I thought it possible that you might - just - wish - to - "
151018	151034	151006	151007	Mr. Snagsby	370	" I must ask you to excuse the liberty , sir , I am sure . "
151035	151040	151042	151043	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Not at all , "
151045	151091	151042	151043	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" You told me , Snagsby , that you put on your hat and came round without mentioning your intention to your wife . That was prudent I think , because it 's not a matter of such importance that it requires to be mentioned . "
151092	151097	151099	151100	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Well , sir , "
151102	151191	151099	151100	Mr. Snagsby	370	" you see , my little woman is - not to put too fine a point upon it - inquisitive . She 's inquisitive . Poor little thing , she 's liable to spasms , and it 's good for her to have her mind employed . In consequence of which she employs it - I should say upon every individual thing she can lay hold of , whether it concerns her or not - especially not . My little woman has a very active mind , sir . "
151205	151214	151202	151202	his	370	" Dear me , very fine wine indeed ! "
151215	151226	151228	151229	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Therefore you kept your visit to yourself last night ? "
151231	151238	151228	151229	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" And to - night too ? "
151239	151355	151356	151357	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Yes , sir , and to - night , too . My little woman is at present in - not to put too fine a point on it - in a pious state , or in what she considers such , and attends the Evening Exertions which is the name they go by of a reverend party of the name of Chadband . He has a great deal of eloquence at his command , undoubtedly , but I am not quite favourable to his style myself . That 's neither here nor there . My little woman being engaged in that way made it easier for me to step round in a quiet manner . "
151360	151367	151356	151357	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Fill your glass , Snagsby . "
151368	151378	151383	151383	his	12387	" Thank you , sir , I am sure , "
151388	151397	151356	151357	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" This is wonderfully fine wine , sir ! "
151398	151406	151408	151409	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" It is a rare wine now , "
151411	151418	151408	151409	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" It is fifty years old . "
151419	151447	151356	151357	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Is it indeed , sir ? But I am not surprised to hear it , I am sure . It might be - any age almost . "
151474	151488	151490	151491	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Will you run over , once again , what the boy said ? "
151511	151517	151508	151508	his	271	" With pleasure , sir . "
151564	151581	151554	151554	he	10606	" Dear me , sir , I was n't aware there was any other gentleman present ! "
151755	151762	151767	151767	his	271	" Do n't mind this gentleman , "
151771	151778	151767	151767	his	271	" This is only Mr. Bucket . "
151779	151786	151788	151789	the stationer	12387	" Oh , indeed , sir ? "
151810	151819	151821	151822	the lawyer	1047	" I wanted him to hear this story , "
151824	151858	151821	151822	the lawyer	1047	" because I have half a mind for a reason to know more of it , and he is very intelligent in such things . What do you say to this , Bucket ? "
151859	151944	151821	151822	the lawyer	1047	" It 's very plain , sir . Since our people have moved this boy on , and he 's not to be found on his old lay , if Mr. Snagsby do n't object to go down with me to Tom - all - Alone 's and point him out , we can have him here in less than a couple of hours ' time . I can do it without Mr. Snagsby , of course , but this is the shortest way . "
151945	151955	151957	151958	the lawyer	1047	" Mr. Bucket is a detective officer , Snagsby , "
151962	151969	151971	151972	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Is he indeed , sir ? "
151987	152005	152007	152008	the lawyer	1047	" And if you have no real objection to accompany Mr. Bucket to the place in question , "
152010	152023	152007	152008	the lawyer	1047	" I shall feel obliged to you if you will do so . "
152046	152057	152058	152058	he	1047	" Do n't you be afraid of hurting the boy , "
152061	152157	152058	152058	he	1047	" You wo n't do that . It 's all right as far as the boy 's concerned . We shall only bring him here to ask him a question or so I want to put to him , and he 'll be paid for his trouble and sent away again . It 'll be a good job for him . I promise you , as a man , that you shall see the boy sent away all right . Do n't you be afraid of hurting him ; you an't going to do that . "
152158	152165	152167	152168	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Very well , Mr. Tulkinghorn ! "
152174	152181	152167	152168	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Since that 's the case - "
152182	152192	152194	152194	Bucket	665	" Yes ! And lookee here , Mr. Snagsby , "
152217	152247	152194	152194	Bucket	665	" You 're a man of the world , you know , and a man of business , and a man of sense . That 's what YOU are . "
152248	152263	152268	152268	his	12387	" I am sure I am much obliged to you for your good opinion , "
152273	152276	152268	152268	his	12387	" but - "
152277	152287	152289	152289	Bucket	665	" That 's what YOU are , you know , "
152291	152378	152289	152289	Bucket	665	" Now , it an't necessary to say to a man like you , engaged in your business , which is a business of trust and requires a person to be wide awake and have his senses about him and his head screwed on tight I had an uncle in your business once - it an't necessary to say to a man like you that it 's the best and wisest way to keep little matters like this quiet . Do n't you see ? Quiet ! "
152379	152384	152386	152387	the other	10506	" Certainly , certainly , "
152389	152397	152399	152399	Bucket	665	" I do n't mind telling YOU , "
152407	152455	152399	152399	Bucket	665	" that as far as I can understand it , there seems to be a doubt whether this dead person was n't entitled to a little property , and whether this female has n't been up to some games respecting that property , do n't you see ? "
152456	152459	152461	152462	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Oh ! "
152472	152479	152481	152481	Bucket	665	" Now , what YOU want , "
152497	152516	152481	152481	Bucket	665	" is that every person should have their rights according to justice . That 's what YOU want . "
152517	152522	152524	152525	Mr. Snagsby	370	" To be sure , "
152530	152568	152481	152481	Bucket	665	" On account of which , and at the same time to oblige a - do you call it , in your business , customer or client ? I forget how my uncle used to call it . "
152569	152578	152580	152581	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Why , I generally say customer myself , "
152583	152588	152580	152581	Mr. Snagsby	370	" You 're right ! "
152600	152665	152481	152481	Bucket	665	" - On account of which , and at the same time to oblige a real good customer , you mean to go down with me , in confidence , to Tom - all - Alone 's and to keep the whole thing quiet ever afterwards and never mention it to any one . That 's about your intentions , if I understand you ? "
152666	152677	152679	152680	Mr. Snagsby	370	" You are right , sir . You are right , "
152682	152689	152679	152680	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Then here 's your hat , "
152707	152717	152702	152702	he	3923	" and if you 're ready , I am . "
152746	152768	152770	152770	Bucket	665	" You do n't happen to know a very good sort of person of the name of Gridley , do you ? "
152780	152783	152785	152786	Mr. Snagsby	370	" No , "
152790	152802	152785	152786	Mr. Snagsby	370	" I do n't know anybody of that name . Why ? "
152803	152807	152809	152809	Bucket	665	" Nothing particular , "
152811	152862	152809	152809	Bucket	665	" only having allowed his temper to get a little the better of him and having been threatening some respectable people , he is keeping out of the way of a warrant I have got against him - which it 's a pity that a man of sense should do . "
153250	153260	153262	153262	Bucket	665	" Draw off a bit here , Mr. Snagsby , "
153280	153290	153262	153262	Bucket	665	" Here 's the fever coming up the street ! "
153350	153360	153361	153362	Mr. Bucket	665	" Are those the fever - houses , Darby ? "
153382	153387	153379	153379	Darby	525	" all them are , "
153401	153407	153366	153366	he	665	" have been down by dozens "
153416	153423	153424	153424	Bucket	665	" like sheep with the rot . "
153738	153749	153751	153752	Mr. Bucket	665	" And who have we got here to - night ? "
153766	153783	153761	153761	his	665	" Two drunken men , eh ? And two women ? The men are sound enough , "
153798	153808	153761	153761	his	665	" Are these your good men , my dears ? "
153809	153814	153816	153819	one of the women	3969	" Yes , sir , "
153821	153827	153816	153819	one of the women	3969	" They are our husbands . "
153828	153833	153761	153761	his	665	" Brickmakers , eh ? "
153834	153839	153761	153761	his	665	" Yes , sir . "
153840	153854	153816	153819	one of the women	3969	" What are you doing here ? You do n't belong to London . "
153855	153865	153761	153761	his	665	" No , sir . We belong to Hertfordshire . "
153866	153871	153761	153761	his	665	" Whereabouts in Hertfordshire ? "
153872	153876	153816	153819	one of the women	3969	" Saint Albans . "
153877	153884	153761	153761	his	665	" Come up on the tramp ? "
153885	153919	153761	153761	his	665	" We walked up yesterday . There 's no work down with us at present , but we have done no good by coming here , and shall do none , I expect . "
153920	153931	153933	153934	Mr. Bucket	665	" That 's not the way to do much good , "
153950	153955	153957	153958	the woman	10391	" It an't indeed , "
153963	153972	153957	153958	the woman	10391	" Jenny and me knows it full well . "
154076	154088	154090	154090	Bucket	665	" Why , what age do you call that little creature ? "
154092	154102	154090	154090	Bucket	665	" It looks as if it was born yesterday . "
154143	154154	154156	154157	the woman	10391	" He is not three weeks old yet , sir , "
154159	154165	154156	154157	the woman	10391	" Is he your child ? "
154166	154169	154170	154172	The other woman	3983	" Mine . "
154195	154210	154212	154213	Mr. Bucket	665	" You seem as fond of it as if you were the mother yourself , "
154215	154231	154212	154213	Mr. Bucket	665	" I was the mother of one like it , master , and it died . "
154232	154239	154241	154243	the other woman	3983	" Ah , Jenny , Jenny ! "
154247	154265	154241	154243	the other woman	3983	" Better so . Much better to think of dead than alive , Jenny ! Much better ! "
154266	154279	154212	154213	Mr. Bucket	665	" Why , you an't such an unnatural woman , I hope , "
154284	154293	154212	154213	Mr. Bucket	665	" as to wish your own child dead ? "
154294	154303	154304	154304	she	3983	" God knows you are right , master , "
154307	154334	154304	154304	she	3983	" I am not . I 'd stand between it and death with my own life if I could , as true as any pretty lady . "
154335	154345	154347	154348	Mr. Bucket	665	" Then do n't talk in that wrong manner , "
154353	154360	154347	154348	Mr. Bucket	665	" Why do you do it ? "
154361	154371	154373	154374	the woman	10391	" It 's brought into my head , master , "
154382	154454	154376	154376	her	10391	" when I look down at the child lying so . If it was never to wake no more , you 'd think me mad , I should take on so . I know that very well . I was with Jenny when she lost hers - warn't I , Jenny ? - and I know how she grieved . But look around you at this place . Look at them , "
154463	154504	154376	154376	her	10391	" Look at the boy you 're waiting for , who 's gone out to do me a good turn . Think of the children that your business lays with often and often , and that YOU see grow up ! "
154505	154510	154512	154513	Mr. Bucket	665	" Well , well , "
154515	154542	154512	154513	Mr. Bucket	665	" you train him respectable , and he 'll be a comfort to you , and look after you in your old age , you know . "
154543	154550	154551	154551	she	3988	" I mean to try hard , "
154558	154707	154551	154551	she	3988	" But I have been a - thinking , being over - tired to - night and not well with the ague , of all the many things that 'll come in his way . My master will be against it , and he 'll be beat , and see me beat , and made to fear his home , and perhaps to stray wild . If I work for him ever so much , and ever so hard , there 's no one to help me ; and if he should be turned bad ' spite of all I could do , and the time should come when I should sit by him in his sleep , made hard and changed , an't it likely I should think of him as he lies in my lap now and wish he had died as Jenny 's child died ! "
154708	154713	154715	154715	Jenny	366	" There , there ! "
154717	154731	154736	154736	she	366	" Liz , you 're tired and ill . Let me take him . "
154760	154767	154769	154769	Jenny	366	" It 's my dead child , "
154779	154859	154769	154769	Jenny	366	" that makes me love this child so dear , and it 's my dead child that makes her love it so dear too , as even to think of its being taken away from her now . While she thinks that , I think what fortune would I give to have my darling back . But we mean the same thing , if we knew how to say it , us two mothers does in our poor hearts ! "
154893	154907	154879	154880	Mr. Bucket	665	" Now , what do you say to Toughy ? Will HE do ? "
154908	154913	154915	154916	Mr. Snagsby	370	" That 's Jo , "
154966	154980	154955	154956	Mr. Snagsby	370	" It 's only a job you will be paid for , Jo , "
155008	155017	155019	155020	Mr. Bucket	665	" I have squared it with the lad , "
155024	155042	155019	155020	Mr. Bucket	665	" and it 's all right . Now , Mr. Snagsby , we 're ready for you . "
155074	155083	155066	155066	he	396	" it 's to be all took d'rectly . "
155452	155458	155460	155460	Bucket	665	" What 's the matter ? "
155465	155470	155472	155472	Jo	396	" There she is ! "
155474	155477	155472	155472	Jo	396	" Who ! "
155478	155482	155447	155447	Jo	396	" The lady ! "
155535	155541	155543	155543	Bucket	665	" Now , tell me , "
155546	155556	155543	155543	Bucket	665	" how you know that to be the lady . "
155557	155563	155565	155565	Jo	396	" I know the wale , "
155569	155578	155565	155565	Jo	396	" and the bonnet , and the gownd . "
155579	155590	155592	155592	Bucket	665	" Be quite sure of what you say , Tough , "
155599	155603	155592	155592	Bucket	665	" Look again . "
155604	155618	155620	155620	Jo	396	" I am a - looking as hard as ever I can look , "
155625	155640	155620	155620	Jo	396	" and that there 's the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd . "
155641	155651	155653	155653	Bucket	665	" What about those rings you told me of ? "
155655	155663	155665	155665	Jo	396	" A - sparkling all over here , "
155701	155711	155713	155713	Bucket	665	" Now , what do you say to that ? "
155720	155734	155715	155715	Jo	396	" Not rings a bit like them . Not a hand like that . "
155735	155742	155744	155744	Bucket	665	" What are you talking of ? "
155755	155771	155773	155773	Jo	396	" Hand was a deal whiter , a deal delicater , and a deal smaller , "
155775	155789	155791	155792	Mr. Bucket	665	" Why , you 'll tell me I 'm my own mother next , "
155794	155803	155791	155792	Mr. Bucket	665	" Do you recollect the lady 's voice ? "
155804	155810	155812	155812	Jo	396	" I think I does , "
155818	155852	155814	155815	The figure	4010	" Was it at all like this ? I will speak as long as you like if you are not sure . Was it this voice , or at all like this voice ? "
155860	155865	155853	155853	Jo	396	" Not a bit ! "
155866	155871	155873	155874	that worthy	4015	" Then , what , "
155881	155891	155873	155874	that worthy	4015	" did you say it was the lady for ? "
155892	155895	155897	155897	Jo	396	" Cos , "
155912	155995	155897	155897	Jo	396	" cos that there 's the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd . It is her and it an't her . It an't her hand , nor yet her rings , nor yet her woice . But that there 's the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd , and they 're wore the same way wot she wore 'em , and it 's her height wot she wos , and she giv me a sov'ring and hooked it . "
155996	155999	156001	156002	Mr. Bucket	665	" Well ! "

156182	156202	156204	156204	mademoiselle	406	" You will do me the kindness to remember , sir , that I am not at present placed ? "
156206	156211	156204	156204	mademoiselle	406	" Certainly , certainly ! "
156212	156225	156164	156164	his	271	" And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation ? "
156226	156234	156164	156164	his	271	" By all means , Mademoiselle Hortense . "
156235	156245	156204	156204	mademoiselle	406	" A word from Mr. Tulkinghorn is so powerful . "
156246	156255	156164	156164	his	271	" It shall not be wanting , mademoiselle . "
156256	156268	156164	156164	his	271	" Receive the assurance of my devoted gratitude , dear sir . "
156269	156273	156204	156204	mademoiselle	406	" Good night . "
156321	156326	156164	156164	his	271	" Well , Bucket ? "
156334	156403	156164	156164	his	271	" It 's all squared , you see , as I squared it myself , sir . There an't a doubt that it was the other one with this one 's dress on . The boy was exact respecting colours and everything . Mr. Snagsby , I promised you as a man that he should be sent away all right . Do n't say it was n't done ! "
156404	156413	156415	156416	the stationer	12387	" You have kept your word , sir , "
156418	156444	156415	156416	the stationer	12387	" and if I can be of no further use , Mr. Tulkinghorn , I think , as my little woman will be getting anxious - "
156445	156455	156457	156458	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Thank you , Snagsby , no further use , "
156460	156475	156457	156458	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" I am quite indebted to you for the trouble you have taken already . "
156476	156489	156164	156164	his	271	" Not at all , sir . I wish you good night . "
156490	156497	156499	156500	Mr. Bucket	665	" You see , Mr. Snagsby , "
156517	156579	156499	156500	Mr. Bucket	665	" what I like in you is that you 're a man it 's of no use pumping ; that 's what YOU are . When you know you have done a right thing , you put it away , and it 's done with and gone , and there 's an end of it . That 's what YOU do . "
156580	156592	156594	156595	Mr. Snagsby	370	" That is certainly what I endeavour to do , sir , "
156597	156615	156617	156618	Mr. Bucket	665	" No , you do n't do yourself justice . It an't what you endeavour to do , "
156632	156653	156617	156618	Mr. Bucket	665	" it 's what you DO . That 's what I estimate in a man in your way of business . "
157138	157141	157142	157142	she	2303	" Mademoiselle , "
157170	157195	157142	157142	she	2303	" I have taken a great liberty in coming here , but you know how to excuse it , being so amiable , mademoiselle . "
157196	157202	157203	157203	I	0	" No excuse is necessary , "
157206	157215	157203	157203	I	0	" if you wish to speak to me . "
157216	157242	157243	157243	she	2303	" That is my desire , mademoiselle . A thousand thanks for the permission . I have your leave to speak . Is it not ? "
157252	157255	157243	157243	she	2303	" Certainly , "
157258	157302	157303	157303	Her	2303	" Mademoiselle , you are so amiable ! Listen then , if you please . I have left my Lady . We could not agree . My Lady is so high , so very high . Pardon ! Mademoiselle , you are right ! "
157319	157360	157307	157307	I	0	" It is not for me to come here to complain of my Lady . But I say she is so high , so very high . I will not say a word more . All the world knows that . "
157361	157369	157371	157371	I.	0	" Go on , if you please , "
157372	157430	157371	157371	I.	0	" Assuredly ; mademoiselle , I am thankful for your politeness . Mademoiselle , I have an inexpressible desire to find service with a young lady who is good , accomplished , beautiful . You are good , accomplished , and beautiful as an angel . Ah , could I have the honour of being your domestic ! "
157431	157436	157437	157437	I	0	" I am sorry - "
157440	157450	157451	157451	she	4045	" Do not dismiss me so soon , mademoiselle ! "
157463	157533	157451	157451	she	4045	" Let me hope a moment ! Mademoiselle , I know this service would be more retired than that which I have quitted . Well ! I wish that . I know this service would be less distinguished than that which I have quitted . Well ! I wish that , I know that I should win less , as to wages here . Good . I am content . "
157534	157539	157541	157541	I	0	" I assure you , "
157555	157562	157541	157541	I	0	" that I keep no maid - "
157563	157637	157638	157638	She	4047	" Ah , mademoiselle , but why not ? Why not , when you can have one so devoted to you ! Who would be enchanted to serve you ; who would be so true , so zealous , and so faithful every day ! Mademoiselle , I wish with all my heart to serve you . Do not speak of money at present . Take me as I am . For nothing ! "
157685	157810	157662	157662	she	4047	" Mademoiselle , I come from the South country where we are quick and where we like and dislike very strong . My Lady was too high for me ; I was too high for her . It is done - past - finished ! Receive me as your domestic , and I will serve you well . I will do more for you than you figure to yourself now . Chut ! Mademoiselle , I will - no matter , I will do my utmost possible in all things . If you accept my service , you will not repent it . Mademoiselle , you will not repent it , and I will serve you well . You do n't know how well ! "
157888	157928	157884	157884	her	4048	" Hey , mademoiselle , I have received my answer ! I am sorry of it . But I must go elsewhere and seek what I have not found here . Will you graciously let me kiss your hand ? "
157957	157973	157974	157974	she	4048	" I fear I surprised you , mademoiselle , on the day of the storm ? "
157990	157998	157999	157999	she	4048	" I took an oath , mademoiselle , "
158004	158030	157999	157999	she	4048	" and I wanted to stamp it on my mind so that I might keep it faithfully . And I will ! Adieu , mademoiselle ! "
158543	158548	158550	158550	I	0	" Well , Richard , "
158563	158573	158550	158550	I	0	" are you beginning to feel more settled now ? "
158574	158582	158584	158584	Richard	295	" Oh , yes , my dear ! "
158586	158593	158584	158584	Richard	295	" I 'm all right enough . "
158594	158598	158600	158600	I.	0	" But settled ? "
158601	158609	158611	158611	Richard	295	" How do you mean , settled ? "
158617	158623	158625	158625	I.	0	" Settled in the law , "
158626	158631	158633	158633	Richard	295	" Oh , aye , "
158635	158642	158633	158633	Richard	295	" I 'm all right enough . "
158643	158653	158611	158611	Richard	295	" You said that before , my dear Richard . "
158654	158689	158633	158633	Richard	295	" And you do n't think it 's an answer , eh ? Well ! Perhaps it 's not . Settled ? You mean , do I feel as if I were settling down ? "
158690	158693	158633	158633	Richard	295	" Yes . "
158694	158708	158710	158710	Richard	295	" Why , no , I ca n't say I am settling down , "
158714	158717	158710	158710	Richard	295	" down , "
158725	158757	158710	158710	Richard	295	" because one ca n't settle down while this business remains in such an unsettled state . When I say this business , of course I mean the - forbidden subject . "
158758	158771	158773	158773	I.	0	" Do you think it will ever be in a settled state ? "
158774	158782	158784	158784	Richard	295	" Not the least doubt of it , "
158809	158926	158796	158796	Richard	295	" My dear Esther , I understand you , and I wish to heaven I were a more constant sort of fellow . I do n't mean constant to Ada , for I love her dearly - better and better every day - but constant to myself . Somehow , I mean something that I ca n't very well express , but you 'll make it out . If I were a more constant sort of fellow , I should have held on either to Badger or to Kenge and Carboy like grim death , and should have begun to be steady and systematic by this time , and should n't be in debt , and - "
158927	158935	158800	158800	his	4064	" ARE you in debt , Richard ? "
158936	158939	158941	158941	Richard	295	" Yes , "
158943	158985	158941	158941	Richard	295	" I am a little so , my dear . Also , I have taken rather too much to billiards and that sort of thing . Now the murder 's out ; you despise me , Esther , do n't you ? "
158986	158993	158995	158995	I.	4065	" You know I do n't , "
158996	159009	159010	159010	he	4066	" You are kinder to me than I often am to myself , "
159013	159153	159010	159010	he	4066	" My dear Esther , I am a very unfortunate dog not to be more settled , but how CAN I be more settled ? If you lived in an unfinished house , you could n't settle down in it ; if you were condemned to leave everything you undertook unfinished , you would find it hard to apply yourself to anything ; and yet that 's my unhappy case . I was born into this unfinished contention with all its chances and changes , and it began to unsettle me before I quite knew the difference between a suit at law and a suit of clothes ; and it has gone on unsettling me ever since ; and here I am now , conscious sometimes that I am but a worthless fellow to love my confiding cousin Ada . "
159177	159182	159184	159184	I.	4069	" Oh , Richard ! "
159185	159209	159184	159184	I.	4069	" Do not be so moved . You have a noble nature , and Ada 's love may make you worthier every day . "
159210	159217	159218	159218	he	4068	" I know , my dear , "
159225	159361	159218	159218	he	4068	" I know all that . You must n't mind my being a little soft now , for I have had all this upon my mind for a long time , and have often meant to speak to you , and have sometimes wanted opportunity and sometimes courage . I know what the thought of Ada ought to do for me , but it does n't do it . I am too unsettled even for that . I love her most devotedly , and yet I do her wrong , in doing myself wrong , every day and hour . But it ca n't last for ever . We shall come on for a final hearing and get judgment in our favour , and then you and Ada shall see what I can really be ! "
159401	159421	159422	159422	he	4070	" I have looked well into the papers , Esther . I have been deep in them for months , "
159432	159503	159422	159422	he	4070	" and you may rely upon it that we shall come out triumphant . As to years of delay , there has been no want of them , heaven knows ! And there is the greater probability of our bringing the matter to a speedy close ; in fact , it 's on the paper now . It will be all right at last , and then you shall see ! "
159537	159549	159550	159550	he	4070	" There again ! I think not at all , Esther , "
159556	159618	159620	159620	Richard	295	" I fancy I have had enough of it . Having worked at Jarndyce and Jarndyce like a galley slave , I have slaked my thirst for the law and satisfied myself that I should n't like it . Besides , I find it unsettles me more and more to be so constantly upon the scene of action . So what , "
159628	159637	159620	159620	Richard	295	" do I naturally turn my thoughts to ? "
159638	159644	159646	159646	I.	4071	" I ca n't imagine , "
159647	159654	159656	159656	Richard	295	" Do n't look so serious , "
159658	159749	159656	159656	Richard	295	" because it 's the best thing I can do , my dear Esther , I am certain . It 's not as if I wanted a profession for life . These proceedings will come to a termination , and then I am provided for . No . I look upon it as a pursuit which is in its nature more or less unsettled , and therefore suited to my temporary condition - I may say , precisely suited . What is it that I naturally turn my thoughts to ? "
159759	159762	159764	159764	Richard	295	" What , "
159773	159778	159764	159764	Richard	295	" but the army ! "
159779	159783	159785	159785	I.	0	" The army ? "
159786	159813	159815	159815	Richard	295	" The army , of course . What I have to do is to get a commission ; and - there I am , you know ! "
160187	160198	160200	160200	Caddy	304	" Prince has a pupil over the way , Esther , "
160202	160244	160200	160200	Caddy	304	" and got the key for us . So if you will walk round and round here with me , we can lock ourselves in and I can tell you comfortably what I wanted to see your dear good face about . "
160245	160252	160254	160254	I.	0	" Very well , my dear , "
160255	160261	160254	160254	I.	0	" Nothing could be better . "
160297	160303	160305	160305	Caddy	304	" You see , Esther , "
160314	160398	160305	160305	Caddy	304	" after you spoke to me about its being wrong to marry without Ma 's knowledge , or even to keep Ma long in the dark respecting our engagement - though I do n't believe Ma cares much for me , I must say - I thought it right to mention your opinions to Prince . In the first place because I want to profit by everything you tell me , and in the second place because I have no secrets from Prince . "
160399	160407	160273	160273	she	304	" I hope he approved , Caddy ? "
160408	160438	160305	160305	Caddy	304	" Oh , my dear ! I assure you he would approve of anything you could say . You have no idea what an opinion he has of you ! "
160439	160442	160305	160305	Caddy	304	" Indeed ! "
160443	160456	160458	160458	Caddy	304	" Esther , it 's enough to make anybody but me jealous , "
160466	160506	160463	160463	her	304	" but it only makes me joyful , for you are the first friend I ever had , and the best friend I ever can have , and nobody can respect and love you too much to please me . "
160507	160514	160516	160516	I	0	" Upon my word , Caddy , "
160518	160538	160516	160516	I	0	" you are in the general conspiracy to keep me in a good humour . Well , my dear ? "
160539	160549	160551	160551	Caddy	304	" Well ! I am going to tell you , "
160561	160586	160554	160554	her	304	" So we talked a good deal about it , and so I said to Prince , ' Prince , as Miss Summerson - ' "
160587	160599	160463	160463	her	304	" I hope you did n't say ' Miss Summerson ' ? "
160600	160607	160609	160609	Caddy	304	" No . I did n't ! "
160620	160728	160609	160609	Caddy	304	" I said , ' Esther . ' I said to Prince , ' As Esther is decidedly of that opinion , Prince , and has expressed it to me , and always hints it when she writes those kind notes , which you are so fond of hearing me read to you , I am prepared to disclose the truth to Ma whenever you think proper . And I think , Prince , ' said I , ' that Esther thinks that I should be in a better , and truer , and more honourable position altogether if you did the same to your papa . ' "
160729	160735	160737	160737	I.	4082	" Yes , my dear , "
160738	160745	160757	160757	Caddy	304	" Esther certainly does think so . "
160746	160755	160757	160757	Caddy	304	" So I was right , you see ! "
160759	160861	160863	160863	Caddy	304	" Well ! This troubled Prince a good deal , not because he had the least doubt about it , but because he is so considerate of the feelings of old Mr. Turveydrop ; and he had his apprehensions that old Mr. Turveydrop might break his heart , or faint away , or be very much overcome in some affecting manner or other if he made such an announcement . He feared old Mr. Turveydrop might consider it undutiful and might receive too great a shock . For old Mr. Turveydrop 's deportment is very beautiful , you know , Esther , "
160865	160873	160863	160863	Caddy	304	" and his feelings are extremely sensitive . "
160874	160881	160939	160939	Caddy	304	" Are they , my dear ? "
160882	160914	160915	160915	Caddy	304	" Oh , extremely sensitive . Prince says so . Now , this has caused my darling child - I did n't mean to use the expression to you , Esther , "
160924	160934	160935	160935	I	0	" but I generally call Prince my darling child . "
160948	160956	160939	160939	Caddy	304	" This has caused him , Esther - "
160957	160964	160939	160939	Caddy	304	" Caused whom , my dear ? "
160965	160972	160974	160974	Caddy	304	" Oh , you tiresome thing ! "
160985	161081	161083	161083	Caddy	304	" My darling child , if you insist upon it ! This has caused him weeks of uneasiness and has made him delay , from day to day , in a very anxious manner . At last he said to me , ' Caddy , if Miss Summerson , who is a great favourite with my father , could be prevailed upon to be present when I broke the subject , I think I could do it . ' So I promised I would ask you . And I made up my mind , besides , "
161092	161154	161083	161083	Caddy	304	" that if you consented , I would ask you afterwards to come with me to Ma . This is what I meant when I said in my note that I had a great favour and a great assistance to beg of you . And if you thought you could grant it , Esther , we should both be very grateful . "
161155	161162	161164	161164	I	0	" Let me see , Caddy , "
161170	161207	161164	161164	I	0	" Really , I think I could do a greater thing than that if the need were pressing . I am at your service and the darling child 's , my dear , whenever you like . "
161473	161482	161495	161495	his	444	" Father , Miss Summerson ; Miss Jellyby . "
161483	161488	161495	161495	his	444	" Charmed ! Enchanted ! "
161500	161504	161495	161495	his	444	" Permit me ! "
161508	161512	161495	161495	his	444	" Be seated ! "
161521	161524	161495	161495	his	444	" Overjoyed ! "
161531	161540	161542	161542	himself	444	" My little retreat is made a paradise . "
161553	161562	161564	161564	he	444	" Again you find us , Miss Summerson , "
161566	161657	161564	161564	he	444	" using our little arts to polish , polish ! Again the sex stimulates us and rewards us by the condescension of its lovely presence . It is much in these times and we have made an awfully degenerating business of it since the days of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent - my patron , if I may presume to say so to experience that deportment is not wholly trodden under foot by mechanics . That it can yet bask in the smile of beauty , my dear madam . "
161677	161682	161684	161685	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" My dear son , "
161687	161702	161684	161685	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" you have four schools this afternoon . I would recommend a hasty sandwich . "
161703	161709	161711	161711	Prince	444	" Thank you , father , "
161713	161742	161711	161711	Prince	444	" I will be sure to be punctual . My dear father , may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say ? "
161743	161747	161749	161750	the model	4095	" Good heaven ! "
161769	161783	161749	161750	the model	4095	" What is this ? Is this lunacy ! Or what is this ? "
161784	161787	161789	161789	Prince	444	" Father , "
161794	161806	161749	161750	the model	4095	" I love this young lady , and we are engaged . "
161807	161810	161812	161813	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" Engaged ! "
161828	161840	161812	161813	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" An arrow launched at my brain by my own child ! "
161841	161852	161854	161854	Prince	444	" We have been engaged for some time , father , "
161856	161900	161854	161854	Prince	444	" and Miss Summerson , hearing of it , advised that we should declare the fact to you and was so very kind as to attend on the present occasion . Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you , father . "
161907	161920	161922	161923	his son	11512	" No , pray do n't ! Pray do n't , father , "
161925	161947	161948	161949	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you , and our first desire is to consider your comfort . "
161952	161961	161948	161949	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" No , pray do n't , father ! "
161966	161969	161971	161972	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" Boy , "
161974	162002	161971	161972	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" it is well that your sainted mother is spared this pang . Strike deep , and spare not . Strike home , sir , strike home ! "
162003	162012	162014	162014	Prince	444	" Pray do n't say so , father , "
162019	162088	162095	162096	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" It goes to my heart . I do assure you , father , that our first wish and intention is to consider your comfort . Caroline and I do not forget our duty - what is my duty is Caroline 's , as we have often said together - and with your approval and consent , father , we will devote ourselves to making your life agreeable . "
162089	162093	162095	162096	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" Strike home , "
162098	162102	162095	162096	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" Strike home ! "
162114	162119	162121	162121	Prince	444	" My dear father , "
162123	162247	162121	162121	Prince	444	" we well know what little comforts you are accustomed to and have a right to , and it will always be our study and our pride to provide those before anything . If you will bless us with your approval and consent , father , we shall not think of being married until it is quite agreeable to you ; and when we ARE married , we shall always make you - of course - our first consideration . You must ever be the head and master here , father ; and we feel how truly unnatural it would be in us if we failed to know it or if we failed to exert ourselves in every possible way to please you . "
162278	162282	162284	162285	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" My son ! "
162287	162301	162302	162302	His	444	" My children ! I can not resist your prayer . Be happy ! "
162339	162343	162345	162346	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" My children , "
162371	162396	162356	162356	she	304	" My son and daughter , your happiness shall be my care . I will watch over you . You shall always live with me "
162410	162436	162356	162356	she	304	" this house is henceforth as much yours as mine ; consider it your home . May you long live to share it with me ! "
162479	162486	162488	162489	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" For myself , my children , "
162491	162601	162488	162489	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" I am falling into the sear and yellow leaf , and it is impossible to say how long the last feeble traces of gentlemanly deportment may linger in this weaving and spinning age . But , so long , I will do my duty to society and will show myself , as usual , about town . My wants are few and simple . My little apartment here , my few essentials for the toilet , my frugal morning meal , and my little dinner will suffice . I charge your dutiful affection with the supply of these requirements , and I charge myself with all the rest . "
162611	162615	162617	162618	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" My son , "
162620	162763	162617	162618	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" for those little points in which you are deficient - points of deportment , which are born with a man , which may be improved by cultivation , but can never be originated - you may still rely on me . I have been faithful to my post since the days of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent , and I will not desert it now . No , my son . If you have ever contemplated your father 's poor position with a feeling of pride , you may rest assured that he will do nothing to tarnish it . For yourself , Prince , whose character is different we can not be all alike , nor is it advisable that we should , work , be industrious , earn money , and extend the connexion as much as possible . "
162764	162781	162783	162783	Prince	444	" That you may depend I will do , dear father , with all my heart , "
162785	162793	162795	162796	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" I have no doubt of it , "
162798	162873	162795	162796	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" Your qualities are not shining , my dear child , but they are steady and useful . And to both of you , my children , I would merely observe , in the spirit of a sainted wooman on whose path I had the happiness of casting , I believe , SOME ray of light , take care of the establishment , take care of my simple wants , and bless you both ! "
163199	163205	163206	163206	she	4116	" Ah ! Miss Summerson ! "
163211	163241	163206	163206	she	4116	" I was thinking of something so different ! I hope you are well . I am happy to see you . Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Clare quite well ? "
163253	163262	163264	163265	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" Why , not quite , my dear , "
163271	163341	163264	163265	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" He has been unfortunate in his affairs and is a little out of spirits . Happily for me , I am so much engaged that I have no time to think about it . We have , at the present moment , one hundred and seventy families , Miss Summerson , averaging five persons in each , either gone or going to the left bank of the Niger . "
163374	163384	163386	163387	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" You have brought Caddy back , I see , "
163395	163424	163386	163387	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" It has become quite a novelty to see her here . She has almost deserted her old employment and in fact obliges me to employ a boy . "
163425	163432	163434	163434	Caddy	304	" I am sure , Ma - "
163436	163443	163444	163445	her mother	1536	" Now you know , Caddy , "
163449	163472	163444	163445	her mother	1536	" that I DO employ a boy , who is now at his dinner . What is the use of your contradicting ? "
163473	163483	163485	163485	Caddy	304	" I was not going to contradict , Ma , "
163487	163509	163485	163485	Caddy	304	" I was only going to say that surely you would n't have me be a mere drudge all my life . "
163510	163517	163519	163520	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" I believe , my dear , "
163542	163603	163539	163539	she	298	" that you have a business example before you in your mother . Besides . A mere drudge ? If you had any sympathy with the destinies of the human race , it would raise you high above any such idea . But you have none . I have often told you , Caddy , you have no such sympathy . "
163604	163617	163539	163539	she	298	" Not if it 's Africa , Ma , I have not . "
163618	163639	163641	163642	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" Of course you have not . Now , if I were not happily so much engaged , Miss Summerson , "
163666	163707	163646	163646	her	298	" this would distress and disappoint me . But I have so much to think of , in connexion with Borrioboola - Gha and it is so necessary I should concentrate myself that there is my remedy , you see . "
163756	163759	163760	163760	I	0	" Perhaps , "
163763	163776	163760	163760	I	0	" you will wonder what has brought me here to interrupt you . "
163777	163787	163789	163790	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" I am always delighted to see Miss Summerson , "
163800	163805	163807	163807	she	298	" Though I wish , "
163822	163823	163807	163807	she	298	" "
163830	163834	163828	163828	Caddy	304	" said I , "
163870	163871	163872	163872	Caddy	304	" "
163874	163896	163872	163872	Caddy	304	" said Mrs. Jellyby , pausing for a moment in her occupation and then serenely pursuing it after shaking her head , "
163906	163937	163938	163938	Ma	312	" Caddy untied the strings of her bonnet , took her bonnet off , and letting it dangle on the floor by the strings , and crying heartily , said , "
163944	163945	163940	163940	I	0	" "
163952	163969	163948	163948	you	304	" observed Mrs. Jellyby with an abstracted air as she looked over the dispatch last opened ; "
163976	163977	163948	163948	you	304	" "
163984	163988	163982	163982	Ma	312	" sobbed Caddy , "
164042	164060	164061	164061	You	4128	" sobbed Caddy , quite forgetful of her general complainings and of everything but her natural affection . "
164068	164074	164061	164061	You	4128	" observed Mrs. Jellyby serenely , "
164166	164167	164168	164168	Ma	312	" "
164178	164182	164183	164183	Caddy	304	" sobbed Caddy . "
164187	164200	164205	164205	you	304	" returned Mrs. Jellyby , opening another letter with the greatest complacency . "
164299	164324	164421	164421	Caddy	304	" repeated Mrs. Jellyby in a calm clear voice , and with an agreeable smile , as she opened more letters and sorted them . "
164329	164392	164421	164421	Caddy	304	" I was so unprepared for the perfect coolness of this reception , though I might have expected it , that I did not know what to say . Caddy seemed equally at a loss . Mrs. Jellyby continued to open and sort letters and to repeat occasionally in quite a charming tone of voice and with a smile of perfect composure , "
164397	164398	164421	164421	Caddy	304	" "
164404	164411	164399	164399	I	0	" sobbed poor Caddy at last , "
164417	164418	164412	164412	you	312	" "
164430	164435	164458	164458	Ma	11449	" returned Mrs. Jellyby , "
164452	164453	164442	164442	I	0	" "
164470	164474	164460	164460	you	312	" said Caddy . "
164488	164493	164495	164497	a degenerate child	4140	" said Mrs. Jellyby ; "
164539	164550	164537	164537	Caddy	304	" said Mrs. Jellyby , for Caddy was kissing her , "
164576	164600	164601	164601	You	304	" I thought I could not do better than take my leave ; I was detained for a moment by Caddy 's saying , "
164615	164616	164613	164613	Ma	312	" "
164624	164637	164639	164639	you	304	" cried Mrs. Jellyby , who had relapsed into that distant contemplation , "
164646	164647	164648	164648	Him	1293	" "
164652	164653	164648	164648	Him	1293	" "
164658	164670	164656	164656	Caddy	304	" said Mrs. Jellyby , quite weary of such little matters . "
164773	165321	165350	165350	miss	9656	" I was not surprised by Caddy 's being in low spirits when we went downstairs , or by her sobbing afresh on my neck , or by her saying she would far rather have been scolded than treated with such indifference , or by her confiding to me that she was so poor in clothes that how she was ever to be married creditably she did n't know . I gradually cheered her up by dwelling on the many things she would do for her unfortunate father and for Peepy when she had a home of her own ; and finally we went downstairs into the damp dark kitchen , where Peepy and his little brothers and sisters were grovelling on the stone floor and where we had such a game of play with them that to prevent myself from being quite torn to pieces I was obliged to fall back on my fairy - tales . From time to time I heard loud voices in the parlour overhead , and occasionally a violent tumbling about of the furniture . The last effect I am afraid was caused by poor Mr. Jellyby 's breaking away from the dining - table and making rushes at the window with the intention of throwing himself into the area whenever he made any new attempt to understand his affairs . As I rode quietly home at night after the day 's bustle , I thought a good deal of Caddy 's engagement and felt confirmed in my hopes in spite of the elder Mr. Turveydrop that she would be the happier and better for it . And if there seemed to be but a slender chance of her and her husband ever finding out what the model of deportment really was , why that was all for the best too , and who would wish them to be wiser ? I did not wish them to be any wiser and indeed was half ashamed of not entirely believing in him myself . And I looked up at the stars , and thought about travellers in distant countries and the stars THEY saw , and hoped I might always be so blest and happy as to be useful to some one in my small way . They were so glad to see me when I got home , as they always were , that I could have sat down and cried for joy if that had not been a method of making myself disagreeable . Everybody in the house , from the lowest to the highest , showed me such a bright face of welcome , and spoke so cheerily , and was so happy to do anything for me , that I suppose there never was such a fortunate little creature in the world . We got into such a chatty state that night , through Ada and my guardian drawing me out to tell them all about Caddy , that I went on prose , prose , prosing for a length of time . At last I got up to my own room , quite red to think how I had been holding forth , and then I heard a soft tap at my door . So I said , "
165325	165345	165350	165350	miss	9656	" and there came in a pretty little girl , neatly dressed in mourning , who dropped a curtsy . "
165352	165362	165347	165347	you	4145	" said the little girl in a soft voice , "
165367	165368	165347	165347	you	4145	" "
165375	165389	165372	165372	you	0	" said I , stooping down in astonishment and giving her a kiss . "
165400	165401	165398	165398	Charley	327	" "
165408	165417	165403	165403	you	4145	" pursued Charley in the same soft voice , "
165423	165424	165425	165425	Charley	327	" "
165427	165428	165425	165425	Charley	327	" "
165448	165464	165443	165444	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" I sat down with my hand on Charley 's neck and looked at Charley . "
165470	165487	165468	165468	miss	9656	" says Charley , clapping her hands , with the tears starting down her dimpled cheeks , "
165595	165596	165597	165597	I	0	" "
165605	165606	165603	165603	Charley	327	" "
165618	165622	165603	165603	Charley	327	" says Charley . "
165678	165686	165676	165676	miss	9656	" cried Charley with a heaving heart , "
165698	165699	165688	165688	I	0	" "
165712	165713	165702	165702	Charley	327	" "

165754	165755	165752	165752	Charley	327	" "
165815	165859	165806	165806	Tom	469	" Charley dried her eyes and entered on her functions , going in her matronly little way about and about the room and folding up everything she could lay her hands upon . Presently Charley came creeping back to my side and said , "
165872	165878	165806	165806	Tom	469	" And I said again , "
165887	165893	165885	165885	Charley	534	" And Charley said again , "
165905	166280	165899	165899	I	0	" And so , after all , I did cry for joy indeed , and so did she . CHAPTER XXIV An Appeal Case As soon as Richard and I had held the conversation of which I have given an account , Richard communicated the state of his mind to Mr. Jarndyce . I doubt if my guardian were altogether taken by surprise when he received the representation , though it caused him much uneasiness and disappointment . He and Richard were often closeted together , late at night and early in the morning , and passed whole days in London , and had innumerable appointments with Mr. Kenge , and laboured through a quantity of disagreeable business . While they were thus employed , my guardian , though he underwent considerable inconvenience from the state of the wind and rubbed his head so constantly that not a single hair upon it ever rested in its right place , was as genial with Ada and me as at any other time , but maintained a steady reserve on these matters . And as our utmost endeavours could only elicit from Richard himself sweeping assurances that everything was going on capitally and that it really was all right at last , our anxiety was not much relieved by him . We learnt , however , as the time went on , that a new application was made to the Lord Chancellor on Richard 's behalf as an infant and a ward , and I do n't know what , and that there was a quantity of talking , and that the Lord Chancellor described him in open court as a vexatious and capricious infant , and that the matter was adjourned and readjourned , and referred , and reported on , and petitioned about until Richard began to doubt as he told us whether , if he entered the army at all , it would not be as a veteran of seventy or eighty years of age . At last an appointment was made for him to see the Lord Chancellor again in his private room , and there the Lord Chancellor very seriously reproved him for trifling with time and not knowing his mind - "
166289	166293	166286	166286	I	0	" said Richard , "
166298	166523	166286	166286	I	0	" - and at last it was settled that his application should be granted . His name was entered at the Horse Guards as an applicant for an ensign 's commission ; the purchase - money was deposited at an agent 's ; and Richard , in his usual characteristic way , plunged into a violent course of military study and got up at five o'clock every morning to practise the broadsword exercise . Thus , vacation succeeded term , and term succeeded vacation . We sometimes heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce as being in the paper or out of the paper , or as being to be mentioned , or as being to be spoken to ; and it came on , and it went off . Richard , who was now in a professor 's house in London , was able to be with us less frequently than before ; my guardian still maintained the same reserve ; and so time passed until the commission was obtained and Richard received directions with it to join a regiment in Ireland . He arrived post - haste with the intelligence one evening , and had a long conference with my guardian . Upwards of an hour elapsed before my guardian put his head into the room where Ada and I were sitting and said , "
166530	166558	166559	166559	Rick	319	" We went in and found Richard , whom we had last seen in high spirits , leaning on the chimney - piece looking mortified and angry . "
166565	166570	166563	166563	Ada	294	" said Mr. Jarndyce , "
166591	166592	166582	166582	Rick	319	" "
166602	166606	166593	166593	You	0	" said Richard . "

166650	166655	166642	166642	sir	9569	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "

166687	166699	166679	166679	you	0	" returned Richard in a fiery way , but yet respectfully , "
166711	166712	166713	166713	I	0	" "
166725	166737	166718	166718	my	0	" observed Mr. Jarndyce with the sweetest cheerfulness and good humour , "
166789	166810	166778	166778	you	0	" Ada had turned so pale that he made her sit down in his reading- chair and sat beside her . "
166818	166822	166778	166778	you	0	" he said , "
166859	166860	166861	166861	I	0	" "
166869	166876	166861	166861	I	0	" replied Ada with a smile , "
166885	166886	166888	166888	you	9610	" "
166921	166939	166940	166940	you	9610	" putting his hand on hers as it lay on the side of the easy - chair , "
166961	166962	166950	166952	the little woman	11440	" "
166983	166984	166980	166981	cousin John	494	" "
166991	166995	166985	166985	I	0	" said Richard . "
167003	167007	166997	166997	I	0	" said Ada . "
167028	167045	167013	167013	I	0	" returned my guardian , his face irradiated by the gentleness and honour of his heart . "
167097	167098	167102	167102	I	0	" "
167127	167131	167120	167120	I	0	" said Richard , "
167138	167139	167140	167140	Rick	319	" "
167144	167176	167140	167140	Rick	319	" cried my guardian with a sudden terror in his manner , and in an altered voice , and putting up his hands as if he would have stopped his ears . "
167233	167276	167277	167277	Ada	294	" We were all startled by the fervour of this warning . Richard bit his lip and held his breath , and glanced at me as if he felt , and knew that I felt too , how much he needed it . "
167282	167291	167277	167277	Ada	294	" said Mr. Jarndyce , recovering his cheerfulness , "
167409	167410	167392	167392	I	0	" "
167419	167423	167425	167425	you	9569	" returned Richard , "
167441	167442	167433	167433	you	9569	" "
167460	167461	167454	167454	I	0	" "
167471	167475	167464	167464	I	0	" retorted Richard . "
167482	167483	167479	167479	I	0	" "
167507	167518	167496	167496	I	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce in a cordial and encouraging manner . "
167593	167594	167595	167595	You	9569	" "
167604	167608	167595	167595	You	9569	" said Richard . "
167619	167620	167621	167621	My	0	" "
167625	167630	167621	167621	My	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce , "
167716	167717	167723	167723	sir	9569	" "
167725	167730	167723	167723	sir	9569	" returned Richard hastily . "
167749	167750	167742	167742	You	319	" "
167772	167773	167774	167774	You	319	" "
167781	167782	167774	167774	You	319	" "
167792	167798	167790	167790	you	1714	" said Mr. Jarndyce kindly . "
167853	167865	167866	167866	I	0	" Richard gave an anxious glance at Ada but said nothing . "
167880	167885	167866	167866	I	0	" said Mr. Jarndyce , "
167961	167967	167948	167948	you	1714	" A long silence succeeded . "
167971	167985	167968	167969	Cousin Richard	535	" said Ada then , raising her blue eyes tenderly to his face , "
168054	168062	168044	168044	I	0	" said Ada , a little confused , "
168204	168219	168226	168226	Richard	535	" said Ada , going up to him and giving him her trembling hand , "
168248	168633	168234	168234	I	0	" It was strange to me that Richard should not be able to forgive my guardian for entertaining the very same opinion of him which he himself had expressed of himself in much stronger terms to me . But it was certainly the case . I observed with great regret that from this hour he never was as free and open with Mr. Jarndyce as he had been before . He had every reason given him to be so , but he was not ; and solely on his side , an estrangement began to arise between them . In the business of preparation and equipment he soon lost himself , and even his grief at parting from Ada , who remained in Hertfordshire while he , Mr. Jarndyce , and I went up to London for a week . He remembered her by fits and starts , even with bursts of tears , and at such times would confide to me the heaviest self- reproaches . But in a few minutes he would recklessly conjure up some undefinable means by which they were both to be made rich and happy for ever , and would become as gay as possible . It was a busy time , and I trotted about with him all day long , buying a variety of things of which he stood in need . Of the things he would have bought if he had been left to his own ways I say nothing . He was perfectly confidential with me , and often talked so sensibly and feelingly about his faults and his vigorous resolutions , and dwelt so much upon the encouragement he derived from these conversations that I could never have been tired if I had tried . There used , in that week , to come backward and forward to our lodging to fence with Richard a person who had formerly been a cavalry soldier ; he was a fine bluff - looking man , of a frank free bearing , with whom Richard had practised for some months . I heard so much about him , not only from Richard , but from my guardian too , that I was purposely in the room with my work one morning after breakfast when he came . "
168640	168653	168637	168638	Mr. George	515	" said my guardian , who happened to be alone with me . "
168678	168711	168663	168664	Miss Summerson	283	" He sat down , a little disconcerted by my presence , I thought , and without looking at me , drew his heavy sunburnt hand across and across his upper lip . "
168720	168725	168712	168712	You	515	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "
168731	168735	168729	168729	sir	9569	" he replied . "
168757	168758	168748	168748	I	0	" "
168772	168777	168784	168784	sir	9569	" said Mr. Jarndyce . "
168799	168800	168786	168786	I	0	" "
168820	168825	168811	168812	a swordsman	4218	" said my guardian . "
168831	168847	168829	168829	sir	9569	" he replied , folding his arms upon his broad chest and looking very large . "
168867	168868	168860	168860	he	9569	" "
168877	168882	168883	168883	He	9569	" said my guardian . "
168913	168926	168907	168909	some young lady	4221	" His bright dark eyes glanced at me for the first time . "
168942	168948	168939	168940	Mr. George	515	" said I , laughing , "
168956	168972	168950	168950	you	9569	" He reddened a little through his brown and made me a trooper 's bow . "
168988	168989	168983	168986	one of the roughs	4223	" "
168994	168997	168983	168986	one of the roughs	4223	" said I. "
169005	169028	168998	168998	I	0	" If he had not looked at me before , he looked at me now in three or four quick successive glances . "
169036	169049	168998	168998	I	0	" he said to my guardian with a manly kind of diffidence , "
169064	169065	169051	169051	you	9656	" "
169069	169070	169066	169067	Miss Summerson	283	" "
169074	169084	169071	169072	Miss Summerson	283	" he repeated , and looked at me again . "
169091	169095	169086	169086	you	0	" I asked . "
169116	169117	169113	169113	you	0	" "
169122	169156	169113	169113	you	0	" I returned , raising my head from my work to look at him ; and there was something so genuine in his speech and manner that I was glad of the opportunity . "
169163	169164	169157	169157	I	0	" "
169171	169189	169167	169167	I	0	" he returned , meeting my look with the fullness of his dark eyes and broad forehead . "
169202	169227	169167	169167	I	0	" His once more reddening through his brown and being disconcerted by his efforts to remember the association brought my guardian to his relief . "
169236	169237	169229	169229	you	0	" "
169257	169258	169247	169247	they	4229	" "
169272	169273	169263	169264	chance people	4231	" "
169326	169327	169317	169317	THEY	4238	" "
169347	169354	169328	169328	People	850	" said my guardian , smiling . "
169395	169411	169390	169390	I	0	" said Mr. George , sitting stiffly upright and squaring an elbow on each knee , "
169427	169428	169429	169429	I	0	" "
169437	169438	169429	169429	I	0	" "
169452	169453	169454	169456	A Chancery suitor	4242	" "
169458	169463	169454	169456	A Chancery suitor	4242	" returned my guardian . "
169468	169469	169454	169456	A Chancery suitor	4242	" "
169496	169501	169503	169503	he	9972	" said Mr. George , "
169657	169658	169661	169662	that man	11000	" "
169664	169675	169661	169662	that man	11000	" asked my guardian in a new tone of interest . "
169695	169700	169678	169678	he	11000	" said Mr. George . "
169706	169707	169702	169702	his	11000	" "
169713	169770	169711	169711	sir	9569	" Mr. George directed another succession of quick bright glances at me as my guardian and I exchanged a word or two of surprise at the coincidence , and I therefore explained to him how we knew the name . He made me another of his soldierly bows in acknowledgment of what he called my condescension . "
169776	169785	169711	169711	sir	9569	" he said as he looked at me , "
169806	169857	169858	169858	I	0	" He passed one of his heavy hands over his crisp dark hair as if to sweep the broken thoughts out of his mind and sat a little forward , with one arm akimbo and the other resting on his leg , looking in a brown study at the ground . "
169883	169888	169858	169858	I	0	" said my guardian . "
169896	169909	169890	169890	I	0	" returned Mr. George , still musing and looking on the ground . "
169915	169916	169911	169911	I	0	" "
169923	169924	169917	169917	You	9569	" "
169929	169945	169927	169927	sir	9569	" returned the trooper , lifting up his eyes and coming out of his reverie . "
169990	170794	170795	170795	Jarndyce	288	" Richard 's entrance stopped the conversation . Mr. George rose , made me another of his soldierly bows , wished my guardian a good day , and strode heavily out of the room . This was the morning of the day appointed for Richard 's departure . We had no more purchases to make now ; I had completed all his packing early in the afternoon ; and our time was disengaged until night , when he was to go to Liverpool for Holyhead . Jarndyce and Jarndyce being again expected to come on that day , Richard proposed to me that we should go down to the court and hear what passed . As it was his last day , and he was eager to go , and I had never been there , I gave my consent and we walked down to Westminster , where the court was then sitting . We beguiled the way with arrangements concerning the letters that Richard was to write to me and the letters that I was to write to him and with a great many hopeful projects . My guardian knew where we were going and therefore was not with us . When we came to the court , there was the Lord Chancellor - the same whom I had seen in his private room in Lincoln 's Inn - sitting in great state and gravity on the bench , with the mace and seals on a red table below him and an immense flat nosegay , like a little garden , which scented the whole court . Below the table , again , was a long row of solicitors , with bundles of papers on the matting at their feet ; and then there were the gentlemen of the bar in wigs and gowns - some awake and some asleep , and one talking , and nobody paying much attention to what he said . The Lord Chancellor leaned back in his very easy chair with his elbow on the cushioned arm and his forehead resting on his hand ; some of those who were present dozed ; some read the newspapers ; some walked about or whispered in groups : all seemed perfectly at their ease , by no means in a hurry , very unconcerned , and extremely comfortable . To see everything going on so smoothly and to think of the roughness of the suitors ' lives and deaths ; to see all that full dress and ceremony and to think of the waste , and want , and beggared misery it represented ; to consider that while the sickness of hope deferred was raging in so many hearts this polite show went calmly on from day to day , and year to year , in such good order and composure ; to behold the Lord Chancellor and the whole array of practitioners under him looking at one another and at the spectators as if nobody had ever heard that all over England the name in which they were assembled was a bitter jest , was held in universal horror , contempt , and indignation , was known for something so flagrant and bad that little short of a miracle could bring any good out of it to any one - this was so curious and self- contradictory to me , who had no experience of it , that it was at first incredible , and I could not comprehend it . I sat where Richard put me , and tried to listen , and looked about me ; but there seemed to be no reality in the whole scene except poor little Miss Flite , the madwoman , standing on a bench and nodding at it . Miss Flite soon espied us and came to where we sat . She gave me a gracious welcome to her domain and indicated , with much gratification and pride , its principal attractions . Mr. Kenge also came to speak to us and did the honours of the place in much the same way , with the bland modesty of a proprietor . It was not a very good day for a visit , he said ; he would have preferred the first day of term ; but it was imposing , it was imposing . When we had been there half an hour or so , the case in progress - if I may use a phrase so ridiculous in such a connexion - seemed to die out of its own vapidity , without coming , or being by anybody expected to come , to any result . The Lord Chancellor then threw down a bundle of papers from his desk to the gentlemen below him , and somebody said , "
170799	170843	170797	170797	Jarndyce	288	" Upon this there was a buzz , and a laugh , and a general withdrawal of the bystanders , and a bringing in of great heaps , and piles , and bags and bags full of papers . I think it came on "
170847	170880	171130	171130	your	351	" - about some bill of costs , to the best of my understanding , which was confused enough . But I counted twenty - three gentlemen in wigs who said they were "
170884	170996	171130	171130	your	351	" and none of them appeared to understand it much better than I. They chatted about it with the Lord Chancellor , and contradicted and explained among themselves , and some of them said it was this way , and some of them said it was that way , and some of them jocosely proposed to read huge volumes of affidavits , and there was more buzzing and laughing , and everybody concerned was in a state of idle entertainment , and nothing could be made of it by anybody . After an hour or so of this , and a good many speeches being begun and cut short , it was "
171003	171050	171130	171130	your	351	" as Mr. Kenge said , and the papers were bundled up again before the clerks had finished bringing them in . I glanced at Richard on the termination of these hopeless proceedings and was shocked to see the worn look of his handsome young face . "
171066	171127	171128	171128	I	0	" was all he said . I had seen Mr. Guppy bringing in papers and arranging them for Mr. Kenge ; and he had seen me and made me a forlorn bow , which rendered me desirous to get out of the court . Richard had given me his arm and was taking me away when Mr. Guppy came up . "
171136	171143	171133	171134	Mr. Carstone	295	" said he in a whisper , "
171175	171205	171153	171154	a lady	2382	" As he spoke , I saw before me , as if she had started into bodily shape from my remembrance , Mrs. Rachael of my godmother 's house . "
171213	171217	171208	171208	you	351	" said she . "
171223	171241	171219	171219	you	351	" I gave her my hand and told her yes and that she was very little altered . "
171251	171259	171244	171244	you	351	" she returned with her old asperity . "
171285	171296	171276	171276	you	351	" But indeed she seemed disappointed that I was not . "
171302	171306	171299	171300	Mrs. Rachael	282	" I remonstrated . "
171313	171321	171311	171311	Esther	283	" she returned , coldly correcting me , "
171343	171470	171471	171471	George	515	" Mr. Guppy , who had been attentive to this short dialogue , heaved a sigh in my ear and elbowed his own and Mrs. Rachael 's way through the confused little crowd of people coming in and going out , which we were in the midst of and which the change in the business had brought together . Richard and I were making our way through it , and I was yet in the first chill of the late unexpected recognition when I saw , coming towards us , but not seeing us , no less a person than Mr. George . He made nothing of the people about him as he tramped on , staring over their heads into the body of the court . "
171473	171484	171471	171471	George	515	" said Richard as I called his attention to him . "
171492	171496	171490	171490	sir	9569	" he returned . "
171521	171552	171514	171514	I	0	" Turning as he spoke and making an easy way for us , he stopped when we were out of the press in a corner behind a great red curtain . "
171561	171565	171555	171559	a little cracked old woman	4264	" he began , "
171568	171616	171617	171617	Hush	537	" I put up my finger , for Miss Flite was close by me , having kept beside me all the time and having called the attention of several of her legal acquaintance to me as I had overheard to my confusion by whispering in their ears , "
171625	171626	171627	171627	Hem	538	" "
171629	171634	171627	171627	Hem	538	" said Mr. George . "
171654	171663	171652	171652	Gridley	462	" in a low whisper behind his hand . "
171666	171669	171670	171670	He	462	" said I. "
171756	171757	171745	171745	I	0	" "
171763	171766	171759	171759	I	0	" said I. "
171773	171787	171759	171759	I	0	" he returned with a glance of something like apprehension at Miss Flite . "
171813	171848	171849	171849	My	0	" And he put one hand in his breast and stood upright in a martial attitude as I informed little Miss Flite , in her ear , of the purport of his kind errand . "
171861	171865	171849	171849	My	0	" she exclaimed . "
171882	171883	171872	171872	I	0	" "
171893	171896	171889	171890	Mr. George	515	" said I. "
171904	171905	171901	171902	Mr. George	515	" "
171910	171915	171901	171902	Mr. George	515	" returned Miss Flite . "
171937	171998	171999	171999	General	4281	" she whispered to me . Poor Miss Flite deemed it necessary to be so courtly and polite , as a mark of her respect for the army , and to curtsy so very often that it was no easy matter to get her out of the court . When this was at last done , and addressing Mr. George as "
172001	172029	171999	171999	General	4281	" she gave him her arm , to the great entertainment of some idlers who were looking on , he was so discomposed and begged me so respectfully "
172034	172062	172063	172064	Fitz Jarndyce	447	" that I could not make up my mind to do it , especially as Miss Flite was always tractable with me and as she too said , "
172077	172280	172069	172069	you	9610	" As Richard seemed quite willing , and even anxious , that we should see them safely to their destination , we agreed to do so . And as Mr. George informed us that Gridley 's mind had run on Mr. Jarndyce all the afternoon after hearing of their interview in the morning , I wrote a hasty note in pencil to my guardian to say where we were gone and why . Mr. George sealed it at a coffee - house , that it might lead to no discovery , and we sent it off by a ticket- porter . We then took a hackney - coach and drove away to the neighbourhood of Leicester Square . We walked through some narrow courts , for which Mr. George apologized , and soon came to the shooting gallery , the door of which was closed . As he pulled a bell - handle which hung by a chain to the door - post , a very respectable old gentleman with grey hair , wearing spectacles , and dressed in a black spencer and gaiters and a broad - brimmed hat , and carrying a large gold - beaded cane , addressed him . "
172290	172294	172069	172069	you	9610	" said he , "
172303	172304	172298	172298	George	515	" "
172310	172332	172308	172308	sir	9569	" returned Mr. George , glancing up at the great letters in which that inscription was painted on the whitewashed wall . "
172339	172349	172351	172351	you	4284	" said the old gentleman , following his eyes . "

172381	172387	172369	172369	I	0	" said the old gentleman . "
172413	172414	172405	172405	You	0	" "
172426	172427	172419	172419	You	9569	" "
172432	172438	172419	172419	You	9569	" said the old gentleman . "
172475	172476	172477	172479	The muffled drums	4294	" "
172481	172497	172477	172479	The muffled drums	4294	" said Mr. George , turning to Richard and me and gravely shaking his head . "
172512	172615	172506	172506	you	9569	" The door being at that moment opened by a very singular - looking little man in a green - baize cap and apron , whose face and hands and dress were blackened all over , we passed along a dreary passage into a large building with bare brick walls where there were targets , and guns , and swords , and other things of that kind . When we had all arrived here , the physician stopped , and taking off his hat , appeared to vanish by magic and to leave another and quite a different man in his place . "
172622	172643	172620	172620	George	515	" said the man , turning quickly round upon him and tapping him on the breast with a large forefinger . "
172717	172734	172704	172704	you	515	" Mr. George , looking hard at him , bit his lip and shook his head . "
172739	172749	172704	172704	you	515	" said the other , keeping close to him , "
172846	172876	172836	172836	you	515	" - the dirty little man was shuffling about with his shoulder against the wall , and his eyes on the intruder , in a manner that looked threatening - "
172887	172888	172889	172889	Phil	521	" "
172891	172896	172899	172899	guv'ner	4306	" said Mr. George . "
172901	172902	172899	172899	guv'ner	4306	" "
172906	172919	172899	172899	guv'ner	4306	" The little man , with a low growl , stood still . "
172924	172929	172930	172930	you	515	" said Mr. Bucket , "
172998	173001	172995	172995	you	515	" pointing ; "
173091	173092	173093	173093	I	0	" "
173097	173102	173093	173093	I	0	" was the reply . "
173114	173115	173111	173112	Mr. Bucket	665	" "
173123	173141	173142	173142	I	0	" said Mr. Bucket , tapping him on his broad breast again and shaking hands with him . "
173220	173450	173217	173218	a man	1735	" The affair being brought to this head , Mr. George , after a little consideration , proposed to go in first to his comrade as he called him , taking Miss Flite with him . Mr. Bucket agreeing , they went away to the further end of the gallery , leaving us sitting and standing by a table covered with guns . Mr. Bucket took this opportunity of entering into a little light conversation , asking me if I were afraid of fire - arms , as most young ladies were ; asking Richard if he were a good shot ; asking Phil Squod which he considered the best of those rifles and what it might be worth first - hand , telling him in return that it was a pity he ever gave way to his temper , for he was naturally so amiable that he might have been a young woman , and making himself generally agreeable . After a time he followed us to the further end of the gallery , and Richard and I were going quietly away when Mr. George came after us . He said that if we had no objection to see his comrade , he would take a visit from us very kindly . The words had hardly passed his lips when the bell was rung and my guardian appeared , "
173455	173460	173217	173218	a man	1735	" he slightly observed , "
173481	173783	173784	173785	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" We all four went back together and went into the place where Gridley was . It was a bare room , partitioned off from the gallery with unpainted wood . As the screening was not more than eight or ten feet high and only enclosed the sides , not the top , the rafters of the high gallery roof were overhead , and the skylight through which Mr. Bucket had looked down . The sun was low - near setting - and its light came redly in above , without descending to the ground . Upon a plain canvas - covered sofa lay the man from Shropshire , dressed much as we had seen him last , but so changed that at first I recognized no likeness in his colourless face to what I recollected . He had been still writing in his hiding - place , and still dwelling on his grievances , hour after hour . A table and some shelves were covered with manuscript papers and with worn pens and a medley of such tokens . Touchingly and awfully drawn together , he and the little mad woman were side by side and , as it were , alone . She sat on a chair holding his hand , and none of us went close to them . His voice had faded , with the old expression of his face , with his strength , with his anger , with his resistance to the wrongs that had at last subdued him . The faintest shadow of an object full of form and colour is such a picture of it as he was of the man from Shropshire whom we had spoken with before . He inclined his head to Richard and me and spoke to my guardian . "
173838	173855	173834	173834	I	0	" They shook hands earnestly , and my guardian said some words of comfort to him . "
173865	173869	173863	173863	sir	9569	" returned Gridley ; "
173950	173951	173943	173943	your	9569	" "
173964	173969	173970	173970	Sir	9569	" returned my guardian . "
173976	173982	173972	173972	I	0	" with a faint smile . "
174010	174029	173972	173972	I	0	" He drew the hand Miss Flite held through her arm and brought her something nearer to him . "
174102	174103	174097	174097	Chancery	14	" "
174110	174117	174108	174108	Gridley	462	" said Miss Flite in tears . "
174122	174123	174130	174130	they	4336	" "
174240	174265	174233	174233	I	0	" Here Mr. Bucket , who was sitting in a corner by the door , good- naturedly offered such consolation as he could administer . "
174270	174277	174233	174233	I	0	" he said from his corner . "
174348	174355	174383	174383	Lord	4339	" He only shook his head . "
174362	174367	174359	174359	your	462	" said Mr. Bucket . "
174487	174488	174479	174480	Mr. Gridley	462	" "
174498	174506	174491	174491	you	0	" asked George in a low voice . "
174513	174530	174491	174491	you	0	" said Bucket in the same tone . Then resuming his encouragement , he pursued aloud : "
174765	174766	174756	174756	he	462	" "
174772	174781	174783	174783	he	462	" said the trooper in a low voice . "
174785	174790	174783	174783	he	462	" returned Bucket anxiously . "
174855	174873	174847	174847	I	0	" The roof rang with a scream from Miss Flite , which still rings in my ears . "
174880	174894	174847	174847	I	0	" she cried as he fell heavily and calmly back from before her . "
174905	174967	174970	174970	my	0	" The sun was down , the light had gradually stolen from the roof , and the shadow had crept upward . But to me the shadow of that pair , one living and one dead , fell heavier on Richard 's departure than the darkness of the darkest night . And through Richard 's farewell words I heard it echoed : "
175036	175456	175031	175031	Chancery	14	" CHAPTER XXV Mrs. Snagsby Sees It All There is disquietude in Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street . Black suspicion hides in that peaceful region . The mass of Cook 's Courtiers are in their usual state of mind , no better and no worse ; but Mr. Snagsby is changed , and his little woman knows it . For Tom - all - Alone 's and Lincoln 's Inn Fields persist in harnessing themselves , a pair of ungovernable coursers , to the chariot of Mr. Snagsby 's imagination ; and Mr. Bucket drives ; and the passengers are Jo and Mr. Tulkinghorn ; and the complete equipage whirls though the law - stationery business at wild speed all round the clock . Even in the little front kitchen where the family meals are taken , it rattles away at a smoking pace from the dinner - table , when Mr. Snagsby pauses in carving the first slice of the leg of mutton baked with potatoes and stares at the kitchen wall . Mr. Snagsby can not make out what it is that he has had to do with . Something is wrong somewhere , but what something , what may come of it , to whom , when , and from which unthought of and unheard of quarter is the puzzle of his life . His remote impressions of the robes and coronets , the stars and garters , that sparkle through the surface - dust of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's chambers ; his veneration for the mysteries presided over by that best and closest of his customers , whom all the Inns of Court , all Chancery Lane , and all the legal neighbourhood agree to hold in awe ; his remembrance of Detective Mr. Bucket with his forefinger and his confidential manner , impossible to be evaded or declined , persuade him that he is a party to some dangerous secret without knowing what it is . And it is the fearful peculiarity of this condition that , at any hour of his daily life , at any opening of the shop - door , at any pull of the bell , at any entrance of a messenger , or any delivery of a letter , the secret may take air and fire , explode , and blow up - Mr. Bucket only knows whom . For which reason , whenever a man unknown comes into the shop as many men unknown do and says , "
175462	175588	175458	175459	Mr. Snagsby	370	" or words to that innocent effect , Mr. Snagsby 's heart knocks hard at his guilty breast . He undergoes so much from such inquiries that when they are made by boys he revenges himself by flipping at their ears over the counter and asking the young dogs what they mean by it and why they ca n't speak out at once ? More impracticable men and boys persist in walking into Mr. Snagsby 's sleep and terrifying him with unaccountable questions , so that often when the cock at the little dairy in Cursitor Street breaks out in his usual absurd way about the morning , Mr. Snagsby finds himself in a crisis of nightmare , with his little woman shaking him and saying "
175597	175709	175594	175595	the man	9972	" The little woman herself is not the least item in his difficulty . To know that he is always keeping a secret from her , that he has under all circumstances to conceal and hold fast a tender double tooth , which her sharpness is ever ready to twist out of his head , gives Mr. Snagsby , in her dentistical presence , much of the air of a dog who has a reservation from his master and will look anywhere rather than meet his eye . These various signs and tokens , marked by the little woman , are not lost upon her . They impel her to say , "
175717	175941	175714	175714	his	370	" And thus suspicion gets into Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street . From suspicion to jealousy , Mrs. Snagsby finds the road as natural and short as from Cook 's Court to Chancery Lane . And thus jealousy gets into Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street . Once there and it was always lurking thereabout , it is very active and nimble in Mrs. Snagsby 's breast , prompting her to nocturnal examinations of Mr. Snagsby 's pockets ; to secret perusals of Mr. Snagsby 's letters ; to private researches in the day book and ledger , till , cash - box , and iron safe ; to watchings at windows , listenings behind doors , and a general putting of this and that together by the wrong end . Mrs. Snagsby is so perpetually on the alert that the house becomes ghostly with creaking boards and rustling garments . The ' prentices think somebody may have been murdered there in bygone times . Guster holds certain loose atoms of an idea picked up at Tooting , where they were found floating among the orphans that there is buried money underneath the cellar , guarded by an old man with a white beard , who can not get out for seven thousand years because he said the Lord 's Prayer backwards . "
175946	175954	175944	175944	Nimrod	384	" Mrs. Snagsby repeatedly inquires of herself . "
175969	176010	175966	175967	that boy	10948	" Now , Nimrod being as dead as the mighty hunter whose name Mrs. Snagsby has appropriated , and the lady being unproducible , she directs her mental eye , for the present , with redoubled vigilance to the boy . "
176014	176025	176027	176028	that boy	10948	" quoth Mrs. Snagsby for the thousand and first time , "
176035	176251	175944	175944	Nimrod	384	" And there Mrs. Snagsby is seized with an inspiration . He has no respect for Mr. Chadband . No , to be sure , and he would n't have , of course . Naturally he would n't , under those contagious circumstances . He was invited and appointed by Mr. Chadband - why , Mrs. Snagsby heard it herself with her own ears ! - to come back , and be told where he was to go , to be addressed by Mr. Chadband ; and he never came ! Why did he never come ? Because he was told not to come . Who told him not to come ? Who ? Ha , ha ! Mrs. Snagsby sees it all . But happily and Mrs. Snagsby tightly shakes her head and tightly smiles that boy was met by Mr. Chadband yesterday in the streets ; and that boy , as affording a subject which Mr. Chadband desires to improve for the spiritual delight of a select congregation , was seized by Mr. Chadband and threatened with being delivered over to the police unless he showed the reverend gentleman where he lived and unless he entered into , and fulfilled , an undertaking to appear in Cook 's Court to - morrow night , "
176260	176585	175944	175944	Nimrod	384	" Mrs. Snagsby repeats for mere emphasis with another tight smile and another tight shake of her head ; and to - morrow night that boy will be here , and to - morrow night Mrs. Snagsby will have her eye upon him and upon some one else ; and oh , you may walk a long while in your secret ways says Mrs. Snagsby with haughtiness and scorn , but you ca n't blind ME ! Mrs. Snagsby sounds no timbrel in anybody 's ears , but holds her purpose quietly , and keeps her counsel . To - morrow comes , the savoury preparations for the Oil Trade come , the evening comes . Comes Mr. Snagsby in his black coat ; come the Chadbands ; come when the gorging vessel is replete the ' prentices and Guster , to be edified ; comes at last , with his slouching head , and his shuffle backward , and his shuffle forward , and his shuffle to the right , and his shuffle to the left , and his bit of fur cap in his muddy hand , which he picks as if it were some mangy bird he had caught and was plucking before eating raw , Jo , the very , very tough subject Mr. Chadband is to improve . Mrs. Snagsby screws a watchful glance on Jo as he is brought into the little drawing - room by Guster . He looks at Mr. Snagsby the moment he comes in . Aha ! Why does he look at Mr. Snagsby ? Mr. Snagsby looks at him . Why should he do that , but that Mrs. Snagsby sees it all ? Why else should that look pass between them , why else should Mr. Snagsby be confused and cough a signal cough behind his hand ? It is as clear as crystal that Mr. Snagsby is that boy 's father . "
176591	176606	176612	176612	My	0	" says Chadband , rising and wiping the oily exudations from his reverend visage . "
176621	176627	176612	176612	My	0	" with his fat smile , "
176689	176743	176744	176744	You	0	" Stretching forth his flabby paw , Mr. Chadband lays the same on Jo 's arm and considers where to station him . Jo , very doubtful of his reverend friend 's intentions and not at all clear but that something practical and painful is going to be done to him , mutters , "
176761	176762	176756	176756	You	0	" "
176769	176774	176756	176756	You	0	" says Chadband smoothly , "
176862	176932	176933	176934	My friends	9940	" Jo , apparently possessed by an impression that the reverend gentleman wants to cut his hair , shields his head with both arms and is got into the required position with great difficulty and every possible manifestation of reluctance . When he is at last adjusted like a lay - figure , Mr. Chadband , retiring behind the table , holds up his bear's - paw and says , "
176936	177132	176933	176934	My friends	9940	" This is the signal for a general settlement of the audience . The ' prentices giggle internally and nudge each other . Guster falls into a staring and vacant state , compounded of a stunned admiration of Mr. Chadband and pity for the friendless outcast whose condition touches her nearly . Mrs. Snagsby silently lays trains of gunpowder . Mrs. Chadband composes herself grimly by the fire and warms her knees , finding that sensation favourable to the reception of eloquence . It happens that Mr. Chadband has a pulpit habit of fixing some member of his congregation with his eye and fatly arguing his points with that particular person , who is understood to be expected to be moved to an occasional grunt , groan , gasp , or other audible expression of inward working , which expression of inward working , being echoed by some elderly lady in the next pew and so communicated like a game of forfeits through a circle of the more fermentable sinners present , serves the purpose of parliamentary cheering and gets Mr. Chadband 's steam up . From mere force of habit , Mr. Chadband in saying "
177136	177165	177166	177166	We	4374	" has rested his eye on Mr. Snagsby and proceeds to make that ill - starred stationer , already sufficiently confused , the immediate recipient of his discourse . "
177175	177179	177180	177181	a Gentile	4376	" says Chadband , "
177219	177261	177210	177210	We	4374	" and Mr. Chadband , untwisting the point with his dirty thumb - nail , bestows an oily smile on Mr. Snagsby , signifying that he will throw him an argumentative back - fall presently if he be not already down , "
177314	177382	177312	177312	he	1293	" Mr. Chadband states the question as if he were propounding an entirely new riddle of much ingenuity and merit to Mr. Snagsby and entreating him not to give it up . Mr. Snagsby , greatly perplexed by the mysterious look he received just now from his little woman - at about the period when Mr. Chadband mentioned the word parents - is tempted into modestly remarking , "
177394	177406	177388	177388	I	0	" On which interruption Mrs. Chadband glares and Mrs. Snagsby says , "
177410	177411	177412	177412	I	0	" "
177417	177421	177412	177412	I	0	" says Chadband ; "
177443	177444	177432	177432	I	0	" "
177449	177454	177432	177432	I	0	" from Mrs. Snagsby . "
177539	177591	177530	177530	I	0	" Mr. Chadband draws back his head and pauses , but Mr. Snagsby is not to be lured on to his destruction again . Mr. Chadband , leaning forward over the table , pierces what he has got to follow directly into Mr. Snagsby with the thumb - nail already mentioned . "
177595	177599	177681	177681	I	0	" says Chadband , "
177627	177654	177625	177625	Terewth	543	" Mr. Chadband draws himself up again and looks triumphantly at Mr. Snagsby as if he would be glad to know how he feels after that . "
177658	177667	177625	177625	Terewth	543	" says Mr. Chadband , hitting him again . "
177784	177871	177872	177873	My friends	9940	" The present effect of this flight of oratory - much admired for its general power by Mr. Chadband 's followers - being not only to make Mr. Chadband unpleasantly warm , but to represent the innocent Mr. Snagsby in the light of a determined enemy to virtue , with a forehead of brass and a heart of adamant , that unfortunate tradesman becomes yet more disconcerted and is in a very advanced state of low spirits and false position when Mr. Chadband accidentally finishes him . "
177875	177914	177872	177873	My friends	9940	" he resumes after dabbing his fat head for some time - and it smokes to such an extent that he seems to light his pocket- handkerchief at it , which smokes , too , after every dab - "
177953	177966	177949	177951	my young friends	1450	" suddenly addressing the ' prentices and Guster , to their consternation , "
178063	178064	178055	178055	my	0	" "
178069	178074	178055	178055	my	0	" from Mrs. Snagsby . "
178079	178089	178055	178055	my	0	" A shiver in the negative from Mrs. Snagsby . "
178094	178110	178055	178055	my	0	" A shake of the head from Mrs. Snagsby - very long and very tight . "
178245	178289	178292	178294	my juvenile friends	4406	" If Mr. Snagsby could withstand his little woman 's look as it enters at his eyes , the windows of his soul , and searches the whole tenement , he were other than the man he is . He cowers and droops . "
178296	178327	178292	178294	my juvenile friends	4406	" says Chadband , descending to the level of their comprehension with a very obtrusive demonstration in his greasily meek smile of coming a long way downstairs for the purpose , "
178390	178396	178406	178406	he	4407	" Mrs. Snagsby in tears . "
178435	178441	178433	178433	Terewth	543	" Mrs. Snagsby sobbing loudly . "
178450	178459	178433	178433	Terewth	543	" said Chadband , stimulated by the sound , "
178545	178874	178543	178543	Terewth	543	" Mrs. Snagsby replies by delivering herself a prey to spasms , not an unresisting prey , but a crying and a tearing one , so that Cook 's Court re - echoes with her shrieks . Finally , becoming cataleptic , she has to be carried up the narrow staircase like a grand piano . After unspeakable suffering , productive of the utmost consternation , she is pronounced , by expresses from the bedroom , free from pain , though much exhausted , in which state of affairs Mr. Snagsby , trampled and crushed in the piano - forte removal , and extremely timid and feeble , ventures to come out from behind the door in the drawing - room . All this time Jo has been standing on the spot where he woke up , ever picking his cap and putting bits of fur in his mouth . He spits them out with a remorseful air , for he feels that it is in his nature to be an unimprovable reprobate and that it 's no good HIS trying to keep awake , for HE wo n't never know nothink . Though it may be , Jo , that there is a history so interesting and affecting even to minds as near the brutes as thine , recording deeds done on this earth for common men , that if the Chadbands , removing their own persons from the light , would but show it thee in simple reverence , would but leave it unimproved , would but regard it as being eloquent enough without their modest aid - it might hold thee awake , and thou might learn from it yet ! Jo never heard of any such book . Its compilers and the Reverend Chadband are all one to him , except that he knows the Reverend Chadband and would rather run away from him for an hour than hear him talk for five minutes . "
178885	178889	178890	178891	Mr. Snagsby	370	" thinks Jo . "
178905	178976	178890	178891	Mr. Snagsby	370	" And downstairs he shuffles . But downstairs is the charitable Guster , holding by the handrail of the kitchen stairs and warding off a fit , as yet doubtfully , the same having been induced by Mrs. Snagsby 's screaming . She has her own supper of bread and cheese to hand to Jo , with whom she ventures to interchange a word or so for the first time . "
178986	178990	178983	178984	poor boy	4421	" says Guster . "
178995	178999	178993	178993	mum	4422	" says Jo . "
179004	179005	179001	179001	you	4422	" "
179008	179012	179001	179001	you	4422	" says Jo . "
179025	179078	179001	179001	you	4422	" Jo stops in the middle of a bite and looks petrified . For this orphan charge of the Christian saint whose shrine was at Tooting has patted him on the shoulder , and it is the first time in his life that any decent hand has been so laid upon him . "
179086	179090	179079	179079	I	0	" says Jo . "
179099	179125	179126	179126	Jo	396	" cries Guster . She is repressing symptoms favourable to the fit when she seems to take alarm at something and vanishes down the stairs . "
179128	179143	179126	179126	Jo	396	" whispers the law - stationer softly as the boy lingers on the step . "
179151	179152	179148	179149	Mr. Snagsby	370	" "
179205	179206	179196	179196	You	396	" "
179213	179979	179196	179196	You	396	" And so , good night . A ghostly shade , frilled and night - capped , follows the law- stationer to the room he came from and glides higher up . And henceforth he begins , go where he will , to be attended by another shadow than his own , hardly less constant than his own , hardly less quiet than his own . And into whatsoever atmosphere of secrecy his own shadow may pass , let all concerned in the secrecy beware ! For the watchful Mrs. Snagsby is there too - bone of his bone , flesh of his flesh , shadow of his shadow . CHAPTER XXVI Sharpshooters Wintry morning , looking with dull eyes and sallow face upon the neighbourhood of Leicester Square , finds its inhabitants unwilling to get out of bed . Many of them are not early risers at the brightest of times , being birds of night who roost when the sun is high and are wide awake and keen for prey when the stars shine out . Behind dingy blind and curtain , in upper story and garret , skulking more or less under false names , false hair , false titles , false jewellery , and false histories , a colony of brigands lie in their first sleep . Gentlemen of the green - baize road who could discourse from personal experience of foreign galleys and home treadmills ; spies of strong governments that eternally quake with weakness and miserable fear , broken traitors , cowards , bullies , gamesters , shufflers , swindlers , and false witnesses ; some not unmarked by the branding - iron beneath their dirty braid ; all with more cruelty in them than was in Nero , and more crime than is in Newgate . For howsoever bad the devil can be in fustian or smock - frock and he can be very bad in both , he is a more designing , callous , and intolerable devil when he sticks a pin in his shirt - front , calls himself a gentleman , backs a card or colour , plays a game or so of billiards , and knows a little about bills and promissory notes than in any other form he wears . And in such form Mr. Bucket shall find him , when he will , still pervading the tributary channels of Leicester Square . But the wintry morning wants him not and wakes him not . It wakes Mr. George of the shooting gallery and his familiar . They arise , roll up and stow away their mattresses . Mr. George , having shaved himself before a looking - glass of minute proportions , then marches out , bare - headed and bare - chested , to the pump in the little yard and anon comes back shining with yellow soap , friction , drifting rain , and exceedingly cold water . As he rubs himself upon a large jack - towel , blowing like a military sort of diver just come up , his hair curling tighter and tighter on his sunburnt temples the more he rubs it so that it looks as if it never could be loosened by any less coercive instrument than an iron rake or a curry - comb - as he rubs , and puffs , and polishes , and blows , turning his head from side to side the more conveniently to excoriate his throat , and standing with his body well bent forward to keep the wet from his martial legs , Phil , on his knees lighting a fire , looks round as if it were enough washing for him to see all that done , and sufficient renovation for one day to take in the superfluous health his master throws off . When Mr. George is dry , he goes to work to brush his head with two hard brushes at once , to that unmerciful degree that Phil , shouldering his way round the gallery in the act of sweeping it , winks with sympathy . This chafing over , the ornamental part of Mr. George 's toilet is soon performed . He fills his pipe , lights it , and marches up and down smoking , as his custom is , while Phil , raising a powerful odour of hot rolls and coffee , prepares breakfast . He smokes gravely and marches in slow time . Perhaps this morning 's pipe is devoted to the memory of Gridley in his grave . "
179985	179998	179983	179983	Phil	521	" says George of the shooting gallery after several turns in silence , "
180008	180030	179999	179999	you	521	" Phil , by the by , said as much in a tone of surprise as he scrambled out of bed . "
180035	180036	179999	179999	you	521	" "
180042	180043	180044	180044	I	0	" "
180054	180060	180044	180044	I	0	" said Phil , considering . "
180070	180071	180063	180063	you	4306	" "
180087	180094	180078	180078	I	0	" says Phil after further consideration . "
180104	180105	180106	180106	They	4432	" "
180117	180296	180106	180106	They	4432	" says Phil . The master resumes his march , and the man resumes his preparation of breakfast . It is not necessarily a lengthened preparation , being limited to the setting forth of very simple breakfast requisites for two and the broiling of a rasher of bacon at the fire in the rusty grate ; but as Phil has to sidle round a considerable part of the gallery for every object he wants , and never brings two objects at once , it takes time under the circumstances . At length the breakfast is ready . Phil announcing it , Mr. George knocks the ashes out of his pipe on the hob , stands his pipe itself in the chimney corner , and sits down to the meal . When he has helped himself , Phil follows suit , sitting at the extreme end of the little oblong table and taking his plate on his knees . Either in humility , or to hide his blackened hands , or because it is his natural manner of eating . "
180300	180311	180106	180106	They	4432	" says Mr. George , plying his knife and fork ; "
180327	180328	180316	180316	you	4434	" "
180335	180344	180329	180329	I	0	" says Phil , contentedly eating his breakfast . "

180355	180359	180353	180353	commander	4438	" returns Phil . "

180374	180378	180366	180366	I	0	" says Phil ; "
180393	180418	180386	180386	They	4436	" Governor and commander are interchangeable terms with Phil , expressive of the same respect and deference and applicable to nobody but Mr. George . "
180428	180429	180426	180426	Phil	521	" "
180436	180437	180431	180431	you	0	" "
180444	180474	180431	180431	you	0	" Phil elevates his one eyebrow , and after respectfully staring at his master to express interest , swallows a great gulp of coffee , still staring at him . "
180488	180493	180483	180483	I	0	" says Mr. George . "
180541	180542	180543	180543	She	4445	" "
180554	180558	180547	180550	a fine old lady	4447	" Phil observes . "
180573	180578	180547	180550	a fine old lady	4447	" says Mr. George . "
180603	180604	180586	180586	she	4445	" "
180613	180617	180611	180611	guv'ner	523	" inquires Phil . "
180632	180637	180630	180630	her	4445	" says the trooper . "
180679	180685	180663	180663	you	523	" Phil shakes his head . "
180693	180694	180663	180663	you	523	" "
180709	180713	180704	180704	I	0	" says Phil . "

180732	180736	180730	180730	commander	4438	" says Phil , "

180771	180787	180767	180767	you	0	" asks the trooper , pausing as he conveys his smoking saucer to his lips . "
180797	180801	180788	180788	I	0	" says Phil . "
180819	180837	180841	180842	the deuce	4453	" Mr. George , slowly putting down his saucer without tasting its contents , is laughingly beginning , "
180846	180861	180841	180842	the deuce	4453	" when he stops , seeing that Phil is counting on his dirty fingers . "
180867	180871	180841	180842	the deuce	4453	" says Phil , "
181070	181071	181060	181060	I	0	" "
181074	181083	181060	181060	I	0	" says Mr. George , resuming his breakfast . "
181090	181091	181092	181092	Drink	547	" "
181117	181122	181113	181113	I	0	" Phil replies mysteriously . "
181136	181137	181140	181140	commander	4438	" "
181302	181303	181304	181304	They	4467	" "
181319	181328	181309	181309	You	0	" says the trooper with a pleasant smile . "
181333	181341	181309	181309	You	0	" returns Phil , shaking his head . "
181522	181551	181592	181592	guv'ner	4306	" Resigning himself to which condition with a perfectly satisfied manner , Phil begs the favour of another cup of coffee . While drinking it , he says , "
181573	181574	181570	181570	You	4486	" "
181588	181589	181590	181590	Crawling	548	" "
181598	181599	181590	181590	Crawling	548	" "
181609	181610	181605	181605	your	521	" "
181617	181623	181605	181605	your	521	" exclaims Phil , excited . "
181630	181631	181605	181605	your	521	" "
181640	181648	181605	181605	your	521	" cries Phil , still more excited . "
181657	181658	181660	181660	you	4486	" "
181666	181685	181660	181660	you	4486	" cries Phil , putting down his cup and saucer and hastily removing his plate from his knees , "
181857	181874	181855	181855	commander	4438	" cries Phil , who has started from his chair and unaccountably begun to sidle away . "
181985	182101	181971	181971	I	0	" With this unexpected speech , energetically delivered and accompanied by action illustrative of the various exercises referred to , Phil Squod shoulders his way round three sides of the gallery , and abruptly tacking off at his commander , makes a butt at him with his head , intended to express devotion to his service . He then begins to clear away the breakfast . Mr. George , after laughing cheerfully and clapping him on the shoulder , assists in these arrangements and helps to get the gallery into business order . That done , he takes a turn at the dumb - bells , and afterwards weighing himself and opining that he is getting "
182105	182307	181971	181971	I	0	" engages with great gravity in solitary broadsword practice . Meanwhile Phil has fallen to work at his usual table , where he screws and unscrews , and cleans , and files , and whistles into small apertures , and blackens himself more and more , and seems to do and undo everything that can be done and undone about a gun . Master and man are at length disturbed by footsteps in the passage , where they make an unusual sound , denoting the arrival of unusual company . These steps , advancing nearer and nearer to the gallery , bring into it a group at first sight scarcely reconcilable with any day in the year but the fifth of November . It consists of a limp and ugly figure carried in a chair by two bearers and attended by a lean female with a face like a pinched mask , who might be expected immediately to recite the popular verses commemorative of the time when they did contrive to blow Old England up alive but for her keeping her lips tightly and defiantly closed as the chair is put down . At which point the figure in it gasping , "
182320	182323	182316	182316	I	0	" adds , "
182336	182365	182366	182367	Mr. George	515	" Mr. George then descries , in the procession , the venerable Mr. Smallweed out for an airing , attended by his granddaughter Judy as body - guard . "
182373	182399	182366	182367	Mr. George	515	" says Grandfather Smallweed , removing his right arm from the neck of one of his bearers , whom he has nearly throttled coming along , "
182415	182416	182404	182404	You	515	" "
182433	182438	182427	182428	your friend	11414	" returns Mr. George . "
182445	182450	182451	182451	I	0	" pants Mr. Smallweed . "
182489	182490	182487	182487	sir	9569	" "
182496	182501	182502	182502	I	0	" says Mr. George . "
182509	182510	182504	182504	you	0	" "
182522	182531	182511	182511	You	12511	" Mr. Smallweed takes him by both hands . "
182554	182555	182556	182556	Hum	296	" "
182563	182568	182558	182558	She	508	" mutters Mr. George . "
182619	182643	182645	182649	the driver of the cab	4514	" says Grandfather Smallweed , alluding to the bearer , who has been in danger of strangulation and who withdraws adjusting his windpipe , "
182668	182673	182674	182674	we	4517	" the other bearer , "
182723	182740	182720	182721	this person	2303	" Grandfather Smallweed refers to Phil with a glance of considerable terror and a half - subdued "
182749	182816	182747	182747	me	0	" Nor in his apprehension , on the surface of things , without some reason , for Phil , who has never beheld the apparition in the black - velvet cap before , has stopped short with a gun in his hand with much of the air of a dead shot intent on picking Mr. Smallweed off as an ugly old bird of the crow species . "
182822	182827	182747	182747	me	0	" says Grandfather Smallweed , "
182845	182880	182747	182747	me	0	" The person , who is one of those extraordinary specimens of human fungus that spring up spontaneously in the western streets of London , ready dressed in an old red jacket , with a "
182882	182914	182917	182918	Mr. George	515	" for holding horses and calling coaches , received his twopence with anything but transport , tosses the money into the air , catches it over - handed , and retires . "
182920	182925	182927	182927	you	515	" says Grandfather Smallweed , "
182964	183004	182962	182962	me	0	" His closing exclamation is jerked out of the venerable gentleman by the suddenness with which Mr. Squod , like a genie , catches him up , chair and all , and deposits him on the hearth - stone . "
183008	183015	183005	183006	O Lord	4528	" says Mr. Smallweed , panting . "
183064	183124	183056	183056	I	0	" which indeed is testified to the noses of all present by the smell of his worsted stockings . The gentle Judy , having backed her grandfather a little way from the fire , and having shaken him up as usual , and having released his overshadowed eye from its black - velvet extinguisher , Mr. Smallweed again says , "
183133	183150	183130	183131	O Lord	4532	" and looking about and meeting Mr. George 's glance , again stretches out both hands . "
183195	183205	183189	183189	you	12511	" adds Grandfather Smallweed , very ill at ease . "
183215	183216	183189	183189	you	12511	" "
183245	183246	183239	183239	he	4530	" "
183255	183262	183247	183247	He	4530	" says Mr. George , smiling . "
183287	183293	183294	183294	He	4530	" the old gentleman returns . "
183324	183359	183309	183309	you	515	" Obedient to a nod from the trooper , Phil retires , empty - handed , to the other end of the gallery . Mr. Smallweed , reassured , falls to rubbing his legs . "
183369	183389	183366	183367	Mr. George	515	" he says to the trooper , squarely standing faced about towards him with his broadsword in his hand . "
183398	183409	183366	183367	Mr. George	515	" Mr. George answers with a cool nod , adding , "
183424	183425	183413	183413	You	515	" "
183434	183440	183431	183432	Mr. George	515	" returns the venerable grandfather . "
183447	183448	183441	183441	You	515	" "
183455	183460	183461	183463	My dear friend	12511	" says Mr. George . "
183493	183516	183491	183491	him	0	" says the excellent old gentleman apart to Judy as the trooper takes a step or two away to lay it aside . "
183551	183582	183544	183544	he	0	" Mr. George , returning , folds his arms , and looking down at the old man , sliding every moment lower and lower in his chair , says quietly , "
183587	183588	183544	183544	he	0	" "
183591	183604	183544	183544	he	0	" cries Mr. Smallweed , rubbing his hands with an artful chuckle . "
183619	183620	183544	183544	he	0	" "
183625	183918	183544	183544	he	0	" says Mr. George , who with great composure sets his chair in the chimney - corner , takes his pipe from the grate , fills it and lights it , and falls to smoking peacefully . This tends to the discomfiture of Mr. Smallweed , who finds it so difficult to resume his object , whatever it may be , that he becomes exasperated and secretly claws the air with an impotent vindictiveness expressive of an intense desire to tear and rend the visage of Mr. George . As the excellent old gentleman 's nails are long and leaden , and his hands lean and veinous , and his eyes green and watery ; and , over and above this , as he continues , while he claws , to slide down in his chair and to collapse into a shapeless bundle , he becomes such a ghastly spectacle , even in the accustomed eyes of Judy , that that young virgin pounces at him with something more than the ardour of affection and so shakes him up and pats and pokes him in divers parts of his body , but particularly in that part which the science of self - defence would call his wind , that in his grievous distress he utters enforced sounds like a paviour 's rammer . When Judy has by these means set him up again in his chair , with a white face and a frosty nose but still clawing , she stretches out her weazen forefinger and gives Mr. George one poke in the back . The trooper raising his head , she makes another poke at her esteemed grandfather , and having thus brought them together , stares rigidly at the fire . "
183935	183944	183945	183947	My dear friend	12511	" chatters Grandfather Smallweed , swallowing his rage . "
183949	183953	183945	183947	My dear friend	12511	" still clawing . "
183959	183964	183954	183954	I	0	" says Mr. George . "
184024	184037	184016	184016	you	12511	" says the trooper , putting his pipe between his lips again , "
184052	184075	184041	184041	I	0	" And he inflates his broad chest to its utmost extent as if to assure himself that he is not smothered yet . "
184087	184092	184077	184077	you	12511	" continues Mr. George , "
184138	184158	184159	184159	You	12511	" The blooming Judy , without removing her gaze from the fire , gives her grandfather one ghostly poke . "
184183	184195	184196	184196	I	0	" says Mr. George with his eyes musingly fixed on Judy , "
184201	184202	184203	184203	She	12220	" "
184215	184220	184203	184203	She	12220	" says Grandfather Smallweed . "
184252	184261	184229	184230	Mr. George	515	" snarling and looking unconsciously for the cushion , "
184271	184272	184263	184263	I	0	" "
184275	184289	184263	184263	I	0	" returns the trooper , wheeling his chair to face the old man . "
184293	184294	184263	184263	I	0	" "
184315	184316	184318	184318	he	4557	" "

184339	184346	184318	184318	he	4557	" Grandfather Smallweed rubs his legs . "
184375	184376	184378	184378	they	11569	" "
184380	184385	184378	184378	they	11569	" returns Mr. George . "
184401	184402	184405	184405	he	11414	" "
184415	184416	184413	184413	you	12511	" "
184457	184458	184442	184444	The young gentleman	1223	" "
184482	184493	184480	184480	sir	9569	" remonstrates Grandfather Smallweed , cunningly rubbing his spare legs . "
184575	184638	184558	184559	Mr. George	515	" says Grandfather Smallweed , turning up his velvet cap and scratching his ear like a monkey . Mr. George , who has put aside his pipe and sits with an arm on his chair - back , beats a tattoo on the ground with his right foot as if he were not particularly pleased with the turn the conversation has taken . "
184648	184653	184662	184663	a joker	4575	" resumes Mr. Smallweed . "
184680	184681	184670	184671	Mr. George	515	" "
184690	184707	184708	184709	What captain	4578	" asks Mr. George , pausing with a frown in stroking the recollection of his moustache . "
184711	184712	184713	184714	Our captain	4580	" "
184725	184726	184722	184723	Captain Hawdon	520	" "
184736	184756	184757	184757	You	515	" says Mr. George with a low whistle as he sees both grandfather and granddaughter looking hard at him . "
184779	184780	184781	184783	My dear friend	12511	" "
184785	184791	184792	184792	I	0	" returns the old man , "
184826	184827	184815	184815	my	0	" "
184830	184835	184815	184815	my	0	" observes Mr. George . "
184845	184857	184838	184838	your	0	" inquires the old man with his hand to his ear . "
184860	184861	184838	184838	your	0	" "
184864	184869	184870	184871	Mr. George	515	" says Grandfather Smallweed . "
184909	184910	184900	184900	you	515	" "
184914	184919	184900	184900	you	515	" says Mr. George . "
184925	184926	184900	184900	you	515	" "
184935	184950	184930	184931	a lawyer	11981	" says Mr. George , folding his arms with an air of confirmed resolution . "
185001	185002	184985	184985	He	0	" "
185005	185006	184985	184985	He	0	" "
185074	185075	185069	185069	you	12511	" "
185081	185095	185078	185079	Mr. Smallweed	490	" says Mr. George again after going through the ceremony with some stiffness . "
185122	185152	185102	185102	I	0	" says the old man , making a curse out of one of his few remembrances of a prayer and squeezing up his velvet cap between his angry hands , "
185168	185190	185191	185191	you	12511	" breathlessly recovering his mildness of speech as Judy re- adjusts the cap on his skittle - ball of a head , "
185223	185224	185242	185242	I	0	" "
185231	185238	185242	185242	I	0	" says the trooper , pondering ; "
185245	185246	185247	185247	My	0	" "
185251	185252	185247	185247	My	0	" "

185264	185273	185247	185247	My	0	" says Grandfather Smallweed , crest - fallen . "
185297	185298	185299	185299	Sir	9569	" "
185318	185319	185312	185312	I	0	" "
185323	185332	185333	185333	I	0	" says the trooper , shaking his head . "
185342	185343	185333	185333	I	0	" "
185365	185386	185387	185387	I	0	" urges Grandfather Smallweed , pulling out a lean old silver watch with hands like the leg of a skeleton . "
185424	185425	185414	185414	you	9569	" "
185428	185433	185414	185414	you	9569	" says he gravely . "
185454	185455	185449	185449	I	0	" "
185511	185520	185522	185522	I	0	" says Grandfather Smallweed , lowering his tone , "
185543	185544	185534	185534	you	9569	" "
185561	185562	185554	185554	I	0	" "
185572	185573	185567	185568	Mr. George	515	" "
185600	185713	185575	185575	you	9569	" Mr. George inquires , getting his hat and thick wash - leather gloves . This pleasantry so tickles Mr. Smallweed that he laughs , long and low , before the fire . But ever while he laughs , he glances over his paralytic shoulder at Mr. George and eagerly watches him as he unlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the gallery , looks here and there upon the higher shelves , and ultimately takes something out with a rustling of paper , folds it , and puts it in his breast . Then Judy pokes Mr. Smallweed once , and Mr. Smallweed pokes Judy once . "
185718	185726	185727	185727	Phil	521	" says the trooper , coming back . "
185745	185746	185729	185729	you	521	" "
185759	185764	185765	185765	He	4604	" says Mr. Smallweed . "
185784	186000	185772	185772	you	521	" Phil makes no reply , but seizing the chair and its load , sidles away , tightly hugged by the now speechless Mr. Smallweed , and bolts along the passage as if he had an acceptable commission to carry the old gentleman to the nearest volcano . His shorter trust , however , terminating at the cab , he deposits him there ; and the fair Judy takes her place beside him , and the chair embellishes the roof , and Mr. George takes the vacant place upon the box . Mr. George is quite confounded by the spectacle he beholds from time to time as he peeps into the cab through the window behind him , where the grim Judy is always motionless , and the old gentleman with his cap over one eye is always sliding off the seat into the straw and looking upward at him out of his other eye with a helpless expression of being jolted in the back . CHAPTER XXVII More Old Soldiers Than One Mr. George has not far to ride with folded arms upon the box , for their destination is Lincoln 's Inn Fields . When the driver stops his horses , Mr. George alights , and looking in at the window , says , "
186012	186013	186010	186010	he	4608	" "
186028	186029	186025	186026	Mr. George	515	" "
186059	186183	186185	186187	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" There ensues the carrying of Mr. Smallweed upstairs , which is done to perfection with the trooper 's help . He is borne into Mr. Tulkinghorn 's great room and deposited on the Turkey rug before the fire . Mr. Tulkinghorn is not within at the present moment but will be back directly . The occupant of the pew in the hall , having said thus much , stirs the fire and leaves the triumvirate to warm themselves . Mr. George is mightily curious in respect of the room . He looks up at the painted ceiling , looks round at the old law - books , contemplates the portraits of the great clients , reads aloud the names on the boxes . "
186192	186198	186189	186189	Baronet	268	" Mr. George reads thoughtfully . "
186210	186236	186237	186239	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" Mr. George stands looking at these boxes a long while - as if they were pictures - and comes back to the fire repeating , "
186251	186252	186237	186239	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" "
186262	186271	186259	186260	Mr. George	515	" whispers Grandfather Smallweed , rubbing his legs . "
186275	186276	186279	186279	you	4611	" "
186290	186291	186292	186293	This gentleman	11805	" "
186298	186299	186295	186296	this gentleman	11805	" "
186324	186333	186279	186279	you	4611	" says Mr. George , looking round again . "
186341	186430	186279	186279	you	4611	" This reply is cut short by Mr. Tulkinghorn 's arrival . There is no change in him , of course . Rustily drest , with his spectacles in his hand , and their very case worn threadbare . In manner , close and dry . In voice , husky and low . In face , watchful behind a blind ; habitually not uncensorious and contemptuous perhaps . The peerage may have warmer worshippers and faithfuller believers than Mr. Tulkinghorn , after all , if everything were known . "
186440	186448	186434	186435	Mr. Smallweed	490	" he says as he comes in . "
186463	186499	186461	186461	sergeant	4617	" As Mr. Tulkinghorn takes off his gloves and puts them in his hat , he looks with half - closed eyes across the room to where the trooper stands and says within himself perchance , "
186507	186508	186500	186500	You	490	" "
186514	186541	186512	186512	sergeant	4617	" he repeats as he comes to his table , which is set on one side of the fire , and takes his easy - chair . "
186552	186590	186512	186512	sergeant	4617	" Mr. Tulkinghorn warms before the bars , alternately , the palms and knuckles of his hands and looks from behind that blind which is always down at the trio sitting in a little semicircle before him . "
186600	186609	186610	186611	Mr. Smallweed	490	" as perhaps he can in two senses , "
186613	186631	186610	186611	Mr. Smallweed	490	" The old gentleman is newly shaken up by Judy to bear his part in the conversation . "
186644	186645	186638	186639	the sergeant	4616	" "
186650	186665	186648	186648	sir	9569	" returns Mr. Smallweed , very servile to the lawyer 's wealth and influence . "
186676	186677	186669	186670	the sergeant	4616	" "
186681	186694	186678	186679	Mr. George	515	" says Grandfather Smallweed with a tremulous wave of his shrivelled hand , "
186702	186744	186700	186700	sir	9569	" Mr. George salutes the gentleman but otherwise sits bolt upright and profoundly silent - very forward in his chair , as if the full complement of regulation appendages for a field - day hung about him . Mr. Tulkinghorn proceeds , "
186756	186757	186754	186754	George	515	" "
186764	186765	186762	186762	Sir	9569	" "
186773	186774	186768	186768	you	515	" "
186782	186787	186768	186768	you	515	" returns the trooper , "
186798	186799	186795	186795	YOU	9569	" "
186808	186809	186801	186801	you	515	" "
186819	186836	186817	186817	sir	9569	" This is so very trying to Mr. Smallweed 's temper that he suddenly breaks out with "
186843	186866	186837	186837	You	515	" and as suddenly asks pardon of Mr. Tulkinghorn , excusing himself for this slip of the tongue by saying to Judy , "
186877	186878	186882	186882	sergeant	4617	" "
186884	186902	186882	186882	sergeant	4617	" Mr. Tulkinghorn resumes as he leans on one side of his chair and crosses his legs , "
186964	186965	186968	186968	sir	9569	" "
186974	186982	186968	186968	sir	9569	" says Mr. George with military brevity . "
187062	187063	187058	187058	I	0	" "
187070	187080	187058	187058	I	0	" cries Grandfather Smallweed , screwing up his eyes . "
187124	187155	187117	187117	I	0	" Mr. George sits squared in exactly the same attitude , looks at the painted ceiling , and says never a word . The irascible Mr. Smallweed scratches the air . "
187160	187173	187117	187117	I	0	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his methodical , subdued , uninterested way , "
187186	187187	187177	187177	you	515	" "
187202	187207	187191	187191	I	0	" repeats Mr. George . "
187221	187222	187213	187213	you	515	" "
187238	187243	187236	187236	sir	9569	" repeats Mr. George . "
187259	187275	187246	187246	you	515	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn , suddenly handing him some sheets of written paper tied together . "
187289	187358	187369	187369	you	9569	" repeats Mr. George . All three repetitions Mr. George pronounces in a mechanical manner , looking straight at Mr. Tulkinghorn ; nor does he so much as glance at the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , that has been given to him for his inspection though he still holds it in his hand , but continues to look at the lawyer with an air of troubled meditation . "
187361	187366	187369	187369	you	9569	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn . "
187372	187373	187369	187369	you	9569	" "
187378	187389	187376	187376	sir	9569	" replies Mr. George , rising erect and looking immense , "
187407	187417	187395	187395	you	9569	" Mr. Tulkinghorn , outwardly quite undisturbed , demands , "
187421	187422	187395	187395	you	9569	" "
187427	187432	187395	187395	you	9569	" returns the trooper . "
187521	187532	187518	187518	my	0	" says Mr. George , looking round upon the company , "
187538	187623	187624	187626	my dear friend	12511	" With that , he takes three strides forward to replace the papers on the lawyer 's table and three strides backward to resume his former station , where he stands perfectly upright , now looking at the ground and now at the painted ceiling , with his hands behind him as if to prevent himself from accepting any other document whatever . Under this provocation , Mr. Smallweed 's favourite adjective of disparagement is so close to his tongue that he begins the words "
187627	187631	187716	187722	the best judge of your own interest	4648	" with the monosyllable "
187634	187713	187716	187722	the best judge of your own interest	4648	" thus converting the possessive pronoun into brimmy and appearing to have an impediment in his speech . Once past this difficulty , however , he exhorts his dear friend in the tenderest manner not to be rash , but to do what so eminent a gentleman requires , and to do it with a good grace , confident that it must be unobjectionable as well as profitable . Mr. Tulkinghorn merely utters an occasional sentence , as , "
187726	187727	187720	187720	your	4647	" "
187737	187738	187740	187740	yourself	4647	" "
187745	187746	187743	187743	yourself	4647	" "
187759	187833	187834	187834	I	0	" These he utters with an appearance of perfect indifference as he looks over the papers on his table and prepares to write a letter . Mr. George looks distrustfully from the painted ceiling to the ground , from the ground to Mr. Smallweed , from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Tulkinghorn , and from Mr. Tulkinghorn to the painted ceiling again , often in his perplexity changing the leg on which he rests . "
187841	187846	187834	187834	I	0	" says Mr. George , "
187913	187921	187886	187886	you	4647	" Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly shakes his head . "
187987	187988	187977	187977	you	4647	" "
187997	187998	188000	188000	he	520	" "
188002	188011	188000	188000	he	520	" Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly sits down to write . "
188016	188030	188014	188014	sir	9569	" says the trooper , looking into his hat after another disconcerted pause , "
188112	188125	188100	188100	I	0	" says Mr. George , passing his hand hopelessly across his brow , "
188141	188200	188201	188201	I	0	" Mr. Smallweed , hearing that this authority is an old soldier , so strongly inculcates the expediency of the trooper 's taking counsel with him , and particularly informing him of its being a question of five guineas or more , that Mr. George engages to go and see him . Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing either way . "
188215	188220	188213	188213	sir	9569	" says the trooper , "
188253	188254	188242	188243	Mr. Smallweed	490	" "
188282	188283	188268	188268	you	10042	" "
188296	188320	188291	188291	yourself	10042	" The trooper retires to a distant part of the room and resumes his curious inspection of the boxes , strong and otherwise . "
188334	188366	188367	188367	I	0	" whispers Grandfather Smallweed , drawing the lawyer down to his level by the lapel of his coat and flashing some half - quenched green fire out of his angry eyes , "
188423	188473	188418	188418	him	11805	" This vehement conjuration the old gentleman accompanies with such a thrust at his granddaughter that it is too much for his strength , and he slips away out of his chair , drawing Mr. Tulkinghorn with him , until he is arrested by Judy , and well shaken . "
188484	188491	188418	188418	him	11805	" Mr. Tulkinghorn then remarks coolly . "
188526	188539	188523	188524	a grandmother	4675	" to the imperturbable Judy , who only looks at the fire , "
188645	188660	188642	188643	Mr. George	515	" says Grandfather Smallweed , winking at the lawyer hideously as he releases him , "
188673	189047	189048	189048	She	4683	" Mr. Tulkinghorn , with some shadowy sign of amusement manifesting itself through his self - possession , stands on the hearth - rug with his back to the fire , watching the disappearance of Mr. Smallweed and acknowledging the trooper 's parting salute with one slight nod . It is more difficult to get rid of the old gentleman , Mr. George finds , than to bear a hand in carrying him downstairs , for when he is replaced in his conveyance , he is so loquacious on the subject of the guineas and retains such an affectionate hold of his button - having , in truth , a secret longing to rip his coat open and rob him - that some degree of force is necessary on the trooper 's part to effect a separation . It is accomplished at last , and he proceeds alone in quest of his adviser . By the cloisterly Temple , and by Whitefriars there , not without a glance at Hanging - Sword Alley , which would seem to be something in his way , and by Blackfriars Bridge , and Blackfriars Road , Mr. George sedately marches to a street of little shops lying somewhere in that ganglion of roads from Kent and Surrey , and of streets from the bridges of London , centring in the far - famed elephant who has lost his castle formed of a thousand four - horse coaches to a stronger iron monster than he , ready to chop him into mince - meat any day he dares . To one of the little shops in this street , which is a musician 's shop , having a few fiddles in the window , and some Pan 's pipes and a tambourine , and a triangle , and certain elongated scraps of music , Mr. George directs his massive tread . And halting at a few paces from it , as he sees a soldierly looking woman , with her outer skirts tucked up , come forth with a small wooden tub , and in that tub commence a - whisking and a - splashing on the margin of the pavement , Mr. George says to himself , "
189075	189136	189137	189137	George	515	" The subject of this reflection is at all events so occupied in washing greens at present that she remains unsuspicious of Mr. George 's approach until , lifting up herself and her tub together when she has poured the water off into the gutter , she finds him standing near her . Her reception of him is not flattering . "
189153	189196	189197	189197	I	0	" The trooper , without remarking on this welcome , follows into the musical - instrument shop , where the lady places her tub of greens upon the counter , and having shaken hands with him , rests her arms upon it . "
189200	189204	189205	189205	George	515	" she says , "
189227	189228	189219	189219	You	515	" "
189244	189245	189239	189239	I	0	" "
189251	189256	189246	189246	You	553	" says Mrs. Bagnet . "
189268	189269	189266	189266	you	553	" "
189279	189286	189276	189276	I	0	" returns the trooper good- humouredly . "
189289	189297	189276	189276	I	0	" cries Mrs. Bagnet , something shrilly . "
189329	189460	189461	189462	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Mrs. Bagnet is not at all an ill - looking woman . Rather large- boned , a little coarse in the grain , and freckled by the sun and wind which have tanned her hair upon the forehead , but healthy , wholesome , and bright - eyed . A strong , busy , active , honest - faced woman of from forty - five to fifty . Clean , hardy , and so economically dressed though substantially that the only article of ornament of which she stands possessed appear 's to be her wedding - ring , around which her finger has grown to be so large since it was put on that it will never come off again until it shall mingle with Mrs. Bagnet 's dust . "
189464	189469	189461	189462	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" says the trooper , "
189493	189494	189486	189486	You	553	" "
189511	189516	189519	189519	George	515	" Mrs. Bagnet rejoins . "
189550	189551	189542	189542	SHE'D	4685	" "
189561	189571	189542	189542	SHE'D	4685	" returns the trooper half laughingly , half seriously , "
189632	189694	189629	189629	Mat	552	" Mrs. Bagnet , who seems in a virtuous way to be under little reserve with a good sort of fellow , but to be another good sort of fellow herself for that matter , receives this compliment by flicking Mr. George in the face with a head of greens and taking her tub into the little room behind the shop . "
189702	189715	189697	189697	Quebec	554	" says George , following , on invitation , into that department . "
189728	189827	189725	189726	your Bluffy	4690	" These young ladies - not supposed to have been actually christened by the names applied to them , though always so called in the family from the places of their birth in barracks - are respectively employed on three - legged stools , the younger some five or six years old in learning her letters out of a penny primer , the elder eight or nine perhaps in teaching her and sewing with great assiduity . Both hail Mr. George with acclamations as an old friend and after some kissing and romping plant their stools beside him . "
189834	189839	189831	189832	young Woolwich	556	" says Mr. George . "
189845	189868	189831	189832	young Woolwich	556	" cries Mrs. Bagnet , turning about from her saucepans for she is cooking dinner with a bright flush on her face . "
189894	189895	189882	189883	his father	1799	" "
189902	189911	189914	189914	you	4691	" cries Mr. George , slapping his thigh . "
189916	189921	189914	189914	you	4691	" says Mrs. Bagnet . "
189936	189937	189939	189939	Mat	552	" "
189955	189960	189947	189947	you	4691	" says Mr. George . "
190026	190324	190325	190325	George	515	" Mr. George is becoming thoughtful , sitting before the fire in the whitewashed room , which has a sanded floor and a barrack smell and contains nothing superfluous and has not a visible speck of dirt or dust in it , from the faces of Quebec and Malta to the bright tin pots and pannikins upon the dresser shelves - Mr. George is becoming thoughtful , sitting here while Mrs. Bagnet is busy , when Mr. Bagnet and young Woolwich opportunely come home . Mr. Bagnet is an ex- artilleryman , tall and upright , with shaggy eyebrows and whiskers like the fibres of a coco - nut , not a hair upon his head , and a torrid complexion . His voice , short , deep , and resonant , is not at all unlike the tones of the instrument to which he is devoted . Indeed there may be generally observed in him an unbending , unyielding , brass - bound air , as if he were himself the bassoon of the human orchestra . Young Woolwich is the type and model of a young drummer . Both father and son salute the trooper heartily . He saying , in due season , that he has come to advise with Mr. Bagnet , Mr. Bagnet hospitably declares that he will hear of no business until after dinner and that his friend shall not partake of his counsel without first partaking of boiled pork and greens . The trooper yielding to this invitation , he and Mr. Bagnet , not to embarrass the domestic preparations , go forth to take a turn up and down the little street , which they promenade with measured tread and folded arms , as if it were a rampart . "
190327	190332	190325	190325	George	515	" says Mr. Bagnet . "
190389	190390	190379	190381	the old girl	4703	" "
190397	190402	190395	190395	Mat	552	" replies the other . "
190415	190416	190403	190403	I	0	" "
190419	190431	190403	190403	I	0	" returns Mr. Bagnet in short sentences , bassoon - like . "
190477	190478	190463	190465	The old girl	4703	" "
190483	190488	190479	190479	You	552	" says Mr. George . "
190492	190496	190498	190498	you	552	" pursues Bagnet , "
190549	190550	190551	190551	I	0	" "
190562	190563	190564	190566	The old girl	4703	" "
190568	190617	190564	190566	The old girl	4703	" says Mr. Bagnet , acquiescing , ' saves . Has a stocking somewhere . With money in it . I never saw it . But I know she 's got it . Wait till the greens is off her mind . Then she 'll set you up . "
190618	190624	190626	190627	Mr. George	515	" She is a treasure ! "
190629	190740	190741	190741	George	515	" She 's more . But I never own to it before her . Discipline must be maintained . It was the old girl that brought out my musical abilities . I should have been in the artillery now but for the old girl . Six years I hammered at the fiddle . Ten at the flute . The old girl said it would n't do ; intention good , but want of flexibility ; try the bassoon . The old girl borrowed a bassoon from the bandmaster of the Rifle Regiment . I practised in the trenches . Got on , got another , get a living by it ! "
190758	190763	190765	190766	Mr. Bagnet	552	" The old girl , "
190770	190816	190765	190766	Mr. Bagnet	552	" is a thoroughly fine woman . Consequently she is like a thoroughly fine day . Gets finer as she gets on . I never saw the old girl 's equal . But I never own to it before her . Discipline must be maintained ! "
191256	191269	191271	191271	he	552	" That 's the whole of it , is it , George ? "
191273	191281	191271	191271	he	552	" That 's the whole of it . "
191282	191290	191271	191271	he	552	" You act according to my opinion ? "
191291	191297	191299	191299	George	515	" I shall be guided , "
191301	191306	191299	191299	George	515	" entirely by it . "
191307	191311	191313	191314	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Old girl , "
191316	191332	191313	191314	Mr. Bagnet	552	" give him my opinion . You know it . Tell him what it is . "
191574	191579	191580	191580	he	515	" A family home , "
191587	191689	191580	191580	he	515	" however small it is , makes a man like me look lonely . But it 's well I never made that evolution of matrimony . I should n't have been fit for it . I am such a vagabond still , even at my present time of life , that I could n't hold to the gallery a month together if it was a regular pursuit or if I did n't camp there , gipsy fashion . Come ! I disgrace nobody and cumber nobody ; that 's something . I have not done that for many a long year ! "
191778	191789	191764	191765	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Who is that ? What are you doing there ? "
191790	191805	191941	191942	the trooper	3804	" I ask your pardon , sir . It 's George . The sergeant . "
191806	191822	191764	191765	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" And could n't George , the sergeant , see that my door was locked ? "
191823	191842	191844	191845	the trooper	3804	" Why , no , sir , I could n't . At any rate , I did n't , "
191850	191865	191844	191845	the trooper	3804	" Have you changed your mind ? Or are you in the same mind ? "
191879	191887	191871	191871	he	271	" In the same mind , sir . "
191888	191907	191909	191910	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" I thought so . That 's sufficient . You can go . So you are the man , "
191919	191930	191909	191910	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" in whose hiding - place Mr. Gridley was found ? "
191931	191939	191941	191942	the trooper	3804	" Yes , I AM the man , "
191951	191957	191941	191942	the trooper	3804	" What then , sir ? "
191958	192001	191909	191910	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" What then ? I do n't like your associates . You should not have seen the inside of my door this morning if I had thought of your being that man . Gridley ? A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow . "
192062	192069	192070	192071	the trooper	3804	" A pretty character to bear , "
192082	192091	192078	192078	he	3804	" A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow ! "
192414	192418	192364	192364	their	11121	" will out . "
193521	193530	193532	193532	Volumnia	561	" I occasionally meet on my staircase here , "
193554	193572	193532	193532	Volumnia	561	" one of the prettiest girls , I think , that I ever saw in my life . "
193573	193581	193583	193584	Sir Leicester	268	" A PROTEGEE of my Lady 's , "
193586	193618	193620	193621	Miss Volumnia	561	" I thought so . I felt sure that some uncommon eye must have picked that girl out . She really is a marvel . A dolly sort of beauty perhaps , "
193628	193642	193643	193644	Sir Leicester	268	" but in its way , perfect ; such bloom I never saw ! "
193662	193665	193667	193668	my Lady	934	" Indeed , "
193671	193697	193667	193668	my Lady	934	" if there is any uncommon eye in the case , it is Mrs. Rouncewell 's , and not mine . Rosa is her discovery . "
193698	193705	193647	193647	his	268	" Your maid , I suppose ? "
193706	193724	193667	193668	my Lady	934	" No . My anything ; pet - secretary - messenger - I do n't know what . "
193725	193771	193773	193773	Volumnia	561	" You like to have her about you , as you would like to have a flower , or a bird , or a picture , or a poodle - no , not a poodle , though - or anything else that was equally pretty ? "
193777	193822	193773	193773	Volumnia	561	" Yes , how charming now ! And how well that delightful old soul Mrs. Rouncewell is looking . She must be an immense age , and yet she is as active and handsome ! She is the dearest friend I have , positively ! "
193867	193874	193864	193864	he	268	" You are right , Volumnia , "
193883	193895	193864	193864	he	268	" She has no daughter of her own , has she ? "
193896	193915	193916	193916	My	0	" Mrs. Rouncewell ? No , Volumnia . She has a son . Indeed , she had two . "
193944	193979	193981	193982	Sir Leicester	268	" And it is a remarkable example of the confusion into which the present age has fallen ; of the obliteration of landmarks , the opening of floodgates , and the uprooting of distinctions , "
193987	194009	193981	193982	Sir Leicester	268	" that I have been informed by Mr. Tulkinghorn that Mrs. Rouncewell 's son has been invited to go into Parliament . "
194018	194023	194025	194026	Sir Leicester	268	" Yes , indeed , "
194028	194032	194025	194026	Sir Leicester	268	" Into Parliament . "
194033	194050	194052	194052	Volumnia	561	" I never heard of such a thing ! Good gracious , what is the man ? "
194054	194066	194052	194052	Volumnia	561	" He is called , I believe - an - ironmaster . "
194117	194154	194156	194157	Sir Leicester	268	" He has declined the proposal , if my information from Mr. Tulkinghorn be correct , as I have no doubt it is . Mr. Tulkinghorn being always correct and exact ; still that does not , "
194159	194183	194156	194157	Sir Leicester	268	" that does not lessen the anomaly , which is fraught with strange considerations - startling considerations , as it appears to me . "
194220	194229	194230	194230	he	268	" I must beg you , my Lady , "
194236	194263	194230	194230	he	268	" to remain a few moments , for this individual of whom I speak arrived this evening shortly before dinner and requested in a very becoming note "
194279	194335	194265	194266	Sir Leicester	268	" I am bound to say , in a very becoming and well - expressed note , the favour of a short interview with yourself and MYself on the subject of this young girl . As it appeared that he wished to depart to- night , I replied that we would see him before retiring . "
194384	194406	194378	194379	Sir Leicester	268	" Make my compliments to Mr. Rouncewell , in the housekeeper 's apartments , and say I can receive him now . "
194512	194546	194547	194551	The head of the Dedlocks	4828	" Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , as I have already apologized for intruding on you , I can not do better than be very brief . I thank you , Sir Leicester . "
194571	194605	194567	194567	his	334	" In these busy times , when so many great undertakings are in progress , people like myself have so many workmen in so many places that we are always on the flight . "
194731	194739	194741	194742	Mr. Rouncewell	334	" Lady Dedlock has been so kind , "
194753	194857	194741	194742	Mr. Rouncewell	334	" as to place near her a young beauty of the name of Rosa . Now , my son has fallen in love with Rosa and has asked my consent to his proposing marriage to her and to their becoming engaged if she will take him - which I suppose she will . I have never seen Rosa until to - day , but I have some confidence in my son 's good sense - even in love . I find her what he represents her , to the best of my judgment ; and my mother speaks of her with great commendation . "
194858	194866	194868	194869	my Lady	934	" She in all respects deserves it , "
194871	194901	194868	194869	my Lady	934	" I am happy , Lady Dedlock , that you say so , and I need not comment on the value to me of your kind opinion of her . "
194902	194905	194907	194908	Sir Leicester	268	" That , "
194923	194929	194914	194914	he	268	" must be quite unnecessary . "
194930	195097	194868	194869	my Lady	934	" Quite unnecessary , Sir Leicester . Now , my son is a very young man , and Rosa is a very young woman . As I made my way , so my son must make his ; and his being married at present is out of the question . But supposing I gave my consent to his engaging himself to this pretty girl , if this pretty girl will engage herself to him , I think it a piece of candour to say at once - I am sure , Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , you will understand and excuse me - I should make it a condition that she did not remain at Chesney Wold . Therefore , before communicating further with my son , I take the liberty of saying that if her removal would be in any way inconvenient or objectionable , I will hold the matter over with him for any reasonable time and leave it precisely where it is . "
195161	195169	195171	195172	Sir Leicester	268	" Am I to understand , sir , "
195174	195181	195183	195183	he	268	" and is my Lady to understand "
195212	195250	195183	195183	he	268	" am I to understand , Mr. Rouncewell , and is my Lady to understand , sir , that you consider this young woman too good for Chesney Wold or likely to be injured by remaining here ? "
195251	195258	195183	195183	he	268	" Certainly not , Sir Leicester , "
195259	195267	195183	195183	he	268	" I am glad to hear it . "
195274	195280	195282	195283	my Lady	934	" Pray , Mr. Rouncewell , "
195305	195313	195294	195294	her	934	" explain to me what you mean . "
195314	195328	195330	195330	her	934	" Willingly , Lady Dedlock . There is nothing I could desire more . "
195383	195497	195380	195380	her	934	" I am the son of your housekeeper , Lady Dedlock , and passed my childhood about this house . My mother has lived here half a century and will die here I have no doubt . She is one of those examples - perhaps as good a one as there is - of love , and attachment , and fidelity in such a nation , which England may well be proud of , but of which no order can appropriate the whole pride or the whole merit , because such an instance bespeaks high worth on two sides - on the great side assuredly , on the small one no less assuredly . "
195538	195557	195523	195523	he	268	" Pardon me for saying what is so obvious , but I would n't have it hastily supposed , "
195569	195649	195563	195563	his	268	" that I am ashamed of my mother 's position here , or wanting in all just respect for Chesney Wold and the family . I certainly may have desired - I certainly have desired , Lady Dedlock - that my mother should retire after so many years and end her days with me . But as I have found that to sever this strong bond would be to break her heart , I have long abandoned that idea . "
195676	195681	195683	195684	the visitor	10509	" I have been , "
195692	195790	195802	195802	he	4849	" an apprentice and a workman . I have lived on workman 's wages , years and years , and beyond a certain point have had to educate myself . My wife was a foreman 's daughter , and plainly brought up . We have three daughters besides this son of whom I have spoken , and being fortunately able to give them greater advantages than we have had ourselves , we have educated them well , very well . It has been one of our great cares and pleasures to make them worthy of any station . "
195808	195816	195802	195802	he	4849	" even of the Chesney Wold station . "
195832	196103	196104	196105	Sir Leicester	268	" All this is so frequent , Lady Dedlock , where I live , and among the class to which I belong , that what would be generally called unequal marriages are not of such rare occurrence with us as elsewhere . A son will sometimes make it known to his father that he has fallen in love , say , with a young woman in the factory . The father , who once worked in a factory himself , will be a little disappointed at first very possibly . It may be that he had other views for his son . However , the chances are that having ascertained the young woman to be of unblemished character , he will say to his son , ' I must be quite sure you are in earnest here . This is a serious matter for both of you . Therefore I shall have this girl educated for two years , ' or it may be , ' I shall place this girl at the same school with your sisters for such a time , during which you will give me your word and honour to see her only so often . If at the expiration of that time , when she has so far profited by her advantages as that you may be upon a fair equality , you are both in the same mind , I will do my part to make you happy . ' I know of several cases such as I describe , my Lady , and I think they indicate to me my own course now . "
196115	196119	196121	196122	Sir Leicester	268	" Mr. Rouncewell , "
196148	196160	196121	196122	Sir Leicester	268	" do you draw a parallel between Chesney Wold and a - "
196169	196173	196162	196162	he	268	" a factory ? "
196174	196210	196211	196212	Sir Leicester	268	" I need not reply , Sir Leicester , that the two places are very different ; but for the purposes of this case , I think a parallel may be justly drawn between them . "
196239	196273	196214	196214	his	268	" Are you aware , sir , that this young woman whom my Lady - my Lady - has placed near her person was brought up at the village school outside the gates ? "
196274	196299	196214	196214	his	268	" Sir Leicester , I am quite aware of it . A very good school it is , and handsomely supported by this family . "
196300	196306	196308	196309	Sir Leicester	268	" Then , Mr. Rouncewell , "
196311	196326	196308	196309	Sir Leicester	268	" the application of what you have said is , to me , incomprehensible . "
196327	196341	196214	196214	his	268	" Will it be more comprehensible , Sir Leicester , if I say , "
196349	196371	196342	196343	the ironmaster	4830	" that I do not regard the village school as teaching everything desirable to be known by my son 's wife ? "
196506	196522	196523	196523	She	4862	" My Lady , I beg your pardon . Permit me , for one moment ! "
196534	196747	196523	196523	She	4862	" Mr. Rouncewell , our views of duty , and our views of station , and our views of education , and our views of - in short , ALL our views - are so diametrically opposed , that to prolong this discussion must be repellent to your feelings and repellent to my own . This young woman is honoured with my Lady 's notice and favour . If she wishes to withdraw herself from that notice and favour or if she chooses to place herself under the influence of any one who may in his peculiar opinions - you will allow me to say , in his peculiar opinions , though I readily admit that he is not accountable for them to me - who may , in his peculiar opinions , withdraw her from that notice and favour , she is at any time at liberty to do so . We are obliged to you for the plainness with which you have spoken . It will have no effect of itself , one way or other , on the young woman 's position here . Beyond this , we can make no terms ; and here we beg - if you will be so good - to leave the subject . "
196771	196807	196765	196765	He	10509	" Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , allow me to thank you for your attention and only to observe that I shall very seriously recommend my son to conquer his present inclinations . Good night ! "
196808	196812	196814	196815	Sir Leicester	268	" Mr. Rouncewell , "
196827	196870	196814	196815	Sir Leicester	268	" it is late , and the roads are dark . I hope your time is not so precious but that you will allow my Lady and myself to offer you the hospitality of Chesney Wold , for to- night at least . "
196871	196876	196878	196879	my Lady	934	" I hope so , "
196881	196915	196878	196879	my Lady	934	" I am much obliged to you , but I have to travel all night in order to reach a distant part of the country punctually at an appointed time in the morning . "
196978	196995	196976	196976	her	338	" Come to me , child . Tell me the truth . Are you in love ? "
196996	197002	197003	197004	My Lady	934	" Oh ! My Lady ! "
197017	197029	197003	197004	My Lady	934	" Who is it ? Is it Mrs. Rouncewell 's grandson ? "
197030	197055	196976	196976	her	338	" Yes , if you please , my Lady . But I do n't know that I am in love with him - yet . "
197056	197074	197003	197004	My Lady	934	" Yet , you silly little thing ! Do you know that he loves YOU , yet ? "
197075	197087	197003	197004	My Lady	934	" I think he likes me a little , my Lady . "
197130	197152	197003	197004	My Lady	934	" Listen to me , child . You are young and true , and I believe you are attached to me . "
197153	197177	197003	197004	My Lady	934	" Indeed I am , my Lady . Indeed there is nothing in the world I would n't do to show how much . "
197178	197200	197003	197004	My Lady	934	" And I do n't think you would wish to leave me just yet , Rosa , even for a lover ? "
197201	197211	197003	197004	My Lady	934	" No , my Lady ! Oh , no ! "
197226	197262	197263	197263	Rosa	338	" Confide in me , my child . Do n't fear me . I wish you to be happy , and will make you so - if I can make anybody happy on this earth . "
198061	198109	198163	198164	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Three high - backed chairs , a table and cover , long - necked bottle containing wine , one flask , one Spanish female 's costume , three - quarter face portrait of Miss Jogg the model , and a suit of armour containing Don Quixote . "
198111	198162	198163	198164	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" One stone terrace cracked , one gondola in distance , one Venetian senator 's dress complete , richly embroidered white satin costume with profile portrait of Miss Jogg the model , one Scimitar superbly mounted in gold with jewelled handle , elaborate Moorish dress very rare , and Othello . "
198528	198536	198537	198537	he	268	" The man who wrote this article , "
198561	198569	198537	198537	he	268	" has a well - balanced mind . "
198661	198666	198644	198644	his	268	" Very true indeed , "
198667	198672	198644	198644	his	268	" Very properly put , "
198673	198683	198644	198644	his	268	" I have frequently made the same remark myself , "
198728	198742	198719	198722	the Mercury in powder	4932	" The young man , my Lady , of the name of Guppy . "
198755	198765	198743	198744	Sir Leicester	268	" The young man of the name of Guppy ? "
198797	198800	198802	198803	Sir Leicester	268	" Pray , "
198807	198826	198802	198803	Sir Leicester	268	" what do you mean by announcing with this abruptness a young man of the name of Guppy ? "
198827	198862	198867	198867	Mercury	280	" I beg your pardon , Sir Leicester , but my Lady said she would see the young man whenever he called . I was not aware that you were here , Sir Leicester . "
198887	198902	198875	198882	the young man of the name of Guppy	13461	" What do you come calling here for and getting ME into a row ? "
198903	198915	198917	198918	my Lady	934	" It 's quite right . I gave him those directions , "
198920	198927	198917	198918	my Lady	934	" Let the young man wait . "
198928	198950	198951	198952	Sir Leicester	268	" By no means , my Lady . Since he has your orders to come , I will not interrupt you . "
199024	199040	199009	199009	She	266	" That your ladyship would have the kindness to oblige me with a little conversation , "
199047	199064	199009	199009	She	266	" You are , of course , the person who has written me so many letters ? "
199065	199083	199009	199009	She	266	" Several , your ladyship . Several before your ladyship condescended to favour me with an answer . "
199084	199104	199105	199106	Mr. Guppy	301	" And could you not take the same means of rendering a Conversation unnecessary ? Can you not still ? "
199113	199116	199108	199108	his	301	" No ! "
199122	199189	199119	199119	his	301	" You have been strangely importunate . If it should appear , after all , that what you have to say does not concern me - and I do n't know how it can , and do n't expect that it will - you will allow me to cut you short with but little ceremony . Say what you have to say , if you please . "
199223	199232	199234	199236	the young man	10205	" With your ladyship 's permission , then , "
199238	199366	199234	199236	the young man	10205	" I will now enter on my business . Hem ! I am , as I told your ladyship in my first letter , in the law . Being in the law , I have learnt the habit of not committing myself in writing , and therefore I did not mention to your ladyship the name of the firm with which I am connected and in which my standing - and I may add income - is tolerably good . I may now state to your ladyship , in confidence , that the name of that firm is Kenge and Carboy , of Lincoln 's Inn , which may not be altogether unknown to your ladyship in connexion with the case in Chancery of Jarndyce and Jarndyce . "
199395	199407	199409	199410	Mr. Guppy	301	" Now , I may say to your ladyship at once , "
199416	199459	199409	199410	Mr. Guppy	301	" it is no matter arising out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce that made me so desirous to speak to your ladyship , which conduct I have no doubt did appear , and does appear , obtrusive - in fact , almost blackguardly . "
199482	199549	199478	199479	Mr. Guppy	301	" If it had been Jarndyce and Jarndyce , I should have gone at once to your ladyship 's solicitor , Mr. Tulkinghorn , of the Fields . I have the pleasure of being acquainted with Mr. Tulkinghorn - at least we move when we meet one another - and if it had been any business of that sort , I should have gone to him . "
199559	199566	199550	199551	My Lady	934	" You had better sit down . "
199567	199572	199573	199574	Mr. Guppy	301	" Thank your ladyship . "
199578	199583	199573	199574	Mr. Guppy	301	" Now , your ladyship "
199622	199687	199688	199689	My Lady	934	" I - Oh , yes ! - I place myself entirely in your ladyship 's hands . If your ladyship was to make any complaint to Kenge and Carboy or to Mr. Tulkinghorn of the present visit , I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation . That , I openly admit . Consequently , I rely upon your ladyship 's honour . "
199714	199719	199721	199722	Mr. Guppy	301	" Thank your ladyship , "
199724	199794	199721	199722	Mr. Guppy	301	" quite satisfactory . Now - I - dash it ! - The fact is that I put down a head or two here of the order of the points I thought of touching upon , and they 're written short , and I ca n't quite make out what they mean . If your ladyship will excuse me taking it to the window half a moment , I - "
199820	199830	199814	199814	he	301	" I beg your pardon , I am sure . "
199868	199890	199843	199843	He	301	" C.S. What 's C.S. for ? Oh ! C.S. ! Oh , I know ! Yes , to be sure ! "
199896	199902	199904	199905	Mr. Guppy	301	" I am not aware , "
199916	199941	199904	199905	Mr. Guppy	301	" whether your ladyship ever happened to hear of , or to see , a young lady of the name of Miss Esther Summerson . "
199951	199968	199942	199943	My Lady	934	" I saw a young lady of that name not long ago . This past autumn . "
199969	199983	199985	199986	Mr. Guppy	301	" Now , did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody ? "
200020	200023	200013	200013	her	934	" No . "
200024	200032	200013	200013	her	934	" Not like your ladyship 's family ? "
200033	200036	200013	200013	her	934	" No . "
200037	200043	200045	200046	Mr. Guppy	301	" I think your ladyship , "
200048	200057	200045	200046	Mr. Guppy	301	" can hardly remember Miss Summerson 's face ? "
200058	200075	200013	200013	her	934	" I remember the young lady very well . What has this to do with me ? "
200076	200237	200045	200046	Mr. Guppy	301	" Your ladyship , I do assure you that having Miss Summerson 's image imprinted on my ' eart - which I mention in confidence - I found , when I had the honour of going over your ladyship 's mansion of Chesney Wold while on a short out in the county of Lincolnshire with a friend , such a resemblance between Miss Esther Summerson and your ladyship 's own portrait that it completely knocked me over , so much so that I did n't at the moment even know what it WAS that knocked me over . And now I have the honour of beholding your ladyship near I have often , since that , taken the liberty of looking at your ladyship in your carriage in the park , when I dare say you was not aware of me , but I never saw your ladyship so near , it 's really more surprising than I thought it . "
200324	200328	200330	200331	Mr. Guppy	301	" Your ladyship , "
200339	200359	200330	200331	Mr. Guppy	301	" I am coming to that . Dash these notes ! Oh ! ' Mrs. Chadband . ' Yes . "
200401	200410	200397	200397	her	934	" A - stop a minute , though ! "
200416	200435	200411	200412	Mr. Guppy	301	" E.S. twice ? Oh , yes ! Yes , I see my way now , right on . "
200455	200617	200451	200452	Mr. Guppy	301	" Your ladyship , there is a mystery about Miss Esther Summerson 's birth and bringing up . I am informed of that fact because - which I mention in confidence - I know it in the way of my profession at Kenge and Carboy 's . Now , as I have already mentioned to your ladyship , Miss Summerson 's image is imprinted on my ' eart . If I could clear this mystery for her , or prove her to be well related , or find that having the honour to be a remote branch of your ladyship 's family she had a right to be made a party in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , why , I might make a sort of a claim upon Miss Summerson to look with an eye of more dedicated favour on my proposals than she has exactly done as yet . In fact , as yet she has n't favoured them at all . "
200631	200644	200646	200647	Mr. Guppy	301	" Now , it 's a very singular circumstance , your ladyship , "
200649	200752	200646	200647	Mr. Guppy	301	" though one of those circumstances that do fall in the way of us professional men - which I may call myself , for though not admitted , yet I have had a present of my articles made to me by Kenge and Carboy , on my mother 's advancing from the principal of her little income the money for the stamp , which comes heavy - that I have encountered the person who lived as servant with the lady who brought Miss Summerson up before Mr. Jarndyce took charge of her . That lady was a Miss Barbary , your ladyship . "
200799	200804	200806	200807	Mr. Guppy	301	" Did your ladyship , "
200809	200818	200806	200807	Mr. Guppy	301	" ever happen to hear of Miss Barbary ? "
200819	200831	200806	200807	Mr. Guppy	301	" I do n't know . I think so . Yes . "
200832	200845	200846	200846	My	0	" Was Miss Barbary at all connected with your ladyship 's family ? "
200862	200866	200868	200869	Mr. Guppy	301	" NOT connected ? "
200871	200891	200868	200869	Mr. Guppy	301	" Oh ! Not to your ladyship 's knowledge , perhaps ? Ah ! But might be ? Yes . "
200904	200997	200898	200898	she	4959	" Very good ! Now , this Miss Barbary was extremely close - seems to have been extraordinarily close for a female , females being generally in common life at least rather given to conversation - and my witness never had an idea whether she possessed a single relative . On one occasion , and only one , she seems to have been confidential to my witness on a single point , and she then told her that the little girl 's real name was not Esther Summerson , but Esther Hawdon . "
200998	201002	201003	201004	Mr. Guppy	301	" My God ! "
201155	201166	201452	201452	she	934	" Your ladyship is acquainted with the name of Hawdon ? "
201167	201174	201452	201452	she	934	" I have heard it before . "
201175	201189	201452	201452	she	934	" Name of any collateral or remote branch of your ladyship 's family ? "
201190	201193	201452	201452	she	934	" No . "
201194	201200	201202	201203	Mr. Guppy	301	" Now , your ladyship , "
201205	201338	201202	201203	Mr. Guppy	301	" I come to the last point of the case , so far as I have got it up . It 's going on , and I shall gather it up closer and closer as it goes on . Your ladyship must know - if your ladyship do n't happen , by any chance , to know already - that there was found dead at the house of a person named Krook , near Chancery Lane , some time ago , a law - writer in great distress . Upon which law - writer there was an inquest , and which law - writer was an anonymous character , his name being unknown . But , your ladyship , I have discovered very lately that that law- writer 's name was Hawdon . "
201339	201347	201452	201452	she	934	" And what is THAT to me ? "
201348	201441	201202	201203	Mr. Guppy	301	" Aye , your ladyship , that 's the question ! Now , your ladyship , a queer thing happened after that man 's death . A lady started up , a disguised lady , your ladyship , who went to look at the scene of action and went to look at his grave . She hired a crossing- sweeping boy to show it her . If your ladyship would wish to have the boy produced in corroboration of this statement , I can lay my hand upon him at any time . "
201461	201476	201478	201479	Mr. Guppy	301	" Oh , I assure your ladyship it 's a very queer start indeed , "
201481	201511	201478	201479	Mr. Guppy	301	" If you was to hear him tell about the rings that sparkled on her fingers when she took her glove off , you 'd think it quite romantic . "
201559	201596	201608	201608	her	934	" It was supposed , your ladyship , that he left no rag or scrap behind him by which he could be possibly identified . But he did . He left a bundle of old letters . "
201615	201638	201608	201608	her	934	" They were taken and secreted . And to - morrow night , your ladyship , they will come into my possession . "
201639	201651	201608	201608	her	934	" Still I ask you , what is this to me ? "
201652	201661	201662	201663	Mr. Guppy	301	" Your ladyship , I conclude with that . "
201666	201852	201662	201663	Mr. Guppy	301	" If you think there 's enough in this chain of circumstances put together - in the undoubted strong likeness of this young lady to your ladyship , which is a positive fact for a jury ; in her having been brought up by Miss Barbary ; in Miss Barbary stating Miss Summerson 's real name to be Hawdon ; in your ladyship 's knowing both these names VERY WELL ; and in Hawdon 's dying as he did - to give your ladyship a family interest in going further into the case , I will bring these papers here . I do n't know what they are , except that they are old letters : I have never had them in my possession yet . I will bring those papers here as soon as I get them and go over them for the first time with your ladyship . I have told your ladyship my object . I have told your ladyship that I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation if any complaint was made , and all is in strict confidence . "
201938	201945	201947	201948	my Lady	934	" You may bring the letters , "
201950	201955	201947	201948	my Lady	934	" if you choose . "
201956	201970	201972	201973	Mr. Guppy	301	" Your ladyship is not very encouraging , upon my word and honour , "
201979	201986	201987	201987	she	934	" You may bring the letters , "
201994	202000	201987	201987	she	934	" if you - please . "
202001	202014	201947	201948	my Lady	934	" It shall he done . I wish your ladyship good day . "
202053	202071	202073	202074	Mr. Guppy	301	" Oh ! I assure your ladyship I am not actuated by any motives of that sort , "
202076	202104	202073	202074	Mr. Guppy	301	" and I could n't accept anything of the kind . I wish your ladyship good day , and am much obliged to you all the same . "
202264	202312	202232	202232	her	4981	" O my child , my child ! Not dead in the first hours of her life , as my cruel sister told me , but sternly nurtured by her , after she had renounced me and my name ! O my child , O my child ! "
202367	202375	202379	202379	she	481	" by her son Allan 's desire , "
202389	202400	202379	202379	she	481	" and sent his kind remembrances to all of us , "
202719	202725	202726	202726	she	481	" So , Miss Summerson , "
202735	202783	202726	202726	she	481	" this , you see , is the fortune inherited by my son . Wherever my son goes , he can claim kindred with Ap - Kerrig . He may not have money , but he always has what is much better - family , my dear . "
202827	202838	202812	202812	I	0	" It IS , my dear , a great thing , "
202844	202882	202884	202884	she	481	" It has its disadvantages ; my son 's choice of a wife , for instance , is limited by it , but the matrimonial choice of the royal family is limited in much the same manner . "
202917	202925	202926	202926	she	481	" Poor Mr. Woodcourt , my dear , "
202948	203015	202926	202926	she	481	" was descended from a great Highland family , the MacCoorts of MacCoort . He served his king and country as an officer in the Royal Highlanders , and he died on the field . My son is one of the last representatives of two old families . With the blessing of heaven he will set them up again and unite them with another old family . "
203062	203066	203067	203067	she	481	" My dear , "
203072	203140	203067	203067	she	481	" you have so much sense and you look at the world in a quiet manner so superior to your time of life that it is a comfort to me to talk to you about these family matters of mine . You do n't know much of my son , my dear ; but you know enough of him , I dare say , to recollect him ? "
203141	203150	203053	203054	Mrs. Woodcourt	481	" Yes , ma'am . I recollect him . "
203151	203182	203067	203067	she	481	" Yes , my dear . Now , my dear , I think you are a judge of character , and I should like to have your opinion of him . "
203183	203189	203191	203191	I	0	" Oh , Mrs. Woodcourt , "
203193	203199	203191	203191	I	0	" that is so difficult ! "
203200	203210	203211	203211	she	4998	" Why is it so difficult , my dear ? "
203214	203222	203211	203211	she	4998	" I do n't see it myself . "
203223	203229	203191	203191	I	0	" To give an opinion - "
203230	203244	203245	203245	I	0	" On so slight an acquaintance , my dear . THAT 'S true . "
203306	203312	203314	203315	Mrs. Woodcourt	481	" You do him justice ! "
203321	203362	203314	203315	Mrs. Woodcourt	481	" You define him exactly . Allan is a dear fellow , and in his profession faultless . I say it , though I am his mother . Still , I must confess he is not without faults , love . "

203372	203390	203392	203395	the sharp old lady	5002	" Ah ! But his really are faults that he might correct , and ought to correct , "
203402	203433	203399	203399	her	5002	" I am so much attached to you that I may confide in you , my dear , as a third party wholly disinterested , that he is fickleness itself . "
203470	203479	203480	203482	the old lady	1406	" You are right again , my dear , "
203485	203498	203480	203482	the old lady	1406	" but I do n't refer to his profession , look you . "
203499	203502	203504	203504	I.	0	" Oh ! "
203505	203508	203510	203510	she	1406	" No , "
203512	203594	203510	203510	she	1406	" I refer , my dear , to his social conduct . He is always paying trivial attentions to young ladies , and always has been , ever since he was eighteen . Now , my dear , he has never really cared for any one of them and has never meant in doing this to do any harm or to express anything but politeness and good nature . Still , it 's not right , you know ; is it ? "
203595	203598	203600	203600	I	0	" No , "
203610	203625	203603	203603	she	1406	" And it might lead to mistaken notions , you see , my dear . "
203631	203752	203754	203764	the old lady , who was now all nods and smiles	5005	" Therefore , I have told him many times that he really should be more careful , both in justice to himself and in justice to others . And he has always said , ' Mother , I will be ; but you know me better than anybody else does , and you know I mean no harm - in short , mean nothing . ' All of which is very true , my dear , but is no justification . However , as he is now gone so far away and for an indefinite time , and as he will have good opportunities and introductions , we may consider this past and gone . And you , my dear , "
203766	203775	203754	203764	the old lady , who was now all nods and smiles	5005	" regarding your dear self , my love ? "
203776	203782	203754	203764	the old lady , who was now all nods and smiles	5005	" Me , Mrs. Woodcourt ? "
203783	203834	203835	203835	I	0	" Not to be always selfish , talking of my son , who has gone to seek his fortune and to find a wife - when do you mean to seek YOUR fortune and to find a husband , Miss Summerson ? Hey , look you ! Now you blush ! "
203873	203896	203898	203899	Mrs. Woodcourt	481	" Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to come for you , my love ? "
203901	203911	203913	203913	I.	0	" If you believe you are a good prophet , "
203914	203962	203913	203913	I.	0	" Why , then , it is that you will marry some one very rich and very worthy , much older - five and twenty years , perhaps - than yourself . And you will be an excellent wife , and much beloved , and very happy . "
203963	203970	203972	203972	I.	0	" That is a good fortune , "
203973	203982	203913	203913	I.	0	" But why is it to be mine ? "
203983	203987	203988	203988	she	481	" My dear , "
203991	204045	203988	203988	she	481	" there 's suitability in it - you are so busy , and so neat , and so peculiarly situated altogether that there 's suitability in it , and it will come to pass . And nobody , my love , will congratulate you more sincerely on such a marriage than I shall . "
204574	204580	204584	204584	Caddy	304	" gone through the Gazette , "

204894	204906	204875	204875	his	443	" And your papa , Caddy . What did he say ? "
204907	204913	204915	204915	Caddy	304	" Oh ! Poor Pa , "
204917	205007	204915	204915	Caddy	304	" only cried and said he hoped we might get on better than he and Ma had got on . He did n't say so before Prince , he only said so to me . And he said , ' My poor girl , you have not been very well taught how to make a home for your husband , but unless you mean with all your heart to strive to do it , you had better murder him than marry him - if you really love him . ' "
205008	205018	204875	204875	his	443	" And how did you reassure him , Caddy ? "
205019	205131	204915	204915	Caddy	304	" Why , it was very distressing , you know , to see poor Pa so low and hear him say such terrible things , and I could n't help crying myself . But I told him that I DID mean it with all my heart and that I hoped our house would be a place for him to come and find some comfort in of an evening and that I hoped and thought I could be a better daughter to him there than at home . Then I mentioned Peepy 's coming to stay with me , and then Pa began to cry again and said the children were Indians . "
205132	205137	204915	204915	Caddy	304	" Indians , Caddy ? "
205138	205141	205143	205143	Caddy	304	" Yes , "
205145	205152	205143	205143	Caddy	304	" wild Indians . And Pa said "
205174	205194	205195	205195	Ada	294	" that he was sensible the best thing that could happen to them was their being all tomahawked together . "
205213	205233	205235	205235	Caddy	304	" No , of course I know Pa would n't like his family to be weltering in their blood , "
205237	205279	205235	205235	Caddy	304	" but he means that they are very unfortunate in being Ma 's children and that he is very unfortunate in being Ma 's husband ; and I am sure that 's true , though it seems unnatural to say so . "
205295	205306	205307	205307	she	298	" Oh ! You know what Ma is , Esther , "
205310	205362	205364	205364	Caddy	304	" It 's impossible to say whether she knows it or not . She has been told it often enough ; and when she IS told it , she only gives me a placid look , as if I was I do n't know what - a steeple in the distance , "
205370	205401	205364	205364	Caddy	304	" and then she shakes her head and says ' Oh , Caddy , Caddy , what a tease you are ! ' and goes on with the Borrioboola letters . "
205402	205410	205412	205412	I.	5038	" And about your wardrobe , Caddy ? "
205422	205429	205430	205430	she	298	" Well , my dear Esther , "
205437	205497	205430	205430	she	298	" I must do the best I can and trust to my dear Prince never to have an unkind remembrance of my coming so shabbily to him . If the question concerned an outfit for Borrioboola , Ma would know all about it and would be quite excited . Being what it is , she neither knows nor cares . "

205926	205949	205923	205923	I	0	" Caddy , I am sure you are very welcome to learn anything that you can learn of ME , my dear , "
206504	206510	206512	206512	she	298	" My dear Miss Summerson , "
206525	206571	206512	206512	she	298	" these are really ridiculous preparations , though your assisting them is a proof of your kindness . There is something so inexpressibly absurd to me in the idea of Caddy being married ! Oh , Caddy , you silly , silly , silly puss ! "
206612	206633	206600	206600	she	298	" My good Miss Summerson , at half the cost , this weak child might have been equipped for Africa ! "
206665	206690	206662	206662	she	298	" Will my room be required , my dear Miss Summerson ? For it 's quite impossible that I can put my papers away . "
206716	206724	206726	206727	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" Well , my dear Miss Summerson , "
206729	206792	206726	206727	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" you know best , I dare say . But by obliging me to employ a boy , Caddy has embarrassed me to that extent , overwhelmed as I am with public business , that I do n't know which way to turn . We have a Ramification meeting , too , on Wednesday afternoon , and the inconvenience is very serious . "
206793	206802	206804	206804	I	0	" It is not likely to occur again , "
206808	206818	206804	206804	I	0	" Caddy will be married but once , probably . "
206819	206824	206825	206826	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" That 's true , "
206829	206847	206825	206826	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" that 's true , my dear . I suppose we must make the best of it ! "
207358	207362	207364	207364	Caddy	304	" Poor Pa ! "
207386	207454	207364	207364	Caddy	304	" It seems unkind to leave him , Esther . But what could I do if I stayed ! Since I first knew you , I have tidied and tidied over and over again , but it 's useless . Ma and Africa , together , upset the whole house directly . We never have a servant who do n't drink . Ma 's ruinous to everything . "
207477	207488	207490	207490	Caddy	304	" My heart aches for him ; that it does ! "
207492	207535	207490	207490	Caddy	304	" I ca n't help thinking to - night , Esther , how dearly I hope to be happy with Prince , and how dearly Pa hoped , I dare say , to be happy with Ma . What a disappointed life ! "
207536	207541	207543	207544	Mr. Jellyby	299	" My dear Caddy ! "
207571	207576	207578	207578	Caddy	304	" Yes , Pa ! "
207588	207593	207595	207596	Mr. Jellyby	299	" My dear Caddy , "
207598	207602	207595	207596	Mr. Jellyby	299	" Never have - "
207603	207609	207611	207611	Caddy	304	" Not Prince , Pa ? "

207619	207625	207627	207628	Mr. Jellyby	299	" Yes , my dear , "
207630	207641	207627	207628	Mr. Jellyby	299	" Have him , certainly . But , never have - "
207695	207713	207715	207715	Caddy	304	" What do you wish me not to have ? Do n't have what , dear Pa ? "
207727	207737	207721	207721	her	304	" Never have a mission , my dear child . "
208075	208080	208082	208083	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" My dear sir , "
208085	208164	208082	208083	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" these young people will live with me ; my house is large enough for their accommodation , and they shall not want the shelter of my roof . I could have wished - you will understand the allusion , Mr. Jarndyce , for you remember my illustrious patron the Prince Regent - I could have wished that my son had married into a family where there was more deportment , but the will of heaven be done ! "
208914	208929	208899	208900	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" Oh , you naughty Peepy , what a shocking little pig you are ! "
209191	209207	209209	209209	Caddy	304	" I am very sorry I could n't go on writing from dictation , Ma , "
209211	209219	209209	209209	Caddy	304	" I hope you forgive me now . "
209220	209227	209229	209230	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" Oh , Caddy , Caddy ! "
209232	209256	209229	209230	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" I have told you over and over again that I have engaged a boy , and there 's an end of it . "
209257	209283	209209	209209	Caddy	304	" You are sure you are not the least angry with me , Ma ? Say you are sure before I go away , Ma ? "
209284	209289	209291	209292	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" You foolish Caddy , "
209294	209318	209291	209292	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" do I look angry , or have I inclination to be angry , or time to be angry ? How CAN you ? "
209319	209333	209334	209335	Mrs. Jellyby	298	" Take a little care of Pa while I am gone , Mama ! "
209342	209347	209349	209349	she	298	" You romantic child , "
209357	209381	209349	209349	she	298	" Go along . I am excellent friends with you . Now , good - bye , Caddy , and be very happy ! "
209479	209489	209491	209491	Prince	444	" Thank you over and over again , father ! "
209497	209523	209491	209491	Prince	444	" I am very grateful for all your kindness and consideration regarding our marriage , and so , I can assure you , is Caddy . "

209547	209603	209544	209545	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" and dear daughter , I have done my duty . If the spirit of a sainted wooman hovers above us and looks down on the occasion , that , and your constant affection , will be my recompense . You will not fail in YOUR duty , my son and daughter , I believe ? "
209604	209610	209612	209612	Prince	444	" Dear father , never ! "

209635	209688	209632	209633	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" is as it should be . My children , my home is yours , my heart is yours , my all is yours . I will never leave you ; nothing but death shall part us . My dear son , you contemplate an absence of a week , I think ? "
209689	209704	209544	209545	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" A week , dear father . We shall return home this day week . "
209705	209710	209712	209713	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" My dear child , "
209715	209754	209712	209713	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" let me , even under the present exceptional circumstances , recommend strict punctuality . It is highly important to keep the connexion together ; and schools , if at all neglected , are apt to take offence . "
209755	209772	209544	209545	Mr. Turveydrop	444	" This day week , father , we shall be sure to be home to dinner . "

211846	211893	211894	211894	His	1744	" The lady there . She 's come to get me to go along with her to the berryin ground . I wo n't go to the berryin ground . I do n't like the name on it . She might go a - berryin ME . "
211913	211929	211931	211931	Jenny	366	" He has been talking off and on about such like all day , ma'am , "
211934	211948	211931	211931	Jenny	366	" Why , how you stare ! This is MY lady , Jo . "
211949	211953	211955	211956	the boy	1744	" Is it ? "
211972	212004	211955	211956	the boy	1744	" She looks to me the t'other one . It ai n't the bonnet , nor yet it ai n't the gownd , but she looks to me the t'other one . "
212068	212072	212074	212075	the boy	1744	" I say ! "
212077	212090	212074	212075	the boy	1744	" YOU tell me . Ai n't the lady the t'other lady ? "
212112	212115	212116	212117	the boy	1744	" Oh ! "
212120	212128	212116	212117	the boy	1744	" Then I s'pose she ai n't . "
212129	212142	212144	212144	I.	5235	" I came to see if I could do you any good , "
212145	212153	212144	212144	I.	5235	" What is the matter with you ? "
212154	212162	212164	212165	the boy	1744	" I 'm a - being froze , "
212176	212233	212169	212169	his	1744	" and then burnt up , and then froze , and then burnt up , ever so many times in a hour . And my head 's all sleepy , and all a - going mad - like - and I 'm so dry - and my bones is n't half so much bones as pain . "
212240	212246	212236	212236	he	1744	" I asked the woman . "
212277	212278	212279	212279	Tom	469	" "
212286	212332	212279	212279	Tom	469	" the boy replied . Whenever he fixed his attention or his eyes , it was only for a very little while . He soon began to droop his head again , and roll it heavily , and speak as if he were half awake . "
212340	212344	212335	212335	he	1744	" I asked . "
212351	212362	212363	212363	I	0	" said the boy himself , now flushed and hot . "
212370	212371	212363	212363	I	0	" "
212377	212381	212374	212374	he	1744	" I asked . "
212384	212393	212374	212374	he	1744	" repeated the boy in a louder tone . "
212538	212546	212504	212504	She	372	" He always concluded by addressing Charley . "
212555	212564	212565	212565	He	0	" said I , taking the woman aside . "
212585	212586	212587	212587	I	0	" "
212598	212607	212587	212587	I	0	" she replied , glancing compassionately at him . "
212715	212928	212929	212929	Jenny	366	" The other woman came hurriedly in as she spoke , and the boy got up with a half - obscured sense that he was expected to be going . When the little child awoke , and when and how Charley got at it , took it out of bed , and began to walk about hushing it , I do n't know . There she was , doing all this in a quiet motherly manner as if she were living in Mrs. Blinder 's attic with Tom and Emma again . The friend had been here and there , and had been played about from hand to hand , and had come back as she went . At first it was too early for the boy to be received into the proper refuge , and at last it was too late . One official sent her to another , and the other sent her back again to the first , and so backward and forward , until it appeared to me as if both must have been appointed for their skill in evading their duties instead of performing them . And now , after all , she said , breathing quickly , for she had been running and was frightened too , "
212962	212999	212947	212948	the Lord	11174	" They put a few halfpence together and hurried them into his hand , and so , in an oblivious , half - thankful , half - insensible way , he shuffled out of the house . "
213008	213015	212947	212948	the Lord	11174	" said its mother to Charley , "
213068	213289	213290	213290	I	0	" She hurried off , and presently we passed her hushing and singing to her child at her own door and looking anxiously along the road for her drunken husband . I was afraid of staying then to speak to either woman , lest I should bring her into trouble . But I said to Charley that we must not leave the boy to die . Charley , who knew what to do much better than I did , and whose quickness equalled her presence of mind , glided on before me , and presently we came up with Jo , just short of the brick - kiln . I think he must have begun his journey with some small bundle under his arm and must have had it stolen or lost it . For he still carried his wretched fragment of fur cap like a bundle , though he went bare - headed through the rain , which now fell fast . He stopped when we called to him and again showed a dread of me when I came up , standing with his lustrous eyes fixed upon me , and even arrested in his shivering fit . I asked him to come with us , and we would take care that he had some shelter for the night . "
213297	213301	213290	213290	I	0	" he said ; "
213310	213311	213290	213290	I	0	" "
213322	213326	213315	213315	you	0	" replied Charley . "
213331	213336	213327	213327	They	850	" said the boy . "
213377	213384	213386	213386	she	5271	" Then he hoarsely whispered Charley , "
213406	213653	213386	213386	she	5271	" Charley looked at me a little frightened . I felt half frightened at myself when the boy glared on me so . But he turned and followed when I beckoned to him , and finding that he acknowledged that influence in me , I led the way straight home . It was not far , only at the summit of the hill . We passed but one man . I doubted if we should have got home without assistance , the boy 's steps were so uncertain and tremulous . He made no complaint , however , and was strangely unconcerned about himself , if I may say so strange a thing . Leaving him in the hall for a moment , shrunk into the corner of the window - seat and staring with an indifference that scarcely could be called wonder at the comfort and brightness about him , I went into the drawing - room to speak to my guardian . There I found Mr. Skimpole , who had come down by the coach , as he frequently did without notice , and never bringing any clothes with him , but always borrowing everything he wanted . They came out with me directly to look at the boy . The servants had gathered in the hall too , and he shivered in the window - seat with Charley standing by him , like some wounded animal that had been found in a ditch . "
213660	213679	213386	213386	she	5271	" said my guardian after asking him a question or two and touching him and examining his eyes . "
213687	213688	213682	213682	you	5275	" "
213696	213701	213689	213689	You	5275	" said Mr. Skimpole . "
213707	213715	213704	213704	you	5275	" inquired my guardian , almost sternly . "
213720	213725	213704	213704	you	5275	" said Mr. Skimpole , "
213788	213821	213822	213822	You	288	" Mr. Skimpole had retreated from the hall to the drawing - room again and said this in his airy way , seated on the music - stool as we stood by . "
213829	213839	213822	213822	You	288	" observed Mr. Skimpole , looking gaily at us . "
213933	213934	213920	213920	arithmeticians	5281	" "
213943	213948	213938	213938	he	326	" asked my guardian . "
213953	213966	213938	213938	he	326	" said Mr. Skimpole , shrugging his shoulders with his engaging smile , "
213990	213991	213985	213985	he	326	" "
214001	214020	213985	213985	he	326	" said my guardian , to whom I had hastily explained the unavailing efforts of the two women , "
214028	214038	213985	213985	he	326	" walking up and down and rumpling his hair , "
214075	214076	214077	214077	My	0	" "
214081	214086	214077	214077	My	0	" returned Mr. Skimpole , "
214119	214139	214140	214140	Our	5290	" My guardian stopped and looked at him with a whimsical mixture of amusement and indignation in his face . "
214156	214165	214152	214152	I	0	" said Mr. Skimpole , unabashed and candid . "
214221	214222	214223	214223	I	0	" "
214226	214236	214223	214223	I	0	" returned my guardian , resuming his uneasy walk , "
214249	214250	214252	214252	you	0	" "
214255	214260	214261	214261	I	0	" said Mr. Skimpole . "
214487	214488	214523	214523	her	283	" "
214493	214499	214523	214523	her	283	" I ventured to observe , "
214505	214506	214523	214523	her	283	" "
214511	214517	214523	214523	her	283	" said Mr. Skimpole cheerfully , "
214548	214565	214538	214538	your	1649	" The amiable face with which he said it , I think I shall never forget . "
214572	214581	214569	214570	little woman	1937	" observed my guardian , turning to me , "
214675	214676	214670	214670	We	5308	" "
214679	214698	214670	214670	We	5308	" said Mr. Skimpole , with his hands upon the keys of the piano as we moved away . "
214708	214709	214700	214700	you	5308	" "
214712	214717	214700	214700	you	5308	" said my guardian . "
214727	214735	214736	214736	You	5308	" returned Mr. Skimpole with playful admiration . "
214782	214783	214784	214784	You	5308	" "
214796	214825	214784	214784	You	5308	" said my guardian , looking back over his shoulder half angrily ; only half angrily , for he never seemed to consider Mr. Skimpole an accountable being . "
214916	215034	214910	214910	she	283	" We went back into the hall and explained to Jo what we proposed to do , which Charley explained to him again and which he received with the languid unconcern I had already noticed , wearily looking on at what was done as if it were for somebody else . The servants compassionating his miserable state and being very anxious to help , we soon got the loft - room ready ; and some of the men about the house carried him across the wet yard , well wrapped up . It was pleasant to observe how kind they were to him and how there appeared to be a general impression among them that frequently calling him "
215037	215233	214910	214910	she	283	" was likely to revive his spirits . Charley directed the operations and went to and fro between the loft - room and the house with such little stimulants and comforts as we thought it safe to give him . My guardian himself saw him before he was left for the night and reported to me when he returned to the growlery to write a letter on the boy 's behalf , which a messenger was charged to deliver at day - light in the morning , that he seemed easier and inclined to sleep . They had fastened his door on the outside , he said , in case of his being delirious , but had so arranged that he could not make any noise without being heard . Ada being in our room with a cold , Mr. Skimpole was left alone all this time and entertained himself by playing snatches of pathetic airs and sometimes singing to them as we heard at a distance with great expression and feeling . When we rejoined him in the drawing- room he said he would give us a little ballad which had come into his head "
215240	215250	214910	214910	she	283	" and he sang one about a peasant boy , "
215273	215337	214910	214910	she	283	" quite exquisitely . It was a song that always made him cry , he told us . He was extremely gay all the rest of the evening , for he absolutely chirped - those were his delighted words - when he thought by what a happy talent for business he was surrounded . He gave us , in his glass of negus , "
215345	215586	214910	214910	she	283	" and supposed and gaily pursued the case of his being reserved like Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London . In that event , no doubt , he would establish the Jarndyce Institution and the Summerson Almshouses , and a little annual Corporation Pilgrimage to St. Albans . He had no doubt , he said , that our young friend was an excellent boy in his way , but his way was not the Harold Skimpole way ; what Harold Skimpole was , Harold Skimpole had found himself , to his considerable surprise , when he first made his own acquaintance ; he had accepted himself with all his failings and had thought it sound philosophy to make the best of the bargain ; and he hoped we would do the same . Charley 's last report was that the boy was quiet . I could see , from my window , the lantern they had left him burning quietly ; and I went to bed very happy to think that he was sheltered . There was more movement and more talking than usual a little before daybreak , and it awoke me . As I was dressing , I looked out of my window and asked one of our men who had been among the active sympathizers last night whether there was anything wrong about the house . The lantern was still burning in the loft - window . "
215594	215598	215589	215590	the boy	1744	" said he . "
215603	215607	215610	215610	miss	9656	" I inquired . "
215612	215615	215610	215610	miss	9656	" Dead ! "
215616	215627	214910	214910	she	283	" Dead , miss ? No . Gone clean off . "
216050	216053	216055	216055	I	0	" Charley , "
216057	216063	216055	216055	I	0	" are you so cold ? "
216064	216072	216073	216073	she	5048	" I think I am , miss , "
216076	216115	216118	216118	Ada	294	" I do n't know what it is . I ca n't hold myself still . I felt so yesterday at about this same time , miss . Do n't be uneasy , I think I 'm ill . "
216176	216199	216173	216173	I	0	" Not now , my dearest . Go away . There 's nothing the matter ; I will come to you presently . "
217411	217425	217408	217408	I	0	" You 're getting quite strong , Charley , are you not ? ' "
217430	217434	217408	217408	I	0	" said Charley . "
217448	217449	217446	217446	Charley	534	" "
217458	217500	217456	217456	miss	9656	" cried Charley . But Charley 's face fell in the height of her delight , for she saw the secret in MY face ; and she came out of the great chair , and fell upon my bosom , and said "
217515	217530	217512	217512	my	0	" and a great deal more out of the fullness of her grateful heart . "
217535	217548	217533	217533	Charley	534	" said I after letting her go on for a little while , "
217592	217593	217590	217590	Charley	534	" "
217606	217610	217595	217595	you	9656	" said Charley . "
217635	217659	217632	217633	my dear	9610	" - how affectionately and devotedly she poured this out as she clung to my neck , I never can remember without tears - "
217665	217682	217632	217633	my dear	9610	" So I let Charley cry a little longer , and it did us both good . "
217694	217699	217689	217689	you	9656	" said Charley quietly . "
217708	217709	217689	217689	you	9656	" "
217744	217757	217737	217737	you	5394	" For that the poor child thanked me with her whole heart . "
217832	217966	217824	217824	Charley	534	" Charley promised , and I lay down , for I was very heavy . I saw the doctor that night and asked the favour of him that I wished to ask relative to his saying nothing of my illness in the house as yet . I have a very indistinct remembrance of that night melting into day , and of day melting into night again ; but I was just able on the first morning to get to the window and speak to my darling . On the second morning I heard her dear voice - Oh , how dear now ! - outside ; and I asked Charley , with some difficulty speech being painful to me , to go and say I was asleep . I heard her answer softly , "
217978	217979	217972	217972	Charley	534	" "
217989	217993	217987	217987	Charley	534	" I inquired . "
217998	218007	217996	217996	miss	9656	" said Charley , peeping through the curtain . "
218018	218019	218020	218020	She	5398	" "
218026	218032	218024	218024	miss	9656	" answered Charley , peeping . "
218040	218070	218024	218024	miss	9656	" With her blue clear eyes , God bless them , always loveliest when raised like that ! I called Charley to me and gave her her last charge . "
218136	218137	218138	218138	I	0	" "
218146	218151	218152	218152	I	0	" she promised me . "
218192	218536	218186	218186	Charley	534	" CHAPTER XXXII The Appointed Time It is night in Lincoln 's Inn - perplexed and troublous valley of the shadow of the law , where suitors generally find but little day - and fat candles are snuffed out in offices , and clerks have rattled down the crazy wooden stairs and dispersed . The bell that rings at nine o'clock has ceased its doleful clangour about nothing ; the gates are shut ; and the night - porter , a solemn warder with a mighty power of sleep , keeps guard in his lodge . From tiers of staircase windows clogged lamps like the eyes of Equity , bleared Argus with a fathomless pocket for every eye and an eye upon it , dimly blink at the stars . In dirty upper casements , here and there , hazy little patches of candlelight reveal where some wise draughtsman and conveyancer yet toils for the entanglement of real estate in meshes of sheep - skin , in the average ratio of about a dozen of sheep to an acre of land . Over which bee - like industry these benefactors of their species linger yet , though office - hours be past , that they may give , for every day , some good account at last . In the neighbouring court , where the Lord Chancellor of the rag and bottle shop dwells , there is a general tendency towards beer and supper . Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins , whose respective sons , engaged with a circle of acquaintance in the game of hide and seek , have been lying in ambush about the by - ways of Chancery Lane for some hours and scouring the plain of the same thoroughfare to the confusion of passengers - Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins have but now exchanged congratulations on the children being abed , and they still linger on a door - step over a few parting words . Mr. Krook and his lodger , and the fact of Mr. Krook 's being "
218541	218636	218186	218186	Charley	534	" and the testamentary prospects of the young man are , as usual , the staple of their conversation . But they have something to say , likewise , of the Harmonic Meeting at the Sol 's Arms , where the sound of the piano through the partly opened windows jingles out into the court , and where Little Swills , after keeping the lovers of harmony in a roar like a very Yorick , may now be heard taking the gruff line in a concerted piece and sentimentally adjuring his friends and patrons to "
218650	218738	218743	218743	myself	0	" Mrs. Perkins and Mrs. Piper compare opinions on the subject of the young lady of professional celebrity who assists at the Harmonic Meetings and who has a space to herself in the manuscript announcement in the window , Mrs. Perkins possessing information that she has been married a year and a half , though announced as Miss M. Melvilleson , the noted siren , and that her baby is clandestinely conveyed to the Sol 's Arms every night to receive its natural nourishment during the entertainments . "
218745	218750	218743	218743	myself	0	" says Mrs. Perkins , "
218760	219277	219280	219281	Mr. Weevle	504	" Mrs. Piper , as in duty bound , is of the same opinion , holding that a private station is better than public applause , and thanking heaven for her own and , by implication , Mrs. Perkins ' respectability . By this time the pot - boy of the Sol 's Arms appearing with her supper - pint well frothed , Mrs. Piper accepts that tankard and retires indoors , first giving a fair good night to Mrs. Perkins , who has had her own pint in her hand ever since it was fetched from the same hostelry by young Perkins before he was sent to bed . Now there is a sound of putting up shop- shutters in the court and a smell as of the smoking of pipes ; and shooting stars are seen in upper windows , further indicating retirement to rest . Now , too , the policeman begins to push at doors ; to try fastenings ; to be suspicious of bundles ; and to administer his beat , on the hypothesis that every one is either robbing or being robbed . It is a close night , though the damp cold is searching too , and there is a laggard mist a little way up in the air . It is a fine steaming night to turn the slaughter - houses , the unwholesome trades , the sewerage , bad water , and burial - grounds to account , and give the registrar of deaths some extra business . It may be something in the air - there is plenty in it - or it may be something in himself that is in fault ; but Mr. Weevle , otherwise Jobling , is very ill at ease . He comes and goes between his own room and the open street door twenty times an hour . He has been doing so ever since it fell dark . Since the Chancellor shut up his shop , which he did very early to - night , Mr. Weevle has been down and up , and down and up with a cheap tight velvet skull - cap on his head , making his whiskers look out of all proportion , oftener than before . It is no phenomenon that Mr. Snagsby should be ill at ease too , for he always is so , more or less , under the oppressive influence of the secret that is upon him . Impelled by the mystery of which he is a partaker and yet in which he is not a sharer , Mr. Snagsby haunts what seems to be its fountain - head - the rag and bottle shop in the court . It has an irresistible attraction for him . Even now , coming round by the Sol 's Arms with the intention of passing down the court , and out at the Chancery Lane end , and so terminating his unpremeditated after - supper stroll of ten minutes ' long from his own door and back again , Mr. Snagsby approaches . "
219283	219292	219280	219281	Mr. Weevle	504	" says the stationer , stopping to speak . "
219297	219298	219294	219294	YOU	504	" "
219301	219305	219294	219294	YOU	504	" says Weevle , "
219313	219314	219307	219307	I	0	" "
219329	219334	219316	219316	yourself	504	" the stationer inquires . "
219357	219368	219372	219372	sir	9569	" Weevle answers , glancing up and down the court . "
219379	219394	219376	219376	you	9569	" says Mr. Snagsby , pausing to sniff and taste the air a little , "
219426	219427	219424	219424	sir	9569	" "
219449	219454	219455	219455	I	0	" Mr. Weevle rejoins . "
219466	219467	219471	219471	you	9569	" "
219480	219488	219471	219471	you	9569	" Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again . "
219526	219542	219522	219522	I	0	" - Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again and then spits and wipes his mouth - "
219570	219571	219543	219543	I	0	" "
219585	219586	219522	219522	I	0	" "
219595	219600	219602	219602	I	0	" says Mr. Snagsby , "
219610	219611	219602	219602	I	0	" "
219623	219628	219615	219615	I	0	" returns Mr. Weevle . "
219655	219684	219634	219634	you	9569	" says Mr. Snagsby , looking in past the other 's shoulder along the dark passage and then falling back a step to look up at the house . "
219757	219758	219759	219759	I	0	" "
219766	219770	219759	219759	I	0	" returns Tony . "
219779	219794	219807	219807	he	251	" pursues Mr. Snagsby , coughing his cough of mild persuasion behind his hand . "
219814	219815	219818	219818	he	251	" "
219821	219825	219816	219816	I	0	" says Tony . "
219831	219832	219827	219827	I	0	" "
219845	219850	219841	219841	you	9569	" returns the stationer . "
219879	219888	219890	219890	I	0	" adds Mr. Snagsby with his apologetic cough , "
219905	219953	219890	219890	I	0	" Mr. Weevle again glances up and down the court and then looks at the stationer . Mr. Snagsby , blankly catching his eye , looks upward for a star or so and coughs a cough expressive of not exactly seeing his way out of this conversation . "
219962	219971	219890	219890	I	0	" he observes , slowly rubbing his hands , "
219978	219979	219982	219982	he	5423	" "
219984	219989	219982	219982	he	5423	" interrupts Mr. Weevle . "
219996	220018	219990	219991	The deceased	10780	" says Mr. Snagsby , twitching his head and right eyebrow towards the staircase and tapping his acquaintance on the button . "
220025	220041	220042	220042	I	0	" returns the other as if he were not over - fond of the subject . "
220050	220051	220042	220042	I	0	" "
220114	220138	220140	220140	I	0	" says Mr. Snagsby , breaking off with a mistrust that he may have unpolitely asserted a kind of proprietorship in Mr. Weevle , "
220163	220178	220161	220161	sir	9569	" adds Mr. Snagsby with a misgiving that he has not improved the matter . "
220189	220202	220186	220186	you	9569	" answers Weevle , once more glancing up and down the court . "
220213	220218	220186	220186	you	9569	" suggests the stationer . "
220222	220223	220186	220186	you	9569	" "
220227	220236	220186	220186	you	9569	" observes the stationer with his confirmatory cough . "
220261	220293	220294	220296	my little woman	2216	" - Mr. Snagsby speaks as if it made him desolate to go , though he has been casting about for any means of escape ever since he stopped to speak - "
220309	220384	220307	220307	sir	9569	" If Mr. Snagsby hastens home to save his little woman the trouble of looking for him , he might set his mind at rest on that score . His little woman has had her eye upon him round the Sol 's Arms all this time and now glides after him with a pocket handkerchief wrapped over her head , honouring Mr. Weevle and his doorway with a searching glance as she goes past . "
220397	220404	220385	220385	You	5438	" says Mr. Weevle to himself ; "
220434	220496	220429	220430	this fellow	2057	" This fellow approaches as he speaks . Mr. Weevle softly holds up his finger , and draws him into the passage , and closes the street door . Then they go upstairs , Mr. Weevle heavily , and Mr. Guppy for it is he very lightly indeed . When they are shut into the back room , they speak low . "
220511	220515	220497	220497	I	0	" says Tony . "
220523	220524	220518	220518	I	0	" "
220530	220534	220525	220525	You	0	" Tony repeats . "
220572	220573	220562	220562	I	0	" "
220580	220581	220562	220562	I	0	" "
220586	220590	220562	220562	I	0	" says Tony . "
220631	220656	220688	220688	you	0	" says Tony , pointing to the heavily burning taper on his table with a great cabbage head and a long winding - sheet . "
220662	220674	220688	220688	you	0	" Mr. Guppy observes as he takes the snuffers in hand . "
220678	220683	220688	220688	you	0	" returns his friend . "
220703	220704	220688	220688	you	0	" "
220716	220740	220714	220714	Tony	504	" inquires Mr. Guppy , looking at him , snuffers in hand , as he sits down with his elbow on the table . "
220744	220749	220741	220742	William Guppy	301	" replies the other , "
220773	220833	220770	220770	I	0	" Mr. Weevle moodily pushes the snuffers - tray from him with his elbow , leans his head on his hand , puts his feet on the fender , and looks at the fire . Mr. Guppy , observing him , slightly tosses his head and sits down on the other side of the table in an easy attitude . "
220844	220845	220849	220849	he	370	" "
220857	220869	220849	220849	he	370	" said Mr. Weevle , altering the construction of his sentence . "
220873	220874	220849	220849	he	370	" "
220890	220891	220880	220880	He	370	" "
220898	220903	220896	220896	Snagsby	370	" says Mr. Guppy , "
220924	220925	220917	220917	I	0	" "
220934	220944	220931	220932	William G.	575	" cried Tony , looking up for an instant . "
220971	221077	220917	220917	I	0	" Mr. Guppy affects to smile , and with the view of changing the conversation , looks with an admiration , real or pretended , round the room at the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty , terminating his survey with the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantelshelf , in which she is represented on a terrace , with a pedestal upon the terrace , and a vase upon the pedestal , and her shawl upon the vase , and a prodigious piece of fur upon the shawl , and her arm on the prodigious piece of fur , and a bracelet on her arm . "
221085	221090	220917	220917	I	0	" says Mr. Guppy . "
221097	221098	221099	221099	I	0	" "
221104	221113	221099	221099	I	0	" growls Tony , without changing his position . "
221125	221159	221160	221160	Tony	504	" Finding by this time that his friend is not to be wheedled into a more sociable humour , Mr. Guppy puts about upon the ill - used tack and remonstrates with him . "
221162	221166	221160	221160	Tony	504	" says he , "
221261	221262	221245	221245	I	0	" "
221271	221276	221268	221269	William Guppy	301	" returns Mr. Weevle . "
221283	221289	221277	221277	Sir	9569	" retorts Mr. William Guppy , "
221299	221343	221291	221291	I	0	" Mr. Weevle admits that he has been wrong and begs Mr. William Guppy to think no more about it . Mr. William Guppy , however , having got the advantage , can not quite release it without a little more injured remonstrance . "
221351	221356	221357	221357	you	504	" says that gentleman , "
221489	221505	221506	221507	William Guppy	301	" Tony again entreats that the subject may be no longer pursued , saying emphatically , "
221512	221521	221506	221507	William Guppy	301	" Mr. Guppy acquiesces , with the reply , "
221537	221538	221530	221530	Tony	504	" "
221542	221550	221530	221530	Tony	504	" says Tony , stirring the fire , "
221581	221582	221565	221565	Krook	251	" "
221592	221593	221587	221587	he	301	" "
221644	221645	221636	221636	He	301	" "
221656	221657	221646	221646	He	301	" "
221800	221801	221785	221785	He	301	" "
221811	221812	221803	221803	you	0	" "
221832	221833	221834	221834	Tony	504	" "
221836	221849	221850	221850	he	301	" says Mr. Guppy after considering a little with his legs crossed , "
221859	221860	221857	221857	he	301	" "
221922	221923	221924	221924	Tony	504	" "
221926	221937	221924	221924	Tony	504	" says Mr. Guppy , uncrossing and recrossing his legs , "
221950	221951	221942	221942	he	301	" "
222003	222004	222005	222005	Tony	504	" "
222007	222036	222005	222005	Tony	504	" says Mr. Guppy , uncrossing and recrossing his legs again , ' should you say that the original was a man 's writing or a woman 's ? "
222037	222068	222069	222070	Mr. Guppy	301	" A woman 's . Fifty to one a lady 's - slopes a good deal , and the end of the letter ' n , ' long and hasty . "
222125	222150	222118	222118	He	301	" Why , Tony , what on earth is going on in this house to - night ? Is there a chimney on fire ? "
222151	222156	222103	222103	he	301	" Chimney on fire ! "
222157	222160	222162	222163	Mr. Guppy	301	" Ah ! "
222165	222203	222162	222163	Mr. Guppy	301	" See how the soot 's falling . See here , on my arm ! See again , on the table here ! Confound the stuff , it wo n't blow off - smears like black fat ! "
222262	222268	222270	222271	Mr. Guppy	301	" And it was then , "
222308	222327	222302	222302	their	5463	" that he told you of his having taken the bundle of letters from his lodger 's portmanteau ? "
222328	222336	222338	222338	Tony	504	" That was the time , sir , "
222345	222383	222338	222338	Tony	504	" Whereupon I wrote a line to my dear boy , the Honourable William Guppy , informing him of the appointment for to - night and advising him not to call before , Boguey being a slyboots . "
222434	222474	222476	222477	Mr. Guppy	301	" You are to bring the letters to your room to read and compare , and to get yourself into a position to tell him all about them . That 's the arrangement , is n't it , Tony ? "
222486	222504	222476	222477	Mr. Guppy	301	" You ca n't speak too low . Yes . That 's what he and I agreed . "
222505	222513	222531	222531	his	301	" I tell you what , Tony - "
222514	222522	222524	222524	Tony	504	" You ca n't speak too low , "
222546	222592	222531	222531	his	301	" I tell you what . The first thing to be done is to make another packet like the real one so that if he should ask to see the real one while it 's in my possession , you can show him the dummy . "
222593	222625	222627	222627	Tony	504	" And suppose he detects the dummy as soon as he sees it , which with his biting screw of an eye is about five hundred times more likely than not , "
222629	222686	222627	222627	Tony	504	" Then we 'll face it out . They do n't belong to him , and they never did . You found that , and you placed them in my hands - a legal friend of yours - for security . If he forces us to it , they 'll be producible , wo n't they ? "
222687	222692	222694	222695	Mr. Weevle	504	" Ye - es , "
222700	222705	222707	222708	his friend	10220	" Why , Tony , "
222710	222729	222707	222708	his friend	10220	" how you look ! You do n't doubt William Guppy ? You do n't suspect any harm ? "
222730	222743	222745	222747	the other gravely	5469	" I do n't suspect anything more than I know , William , "
222749	222756	222758	222759	Mr. Guppy	301	" And what do you know ? "
222777	222789	222790	222790	he	301	" I tell you , you ca n't speak too low , "
222808	222814	222790	222790	he	301	" What do you know ? "
222815	222838	222762	222762	his	301	" I know three things . First , I know that here we are whispering in secrecy , a pair of conspirators . "
222839	222842	222844	222845	Mr. Guppy	301	" Well ! "
222847	222887	222844	222845	Mr. Guppy	301	" And we had better be that than a pair of noodles , which we should be if we were doing anything else , for it 's the only way of doing what we want to do . Secondly ? "
222888	222909	222910	222911	Mr. Guppy	301	" Secondly , it 's not made out to me how it 's likely to be profitable , after all . "
222928	222984	222914	222914	his	301	" Tony , you are asked to leave that to the honour of your friend . Besides its being calculated to serve that friend in those chords of the human mind which - which need not be called into agonizing vibration on the present occasion - your friend is no fool . What 's that ? "
222985	223012	222844	222845	Mr. Guppy	301	" It 's eleven o'clock striking by the bell of Saint Paul 's . Listen and you 'll hear all the bells in the city jangling . "
223152	223157	223159	223160	Mr. Guppy	301	" Yes , Tony ? "
223175	223184	223159	223160	Mr. Guppy	301	" You were going to say , thirdly ? "
223185	223216	223263	223264	Mr. Guppy	301	" It 's far from a pleasant thing to be plotting about a dead man in the room where he died , especially when you happen to live in it . "
223217	223228	223159	223160	Mr. Guppy	301	" But we are plotting nothing against him , Tony . "
223229	223252	223159	223160	Mr. Guppy	301	" May be not , still I do n't like it . Live here by yourself and see how YOU like it . "
223253	223261	223263	223264	Mr. Guppy	301	" As to dead men , Tony , "
223270	223280	223263	223264	Mr. Guppy	301	" there have been dead men in most rooms . "
223281	223304	223305	223305	Tony	504	" I know there have , but in most rooms you let them alone , and - and they let you alone , "
223368	223381	223383	223383	he	301	" Fah ! Here 's more of this hateful soot hanging about , "
223385	223405	223406	223406	He	301	" Let us open the window a bit and get a mouthful of air . It 's too close . "
223508	223521	223498	223498	his	301	" By the by , Tony , do n't forget old Smallweed , "
223529	223557	223498	223498	his	301	" I have not let him into this , you know . That grandfather of his is too keen by half . It runs in the family . "
223558	223562	223564	223564	Tony	504	" I remember , "
223566	223574	223564	223564	Tony	504	" I am up to all that . "
223575	223581	223583	223584	Mr. Guppy	301	" And as to Krook , "
223586	223618	223583	223584	Mr. Guppy	301	" Now , do you suppose he really has got hold of any other papers of importance , as he has boasted to you , since you have been such allies ? "
223624	223766	223621	223621	his	504	" I do n't know . Ca n't Imagine . If we get through this business without rousing his suspicions , I shall be better informed , no doubt . How can I know without seeing them , when he do n't know himself ? He is always spelling out words from them , and chalking them over the table and the shop - wall , and asking what this is and what that is ; but his whole stock from beginning to end may easily be the waste - paper he bought it as , for anything I can say . It 's a monomania with him to think he is possessed of documents . He has been going to learn to read them this last quarter of a century , I should judge , from what he tells me . "
223767	223784	223785	223786	Mr. Guppy	301	" How did he first come by that idea , though ? That 's the question , "
223799	223841	223785	223786	Mr. Guppy	301	" He may have found papers in something he bought , where papers were not supposed to be , and may have got it into his shrewd head from the manner and place of their concealment that they are worth something . "
223842	223892	223894	223895	Mr. Weevle	504	" Or he may have been taken in , in some pretended bargain . Or he may have been muddled altogether by long staring at whatever he HAS got , and by drink , and by hanging about the Lord Chancellor 's Court and hearing of documents for ever , "
223943	223952	223953	223953	he	301	" What , in the devil 's name , "
223956	223965	223953	223953	he	301	" is this ! Look at my fingers ! "
224006	224023	224046	224047	the lodger	9931	" What have you been doing here ? What have you been pouring out of window ? "
224024	224044	224046	224047	the lodger	9931	" I pouring out of window ! Nothing , I swear ! Never , since I have been here ! "
224093	224100	224102	224103	Mr. Guppy	301	" This is a horrible house , "
224110	224123	224102	224103	Mr. Guppy	301	" Give me some water or I shall cut my hand off . "
224199	224212	224195	224196	the lodger	9931	" It 's the appointed time at last . Shall I go ? "
224220	224223	224213	224214	Mr. Guppy	301	" lucky touch "
224280	224286	224275	224275	Tony	504	" Have you got them ? "
224287	224300	224301	224301	He	301	" Got them ! No . The old man 's not there . "
224328	224334	224275	224275	Tony	504	" What 's the matter ? "
224335	224378	224379	224379	Tony	504	" I could n't make him hear , and I softly opened the door and looked in . And the burning smell is there - and the soot is there , and the oil is there - and he is not there ! "
224508	224511	224513	224514	the lodger	9931	" Look ! "
224529	224611	224513	224514	the lodger	9931	" I told you so . When I saw him last , he took his cap off , took out the little bundle of old letters , hung his cap on the back of the chair - his coat was there already , for he had pulled that off before he went to put the shutters up - and I left him turning the letters over in his hand , standing just where that crumbled black thing is upon the floor . "
224623	224626	224628	224628	Tony	504	" See ! "
224630	224689	224628	224628	Tony	504	" At the foot of the same chair there lies a dirty bit of thin red cord that they tie up pens with . That went round the letters . He undid it slowly , leering and laughing at me , before he began to turn them over , and threw it there . I saw it fall . "
224690	224699	224701	224702	Mr. Guppy	301	" What 's the matter with the cat ? "
224704	224709	224701	224702	Mr. Guppy	301	" Look at her ! "
224710	224724	224725	224725	They	5489	" Mad , I think . And no wonder in this evil place . "
225715	225724	225701	225701	he	5543	" There 'll be a run upon us ! "
225864	225871	225873	225874	Mr. Bogsby	582	" This is not a time , "
225876	225882	225884	225884	he	582	" to haggle about money , "
225895	225916	225884	225884	he	582	" give your orders , you two gentlemen , and you 're welcome to whatever you put a name to . "
226250	226256	226258	226259	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Good gracious , gentlemen ! "
226264	226271	226258	226259	Mr. Snagsby	370	" What 's this I hear ! "
226272	226279	226281	226284	one of the policemen	5569	" Why , it 's true , "
226286	226300	226281	226284	one of the policemen	5569	" That 's what it is . Now move on here , come ! "
226301	226309	226311	226312	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Why , good gracious , gentlemen , "
226319	226342	226311	226312	Mr. Snagsby	370	" I was at this door last night betwixt ten and eleven o'clock in conversation with the young man who lodges here . "
226343	226346	226348	226349	the policeman	10822	" Indeed ? "
226351	226371	226348	226349	the policeman	10822	" You will find the young man next door then . Now move on here , some of you , "
226372	226379	226381	226382	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Not hurt , I hope ? "
226384	226395	226381	226382	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Hurt ? No . What 's to hurt him ! "
226442	226448	226420	226421	Mr. Weevle	504	" And Mr. Guppy likewise ! "
226453	226473	226450	226451	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Dear , dear , dear ! What a fate there seems in all this ! And my lit - "
226488	226493	226474	226475	Mr. Snagsby	370	" my little woman . "
226535	226539	226541	226542	Mr. Snagsby	370	" My dear , "
226549	226572	226541	226542	Mr. Snagsby	370	" will you take anything ? A little - not to put too fine a point upon it - drop of shrub ? "
226573	226576	226578	226579	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" No , "
226581	226591	226578	226579	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" My love , you know these two gentlemen ? "
226592	226595	226597	226598	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" Yes ! "
226643	226664	226627	226627	He	370	" My little woman , why do you look at me in that way ? Pray do n't do it . "
226665	226673	226675	226676	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" I ca n't help my looks , "
226678	226687	226675	226676	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" and if I could I would n't . "
226699	226708	226692	226692	his	370	" Would n't you really , my dear ? "
226721	226731	226675	226676	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" This is a dreadful mystery , my love ! "
226741	226745	226747	226748	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" It IS , "
226754	226759	226751	226751	her	372	" a dreadful mystery . "
226760	226765	226767	226768	Mr. Snagsby	370	" My little woman , "
226774	226827	226767	226768	Mr. Snagsby	370	" do n't for goodness ' sake speak to me with that bitter expression and look at me in that searching way ! I beg and entreat of you not to do it . Good Lord , you do n't suppose that I would go spontaneously combusting any person , my dear ? "
226828	226834	226836	226837	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" I ca n't say , "
226850	226854	226767	226768	Mr. Snagsby	370	" ca n't say "
226927	226931	226933	226935	the unhappy stationer	5575	" My life , "
226937	226967	226933	226935	the unhappy stationer	5575	" would you have any objections to mention why , being in general so delicately circumspect in your conduct , you come into a wine - vaults before breakfast ? "
226968	226975	226977	226978	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" Why do YOU come here ? "
226980	227006	226977	226978	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" My dear , merely to know the rights of the fatal accident which has happened to the venerable party who has been - combusted . "
227018	227036	227007	227008	Mr. Snagsby	370	" I should then have related them to you , my love , over your French roll . "
227037	227053	226977	226978	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" I dare say you would ! You relate everything to me , Mr. Snagsby . "
227054	227060	226977	226978	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" Every - my lit - "
227061	227067	227069	227070	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" I should be glad , "
227083	227107	227069	227070	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" if you would come home with me ; I think you may be safer there , Mr. Snagsby , than anywhere else . "
227108	227132	227133	227134	Mr. Snagsby	370	" My love , I do n't know but what I may be , I am sure . I am ready to go . "
227291	227305	227307	227308	Mr. Guppy	301	" There can be no more favourable time than the present , Tony , "
227322	227348	227307	227308	Mr. Guppy	301	" for a word or two between us upon a point on which we must , with very little delay , come to an understanding . "
227349	227360	227362	227363	the other	10506	" Now , I tell you what , William G. ! "
227373	227423	227362	227363	the other	10506	" If it 's a point of conspiracy , you need n't take the trouble to mention it . I have had enough of that , and I ai n't going to have any more . We shall have YOU taking fire next or blowing up with a bang . "
227446	227479	227439	227439	he	301	" Tony , I should have thought that what we went through last night would have been a lesson to you never to be personal any more as long as you lived . "
227486	227512	227482	227483	Mr. Weevle	504	" William , I should have thought it would have been a lesson to YOU never to conspire any more as long as you lived . "
227519	227524	227515	227516	Mr. Guppy	301	" Who 's conspiring ? "
227531	227537	227527	227528	Mr. Jobling	492	" Why , YOU are ! "
227544	227551	227540	227541	Mr. Guppy	301	" No , I am not . "
227559	227565	227554	227555	Mr. Jobling	492	" Yes , you are ! "
227572	227577	227568	227569	Mr. Guppy	301	" Who says so ? "
227584	227589	227580	227581	Mr. Jobling	492	" I say so ! "
227596	227601	227592	227593	Mr. Guppy	301	" Oh , indeed ? "
227608	227613	227604	227605	Mr. Jobling	492	" Yes , indeed ! "
227635	227638	227640	227641	Mr. Guppy	301	" Tony , "
227644	227690	227640	227641	Mr. Guppy	301	" if you heard your friend out instead of flying at him , you would n't fall into mistakes . But your temper is hasty and you are not considerate . Possessing in yourself , Tony , all that is calculated to charm the eye - "
227691	227698	227700	227701	Mr. Weevle	504	" Oh ! Blow the eye ! "
227707	227716	227700	227701	Mr. Weevle	504	" Say what you have got to say ! "
227747	227834	227744	227744	he	301	" Tony , when I say there is a point on which we must come to an understanding pretty soon , I say so quite apart from any kind of conspiring , however innocent . You know it is professionally arranged beforehand in all cases that are tried what facts the witnesses are to prove . Is it or is it not desirable that we should know what facts we are to prove on the inquiry into the death of this unfortunate old mo - gentleman ? "
227841	227844	227835	227836	Mr. Guppy	301	" mogul , "
227847	227849	227744	227744	he	301	" gentleman "
227856	227863	227744	227744	he	301	" What facts ? THE facts . "
227864	227874	227876	227877	Mr. Guppy	301	" The facts bearing on that inquiry . Those are "
227885	227917	227744	227744	he	301	" what we knew of his habits , when you saw him last , what his condition was then , the discovery that we made , and how we made it . "
227918	227921	227923	227924	Mr. Weevle	504	" Yes , "
227926	227933	227923	227924	Mr. Weevle	504	" Those are about the facts . "
227934	228031	227744	227744	he	301	" We made the discovery in consequence of his having , in his eccentric way , an appointment with you at twelve o'clock at night , when you were to explain some writing to him as you had often done before on account of his not being able to read . I , spending the evening with you , was called down - and so forth . The inquiry being only into the circumstances touching the death of the deceased , it 's not necessary to go beyond these facts , I suppose you 'll agree ? "
228032	228035	228037	228038	Mr. Weevle	504	" No ! "
228040	228045	228037	228038	Mr. Weevle	504	" I suppose not . "
228046	228056	228058	228060	the injured Guppy	301	" And this is not a conspiracy , perhaps ? "
228062	228065	228058	228060	the injured Guppy	301	" No , "
228070	228084	228058	228060	the injured Guppy	301	" if it 's nothing worse than this , I withdraw the observation . "
228085	228090	228092	228093	Mr. Guppy	301	" Now , Tony , "
228105	228135	228092	228093	Mr. Guppy	301	" I should like to know , in a friendly way , whether you have yet thought over the many advantages of your continuing to live at that place ? "
228136	228142	228144	228144	Tony	504	" What do you mean ? "
228148	228167	228169	228170	Mr. Guppy	301	" Whether you have yet thought over the many advantages of your continuing to live at that place ? "
228177	228185	228169	228170	Mr. Guppy	301	" At what place ? THAT place ? "
228201	228220	228222	228223	Mr. Weevle	504	" Why , I would n't pass another night there for any consideration that you could offer me , "
228228	228237	228222	228223	Mr. Weevle	504	" Do you mean it though , Tony ? "
228238	228262	228264	228265	Mr. Weevle	504	" Mean it ! Do I look as if I mean it ? I feel as if I do ; I know that , "
228272	228350	228352	228353	Mr. Guppy	301	" Then the possibility or probability - for such it must be considered - of your never being disturbed in possession of those effects lately belonging to a lone old man who seemed to have no relation in the world , and the certainty of your being able to find out what he really had got stored up there , do n't weigh with you at all against last night , Tony , if I understand you ? "
228364	228380	228382	228383	Mr. Weevle	504	" Certainly not . Talk in that cool way of a fellow 's living there ? "
228386	228393	228382	228383	Mr. Weevle	504	" Go and live there yourself . "
228394	228401	228403	228404	Mr. Guppy	301	" Oh ! I , Tony ! "
228409	228430	228403	228404	Mr. Guppy	301	" I have never lived there and could n't get a lodging there now , whereas you have got one . "
228431	228438	228440	228440	his	301	" You are welcome to it , "
228443	228458	228440	228440	his	301	" and - ugh ! - you may make yourself at home in it . "
228459	228469	228471	228472	Mr. Guppy	301	" Then you really and truly at this point , "
228474	228488	228471	228472	Mr. Guppy	301	" give up the whole thing , if I understand you , Tony ? "
228489	228493	228495	228495	Tony	504	" You never , "
228515	228631	228512	228512	I	0	" While they are so conversing , a hackney - coach drives into the square , on the box of which vehicle a very tall hat makes itself manifest to the public . Inside the coach , and consequently not so manifest to the multitude , though sufficiently so to the two friends , for the coach stops almost at their feet , are the venerable Mr. Smallweed and Mrs. Smallweed , accompanied by their granddaughter Judy . An air of haste and excitement pervades the party , and as the tall hat surmounting Mr. Smallweed the younger alights , Mr. Smallweed the elder pokes his head out of window and bawls to Mr. Guppy , "
228642	228643	228512	228512	I	0	" "
228662	228672	228673	228673	My	0	" says Mr. Guppy , nodding to his familiar . "
228677	228682	228684	228684	you	13669	" cries Grandfather Smallweed , "
228734	228745	228723	228723	you	13669	" Mr. Guppy looks at his friend , repeating inquiringly , "
228753	228768	228723	228723	you	13669	" And they prepare to bear the venerable burden to the Sol 's Arms . "
228774	228793	228723	228723	you	13669	" says the patriarch to the coachman with a fierce grin and shaking his incapable fist at him . "
228859	228934	228937	228937	Lord	5605	" It is well that the Sol is not far off , for Mr. Weevle presents an apoplectic appearance before half the distance is accomplished . With no worse aggravation of his symptoms , however , than the utterance of divers croaking sounds expressive of obstructed respiration , he fulils his share of the porterage and the benevolent old gentleman is deposited by his own desire in the parlour of the Sol 's Arms . "
228939	228956	228937	228937	Lord	5605	" gasps Mr. Smallweed , looking about him , breathless , from an arm - chair . "
228994	229027	229033	229033	herself	5606	" This little apostrophe to Mrs. Smallweed is occasioned by a propensity on the part of that unlucky old lady whenever she finds herself on her feet to amble about and ' set "
229128	229135	229155	229156	Mr. Guppy	301	" a pig - headed jackdaw , "
229143	229148	229149	229150	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" My dear sir , "
229158	229176	229149	229150	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" there has been a calamity here . Have you heard of it , either of you ? "
229177	229190	229149	229150	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Heard of it , sir ! Why , we discovered it . "
229191	229207	229208	229210	The two discoverers	5611	" You discovered it . You two discovered it ! Bart , THEY discovered it ! "
229221	229226	229228	229229	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" My dear friends , "
229237	229259	229228	229229	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" I owe you a thousand thanks for discharging the melancholy office of discovering the ashes of Mrs. Smallweed 's brother . "
229260	229263	229265	229266	Mr. Guppy	301	" Eh ? "
229268	229365	229367	229368	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Mrs. Smallweed 's brother , my dear friend - her only relation . We were not on terms , which is to be deplored now , but he never WOULD be on terms . He was not fond of us . He was eccentric - he was very eccentric . Unless he has left a will which is not at all likely I shall take out letters of administration . I have come down to look after the property ; it must be sealed up , it must be protected . I have come down , "
229383	229390	229377	229377	his	509	" to look after the property . "
229391	229397	229399	229402	the disconsolate Mr. Guppy	301	" I think , Small , "
229404	229417	229399	229402	the disconsolate Mr. Guppy	301	" you might have mentioned that the old man was your uncle . "
229418	229438	229377	229377	his	509	" You two were so close about him that I thought you would like me to be the same , "
229449	229459	229377	229377	his	509	" Besides , I was n't proud of him . "
229460	229479	229481	229481	Judy	508	" Besides which , it was nothing to you , you know , whether he was or not , "
229490	229502	229504	229504	Small	491	" He never saw me in his life to know me , "
229506	229521	229504	229504	Small	491	" I do n't know why I should introduce HIM , I am sure ! "
229522	229537	229538	229540	the old gentleman	985	" No , he never communicated with us , which is to be deplored , "
229544	229667	229538	229540	the old gentleman	985	" but I have come to look after the property - to look over the papers , and to look after the property . We shall make good our title . It is in the hands of my solicitor . Mr. Tulkinghorn , of Lincoln 's Inn Fields , over the way there , is so good as to act as my solicitor ; and grass do n't grow under HIS feet , I can tell ye . Krook was Mrs. Smallweed 's only brother ; she had no relation but Krook , and Krook had no relation but Mrs. Smallweed . I am speaking of your brother , you brimstone black- beetle , that was seventy - six years of age . "

232965	232973	232975	232975	Phil	521	" There IS a way , commander , "
232982	232987	232975	232975	Phil	521	" of settling this . "
232988	233001	233002	233002	Phil	521	" Paying the money , I suppose ? I wish I could . "
233007	233025	233027	233027	Phil	521	" No , guv'ner , no ; not so bad as that . There IS a way , "
233037	233047	233027	233027	Phil	521	" what I 'm a - doing at present . "
233048	233051	233052	233052	Phil	521	" Whitewashing . "
233055	233095	233097	233098	the trooper	3804	" A pretty way that would be ! Do you know what would become of the Bagnets in that case ? Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my old scores ? YOU'RE a moral character , "

233595	233606	233593	233593	she	4703	" and how do YOU do , this sunshiny morning ? "
233713	233718	233720	233721	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Now , George , "
233724	233732	233720	233721	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" here we are , Lignum and myself "
233779	233817	233734	233734	she	4703	" just looked in , we have , to make it all correct as usual about that security . Give him the new bill to sign , George , and he 'll sign it like a man . "
233818	233827	233829	233830	the trooper	3804	" I was coming to you this morning , "
233833	233905	233907	233908	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Yes , we thought you 'd come to us this morning , but we turned out early and left Woolwich , the best of boys , to mind his sisters and came to you instead - as you see ! For Lignum , he 's tied so close now , and gets so little exercise , that a walk does him good . But what 's the matter , George ? "
233916	233923	233912	233912	her	553	" You do n't look yourself . "
233924	233931	233933	233934	the trooper	3804	" I am not quite myself , "
233936	233948	233933	233934	the trooper	3804	" I have been a little put out , Mrs. Bagnet . "
233958	233961	233964	233964	her	553	" George ! "
233967	233996	233964	233964	her	553	" Do n't tell me there 's anything wrong about that security of Lignum 's ! Do n't do it , George , on account of the children ! "
234007	234010	234012	234013	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" George , "
234032	234109	234012	234013	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" If you have allowed anything wrong to come to that security of Lignum 's , and if you have let him in for it , and if you have put us in danger of being sold up - and I see sold up in your face , George , as plain as print - you have done a shameful action and have deceived us cruelly . I tell you , cruelly , George . There ! "
234156	234159	234161	234163	that old girl	4721	" George , "
234165	234278	234161	234163	that old girl	4721	" I wonder at you ! George , I am ashamed of you ! George , I could n't have believed you would have done it ! I always knew you to be a rolling stone that gathered no moss , but I never thought you would have taken away what little moss there was for Bagnet and the children to lie upon . You know what a hard - working , steady - going chap he is . You know what Quebec and Malta and Woolwich are , and I never did think you would , or could , have had the heart to serve us so . Oh , George ! "
234296	234303	234279	234280	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" How could you do it ? "
234347	234350	234352	234353	the trooper	3804	" Mat , "
234368	234404	234407	234407	he	552	" I am sorry you take it so much to heart , because I do hope it 's not so bad as that comes to . I certainly have , this morning , received this letter "
234411	234524	234352	234353	the trooper	3804	" but I hope it may be set right yet . As to a rolling stone , why , what you say is true . I AM a rolling stone , and I never rolled in anybody 's way , I fully believe , that I rolled the least good to . But it 's impossible for an old vagabond comrade to like your wife and family better than I like 'em , Mat , and I trust you 'll look upon me as forgivingly as you can . Do n't think I 've kept anything from you . I have n't had the letter more than a quarter of an hour . "
234525	234529	234531	234532	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Old girl , "
234538	234546	234531	234532	Mr. Bagnet	552	" will you tell him my opinion ? "
234547	234556	234557	234558	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Oh ! Why did n't he marry , "
234567	234587	234557	234558	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Joe Pouch 's widder in North America ? Then he would n't have got himself into these troubles . "
234588	234593	234595	234596	Mr. Bagnet	552	" The old girl , "
234598	234608	234595	234596	Mr. Bagnet	552	" puts it correct - why did n't you ? "
234609	234624	234626	234627	the trooper	3804	" Well , she has a better husband by this time , I hope , "
234629	234732	234734	234735	the trooper	3804	" Anyhow , here I stand , this present day , NOT married to Joe Pouch 's widder . What shall I do ? You see all I have got about me . It 's not mine ; it 's yours . Give the word , and I 'll sell off every morsel . If I could have hoped it would have brought in nearly the sum wanted , I 'd have sold all long ago . Do n't believe that I 'll leave you or yours in the lurch , Mat . I 'd sell myself first . I only wish , "
234746	234766	234734	234735	the trooper	3804	" that I knew of any one who 'd buy such a second - hand piece of old stores . "
234767	234771	234773	234774	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Old girl , "
234776	234785	234773	234774	Mr. Bagnet	552	" give him another bit of my mind . "
234786	234789	234791	234793	the old girl	4703	" George , "
234795	234819	234791	234793	the old girl	4703	" you are not so much to be blamed , on full consideration , except for ever taking this business without the means . "
234820	234827	234834	234834	his	5737	" And that was like me ! "
234837	234844	234834	234834	his	5737	" Like me , I know . "
234845	234852	234854	234855	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Silence ! The old girl , "
234857	234873	234854	234855	Mr. Bagnet	552	" is correct - in her way of giving my opinions - hear me out ! "
234874	234980	234981	234982	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" That was when you never ought to have asked for the security , George , and when you never ought to have got it , all things considered . But what 's done ca n't be undone . You are always an honourable and straightforward fellow , as far as lays in your power , though a little flighty . On the other hand , you ca n't admit but what it 's natural in us to be anxious with such a thing hanging over our heads . So forget and forgive all round , George . Come ! Forget and forgive all round ! "
235014	235159	234998	234999	Mr. George	515	" I do assure you both , there 's nothing I would n't do to discharge this obligation . But whatever I have been able to scrape together has gone every two months in keeping it up . We have lived plainly enough here , Phil and I. But the gallery do n't quite do what was expected of it , and it 's not - in short , it 's not the mint . It was wrong in me to take it ? Well , so it was . But I was in a manner drawn into that step , and I thought it might steady me , and set me up , and you 'll try to overlook my having such expectations , and upon my soul , I am very much obliged to you , and very much ashamed of myself . "
235216	235223	235225	235226	Mr. Bagnet	552	" George , hear me out ! "
235233	235240	235225	235226	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Old girl , go on ! "
235328	235341	235343	235344	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Do n't you mind a woman 's hasty word , George , "
235352	235372	235343	235344	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" I trust my old Lignum to you , and I am sure you 'll bring him through it . "
235542	235578	235518	235519	Mr. Bagnet	552	" George , you know the old girl - she 's as sweet and as mild as milk . But touch her on the children - or myself - and she 's off like gunpowder . "
235579	235587	235644	235645	the trooper	3804	" It does her credit , Mat ! "
235588	235591	235593	235594	Mr. Bagnet	552	" George , "
235601	235632	235593	235594	Mr. Bagnet	552	" the old girl - ca n't do anything - that do n't do her credit . More or less . I never say so . Discipline must he maintained . "
235633	235642	235644	235645	the trooper	3804	" She 's worth her weight in gold , "
235647	235651	235653	235654	Mr. Bagnet	552	" In gold ? "
235656	235716	235653	235654	Mr. Bagnet	552	" I 'll tell you what . The old girl 's weight - is twelve stone six . Would I take that weight - in any metal - for the old girl ? No . Why not ? Because the old girl 's metal is far more precious - than the preciousest metal . And she 's ALL metal ! "
235717	235724	235593	235594	Mr. Bagnet	552	" You are right , Mat ! "
235725	235758	235760	235761	Mr. Bagnet	552	" When she took me - and accepted of the ring - she ' listed under me and the children - heart and head , for life . She 's that earnest , "
235763	235818	235760	235761	Mr. Bagnet	552	" and true to her colours - that , touch us with a finger - and she turns out - and stands to her arms . If the old girl fires wide - once in a way - at the call of duty - look over it , George . For she 's loyal ! "
235819	235827	235829	235830	the trooper	3804	" Why , bless her , Mat , "
235832	235842	235829	235830	the trooper	3804	" I think the higher of her for it ! "
235843	235848	235850	235851	Mr. Bagnet	552	" You are right ! "
235867	235908	235850	235851	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Think as high of the old girl - as the rock of Gibraltar - and still you 'll be thinking low - of such merits . But I never own to it before her . Discipline must be maintained . "
236043	236048	236050	236051	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" My dear friend , "
236063	236081	236050	236051	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" How de do ? How de do ? Who is our friend , my dear friend ? "
236082	236086	236088	236088	George	515	" Why this , "
236099	236117	236088	236088	George	515	" is Matthew Bagnet , who has obliged me in that matter of ours , you know . "
236118	236126	236127	236129	The old man	1212	" Oh ! Mr. Bagnet ? Surely ! "
236137	236157	236127	236129	The old man	1212	" Hope you 're well , Mr. Bagnet ? Fine man , Mr. George ! Military air , sir ! "
236200	236203	236205	236206	Mr. Smallweed	490	" Judy , "

236214	236222	236223	236224	Mr. George	515	" Why , I do n't know , "
236227	236256	236223	236224	Mr. George	515	" that the young woman need give herself that trouble , for to tell you the truth , I am not inclined to smoke it to - day . "
236257	236262	236264	236266	the old man	1212	" Ai n't you ? "
236268	236275	236264	236266	the old man	1212	" Judy , bring the pipe . "
236276	236284	236286	236286	George	515	" The fact is , Mr. Smallweed , "
236288	236319	236286	236286	George	515	" that I find myself in rather an unpleasant state of mind . It appears to me , sir , that your friend in the city has been playing tricks . "
236320	236326	236328	236329	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Oh , dear no ! "
236331	236337	236328	236329	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" He never does that ! "
236338	236374	236375	236376	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Do n't he ? Well , I am glad to hear it , because I thought it might be HIS doing . This , you know , I am speaking of . This letter . "
236389	236395	236397	236398	Mr. George	515	" What does it mean ? "
236400	236403	236405	236407	the old man	1212	" Judy , "
236409	236433	236405	236407	the old man	1212	" Have you got the pipe ? Give it to me . Did you say what does it mean , my good friend ? "
236434	236449	236451	236452	the trooper	3804	" Aye ! Now , come , come , you know , Mr. Smallweed , "
236485	236583	236455	236455	himself	3804	" a good lot of money has passed between us , and we are face to face at the present moment , and are both well aware of the understanding there has always been . I am prepared to do the usual thing which I have done regularly and to keep this matter going . I never got a letter like this from you before , and I have been a little put about by it this morning , because here 's my friend Matthew Bagnet , who , you know , had none of the money - "
236584	236593	236595	236597	the old man	1212	" I DON'T know it , you know , "
236600	236622	236595	236597	the old man	1212	" Why , con - found you - it , I mean - I tell you so , do n't I ? "
236623	236633	236635	236636	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Oh , yes , you tell me so , "
236638	236646	236635	236636	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" But I do n't know it . "
236647	236650	236652	236653	the trooper	3804	" Well ! "
236659	236664	236652	236653	the trooper	3804	" I know it . "
236672	236681	236665	236666	Mr. Smallweed	490	" Ah ! That 's quite another thing ! "
236685	236704	236665	236666	Mr. Smallweed	490	" But it do n't matter . Mr. Bagnet 's situation is all one , whether or no . "
236730	236820	236822	236823	the trooper	3804	" That 's just what I mean . As you say , Mr. Smallweed , here 's Matthew Bagnet liable to be fixed whether or no . Now , you see , that makes his good lady very uneasy in her mind , and me too , for whereas I 'm a harum - scarum sort of a good - for - nought that more kicks than halfpence come natural to , why he 's a steady family man , do n't you see ? Now , Mr. Smallweed , "
236838	236873	236822	236823	the trooper	3804	" although you and I are good friends enough in a certain sort of a way , I am well aware that I ca n't ask you to let my friend Bagnet off entirely . "
236874	236893	236828	236828	he	3804	" Oh , dear , you are too modest . You can ASK me anything , Mr. George . "
236908	236938	236902	236903	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" And you can refuse , you mean , eh ? Or not you so much , perhaps , as your friend in the city ? Ha ha ha ! "
236939	236944	236946	236947	Grandfather Smallweed	509	" Ha ha ha ! "
236978	236981	236983	236985	the sanguine George	5769	" Come ! "
236987	237068	236983	236985	the sanguine George	5769	" I am glad to find we can be pleasant , because I want to arrange this pleasantly . Here 's my friend Bagnet , and here am I. We 'll settle the matter on the spot , if you please , Mr. Smallweed , in the usual way . And you 'll ease my friend Bagnet 's mind , and his family 's mind , a good deal if you 'll just mention to him what our understanding is . "
237080	237088	237070	237072	some shrill spectre	5770	" Oh , good gracious ! Oh ! "
237136	237146	237148	237149	old Smallweed	490	" But I think you asked me , Mr. George "
237168	237181	237164	237165	the speaker	5773	" I think you asked me , what did the letter mean ? "
237182	237190	237192	237193	the trooper	3804	" Why , yes , I did , "
237201	237219	237192	237193	the trooper	3804	" but I do n't care to know particularly , if it 's all correct and pleasant . "
237247	237278	237279	237281	The two friends	5473	" That 's what it means , my dear friend . I 'll smash you . I 'll crumble you . I 'll powder you . Go to the devil ! "
237300	237306	237308	237310	the old man	1212	" Go to the devil ! "
237312	237396	237397	237397	He	552	" I 'll have no more of your pipe - smokings and swaggerings . What ? You 're an independent dragoon , too ! Go to my lawyer you remember where ; you have been there before and show your independence now , will you ? Come , my dear friend , there 's a chance for you . Open the street door , Judy ; put these blusterers out ! Call in help if they do n't go . Put 'em out ! "
237492	237497	237499	237500	Mr. George	515	" Come , Mat , "
237507	237524	237499	237500	Mr. George	515	" we must try the lawyer . Now , what do you think of this rascal ? "
237550	237565	237543	237543	his	552	" If my old girl had been here - I 'd have told him ! "
237790	237806	237807	237808	The clerk	4739	" I beg your pardon , sir , but I think those gentlemen are military ? "
237841	237848	237837	237837	himself	552	" Yes , ma'am . Formerly . "
237849	237947	237973	237975	the old lady	1406	" I thought so . I was sure of it . My heart warms , gentlemen , at the sight of you . It always does at the sight of such . God bless you , gentlemen ! You 'll excuse an old woman , but I had a son once who went for a soldier . A fine handsome youth he was , and good in his bold way , though some people did disparage him to his poor mother . I ask your pardon for troubling you , sir . God bless you , gentlemen ! "
237948	237955	237957	237958	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Same to you , ma'am ! "
238030	238033	238034	238035	Mr. Bagnet	552	" George , "
238048	238076	238077	238078	The clerk	4739	" Do n't be cast down ! ' Why , soldiers , why - should we be melancholy , boys ? ' Cheer up , my hearty ! "
238102	238109	238092	238093	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Let 'em come in then ! "
238128	238159	238160	238160	Sergeant	596	" Now , you men , what do you want ? Sergeant , I told you the last time I saw you that I do n't desire your company here . "
238206	238215	238217	238218	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" I have nothing to say to you , "
238220	238251	238217	238218	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" If you get into debt , you must pay your debts or take the consequences . You have no occasion to come here to learn that , I suppose ? "
238266	238289	238290	238290	Sergeant	596	" Very well ! Then the other man - this man , if this is he - must pay it for you . "
238307	238360	238361	238362	The lawyer	1047	" Very well ! Then you must pay it between you or you must both be sued for it and both suffer . You have had the money and must refund it . You are not to pocket other people 's pounds , shillings , and pence and escape scot - free . "
238385	238462	238375	238376	Mr. George	515	" I tell you , sergeant , I have nothing to say to you . I do n't like your associates and do n't want you here . This matter is not at all in my course of practice and is not in my office . Mr. Smallweed is good enough to offer these affairs to me , but they are not in my way . You must go to Melchisedech 's in Clifford 's Inn . "
238463	238474	238476	238477	Mr. George	515	" I must make an apology to you , sir , "
238479	238516	238476	238477	Mr. George	515	" for pressing myself upon you with so little encouragement - which is almost as unpleasant to me as it can be to you - but would you let me say a private word to you ? "
238535	238545	238556	238556	he	271	" Now ! I have no time to waste . "
238587	238592	238594	238595	Mr. George	515	" Well , sir , "
238597	238650	238594	238595	Mr. George	515	" this man with me is the other party implicated in this unfortunate affair - nominally , only nominally - and my sole object is to prevent his getting into trouble on my account . He is a most respectable man with a wife and family , formerly in the Royal Artillery - "
238651	238685	238773	238773	his	1047	" My friend , I do n't care a pinch of snuff for the whole Royal Artillery establishment - officers , men , tumbrils , waggons , horses , guns , and ammunition . "
238686	238746	238773	238773	his	1047	" ' Tis likely , sir . But I care a good deal for Bagnet and his wife and family being injured on my account . And if I could bring them through this matter , I should have no help for it but to give up without any other consideration what you wanted of me the other day . "
238747	238754	238594	238595	Mr. George	515	" Have you got it here ? "
238755	238764	238773	238773	his	1047	" I have got it here , sir . "
238765	238768	238769	238770	the lawyer	1047	" Sergeant , "
238791	238948	238773	238773	his	1047	" make up your mind while I speak to you , for this is final . After I have finished speaking I have closed the subject , and I wo n't re- open it . Understand that . You can leave here , for a few days , what you say you have brought here if you choose ; you can take it away at once if you choose . In case you choose to leave it here , I can do this for you - I can replace this matter on its old footing , and I can go so far besides as to give you a written undertaking that this man Bagnet shall never be troubled in any way until you have been proceeded against to the utmost , that your means shall be exhausted before the creditor looks to his . This is in fact all but freeing him . Have you decided ? "
238964	238972	238952	238952	his	3804	" I must do it , sir . "
239069	239088	239057	239057	he	3804	" ' Tis only a letter of instructions , sir . The last I ever had from him . "
239169	239181	239146	239146	he	271	" You can go . Show these men out , there ! "
239455	239459	239451	239452	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Old girl ! "
239473	239478	239480	239481	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Why , George ! "
239488	239494	239480	239481	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" How low you are ! "
239495	239512	239451	239452	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Am I ? Not good company ? Well , I am afraid I am not . "
239513	239524	239526	239527	little Malta	555	" He ai n't at all like Bluffy , mother ! "
239529	239541	239543	239543	Quebec	554	" Because he ai n't well , I think , mother , "
239545	239560	239562	239563	the trooper	3804	" Sure that 's a bad sign not to be like Bluffy , too ! "
239570	239576	239562	239563	the trooper	3804	" But it 's true , "
239581	239595	239562	239563	the trooper	3804	" true , I am afraid . These little ones are always right ! "
239596	239599	239601	239602	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" George , "
239607	239659	239601	239602	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" if I thought you cross enough to think of anything that a shrill old soldier 's wife - who could have bitten her tongue off afterwards and ought to have done it almost - said this morning , I do n't know what I should n't say to you now . "
239660	239668	239670	239671	the trooper	3804	" My kind soul of a darling , "
239673	239680	239670	239671	the trooper	3804	" Not a morsel of it . "
239681	239723	239601	239602	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Because really and truly , George , what I said and meant to say was that I trusted Lignum to you and was sure you 'd bring him through it . And you HAVE brought him through it , noble ! "
239724	239730	239732	239732	George	515	" Thankee , my dear ! "
239734	239743	239732	239732	George	515	" I am glad of your good opinion . "
239814	239821	239823	239823	George	515	" See there , my boy , "
239836	239889	239823	239823	George	515	" there 's a good loving forehead for you ! All bright with love of you , my boy . A little touched by the sun and the weather through following your father about and taking care of you , but as fresh and wholesome as a ripe apple on a tree . "
239911	239920	239922	239923	the trooper	3804	" The time will come , my boy , "
239925	240024	239922	239923	the trooper	3804	" when this hair of your mother 's will be grey , and this forehead all crossed and re - crossed with wrinkles , and a fine old lady she 'll be then . Take care , while you are young , that you can think in those days , ' I never whitened a hair of her dear head - I never marked a sorrowful line in her face ! ' For of all the many things that you can think of when you are a man , you had better have THAT by you , Woolwich ! "
240495	240522	240492	240492	myself	0	" Oh , more of these never - ending stairs , Charley - more and more - piled up to the sky ' , I think ! "
240837	240846	240827	240827	I	0	" Never , my sweet girl , never ! "
241214	241244	241208	241208	I	0	" Charley , if you go on in this way , I must lie down again , my darling , for I am weaker than I thought I was ! "
241407	241412	241414	241414	I	0	" Yet , Charley , "
241419	241432	241414	241414	I	0	" I miss something , surely , that I am accustomed to ? "
241452	241463	241464	241464	I	0	" Are the pictures all as they used to be ? "
241468	241476	241478	241478	Charley	534	" Every one of them , miss , "
241480	241487	241478	241478	Charley	534	" And the furniture , Charley ? "
241488	241503	241537	241537	Charley	534	" Except where I have moved it about to make more room , miss . "
241504	241508	241510	241510	I	0	" And yet , "
241512	241536	241510	241510	I	0	" I miss some familiar object . Ah , I know what it is , Charley ! It 's the looking - glass . "
241631	241651	241622	241622	I	0	" It matters very little , Charley . I hope I can do without my old face very well . "
241758	241765	241743	241743	he	10304	" My dear , dear girl ! "
241807	241812	241813	241813	I	0	" Oh , yes ! "
241816	241854	241855	241855	He	10304	" He has seen me , and he loves me better than he did ; he has seen me and is even fonder of me than he was before ; and what have I to mourn for ! "
241910	241915	241917	241917	he	10304	" My little woman , "
241919	241939	241917	241917	he	10304	" what a sad time this has been . Such an inflexible little woman , too , through all ! "
241940	241948	241950	241950	I.	0	" Only for the best , guardian , "
241951	241956	241957	241957	he	10304	" For the best ? "
241961	242025	241957	241957	he	10304	" Of course , for the best . But here have Ada and I been perfectly forlorn and miserable ; here has your friend Caddy been coming and going late and early ; here has every one about the house been utterly lost and dejected ; here has even poor Rick been writing - to ME too - in his anxiety for you ! "
242046	242054	242055	242055	he	10304	" Why , no , my dear , "
242058	242071	242055	242055	he	10304	" I have thought it better not to mention it to her . "
242072	242082	242084	242084	I	0	" And you speak of his writing to YOU , "
242090	242115	242084	242084	I	0	" As if it were not natural for him to do so , guardian ; as if he could write to a better friend ! "
242116	242125	242055	242055	he	10304	" He thinks he could , my love , "
242130	242240	242055	242055	he	10304	" and to many a better . The truth is , he wrote to me under a sort of protest while unable to write to you with any hope of an answer - wrote coldly , haughtily , distantly , resentfully . Well , dearest little woman , we must look forbearingly on it . He is not to blame . Jarndyce and Jarndyce has warped him out of himself and perverted me in his eyes . I have known it do as bad deeds , and worse , many a time . If two angels could be concerned in it , I believe it would change their nature . "
242241	242250	242055	242055	he	10304	" It has not changed yours , guardian . "
242251	242262	242263	242263	he	5868	" Oh , yes , it has , my dear , "
242267	242456	242263	242263	he	5868	" It has made the south wind easterly , I do n't know how often . Rick mistrusts and suspects me - goes to lawyers , and is taught to mistrust and suspect me . Hears I have conflicting interests , claims clashing against his and what not . Whereas , heaven knows that if I could get out of the mountains of wiglomeration on which my unfortunate name has been so long bestowed which I ca n't or could level them by the extinction of my own original right which I ca n't either , and no human power ever can , anyhow , I believe , to such a pass have we got , I would do it this hour . I would rather restore to poor Rick his proper nature than be endowed with all the money that dead suitors , broken , heart and soul , upon the wheel of Chancery , have left unclaimed with the Accountant - General - and that 's money enough , my dear , to be cast into a pyramid , in memory of Chancery 's transcendent wickedness . "
242457	242464	242465	242465	I	0	" IS it possible , guardian , "
242470	242479	242465	242465	I	0	" that Richard can be suspicious of you ? "
242480	242489	242490	242490	he	5869	" Ah , my love , my love , "
242493	242529	242490	242490	he	5869	" it is in the subtle poison of such abuses to breed such diseases . His blood is infected , and objects lose their natural aspects in his sight . It is not HIS fault . "
242530	242540	242465	242465	I	0	" But it is a terrible misfortune , guardian . "
242541	242638	242639	242639	I	0	" It is a terrible misfortune , little woman , to be ever drawn within the influences of Jarndyce and Jarndyce . I know none greater . By little and little he has been induced to trust in that rotten reed , and it communicates some portion of its rottenness to everything around him . But again I say with all my soul , we must be patient with poor Rick and not blame him . What a troop of fine fresh hearts like his have I seen in my time turned by the same means ! "
242661	242671	242672	242672	he	5870	" We must not say so , Dame Durden , "
242676	242744	242672	242672	he	5870	" Ada is the happier , I hope , and that is much . I did think that I and both these young creatures might be friends instead of distrustful foes and that we might so far counter - act the suit and prove too strong for it . But it was too much to expect . Jarndyce and Jarndyce was the curtain of Rick 's cradle . "
242745	242770	242639	242639	I	0	" But , guardian , may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is ? "
242771	242780	242782	242783	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" We WILL hope so , my Esther , "
242785	242868	242870	242870	he	288	" and that it may not teach him so too late . In any case we must not be hard on him . There are not many grown and matured men living while we speak , good men too , who if they were thrown into this same court as suitors would not be vitally changed and depreciated within three years - within two - within one . How can we stand amazed at poor Rick ? A young man so unfortunate , "
242884	242978	242879	242879	he	288	" can not at first believe who could ? that Chancery is what it is . He looks to it , flushed and fitfully , to do something with his interests and bring them to some settlement . It procrastinates , disappoints , tries , tortures him ; wears out his sanguine hopes and patience , thread by thread ; but he still looks to it , and hankers after it , and finds his whole world treacherous and hollow . Well , well , well ! Enough of this , my dear ! "
243048	243056	243058	243059	my guardian	10304	" There are better subjects than these , "
243061	243107	243058	243059	my guardian	10304	" for such a joyful time as the time of our dear girl 's recovery . And I had a commission to broach one of them as soon as I should begin to talk . When shall Ada come to see you , my love ? "
243145	243149	243151	243151	I	0	" Dear guardian , "
243153	243176	243151	243151	I	0	" as I have shut her out so long - though indeed , indeed , she is like the light to me - "
243177	243188	243189	243189	He	5874	" I know it well , Dame Durden , well . "
243229	243238	243240	243240	he	5874	" Yes , yes , you are tired , "
243242	243247	243240	243240	he	5874	" Rest a little . "
243248	243258	243259	243259	I	0	" As I have kept Ada out so long , "
243267	243359	243259	243259	I	0	" I think I should like to have my own way a little longer , guardian . It would be best to be away from here before I see her . If Charley and I were to go to some country lodging as soon as I can move , and if I had a week there in which to grow stronger and to be revived by the sweet air and to look forward to the happiness of having Ada with me again , I think it would be better for us . "
243438	243444	243446	243447	my guardian	10304	" Our spoilt little woman , "
243539	243556	243557	243557	My	0	" And my guardian put a letter in my hand , without any ordinary beginning such as "
243561	243570	243557	243557	My	0	" but rushing at once into the words , "
243600	243693	243588	243588	I	0	" and then with the utmost seriousness , and in the most emphatic terms , going on to make the extraordinary declaration he had quoted . We did not appreciate the writer the less for laughing heartily over it , and we settled that I should send him a letter of thanks on the morrow and accept his offer . It was a most agreeable one to me , for all the places I could have thought of , I should have liked to go to none so well as Chesney Wold . "
243699	243709	243710	243710	I	0	" said my guardian , looking at his watch , "
243798	243814	243791	243791	she	381	" The old conspiracy to make me happy ! Everybody seemed to be in it ! "
243819	243824	243791	243791	she	381	" said my guardian , "
243880	244235	244236	244236	My	0	" I have no doubt he knew there would be something in the simple image of the poor afflicted creature that would fall like a gentle lesson on my mind at that time . I felt it as he spoke to me . I could not tell him heartily enough how ready I was to receive her . I had always pitied her , never so much as now . I had always been glad of my little power to soothe her under her calamity , but never , never , half so glad before . We arranged a time for Miss Flite to come out by the coach and share my early dinner . When my guardian left me , I turned my face away upon my couch and prayed to be forgiven if I , surrounded by such blessings , had magnified to myself the little trial that I had to undergo . The childish prayer of that old birthday when I had aspired to be industrious , contented , and true - hearted and to do good to some one and win some love to myself if I could came back into my mind with a reproachful sense of all the happiness I had since enjoyed and all the affectionate hearts that had been turned towards me . If I were weak now , what had I profited by those mercies ? I repeated the old childish prayer in its old childish words and found that its old peace had not departed from it . My guardian now came every day . In a week or so more I could walk about our rooms and hold long talks with Ada from behind the window - curtain . Yet I never saw her , for I had not as yet the courage to look at the dear face , though I could have done so easily without her seeing me . On the appointed day Miss Flite arrived . The poor little creature ran into my room quite forgetful of her usual dignity , and crying from her very heart of hearts , "
244241	244252	244238	244239	Fitz Jarndyce	447	" fell upon my neck and kissed me twenty times . "
244256	244267	244238	244239	Fitz Jarndyce	447	" said she , putting her hand into her reticule , "
244287	244325	244331	244332	Fitz Jarndyce	447	" Charley gave her one , and the good creature certainly made use of it , for she held it to her eyes with both hands and sat so , shedding tears for the next ten minutes . "
244334	244341	244331	244332	Fitz Jarndyce	447	" she was careful to explain . "
244400	244434	244393	244394	my dear	9610	" Miss Flite here looked at Charley , who had been to meet her at the place where the coach stopped . Charley glanced at me and looked unwilling to pursue the suggestion . "
244440	244445	244393	244394	my dear	9610	" said Miss Flite , "
244490	244499	244478	244478	you	447	" said Miss Flite , touching her forehead . "
244503	244504	244478	244478	you	447	" "
244513	244528	244507	244507	you	0	" said I , smiling , for I saw she wanted to go on . "
244542	244558	244537	244537	you	447	" Miss Flite looked at Charley for advice in this important crisis , who said , "
244571	244580	244565	244565	you	447	" and therein gratified Miss Flite beyond measure . "
244588	244598	244584	244586	our young friend	9622	" said she to me in her mysterious way . "
244651	244652	244653	244653	Jenny	366	" "
244661	244665	244653	244653	Jenny	366	" said Charley . "
244669	244678	244679	244679	Jenny	366	" Miss Flite acquiesced with the greatest suavity . "
244750	244751	244744	244748	the lady with the veil	5912	" "
244758	244770	244753	244753	you	366	" said Charley , to whom I looked in some astonishment , "
244825	244826	244801	244801	I	0	" "
244829	244849	244801	244801	I	0	" whispered Miss Flite , making a variety of motions about her own forehead to express intellect in Charley . "
244872	244873	244862	244862	she	5912	" "
244878	244882	244876	244876	Charley	534	" I returned . "
244889	244890	244893	244893	miss	9656	" "
244895	244899	244893	244893	miss	9656	" said Charley , "
244956	244957	244954	244954	miss	9656	" "
244965	244968	244954	244954	miss	9656	" said I. "
244972	244989	244954	244954	miss	9656	" Miss Flite suggested , advancing her lips to my ear with her most mysterious look , "
245048	245270	245045	245046	the jeweller	5929	" I did not think very much about this lady then , for I had an impression that it might be Caddy . Besides , my attention was diverted by my visitor , who was cold after her ride and looked hungry and who , our dinner being brought in , required some little assistance in arraying herself with great satisfaction in a pitiable old scarf and a much - worn and often - mended pair of gloves , which she had brought down in a paper parcel . I had to preside , too , over the entertainment , consisting of a dish of fish , a roast fowl , a sweetbread , vegetables , pudding , and Madeira ; and it was so pleasant to see how she enjoyed it , and with what state and ceremony she did honour to it , that I was soon thinking of nothing else . When we had finished and had our little dessert before us , embellished by the hands of my dear , who would yield the superintendence of everything prepared for me to no one , Miss Flite was so very chatty and happy that I thought I would lead her to her own history , as she was always pleased to talk about herself . I began by saying "
245284	245285	245281	245282	Miss Flite	381	" "
245306	245339	245340	245340	My	0	" There was an anxiety even in her hopefulness that made me doubtful if I had done right in approaching the subject . I thought I would say no more about it . "
245346	245351	245352	245353	My brother	11816	" said Miss Flite . "
245370	245371	245367	245367	I	0	" "
245376	245377	245378	245378	Ye	9610	" "
245389	245421	245386	245387	my dear	9610	" said she . As I saw she would go on , I thought it best to try to be serviceable to her by meeting the theme rather than avoiding it . "
245428	245432	245386	245387	my dear	9610	" said I , "
245440	245441	245386	245387	my dear	9610	" "
245447	245452	245386	245387	my dear	9610	" she answered promptly , "
245458	245459	245386	245387	my dear	9610	" "
245468	245469	245386	245387	my dear	9610	" "
245474	245478	245386	245387	my dear	9610	" said she . "
245506	245521	245498	245498	I	0	" She slightly showed me her arm , and it was fearfully thin indeed . "
245527	245536	245498	245498	I	0	" she went on in her mysterious way , "
245590	245617	245586	245586	you	9610	" I tried to assure her that this was not so . She heard me patiently and smilingly , but was ready with her own answer . "
245691	245706	245715	245716	Draw people	5945	" What could they do , did she think ? I mildly asked her . "
245709	245714	245715	245716	Draw people	5945	" returned Miss Flite . "
245763	245808	245748	245748	them	5945	" She tapped me several times upon the arm and nodded good - humouredly as if she were anxious I should understand that I had no cause to fear her , though she spoke so gloomily , and confided these awful secrets to me . "
245813	245817	245748	245748	them	5945	" said she . "
246037	246080	246081	246081	You	5964	" Having got over her own short narrative , in the delivery of which she had spoken in a low , strained voice , as if the shock were fresh upon her , she gradually resumed her usual air of amiable importance . "
246270	246275	246264	246265	Fitz Jarndyce	447	" speaking low again , "
246303	246355	246289	246290	some one	1103	" She looked at me in silence for some moments , with her face gradually softening into a smile . Seeming to fear that she had been too gloomy , and seeming also to lose the connexion in her mind , she said politely as she sipped her glass of wine , "
246386	246438	246373	246373	I	0	" I was much impressed by her allusion to Richard and by the sad meaning , so sadly illustrated in her poor pinched form , that made its way through all her incoherence . But happily for her , she was quite complacent again now and beamed with nods and smiles . "
246444	246459	246441	246442	my dear	9610	" she said , gaily , reaching another hand to put it upon mine . "
246475	246491	246492	246493	My physician	11579	" I was obliged to confess that I did not quite know what she meant . "
246540	246541	246523	246523	I	0	" "
246551	246555	246542	246543	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" said I , "
246570	246571	246567	246568	Miss Flite	381	" "
246577	246581	246567	246568	Miss Flite	381	" she returned , "
246594	246595	246586	246586	you	9613	" "
246598	246601	246586	246586	you	9613	" said I. "
246615	246616	246612	246613	Fitz Jarndyce	447	" "
246619	246622	246612	246613	Fitz Jarndyce	447	" said I. "
246632	246633	246627	246627	I	0	" "
246696	246697	246698	246699	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" "
246702	246703	246698	246699	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" "
246878	247108	246873	246873	you	9610	" And I DID read all the noble history , though very slowly and imperfectly then , for my eyes were so dimmed that I could not see the words , and I cried so much that I was many times obliged to lay down the long account she had cut out of the newspaper . I felt so triumphant ever to have known the man who had done such generous and gallant deeds , I felt such glowing exultation in his renown , I so admired and loved what he had done , that I envied the storm - worn people who had fallen at his feet and blessed him as their preserver . I could myself have kneeled down then , so far away , and blessed him in my rapture that he should be so truly good and brave . I felt that no one - mother , sister , wife - could honour him more than I. I did , indeed ! My poor little visitor made me a present of the account , and when as the evening began to close in she rose to take her leave , lest she should miss the coach by which she was to return , she was still full of the shipwreck , which I had not yet sufficiently composed myself to understand in all its details . "
247112	247125	246873	246873	you	9610	" said she as she carefully folded up her scarf and gloves , "
247150	247168	247144	247144	You	9610	" That he well deserved one , yes . That he would ever have one , no . "
247175	247221	247172	247173	Fitz Jarndyce	447	" she asked rather sharply . I said it was not the custom in England to confer titles on men distinguished by peaceful services , however good and great , unless occasionally when they consisted of the accumulation of some very large amount of money . "
247227	247232	247224	247225	good gracious	6004	" said Miss Flite , "
247313	247937	247938	247938	Esther	283	" I am afraid she believed what she said , for there were moments when she was very mad indeed . And now I must part with the little secret I have thus far tried to keep . I had thought , sometimes , that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that if he had been richer he would perhaps have told me that he loved me before he went away . I had thought , sometimes , that if he had done so , I should have been glad of it . But how much better it was now that this had never happened ! What should I have suffered if I had had to write to him and tell him that the poor face he had known as mine was quite gone from me and that I freely released him from his bondage to one whom he had never seen ! Oh , it was so much better as it was ! With a great pang mercifully spared me , I could take back to my heart my childish prayer to be all he had so brightly shown himself ; and there was nothing to be undone : no chain for me to break or for him to drag ; and I could go , please God , my lowly way along the path of duty , and he could go his nobler way upon its broader road ; and though we were apart upon the journey , I might aspire to meet him , unselfishly , innocently , better far than he had thought me when I found some favour in his eyes , at the journey 's end . CHAPTER XXXVI Chesney Wold Charley and I did not set off alone upon our expedition into Lincolnshire . My guardian had made up his mind not to lose sight of me until I was safe in Mr. Boythorn 's house , so he accompanied us , and we were two days upon the road . I found every breath of air , and every scent , and every flower and leaf and blade of grass , and every passing cloud , and everything in nature , more beautiful and wonderful to me than I had ever found it yet . This was my first gain from my illness . How little I had lost , when the wide world was so full of delight for me . My guardian intending to go back immediately , we appointed , on our way down , a day when my dear girl should come . I wrote her a letter , of which he took charge , and he left us within half an hour of our arrival at our destination , on a delightful evening in the early summer - time . If a good fairy had built the house for me with a wave of her wand , and I had been a princess and her favoured god - child , I could not have been more considered in it . So many preparations were made for me and such an endearing remembrance was shown of all my little tastes and likings that I could have sat down , overcome , a dozen times before I had revisited half the rooms . I did better than that , however , by showing them all to Charley instead . Charley 's delight calmed mine ; and after we had had a walk in the garden , and Charley had exhausted her whole vocabulary of admiring expressions , I was as tranquilly happy as I ought to have been . It was a great comfort to be able to say to myself after tea , "
247964	248204	248205	248205	Esther	283	" He had left a note of welcome for me , as sunny as his own face , and had confided his bird to my care , which I knew to be his highest mark of confidence . Accordingly I wrote a little note to him in London , telling him how all his favourite plants and trees were looking , and how the most astonishing of birds had chirped the honours of the house to me in the most hospitable manner , and how , after singing on my shoulder , to the inconceivable rapture of my little maid , he was then at roost in the usual corner of his cage , but whether dreaming or no I could not report . My note finished and sent off to the post , I made myself very busy in unpacking and arranging ; and I sent Charley to bed in good time and told her I should want her no more that night . For I had not yet looked in the glass and had never asked to have my own restored to me . I knew this to be a weakness which must be overcome , but I had always said to myself that I would begin afresh when I got to where I now was . Therefore I had wanted to be alone , and therefore I said , now alone , in my own room , "
248237	248737	248231	248231	your	283	" I was quite resolved to keep it , but I sat down for a little while first to reflect upon all my blessings . And then I said my prayers and thought a little more . My hair had not been cut off , though it had been in danger more than once . It was long and thick . I let it down , and shook it out , and went up to the glass upon the dressing - table . There was a little muslin curtain drawn across it . I drew it back and stood for a moment looking through such a veil of my own hair that I could see nothing else . Then I put my hair aside and looked at the reflection in the mirror , encouraged by seeing how placidly it looked at me . I was very much changed - oh , very , very much . At first my face was so strange to me that I think I should have put my hands before it and started back but for the encouragement I have mentioned . Very soon it became more familiar , and then I knew the extent of the alteration in it better than I had done at first . It was not like what I had expected , but I had expected nothing definite , and I dare say anything definite would have surprised me . I had never been a beauty and had never thought myself one , but I had been very different from this . It was all gone now . Heaven was so good to me that I could let it go with a few not bitter tears and could stand there arranging my hair for the night quite thankfully . One thing troubled me , and I considered it for a long time before I went to sleep . I had kept Mr. Woodcourt 's flowers . When they were withered I had dried them and put them in a book that I was fond of . Nobody knew this , not even Ada . I was doubtful whether I had a right to preserve what he had sent to one so different - whether it was generous towards him to do it . I wished to be generous to him , even in the secret depths of my heart , which he would never know , because I could have loved him - could have been devoted to him . At last I came to the conclusion that I might keep them if I treasured them only as a remembrance of what was irrevocably past and gone , never to be looked back on any more , in any other light . I hope this may not seem trivial . I was very much in earnest . I took care to be up early in the morning and to be before the glass when Charley came in on tiptoe . "
248744	248750	248742	248742	miss	9656	" cried Charley , starting . "
248755	248756	248753	248753	you	9656	" "
248761	248771	248759	248759	Charley	534	" said I , quietly putting up my hair . "
248783	249121	249122	249122	Stubbs	598	" I saw it was a weight off Charley 's mind , but it was a greater weight off mine . I knew the worst now and was composed to it . I shall not conceal , as I go on , the weaknesses I could not quite conquer , but they always passed from me soon and the happier frame of mind stayed by me faithfully . Wishing to be fully re - established in my strength and my good spirits before Ada came , I now laid down a little series of plans with Charley for being in the fresh air all day long . We were to be out before breakfast , and were to dine early , and were to be out again before and after dinner , and were to talk in the garden after tea , and were to go to rest betimes , and were to climb every hill and explore every road , lane , and field in the neighbourhood . As to restoratives and strengthening delicacies , Mr. Boythorn 's good housekeeper was for ever trotting about with something to eat or drink in her hand ; I could not even be heard of as resting in the park but she would come trotting after me with a basket , her cheerful face shining with a lecture on the importance of frequent nourishment . Then there was a pony expressly for my riding , a chubby pony with a short neck and a mane all over his eyes who could canter - when he would - so easily and quietly that he was a treasure . In a very few days he would come to me in the paddock when I called him , and eat out of my hand , and follow me about . We arrived at such a capital understanding that when he was jogging with me lazily , and rather obstinately , down some shady lane , if I patted his neck and said , "
249159	249367	249143	249143	you	598	" he would give his head a comical shake or two and set off directly , while Charley would stand still and laugh with such enjoyment that her laughter was like music . I do n't know who had given Stubbs his name , but it seemed to belong to him as naturally as his rough coat . Once we put him in a little chaise and drove him triumphantly through the green lanes for five miles ; but all at once , as we were extolling him to the skies , he seemed to take it ill that he should have been accompanied so far by the circle of tantalizing little gnats that had been hovering round and round his ears the whole way without appearing to advance an inch , and stopped to think about it . I suppose he came to the decision that it was not to be borne , for he steadily refused to move until I gave the reins to Charley and got out and walked , when he followed me with a sturdy sort of good humour , putting his head under my arm and rubbing his ear against my sleeve . It was in vain for me to say , "
249394	249793	249794	249794	Mother	11737	" for the moment I left him , he stood stock still again . Consequently I was obliged to lead the way , as before ; and in this order we returned home , to the great delight of the village . Charley and I had reason to call it the most friendly of villages , I am sure , for in a week 's time the people were so glad to see us go by , though ever so frequently in the course of a day , that there were faces of greeting in every cottage . I had known many of the grown people before and almost all the children , but now the very steeple began to wear a familiar and affectionate look . Among my new friends was an old old woman who lived in such a little thatched and whitewashed dwelling that when the outside shutter was turned up on its hinges , it shut up the whole house - front . This old lady had a grandson who was a sailor , and I wrote a letter to him for her and drew at the top of it the chimney - corner in which she had brought him up and where his old stool yet occupied its old place . This was considered by the whole village the most wonderful achievement in the world , but when an answer came back all the way from Plymouth , in which he mentioned that he was going to take the picture all the way to America , and from America would write again , I got all the credit that ought to have been given to the post- office and was invested with the merit of the whole system . Thus , what with being so much in the air , playing with so many children , gossiping with so many people , sitting on invitation in so many cottages , going on with Charley 's education , and writing long letters to Ada every day , I had scarcely any time to think about that little loss of mine and was almost always cheerful . If I did think of it at odd moments now and then , I had only to be busy and forget it . I felt it more than I had hoped I should once when a child said , "
249811	250008	249806	249806	she	1169	" But when I found the child was not less fond of me , and drew its soft hand over my face with a kind of pitying protection in its touch , that soon set me up again . There were many little occurrences which suggested to me , with great consolation , how natural it is to gentle hearts to be considerate and delicate towards any inferiority . One of these particularly touched me . I happened to stroll into the little church when a marriage was just concluded , and the young couple had to sign the register . The bridegroom , to whom the pen was handed first , made a rude cross for his mark ; the bride , who came next , did the same . Now , I had known the bride when I was last there , not only as the prettiest girl in the place , but as having quite distinguished herself in the school , and I could not help looking at her with some surprise . She came aside and whispered to me , while tears of honest love and admiration stood in her bright eyes , "
250043	250780	250781	250782	Miss Summerson	283	" Why , what had I to fear , I thought , when there was this nobility in the soul of a labouring man 's daughter ! The air blew as freshly and revivingly upon me as it had ever blown , and the healthy colour came into my new face as it had come into my old one . Charley was wonderful to see , she was so radiant and so rosy ; and we both enjoyed the whole day and slept soundly the whole night . There was a favourite spot of mine in the park - woods of Chesney Wold where a seat had been erected commanding a lovely view . The wood had been cleared and opened to improve this point of sight , and the bright sunny landscape beyond was so beautiful that I rested there at least once every day . A picturesque part of the Hall , called the Ghost 's Walk , was seen to advantage from this higher ground ; and the startling name , and the old legend in the Dedlock family which I had heard from Mr. Boythorn accounting for it , mingled with the view and gave it something of a mysterious interest in addition to its real charms . There was a bank here , too , which was a famous one for violets ; and as it was a daily delight of Charley 's to gather wild flowers , she took as much to the spot as I did . It would be idle to inquire now why I never went close to the house or never went inside it . The family were not there , I had heard on my arrival , and were not expected . I was far from being incurious or uninterested about the building ; on the contrary , I often sat in this place wondering how the rooms ranged and whether any echo like a footstep really did resound at times , as the story said , upon the lonely Ghost 's Walk . The indefinable feeling with which Lady Dedlock had impressed me may have had some influence in keeping me from the house even when she was absent . I am not sure . Her face and figure were associated with it , naturally ; but I can not say that they repelled me from it , though something did . For whatever reason or no reason , I had never once gone near it , down to the day at which my story now arrives . I was resting at my favourite point after a long ramble , and Charley was gathering violets at a little distance from me . I had been looking at the Ghost 's Walk lying in a deep shade of masonry afar off and picturing to myself the female shape that was said to haunt it when I became aware of a figure approaching through the wood . The perspective was so long and so darkened by leaves , and the shadows of the branches on the ground made it so much more intricate to the eye , that at first I could not discern what figure it was . By little and little it revealed itself to be a woman 's - a lady 's - Lady Dedlock 's . She was alone and coming to where I sat with a much quicker step , I observed to my surprise , than was usual with her . I was fluttered by her being unexpectedly so near she was almost within speaking distance before I knew her and would have risen to continue my walk . But I could not . I was rendered motionless . Not so much by her hurried gesture of entreaty , not so much by her quick advance and outstretched hands , not so much by the great change in her manner and the absence of her haughty self - restraint , as by a something in her face that I had pined for and dreamed of when I was a little child , something I had never seen in any face , something I had never seen in hers before . A dread and faintness fell upon me , and I called to Charley . Lady Dedlock stopped upon the instant and changed back almost to what I had known her . "
250792	250800	250787	250787	I	0	" she said , now advancing slowly . "
250826	250892	250817	250817	I	0	" I could no more have removed my eyes from her pale face than I could have stirred from the bench on which I sat . She gave me her hand , and its deadly coldness , so at variance with the enforced composure of her features , deepened the fascination that overpowered me . I can not say what was in my whirling thoughts . "
250898	250903	250817	250817	I	0	" she asked kindly . "
250916	250917	250913	250914	Lady Dedlock	266	" "

250948	250952	250931	250931	you	266	" said I , "
250965	251114	250959	250959	I	0	" Charley , with her best curtsy , blushingly tied on her bonnet and went her way . When she was gone , Lady Dedlock sat down on the seat beside me . I can not tell in any words what the state of my mind was when I saw in her hand my handkerchief with which I had covered the dead baby . I looked at her , but I could not see her , I could not hear her , I could not draw my breath . The beating of my heart was so violent and wild that I felt as if my life were breaking from me . But when she caught me to her breast , kissed me , wept over me , compassionated me , and called me back to myself ; when she fell down on her knees and cried to me , "
251138	251444	251125	251129	your wicked and unhappy mother	6024	" - when I saw her at my feet on the bare earth in her great agony of mind , I felt , through all my tumult of emotion , a burst of gratitude to the providence of God that I was so changed as that I never could disgrace her by any trace of likeness , as that nobody could ever now look at me and look at her and remotely think of any near tie between us . I raised my mother up , praying and beseeching her not to stoop before me in such affliction and humiliation . I did so in broken , incoherent words , for besides the trouble I was in , it frightened me to see her at MY feet . I told her - or I tried to tell her - that if it were for me , her child , under any circumstances to take upon me to forgive her , I did it , and had done it , many , many years . I told her that my heart overflowed with love for her , that it was natural love which nothing in the past had changed or could change . That it was not for me , then resting for the first time on my mother 's bosom , to take her to account for having given me life , but that my duty was to bless her and receive her , though the whole world turned from her , and that I only asked her leave to do it . I held my mother in my embrace , and she held me in hers , and among the still woods in the silence of the summer day there seemed to be nothing but our two troubled minds that was not at peace . "
251451	251456	251125	251129	your wicked and unhappy mother	6024	" groaned my mother , "
251522	251553	251518	251518	I	0	" Even in the thinking of her endurance , she drew her habitual air of proud indifference about her like a veil , though she soon cast it off again . "
251587	251940	251576	251577	a husband	13632	" These words she uttered with a suppressed cry of despair , more terrible in its sound than any shriek . Covering her face with her hands , she shrank down in my embrace as if she were unwilling that I should touch her ; nor could I , by my utmost persuasions or by any endearments I could use , prevail upon her to rise . She said , no , no , no , she could only speak to me so ; she must be proud and disdainful everywhere else ; she would be humbled and ashamed there , in the only natural moments of her life . My unhappy mother told me that in my illness she had been nearly frantic . She had but then known that her child was living . She could not have suspected me to be that child before . She had followed me down here to speak to me but once in all her life . We never could associate , never could communicate , never probably from that time forth could interchange another word on earth . She put into my hands a letter she had written for my reading only and said when I had read it and destroyed it - but not so much for her sake , since she asked nothing , as for her husband 's and my own - I must evermore consider her as dead . If I could believe that she loved me , in this agony in which I saw her , with a mother 's love , she asked me to do that , for then I might think of her with a greater pity , imagining what she suffered . She had put herself beyond all hope and beyond all help . Whether she preserved her secret until death or it came to be discovered and she brought dishonour and disgrace upon the name she had taken , it was her solitary struggle always ; and no affection could come near her , and no human creature could render her any aid .

252371	252372	252373	252374	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" "
252376	252386	252373	252374	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" I was beginning when my mother hurriedly inquired , "
252391	252392	252388	252388	HE	288	" "
252395	252398	252388	252388	HE	288	" said I. "
252410	252428	252430	252430	he	288	" And I told her what he had related to me as his knowledge of my story . "
252437	252441	252445	252445	he	288	" said I , "
252448	252475	252445	252445	he	288	" My mother , who until this time had made no change in her position , raised her hand up to my lips and stopped me . "
252481	252489	252445	252445	he	288	" she said after a little while . "
252526	252692	252693	252693	My	0	" I explained , as nearly as I could then , or can recall now - for my agitation and distress throughout were so great that I scarcely understood myself , though every word that was uttered in the mother 's voice , so unfamiliar and so melancholy to me , which in my childhood I had never learned to love and recognize , had never been sung to sleep with , had never heard a blessing from , had never had a hope inspired by , made an enduring impression on my memory - I say I explained , or tried to do it , how I had only hoped that Mr. Jarndyce , who had been the best of fathers to me , might be able to afford some counsel and support to her . But my mother answered no , it was impossible ; no one could help her . Through the desert that lay before her , she must go alone . "
252699	252703	252693	252693	My	0	" she said . "
252839	253550	253551	253551	Your	6056	" We held one another for a little space yet , but she was so firm that she took my hands away , and put them back against my breast , and with a last kiss as she held them there , released them , and went from me into the wood . I was alone , and calm and quiet below me in the sun and shade lay the old house , with its terraces and turrets , on which there had seemed to me to be such complete repose when I first saw it , but which now looked like the obdurate and unpitying watcher of my mother 's misery . Stunned as I was , as weak and helpless at first as I had ever been in my sick chamber , the necessity of guarding against the danger of discovery , or even of the remotest suspicion , did me service . I took such precautions as I could to hide from Charley that I had been crying , and I constrained myself to think of every sacred obligation that there was upon me to be careful and collected . It was not a little while before I could succeed or could even restrain bursts of grief , but after an hour or so I was better and felt that I might return . I went home very slowly and told Charley , whom I found at the gate looking for me , that I had been tempted to extend my walk after Lady Dedlock had left me and that I was over - tired and would lie down . Safe in my own room , I read the letter . I clearly derived from it - and that was much then - that I had not been abandoned by my mother . Her elder and only sister , the godmother of my childhood , discovering signs of life in me when I had been laid aside as dead , had in her stern sense of duty , with no desire or willingness that I should live , reared me in rigid secrecy and had never again beheld my mother 's face from within a few hours of my birth . So strangely did I hold my place in this world that until within a short time back I had never , to my own mother 's knowledge , breathed - had been buried - had never been endowed with life - had never borne a name . When she had first seen me in the church she had been startled and had thought of what would have been like me if it had ever lived , and had lived on , but that was all then . What more the letter told me needs not to be repeated here . It has its own times and places in my story . My first care was to burn what my mother had written and to consume even its ashes . I hope it may not appear very unnatural or bad in me that I then became heavily sorrowful to think I had ever been reared . That I felt as if I knew it would have been better and happier for many people if indeed I had never breathed . That I had a terror of myself as the danger and the possible disgrace of my own mother and of a proud family name . That I was so confused and shaken as to be possessed by a belief that it was right and had been intended that I should die in my birth , and that it was wrong and not intended that I should be then alive . These are the real feelings that I had . I fell asleep worn out , and when I awoke I cried afresh to think that I was back in the world with my load of trouble for others . I was more than ever frightened of myself , thinking anew of her against whom I was a witness , of the owner of Chesney Wold , of the new and terrible meaning of the old words now moaning in my ear like a surge upon the shore , "
253595	253604	253563	253563	hers	9597	" With them , those other words returned , "
253619	254978	254979	254979	Charley	534	" I could not disentangle all that was about me , and I felt as if the blame and the shame were all in me , and the visitation had come down . The day waned into a gloomy evening , overcast and sad , and I still contended with the same distress . I went out alone , and after walking a little in the park , watching the dark shades falling on the trees and the fitful flight of the bats , which sometimes almost touched me , was attracted to the house for the first time . Perhaps I might not have gone near it if I had been in a stronger frame of mind . As it was , I took the path that led close by it . I did not dare to linger or to look up , but I passed before the terrace garden with its fragrant odours , and its broad walks , and its well - kept beds and smooth turf ; and I saw how beautiful and grave it was , and how the old stone balustrades and parapets , and wide flights of shallow steps , were seamed by time and weather ; and how the trained moss and ivy grew about them , and around the old stone pedestal of the sun - dial ; and I heard the fountain falling . Then the way went by long lines of dark windows diversified by turreted towers and porches of eccentric shapes , where old stone lions and grotesque monsters bristled outside dens of shadow and snarled at the evening gloom over the escutcheons they held in their grip . Thence the path wound underneath a gateway , and through a court - yard where the principal entrance was I hurried quickly on , and by the stables where none but deep voices seemed to be , whether in the murmuring of the wind through the strong mass of ivy holding to a high red wall , or in the low complaining of the weathercock , or in the barking of the dogs , or in the slow striking of a clock . So , encountering presently a sweet smell of limes , whose rustling I could hear , I turned with the turning of the path to the south front , and there above me were the balustrades of the Ghost 's Walk and one lighted window that might be my mother 's . The way was paved here , like the terrace overhead , and my footsteps from being noiseless made an echoing sound upon the flags . Stopping to look at nothing , but seeing all I did see as I went , I was passing quickly on , and in a few moments should have passed the lighted window , when my echoing footsteps brought it suddenly into my mind that there was a dreadful truth in the legend of the Ghost 's Walk , that it was I who was to bring calamity upon the stately house and that my warning feet were haunting it even then . Seized with an augmented terror of myself which turned me cold , I ran from myself and everything , retraced the way by which I had come , and never paused until I had gained the lodge - gate , and the park lay sullen and black behind me . Not before I was alone in my own room for the night and had again been dejected and unhappy there did I begin to know how wrong and thankless this state was . But from my darling who was coming on the morrow , I found a joyful letter , full of such loving anticipation that I must have been of marble if it had not moved me ; from my guardian , too , I found another letter , asking me to tell Dame Durden , if I should see that little woman anywhere , that they had moped most pitiably without her , that the housekeeping was going to rack and ruin , that nobody else could manage the keys , and that everybody in and about the house declared it was not the same house and was becoming rebellious for her return . Two such letters together made me think how far beyond my deserts I was beloved and how happy I ought to be . That made me think of all my past life ; and that brought me , as it ought to have done before , into a better condition . For I saw very well that I could not have been intended to die , or I should never have lived ; not to say should never have been reserved for such a happy life . I saw very well how many things had worked together for my welfare , and that if the sins of the fathers were sometimes visited upon the children , the phrase did not mean what I had in the morning feared it meant . I knew I was as innocent of my birth as a queen of hers and that before my Heavenly Father I should not be punished for birth nor a queen rewarded for it . I had had experience , in the shock of that very day , that I could , even thus soon , find comforting reconcilements to the change that had fallen on me . I renewed my resolutions and prayed to be strengthened in them , pouring out my heart for myself and for my unhappy mother and feeling that the darkness of the morning was passing away . It was not upon my sleep ; and when the next day 's light awoke me , it was gone . My dear girl was to arrive at five o'clock in the afternoon . How to help myself through the intermediate time better than by taking a long walk along the road by which she was to come , I did not know ; so Charley and I and Stubbs - Stubbs saddled , for we never drove him after the one great occasion - made a long expedition along that road and back . On our return , we held a great review of the house and garden and saw that everything was in its prettiest condition , and had the bird out ready as an important part of the establishment . There were more than two full hours yet to elapse before she could come , and in that interval , which seemed a long one , I must confess I was nervously anxious about my altered looks . I loved my darling so well that I was more concerned for their effect on her than on any one . I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined - I am quite certain I did not , that day - but , I thought , would she be wholly prepared ? When she first saw me , might she not be a little shocked and disappointed ? Might it not prove a little worse than she expected ? Might she not look for her old Esther and not find her ? Might she not have to grow used to me and to begin all over again ? I knew the various expressions of my sweet girl 's face so well , and it was such an honest face in its loveliness , that I was sure beforehand she could not hide that first look from me . And I considered whether , if it should signify any one of these meanings , which was so very likely , could I quite answer for myself ? Well , I thought I could . After last night , I thought I could . But to wait and wait , and expect and expect , and think and think , was such bad preparation that I resolved to go along the road again and meet her . So I said to Charley , "
254995	255181	254981	254981	I	0	" Charley highly approving of anything that pleased me , I went and left her at home . But before I got to the second milestone , I had been in so many palpitations from seeing dust in the distance though I knew it was not , and could not , be the coach yet that I resolved to turn back and go home again . And when I had turned , I was in such fear of the coach coming up behind me though I still knew that it neither would , nor could , do any such thing that I ran the greater part of the way to avoid being overtaken . Then , I considered , when I had got safe back again , this was a nice thing to have done ! Now I was hot and had made the worst of it instead of the best . At last , when I believed there was at least a quarter of an hour more yet , Charley all at once cried out to me as I was trembling in the garden , "
255192	255232	255189	255189	she	6062	" I did not mean to do it , but I ran upstairs into my room and hid myself behind the door . There I stood trembling , even when I heard my darling calling as she came upstairs , "
255252	255814	255245	255246	Little woman	1937	" She ran in , and was running out again when she saw me . Ah , my angel girl ! The old dear look , all love , all fondness , all affection . Nothing else in it - no , nothing , nothing ! Oh , how happy I was , down upon the floor , with my sweet beautiful girl down upon the floor too , holding my scarred face to her lovely cheek , bathing it with tears and kisses , rocking me to and fro like a child , calling me by every tender name that she could think of , and pressing me to her faithful heart . CHAPTER XXXVII Jarndyce and Jarndyce If the secret I had to keep had been mine , I must have confided it to Ada before we had been long together . But it was not mine , and I did not feel that I had a right to tell it , even to my guardian , unless some great emergency arose . It was a weight to bear alone ; still my present duty appeared to be plain , and blest in the attachment of my dear , I did not want an impulse and encouragement to do it . Though often when she was asleep and all was quiet , the remembrance of my mother kept me waking and made the night sorrowful , I did not yield to it at another time ; and Ada found me what I used to be - except , of course , in that particular of which I have said enough and which I have no intention of mentioning any more just now , if I can help it . The difficulty that I felt in being quite composed that first evening when Ada asked me , over our work , if the family were at the house , and when I was obliged to answer yes , I believed so , for Lady Dedlock had spoken to me in the woods the day before yesterday , was great . Greater still when Ada asked me what she had said , and when I replied that she had been kind and interested , and when Ada , while admitting her beauty and elegance , remarked upon her proud manner and her imperious chilling air . But Charley helped me through , unconsciously , by telling us that Lady Dedlock had only stayed at the house two nights on her way from London to visit at some other great house in the next county and that she had left early on the morning after we had seen her at our view , as we called it . Charley verified the adage about little pitchers , I am sure , for she heard of more sayings and doings in a day than would have come to my ears in a month . We were to stay a month at Mr. Boythorn 's . My pet had scarcely been there a bright week , as I recollect the time , when one evening after we had finished helping the gardener in watering his flowers , and just as the candles were lighted , Charley , appearing with a very important air behind Ada 's chair , beckoned me mysteriously out of the room . "
255823	255839	255818	255818	you	6067	" said Charley in a whisper , with her eyes at their roundest and largest . "

256043	256057	256040	256041	W. Grubble	601	" which Charley delivered as if she were slowly spelling out the sign . "
256065	256066	256069	256069	miss	9656	" "
256123	256473	256111	256111	they	6090	" said Charley . Not knowing what might be the matter , and being easily apprehensive now , I thought it best to go to this place by myself . I bade Charley be quick with my bonnet and veil and my shawl , and having put them on , went away down the little hilly street , where I was as much at home as in Mr. Boythorn 's garden . Mr. Grubble was standing in his shirt - sleeves at the door of his very clean little tavern waiting for me . He lifted off his hat with both hands when he saw me coming , and carrying it so , as if it were an iron vessel it looked as heavy , preceded me along the sanded passage to his best parlour , a neat carpeted room with more plants in it than were quite convenient , a coloured print of Queen Caroline , several shells , a good many tea - trays , two stuffed and dried fish in glass cases , and either a curious egg or a curious pumpkin but I do n't know which , and I doubt if many people did hanging from his ceiling . I knew Mr. Grubble very well by sight , from his often standing at his door . A pleasant - looking , stoutish , middle - aged man who never seemed to consider himself cozily dressed for his own fire - side without his hat and top - boots , but who never wore a coat except at church . He snuffed the candle , and backing away a little to see how it looked , backed out of the room - unexpectedly to me , for I was going to ask him by whom he had been sent . The door of the opposite parlour being then opened , I heard some voices , familiar in my ears I thought , which stopped . A quick light step approached the room in which I was , and who should stand before me but Richard ! "
256478	256482	256476	256476	Esther	283	" he said . "
256487	256522	256476	256476	Esther	283	" And he really was so warm - hearted and earnest that in the first surprise and pleasure of his brotherly greeting I could scarcely find breath to tell him that Ada was well . "
256534	256559	256476	256476	Esther	283	" said Richard , leading me to a chair and seating himself beside me . I put my veil up , but not quite . "
256566	256637	256561	256564	the same dear girl	6093	" said Richard just as heartily as before . I put up my veil altogether , and laying my hand on Richard 's sleeve and looking in his face , told him how much I thanked him for his kind welcome and how greatly I rejoiced to see him , the more so because of the determination I had made in my illness , which I now conveyed to him . "
256641	256645	256561	256564	the same dear girl	6093	" said Richard , "
256670	256671	256665	256665	you	9686	" "
256679	256687	256675	256675	you	0	" said I , shaking my head , "
256694	256695	256673	256673	I	0	" "
256705	256709	256697	256697	you	295	" said Richard , "

256774	256790	256771	256772	Mr. Anybody	603	" I was pained to find him taking this tone , and he observed it . "
256798	256802	256771	256772	Mr. Anybody	603	" said Richard , "
256848	256849	256850	256850	My	0	" "

256899	256913	256882	256882	you	295	" cried Richard gaily . I asked him how he liked his profession . "
256922	256926	256882	256882	you	295	" said Richard . "
256979	257018	257019	257019	I	0	" So young and handsome , and in all respects so perfectly the opposite of Miss Flite ! And yet , in the clouded , eager , seeking look that passed over him , so dreadfully like her ! "
257028	257032	257019	257019	I	0	" said Richard . "
257035	257036	257019	257019	I	0	" "

257083	257092	257079	257079	I	0	" No wonder that I shook my head ! "
257104	257117	257079	257079	I	0	" Richard spoke with the same shade crossing his face as before . "
257142	257143	257136	257136	you	0	" "
257153	257154	257146	257147	Mr. Skimpole	326	" "
257175	257261	257169	257171	a fascinating child	6114	" I asked Richard if any one knew of their coming down together . He answered , no , nobody . He had been to call upon the dear old infant - so he called Mr. Skimpole - and the dear old infant had told him where we were , and he had told the dear old infant he was bent on coming to see us , and the dear old infant had directly wanted to come too ; and so he had brought him . "
257281	257285	257286	257286	He	6115	" said Richard . "
257304	257457	257458	257458	My	0	" I certainly did not see the proof of Mr. Skimpole 's worldliness in his having his expenses paid by Richard , but I made no remark about that . Indeed , he came in and turned our conversation . He was charmed to see me , said he had been shedding delicious tears of joy and sympathy at intervals for six weeks on my account , had never been so happy as in hearing of my progress , began to understand the mixture of good and evil in the world now , felt that he appreciated health the more when somebody else was ill , did n't know but what it might be in the scheme of things that A should squint to make B happier in looking straight or that C should carry a wooden leg to make D better satisfied with his flesh and blood in a silk stocking . "
257469	257474	257467	257467	Richard	295	" said Mr. Skimpole , "
257692	257867	257868	257868	Ada	294	" I began seriously to think that Richard could scarcely have found a worse friend than this . It made me uneasy that at such a time when he most required some right principle and purpose he should have this captivating looseness and putting - off of everything , this airy dispensing with all principle and purpose , at his elbow . I thought I could understand how such a nature as my guardian 's , experienced in the world and forced to contemplate the miserable evasions and contentions of the family misfortune , found an immense relief in Mr. Skimpole 's avowal of his weaknesses and display of guileless candour ; but I could not satisfy myself that it was as artless as it seemed or that it did not serve Mr. Skimpole 's idle turn quite as well as any other part , and with less trouble . They both walked back with me , and Mr. Skimpole leaving us at the gate , I walked softly in with Richard and said , "
257882	258252	257876	257877	a gentleman	2578	" It was not difficult to read the blushing , startled face . She loved him dearly , and he knew it , and I knew it . It was a very transparent business , that meeting as cousins only . I almost mistrusted myself as growing quite wicked in my suspicions , but I was not so sure that Richard loved her dearly . He admired her very much - any one must have done that - and I dare say would have renewed their youthful engagement with great pride and ardour but that he knew how she would respect her promise to my guardian . Still I had a tormenting idea that the influence upon him extended even here , that he was postponing his best truth and earnestness in this as in all things until Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be off his mind . Ah me ! What Richard would have been without that blight , I never shall know now ! He told Ada , in his most ingenuous way , that he had not come to make any secret inroad on the terms she had accepted rather too implicitly and confidingly , he thought from Mr. Jarndyce , that he had come openly to see her and to see me and to justify himself for the present terms on which he stood with Mr. Jarndyce . As the dear old infant would be with us directly , he begged that I would make an appointment for the morning , when he might set himself right through the means of an unreserved conversation with me . I proposed to walk with him in the park at seven o'clock , and this was arranged . Mr. Skimpole soon afterwards appeared and made us merry for an hour . He particularly requested to see little Coavinses meaning Charley and told her , with a patriarchal air , that he had given her late father all the business in his power and that if one of her little brothers would make haste to get set up in the same profession , he hoped he should still be able to put a good deal of employment in his way . "
258263	258282	258254	258254	I	0	" said Mr. Skimpole , looking beamingly at us over a glass of wine - and - water , "
258380	258499	258378	258378	him	843	" Richard was a little late in the morning , but I had not to wait for him long , and we turned into the park . The air was bright and dewy and the sky without a cloud . The birds sang delightfully ; the sparkles in the fern , the grass , and trees , were exquisite to see ; the richness of the woods seemed to have increased twenty - fold since yesterday , as if , in the still night when they had looked so massively hushed in sleep , Nature , through all the minute details of every wonderful leaf , had been more wakeful than usual for the glory of that day . "
258506	258513	258378	258378	him	843	" said Richard , looking round . "

258990	259021	259022	259022	Esther	283	" He reddened deeply , as if his natural generosity felt a pang of reproach . He was silent for a little while before he replied in a subdued voice , "

259449	259453	259447	259447	Esther	283	" Richard resumed , "
259639	259670	259634	259634	I	0	" Poor dear Richard ! He had indeed been thinking about it a good deal . His face , his voice , his manner , all showed that too plainly . "

261102	261103	261104	261106	My dear child	2713	" "
261175	261184	261168	261168	your	2713	" said Richard , quite amused with me , "
261199	262020	261191	261191	I	0	" I felt so deeply sensible of the danger in which he stood that I tried , in Ada 's name , in my guardian 's , in my own , by every fervent means that I could think of , to warn him of it and to show him some of his mistakes . He received everything I said with patience and gentleness , but it all rebounded from him without taking the least effect . I could not wonder at this after the reception his preoccupied mind had given to my guardian 's letter , but I determined to try Ada 's influence yet . So when our walk brought us round to the village again , and I went home to breakfast , I prepared Ada for the account I was going to give her and told her exactly what reason we had to dread that Richard was losing himself and scattering his whole life to the winds . It made her very unhappy , of course , though she had a far , far greater reliance on his correcting his errors than I could have - which was so natural and loving in my dear ! - and she presently wrote him this little letter : My dearest cousin , Esther has told me all you said to her this morning . I write this to repeat most earnestly for myself all that she said to you and to let you know how sure I am that you will sooner or later find our cousin John a pattern of truth , sincerity , and goodness , when you will deeply , deeply grieve to have done him without intending it so much wrong . I do not quite know how to write what I wish to say next , but I trust you will understand it as I mean it . I have some fears , my dearest cousin , that it may be partly for my sake you are now laying up so much unhappiness for yourself - and if for yourself , for me . In case this should be so , or in case you should entertain much thought of me in what you are doing , I most earnestly entreat and beg you to desist . You can do nothing for my sake that will make me half so happy as for ever turning your back upon the shadow in which we both were born . Do not be angry with me for saying this . Pray , pray , dear Richard , for my sake , and for your own , and in a natural repugnance for that source of trouble which had its share in making us both orphans when we were very young , pray , pray , let it go for ever . We have reason to know by this time that there is no good in it and no hope , that there is nothing to be got from it but sorrow . My dearest cousin , it is needless for me to say that you are quite free and that it is very likely you may find some one whom you will love much better than your first fancy . I am quite sure , if you will let me say so , that the object of your choice would greatly prefer to follow your fortunes far and wide , however moderate or poor , and see you happy , doing your duty and pursuing your chosen way , than to have the hope of being , or even to be , very rich with you if such a thing were possible at the cost of dragging years of procrastination and anxiety and of your indifference to other aims . You may wonder at my saying this so confidently with so little knowledge or experience , but I know it for a certainty from my own heart . Ever , my dearest cousin , your most affectionate Ada This note brought Richard to us very soon , but it made little change in him if any . We would fairly try , he said , who was right and who was wrong - he would show us - we should see ! He was animated and glowing , as if Ada 's tenderness had gratified him ; but I could only hope , with a sigh , that the letter might have some stronger effect upon his mind on re - perusal than it assuredly had then . As they were to remain with us that day and had taken their places to return by the coach next morning , I sought an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Skimpole . Our out - of - door life easily threw one in my way , and I delicately said that there was a responsibility in encouraging Richard . "
262028	262041	262025	262026	Miss Summerson	283	" he repeated , catching at the word with the pleasantest smile . "

262079	262095	262070	262070	I	0	" said I timidly enough , he being so much older and more clever than I. "
262100	262117	262070	262070	I	0	" said Mr. Skimpole , receiving this new light with a most agreeable jocularity of surprise . "
262143	262157	262140	262141	Miss Summerson	283	" he took a handful of loose silver and halfpence from his pocket , "
262251	262306	262247	262247	I	0	" The perfect ease of manner with which he put the money up again and looked at me with a smile on his refined face , as if he had been mentioning a curious little fact about somebody else , almost made me feel as if he really had nothing to do with it . "
262314	262318	262310	262310	you	6210	" he resumed , "
262406	262448	262384	262384	I	0	" It was difficult , after this , to explain what I meant ; but I persisted so far as to say that we all hoped he would check and not confirm Richard in the sanguine views he entertained just then . "
262452	262456	262384	262384	I	0	" he retorted , "
262532	262543	262545	262545	you	283	" It was very unfortunate for Richard , I said . "
262549	262554	262545	262545	you	283	" returned Mr. Skimpole . "
262802	263000	263017	263017	their	6223	" It was idle to say more , so I proposed that we should join Ada and Richard , who were a little in advance , and I gave up Mr. Skimpole in despair . He had been over the Hall in the course of the morning and whimsically described the family pictures as we walked . There were such portentous shepherdesses among the Ladies Dedlock dead and gone , he told us , that peaceful crooks became weapons of assault in their hands . They tended their flocks severely in buckram and powder and put their sticking - plaster patches on to terrify commoners as the chiefs of some other tribes put on their war - paint . There was a Sir Somebody Dedlock , with a battle , a sprung - mine , volumes of smoke , flashes of lightning , a town on fire , and a stormed fort , all in full action between his horse 's two hind legs , showing , he supposed , how little a Dedlock made of such trifles . The whole race he represented as having evidently been , in life , what he called ' stuffed people "
263080	263084	263086	263087	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Dear me ! "
263089	263092	263086	263087	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Vholes ! "
263104	263110	263112	263113	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Friend and legal adviser , "
263115	263149	263112	263113	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Now , my dear Miss Summerson , if you want common sense , responsibility , and respectability , all united - if you want an exemplary man - Vholes is THE man . "
263169	263177	263179	263180	Mr. Skimpole	326	" When he emerged from legal infancy , "
263182	263214	263179	263180	Mr. Skimpole	326	" he parted from our conversational friend Kenge and took up , I believe , with Vholes . Indeed , I know he did , because I introduced him to Vholes . "
263215	263222	263224	263224	Ada	294	" Had you known him long ? "
263226	263369	263370	263370	he	6228	" Vholes ? My dear Miss Clare , I had had that kind of acquaintance with him which I have had with several gentlemen of his profession . He had done something or other in a very agreeable , civil manner - taken proceedings , I think , is the expression - which ended in the proceeding of his taking ME . Somebody was so good as to step in and pay the money - something and fourpence was the amount ; I forget the pounds and shillings , but I know it ended with fourpence , because it struck me at the time as being so odd that I could owe anybody fourpence - and after that I brought them together . Vholes asked me for the introduction , and I gave it . Now I come to think of it , "
263385	263425	263370	263370	he	6228	" Vholes bribed me , perhaps ? He gave me something and called it commission . Was it a five - pound note ? Do you know , I think it MUST have been a five - pound note ! "
263530	263541	263551	263551	he	248	" I hope I do n't disturb you , ladies , "
263562	263628	263551	263551	he	248	" I arranged with Mr. Carstone that he should always know when his cause was in the Chancellor 's paper , and being informed by one of my clerks last night after post time that it stood , rather unexpectedly , in the paper for to - morrow , I put myself into the coach early this morning and came down to confer with him . "
263629	263632	263634	263634	Richard	295	" Yes , "
263646	263695	263634	263634	Richard	295	" we do n't do these things in the old slow way now . We spin along now ! Mr. Vholes , we must hire something to get over to the post town in , and catch the mail to - night , and go up by it ! "
263696	263703	263705	263706	Mr. Vholes	248	" Anything you please , sir , "
263708	263716	263705	263706	Mr. Vholes	248	" I am quite at your service . "
263717	263722	263724	263724	Richard	295	" Let me see , "
263731	263796	263724	263724	Richard	295	" If I run down to the Dedlock , and get my portmanteau fastened up , and order a gig , or a chaise , or whatever 's to be got , we shall have an hour then before starting . I 'll come back to tea . Cousin Ada , will you and Esther take care of Mr. Vholes when I am gone ? "
263828	263841	263843	263843	I.	6235	" Is Mr. Carstone 's presence necessary to - morrow , Sir ? "
263844	263851	263843	263843	I.	6235	" Can it do any good ? "
263852	263857	263858	263859	Mr. Vholes	248	" No , miss , "
263862	263871	263858	263859	Mr. Vholes	248	" I am not aware that it can . "
263891	263905	263907	263908	Mr. Vholes	248	" Mr. Carstone has laid down the principle of watching his own interests , "
263910	263990	263907	263908	Mr. Vholes	248	" and when a client lays down his own principle , and it is not immoral , it devolves upon me to carry it out . I wish in business to be exact and open . I am a widower with three daughters - Emma , Jane , and Caroline - and my desire is so to discharge the duties of life as to leave them a good name . This appears to be a pleasant spot , miss . "
264016	264019	264021	264022	Mr. Vholes	248	" Indeed ? "
264024	264063	264021	264022	Mr. Vholes	248	" I have the privilege of supporting an aged father in the Vale of Taunton - his native place - and I admire that country very much . I had no idea there was anything so attractive here . "
264085	264090	264092	264092	he	248	" There , miss , "
264094	264228	264092	264092	he	248	" you touch me on a tender string . My health is not good my digestion being much impaired , and if I had only myself to consider , I should take refuge in rural habits , especially as the cares of business have prevented me from ever coming much into contact with general society , and particularly with ladies ' society , which I have most wished to mix in . But with my three daughters , Emma , Jane , and Caroline - and my aged father - I can not afford to be selfish . It is true I have no longer to maintain a dear grandmother who died in her hundred and second year , but enough remains to render it indispensable that the mill should be always going . "
264247	264257	264258	264258	he	6238	" You will excuse my having mentioned my daughters , "
264261	264286	264258	264258	he	6238	" They are my weak point . I wish to leave the poor girls some little independence , as well as a good name . "
264351	264383	264332	264333	Mr. Vholes	248	" You will drive me , will you , sir ? It is all the same to me , sir . Anything you please . I am quite at your service . "
264846	264856	264858	264858	I	0	" Once more , duty , duty , Esther , "
264860	264900	264858	264858	I	0	" and if you are not overjoyed to do it , more than cheerfully and contentedly , through anything and everything , you ought to be . That 's all I have to say to you , my dear ! "
265274	265283	265285	265285	I.	0	" And how is your mama , Caddy ? "
265286	265296	265298	265298	Caddy	304	" Why , I hear of her , Esther , "
265300	265349	265298	265298	Caddy	304	" through Pa , but I see very little of her . We are good friends , I am glad to say , but Ma thinks there is something absurd in my having married a dancing- master , and she is rather afraid of its extending to her . "
265401	265408	265395	265395	I	0	" And your papa , Caddy ? "
265409	265416	265418	265418	Caddy	304	" He comes here every evening , "
265420	265440	265418	265418	Caddy	304	" and is so fond of sitting in the corner there that it 's a treat to see him . "
265477	265483	265485	265485	I	0	" And you , Caddy , "
265487	265498	265485	265485	I	0	" you are always busy , I 'll be bound ? "
265499	265505	265507	265507	Caddy	304	" Well , my dear , "
265509	265574	265507	265507	Caddy	304	" I am indeed , for to tell you a grand secret , I am qualifying myself to give lessons . Prince 's health is not strong , and I want to be able to assist him . What with schools , and classes here , and private pupils , AND the apprentices , he really has too much to do , poor fellow ! "
265597	265600	265602	265602	Caddy	304	" Four , "
265604	265670	265602	265602	Caddy	304	" One in - door , and three out . They are very good children ; only when they get together they WILL play - children - like - instead of attending to their work . So the little boy you saw just now waltzes by himself in the empty kitchen , and we distribute the others over the house as well as we can . "
265671	265682	265684	265684	I.	0	" That is only for their steps , of course ? "
265685	265691	265693	265693	Caddy	304	" Only for their steps , "
265695	265737	265693	265693	Caddy	304	" In that way they practise , so many hours at a time , whatever steps they happen to be upon . They dance in the academy , and at this time of year we do figures at five every morning . "
265738	265746	265747	265747	I	0	" Why , what a laborious life ! "
265750	265758	265747	265747	I	0	" I assure you , my dear , "
265764	265822	265760	265760	Caddy	304	" when the out- door apprentices ring us up in the morning the bell rings into our room , not to disturb old Mr. Turveydrop , and when I put up the window and see them standing on the door - step with their little pumps under their arms , I am actually reminded of the Sweeps . "
265856	265997	265839	265839	Caddy	304	" You see , my dear , to save expense I ought to know something of the piano , and I ought to know something of the kit too , and consequently I have to practise those two instruments as well as the details of our profession . If Ma had been like anybody else , I might have had some little musical knowledge to begin upon . However , I had n't any ; and that part of the work is , at first , a little discouraging , I must allow . But I have a very good ear , and I am used to drudgery - I have to thank Ma for that , at all events - and where there 's a will there 's a way , you know , Esther , the world over . "
266042	266057	266023	266023	she	304	" Do n't laugh at me , please ; that 's a dear girl ! "
266132	266136	266138	266138	Caddy	304	" My dear , "
266142	266211	266212	266212	Her	304	" you ca n't think how you cheer me . I shall owe you , you do n't know how much . What changes , Esther , even in my small world ! You recollect that first night , when I was so unpolite and inky ? Who would have thought , then , of my ever teaching people to dance , of all other possibilities and impossibilities ! "
266775	266780	266754	266754	her	6306	" Not with boys , "
266792	266800	266802	266802	Caddy	304	" Old Mr. Turveydrop is so sorry , "
266804	266835	266802	266802	Caddy	304	" that he has not finished dressing yet and can not have the pleasure of seeing you before you go . You are such a favourite of his , Esther . "
266860	266870	266872	266872	Caddy	304	" It takes him a long time to dress , "
266874	266927	266872	266872	Caddy	304	" because he is very much looked up to in such things , you know , and has a reputation to support . You ca n't think how kind he is to Pa. He talks to Pa of an evening about the Prince Regent , and I never saw Pa so interested . "
266960	266963	266965	266965	Caddy	304	" No , "
266967	267066	266965	266965	Caddy	304	" I do n't know that he does that , but he talks to Pa , and Pa greatly admires him , and listens , and likes it . Of course I am aware that Pa has hardly any claims to deportment , but they get on together delightfully . You ca n't think what good companions they make . I never saw Pa take snuff before in my life , but he takes one pinch out of Mr. Turveydrop 's box regularly and keeps putting it to his nose and taking it away again all the evening . "
267106	267111	267113	267113	Caddy	304	" As to Peepy , "
267119	267213	267215	267215	Caddy	304	" whom I was most afraid of - next to having any family of my own , Esther - as an inconvenience to Mr. Turveydrop , the kindness of the old gentleman to that child is beyond everything . He asks to see him , my dear ! He lets him take the newspaper up to him in bed ; he gives him the crusts of his toast to eat ; he sends him on little errands about the house ; he tells him to come to me for sixpences . In short , "
267218	267244	267215	267215	Caddy	304	" and not to prose , I am a very fortunate girl and ought to be very grateful . Where are we going , Esther ? "
267245	267252	267254	267254	I	0	" To the Old Street Road , "
267256	267312	267254	267254	I	0	" where I have a few words to say to the solicitor 's clerk who was sent to meet me at the coach- office on the very day when I came to London and first saw you , my dear . Now I think of it , the gentleman who brought us to your house . "
267313	267330	267332	267332	Caddy	304	" Then , indeed , I seem to be naturally the person to go with you , "
267517	267521	267523	267524	Mr. Guppy	301	" Miss Summerson , "
267528	267558	267523	267524	Mr. Guppy	301	" this is indeed an oasis . Mother , will you be so good as to put a chair for the other lady and get out of the gangway . "
267629	267642	267644	267644	I.	0	" I took the liberty of sending you a note , sir , "
267701	267712	267685	267685	her	6321	" Could I speak to you alone for a moment ? "
267801	267805	267807	267808	Mr. Guppy	301	" Miss Summerson , "
267810	267843	267807	267808	Mr. Guppy	301	" you will excuse the waywardness of a parent ever mindful of a son 's appiness . My mother , though highly exasperating to the feelings , is actuated by maternal dictates . "
267875	267889	267891	267891	I	0	" I asked the favour of seeing you for a few moments here , "
267893	267932	267891	267891	I	0	" in preference to calling at Mr. Kenge 's because , remembering what you said on an occasion when you spoke to me in confidence , I feared I might otherwise cause you some embarrassment , Mr. Guppy . "
267960	267964	267966	267967	Mr. Guppy	301	" Miss Summerson , "
267969	268018	267966	267967	Mr. Guppy	301	" I - I - beg your pardon , but in our profession - we - we - find it necessary to be explicit . You have referred to an occasion , miss , when I - when I did myself the honour of making a declaration which - "
268068	268081	268082	268082	he	301	" A kind of giddy sensation has come upon me , miss , "
268085	268110	268082	268082	he	301	" which rather knocks me over . I - er - a little subject to this sort of thing - er - by George ! "
268147	268156	268158	268159	Mr. Guppy	301	" My intention was to remark , miss , "
268161	268229	268158	268159	Mr. Guppy	301	" dear me - something bronchial , I think - hem ! - to remark that you was so good on that occasion as to repel and repudiate that declaration . You - you would n't perhaps object to admit that ? Though no witnesses are present , it might be a satisfaction to - to your mind - if you was to put in that admission . "
268230	268237	268239	268239	I	0	" There can be no doubt , "
268241	268257	268239	268239	I	0	" that I declined your proposal without any reservation or qualification whatever , Mr. Guppy . "
268258	268264	268265	268265	he	301	" Thank you , miss , "
268276	268356	268239	268239	I	0	" So far that 's satisfactory , and it does you credit . Er - this is certainly bronchial ! - must be in the tubes - er - you would n't perhaps be offended if I was to mention - not that it 's necessary , for your own good sense or any person 's sense must show 'em that - if I was to mention that such declaration on my part was final , and there terminated ? "
268357	268363	268365	268365	I.	0	" I quite understand that , "
268366	268400	268402	268403	Mr. Guppy	301	" Perhaps - er - it may not be worth the form , but it might be a satisfaction to your mind - perhaps you would n't object to admit that , miss ? "
268405	268414	268416	268416	I.	0	" I admit it most fully and freely , "
268417	268421	268423	268424	Mr. Guppy	301	" Thank you , "
268426	268493	268494	268495	Mr. Guppy	301	" Very honourable , I am sure . I regret that my arrangements in life , combined with circumstances over which I have no control , will put it out of my power ever to fall back upon that offer or to renew it in any shape or form whatever , but it will ever be a retrospect entwined - er - with friendship 's bowers . "
268510	268524	268525	268525	I	0	" I may now perhaps mention what I wished to say to you ? "
268528	268538	268540	268541	Mr. Guppy	301	" I shall be honoured , I am sure , "
268543	268591	268540	268541	Mr. Guppy	301	" I am so persuaded that your own good sense and right feeling , miss , will - will keep you as square as possible - that I can have nothing but pleasure , I am sure , in hearing any observations you may wish to offer . "
268592	268605	268614	268615	Mr. Guppy	301	" You were so good as to imply , on that occasion - "
268606	268612	268614	268615	Mr. Guppy	301	" Excuse me , miss , "
268617	268640	268614	268615	Mr. Guppy	301	" but we had better not travel out of the record into implication . I can not admit that I implied anything . "
268641	268648	268649	268649	I	0	" You said on that occasion , "
268652	268909	268649	268649	I	0	" that you might possibly have the means of advancing my interests and promoting my fortunes by making discoveries of which I should be the subject . I presume that you founded that belief upon your general knowledge of my being an orphan girl , indebted for everything to the benevolence of Mr. Jarndyce . Now , the beginning and the end of what I have come to beg of you is , Mr. Guppy , that you will have the kindness to relinquish all idea of so serving me . I have thought of this sometimes , and I have thought of it most lately - since I have been ill . At length I have decided , in case you should at any time recall that purpose and act upon it in any way , to come to you and assure you that you are altogether mistaken . You could make no discovery in reference to me that would do me the least service or give me the least pleasure . I am acquainted with my personal history , and I have it in my power to assure you that you never can advance my welfare by such means . You may , perhaps , have abandoned this project a long time . If so , excuse my giving you unnecessary trouble . If not , I entreat you , on the assurance I have given you , henceforth to lay it aside . I beg you to do this , for my peace . "
268910	268917	268919	268920	Mr. Guppy	301	" I am bound to confess , "
268922	269013	268919	268920	Mr. Guppy	301	" that you express yourself , miss , with that good sense and right feeling for which I gave you credit . Nothing can be more satisfactory than such right feeling , and if I mistook any intentions on your part just now , I am prepared to tender a full apology . I should wish to be understood , miss , as hereby offering that apology - limiting it , as your own good sense and right feeling will point out the necessity of , to the present proceedings . "
269051	269076	269077	269077	I	0	" If you will allow me to finish what I have to say at once so that I may have no occasion to resume , "
269087	269201	269077	269077	I	0	" you will do me a kindness , sir . I come to you as privately as possible because you announced this impression of yours to me in a confidence which I have really wished to respect - and which I always have respected , as you remember . I have mentioned my illness . There really is no reason why I should hesitate to say that I know very well that any little delicacy I might have had in making a request to you is quite removed . Therefore I make the entreaty I have now preferred , and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me to accede to it . "
269238	269313	269315	269316	Mr. Guppy	301	" Upon my word and honour , upon my life , upon my soul , Miss Summerson , as I am a living man , I 'll act according to your wish ! I 'll never go another step in opposition to it . I 'll take my oath to it if it will be any satisfaction to you . In what I promise at this present time touching the matters now in question , "
269330	269348	269321	269321	he	301	" I speak the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so - "
269349	269355	269357	269357	I	0	" I am quite satisfied , "
269364	269381	269357	269357	I	0	" and I thank you very much . Caddy , my dear , I am ready ! "
269470	269486	269443	269443	he	301	" Miss Summerson , upon my honour and soul , you may depend upon me ! "
269487	269491	269493	269493	I	0	" I do , "
269495	269499	269493	269493	I	0	" quite confidently . "
269500	269508	269510	269511	Mr. Guppy	301	" I beg your pardon , miss , "
269523	269558	269443	269443	he	301	" but this lady being present - your own witness - it might be a satisfaction to your mind which I should wish to set at rest if you was to repeat those admissions . "
269559	269564	269566	269566	I	0	" Well , Caddy , "
269572	269595	269566	269566	I	0	" perhaps you will not be surprised when I tell you , my dear , that there never has been any engagement - "
269596	269605	269607	269608	Mr. Guppy	301	" No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever , "

269649	269673	269646	269646	he	301	" Between this gentleman , Mr. William Guppy , of Penton Place , Pentonville , in the county of Middlesex , and myself . "
269674	269680	269682	269683	Mr. Guppy	301	" Thank you , miss , "
269685	269703	269682	269683	Mr. Guppy	301	" Very full - er - excuse me - lady 's name , Christian and surname both ? "
269708	269715	269717	269718	Mr. Guppy	301	" Married woman , I believe ? "
269720	269760	269717	269718	Mr. Guppy	301	" Married woman . Thank you . Formerly Caroline Jellyby , spinster , then of Thavies Inn , within the city of London , but extra - parochial ; now of Newman Street , Oxford Street . Much obliged . "
269770	269814	269816	269817	Mr. Guppy	301	" Touching that matter , you know , I really and truly am very sorry that my arrangements in life , combined with circumstances over which I have no control , should prevent a renewal of what was wholly terminated some time back , "
269824	269845	269816	269817	Mr. Guppy	301	" but it could n't be . Now COULD it , you know ! I only put it to you . "
269877	269891	269893	269894	Mr. Guppy	301	" It 's very honourable of you , miss , I am sure , "
269896	269931	269893	269894	Mr. Guppy	301	" If an altar could be erected in the bowers of friendship - but , upon my soul , you may rely upon me in every respect save and except the tender passion only ! "
270635	270644	270646	270647	Mr. Kenge	286	" Repeal this statute , my good sir ? "
270653	270810	270646	270647	Mr. Kenge	286	" Repeal it , my dear sir ? Never , with my consent . Alter this law , sir , and what will be the effect of your rash proceeding on a class of practitioners very worthily represented , allow me to say to you , by the opposite attorney in the case , Mr. Vholes ? Sir , that class of practitioners would be swept from the face of the earth . Now you can not afford - I will say , the social system can not afford - to lose an order of men like Mr. Vholes . Diligent , persevering , steady , acute in business . My dear sir , I understand your present feelings against the existing state of things , which I grant to be a little hard in your case ; but I can never raise my voice for the demolition of a class of men like Mr. Vholes . "
270840	270990	270646	270647	Mr. Kenge	286	" Question number five hundred and seventeen thousand eight hundred and sixty - nine : If I understand you , these forms of practice indisputably occasion delay ? Answer : Yes , some delay . Question : And great expense ? Answer : Most assuredly they can not be gone through for nothing . Question : And unspeakable vexation ? Answer : I am not prepared to say that . They have never given ME any vexation ; quite the contrary . Question : But you think that their abolition would damage a class of practitioners ? Answer : I have no doubt of it . Question : Can you instance any type of that class ? Answer : Yes . I would unhesitatingly mention Mr. Vholes . He would be ruined . Question : Mr. Vholes is considered , in the profession , a respectable man ? Answer : "
271002	271017	270646	270647	Mr. Kenge	286	" Mr. Vholes is considered , in the profession , a MOST respectable man . "
271275	271277	271324	271325	Mr. Vholes	248	" up "
271427	271432	271434	271434	Richard	295	" Again nothing done ! "
271436	271442	271434	271434	Richard	295	" Nothing , nothing done ! "
271443	271452	271454	271456	the placid Vholes	248	" Do n't say nothing done , sir , "
271458	271469	271454	271456	the placid Vholes	248	" That is scarcely fair , sir , scarcely fair ! "
271470	271477	271479	271479	Richard	295	" Why , what IS done ? "
271486	271495	271479	271479	Richard	295	" That may not be the whole question , "
271499	271514	271497	271497	Vholes	248	" The question may branch off into what is doing , what is doing ? "
271515	271521	271523	271525	the moody client	6395	" And what is doing ? "
271573	271601	271626	271628	the young man	10205	" A good deal is doing , sir . We have put our shoulders to the wheel , Mr. Carstone , and the wheel is going round . "
271602	271624	271626	271628	the young man	10205	" Yes , with Ixion on it . How am I to get through the next four or five accursed months ? "
271640	271644	271646	271646	Vholes	248	" Mr. C. , "
271658	271711	271646	271646	Vholes	248	" your spirits are hasty , and I am sorry for it on your account . Excuse me if I recommend you not to chafe so much , not to be so impetuous , not to wear yourself out so . You should have more patience . You should sustain yourself better . "
271712	271725	271727	271727	Richard	295	" I ought to imitate you , in fact , Mr. Vholes ? "
271750	271753	271755	271755	Vholes	248	" Sir , "
271783	271786	271790	271790	his	248	" Sir , "
271800	271903	271790	271790	his	248	" I should not have had the presumption to propose myself as a model for your imitation or any man 's . Let me but leave the good name to my three daughters , and that is enough for me ; I am not a self - seeker . But since you mention me so pointedly , I will acknowledge that I should like to impart to you a little of my - come , sir , you are disposed to call it insensibility , and I am sure I have no objection - say insensibility - a little of my insensibility . "
271904	271908	271910	271911	the client	5788	" Mr. Vholes , "
271916	271927	271910	271911	the client	5788	" I had no intention to accuse you of insensibility . "
271928	271940	271942	271944	the equable Vholes	248	" I think you had , sir , without knowing it , "
271946	272107	272108	272109	Mr. Vholes	248	" Very naturally . It is my duty to attend to your interests with a cool head , and I can quite understand that to your excited feelings I may appear , at such times as the present , insensible . My daughters may know me better ; my aged father may know me better . But they have known me much longer than you have , and the confiding eye of affection is not the distrustful eye of business . Not that I complain , sir , of the eye of business being distrustful ; quite the contrary . In attending to your interests , I wish to have all possible checks upon me ; it is right that I should have them ; I court inquiry . But your interests demand that I should be cool and methodical , Mr. Carstone ; and I can not be otherwise - no , sir , not even to please you . "
272165	272327	272138	272138	his	248	" What are you to do , sir , you inquire , during the vacation . I should hope you gentlemen of the army may find many means of amusing yourselves if you give your minds to it . If you had asked me what I was to do during the vacation , I could have answered you more readily . I am to attend to your interests . I am to be found here , day by day , attending to your interests . That is my duty , Mr. C. , and term - time or vacation makes no difference to me . If you wish to consult me as to your interests , you will find me here at all times alike . Other professional men go out of town . I do n't . Not that I blame them for going ; I merely say I do n't go . This desk is your rock , sir ! "
272366	272375	272377	272377	Richard	295	" I am perfectly aware , Mr. Vholes , "
272386	272488	272377	272377	Richard	295	" that you are the most reliable fellow in the world and that to have to do with you is to have to do with a man of business who is not to be hoodwinked . But put yourself in my case , dragging on this dislocated life , sinking deeper and deeper into difficulty every day , continually hoping and continually disappointed , conscious of change upon change for the worse in myself , and of no change for the better in anything else , and you will find it a dark - looking case sometimes , as I do . "
272489	272493	272495	272496	Mr. Vholes	248	" You know , "
272498	272593	272495	272496	Mr. Vholes	248	" that I never give hopes , sir . I told you from the first , Mr. C. , that I never give hopes . Particularly in a case like this , where the greater part of the costs comes out of the estate , I should not be considerate of my good name if I gave hopes . It might seem as if costs were my object . Still , when you say there is no change for the better , I must , as a bare matter of fact , deny that . "
272594	272597	272599	272599	Richard	295	" Aye ? "
272603	272612	272599	272599	Richard	295	" But how do you make it out ? "
272613	272622	272377	272377	Richard	295	" Mr. Carstone , you are represented by - "
272623	272632	272599	272599	Richard	295	" You said just now - a rock . "
272633	272638	272640	272641	Mr. Vholes	248	" Yes , sir , "
272669	272758	272759	272759	Richard	295	" a rock . That 's something . You are separately represented , and no longer hidden and lost in the interests of others . THAT 'S something . The suit does not sleep ; we wake it up , we air it , we walk it about . THAT 'S something . It 's not all Jarndyce , in fact as well as in name . THAT 'S something . Nobody has it all his own way now , sir . And THAT 'S something , surely . "
272774	272912	272759	272759	Richard	295	" Mr. Vholes ! If any man had told me when I first went to John Jarndyce 's house that he was anything but the disinterested friend he seemed - that he was what he has gradually turned out to be - I could have found no words strong enough to repel the slander ; I could not have defended him too ardently . So little did I know of the world ! Whereas now I do declare to you that he becomes to me the embodiment of the suit ; that in place of its being an abstraction , it is John Jarndyce ; that the more I suffer , the more indignant I am with him ; that every new delay and every new disappointment is only a new injury from John Jarndyce 's hand . "
272913	272918	272920	272920	Vholes	248	" No , no , "
272922	272950	272920	272920	Vholes	248	" Do n't say so . We ought to have patience , all of us . Besides , I never disparage , sir . I never disparage . "
272951	272955	272957	272959	the angry client	6403	" Mr. Vholes , "
272961	272979	272957	272959	the angry client	6403	" You know as well as I that he would have strangled the suit if he could . "
272980	272988	272989	272990	Mr. Vholes	248	" He was not active in it , "
272998	273029	272989	272990	Mr. Vholes	248	" He certainly was not active in it . But however , but however , he might have had amiable intentions . Who can read the heart , Mr. C. ! "
273030	273034	273036	273036	Richard	295	" You can , "
273038	273044	273036	273036	Richard	295	" I , Mr. C. ? "
273045	273069	273071	273071	Richard	295	" Well enough to know what his intentions were . Are or are not our interests conflicting ? Tell - me - that ! "
273087	273091	273093	273093	Vholes	248	" Mr. C. , "
273105	273221	273093	273093	Vholes	248	" I should be wanting in my duty as your professional adviser , I should be departing from my fidelity to your interests , if I represented those interests as identical with the interests of Mr. Jarndyce . They are no such thing , sir . I never impute motives ; I both have and am a father , and I never impute motives . But I must not shrink from a professional duty , even if it sows dissensions in families . I understand you to be now consulting me professionally as to your interests ? You are so ? I reply , then , they are not identical with those of Mr. Jarndyce . "
273222	273229	273231	273231	Richard	295	" Of course they are not ! "
273233	273241	273231	273231	Richard	295	" You found that out long ago . "
273242	273246	273248	273248	Vholes	248	" Mr. C. , "
273250	273552	273554	273555	Mr. Vholes	248	" I wish to say no more of any third party than is necessary . I wish to leave my good name unsullied , together with any little property of which I may become possessed through industry and perseverance , to my daughters Emma , Jane , and Caroline . I also desire to live in amity with my professional brethren . When Mr. Skimpole did me the honour , sir - I will not say the very high honour , for I never stoop to flattery - of bringing us together in this room , I mentioned to you that I could offer no opinion or advice as to your interests while those interests were entrusted to another member of the profession . And I spoke in such terms as I was bound to speak of Kenge and Carboy 's office , which stands high . You , sir , thought fit to withdraw your interests from that keeping nevertheless and to offer them to me . You brought them with clean hands , sir , and I accepted them with clean hands . Those interests are now paramount in this office . My digestive functions , as you may have heard me mention , are not in a good state , and rest might improve them ; but I shall not rest , sir , while I am your representative . Whenever you want me , you will find me here . Summon me anywhere , and I will come . During the long vacation , sir , I shall devote my leisure to studying your interests more and more closely and to making arrangements for moving heaven and earth including , of course , the Chancellor after Michaelmas term ; and when I ultimately congratulate you , sir , "
273564	273684	273685	273685	Vholes	248	" when I ultimately congratulate you , sir , with all my heart , on your accession to fortune - which , but that I never give hopes , I might say something further about - you will owe me nothing beyond whatever little balance may be then outstanding of the costs as between solicitor and client not included in the taxed costs allowed out of the estate . I pretend to no claim upon you , Mr. C. , but for the zealous and active discharge - not the languid and routine discharge , sir : that much credit I stipulate for - of my professional duty . My duty prosperously ended , all between us is ended . "
273729	273744	273746	273746	Vholes	248	" For there have been many little consultations and attendances of late , sir , "
273756	273856	273746	273746	Vholes	248	" and these things mount up , and I do n't profess to be a man of capital . When we first entered on our present relations I stated to you openly - it is a principle of mine that there never can be too much openness between solicitor and client - that I was not a man of capital and that if capital was your object you had better leave your papers in Kenge 's office . No , Mr. C. , you will find none of the advantages or disadvantages of capital here , sir . This , "
273866	273878	273857	273857	Vholes	248	" is your rock ; it pretends to be nothing more . "
273982	273986	273958	273959	the client	5788	" pull him through "
274014	274042	274001	274001	his	248	" Always here , sir . Personally , or by letter , you will always find me here , sir , with my shoulder to the wheel . "
274629	274632	274634	274635	Mr. Weevle	504	" William , "
274641	274665	274634	274635	Mr. Weevle	504	" there 's combustion going on there ! It 's not a case of spontaneous , but it 's smouldering combustion it is . "
274666	274669	274671	274672	Mr. Guppy	301	" Ah ! "
274674	274746	274671	274672	Mr. Guppy	301	" He would n't keep out of Jarndyce , and I suppose he 's over head and ears in debt . I never knew much of him . He was as high as the monument when he was on trial at our place . A good riddance to me , whether as clerk or client ! Well , Tony , that as I was mentioning is what they 're up to . "
274767	274777	274779	274780	Mr. Guppy	301	" They are still up to it , sir , "
274813	274814	274804	274804	they	6434	" "
274820	274821	274822	274822	Small	491	" "
274912	274913	274914	274914	You	0	" "
274922	274923	274924	274924	Tony	504	" "
274926	274935	274924	274924	Tony	504	" says Mr. Guppy , a little disconcerted , "
274984	274994	274983	274983	Tony	504	" - Mr. Guppy becomes mysteriously and tenderly eloquent - "
275170	275186	275187	275187	Tony	504	" Mr. Weevle reflects for some time . Shakes his head . Decidedly thinks not . "
275189	275200	275187	275187	Tony	504	" says Mr. Guppy as they walk towards the court , "
275323	275684	275726	275726	We	6451	" Mr. Weevle nods . Mr. Guppy , much elevated in his own opinion by having delivered these observations , with an air in part forensic and in part romantic - this gentleman having a passion for conducting anything in the form of an examination , or delivering anything in the form of a summing up or a speech - accompanies his friend with dignity to the court . Never since it has been a court has it had such a Fortunatus ' purse of gossip as in the proceedings at the rag and bottle shop . Regularly , every morning at eight , is the elder Mr. Smallweed brought down to the corner and carried in , accompanied by Mrs. Smallweed , Judy , and Bart ; and regularly , all day , do they all remain there until nine at night , solaced by gipsy dinners , not abundant in quantity , from the cook 's shop , rummaging and searching , digging , delving , and diving among the treasures of the late lamented . What those treasures are they keep so secret that the court is maddened . In its delirium it imagines guineas pouring out of tea - pots , crown - pieces overflowing punch - bowls , old chairs and mattresses stuffed with Bank of England notes . It possesses itself of the sixpenny history with highly coloured folding frontispiece of Mr. Daniel Dancer and his sister , and also of Mr. Elwes , of Suffolk , and transfers all the facts from those authentic narratives to Mr. Krook . Twice when the dustman is called in to carry off a cartload of old paper , ashes , and broken bottles , the whole court assembles and pries into the baskets as they come forth . Many times the two gentlemen who write with the ravenous little pens on the tissue - paper are seen prowling in the neighbourhood - shy of each other , their late partnership being dissolved . The Sol skilfully carries a vein of the prevailing interest through the Harmonic nights . Little Swills , in what are professionally known as "
275686	275702	275726	275726	We	6451	" allusions to the subject , is received with loud applause ; and the same vocalist "
275704	275725	275726	275726	We	6451	" in the regular business like a man inspired . Even Miss M. Melvilleson , in the revived Caledonian melody of "
275732	275737	275726	275726	We	6451	" points the sentiment that "
275742	276110	275726	275726	We	6451	" whatever the nature of that refreshment may be with such archness and such a turn of the head towards next door that she is immediately understood to mean Mr. Smallweed loves to find money , and is nightly honoured with a double encore . For all this , the court discovers nothing ; and as Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins now communicate to the late lodger whose appearance is the signal for a general rally , it is in one continual ferment to discover everything , and more . Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy , with every eye in the court 's head upon them , knock at the closed door of the late lamented 's house , in a high state of popularity . But being contrary to the court 's expectation admitted , they immediately become unpopular and are considered to mean no good . The shutters are more or less closed all over the house , and the ground - floor is sufficiently dark to require candles . Introduced into the back shop by Mr. Smallweed the younger , they , fresh from the sunlight , can at first see nothing save darkness and shadows ; but they gradually discern the elder Mr. Smallweed seated in his chair upon the brink of a well or grave of waste - paper , the virtuous Judy groping therein like a female sexton , and Mrs. Smallweed on the level ground in the vicinity snowed up in a heap of paper fragments , print , and manuscript which would appear to be the accumulated compliments that have been sent flying at her in the course of the day . The whole party , Small included , are blackened with dust and dirt and present a fiendish appearance not relieved by the general aspect of the room . There is more litter and lumber in it than of old , and it is dirtier if possible ; likewise , it is ghostly with traces of its dead inhabitant and even with his chalked writing on the wall . On the entrance of visitors , Mr. Smallweed and Judy simultaneously fold their arms and stop in their researches . "
276113	276119	275726	275726	We	6451	" croaks the old gentleman . "
276199	276264	276269	276269	sir	9569	" Mr. Weevle , thanking him , casts an eye about . Mr. Guppy 's eye follows Mr. Weevle 's eye . Mr. Weevle 's eye comes back without any new intelligence in it . Mr. Guppy 's eye comes back and meets Mr. Smallweed 's eye . That engaging old gentleman is still murmuring , like some wound - up instrument running down , "
276276	276308	276269	276269	sir	9569	" And then having run down , he lapses into grinning silence , as Mr. Guppy starts at seeing Mr. Tulkinghorn standing in the darkness opposite with his hands behind him . "
276319	276324	276325	276325	I	0	" says Grandfather Smallweed . "
276345	276395	276340	276340	he	6462	" Mr. Guppy , slightly nudging his friend to take another look , makes a shuffling bow to Mr. Tulkinghorn , who returns it with an easy nod . Mr. Tulkinghorn is looking on as if he had nothing else to do and were rather amused by the novelty . "
276409	276417	276403	276403	sir	9569	" Mr. Guppy observes to Mr. Smallweed . "
276474	276505	276463	276463	we	6466	" Mr. Smallweed has run down again , while Mr. Weevle 's eye , attended by Mr. Guppy 's eye , has again gone round the room and come back . "
276510	276515	276508	276508	sir	9569	" says Mr. Weevle . "
276531	276532	276523	276523	you	9569	" "
276552	276646	276547	276547	yourself	9569	" As they go upstairs , Mr. Guppy lifts his eyebrows inquiringly and looks at Tony . Tony shakes his head . They find the old room very dull and dismal , with the ashes of the fire that was burning on that memorable night yet in the discoloured grate . They have a great disinclination to touch any object , and carefully blow the dust from it first . Nor are they desirous to prolong their visit , packing the few movables with all possible speed and never speaking above a whisper . "
276650	276656	276547	276547	yourself	9569	" says Tony , recoiling . "
276665	276673	276674	276674	Small	491	" Mr. Guppy retreats behind a chair . "
276759	276826	276827	276828	Mr. Guppy	301	" Lady Jane , in the doorway , with her tiger snarl from ear to ear and her club of a tail , shows no intention of obeying ; but Mr. Tulkinghorn stumbling over her , she spits at his rusty legs , and swearing wrathfully , takes her arched back upstairs . Possibly to roam the house - tops again and return by the chimney . "
276830	276835	276827	276828	Mr. Guppy	301	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn , "
276844	276874	276875	276875	Sir	9569	" Mr. Guppy is engaged in collecting the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty from the wall and depositing those works of art in their old ignoble band - box . "
276877	276883	276875	276875	Sir	9569	" he returns , reddening , "
276957	276958	276934	276934	I	0	" "
276963	276968	276971	276971	sir	9569	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn . "
276992	276993	277037	277038	Mr. Guppy	301	" "
277000	277016	277037	277038	Mr. Guppy	301	" Mr. Tulkinghorn is as imperturbable as the hearthstone to which he has quietly walked . "
277040	277059	277037	277038	Mr. Guppy	301	" He pauses here to smile , and his smile is as dull and rusty as his pantaloons . "
277078	277079	277076	277076	sir	9569	" "
277092	277093	277087	277087	I	0	" "
277130	277161	277162	277162	Sir	9569	" Mr. Guppy , looking as if he would give his own reddening and still reddening ears to be one of those people at present instead of himself , replies , "
277236	277237	277230	277230	I	0	" "
277242	277243	277230	277230	I	0	" "

277258	277267	277230	277230	I	0	" says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a calm nod . "
277289	277304	277287	277287	sir	9569	" He addresses this to the astounded Tony , who admits the soft impeachment . "
277314	277347	277287	277287	sir	9569	" observes Mr. Tulkinghorn . He has been standing on the hearthstone with his back to the smoked chimney - piece , and now turns round with his glasses to his eyes . "
277384	277419	277420	277420	Tony	504	" When he has walked out , Mr. Guppy , in a great perspiration , nerves himself to the hasty completion of the taking down of the Galaxy Gallery , concluding with Lady Dedlock . "
277422	277431	277420	277420	Tony	504	" he says hurriedly to his astonished companion , "
277593	279025	279026	279026	She	6503	" This charge Mr. Guppy delivers in a state little short of forensic lunacy , while his friend shows a dazed mind in his whole head of hair and even in his cultivated whiskers . CHAPTER XL National and Domestic England has been in a dreadful state for some weeks . Lord Coodle would go out , Sir Thomas Doodle would n't come in , and there being nobody in Great Britain to speak of except Coodle and Doodle , there has been no government . It is a mercy that the hostile meeting between those two great men , which at one time seemed inevitable , did not come off , because if both pistols had taken effect , and Coodle and Doodle had killed each other , it is to be presumed that England must have waited to be governed until young Coodle and young Doodle , now in frocks and long stockings , were grown up . This stupendous national calamity , however , was averted by Lord Coodle 's making the timely discovery that if in the heat of debate he had said that he scorned and despised the whole ignoble career of Sir Thomas Doodle , he had merely meant to say that party differences should never induce him to withhold from it the tribute of his warmest admiration ; while it as opportunely turned out , on the other hand , that Sir Thomas Doodle had in his own bosom expressly booked Lord Coodle to go down to posterity as the mirror of virtue and honour . Still England has been some weeks in the dismal strait of having no pilot as was well observed by Sir Leicester Dedlock to weather the storm ; and the marvellous part of the matter is that England has not appeared to care very much about it , but has gone on eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage as the old world did in the days before the flood . But Coodle knew the danger , and Doodle knew the danger , and all their followers and hangers - on had the clearest possible perception of the danger . At last Sir Thomas Doodle has not only condescended to come in , but has done it handsomely , bringing in with him all his nephews , all his male cousins , and all his brothers - in - law . So there is hope for the old ship yet . Doodle has found that he must throw himself upon the country , chiefly in the form of sovereigns and beer . In this metamorphosed state he is available in a good many places simultaneously and can throw himself upon a considerable portion of the country at one time . Britannia being much occupied in pocketing Doodle in the form of sovereigns , and swallowing Doodle in the form of beer , and in swearing herself black in the face that she does neither - plainly to the advancement of her glory and morality - the London season comes to a sudden end , through all the Doodleites and Coodleites dispersing to assist Britannia in those religious exercises . Hence Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper at Chesney Wold , foresees , though no instructions have yet come down , that the family may shortly be expected , together with a pretty large accession of cousins and others who can in any way assist the great Constitutional work . And hence the stately old dame , taking Time by the forelock , leads him up and down the staircases , and along the galleries and passages , and through the rooms , to witness before he grows any older that everything is ready , that floors are rubbed bright , carpets spread , curtains shaken out , beds puffed and patted , still - room and kitchen cleared for action - all things prepared as beseems the Dedlock dignity . This present summer evening , as the sun goes down , the preparations are complete . Dreary and solemn the old house looks , with so many appliances of habitation and with no inhabitants except the pictured forms upon the walls . So did these come and go , a Dedlock in possession might have ruminated passing along ; so did they see this gallery hushed and quiet , as I see it now ; so think , as I think , of the gap that they would make in this domain when they were gone ; so find it , as I find it , difficult to believe that it could be without them ; so pass from my world , as I pass from theirs , now closing the reverberating door ; so leave no blank to miss them , and so die . Through some of the fiery windows beautiful from without , and set , at this sunset hour , not in dull - grey stone but in a glorious house of gold , the light excluded at other windows pours in rich , lavish , overflowing like the summer plenty in the land . Then do the frozen Dedlocks thaw . Strange movements come upon their features as the shadows of leaves play there . A dense justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink . A staring baronet , with a truncheon , gets a dimple in his chin . Down into the bosom of a stony shepherdess there steals a fleck of light and warmth that would have done it good a hundred years ago . One ancestress of Volumnia , in high- heeled shoes , very like her - casting the shadow of that virgin event before her full two centuries - shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint . A maid of honour of the court of Charles the Second , with large round eyes and other charms to correspond , seems to bathe in glowing water , and it ripples as it glows . But the fire of the sun is dying . Even now the floor is dusky , and shadow slowly mounts the walls , bringing the Dedlocks down like age and death . And now , upon my Lady 's picture over the great chimney- piece , a weird shade falls from some old tree , that turns it pale , and flutters it , and looks as if a great arm held a veil or hood , watching an opportunity to draw it over her . Higher and darker rises shadow on the wall - now a red gloom on the ceiling - now the fire is out . All that prospect , which from the terrace looked so near , has moved solemnly away and changed - not the first nor the last of beautiful things that look so near and will so change - into a distant phantom . Light mists arise , and the dew falls , and all the sweet scents in the garden are heavy in the air . Now the woods settle into great masses as if they were each one profound tree . And now the moon rises to separate them , and to glimmer here and there in horizontal lines behind their stems , and to make the avenue a pavement of light among high cathedral arches fantastically broken . Now the moon is high ; and the great house , needing habitation more than ever , is like a body without life . Now it is even awful , stealing through it , to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary bedrooms , to say nothing of the dead . Now is the time for shadow , when every corner is a cavern and every downward step a pit , when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon the floors , when anything and everything can be made of the heavy staircase beams excepting their own proper shapes , when the armour has dull lights upon it not easily to be distinguished from stealthy movement , and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive of heads inside . But of all the shadows in Chesney Wold , the shadow in the long drawing - room upon my Lady 's picture is the first to come , the last to be disturbed . At this hour and by this light it changes into threatening hands raised up and menacing the handsome face with every breath that stirs . "
279033	279045	279026	279026	She	6503	" says a groom in Mrs. Rouncewell 's audience - chamber . "
279056	279057	279026	279026	She	6503	" "
279117	279118	279097	279098	My Lady	934	" "
279124	279132	279122	279122	Thomas	411	" rejoins the housekeeper with proud complacency , "
279152	279679	279122	279122	Thomas	411	" Thomas may have his own personal opinions on this subject , probably hints them in his manner of smoothing his sleek head from the nape of his neck to his temples , but he forbears to express them further and retires to the servants ' hall to regale on cold meat - pie and ale . This groom is the pilot - fish before the nobler shark . Next evening , down come Sir Leicester and my Lady with their largest retinue , and down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass . Thenceforth for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men with no names , who fly about all those particular parts of the country on which Doodle is at present throwing himself in an auriferous and malty shower , but who are merely persons of a restless disposition and never do anything anywhere . On these national occasions Sir Leicester finds the cousins useful . A better man than the Honourable Bob Stables to meet the Hunt at dinner , there could not possibly be . Better got up gentlemen than the other cousins to ride over to polling - booths and hustings here and there , and show themselves on the side of England , it would be hard to find . Volumnia is a little dim , but she is of the true descent ; and there are many who appreciate her sprightly conversation , her French conundrums so old as to have become in the cycles of time almost new again , the honour of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner , or even the privilege of her hand in the dance . On these national occasions dancing may be a patriotic service , and Volumnia is constantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and unpensioning country . My Lady takes no great pains to entertain the numerous guests , and being still unwell , rarely appears until late in the day . But at all the dismal dinners , leaden lunches , basilisk balls , and other melancholy pageants , her mere appearance is a relief . As to Sir Leicester , he conceives it utterly impossible that anything can be wanting , in any direction , by any one who has the good fortune to be received under that roof ; and in a state of sublime satisfaction , he moves among the company , a magnificent refrigerator . Daily the cousins trot through dust and canter over roadside turf , away to hustings and polling - booths with leather gloves and hunting - whips for the counties and kid gloves and riding - canes for the boroughs , and daily bring back reports on which Sir Leicester holds forth after dinner . Daily the restless men who have no occupation in life present the appearance of being rather busy . Daily Volumnia has a little cousinly talk with Sir Leicester on the state of the nation , from which Sir Leicester is disposed to conclude that Volumnia is a more reflecting woman than he had thought her . "
279686	279695	279122	279122	Thomas	411	" says Miss Volumnia , clasping her hands . "
279700	279749	279750	279750	Volumnia	561	" The mighty business is nearly over by this time , and Doodle will throw himself off the country in a few days more . Sir Leicester has just appeared in the long drawing - room after dinner , a bright particular star surrounded by clouds of cousins . "
279752	279765	279750	279750	Volumnia	561	" replies Sir Leicester , who has a list in his hand , "
279771	279772	279766	279766	we	6515	" "
279776	279841	279842	279842	Volumnia	561	" Although it is summer weather , Sir Leicester always has his own particular fire in the evening . He takes his usual screened seat near it and repeats with much firmness and a little displeasure , as who should say , I am not a common man , and when I say tolerably , it must not be understood as a common expression , "
279849	279850	279842	279842	Volumnia	561	" "
279860	279866	279869	279869	Volumnia	561	" Volumnia asserts with confidence . "
279889	279890	279882	279882	I	0	" "
279906	279934	279935	279937	A sensible woman	6517	" Volumnia 's finishing the sentence restores her to favour . Sir Leicester , with a gracious inclination of his head , seems to say to himself , "
279948	280019	280020	280020	You	6518	" In fact , as to this question of opposition , the fair Dedlock 's observation was superfluous , Sir Leicester on these occasions always delivering in his own candidateship , as a kind of handsome wholesale order to be promptly executed . Two other little seats that belong to him he treats as retail orders of less importance , merely sending down the men and signifying to the tradespeople , "
280042	280043	280044	280044	I	0	" "
280081	280082	280049	280049	Volumnia	561	" "
280089	280093	280049	280049	Volumnia	561	" says Volumnia . "
280096	280111	280049	280049	Volumnia	561	" proceeds Sir Leicester , glancing at the circumjacent cousins on sofas and ottomans , "
280136	280167	280298	280298	Volumnia	561	" Note , by the way , that the Coodleites are always a faction with the Doodleites , and that the Doodleites occupy exactly the same position towards the Coodleites . "
280204	280219	280298	280298	Volumnia	561	" says Sir Leicester , eyeing the cousins with increasing dignity and swelling indignation , "
280226	280280	280298	280298	Volumnia	561	" If Volumnia have a fault , it is the fault of being a trifle too innocent , seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well with a sash and tucker is a little out of keeping with the rouge and pearl necklace . Howbeit , impelled by innocence , she asks , "
280284	280285	280286	280286	Volumnia	561	" "
280288	280297	280298	280298	Volumnia	561	" remonstrates Sir Leicester with his utmost severity . "
280300	280301	280298	280298	Volumnia	561	" "
280313	280322	280306	280306	I	0	" cries Volumnia with her favourite little scream . "
280334	280335	280328	280328	I	0	" "
280340	280345	280347	280347	you	0	" returns Sir Leicester , "
280354	280378	280347	280347	you	0	" Volumnia hastens to express her opinion that the shocking people ought to be tried as traitors and made to support the party . "
280385	280396	280379	280379	I	0	" repeats Sir Leicester , unmindful of these mollifying sentiments , "
280463	280556	280557	280557	I	0	" Sir Leicester feels it incumbent on him to observe a crushing aspect towards Volumnia because it is whispered abroad that these necessary expenses will , in some two hundred election petitions , be unpleasantly connected with the word bribery , and because some graceless jokers have consequently suggested the omission from the Church service of the ordinary supplication in behalf of the High Court of Parliament and have recommended instead that the prayers of the congregation be requested for six hundred and fifty - eight gentlemen in a very unhealthy state . "
280560	280578	280557	280557	I	0	" observes Volumnia , having taken a little time to recover her spirits after her late castigation , "
280589	280590	280591	280591	I	0	" "
280596	280605	280557	280557	I	0	" says Sir Leicester , opening his eyes , "
280633	280928	280929	280929	He	6532	" Volumnia had thought he might have been employed . Sir Leicester could desire to know by whom , and what for . Volumnia , abashed again , suggests , by somebody - to advise and make arrangements . Sir Leicester is not aware that any client of Mr. Tulkinghorn has been in need of his assistance . Lady Dedlock , seated at an open window with her arm upon its cushioned ledge and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the park , has seemed to attend since the lawyer 's name was mentioned . A languid cousin with a moustache in a state of extreme debility now observes from his couch that man told him ya'as'dy that Tulkinghorn had gone down t ' that iron place t ' give legal ' pinion 'bout something , and that contest being over t ' day , ' twould be highly jawlly thing if Tulkinghorn should ' pear with news that Coodle man was floored . Mercury in attendance with coffee informs Sir Leicester , hereupon , that Mr. Tulkinghorn has arrived and is taking dinner . My Lady turns her head inward for the moment , then looks out again as before . Volumnia is charmed to hear that her delight is come . He is so original , such a stolid creature , such an immense being for knowing all sorts of things and never telling them ! Volumnia is persuaded that he must be a Freemason . Is sure he is at the head of a lodge , and wears short aprons , and is made a perfect idol of with candlesticks and trowels . These lively remarks the fair Dedlock delivers in her youthful manner , while making a purse . "
280936	280971	280929	280929	He	6532	" she adds , ' since I came . I really had some thoughts of breaking my heart for the inconstant creature . I had almost made up my mind that he was dead . "
281006	281012	281003	281003	she	6534	" I would he were ! "
281013	281017	281019	281020	Sir Leicester	268	" Mr. Tulkinghorn , "
281022	281043	281019	281020	Sir Leicester	268	" is always welcome here and always discreet wheresoever he is . A very valuable person , and deservedly respected . "
281050	281056	281019	281020	Sir Leicester	268	" ' normously rich fler . "
281057	281066	281068	281069	Sir Leicester	268	" He has a stake in the country , "
281071	281100	281068	281069	Sir Leicester	268	" I have no doubt . He is , of course , handsomely paid , and he associates almost on a footing of equality with the highest society . "
281112	281120	281124	281124	her	561	" Good gracious , what 's that ? "
281129	281133	281135	281136	my Lady	934	" A rat , "
281138	281145	281135	281136	my Lady	934	" And they have shot him . "
281158	281163	281165	281166	Sir Leicester	268	" No , no , "
281168	281183	281165	281166	Sir Leicester	268	" I think not . My Lady , do you object to the twilight ? "
281193	281196	281188	281189	my Lady	934	" Volumnia ? "
281214	281220	281222	281223	Sir Leicester	268	" Then take them away , "
281225	281238	281222	281223	Sir Leicester	268	" Tulkinghorn , I beg your pardon . How do you do ? "
281354	281357	281359	281360	Sir Leicester	268	" Now , "
281362	281369	281359	281360	Sir Leicester	268	" How has that contest gone ? "
281370	281402	281426	281426	he	271	" Oh , hollow from the beginning . Not a chance . They have brought in both their people . You are beaten out of all reason . Three to one . "
281428	281430	281359	281360	Sir Leicester	268	" you "
281436	281439	281426	281426	he	271	" we . "
281476	281485	281486	281487	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" It 's the place , you know , "
281504	281516	281486	281487	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" where they wanted to put up Mrs. Rouncewell 's son . "
281517	281539	281541	281542	Sir Leicester	268	" A proposal which , as you correctly informed me at the time , he had the becoming taste and perception , "
281544	281595	281541	281542	Sir Leicester	268	" to decline . I can not say that I by any means approve of the sentiments expressed by Mr. Rouncewell when he was here for some half - hour in this room , but there was a sense of propriety in his decision which I am glad to acknowledge . "
281596	281599	281601	281602	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Ha ! "
281604	281620	281601	281602	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" It did not prevent him from being very active in this election , though . "
281631	281651	281621	281622	Sir Leicester	268	" Did I understand you ? Did you say that Mr. Rouncewell had been very active in this election ? "
281652	281656	281541	281542	Sir Leicester	268	" Uncommonly active . "
281657	281660	281621	281622	Sir Leicester	268	" Against - "
281661	281705	281621	281622	Sir Leicester	268	" Oh , dear yes , against you . He is a very good speaker . Plain and emphatic . He made a damaging effect , and has great influence . In the business part of the proceedings he carried all before him . "
281727	281734	281736	281737	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" And he was much assisted , "
281744	281749	281736	281737	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" by his son . "
281750	281757	281759	281760	Sir Leicester	268	" By his son , sir ? "
281765	281770	281759	281760	Sir Leicester	268	" By his son . "
281771	281787	281736	281737	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" The son who wished to marry the young woman in my Lady 's service ? "
281788	281797	281736	281737	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" That son . He has but one . "
281798	281804	281806	281807	Sir Leicester	268	" Then upon my honour , "
281825	281872	281806	281807	Sir Leicester	268	" then upon my honour , upon my life , upon my reputation and principles , the floodgates of society are burst open , and the waters have - a - obliterated the landmarks of the framework of the cohesion by which things are held together ! "
281917	281921	281923	281924	Sir Leicester	268	" I beg , "
281930	281958	281923	281924	Sir Leicester	268	" that we may not comment further on this circumstance . Comment is superfluous . My Lady , let me suggest in reference to that young woman - "
281959	281965	281970	281970	her	934	" I have no intention , "
281979	281985	281970	281970	her	934	" of parting with her . "
281986	281993	281995	281996	Sir Leicester	268	" That was not my meaning , "
281998	282090	281995	281996	Sir Leicester	268	" I am glad to hear you say so . I would suggest that as you think her worthy of your patronage , you should exert your influence to keep her from these dangerous hands . You might show her what violence would be done in such association to her duties and principles , and you might preserve her for a better fate . You might point out to her that she probably would , in good time , find a husband at Chesney Wold by whom she would not be - "
282101	282110	282091	282092	Sir Leicester	268	" dragged from the altars of her forefathers . "
282163	282170	282172	282173	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" It is worthy of remark , "
282175	282190	282172	282173	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" however , that these people are , in their way , very proud . "
282191	282194	282195	282196	Sir Leicester	268	" Proud ? "
282201	282237	282195	282196	Sir Leicester	268	" I should not be surprised if they all voluntarily abandoned the girl - yes , lover and all - instead of her abandoning them , supposing she remained at Chesney Wold under such circumstances . "
282238	282241	282243	282244	Sir Leicester	268	" Well ! "
282247	282263	282243	282244	Sir Leicester	268	" Well ! You should know , Mr. Tulkinghorn . You have been among them . "
282264	282270	282272	282273	the lawyer	1047	" Really , Sir Leicester , "
282275	282296	282297	282297	Her	6555	" I state the fact . Why , I could tell you a story - with Lady Dedlock 's permission . "
282329	282337	282338	282339	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" No . Real flesh and blood . "
282356	282410	282352	282352	his	271	" Real flesh and blood , Miss Dedlock . Sir Leicester , these particulars have only lately become known to me . They are very brief . They exemplify what I have said . I suppress names for the present . Lady Dedlock will not think me ill - bred , I hope ? "
282446	282508	282509	282510	Sir Leicester	268	" A townsman of this Mrs. Rouncewell , a man in exactly parallel circumstances as I am told , had the good fortune to have a daughter who attracted the notice of a great lady . I speak of really a great lady , not merely great to him , but married to a gentleman of your condition , Sir Leicester . "
282514	282520	282509	282510	Sir Leicester	268	" Yes , Mr. Tulkinghorn , "
282543	282645	282652	282652	he	6556	" The lady was wealthy and beautiful , and had a liking for the girl , and treated her with great kindness , and kept her always near her . Now this lady preserved a secret under all her greatness , which she had preserved for many years . In fact , she had in early life been engaged to marry a young rake - he was a captain in the army - nothing connected with whom came to any good . She never did marry him , but she gave birth to a child of which he was the father . "
282676	282893	282665	282666	Lady Dedlock	266	" The captain in the army being dead , she believed herself safe ; but a train of circumstances with which I need not trouble you led to discovery . As I received the story , they began in an imprudence on her own part one day when she was taken by surprise , which shows how difficult it is for the firmest of us she was very firm to be always guarded . There was great domestic trouble and amazement , you may suppose ; I leave you to imagine , Sir Leicester , the husband 's grief . But that is not the present point . When Mr. Rouncewell 's townsman heard of the disclosure , he no more allowed the girl to be patronized and honoured than he would have suffered her to be trodden underfoot before his eyes . Such was his pride , that he indignantly took her away , as if from reproach and disgrace . He had no sense of the honour done him and his daughter by the lady 's condescension ; not the least . He resented the girl 's position , as if the lady had been the commonest of commoners . That is the story . I hope Lady Dedlock will excuse its painful nature . "
282948	282957	282958	282959	Sir Leicester	268	" no business - Rouncewell 's fernal townsman . "
283764	283768	283754	283754	Both	2637	" Lady Dedlock ? "
283802	283814	283792	283792	They	6583	" Why have you told my story to so many persons ? "
283815	283832	283883	283883	his	271	" Lady Dedlock , it was necessary for me to inform you that I knew it . "
283833	283841	283895	283895	he	271	" How long have you known it ? "
283842	283858	283792	283792	They	6583	" I have suspected it a long while - fully known it a little while . "
283859	283862	283883	283883	his	271	" Months ? "
283863	283866	283867	283867	He	271	" Days . "
283944	283953	283954	283954	He	271	" Is this true concerning the poor girl ? "
283968	284007	283959	283959	his	271	" You know what you related . Is it true ? Do her friends know my story also ? Is it the town - talk yet ? Is it chalked upon the walls and cried in the streets ? "
284064	284107	284042	284042	he	271	" No , Lady Dedlock . That was a hypothetical case , arising out of Sir Leicester 's unconsciously carrying the matter with so high a hand . But it would be a real case if they knew - what we know . "
284108	284117	284042	284042	he	271	" Then they do not know it yet ? "
284118	284121	284042	284042	he	271	" No . "
284122	284136	284042	284042	he	271	" Can I save the poor girl from injury before they know it ? "
284137	284143	284144	284145	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Really , Lady Dedlock , "
284148	284160	284144	284145	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" I can not give a satisfactory opinion on that point . "
284181	284192	284173	284173	he	271	" The power and force of this woman are astonishing ! "
284193	284196	284197	284197	she	266	" Sir , "
284221	284356	284197	284197	she	266	" I will make it plainer . I do not dispute your hypothetical case . I anticipated it , and felt its truth as strongly as you can do , when I saw Mr. Rouncewell here . I knew very well that if he could have had the power of seeing me as I was , he would consider the poor girl tarnished by having for a moment been , although most innocently , the subject of my great and distinguished patronage . But I have an interest in her , or I should rather say - no longer belonging to this place - I had , and if you can find so much consideration for the woman under your foot as to remember that , she will be very sensible of your mercy . "
284381	284460	284375	284375	his	271	" You have prepared me for my exposure , and I thank you for that too . Is there anything that you require of me ? Is there any claim that I can release or any charge or trouble that I can spare my husband in obtaining HIS release by certifying to the exactness of your discovery ? I will write anything , here and now , that you will dictate . I am ready to do it . "
284483	284497	284468	284469	the lawyer	1047	" I will not trouble you , Lady Dedlock . Pray spare yourself . "
284498	284537	284468	284469	the lawyer	1047	" I have long expected this , as you know . I neither wish to spare myself nor to be spared . You can do nothing worse to me than you have done . Do what remains now . "
284538	284563	284468	284469	the lawyer	1047	" Lady Dedlock , there is nothing to be done . I will take leave to say a few words when you have finished . "
284682	284693	284694	284695	Lady Dedlock	266	" Of repentance or remorse or any feeling of mine , "
284699	284729	284730	284730	He	271	" I say not a word . If I were not dumb , you would be deaf . Let that go by . It is not for your ears . "
284749	284845	284740	284740	she	266	" Of other and very different things I come to speak to you . My jewels are all in their proper places of keeping . They will be found there . So , my dresses . So , all the valuables I have . Some ready money I had with me , please to say , but no large amount . I did not wear my own dress , in order that I might avoid observation . I went to be henceforward lost . Make this known . I leave no other charge with you . "
284846	284853	284855	284856	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Excuse me , Lady Dedlock , "
284861	284874	284855	284856	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" I am not sure that I understand you . You want - "
284875	284896	284900	284900	his	271	" To be lost to all here . I leave Chesney Wold to - night . I go this hour . "
284930	284940	284927	284927	his	271	" What ? Not go as I have said ? "
284941	284947	284948	284948	he	271	" No , Lady Dedlock , "
284953	284986	284948	284948	he	271	" Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be ? Have you forgotten the stain and blot upon this place , and where it is , and who it is ? "
284987	284998	285004	285004	she	6597	" No , Lady Dedlock , not by any means . "
285033	285084	285030	285030	his	271	" Lady Dedlock , have the goodness to stop and hear me , or before you reach the staircase I shall ring the alarm - bell and rouse the house . And then I must speak out before every guest and servant , every man and woman , in it . "
285143	285154	285138	285138	He	271	" Have the goodness to hear me , Lady Dedlock , "
285179	285247	285170	285170	he	271	" The relations between us are of an unfortunate description , Lady Dedlock ; but as they are not of my making , I will not apologize for them . The position I hold in reference to Sir Leicester is so well known to you that I can hardly imagine but that I must long have appeared in your eyes the natural person to make this discovery . "
285248	285251	285252	285252	she	6597	" Sir , "
285268	285294	285252	285252	she	6597	" I had better have gone . It would have been far better not to have detained me . I have no more to say . "
285295	285311	285170	285170	he	271	" Excuse me , Lady Dedlock , if I add a little more to hear . "
285312	285332	285333	285333	His	6598	" I wish to hear it at the window , then . I ca n't breathe where I am . "
285431	285498	285499	285499	He	6598	" Lady Dedlock , I have not yet been able to come to a decision satisfactory to myself on the course before me . I am not clear what to do or how to act next . I must request you , in the meantime , to keep your secret as you have kept it so long and not to wonder that I keep it too . "
285508	285529	285499	285499	He	6598	" Pardon me , Lady Dedlock . This is an important subject . You are honouring me with your attention ? "
285530	285534	285424	285424	he	6598	" I am . "
285535	285596	285499	285499	He	6598	" Thank you . I might have known it from what I have seen of your strength of character . I ought not to have asked the question , but I have the habit of making sure of my ground , step by step , as I go on . The sole consideration in this unhappy case is Sir Leicester . "
285597	285601	285602	285602	she	6597	" Then why , "
285619	285628	285602	285602	she	6597	" do you detain me in his house ? "
285629	285689	285690	285690	She	6597	" Because he IS the consideration . Lady Dedlock , I have no occasion to tell you that Sir Leicester is a very proud man , that his reliance upon you is implicit , that the fall of that moon out of the sky would not amaze him more than your fall from your high position as his wife . "
285715	285813	285703	285703	he	6600	" I declare to you , Lady Dedlock , that with anything short of this case that I have , I would as soon have hoped to root up by means of my own strength and my own hands the oldest tree on this estate as to shake your hold upon Sir Leicester and Sir Leicester 's trust and confidence in you . And even now , with this case , I hesitate . Not that he could doubt that , even with him , is impossible , but that nothing can prepare him for the blow . "
285814	285819	285820	285820	she	6597	" Not my flight ? "
285823	285829	285820	285820	she	6597	" Think of it again . "
285830	285876	285883	285883	his	6597	" Your flight , Lady Dedlock , would spread the whole truth , and a hundred times the whole truth , far and wide . It would be impossible to save the family credit for a day . It is not to be thought of . "
285891	285931	285933	285934	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" When I speak of Sir Leicester being the sole consideration , he and the family credit are one . Sir Leicester and the baronetcy , Sir Leicester and Chesney Wold , Sir Leicester and his ancestors and his patrimony "
285939	285954	285933	285934	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" are , I need not say to you , Lady Dedlock , inseparable . "
285955	285959	285820	285820	she	6597	" Go on ! "
285960	285963	285965	285966	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Therefore , "
285977	286101	286102	286102	He	6597	" I have much to consider . This is to be hushed up if it can be . How can it be , if Sir Leicester is driven out of his wits or laid upon a death - bed ? If I inflicted this shock upon him to - morrow morning , how could the immediate change in him be accounted for ? What could have caused it ? What could have divided you ? Lady Dedlock , the wall - chalking and the street - crying would come on directly , and you are to remember that it would not affect you merely whom I can not at all consider in this business but your husband , Lady Dedlock , your husband . "
286119	286127	286128	286128	he	6597	" There is another point of view , "
286131	286220	286128	286128	he	6597	" in which the case presents itself . Sir Leicester is devoted to you almost to infatuation . He might not be able to overcome that infatuation , even knowing what we know . I am putting an extreme case , but it might be so . If so , it were better that he knew nothing . Better for common sense , better for him , better for me . I must take all this into account , and it combines to render a decision very difficult . "
286249	286255	286257	286258	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" My experience teaches me , "
286286	286371	286266	286266	his	271	" My experience teaches me , Lady Dedlock , that most of the people I know would do far better to leave marriage alone . It is at the bottom of three fourths of their troubles . So I thought when Sir Leicester married , and so I always have thought since . No more about that . I must now be guided by circumstances . In the meanwhile I must beg you to keep your own counsel , and I will keep mine . "
286372	286393	286394	286394	she	6603	" I am to drag my present life on , holding its pains at your pleasure , day by day ? "
286404	286415	286394	286394	she	6603	" Yes , I am afraid so , Lady Dedlock . "
286416	286434	286266	286266	his	271	" It is necessary , you think , that I should be so tied to the stake ? "
286435	286446	286266	286266	his	271	" I am sure that what I recommend is necessary . "
286447	286480	286481	286481	she	6603	" I am to remain on this gaudy platform on which my miserable deception has been so long acted , and it is to fall beneath me when you give the signal ? "
286485	286502	286481	286481	she	6603	" Not without notice , Lady Dedlock . I shall take no step without forewarning you . "
286524	286532	286510	286510	she	6603	" We are to meet as usual ? "
286533	286542	286266	286266	his	271	" Precisely as usual , if you please . "
286543	286560	286481	286481	she	6603	" And I am to hide my guilt , as I have done so many years ? "
286561	286628	286629	286629	She	6603	" As you have done so many years . I should not have made that reference myself , Lady Dedlock , but I may now remind you that your secret can be no heavier to you than it was , and is no worse and no better than it was . I know it certainly , but I believe we have never wholly trusted each other . "
286644	286656	286629	286629	She	6603	" Is there anything more to be sald to - night ? "
286657	286660	286481	286481	she	6603	" Why , "
286672	286689	286666	286666	he	271	" I should like to be assured of your acquiescence in my arrangements , Lady Dedlock . "
286690	286698	286629	286629	She	6603	" You may be assured of it . "
286699	286788	286666	286666	he	271	" Good . And I would wish in conclusion to remind you , as a business precaution , in case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with Sir Leicester , that throughout our interview I have expressly stated my sole consideration to be Sir Leicester 's feelings and honour and the family reputation . I should have been happy to have made Lady Dedlock a prominent consideration , too , if the case had admitted of it ; but unfortunately it does not . "
286789	286798	286805	286805	she	6604	" I can attest your fidelity , sir . "
287608	287613	287601	287606	a bowing and propitiatory little man	6645	" Is that Snagsby ? "
287614	287640	287601	287606	a bowing and propitiatory little man	6645	" Yes , sir . I hope you are well , sir . I was just giving you up , sir , and going home . "
287641	287655	287601	287606	a bowing and propitiatory little man	6645	" Aye ? What is it ? What do you want with me ? "
287656	287661	287663	287664	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Well , sir , "
287683	287696	287676	287676	his	370	" I was wishful to say a word to you , sir . "
287697	287704	287663	287664	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Can you say it here ? "
287705	287710	287676	287676	his	370	" Perfectly , sir . "
287711	287716	287717	287718	The lawyer	1047	" Say it then . "
287746	287751	287753	287754	Mr. Snagsby	370	" It is relating , "
287761	287782	287753	287754	Mr. Snagsby	370	" it is relating - not to put too fine a point upon it - to the foreigner , sir ! "
287791	287795	287783	287784	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" What foreigner ? "
287796	287866	287887	287887	his	370	" The foreign female , sir . French , if I do n't mistake ? I am not acquainted with that language myself , but I should judge from her manners and appearance that she was French ; anyways , certainly foreign . Her that was upstairs , sir , when Mr. Bucket and me had the honour of waiting upon you with the sweeping - boy that night . "
287867	287877	287887	287887	his	370	" Oh ! Yes , yes . Mademoiselle Hortense . "
287878	287883	287884	287885	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Indeed , sir ? "
287895	287919	287887	287887	his	370	" I am not acquainted myself with the names of foreigners in general , but I have no doubt it WOULD be that . "
287948	287959	287961	287962	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" And what can you have to say , Snagsby , "
287964	287968	287961	287962	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" about her ? "
287969	287974	287976	287977	the stationer	12387	" Well , sir , "
287986	288111	288112	288113	Mr. Snagsby	370	" it falls a little hard upon me . My domestic happiness is very great - at least , it 's as great as can be expected , I 'm sure - but my little woman is rather given to jealousy . Not to put too fine a point upon it , she is very much given to jealousy . And you see , a foreign female of that genteel appearance coming into the shop , and hovering - I should be the last to make use of a strong expression if I could avoid it , but hovering , sir - in the court - you know it is - now ai n't it ? I only put it to yourself , sir . "
288138	288146	288148	288149	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Why , what do you mean ? "
288151	288157	288159	288160	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Just so , sir , "
288162	288426	288159	288160	Mr. Snagsby	370	" I was sure you would feel it yourself and would excuse the reasonableness of MY feelings when coupled with the known excitableness of my little woman . You see , the foreign female - which you mentioned her name just now , with quite a native sound I am sure - caught up the word Snagsby that night , being uncommon quick , and made inquiry , and got the direction and come at dinner - time . Now Guster , our young woman , is timid and has fits , and she , taking fright at the foreigner 's looks - which are fierce - and at a grinding manner that she has of speaking - which is calculated to alarm a weak mind - gave way to it , instead of bearing up against it , and tumbled down the kitchen stairs out of one into another , such fits as I do sometimes think are never gone into , or come out of , in any house but ours . Consequently there was by good fortune ample occupation for my little woman , and only me to answer the shop . When she DID say that Mr. Tulkinghorn , being always denied to her by his employer which I had no doubt at the time was a foreign mode of viewing a clerk , she would do herself the pleasure of continually calling at my place until she was let in here . Since then she has been , as I began by saying , hovering , hovering , sir "
288437	288492	288494	288495	Mr. Snagsby	370	" in the court . The effects of which movement it is impossible to calculate . I should n't wonder if it might have already given rise to the painfullest mistakes even in the neighbours ' minds , not mentioning if such a thing was possible my little woman . Whereas , goodness knows , "
288501	288548	288498	288498	his	370	" I never had an idea of a foreign female , except as being formerly connected with a bunch of brooms and a baby , or at the present time with a tambourine and earrings . I never had , I do assure you , sir ! "
288565	288576	288560	288561	the stationer	12387	" And that 's all , is it , Snagsby ? "
288577	288587	288589	288590	Mr. Snagsby	370	" Why yes , sir , that 's all , "
288600	288610	288560	288561	the stationer	12387	" and it 's enough too - for me . "
288611	288629	288631	288632	the lawyer	1047	" I do n't know what Mademoiselle Hortense may want or mean , unless she is mad , "
288634	288645	288631	288632	the lawyer	1047	" Even if she was , you know , sir , "
288650	288675	288646	288647	Mr. Snagsby	370	" it would n't be a consolation to have some weapon or another in the form of a foreign dagger planted in the family . "
288676	288679	288681	288682	the other	10506	" No , "
288684	288711	288681	288682	the other	10506	" Well , well ! This shall be stopped . I am sorry you have been inconvenienced . If she comes again , send her here . "
288740	288779	288738	288738	himself	271	" These women were created to give trouble the whole earth over . The mistress not being enough to deal with , here 's the maid now ! But I will be short with THIS jade at least ! "
288919	288959	288960	288960	He	271	" Who 's this ? Aye , aye , mistress , it 's you , is it ? You appear at a good time . I have just been hearing of you . Now ! What do you want ? "
289018	289032	289003	289003	her	6657	" I have had great deal of trouble to find you , sir . "
289033	289037	288970	288971	the clerk	4739	" HAVE you ! "
289038	289078	289003	289003	her	6657	" I have been here very often , sir . It has always been said to me , he is not at home , he is engage , he is this and that , he is not for you . "
289079	289087	289003	289003	her	6657	" Quite right , and quite true . "
289088	289094	289003	289003	her	6657	" Not true . Lies ! "
289160	289165	289167	289168	the lawyer	1047	" Now , mistress , "
289180	289194	289167	289168	the lawyer	1047	" If you have anything to say , say it , say it . "
289195	289212	289167	289168	the lawyer	1047	" Sir , you have not use me well . You have been mean and shabby . "
289213	289220	289222	289223	the lawyer	1047	" Mean and shabby , eh ? "
289232	289300	289222	289223	the lawyer	1047	" Yes . What is it that I tell you ? You know you have . You have attrapped me - catched me - to give you information ; you have asked me to show you the dress of mine my Lady must have wore that night , you have prayed me to come in it here to meet that boy . Say ! Is it not ? "
289307	289316	289301	289302	Mademoiselle Hortense	406	" You are a vixen , a vixen ! "
289333	289344	289330	289330	he	271	" Well , wench , well . I paid you . "
289345	289350	289351	289351	she	406	" You paid me ! "
289357	289385	289387	289387	she	406	" Two sovereign ! I have not change them , I re - fuse them , I des - pise them , I throw them from me ! "
289432	289435	289437	289438	Mademoiselle Hortense	406	" Now ! "
289446	289460	289441	289441	her	406	" You have paid me ? Eh , my God , oh yes ! "
289478	289488	289489	289489	he	271	" You must be rich , my fair friend , "
289493	289502	289489	289489	he	271	" to throw money about in that way ! "
289503	289508	289509	289509	she	406	" I AM rich , "
289512	289534	289509	289509	she	406	" I am very rich in hate . I hate my Lady , of all my heart . You know that . "
289535	289545	289489	289489	he	271	" Know it ? How should I know it ? "
289546	289581	289509	289509	she	406	" Because you have known it perfectly before you prayed me to give you that information . Because you have known perfectly that I was en - r - r - r - raged ! "
289591	289593	289489	289489	he	271	" r "
289617	289627	289629	289630	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Oh ! I knew that , did I ? "
289639	289671	289629	289630	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Yes , without doubt . I am not blind . You have made sure of me because you knew that . You had reason ! I det - est her . "
289689	289703	289674	289674	her	406	" Having said this , have you anything else to say , mademoiselle ? "
289704	289775	289786	289787	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" I am not yet placed . Place me well . Find me a good condition ! If you can not , or do not choose to do that , employ me to pursue her , to chase her , to disgrace and to dishonour her . I will help you well , and with a good will . It is what YOU do . Do I not know that ? "
289776	289785	289786	289787	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" You appear to know a good deal , "
289790	289841	289786	289787	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Do I not ? Is it that I am so weak as to believe , like a child , that I come here in that dress to rec - eive that boy only to decide a little bet , a wager ? Eh , my God , oh yes ! "
289850	289852	289786	289787	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" wager "
289893	289900	289902	289903	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Now , let us see , "
289917	289923	289906	289906	his	271	" how this matter stands . "
289924	289931	289942	289942	her	406	" Ah ! Let us see , "
289945	289973	289942	289942	her	406	" You come here to make a remarkably modest demand , which you have just stated , and it not being conceded , you will come again . "
289974	289978	289980	289980	mademoiselle	406	" And again , "
289988	290008	289980	289980	mademoiselle	406	" And yet again . And yet again . And many times again . In effect , for ever ! "
290009	290039	289942	289942	her	406	" And not only here , but you will go to Mr. Snagsby 's too , perhaps ? That visit not succeeding either , you will go again perhaps ? "
290040	290044	290046	290046	mademoiselle	406	" And again , "
290052	290072	290046	290046	mademoiselle	406	" And yet again . And yet again . And many times again . In effect , for ever ! "
290073	290114	290115	290115	She	406	" Very well . Now , Mademoiselle Hortense , let me recommend you to take the candle and pick up that money of yours . I think you will find it behind the clerk 's partition in the corner yonder . "
290131	290138	290125	290125	her	406	" You will not , eh ? "
290139	290146	289942	289942	her	406	" No , I will not ! "
290147	290256	290046	290046	mademoiselle	406	" So much the poorer you ; so much the richer I ! Look , mistress , this is the key of my wine - cellar . It is a large key , but the keys of prisons are larger . In this city there are houses of correction where the treadmills are , for women , the gates of which are very strong and heavy , and no doubt the keys too . I am afraid a lady of your spirit and activity would find it an inconvenience to have one of those keys turned upon her for any length of time . What do you think ? "
290257	290261	290262	290262	mademoiselle	406	" I think , "
290275	290283	290262	290262	mademoiselle	406	" that you are a miserable wretch . "
290284	290287	290289	290290	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Probably , "
290297	290318	290294	290294	his	271	" But I do n't ask what you think of myself ; I ask what you think of the prison . "
290319	290329	290262	290262	mademoiselle	406	" Nothing . What does it matter to me ? "
290330	290340	290342	290343	the lawyer	1047	" Why , it matters this much , mistress , "
290355	290422	290423	290423	Illustrating	627	" the law is so despotic here that it interferes to prevent any of our good English citizens from being troubled , even by a lady 's visits against his desire . And on his complaining that he is so troubled , it takes hold of the troublesome lady and shuts her up in prison under hard discipline . Turns the key upon her , mistress . "
290430	290433	290435	290435	mademoiselle	406	" Truly ? "
290442	290461	290435	290435	mademoiselle	406	" That is droll ! But - my faith ! - still what does it matter to me ? "
290462	290467	290469	290470	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" My fair friend , "
290472	290489	290469	290470	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" make another visit here , or at Mr. Snagsby 's , and you shall learn . "
290490	290504	290435	290435	mademoiselle	406	" In that case you will send me to the prison , perhaps ? "
290505	290508	290435	290435	mademoiselle	406	" Perhaps . "
290547	290554	290556	290557	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" In a word , mistress , "
290559	290618	290556	290557	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" I am sorry to be unpolite , but if you ever present yourself uninvited here - or there - again , I will give you over to the police . Their gallantry is great , but they carry troublesome people through the streets in an ignominious manner , strapped down on a board , my good wench . "
290619	290625	290627	290627	mademoiselle	406	" I will prove you , "
290634	290645	290627	290627	mademoiselle	406	" I will try if you dare to do it ! "
290646	290650	290652	290653	the lawyer	1047	" And if , "
290658	290686	290652	290653	the lawyer	1047	" I place you in that good condition of being locked up in jail , it will be some time before you find yourself at liberty again . "
290687	290693	290695	290695	mademoiselle	406	" I will prove you , "
290701	290705	290707	290708	the lawyer	1047	" And now , "
290715	290729	290707	290708	the lawyer	1047	" you had better go . Think twice before you come here again . "
290730	290734	290735	290735	she	406	" Think you , "
290738	290744	290735	290735	she	406	" twice two hundred times ! "
290745	290756	290757	290758	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" You were dismissed by your lady , you know , "
290768	290813	290814	290814	She	406	" as the most implacable and unmanageable of women . Now turn over a new leaf and take warning by what I say to you . For what I say , I mean ; and what I threaten , I will do , mistress . "
291345	291353	291354	291354	he	10304	" Rick is mistaken , my dear , "
291360	291387	291354	291354	he	10304	" Well , well ! We have all been mistaken over and over again . We must trust to you and time to set him right . "
291576	291585	291587	291588	my guardian	10304	" So that it is even more mischievous , "
291593	291607	291587	291588	my guardian	10304	" to remonstrate with the poor dear fellow than to leave him alone . "
291628	291631	291633	291634	my guardian	10304	" Adviser ! "
291638	291648	291633	291634	my guardian	10304	" My dear , who would advise with Skimpole ? "
291649	291659	291661	291661	I.	0	" Encourager would perhaps have been a better word , "
291662	291665	291667	291668	my guardian	10304	" Encourager ! "
291671	291679	291667	291668	my guardian	10304	" Who could be encouraged by Skimpole ? "
291680	291684	291685	291685	I	0	" Not Richard ? "
291688	291691	291692	291692	he	10304	" No , "
291695	291744	291692	291692	he	10304	" Such an unworldly , uncalculating , gossamer creature is a relief to him and an amusement . But as to advising or encouraging or occupying a serious station towards anybody or anything , it is simply not to be thought of in such a child as Skimpole . "
291745	291751	291753	291753	Ada	610	" Pray , cousin John , "
291767	291775	291753	291753	Ada	610	" what made him such a child ? "
291776	291784	291786	291787	my guardian	10304	" What made him such a child ? "
291799	291805	291786	291787	my guardian	10304	" Yes , cousin John . "
291806	291809	291810	291810	he	10304	" Why , "
291821	291895	291897	291898	my guardian	10304	" he is all sentiment , and - and susceptibility , and - and sensibility , and - and imagination . And these qualities are not regulated in him , somehow . I suppose the people who admired him for them in his youth attached too much importance to them and too little to any training that would have balanced and adjusted them , and so he became what he is . Hey ? "
291908	291917	291918	291918	Ada	610	" What do you think , you two ? "
291939	291948	291925	291925	she	610	" So it is , so it is , "
291954	291975	291925	291925	she	610	" That must not be . We must arrange that . I must prevent it . That will never do . "
292002	292006	292017	292017	his	10304	" Did he ? "
292020	292097	292017	292017	his	10304	" But there you have the man . There you have the man ! There is nothing mercenary in that with him . He has no idea of the value of money . He introduces Rick , and then he is good friends with Mr. Vholes and borrows five pounds of him . He means nothing by it and thinks nothing of it . He told you himself , I 'll be bound , my dear ? "
292098	292103	292105	292105	I.	6695	" Oh , yes ! "
292106	292109	292111	292112	my guardian	10304	" Exactly ! "
292117	292204	292111	292112	my guardian	10304	" There you have the man ! If he had meant any harm by it or was conscious of any harm in it , he would n't tell it . He tells it as he does it in mere simplicity . But you shall see him in his own home , and then you 'll understand him better . We must pay a visit to Harold Skimpole and caution him on these points . Lord bless you , my dears , an infant , an infant ! "
292720	292728	292729	292729	he	326	" Here I am , you see ! "
292751	292826	292729	292729	he	326	" Here I am ! This is my frugal breakfast . Some men want legs of beef and mutton for breakfast ; I do n't . Give me my peach , my cup of coffee , and my claret ; I am content . I do n't want them for themselves , but they remind me of the sun . There 's nothing solar about legs of beef and mutton . Mere animal satisfaction ! "
292827	292851	292853	292854	my guardian	10304	" This is our friend 's consulting - room or would be , if he ever prescribed , his sanctum , his studio , "
292858	292861	292863	292864	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Yes , "
292872	292908	292909	292909	He	326	" this is the bird 's cage . This is where the bird lives and sings . They pluck his feathers now and then and clip his wings , but he sings , he sings ! "
292921	292935	292909	292909	He	326	" He sings ! Not an ambitious note , but still he sings . "
292936	292942	292944	292945	my guardian	10304	" These are very fine , "
292947	292951	292944	292945	my guardian	10304	" A present ? "
292952	292955	292956	292956	he	326	" No , "
292959	293025	292956	292956	he	326	" No ! Some amiable gardener sells them . His man wanted to know , when he brought them last evening , whether he should wait for the money . ' Really , my friend , ' I said , ' I think not - if your time is of any value to you . ' I suppose it was , for he went away . "
293041	293052	293037	293037	he	10304	" Is it possible to be worldly with this baby ? "
293053	293059	293061	293062	Mr. Skimpole	326	" This is a day , "
293073	293135	293136	293136	He	326	" that will ever be remembered here . We shall call it Saint Clare and Saint Summerson day . You must see my daughters . I have a blue - eyed daughter who is my Beauty daughter , I have a Sentiment daughter , and I have a Comedy daughter . You must see them all . They 'll be enchanted . "
293165	293170	293171	293171	he	326	" My dear Jarndyce , "
293181	293240	293171	293171	he	326	" as many moments as you please . Time is no object here . We never know what o'clock it is , and we never care . Not the way to get on in life , you 'll tell me ? Certainly . But we DON'T get on in life . We do n't pretend to do it . "
293251	293256	293241	293242	My guardian	10304	" You hear him ? "
293257	293262	293263	293263	he	326	" Now , Harold , "
293266	293277	293263	293263	he	326	" the word I have to say relates to Rick . "
293278	293285	293287	293288	Mr. Skimpole	326	" The dearest friend I have ! "
293291	293351	293287	293288	Mr. Skimpole	326	" I suppose he ought not to be my dearest friend , as he is not on terms with you . But he is , I ca n't help it ; he is full of youthful poetry , and I love him . If you do n't like it , I ca n't help it . I love him . "
293381	293394	293396	293397	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" You are welcome to love him as much as you like , "
293399	293409	293396	293397	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" but we must save his pocket , Harold . "
293410	293413	293415	293416	Mr. Skimpole	326	" Oh ! "
293418	293433	293415	293416	Mr. Skimpole	326	" His pocket ? Now you are coming to what I do n't understand . "
293471	293481	293448	293448	he	326	" If you go with him here or there , "
293487	293497	293448	293448	he	326	" you must not let him pay for both . "
293498	293503	293505	293506	Mr. Skimpole	326	" My dear Jarndyce , "
293519	293649	293508	293508	his	326	" what am I to do ? If he takes me anywhere , I must go . And how can I pay ? I never have any money . If I had any money , I do n't know anything about it . Suppose I say to a man , how much ? Suppose the man says to me seven and sixpence ? I know nothing about seven and sixpence . It is impossible for me to pursue the subject with any consideration for the man . I do n't go about asking busy people what seven and sixpence is in Moorish - which I do n't understand . Why should I go about asking them what seven and sixpence is in Money - which I do n't understand ? "
293650	293653	293655	293656	my guardian	10304	" Well , "
293667	293702	293655	293656	my guardian	10304	" if you come to any kind of journeying with Rick , you must borrow the money of me never breathing the least allusion to that circumstance , and leave the calculation to him . "
293703	293708	293710	293711	Mr. Skimpole	326	" My dear Jarndyce , "
293713	293802	293710	293711	Mr. Skimpole	326	" I will do anything to give you pleasure , but it seems an idle form - a superstition . Besides , I give you my word , Miss Clare and my dear Miss Summerson , I thought Mr. Carstone was immensely rich . I thought he had only to make over something , or to sign a bond , or a draft , or a cheque , or a bill , or to put something on a file somewhere , to bring down a shower of money . "
293803	293812	293814	293814	Ada	294	" Indeed it is not so , sir , "
293816	293821	293814	293814	Ada	294	" He is poor . "
293822	293827	293829	293830	Mr. Skimpole	326	" No , really ? "
293836	293841	293832	293832	his	326	" You surprise me . "
293854	293874	293829	293830	Mr. Skimpole	326	" said my guardian , laying his hand emphatically on the sleeve of Mr. Skimpole 's dressing - gown , "
293889	293890	293887	293887	Harold	326	" "
293896	293901	293887	293887	Harold	326	" returned Mr. Skimpole , "
293987	294207	293982	293982	I	0	" The helpless kind of candour with which he presented this before us , the light - hearted manner in which he was amused by his innocence , the fantastic way in which he took himself under his own protection and argued about that curious person , combined with the delightful ease of everything he said exactly to make out my guardian 's case . The more I saw of him , the more unlikely it seemed to me , when he was present , that he could design , conceal , or influence anything ; and yet the less likely that appeared when he was not present , and the less agreeable it was to think of his having anything to do with any one for whom I cared . Hearing that his examination as he called it was now over , Mr. Skimpole left the room with a radiant face to fetch his daughters his sons had run away at various times , leaving my guardian quite delighted by the manner in which he had vindicated his childish character . He soon came back , bringing with him the three young ladies and Mrs. Skimpole , who had once been a beauty but was now a delicate high - nosed invalid suffering under a complication of disorders . "
294210	294215	293982	293982	I	0	" said Mr. Skimpole , "
294287	294335	294265	294265	We	6736	" Mrs. Skimpole sighed , I thought , as if she would have been glad to strike out this item in the family attainments . I also thought that she rather impressed her sigh upon my guardian and that she took every opportunity of throwing in another . "
294340	294357	294265	294265	We	6736	" said Mr. Skimpole , turning his sprightly eyes from one to the other of us , "
294383	294408	294409	294409	My	0	" The daughters , who appeared to be very fond of him , were amused by this droll fact , particularly the Comedy daughter . "
294416	294421	294409	294409	My	0	" said Mr. Skimpole , "
294575	294593	294594	294594	We	6736	" He laughed , but as usual seemed quite candid and really to mean what he said . "
294601	294615	294594	294594	We	6736	" said Mr. Skimpole , ' sympathy for everything . Have we not ? "
294616	294623	294625	294627	the three daughters	6745	" Oh , yes , papa ! "
294629	294639	294641	294642	Mr. Skimpole	326	" In fact , that is our family department , "
294644	294791	294641	294642	Mr. Skimpole	326	" in this hurly - burly of life . We are capable of looking on and of being interested , and we DO look on , and we ARE interested . What more can we do ? Here is my Beauty daughter , married these three years . Now I dare say her marrying another child , and having two more , was all wrong in point of political economy , but it was very agreeable . We had our little festivities on those occasions and exchanged social ideas . She brought her young husband home one day , and they and their young fledglings have their nest upstairs . I dare say at some time or other Sentiment and Comedy will bring THEIR husbands home and have THEIR nests upstairs too . So we get on , we do n't know how , but somehow . "
295008	295012	295013	295013	he	326	" My roses , "
295020	295075	295013	295013	he	326	" take care of mama . She is poorly to - day . By going home with Mr. Jarndyce for a day or two , I shall hear the larks sing and preserve my amiability . It has been tried , you know , and would be tried again if I remained at home . "
295076	295081	295083	295085	the Comedy daughter	15277	" That bad man ! "
295087	295109	295110	295110	Laura	442	" At the very time when he knew papa was lying ill by his wallflowers , looking at the blue sky , "
295113	295125	295127	295127	Arethusa	631	" And when the smell of hay was in the air ! "
295129	295140	295127	295127	Arethusa	631	" It showed a want of poetry in the man , "
295151	295176	295177	295177	he	326	" It was coarse . There was an absence of the finer touches of humanity in it ! My daughters have taken great offence , "
295182	295188	295177	295177	he	326	" at an honest man - "
295189	295197	295198	295198	they	6759	" Not honest , papa . Impossible ! "
295203	295219	295221	295222	Mr. Skimpole	326	" At a rough kind of fellow - a sort of human hedgehog rolled up , "
295224	295545	295547	295548	Mr. Skimpole	326	" who is a baker in this neighbourhood and from whom we borrowed a couple of arm - chairs . We wanted a couple of arm- chairs , and we had n't got them , and therefore of course we looked to a man who HAD got them , to lend them . Well ! This morose person lent them , and we wore them out . When they were worn out , he wanted them back . He had them back . He was contented , you will say . Not at all . He objected to their being worn . I reasoned with him , and pointed out his mistake . I said , ' Can you , at your time of life , be so headstrong , my friend , as to persist that an arm - chair is a thing to put upon a shelf and look at ? That it is an object to contemplate , to survey from a distance , to consider from a point of sight ? Do n't you KNOW that these arm - chairs were borrowed to be sat upon ? ' He was unreasonable and unpersuadable and used intemperate language . Being as patient as I am at this minute , I addressed another appeal to him . I said , ' Now , my good man , however our business capacities may vary , we are all children of one great mother , Nature . On this blooming summer morning here you see me ' I was on the sofa ' with flowers before me , fruit upon the table , the cloudless sky above me , the air full of fragrance , contemplating Nature . I entreat you , by our common brotherhood , not to interpose between me and a subject so sublime , the absurd figure of an angry baker ! ' But he did , "
295558	295596	295547	295548	Mr. Skimpole	326	" he did interpose that ridiculous figure , and he does , and he will again . And therefore I am very glad to get out of his way and to go home with my friend Jarndyce . "
295970	295975	295976	295977	The visitor	10509	" Sir Leicester Dedlock ! "
296065	296073	296052	296053	my guardian	10304	" Pray be seated , Sir Leicester . "
296074	296078	296080	296081	Sir Leicester	268	" Mr. Jarndyce , "
296091	296101	296080	296081	Sir Leicester	268	" I do myself the honour of calling here - "
296102	296112	296052	296053	my guardian	10304	" You do ME the honour , Sir Leicester . "
296113	296204	296052	296053	my guardian	10304	" Thank you - of calling here on my road from Lincolnshire to express my regret that any cause of complaint , however strong , that I may have against a gentleman who - who is known to you and has been your host , and to whom therefore I will make no farther reference , should have prevented you , still more ladies under your escort and charge , from seeing whatever little there may be to gratify a polite and refined taste at my house , Chesney Wold . "
296205	296233	296052	296053	my guardian	10304	" You are exceedingly obliging , Sir Leicester , and on behalf of those ladies who are present and for myself , I thank you very much . "
296234	296344	296345	296346	My guardian	10304	" It is possible , Mr. Jarndyce , that the gentleman to whom , for the reasons I have mentioned , I refrain from making further allusion - it is possible , Mr. Jarndyce , that that gentleman may have done me the honour so far to misapprehend my character as to induce you to believe that you would not have been received by my local establishment in Lincolnshire with that urbanity , that courtesy , which its members are instructed to show to all ladies and gentlemen who present themselves at that house . I merely beg to observe , sir , that the fact is the reverse . "
296357	296367	296345	296346	My guardian	10304	" It has given me pain , Mr. Jarndyce , "
296373	296466	296368	296369	Sir Leicester	268	" I assure you , sir , it has given - me - pain - to learn from the housekeeper at Chesney Wold that a gentleman who was in your company in that part of the county , and who would appear to possess a cultivated taste for the fine arts , was likewise deterred by some such cause from examining the family pictures with that leisure , that attention , that care , which he might have desired to bestow upon them and which some of them might possibly have repaid . "
296489	296508	296468	296468	he	268	" Mr. Hirrold - Herald - Harold - Skampling - Skumpling - I beg your pardon - Skimpole . "
296509	296516	296518	296519	my guardian	10304	" This is Mr. Harold Skimpole , "
296524	296527	296529	296530	Sir Leicester	268	" Oh ! "
296532	296579	296529	296530	Sir Leicester	268	" I am happy to meet Mr. Skimpole and to have the opportunity of tendering my personal regrets . I hope , sir , that when you again find yourself in my part of the county , you will be under no similar sense of restraint . "
296580	296619	296621	296622	Mr. Skimpole	326	" You are very obliging , Sir Leicester Dedlock . So encouraged , I shall certainly give myself the pleasure and advantage of another visit to your beautiful house . The owners of such places as Chesney Wold , "
296631	296677	296621	296622	Mr. Skimpole	326	" are public benefactors . They are good enough to maintain a number of delightful objects for the admiration and pleasure of us poor men ; and not to reap all the admiration and pleasure that they yield is to be ungrateful to our benefactors . "
296688	296694	296678	296679	Sir Leicester	268	" An artist , sir ? "
296695	296698	296700	296701	Mr. Skimpole	326	" No , "
296703	296713	296714	296715	Sir Leicester	268	" A perfectly idle man . A mere amateur . "
296755	296760	296749	296749	himself	326	" Mr. Skimpole mentioned , "
296772	296796	296766	296766	himself	268	" mentioned to the housekeeper , who , as he may have observed , is an old and attached retainer of the family - "
296797	296826	296827	296828	Mr. Skimpole	326	" That is , when I walked through the house the other day , on the occasion of my going down to visit Miss Summerson and Miss Clare , "
296834	296851	296827	296828	Mr. Skimpole	326	" - That the friend with whom he had formerly been staying there was Mr. Jarndyce . "
296862	296938	296852	296853	Sir Leicester	268	" And hence I became aware of the circumstance for which I have professed my regret . That this should have occurred to any gentleman , Mr. Jarndyce , but especially a gentleman formerly known to Lady Dedlock , and indeed claiming some distant connexion with her , and for whom as I learn from my Lady herself she entertains a high respect , does , I assure you , give - me - pain . "
296939	296950	296952	296953	my guardian	10304	" Pray say no more about it , Sir Leicester , "
296955	296987	296952	296953	my guardian	10304	" I am very sensible , as I am sure we all are , of your consideration . Indeed the mistake was mine , and I ought to apologize for it . "
297082	297091	297093	297094	Sir Leicester	268	" I mentioned the subject to Lady Dedlock , "
297098	297202	297093	297094	Sir Leicester	268	" and my Lady informed me that she had had the pleasure of exchanging a few words with Mr. Jarndyce and his wards on the occasion of an accidental meeting during their sojourn in the vicinity . Permit me , Mr. Jarndyce , to repeat to yourself , and to these ladies , the assurance I have already tendered to Mr. Skimpole . Circumstances undoubtedly prevent my saying that it would afford me any gratification to hear that Mr. Boythorn had favoured my house with his presence , but those circumstances are confined to that gentleman himself and do not extend beyond him . "
297203	297212	297214	297215	Mr. Skimpole	326	" You know my old opinion of him , "
297222	297235	297214	297215	Mr. Skimpole	326	" An amiable bull who is determined to make every colour scarlet ! "
297467	297475	297452	297452	I	0	" May I come in , guardian ? "
297476	297487	297452	297452	I	0	" Surely , little woman . What 's the matter ? "
297488	297513	297514	297514	He	10304	" Nothing is the matter . I thought I would like to take this quiet time of saying a word to you about myself . "
297577	297586	297588	297588	he	10304	" What concerns you , my dear Esther , "
297590	297609	297588	297588	he	10304	" concerns us all . You can not be more ready to speak than I am to hear . "
297610	297643	297644	297644	He	10304	" I know that , guardian . But I have such need of your advice and support . Oh ! You do n't know how much need I have to - night . "
297659	297671	297673	297673	I	0	" Or how anxious I have been to speak to you , "
297675	297686	297673	297673	I	0	" ever since the visitor was here to - day . "
297687	297698	297722	297722	I	0	" The visitor , my dear ! Sir Leicester Dedlock ? "
297699	297702	297703	297703	He	10304	" Yes . "
297736	297741	297743	297743	he	10304	" Why , Esther , "
297750	297770	297743	297743	he	10304	" our visitor and you are the two last persons on earth I should have thought of connecting together ! "
297771	297792	297797	297797	his	10304	" Oh , yes , guardian , I know it . And I too , but a little while ago . "
297831	297834	297836	297836	I	0	" Guardian , "
297838	297863	297836	297836	I	0	" do you remensher , when we were overtaken by the thunder - storm , Lady Dedlock 's speaking to you of her sister ? "
297864	297873	297907	297907	His	10304	" Of course . Of course I do . "
297874	297892	297836	297836	I	0	" And reminding you that she and her sister had differed , had gone their several ways ? "
297893	297897	297836	297836	I	0	" Of course . "
297898	297906	297907	297907	His	10304	" Why did they separate , guardian ? "
297917	297984	297907	297907	His	10304	" My child , what questions are these ! I never knew . No one but themselves ever did know , I believe . Who could tell what the secrets of those two handsome and proud women were ! You have seen Lady Dedlock . If you had ever seen her sister , you would know her to have been as resolute and haughty as she . "
297985	298000	297836	297836	I	0	" Oh , guardian , I have seen her many and many a time ! "
298001	298005	298006	298006	He	6801	" Seen her ? "
298015	298082	298006	298006	He	6801	" Then , Esther , when you spoke to me long ago of Boythorn , and when I told you that he was all but married once , and that the lady did not die , but died to him , and that that time had had its influence on his later life - did you know it all , and know who the lady was ? "
298083	298088	298089	298089	I	0	" No , guardian , "
298102	298109	298089	298089	I	0	" Nor do I know yet . "
298110	298116	298006	298006	He	6801	" Lady Dedlock 's sister . "
298117	298121	298006	298006	He	6801	" And why , "
298128	298141	298122	298122	I	0	" why , guardian , pray tell me why were THEY parted ? "
298142	298305	298006	298006	He	6801	" It was her act , and she kept its motives in her inflexible heart . He afterwards did conjecture but it was mere conjecture that some injury which her haughty spirit had received in her cause of quarrel with her sister had wounded her beyond all reason , but she wrote him that from the date of that letter she died to him - as in literal truth she did - and that the resolution was exacted from her by her knowledge of his proud temper and his strained sense of honour , which were both her nature too . In consideration for those master points in him , and even in consideration for them in herself , she made the sacrifice , she said , and would live in it and die in it . She did both , I fear ; certainly he never saw her , never heard of her from that hour . Nor did any one . "
298306	298316	298317	298317	I	0	" Oh , guardian , what have I done ! "
298326	298334	298317	298317	I	0	" what sorrow have I innocently caused ! "
298335	298341	298006	298006	He	6801	" You caused , Esther ? "
298342	298361	298317	298317	I	0	" Yes , guardian . Innocently , but most surely . That secluded sister is my first remembrance . "
298362	298367	298368	298368	he	6802	" No , no ! "
298373	298387	298368	298368	he	6802	" Yes , guardian , yes ! And HER sister is my mother ! "
298750	298756	298758	298758	he	10304	" Nor do I understand , "
298760	298779	298758	298758	he	10304	" that any doubts tend towards you , my dear . Much suspicion may exist without that connexion . "
298780	298785	298786	298786	I	0	" With the lawyer , "
298789	298843	298758	298758	he	10304	" But two other persons have come into my mind since I have been anxious . Then I told him all about Mr. Guppy , who I feared might have had his vague surmises when I little understood his meaning , but in whose silence after our last interview I expressed perfect confidence . "
298846	298851	298758	298758	he	10304	" said my guardian . "
298866	298887	298898	298901	a more alarming person	6813	" I called to his recollection the French maid and the eager offer of herself she had made to me . "
298890	298895	298898	298901	a more alarming person	6813	" he returned thoughtfully . "
298961	298962	298956	298956	She	6816	" "
298968	298971	298963	298963	Her	6816	" said I. "
299003	299008	298980	298980	she	6816	" said my guardian . "

299104	299107	299099	299099	guardian	1915	" said I. "
299174	299250	299251	299251	My	0	" I thanked him with my whole heart . What could I ever do but thank him ! I was going out at the door when he asked me to stay a moment . Quickly turning round , I saw that same expression on his face again ; and all at once , I do n't know how , it flashed upon me as a new and far - off possibility that I understood it . "
299255	299260	299251	299251	My	0	" said my guardian , "

299347	299355	299314	299314	you	283	" said he with his cheery smile , "
299387	299394	299431	299431	I	0	" I answered in all earnestness , "
299397	299429	299431	299431	I	0	" With the strictest truth , for his momentary hesitation was gone it had not lasted a minute , and his fine , sensible , cordial , sterling manner was restored . "
299456	299476	299443	299443	I	0	" said he with his bright clear eyes on mine . I answered , most assuredly he did not . "
299493	299494	299491	299491	Esther	283	" "
299498	299506	299491	299491	Esther	283	" said I with my whole heart . "

299522	299569	299519	299519	your	1569	" He took it in his , holding me lightly with his arm , and looking down into my face with the same genuine freshness and faithfulness of manner - the old protecting manner which had made that house my home in a moment - said , "
299605	299606	299593	299593	you	283	" "
299621	299622	299613	299613	you	283	" "
299625	299629	299613	299613	you	283	" said he , "
299638	299639	299613	299613	you	283	" "
299646	299647	299650	299650	Esther	283	" "
299652	299660	299650	299650	Esther	283	" said he with a gentle seriousness , "
299702	299703	299692	299692	you	283	" "
299711	299715	299708	299708	I	0	" I said . "
299720	299724	299708	299708	I	0	" he answered . "
299845	299846	299847	299847	Guardian	353	" "
299849	299853	299847	299847	Guardian	353	" said I , "
299884	299933	299876	299876	I	0	" He shook my hand and said no more . Nor was any more said in reference to this conversation , either by him or me , through the whole week . When the appointed night came , I said to Charley as soon as I was alone , "
299959	300020	299947	299947	you	327	" Charley went up the stairs , and down the stairs , and along the passages - the zig- zag way about the old - fashioned house seemed very long in my listening ears that night - and so came back , along the passages , and down the stairs , and up the stairs , and brought the letter . "
300029	301132	300027	300027	Charley	327	" said I. So Charley laid it on the table and went to bed , and I sat looking at it without taking it up , thinking of many things . I began with my overshadowed childhood , and passed through those timid days to the heavy time when my aunt lay dead , with her resolute face so cold and set , and when I was more solitary with Mrs. Rachael than if I had had no one in the world to speak to or to look at . I passed to the altered days when I was so blest as to find friends in all around me , and to be beloved . I came to the time when I first saw my dear girl and was received into that sisterly affection which was the grace and beauty of my life . I recalled the first bright gleam of welcome which had shone out of those very windows upon our expectant faces on that cold bright night , and which had never paled . I lived my happy life there over again , I went through my illness and recovery , I thought of myself so altered and of those around me so unchanged ; and all this happiness shone like a light from one central figure , represented before me by the letter on the table . I opened it and read it . It was so impressive in its love for me , and in the unselfish caution it gave me , and the consideration it showed for me in every word , that my eyes were too often blinded to read much at a time . But I read it through three times before I laid it down . I had thought beforehand that I knew its purport , and I did . It asked me , would I be the mistress of Bleak House . It was not a love letter , though it expressed so much love , but was written just as he would at any time have spoken to me . I saw his face , and heard his voice , and felt the influence of his kind protecting manner in every line . It addressed me as if our places were reversed , as if all the good deeds had been mine and all the feelings they had awakened his . It dwelt on my being young , and he past the prime of life ; on his having attained a ripe age , while I was a child ; on his writing to me with a silvered head , and knowing all this so well as to set it in full before me for mature deliberation . It told me that I would gain nothing by such a marriage and lose nothing by rejecting it , for no new relation could enhance the tenderness in which he held me , and whatever my decision was , he was certain it would be right . But he had considered this step anew since our late confidence and had decided on taking it , if it only served to show me through one poor instance that the whole world would readily unite to falsify the stern prediction of my childhood . I was the last to know what happiness I could bestow upon him , but of that he said no more , for I was always to remember that I owed him nothing and that he was my debtor , and for very much . He had often thought of our future , and foreseeing that the time must come , and fearing that it might come soon , when Ada now very nearly of age would leave us , and when our present mode of life must be broken up , had become accustomed to reflect on this proposal . Thus he made it . If I felt that I could ever give him the best right he could have to be my protector , and if I felt that I could happily and justly become the dear companion of his remaining life , superior to all lighter chances and changes than death , even then he could not have me bind myself irrevocably while this letter was yet so new to me , but even then I must have ample time for reconsideration . In that case , or in the opposite case , let him be unchanged in his old relation , in his old manner , in the old name by which I called him . And as to his bright Dame Durden and little housekeeper , she would ever be the same , he knew . This was the substance of the letter , written throughout with a justice and a dignity as if he were indeed my responsible guardian impartially representing the proposal of a friend against whom in his integrity he stated the full case . But he did not hint to me that when I had been better looking he had had this same proceeding in his thoughts and had refrained from it . That when my old face was gone from me , and I had no attractions , he could love me just as well as in my fairer days . That the discovery of my birth gave him no shock . That his generosity rose above my disfigurement and my inheritance of shame . That the more I stood in need of such fidelity , the more firmly I might trust in him to the last . But I knew it , I knew it well now . It came upon me as the close of the benignant history I had been pursuing , and I felt that I had but one thing to do . To devote my life to his happiness was to thank him poorly , and what had I wished for the other night but some new means of thanking him ? Still I cried very much , not only in the fullness of my heart after reading the letter , not only in the strangeness of the prospect - for it was strange though I had expected the contents - but as if something for which there was no name or distinct idea were indefinitely lost to me . I was very happy , very thankful , very hopeful ; but I cried very much . By and by I went to my old glass . My eyes were red and swollen , and I said , "
301144	301175	301142	301142	you	283	" I am afraid the face in the glass was going to cry again at this reproach , but I held up my finger at it , and it stopped . "
301199	301210	301192	301192	you	283	" said I , beginning to let down my hair . "
301249	301283	301241	301241	us	6833	" I went on with my hair now , quite comfortably . I sobbed a little still , but that was because I had been crying , not because I was crying then . "
301333	301538	301541	301541	you	6839	" I thought , all at once , if my guardian had married some one else , how should I have felt , and what should I have done ! That would have been a change indeed . It presented my life in such a new and blank form that I rang my housekeeping keys and gave them a kiss before I laid them down in their basket again . Then I went on to think , as I dressed my hair before the glass , how often had I considered within myself that the deep traces of my illness and the circumstances of my birth were only new reasons why I should be busy , busy , busy - useful , amiable , serviceable , in all honest , unpretending ways . This was a good time , to be sure , to sit down morbidly and cry ! As to its seeming at all strange to me at first if that were any excuse for crying , which it was not that I was one day to be the mistress of Bleak House , why should it seem strange ? Other people had thought of such things , if I had not . "
301548	301558	301541	301541	you	6839	" I asked myself , looking at the glass , "
301572	302073	301560	301561	Mrs. Woodcourt	481	" Perhaps the name brought them to my remembrance . The dried remains of the flowers . It would be better not to keep them now . They had only been preserved in memory of something wholly past and gone , but it would be better not to keep them now . They were in a book , and it happened to be in the next room - our sitting - room , dividing Ada 's chamber from mine . I took a candle and went softly in to fetch it from its shelf . After I had it in my hand , I saw my beautiful darling , through the open door , lying asleep , and I stole in to kiss her . It was weak in me , I know , and I could have no reason for crying ; but I dropped a tear upon her dear face , and another , and another . Weaker than that , I took the withered flowers out and put them for a moment to her lips . I thought about her love for Richard , though , indeed , the flowers had nothing to do with that . Then I took them into my own room and burned them at the candle , and they were dust in an instant . On entering the breakfast - room next morning , I found my guardian just as usual , quite as frank , as open , and free . There being not the least constraint in his manner , there was none or I think there was none in mine . I was with him several times in the course of the morning , in and out , when there was no one there , and I thought it not unlikely that he might speak to me about the letter , but he did not say a word . So , on the next morning , and the next , and for at least a week , over which time Mr. Skimpole prolonged his stay . I expected , every day , that my guardian might speak to me about the letter , but he never did . I thought then , growing uneasy , that I ought to write an answer . I tried over and over again in my own room at night , but I could not write an answer that at all began like a good answer , so I thought each night I would wait one more day . And I waited seven more days , and he never said a word . At last , Mr. Skimpole having departed , we three were one afternoon going out for a ride ; and I , being dressed before Ada and going down , came upon my guardian , with his back towards me , standing at the drawing - room window looking out . He turned on my coming in and said , smiling , "
302086	302114	302078	302078	you	6841	" and looked out again . I had made up my mind to speak to him now . In short , I had come down on purpose . "
302117	302126	302115	302115	Guardian	1915	" I said , rather hesitating and trembling , "
302142	302143	302129	302129	you	1915	" "
302152	302156	302157	302157	I	0	" he replied . "
302163	302166	302157	302157	I	0	" said I. "
302173	302178	302168	302168	Charley	327	" he asked pleasantly . "
302189	302381	302187	302187	guardian	1915	" I returned . I put my two arms round his neck and kissed him , and he said was this the mistress of Bleak House , and I said yes ; and it made no difference presently , and we all went out together , and I said nothing to my precious pet about it . CHAPTER XLV In Trust One morning when I had done jingling about with my baskets of keys , as my beauty and I were walking round and round the garden I happened to turn my eyes towards the house and saw a long thin shadow going in which looked like Mr. Vholes . Ada had been telling me only that morning of her hopes that Richard might exhaust his ardour in the Chancery suit by being so very earnest in it ; and therefore , not to damp my dear girl 's spirits , I said nothing about Mr. Vholes 's shadow . Presently came Charley , lightly winding among the bushes and tripping along the paths , as rosy and pretty as one of Flora 's attendants instead of my maid , saying , "
302399	302456	302391	302391	you	6846	" It was one of Charley 's peculiarities that whenever she was charged with a message she always began to deliver it as soon as she beheld , at any distance , the person for whom it was intended . Therefore I saw Charley asking me in her usual form of words to ' step and speak "
302536	302552	302514	302514	Charley	327	" Yes , miss . Him as come down in the country with Mr. Richard . "
302651	302660	302662	302663	my guardian	10304	" You know Mr. Vholes , my dear , "
302716	302720	302722	302723	my guardian	10304	" Mr. Vholes , "
302739	302751	302722	302723	my guardian	10304	" has brought an ugly report of our most unfortunate Rick . "
302757	302760	302722	302723	my guardian	10304	" most unfortunate "
302806	302823	302825	302826	my guardian	10304	" And as Rick and you are happily good friends , I should like to know , "
302828	302852	302825	302826	my guardian	10304	" what you think , my dear . Would you be so good as to - as to speak up , Mr. Vholes ? "
302862	303057	302858	302859	Mr. Vholes	248	" I have been saying that I have reason to know , Miss Summerson , as Mr. C. 's professional adviser , that Mr. C. 's circumstances are at the present moment in an embarrassed state . Not so much in point of amount as owing to the peculiar and pressing nature of liabilities Mr. C. has incurred and the means he has of liquidating or meeting the same . I have staved off many little matters for Mr. C. , but there is a limit to staving off , and we have reached it . I have made some advances out of pocket to accommodate these unpleasantnesses , but I necessarily look to being repaid , for I do not pretend to be a man of capital , and I have a father to support in the Vale of Taunton , besides striving to realize some little independence for three dear girls at home . My apprehension is , Mr. C. 's circumstances being such , lest it should end in his obtaining leave to part with his commission , which at all events is desirable to be made known to his connexions . "
303095	303106	303108	303109	my guardian	10304	" Imagine the poor fellow without even his present resource , "
303113	303157	303108	303109	my guardian	10304	" Yet what can I do ? You know him , Esther . He would never accept of help from me now . To offer it or hint at it would be to drive him to an extremity , if nothing else did . "
303165	303334	303336	303337	Mr. Vholes	248	" What Mr. Jarndyce remarks , miss , is no doubt the case , and is the difficulty . I do not see that anything is to be done , I do not say that anything is to be done . Far from it . I merely come down here under the seal of confidence and mention it in order that everything may be openly carried on and that it may not be said afterwards that everything was not openly carried on . My wish is that everything should be openly carried on . I desire to leave a good name behind me . If I consulted merely my own interests with Mr. C. , I should not be here . So insurmountable , as you must well know , would be his objections . This is not a professional attendance . This can he charged to nobody . I have no interest in it except as a member of society and a father - AND a son , "
303495	303500	303502	303503	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Well , sir , "
303505	303541	303502	303503	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" Miss Summerson will communicate with Mr. Carstone , and you can only hope that his position may be yet retrievable . You will allow me to order you lunch after your journey , sir . "
303542	303550	303552	303553	Mr. Vholes	248	" I thank you , Mr. Jarndyce , "
303569	303646	303557	303557	his	248	" not any . I thank you , no , not a morsel . My digestion is much impaired , and I am but a poor knife and fork at any time . If I was to partake of solid food at this period of the day , I do n't know what the consequences might be . Everything having been openly carried on , sir , I will now with your permission take my leave . "
303647	303669	303671	303672	my guardian	10304	" And I would that you could take your leave , and we could all take our leave , Mr. Vholes , "
303675	303683	303684	303685	Mr. Vholes	248	" of a cause you know of . "
303730	303807	303808	303808	I	0	" We whose ambition it is to be looked upon in the light of respectable practitioners , sir , can but put our shoulders to the wheel . We do it , sir . At least , I do it myself ; and I wish to think well of my professional brethren , one and all . You are sensible of an obligation not to refer to me , miss , in communicating with Mr. C. ? "
303819	303836	303837	303838	Mr. Vholes	248	" Just so , miss . Good morning . Mr. Jarndyce , good morning , sir . "
304779	304783	304785	304785	Richard	295	" Now then ! "
304810	304824	304825	304825	He	6905	" Can I come in , Richard ? It 's only Dame Durden . "
304961	304970	304972	304972	he	6905	" Good heaven , my dear little woman , "
304974	304997	304972	304972	he	6905	" how do you come here ? Who could have thought of seeing you ! Nothing the matter ? Ada is well ? "
304998	305008	305019	305019	his	6905	" Quite well . Lovelier than ever , Richard ! "
305009	305012	305013	305013	he	6905	" Ah ! "
305022	305035	305013	305013	he	6905	" My poor cousin ! I was writing to you , Esther . "
305070	305092	305093	305093	I	0	" Have you been at the trouble of writing all that , and am I not to read it after all ? "
305096	305102	305103	305103	he	6905	" Oh , my dear , "
305110	305126	305127	305127	I	0	" You may read it in the whole room . It is all over here . "
305163	305178	305180	305180	he	6905	" Like you , Esther , but useless , and so NOT like you ! "
305186	305249	305180	305180	he	6905	" I am away on leave this day - should have been gone in another hour - and that is to smooth it over , for my selling out . Well ! Let bygones be bygones . So this calling follows the rest . I only want to have been in the church to have made the round of all the professions . "
305250	305253	305254	305254	I	0	" Richard , "
305257	305266	305254	305254	I	0	" it is not so hopeless as that ? "
305267	305270	305271	305271	he	6905	" Esther , "
305274	305362	305363	305363	he	6905	" it is indeed . I am just so near disgrace as that those who are put in authority over me as the catechism goes would far rather be without me than with me . And they are right . Apart from debts and duns and all such drawbacks , I am not fit even for this employment . I have no care , no mind , no heart , no soul , but for one thing . Why , if this bubble had n't broken now , "
305383	305426	305363	305363	he	6905	" how could I have gone abroad ? I must have been ordered abroad , but how could I have gone ? How could I , with my experience of that thing , trust even Vholes unless I was at his back ! "
305466	305598	305599	305599	He	6905	" No , Dame Durden ! Two subjects I forbid - must forbid . The first is John Jarndyce . The second , you know what . Call it madness , and I tell you I ca n't help it now , and ca n't be sane . But it is no such thing ; it is the one object I have to pursue . It is a pity I ever was prevailed upon to turn out of my road for any other . It would be wisdom to abandon it now , after all the time , anxiety , and pains I have bestowed upon it ! Oh , yes , true wisdom . It would be very agreeable , too , to some people ; but I never will . "
305637	305645	305646	305646	he	6905	" Am I to read it now ? "
305762	305775	305776	305776	He	6905	" Of course , Esther , you know what she says here ? "
305791	305796	305776	305776	He	6905	" Yes , Richard . "
305797	305801	305802	305802	he	6905	" Offers me , "
305813	305856	305802	305802	he	6905	" the little inheritance she is certain of so soon - just as little and as much as I have wasted - and begs and prays me to take it , set myself right with it , and remain in the service . "
305857	305871	305873	305873	I.	0	" I know your welfare to be the dearest wish of her heart , "
305874	305890	305873	305873	I.	0	" And , oh , my dear Richard , Ada 's is a noble heart . "
305891	305906	305907	305907	He	6905	" I am sure it is . I - I wish I was dead ! "
305979	306008	306010	306010	he	6905	" And this is the heart that the same John Jarndyce , who is not otherwise to be mentioned between us , stepped in to estrange from me , "
306013	306057	306010	306010	he	6905	" And the dear girl makes me this generous offer from under the same John Jarndyce 's roof , and with the same John Jarndyce 's gracious consent and connivance , I dare say , as a new means of buying me off . "
306058	306061	306062	306062	I	0	" Richard ! "
306069	306080	306062	306062	I	0	" I will not hear you say such shameful words ! "
306130	306151	306120	306120	I	0	" If you please , my dear Richard , do not speak in such a tone to me . Consider ! "
306201	306211	306213	306213	he	6905	" To accept this offer , my dear Esther , "
306224	306345	306213	306213	he	6905	" - once more , pray , pray forgive me ; I am deeply grieved - to accept my dearest cousin 's offer is , I need not say , impossible . Besides , I have letters and papers that I could show you which would convince you it is all over here . I have done with the red coat , believe me . But it is some satisfaction , in the midst of my troubles and perplexities , to know that I am pressing Ada 's interests in pressing my own . Vholes has his shoulder to the wheel , and he can not help urging it on as much for her as for me , thank God ! "
306374	306379	306381	306381	Richard	295	" No , no ! "
306384	306567	306381	306381	Richard	295	" If every farthing of Ada 's little fortune were mine , no part of it should be spent in retaining me in what I am not fit for , can take no interest in , and am weary of . It should be devoted to what promises a better return , and should be used where she has a larger stake . Do n't be uneasy for me ! I shall now have only one thing on my mind , and Vholes and I will work it . I shall not be without means . Free of my commission , I shall be able to compound with some small usurers who will hear of nothing but their bond now - Vholes says so . I should have a balance in my favour anyway , but that would swell it . Come , come ! You shall carry a letter to Ada from me , Esther , and you must both of you be more hopeful of me and not believe that I am quite cast away just yet , my dear . "
306928	306933	306935	306935	I	0	" Charley , Charley , "
306937	306941	306935	306935	I	0	" come away ! "
307053	307125	307047	307047	I	0	" My dear , there is no reason - there is and there can be no reason at all - why it should be worse for you now than it ever has been . What you were last month , you are to - day ; you are no worse , you are no better . This is not your resolution ; call it up , Esther , call it up ! "
307226	307240	307241	307241	I	0	" No , my dear , no . No , no , no ! "
307327	307343	307345	307345	I	0	" You have been in shipwreck and peril since you left us , Mr. Woodcourt , "
307347	307400	307345	307345	I	0	" but we can hardly call that a misfortune which enabled you to be so useful and so brave . We read of it with the truest interest . It first came to my knowledge through your old patient , poor Miss Flite , when I was recovering from my severe illness . "
307401	307408	307409	307409	he	448	" Ah ! Little Miss Flite ! "
307412	307420	307409	307409	he	448	" She lives the same life yet ? "
307421	307426	307427	307427	I	0	" Just the same . "
307449	307475	307409	307409	he	448	" Her gratitude to you , Mr. Woodcourt , is delightful . She is a most affectionate creature , as I have reason to say . "
307476	307485	307486	307486	he	448	" You - you have found her so ? "
307489	307498	307499	307499	He	448	" I - I am glad of that . "
307512	307517	307519	307519	I	0	" I assure you , "
307521	307540	307519	307519	I	0	" that I was deeply touched by her sympathy and pleasure at the time I have referred to . "
307541	307554	307499	307499	He	448	" I was grieved to hear that you had been very ill . "
307555	307561	307499	307499	He	448	" I was very ill . "
307562	307569	307519	307519	I	0	" But you have quite recovered ? "
307570	307581	307583	307583	I.	0	" I have quite recovered my health and my cheerfulness , "
307584	307616	307621	307621	he	6940	" You know how good my guardian is and what a happy life we lead , and I have everything to be thankful for and nothing in the world to desire . "
308029	308038	308040	308040	I	0	" I saw you observe him rather closely , "
308042	308050	308040	308040	I	0	" Do you think him so changed ? "
308051	308056	308057	308057	he	448	" He is changed , "
308096	308101	308103	308104	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" It is not , "
308106	308171	308103	308104	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" his being so much younger or older , or thinner or fatter , or paler or ruddier , as there being upon his face such a singular expression . I never saw so remarkable a look in a young person . One can not say that it is all anxiety or all weariness ; yet it is both , and like ungrown despair . "
308172	308181	308183	308183	I.	0	" You do not think he is ill ? "
308192	308211	308212	308212	I	0	" That he can not be at peace in mind , we have too much reason to know , "
308215	308225	308212	308212	I	0	" Mr. Woodcourt , you are going to London ? "
308226	308235	308103	308104	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" To - morrow or the next day . "
308236	308308	308186	308186	He	448	" There is nothing Richard wants so much as a friend . He always liked you . Pray see him when you get there . Pray help him sometimes with your companionship if you can . You do not know of what service it might be . You can not think how Ada , and Mr. Jarndyce , and even I - how we should all thank you , Mr. Woodcourt ! "
308309	308313	308314	308314	he	6952	" Miss Summerson , "
308327	308356	308314	308314	he	6952	" before heaven , I will be a true friend to him ! I will accept him as a trust , and it shall be a sacred one ! "

308385	308424	308425	308425	Richard	295	" Ada loves him - we all love him , but Ada loves him as we can not . I will tell her what you say . Thank you , and God bless you , in her name ! "
308447	308450	308451	308451	he	6954	" Woodcourt , "
308459	308467	308451	308451	he	6954	" pray let us meet in London ! "
308468	308471	308473	308474	the other	10506	" Meet ? "
308476	308493	308451	308451	he	6954	" I have scarcely a friend there now but you . Where shall I find you ? "
308494	308506	308508	308508	Richard	295	" Why , I must get a lodging of some sort , "
308512	308522	308508	308508	Richard	295	" Say at Vholes 's , Symond 's Inn . "
308523	308531	308532	308532	They	6953	" Good ! Without loss of time . "
309536	309542	309533	309533	he	6979	" What is the matter ? "
309543	309548	309533	309533	he	6979	" Nothing , sir . "
309549	309565	309533	309533	he	6979	" Ca n't you make them hear ? Do you want to be let in ? "
309566	309586	309587	309588	the woman	10391	" I 'm walting till they get up at another house - a lodging - house - not here , "
309592	309608	309587	309588	the woman	10391	" I 'm waiting here because there will be sun here presently to warm me . "
309609	309628	309533	309533	he	6979	" I am afraid you are tired . I am sorry to see you sitting in the street . "
309629	309640	309587	309588	the woman	10391	" Thank you , sir . It do n't matter . "
309690	309698	309699	309699	he	6979	" Let me look at your forehead , "
309705	309725	309699	309699	he	6979	" I am a doctor . Do n't be afraid . I would n't hurt you for the world . "
309754	309758	309746	309746	She	10391	" It 's nothing "
309780	309799	309772	309772	she	10391	" Aye ! A bad bruise , and the skin sadly broken . This must be very sore . "
309800	309809	309811	309812	the woman	10391	" It do ache a little , sir , "
309821	309838	309811	309812	the woman	10391	" Let me try to make it more comfortable . My handkerchief wo n't hurt you . "
309839	309853	309854	309854	He	6979	" Oh , dear no , sir , I 'm sure of that ! "
309915	309924	309901	309901	he	6979	" And so your husband is a brickmaker ? "
309925	309934	309936	309937	the woman	10391	" How do you know that , sir ? "
309941	309990	309991	309992	The woman	10391	" Why , I suppose so from the colour of the clay upon your bag and on your dress . And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in different places . And I am sorry to say I have known them cruel to their wives too . "
310035	310041	310043	310044	the surgeon	10776	" Where is he now ? "
310046	310068	310043	310044	the surgeon	10776	" He got into trouble last night , sir ; but he 'll look for me at the lodging - house . "
310069	310124	310125	310126	The woman	10391	" He will get into worse trouble if he often misuses his large and heavy hand as he has misused it here . But you forgive him , brutal as he is , and I say no more of him , except that I wish he deserved it . You have no young child ? "
310131	310146	310128	310128	her	10391	" One as I calls mine , sir , but it 's Liz 's . "
310147	310160	310164	310164	he	6998	" Your own is dead . I see ! Poor little thing ! "
310174	310189	310190	310190	he	6998	" I suppose you have some settled home . Is it far from here ? "
310210	310250	310190	310190	he	6998	" It 's a good two or three and twenty mile from here , sir . At Saint Albans . You know Saint Albans , sir ? I thought you gave a start like , as if you did . "
310251	310278	310299	310299	He	6998	" Yes , I know something of it . And now I will ask you a question in return . Have you money for your lodging ? "
310279	310284	310285	310285	she	10391	" Yes , sir , "
310288	310293	310295	310295	she	10391	" really and truly . "
310649	310656	310658	310659	the woman	10391	" Stop him , stop him ! "
310664	310670	310658	310659	the woman	10391	" Stop him , sir ! "
310724	310734	310718	310719	the woman	10391	" Stop him , sir , pray stop him ! "
310879	310886	310888	310889	the woman	10391	" Oh , you , Jo ! "
310891	310901	310888	310889	the woman	10391	" What ? I have found you at last ! "
310902	310905	310907	310907	Allan	448	" Jo , "
310915	310937	310907	310907	Allan	448	" Jo ! Stay . To be sure ! I recollect this lad some time ago being brought before the coroner . "
310938	310950	310952	310952	Jo	396	" Yes , I see you once afore at the inkwhich , "
310954	311104	311105	311105	He	7022	" What of that ? Ca n't you never let such an unfortnet as me alone ? An't I unfortnet enough for you yet ? How unfortnet do you want me fur to be ? I 've been a - chivied and a - chivied , fust by one on you and nixt by another on you , till I 'm worritted to skins and bones . The inkwhich warn't MY fault . I done nothink . He wos wery good to me , he wos ; he wos the only one I knowed to speak to , as ever come across my crossing . It ai n't wery likely I should want him to be inkwhiched . I only wish I wos , myself . I do n't know why I do n't go and make a hole in the water , I 'm sure I do n't . "
311163	311172	311157	311157	He	7022	" Miserable creature , what has he done ? "
311191	311207	311180	311180	her	10391	" Oh , you Jo , you Jo . I have found you at last ! "
311208	311214	311216	311216	Allan	448	" What has he done ? "
311218	311224	311216	311216	Allan	448	" Has he robbed you ? "
311225	311255	311256	311256	Allan	448	" No , sir , no . Robbed me ? He did nothing but what was kind - hearted by me , and that 's the wonder of it . "
311281	311291	311293	311294	the woman	10391	" But he was along with me , sir , "
311296	311345	311293	311294	the woman	10391	" Oh , you Jo ! He was along with me , sir , down at Saint Albans , ill , and a young lady , Lord bless her for a good friend to me , took pity on him when I durstn't , and took him home - "
311356	311477	311479	311480	the woman	10391	" Yes , sir , yes . Took him home , and made him comfortable , and like a thankless monster he ran away in the night and never has been seen or heard of since till I set eyes on him just now . And that young lady that was such a pretty dear caught his illness , lost her beautiful looks , and would n't hardly be known for the same young lady now if it was n't for her angel temper , and her pretty shape , and her sweet voice . Do you know it ? You ungrateful wretch , do you know that this is all along of you and of her goodness to you ? "
311558	311563	311564	311564	He	448	" Richard told me - "
311567	311590	311564	311564	He	448	" I mean , I have heard of this - do n't mind me for a moment , I will speak presently . "
311641	311655	311656	311656	Jo	396	" You hear what she says . But get up , get up ! "
311707	311728	311747	311747	Jo	396	" You hear what she says , and I know it 's true . Have you been here ever since ? "
311729	311745	311747	311747	Jo	396	" Wishermaydie if I seen Tom - all - Alone 's till this blessed morning , "
311750	311758	311759	311759	Jo	396	" Why have you come here now ? "
311781	311873	311759	311759	Jo	396	" I do n't know how to do nothink , and I ca n't get nothink to do . I 'm wery poor and ill , and I thought I 'd come back here when there warn't nobody about , and lay down and hide somewheres as I knows on till arter dark , and then go and beg a trifle of Mr. Snagsby . He wos allus willin fur to give me somethink he wos , though Mrs. Snagsby she was allus a- chivying on me - like everybody everywheres . "
311874	311881	311882	311882	Jo	396	" Where have you come from ? "
311913	311926	311902	311902	his	396	" Did you hear me ask you where you have come from ? "
311927	311931	311933	311933	Jo	396	" Tramp then , "
311935	311940	311942	311942	Allan	448	" Now tell me , "
311969	311999	312000	312000	Jo	396	" tell me how it came about that you left that house when the good young lady had been so unfortunate as to pity you and take you home . "
312121	312129	312114	312114	He	448	" Come , Jo . Tell me . "
312130	312136	312138	312138	Jo	396	" No . I dustn't , "
312146	312154	312138	312138	Jo	396	" I dustn't , or I would . "
312155	312161	312163	312164	the other	10506	" But I must know , "
312166	312175	312163	312164	the other	10506	" all the same . Come , Jo . "
312203	312219	312186	312186	his	396	" Well , I 'll tell you something . I was took away . There ! "
312220	312228	312163	312164	the other	10506	" Took away ? In the night ? "
312229	312232	312186	312186	his	396	" Ah ! "
312279	312285	312239	312239	Jo	396	" Who took you away ? "
312286	312292	312294	312294	Jo	396	" I dustn't name him , "
312296	312304	312294	312294	Jo	396	" I dustn't do it , sir . "
312330	312331	312324	312326	No one else	7047	" "
312340	312349	312351	312351	he	396	" replies Jo , shaking his head fearfully , "
312355	312356	312351	312351	he	396	" "
312366	312367	312359	312359	he	396	" "
312375	312379	312372	312372	he	396	" says Jo . "
312392	312446	312380	312380	He	396	" Allan looks at him in perplexity , but discovers some real meaning and good faith at the bottom of this bewildering reply . He patiently awaits an explicit answer ; and Jo , more baffled by his patience than by anything else , at last desperately whispers a name in his ear . "
312449	312453	312380	312380	He	396	" says Allan . "
312462	312463	312458	312458	you	0	" "
312518	312519	312534	312534	he	396	" "
312539	312540	312534	312534	he	396	" "
312547	312553	312534	312534	he	396	" replied Jo , whispering , "
312661	312694	312651	312651	he	396	" concludes Jo , nervously repeating all his former precautions and investigations . Allan considers a little , then remarks , turning to the woman but keeping an encouraging eye on Jo , "
312719	312720	312704	312704	He	396	" "
312727	312731	312721	312721	Thankee	640	" exclaims Jo . "
312775	312776	312771	312771	I	0	" "
312781	312791	312779	312779	Jo	396	" says Allan , keeping his eye upon him , "
312846	312847	312848	312848	I	0	" "
312865	312866	312854	312854	I	0	" "
312908	312909	312904	312906	my good woman	7059	" "
312925	312949	312917	312917	I	0	" She has been sitting on her bag , deeply attentive , and now rises and takes it up . Jo , repeating , "
312970	313098	312951	312951	you	9569	" nods and shambles and shivers , and smears and blinks , and half laughs and half cries , a farewell to her , and takes his creeping way along after Allan Woodcourt , close to the houses on the opposite side of the street . In this order , the two come up out of Tom - all - Alone 's into the broad rays of the sunlight and the purer air . CHAPTER XLVII Jo 's Will As Allan Woodcourt and Jo proceed along the streets where the high church spires and the distances are so near and clear in the morning light that the city itself seems renewed by rest , Allan revolves in his mind how and where he shall bestow his companion . "
313106	313110	312951	312951	you	9569	" he considers , "
313136	313375	313376	313376	I	0	" But it is none the less a fact because of its strangeness , and the difficulty remains . At first he looks behind him often to assure himself that Jo is still really following . But look where he will , he still beholds him close to the opposite houses , making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door , and often , as he creeps along , glancing over at him watchfully . Soon satisfied that the last thing in his thoughts is to give him the slip , Allan goes on , considering with a less divided attention what he shall do . A breakfast - stall at a street - corner suggests the first thing to be done . He stops there , looks round , and beckons Jo . Jo crosses and comes halting and shuffling up , slowly scooping the knuckles of his right hand round and round in the hollowed palm of his left , kneading dirt with a natural pestle and mortar . What is a dainty repast to Jo is then set before him , and he begins to gulp the coffee and to gnaw the bread and butter , looking anxiously about him in all directions as he eats and drinks , like a scared animal . But he is so sick and miserable that even hunger has abandoned him . "
313387	313397	313378	313378	I	0	" says Jo , soon putting down his food , "
313423	313448	313452	313452	Jo	396	" And Jo stands shivering and looking at the breakfast wonderingly . Allan Woodcourt lays his hand upon his pulse and on his chest . "
313454	313455	313452	313452	Jo	396	" "
313459	313463	313452	313452	Jo	396	" says Jo , "
313470	313475	313452	313452	Jo	396	" He might add , "
313481	313487	313452	313452	Jo	396	" but he only mutters , "
313496	313552	313488	313488	I	0	" Allan looks about for an apothecary 's shop . There is none at hand , but a tavern does as well or better . He obtains a little measure of wine and gives the lad a portion of it very carefully . He begins to revive almost as soon as it passes his lips . "
313561	313572	313559	313559	Jo	396	" observes Allan after watching him with his attentive face . "
313590	313903	313904	313906	My dear physician	5992	" Leaving the boy sitting on the bench of the breakfast - stall , with his back against an iron railing , Allan Woodcourt paces up and down in the early sunshine , casting an occasional look towards him without appearing to watch him . It requires no discernment to perceive that he is warmed and refreshed . If a face so shaded can brighten , his face brightens somewhat ; and by little and little he eats the slice of bread he had so hopelessly laid down . Observant of these signs of improvement , Allan engages him in conversation and elicits to his no small wonder the adventure of the lady in the veil , with all its consequences . Jo slowly munches as he slowly tells it . When he has finished his story and his bread , they go on again . Intending to refer his difficulty in finding a temporary place of refuge for the boy to his old patient , zealous little Miss Flite , Allan leads the way to the court where he and Jo first foregathered . But all is changed at the rag and bottle shop ; Miss Flite no longer lodges there ; it is shut up ; and a hard - featured female , much obscured by dust , whose age is a problem , but who is indeed no other than the interesting Judy , is tart and spare in her replies . These sufficing , however , to inform the visitor that Miss Flite and her birds are domiciled with a Mrs. Blinder , in Bell Yard , he repairs to that neighbouring place , where Miss Flite who rises early that she may be punctual at the divan of justice held by her excellent friend the Chancellor comes running downstairs with tears of welcome and with open arms . "
313908	313913	313904	313906	My dear physician	5992	" cries Miss Flite . "
313922	313985	313904	313906	My dear physician	5992	" She uses some odd expressions , but is as cordial and full of heart as sanity itself can be - more so than it often is . Allan , very patient with her , waits until she has no more raptures to express , then points out Jo , trembling in a doorway , and tells her how he comes there . "
314012	314054	313998	313998	you	5992	" Miss Flite , mighty proud of the compliment , sets herself to consider ; but it is long before a bright thought occurs to her . Mrs. Blinder is entirely let , and she herself occupies poor Gridley 's room . "
314057	314073	313998	313998	you	5992	" exclaims Miss Flite , clapping her hands after a twentieth repetition of this remark . "
314094	314306	314087	314088	General George	641	" It is hopeless to ask for any information about General George , and would be , though Miss Flite had not akeady run upstairs to put on her pinched bonnet and her poor little shawl and to arm herself with her reticule of documents . But as she informs her physician in her disjointed manner on coming down in full array that General George , whom she often calls upon , knows her dear Fitz Jarndyce and takes a great interest in all connected with her , Allan is induced to think that they may be in the right way . So he tells Jo , for his encouragement , that this walking about will soon be over now ; and they repair to the general 's . Fortunately it is not far . From the exterior of George 's Shooting Gallery , and the long entry , and the bare perspective beyond it , Allan Woodcourt augurs well . He also descries promise in the figure of Mr. George himself , striding towards them in his morning exercise with his pipe in his mouth , no stock on , and his muscular arms , developed by broadsword and dumbbell , weightily asserting themselves through his light shirt - sleeves . "
314312	314367	314371	314371	sir	9569	" says Mr. George with a military salute . Good- humouredly smiling all over his broad forehead up into his crisp hair , he then defers to Miss Flite , as , with great stateliness , and at some length , she performs the courtly ceremony of presentation . He winds it up with another "
314373	314378	314371	314371	sir	9569	" and another salute . "
314390	314395	314387	314387	I	0	" says Mr. George . "
314408	314412	314401	314401	I	0	" returns Allan ; "
314423	314424	314427	314427	sir	9569	" "
314442	314483	314484	314484	You	9569	" Allan hopes Mr. George will forgive his intrusion the more readily on that account , and particularly that he will not lay aside his pipe , which , in his politeness , he has testified some intention of doing . "
314491	314496	314489	314489	sir	9569	" returns the trooper . "
314520	314554	314518	314518	yourself	9569	" and finishes the sentence by putting it between his lips again . Allan proceeds to tell him all he knows about Jo , unto which the trooper listens with a grave face . "
314566	314597	314600	314600	he	12678	" he inquires , looking along the entry to where Jo stands staring up at the great letters on the whitewashed front , which have no meaning in his eyes . "
314602	314606	314600	314600	he	12678	" says Allan . "
314706	314707	314699	314699	I	0	" "
314714	314719	314708	314709	No man	855	" returns Mr. George . "
314770	314771	314772	314772	I	0	" "
314779	314784	314772	314772	I	0	" says Mr. George . "
314802	314803	314804	314805	The boy	1744	" "
314816	314817	314814	314814	Bucket	665	" "
314824	314825	314826	314828	The same man	7101	" "
314830	314831	314826	314828	The same man	7101	" "
314841	314857	314832	314833	The man	9972	" returns the trooper after blowing out a cloud of smoke and squaring his chest , "
314874	314891	314866	314866	he	1744	" Mr. George smokes with a profound meaning after this and surveys Miss Flite in silence . "
314972	314988	314967	314967	Jo	396	" says Allan , following the direction of the trooper 's eyes along the entry , "
315027	315097	315100	315100	sir	9569	" As he puts the question , he becomes aware of a dirty - faced little man standing at the trooper 's elbow and looking up , with an oddly twisted figure and countenance , into the trooper 's face . After a few more puffs at his pipe , the trooper looks down askant at the little man , and the little man winks up at the trooper . "
315102	315107	315100	315100	sir	9569	" says Mr. George , "
315257	315278	315279	315279	I	0	" With a comprehensive wave of his pipe , Mr. George places the whole building at his visitor 's disposal . "
315287	315291	315279	315279	I	0	" he adds , "
315311	315319	315322	315322	sir	9569	" Allan is quite sure of it . "
315324	315334	315322	315322	sir	9569	" says Mr. George , shaking his head sorrowfully , "
315342	315355	315322	315322	sir	9569	" His tone is no less sorrowfully echoed by his new acquaintance . "
315364	315373	315357	315357	I	0	" observes Allan after repeating his former assurance , "
315402	315403	315388	315388	I	0	" "
315414	315419	315405	315405	you	9569	" inquires the trooper . "
315426	315427	315405	315405	you	9569	" "
315432	315441	315430	315430	sir	9569	" returns the trooper in a decisive manner , "
315476	315760	315468	315468	You	9569	" Mr. Squod tacks out , all on one side , to execute the word of command ; and the trooper , having smoked his pipe , lays it by . Jo is brought in . He is not one of Mrs. Pardiggle 's Tockahoopo Indians ; he is not one of Mrs. Jellyby 's lambs , being wholly unconnected with Borrioboola - Gha ; he is not softened by distance and unfamiliarity ; he is not a genuine foreign - grown savage ; he is the ordinary home - made article . Dirty , ugly , disagreeable to all the senses , in body a common creature of the common streets , only in soul a heathen . Homely filth begrimes him , homely parasites devour him , homely sores are in him , homely rags are on him ; native ignorance , the growth of English soil and climate , sinks his immortal nature lower than the beasts that perish . Stand forth , Jo , in uncompromising colours ! From the sole of thy foot to the crown of thy head , there is nothing interesting about thee . He shuffles slowly into Mr. George 's gallery and stands huddled together in a bundle , looking all about the floor . He seems to know that they have an inclination to shrink from him , partly for what he is and partly for what he has caused . He , too , shrinks from them . He is not of the same order of things , not of the same place in creation . He is of no order and no place , neither of the beasts nor of humanity . "
315766	315770	315764	315764	Jo	396	" says Allan . "
315776	315798	315773	315774	Mr. George	515	" Jo searches the floor for some time longer , then looks up for a moment , and then down again . "
315818	315858	315859	315859	wery	7130	" Jo makes a scoop with one hand , which is supposed to be a bow . After a little more consideration and some backing and changing of the foot on which he rests , he mutters that he is "
315862	315863	315859	315859	wery	7130	" "
315901	315902	315888	315888	you	396	" "
315911	315921	315909	315909	sir	9569	" says Jo , reverting to his favourite declaration . "
315962	315963	315964	315964	I	0	" "
315984	315985	315976	315976	he	515	" "
315993	316003	315986	315986	My	0	" observes Mr. George , amazingly broad and upright , "
316028	316052	316054	316054	you	396	" As the trooper speaks , he conducts them to the other end of the gallery and opens one of the little cabins . "
316086	316099	316100	316101	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" - he refers apologetically to the card Allan has given him - "
316138	316148	316149	316149	Phil	521	" says the trooper , turning to his visitor . "
316154	316166	316149	316149	Phil	521	" Phil bears down upon them according to his usual tactics . "
316213	316214	316204	316204	You	521	" "
316223	316229	316218	316218	I	0	" is Phil 's reply . "
316237	316266	316231	316231	I	0	" says Mr. George in a martial sort of confidence , as if he were giving his opinion in a council of war at a drum - head , "
316295	316296	316297	316298	Mr. George	515	" "
316304	316313	316297	316298	Mr. George	515	" returns Allan , taking out his purse , "
316324	316387	316319	316319	I	0	" Phil Squod and Jo are sent out immediately on this work of improvement . Miss Flite , quite enraptured by her success , makes the best of her way to court , having great fears that otherwise her friend the Chancellor may be uneasy about her or may give the judgment she has so long expected in her absence , and observing "
316410	316454	316455	316455	I	0	" Allan takes the opportunity of going out to procure some restorative medicines , and obtaining them near at hand , soon returns to find the trooper walking up and down the gallery , and to fall into step and walk with him . "
316461	316466	316455	316455	I	0	" says Mr. George , "
316475	316481	316470	316471	Miss Summerson	283	" Yes , it appears . "
316489	316495	316487	316487	sir	9569	" No , it appears . "
316501	316506	316487	316487	sir	9569	" says Mr. George . "
316547	316548	316543	316543	I	0	" "
316555	316584	316552	316553	Mr. George	515	" The trooper looks sideways at Allan 's sunburnt cheek and bright dark eye , rapidly measures his height and build , and seems to approve of him . "
316646	316657	316658	316658	Tulkinghorn	271	" Allan looks at him inquiringly , repeating the name . "
316705	316716	316696	316697	the man	9972	" Allan naturally asks what kind of man he is . "
316729	316730	316731	316731	I	0	" "
316753	316754	316696	316697	the man	9972	" "
316765	316791	316792	316792	he	9972	" returns the trooper , stopping short and folding his arms on his square chest so angrily that his face fires and flushes all over ; "
316870	316871	316872	316872	I	0	" "
316876	316880	316834	316834	George	515	" says Allan , "
316889	316890	316934	316934	He	9972	" "
316893	316919	316934	316934	He	9972	" The trooper plants his legs wider apart , wets the palm of his broad right hand , and lays it on the imaginary moustache . "
317126	317133	317123	317124	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" the trooper resumes his march , "
317194	317442	317187	317187	he	9972	" Mr. George has been so excited that he finds it necessary to wipe his forehead on his shirt - sleeve . Even while he whistles his impetuosity away with the national anthem , some involuntary shakings of his head and heavings of his chest still linger behind , not to mention an occasional hasty adjustment with both hands of his open shirt - collar , as if it were scarcely open enough to prevent his being troubled by a choking sensation . In short , Allan Woodcourt has not much doubt about the going down of Mr. Tulkinghorn on the field referred to . Jo and his conductor presently return , and Jo is assisted to his mattress by the careful Phil , to whom , after due administration of medicine by his own hands , Allan confides all needful means and instructions . The morning is by this time getting on apace . He repairs to his lodgings to dress and breakfast , and then , without seeking rest , goes away to Mr. Jarndyce to communicate his discovery . With him Mr. Jarndyce returns alone , confidentially telling him that there are reasons for keeping this matter very quiet indeed and showing a serious interest in it . To Mr. Jarndyce , Jo repeats in substance what he said in the morning , without any material variation . Only that cart of his is heavier to draw , and draws with a hollower sound . "
317455	317459	317444	317444	me	0	" falters Jo , "
317534	317684	317685	317685	You	7177	" He makes so many of these references to the law - stationer in the course of a day or two that Allan , after conferring with Mr. Jarndyce , good - naturedly resolves to call in Cook 's Court , the rather , as the cart seems to be breaking down . To Cook 's Court , therefore , he repairs . Mr. Snagsby is behind his counter in his grey coat and sleeves , inspecting an indenture of several skins which has just come in from the engrosser 's , an immense desert of law - hand and parchment , with here and there a resting - place of a few large letters to break the awful monotony and save the traveller from despair . Mr Snagsby puts up at one of these inky wells and greets the stranger with his cough of general preparation for business . "
317694	317723	317685	317685	You	7177	" The stationer 's heart begins to thump heavily , for his old apprehensions have never abated . It is as much as he can do to answer , "
317759	317760	317751	317751	I	0	" "
317764	317769	317751	317751	I	0	" says Allan Woodcourt . "
317779	317780	317751	317751	I	0	" "
317787	317799	317751	317751	I	0	" thinks the afflicted stationer , as recollection breaks upon him . "
317813	317837	317751	317751	I	0	" But he has sufficient presence of mind to conduct his visitor into the little counting - house and to shut the door . "
317846	317847	317751	317751	I	0	" "
317854	317855	317751	317751	I	0	" "
317865	317874	317857	317857	you	9569	" says Mr. Snagsby in a melancholy whisper , "
317904	317925	317926	317926	I	0	" In deep dejection Mr. Snagsby sits down on his stool , with his back against his desk , protesting , "
318019	318050	318051	318051	You	7186	" His visitor professes his regret to hear it and asks him does he remember Jo . Mr. Snagsby answers with a suppressed groan , oh , do n't he ! "
318076	318085	318074	318074	Jo	396	" says Mr. Snagsby . Allan asks why . "
318088	318110	318074	318074	Jo	396	" repeats Mr. Snagsby , in his desperation clutching at the clump of hair at the back of his bald head . "
318141	318167	318118	318118	you	7186	" With this beneficent wish , Mr. Snagsby coughs a cough of dismal resignation and submits himself to hear what the visitor has to communicate . "
318171	318197	318118	318118	you	7186	" says Mr. Snagsby , who , between the earnestness of his feelings and the suppressed tones of his voice is discoloured in the face . "
318294	318349	318290	318290	Bedlam	643	" says Mr. Snagsby . But it is better than he expected after all , being no explosion of the mine below him or deepening of the pit into which he has fallen . And being tender - hearted and affected by the account he hears of Jo 's condition , he readily engages to "
318352	318463	318290	318290	Bedlam	643	" as early in the evening as he can manage it quietly . He looks round very quietly when the evening comes , but it may turn out that Mrs. Snagsby is as quiet a manager as he . Jo is very glad to see his old friend and says , when they are left alone , that he takes it uncommon kind as Mr. Sangsby should come so far out of his way on accounts of sich as him . Mr. Snagsby , touched by the spectacle before him , immediately lays upon the table half a crown , that magic balsam of his for all kinds of wounds . "
318475	318485	318486	318486	I	0	" inquires the stationer with his cough of sympathy . "
318497	318501	318494	318494	I	0	" returns Jo , "
318543	318567	318568	318569	Mr. Sangsby	642	" The stationer softly lays down another half - crown and asks him what it is that he is sorry for having done . "
318571	318575	318568	318569	Mr. Sangsby	642	" says Jo , "
318775	318802	318772	318773	Mr. Sangsby	642	" The softened stationer deposits another half - crown on the table . Nothing less than a repetition of that infallible remedy will relieve his feelings . "
318814	318818	318804	318804	I	0	" proceeds Jo , "
318832	318833	318822	318822	you	642	" "
318841	318846	318836	318836	Jo	396	" returns the stationer . "
318853	318859	318862	318864	my poor boy	2712	" says Jo with eagerness . "
318866	318872	318862	318864	my poor boy	2712	" Jo laughs with pleasure . "
319011	319012	319013	319013	It	7218	" "
319023	319028	319013	319013	It	7218	" Jo laughs again . "
319054	319211	319013	319013	It	7218	" The meek little stationer , with a broken and unfinished cough , slips down his fourth half - crown - he has never been so close to a case requiring so many - and is fain to depart . And Jo and he , upon this little earth , shall meet no more . No more . For the cart so hard to draw is near its journey 's end and drags over stony ground . All round the clock it labours up the broken steps , shattered and worn . Not many times can the sun rise and behold it still upon its weary road . Phil Squod , with his smoky gunpowder visage , at once acts as nurse and works as armourer at his little table in a corner , often looking round and saying with a nod of his green - baize cap and an encouraging elevation of his one eyebrow , "
319221	319469	319472	319472	Jo	396	" There , too , is Mr. Jarndyce many a time , and Allan Woodcourt almost always , both thinking , much , how strangely fate has entangled this rough outcast in the web of very different lives . There , too , the trooper is a frequent visitor , filling the doorway with his athletic figure and , from his superfluity of life and strength , seeming to shed down temporary vigour upon Jo , who never fails to speak more robustly in answer to his cheerful words . Jo is in a sleep or in a stupor to - day , and Allan Woodcourt , newly arrived , stands by him , looking down upon his wasted form . After a while he softly seats himself upon the bedside with his face towards him - just as he sat in the law - writer 's room - and touches his chest and heart . The cart had very nearly given up , but labours on a little more . The trooper stands in the doorway , still and silent . Phil has stopped in a low clinking noise , with his little hammer in his hand . Mr. Woodcourt looks round with that grave professional interest and attention on his face , and glancing significantly at the trooper , signs to Phil to carry his table out . When the little hammer is next used , there will be a speck of rust upon it . "
319484	319485	319486	319486	I	0	" "
319489	319501	319502	319502	I	0	" says Jo , who has started and is looking round , "

319555	319563	319549	319549	sir	9569	" Jo closes his eyes , muttering , "
319569	319597	319598	319598	Jo	396	" After watching him closely a little while , Allan puts his mouth very near his ear and says to him in a low , distinct voice , "
319607	319608	319601	319601	you	396	" "
319615	319616	319613	319613	sir	9569	" "

319819	319820	319814	319814	Jo	396	" "
319836	319844	319834	319834	sir	9569	" he returns with a wild look . "

Dead , right reverends and wrong reverends of every order . Dead , men and women , born with heavenly compassion in your hearts . And dying thus around us every day . CHAPTER XLVIII Closing in The place in Lincolnshire has shut its many eyes again , and the house in town is awake . In Lincolnshire the Dedlocks of the past doze in their picture - frames , and the low wind murmurs through the long drawing - room as if they were breathing pretty regularly . In town the Dedlocks of the present rattle in their fire - eyed carriages through the darkness of the night , and the Dedlock Mercuries , with ashes or hair - powder on their heads , symptomatic of their great humility , loll away the drowsy mornings in the little windows of the hall . The fashionable world - tremendous orb , nearly five miles round - is in full swing , and the solar system works respectfully at its appointed distances . Where the throng is thickest , where the lights are brightest , where all the senses are ministered to with the greatest delicacy and refinement , Lady Dedlock is . From the shining heights she has scaled and taken , she is never absent . Though the belief she of old reposed in herself as one able to reserve whatsoever she would under her mantle of pride is beaten down , though she has no assurance that what she is to those around her she will remain another day , it is not in her nature when envious eyes are looking on to yield or to droop . They say of her that she has lately grown more handsome and more haughty . The debilitated cousin says of her that she 's beauty nough - tsetup shopofwomen - but rather larming kind - remindingmanfact - inconvenient woman - who WILL getoutofbedandbawthstahlishment - Shakespeare . Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing , looks nothing . Now , as heretofore , he is to be found in doorways of rooms , with his limp white cravat loosely twisted into its old - fashioned tie , receiving patronage from the peerage and making no sign . Of all men he is still the last who might be supposed to have any influence upon my Lady . Of all women she is still the last who might be supposed to have any dread of him . One thing has been much on her mind since their late interview in his turret - room at Chesney Wold . She is now decided , and prepared to throw it off . It is morning in the great world , afternoon according to the little sun . The Mercuries , exhausted by looking out of window , are reposing in the hall and hang their heavy heads , the gorgeous creatures , like overblown sunflowers . Like them , too , they seem to run to a deal of seed in their tags and trimmings . Sir Leicester , in the library , has fallen asleep for the good of the country over the report of a Parliamentary committee . My Lady sits in the room in which she gave audience to the young man of the name of Guppy . Rosa is with her and has been writing for her and reading to her . Rosa is now at work upon embroidery or some such pretty thing , and as she bends her head over it , my Lady watches her in silence . Not for the first time to - day . "
320876	320899	320874	320874	Rosa	338	" The pretty village face looks brightly up . Then , seeing how serious my Lady is , looks puzzled and surprised . "
320909	320925	320926	320926	I	0	" Yes . She goes to it and returns , and looks yet more surprised . "
320986	320999	320970	320970	I	0	" The timid little beauty promises in all earnestness to be trustworthy . "
321004	321019	321021	321021	you	338	" Lady Dedlock asks her , signing to her to bring her chair nearer , "

321082	321106	321079	321080	poor child	1320	" She says it with a kind of scorn - though not of Rosa - and sits brooding , looking dreamily at her . "

321421	321460	321414	321414	I	0	" The weeping girl covers her hand with kisses and says what shall she do , what shall she do , when they are separated ! Her mistress kisses her on the cheek and makes no other answer . "

321607	321721	321722	321723	Sir Leicester	268	" She detaches herself from her simple - hearted companion and leaves the room . Late in the afternoon , when she next appears upon the staircase , she is in her haughtiest and coldest state . As indifferent as if all passion , feeling , and interest had been worn out in the earlier ages of the world and had perished from its surface with its other departed monsters . Mercury has announced Mr. Rouncewell , which is the cause of her appearance . Mr. Rouncewell is not in the library , but she repairs to the library . Sir Leicester is there , and she wishes to speak to him first . "
321734	321766	321767	321767	I	0	" Oh , dear no ! Not at all . Only Mr. Tulkinghorn . Always at hand . Haunting every place . No relief or security from him for a moment . "
321782	321790	321776	321776	you	268	" With a look that plainly says , "
321803	322179	321791	321791	You	268	" she tells him it is not necessary and moves towards a chair . Mr. Tulkinghorn brings it a little forward for her with his clumsy bow and retires into a window opposite . Interposed between her and the fading light of day in the now quiet street , his shadow falls upon her , and he darkens all before her . Even so does he darken her life . It is a dull street under the best conditions , where the two long rows of houses stare at each other with that severity that half - a- dozen of its greatest mansions seem to have been slowly stared into stone rather than originally built in that material . It is a street of such dismal grandeur , so determined not to condescend to liveliness , that the doors and windows hold a gloomy state of their own in black paint and dust , and the echoing mews behind have a dry and massive appearance , as if they were reserved to stable the stone chargers of noble statues . Complicated garnish of iron - work entwines itself over the flights of steps in this awful street , and from these petrified bowers , extinguishers for obsolete flambeaux gasp at the upstart gas . Here and there a weak little iron hoop , through which bold boys aspire to throw their friends ' caps its only present use , retains its place among the rusty foliage , sacred to the memory of departed oil . Nay , even oil itself , yet lingering at long intervals in a little absurd glass pot , with a knob in the bottom like an oyster , blinks and sulks at newer lights every night , like its high and dry master in the House of Lords . Therefore there is not much that Lady Dedlock , seated in her chair , could wish to see through the window in which Mr. Tulkinghorn stands . And yet - and yet - she sends a look in that direction as if it were her heart 's desire to have that figure moved out of the way . Sir Leicester begs his Lady 's pardon . She was about to say ? "

322298	322322	322323	322323	I	0	" Mercury departs in search of the iron gentleman , finds , and produces him . Sir Leicester receives that ferruginous person graciously . "
322349	322363	322346	322347	Mr. Rouncewell	334	" Sir Leicester skilfully transfers him with a solemn wave of his hand , "
322373	322374	322371	322371	Hem	538	" "
322381	322387	322375	322375	I	0	" returns the iron gentleman , "
322404	322457	322395	322396	Lady Dedlock	266	" As he turns towards her , he finds that the impression she makes upon him is less agreeable than on the former occasion . A distant supercilious air makes a cold atmosphere about her , and there is nothing in her bearing , as there was before , to encourage openness . "
322462	322468	322470	322470	I	0	" says Lady Dedlock listlessly , "
322490	322512	322519	322520	Lady Dedlock	266	" It is almost too troublesome to her languid eyes to bestow a look upon him as she asks this question . "
322548	322559	322562	322562	you	266	" The ironmaster repeats her expression with a little emphasis . "
322564	322565	322562	322562	you	266	" "
322573	322621	322570	322570	I	0	" Sir Leicester gives a nod , approving and confirmatory . Very proper . The iron gentleman , having said that he would do it , was bound to do it . No difference in this respect between the base metals and the precious . Highly proper . "
322629	322630	322625	322625	he	11511	" "
322691	322738	322679	322679	I	0	" Sir Leicester has a misgiving that there may be a hidden Wat Tylerish meaning in this expression , and fumes a little . Mr. Rouncewell is perfectly good - humoured and polite , but within such limits , evidently adapts his tone to his reception . "

323178	323195	323244	323244	she	10396	" observes my Lady in her coldest manner before he can do anything but breathe amazedly , "
323257	323303	323305	323306	Sir Leicester	268	" Sir Leicester begs to observe that wholly alters the case . He might have been sure that my Lady had the best grounds and reasons in support of her view . He entirely agrees with my Lady . The young woman had better go . "

323442	323466	323467	323469	The iron gentleman	7279	" she returns with the same studied carelessness , ' so should I. Do I understand that you will take her with you ? "
323475	323483	323467	323469	The iron gentleman	7279	" Sir Leicester , will you ring ? "
323496	323505	323506	323506	He	271	" I had forgotten you . Thank you . "
323579	323589	323594	323594	her	934	" You are taken charge of , you see , "
323598	323625	323594	323594	her	934	" and are going away well protected . I have mentioned that you are a very good girl , and you have nothing to cry for . "
323626	323632	323634	323635	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" She seems after all , "
323647	323657	323642	323642	his	271	" as if she were crying at going away . "
323658	323671	323684	323684	he	271	" Why , she is not well - bred , you see , "
323695	323724	323684	323684	he	271	" and she is an inexperienced little thing and knows no better . If she had remained here , sir , she would have improved , no doubt . "
323725	323729	323731	323732	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" No doubt , "
323778	323786	323788	323789	the ironmaster	4830	" Out , you silly little puss ! "
323802	323814	323788	323789	the ironmaster	4830	" Have a spirit , if you 're fond of Watt ! "
323826	323842	323815	323816	My Lady	934	" There , there , child ! You are a good girl . Go away ! "
323890	323897	323899	323900	Mr. Rouncewell	334	" Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , "
323909	324048	323899	323900	Mr. Rouncewell	334	" I beg to take my leave , with an apology for having again troubled you , though not of my own act , on this tiresome subject . I can very well understand , I assure you , how tiresome so small a matter must have become to Lady Dedlock . If I am doubtful of my dealing with it , it is only because I did not at first quietly exert my influence to take my young friend here away without troubling you at all . But it appeared to me - I dare say magnifying the importance of the thing - that it was respectful to explain to you how the matter stood and candid to consult your wishes and convenience . I hope you will excuse my want of acquaintance with the polite world . "
324062	324066	324067	324067	he	268	" Mr. Rouncewell , "
324070	324087	324067	324067	he	268	" do not mention it . Justifications are unnecessary , I hope , on either side . "
324088	324193	324195	324195	he	268	" I am glad to hear it , Sir Leicester ; and if I may , by way of a last word , revert to what I said before of my mother 's long connexion with the family and the worth it bespeaks on both sides , I would point out this little instance here on my arm who shows herself so affectionate and faithful in parting and in whom my mother , I dare say , has done something to awaken such feelings - though of course Lady Dedlock , by her heartfelt interest and her genial condescension , has done much more . "
324332	324356	324319	324320	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Well she may be ! The power of this woman is astonishing . She has been acting a part the whole time . "
324594	324602	324586	324586	her	934	" What do you want , sir ? "
324603	324609	324611	324612	the lawyer	1047	" Why , Lady Dedlock , "
324641	324653	324611	324612	the lawyer	1047	" I am rather surprised by the course you have taken . "
324654	324657	324713	324713	his	1047	" Indeed ? "
324658	324709	324710	324710	He	1047	" Yes , decidedly . I was not prepared for it . I consider it a departure from our agreement and your promise . It puts us in a new position , Lady Dedlock . I feel myself under the necessity of saying that I do n't approve of it . "
324756	324764	324713	324713	his	1047	" I do not quite understand you . "
324765	324802	324710	324710	He	1047	" Oh , yes you do , I think . I think you do . Come , come , Lady Dedlock , we must not fence and parry now . You know you like this girl . "
324803	324808	324713	324713	his	1047	" Well , sir ? "
324809	324864	324713	324713	his	1047	" And you know - and I know - that you have not sent her away for the reasons you have assigned , but for the purpose of separating her as much as possible from - excuse my mentioning it as a matter of business - any reproach and exposure that impend over yourself . "
324865	324870	324710	324710	He	1047	" Well , sir ? "
324871	324877	324879	324880	the lawyer	1047	" Well , Lady Dedlock , "
324891	324991	324879	324880	the lawyer	1047	" I object to that . I consider that a dangerous proceeding . I know it to be unnecessary and calculated to awaken speculation , doubt , rumour , I do n't know what , in the house . Besides , it is a violation of our agreement . You were to be exactly what you were before . Whereas , it must be evident to yourself , as it is to me , that you have been this evening very different from what you were before . Why , bless my soul , Lady Dedlock , transparently so ! "
324992	324997	324998	324998	she	7336	" If , sir , "
325001	325009	324998	324998	she	7336	" in my knowledge of my secret - "
325015	325091	325011	325011	he	1047	" Now , Lady Dedlock , this is a matter of business , and in a matter of business the ground can not be kept too clear . It is no longer your secret . Excuse me . That is just the mistake . It is my secret , in trust for Sir Leicester and the family . If it were your secret , Lady Dedlock , we should not be here holding this conversation . "
325092	325172	325174	325174	she	7337	" That is very true . If in my knowledge of THE secret I do what I can to spare an innocent girl especially , remembering your own reference to her when you told my story to the assembled guests at Chesney Wold from the taint of my impending shame , I act upon a resolution I have taken . Nothing in the world , and no one in the world , could shake it or could move me . "
325212	325222	325223	325223	he	7338	" Really ? Then you see , Lady Dedlock , "
325226	325265	325223	325223	he	7338	" you are not to be trusted . You have put the case in a perfectly plain way , and according to the literal fact ; and that being the case , you are not to be trusted . "
325266	325289	325174	325174	she	7337	" Perhaps you may remember that I expressed some anxiety on this same point when we spoke at night at Chesney Wold ? "
325290	325293	325295	325296	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Yes , "
325307	325429	325295	325296	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Yes . I recollect , Lady Dedlock , that you certainly referred to the girl , but that was before we came to our arrangement , and both the letter and the spirit of our arrangement altogether precluded any action on your part founded upon my discovery . There can be no doubt about that . As to sparing the girl , of what importance or value is she ? Spare ! Lady Dedlock , here is a family name compromised . One might have supposed that the course was straight on - over everything , neither to the right nor to the left , regardless of all considerations in the way , sparing nothing , treading everything under foot . "
325469	325475	325460	325460	her	7339	" This woman understands me , "
325487	325500	325480	325480	she	7339	" SHE can not be spared . Why should she spare others ? "
325573	325577	325579	325580	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" This woman , "
325596	325601	325579	325580	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" is a study . "
325655	325703	325623	325623	She	7339	" Lady Dedlock , the most disagreeable part of this business interview remains , but it is business . Our agreement is broken . A lady of your sense and strength of character will be prepared for my now declaring it void and taking my own course . "
325704	325710	325711	325712	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" I am quite prepared . "
325717	325731	325714	325714	his	271	" That is all I have to trouble you with , Lady Dedlock . "
325746	325763	325732	325732	She	7339	" This is the notice I was to receive ? I wish not to misapprehend you . "
325764	325808	325711	325712	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Not exactly the notice you were to receive , Lady Dedlock , because the contemplated notice supposed the agreement to have been observed . But virtually the same , virtually the same . The difference is merely in a lawyer 's mind . "
325809	325819	325732	325732	She	7339	" You intend to give me no other notice ? "
325820	325827	325732	325732	She	7339	" You are right . No . "
325828	325839	325711	325712	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Do you contemplate undeceiving Sir Leicester to - night ? "
325840	325845	325847	325848	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" A home question ! "
325863	325870	325856	325856	his	271	" No , not to- night . "
325871	325876	325711	325712	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" To - morrow ? "
325877	325956	325957	325957	She	7342	" All things considered , I had better decline answering that question , Lady Dedlock . If I were to say I do n't know when , exactly , you would not believe me , and it would answer no purpose . It may be to - morrow . I would rather say no more . You are prepared , and I hold out no expectations which circumstances might fail to justify . I wish you good evening . "
325989	326017	325963	325963	her	7342	" Do you intend to remain in the house any time ? I heard you were writing in the library . Are you going to return there ? "
326018	326029	326030	326030	She	7342	" Only for my hat . I am going home . "
326094	326101	326102	326103	Mr. Tulkinghorn	7344	" And what do YOU say , "
326110	326116	326102	326103	Mr. Tulkinghorn	7344	" What do you say ? "
326122	326128	326102	326103	Mr. Tulkinghorn	7344	" Do n't go home ! "
326170	326176	326102	326103	Mr. Tulkinghorn	7344	" Do n't go home ! "
326193	326204	326206	326207	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Why , you are worse than I thought you , "
326215	326230	326206	326207	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" Two minutes wrong ? At this rate you wo n't last my time . "
326245	326251	326252	326252	He	271	" Do n't go home ! "
326338	326344	326334	326334	them	7348	" Do n't go home ! "
326408	326414	326405	326405	him	271	" Do n't go home ! "
326470	326476	326460	326462	the attendant groups	7353	" Do n't come here ! "
327663	327673	327674	327674	He	646	" If he could only tell what he saw ! "
328150	328152	328142	328142	him	552	" goodness "
328247	328253	328200	328201	Mr. Bagnet	552	" What is your name ? "
328255	328262	328200	328201	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Who gave you that name ? "
328280	328289	328291	328291	he	552	" And how do you like that name ? "
328739	328745	328747	328748	Mr. Bagnet	552	" At half after one . "
328750	328760	328747	328748	Mr. Bagnet	552	" To the minute . They 'll be done . "
328782	328792	328794	328795	Mr. Bagnet	552	" You shall have a dinner , old girl , "
328797	328803	328794	328795	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Fit for a queen . "
328919	328926	328928	328929	Mr. Bagnet	552	" George will look us up , "
328931	328957	328928	328929	Mr. Bagnet	552	" At half after four . To the moment . How many years , old girl . Has George looked us up . This afternoon ? "
328958	328990	328998	328998	her	553	" Ah , Lignum , Lignum , as many as make an old woman of a young one , I begin to think . Just about that , and no less , "
329001	329005	328998	328998	her	553	" Old girl , "
329010	329038	329007	329008	Mr. Bagnet	552	" never mind . You 'd be as young as ever you was . If you was n't younger . Which you are . As everybody knows . "
329069	329076	329078	329079	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Do you know , Lignum , "
329095	329114	329115	329115	I	0	" at Malta with her right eye , and shaking the pepper away from Quebec with her head , "
329127	329130	329119	329119	George	515	" George , "
329135	329157	329119	329119	George	515	" will never desert . And leave his old comrade . In the lurch . Do n't be afraid of it . "
329158	329198	329199	329200	Mr. Bagnet	552	" No , Lignum . No . I do n't say he will . I do n't think he will . But if he could get over this money trouble of his , I believe he would be off . "
329204	329207	329199	329200	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Well , "
329214	329263	329199	329200	Mr. Bagnet	552	" George seems to me to be getting not a little impatient and restless . I do n't say but what he 's as free as ever . Of course he must be free or he would n't be George , but he smarts and seems put out . "
329264	329271	329273	329274	Mr. Bagnet	552	" He 's extra - drilled , "
329276	329288	329273	329274	Mr. Bagnet	552	" By a lawyer . Who would put the devil out . "
329289	329296	329199	329200	Mr. Bagnet	552	" There 's something in that , "
329301	329309	329199	329200	Mr. Bagnet	552	" but so it is , Lignum . "
329904	329910	329900	329901	Mr. Bagnet	552	" George ! Military time . "
329942	329948	329950	329951	Mr. George	515	" Happy returns to all ! "
329953	329961	329963	329964	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" But , George , old man ! "
329971	329978	329963	329964	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" What 's come to you ? "
329979	329984	329950	329951	Mr. George	515	" Come to me ? "
329985	330010	329963	329964	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Ah ! You are so white , George - for you - and look so shocked . Now do n't he , Lignum ? "
330011	330014	330016	330017	Mr. Bagnet	552	" George , "
330019	330030	330016	330017	Mr. Bagnet	552	" tell the old girl . What 's the matter . "
330031	330040	330042	330043	the trooper	3804	" I did n't know I looked white , "
330052	330095	330042	330043	the trooper	3804	" and I did n't know I looked shocked , and I 'm sorry I do . But the truth is , that boy who was taken in at my place died yesterday afternoon , and it has rather knocked me over . "
330096	330100	330102	330103	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Poor creetur ! "
330110	330119	330102	330103	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Is he gone ? Dear , dear ! "
330120	330164	330166	330167	the trooper	3804	" I did n't mean to say anything about it , for it 's not birthday talk , but you have got it out of me , you see , before I sit down . I should have roused up in a minute , "
330175	330185	330170	330170	himself	3804	" but you 're so quick , Mrs. Bagnet . "
330186	330195	330197	330198	Mr. Bagnet	552	" You 're right . The old girl , "
330200	330208	330197	330198	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Is as quick . As powder . "
330209	330230	330232	330233	Mr. George	515	" And what 's more , she 's the subject of the day , and we 'll stick to her , "
330235	330275	330232	330233	Mr. George	515	" See here , I have brought a little brooch along with me . It 's a poor thing , you know , but it 's a keepsake . That 's all the good it is , Mrs. Bagnet . "
330306	330310	330312	330313	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Old girl , "
330315	330323	330312	330313	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Tell him my opinion of it . "
330324	330334	330335	330336	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Why , it 's a wonder , George ! "
330339	330350	330335	330336	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" It 's the beautifullest thing that ever was seen ! "
330351	330354	330356	330357	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Good ! "
330359	330363	330356	330357	Mr. Bagnet	552	" My opinion . "
330364	330372	330374	330375	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" It 's so pretty , George , "
330391	330400	330374	330375	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" that it seems too choice for me . "
330401	330404	330406	330407	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Bad ! "
330409	330414	330374	330375	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Not my opinion . "
330415	330429	330431	330432	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" But whatever it is , a hundred thousand thanks , old fellow , "
330447	330500	330434	330434	her	553	" and though I have been a crossgrained soldier 's wife to you sometimes , George , we are as strong friends , I am sure , in reality , as ever can be . Now you shall fasten it on yourself , for good luck , if you will , George . "
330548	330563	330542	330542	her	553	" Oh , Lignum , Lignum , what a precious old chap you are ! "
330586	330593	330595	330595	he	3804	" Would any one believe this ? "
330606	330623	330595	330595	he	3804	" I am so out of sorts that I bungle at an easy job like this ! "
330669	330680	330682	330682	she	553	" If that do n't bring you round , George , "
330684	330706	330682	330682	she	553	" just throw your eye across here at your present now and then , and the two together MUST do it . "
330707	330716	330595	330595	he	3804	" You ought to do it of yourself , "
330720	330778	330717	330717	George	515	" I know that very well , Mrs. Bagnet . I 'll tell you how , one way and another , the blues have got to be too many for me . Here was this poor lad . ' Twas dull work to see him dying as he did , and not be able to help him . "
330779	330799	330682	330682	she	553	" What do you mean , George ? You did help him . You took him under your roof . "
330800	330853	330717	330717	George	515	" I helped him so far , but that 's little . I mean , Mrs. Bagnet , there he was , dying without ever having been taught much more than to know his right hand from his left . And he was too far gone to be helped out of that . "
330854	330860	330862	330863	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Ah , poor creetur ! "
330865	330868	330870	330871	the trooper	3804	" Then , "
330888	330975	330870	330871	the trooper	3804	" that brought up Gridley in a man 's mind . His was a bad case too , in a different way . Then the two got mixed up in a man 's mind with a flinty old rascal who had to do with both . And to think of that rusty carbine , stock and barrel , standing up on end in his corner , hard , indifferent , taking everything so evenly - it made flesh and blood tingle , I do assure you . "
330976	330982	330984	330985	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" My advice to you , "
330987	331011	330984	330985	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" is to light your pipe and tingle that way . It 's wholesomer and comfortabler , and better for the health altogether . "
331012	331017	331019	331020	the trooper	3804	" You 're right , "
331022	331029	331019	331020	the trooper	3804	" and I 'll do it . "
331092	331096	331084	331085	Mr. Bagnet	552	" the mixtur , "
331132	331165	331122	331122	He	552	" George . Woolwich . Quebec . Malta . This is her birthday . Take a day 's march . And you wo n't find such another . Here 's towards her ! "
331195	331200	331202	331204	the old girl	4703	" And wishing yours ! "
331241	331247	331225	331225	she	4703	" Here 's a man ! "
331311	331314	331316	331317	the man	9972	" George , "
331321	331328	331316	331317	the man	9972	" how do you find yourself ? "
331329	331336	331338	331339	Mr. George	515	" Why , it 's Bucket ! "
331341	331344	331346	331347	the man	9972	" Yes , "
331356	331458	331460	331461	Mr. Bucket	665	" I was going down the street here when I happened to stop and look in at the musical instruments in the shop - window - a friend of mine is in want of a second - hand wiolinceller of a good tone - and I saw a party enjoying themselves , and I thought it was you in the corner ; I thought I could n't be mistaken . How goes the world with you , George , at the present moment ? Pretty smooth ? And with you , ma'am ? And with you , governor ? And Lord , "
331467	331514	331460	331461	Mr. Bucket	665	" here 's children too ! You may do anything with me if you only show me children . Give us a kiss , my pets . No occasion to inquire who YOUR father and mother is . Never saw such a likeness in my life ! "
331538	331543	331545	331546	Mr. Bucket	665	" You pretty dears , "
331548	331599	331545	331546	Mr. Bucket	665	" give us another kiss ; it 's the only thing I 'm greedy in . Lord bless you , how healthy you look ! And what may be the ages of these two , ma'am ? I should put 'em down at the figures of about eight and ten . "
331600	331608	331610	331611	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" You 're very near , sir , "
331613	331619	331621	331622	Mr. Bucket	665	" I generally am near , "
331624	331688	331690	331691	Mr. Bucket	665	" being so fond of children . A friend of mine has had nineteen of 'em , ma'am , all by one mother , and she 's still as fresh and rosy as the morning . Not so much so as yourself , but , upon my soul , she comes near you ! And what do you call these , my darling ? "
331698	331754	331690	331691	Mr. Bucket	665	" These are peaches , these are . Bless your heart ! And what do you think about father ? Do you think father could recommend a second - hand wiolinceller of a good tone for Mr. Bucket 's friend , my dear ? My name 's Bucket . Ai n't that a funny name ? "
331833	331840	331842	331843	Mr. Bucket	665	" Not in his usual spirits ? "
331845	331898	331842	331843	Mr. Bucket	665	" Why , I never heard of such a thing ! What 's the matter , George ? You do n't intend to tell me you 've been out of spirits . What should you be out of spirits for ? You have n't got anything on your mind , you know . "
331899	331903	331905	331906	the trooper	3804	" Nothing particular , "
331908	331914	331916	331917	Mr. Bucket	665	" I should think not , "
331919	331989	331916	331917	Mr. Bucket	665	" What could you have on your mind , you know ! And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds , eh ? Not they , but they 'll be upon the minds of some of the young fellows , some of these days , and make 'em precious low- spirited . I ai n't much of a prophet , but I can tell you that , ma'am . "
332006	332011	332013	332014	Mr. Bucket	665	" There , ma'am ! "
332016	332089	332013	332014	Mr. Bucket	665	" Would you believe it ? No , I have n't . My wife and a lodger constitute my family . Mrs. Bucket is as fond of children as myself and as wishful to have 'em , but no . So it is . Worldly goods are divided unequally , and man must not repine . What a very nice backyard , ma'am ! Any way out of that yard , now ? "
332099	332105	332107	332108	Mr. Bucket	665	" Ai n't there really ? "
332110	332170	332107	332108	Mr. Bucket	665	" I should have thought there might have been . Well , I do n't know as I ever saw a backyard that took my fancy more . Would you allow me to look at it ? Thank you . No , I see there 's no way out . But what a very good- proportioned yard it is ! "
332200	332209	332193	332194	Mr. George	515	" How are your spirits now , George ? "
332210	332215	332217	332218	the trooper	3804	" All right now , "
332220	332226	332228	332229	Mr. Bucket	665	" That 's your sort ! "
332231	332296	332228	332229	Mr. Bucket	665	" Why should you ever have been otherwise ? A man of your fine figure and constitution has no right to be out of spirits . That ai n't a chest to be out of spirits , is it , ma'am ? And you have n't got anything on your mind , you know , George ; what could you have on your mind ! "
332353	332365	332367	332368	Mr. Bucket	665	" And this is brother , is it , my dears ? "
332384	332412	332367	332368	Mr. Bucket	665	" And a nice brother he is - half - brother I mean to say . For he 's too old to be your boy , ma'am . "
332413	332428	332430	332431	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" I can certify at all events that he is not anybody else 's , "
332435	332480	332430	332431	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Well , you do surprise me ! Yet he 's like you , there 's no denying . Lord , he 's wonderfully like you ! But about what you may call the brow , you know , THERE his father comes out ! "
332518	332526	332528	332529	Mr. Bucket	665	" George 's godson , is he ? "
332534	332577	332528	332529	Mr. Bucket	665	" I must shake hands over again with George 's godson . Godfather and godson do credit to one another . And what do you intend to make of him , ma'am ? Does he show any turn for any musical instrument ? "
332583	332590	332578	332579	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Plays the fife . Beautiful . "
332591	332599	332601	332602	Mr. Bucket	665	" Would you believe it , governor , "
332609	332670	332601	332602	Mr. Bucket	665	" that when I was a boy I played the fife myself ? Not in a scientific way , as I expect he does , but by ear . Lord bless you ! ' British Grenadiers ' - there 's a tune to warm an Englishman up ! COULD you give us ' British Grenadiers , ' my fine fellow ? "
332720	332728	332732	332732	he	665	" British Gra - a - anadeers ! "
332821	332832	332836	332836	he	665	" Believe Me , if All Those Endearing Young Charms . "
332875	332883	332869	332870	Mr. Bucket	665	" to come up to the scratch . "
333264	333282	333244	333244	He	665	" Respecting that second - hand wiolinceller , governor - could you recommend me such a thing ? "
333283	333286	333288	333289	Mr. Bagnet	552	" Scores , "
333291	333298	333288	333289	Mr. Bagnet	552	" I am obliged to you , "
333307	333358	333360	333361	Mr. Bucket	665	" You 're a friend in need . A good tone , mind you ! My friend is a regular dab at it . Ecod , he saws away at Mozart and Handel and the rest of the big - wigs like a thorough workman . And you need n't , "
333369	333430	333360	333361	Mr. Bucket	665	" you need n't commit yourself to too low a figure , governor . I do n't want to pay too large a price for my friend , but I want you to have your proper percentage and be remunerated for your loss of time . That is but fair . Every man must live , and ought to it . "
333452	333488	333490	333491	Mr. Bucket	665	" Suppose I was to give you a look in , say , at half arter ten to- morrow morning . Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone ? "
333527	333531	333533	333534	Mr. Bucket	665	" Thank you , "
333536	333574	333533	333534	Mr. Bucket	665	" thank you . Good night , ma'am . Good night , governor . Good night , darlings . I am much obliged to you for one of the pleasantest evenings I ever spent in my life . "
333610	333617	333619	333620	Mr. Bucket	665	" Now George , old boy , "
333631	333635	333619	333620	Mr. Bucket	665	" come along ! "
333664	333680	333654	333655	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" almost clings to George like , and seems to be really fond of him . "
333734	333751	333716	333717	Mr. Bucket	665	" Wait half a minute , George . I should wish to speak to you first . "
333781	333786	333788	333789	Mr. Bucket	665	" Now , George , "
333791	333848	333788	333789	Mr. Bucket	665	" duty is duty , and friendship is friendship . I never want the two to clash if I can help it . I have endeavoured to make things pleasant to - night , and I put it to you whether I have done it or not . You must consider yourself in custody , George . "
333849	333855	333857	333858	the trooper	3804	" Custody ? What for ? "
333862	333867	333869	333870	Mr. Bucket	665	" Now , George , "
333886	333947	333869	333870	Mr. Bucket	665	" duty , as you know very well , is one thing , and conversation is another . It 's my duty to inform you that any observations you may make will be liable to be used against you . Therefore , George , be careful what you say . You do n't happen to have heard of a murder ? "
333948	333951	333857	333858	the trooper	3804	" Murder ! "
333952	333957	333959	333960	Mr. Bucket	665	" Now , George , "
333972	334011	333959	333960	Mr. Bucket	665	" bear in mind what I 've said to you . I ask you nothing . You 've been in low spirits this afternoon . I say , you do n't happen to have heard of a murder ? "
334012	334022	333857	333858	the trooper	3804	" No . Where has there been a murder ? "
334023	334028	334030	334031	Mr. Bucket	665	" Now , George , "
334033	334086	334030	334031	Mr. Bucket	665	" do n't you go and commit yourself . I 'm a - going to tell you what I want you for . There has been a murder in Lincoln 's Inn Fields - gentleman of the name of Tulkinghorn . He was shot last night . I want you for that . "
334113	334132	334138	334139	Mr. Bucket	665	" Bucket ! It 's not possible that Mr. Tulkinghorn has been killed and that you suspect ME ? "
334133	334136	334138	334139	Mr. Bucket	665	" George , "
334146	334193	334138	334139	Mr. Bucket	665	" it is certainly possible , because it 's the case . This deed was done last night at ten o'clock . Now , you know where you were last night at ten o'clock , and you 'll be able to prove it , no doubt . "
334194	334201	334203	334204	the trooper	3804	" Last night ! Last night ? "
334213	334225	334138	334139	Mr. Bucket	665	" Why , great heaven , I was there last night ! "
334226	334234	334236	334237	Mr. Bucket	665	" So I have understood , George , "
334242	334318	334319	334320	The trooper	3804	" So I have understood . Likewise you 've been very often there . You 've been seen hanging about the place , and you 've been heard more than once in a wrangle with him , and it 's possible - I do n't say it 's certainly so , mind you , but it 's possible - that he may have been heard to call you a threatening , murdering , dangerous fellow . "
334334	334339	334341	334342	Mr. Bucket	665	" Now , George , "
334363	334491	334345	334345	his	665	" my wish is , as it has been all the evening , to make things pleasant . I tell you plainly there 's a reward out , of a hundred guineas , offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . You and me have always been pleasant together ; but I have got a duty to discharge ; and if that hundred guineas is to be made , it may as well be made by me as any other man . On all of which accounts , I should hope it was clear to you that I must have you , and that I 'm damned if I do n't have you . Am I to call in any assistance , or is the trick done ? "
334504	334507	334508	334508	he	515	" Come , "
334511	334516	334508	334508	he	515	" I am ready . "
334517	334520	334522	334523	Mr. Bucket	665	" George , "
334525	334530	334522	334523	Mr. Bucket	665	" wait a bit ! "
334558	334573	334548	334548	he	665	" This is a serious charge , George , and such is my duty . "
334596	334603	334586	334586	his	3804	" There ! Put them on ! "
334612	334654	334657	334657	he	665	" How do you find them ? Are they comfortable ? If not , say so , for I wish to make things as pleasant as is consistent with my duty , and I 've got another pair in my pocket . "
334679	334696	334698	334698	he	665	" They 'll do as they are ? Very well ! Now , you see , George "
334715	334740	334698	334698	he	665	" I was mindful of your feelings when I come out , and brought this on purpose . There ! Who 's the wiser ? "
334741	334745	334747	334748	the trooper	3804	" Only I , "
334750	334771	334747	334748	the trooper	3804	" but as I know it , do me one more good turn and pull my hat over my eyes . "
334772	334792	334698	334698	he	665	" Really , though ! Do you mean it ? Ai n't it a pity ? It looks so . "
334793	334808	334809	334810	Mr. George	515	" I ca n't look chance men in the face with these things on , "
334814	334827	334809	334810	Mr. George	515	" Do , for God 's sake , pull my hat forward . "
335443	335491	335431	335432	my guardian	10304	" Now , little woman , little woman , this will never do . Constant dropping will wear away a stone , and constant coaching will wear out a Dame Durden . We will go to London for a while and take possession of our old lodgings . "
335492	335500	335502	335502	I	0	" Not for me , dear guardian , "
335504	335511	335502	335502	I	0	" for I never feel tired , "
335528	335533	335535	335536	my guardian	10304	" For me then , "
335538	335561	335535	335536	my guardian	10304	" or for Ada , or for both of us . It is somebody 's birthday to - morrow , I think . "
335562	335569	335571	335571	I	0	" Truly I think it is , "
335587	335590	335592	335593	my guardian	10304	" Well , "
335601	335659	335592	335593	my guardian	10304	" that 's a great occasion and will give my fair cousin some necessary business to transact in assertion of her independence , and will make London a more convenient place for all of us . So to London we will go . That being settled , there is another thing - how have you left Caddy ? "
335660	335681	335592	335593	my guardian	10304	" Very unwell , guardian . I fear it will be some time before she regains her health and strength . "
335682	335692	335694	335695	my guardian	10304	" What do you call some time , now ? "
335698	335706	335694	335695	my guardian	10304	" Some weeks , I am afraid . "
335707	335710	335711	335711	He	10304	" Ah ! "
335734	335754	335711	335711	He	10304	" Now , what do you say about her doctor ? Is he a good doctor , my love ? "
335790	335796	335798	335799	my guardian	10304	" Well , you know , "
335802	335807	335798	335799	my guardian	10304	" there 's Woodcourt . "
335845	335856	335835	335836	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" You do n't object to him , little woman ? "
335857	335867	335892	335892	her	7551	" Object to him , guardian ? Oh no ! "
335868	335881	335835	335836	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" And you do n't think the patient would object to him ? "
335934	335938	335940	335941	my guardian	10304	" Very good , "
335943	335966	335940	335941	my guardian	10304	" He has been here to - day , my dear , and I will see him about it to - morrow . "
336838	336854	336834	336834	she	304	" Well , Caddy , child , and how do you do to - day ? "
337070	337074	337075	337075	he	10425	" My Caroline , "
337091	337102	337075	337075	he	10425	" Tell me that you are better to - day . "
337103	337115	337116	337116	Caddy	304	" Oh , much better , thank you , Mr. Turveydrop , "
337120	337139	337116	337116	Caddy	304	" Delighted ! Enchanted ! And our dear Miss Summerson . She is not quite prostrated by fatigue ? "
337176	337181	337182	337182	I	0	" Not at all , "
337187	337219	337221	337221	he	10425	" Charming ! We must take care of our dear Caroline , Miss Summerson . We must spare nothing that will restore her . We must nourish her . My dear Caroline "
337237	337276	337277	337277	he	10425	" want for nothing , my love . Frame a wish and gratify it , my daughter . Everything this house contains , everything my room contains , is at your service , my dear . Do not , "
337287	337317	337277	337277	he	10425	" even allow my simple requirements to be considered if they should at any time interfere with your own , my Caroline . Your necessities are greater than mine . "
337358	337364	337365	337365	he	10425	" Nay , my dears , "
337399	337438	337439	337439	He	10425	" Nay , nay ! I have promised never to leave ye . Be dutiful and affectionate towards me , and I ask no other return . Now , bless ye ! I am going to the Park . "
338320	338326	338333	338333	his	10304	" So , Dame Trot , "
338359	338360	338333	338333	his	10304	" "
338363	338367	338333	338333	his	10304	" I said ; "
338385	338386	338383	338383	guardian	1915	" "
338392	338396	338383	338383	guardian	1915	" he returned , "
338402	338416	338383	338383	guardian	1915	" So did I too , for that matter . I said so . "
338440	338493	338437	338438	little woman	1937	" I laughed as I worked and replied that I was not sure about that , for it might spoil him , and he might not be so useful , and there might be many who could ill spare him . As Miss Flite , and Caddy herself , and many others . "
338496	338501	338437	338438	little woman	1937	" said my guardian . "
338554	338571	338547	338548	household goddess	7625	" That was quite another thing , I said . We must all agree in that . "
338576	338581	338547	338548	household goddess	7625	" said my guardian . "
338667	338668	338686	338687	little woman	1937	" "
338678	338681	338686	338687	little woman	1937	" said I. "
338689	338694	338686	338687	little woman	1937	" my guardian assented . "
338734	338740	338725	338725	You	1937	" I shook my head . "
338743	338748	338725	338725	You	1937	" said my guardian . "
338757	338798	338753	338753	I	0	" As there was a little pause here , which I thought , for my dear girl 's satisfaction , had better be filled up , I hummed an air as I worked which was a favourite with my guardian . "
338810	338823	338801	338801	you	0	" I asked him when I had hummed it quietly all through . "
338856	338857	338861	338861	he	448	" "
338877	338881	338858	338858	I	0	" said I ; "
338903	338904	338898	338898	guardian	1915	" "
338910	339113	338907	338908	little woman	1937	" he replied . I was sitting in my usual place , which was now beside my guardian 's chair . That had not been my usual place before the letter , but it was now . I looked up to Ada , who was sitting opposite , and I saw , as she looked at me , that her eyes were filled with tears and that tears were falling down her face . I felt that I had only to be placid and merry once for all to undeceive my dear and set her loving heart at rest . I really was so , and I had nothing to do but to be myself . So I made my sweet girl lean upon my shoulder - how little thinking what was heavy on her mind ! - and I said she was not quite well , and put my arm about her , and took her upstairs . When we were in our own room , and when she might perhaps have told me what I was so unprepared to hear , I gave her no encouragement to confide in me ; I never thought she stood in need of it . "
339121	339125	339119	339119	Esther	283	" said Ada , "
339147	339148	339141	339141	John	250	" "
339154	339158	339159	339159	Ada	294	" I remonstrated . "
339169	339183	339159	339159	Ada	294	" Ada only dropped her head and pressed me closer to her heart . "
339193	339199	339222	339222	You	294	" said I , smiling , "
339264	339265	339270	339270	Esther	283	" "
339272	339273	339270	339270	Esther	283	" "
339280	339284	339270	339270	Esther	283	" said I , "
339300	339301	339294	339294	you	294	" "
339307	339311	339305	339305	Esther	283	" returned Ada . "
339352	339515	339516	339516	She	7646	" I looked at my child in some wonder , but I thought it better not to answer otherwise than by cheering her , and so I turned off into many little recollections of our life together and prevented her from saying more . When she lay down to sleep , and not before , I returned to my guardian to say good night , and then I came back to Ada and sat near her for a little while . She was asleep , and I thought as I looked at her that she was a little changed . I had thought so more than once lately . I could not decide , even looking at her while she was unconscious , how she was changed , but something in the familiar beauty of her face looked different to me . My guardian 's old hopes of her and Richard arose sorrowfully in my mind , and I said to myself , "
339523	339830	339516	339516	She	7646	" and I wondered how that love would end . When I had come home from Caddy 's while she was ill , I had often found Ada at work , and she had always put her work away , and I had never known what it was . Some of it now lay in a drawer near her , which was not quite closed . I did not open the drawer , but I still rather wondered what the work could he , for it was evidently nothing for herself . And I noticed as I kissed my dear that she lay with one hand under her pillow so that it was hidden . How much less amiable I must have been than they thought me , how much less amiable than I thought myself , to be so preoccupied with my own cheerfulness and contentment as to think that it only rested with me to put my dear girl right and set her mind at peace ! But I lay down , self - deceived , in that belief . And I awoke in it next day to find that there was still the same shade between me and my darling . CHAPTER LI Enlightened When Mr. Woodcourt arrived in London , he went , that very same day , to Mr. Vholes 's in Symond 's Inn . For he never once , from the moment when I entreated him to be a friend to Richard , neglected or forgot his promise . He had told me that he accepted the charge as a sacred trust , and he was ever true to it in that spirit . He found Mr. Vholes in his office and informed Mr. Vholes of his agreement with Richard that he should call there to learn his address . "
339836	339841	339834	339834	sir	9569	" said Mr. Vholes . "
339876	339896	339900	339900	sir	9569	" Mr. Woodcourt thanked Mr. Vholes , but he had no business with him beyond what he had mentioned . "
339907	339924	339902	339902	I	0	" said Mr. Vholes , still quietly insisting on the seat by not giving the address , "
339940	339941	339937	339937	you	9569	" "
339950	339955	339937	339937	you	9569	" returned Mr. Woodcourt ; "
339963	339964	339965	339965	Sir	9569	" "
339967	339982	339965	339965	Sir	9569	" rejoined Mr. Vholes , self - contained as usual , voice and all , "
340059	340067	340053	340053	I	0	" Mr. Woodcourt again mentioned the address . "
340074	340079	340053	340053	I	0	" said Mr. Vholes . "

340215	340233	340213	340213	sir	9569	" said Mr. Vholes , bringing his hand flat down upon his desk in a positive manner , "
340236	340237	340238	340238	You	9569	" "
340243	340248	340238	340238	You	9569	" returned Mr. Woodcourt , "
340265	340266	340250	340250	I	0	" "
340272	340277	340250	340250	I	0	" retorted Mr. Vholes . "
340357	340358	340376	340376	his	10220	" "
340361	340366	340376	340376	his	10220	" replied Mr. Woodcourt , "
340379	340380	340384	340384	sir	9569	" "
340386	340392	340393	340393	I	0	" said Mr. Vholes parenthetically , "
340597	340611	340612	340612	I	0	" Mr. Woodcourt rather sternly rejoined that he was glad to hear it . "
340617	340622	340615	340615	sir	9569	" said Mr. Vholes , "
340707	340708	340694	340694	My	0	" "

340775	340909	340771	340771	I	0	" Upon this Mr. Woodcourt wished Mr. Vholes good day and went in search of Richard , the change in whose appearance he began to understand now but too well . He found him in a dull room , fadedly furnished , much as I had found him in his barrack - room but a little while before , except that he was not writing but was sitting with a book before him , from which his eyes and thoughts were far astray . As the door chanced to be standing open , Mr. Woodcourt was in his presence for some moments without being perceived , and he told me that he never could forget the haggardness of his face and the dejection of his manner before he was aroused from his dream . "
340916	340926	340910	340910	Woodcourt	448	" cried Richard , starting up with extended hands , "
340936	340937	340938	340940	A friendly one	7689	" "
340942	340946	340938	340940	A friendly one	7689	" he replied , "
340968	340977	340952	340952	they	7690	" They were seated now , near together . "
340985	340999	340952	340952	they	7690	" said Richard , ' speaking at least for my part of it . "
341000	341006	340952	340952	they	7690	" What part is that ? "
341007	341012	340952	340952	they	7690	" The Chancery part . "
341013	341018	341020	341021	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" I never heard , "
341027	341034	341024	341024	his	448	" of its going well yet . "
341035	341039	341041	341041	Richard	295	" Nor I , "
341044	341049	341041	341041	Richard	295	" Who ever did ? "
341063	341219	341050	341050	He	448	" Woodcourt , I should be sorry to be misunderstood by you , even if I gained by it in your estimation . You must know that I have done no good this long time . I have not intended to do much harm , but I seem to have been capable of nothing else . It may be that I should have done better by keeping out of the net into which my destiny has worked me , but I think not , though I dare say you will soon hear , if you have not already heard , a very different opinion . To make short of a long story , I am afraid I have wanted an object ; but I have an object now - or it has me - and it is too late to discuss it . Take me as I am , and make the best of me . "
341220	341224	341226	341227	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" A bargain , "
341229	341238	341226	341227	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" Do as much by me in return . "
341239	341244	341246	341246	Richard	295	" Oh ! You , "
341248	341288	341289	341289	He	448	" you can pursue your art for its own sake , and can put your hand upon the plough and never turn , and can strike a purpose out of anything . You and I are very different creatures . "
341302	341307	341308	341308	he	448	" Well , well ! "
341315	341341	341308	341308	he	448	" Everything has an end . We shall see ! So you will take me as I am , and make the best of me ? "
341342	341349	341350	341350	They	7692	" Aye ! Indeed I will . "
341375	341382	341384	341384	Richard	295	" You come as a godsend , "
341386	341452	341384	341384	Richard	295	" for I have seen nobody here yet but Vholes . Woodcourt , there is one subject I should like to mention , for once and for all , in the beginning of our treaty . You can hardly make the best of me if I do n't . You know , I dare say , that I have an attachment to my cousin Ada ? "
341465	341469	341471	341471	Richard	295	" Now pray , "
341473	341536	341471	341471	Richard	295	" do n't think me a heap of selfishness . Do n't suppose that I am splitting my head and half breaking my heart over this miserable Chancery suit for my own rights and interests alone . Ada 's are bound up with mine ; they ca n't be separated ; Vholes works for both of us . Do think of that ! "
341560	341564	341566	341566	Richard	295	" You see , "
341589	341672	341566	341566	Richard	295	" to an upright fellow like you , bringing a friendly face like yours here , I can not bear the thought of appearing selfish and mean . I want to see Ada righted , Woodcourt , as well as myself ; I want to do my utmost to right her , as well as myself ; I venture what I can scrape together to extricate her , as well as myself . Do , I beseech you , think of that ! "
341828	341832	341834	341834	I	0	" My dear , "
341836	341853	341834	341834	I	0	" you have not had any difference with Richard since I have been so much away ? "
341854	341859	341870	341870	I.	0	" No , Esther . "
341860	341868	341870	341870	I.	0	" Not heard of him , perhaps ? "
341871	341880	341882	341882	Ada	294	" Yes , I have heard of him , "
342109	342129	342131	342131	I.	0	" We are not likely to be far out , my love , if we go in that direction , "
342164	342173	342174	342174	I	0	" Or Mr. Vholes 's office will do , "
342177	342187	342174	342174	I	0	" for Mr. Vholes 's office is next door . "
342348	342357	342358	342358	he	7709	" If you had come a little earlier , "
342361	342447	342358	342358	he	7709	" you would have found Woodcourt here . There never was such a good fellow as Woodcourt is . He finds time to look in between - whiles , when anybody else with half his work to do would be thinking about not being able to come . And he is so cheery , so fresh , so sensible , so earnest , so - everything that I am not , that the place brightens whenever he comes , and darkens whenever he goes again . "
342448	342453	342454	342454	I	0	" God bless him , "
342457	342464	342454	342454	I	0	" for his truth to me ! "
342465	342474	342476	342476	Richard	295	" He is not so sanguine , Ada , "
342488	342533	342479	342479	his	7710	" as Vholes and I are usually , but he is only an outsider and is not in the mysteries . We have gone into them , and he has not . He ca n't be expected to know much of such a labyrinth . "
342580	342596	342598	342598	I.	0	" Is this a healthy place to live in , Richard , do you think ? "
342599	342606	342608	342608	Richard	295	" Why , my dear Minerva , "
342615	342668	342608	342608	Richard	295	" it is neither a rural nor a cheerful place ; and when the sun shines here , you may lay a pretty heavy wager that it is shining brightly in an open spot . But it 's well enough for the time . It 's near the offices and near Vholes . "
342669	342672	342673	342673	I	0	" Perhaps , "
342676	342682	342673	342673	I	0	" a change from both - "
342683	342689	342691	342691	Richard	295	" Might do me good ? "
342702	342760	342691	342691	Richard	295	" I should n't wonder ! But it can only come in one way now - in one of two ways , I should rather say . Either the suit must be ended , Esther , or the suitor . But it shall be the suit , my dear girl , the suit , my dear girl ! "
342793	342800	342776	342776	Her	294	" We are doing very well , "
342804	342861	342802	342802	Richard	295	" Vholes will tell you so . We are really spinning along . Ask Vholes . We are giving them no rest . Vholes knows all their windings and turnings , and we are upon them everywhere . We have astonished them already . We shall rouse up that nest of sleepers , mark my words ! "
343001	343010	343012	343012	Richard	295	" The sight of our dear little woman , "
343021	343041	343014	343014	Ada	294	" is so natural to me , and her compassionate face is so like the face of old days - "
343055	343066	343068	343068	Richard	295	" - So exactly like the face of old days , "
343087	343129	343131	343131	Richard	295	" that I ca n't make pretences with her . I fluctuate a little ; that 's the truth . Sometimes I hope , my dear , and sometimes I - do n't quite despair , but nearly . I get , "
343147	343162	343163	343163	I	0	" He took a few turns up and down and sunk upon the sofa . "
343166	343183	343184	343184	He	0	" he repeated gloomily , ' so tired . It is such weary , weary work ! "
343253	343258	343259	343259	she	1266	" Esther , dear , "
343264	343272	343259	343259	she	1266	" I am not going home again . "
343283	343323	343259	343259	she	1266	" Never any more . I am going to stay with my dear husband . We have been married above two months . Go home without me , my own Esther ; I shall never go home any more ! "
343365	343373	343375	343375	Richard	295	" Speak to Esther , my dearest , "
343382	343389	343375	343375	Richard	295	" Tell her how it was . "
343425	343429	343431	343431	I.	0	" My pet , "
343432	343442	343431	343431	I.	0	" My love . My poor , poor girl ! "
343471	343486	343454	343454	Richard	295	" Esther , will you forgive me ? Will my cousin John forgive me ? "
343487	343491	343493	343493	I	0	" My dear , "
343495	343515	343493	343493	I	0	" to doubt it for a moment is to do him a great wrong . And as to me ! "
343590	343598	343599	343599	Ada	294	" All I had was Richard 's , "
343602	343627	343599	343599	Ada	294	" and Richard would not take it , Esther , and what could I do but be his wife when I loved him dearly ! "
343628	343643	343645	343645	Richard	295	" And you were so fully and so kindly occupied , excellent Dame Durden , "
343647	343681	343645	343645	Richard	295	" that how could we speak to you at such a time ! And besides , it was not a long - considered step . We went out one morning and were married . "
343682	343691	343693	343694	my darling	1266	" And when it was done , Esther , "
343696	343757	343693	343694	my darling	1266	" I was always thinking how to tell you and what to do for the best . And sometimes I thought you ought to know it directly , and sometimes I thought you ought not to know it and keep it from my cousin John ; and I could not tell what to do , and I fretted very much . "
344094	344110	344086	344086	I	0	" Now Esther , if you do , I 'll never speak to you again ! "
344111	344117	344119	344119	I	0	" Why , I declare , "
344121	344153	344119	344119	I	0	" I never saw such a wife . I do n't think she loves her husband at all . Here , Richard , take my child , for goodness ' sake . "
344176	344185	344187	344187	I	0	" I give this dear young couple notice , "
344189	344255	344187	344187	I	0	" that I am only going away to come back to - morrow and that I shall be always coming backwards and forwards until Symond 's Inn is tired of the sight of me . So I shall not say good - bye , Richard . For what would be the use of that , you know , when I am coming back so soon ! "
345023	345027	345029	345029	he	10304	" Little woman , "
345031	345037	345029	345029	he	10304	" You have been crying . "
345038	345045	345047	345047	I	0	" Why , yes , guardian , "
345049	345075	345047	345047	I	0	" I am afraid I have been , a little . Ada has been in such distress , and is so very sorry , guardian . "
345107	345115	345116	345116	I	0	" Is she married , my dear ? "
345133	345141	345143	345143	he	10304	" She has no need of it , "
345145	345153	345143	345143	he	10304	" Heaven bless her and her husband ! "
345170	345183	345184	345186	Neither of us	7762	" Poor girl , poor girl ! Poor Rick ! Poor Ada ! "
345198	345212	345192	345192	he	10304	" Well , well , my dear ! Bleak House is thinning fast . "
345213	345221	345192	345192	he	10304	" But its mistress remains , guardian . "
345243	345255	345257	345257	I.	0	" She will do all she can to make it happy , "
345258	345266	345257	345257	I.	0	" She will succeed , my love ! "
345318	345338	345304	345304	his	10304	" She will succeed , my dear . Nevertheless , Bleak House is thinning fast , O little woman ! "
345702	345717	345654	345654	they	10304	" Guardian , you do n't think it possible that he is justly accused ? "
345718	345802	345811	345812	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" My dear , I CAN'T think so . This man whom we have seen so open- hearted and compassionate , who with the might of a giant has the gentleness of a child , who looks as brave a fellow as ever lived and is so simple and quiet with it , this man justly accused of such a crime ? I ca n't believe it . It 's not that I do n't or I wo n't . I ca n't ! "
345803	345809	345811	345812	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" And I ca n't , "
345814	345925	345811	345812	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" Still , whatever we believe or know of him , we had better not forget that some appearances are against him . He bore an animosity towards the deceased gentleman . He has openly mentioned it in many places . He is said to have expressed himself violently towards him , and he certainly did about him , to my knowledge . He admits that he was alone on the scene of the murder within a few minutes of its commission . I sincerely believe him to be as innocent of any participation in it as I am , but these are all reasons for suspicion falling upon him . "
345926	345929	345935	345935	he	10304	" True , "
345942	345969	345935	345935	he	10304	" It would be doing him a very bad service , my dear , to shut our eyes to the truth in any of these respects . "
346021	346025	346027	346028	my guardian	10304	" Heaven forbid ! "
346030	346050	346051	346051	He	10304	" We will stand by him , as he himself stood by the two poor creatures who are gone . "
346477	346495	346497	346497	he	3804	" This is a load off my mind , I do assure you , miss and gentlemen , "
346510	346523	346497	346497	he	3804	" And now I do n't so much care how it ends . "
346550	346566	346568	346569	Mr. George	515	" This is even a rougher place than my gallery to receive a lady in , "
346571	346584	346568	346569	Mr. George	515	" but I know Miss Summerson will make the best of it . "
346611	346618	346620	346620	he	515	" I thank you , miss , "
346622	346627	346620	346620	he	515	" Now , George , "
346632	346654	346620	346620	he	515	" as we require no new assurances on your part , so I believe we need give you none on ours . "
346655	346728	346729	346729	He	7805	" Not at all , sir . I thank you with all my heart . If I was not innocent of this crime , I could n't look at you and keep my secret to myself under the condescension of the present visit . I feel the present visit very much . I am not one of the eloquent sort , but I feel it , Miss Summerson and gentlemen , deeply . "
346767	346770	346772	346773	my guardian	10304	" First , "
346775	346787	346772	346773	my guardian	10304	" can we do anything for your personal comfort , George ? "
346788	346794	346795	346795	he	10304	" For which , sir ? "
346802	346822	346795	346795	he	10304	" For your personal comfort . Is there anything you want that would lessen the hardship of this confinement ? "
346823	346828	346830	346830	George	515	" Well , sir , "
346837	346860	346830	346830	George	515	" I am equally obliged to you , but tobacco being against the rules , I ca n't say that there is . "
346861	346885	346795	346795	he	10304	" You will think of many little things perhaps , by and by . Whenever you do , George , let us know . "
346886	346894	346896	346897	Mr. George	515	" Thank you , sir . Howsoever , "
346905	346944	346896	346897	Mr. George	515	" a man who has been knocking about the world in a vagabond kind of a way as long as I have gets on well enough in a place like the present , so far as that goes . "
346945	346953	346955	346956	my guardian	10304	" Next , as to your case , "
346958	346964	346966	346967	Mr. George	515	" Exactly so , sir , "
346985	346992	346970	346970	his	515	" How does it stand now ? "
346993	347055	346966	346967	Mr. George	515	" Why , sir , it is under remand at present . Bucket gives me to understand that he will probably apply for a series of remands from time to time until the case is more complete . How it is to be made more complete I do n't myself see , but I dare say Bucket will manage it somehow . "
347056	347065	347072	347072	his	10304	" Why , heaven save us , man , "
347078	347090	347072	347072	his	10304	" you talk of yourself as if you were somebody else ! "
347091	347097	347099	347100	Mr. George	515	" No offence , sir , "
347102	347148	347099	347100	Mr. George	515	" I am very sensible of your kindness . But I do n't see how an innocent man is to make up his mind to this kind of thing without knocking his head against the walls unless he takes it in that point of view . "
347158	347165	347099	347100	Mr. George	515	" returned my guardian , softened . "
347183	347184	347187	347187	sir	9569	" "
347258	347259	347302	347303	a lawyer	11981	" "
347268	347273	347302	347303	a lawyer	11981	" rejoined my guardian . "
347290	347298	347299	347299	You	9569	" Mr. George good - humouredly observed . "
347305	347310	347299	347299	You	9569	" pursued my guardian . "
347320	347321	347322	347322	I	0	" "
347329	347338	347322	347322	I	0	" said Mr. George with a step backward . "
347358	347359	347345	347345	I	0	" "
347367	347368	347360	347360	You	9569	" "
347373	347385	347371	347371	sir	9569	" Mr. George shook his head in the most emphatic manner . "
347400	347401	347397	347398	no lawyer	7823	" "
347405	347406	347407	347407	I	0	" "
347416	347421	347422	347422	Gridley	462	" said Mr. George . "
347448	347449	347444	347444	yourself	9569	" "
347454	347465	347470	347470	George	515	" my guardian explained , a little at a loss ; "
347472	347473	347470	347470	George	515	" "
347481	347492	347479	347479	sir	9569	" returned the trooper in his off - hand manner . "
347515	347609	347509	347509	I	0	" Unfolding his arms and changing his position , he stood with one massive hand upon the table and the other on his hip , as complete a picture of a man who was not to be moved from a fixed purpose as ever I saw . It was in vain that we all three talked to him and endeavoured to persuade him ; he listened with that gentleness which went so well with his bluff bearing , but was evidently no more shaken by our representations that his place of confinement was . "
347619	347622	347616	347617	Mr. George	515	" said I. "

347646	347650	347644	347644	miss	9656	" he returned , "
347706	347746	347747	347747	You	9656	" He looked at us all three in turn , shook his head a little as if he were adjusting it in the stock and collar of a tight uniform , and after a moment 's reflection went on . "
347880	347899	347900	347900	I	0	" He rubbed his swarthy forehead for a moment with a good - humoured look and said apologetically , "
347915	347928	347909	347909	I	0	" Having thought a bit , he looked up again and resumed . "
348088	348125	348085	348086	a lawyer	11981	" He stopped on hearing some one at the locks and bolts and did not resume until the door had been opened and was shut again . For what purpose opened , I will mention presently . "
348304	348324	348325	348325	I	0	" He had warmed into his subject now , and was under no further necessity to wait a bit . "
348348	348364	348341	348341	I	0	" looking round upon us with his powerful arms akimbo and his dark eyebrows raised , "
348484	348509	348510	348510	I	0	" Taking a pace or two over the stone floor , he came back to the table and finished what he had to say . "
348671	348761	348665	348665	I	0	" The door had been opened to admit another soldier - looking man of less prepossessing appearance at first sight and a weather - tanned , bright - eyed wholesome woman with a basket , who , from her entrance , had been exceedingly attentive to all Mr. George had said . Mr. George had received them with a familiar nod and a friendly look , but without any more particular greeting in the midst of his address . He now shook them cordially by the hand and said , "
348787	348805	348784	348785	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" Mr. Bagnet made us a stiff military bow , and Mrs. Bagnet dropped us a curtsy . "
348815	348820	348812	348812	they	7861	" sald Mr. George . "
348830	348831	348833	348837	a second - hand wiolinceller	7863	" "
348839	348850	348833	348837	a second - hand wiolinceller	7863	" Mr. Bagnet put in , twitching his head angrily . "
348867	348868	348869	348869	Mat	552	" "
348871	348876	348869	348869	Mat	552	" said Mr. George , "
348902	348916	348917	348918	Old girl	13315	" Mr. Bagnet , after considering , referred the point to his wife . "
348920	348924	348926	348926	him	7868	" said he . "
348937	348938	348934	348934	my	0	" "
348943	348977	348941	348941	George	515	" exclaimed Mrs. Bagnet , who had been unpacking her basket , in which there was a piece of cold pickled pork , a little tea and sugar , and a brown loaf , "
349039	349040	349037	349037	George	515	" "
349054	349060	349051	349052	Mrs. Bagnet	553	" said the trooper lightly . "
349067	349072	349074	349074	they	7870	" cried Mrs. Bagnet , "
349139	349140	349133	349134	the gentleman	1117	" "
349148	349153	349143	349146	a very sensible woman	7877	" said my guardian . "
349164	349165	349156	349156	you	515	" "
349171	349175	349156	349156	you	515	" she returned . "
349192	349209	349211	349211	he	515	" Mrs. Bagnet left her basket to point him out with both her bare brown hands . "
349284	349289	349280	349280	I	0	" cried Mrs. Bagnet . "
349319	349382	349316	349316	I	0	" Her friendly indignation had an exemplary effect upon her husband , who shook his head at the trooper several times as a silent recommendation to him to yield . Between whiles , Mrs. Bagnet looked at me ; and I understood from the play of her eyes that she wished me to do something , though I did not comprehend what . "
349399	349419	349384	349384	I	0	" said Mrs. Bagnet as she blew a little dust off the pickled pork , looking at me again ; "
349460	349461	349443	349443	you	515	" "
349469	349474	349462	349462	I	0	" returned the trooper . "
349481	349494	349476	349476	you	515	" said Mrs. Bagnet , continuing to grumble on good - humouredly . "
349533	349589	349524	349524	you	515	" Here she again looked at me , and I now perceived from her glances at the door and at me , by turns , that she wished us to retire and to await her following us outside the prison . Communicating this by similar means to my guardian and Mr. Woodcourt , I rose . "
349602	349606	349599	349600	Mr. George	515	" said I , "
349623	349624	349608	349608	we	7886	" "
349637	349641	349631	349631	you	283	" he returned . "
349651	349654	349648	349648	I	0	" said I. "
349690	349742	349657	349657	me	0	" He heard me respectfully but without much heeding these words , which I spoke a little turned from him , already on my way to the door ; he was observing this they afterwards told me my height and figure , which seemed to catch his attention all at once . "
349747	349751	349657	349657	me	0	" said he . "
349761	349770	349754	349754	I	0	" My guardian asked him what he meant . "
349775	349779	349773	349773	sir	9569	" he answered , "
349825	349849	349815	349815	I	0	" For an instant I felt such a shudder as I never felt before or since and hope I shall never feel again . "
349858	349863	349854	349854	I	0	" said the trooper , "
349914	350049	349898	349899	Miss Summerson	283	" I can not separate and define the feelings that arose in me after this ; it is enough that the vague duty and obligation I had felt upon me from the first of following the investigation was , without my distinctly daring to ask myself any question , increased , and that I was indignantly sure of there being no possibility of a reason for my being afraid . We three went out of the prison and walked up and down at some short distance from the gate , which was in a retired place . We had not waited long when Mr. and Mrs. Bagnet came out too and quickly joined us . There was a tear in each of Mrs. Bagnet 's eyes , and her face was flushed and hurried . "
350067	350077	350065	350065	miss	9656	" was her first remark when she came up , "
350090	350091	350079	350079	he	515	" "
350101	350106	350079	350079	he	515	" said my guardian . "
350118	350135	350110	350110	you	7893	" returned Mrs. Bagnet , hurriedly drying her eyes on the hem of her grey cloak , "
350206	350207	350201	350201	Bucket	665	" "
350226	350234	350223	350224	a boy	1293	" Mr. Bagnet added with great solemnity . "
350243	350248	350237	350237	I	0	" said Mrs. Bagnet ; "
350273	350298	350299	350300	Old girl	13315	" Mrs. Bagnet hurried us into a more secluded place and was at first too breathless to proceed , occasioning Mr. Bagnet to say , "
350305	350306	350303	350303	'em	7905	" "
350313	350329	350330	350330	you	0	" the old girl proceeded , untying the strings of her bonnet for more air , "
350361	350362	350356	350356	I	0	" "
350371	350376	350363	350363	You	0	" said my guardian . "
350380	350381	350363	350363	You	0	" "
350390	350409	350384	350384	I	0	" she proceeded , clapping her hands in her hurry and agitation a dozen times in every sentence , "
350490	350528	350480	350480	She	1718	" Instantly Mrs. Bagnet put some pins into her mouth and began pinning up her skirts all round a little higher than the level of her grey cloak , which she accomplished with surpassing dispatch and dexterity . "
350531	350536	350480	350480	She	1718	" said Mrs. Bagnet , "
350565	350566	350553	350553	I	0	" "
350573	350584	350570	350571	the woman	10391	" cried my guardian with his hand in his pocket , "
350596	350630	350632	350632	you	194	" Mrs. Bagnet made another application to her skirts and brought forth a leathern purse in which she hastily counted over a few shillings and which she then shut up with perfect satisfaction . "
350658	350662	350665	350665	yourself	4318	" kissing him , "
350683	350723	350724	350725	Mr. Bagnet	552	" And she actually set off while we three stood looking at one another lost in amazement . She actually trudged away in her grey cloak at a sturdy pace , and turned the corner , and was gone . "
350727	350732	350724	350725	Mr. Bagnet	552	" said my guardian . "
350744	350745	350734	350734	you	552	" "
350751	350755	350757	350757	her	7925	" he returned . "
350803	350804	350806	350806	she	7925	" "
350816	350821	350806	350806	she	7925	" rejoined my guardian , "
350832	350833	350806	350806	she	7925	" "
350844	350862	350834	350834	She	7925	" said Mr. Bagnet , looking at us over his shoulder as he went his way also . "
350884	351649	351652	351652	you	7933	" CHAPTER LIII The Track Mr. Bucket and his fat forefinger are much in consultation together under existing circumstances . When Mr. Bucket has a matter of this pressing interest under his consideration , the fat forefinger seems to rise , to the dignity of a familiar demon . He puts it to his ears , and it whispers information ; he puts it to his lips , and it enjoins him to secrecy ; he rubs it over his nose , and it sharpens his scent ; he shakes it before a guilty man , and it charms him to his destruction . The Augurs of the Detective Temple invariably predict that when Mr. Bucket and that finger are in much conference , a terrible avenger will be heard of before long . Otherwise mildly studious in his observation of human nature , on the whole a benignant philosopher not disposed to be severe upon the follies of mankind , Mr. Bucket pervades a vast number of houses and strolls about an infinity of streets , to outward appearance rather languishing for want of an object . He is in the friendliest condition towards his species and will drink with most of them . He is free with his money , affable in his manners , innocent in his conversation - but through the placid stream of his life there glides an under - current of forefinger . Time and place can not bind Mr. Bucket . Like man in the abstract , he is here to - day and gone to - morrow - but , very unlike man indeed , he is here again the next day . This evening he will be casually looking into the iron extinguishers at the door of Sir Leicester Dedlock 's house in town ; and to - morrow morning he will be walking on the leads at Chesney Wold , where erst the old man walked whose ghost is propitiated with a hundred guineas . Drawers , desks , pockets , all things belonging to him , Mr. Bucket examines . A few hours afterwards , he and the Roman will be alone together comparing forefingers . It is likely that these occupations are irreconcilable with home enjoyment , but it is certain that Mr. Bucket at present does not go home . Though in general he highly appreciates the society of Mrs. Bucket - a lady of a natural detective genius , which if it had been improved by professional exercise , might have done great things , but which has paused at the level of a clever amateur - he holds himself aloof from that dear solace . Mrs. Bucket is dependent on their lodger fortunately an amiable lady in whom she takes an interest for companionship and conversation . A great crowd assembles in Lincoln 's Inn Fields on the day of the funeral . Sir Leicester Dedlock attends the ceremony in person ; strictly speaking , there are only three other human followers , that is to say , Lord Doodle , William Buffy , and the debilitated cousin thrown in as a make - weight , but the amount of inconsolable carriages is immense . The peerage contributes more four - wheeled affliction than has ever been seen in that neighbourhood . Such is the assemblage of armorial bearings on coach panels that the Herald 's College might be supposed to have lost its father and mother at a blow . The Duke of Foodle sends a splendid pile of dust and ashes , with silver wheel - boxes , patent axles , all the last improvements , and three bereaved worms , six feet high , holding on behind , in a bunch of woe . All the state coachmen in London seem plunged into mourning ; and if that dead old man of the rusty garb be not beyond a taste in horseflesh which appears impossible , it must be highly gratified this day . Quiet among the undertakers and the equipages and the calves of so many legs all steeped in grief , Mr. Bucket sits concealed in one of the inconsolable carriages and at his ease surveys the crowd through the lattice blinds . He has a keen eye for a crowd - as for what not ? - and looking here and there , now from this side of the carriage , now from the other , now up at the house windows , now along the people 's heads , nothing escapes him . "
351660	351686	351652	351652	you	7933	" says Mr. Bucket to himself , apostrophizing Mrs. Bucket , stationed , by his favour , on the steps of the deceased 's house . "
351708	351779	351705	351706	Mrs. Bucket	649	" The procession has not started yet , but is waiting for the cause of its assemblage to be brought out . Mr. Bucket , in the foremost emblazoned carriage , uses his two fat forefingers to hold the lattice a hair 's breadth open while he looks . And it says a great deal for his attachment , as a husband , that he is still occupied with Mrs. B. "
351789	351794	351781	351781	you	7933	" he murmuringly repeats . "
351824	352121	351808	351809	Mrs. Bucket	649	" Not another word does Mr. Bucket say , but sits with most attentive eyes until the sacked depository of noble secrets is brought down - Where are all those secrets now ? Does he keep them yet ? Did they fly with him on that sudden journey ? - and until the procession moves , and Mr. Bucket 's view is changed . After which he composes himself for an easy ride and takes note of the fittings of the carriage in case he should ever find such knowledge useful . Contrast enough between Mr. Tulkinghorn shut up in his dark carriage and Mr. Bucket shut up in HIS . Between the immeasurable track of space beyond the little wound that has thrown the one into the fixed sleep which jolts so heavily over the stones of the streets , and the narrow track of blood which keeps the other in the watchful state expressed in every hair of his head ! But it is all one to both ; neither is troubled about that . Mr. Bucket sits out the procession in his own easy manner and glides from the carriage when the opportunity he has settled with himself arrives . He makes for Sir Leicester Dedlock 's , which is at present a sort of home to him , where he comes and goes as he likes at all hours , where he is always welcome and made much of , where he knows the whole establishment , and walks in an atmosphere of mysterious greatness . No knocking or ringing for Mr. Bucket . He has caused himself to be provided with a key and can pass in at his pleasure . As he is crossing the hall , Mercury informs him , "
352136	352142	352129	352130	Mr. Bucket	665	" and gives it him . "
352148	352207	352129	352130	Mr. Bucket	665	" says Mr. Bucket . If Mercury should chance to be possessed by any lingering curiosity as to Mr. Bucket 's letters , that wary person is not the man to gratify it . Mr. Bucket looks at him as if his face were a vista of some miles in length and he were leisurely contemplating the same . "
352216	352229	352209	352209	you	7940	" says Mr. Bucket . Unfortunately Mercury is no snuff - taker . "
352239	352244	352245	352245	Thankee	640	" says Mr. Bucket . "
352266	352474	352264	352264	Thankee	640	" Having leisurely helped himself from a canister borrowed from somebody downstairs for the purpose , and having made a considerable show of tasting it , first with one side of his nose and then with the other , Mr. Bucket , with much deliberation , pronounces it of the right sort and goes on , letter in hand . Now although Mr. Bucket walks upstairs to the little library within the larger one with the face of a man who receives some scores of letters every day , it happens that much correspondence is not incidental to his life . He is no great scribe , rather handling his pen like the pocket - staff he carries about with him always convenient to his grasp , and discourages correspondence with himself in others as being too artless and direct a way of doing delicate business . Further , he often sees damaging letters produced in evidence and has occasion to reflect that it was a green thing to write them . For these reasons he has very little to do with letters , either as sender or receiver . And yet he has received a round half - dozen within the last twenty - four hours . "
352478	352490	352264	352264	Thankee	640	" says Mr. Bucket , spreading it out on the table , "
352505	352544	352545	352546	Lady Dedlock	266	" What two words ? He turns the key in the door , ungirdles his black pocket - book book of fate to many , lays another letter by it , and reads , boldly written in each , "
352548	352549	352545	352546	Lady Dedlock	266	" "
352554	352559	352545	352546	Lady Dedlock	266	" says Mr. Bucket . "
352572	352750	352545	352546	Lady Dedlock	266	" Having put the letters in his book of fate and girdled it up again , he unlocks the door just in time to admit his dinner , which is brought upon a goodly tray with a decanter of sherry . Mr. Bucket frequently observes , in friendly circles where there is no restraint , that he likes a toothful of your fine old brown East Inder sherry better than anything you can offer him . Consequently he fills and empties his glass with a smack of his lips and is proceeding with his refreshment when an idea enters his mind . Mr. Bucket softly opens the door of communication between that room and the next and looks in . The library is deserted , and the fire is sinking low . Mr. Bucket 's eye , after taking a pigeon - flight round the room , alights upon a table where letters are usually put as they arrive . Several letters for Sir Leicester are upon it . Mr. Bucket draws near and examines the directions . "
352753	352757	352545	352546	Lady Dedlock	266	" he says , "
352789	352893	352774	352774	I	0	" With that he returns to finish his dinner with a good appetite , and after a light nap , is summoned into the drawing - room . Sir Leicester has received him there these several evenings past to know whether he has anything to report . The debilitated cousin much exhausted by the funeral and Volumnia are in attendance . Mr. Bucket makes three distinctly different bows to these three people . A bow of homage to Sir Leicester , a bow of gallantry to Volumnia , and a bow of recognition to the debilitated Cousin , to whom it airily says , "
352911	352927	352907	352907	I	0	" Having distributed these little specimens of his tact , Mr. Bucket rubs his hands . "
352937	352942	352929	352929	you	7942	" inquires Sir Leicester . "
352955	352956	352944	352944	you	7942	" "
352970	352971	352968	352968	Baronet	268	" "
352976	352981	352968	352968	Baronet	268	" pursues Sir Leicester , "
353001	353021	353022	353022	I	0	" Mr. Bucket coughs and glances at Volumnia , rouged and necklaced , as though he would respectfully observe , "
353049	353103	353045	353045	I	0	" The fair Volumnia , not quite unconscious perhaps of the humanizing influence of her charms , pauses in the writing of cocked - hat notes and meditatively adjusts the pearl necklace . Mr. Bucket prices that decoration in his mind and thinks it as likely as not that Volumnia is writing poetry . "
353109	353114	353105	353105	I	0	" pursues Sir Leicester , "
353190	353206	353207	353207	My	0	" Mr. Bucket made Sir Leicester 's bow again as a response to this liberality . "
353210	353219	353207	353207	My	0	" Sir Leicester adds with a generous warmth , "
353279	353309	353310	353310	I	0	" Sir Leicester 's voice trembles and his grey hair stirs upon his head . Tears are in his eyes ; the best part of his nature is aroused . "
353313	353317	353310	353310	I	0	" he says , "
353517	353569	353595	353595	he	7950	" While he makes this protestation with great emotion and earnestness , looking round the room as if he were addressing an assembly , Mr. Bucket glances at him with an observant gravity in which there might be , but for the audacity of the thought , a touch of compassion . "
353577	353593	353595	353595	he	7950	" continues Sir Leicester , ' strikingly illustrative of the respect in which my deceased friend "
353609	353654	353655	353656	Mr. Bucket	665	" was held by the flower of the land , has , I say , aggravated the shock I have received from this most horrible and audacious crime . If it were my brother who had committed it , I would not spare him . "
353675	353688	353690	353691	Mr. Bucket	665	" You must feel it as a deprivation to you , miss , "
353694	353712	353690	353691	Mr. Bucket	665	" no doubt . He was calculated to BE a deprivation , I 'm sure he was . "
353786	353796	353798	353799	Mr. Bucket	665	" It gives a start to a delicate female , "
353802	353809	353798	353799	Mr. Bucket	665	" but it 'll wear off . "
353864	353871	353886	353886	his	665	" Why you see , miss , "
353894	353897	353890	353890	he	665	" my dear "
353899	353933	353890	353890	he	665	" it ai n't easy to answer those questions at the present moment . Not at the present moment . I 've kept myself on this case , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , "
353947	354024	353935	353936	Mr. Bucket	665	" morning , noon , and night . But for a glass or two of sherry , I do n't think I could have had my mind so much upon the stretch as it has been . I COULD answer your questions , miss , but duty forbids it . Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , will very soon be made acquainted with all that has been traced . And I hope that he may find it "
354032	354037	354026	354027	Mr. Bucket	665	" to his satisfaction . "
354086	354096	354098	354099	Mr. Bucket	665	" YOU know life , you know , sir , "
354113	354173	354175	354176	Mr. Bucket	665	" and you can confirm what I 've mentioned to this lady . YOU do n't want to be told that from information I have received I have gone to work . You 're up to what a lady ca n't be expected to be up to . Lord ! Especially in your elevated station of society , miss , "
354185	354189	354175	354176	Mr. Bucket	665	" my dear . "
354190	354196	354198	354199	Sir Leicester	268	" The officer , Volumnia , "
354201	354212	354198	354199	Sir Leicester	268	" is faithful to his duty , and perfectly right . "
354217	354233	354213	354214	Mr. Bucket	665	" Glad to have the honour of your approbation , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . "
354234	354240	354242	354243	Sir Leicester	268	" In fact , Volumnia , "
354245	354314	354316	354317	Sir Leicester	268	" it is not holding up a good model for imitation to ask the officer any such questions as you have put to him . He is the best judge of his own responsibility ; he acts upon his responsibility . And it does not become us , who assist in making the laws , to impede or interfere with those who carry them into execution . Or , "
354335	354343	354344	354344	Volumnia	561	" or who vindicate their outraged majesty . "
354391	354397	354399	354400	Sir Leicester	268	" Very well , Volumnia , "
354402	354411	354399	354400	Sir Leicester	268	" Then you can not be too discreet . "
354425	354490	354412	354413	Mr. Bucket	665	" Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I have no objections to telling this lady , with your leave and among ourselves , that I look upon the case as pretty well complete . It is a beautiful case - a beautiful case - and what little is wanting to complete it , I expect to be able to supply in a few hours . "
354491	354501	354503	354504	Sir Leicester	268	" I am very glad indeed to hear it , "
354506	354512	354503	354504	Sir Leicester	268	" Highly creditable to you . "
354513	354520	354522	354523	Mr. Bucket	665	" Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , "
354527	354561	354522	354523	Mr. Bucket	665	" I hope it may at one and the same time do me credit and prove satisfactory to all . When I depict it as a beautiful case , you see , miss , "
354573	354626	354562	354563	Mr. Bucket	665	" I mean from my point of view . As considered from other points of view , such cases will always involve more or less unpleasantness . Very strange things comes to our knowledge in families , miss ; bless your heart , what you would think to be phenomenons , quite . "
354638	354657	354659	354660	Mr. Bucket	665	" Aye , and even in gen - teel families , in high families , in great families , "
354669	354708	354659	354660	Mr. Bucket	665	" I have had the honour of being employed in high families before , and you have no idea - come , I 'll go so far as to say not even YOU have any idea , sir , "
354715	354721	354722	354723	The cousin	7975	" what games goes on ! "
354743	354746	354722	354723	The cousin	7975	" Vayli , "
354753	354757	354758	354759	Sir Leicester	268	" very likely . "
354776	354783	354790	354790	his	268	" Very good . Thank you ! "
354820	354828	354829	354829	he	268	" You will not forget , officer , "
354834	354845	354829	354829	he	268	" that I am at your disposal when you please . "
354879	354887	354875	354876	Sir Leicester	268	" All times are alike to me . "
354905	354914	354915	354915	he	665	" Might I ask , by the by , "
354925	354936	354915	354915	he	665	" who posted the reward - bill on the staircase . "
354937	354947	354949	354950	Sir Leicester	268	" I ordered it to be put up there , "
354952	354974	354915	354915	he	665	" Would it be considered a liberty , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , if I was to ask you why ? "
354975	355051	355052	355053	Mr. Bucket	665	" Not at all . I chose it as a conspicuous part of the house . I think it can not be too prominently kept before the whole establishment . I wish my people to be impressed with the enormity of the crime , the determination to punish it , and the hopelessness of escape . At the same time , officer , if you in your better knowledge of the subject see any objection - "
355141	355153	355155	355156	Mr. Bucket	665	" Why , you 're six foot two , I suppose ? "
355158	355161	355163	355163	Mercury	280	" Three , "
355165	355209	355163	355163	Mercury	280	" Are you so much ? But then , you see , you 're broad in proportion and do n't look it . You 're not one of the weak - legged ones , you ai n't . Was you ever modelled now ? "
355234	355244	355246	355247	Mr. Bucket	665	" Then you ought to be , you know , "
355249	355291	355246	355247	Mr. Bucket	665	" and a friend of mine that you 'll hear of one day as a Royal Academy sculptor would stand something handsome to make a drawing of your proportions for the marble . My Lady 's out , ai n't she ? "
355292	355297	355163	355163	Mercury	280	" Out to dinner . "
355298	355310	355246	355247	Mr. Bucket	665	" Goes out pretty well every day , do n't she ? "
355311	355314	355246	355247	Mr. Bucket	665	" Yes . "
355315	355322	355324	355325	Mr. Bucket	665	" Not to be wondered at ! "
355327	355372	355324	355325	Mr. Bucket	665	" Such a fine woman as her , so handsome and so graceful and so elegant , is like a fresh lemon on a dinner - table , ornamental wherever she goes . Was your father in the same way of life as yourself ? "
355378	355382	355384	355385	Mr. Bucket	665	" Mine was , "
355387	355463	355464	355464	Mercury	280	" My father was first a page , then a footman , then a butler , then a steward , then an inn - keeper . Lived universally respected , and died lamented . Said with his last breath that he considered service the most honourable part of his career , and so it was . I 've a brother in service , AND a brother- in - law . My Lady a good temper ? "
355467	355475	355464	355464	Mercury	280	" As good as you can expect . "
355476	355479	355481	355482	Mr. Bucket	665	" Ah ! "
355484	355521	355481	355482	Mr. Bucket	665	" A little spoilt ? A little capricious ? Lord ! What can you anticipate when they 're so handsome as that ? And we like 'em all the better for it , do n't we ? "
355572	355578	355580	355581	Mr. Bucket	665	" Talk of the angels , "
355583	355588	355580	355581	Mr. Bucket	665	" Here she is ! "
355673	355680	355658	355658	she	7982	" Mr. Bucket , my Lady . "
355701	355710	355691	355691	his	665	" Are you waiting to see Sir Leicester ? "
355711	355722	355658	355658	she	7982	" No , my Lady , I 've seen him ! "
355723	355732	355777	355778	Mr. Bucket	665	" Have you anything to say to me ? "
355733	355742	355691	355691	his	665	" Not just at present , my Lady . "
355743	355751	355658	355658	she	7982	" Have you made any new discoveries ? "
355752	355759	355691	355691	his	665	" A few , my Lady . "
355834	355847	355849	355850	Mr. Bucket	665	" She 's a lovely woman , too , she really is , "
355857	355865	355849	355850	Mr. Bucket	665	" Do n't look quite healthy though . "
355921	355935	355937	355938	Mr. Bucket	665	" Are you sure you 're quite so much as six foot three ? "
355940	355950	355937	355938	Mr. Bucket	665	" Begging your pardon for interrupting you a moment ? "
355957	356001	355937	355938	Mr. Bucket	665	" You 're so well put together that I should n't have thought it . But the household troops , though considered fine men , are built so straggling . Walks by night , does she ? When it 's moonlight , though ? "
356026	356039	356041	356042	Mr. Bucket	665	" I suppose you ai n't in the habit of walking yourself ? "
356044	356055	356041	356042	Mr. Bucket	665	" Not much time for it , I should say ? "
356069	356074	356076	356077	Mr. Bucket	665	" To be sure , "
356079	356091	356093	356094	Mr. Bucket	665	" That makes a difference . Now I think of it , "
356118	356119	356123	356123	she	7991	" "
356136	356137	356126	356126	I	0	" "
356153	356154	356149	356149	you	665	" "
356161	356165	356155	356155	I	0	" says Mercury . "
356173	356178	356166	356166	I	0	" returns Mr. Bucket , "
356249	356250	356258	356258	You	665	" "
356256	356257	356258	356258	You	665	" "
356291	356292	356295	356295	she	934	" "
356298	356488	356295	356295	she	934	" Of course she was . Mr. Bucket must return to a little work he has to get on with upstairs , but he must shake hands with Mercury in acknowledgment of his agreeable conversation , and will he - this is all he asks - will he , when he has a leisure half - hour , think of bestowing it on that Royal Academy sculptor , for the advantage of both parties ? CHAPTER LIV Springing a Mine Refreshed by sleep , Mr. Bucket rises betimes in the morning and prepares for a field - day . Smartened up by the aid of a clean shirt and a wet hairbrush , with which instrument , on occasions of ceremony , he lubricates such thin locks as remain to him after his life of severe study , Mr. Bucket lays in a breakfast of two mutton chops as a foundation to work upon , together with tea , eggs , toast , and marmalade on a corresponding scale . Having much enjoyed these strengthening matters and having held subtle conference with his familiar demon , he confidently instructs Mercury "
356514	356695	356696	356696	I	0	" A gracious message being returned that Sir Leicester will expedite his dressing and join Mr. Bucket in the library within ten minutes , Mr. Bucket repairs to that apartment and stands before the fire with his finger on his chin , looking at the blazing coals . Thoughtful Mr. Bucket is , as a man may be with weighty work to do , but composed , sure , confident . From the expression of his face he might be a famous whist - player for a large stake - say a hundred guineas certain - with the game in his hand , but with a high reputation involved in his playing his hand out to the last card in a masterly way . Not in the least anxious or disturbed is Mr. Bucket when Sir Leicester appears , but he eyes the baronet aside as he comes slowly to his easy - chair with that observant gravity of yesterday in which there might have been yesterday , but for the audacity of the idea , a touch of compassion . "
356748	356775	356821	356821	I	0	" - Sir Leicester was going to say indisposition and would have said it to anybody else , but Mr. Bucket palpably knows all about it - "
356784	356820	356821	356821	I	0	" As he takes his seat with some difficulty and with an air of pain , Mr. Bucket draws a little nearer , standing with one of his large hands on the library - table . "
356828	356840	356842	356842	you	7999	" Sir Leicester observes ; raising his eyes to his face , "
356874	356875	356868	356869	Miss Dedlock	626	" "
356884	356906	356882	356882	Baronet	2138	" returns Mr. Bucket with his head persuasively on one side and his forefinger pendant at one ear like an earring , "
356981	356982	356972	356972	I	0	" "
356987	356988	356972	356972	I	0	" "
356999	357004	356972	356972	I	0	" Mr. Bucket resumes , "
357023	357024	357006	357006	I	0	" "
357029	357070	357006	357006	I	0	" Mr. Bucket skilfully and softly takes that precaution , stooping on his knee for a moment from mere force of habit so to adjust the key in the lock as that no one shall peep in from the outerside . "
357109	357110	357124	357125	the soldier	8008	" "
357115	357116	357112	357113	the soldier	8008	" "
357127	357135	357124	357125	the soldier	8008	" Sir Leicester looks astounded and inquires , "
357142	357152	357155	357156	a woman	713	" Mr. Bucket tells him , after a pause , "
357158	357171	357155	357156	a woman	713	" Sir Leicester leans back in his chair , and breathlessly ejaculates , "
357175	357176	357155	357156	a woman	713	" "
357185	357213	357155	357156	a woman	713	" Mr. Bucket begins , standing over him with one hand spread out on the library - table and the forefinger of the other in impressive use , "
357410	357433	357401	357401	you	268	" Sir Leicester , leaning back in his chair and grasping the elbows , sits looking at him with a stony face . "
357440	357445	357436	357438	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" proceeds Mr. Bucket , "
357595	357596	357597	357597	I	0	" "
357604	357621	357601	357601	your	268	" returns Sir Leicester after a silence , without moving hand , foot , or feature , "
357648	357662	357710	357711	Lady Dedlock	266	" - Sir Leicester seems to shrink in the shadow of his figure - "
357676	357691	357694	357696	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" None at all . Mr. Bucket brings a chair and diminishes his shadow . "
357713	357738	357710	357711	Lady Dedlock	266	" Sir Leicester raises himself in his seat and stares at him fiercely . Mr. Bucket brings the finger into play as an emollient . "
357761	357766	357756	357756	she	266	" says Mr. Bucket . "
357774	357780	357756	357756	she	266	" Sir Leicester returns stiffly , "
357792	357793	357796	357796	I	0	" "
357810	357811	357796	357796	I	0	" "
357814	357822	357823	357825	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" Mr. Bucket shakes his relentless head . "
357854	357855	357856	357856	Officer	7945	" "
357858	357871	357872	357872	you	7945	" retorts Sir Leicester with a fiery eye and a quivering lip , "
357933	357934	357935	357937	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" "
357952	357953	357941	357941	I	0	" "
357972	358014	357970	357970	sir	9569	" Glancing at the angry eyes which now avoid him and at the angry figure trembling from head to foot , yet striving to be still , Mr. Bucket feels his way with his forefinger and in a low voice proceeds . "
358042	358043	358029	358032	the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn	8037	" "
358068	358120	358061	358061	I	0	" exclaims Sir Leicester , striking his hand upon the table . But in the very heat and fury of the act he stops , fixed by the knowing eyes of Mr. Bucket , whose forefinger is slowly going and who , with mingled confidence and patience , shakes his head . "
358226	358234	358239	358240	her husband	1833	" Mr. Bucket stops and deliberately repeats , "
358544	358568	358569	358569	You	8050	" Sir Leicester sits like a statue , gazing at the cruel finger that is probing the life - blood of his heart . "
358663	358838	358841	358843	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" Sir Leicester , who has covered his face with his hands , uttering a single groan , requests him to pause for a moment . By and by he takes his hands away , and so preserves his dignity and outward calmness , though there is no more colour in his face than in his white hair , that Mr. Bucket is a little awed by him . Something frozen and fixed is upon his manner , over and above its usual shell of haughtiness , and Mr. Bucket soon detects an unusual slowness in his speech , with now and then a curious trouble in beginning , which occasions him to utter inarticulate sounds . With such sounds he now breaks silence , soon , however , controlling himself to say that he does not comprehend why a gentleman so faithful and zealous as the late Mr. Tulkinghorn should have communicated to him nothing of this painful , this distressing , this unlooked - for , this overwhelming , this incredible intelligence . "
358847	358852	358841	358843	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" returns Mr. Bucket , "
358996	359013	358993	358993	you	2138	" True . Sir Leicester , avoiding , with some trouble those obtrusive sounds , says , "
359016	359066	358993	358993	you	2138	" At this juncture a considerable noise of voices is heard in the hall . Mr. Bucket , after listening , goes to the library - door , softly unlocks and opens it , and listens again . Then he draws in his head and whispers hurriedly but composedly , "
359150	359156	359157	359157	Officer	7945	" Sir Leicester indistinctly answers , "
359169	359286	359161	359161	you	2138	" and Mr. Bucket , with a nod and a sagacious crook of the forefinger , slips down into the hall , where the voices quickly die away . He is not long in returning ; a few paces ahead of Mercury and a brother deity also powdered and in peach - blossomed smalls , who bear between them a chair in which is an incapable old man . Another man and two women come behind . Directing the pitching of the chair in an affable and easy manner , Mr. Bucket dismisses the Mercuries and locks the door again . Sir Leicester looks on at this invasion of the sacred precincts with an icy stare . "
359299	359308	359290	359290	you	2138	" says Mr. Bucket in a confidential voice . "
359323	359338	359340	359340	my	0	" producing the tip of his convenient little staff from his breast - pocket , "
359399	359400	359394	359394	I	0	" "
359412	359422	359423	359423	You	0	" cries Mr. Smallweed in a shrill loud voice . "
359438	359453	359436	359436	you	0	" retorts Mr. Bucket with a steadfast look , but without loss of temper . "
359456	359457	359436	359436	you	0	" "
359464	359469	359460	359460	they	8087	" says Mr. Bucket , "

359516	359521	359510	359510	you	0	" snarls Mr. Smallweed , "

359576	359581	359559	359559	I	0	" says Mr. Bucket . "

359600	359614	359598	359598	Chadband	486	" Mr. Smallweed puts in , speaking henceforth in a much lower key . "
359627	359636	359617	359618	a friend	10985	" says Mr. Bucket , offering his hand , "
359651	359652	359645	359646	Mrs. Chadband	486	" "
359657	359662	359663	359663	Husband	668	" Mr. Smallweed introduces . "
359675	359680	359663	359663	Husband	668	" says Mr. Bucket . "

359705	359720	359696	359696	you	0	" Mr. Smallweed asks , a little dashed by the suddenness of this turn . "
359748	359792	359795	359795	You	0	" Mr. Smallweed , beckoning Mr. Chadband , takes a moment 's counsel with him in a whisper . Mr. Chadband , expressing a considerable amount of oil from the pores of his forehead and the palms of his hands , says aloud , "
359798	359806	359807	359807	I	0	" and retires to his former place . "
359817	359823	359824	359824	I	0	" pipes Grandfather Smallweed then ; "
360054	360077	360048	360048	I	0	" Here Mr. Smallweed , seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his triumph , breaks off to ejaculate , "
360094	360095	360087	360087	I	0	" "
360103	360112	360099	360099	you	8110	" says Mr. Bucket after awaiting his recovery , "
360133	360134	360126	360127	the gentleman	1117	" "
360145	360150	360142	360143	Mr. Bucket	665	" cries Grandfather Smallweed . "
360236	360237	360218	360218	I	0	" "
360253	360258	360240	360240	he	271	" says Mr. Bucket . "
360354	360355	360346	360346	I	0	" "
360362	360386	360357	360357	I	0	" says Mr. Bucket , instantaneously altering his manner , coming close to him , and communicating an extraordinary fascination to the forefinger , "
360469	360510	360444	360444	you	0	" Such is the dread power of the man , and so terribly evident it is that he makes no idle boast , that Mr. Smallweed begins to apologize . Mr. Bucket , dismissing his sudden anger , checks him . "
360614	360645	360648	360648	you	0	" Mr. Smallweed looks , with greedy eyes , at the little bundle Mr. Bucket produces from a mysterious part of his coat , and identifies it as the same . "
360654	360659	360648	360648	you	0	" asks Mr. Bucket . "
360681	360682	360677	360677	you	0	" "
360689	360690	360693	360693	you	0	" "
360701	360719	360697	360697	you	0	" says Mr. Bucket humorously . It appears , however , that Mr. Smallweed means five hundred . "
360745	360757	360759	360759	you	0	" says Mr. Bucket - Sir Leicester mechanically bows his head - "
360799	360811	360793	360793	you	0	" Mr. Smallweed is quite clear that he had better not . "
360814	360819	360793	360793	you	0	" says Mr. Bucket , "
360859	360892	360847	360847	he	8127	" Thus invited , Mr. Chadband steps forth , and after a little sleek smiling and a little oil - grinding with the palms of his hands , delivers himself as follows , "
361031	361032	361033	361033	You	0	" "
361043	361051	361040	361040	you	0	" returns Mr. Bucket , very attentive , "
361078	361079	361072	361072	You	0	" "
361093	361102	361072	361072	You	0	" says Mr. Chadband with a cunning eye , "
361114	361143	361107	361107	Rachael	282	" Mrs. Chadband , more than ready , so advances as to jostle her husband into the background and confronts Mr. Bucket with a hard , frowning smile . "
361153	361157	361158	361158	I	0	" says she , "
361236	361253	361254	361254	ladyship	8149	" With these words , and a laugh , and laying a bitter stress on the word "
361256	361269	361254	361254	ladyship	8149	" Mrs. Chadband folds her arms and looks implacably at Mr. Bucket . "
361274	361279	361270	361270	I	0	" returns that officer , "
361297	361308	361282	361282	he	8150	" Mrs. Chadband merely laughs and contemptuously tells him he can "
361310	361314	361315	361316	My friend	10042	" twenty pence . "
361328	361341	361315	361316	My friend	10042	" says Mr. Bucket , luring Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger . "
361350	361573	361282	361282	he	8150	" Mrs. Snagsby is at first prevented , by tears and lamentations , from stating the nature of her game , but by degrees it confusedly comes to light that she is a woman overwhelmed with injuries and wrongs , whom Mr. Snagsby has habitually deceived , abandoned , and sought to keep in darkness , and whose chief comfort , under her afflictions , has been the sympathy of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn , who showed so much commiseration for her on one occasion of his calling in Cook 's Court in the absence of her perjured husband that she has of late habitually carried to him all her woes . Everybody it appears , the present company excepted , has plotted against Mrs. Snagsby 's peace . There is Mr. Guppy , clerk to Kenge and Carboy , who was at first as open as the sun at noon , but who suddenly shut up as close as midnight , under the influence - no doubt - of Mr. Snagsby 's suborning and tampering . There is Mr. Weevle , friend of Mr. Guppy , who lived mysteriously up a court , owing to the like coherent causes . There was Krook , deceased ; there was Nimrod , deceased ; and there was Jo , deceased ; and they were "
361578	361601	361282	361282	he	8150	" In what , Mrs. Snagsby does not with particularity express , but she knows that Jo was Mr. Snagsby 's son , "
361612	361958	361282	361282	he	8150	" and she followed Mr. Snagsby when he went on his last visit to the boy , and if he was not his son why did he go ? The one occupation of her life has been , for some time back , to follow Mr. Snagsby to and fro , and up and down , and to piece suspicious circumstances together - and every circumstance that has happened has been most suspicious ; and in this way she has pursued her object of detecting and confounding her false husband , night and day . Thus did it come to pass that she brought the Chadbands and Mr. Tulkinghorn together , and conferred with Mr. Tulkinghorn on the change in Mr. Guppy , and helped to turn up the circumstances in which the present company are interested , casually , by the wayside , being still and ever on the great high road that is to terminate in Mr. Snagsby 's full exposure and a matrimonial separation . All this , Mrs. Snagsby , as an injured woman , and the friend of Mrs. Chadband , and the follower of Mr. Chadband , and the mourner of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn , is here to certify under the seal of confidence , with every possible confusion and involvement possible and impossible , having no pecuniary motive whatever , no scheme or project but the one mentioned , and bringing here , and taking everywhere , her own dense atmosphere of dust , arising from the ceaseless working of her mill of jealousy . While this exordium is in hand - and it takes some time - Mr. Bucket , who has seen through the transparency of Mrs. Snagsby 's vinegar at a glance , confers with his familiar demon and bestows his shrewd attention on the Chadbands and Mr. Smallweed . Sir Leicester Dedlock remains immovable , with the same icy surface upon him , except that he once or twice looks towards Mr. Bucket , as relying on that officer alone of all mankind . "
361962	361967	361282	361282	he	8150	" says Mr. Bucket . "
361993	362005	361969	361969	I	0	" again Sir Leicester mechanically bows in confirmation of the statement , "
362092	362093	362088	362088	I	0	" "
362100	362105	362094	362094	We	8155	" pleads Mr. Smallweed . "
362116	362123	362110	362110	you	8154	" Mr. Bucket asserts with cheerfulness ; "
362230	362241	362242	362242	I	0	" says Mr. Bucket in an argumentative and friendly way . "
362261	362266	362250	362253	one of the servants	8161	" returns Mr. Smallweed . "
362308	362309	362299	362299	I	0	" "
362319	362325	362299	362299	I	0	" Mrs. Chadband sternly demands . "
362342	362349	362350	362350	I	0	" replies Mr. Bucket with gallantry . "
362378	362379	362372	362372	his	490	" "
362383	362388	362372	362372	his	490	" exclaims Mr. Smallweed . "
362396	362408	362372	362372	his	490	" Mr. Bucket has his hand on the bell - rope . "
362430	362481	362410	362410	I	0	" he asks in an insinuating tone . Nobody having the hardihood to object to his doing so , he does it , and the party retire as they came up . Mr. Bucket follows them to the door , and returning , says with an air of serious business , "
362668	362698	362699	362703	The party to be apprehended	8170	" Sir Leicester seems to wake , though his eyes have been wide open , and he looks intently at Mr. Bucket as Mr. Bucket refers to his watch . "
362710	362728	362730	362730	I	0	" proceeds Mr. Bucket , putting up his watch with a steady hand and with rising spirits , "
362841	362933	362828	362828	You	8173	" Mr. Bucket rings , goes to the door , briefly whispers Mercury , shuts the door , and stands behind it with his arms folded . After a suspense of a minute or two the door slowly opens and a Frenchwoman enters . Mademoiselle Hortense . The moment she is in the room Mr. Bucket claps the door to and puts his back against it . The suddenness of the noise occasions her to turn , and then for the first time she sees Sir Leicester Dedlock in his chair . "
362939	362944	362934	362934	I	0	" she mutters hurriedly . "
362954	362982	362945	362945	They	8176	" Her step towards the door brings her front to front with Mr. Bucket . Suddenly a spasm shoots across her face and she turns deadly pale . "
362992	363001	362988	362990	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" says Mr. Bucket , nodding at her . "
363015	363016	363002	363005	This foreign young woman	8180	" "
363031	363039	363025	363025	you	268	" returns mademoiselle in a jocular strain . "
363045	363050	363042	363043	my angel	8182	" returns Mr. Bucket , "
363055	363077	363042	363043	my angel	8182	" Mademoiselle Hortense eyes him with a scowl upon her tight face , which gradually changes into a smile of scorn , "
363087	363088	363084	363084	you	268	" "
363095	363100	363084	363084	you	268	" returns Mr. Bucket . "
363157	363188	363191	363192	my God	13535	" mademoiselle demands , with her arms composedly crossed , but with something in her dark cheek beating like a clock . Mr. Bucket merely shakes the finger at her . "
363200	363213	363191	363192	my God	13535	" cries mademoiselle with a toss of her head and a laugh . "
363223	363234	363191	363192	my God	13535	" With a stamp of her foot and a menace . "
363239	363249	363250	363250	you	406	" says Mr. Bucket in a cool determined way , "
363259	363260	363250	363250	you	406	" "
363269	363278	363261	363261	I	0	" she replies with a shower of nods . "
363283	363296	363297	363297	you	406	" repeats Mr. Bucket , making no demonstration except with the finger , "
363304	363305	363297	363297	you	406	" "
363308	363309	363297	363297	you	406	" "
363407	363427	363378	363378	I	0	" Mademoiselle complies , saying in a concentrated voice while that something in her cheek beats fast and hard , "
363433	363434	363430	363431	a devil	8204	" "
363440	363446	363447	363447	you	406	" Mr. Bucket proceeds approvingly , "
363525	363580	363583	363583	you	0	" Mr. Bucket is very complacent over this French explanation . Mademoiselle , with that tigerish expansion of the mouth and her black eyes darting fire upon him , sits upright on the sofa in a rigid state , with her hands clenched - and her feet too , one might suppose - muttering , "
363591	363592	363583	363583	you	0	" "
363601	363616	363599	363599	Baronet	268	" says Mr. Bucket , and from this time forth the finger never rests , "
363656	363657	363639	363641	this young woman	13378	" "
363660	363664	363665	363665	I	0	" cries mademoiselle . "
363669	363670	363667	363667	myself	0	" "
363681	363696	363676	363676	you	0	" returns Mr. Bucket in an impressive , almost in an imploring , tone . "
363748	363749	363761	363761	her	13378	" "
363754	363759	363761	363761	her	13378	" cries mademoiselle furiously , "
363793	363794	363788	363789	a ladyship	8215	" "
363803	363808	363788	363789	a ladyship	8215	" Mr. Bucket remonstrates . "
363839	363840	363841	363841	He	268	" "
363847	363851	363852	363852	I	0	" cries mademoiselle . "
363866	363876	363852	363852	I	0	" all of which she makes the carpet represent . "
363898	363899	363902	363904	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" "
363906	363911	363923	363923	she	8220	" proceeds Mr. Bucket , "
363958	363959	363948	363948	she	8220	" "
363962	363966	363967	363967	I	0	" cries mademoiselle . "
363976	363977	363967	363967	I	0	" "
363986	363992	363993	363993	you	268	" says Mr. Bucket parenthetically , "
364075	364076	364043	364043	she	8220	" "
364079	364083	364043	364043	she	8220	" cries mademoiselle . "
364087	364088	364043	364043	she	8220	" "
364276	364330	364331	364331	I	0	" As Mr. Bucket bends forward in some excitement - for him - and inaugurates what he is going to say with one ghostly beat of his forefinger in the air , Mademoiselle Hortense fixes her black eyes upon him with a dark frown and sets her dry lips closely and firmly together . "
364447	364462	364442	364442	she	13378	" Mademoiselle is hardly audible in straining through her teeth and lips the words , "
364468	364469	364465	364466	a devil	8204	" "
364473	364478	364480	364480	she	13378	" pursues Mr. Bucket , "
364643	364666	364633	364633	I	0	" Mr. Bucket , breaking off , has made a noiseless descent upon mademoiselle and laid his heavy hand upon her shoulder . "
364675	364680	364633	364633	I	0	" she asks him . "
364688	364696	364633	364633	I	0	" returns Mr. Bucket with admonitory finger , "
364762	364782	364759	364759	my	0	" Vainly endeavouring to moisten those dry lips , with a painful sound she struggles with herself and complies . "
365020	365021	365012	365012	she	13378	" "
365024	365028	365012	365012	she	13378	" mademoiselle interposes . "
365035	365036	365012	365012	she	13378	" "
365102	365114	365116	365116	she	13378	" Sir Leicester rises from his chair and staggers down again . "
365305	365384	365303	365303	Baronet	2138	" Mr. Bucket asks , triumphant in his admiration of his lady 's genius . Two things are especially observable as Mr. Bucket proceeds to a conclusion . First , that he seems imperceptibly to establish a dreadful right of property in mademoiselle . Secondly , that the very atmosphere she breathes seems to narrow and contract about her as if a close net or a pall were being drawn nearer and yet nearer around her breathless figure . "
365401	365406	365390	365391	her ladyship	913	" says Mr. Bucket , "
365558	365559	365538	365539	Mrs. Bucket	649	" "
365566	365570	365571	365571	You	0	" mademoiselle interposes . "
365591	365592	365587	365587	you	0	" "
365599	365624	365587	365587	you	0	" proceeds Mr. Bucket , who delights in a full title and does violence to himself when he dispenses with any fragment of it , "
366021	366034	366015	366015	I	0	" In a trice Mr. Bucket snaps a handcuff on her wrist . "
366039	366044	366015	366015	I	0	" says Mr. Bucket . "
366057	366065	366015	366015	I	0	" He rises ; she rises too . "
366068	366090	366015	366015	I	0	" she asks him , darkening her large eyes until their drooping lids almost conceal them - and yet they stare , "
366103	366104	366105	366105	She	8306	" "
366114	366119	366105	366105	She	8306	" returns Mr. Bucket . "
366129	366130	366123	366123	her	8306	" "
366138	366148	366131	366131	I	0	" exclaims Mademoiselle Hortense , panting tigress - like . "
366157	366162	366163	366163	I	0	" says Mr. Bucket . "
366166	366173	366163	366163	I	0	" making her eyes very large . "
366184	366185	366174	366174	I	0	" "
366191	366200	366189	366189	darling	8304	" says Mr. Bucket with the greatest composure , "
366236	366237	366234	366234	you	9610	" "
366247	366248	366243	366244	a devil	8204	" "
366257	366262	366243	366244	a devil	8204	" cries Mr. Bucket . "
366309	366339	366343	366344	my angel	8182	" Mademoiselle Hortense , casting an indignant eye at the glass , shakes herself perfectly neat in one shake and looks , to do her justice , uncommonly genteel . "
366346	366354	366343	366344	my angel	8182	" says she after several sarcastic nods . "
366369	366374	366362	366362	you	9610	" Mr. Bucket answers , "
366378	366379	366362	366362	you	9610	" "
366403	366404	366395	366395	you	9610	" "
366411	366416	366395	366395	you	9610	" says Mr. Bucket . "
366424	366436	366418	366422	a haughty gentleman of HIM	8318	" cries mademoiselle , referring to Sir Leicester with ineffable disdain . "
366455	366456	366418	366422	a haughty gentleman of HIM	8318	" "
366470	366475	366418	366422	a haughty gentleman of HIM	8318	" says Mr. Bucket . "
366479	366480	366481	366481	You	9610	" "
366534	367306	366530	366530	I	0	" With these last words she snaps her teeth together as if her mouth closed with a spring . It is impossible to describe how Mr. Bucket gets her out , but he accomplishes that feat in a manner so peculiar to himself , enfolding and pervading her like a cloud , and hovering away with her as if he were a homely Jupiter and she the object of his affections . Sir Leicester , left alone , remains in the same attitude , as though he were still listening and his attention were still occupied . At length he gazes round the empty room , and finding it deserted , rises unsteadily to his feet , pushes back his chair , and walks a few steps , supporting himself by the table . Then he stops , and with more of those inarticulate sounds , lifts up his eyes and seems to stare at something . Heaven knows what he sees . The green , green woods of Chesney Wold , the noble house , the pictures of his forefathers , strangers defacing them , officers of police coarsely handling his most precious heirlooms , thousands of fingers pointing at him , thousands of faces sneering at him . But if such shadows flit before him to his bewilderment , there is one other shadow which he can name with something like distinctness even yet and to which alone he addresses his tearing of his white hair and his extended arms . It is she in association with whom , saving that she has been for years a main fibre of the root of his dignity and pride , he has never had a selfish thought . It is she whom he has loved , admired , honoured , and set up for the world to respect . It is she who , at the core of all the constrained formalities and conventionalities of his life , has been a stock of living tenderness and love , susceptible as nothing else is of being struck with the agony he feels . He sees her , almost to the exclusion of himself , and can not bear to look upon her cast down from the high place she has graced so well . And even to the point of his sinking on the ground , oblivious of his suffering , he can yet pronounce her name with something like distinctness in the midst of those intrusive sounds , and in a tone of mourning and compassion rather than reproach . CHAPTER LV Flight Inspector Bucket of the Detective has not yet struck his great blow , as just now chronicled , but is yet refreshing himself with sleep preparatory to his field - day , when through the night and along the freezing wintry roads a chaise and pair comes out of Lincolnshire , making its way towards London . Railroads shall soon traverse all this country , and with a rattle and a glare the engine and train shall shoot like a meteor over the wide night - landscape , turning the moon paler ; but as yet such things are non - existent in these parts , though not wholly unexpected . Preparations are afoot , measurements are made , ground is staked out . Bridges are begun , and their not yet united piers desolately look at one another over roads and streams like brick and mortar couples with an obstacle to their union ; fragments of embankments are thrown up and left as precipices with torrents of rusty carts and barrows tumbling over them ; tripods of tall poles appear on hilltops , where there are rumours of tunnels ; everything looks chaotic and abandoned in full hopelessness . Along the freezing roads , and through the night , the post - chaise makes its way without a railroad on its mind . Mrs. Rouncewell , so many years housekeeper at Chesney Wold , sits within the chaise ; and by her side sits Mrs. Bagnet with her grey cloak and umbrella . The old girl would prefer the bar in front , as being exposed to the weather and a primitive sort of perch more in accordance with her usual course of travelling , but Mrs. Rouncewell is too thoughtful of her comfort to admit of her proposing it . The old lady can not make enough of the old girl . She sits , in her stately manner , holding her hand , and regardless of its roughness , puts it often to her lips . "
367316	367322	367324	367324	you	8323	" says she many times , "
367332	367333	367324	367324	you	8323	" "
367338	367343	367336	367336	George	515	" returns Mrs. Bagnet , "
367450	367451	367433	367433	him	515	" "
367457	367466	367433	367433	him	515	" returns Mrs. Rouncewell , bursting into tears . "
367573	367752	367754	367754	I	0	" The old lady 's hands stray about her as of yore , while she recalls , all in a tremble , what a likely lad , what a fine lad , what a gay good - humoured clever lad he was ; how they all took to him down at Chesney Wold ; how Sir Leicester took to him when he was a young gentleman ; how the dogs took to him ; how even the people who had been angry with him forgave him the moment he was gone , poor boy . And now to see him after all , and in a prison too ! And the broad stomacher heaves , and the quaint upright old - fashioned figure bends under its load of affectionate distress . Mrs. Bagnet , with the instinctive skill of a good warm heart , leaves the old housekeeper to her emotions for a little while - not without passing the back of her hand across her own motherly eyes - and presently chirps up in her cheery manner , "
368127	368177	368179	368179	you	515	" All this Mrs. Bagnet now relates for the twentieth time at least within the last four hours . Trilling it out like a kind of bird , with a pretty high note , that it may be audible to the old lady above the hum of the wheels . "
368185	368190	368179	368179	you	515	" says Mrs. Rouncewell . "
368202	368203	368196	368196	you	515	" "
368207	368217	368196	368196	you	515	" cries Mrs. Bagnet in the most natural manner . "
368318	368347	368348	368348	He	515	" exclaims the old girl , apparently persuaded that the latter form a separate establishment and have dissolved partnership with truth and justice for ever and a day . "
368352	368357	368316	368316	lawyers	9861	" says Mrs. Rouncewell , "
368438	368502	368503	368503	My	0	" The extreme disquietude of the old housekeeper 's manner in saying this , her broken words , and her wringing of her hands make a powerful impression on Mrs. Bagnet and would astonish her but that she refers them all to her sorrow for her son 's condition . And yet Mrs. Bagnet wonders too why Mrs. Rouncewell should murmur so distractedly , "
368512	368967	368503	368503	My	0	" over and over again . The frosty night wears away , and the dawn breaks , and the post- chaise comes rolling on through the early mist like the ghost of a chaise departed . It has plenty of spectral company in ghosts of trees and hedges , slowly vanishing and giving place to the realities of day . London reached , the travellers alight , the old housekeeper in great tribulation and confusion , Mrs. Bagnet quite fresh and collected - as she would be if her next point , with no new equipage and outfit , were the Cape of Good Hope , the Island of Ascension , Hong Kong , or any other military station . But when they set out for the prison where the trooper is confined , the old lady has managed to draw about her , with her lavender- coloured dress , much of the staid calmness which is its usual accompaniment . A wonderfully grave , precise , and handsome piece of old china she looks , though her heart beats fast and her stomacher is ruffled more than even the remembrance of this wayward son has ruffled it these many years . Approaching the cell , they find the door opening and a warder in the act of coming out . The old girl promptly makes a sign of entreaty to him to say nothing ; assenting with a nod , he suffers them to enter as he shuts the door . So George , who is writing at his table , supposing himself to be alone , does not raise his eyes , but remains absorbed . The old housekeeper looks at him , and those wandering hands of hers are quite enough for Mrs. Bagnet 's confirmation , even if she could see the mother and the son together , knowing what she knows , and doubt their relationship . Not a rustle of the housekeeper 's dress , not a gesture , not a word betrays her . She stands looking at him as he writes on , all unconscious , and only her fluttering hands give utterance to her emotions . But they are very eloquent , very , very eloquent . Mrs. Bagnet understands them . They speak of gratitude , of joy , of grief , of hope ; of inextinguishable affection , cherished with no return since this stalwart man was a stripling ; of a better son loved less , and this son loved so fondly and so proudly ; and they speak in such touching language that Mrs. Bagnet 's eyes brim up with tears and they run glistening down her sun - brown face . "
368983	369052	369053	369053	My	0	" The trooper starts up , clasps his mother round the neck , and falls down on his knees before her . Whether in a late repentance , whether in the first association that comes back upon him , he puts his hands together as a child does when it says its prayers , and raising them towards her breast , bows down his head , and cries . "
369110	369174	369175	369175	Mother	350	" She can ask , and he can answer , nothing connected for a time . All that time the old girl , turned away , leans one arm against the whitened wall , leans her honest forehead upon it , wipes her eyes with her serviceable grey cloak , and quite enjoys herself like the best of old girls as she is . "
369177	369187	369175	369175	Mother	350	" says the trooper when they are more composed , "
369202	369305	369306	369306	Mother	11737	" Forgive him ! She does it with all her heart and soul . She always has done it . She tells him how she has had it written in her will , these many years , that he was her beloved son George . She has never believed any ill of him , never . If she had died without this happiness - and she is an old woman now and ca n't look to live very long - she would have blessed him with her last breath , if she had had her senses , as her beloved son George . "
369396	369443	369451	369451	mother	11737	" The trooper has dried his eyes and put away his handkerchief , but there is an extraordinary contrast between his habitual manner of expressing himself and carrying himself and the softened tone in which he speaks , interrupted occasionally by a half - stifled sob . "
369567	369568	369569	369569	I	0	" "
369601	369626	369627	369627	Heaven	658	" This almost overturns the trooper afresh , but he sets himself up with a great , rough , sounding clearance of his throat . "
369812	369836	369839	369839	I	0	" The old lady sorrowfully shakes her head , and taking one of his powerful hands , lays it lovingly upon her shoulder . "
370087	370117	370118	370118	I	0	" Mrs. Rouncewell , drawing up her stately form , shakes her head at the old girl with a swelling pride upon her , as much as to say , "
370123	370191	370120	370120	you	336	" The old girl relieves her feelings and testifies her interest in the conversation by giving the trooper a great poke between the shoulders with her umbrella ; this action she afterwards repeats , at intervals , in a species of affectionate lunacy , never failing , after the administration of each of these remonstrances , to resort to the whitened wall and the grey cloak again . "
370292	370430	370431	370431	Mother	11737	" To which Mrs. Bagnet responds with two pokes . And now the old lady impresses upon her son George , her own dear recovered boy , her joy and pride , the light of her eyes , the happy close of her life , and every fond name she can think of , that he must be governed by the best advice obtainable by money and influence , that he must yield up his case to the greatest lawyers that can be got , that he must act in this serious plight as he shall be advised to act and must not be self - willed , however right , but must promise to think only of his poor old mother 's anxiety and suffering until he is released , or he will break her heart . "
370441	370452	370431	370431	Mother	11737	" returns the trooper , stopping her with a kiss ; "
370485	370497	370474	370474	you	553	" A very hard poke from the old girl 's umbrella . "
370532	370533	370522	370522	they	8412	" "
370538	370544	370536	370536	George	336	" says the old lady , "
370594	370595	370596	370596	Mother	350	" "
370598	370603	370596	370596	Mother	350	" returns the trooper , "
370613	370614	370596	370596	Mother	350	" "
370621	370622	370596	370596	Mother	350	" "

370647	370648	370634	370635	my brother	11816	" "
370767	370768	370773	370774	dear George	336	" "
370776	370777	370773	370774	dear George	336	" "
370829	370840	370825	370825	I	0	" says the trooper , shaking his head very doubtfully , "
370864	370908	370825	370825	I	0	" As he evidently has a rooted feeling on this point , and as the depth of it is recognized in Mrs. Bagnet 's face , his mother yields her implicit assent to what he asks . For this he thanks her kindly . "
370955	370965	370949	370949	I	0	" he glances at his writing on the table , "
371079	371129	371132	371132	you	8432	" Matters being brought to this so far satisfactory pass , and time being on the wane , Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure . Again and again the old lady hangs upon her son 's neck , and again and again the trooper holds her to his broad chest . "
371142	371143	371132	371132	you	8432	" "
371171	371176	371159	371159	I	0	" Mrs. Rouncewell answers . "
371205	371216	371218	371218	her	2196	" Why indeed , Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella . "
371271	371440	371258	371258	I	0	" So saying , the trooper puts his lips to the old girl 's tanned forehead , and the door shuts upon him in his cell . No entreaties on the part of the good old housekeeper will induce Mrs. Bagnet to retain the coach for her own conveyance home . Jumping out cheerfully at the door of the Dedlock mansion and handing Mrs. Rouncewell up the steps , the old girl shakes hands and trudges off , arriving soon afterwards in the bosom of the Bagnet family and falling to washing the greens as if nothing had happened . My Lady is in that room in which she held her last conference with the murdered man , and is sitting where she sat that night , and is looking at the spot where he stood upon the hearth studying her so leisurely , when a tap comes at the door . Who is it ? Mrs. Rouncewell . What has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly ? "
371462	371506	371455	371455	I	0	" What new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble so ? Far happier than her Lady , as her Lady has often thought , why does she falter in this manner and look at her with such strange mistrust ? "
371519	371520	371455	371455	I	0	" "
371554	371555	371549	371549	he	11511	" "

371618	371646	371615	371616	Mr. Tulkinghorn	271	" What does she mean by this look and this imploring gesture ? Why does she come so close ? What is the letter that she holds ? "
371706	371707	371708	371708	I	0	" "
371714	371715	371708	371708	I	0	" "
371757	371800	371801	371802	My Lady	934	" What delusion can this be ? What power does she suppose is in the person she petitions to avert this unjust suspicion , if it be unjust ? Her Lady 's handsome eyes regard her with astonishment , almost with fear . "
371887	371888	371882	371882	I	0	" "
371894	371895	371882	371882	I	0	" "
371900	371912	371913	371914	My Lady	934	" The housekeeper looks round and answers in a frightened whisper , "
372163	372172	372156	372157	My Lady	934	" the old housekeeper pleads with genuine simplicity , "
372241	372259	372277	372277	you	266	" Lady Dedlock raises her without one word , until she takes the letter from her hand . "
372266	372267	372261	372261	I	0	" "
372290	372291	372292	372292	I	0	" "

372338	372503	372323	372323	you	266	" The old housekeeper leaves her with the letter in her hand . In truth she is not a hard lady naturally , and the time has been when the sight of the venerable figure suing to her with such strong earnestness would have moved her to great compassion . But so long accustomed to suppress emotion and keep down reality , so long schooled for her own purposes in that destructive school which shuts up the natural feelings of the heart like flies in amber and spreads one uniform and dreary gloss over the good and bad , the feeling and the unfeeling , the sensible and the senseless , she had subdued even her wonder until now . She opens the letter . Spread out upon the paper is a printed account of the discovery of the body as it lay face downward on the floor , shot through the heart ; and underneath is written her own name , with the word "
372505	372573	372575	372575	him	8484	" attached . It falls out of her hand . How long it may have lain upon the ground she knows not , but it lies where it fell when a servant stands before her announcing the young man of the name of Guppy . The words have probably been repeated several times , for they are ringing in her head before she begins to understand them . "
372579	372629	372575	372575	him	8484	" He comes in . Holding the letter in her hand , which she has taken from the floor , she tries to collect her thoughts . In the eyes of Mr. Guppy she is the same Lady Dedlock , holding the same prepared , proud , chilling state . "
372652	372685	372630	372631	Your ladyship	2428	" - which he do n't complain of , for he is bound to confess that there never has been any particular reason on the face of things why he should be - "
372705	372710	372697	372697	you	2428	" says Mr. Guppy . "
372714	372715	372717	372718	your ladyship	2428	" "
372729	372750	372726	372727	your ladyship	2428	" Mr. Guppy sits on the edge of a chair and puts his hat on the carpet at his feet , "
372862	372876	372896	372897	your ladyship	2428	" And yet he is here now , Lady Dedlock moodily reminds him . "
372884	372889	372879	372879	I	0	" Mr. Guppy admits . "
372910	372927	372930	372930	I	0	" He can not do so , she tells him , too plainly or too briefly . "
372932	372944	372930	372930	I	0	" Mr. Guppy returns with a sense of injury upon him , "
373021	373038	373039	373039	Your	2428	" Mr. Guppy considers this a favourable moment for sticking up his hair with both hands . "
373154	373178	373148	373151	a man of business	3155	" Lady Dedlock looks at him in stern inquiry . Mr. Guppy immediately withdraws his eyes from her face and looks anywhere else . "
373188	373193	373223	373223	your	8504	" he goes on , "
373422	373423	373431	373431	your	8504	" "
373426	373427	373431	373431	your	8504	" "

373625	373635	373636	373636	Your	8504	" Mr. Guppy picks up his hat and rises . "
373766	373792	373739	373739	I	0	" She scarcely acknowledges these parting words by any look , but when he has been gone a little while , she rings her bell . "
373798	373813	373795	373796	Sir Leicester	268	" Mercury reports that he is at present shut up in the library alone . "
373823	374181	373818	373819	any visitors	8533	" Several , on business . Mercury proceeds to a description of them , which has been anticipated by Mr. Guppy . Enough ; he may go . So ! All is broken down . Her name is in these many mouths , her husband knows his wrongs , her shame will be published - may be spreading while she thinks about it - and in addition to the thunderbolt so long foreseen by her , so unforeseen by him , she is denounced by an invisible accuser as the murderess of her enemy . Her enemy he was , and she has often , often , often wished him dead . Her enemy he is , even in his grave . This dreadful accusation comes upon her like a new torment at his lifeless hand . And when she recalls how she was secretly at his door that night , and how she may be represented to have sent her favourite girl away so soon before merely to release herself from observation , she shudders as if the hangman 's hands were at her neck . She has thrown herself upon the floor and lies with her hair all wildly scattered and her face buried in the cushions of a couch . She rises up , hurries to and fro , flings herself down again , and rocks and moans . The horror that is upon her is unutterable . If she really were the murderess , it could hardly be , for the moment , more intense . For as her murderous perspective , before the doing of the deed , however subtle the precautions for its commission , would have been closed up by a gigantic dilatation of the hateful figure , preventing her from seeing any consequences beyond it ; and as those consequences would have rushed in , in an unimagined flood , the moment the figure was laid low - which always happens when a murder is done ; so , now she sees that when he used to be on the watch before her , and she used to think , "
374200	375430	375431	375432	Chesney Wold	340	" it was but wishing that all he held against her in his hand might be flung to the winds and chance - sown in many places . So , too , with the wicked relief she has felt in his death . What was his death but the key- stone of a gloomy arch removed , and now the arch begins to fall in a thousand fragments , each crushing and mangling piecemeal ! Thus , a terrible impression steals upon and overshadows her that from this pursuer , living or dead - obdurate and imperturbable before her in his well - remembered shape , or not more obdurate and imperturbable in his coffin - bed - there is no escape but in death . Hunted , she flies . The complication of her shame , her dread , remorse , and misery , overwhelms her at its height ; and even her strength of self - reliance is overturned and whirled away like a leaf before a mighty wind . She hurriedly addresses these lines to her husband , seals , and leaves them on her table : If I am sought for , or accused of , his murder , believe that I am wholly innocent . Believe no other good of me , for I am innocent of nothing else that you have heard , or will hear , laid to my charge . He prepared me , on that fatal night , for his disclosure of my guilt to you . After he had left me , I went out on pretence of walking in the garden where I sometimes walk , but really to follow him and make one last petition that he would not protract the dreadful suspense on which I have been racked by him , you do not know how long , but would mercifully strike next morning . I found his house dark and silent . I rang twice at his door , but there was no reply , and I came home . I have no home left . I will encumber you no more . May you , in your just resentment , be able to forget the unworthy woman on whom you have wasted a most generous devotion - who avoids you only with a deeper shame than that with which she hurries from herself - and who writes this last adieu . She veils and dresses quickly , leaves all her jewels and her money , listens , goes downstairs at a moment when the hall is empty , opens and shuts the great door , flutters away in the shrill frosty wind . CHAPTER LVI Pursuit Impassive , as behoves its high breeding , the Dedlock town house stares at the other houses in the street of dismal grandeur and gives no outward sign of anything going wrong within . Carriages rattle , doors are battered at , the world exchanges calls ; ancient charmers with skeleton throats and peachy cheeks that have a rather ghastly bloom upon them seen by daylight , when indeed these fascinating creatures look like Death and the Lady fused together , dazzle the eyes of men . Forth from the frigid mews come easily swinging carriages guided by short - legged coachmen in flaxen wigs , deep sunk into downy hammercloths , and up behind mount luscious Mercuries bearing sticks of state and wearing cocked hats broadwise , a spectacle for the angels . The Dedlock town house changes not externally , and hours pass before its exalted dullness is disturbed within . But Volumnia the fair , being subject to the prevalent complaint of boredom and finding that disorder attacking her spirits with some virulence , ventures at length to repair to the library for change of scene . Her gentle tapping at the door producing no response , she opens it and peeps in ; seeing no one there , takes possession . The sprightly Dedlock is reputed , in that grass - grown city of the ancients , Bath , to be stimulated by an urgent curiosity which impels her on all convenient and inconvenient occasions to sidle about with a golden glass at her eye , peering into objects of every description . Certain it is that she avails herself of the present opportunity of hovering over her kinsman 's letters and papers like a bird , taking a short peck at this document and a blink with her head on one side at that document , and hopping about from table to table with her glass at her eye in an inquisitive and restless manner . In the course of these researches she stumbles over something , and turning her glass in that direction , sees her kinsman lying on the ground like a felled tree . Volumnia 's pet little scream acquires a considerable augmentation of reality from this surprise , and the house is quickly in commotion . Servants tear up and down stairs , bells are violently rung , doctors are sent for , and Lady Dedlock is sought in all directions , but not found . Nobody has seen or heard her since she last rang her bell . Her letter to Sir Leicester is discovered on her table , but it is doubtful yet whether he has not received another missive from another world requiring to be personally answered , and all the living languages , and all the dead , are as one to him . They lay him down upon his bed , and chafe , and rub , and fan , and put ice to his head , and try every means of restoration . Howbeit , the day has ebbed away , and it is night in his room before his stertorous breathing lulls or his fixed eyes show any consciousness of the candle that is occasionally passed before them . But when this change begins , it goes on ; and by and by he nods or moves his eyes or even his hand in token that he hears and comprehends . He fell down , this morning , a handsome stately gentleman , somewhat infirm , but of a fine presence , and with a well - filled face . He lies upon his bed , an aged man with sunken cheeks , the decrepit shadow of himself . His voice was rich and mellow and he had so long been thoroughly persuaded of the weight and import to mankind of any word he said that his words really had come to sound as if there were something in them . But now he can only whisper , and what he whispers sounds like what it is - mere jumble and jargon . His favourite and faithful housekeeper stands at his bedside . It is the first act he notices , and he clearly derives pleasure from it . After vainly trying to make himself understood in speech , he makes signs for a pencil . So inexpressively that they can not at first understand him ; it is his old housekeeper who makes out what he wants and brings in a slate . After pausing for some time , he slowly scrawls upon it in a hand that is not his , "
375434	375475	375431	375432	Chesney Wold	340	" No , she tells him ; he is in London . He was taken ill in the library this morning . Right thankful she is that she happened to come to London and is able to attend upon him . "
375507	375544	375501	375503	All the gentlemen	8535	" This , with the tears coursing down her fair old face . After making a survey of the room and looking with particular attention all round the bed where the doctors stand , he writes , "
375548	375549	375501	375503	All the gentlemen	8535	" "
375573	375623	375624	375625	My Lady	934	" He points again , in great agitation , at the two words . They all try to quiet him , but he points again with increased agitation . On their looking at one another , not knowing what to say , he takes the slate once more and writes "
375634	375951	375624	375625	My Lady	934	" And makes an imploring moan . It is thought better that his old housekeeper should give him Lady Dedlock 's letter , the contents of which no one knows or can surmise . She opens it for him and puts it out for his perusal . Having read it twice by a great effort , he turns it down so that it shall not be seen and lies moaning . He passes into a kind of relapse or into a swoon , and it is an hour before he opens his eyes , reclining on his faithful and attached old servant 's arm . The doctors know that he is best with her , and when not actively engaged about him , stand aloof . The slate comes into requisition again , but the word he wants to write he can not remember . His anxiety , his eagerness , and affliction at this pass are pitiable to behold . It seems as if he must go mad in the necessity he feels for haste and the inability under which he labours of expressing to do what or to fetch whom . He has written the letter B , and there stopped . Of a sudden , in the height of his misery , he puts Mr. before it . The old housekeeper suggests Bucket . Thank heaven ! That 's his meaning . Mr. Bucket is found to be downstairs , by appointment . Shall he come up ? There is no possibility of misconstruing Sir Leicester 's burning wish to see him or the desire he signifies to have the room cleared of every one but the housekeeper . It is speedily done , and Mr. Bucket appears . Of all men upon earth , Sir Leicester seems fallen from his high estate to place his sole trust and reliance upon this man . "
375987	376041	375974	375974	I	0	" Sir Leicester puts her letter in his hands and looks intently in his face while he reads it . A new intelligence comes into Mr. Bucket 's eye as he reads on ; with one hook of his finger , while that eye is still glancing over the words , he indicates , "
376052	376060	376050	376050	you	268	" Sir Leicester writes upon the slate . "
376066	376073	376074	376076	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" Mr. Bucket stops his hand . "
376104	376126	376131	376133	Sir Leicester Dedlock	268	" With the quickness of thought , he follows Sir Leicester Dedlock 's look towards a little box upon a table . "
376225	376273	376221	376221	I	0	" The velocity and certainty of Mr. Bucket 's interpretation on all these heads is little short of miraculous . Mrs. Rouncewell , who holds the light , is giddy with the swiftness of his eyes and hands as he starts up , furnished for his journey . "
376293	376309	376290	376290	I	0	" says Mr. Bucket aside , with his hat already on and buttoning his coat . "
376320	376321	376316	376318	his distressed mother	8548	" "
376643	376767	376622	376622	Lord	8561	" With this peroration , Mr. Bucket , buttoned up , goes quietly out , looking steadily before him as if he were already piercing the night in quest of the fugitive . His first step is to take himself to Lady Dedlock 's rooms and look all over them for any trifling indication that may help him . The rooms are in darkness now ; and to see Mr. Bucket with a wax - light in his hand , holding it above his head and taking a sharp mental inventory of the many delicate objects so curiously at variance with himself , would be to see a sight - which nobody DOES see , as he is particular to lock himself in . "
376774	376796	376622	376622	Lord	8561	" says Mr. Bucket , who feels in a manner furbished up in his French by the blow of the morning . "
376823	376853	376814	376814	she	8562	" Opening and shutting table - drawers and looking into caskets and jewel - cases , he sees the reflection of himself in various mirrors , and moralizes thereon . "
376874	376879	376880	376880	I	0	" says Mr. Bucket . "
376896	376942	376943	376943	Hum	296	" Ever looking about , he has opened a dainty little chest in an inner drawer . His great hand , turning over some gloves which it can scarcely feel , they are so light and soft within it , comes upon a white handkerchief . "
376953	376963	376951	376951	YOU	0	" says Mr. Bucket , putting down the light . "
377004	377012	377013	377014	Esther Summerson	283	" He finds it as he speaks , "
377016	377017	377013	377014	Esther Summerson	283	" "
377020	377034	377013	377014	Esther Summerson	283	" says Mr. Bucket , pausing , with his finger at his ear . "
377042	377302	377037	377037	I	0	" He completes his observations as quietly and carefully as he has carried them on , leaves everything else precisely as he found it , glides away after some five minutes in all , and passes into the street . With a glance upward at the dimly lighted windows of Sir Leicester 's room , he sets off , full - swing , to the nearest coach- stand , picks out the horse for his money , and directs to be driven to the shooting gallery . Mr. Bucket does not claim to be a scientific judge of horses , but he lays out a little money on the principal events in that line , and generally sums up his knowledge of the subject in the remark that when he sees a horse as can go , he knows him . His knowledge is not at fault in the present instance . Clattering over the stones at a dangerous pace , yet thoughtfully bringing his keen eyes to bear on every slinking creature whom he passes in the midnight streets , and even on the lights in upper windows where people are going or gone to bed , and on all the turnings that he rattles by , and alike on the heavy sky , and on the earth where the snow lies thin - for something may present itself to assist him , anywhere - he dashes to his destination at such a speed that when he stops the horse half smothers him in a cloud of steam . "
377319	377335	377336	377336	I	0	" He runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his pipe . "
377396	377414	377415	377415	You	336	" The trooper has just come from there and gives him the address , near Oxford Street . "
377426	377508	377415	377415	You	336	" He is off again , with an impression of having seen Phil sitting by the frosty fire staring at him open - mouthed , and gallops away again , and gets out in a cloud of steam again . Mr. Jarndyce , the only person up in the house , is just going to bed , rises from his book on hearing the rapid ringing at the bell , and comes down to the door in his dressing - gown . "
377516	377544	377415	377415	You	336	" In a moment his visitor is confidential with him in the hall , has shut the door , and stands with his hand upon the lock . "
377606	377607	377603	377604	Lady Dedlock	266	" "
377610	377611	377603	377604	Lady Dedlock	266	" "
377682	377696	377697	377697	I	0	" Mr. Jarndyce , having read it , asks him what he thinks . "
377792	377801	377802	377803	Miss Summerson	283	" Mr. Jarndyce in a troubled voice repeats , "
377805	377806	377802	377803	Miss Summerson	283	" "
377811	377826	377827	377827	I	0	" - Mr. Bucket has read his face with the greatest attention all along - "
378121	379428	378095	378096	one o'clock	12427	" This is all true , and the pressing nature of the case can not be questioned . Mr. Jarndyce begs him to remain there while he speaks to Miss Summerson . Mr. Bucket says he will , but acting on his usual principle , does no such thing , following upstairs instead and keeping his man in sight . So he remains , dodging and lurking about in the gloom of the staircase while they confer . In a very little time Mr. Jarndyce comes down and tells him that Miss Summerson will join him directly and place herself under his protection to accompany him where he pleases . Mr. Bucket , satisfied , expresses high approval and awaits her coming at the door . There he mounts a high tower in his mind and looks out far and wide . Many solitary figures he perceives creeping through the streets ; many solitary figures out on heaths , and roads , and lying under haystacks . But the figure that he seeks is not among them . Other solitaries he perceives , in nooks of bridges , looking over ; and in shadowed places down by the river 's level ; and a dark , dark , shapeless object drifting with the tide , more solitary than all , clings with a drowning hold on his attention . Where is she ? Living or dead , where is she ? If , as he folds the handkerchief and carefully puts it up , it were able with an enchanted power to bring before him the place where she found it and the night - landscape near the cottage where it covered the little child , would he descry her there ? On the waste where the brick - kilns are burning with a pale blue flare , where the straw- roofs of the wretched huts in which the bricks are made are being scattered by the wind , where the clay and water are hard frozen and the mill in which the gaunt blind horse goes round all day looks like an instrument of human torture - traversing this deserted , blighted spot there is a lonely figure with the sad world to itself , pelted by the snow and driven by the wind , and cast out , it would seem , from all companionship . It is the figure of a woman , too ; but it is miserably dressed , and no such clothes ever came through the hall and out at the great door of the Dedlock mansion . CHAPTER LVII Esther 's Narrative I had gone to bed and fallen asleep when my guardian knocked at the door of my room and begged me to get up directly . On my hurrying to speak to him and learn what had happened , he told me , after a word or two of preparation , that there had been a discovery at Sir Leicester Dedlock 's . That my mother had fled , that a person was now at our door who was empowered to convey to her the fullest assurances of affectionate protection and forgiveness if he could possibly find her , and that I was sought for to accompany him in the hope that my entreaties might prevail upon her if his failed . Something to this general purpose I made out , but I was thrown into such a tumult of alarm , and hurry and distress , that in spite of every effort I could make to subdue my agitation , I did not seem , to myself , fully to recover my right mind until hours had passed . But I dressed and wrapped up expeditiously without waking Charley or any one and went down to Mr. Bucket , who was the person entrusted with the secret . In taking me to him my guardian told me this , and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me . Mr. Bucket , in a low voice , by the light of my guardian 's candle , read to me in the hall a letter that my mother had left upon her table ; and I suppose within ten minutes of my having been aroused I was sitting beside him , rolling swiftly through the streets . His manner was very keen , and yet considerate when he explained to me that a great deal might depend on my being able to answer , without confusion , a few questions that he wished to ask me . These were , chiefly , whether I had had much communication with my mother to whom he only referred as Lady Dedlock , when and where I had spoken with her last , and how she had become possessed of my handkerchief . When I had satisfied him on these points , he asked me particularly to consider - taking time to think - whether within my knowledge there was any one , no matter where , in whom she might be at all likely to confide under circumstances of the last necessity . I could think of no one but my guardian . But by and by I mentioned Mr. Boythorn . He came into my mind as connected with his old chivalrous manner of mentioning my mother 's name and with what my guardian had informed me of his engagement to her sister and his unconscious connexion with her unhappy story . My companion had stopped the driver while we held this conversation , that we might the better hear each other . He now told him to go on again and said to me , after considering within himself for a few moments , that he had made up his mind how to proceed . He was quite willing to tell me what his plan was , but I did not feel clear enough to understand it . We had not driven very far from our lodgings when we stopped in a by - street at a public - looking place lighted up with gas . Mr. Bucket took me in and sat me in an arm - chair by a bright fire . It was now past one , as I saw by the clock against the wall . Two police officers , looking in their perfectly neat uniform not at all like people who were up all night , were quietly writing at a desk ; and the place seemed very quiet altogether , except for some beating and calling out at distant doors underground , to which nobody paid any attention . A third man in uniform , whom Mr. Bucket called and to whom he whispered his instructions , went out ; and then the two others advised together while one wrote from Mr. Bucket 's subdued dictation . It was a description of my mother that they were busy with , for Mr. Bucket brought it to me when it was done and read it in a whisper . It was very accurate indeed . The second officer , who had attended to it closely , then copied it out and called in another man in uniform there were several in an outer room , who took it up and went away with it . All this was done with the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment ; yet nobody was at all hurried . As soon as the paper was sent out upon its travels , the two officers resumed their former quiet work of writing with neatness and care . Mr. Bucket thoughtfully came and warmed the soles of his boots , first one and then the other , at the fire . "
379438	379448	379435	379436	Miss Summerson	283	" he asked me as his eyes met mine . "
379464	379478	379435	379436	Miss Summerson	283	" I told him I cared for no weather and was warmly clothed . "
379486	379490	379435	379436	Miss Summerson	283	" he observed ; "
379503	379504	379501	379501	miss	9656	" "
379514	379521	379501	379501	miss	9656	" said I. He nodded comfortingly . "
379579	379635	379577	379577	Baronet	268	" He was really very kind and gentle , and as he stood before the fire warming his boots and rubbing his face with his forefinger , I felt a confidence in his sagacity which reassured me . It was not yet a quarter to two when I heard horses ' feet and wheels outside . "
379641	379645	379638	379639	Miss Summerson	283	" said he , "
379654	379902	379651	379651	you	283	" He gave me his arm , and the two officers courteously bowed me out , and we found at the door a phaeton or barouche with a postilion and post horses . Mr. Bucket handed me in and took his own seat on the box . The man in uniform whom he had sent to fetch this equipage then handed him up a dark lantern at his request , and when he had given a few directions to the driver , we rattled away . I was far from sure that I was not in a dream . We rattled with great rapidity through such a labyrinth of streets that I soon lost all idea where we were , except that we had crossed and re - crossed the river , and still seemed to be traversing a low - lying , waterside , dense neighbourhood of narrow thoroughfares chequered by docks and basins , high piles of warehouses , swing - bridges , and masts of ships . At length we stopped at the corner of a little slimy turning , which the wind from the river , rushing up it , did not purify ; and I saw my companion , by the light of his lantern , in conference with several men who looked like a mixture of police and sailors . Against the mouldering wall by which they stood , there was a bill , on which I could discern the words , "
379905	380231	380238	380239	Miss Summerson	283	" ; and this and an inscription about drags possessed me with the awful suspicion shadowed forth in our visit to that place . I had no need to remind myself that I was not there by the indulgence of any feeling of mine to increase the difficulties of the search , or to lessen its hopes , or enhance its delays . I remained quiet , but what I suffered in that dreadful spot I never can forget . And still it was like the horror of a dream . A man yet dark and muddy , in long swollen sodden boots and a hat like them , was called out of a boat and whispered with Mr. Bucket , who went away with him down some slippery steps - as if to look at something secret that he had to show . They came back , wiping their hands upon their coats , after turning over something wet ; but thank God it was not what I feared ! After some further conference , Mr. Bucket whom everybody seemed to know and defer to went in with the others at a door and left me in the carriage , while the driver walked up and down by his horses to warm himself . The tide was coming in , as I judged from the sound it made , and I could hear it break at the end of the alley with a little rush towards me . It never did so - and I thought it did so , hundreds of times , in what can have been at the most a quarter of an hour , and probably was less - but the thought shuddered through me that it would cast my mother at the horses ' feet . Mr. Bucket came out again , exhorting the others to be vigilant , darkened his lantern , and once more took his seat . "
380249	380257	380238	380239	Miss Summerson	283	" he said , turning to me . "
380286	380642	380643	380647	An old acquaintance of yours	8593	" We appeared to retrace the way we had come . Not that I had taken note of any particular objects in my perturbed state of mind , but judging from the general character of the streets . We called at another office or station for a minute and crossed the river again . During the whole of this time , and during the whole search , my companion , wrapped up on the box , never relaxed in his vigilance a single moment ; but when we crossed the bridge he seemed , if possible , to be more on the alert than before . He stood up to look over the parapet , he alighted and went back after a shadowy female figure that flitted past us , and he gazed into the profound black pit of water with a face that made my heart die within me . The river had a fearful look , so overcast and secret , creeping away so fast between the low flat lines of shore - so heavy with indistinct and awful shapes , both of substance and shadow ; so death - like and mysterious . I have seen it many times since then , by sunlight and by moonlight , but never free from the impressions of that journey . In my memory the lights upon the bridge are always burning dim , the cutting wind is eddying round the homeless woman whom we pass , the monotonous wheels are whirling on , and the light of the carriage- lamps reflected back looks palely in upon me - a face rising out of the dreaded water . Clattering and clattering through the empty streets , we came at length from the pavement on to dark smooth roads and began to leave the houses behind us . After a while I recognized the familiar way to Saint Albans . At Barnet fresh horses were ready for us , and we changed and went on . It was very cold indeed , and the open country was white with snow , though none was falling then . "
380655	380661	380652	380653	Miss Summerson	283	" said Mr. Bucket cheerfully . "
380664	380668	380652	380653	Miss Summerson	283	" I returned . "
380675	380676	380652	380653	Miss Summerson	283	" "
380687	380691	380652	380653	Miss Summerson	283	" he answered , "
380700	380796	380849	380850	Miss Summerson	283	" He had gone into every late or early public - house where there was a light they were not a few at that time , the road being then much frequented by drovers and had got down to talk to the turnpike- keepers . I had heard him ordering drink , and chinking money , and making himself agreeable and merry everywhere ; but whenever he took his seat upon the box again , his face resumed its watchful steady look , and he always said to the driver in the same business tone , "
380803	380845	380849	380850	Miss Summerson	283	" With all these stoppages , it was between five and six o'clock and we were yet a few miles short of Saint Albans when he came out of one of these houses and handed me in a cup of tea . "
380871	380881	380882	380882	You	283	" I thanked him and said I hoped so . "
380892	380896	380898	380898	Lord	8596	" he returned ; "
380921	380948	380916	380916	She	8598	" I do n't know what joyful exclamation I made or was going to make , but he put up his finger and I stopped myself . "
381072	381140	381065	381066	my lad	8569	" We were soon in Saint Albans and alighted a little before day , when I was just beginning to arrange and comprehend the occurrences of the night and really to believe that they were not a dream . Leaving the carriage at the posting - house and ordering fresh horses to be ready , my companion gave me his arm , and we went towards home . "
381154	381158	381148	381149	Miss Summerson	283	" he observed , "
381195	381256	381269	381269	you	9610	" As we ascended the hill , he looked about him with a sharp eye - the day was now breaking - and reminded me that I had come down it one night , as I had reason for remembering , with my little servant and poor Jo , whom he called Toughey . I wondered how he knew that . "
381272	381287	381260	381264	a man upon the road	8606	" said Mr. Bucket . Yes , I remembered that too , very well . "
381292	381305	381306	381306	I	0	" said Mr. Bucket . Seeing my surprise , he went on , "
381396	381397	381390	381390	you	9610	" "
381404	381408	381390	381390	you	9610	" I asked . "
381415	381426	381390	381390	you	9610	" said Mr. Bucket , coolly lifting off his hat , "
381553	381554	381555	381556	Poor creature	8615	" "
381558	381561	381555	381556	Poor creature	8615	" said I. "
381565	381570	381555	381556	Poor creature	8615	" assented Mr. Bucket , "
381608	381614	381603	381603	I	0	" I asked him why . "
381620	381625	381603	381603	I	0	" said Mr. Bucket . "
381657	381744	381636	381636	He	10948	" Although I remember this conversation now , my head was in confusion at the time , and my power of attention hardly did more than enable me to understand that he entered into these particulars to divert me . With the same kind intention , manifestly , he often spoke to me of indifferent things , while his face was busy with the one object that we had in view . He still pursued this subject as we turned in at the garden - gate . "
381747	381752	381636	381636	He	10948	" said Mr. Bucket . "
381879	381908	381857	381857	you	8627	" We were now in front of the house ; he looked attentively and closely at the gravel for footprints before he raised his eyes to the windows . "
381932	381944	381929	381930	Miss Summerson	283	" he inquired , glancing at Mr. Skimpole 's usual chamber . "
381950	381953	381947	381948	Mr. Skimpole	326	" said I. "
381961	381971	381956	381956	you	9610	" returned Mr. Bucket , bending down his ear . "
382000	382001	382002	382002	Harold	326	" "
382004	382009	382010	382010	Harold	326	" I told him . "
382022	382033	382020	382020	Harold	326	" said Mr. Bucket , eyeing me with great expression . "
382040	382043	382036	382038	a singular character	8637	" said I. "
382049	382054	382036	382038	a singular character	8637	" observed Mr. Bucket . "
382061	382075	382055	382055	He	326	" I involuntarily returned for answer that I perceived Mr. Bucket knew him . "
382087	382091	382079	382079	I	0	" he replied . "
382478	382505	382465	382465	he	326	" I regarded this as very treacherous on the part of Mr. Skimpole towards my guardian and as passing the usual bounds of his childish innocence . "
382511	382516	382465	382465	he	326	" returned Mr. Bucket . "
382732	382818	382821	382822	Miss Summerson	283	" I believe it had not been for a moment out of his mind , any more than it had been out of my mind , or out of his face . The whole household were amazed to see me , without any notice , at that time in the morning , and so accompanied ; and their surprise was not diminished by my inquiries . No one , however , had been there . It could not be doubted that this was the truth . "
382824	382829	382821	382822	Miss Summerson	283	" said my companion , "
382883	383184	383185	383185	Liz	405	" We set off again immediately . On arriving at the cottage , we found it shut up and apparently deserted , but one of the neighbours who knew me and who came out when I was trying to make some one hear informed me that the two women and their husbands now lived together in another house , made of loose rough bricks , which stood on the margin of the piece of ground where the kilns were and where the long rows of bricks were drying . We lost no time in repairing to this place , which was within a few hundred yards ; and as the door stood ajar , I pushed it open . There were only three of them sitting at breakfast , the child lying asleep on a bed in the corner . It was Jenny , the mother of the dead child , who was absent . The other woman rose on seeing me ; and the men , though they were , as usual , sulky and silent , each gave me a morose nod of recognition . A look passed between them when Mr. Bucket followed me in , and I was surprised to see that the woman evidently knew him . I had asked leave to enter of course . Liz the only name by which I knew her rose to give me her own chair , but I sat down on a stool near the fire , and Mr. Bucket took a corner of the bedstead . Now that I had to speak and was among people with whom I was not familiar , I became conscious of being hurried and giddy . It was very difficult to begin , and I could not help bursting into tears . "
383187	383191	383185	383185	Liz	405	" said I , "
383211	383212	383208	383209	a lady	2382	" "
383221	383237	383240	383241	the lady	1169	" Mr. Bucket struck in , addressing the whole group with a composed propitiatory face ; "
383258	383259	383247	383253	The lady that was here last night	8671	" "
383270	383295	383296	383318	A person of the name of Michael Jackson , with a blue welveteen waistcoat with a double row of mother of pearl buttons	8673	" inquired Jenny 's husband , who had made a surly stop in his eating to listen and now measured him with his eye . "
383320	383326	383327	383327	He	8673	" Mr. Bucket immediately answered . "
383340	383345	383332	383332	his	8673	" growled the man . "
383355	383364	383346	383346	He	8673	" said Mr. Bucket apologetically for Michael Jackson , "
383370	383470	383471	383471	I	0	" The woman had not resumed her chair , but stood faltering with her hand upon its broken back , looking at me . I thought she would have spoken to me privately if she had dared . She was still in this attitude of uncertainty when her husband , who was eating with a lump of bread and fat in one hand and his clasp - knife in the other , struck the handle of his knife violently on the table and told her with an oath to mind HER own business at any rate and sit down . "
383481	383485	383477	383477	Jenny	366	" said I , "
383529	383584	383585	383585	I	0	" The woman had a great desire to answer , but the man , with another oath , openly kicked at her foot with his heavy boot . He left it to Jenny 's husband to say what he chose , and after a dogged silence the latter turned his shaggy head towards me . "
383714	383715	383707	383707	She	366	" "
383722	383726	383717	383717	she	366	" I asked . "
383740	383751	383735	383735	She	366	" he answered with a sulky jerk of his head . "
383791	383795	383781	383781	you	8675	" said I , "
383805	383806	383781	383781	you	8675	" "
383823	383829	383830	383831	Your master	5254	" the woman timidly began . "
383833	383845	383830	383831	Your master	5254	" said her husband , muttering an imprecation with slow emphasis , "
383860	383885	383906	383907	the lady	1169	" After another silence , the husband of the absent woman , turning to me again , answered me with his usual grumbling unwillingness . "
384151	384157	384148	384148	He	2256	" The other man repeated , "
384164	384165	384148	384148	He	2256	" "
384171	384175	384167	384168	the lady	1169	" I inquired . "
384180	384186	384176	384176	Devil	517	" returned the first man . "
384209	384262	384201	384201	she	1169	" The woman sat with her arms crossed and her eyes upon the ground . Her husband had turned his seat a little so as to face her and kept his hammer - like hand upon the table as if it were in readiness to execute his threat if she disobeyed him . "
384275	384279	384302	384302	she	1169	" said I , "
384285	384286	384281	384282	the lady	1169	" "
384291	384298	384281	384282	the lady	1169	" he gruffly cried to her . "
384312	384313	384302	384302	she	1169	" "
384316	384321	384302	384302	she	1169	" replied the woman . "
384329	384330	384332	384332	she	1169	" "
384336	384337	384332	384332	she	1169	" "
384347	384361	384342	384342	her	1169	" She answered , looking all the while at her husband for leave . "
384366	384369	384363	384363	she	1169	" said I. "
384377	384378	384363	384363	she	1169	" "
384382	384392	384394	384394	her	1169	" said the husband in answer to her look . "
384400	384401	384394	384394	her	1169	" "
384425	384426	384420	384420	she	1169	" "
384434	384448	384429	384429	she	1169	" I was proceeding , when Jenny 's husband impatiently took me up . "
384494	384547	384550	384551	Miss Summerson	283	" I glanced at my companion , and finding that he had already risen and was ready to depart , thanked them for what they had told me , and took my leave . The woman looked full at Mr. Bucket as he went out , and he looked full at her . "
384553	384564	384550	384551	Miss Summerson	283	" he said to me as we walked quickly away . "
384581	384582	384583	384583	You	8713	" "
384587	384591	384583	384583	You	8713	" I exclaimed . "
384599	384603	384583	384583	You	8713	" he returned . "
384701	384729	384695	384695	she	913	" He repeated this question to himself several times as we hurried on , appearing to balance between a variety of answers that arose in his mind . "
384736	384741	384687	384687	she	913	" said Mr. Bucket , "
384846	384870	384842	384844	the other woman	3983	" I regretted it exceedingly , for she was very grateful , and I felt sure would have resisted no entreaty of mine . "
384878	384887	384875	384876	Miss Summerson	283	" said Mr. Bucket , pondering on it , "
384996	385351	384982	384983	Miss Summerson	283	" We called at home once more that I might send a hasty note to my guardian , and then we hurried back to where we had left the carriage . The horses were brought out as soon as we were seen coming , and we were on the road again in a few minutes . It had set in snowing at daybreak , and it now snowed hard . The air was so thick with the darkness of the day and the density of the fall that we could see but a very little way in any direction . Although it was extremely cold , the snow was but partially frozen , and it churned - with a sound as if it were a beach of small shells - under the hoofs of the horses into mire and water . They sometimes slipped and floundered for a mile together , and we were obliged to come to a standstill to rest them . One horse fell three times in this first stage , and trembled so and was so shaken that the driver had to dismount from his saddle and lead him at last . I could eat nothing and could not sleep , and I grew so nervous under those delays and the slow pace at which we travelled that I had an unreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk . Yielding to my companion 's better sense , however , I remained where I was . All this time , kept fresh by a certain enjoyment of the work in which he was engaged , he was up and down at every house we came to , addressing people whom he had never beheld before as old acquaintances , running in to warm himself at every fire he saw , talking and drinking and shaking hands at every bar and tap , friendly with every waggoner , wheelwright , blacksmith , and toll- taker , yet never seeming to lose time , and always mounting to the box again with his watchful , steady face and his business - like "
385358	385418	384982	384983	Miss Summerson	283	" When we were changing horses the next time , he came from the stable - yard , with the wet snow encrusted upon him and dropping off him - plashing and crashing through it to his wet knees as he had been doing frequently since we left Saint Albans - and spoke to me at the carriage side . "
385457	385458	385475	385475	you	8569	" "
385463	385466	385475	385475	you	8569	" said I. "
385504	385505	385506	385506	I	0	" "
385511	385514	385506	385506	I	0	" said I. "
385530	385531	385518	385528	some one else nearer here , of whom I never heard	8734	" "
385571	385799	385803	385804	my lad	8569	" The sleet fell all that day unceasingly , a thick mist came on early , and it never rose or lightened for a moment . Such roads I had never seen . I sometimes feared we had missed the way and got into the ploughed grounds or the marshes . If I ever thought of the time I had been out , it presented itself as an indefinite period of great duration , and I seemed , in a strange way , never to have been free from the anxiety under which I then laboured . As we advanced , I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost confidence . He was the same as before with all the roadside people , but he looked graver when he sat by himself on the box . I saw his finger uneasily going across and across his mouth during the whole of one long weary stage . I overheard that he began to ask the drivers of coaches and other vehicles coming towards us what passengers they had seen in other coaches and vehicles that were in advance . Their replies did not encourage him . He always gave me a reassuring beck of his finger and lift of his eyelid as he got upon the box again , but he seemed perplexed now when he said , "
385806	386818	385803	385804	my lad	8569	" At last , when we were changing , he told me that he had lost the track of the dress so long that he began to be surprised . It was nothing , he said , to lose such a track for one while , and to take it up for another while , and so on ; but it had disappeared here in an unaccountable manner , and we had not come upon it since . This corroborated the apprehensions I had formed , when he began to look at direction - posts , and to leave the carriage at cross roads for a quarter of an hour at a time while he explored them . But I was not to be down - hearted , he told me , for it was as likely as not that the next stage might set us right again . The next stage , however , ended as that one ended ; we had no new clue . There was a spacious inn here , solitary , but a comfortable substantial building , and as we drove in under a large gateway before I knew it , where a landlady and her pretty daughters came to the carriage - door , entreating me to alight and refresh myself while the horses were making ready , I thought it would be uncharitable to refuse . They took me upstairs to a warm room and left me there . It was at the corner of the house , I remember , looking two ways . On one side to a stable - yard open to a by - road , where the ostlers were unharnessing the splashed and tired horses from the muddy carriage , and beyond that to the by - road itself , across which the sign was heavily swinging ; on the other side to a wood of dark pine - trees . Their branches were encumbered with snow , and it silently dropped off in wet heaps while I stood at the window . Night was setting in , and its bleakness was enhanced by the contrast of the pictured fire glowing and gleaming in the window- pane . As I looked among the stems of the trees and followed the discoloured marks in the snow where the thaw was sinking into it and undermining it , I thought of the motherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now welcomed me and of MY mother lying down in such a wood to die . I was frightened when I found them all about me , but I remembered that before I fainted I tried very hard not to do it ; and that was some little comfort . They cushioned me up on a large sofa by the fire , and then the comely landlady told me that I must travel no further to - night , but must go to bed . But this put me into such a tremble lest they should detain me there that she soon recalled her words and compromised for a rest of half an hour . A good endearing creature she was . She and her three fair girls , all so busy about me . I was to take hot soup and broiled fowl , while Mr. Bucket dried himself and dined elsewhere ; but I could not do it when a snug round table was presently spread by the fireside , though I was very unwilling to disappoint them . However , I could take some toast and some hot negus , and as I really enjoyed that refreshment , it made some recompense . Punctual to the time , at the half - hour 's end the carriage came rumbling under the gateway , and they took me down , warmed , refreshed , comforted by kindness , and safe I assured them not to faint any more . After I had got in and had taken a grateful leave of them all , the youngest daughter - a blooming girl of nineteen , who was to be the first married , they had told me - got upon the carriage step , reached in , and kissed me . I have never seen her , from that hour , but I think of her to this hour as my friend . The transparent windows with the fire and light , looking so bright and warm from the cold darkness out of doors , were soon gone , and again we were crushing and churning the loose snow . We went on with toil enough , but the dismal roads were not much worse than they had been , and the stage was only nine miles . My companion smoking on the box - I had thought at the last inn of begging him to do so when I saw him standing at a great fire in a comfortable cloud of tobacco - was as vigilant as ever and as quickly down and up again when we came to any human abode or any human creature . He had lighted his little dark lantern , which seemed to be a favourite with him , for we had lamps to the carriage ; and every now and then he turned it upon me to see that I was doing well . There was a folding - window to the carriage - head , but I never closed it , for it seemed like shutting out hope . We came to the end of the stage , and still the lost trace was not recovered . I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change , but I knew by his yet graver face as he stood watching the ostlers that he had heard nothing . Almost in an instant afterwards , as I leaned back in my seat , he looked in , with his lighted lantern in his hand , an excited and quite different man . "
386823	386829	385803	385804	my lad	8569	" said I , starting . "
386834	386835	386831	386831	she	8739	" "
386858	386896	386853	386853	I	0	" The crystallized snow was in his eyelashes , in his hair , lying in ridges on his dress . He had to shake it from his face and get his breath before he spoke to me . "
386902	386913	386899	386900	Miss Summerson	283	" said he , beating his finger on the apron , "
386966	386993	386996	386996	I	0	" There was a commotion in the yard , and a man came running out of the stables to know if he meant up or down . "
387009	387010	386996	386996	I	0	" "
387013	387019	386996	386996	I	0	" said I , astonished . "
387028	387029	387030	387031	Miss Summerson	283	" "
387033	387037	387030	387031	Miss Summerson	283	" he answered , "
387064	387065	387055	387055	I	0	" "
387069	387073	387055	387055	I	0	" I repeated . "

387111	387112	387109	387109	you	283	" "
387149	387162	387163	387163	You	283	" said I , in an agony , and grasping his hand . "
387227	387286	387287	387287	My	0	" These orders and the way in which he ran about the yard urging them caused a general excitement that was scarcely less bewildering to me than the sudden change . But in the height of the confusion , a mounted man galloped away to order the relays , and our horses were put to with great speed . "
387290	387304	387287	387287	My	0	" said Mr. Bucket , jumping to his seat and looking in again , "
387351	387413	387349	387349	you	9610	" I endeavoured to say that I knew he was far more capable than I of deciding what we ought to do , but was he sure that this was right ? Could I not go forward by myself in search of - I grasped his hand again in my distress and whispered it to him - of my own mother . "
387417	387421	387349	387349	you	9610	" he answered , "
387451	387459	387443	387443	you	9610	" What could I say but yes ! "
387499	387500	387495	387495	you	9610	" "
387506	387507	387504	387504	sir	9569	" "
387521	387856	387857	387857	Our	8759	" We were again upon the melancholy road by which we had come , tearing up the miry sleet and thawing snow as if they were torn up by a waterwheel . CHAPTER LVIII A Wintry Day and Night Still impassive , as behoves its breeding , the Dedlock town house carries itself as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur . There are powdered heads from time to time in the little windows of the hall , looking out at the untaxed powder falling all day from the sky ; and in the same conservatory there is peach blossom turning itself exotically to the great hall fire from the nipping weather out of doors . It is given out that my Lady has gone down into Lincolnshire , but is expected to return presently . Rumour , busy overmuch , however , will not go down into Lincolnshire . It persists in flitting and chattering about town . It knows that that poor unfortunate man , Sir Leicester , has been sadly used . It hears , my dear child , all sorts of shocking things . It makes the world of five miles round quite merry . Not to know that there is something wrong at the Dedlocks ' is to augur yourself unknown . One of the peachy - cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats is already apprised of all the principal circumstances that will come out before the Lords on Sir Leicester 's application for a bill of divorce . At Blaze and Sparkle 's the jewellers and at Sheen and Gloss 's the mercers , it is and will be for several hours the topic of the age , the feature of the century . The patronesses of those establishments , albeit so loftily inscrutable , being as nicely weighed and measured there as any other article of the stock - in - trade , are perfectly understood in this new fashion by the rawest hand behind the counter . "
387863	387877	387860	387861	Mr. Jones	680	" said Blaze and Sparkle to the hand in question on engaging him , "
387920	387979	387911	387912	Mr. Jones	680	" So , likewise , Sheen and Gloss to THEIR Jones , in reference to knowing where to have the fashionable people and how to bring what they Sheen and Gloss choose into fashion . On similar unerring principles , Mr. Sladdery the librarian , and indeed the great farmer of gorgeous sheep , admits this very day , "
388170	388458	388168	388168	sir	9569	" Thus rumour thrives in the capital , and will not go down into Lincolnshire . By half - past five , post meridian , Horse Guards ' time , it has even elicited a new remark from the Honourable Mr. Stables , which bids fair to outshine the old one , on which he has so long rested his colloquial reputation . This sparkling sally is to the effect that although he always knew she was the best - groomed woman in the stud , he had no idea she was a bolter . It is immensely received in turf - circles . At feasts and festivals also , in firmaments she has often graced , and among constellations she outshone but yesterday , she is still the prevalent subject . What is it ? Who is it ? When was it ? Where was it ? How was it ? She is discussed by her dear friends with all the genteelest slang in vogue , with the last new word , the last new manner , the last new drawl , and the perfection of polite indifference . A remarkable feature of the theme is that it is found to be so inspiring that several people come out upon it who never came out before - positively say things ! William Buffy carries one of these smartnesses from the place where he dines down to the House , where the Whip for his party hands it about with his snuff - box to keep men together who want to be off , with such effect that the Speaker who has had it privately insinuated into his own ear under the corner of his wig cries , "
388464	388782	388168	388168	sir	9569	" three times without making an impression . And not the least amazing circumstance connected with her being vaguely the town talk is that people hovering on the confines of Mr. Sladdery 's high connexion , people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her , think it essential to their reputation to pretend that she is their topic too , and to retail her at second- hand with the last new word and the last new manner , and the last new drawl , and the last new polite indifference , and all the rest of it , all at second - hand but considered equal to new in inferior systems and to fainter stars . If there be any man of letters , art , or science among these little dealers , how noble in him to support the feeble sisters on such majestic crutches ! So goes the wintry day outside the Dedlock mansion . How within it ? Sir Leicester , lying in his bed , can speak a little , though with difficulty and indistinctness . He is enjoined to silence and to rest , and they have given him some opiate to lull his pain , for his old enemy is very hard with him . He is never asleep , though sometimes he seems to fall into a dull waking doze . He caused his bedstead to be moved out nearer to the window when he heard it was such inclement weather , and his head to be so adjusted that he could see the driving snow and sleet . He watches it as it falls , throughout the whole wintry day . Upon the least noise in the house , which is kept hushed , his hand is at the pencil . The old housekeeper , sitting by him , knows what he would write and whispers , "
388814	388948	388804	388804	He	8777	" He withdraws his hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow again until they seem , by being long looked at , to fall so thick and fast that he is obliged to close his eyes for a minute on the giddy whirl of white flakes and icy blots . He began to look at them as soon as it was light . The day is not yet far spent when he conceives it to be necessary that her rooms should be prepared for her . It is very cold and wet . Let there be good fires . Let them know that she is expected . Please see to it yourself . He writes to this purpose on his slate , and Mrs. Rouncewell with a heavy heart obeys . "
388955	388978	388953	388953	George	336	" the old lady says to her son , who waits below to keep her company when she has a little leisure , "

389400	389694	389695	389695	He	8803	" He is not far out . As all partings foreshadow the great final one , so , empty rooms , bereft of a familiar presence , mournfully whisper what your room and what mine must one day be . My Lady 's state has a hollow look , thus gloomy and abandoned ; and in the inner apartment , where Mr. Bucket last night made his secret perquisition , the traces of her dresses and her ornaments , even the mirrors accustomed to reflect them when they were a portion of herself , have a desolate and vacant air . Dark and cold as the wintry day is , it is darker and colder in these deserted chambers than in many a hut that will barely exclude the weather ; and though the servants heap fires in the grates and set the couches and the chairs within the warm glass screens that let their ruddy light shoot through to the furthest corners , there is a heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will dispel . The old housekeeper and her son remain until the preparations are complete , and then she returns upstairs . Volumnia has taken Mrs. Rouncewell 's place in the meantime , though pearl necklaces and rouge pots , however calculated to embellish Bath , are but indifferent comforts to the invalid under present circumstances . Volumnia , not being supposed to know and indeed not knowing what is the matter , has found it a ticklish task to offer appropriate observations and consequently has supplied their place with distracting smoothings of the bed - linen , elaborate locomotion on tiptoe , vigilant peeping at her kinsman 's eyes , and one exasperating whisper to herself of , "
389699	389715	389695	389695	He	8803	" In disproof of which superfluous remark Sir Leicester has indignantly written on the slate , "
389720	389806	389695	389695	He	8803	" Yielding , therefore , the chair at the bedside to the quaint old housekeeper , Volumnia sits at a table a little removed , sympathetically sighing . Sir Leicester watches the sleet and snow and listens for the returning steps that he expects . In the ears of his old servant , looking as if she had stepped out of an old picture - frame to attend a summoned Dedlock to another world , the silence is fraught with echoes of her own words , "
389812	390113	389695	389695	He	8803	" He has been under his valet 's hands this morning to be made presentable and is as well got up as the circumstances will allow . He is propped with pillows , his grey hair is brushed in its usual manner , his linen is arranged to a nicety , and he is wrapped in a responsible dressing - gown . His eye - glass and his watch are ready to his hand . It is necessary - less to his own dignity now perhaps than for her sake - that he should be seen as little disturbed and as much himself as may be . Women will talk , and Volumnia , though a Dedlock , is no exceptional case . He keeps her here , there is little doubt , to prevent her talking somewhere else . He is very ill , but he makes his present stand against distress of mind and body most courageously . The fair Volumnia , being one of those sprightly girls who can not long continue silent without imminent peril of seizure by the dragon Boredom , soon indicates the approach of that monster with a series of undisguisable yawns . Finding it impossible to suppress those yawns by any other process than conversation , she compliments Mrs. Rouncewell on her son , declaring that he positively is one of the finest figures she ever saw and as soldierly a looking person , she should think , as what 's his name , her favourite Life Guardsman - the man she dotes on , the dearest of creatures - who was killed at Waterloo . Sir Leicester hears this tribute with so much surprise and stares about him in such a confused way that Mrs. Rouncewell feels it necessary to explain . "
390141	390151	390152	390152	George	336	" Sir Leicester breaks silence with a harsh cry . "
390163	390171	390156	390156	George	336	" The old housekeeper wipes her eyes . "
390180	390213	390177	390178	Sir Leicester	268	" Does this discovery of some one lost , this return of some one so long gone , come upon him as a strong confirmation of his hopes ? Does he think , "
390244	390279	390282	390282	you	333	" It is of no use entreating him ; he is determined to speak now , and he does . In a thick crowd of sounds , but still intelligibly enough to be understood . "
390290	390291	390282	390282	you	333	" "
390315	390378	390301	390301	I	0	" Besides , the giddy Volumnia now remembers with her little scream that nobody was to have known of his being Mrs. Rouncewell 's son and that she was not to have told . But Mrs. Rouncewell protests , with warmth enough to swell the stomacher , that of course she would have told Sir Leicester as soon as he got better . "
390388	390414	390385	390386	Mrs. Rouncewell	333	" asks Sir Leicester , Mrs. Rouncewell , not a little alarmed by his disregard of the doctor 's injunctions , replies , in London . "
390419	390433	390301	390301	I	0	" Mrs. Rouncewell is constrained to admit that he is in the house . "
390445	390589	390301	390301	I	0	" The old lady can do nothing but go in search of him . Sir Leicester , with such power of movement as he has , arranges himself a little to receive him . When he has done so , he looks out again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps . A quantity of straw has been tumbled down in the street to deaden the noises there , and she might be driven to the door perhaps without his hearing wheels . He is lying thus , apparently forgetful of his newer and minor surprise , when the housekeeper returns , accompanied by her trooper son . Mr. George approaches softly to the bedside , makes his bow , squares his chest , and stands , with his face flushed , very heartily ashamed of himself . "
390600	390605	390597	390598	George Rouncewell	336	" exclaims Sir Leicester . "
390613	390652	390607	390607	you	336	" The trooper needs to look at him and to separate this sound from that sound before he knows what he has said , but doing this and being a little helped by his mother , he replies , "
390673	390674	390671	390671	you	268	" "
390684	390691	390681	390682	George Rouncewell	336	" Sir Leicester observes with difficulty , "
390709	390733	390734	390734	I	0	" He looks at the trooper until tears come into his eyes , and then he looks at the sleet and snow again . "
390742	390747	390734	390734	I	0	" says the trooper , "
390777	390778	390780	390780	you	268	" "
390793	390820	390822	390822	you	268	" The trooper takes him in his arms like a child , lightly raises him , and turns him with his face more towards the window . "
390831	390836	390826	390827	your mother	9597	" returns Sir Leicester , "
390845	390871	390843	390843	you	268	" He signs to him with his hand not to go away . George quietly remains at the bedside , waiting to be spoken to . "
390879	390890	390874	390874	you	268	" It takes Sir Leicester some time to ask this . "
391000	391001	390992	390992	I	0	" "
391008	391013	391002	391002	You	268	" observes Sir Leicester , "
391019	391026	391002	391002	You	268	" George makes his military bow . "
391053	391054	391055	391055	You	268	" "
391059	391072	391055	391055	You	268	" says Sir Leicester , whose eyes are much attracted towards him , "
391080	391081	391077	391078	George Rouncewell	336	" "
391098	391099	391103	391103	you	268	" "
391128	391140	391077	391078	George Rouncewell	336	" making an endeavour to pass one hand down one side , "
391144	391257	391077	391078	George Rouncewell	336	" touching his lips . George , with a look of assent and sympathy , makes another bow . The different times when they were both young men the trooper much the younger of the two and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold arise before them both and soften both . Sir Leicester , evidently with a great determination to say , in his own manner , something that is on his mind before relapsing into silence , tries to raise himself among his pillows a little more . George , observant of the action , takes him in his arms again and places him as he desires to be . "
391296	391329	391283	391283	You	0	" He has put Sir Leicester 's sounder arm over his shoulder in lifting him up , and Sir Leicester is slow in drawing it away again as he says these words . "
391336	391342	391330	391330	I	0	" he presently goes on , "
391453	391511	391444	391444	my	0	" Volumnia understands him perfectly , and in truth he delivers himself with far greater plainness than could have been supposed possible a minute ago . The effort by which he does so is written in the anxious and labouring expression of his face . Nothing but the strength of his purpose enables him to make it . "
391610	391647	391604	391604	I	0	" The old housekeeper weeping silently ; Volumnia in the greatest agitation , with the freshest bloom on her cheeks ; the trooper with his arms folded and his head a little bent , respectfully attentive . "
391739	391753	391729	391729	you	8824	" Volumnia tremblingly protests that she will observe his injunctions to the letter . "
391883	392209	391874	391874	I	0	" His formal array of words might have at any other time , as it has often had , something ludicrous in it , but at this time it is serious and affecting . His noble earnestness , his fidelity , his gallant shielding of her , his generous conquest of his own wrong and his own pride for her sake , are simply honourable , manly , and true . Nothing less worthy can be seen through the lustre of such qualities in the commonest mechanic , nothing less worthy can be seen in the best - born gentleman . In such a light both aspire alike , both rise alike , both children of the dust shine equally . Overpowered by his exertions , he lays his head back on his pillows and closes his eyes for not more than a minute , when he again resumes his watching of the weather and his attention to the muffled sounds . In the rendering of those little services , and in the manner of their acceptance , the trooper has become installed as necessary to him . Nothing has been said , but it is quite understood . He falls a step or two backward to be out of sight and mounts guard a little behind his mother 's chair . The day is now beginning to decline . The mist and the sleet into which the snow has all resolved itself are darker , and the blaze begins to tell more vividly upon the room walls and furniture . The gloom augments ; the bright gas springs up in the streets ; and the pertinacious oil lamps which yet hold their ground there , with their source of life half frozen and half thawed , twinkle gaspingly like fiery fish out of water - as they are . The world , which has been rumbling over the straw and pulling at the bell , "
392213	392349	391874	391874	I	0	" begins to go home , begins to dress , to dine , to discuss its dear friend with all the last new modes , as already mentioned . Now does Sir Leicester become worse , restless , uneasy , and in great pain . Volumnia , lighting a candle with a predestined aptitude for doing something objectionable , is bidden to put it out again , for it is not yet dark enough . Yet it is very dark too , as dark as it will be all night . By and by she tries again . No ! Put it out . It is not dark enough yet . His old housekeeper is the first to understand that he is striving to uphold the fiction with himself that it is not growing late . "
392358	392363	392350	392352	Dear Sir Leicester	268	" she softly whispers , "
392456	392457	392446	392447	My Lady	934	" "
392478	392479	392471	392471	he	268	" "
392495	392496	392485	392486	Sir Leicester	268	" "
392512	392599	392604	392605	Mrs. Rouncewell	333	" He says it with a groan that wrings her heart . She knows that this is not a period for bringing the rough light upon him ; she thinks his tears too sacred to be seen , even by her . Therefore she sits in the darkness for a while without a word , then gently begins to move about , now stirring the fire , now standing at the dark window looking out . Finally he tells her , with recovered self - command , "
392630	393048	393388	393388	miss	9656	" When it is lighted and the weather shut out , it is only left to him to listen . But they find that however dejected and ill he is , he brightens when a quiet pretence is made of looking at the fires in her rooms and being sure that everything is ready to receive her . Poor pretence as it is , these allusions to her being expected keep up hope within him . Midnight comes , and with it the same blank . The carriages in the streets are few , and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there are none , unless a man so very nomadically drunk as to stray into the frigid zone goes brawling and bellowing along the pavement . Upon this wintry night it is so still that listening to the intense silence is like looking at intense darkness . If any distant sound be audible in this case , it departs through the gloom like a feeble light in that , and all is heavier than before . The corporation of servants are dismissed to bed not unwilling to go , for they were up all last night , and only Mrs. Rouncewell and George keep watch in Sir Leicester 's room . As the night lags tardily on - or rather when it seems to stop altogether , at between two and three o'clock - they find a restless craving on him to know more about the weather , now he can not see it . Hence George , patrolling regularly every half - hour to the rooms so carefully looked after , extends his march to the hall - door , looks about him , and brings back the best report he can make of the worst of nights , the sleet still falling and even the stone footways lying ankle- deep in icy sludge . Volumnia , in her room up a retired landing on the staircase - the second turning past the end of the carving and gilding , a cousinly room containing a fearful abortion of a portrait of Sir Leicester banished for its crimes , and commanding in the day a solemn yard planted with dried - up shrubs like antediluvian specimens of black tea - is a prey to horrors of many kinds . Not last nor least among them , possibly , is a horror of what may befall her little income in the event , as she expresses it , "
393052	393357	393388	393388	miss	9656	" to Sir Leicester . Anything , in this sense , meaning one thing only ; and that the last thing that can happen to the consciousness of any baronet in the known world . An effect of these horrors is that Volumnia finds she can not go to bed in her own room or sit by the fire in her own room , but must come forth with her fair head tied up in a profusion of shawl , and her fair form enrobed in drapery , and parade the mansion like a ghost , particularly haunting the rooms , warm and luxurious , prepared for one who still does not return . Solitude under such circumstances being not to be thought of , Volumnia is attended by her maid , who , impressed from her own bed for that purpose , extremely cold , very sleepy , and generally an injured maid as condemned by circumstances to take office with a cousin , when she had resolved to be maid to nothing less than ten thousand a year , has not a sweet expression of countenance . The periodical visits of the trooper to these rooms , however , in the course of his patrolling is an assurance of protection and company both to mistress and maid , which renders them very acceptable in the small hours of the night . Whenever he is heard advancing , they both make some little decorative preparation to receive him ; at other times they divide their watches into short scraps of oblivion and dialogues not wholly free from acerbity , as to whether Miss Dedlock , sitting with her feet upon the fender , was or was not falling into the fire when rescued to her great displeasure by her guardian genius the maid . "
393367	393378	393364	393365	Mr. George	515	" inquires Volumnia , adjusting her cowl over her head . "
393405	393406	393398	393398	he	268	" "
393413	393418	393408	393408	he	268	" inquires Volumnia tenderly . "
393442	393443	393423	393423	I	0	" "
393454	393455	393451	393452	Mr. George	515	" "
393470	393471	393472	393472	You	9656	" "
393484	393518	393481	393482	Miss Dedlock	626	" quoth the maid sharply . But Volumnia answers No ! No ! She may be asked for , she may be wanted at a moment 's notice . She never should forgive herself "
393524	393586	393472	393472	You	9656	" and she was not on the spot . She declines to enter on the question , mooted by the maid , how the spot comes to be there , and not in her room which is nearer to Sir Leicester 's , but staunchly declares that on the spot she will remain . Volumnia further makes a merit of not having "
393590	393713	393722	393722	miss	9656	" - as if she had twenty or thirty - though it is hard to reconcile this statement with her having most indisputably opened two within five minutes . But when it comes to four o'clock , and still the same blank , Volumnia 's constancy begins to fail her , or rather it begins to strengthen , for she now considers that it is her duty to be ready for the morrow , when much may be expected of her , that , in fact , howsoever anxious to remain upon the spot , it may be required of her , as an act of self - devotion , to desert the spot . So when the trooper reappears with his , "
393724	393736	393722	393722	miss	9656	" and when the maid protests , more sharply than before , "
393749	393756	393746	393747	Miss Dedlock	626	" she meekly rises and says , "
393765	394067	393761	393761	you	8838	" Mr. George undoubtedly thinks it best to escort her on his arm to the door of her cousinly chamber , and the maid as undoubtedly thinks it best to hustle her into bed with mighty little ceremony . Accordingly , these steps are taken ; and now the trooper , in his rounds , has the house to himself . There is no improvement in the weather . From the portico , from the eaves , from the parapet , from every ledge and post and pillar , drips the thawed snow . It has crept , as if for shelter , into the lintels of the great door - under it , into the corners of the windows , into every chink and crevice of retreat , and there wastes and dies . It is falling still ; upon the roof , upon the skylight , even through the skylight , and drip , drip , drip , with the regularity of the Ghost 's Walk , on the stone floor below . The trooper , his old recollections awakened by the solitary grandeur of a great house - no novelty to him once at Chesney Wold - goes up the stairs and through the chief rooms , holding up his light at arm 's length . Thinking of his varied fortunes within the last few weeks , and of his rustic boyhood , and of the two periods of his life so strangely brought together across the wide intermediate space ; thinking of the murdered man whose image is fresh in his mind ; thinking of the lady who has disappeared from these very rooms and the tokens of whose recent presence are all here ; thinking of the master of the house upstairs and of the foreboding , "
394073	394142	393761	393761	you	8838	" he looks here and looks there , and reflects how he MIGHT see something now , which it would tax his boldness to walk up to , lay his hand upon , and prove to be a fancy . But it is all blank , blank as the darkness above and below , while he goes up the great staircase again , blank as the oppressive silence . "
394152	394153	394149	394150	George Rouncewell	336	" "
394162	394163	394159	394160	Sir Leicester	268	" "
394170	394177	394159	394160	Sir Leicester	268	" The trooper shakes his head . "
394187	394294	394159	394160	Sir Leicester	268	" But he knows there is no such hope as that and lays his head down without looking for an answer . Very familiar to him , as he said himself some hours ago , George Rouncewell lifts him into easier positions through the long remainder of the blank wintry night , and equally familiar with his unexpressed wish , extinguishes the light and undraws the curtains at the first late break of day . The day comes like a phantom . Cold , colourless , and vague , it sends a warning streak before it of a deathlike hue , as if it cried out , "
394310	394472	394297	394297	I	0	" CHAPTER LIX Esther 's Narrative It was three o'clock in the morning when the houses outside London did at last begin to exclude the country and to close us in with streets . We had made our way along roads in a far worse condition than when we had traversed them by daylight , both the fall and the thaw having lasted ever since ; but the energy of my companion never slackened . It had only been , as I thought , of less assistance than the horses in getting us on , and it had often aided them . They had stopped exhausted half - way up hills , they had been driven through streams of turbulent water , they had slipped down and become entangled with the harness ; but he and his little lantern had been always ready , and when the mishap was set right , I had never heard any variation in his cool , "
394479	394737	394297	394297	I	0	" The steadiness and confidence with which he had directed our journey back I could not account for . Never wavering , he never even stopped to make an inquiry until we were within a few miles of London . A very few words , here and there , were then enough for him ; and thus we came , at between three and four o'clock in the morning , into Islington . I will not dwell on the suspense and anxiety with which I reflected all this time that we were leaving my mother farther and farther behind every minute . I think I had some strong hope that he must be right and could not fail to have a satisfactory object in following this woman , but I tormented myself with questioning it and discussing it during the whole journey . What was to ensue when we found her and what could compensate us for this loss of time were questions also that I could not possibly dismiss ; my mind was quite tortured by long dwelling on such reflections when we stopped . We stopped in a high - street where there was a coach - stand . My companion paid our two drivers , who were as completely covered with splashes as if they had been dragged along the roads like the carriage itself , and giving them some brief direction where to take it , lifted me out of it and into a hackney - coach he had chosen from the rest . "
394743	394751	394297	394297	I	0	" he said as he did this . "
394757	394868	394297	394297	I	0	" I had not been conscious of it . But the melted snow had found its way into the carriage , and I had got out two or three times when a fallen horse was plunging and had to be got up , and the wet had penetrated my dress . I assured him it was no matter , but the driver , who knew him , would not be dissuaded by me from running down the street to his stable , whence he brought an armful of clean dry straw . They shook it out and strewed it well about me , and I found it warm and comfortable . "
394874	394892	394297	394297	I	0	" said Mr. Bucket , with his head in at the window after I was shut up . "
394933	394965	394931	394931	you	9610	" I little thought what it was , little thought in how short a time I should understand it better , but I assured him that I had confidence in him . "
394974	394978	394967	394967	you	9610	" he returned . "
395072	395078	395063	395063	you	9610	" said Mr. Bucket warmly ; "
395084	395116	395117	395117	My	0	" I told him I was very glad , as indeed I was , to have been no hindrance to him , and that I hoped I should be none now . "
395120	395124	395117	395117	My	0	" he returned , "
395172	395438	395157	395157	She	1247	" With these encouraging words - they really were encouraging to me under those lonely and anxious circumstances - he got upon the box , and we once more drove away . Where we drove I neither knew then nor have ever known since , but we appeared to seek out the narrowest and worst streets in London . Whenever I saw him directing the driver , I was prepared for our descending into a deeper complication of such streets , and we never failed to do so . Sometimes we emerged upon a wider thoroughfare or came to a larger building than the generality , well lighted . Then we stopped at offices like those we had visited when we began our journey , and I saw him in consultation with others . Sometimes he would get down by an archway or at a street corner and mysteriously show the light of his little lantern . This would attract similar lights from various dark quarters , like so many insects , and a fresh consultation would be held . By degrees we appeared to contract our search within narrower and easier limits . Single police - officers on duty could now tell Mr. Bucket what he wanted to know and point to him where to go . At last we stopped for a rather long conversation between him and one of these men , which I supposed to be satisfactory from his manner of nodding from time to time . When it was finished he came to me looking very busy and very attentive . "
395444	395450	395157	395157	She	1247	" he said to me , "
395522	395534	395516	395516	you	283	" Of course I got out directly and took his arm . "
395545	395550	395516	395516	you	283	" said Mr. Bucket , "
395555	395577	395516	395516	you	283	" Although I looked about me confusedly and hurriedly as we crossed the street , I thought I knew the place . "
395583	395588	395516	395516	you	283	" I asked him . "
395591	395596	395516	395516	you	283	" said Mr. Bucket . "
395603	395604	395598	395598	you	283	" "
395611	395612	395598	395598	you	283	" "
395621	395780	395618	395619	my dear	9610	" said Mr. Bucket . We turned down it , and as we went shuffling through the sleet , I heard the clocks strike half - past five . We passed on in silence and as quickly as we could with such a foot - hold , when some one coming towards us on the narrow pavement , wrapped in a cloak , stopped and stood aside to give me room . In the same moment I heard an exclamation of wonder and my own name from Mr. Woodcourt . I knew his voice very well . It was so unexpected and so - I do n't know what to call it , whether pleasant or painful - to come upon it after my feverish wandering journey , and in the midst of the night , that I could not keep back the tears from my eyes . It was like hearing his voice in a strange country . "
395800	395852	395783	395784	Miss Summerson	283	" He had heard from my guardian of my having been called away on some uncommon business and said so to dispense with any explanation . I told him that we had but just left a coach and were going - but then I was obliged to look at my companion . "
395860	395870	395855	395855	you	283	" - he had caught the name from me - "
395886	395907	395883	395884	Inspector Bucket	667	" Mr. Woodcourt , disregarding my remonstrances , had hurriedly taken off his cloak and was putting it about me . "
395916	395923	395883	395884	Inspector Bucket	667	" said Mr. Bucket , assisting , "
395929	395930	395883	395884	Inspector Bucket	667	" "
395937	395954	395932	395932	I	0	" said Mr. Woodcourt . I do n't know whether to me or to my companion . "
395959	395970	395957	395957	Lord	8864	" exclaimed Mr. Bucket , taking the answer on himself . "
395976	395997	395957	395957	Lord	8864	" It was all said in a moment , and they took me between them , wrapped in the cloak . "
396004	396009	395998	395998	I	0	" said Mr. Woodcourt . "
396022	396023	396010	396010	I	0	" "
396033	396034	396029	396029	he	8865	" "
396151	396229	396148	396148	I	0	" His friendly and familiar way of speaking of them , his unaffected devotion to them , the grateful confidence with which I knew he had inspired my darling , and the comfort he was to her ; could I separate all this from his promise to me ? How thankless I must have been if it had not recalled the words he said to me when he was so moved by the change in my appearance : "
396246	396255	396256	396257	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" We now turned into another narrow street . "
396259	396274	396256	396257	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" said Mr. Bucket , who had eyed him closely as we came along , "
396302	396315	396300	396300	you	448	" He was so quick that he saw it in an instant . "
396333	396334	396337	396337	sir	9569	" "
396339	396344	396337	396337	sir	9569	" said Mr. Bucket . "
396374	396410	396372	396372	him	370	" The last police - officer with whom he had conferred was standing silently behind us . I was not aware of it until he struck in on my saying I heard some one crying . "
396418	396422	396416	396416	miss	9656	" he returned . "
396429	396430	396425	396427	Snagsby 's servant	8874	" "
396436	396441	396442	396443	the girl	10396	" said Mr. Bucket , "
396485	396486	396477	396477	she	10396	" "
396507	396513	396504	396505	Mr. Bucket	665	" said the other man . "
396526	396527	396514	396514	She	10396	" "
396534	396538	396514	396514	She	10396	" he returned . "
396550	396617	396546	396546	yours	448	" All this passed in a whisper a door or two from the house in which I could faintly hear crying and moaning . In the little round of light produced for the purpose , Mr. Bucket went up to the door and knocked . The door was opened after he had knocked twice , and he went in , leaving us standing in the street . "
396621	396626	396546	396546	yours	448	" said Mr. Woodcourt , "
396646	396647	396642	396642	me	0	" "
396653	396657	396648	396648	You	0	" I answered . "
396681	396682	396683	396683	I	0	" "
396705	396706	396707	396707	I	0	" "
396713	396717	396707	396707	I	0	" I said . "
396730	396757	396727	396727	your	0	" After a short time the little round of light shone out again , and Mr. Bucket advanced towards us in it with his earnest face . "
396766	396770	396763	396764	Miss Summerson	283	" he said , "
396855	396913	396917	396917	you	448	" We all three went into the house together ; although it was cold and raw , it smelt close too from being up all night . In the passage behind the door stood a scared , sorrowful - looking little man in a grey coat who seemed to have a naturally polite manner and spoke meekly . "
396923	396927	396920	396921	Mr. Bucket	665	" said he . "
396971	397017	396956	396956	she	1169	" We went downstairs , followed by Mr. Snagsby , as I soon found the little man to be . In the front kitchen , sitting by the fire , was Mrs. Snagsby , with very red eyes and a very severe expression of face . "
397022	397031	396956	396956	she	1169	" said Mr. Snagsby , entering behind us , "
397073	397094	397095	397095	My	0	" She looked very much astonished , as she had reason for doing , and looked particularly hard at me . "
397099	397122	397095	397095	My	0	" said Mr. Snagsby , sitting down in the remotest corner by the door , as if he were taking a liberty , "
397192	397229	397185	397185	I	0	" He appeared so miserable , sitting with his head upon his hand , and I appeared so unwelcome , that I was going to offer an apology when Mr. Bucket took the matter on himself . "
397235	397239	397276	397276	sir	9569	" said he , "
397259	397260	397261	397261	My	0	" "
397267	397272	397276	397276	sir	9569	" cried Mr. Snagsby . "
397289	397290	397281	397281	I	0	" "
397297	397305	397308	397308	her	8896	" pursued Mr. Bucket without correcting himself , "
397395	397435	397364	397364	you	370	" As they went out , Mr. Bucket made me sit down in a corner by the fire and take off my wet shoes , which he turned up to dry upon the fender , talking all the time . "
397502	397531	397491	397491	I	0	" Here , standing on the hearth with his wet hat and shawls in his hand , himself a pile of wet , he turned to Mrs. Snagsby . "
397620	397639	397642	397643	Mr. Bucket	665	" Mrs. Snagsby looked rather alarmed , relented a little and faltered , what did Mr. Bucket mean . "
397646	397688	397642	397643	Mr. Bucket	665	" he repeated , and I saw by his face that all the time he talked he was listening for the discovery of the letter , to my own great agitation , for I knew then how important it must be ; "
397712	397719	397694	397694	he	665	" Mrs. Snagsby consciously asked why . "
397722	397727	397694	397694	he	665	" said Mr. Bucket . "
397849	397865	397845	397847	that young lady	7112	" Mrs. Snagsby appeared to understand the reference better than I did at the time . "
398012	398026	398002	398003	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" Mrs. Snagsby shook her head and put her handkerchief to her eyes . "
398031	398037	398002	398003	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" said Mr. Bucket excitedly . "
398172	398217	398153	398153	she	8922	" He so thoroughly meant what he said now that I involuntarily clasped my hands and felt the room turning away from me . But it stopped . Mr. Woodcourt came in , put a paper into his hand , and went away again . "
398230	398240	398220	398221	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" said Mr. Bucket , rapidly glancing at it , "
398299	398314	398294	398294	your	370	" In an instant she was gone , and he had shut the door . "
398328	398329	398319	398319	you	370	" "
398332	398335	398319	398319	you	370	" said I. "
398341	398381	398382	398382	You	370	" It was my mother 's . A pencil - writing , on a crushed and torn piece of paper , blotted with wet . Folded roughly like a letter , and directed to me at my guardian 's . "
398387	398391	398382	398382	You	370	" he said , "
398413	398430	398431	398431	I	0	" It had been written in portions , at different times . I read what follows : "
398539	398540	398542	398542	I	0	" "
398550	398555	398570	398570	I	0	" said my companion , "
398574	398583	398570	398570	I	0	" The next was written at another time : "
398690	398691	398657	398657	others	9603	" "
398695	398700	398657	398657	others	9603	" said Mr. Bucket . "
398709	398729	398730	398730	I	0	" Those , too , were written at another time . To all appearance , almost in the dark : "
398799	398816	398797	398797	Forgive	684	" Mr. Bucket , supporting me with his arm , lowered me gently into my chair . "
398850	399110	399111	399113	My poor girl	13643	" I did as he required , but I was left there a long time , praying for my unhappy mother . They were all occupied with the poor girl , and I heard Mr. Woodcourt directing them and speaking to her often . At length he came in with Mr. Bucket and said that as it was important to address her gently , he thought it best that I should ask her for whatever information we desired to obtain . There was no doubt that she could now reply to questions if she were soothed and not alarmed . The questions , Mr. Bucket said , were how she came by the letter , what passed between her and the person who gave her the letter , and where the person went . Holding my mind as steadily as I could to these points , I went into the next room with them . Mr. Woodcourt would have remained outside , but at my solicitation went in with us . The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down . They stood around her , though at a little distance , that she might have air . She was not pretty and looked weak and poor , but she had a plaintive and a good face , though it was still a little wild . I kneeled on the ground beside her and put her poor head upon my shoulder , whereupon she drew her arm round my neck and burst into tears . "
399115	399136	399111	399113	My poor girl	13643	" said I , laying my face against her forehead , for indeed I was crying too , and trembling , "
399164	399187	399188	399188	We	8943	" She began piteously declaring that she did n't mean any harm , she did n't mean any harm , Mrs. Snagsby ! "
399195	399198	399188	399188	We	8943	" said I. "
399208	399209	399204	399204	you	13643	" "
399233	399234	399230	399231	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" "
399241	399244	399235	399235	I	0	" said I. "
399250	399251	399252	399252	I	0	" "
399389	399423	399375	399375	I	0	" It was necessary for her mistress to comfort her - which she did , I must say , with a good deal of contrition - before she could be got beyond this . "
399431	399434	399424	399424	She	8947	" said I. "
399437	399446	399424	399424	She	8947	" cried the girl , shaking her head . "
399492	399493	399480	399480	you	372	" "
399501	399513	399496	399496	Guster	373	" said he , at first not knowing what to say . "
399519	399520	399523	399523	she	8947	" "
399529	399542	399523	399523	she	8947	" said the girl , looking at me with wide open eyes , "
399636	399669	399607	399607	she	8947	" As I watched her face and soothed her to go on , I saw that Mr. Bucket received this with a look which I could not separate from one of alarm . "
399676	399689	399607	399607	she	8947	" cried the girl , pressing her hair back with her hands . "
399747	399748	399749	399749	You	1100	" "
399756	399759	399749	399749	You	1100	" sald I. "
399767	399768	399770	399770	I	0	" "
399798	399806	399792	399792	I	0	" Angry with her , poor soul ! "
399983	399984	399974	399974	she	8964	" "
399990	399991	399974	399974	she	8964	" "
399994	400003	399974	399974	she	8964	" cried the girl , anticipating the inquiry . "
400039	400070	400021	400022	Mrs. Snagsby	372	" Mr. Woodcourt took her kindly from me . Mr. Bucket wrapped me up , and immediately we were in the street . Mr. Woodcourt hesitated , but I said , "
400077	400083	400084	400084	You	0	" and Mr. Bucket added , "
400101	400482	400483	400484	Miss Summerson	283	" I have the most confused impressions of that walk . I recollect that it was neither night nor day , that morning was dawning but the street - lamps were not yet put out , that the sleet was still falling and that all the ways were deep with it . I recollect a few chilled people passing in the streets . I recollect the wet house - tops , the clogged and bursting gutters and water - spouts , the mounds of blackened ice and snow over which we passed , the narrowness of the courts by which we went . At the same time I remember that the poor girl seemed to be yet telling her story audibly and plainly in my hearing , that I could feel her resting on my arm , that the stained house - fronts put on human shapes and looked at me , that great water - gates seemed to be opening and closing in my head or in the air , and that the unreal things were more substantial than the real . At last we stood under a dark and miserable covered way , where one lamp was burning over an iron gate and where the morning faintly struggled in . The gate was closed . Beyond it was a burial ground - a dreadful spot in which the night was very slowly stirring , but where I could dimly see heaps of dishonoured graves and stones , hemmed in by filthy houses with a few dull lights in their windows and on whose walls a thick humidity broke out like a disease . On the step at the gate , drenched in the fearful wet of such a place , which oozed and splashed down everywhere , I saw , with a cry of pity and horror , a woman lying - Jenny , the mother of the dead child . I ran forward , but they stopped me , and Mr. Woodcourt entreated me with the greatest earnestness , even with tears , before I went up to the figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said . I did so , as I thought . I did so , as I am sure . "
400504	400542	400497	400497	They	8969	" They changed clothes at the cottage . I could repeat the words in my mind , and I knew what they meant of themselves , but I attached no meaning to them in any other connexion . "
400547	400552	400554	400554	one	9864	" said Mr. Bucket , "
400587	400820	400822	400822	she	8975	" I could repeat this in my mind too , but I had not the least idea what it meant . I saw before me , lying on the step , the mother of the dead child . She lay there with one arm creeping round a bar of the iron gate and seeming to embrace it . She lay there , who had so lately spoken to my mother . She lay there , a distressed , unsheltered , senseless creature . She who had brought my mother 's letter , who could give me the only clue to where my mother was ; she , who was to guide us to rescue and save her whom we had sought so far , who had come to this condition by some means connected with my mother that I could not follow , and might be passing beyond our reach and help at that moment ; she lay there , and they stopped me ! I saw but did not comprehend the solemn and compassionate look in Mr. Woodcourt 's face . I saw but did not comprehend his touching the other on the breast to keep him back . I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air , with a reverence for something . But my understanding for all this was gone . I even heard it said between them , "
400825	400826	400827	400827	She	8975	" "
400850	401071	401072	401073	Dame Trot	657	" I passed on to the gate and stooped down . I lifted the heavy head , put the long dank hair aside , and turned the face . And it was my mother , cold and dead . CHAPTER LX Perspective I proceed to other passages of my narrative . From the goodness of all about me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved . I have already said so much of myself , and so much still remains , that I will not dwell upon my sorrow . I had an illness , but it was not a long one ; and I would avoid even this mention of it if I could quite keep down the recollection of their sympathy . I proceed to other passages of my narrative . During the time of my illness , we were still in London , where Mrs. Woodcourt had come , on my guardian 's invitation , to stay with us . When my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with him in our old way - though I could have done that sooner if he would have believed me - I resumed my work and my chair beside his . He had appointed the time himself , and we were alone . "
401075	401085	401072	401073	Dame Trot	657	" said he , receiving me with a kiss , "

401148	401151	401154	401155	my dear	9610	" said I. "
401160	401164	401232	401232	Ada	294	" he returned , "
401173	401198	401232	401232	Ada	294	" I thought his tone sounded sorrowful , but looking at him , I saw his kind face lighted up by its pleasantest smile . "
401202	401217	401232	401232	Ada	294	" he repeated - and his tone did NOT sound sorrowful , I found - "
401246	401247	401238	401238	Ada	294	" "
401255	401259	401251	401251	you	0	" said I , "

401427	401555	401416	401416	he	448	" My dear girl had been to see us lately every day , some times twice in a day . But we had foreseen , all along , that this would only last until I was quite myself . We knew full well that her fervent heart was as full of affection and gratitude towards her cousin John as it had ever been , and we acquitted Richard of laying any injunctions upon her to stay away ; but we knew on the other hand that she felt it a part of her duty to him to be sparing of her visits at our house . My guardian 's delicacy had soon perceived this and had tried to convey to her that he thought she was right . "
401563	401566	401556	401556	Dear	1100	" said I. "
401575	401576	401556	401556	Dear	1100	" "
401591	401596	401577	401577	He	8992	" replied my guardian . "
401625	401632	401605	401605	he	8992	" I could not help adding , "
401636	401637	401605	401605	he	8992	" "
401646	401651	401643	401644	Dame Trot	657	" returned my guardian , "
401730	401756	401711	401711	He	319	" His gentleness and consideration for Richard whenever we spoke of him touched me so that I was always silent on this subject very soon . "
401791	401796	401786	401789	one of their suitors	9000	" pursued my guardian . "
401824	401849	401816	401816	I	0	" He checked himself in glancing towards the window to look where the wind was and leaned on the back of my chair instead . "
401963	401986	401988	401988	he	9007	" But I had already discussed it with him , I confessed ; and so , I thought , had Mr. Woodcourt . "
401992	401997	401988	401988	he	9007	" returned my guardian . "
402041	402072	402034	402034	you	9610	" In answer to this question , which was oddly abrupt , I said I liked her very much and thought she was more agreeable than she used to be . "
402078	402083	402034	402034	you	9610	" said my guardian . "
402099	402126	402091	402092	Morgan ap	477	" That was what I meant , I acknowledged , though he was a very harmless person , even when we had had more of him . "
402142	402147	402148	402148	I	0	" said my guardian . "
402171	402252	402167	402168	Mrs. Woodcourt	481	" No . And yet - My guardian looked at me , waiting for what I had to say . I had nothing to say . At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say . I had an undefined impression that it might have been better if we had had some other inmate , but I could hardly have explained why even to myself . Or , if to myself , certainly not to anybody else . "
402256	402261	402167	402168	Mrs. Woodcourt	481	" said my guardian , "
402302	402347	402292	402292	she	481	" Yes . That was undeniable . I had nothing to say against it . I could not have suggested a better arrangement , but I was not quite easy in my mind . Esther , Esther , why not ? Esther , think ! "

402373	402402	402370	402371	little woman	1937	" Quite sure . I had had a moment 's time to think , since I had urged that duty on myself , and I was quite sure . "
402405	402410	402370	402371	little woman	1937	" said my guardian . "
402419	402420	402370	402371	little woman	1937	" "
402424	402512	402513	402513	You	9021	" I repeated , going on with my work . It was a cover for his book - table that I happened to be ornamenting . It had been laid by on the night preceding my sad journey and never resumed . I showed it to him now , and he admired it highly . After I had explained the pattern to him and all the great effects that were to come out by and by , I thought I would go back to our last theme . "
402550	402551	402544	402544	you	9021	" "

402598	402612	402571	402571	I	0	" returned my guardian , beginning his answer in a very deliberate manner . "
402771	402772	402767	402767	Woodcourt	448	" "
402780	402784	402775	402775	he	448	" I asked . "
402790	402797	402800	402801	an oracle	9040	" returned my guardian , smiling , "

402939	403462	403463	403464	My dear	9610	" We said no more about it , nor did he say a word about the future of Bleak House . But it was the first time I had taken my seat at his side in my mourning dress , and that accounted for it , I considered . I now began to visit my dear girl every day in the dull dark corner where she lived . The morning was my usual time , but whenever I found I had an hour or so to spare , I put on my bonnet and bustled off to Chancery Lane . They were both so glad to see me at all hours , and used to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming in being quite at home , I never knocked , that I had no fear of becoming troublesome just yet . On these occasions I frequently found Richard absent . At other times he would be writing or reading papers in the cause at that table of his , so covered with papers , which was never disturbed . Sometimes I would come upon him lingering at the door of Mr. Vholes 's office . Sometimes I would meet him in the neighbourhood lounging about and biting his nails . I often met him wandering in Lincoln 's Inn , near the place where I had first seen him , oh how different , how different ! That the money Ada brought him was melting away with the candles I used to see burning after dark in Mr. Vholes 's office I knew very well . It was not a large amount in the beginning , he had married in debt , and I could not fail to understand , by this time , what was meant by Mr. Vholes 's shoulder being at the wheel - as I still heard it was . My dear made the best of housekeepers and tried hard to save , but I knew that they were getting poorer and poorer every day . She shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star . She adorned and graced it so that it became another place . Paler than she had been at home , and a little quieter than I had thought natural when she was yet so cheerful and hopeful , her face was so unshadowed that I half believed she was blinded by her love for Richard to his ruinous career . I went one day to dine with them while I was under this impression . As I turned into Symond 's Inn , I met little Miss Flite coming out . She had been to make a stately call upon the wards in Jarndyce , as she still called them , and had derived the highest gratification from that ceremony . Ada had already told me that she called every Monday at five o'clock , with one little extra white bow in her bonnet , which never appeared there at any other time , and with her largest reticule of documents on her arm . "
403466	403470	403463	403464	My dear	9610	" she began . "
403517	403518	403500	403500	Our	9050	" "
403527	403530	403520	403520	Richard	295	" said I. "
403547	403548	403551	403551	he	9054	" "
403557	403562	403551	403551	he	9054	" returned Miss Flite . "
403597	403598	403599	403599	I	0	" "
403610	403613	403602	403602	you	9610	" said I. "
403617	403622	403602	403602	you	9610	" returned Miss Flite , "
403677	403696	403657	403657	He	9061	" It was miserable to hear this from her poor mad lips , though it was no surprise . "
403704	403724	403657	403657	He	9061	" pursued Miss Flite , advancing her lips to my ear with an air of equal patronage and mystery , "
403755	403756	403751	403751	Ye	9610	" "
403759	403762	403763	403763	Ye	9610	" said I. "
403767	403777	403763	403763	Ye	9610	" repeated Miss Flite in her most genteel accents , "
403820	403830	403831	403831	I	0	" It made me sigh to think of him . "
403838	403847	403831	403831	I	0	" said Miss Flite , echoing the sigh , "
403898	403924	403944	403945	Miss Flite	381	" She carefully opened her reticule a little way and showed me a folded piece of paper inside as the appointment of which she spoke . "
403940	403941	403931	403931	I	0	" "
403947	403980	403944	403945	Miss Flite	381	" said I , knowing how it pleased her to have her confidence received with an appearance of interest . She nodded several times , and her face became overcast and gloomy . "
404053	404210	404215	404216	Miss Summerson	283	" The poor soul kissed me with the most troubled look I had ever seen in her and went her way . Her manner of running over the names of her birds , as if she were afraid of hearing them even from her own lips , quite chilled me . This was not a cheering preparation for my visit , and I could have dispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes , when Richard who arrived within a minute or two after me brought him to share our dinner . Although it was a very plain one , Ada and Richard were for some minutes both out of the room together helping to get ready what we were to eat and drink . Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a little conversation in a low voice with me . He came to the window where I was sitting and began upon Symond 's Inn . "
404228	404247	404215	404216	Miss Summerson	283	" said Mr. Vholes , smearing the glass with his black glove to make it clearer for me . "
404256	404259	404215	404216	Miss Summerson	283	" said I. "
404266	404271	404264	404264	miss	9656	" returned Mr. Vholes . "
404307	404319	404320	404320	I	0	" I thanked Mr. Vholes and said he was quite well . "
404336	404341	404320	404320	I	0	" said Mr. Vholes , "
404407	404408	404400	404401	Mr. C.	617	" "
404417	404418	404409	404409	He	288	" "
404422	404476	404409	404409	He	288	" said Mr. Vholes . He stood behind me with his long black figure reaching nearly to the ceiling of those low rooms , feeling the pimples on his face as if they were ornaments and speaking inwardly and evenly as though there were not a human passion or emotion in his nature . "
404489	404493	404483	404484	Mr. C.	617	" he resumed . "
404501	404505	404494	404495	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" I answered . "
404516	404517	404494	404495	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" "
404527	404530	404494	404495	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" said I. "
404534	404574	404575	404576	Miss Summerson	283	" said Mr. Vholes . So slow , so eager , so bloodless and gaunt , I felt as if Richard were wasting away beneath the eyes of this adviser and there were something of the vampire in him . "
404578	404613	404575	404576	Miss Summerson	283	" said Mr. Vholes , very slowly rubbing his gloved hands , as if , to his cold sense of touch , they were much the same in black kid or out of it , "
404626	404682	404622	404623	Mr. C.	617	" I begged he would excuse me from discussing it . They had been engaged when they were both very young , I told him a little indignantly and when the prospect before them was much fairer and brighter . When Richard had not yielded himself to the unhappy influence which now darkened his life . "
404686	404692	404622	404623	Mr. C.	617	" assented Mr. Vholes again . "
404809	404810	404791	404791	I	0	" "
404833	404837	404830	404831	Mr. Vholes	248	" said I , "
404858	404891	404892	404893	Miss Summerson	283	" Mr. Vholes , with a noiseless cough - or rather gasp - into one of his black gloves , inclined his head as if he did not wholly dispute even that . "
404895	404899	404892	404893	Miss Summerson	283	" he said , "
405077	405078	405069	405070	Mr. C.	617	" "
405087	405088	405084	405085	Mr. Vholes	248	" "
405092	405108	405084	405085	Mr. Vholes	248	" returned Mr. Vholes , going on in exactly the same inward and dispassionate manner . "
405403	405791	405397	405397	you	9104	" He broke off thus in answer to Richard , who addressed him as he came into the room . By this time I too well understood Mr. Vholes 's scrupulous way of saving himself and his respectability not to feel that our worst fears did but keep pace with his client 's progress . We sat down to dinner , and I had an opportunity of observing Richard , anxiously . I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes who took off his gloves to dine , though he sat opposite to me at the small table , for I doubt if , looking up at all , he once removed his eyes from his host 's face . I found Richard thin and languid , slovenly in his dress , abstracted in his manner , forcing his spirits now and then , and at other intervals relapsing into a dull thoughtfulness . About his large bright eyes that used to be so merry there was a wanness and a restlessness that changed them altogether . I can not use the expression that he looked old . There is a ruin of youth which is not like age , and into such a ruin Richard 's youth and youthful beauty had all fallen away . He ate little and seemed indifferent what it was , showed himself to be much more impatient than he used to be , and was quick even with Ada . I thought at first that his old light - hearted manner was all gone , but it shone out of him sometimes as I had occasionally known little momentary glimpses of my own old face to look out upon me from the glass . His laugh had not quite left him either , but it was like the echo of a joyful sound , and that is always sorrowful . Yet he was as glad as ever , in his old affectionate way , to have me there , and we talked of the old times pleasantly . These did not appear to be interesting to Mr. Vholes , though he occasionally made a gasp which I believe was his smile . He rose shortly after dinner and said that with the permission of the ladies he would retire to his office . "
405799	405803	405797	405797	Vholes	248	" cried Richard . "
405809	405813	405806	405807	Mr. C.	617	" he returned , "
405878	406213	405876	405877	Mr. C.	617	" Richard expressed himself quite sure of that and lighted Mr. Vholes out . On his return he told us , more than once , that Vholes was a good fellow , a safe fellow , a man who did what he pretended to do , a very good fellow indeed ! He was so defiant about it that it struck me he had begun to doubt Mr. Vholes . Then he threw himself on the sofa , tired out ; and Ada and I put things to rights , for they had no other servant than the woman who attended to the chambers . My dear girl had a cottage piano there and quietly sat down to sing some of Richard 's favourites , the lamp being first removed into the next room , as he complained of its hurting his eyes . I sat between them , at my dear girl 's side , and felt very melancholy listening to her sweet voice . I think Richard did too ; I think he darkened the room for that reason . She had been singing some time , rising between whiles to bend over him and speak to him , when Mr. Woodcourt came in . Then he sat down by Richard and half playfully , half earnestly , quite naturally and easily , found out how he felt and where he had been all day . Presently he proposed to accompany him in a short walk on one of the bridges , as it was a moonlight airy night ; and Richard readily consenting , they went out together . They left my dear girl still sitting at the piano and me still sitting beside her . When they were gone out , I drew my arm round her waist . She put her left hand in mine I was sitting on that side , but kept her right upon the keys , going over and over them without striking any note . "
406219	406226	406214	406214	Esther	283	" she said , breaking silence , "
406256	406308	406252	406252	you	283	" I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be , because Mr. Woodcourt had come to her cousin John 's house and had known us all there , and because he had always liked Richard , and Richard had always liked him , and - and so forth . "
406312	406316	406252	406252	you	283	" said Ada , "
406332	406370	406319	406319	he	9116	" I thought it best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more about it . So I said as much . I said it lightly , because I felt her trembling . "
406397	406443	406392	406392	You	283	" I teach ! I said no more , for I noticed the hand that was fluttering over the keys , and I knew that it was not I who ought to speak , that it was she who had something to say to me . "
406498	406499	406487	406487	I	0	" "
406509	406510	406503	406503	I	0	" "
406586	406625	406626	406626	You	283	" In the momentary firmness of the hand that was never still - a firmness inspired by the utterance of these last words , and dying away with them - I saw the confirmation of her earnest tones . "
406679	406710	406711	406711	I	0	" She spoke so modestly and softly and her trembling hand expressed such agitation as it moved to and fro upon the silent notes ! My dear , dear girl ! "
406819	406847	406809	406809	him	9122	" I felt her trembling more . I waited for what was yet to come , and I now thought I began to know what it was . "
406856	406873	406854	406854	Esther	283	" She stopped a minute . Stopped speaking only ; her hand was still in motion . "
406934	406954	406963	406963	Esther	283	" Her hand stopped now . She clasped me in her arms , and I clasped her in mine . "
407082	407101	407114	407114	they	9136	" Oh , my sweet girl , what a heart was that which beat so fast against me ! "
407135	407157	407130	407130	I	0	" I tried to cheer my darling , and asked her what it was . Sobbing and weeping , she replied , "
407168	407592	407593	407593	My	0	" CHAPTER LXI A Discovery The days when I frequented that miserable corner which my dear girl brightened can never fade in my remembrance . I never see it , and I never wish to see it now ; I have been there only once since , but in my memory there is a mournful glory shining on the place which will shine for ever . Not a day passed without my going there , of course . At first I found Mr. Skimpole there , on two or three occasions , idly playing the piano and talking in his usual vivacious strain . Now , besides my very much mistrusting the probability of his being there without making Richard poorer , I felt as if there were something in his careless gaiety too inconsistent with what I knew of the depths of Ada 's life . I clearly perceived , too , that Ada shared my feelings . I therefore resolved , after much thinking of it , to make a private visit to Mr. Skimpole and try delicately to explain myself . My dear girl was the great consideration that made me bold . I set off one morning , accompanied by Charley , for Somers Town . As I approached the house , I was strongly inclined to turn back , for I felt what a desperate attempt it was to make an impression on Mr. Skimpole and how extremely likely it was that he would signally defeat me . However , I thought that being there , I would go through with it . I knocked with a trembling hand at Mr. Skimpole 's door - literally with a hand , for the knocker was gone - and after a long parley gained admission from an Irishwoman , who was in the area when I knocked , breaking up the lid of a water - butt with a poker to light the fire with . Mr. Skimpole , lying on the sofa in his room , playing the flute a little , was enchanted to see me . Now , who should receive me , he asked . Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies ? Would I have his Comedy daughter , his Beauty daughter , or his Sentiment daughter ? Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay ? I replied , half defeated already , that I wished to speak to himself only if he would give me leave . "
407604	407620	407593	407593	My	0	" he said , bringing his chair nearer mine and breaking into his fascinating smile , "
407633	407655	407660	407661	Miss Summerson	283	" I said it certainly was not business that I came upon , but it was not quite a pleasant matter . "
407663	407671	407660	407661	Miss Summerson	283	" said he with the frankest gaiety , "
407752	407772	407773	407773	I	0	" Although I was embarrassed , I took courage to intimate that I still wished to pursue the subject . "
407780	407789	407773	407773	I	0	" said Mr. Skimpole with his airy laugh , "
407805	407806	407807	407808	Mr. Skimpole	326	" "
407810	407820	407807	407808	Mr. Skimpole	326	" said I , raising my eyes to his , "
407839	407840	407829	407829	you	326	" "
407862	407869	407860	407860	D	686	" said Mr. Skimpole , brightly . "
407876	407877	407860	407860	D	686	" "
407882	407887	407888	407888	you	326	" I went on , "
407913	407914	407916	407916	me	0	" "
407918	407923	407916	407916	me	0	" said Mr. Skimpole . "
407932	407933	407928	407928	they	9142	" "
407940	407941	407928	407928	they	9142	" "
407947	407956	407928	407928	they	9142	" said Mr. Skimpole with a delighted countenance . "
408016	408046	408011	408011	you	326	" I was coming to the point with great difficulty when he took me by both hands and with a radiant face and in the liveliest way anticipated it . "
408249	408276	408243	408243	them	9151	" Through the beaming smile with which he regarded me as he reasoned thus , there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing . "
408279	408294	408243	408243	them	9151	" he said , pursuing his argument in his tone of light- hearted conviction , "
408420	408502	408503	408504	Mr. Skimpole	326	" He finished by genially kissing my hand and thanking me . Nothing but Miss Summerson 's fine tact , he said , would have found this out for him . I was much disconcerted , but I reflected that if the main point were gained , it mattered little how strangely he perverted everything leading to it . I had determined to mention something else , however , and I thought I was not to be put off in that . "
408506	408510	408503	408504	Mr. Skimpole	326	" said I , "
408592	408593	408587	408587	I	0	" "
408604	408614	408601	408602	Miss Summerson	283	" he returned inquiringly , raising his pleasant eyebrows . "
408618	408650	408651	408651	You	326	" He thought about it for a little while with a highly agreeable and whimsical expression of face , then quite gave it up and said in his most engaging manner , "
408662	408726	408651	408651	You	326	" I was reluctant to enter minutely into that question , but as he begged I would , for he was really curious to know , I gave him to understand in the gentlest words I could use that his conduct seemed to involve a disregard of several moral obligations . He was much amused and interested when he heard this and said , "
408731	408736	408651	408651	You	326	" with ingenuous simplicity . "
408768	408773	408774	408774	I	0	" said Mr. Skimpole . "
408821	408831	408818	408818	you	326	" I incautiously gave a qualified assent to this . "
408838	408847	408835	408835	you	326	" said Mr. Skimpole , shaking his head , "
408855	408880	408881	408881	My	0	" I suggested , as I rose to go , that it was not right to betray my guardian 's confidence for a bribe . "
408886	408899	408900	408900	I	0	" he returned with a candid hilarity that was all his own , "
408906	408907	408900	408900	I	0	" "
408913	408916	408910	408911	Mr. Bucket	665	" said I. "
408919	408923	408910	408911	Mr. Bucket	665	" said he . "
408976	408998	408972	408972	I	0	" I showed that I was of a different opinion , though I had not the capacity for arguing the question . "
409003	409008	408972	408972	I	0	" said Mr. Skimpole , "
409089	409130	409085	409085	Caesar	666	" Anything to equal the lightness of his manner and the playful impartiality with which he seemed to convince himself , as he tossed the matter about like a ball of feathers , was surely never seen in anybody else ! "
409600	409638	409597	409597	he	665	" I had nothing to offer in reply to this exposition and therefore took my leave . Mr. Skimpole , however , who was in excellent spirits , would not hear of my returning home attended only by "
409642	409845	409639	409640	Little Coavinses	687	" and accompanied me himself . He entertained me on the way with a variety of delightful conversation and assured me , at parting , that he should never forget the fine tact with which I had found that out for him about our young friends . As it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again , I may at once finish what I know of his history . A coolness arose between him and my guardian , based principally on the foregoing grounds and on his having heartlessly disregarded my guardian 's entreaties as we afterwards learned from Ada in reference to Richard . His being heavily in my guardian 's debt had nothing to do with their separation . He died some five years afterwards and left a diary behind him , with letters and other materials towards his life , which was published and which showed him to have been the victim of a combination on the part of mankind against an amiable child . It was considered very pleasant reading , but I never read more of it myself than the sentence on which I chanced to light on opening the book . It was this : "
409864	410115	409639	409640	Little Coavinses	687	" And now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly indeed , and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred . Whatever little lingerings may have now and then revived in my mind associated with my poor old face had only revived as belonging to a part of my life that was gone - gone like my infancy or my childhood . I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that subject , but have written them as faithfully as my memory has recalled them . And I hope to do , and mean to do , the same down to the last words of these pages , which I see now not so very far before me . The months were gliding away , and my dear girl , sustained by the hopes she had confided in me , was the same beautiful star in the miserable corner . Richard , more worn and haggard , haunted the court day after day , listlessly sat there the whole day long when he knew there was no remote chance of the suit being mentioned , and became one of the stock sights of the place . I wonder whether any of the gentlemen remembered him as he was when he first went there . So completely was he absorbed in his fixed idea that he used to avow in his cheerful moments that he should never have breathed the fresh air now "
410120	410699	410118	410118	Woodcourt	448	" It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could occasionally divert his attention for a few hours at a time and rouse him , even when he sunk into a lethargy of mind and body that alarmed us greatly , and the returns of which became more frequent as the months went on . My dear girl was right in saying that he only pursued his errors the more desperately for her sake . I have no doubt that his desire to retrieve what he had lost was rendered the more intense by his grief for his young wife , and became like the madness of a gamester . I was there , as I have mentioned , at all hours . When I was there at night , I generally went home with Charley in a coach ; sometimes my guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood , and we would walk home together . One evening he had arranged to meet me at eight o'clock . I could not leave , as I usually did , quite punctually at the time , for I was working for my dear girl and had a few stitches more to do to finish what I was about ; but it was within a few minutes of the hour when I bundled up my little work - basket , gave my darling my last kiss for the night , and hurried downstairs . Mr. Woodcourt went with me , as it was dusk . When we came to the usual place of meeting - it was close by , and Mr. Woodcourt had often accompanied me before - my guardian was not there . We waited half an hour , walking up and down , but there were no signs of him . We agreed that he was either prevented from coming or that he had come and gone away , and Mr. Woodcourt proposed to walk home with me . It was the first walk we had ever taken together , except that very short one to the usual place of meeting . We spoke of Richard and Ada the whole way . I did not thank him in words for what he had done - my appreciation of it had risen above all words then - but I hoped he might not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly . Arriving at home and going upstairs , we found that my guardian was out and that Mrs. Woodcourt was out too . We were in the very same room into which I had brought my blushing girl when her youthful lover , now her so altered husband , was the choice of her young heart , the very same room from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of their hope and promise . We were standing by the opened window looking down into the street when Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me . I learned in a moment that he loved me . I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to him . I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and compassion was devoted , generous , faithful love . Oh , too late to know it now , too late , too late . That was the first ungrateful thought I had . Too late . "
410704	410709	410701	410701	I	0	" he told me , "

410760	410765	410753	410754	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" I entreated him . "

410928	411039	411040	411040	I	0	" I said it with a stronger heart , for when he praised me thus and when I heard his voice thrill with his belief that what he said was true , I aspired to be more worthy of it . It was not too late for that . Although I closed this unforeseen page in my life to - night , I could be worthier of it all through my life . And it was a comfort to me , and an impulse to me , and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him when I thought so . He broke the silence . "
411063	411083	411087	411087	her	9203	" - and the deep earnestness with which he said it at once strengthened me and made me weep - "
411191	411244	411186	411186	I	0	" Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he thought me , and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained ! I wished to help him in his trouble , as I had wished to do when he showed that first commiseration for me . "
411249	411253	411186	411186	I	0	" said I , "
411284	411306	411278	411278	I	0	" I had to think again of being more deserving of his love and his affliction before I could go on . "
411403	411427	411455	411455	you	448	" He covered his eyes with his hand and turned away his head . How could I ever be worthy of those tears ? "
411532	411554	411555	411555	I	0	" He took my hand and kissed it . He was like himself again , and I felt still more encouraged . "

412075	412452	411984	411984	I	0	" He left me , and I stood at the dark window watching the street . His love , in all its constancy and generosity , had come so suddenly upon me that he had not left me a minute when my fortitude gave way again and the street was blotted out by my rushing tears . But they were not tears of regret and sorrow . No . He had called me the beloved of his life and had said I would be evermore as dear to him as I was then , and I felt as if my heart would not hold the triumph of having heard those words . My first wild thought had died away . It was not too late to hear them , for it was not too late to be animated by them to be good , true , grateful , and contented . How easy my path , how much easier than his ! CHAPTER LXII Another Discovery I had not the courage to see any one that night . I had not even the courage to see myself , for I was afraid that my tears might a little reproach me . I went up to my room in the dark , and prayed in the dark , and lay down in the dark to sleep . I had no need of any light to read my guardian 's letter by , for I knew it by heart . I took it from the place where I kept it , and repeated its contents by its own clear light of integrity and love , and went to sleep with it on my pillow . I was up very early in the morning and called Charley to come for a walk . We bought flowers for the breakfast - table , and came back and arranged them , and were as busy as possible . We were so early that I had a good time still for Charley 's lesson before breakfast ; Charley who was not in the least improved in the old defective article of grammar came through it with great applause ; and we were altogether very notable . When my guardian appeared he said , "
412465	412561	412455	412456	little woman	1937	" And Mrs. Woodcourt repeated and translated a passage from the Mewlinnwillinwodd expressive of my being like a mountain with the sun upon it . This was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the mountain than I had been before . After breakfast I waited my opportunity and peeped about a little until I saw my guardian in his own room - the room of last night - by himself . Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys , shutting the door after me . "
412567	412585	412586	412586	You	351	" said my guardian ; the post had brought him several letters , and he was writing . "

412692	412714	412715	412715	He	9210	" said my guardian , musing as he smiled upon me , ' such a Dame Durden for making money last . "

412995	413001	413002	413002	He	10304	" but its mistress remained . "

As so much time has passed , and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again , perhaps you expect me to renew the subject . Perhaps I ought to do so . I will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please . "
413098	413101	413102	413102	he	10304	" See , "
413106	413159	413102	413102	he	10304	" what a sympathy there must be between us ! I have had nothing else , poor Rick excepted - it 's a large exception - in my mind . When you came in , I was full of it . When shall we give Bleak House its mistress , little woman ? "

413293	413300	413302	413302	he	10304	" Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson , "
413309	413367	413369	413370	Mr. Bucket	665	" with all apologies for intruding , WILL you allow me to order up a person that 's on the stairs and that objects to being left there in case of becoming the subject of observations in his absence ? Thank you . Be so good as chair that there member in this direction , will you ? "
413431	413439	413440	413440	he	665	" Now you see , Mr. Jarndyce , "
413462	413519	413521	413522	Mr. Bucket	665	" you know me , and Miss Summerson knows me . This gentleman likewise knows me , and his name is Smallweed . The discounting line is his line principally , and he 's what you may call a dealer in bills . That 's about what YOU are , you know , ai n't you ? "
413561	413569	413571	413572	Mr. Bucket	665	" Now , moral , you know ! "

I 've been negotiating with this gentleman on behalf of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and one way and another I 've been in and out and about his premises a deal . His premises are the premises formerly occupied by Krook , marine store dealer - a relation of this gentleman 's that you saw in his lifetime if I do n't mistake ? "
413682	413685	413571	413572	Mr. Bucket	665	" Yes . "
413686	413694	413696	413697	Mr. Bucket	665	" Well ! You are to understand , "
413699	413740	413696	413697	Mr. Bucket	665	" that this gentleman he come into Krook 's property , and a good deal of magpie property there was . Vast lots of waste - paper among the rest . Lord bless you , of no use to nobody ! "
413831	413860	413862	413863	Mr. Bucket	665	" Among them odd heaps of old papers , this gentleman , when he comes into the property , naturally begins to rummage , do n't you see ? "
413865	413873	413875	413876	Mr. Smallweed	490	" To which ? Say that again , "
413884	413888	413890	413891	Mr. Bucket	665	" To rummage , "
413893	413925	413890	413891	Mr. Bucket	665	" Being a prudent man and accustomed to take care of your own affairs , you begin to rummage among the papers as you have come into ; do n't you ? "
413926	413932	413934	413935	Mr. Smallweed	490	" Of course I do , "
413937	413943	413945	413946	Mr. Bucket	665	" Of course you do , "
413949	413972	413945	413946	Mr. Bucket	665	" and much to blame you would be if you did n't . And so you chance to find , you know , "
413995	414020	413988	413989	Mr. Smallweed	490	" and so you chance to find , you know , a paper with the signature of Jarndyce to it . Do n't you ? "
414035	414092	414094	414095	Mr. Bucket	665	" And coming to look at that paper at your full leisure and convenience - all in good time , for you 're not curious to read it , and why should you be ? - what do you find it to be but a will , you see . That 's the drollery of it , "
414128	414140	414094	414095	Mr. Bucket	665	" what do you find it to be but a will ? "
414141	414158	414160	414161	Mr. Smallweed	490	" I do n't know that it 's good as a will or as anything else , "
414223	414227	414229	414230	Mr. Bucket	665	" Notwithstanding which , "
414232	414255	414229	414230	Mr. Bucket	665	" you get a little doubtful and uncomfortable in your mind about it , having a very tender mind of your own . "
414256	414270	414275	414275	his	490	" Eh ? What do you say I have got of my own ? "
414281	414287	414272	414273	Mr. Smallweed	490	" A very tender mind . "
414288	414296	414298	414299	Mr. Smallweed	490	" Ho ! Well , go on , "
414301	414407	414298	414299	Mr. Smallweed	490	" And as you 've heard a good deal mentioned regarding a celebrated Chancery will case of the same name , and as you know what a card Krook was for buying all manner of old pieces of furniter , and books , and papers , and what not , and never liking to part with 'em , and always a - going to teach himself to read , you begin to think - and you never was more correct in your born days - ' Ecod , if I do n't look about me , I may get into trouble regarding this will . ' "
414408	414419	414421	414423	the old man	1212	" Now , mind how you put it , Bucket , "
414432	414462	414426	414426	his	1212	" Speak up ; none of your brimstone tricks . Pick me up ; I want to hear better . Oh , Lord , I am shaken to bits ! "
414493	414525	414479	414479	he	1212	" Oh , my bones ! Oh , dear ! I 've no breath in my body ! I 'm worse than the chattering , clattering , brimstone pig at home ! "
414537	414565	414526	414527	Mr. Bucket	665	" So , as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises , you take me into your confidence , do n't you ? "
414627	414675	414677	414678	Mr. Bucket	665	" And I go into the business with you - very pleasant we are over it ; and I confirm you in your well - founded fears that you will get yourself into a most precious line if you do n't come out with that there will , "
414681	414732	414677	414678	Mr. Bucket	665	" and accordingly you arrange with me that it shall be delivered up to this present Mr. Jarndyce , on no conditions . If it should prove to be valuable , you trusting yourself to him for your reward ; that 's about where it is , ai n't it ? "
414733	414740	414741	414742	Mr. Smallweed	490	" That 's what was agreed , "
414750	414756	414758	414759	Mr. Bucket	665	" In consequence of which , "
414775	414806	414758	414759	Mr. Bucket	665	" you 've got that will upon your person at the present time , and the only thing that remains for you to do is just to out with it ! "
414990	415089	414984	414984	he	665	" Had n't settled how to make their market of it . Quarrelled and hinted about it . I laid out twenty pound upon it . First the avaricious grandchildren split upon him on account of their objections to his living so unreasonably long , and then they split on one another . Lord ! There ai n't one of the family that would n't sell the other for a pound or two , except the old lady - and she 's only out of it because she 's too weak in her mind to drive a bargain . "
415090	415094	415096	415097	my guardian	10304	" Mr Bucket , "
415100	415139	415096	415097	my guardian	10304	" whatever the worth of this paper may be to any one , my obligations are great to you ; and if it be of any worth , I hold myself bound to see Mr. Smallweed remunerated accordingly . "
415140	415150	415152	415153	Mr. Bucket	665	" Not according to your merits , you know , "
415161	415175	415096	415097	my guardian	10304	" Do n't you be afraid of that . According to its value . "
415176	415183	415185	415186	my guardian	10304	" That is what I mean , "
415188	415265	415185	415186	my guardian	10304	" You may observe , Mr. Bucket , that I abstain from examining this paper myself . The plain truth is , I have forsworn and abjured the whole business these many years , and my soul is sick of it . But Miss Summerson and I will immediately place the paper in the hands of my solicitor in the cause , and its existence shall be made known without delay to all other parties interested . "
415266	415279	415281	415282	Mr. Bucket	665	" Mr. Jarndyce ca n't say fairer than that , you understand , "
415289	415330	415331	415331	He	665	" And it being now made clear to you that nobody 's a - going to be wronged - which must be a great relief to YOUR mind - we may proceed with the ceremony of chairing you home again . "
415460	415464	415466	415467	Mr. Kenge	286	" I hope , "
415469	415478	415479	415479	he	286	" that the genial influence of Miss Summerson , "
415484	415491	415492	415492	he	286	" may have induced Mr. Jarndyce , "
415497	415534	415492	415492	he	286	" to forego some little of his animosity towards a cause and towards a court which are - shall I say , which take their place in the stately vista of the pillars of our profession ? "
415535	415542	415544	415545	my guardian	10304	" I am inclined to think , "
415547	415615	415616	415616	He	286	" that Miss Summerson has seen too much of the effects of the court and the cause to exert any influence in their favour . Nevertheless , they are a part of the occasion of my being here . Mr. Kenge , before I lay this paper on your desk and have done with it , let me tell you how it has come into my hands . "
415623	415630	415632	415633	Mr. Kenge	286	" It could not , sir , "
415635	415654	415632	415633	Mr. Kenge	286	" have been stated more plainly and to the purpose if it had been a case at law . "
415655	415673	415675	415676	my guardian	10304	" Did you ever know English law , or equity either , plain and to the purpose ? "
415678	415683	415685	415686	Mr. Kenge	286	" Oh , fie ! "
415733	415737	415738	415738	he	286	" Mr. Jarndyce , "
415745	415751	415738	415738	he	286	" you have perused this ? "
415752	415756	415758	415759	my guardian	10304	" Not I ! "
415761	415768	415770	415771	Mr. Kenge	286	" But , my dear sir , "
415773	415840	415770	415771	Mr. Kenge	286	" it is a will of later date than any in the suit . It appears to be all in the testator 's handwriting . It is duly executed and attested . And even if intended to be cancelled , as might possibly be supposed to be denoted by these marks of fire , it is NOT cancelled . Here it is , a perfect instrument ! "
415841	415844	415846	415847	my guardian	10304	" Well ! "
415849	415856	415867	415867	his	286	" What is that to me ? "
415857	415861	415867	415867	his	286	" Mr. Guppy ! "
415870	415879	415867	415867	his	286	" I beg your pardon , Mr. Jarndyce . "
415880	415883	415867	415867	his	286	" Sir . "
415884	415905	415906	415907	Mr. Guppy	301	" Mr. Vholes of Symond 's Inn . My compliments . Jarndyce and Jarndyce . Glad to speak with him . "
415910	415958	415960	415961	Mr. Kenge	286	" You ask me what is this to you , Mr. Jarndyce . If you had perused this document , you would have seen that it reduces your interest considerably , though still leaving it a very handsome one , still leaving it a very handsome one , "
415970	416001	415964	415964	his	286	" You would further have seen that the interests of Mr. Richard Carstone and of Miss Ada Clare , now Mrs. Richard Carstone , are very materially advanced by it . "
416002	416005	416007	416008	my guardian	10304	" Kenge , "
416010	416058	416007	416008	my guardian	10304	" if all the flourishing wealth that the suit brought into this vile court of Chancery could fall to my two young cousins , I should be well contented . But do you ask ME to believe that any good is to come of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ? "
416059	416106	416107	416108	My guardian	10304	" Oh , really , Mr. Jarndyce ! Prejudice , prejudice . My dear sir , this is a very great country , a very great country . Its system of equity is a very great system , a very great system . Really , really ! "
416129	416157	416118	416118	He	248	" How do you do , Mr. Vholes ? Willl you be so good as to take a chair here by me and look over this paper ? "
416282	416286	416258	416258	he	286	" Receiver- General , "
416287	416292	416258	416258	he	286	" Accountant - General , "

416323	416337	416339	416340	Mr. Kenge	286	" Well ! But this is a very remarkable document , Mr. Vholes , "
416346	416351	416342	416343	Mr. Vholes	248	" Very much so . "
416352	416362	416364	416365	Mr. Kenge	286	" And a very important document , Mr. Vholes , "
416372	416377	416368	416369	Mr. Vholes	248	" Very much so . "
416378	416409	416411	416412	Mr. Kenge	286	" And as you say , Mr. Vholes , when the cause is in the paper next term , this document will be an unexpected and interesting feature in it , "
416448	416452	416454	416455	my guardian	10304	" And when , "
416478	416484	416471	416472	Mr. Vholes	248	" when is next term ? "
416485	416497	416499	416500	Mr. Kenge	286	" Next term , Mr. Jarndyce , will be next month , "
416502	416544	416499	416500	Mr. Kenge	286	" Of course we shall at once proceed to do what is necessary with this document and to collect the necessary evidence concerning it ; and of course you will receive our usual notification of the cause being in the paper . "
416545	416559	416471	416472	Mr. Vholes	248	" To which I shall pay , of course , my usual attention . "
416560	416568	416570	416571	Mr. Kenge	286	" Still bent , my dear sir , "
416657	416922	416925	416925	master	1524	" He said this at the stair - head , gently moving his right hand as if it were a silver trowel with which to spread the cement of his words on the structure of the system and consolidate it for a thousand ages . CHAPTER LXIII Steel and Iron George 's Shooting Gallery is to let , and the stock is sold off , and George himself is at Chesney Wold attending on Sir Leicester in his rides and riding very near his bridle - rein because of the uncertain hand with which he guides his horse . But not to - day is George so occupied . He is journeying to - day into the iron country farther north to look about him . As he comes into the iron country farther north , such fresh green woods as those of Chesney Wold are left behind ; and coal pits and ashes , high chimneys and red bricks , blighted verdure , scorching fires , and a heavy never - lightening cloud of smoke become the features of the scenery . Among such objects rides the trooper , looking about him and always looking for something he has come to find . At last , on the black canal bridge of a busy town , with a clang of iron in it , and more fires and more smoke than he has seen yet , the trooper , swart with the dust of the coal roads , checks his horse and asks a workman does he know the name of Rouncewell thereabouts . "
416927	416932	417009	417009	Rouncewell	336	" quoth the workman , "
416940	416941	416936	416936	my	0	" "
416954	416959	416960	416960	Rouncewell	336	" asks the trooper . "
416969	416970	416965	416965	You	12527	" "
416978	416988	416965	416965	You	12527	" asks the trooper with a glance before him . "
416999	417006	416965	416965	You	12527	" the workman wants to know . "
417016	417025	417009	417009	Rouncewell	336	" mutters the trooper , stroking his chin , "
417063	417064	417060	417060	you	12527	" "
417104	417418	417098	417098	his	334	" And which is the factory ? Why , he sees those chimneys - the tallest ones ! Yes , he sees THEM . Well ! Let him keep his eye on those chimneys , going on as straight as ever he can , and presently he 'll see 'em down a turning on the left , shut in by a great brick wall which forms one side of the street . That 's Rouncewell 's . The trooper thanks his informant and rides slowly on , looking about him . He does not turn back , but puts up his horse and is much disposed to groom him too at a public - house where some of Rouncewell 's hands are dining , as the ostler tells him . Some of Rouncewell 's hands have just knocked off for dinner - time and seem to be invading the whole town . They are very sinewy and strong , are Rouncewell 's hands - a little sooty too . He comes to a gateway in the brick wall , looks in , and sees a great perplexity of iron lying about in every stage and in a vast variety of shapes - in bars , in wedges , in sheets ; in tanks , in boilers , in axles , in wheels , in cogs , in cranks , in rails ; twisted and wrenched into eccentric and perverse forms as separate parts of machinery ; mountains of it broken up , and rusty in its age ; distant furnaces of it glowing and bubbling in its youth ; bright fireworks of it showering about under the blows of the steam - hammer ; red - hot iron , white - hot iron , cold - black iron ; an iron taste , an iron smell , and a Babel of iron sounds . "
417432	417446	417098	417098	his	334	" says the trooper , looking about him for a counting - house . "

417579	417618	417520	417520	I	0	" thinks the trooper as he follows . They come to a building in the yard with an office on an upper floor . At sight of the gentleman in the office , Mr. George turns very red . "
417628	417646	417622	417622	I	0	" asks the young man . George , full of the idea of iron , in desperation answers "
417649	417773	417622	417622	I	0	" and is so presented . He is left alone with the gentleman in the office , who sits at a table with account - books before him and some sheets of paper blotted with hosts of figures and drawings of cunning shapes . It is a bare office , with bare windows , looking on the iron view below . Tumbled together on the table are some pieces of iron , purposely broken to be tested at various periods of their service , in various capacities . There is iron - dust on everything ; and the smoke is seen through the windows rolling heavily out of the tall chimneys to mingle with the smoke from a vaporous Babylon of other chimneys . "
417783	417796	417780	417781	Mr. Steel	690	" says the gentleman when his visitor has taken a rusty chair . "
417802	417832	417799	417800	Mr. Rouncewell	334	" George replies , leaning forward with his left arm on his knee and his hat in his hand , and very chary of meeting his brother 's eye , "
417917	417918	417890	417890	I	0	" "
417924	417933	417920	417920	you	9281	" returns the ironmaster in an altered voice , "
417940	417967	417920	417920	you	9281	" The trooper falters and looks at him . His brother starts up , calls him by his name , and grasps him by both hands . "
417975	417988	417920	417920	you	9281	" cries the trooper with the tears springing out of his eyes . "
418033	418051	418030	418030	you	9281	" They shake hands and embrace each other over and over again , the trooper still coupling his "
418062	418085	418054	418054	you	9281	" with his protestation that he never thought his brother would have been half so glad to see him as all this ! "
418091	418109	418110	418110	I	0	" he declares at the end of a full account of what has preceded his arrival there , "
418170	418171	418172	418172	We	9288	" "
418188	418193	418186	418186	George	515	" returns his brother . "
418292	418623	418624	418624	Brother	15916	" Mr. George is so entirely overcome at first by this prospect that he resists the proposed honour with great earnestness . Being overborne , however , by his brother and his nephew - concerning whom he renews his protestations that he never could have thought they would have been half so glad to see him - he is taken home to an elegant house in all the arrangements of which there is to be observed a pleasant mixture of the originally simple habits of the father and mother with such as are suited to their altered station and the higher fortunes of their children . Here Mr. George is much dismayed by the graces and accomplishments of his nieces that are and by the beauty of Rosa , his niece that is to be , and by the affectionate salutations of these young ladies , which he receives in a sort of dream . He is sorely taken aback , too , by the dutiful behaviour of his nephew and has a woeful consciousness upon him of being a scapegrace . However , there is great rejoicing and a very hearty company and infinite enjoyment , and Mr. George comes bluff and martial through it all , and his pledge to be present at the marriage and give away the bride is received with universal favour . A whirling head has Mr. George that night when he lies down in the state - bed of his brother 's house to think of all these things and to see the images of his nieces awful all the evening in their floating muslins waltzing , after the German manner , over his counterpane . The brothers are closeted next morning in the ironmaster 's room , where the elder is proceeding , in his clear sensible way , to show how he thinks he may best dispose of George in his business , when George squeezes his hand and stops him .

419177	419178	419158	419158	you	515	" "

419241	419264	419266	419266	I	0	" says the trooper with a heave of his chest as he unfolds his arms and puts a hand on each leg , "
419277	419314	419266	419266	I	0	" The brothers are very like each other , sitting face to face ; but a certain massive simplicity and absence of usage in the ways of the world is all on the trooper 's side . "
419317	419326	419266	419266	I	0	" he proceeds , throwing off his disappointment , "
419387	419397	419380	419380	I	0	" shaking him a long time by the hand . "

419436	419452	419432	419432	My	0	" returns the elder , concentrating his strong steady brow upon him and smiling confidently , "
419463	419469	419460	419460	me	0	" George shakes his head . "
419554	419555	419560	419560	George	515	" "
419562	419576	419560	419560	George	515	" returns the other with a very slight shade upon his open face , "
419590	419591	419560	419560	George	515	" "
419598	419614	419596	419596	brother	15916	" cries the trooper , checking him , with his hand upon his knee again ; "
419825	419826	419827	419827	You	9336	" "
419833	419846	419829	419829	yourself	9336	" says the elder brother , returning the grip of his hand , "
419877	419878	419874	419874	your	9336	" "
419884	419889	419874	419874	your	9336	" returns the trooper . "
419980	420317	419970	419970	I	0	" Herewith he hands a letter , closely written in somewhat pale ink but in a neat round hand , to the ironmaster , who reads as follows : Miss Esther Summerson , A communication having been made to me by Inspector Bucket of a letter to myself being found among the papers of a certain person , I take the liberty to make known to you that it was but a few lines of instruction from abroad , when , where , and how to deliver an enclosed letter to a young and beautiful lady , then unmarried , in England . I duly observed the same . I further take the liberty to make known to you that it was got from me as a proof of handwriting only and that otherwise I would not have given it up , as appearing to be the most harmless in my possession , without being previously shot through the heart . I further take the liberty to mention that if I could have supposed a certain unfortunate gentleman to have been in existence , I never could and never would have rested until I had discovered his retreat and shared my last farthing with him , as my duty and my inclination would have equally been . But he was officially reported drowned , and assuredly went over the side of a transport- ship at night in an Irish harbour within a few hours of her arrival from the West Indies , as I have myself heard both from officers and men on board , and know to have been officially confirmed . I further take the liberty to state that in my humble quality as one of the rank and file , I am , and shall ever continue to be , your thoroughly devoted and admiring servant and that I esteem the qualities you possess above all others far beyond the limits of the present dispatch . I have the honour to be , GEORGE "
420322	420335	419970	419970	I	0	" observes the elder brother , refolding it with a puzzled face . "
420349	420354	419970	419970	I	0	" asks the younger . "
420359	420581	419970	419970	I	0	" Therefore it is sealed and deposited for posting among the iron correspondence of the day . This done , Mr. George takes a hearty farewell of the family party and prepares to saddle and mount . His brother , however , unwilling to part with him so soon , proposes to ride with him in a light open carriage to the place where he will bait for the night , and there remain with him until morning , a servant riding for so much of the journey on the thoroughbred old grey from Chesney Wold . The offer , being gladly accepted , is followed by a pleasant ride , a pleasant dinner , and a pleasant breakfast , all in brotherly communion . Then they once more shake hands long and heartily and part , the ironmaster turning his face to the smoke and fires , and the trooper to the green country . Early in the afternoon the subdued sound of his heavy military trot is heard on the turf in the avenue as he rides on with imaginary clank and jingle of accoutrements under the old elm - trees . CHAPTER LXIV Esther 's Narrative Soon after I had that convertion with my guardian , he put a sealed paper in my hand one morning and said , "
420591	420709	419970	419970	I	0	" I found in it two hundred pounds . I now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were necessary . Regulating my purchases by my guardian 's taste , which I knew very well of course , I arranged my wardrobe to please him and hoped I should be highly successful . I did it all so quietly because I was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be rather sorry and because my guardian was so quiet himself . I had no doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the most private and simple manner . Perhaps I should only have to say to Ada , "
420726	421488	420711	420711	you	9343	" Perhaps our wedding might even be as unpretending as her own , and I might not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was over . I thought that if I were to choose , I would like this best . The only exception I made was Mrs. Woodcourt . I told her that I was going to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some time . She highly approved . She could never do enough for me and was remarkably softened now in comparison with what she had been when we first knew her . There was no trouble she would not have taken to have been of use to me , but I need hardly say that I only allowed her to take as little as gratified her kindness without tasking it . Of course this was not a time to neglect my guardian , and of course it was not a time for neglecting my darling . So I had plenty of occupation , which I was glad of ; and as to Charley , she was absolutely not to be seen for needlework . To surround herself with great heaps of it - baskets full and tables full - and do a little , and spend a great deal of time in staring with her round eyes at what there was to do , and persuade herself that she was going to do it , were Charley 's great dignities and delights . Meanwhile , I must say , I could not agree with my guardian on the subject of the will , and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and Jarndyce . Which of us was right will soon appear , but I certainly did encourage expectations . In Richard , the discovery gave occasion for a burst of business and agitation that buoyed him up for a little time , but he had lost the elasticity even of hope now and seemed to me to retain only its feverish anxieties . From something my guardian said one day when we were talking about this , I understood that my marriage would not take place until after the term - time we had been told to look forward to ; and I thought the more , for that , how rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were a little more prosperous . The term was very near indeed when my guardian was called out of town and went down into Yorkshire on Mr. Woodcourt 's business . He had told me beforehand that his presence there would be necessary . I had just come in one night from my dear girl 's and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes , looking at them all around me and thinking , when a letter from my guardian was brought to me . It asked me to join him in the country and mentioned by what stage- coach my place was taken and at what time in the morning I should have to leave town . It added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada . I expected few things less than a journey at that time , but I was ready for it in half an hour and set off as appointed early next morning . I travelled all day , wondering all day what I could be wanted for at such a distance ; now I thought it might be for this purpose , and now I thought it might be for that purpose , but I was never , never , never near the truth . It was night when I came to my journey 's end and found my guardian waiting for me . This was a great relief , for towards evening I had begun to fear the more so as his letter was a very short one that he might be ill . However , there he was , as well as it was possible to be ; and when I saw his genial face again at its brightest and best , I said to myself , he has been doing some other great kindness . Not that it required much penetration to say that , because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness . Supper was ready at the hotel , and when we were alone at table he said , "
421508	421509	421512	421512	guardian	1915	" "
421514	421518	421512	421512	guardian	1915	" said I , "
421538	421539	421530	421530	I	0	" "
421551	421556	421530	421530	I	0	" he returned gaily , "
421744	421749	421741	421741	she	9355	" said my guardian , "
421756	421788	421741	421741	she	9355	" Because he was so dear , so good , so admirable . I tried to tell him what I thought of him , but I could not articulate a word . "
421793	421798	421741	421741	she	9355	" said my guardian . "
421822	421823	421815	421816	Dame Durden	351	" "
421839	421840	421815	421816	Dame Durden	351	" "
421845	421849	421815	421816	Dame Durden	351	" said he . "
421877	421886	421887	421887	I	0	" I kissed him and dried my eyes . "
421891	421894	421887	421887	I	0	" said I. "
421906	421907	421895	421895	I	0	" "
421917	421921	421911	421911	you	9356	" said he . "
421933	422085	421923	421925	a Dame Durden	351	" He was so quaintly cheerful that I could not long be otherwise , and was almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all . When I went to bed , I cried . I am bound to confess that I cried ; but I hope it was with pleasure , though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure . I repeated every word of the letter twice over . A most beautiful summer morning succeeded , and after breakfast we went out arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion . We entered a flower - garden by a gate in a side wall , of which he had the key , and the first thing I saw was that the beds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds and flowers at home . "
422092	422108	421923	421925	a Dame Durden	351	" observed my guardian , standing still with a delighted face to watch my looks , "
422121	422485	422117	422117	I	0	" We went on by a pretty little orchard , where the cherries were nestling among the green leaves and the shadows of the apple - trees were sporting on the grass , to the house itself - a cottage , quite a rustic cottage of doll 's rooms ; but such a lovely place , so tranquil and so beautiful , with such a rich and smiling country spread around it ; with water sparkling away into the distance , here all overhung with summer - growth , there turning a humming mill ; at its nearest point glancing through a meadow by the cheerful town , where cricket - players were assembling in bright groups and a flag was flying from a white tent that rippled in the sweet west wind . And still , as we went through the pretty rooms , out at the little rustic verandah doors , and underneath the tiny wooden colonnades garlanded with woodbine , jasmine , and honey - suckle , I saw in the papering on the walls , in the colours of the furniture , in the arrangement of all the pretty objects , MY little tastes and fancies , MY little methods and inventions which they used to laugh at while they praised them , my odd ways everywhere . I could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful , but one secret doubt arose in my mind when I saw this , I thought , oh , would he be the happier for it ! Would it not have been better for his peace that I should not have been so brought before him ? Because although I was not what he thought me , still he loved me very dearly , and it might remind him mournfully of what be believed he had lost . I did not wish him to forget me - perhaps he might not have done so , without these aids to his memory - but my way was easier than his , and I could have reconciled myself even to that so that he had been the happier for it . "
422492	422519	422489	422490	little woman	1937	" said my guardian , whom I had never seen so proud and joyful as in showing me these things and watching my appreciation of them , "
422533	422534	422489	422490	little woman	1937	" "
422543	422544	422545	422546	My child	9613	" "
422548	422552	422545	422546	My child	9613	" said he , "
422557	422580	422545	422546	My child	9613	" He took me to the porch , which he had hitherto avoided , and said , pausing before we went out , "
422592	422593	422587	422587	you	9613	" "
422596	422645	422587	422587	you	9613	" said I. We went out of the porch and he showed me written over it , Bleak House . He led me to a seat among the leaves close by , and sitting down beside me and taking my hand in his , spoke to me thus , "
422684	422692	422693	422693	I	0	" smiling as he referred to it , "
422772	422832	422766	422766	I	0	" I was cold , and I trembled violently , but not a word he uttered was lost . As I sat looking fixedly at him and the sun 's rays descended , softly shining through the leaves upon his bare head , I felt as if the brightness on him must be like the brightness of the angels . "
422887	422904	422874	422874	Woodcourt	448	" I clasped him round the neck and hung my head upon his breast and wept . "
422914	422924	422874	422874	Woodcourt	448	" said he , pressing me gently to him . "
422938	422970	422972	422972	me	0	" Soothingly , like the gentle rustling of the leaves ; and genially , like the ripening weather ; and radiantly and beneficently , like the sunshine , he went on . "
423132	423165	423168	423169	little woman	1937	" He stopped to kiss me on the forehead , and I sobbed and wept afresh . For I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of his praise . "
423191	423196	423184	423184	I	0	" he said exultingly , "
423426	423433	423418	423418	her	9613	" cried my guardian with enthusiasm , "
423460	423500	423516	423516	he	448	" He tenderly raised my head , and as I clung to him , kissed me in his old fatherly way again and again . What a light , now , on the protecting manner I had thought about ! "
423625	423661	423662	423662	Allan	448	" He rose and raised me with him . We were no longer alone . My husband - I have called him by that name full seven happy years now - stood at my side . "
423664	423669	423662	423662	Allan	448	" said my guardian , "
423746	423767	423768	423768	Esther	283	" He kissed me once again , and now the tears were in his eyes as he said more softly , "
423829	423855	423823	423823	Allan	448	" He moved away from under the green roof of leaves , and stopping in the sunlight outside and turning cheerfully towards us , said , "
423911	424175	424189	424190	this hero	9408	" What happiness was ours that day , what joy , what rest , what hope , what gratitude , what bliss ! We were to be married before the month was out , but when we were to come and take possession of our own house was to depend on Richard and Ada . We all three went home together next day . As soon as we arrived in town , Allan went straight to see Richard and to carry our joyful news to him and my darling . Late as it was , I meant to go to her for a few minutes before lying down to sleep , but I went home with my guardian first to make his tea for him and to occupy the old chair by his side , for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon . When we came home we found that a young man had called three times in the course of that one day to see me and that having been told on the occasion of his third call that I was not expected to return before ten o'clock at night , he had left word that he would call about then . He had left his card three times . Mr. Guppy . As I naturally speculated on the object of these visits , and as I always associated something ludicrous with the visitor , it fell out that in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his old proposal and his subsequent retraction . "
424179	424184	424189	424190	this hero	9408	" said my guardian , "
424192	424237	424189	424190	this hero	9408	" So instructions were given that Mr. Guppy should be shown in when he came again , and they were scarcely given when he did come again . He was embarrassed when he found my guardian with me , but recovered himself and said , "
424244	424245	424189	424190	this hero	9408	" "
424253	424258	424248	424248	you	9569	" returned my guardian . "
424268	424273	424260	424260	you	9569	" returned Mr. Guppy . "
424323	424338	424339	424339	Tony	504	" My guardian begged them to be seated , and they all sat down . "
424341	424353	424339	424339	Tony	504	" said Mr. Guppy to his friend after an awkward silence . "
424360	424361	424355	424355	you	504	" "
424366	424373	424364	424364	yourself	504	" returned the friend rather tartly . "
424381	424421	424379	424379	sir	9569	" Mr. Guppy , after a moment 's consideration , began , to the great diversion of his mother , which she displayed by nudging Mr. Jobling with her elbow and winking at me in a most remarkable manner , "
424464	424465	424445	424446	Miss Summerson	283	" "
424469	424476	424466	424467	Miss Summerson	283	" returned my guardian , smiling , "
424487	424488	424466	424467	Miss Summerson	283	" "
424491	424496	424466	424467	Miss Summerson	283	" said Mr. Guppy , "

424586	424591	424583	424584	Mr. Guppy	301	" returned my guardian . "
424610	424627	424628	424628	I	0	" Mr. Guppy therefore desisted from taking something out of his pocket and proceeded without it . "
424648	424682	424635	424636	my mother	2196	" - here Mr. Guppy 's mother rolled her head as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and again winked at me - "
424712	424718	424709	424709	you	9569	" said Mr. Guppy feelingly . "
424723	424728	424709	424709	you	9569	" returned my guardian . "
424734	424739	424729	424729	I	0	" pursued Mr. Guppy , "
424798	424824	424847	424848	my friends	9940	" Here Mr. Guppy 's mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling her head and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her . "
424836	424841	424847	424848	my friends	9940	" said Mr. Guppy , "
424875	424886	424866	424866	Jobling	492	" Mr. Guppy looked at him with a sentimental air , "
424892	424905	424866	424866	Jobling	492	" Mr. Jobling confirmed this with a sliding movement of his legs . "
424927	424932	424908	424908	Jobling	492	" said Mr. Guppy . "
424999	425003	424994	424994	I	0	" Mr. Jobling said "
425005	425019	424994	424994	I	0	" and withdrew a little from the elbow of Mr Guppy 's mother . "

425145	425158	425138	425138	I	0	" My guardian patted me on the shoulder and seemed much amused . "
425163	425168	425161	425161	sir	9569	" said Mr. Guppy , "
425303	425304	425297	425298	Miss Summerson	283	" "
425311	425316	425309	425309	sir	9569	" observed my guardian . "
425321	425328	425319	425319	sir	9569	" replied Mr. Guppy with candour , "
425400	425401	425402	425402	I	0	" "
425409	425421	425402	425402	I	0	" said my guardian , laughing as he rang the bell , "

425457	425466	425433	425433	She	283	" said Mr. Guppy with a blank look . "
425482	425483	425433	425433	She	283	" "
425492	425526	425489	425489	you	9569	" returned my guardian . Mr. Guppy looked incredulously at his friend , and at his mother , who suddenly turned very angry , and at the floor , and at the ceiling . "
425529	425533	425536	425536	Jobling	492	" said he . "
425571	425591	425550	425550	you	492	" But Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the gangway . She would n't hear of it . "
425599	425606	425609	425609	you	492	" said she to my guardian , "

425640	425645	425632	425632	you	492	" returned my guardian , "

425670	425675	425663	425663	I	0	" said Mrs. Guppy . "
425705	425732	425703	425703	'em	9459	" I was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mrs. Guppy 's power of jocularity merged into a power of taking the profoundest offence . "
425745	425750	425737	425737	somebody	843	" repeated Mrs. Guppy . "
425754	425778	425737	425737	somebody	843	" Nothing seemed to astonish Mr. Guppy 's mother so much and to make her so very indignant as our not getting out . "
425786	425791	425737	425737	somebody	843	" said Mrs. Guppy . "
425799	425800	425794	425794	you	492	" "
425803	425826	425801	425801	Mother	11737	" interposed her son , always getting before her and pushing her back with one shoulder as she sidled at my guardian , "
425833	425834	425828	425828	you	492	" "
425839	425843	425837	425837	William	301	" she returned , "
425858	426146	425854	425854	I	0	" However , Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy 's mother who began to be quite abusive and took her , very much against her will , downstairs , her voice rising a stair higher every time her figure got a stair lower , and insisting that we should immediately go and find somebody who was good enough for us , and above all things that we should get out . CHAPTER LXV Beginning the World The term had commenced , and my guardian found an intimation from Mr. Kenge that the cause would come on in two days . As I had sufficient hopes of the will to be in a flutter about it , Allan and I agreed to go down to the court that morning . Richard was extremely agitated and was so weak and low , though his illness was still of the mind , that my dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported . But she looked forward - a very little way now - to the help that was to come to her , and never drooped . It was at Westminster that the cause was to come on . It had come on there , I dare say , a hundred times before , but I could not divest myself of an idea that it MIGHT lead to some result now . We left home directly after breakfast to be at Westminster Hall in good time and walked down there through the lively streets - so happily and strangely it seemed ! - together . As we were going along , planning what we should do for Richard and Ada , I heard somebody calling "
426155	426489	426153	426153	Esther	283	" And there was Caddy Jellyby , with her head out of the window of a little carriage which she hired now to go about in to her pupils she had so many , as if she wanted to embrace me at a hundred yards ' distance . I had written her a note to tell her of all that my guardian had done , but had not had a moment to go and see her . Of course we turned back , and the affectionate girl was in that state of rapture , and was so overjoyed to talk about the night when she brought me the flowers , and was so determined to squeeze my face bonnet and all between her hands , and go on in a wild manner altogether , calling me all kinds of precious names , and telling Allan I had done I do n't know what for her , that I was just obliged to get into the little carriage and calm her down by letting her say and do exactly what she liked . Allan , standing at the window , was as pleased as Caddy ; and I was as pleased as either of them ; and I wonder that I got away as I did , rather than that I came off laughing , and red , and anything but tidy , and looking after Caddy , who looked after us out of the coach - window as long as she could see us . This made us some quarter of an hour late , and when we came to Westminster Hall we found that the day 's business was begun . Worse than that , we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery that it was full to the door , and we could neither see nor hear what was passing within . It appeared to be something droll , for occasionally there was a laugh and a cry of "
426492	426953	426153	426153	Esther	283	" It appeared to be something interesting , for every one was pushing and striving to get nearer . It appeared to be something that made the professional gentlemen very merry , for there were several young counsellors in wigs and whiskers on the outside of the crowd , and when one of them told the others about it , they put their hands in their pockets , and quite doubled themselves up with laughter , and went stamping about the pavement of the Hall . We asked a gentleman by us if he knew what cause was on . He told us Jarndyce and Jarndyce . We asked him if he knew what was doing in it . He said really , no he did not , nobody ever did , but as well as he could make out , it was over . Over for the day ? we asked him . No , he said , over for good . Over for good ! When we heard this unaccountable answer , we looked at one another quite lost in amazement . Could it be possible that the will had set things right at last and that Richard and Ada were going to be rich ? It seemed too good to be true . Alas it was ! Our suspense was short , for a break - up soon took place in the crowd , and the people came streaming out looking flushed and hot and bringing a quantity of bad air with them . Still they were all exceedingly amused and were more like people coming out from a farce or a juggler than from a court of justice . We stood aside , watching for any countenance we knew , and presently great bundles of paper began to be carried out - bundles in bags , bundles too large to be got into any bags , immense masses of papers of all shapes and no shapes , which the bearers staggered under , and threw down for the time being , anyhow , on the Hall pavement , while they went back to bring out more . Even these clerks were laughing . We glanced at the papers , and seeing Jarndyce and Jarndyce everywhere , asked an official - looking person who was standing in the midst of them whether the cause was over . Yes , he said , it was all up with it at last , and burst out laughing too . At this juncture we perceived Mr. Kenge coming out of court with an affable dignity upon him , listening to Mr. Vholes , who was deferential and carried his own bag . Mr. Vholes was the first to see us . "
426961	426965	426956	426957	Miss Summerson	283	" he said . "
426970	426971	426967	426968	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" "
426980	426994	426997	426997	you	9569	" said Mr. Kenge , raising his hat to me with polished politeness . "
427011	427023	427005	427006	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" No . He never came there , I reminded him . "
427026	427031	427005	427006	Mr. Jarndyce	288	" returned Mr. Kenge , "
427082	427083	427049	427049	I	0	" "
427093	427097	427098	427098	I	0	" asked Allan . "
427103	427111	427098	427098	I	0	" said Mr. Kenge with excessive urbanity . "
427120	427121	427098	427098	I	0	" "
427127	427132	427098	427098	I	0	" repeated Mr. Kenge . "

427183	427187	427189	427189	you	9569	" said Allan . "
427194	427195	427189	427189	you	9569	" "
427203	427208	427189	427189	you	9569	" said Mr. Kenge ; "
427224	427225	427217	427217	we	9466	" "
427233	427247	427226	427226	We	9466	" repeated Mr. Vholes as if his low inward voice were an echo . "
427256	427269	427248	427248	You	0	" observed Mr. Kenge , using his silver trowel persuasively and smoothingly , "
427310	427311	427355	427356	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" "
427322	427326	427355	427356	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" said Allan . "
427333	427345	427331	427331	sir	9569	" returned Mr. Kenge with a certain condeseending laugh he had . "
427358	427365	427355	427356	Mr. Woodcourt	448	" becoming dignified almost to severity , "
427484	427485	427486	427487	Mr. Kenge	286	" "
427489	427500	427486	427487	Mr. Kenge	286	" said Allan , appearing enlightened all in a moment . "
427524	427525	427526	427526	Hem	538	" "
427532	427537	427528	427528	I	0	" returned Mr. Kenge . "
427546	427547	427543	427543	YOU	248	" "
427552	427557	427543	427543	YOU	248	" said Mr. Vholes . "
427568	427569	427578	427579	Mr. Vholes	248	" "
427572	427577	427578	427579	Mr. Vholes	248	" returned Mr. Kenge . "
427581	427582	427578	427579	Mr. Vholes	248	" "
427585	427590	427578	427579	Mr. Vholes	248	" said Mr. Vholes . "
427595	427599	427578	427579	Mr. Vholes	248	" whispered Allan , "
427607	427662	427578	427579	Mr. Vholes	248	" There was such a shock of apprehension in his face , and he knew Richard so perfectly , and I too had seen so much of his gradual decay , that what my dear girl had said to me in the fullness of her foreboding love sounded like a knell in my ears . "
427674	427683	427578	427579	Mr. Vholes	248	" said Mr. Vholes , coming after us , "
427711	427790	427708	427709	Miss Summerson	283	" As he gave me that slowly devouring look of his , while twisting up the strings of his bag before he hastened with it after Mr. Kenge , the benignant shadow of whose conversational presence he seemed afraid to leave , he gave one gasp as if he had swallowed the last morsel of his client , and his black buttoned - up unwholesome figure glided away to the low door at the end of the Hall . "
427795	427799	427708	427709	Miss Summerson	283	" said Allan , "
427829	427880	427881	427882	Little woman	1937	" I would not let him take me to a coach , but entreated him to go to Richard without a moment 's delay and leave me to do as he wished . Hurrying home , I found my guardian and told him gradually with what news I had returned . "
427884	427893	427881	427882	Little woman	1937	" said he , quite unmoved for himself , "
427919	428192	428193	428194	Dame Durden	351	" We talked about them all the morning and discussed what it was possible to do . In the afternoon my guardian walked with me to Symond 's Inn and left me at the door . I went upstairs . When my darling heard my footsteps , she came out into the small passage and threw her arms round my neck , but she composed herself directly and said that Richard had asked for me several times . Allan had found him sitting in the corner of the court , she told me , like a stone figure . On being roused , he had broken away and made as if he would have spoken in a fierce voice to the judge . He was stopped by his mouth being full of blood , and Allan had brought him home . He was lying on a sofa with his eyes closed when I went in . There were restoratives on the table ; the room was made as airy as possible , and was darkened , and was very orderly and quiet . Allan stood behind him watching him gravely . His face appeared to me to be quite destitute of colour , and now that I saw him without his seeing me , I fully saw , for the first time , how worn away he was . But he looked handsomer than I had seen him look for many a day . I sat down by his side in silence . Opening his eyes by and by , he said in a weak voice , but with his old smile , "
428202	428343	428193	428194	Dame Durden	351	" It was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him in his low state cheerful and looking forward . He was happier , he said , in our intended marriage than he could find words to tell me . My husband had been a guardian angel to him and Ada , and he blessed us both and wished us all the joy that life could yield us . I almost felt as if my own heart would have broken when I saw him take my husband 's hand and hold it to his breast . We spoke of the future as much as possible , and he said several times that he must be present at our marriage if he could stand upon his feet . Ada would contrive to take him , somehow , he said . "
428351	428463	428193	428194	Dame Durden	351	" But as my darling answered him thus hopefully , so serene and beautiful , with the help that was to come to her so near - I knew - I knew ! It was not good for him to talk too much , and when he was silent , we were silent too . Sitting beside him , I made a pretence of working for my dear , as he had always been used to joke about my being busy . Ada leaned upon his pillow , holding his head upon her arm . He dozed often , and whenever he awoke without seeing him , said first of all , "
428468	428489	428193	428194	Dame Durden	351	" Evening had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian standing in the little hall . "
428497	428532	428494	428495	Dame Durden	351	" Richard asked me . The door was behind him , but he had observed in my face that some one was there . I looked to Allan for advice , and as he nodded "
428535	428565	428494	428495	Dame Durden	351	" bent over Richard and told him . My guardian saw what passed , came softly by me in a moment , and laid his hand on Richard 's . "
428570	428574	428568	428568	sir	9569	" said Richard , "
428587	428620	428623	428623	Rick	319	" and burst into tears for the first time . My guardian , the picture of a good man , sat down in my place , keeping his hand on Richard 's . "
428625	428629	428623	428623	Rick	319	" said he , "
428670	428671	428672	428672	I	0	" "
428694	428695	428687	428687	I	0	" "
428703	428708	428687	428687	I	0	" cried my guardian . "
428720	428728	428709	428709	I	0	" said Richard with a sad smile . "
428758	428759	428753	428753	I	0	" "
428764	428772	428753	428753	I	0	" said my guardian , comforting him ; "
428782	428783	428784	428784	I	0	" "
428790	428794	428784	428784	I	0	" resumed Richard , "
428847	428848	428853	428853	I	0	" "
428860	428865	428858	428858	Rick	319	" said my guardian , "
428898	428919	428920	428920	I	0	" Richard smiled and lifted up his arm to touch him as he stood behind the head of the couch . "
428926	428930	428920	428920	I	0	" said Richard , "
428979	429015	428971	428973	my dear love	9477	" He clasped her in his arms , and none of us spoke . He gradually released her , and she looked upon us , and looked up to heaven , and moved her lips . "
429024	429028	429017	429017	I	0	" said Richard , "
429056	429057	429048	429048	You	0	" "
429063	429064	429060	429061	dear Rick	319	" "
429074	429078	429072	429072	you	0	" said Richard . "
429119	429120	429128	429128	I	0	" "
429164	429204	429161	429162	my love	9686	" he repeated to Ada as he gently passed his hand over her golden hair and put a lock of it to his lips . I think he vowed within himself to cherish her if she were left alone . "
429211	429223	429161	429162	my love	9686	" said Richard , clasping both my guardian 's hands eagerly . "
429232	429233	429161	429162	my love	9686	" "
429264	429265	429235	429235	you	0	" "
429279	429280	429277	429277	Rick	319	" "
429287	429320	429277	429277	Rick	319	" said Richard with a light in his eyes . My husband drew a little nearer towards Ada , and I saw him solemnly lift up his hand to warn my guardian . "
429379	429383	429366	429366	I	0	" said Richard . "
429389	429390	429366	429366	I	0	" "
429400	429405	429406	429406	Ada	294	" returned my guardian . "
429411	429439	429406	429406	Ada	294	" He sought to raise himself a little . Allan raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom , which was what he wanted . "
429496	430505	429480	429480	You	294	" A smile irradiated his face as she bent to kiss him . He slowly laid his face down upon her bosom , drew his arms closer round her neck , and with one parting sob began the world . Not this world , oh , not this ! The world that sets this right . When all was still , at a late hour , poor crazed Miss Flite came weeping to me and told me she had given her birds their liberty . CHAPTER LXVI Down in Lincolnshire There is a hush upon Chesney Wold in these altered days , as there is upon a portion of the family history . The story goes that Sir Leicester paid some who could have spoken out to hold their peace ; but it is a lame story , feebly whispering and creeping about , and any brighter spark of life it shows soon dies away . It is known for certain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the mausoleum in the park , where the trees arch darkly overhead , and the owl is heard at night making the woods ring ; but whence she was brought home to be laid among the echoes of that solitary place , or how she died , is all mystery . Some of her old friends , principally to be found among the peachy - cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats , did once occasionally say , as they toyed in a ghastly manner with large fans - like charmers reduced to flirting with grim death , after losing all their other beaux - did once occasionally say , when the world assembled together , that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks , entombed in the mausoleum , never rose against the profanation of her company . But the dead - and - gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have never been known to object . Up from among the fern in the hollow , and winding by the bridle- road among the trees , comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses ' hoofs . Then may be seen Sir Leicester - invalided , bent , and almost blind , but of worthy presence yet - riding with a stalwart man beside him , constant to his bridle - rein . When they come to a certain spot before the mausoleum - door , Sir Leicester 's accustomed horse stops of his own accord , and Sir Leicester , pulling off his hat , is still for a few moments before they ride away . War rages yet with the audacious Boythorn , though at uncertain intervals , and now hotly , and now coolly , flickering like an unsteady fire . The truth is said to be that when Sir Leicester came down to Lincolnshire for good , Mr. Boythorn showed a manifest desire to abandon his right of way and do whatever Sir Leicester would , which Sir Leicester , conceiving to be a condescension to his illness or misfortune , took in such high dudgeon , and was so magnificently aggrieved by , that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of committing a flagrant trespass to restore his neighbour to himself . Similarly , Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous placards on the disputed thoroughfare and with his bird upon his head to hold forth vehemently against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his own home ; similarly , also , he defies him as of old in the little church by testifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence . But it is whispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old foe , he is really most considerate , and that Sir Leicester , in the dignity of being implacable , little supposes how much he is humoured . As little does he think how near together he and his antagonist have suffered in the fortunes of two sisters , and his antagonist , who knows it now , is not the man to tell him . So the quarrel goes on to the satisfaction of both . In one of the lodges of the park - that lodge within sight of the house where , once upon a time , when the waters were out down in Lincolnshire , my Lady used to see the keeper 's child - the stalwart man , the trooper formerly , is housed . Some relics of his old calling hang upon the walls , and these it is the chosen recreation of a little lame man about the stable - yard to keep gleaming bright . A busy little man he always is , in the polishing at harness - house doors , of stirrup - irons , bits , curb - chains , harness bosses , anything in the way of a stable - yard that will take a polish , leading a life of friction . A shaggy little damaged man , withal , not unlike an old dog of some mongrel breed , who has been considerably knocked about . He answers to the name of Phil . A goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper harder of hearing now going to church on the arm of her son and to observe - which few do , for the house is scant of company in these times - the relations of both towards Sir Leicester , and his towards them . They have visitors in the high summer weather , when a grey cloak and umbrella , unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods , are seen among the leaves ; when two young ladies are occasionally found gambolling in sequestered saw - pits and such nooks of the park ; and when the smoke of two pipes wreathes away into the fragrant evening air from the trooper 's door . Then is a fife heard trolling within the lodge on the inspiring topic of the "
430508	430535	430543	430545	the old girl	4703	" ; and as the evening closes in , a gruff inflexible voice is heard to say , while two men pace together up and down , "
430552	430887	430543	430545	the old girl	4703	" The greater part of the house is shut up , and it is a show - house no longer ; yet Sir Leicester holds his shrunken state in the long drawing - room for all that , and reposes in his old place before my Lady 's picture . Closed in by night with broad screens , and illumined only in that part , the light of the drawing - room seems gradually contracting and dwindling until it shall be no more . A little more , in truth , and it will be all extinguished for Sir Leicester ; and the damp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight , and looks so obdurate , will have opened and received him . Volumnia , growing with the flight of time pinker as to the red in her face , and yellower as to the white , reads to Sir Leicester in the long evenings and is driven to various artifices to conceal her yawns , of which the chief and most efficacious is the insertion of the pearl necklace between her rosy lips . Long - winded treatises on the Buffy and Boodle question , showing how Buffy is immaculate and Boodle villainous , and how the country is lost by being all Boodle and no Buffy , or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle it must be one of the two , and can not be anything else , are the staple of her reading . Sir Leicester is not particular what it is and does not appear to follow it very closely , further than that he always comes broad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off , and sonorously repeating her last words , begs with some displeasure to know if she finds herself fatigued . However , Volumnia , in the course of her bird - like hopping about and pecking at papers , has alighted on a memorandum concerning herself in the event of "
430890	431856	430543	430545	the old girl	4703	" to her kinsman , which is handsome compensation for an extensive course of reading and holds even the dragon Boredom at bay . The cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its dullness , but take to it a little in the shooting season , when guns are heard in the plantations , and a few scattered beaters and keepers wait at the old places of appointment for low - spirited twos and threes of cousins . The debilitated cousin , more debilitated by the dreariness of the place , gets into a fearful state of depression , groaning under penitential sofa - pillows in his gunless hours and protesting that such fernal old jail 's - nough t'sew fler up - frever . The only great occasions for Volumnia in this changed aspect of the place in Lincolnshire are those occasions , rare and widely separated , when something is to be done for the county or the country in the way of gracing a public ball . Then , indeed , does the tuckered sylph come out in fairy form and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the exhausted old assembly - room , fourteen heavy miles off , which , during three hundred and sixty - four days and nights of every ordinary year , is a kind of antipodean lumber- room full of old chairs and tables upside down . Then , indeed , does she captivate all hearts by her condescension , by her girlish vivacity , and by her skipping about as in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of teeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each . Then does she twirl and twine , a pastoral nymph of good family , through the mazes of the dance . Then do the swains appear with tea , with lemonade , with sandwiches , with homage . Then is she kind and cruel , stately and unassuming , various , beautifully wilful . Then is there a singular kind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of another age embellishing that assembly - room , which , with their meagre stems , their spare little drops , their disappointing knobs where no drops are , their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have both departed , and their little feeble prismatic twinkling , all seem Volumnias . For the rest , Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of overgrown house looking out upon trees , sighing , wringing their hands , bowing their heads , and casting their tears upon the window- panes in monotonous depressions . A labyrinth of grandeur , less the property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly likenesses than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which start out of their hundred graves at every sound and go resounding through the building . A waste of unused passages and staircases in which to drop a comb upon a bedroom floor at night is to send a stealthy footfall on an errand through the house . A place where few people care to go about alone , where a maid screams if an ash drops from the fire , takes to crying at all times and seasons , becomes the victim of a low disorder of the spirits , and gives warning and departs . Thus Chesney Wold . With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and vacancy ; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry lowering ; so sombre and motionless always - no flag flying now by day , no rows of lights sparkling by night ; with no family to come and go , no visitors to be the souls of pale cold shapes of rooms , no stir of life about it - passion and pride , even to the stranger 's eye , have died away from the place in Lincolnshire and yielded it to dull repose . CHAPTER LXVII The Close of Esther 's Narrative Full seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House . The few words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned ; then I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever . Not without much dear remembrance on my side . Not without some , I hope , on his or hers . They gave my darling into my arms , and through many weeks I never left her . The little child who was to have done so much was born before the turf was planted on its father 's grave . It was a boy ; and I , my husband , and my guardian gave him his father 's name . The help that my dear counted on did come to her , though it came , in the eternal wisdom , for another purpose . Though to bless and restore his mother , not his father , was the errand of this baby , its power was mighty to do it . When I saw the strength of the weak little hand and how its touch could heal my darling 's heart and raised hope within her , I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of God . They throve , and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country garden and walk there with her infant in her arms . I was married then . I was the happiest of the happy . It was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she would come home . "
431866	431870	431860	431860	your	9524	" said he , "
431899	431903	431908	431908	John	250	" Ada called him "
431910	432807	431908	431908	John	250	" But he said , no , it must be guardian now . He was her guardian henceforth , and the boy 's ; and he had an old association with the name . So she called him guardian , and has called him guardian ever since . The children know him by no other name . I say the children ; I have two little daughters . It is difficult to believe that Charley round - eyed still , and not at all grammatical is married to a miller in our neighbourhood ; yet so it is ; and even now , looking up from my desk as I write early in the morning at my summer window , I see the very mill beginning to go round . I hope the miller will not spoil Charley ; but he is very fond of her , and Charley is rather vain of such a match , for he is well to do and was in great request . So far as my small maid is concerned , I might suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill did half an hour ago , since little Emma , Charley 's sister , is exactly what Charley used to be . As to Tom , Charley 's brother , I am really afraid to say what he did at school in ciphering , but I think it was decimals . He is apprenticed to the miller , whatever it was , and is a good bashful fellow , always falling in love with somebody and being ashamed of it . Caddy Jellyby passed her very last holidays with us and was a dearer creature than ever , perpetually dancing in and out of the house with the children as if she had never given a dancing - lesson in her life . Caddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one , and lives full two miles further westward than Newman Street . She works very hard , her husband an excellent one being lame and able to do very little . Still , she is more than contented and does all she has to do with all her heart . Mr. Jellyby spends his evenings at her new house with his head against the wall as he used to do in her old one . I have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great mortification from her daughter 's ignoble marriage and pursuits , but I hope she got over it in time . She has been disappointed in Borrioboola - Gha , which turned out a failure in consequence of the king of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody - who survived the climate - for rum , but she has taken up with the rights of women to sit in Parliament , and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more correspondence than the old one . I had almost forgotten Caddy 's poor little girl . She is not such a mite now , but she is deaf and dumb . I believe there never was a better mother than Caddy , who learns , in her scanty intervals of leisure , innumerable deaf and dumb arts to soften the affliction of her child . As if I were never to have done with Caddy , I am reminded here of Peepy and old Mr. Turveydrop . Peepy is in the Custom House , and doing extremely well . Old Mr. Turveydrop , very apoplectic , still exhibits his deportment about town , still enjoys himself in the old manner , is still believed in in the old way . He is constant in his patronage of Peepy and is understood to have bequeathed him a favourite French clock in his dressing - room - which is not his property . With the first money we saved at home , we added to our pretty house by throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian , which we inaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see us . I try to write all this lightly , because my heart is full in drawing to an end , but when I write of him , my tears will have their way . I never look at him but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a good man . To Ada and her pretty boy , he is the fondest father ; to me he is what he has ever been , and what name can I give to that ? He is my husband 's best and dearest friend , he is our children 's darling , he is the object of our deepest love and veneration . Yet while I feel towards him as if he were a superior being , I am so familiar with him and so easy with him that I almost wonder at myself . I have never lost my old names , nor has he lost his ; nor do I ever , when he is with us , sit in any other place than in my old chair at his side , Dame Trot , Dame Durden , Little Woman - all just the same as ever ; and I answer , "
432813	433239	431908	431908	John	250	" just the same . I have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment since the day when he took me to the porch to read the name . I remarked to him once that the wind seemed never in the east now , and he said , no , truly ; it had finally departed from that quarter on that very day . I think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever . The sorrow that has been in her face - for it is not there now - seems to have purified even its innocent expression and to have given it a diviner quality . Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that she still wears , teaching my Richard , I feel - it is difficult to express - as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear Esther in her prayers . I call him my Richard ! But he says that he has two mamas , and I am one . We are not rich in the bank , but we have always prospered , and we have quite enough . I never walk out with my husband but I hear the people bless him . I never go into a house of any degree but I hear his praises or see them in grateful eyes . I never lie down at night but I know that in the course of that day he has alleviated pain and soothed some fellow - creature in the time of need . I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery , thanks have often , often gone up , in the last hour , for his patient ministration . Is not this to be rich ? The people even praise me as the doctor 's wife . The people even like me as I go about , and make so much of me that I am quite abashed . I owe it all to him , my love , my pride ! They like me for his sake , as I do everything I do in life for his sake . A night or two ago , after bustling about preparing for my darling and my guardian and little Richard , who are coming to - morrow , I was sitting out in the porch of all places , that dearly memorable porch , when Allan came home . So he said , "
433251	433256	433247	433247	you	9532	" And I said , "
433281	433282	433274	433274	I	0	" "
433293	433298	433285	433285	you	9532	" said Allan then . "
433304	433307	433285	433285	you	9532	" said I. "
433334	433335	433339	433339	you	9532	" "
433349	433353	433339	433339	you	9532	" said Allan . "
433380	433381	433398	433398	they	9536	" "
433389	433395	433398	433398	they	9536	" said Allan , laughing . "
433404	433405	433398	433398	they	9536	" "
433411	433421	433398	433398	they	9536	" said Allan , drawing my arm through his , "
433430	433431	433423	433423	you	9532	" "
433443	433444	433439	433439	me	0	" "
433459	433460	433448	433448	you	9532	" "
