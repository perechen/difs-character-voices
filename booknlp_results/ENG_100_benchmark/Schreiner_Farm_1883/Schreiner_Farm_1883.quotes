26	105	3	7	AN AFRICAN FARM A Novel	192	" We must see the first images which the external world casts upon the dark mirror of his mind ; or must hear the first words which awaken the sleeping powers of thought , and stand by his earliest efforts , if we would understand the prejudices , the habits , and the passions that will rule his life . The entire man is , so to speak , to be found in the cradle of the child . "

Once he was only a little child , then he was a lieutenant , then he was a general , then he was an emperor . When he said a thing to himself he never forgot it . He waited , and waited , and waited , and it came at last . "

6169	6238	6162	6163	her companion	341	" and in the long lonely nights he used to lie awake and think of the things he had done in the old days , and the things he would do if they let him go again . In the day when he walked near the shore it seemed to him that the sea all around him was a cold chain about his body pressing him to death . "
6239	6243	6274	6274	Em	54	" And then ? "

6381	6399	6415	6416	the girl	345	" Yes ; but the brown history tells only what he did , not what he thought . "
6400	6413	6438	6439	the boy	234	" It was in the brown history that I read of him , "
6418	6432	6438	6439	the boy	234	" but I know what he thought . Books do not tell everything . "
6433	6436	6512	6512	he	361	" No , "

6560	6589	6653	6654	the boy	234	" that what were dry lands now were once lakes ; and what I think is this these low hills were once the shores of a lake ; this "
6591	6632	6653	6654	the boy	234	" is some of the stones that were at the bottom , rolled together by the water . But there is this how did the water come to make one heap here alone , in the centre of the plain ? "
6645	6651	6858	6858	he	234	" When I was small , "
6656	6675	6753	6753	He	392	" I always looked at it and wondered , and I thought a great giant was buried under it .
6709	6729	6753	6753	He	392	" said the boy with earnestness , in a low voice , more as speaking to himself than to them .
6730	6739	6753	6753	He	392	" Oh , Waldo , God put the little "

6780	6837	6858	6858	he	234	" The last words were uttered with the air of one who produces a clinching argument . What effect it had on the questioner was not evident , for he made no reply , and turned away from her . Drawing closer to Lyndall 's feet , he said after a while , in a low voice ,
6838	6857	6980	6981	the boy	234	" Lyndall , has it never seemed to you that the stones were talking with you ? Sometimes , "
6866	6870	6980	6981	the boy	234	" I lie under there
6944	6978	7112	7113	the boy	234	" sloots , í and eat snakes , and shoot the bucks with their poisoned arrows . It was one of them , one of these old wild Bushmen , that painted those , "
6987	7074	7194	7195	the fellow	400	" one who was different from the rest . He did not know why , but he wanted to make something beautiful he wanted to make something , so he made these . He worked hard , very hard , to find the juice to make the paint ; and then he found this place where the rocks hang over , and he painted them . To us they are only strange things , that make us laugh ; but to him they were very beautiful . "
7086	7110	7194	7195	the fellow	400	" He used to kneel here naked , painting , painting , painting ; and he wondered at the things he made himself , "
7124	7193	7254	7254	she	400	" Now the Boers have shot them all , so that we never see a little yellow face peeping out among the stones ; and the wild bucks have gone , and those days , and we are here . But we will be gone soon , and only the stones will be on here , looking at everything like they look now . Of course I know , "
7199	7242	7298	7298	Em	54	" that it is I who am thinking , not they who are talking ; but it seems as though it were them . Has it never seemed to you that things that do not live are talkig to you , Lyndall ? "
7243	7253	7341	7341	YE	406	" No , it never seems so to me , "
7282	7296	7577	7580	the Boer - woman	214	" Let us also go to the house and see who has come , "

7715	7764	7859	7859	he	418	" the man is n't born that can take me in . If he 'd had money would n't he have bought a horse ? Men who walk are thieves , liars , murderers , Rome 's priests , seducers ! I see the Devil in his nose ! "
7775	7805	7874	7875	The German	281	" and to come walking into the house of this Boer 's child , and shaking hands as though he came on horseback ! Oh , no , no ! "

I spent five days on the bank of the river trying to find it could n't . Paid a Kaffir nine pounds to go in and look for it at the risk of his life could n't find it . "
8013	8047	8059	8060	the German	281	" No , no ; he goes to - night . See how he looks at me a poor unprotected female ! If he wrongs me , who is to do me right ? "

8065	8096	8123	8123	he	418	" if you did n't look at her quite so much it might be advisable . She ah she might imagine that you liked her too well , in fact ah "

8267	8276	8284	8285	the stranger	418	" It is the English that she hates . "
8277	8282	8301	8301	I	0	" My dear friend , "

8353	8356	8430	8430	she	214	" Ah , "

8578	8618	8698	8698	he	418	" Ah , yes , yes ; we are all a primitive people here not very lofty . We deal not in titles . Every one is Tanta and Oom aunt and uncle . This may be my room , "
8626	8655	8731	8732	the stranger	418	" It is rough , the room is rough ; not a palace not quite . But it may be better than the fields , a little better , "
8665	8697	8731	8732	the stranger	418	" Come in , come in . There is something to eat a mouthful : not the fare of emperors and kings ; but we do not starve , not yet , "

9737	9757	9791	9792	the German	281	" Believe him ? why of course I do . He himself told me the story three times distinctly . "

10608	10631	10881	10881	Bonaparte	67	" Yes ; but it has been short , very short . Sleep again , my chicken ; it is yet early . "
10819	10855	10881	10881	Bonaparte	67	" You are a student of history , I perceive , my friend , from the study of these volumes that lie scattered about this apartment ; this fact has been made evident to me . "
10856	10865	10913	10914	the German	281	" Well a little perhaps it may be , "
10871	10879	10926	10926	Bonaparte	79	" Being a student of history then , "
10887	10905	10926	10926	Bonaparte	79	" you will doubtless have heard of my great , of my celebrated kinsman , Napoleon Bonaparte ? "

11050	11075	11107	11107	Bonaparte	67	" is one which could not be easily comprehended by one unaccustomed to the study of aristocratic pedigrees ; but the connection is close . "
11076	11081	11135	11135	Bonaparte	67	" Is it possible ! "
11096	11101	11158	11158	Bonaparte	67	" Napoleon an Irishman ! "

11163	11185	11331	11331	Bonaparte	67	" but he was a connection of mine . His nephew , the Duke of Wellington 's nephew , married a cousin of

11344	11366	11423	11423	Bonaparte	67	" he was a coward what you might call a coward . You 've never been in Russia , I suppose ? "

11394	11414	11530	11530	Spree!í	83	" France , England , Germany , a little in this country ; it is all I have travelled . "

Publisher got it cheated me out of it . Great rascals those publishers ! Upon one occasion the Duke of Wellington 's nephew and I were travelling in Russia . All of a sudden one of the horses dropped down dead as a doornail . There we were cold night snow four feet thick great forest one horse not being able to move the sledge night coming on wolves .

When he takes it I shall give you my gun and go . You may yet be saved ; but tell , oh , tell Mary - Ann that I thought of her , that I prayed for her.í "

It was that saved me . If they 'd rushed on me at once , poor old Bon would never have been here to tell this story . But they came on , sir , systematically , one by one . All the rest sat on their tails and waited . The first fellow came

14298	14352	14384	14384	Bonaparte	67	" The German stirred at the cakes , and stirred , and stirred , and stirred . He could give the stranger his bed , and he could give the stranger his hat , and he could give the stranger his brandy ; but his Sunday service ! After a good while he said ,
14353	14363	14384	14384	Bonaparte	67	" I might speak to Tant ' Sannie ; I might

14386	14488	14703	14703	he	281	" it would give me the profoundest felicity , the most unbounded satisfaction ; but in these worn - out habiliments , in these deteriorated garments , it would not be possible , it would not be fitting that I should officiate in service of One whom , for respect , we shall not name . No , my friend , I will remain here ; and , while you are assembling yourselves together in the presence of the Lord , I , in my solitude , will think of and pray for you . No ; I will remain here !

14594	14633	14890	14890	he	60	" It 's not the latest fashion , perhaps , not a West End cut , not exactly ; but it might do ; it might serve at a push . Try it on , try it on ! "
14730	14747	14890	14890	he	60	" I have only worn them once . They might serve ; they might be endured . "

15239	15331	15574	15574	he	234	" I heard your voice this morning when my eyes were not yet open , I felt you near me , my Father . Why do you love me so ? How is it in the last four months all those old questions have gone from me ? I know you are good ; I know you love everything ; I know it is all right ; I feel it . I could not have borne it any more , not any more . I was almost mad . And all the while
15361	15371	15633	15633	he	234	" said the boy , and he laughed low ; "
15376	15379	15633	15633	he	234	" he laughed .

15732	15760	16089	16091	the " predikant	3681	" Yes ; I will wait ; I will wait . But not long ; do not let it be very long , Jesus . I want you ;

16486	16495	16620	16620	Bonaparte	67	" I shall not , my dear friends , "
16499	16509	16620	16620	Bonaparte	67	" long detain you . Much of our precious time has
16564	16575	16704	16705	His mother	439	" In the first place : What is a liar ? "
16614	16618	16704	16705	His mother	439	" I repeat , "
16622	16628	16726	16727	his mother	439	" what is a liar ? "
16642	16657	16722	16722	Sampson	99	" Have you any of you ever seen a liar , my dear friends ? "
16665	16701	16749	16749	she	439	" I hope not ; I truly hope not . But I will tell you what a liar is . I knew a liar once a little boy who lived in Cape Town , in Short Market

16729	16735	16749	16749	she	439	" go and buy sixpence of "

16797	16846	17156	17161	the other , with outstretched finger	704	" meibossí stuck in his throat and he died and was buried . And where did the soul of that little liar go to , my friends ? It went to the lake of fire and brimstone . This brings me to the second point of my discourse . "
16864	16869	17327	17328	the Lord	3492	" said Bonaparte condescendingly . "
16895	16905	17327	17328	the Lord	3492	" I was travelling in Italy once on a time ;
17172	17226	17442	17442	my	0	" I go below , but you , Bonaparte , may soar above.í I gazed ; I stood entranced . At that instant there was a crack in the lurid lake ; it swelled , expanded , and the skeleton of the suicide disappeared , to be seen no more by mortal eye . "
17235	17326	17538	17538	Ezekiel	101	" The lake of melted stone rose in the crater , it swelled higher and higher at the side , it streamed forth at the top . I had presence of mind ; near me was a rock ; I stood upon it . The fiery torrent was vomited out and streamed on either side of me . And through that long and terrible night I stood there alone upon that rock , the glowing , fiery lava on every hand a monument of the long - suffering and tender providence of
17345	17366	17559	17559	Thousands	103	" Now , my dear friends , let us deduce the lessons that are to be learnt from this narrative . "
17482	17491	17601	17602	A God	724	" Every one was impressed , and Bonaparte proceeded .
17492	17532	17638	17640	the young girl	725	" Thirdly ; let us not love too much . If that young man had not loved that young woman , he would not have jumped into Mount Etna . The good men of old never did so . Was Jeremiah
17572	17591	17697	17698	the Lord	3492	" It was love that brought us here.í Oh , let us think always of our own souls first .

17622	17634	18103	18103	he	67	" Oh , beloved friends , remember the little boy and the "
17703	17703	18103	18103	he	67	"
18012	18056	18135	18135	madame	743	" You will , I trust , dear madam , excuse this exhibition of my feelings ; but this this little picture recalls to me my first and best beloved , my dear departed wife , who is now a saint in heaven . "
18093	18102	18232	18232	he	67	" Ah , my first , my beloved ! "
18113	18115	18259	18259	he	67	" Oh ,
18137	18148	18259	18259	he	67	" he added , fixing his eyes on Tant ' Sannie .
18221	18231	18284	18286	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Ah , yes ; I see it now , "
18245	18258	18284	18286	Tant ' Sannie	53	" eyes , mouth , nose , chin , the very expression ! "
18262	18274	18357	18357	he	67	" How is it possible I did not notice it before ? "
18275	18282	18414	18416	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Take another cup of coffee , "
18288	18294	18460	18461	the German	281	" Put some sugar in . "
18332	18350	18460	18461	the German	281	" He 's a God - fearing man , and one who knows how to behave himself , "
18364	18412	18460	18461	the German	281	" If he 's ugly , did not the Lord make him ? And are we to laugh at the Lord 's handiwork ? It is better to be ugly and good than pretty and bad ; though of course it 's nice when one is both , "
18478	18487	18531	18532	the German	281	" Supposing you you , in fact , made the
18492	18499	18531	18532	the German	281	" burst forth the German suddenly , "
18508	18508	18606	18606	Bonaparte	67	"
18525	18529	18668	18668	Bonaparte	67	" Now supposing , "
18533	18596	18668	18668	Bonaparte	67	" merely supposing , of course that some one , some one , in fact , should make an offer to you , say , to become schoolmaster on their farm and teach two children , two little girls , perhaps , and would give you forty pounds a - year , would you accept it ? Just supposing , of course . "
18597	18604	18682	18683	the German	281	" Well , my dear friend , "
18608	18666	18686	18686	he	281	" that would depend on circumstances . Money is no consideration with me . For my wife I have made provision for the next year . My health is broken . Could I meet a place where a gentleman would be treated as a gentleman I would accept it , however small the remuneration . With me , "
18670	18676	18741	18743	The old man	473	" money is no consideration . "
18677	18680	18781	18782	the German	281	" Well , "
18698	18740	18839	18839	Waldo	60	" I think I shall go up and see Tant ' Sannie a little . I go up often on Sunday afternoon to have a general conversation , to see her , you know . Nothing nothing particular , you know . "
18767	18779	18870	18873	the gable little Em	761	" He does n't suspect what I 'm going to do , "
18784	18797	18934	18935	the girl	345	" has n't the least idea . A nice surprise for him . "
18829	18837	18934	18935	the girl	345	" AH , what is the matter ? "
18905	18907	18974	18975	the boy	234	" mealie "
18926	18932	18983	18983	Em	54	" Lyndall made him angry , "
18938	18965	19099	19099	Em	54	" and he has given me the fourteenth of John to learn . He says he will teach me to behave myself when Lyndall troubles him . "
18966	18972	19150	19150	Em	54	" What did she do ? "
18977	18981	19170	19171	the boy	234	" You see , "
18990	19097	19188	19188	Em	54	" whenever he talks she looks out at the door , as though she did not hear him . To - day she asked him what the signs of the Zodiac were , and he said he was surprised that she should ask him ; it was not a fit and proper thing for little girls to talk about . Then she asked him who Copernicus was ; and he said he was one of the Emperors of Rome , who burned the Christians in a golden pig , and the worms ate him up while he was still alive . I do n't know why , "
19102	19148	19188	19188	Em	54	" but she just put her books under her arm , and walked out ; and she will never come to his school again , she says , and she always does what she says . And now I must sit here every day alone , "
19158	19168	19229	19229	she	770	" Perhaps Tant ' Sannie will send him away , "
19183	19186	19295	19295	he	234	" No , "
19194	19196	19354	19354	he	234	" no .
19252	19256	19354	19354	he	234	" said Em dolorously .
19286	19294	19388	19388	Em	54	" There , take it for you , "
19350	19353	19388	19388	Em	54	" If , "
19366	19380	19410	19410	He	234	" if you will not cry I will tell you something a secret . "
19381	19386	19410	19410	He	234	" What is that ? "
19395	19405	19452	19453	the boy	234	" You will tell it to no human being ? "
19406	19409	19495	19495	he	234	" No . "
19422	19429	19495	19495	he	234	" I have made a machine ! "
19436	19450	19516	19517	the boy	234	" Yes ; a machine for shearing sheep . It is almost done , "
19455	19494	19516	19517	the boy	234	" There is only one thing that is not right yet ; but it will be soon . When you think , and think , and think , all night and all day , it comes at last , "
19499	19504	19516	19517	the boy	234	" Where is it ? "
19505	19514	19563	19563	his	234	" Here ! I always carry it here , "
19534	19553	19597	19597	Em	54	" This is a model . When it is done they will have to make a large one . "
19554	19559	19973	19975	the old German	428	" Show it me . "
19566	19587	20064	20066	Tant ' Sannie	53	" No , not till it is done . I can not let any human being see it till then . "
19588	19595	20064	20066	Tant ' Sannie	53	" It is a beautiful secret , "
19965	19971	20084	20085	the German	281	" What may it be ? "
20056	20062	20111	20111	Bonaparte	67	" That is his head , "
20068	20074	20137	20139	Tant ' Sannie	53	" that is his head . "
20075	20082	20169	20171	Tant ' Sannie	53	" But what might it be ? "
20117	20128	20212	20214	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Mary - Ann ! my angel ! my wife ! "
20129	20135	20262	20264	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Is n't it dreadful ? "
20148	20167	20262	20264	Tant ' Sannie	53	" He has got a letter : his wife is dead . You must go and comfort him , "
20175	20210	20359	20359	Tant	53	" and I will go with you . It would not be the thing for me to go alone me , who am only thirty - three , and he an unmarried man now , "
20257	20260	20359	20359	Tant	53	" Oh , "
20266	20285	20396	20398	Tant ' Sannie	53	" I see now it was n't wickedness made him do without his wife so long only necessity . "
20351	20357	20396	20398	Tant ' Sannie	53	" We must all die , "
20365	20374	20412	20412	Bonaparte	67	" it is the dear Lord 's will . "
20388	20394	20469	20469	Bonaparte	67	" It 's very hard , "
20400	20411	20535	20535	her	825	" I know , for I 've lost two husbands . "
20421	20436	20557	20559	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Oh , what does she say ? Speak to me words of comfort ! "
20446	20467	20557	20559	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Ah , I I also ! Two dear , dear wives , whom I shall never see any more ! "
20542	20546	20581	20581	he	67	" Mow wah ! "
20547	20555	20581	20581	he	67	" You must trust in the Lord , "
20561	20572	20642	20643	The German	281	" He can give you more than you have lost . "
20573	20580	20652	20652	his	827	" I do , I do ! "
20584	20598	20692	20694	Tant ' Sannie	53	" but oh , I have no wife ! I have no wife ! "
20614	20641	20652	20652	his	827	" Ask him if he wo n't have a little pap nice , fine , flour pap . There is some boiling on the kitchen fire . "
20655	20680	20740	20740	I	0	" No , nothing shall pass my lips . I should be suffocated . No , no ! Speak not of food to me ! "
20681	20690	20751	20753	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Pap , and a little brandy in , "
20702	20710	20786	20789	the Boer - woman	214	" Perhaps , perhaps if I struggled with myself
20724	20739	20786	20789	the Boer - woman	214	" he said , looking with quivering lip up into the German 's face . "

20841	20912	21042	21044	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Oh , she was a woman ! You are very kind to try and comfort me , but she was my wife . For a woman that is my wife I could live ; for the woman that is my wife I could die ! For a woman that is my wife I could Ah ! that sweet word wife ; when will it rest upon my lips again ? "
20940	20963	21042	21044	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Do you think she understands me ? Oh , tell her every word , that she may know I thank her . "
21003	21022	21069	21071	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Oh , I ca n't , I ca n't ! I shall die ! I shall die ! "
21033	21040	21123	21125	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Come , just a little , "
21047	21052	21173	21176	the Boer - woman	214	" just a drop . "
21053	21068	21173	21176	the Boer - woman	214	" It 's too thick , it 's too thick . I should choke . "
21111	21121	21215	21215	Bonaparte	67	" Ah , this will do your heart good , "
21167	21171	21244	21244	he	67	" Tell him , "
21178	21201	21244	21244	he	67	" that I hope he will sleep well , and that the Lord will comfort him , as the Lord only can . "
21202	21213	21314	21314	Bon	85	" Bless you , dear friend , God bless you , "

21506	21533	21649	21650	the German	281	" Boy , boy , see if there is any coffee left . Well , none . Make a fire . We have done supper , but "

21548	21619	21817	21817	he	281	" I came not to sup , not for mere creature comforts , but for an hour of brotherly intercourse with a kindred spirit . The press of business and the weight of thought , but they alone , may sometimes prevent me from sharing the secrets of my bosom with him for whom I have so great a sympathy . You perhaps wonder when I shall return the two pounds "
21620	21647	21817	21817	he	281	" Oh , no , no ! Make a fire , make a fire , boy . We will have a pot of hot coffee presently , "

22042	22062	22103	22103	Bonaparte	67	" three kernels ! I have not observed that before . This must be retained . This is valuable . "
22081	22087	22146	22146	Bonaparte	67	" Valuable , very valuable ! "
22095	22101	22192	22193	the German	281	" Ah , my friend , "
22105	22118	22192	22193	the German	281	" what joy it is to be once more in your society . "
22158	22182	22246	22246	Bonaparte	67	" I was so deeply grieved , my dear friend , that you and Tant ' Sannie had some slight unpleasantness this evening . "
22183	22190	22246	22246	Bonaparte	67	" Oh , no , no , "
22195	22227	22262	22263	the German	281	" it is all right now . A few sheep missing ; but I make it good myself . I give my twelve sheep , and work in the other eight . "
22228	22244	22262	22263	the German	281	" It is rather hard that you should have to make good the lost sheep , "
22248	22256	22351	22351	he	856	" it is no fault of yours . "

22524	22554	22699	22699	Bonaparte	67	" Yes ; his wife . She has a child six days old , and Tant ' Sannie would turn her out into the fields this night . That , "
22560	22593	22718	22719	the German	281	" that is what I call cruelty diabolical cruelty . My soul abhors that deed . The man that could do such a thing I could run him through with a knife ! "
22624	22687	22761	22762	the German	281	" But all is now well ; Tant ' Sannie gives her word that the maid shall remain for some days . I go to Oom Muller 's to - morrow to learn if the sheep may not be there . If they are not , then I return . They are gone , that is all . I make it good . "
22688	22697	22761	22762	the German	281	" Tant ' Sannie is a singular woman , "
22711	22716	22797	22797	Bonaparte	67	" Singular ! Yes , "
22721	22759	22797	22797	Bonaparte	67	" but her heart is on her right side . I have lived long years with her , and I may say , I have for her an affection , which she returns . I may say , "
22766	22788	22914	22915	the German	73	" I may say , that there is not one soul on this farm for whom I have not an affection . "
22789	22795	22876	22876	he	67	" Ah , my friend , "
22799	22852	22876	22876	he	67	" when the grace of God is in our hearts , is it not so with us all ? Do we not love the very worm we tread upon , and as we tread upon it ? Do we know distinctions of race , or of sex , or of colour ? No !

22989	23002	23111	23111	Bonaparte	67	" It is time that I took my departure , dear friend , "
23006	23076	23111	23111	Bonaparte	67	" but , before I do so , shall we not close this evening of sweet communion and brotherly intercourse by a few words of prayer ? Oh , how good and how pleasant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity ! It is like the dew upon the mountains of Hermon ; for there the Lord bestowed a blessing , even life for evermore . "

23089	23109	23202	23202	he	67	" No , thank you , my friend ; I have business that must be done to - night , "
23113	23145	23267	23267	he	67	" Your dear son appears to have gone to sleep . He is going to take the waggon to the mill to - morrow ! What a little man he is . "

30498	30524	30612	30612	she	59	" You have had nothing to eat . I have put some supper in your room . You must come home with me , Waldo . "
30551	30556	30612	30612	she	59	" You must forget , "
30560	30587	30654	30654	she	59	" Since it happened I walk , I talk , I never sit still . If we remember , we can not bring back the dead . "
30597	30611	30654	30654	she	59	" Forgetting is the best thing . He did not watch it coming , "
30616	30628	30688	30689	The boy	234	" That is the dreadful thing , to see it coming ! "
30632	30653	30796	30796	He	234	" I want it to come suddenly to me too . Why do you think I was driving that bird ? "
30658	30687	30769	30769	You	234	" That was Hans , the bird that hates Bonaparte . I let him out this afternoon ; I thought he would chase him and perhaps kill him . "
30696	30744	30788	30788	they	1092	" He did n't ; but he put his head over the half door of your cabin and frightened him horribly . He was there busy stealing your things . Perhaps he will leave them alone now ; but I wish the bird had trodden on him . "
30758	30768	30816	30816	he	234	" There is a candle and supper on the table .
30773	30778	30816	30816	he	234	" she said authoritatively . "
30795	30795	30836	30836	He	234	"
30809	30815	30862	30862	she	1093	" There is no God ! "
30820	30827	30982	30982	she	59	" no God , not anywhere ! "
30831	30835	31131	31131	Bonaparte	67	" Not anywhere ! "
30854	30861	31131	31131	Bonaparte	67	" Waldo , you are mad , "
30970	30981	31200	31202	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Eat your supper ; it will do you good , "
31124	31129	31239	31241	Tant ' Sannie	53	" That boy Waldo , "
31137	31178	31407	31409	Tant ' Sannie	53	" took himself off coolly this morning as soon as the waggon came , and has not done a stiver of work all day . I 'll not have that kind of thing now I 'm master of this farm . "
31184	31198	31407	31409	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Ah , I expect he 's sorry that his father 's dead , "
31204	31237	31471	31473	Tant ' Sannie	53	" It 's nature , you know . I cried the whole morning when my father died . One can always get another husband , but one ca n't get another father , "
31401	31405	31471	31473	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Beloved Lord , "
31411	31440	31498	31499	the boy	234	" how he looks ! Come in , boy . Could n't you come and say good - day to me ? Do n't you want some supper ? "
31456	31469	31511	31511	she	53	" There 's a ghost been seen in your father 's room , "
31475	31487	31511	31511	she	53	" If you 're afraid you can sleep in the kitchen . "
31488	31496	31471	31473	Tant ' Sannie	53	" I will sleep in our room , "
31502	31510	31539	31539	Bonaparte	67	" Well , you can go now , "
31514	31526	31636	31636	Bonaparte	67	" but be up early to take the sheep . The herd "
31527	31537	31660	31660	he	67	" Yes , be up early , my boy , "
31543	31580	31726	31728	Tant ' Sannie	53	" I am to be master of this farm now ; and we shall be good friends , I trust , very good friends , if you try to do your duty , my dear boy . "
31620	31634	31755	31755	she	53	" Dear me ! I hope you are not hurt , my boy , "
31638	31659	31755	31755	she	53	" You 'll have many a harder thing than that though , before you 've got all you will get , "
31704	31724	31888	31888	Bonaparte	67	" Oh , Lord , beloved Lord , how he did fall ! I ca n't think of it , "
31735	31754	31923	31923	Bonaparte	67	" I always did know he was not right ; but this evening any one could see it , "
31767	31850	31948	31948	Bonaparte	67	" His eyes are as wild as if the devil was in them . He never was like other children . The dear Lord knows , if he does n't walk alone for hours talking to himself . If you sit in the room with him you can see his lips moving the whole time ; and if you talk to him twenty times he does n't hear you . Daft - eyes ; he 's as mad as mad can be . "
31874	31886	31948	31948	Bonaparte	67	" Mad , mad ? I know that kind of mad , "
31890	31921	31978	31978	he	67	" and I know the thing to give for it . The front end of a little horse - whip , the tip ! Nice thing ; takes it out , "
31932	31946	32658	32658	Bonaparte	67	" No more walking about and talking to themselves on this farm now , "
31950	31951	32708	32708	Bonaparte	67	" no
31988	32008	32708	32708	Bonaparte	67	" Bonaparte , rubbing his hands and looking pleasantly across his nose ; and then the three laughed together grimly .
32647	32656	32753	32753	Bonaparte	67	" What have you here , my lad ? "
32694	32706	32753	32753	Bonaparte	67	" But this seems to be a very ingenious little machine , "
32727	32736	32753	32753	Bonaparte	67	" What is it for , my lad ? "
32737	32741	32858	32858	Bonaparte	67	" Shearing sheep . "
32742	32751	32913	32913	Bonaparte	67	" It is a very nice little machine , "
32755	32771	32926	32927	the boy	234	" How does it work , now ? I have never seen anything so ingenious ! "
32847	32856	32926	32927	the boy	234	" I tell you what , my lad , "
32867	32911	32926	32927	the boy	234	" we must get you a patent . Your fortune is made . In three years ' time there 'll not be a farm in this colony where it is n't working . You 're a genius , that 's what you are ! "
32917	32924	32965	32965	Bonaparte	67	" If it were made larger , "
32930	32939	32965	32965	Bonaparte	67	" it would work more smoothly . Do you think
32955	32955	33009	33010	the boy	234	"
32956	32963	33025	33025	Bonaparte	67	" I 'm sure they could , "
32967	33002	33025	33025	Bonaparte	67	" and if not , why I 'll do my best for you . I 'll send it to England . It must be done somehow . How long have you worked at it ? "
33003	33007	33085	33085	Bonaparte	67	" Nine months , "
33012	33023	33117	33117	he	67	" Oh , it is such a nice little machine , "
33027	33055	33117	33117	he	67	" one ca n't help feeling an interest in it . There is only one little improvement , one very little improvement I should like to make . "
33078	33083	33319	33319	Em	54	" Looks better now , "
33087	33116	33321	33321	Waldo	60	" does n't it ? If we ca n't have it made in England we 'll send it to America . Good - bye ; ta - ta , "
33120	33142	33394	33394	she	1140	" You 're a great genius , a born genius , my dear boy , there 's no doubt about it . "
33308	33317	33394	33394	she	1140	" I HAVE found something in the loft , "
33343	33365	34195	34196	The boy	234	" It is a box of books that belonged to my father . We thought Tant ' Sannie had burnt them . "
33380	33393	34132	34139	men to whom not only kopjes and stones	1165	" I do n't think they are very nice , not stories , "
33397	33408	34339	34339	he	67	" but you can go and take any you choose . "
34083	34129	34339	34339	he	67	" As thou , dear Lord , has created things in the beginning , so are they now , so ought they to be , so will they be , world without end ; and it does n't concern us what they are . Amen . "
34145	34163	34567	34568	the boy	234	" What are we , and how came we here ? Understand us , and know us ; "
34324	34338	34581	34581	he	67	" You 've been rather a long time up there , my lad , "
34358	34369	35259	35259	Bonaparte	67	" You did n't hear me calling , I suppose ? "
34518	34521	35262	35262	his	67	" bultongs , "
34604	34651	35262	35262	his	67	" What is the connection between the naked back of a certain boy with a great coat on and a salt - pot under his arm , and the tip of a horsewhip ? Answer : No connection at present , but there will be soon . "
35254	35257	35320	35322	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Ha ! "
35275	35287	35320	35322	Tant ' Sannie	53	" I hope your coat has not been injured ; it is of
35308	35308	35711	35711	Bonaparte	67	"
35309	35318	35711	35711	Bonaparte	67	" Oh , Lord ! oh ! Lord ! "
35330	35366	35729	35731	Tant ' Sannie	53	" how the child looks as though he thought the mud would never wash off . Oh , Lord , I shall die ! You , Bonaparte , are the funniest man I ever saw . "
35705	35709	35751	35751	Bonaparte	67	" This book , "
35713	35728	35751	35751	Bonaparte	67	" is not a fit and proper study for a young and immature mind . "
35741	35744	35834	35834	she	53	" What ? "
35745	35749	35929	35931	Tant ' Sannie	53	" This book , "
35763	35775	35946	35947	the boy	234	" this book is sleg , sleg , Davel , Davel ! "
35825	35833	35946	35947	the boy	234	" Where did you get this book ? "
35845	35927	35972	35974	Tant ' Sannie	53	" I wish that my legs may be as thin as an Englishman 's if it is n't one of your father 's . He had more sins than all the Kaffirs in Kaffirland , for all that he pretended to be so good all those years , and to live without a wife because he was thinking of the one that was dead ! As though ten dead wives could make up for one fat one with arms and legs ! "
35935	35944	35990	35990	he	234	" It was not my father 's book , "
35950	35958	36013	36013	she	53	" I got it from your loft . "
35959	35970	36031	36031	he	67	" My loft ! my book ! How dare you ? "
35976	35989	36041	36043	Tant ' Sannie	53	" It was Em 's father 's . She gave it me , "
35995	36012	36080	36082	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Give it here . What is the name of it ? What is it about ? "
36026	36030	36190	36192	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Political Economy , "
36035	36039	36190	36192	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Dear Lord ! "
36045	36078	36236	36238	Tant ' Sannie	53	" can not one hear from the very sound what an ungodly book it is ! One can hardly say the name . Have n't we got curses enough on this farm ? "
36086	36188	36257	36257	she	53	" my best imported Merino ram dying of nobody knows what , and the short - horn cow casting her two calves , and the sheep eaten up with the scab and the drought ? And is this a time to bring ungodly things about the place , to call down the vengeance of Almighty God to punish us more ? Did n't the minister tell me when I was confirmed not to read any book except my Bible and hymn - book , that the Devil was in all the rest ? And I never have read any other book , "
36197	36203	36289	36289	she	53	" and I never will ! "
36222	36234	36330	36332	Tant ' Sannie	53	" So you will not stay to hear what I say ! "
36240	36256	36565	36565	Bonaparte	67	" There , take your polity - gollity - gominy , your devil 's book ! "
36284	36288	36814	36814	he	67	" Go on , "
36292	36328	36860	36860	Bonaparte	67	" I know you are going to talk to yourself . People who talk to themselves always talk to the Devil . Go and tell him all about it . Go , go ! run ! "
36544	36564	36907	36907	Bonaparte	67	" Political Economyí was no more gone out of existence , like many another poor heretic of flesh and blood .
36805	36813	37080	37080	Bonaparte	67	" No , Bon , my boy , "
36818	36858	37105	37107	Tant ' Sannie	53	" do n't propose ! You ca n't marry for four years , then why propose ? Wheedle her , tweedle her , teedle her , but do n't let her make sure of you . When a woman , "
36873	36905	37150	37152	Tant ' Sannie	53	" when a woman is sure of you she does what she likes with you ; but when she is n't , you do what you like with her . And I "
37070	37078	37246	37248	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Who is it that has come ? "
37093	37103	37246	37248	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Why , my niece , to be sure , "
37114	37148	37311	37313	Tant ' Sannie	53	" She 's the only daughter of my only brother Paul , and she 's come to visit me . She 'll be a nice mouthful to the man that can get her , "
37154	37244	37341	37341	Bonaparte	67	" Her father 's got two thousand pounds in the green waggon box under his bed , and a farm , and five thousand sheep , and God Almighty knows how many goats and horses . They milk ten cows in mid winter , and the young men are after her like flies about a bowl of milk . She says she means to get married in about four months , but she does n't yet know to whom . It was so with me when I was young , "
37250	37294	37530	37530	Trana	128	" I 've sat up with the young men four and five nights a week . And they will come riding again as soon as ever they know that the time 's up that the Englishman made me agree not to marry in . "
37302	37309	37538	37538	they	1237	" Where are you going to ? "
37321	37339	37566	37566	Tant	53	" Ha ! I 'm just going to the kraals ; I 'll be in to supper , "
37525	37528	37601	37603	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Aunt , "
37547	37560	37667	37669	Tant ' Sannie	53	" why does the Englishman sigh so when he looks at me ? "
37561	37564	37667	37669	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Ha ! "
37582	37599	37700	37700	Trana	128	" It 's because he thinks you look like me . I tell you , Trana , "
37605	37665	37716	37716	she	128	" the man is mad with love of me . I told him the other night I could n't marry till Em was sixteen , or I 'd lose all the sheep her father left me . And he talked about Jacob working seven years and seven years again for his wife . And of course he meant me , "
37672	37694	37749	37751	Tant ' Sannie	53	" But he wo n't get me so easily as he thinks ; he 'll have to ask more than once . "
37695	37698	37764	37764	I	0	" Oh ! "
37719	37735	37764	37764	I	0	" Aunt , why does the Englishman always knock against you when he passes you ? "
37736	37747	37835	37837	Tant ' Sannie	53	" That 's because you are always in the way , "
37753	37763	37835	37837	Tant ' Sannie	53	" But , aunt , said Trana , presently , "
37771	37772	37895	37895	Trana	128	" "
37775	37833	37908	37910	Tant ' Sannie	53	" said Tant ' Sannie . It 's only because we 're not accustomed to such noses in this country . In his country he says all the people have such noses , and the redder your nose is the higher you are . He 's of the family of the Queen , Victoria , you know , "
37845	37889	37908	37910	Tant ' Sannie	53	" and he does n't think anything of governors and Church elders , and such people ; they are nothing to him . When his aunt with the dropsy dies he 'll have money enough to buy all the farms in this district ! "
37890	37893	38067	38069	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Oh ! "
37903	37906	38067	38069	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Yes , "
37912	37943	38126	38126	Trana	128	" and he 's only forty - one , though you 'd take him to be sixty . And he told me last night the real reason of his baldness . "
38062	38065	38235	38235	he	60	" And , "
38072	38118	38235	38235	he	60	" if it had not been for the grace of God , and reading of the psalms , he says he would have killed himself . He says he could kill himself quite easily if he wants to marry a woman and she wo n't . "
38119	38124	38283	38283	he	60	" All the world ! "
38248	38248	38305	38305	He	60	"
38251	38271	38444	38444	He	60	" hung . Loosening it , he ran a noose in one end and then doubled it round his arm .
38272	38282	38444	38444	He	60	" Mine , mine ! I have a right , "
38291	38304	38444	38444	He	60	" if I fall and am killed , so much the better ! "
38460	38460	38647	38647	He	60	"
38463	38483	38651	38651	He	60	" to the crumbling bricks . Below was the little window of the loft . With one end of the "
38486	38572	38799	38799	they	1251	" tied round the gable , the other end round his waist , how easy to slide down to it , and to open it , through one of the broken panes , and to go in , and to fill his arms with books , and to clamber up again ! They had burnt one book he would have twenty . Every man 's hand was against his his should be against every man 's . No one would help him he would help himself .
38632	38646	38799	38799	they	1251	" So hot , so bitter , so angry ? Poor little mortal ! "
38669	38679	38799	38799	they	1251	" So hot , so bitter , so angry ? "
38787	38798	38799	38799	they	1251	" So hot , so angry , poor little soul ? "
38803	38803	38799	38799	they	1251	"
38806	38821	38799	38799	they	1251	" slipped from his fingers ; he sat with his arms folded , looking up .
38822	38825	38924	38924	he	60	" We , "
38830	38871	38924	38924	he	60	" have seen the earth when it was young . We have seen small things creep out upon its surface small things that prayed and loved and cried very loudly , and then crept under it again . But we , "
38876	38884	38997	38997	He	60	" are as old as the Unknown . "
38933	38933	38997	38997	He	60	"

39290	39294	39371	39371	Bonaparte	67	" Dried skins , "
39301	39315	39371	39371	Bonaparte	67	" and empty bottles , and boxes , and sacks , and soap . "
39316	39330	39387	39387	he	67	" You do n't keep any of your provisions there sugar , now ? "
39354	39362	39432	39432	he	67	" Only salt , and dried peaches . "
39363	39369	39484	39484	he	67	" Dried peaches ! Eh ? "
39373	39386	39556	39556	Bonaparte	67	" Shut the door , my dear child , shut it tight , "

40440	40497	40842	40842	Bonaparte	67	" It will enable you , Waldo , to reflect on the enormity of the sin you have committed against our Father in heaven . And you may also think of the submission you owe to those who are older and wiser than you are , and whose duty it is to check and correct you . "

53687	53690	54404	54404	he	418	" Yes , "
53694	53739	54464	54465	The stranger	418	" I must go now . Perhaps he has brought us letters from the post from Lyndall . And you know he will have to stay with us till his house is built . I must get his room ready . Good - bye ! "

54418	54422	54435	54436	The boy	234	" Dutch people ? "
54423	54426	54453	54454	The boy	234	" Yes . "
54427	54434	54453	54454	The boy	234	" And you like the life ? "
54439	54445	54569	54569	he	418	" On days like these . "
54446	54452	54617	54618	The stranger	418	" And why on these ? "
54457	54463	54617	54618	The stranger	418	" They are very beautiful . "
54572	54581	54617	54618	The stranger	418	" May I see what you work at ? "
54627	54635	54654	54655	The stranger	418	" Where did you learn this work ? "
54636	54641	54654	54655	The stranger	418	" I taught myself . "
54642	54648	54669	54670	The boy	234	" And these zigzag lines represent "

54742	54746	54829	54830	the stranger	418	" Nine months . "
54787	54796	54836	54836	He	418	" Will you take this for your carving ? "
54811	54818	54862	54863	the stranger	418	" No ; I can not . "
54819	54827	54870	54871	The man	372	" You think it is worth more ? "
54845	54853	54939	54940	the stranger	418	" No ; it is for him . "
54854	54860	54939	54940	the stranger	418	" And who is there ? "
54865	54869	55000	55001	the stranger	418	" My father . "
54934	54937	55000	55001	the stranger	418	" If , "
54960	54973	55072	55072	you	418	" if for such a purpose , why write that upon it ? "

55003	55057	55131	55131	He	418	" that some day , sooner or later , these graves will open , and those Boer - uncles with their wives walk about here in the red sand , with the very fleshly legs with which they went to sleep ? You believe it , do you not ? Then why say , "
55069	55070	55131	55131	He	418	" "
55074	55124	55214	55214	he	418	" asked the boy , lifting for an instant his heavy eyes to the stranger 's face . Half taken aback , the stranger laughed . It was as though a curious little tadpole which he held under his glass should suddenly lift its tail and begin to ask questions .
55125	55130	55236	55236	he	418	" I ? no . "
55138	55147	55236	55236	he	418	" I am a man who believes nothing , hopes

55227	55235	55362	55362	he	418	" Yes , I will tell you , "
55239	55248	55404	55404	He	418	" I will tell you all about it . "
55357	55361	55404	55404	He	418	" I think , "
55372	55390	55568	55568	he	949	" that I partly understand you . It is something after this fashion , is it not ? "
55394	55403	55581	55581	he	0	" In certain valleys there was a hunter . "
55414	55539	55749	55749	He	1727	" Day by day he went to hunt for wild - fowl in the woods ; and it chanced that once he stood on the shores of a large lake . While he stood waiting in the rushes for the coming of the birds , a great shadow fell on him , and in the water he saw a reflection . He looked up to the sky ; but the thing was gone . Then a burning desire came over him to see once again that reflection in the water , and all day he watched and waited ; but night came and it had not returned . Then he went home with his empty bag , moody and silent . His comrades came questioning about
55571	55572	55770	55770	he	1727	" "
55584	55652	55783	55783	himself	1727	" that which I never saw before a vast white bird , with silver wings outstretched , sailing in the everlasting blue . And now it is as though a great fire burnt within my breast . It was but a sheen , a shimmer , a reflection in the water ; but now I desire nothing more on earth than to hold her.í His friend laughed . "
55740	55748	55783	55783	himself	1727	" What ails him?í said his comrades . "
55757	55769	55911	55912	the hunter	1727	" No ; but he is worse , í said another ; "
55786	55838	55958	55960	The old man	473	" Come , let us forswear his company , í said all . So the hunter walked alone . One night , as he wandered in the shade , very heart - sore and weeping , an old man stood before him , grander and taller than the sons of men . "
55846	55857	55999	56001	the old man	473	" I am Wisdom , í answered the old man ; "
55914	55957	56136	56136	he	0	" Oh , you who have lived here so long , tell me , what is that great wild bird I have seen sailing in the blue ? They would have me believe she is a dream ; the shadow of my own head.í
55963	55988	56201	56201	he	1727	" Her name is Truth . He who has once seen her never rests again . Till death he desires her.í And the hunter cried "
56004	56046	56244	56244	he	0	" You have not suffered enough , í and went . Then the hunter took from his breast the shuttle of Imagination , and wound on it the thread of his Wishes ; and all night he sat and wove a net .
56141	56188	56312	56313	the people	1595	" A human - God ! a human - God ! a human - God!í it sang . The second that came was black and mystical , with dark , lovely eyes , that looked into the depths of your soul , and he sang only this "
56203	56235	56376	56376	he	1727	" They are surely of the beautiful family of Truth.í Then came another , green and gold , who sang in a shrill voice , like one crying in the marketplace , "
56246	56310	56376	56376	he	1727	" You are not so fair ; but you are fair too , í and he took it . And others came , brightly coloured , singing pleasant songs , till all the grains were finished . And the hunter gathered all his birds together , and built a strong iron cage called a new creed , and put all his birds in it .
56320	56328	56555	56556	the hunter	1727	" Oh , happy hunter!í they cried . "
56378	56473	56555	56556	the hunter	1727	" Surely Truth is among them . In time she will moult her feathers , and I shall see her snow - white form.í But the time passed , and the people sang and danced ; but the hunter 's heart grew heavy . He crept alone , as of old , to weep ; the terrible desire had awakened again in his breast . One day , as he sat alone weeping , it chanced that Wisdom met him . He told the old man what he had done . And Wisdom smiled sadly .
56474	56482	56718	56718	He	1727	" Many men , í he said , "
56561	56581	56718	56718	He	1727	" And must I then sit still , to be devoured of this great burning?í And the old man said ,
56582	56676	56753	56754	Some men	1735	" Listen , and in that you have suffered much and wept much , I will tell you what I know . He who sets out to search for Truth must leave these valleys of superstition for ever , taking with him not one shred that has belonged to them . Alone he must wander down into the Land of Absolute Negation and Denial ; he must abide there ; he must resist temptation ; when the light breaks he must arise and follow it into the country of dry sunshine . The mountains of
56693	56717	56818	56818	himself	473	" And he will hold her fast ! he will hold her in his hands!í the hunter cried . Wisdom shook his head . "
56733	56742	56886	56887	The hunter	1727	" Then there is no hope?í cried the hunter .
56743	56752	56886	56887	The hunter	1727	" There is this , í said Wisdom : "
56829	56871	57058	57058	my	0	" it shall come to pass , that when enough of those silver feathers shall have been gathered by the hands of men , and shall have been woven into a cord , and the cord into a net , that in that
56890	56903	57024	57024	I	0	" I will go , í he said . But Wisdom detained him .
56904	56978	57157	57157	its	1771	" Mark you well who leaves these valleys never returns to them . Though he should weep tears of blood seven days and nights upon the confines , he can never put his foot across them . Left they are left forever . Upon the road which you would travel there is no reward offered . Who goes , goes freely for the great love that is in him . The work is his reward.í
56979	56988	57244	57244	he	1727	" I go , í said the hunter ; "
57002	57023	57272	57272	He	0	" I am the child of The - Accumulated - Knowledge - of - Ages , í said the man ; "
57162	57169	57374	57375	the people	1595	" Immortality!í And he said quickly , "
57253	57266	57404	57405	The hunter	1727	" Oh , my beautiful ! my heart 's own!í he cried , "
57278	57283	57457	57457	they	1595	" Go!í he said . "
57382	57392	57489	57489	others	4156	" Fool , hound , demented lunatic!í they cried . "
57415	57448	57489	57489	others	4156	" Truth ! who is she ? Can you eat her ? can you drink her ? who has ever seen her ? Your birds were real : all could hear them sing !
57460	57464	57611	57612	the stranger	418	" you pollute the air.í
57465	57481	57611	57612	the stranger	418	" Come , let us take up stones and stone him , í cried some . "
57491	57540	57880	57880	They	1789	" Let the idiot go , í and went away . But the rest gathered up stones and mud and threw at him . At last , when he was bruised and cut , the hunter crept away into the woods . And it was evening about him . "
57602	57609	57918	57918	Our	1791	" He wandered on and on , "
57614	57654	57958	57958	they	1789	" and the shade grew deeper . He was on the borders now of the land where it is always night . Then he stepped into it , and there was no light there . With his hands he groped ;
57885	57895	57958	57958	they	1789	" Who are you , í asked the hunter , "
57906	57917	58041	58041	me	0	" We are the twins Sensuality , í they cried . "
57961	57975	58202	58202	he	1799	" Oh , let me wrap my arms about you!í cried the first ; "
58000	58015	58285	58285	you	1789	" I will pour my hot life into you , í said the second ; "
58045	58055	58420	58420	his	234	" Oh , follow us , í they cried , "
58204	58259	58823	58823	I	0	" Yes , why should I die here in this awful darkness ? They are warm , they are warm!í and he stretched out his hands to take them . Then in a moment there arose before him the image of the thing he had loved , and his hand dropped to his side . "
58274	58284	59105	59105	he	1727	" You dazzle my eyes , í he cried , "
58437	58457	59105	59105	he	1727	" He reached that light at last , and stepped into the broad sunshine , í said the stranger . "
58739	58817	59194	59194	they	1823	" I will rear a stair against it ; and , once this wall climbed , I shall be almost there , í he said bravely ; and set to work . With his shuttle of imagination he dug out stones ; but half of them would not fit , and sometimes half a month 's work would roll down because those below were ill chosen . But the hunter worked on , saying always to himself , "
59110	59148	59319	59320	the hunter	1727	" I will do this , or thatí he only worked . And at night , when the twilight settled down , there looked out at him from the holes and crevices in the rocks strange wild faces .
59149	59167	59429	59429	they	1827	" Stop your work , you lonely man , and speak to us , í they cried . "
59202	59216	59486	59486	he	1727	" Look down into the crevice at your feet , í they said . "
59326	59420	59685	59686	the hunter	1727	" Have I torn from my heart all that was dearest ; have I wandered alone in the land of night ; have I resisted temptation ; have I dwelt where the voice of my kind is never heard , and laboured alone , to lie down and be food for you , ye harpies?í He laughed fiercely ; and the Echoes of Despair slunk away , for the laugh of a brave , strong heart is as a death blow to them . Nevertheless they crept out again and looked at him . "
59432	59473	59742	59742	her	1840	" that your hands begin to tremble like a child 's ? Do you see that the point of your shuttle is gone ? it is cracked already . If you should ever climb this stair , í they said , "
59489	59498	59916	59916	they	1813	" I know it ! í and worked on .
59690	59719	59981	59981	He	1845	" Ah ! they who die there do not die alone , í he cried . Then the mists rolled together again ; and he turned his eyes away .
59720	59729	60024	60024	you	0	" I have sought , í he said , "
59901	59914	60048	60048	you	0	" My soul hears their glad step coming , í he said ; "
59986	60021	60058	60059	the stranger	418	" The boy had shaded his eyes with his hand . On the wood of the carving great drops fell . The stranger must have laughed outright , or remained silent and somewhat solemn . "
60028	60035	60058	60059	the stranger	418	" the boy whispered at last . "
60052	60052	60127	60127	Men	3470	"
60053	60056	60434	60434	himself	242	" Certainly , "
60061	60087	60475	60476	the boy	234	" the whole of the story is not written here , but it is suggested . And the attribute of all true art , the highest and
60135	60298	60522	60523	the stranger	418	" People read more in this or that work of genius than was ever written in it , í not perceiving that they pay the highest compliment . If we pick up the finger and nail of a real man , we can decipher a whole story could almost reconstruct the creature again , from head to foot . But half the body of a Mumboo - jumbow idol leaves us utterly in the dark as to what the rest was like . We see what we see , but nothing more . There is nothing so universally intelligible as truth . It has a thousand meanings , and suggests a thousand more , all true . Though a man should carve it into matter with the least possible manipulative skill , it will yet find interpreters . It is the soul that looks out with burning eyes through the most gross fleshly filament . It is that which is universal . Whosoever should

60463	60474	60653	60653	he	234	" All my life I have longed to see you , "
60528	60534	60653	60653	he	234	" Do something for me . "
60540	60576	60887	60888	the boy	234	" No ; stay where you are . I do n't want you to go anywhere ; I want you to talk to me . Tell me what you have been doing all your life . "
60645	60652	60973	60973	he	418	" I have never done anything , "
60656	60695	60973	60973	he	418	" Then tell me of that nothing . I like to know what other folks have been doing whose word I can believe . It is interesting . What was the first thing you ever wanted very much ? "
60873	60885	61033	61033	he	418	" I will remember more to tell you if you like , "

61036	61093	61683	61684	the speaker	1894	" here with the karroo - bushes and red sand . You wonder what I mean ? To all who have been born in the old faith there comes a time of danger , when the old slips from us , and we have not yet planted our feet on the new ; when the voice from Sinai
61263	61285	61683	61684	the speaker	1894	" Thou shalt and shalt not , í are carved into the nature of things . This is the time of danger .

61570	61666	61683	61684	the speaker	1894	" When the day has come when they have seen the path in which they might walk , they have not the strength to follow it . Habits have fastened on them from which nothing but death can free them ; which cling closer than his sacerdotal sanctimony to a priest ; which feed on the intellect like a worm sapping energy , hope , creative power , resolution , all that makes a man higher than a beast leaving only the power to yearn , to regret , and to sink lower in the abyss .

63012	63047	63207	63207	Jemima	157	" IT is hardly six months since I left you to come to this spot , yet could you now see me I know what you would say , I know what mother would say "
63062	63073	63207	63207	Jemima	157	" Yes , Jemima , it is your Greg , and the
63236	63258	63207	63207	Jemima	157	" But there are things , there is a thing , which the soul longs to pour forth into a kindred ear .
63259	63307	63505	63505	she	1951	" Dear sister , have you ever known what it is to keep wanting and wanting and wanting to kiss some one 's mouth , and you may not ; to touch some one 's hand , and you can not ? I am in love , Jemima !
63308	63318	63594	63594	she	1951	" The old Dutch - woman from whom I hire this
63334	63431	63594	63594	she	1951	" She is English . I do not know how her father came to marry a Boer - woman . It makes me feel so strange to put down that letter , that I can hardly go on writing E . I 've loved her ever since I came here . For weeks I have not been able to eat or drink ; my very tobacco when I smoke has no taste ; and I can remain for no more than five minutes in one place , and sometimes feel as though I were really going mad .
63432	63494	63654	63654	her	1951	" Every evening I go there to fetch my milk . Yesterday she gave me some coffee . The spoon fell on the ground . She picked it up ; when she gave it me her finger touched mine . Jemima , I do not know if I fancied it I shivered hot , and she shivered too ! I thought , "
63597	63610	63654	63654	her	1951	" Good evening , Waldo . Have some coffee!í and she kissed him .
63611	63620	63654	63654	her	1951	" All last night I heard nothing else but "
63657	63666	63819	63819	They	1960	" Good evening , Waldo . Have some coffee!í "
63671	63736	63839	63840	Not angels	1961	" I have not eaten a mouthful to - day . This evening I go and propose to her . If she refuses me I shall go and kill myself to - morrow . There is a dam of water close by . The sheep have drunk most of it up , but there is still enough if I tie a stone to my neck .
63737	63796	63839	63840	Not angels	1961	" It is a choice between death and madness . I can endure no more . If this should be the last letter you ever get from me , think of me tenderly , and forgive me . Without her life would be a howling wilderness , a long tribulation . She is my affinity ; the one love of

63878	63912	64142	64142	Gregory	156	" P.S. Tell mother to take care of my pearl studs . I left them in the wash - hand - stand drawer . Do n't let the children get hold of them . "

64150	64172	64241	64241	Em	54	" Oh , no ; it is so nice . I always come to watch the milking . That red cow with the

64236	64239	64335	64335	Em	54	" Yes , "
64256	64266	64361	64361	he	156	" But I 'm sure you must be cold , "
64301	64326	64386	64386	Em	54	" Oh , Em , I love you better than all the world besides ! Tell me , do you love me a little ? "
64327	64333	64386	64386	Em	54	" Yes , I do , "
64347	64360	64438	64438	Gregory	156	" Better than everything ; better than all the world , darling ? "

64390	64423	64584	64584	He	1972	" I do love you very much ; but I love my cousin who is at school , and Waldo , very much . You see I have known them so long ! "
64424	64437	64630	64630	she	1973	" Oh , Em , do not talk to me so coldly ! "

64494	64583	64709	64709	he	156	" Em , if you talk so to me I will go mad ! You must love me , love me better than all ! You must give yourself to me . I have loved you since that first moment when I saw you walking by the stone wall with the jug in your hands . You were made for me , created for me ! I will love you till I die ! Oh , Em , do not be so cold , so cruel to me ! "
64621	64629	64748	64748	he	156	" I do love you very much , "
64633	64684	64748	64748	he	156	" but I do not know if I want to marry you . I love you better than Waldo , but I ca n't tell if I love you better than Lyndall . If you would let me wait for a week , I think perhaps I could tell you . "
64696	64708	64805	64805	Em	54	" If you could but love me as I love you , "
64712	64747	64805	64805	Em	54	" but no woman can love as a man can . I will wait till Saturday . I will not once come near you till then . Good - bye ! Oh , Em , "
64768	64796	64748	64748	he	156	" if you are not my wife I can not live . I have never loved another woman , and I never shall ! never , never ! "
64797	64803	64927	64927	She	1975	" You make me afraid , "
64807	64821	64970	64970	one	324	" Come , let us go , and I will fill your pail . "
64822	64841	65061	65061	Gregory	156	" I want no milk . Good - bye ! You will not see me again till Saturday . "
64908	64926	65114	65114	she	1975	" Better than all the world ; better than everything ; he loves me better than everything ! "

65092	65113	65371	65371	she	54	" I will send for him to - morrow , and I will tell him how I love him back , "
65172	65178	65396	65396	she	54	" If I see her , "
65182	65205	65396	65396	she	54	" I shall only bow to her . She shall see that I am a man , one who keeps his word . "
65361	65370	65501	65501	Em	54	" I do love you best of all , "
65386	65395	65542	65542	he	0	" I wish I was beautiful and nice , "

65529	65541	65580	65580	she	54	" You are so silent , so cold , my Em , "
65545	65554	65688	65688	I	0	" Have you nothing to say to me ? "
65564	65573	65718	65718	she	54	" I will do everything you tell me , "
65591	65633	65718	65718	she	54	" Then , my own precious one , promise never to kiss that fellow again . I can not bear that you should love any one but me . You must not ! I will not have it ! If every relation I

65710	65717	65842	65842	she	54	" I will never kiss him , "
65721	65744	65842	65842	she	54	" and I will try not to love any one else . But I do not know if I will be able . "
65745	65772	65942	65942	she	53	" Oh , my darling , I think of you all night , all day . I think of nothing else , love , nothing else , "
65832	65841	65989	65989	he	1994	" I do not know how it is , "
65850	65885	66109	66110	the lover	2006	" but I can not love you so much as you love me . Perhaps it is because I am only a woman ; but I do love you as much as I can . "
65937	65940	66109	66110	the lover	2006	" vrijers , "
65994	66010	66127	66127	Em	54	" like a summer night , when you are dreaming of some one you love . "
66099	66107	66220	66220	she	54	" You are so beautiful , Em , "
66112	66126	66220	66220	she	54	" It comes over me in a flood suddenly how I love you . "
66130	66185	66312	66312	He	2007	" Tant ' Sannie says when I am her age no one will look at me ; and it is true . My hands are as short and broad as a duck 's foot , and my forehead is so low , and I have n't any nose . I ca n't be pretty . "
66202	66219	66333	66333	Em	54	" When my cousin comes to - morrow you will see a beautiful woman , Gregory , "
66224	66277	66333	66333	Em	54	" She is like a little queen : her shoulders are so upright , and her head looks as though it ought to have a little crown upon it . You must come to see her to - morrow as soon as she comes . I am sure you will love her . "
66278	66311	66388	66388	she	54	" Of course I shall come to see her , since she is your cousin ; but do you think I could ever think any woman as lovely as I think you ? "
66320	66331	66731	66731	he	156	" You could not help seeing that she is prettier , "
66342	66360	66794	66794	she	54	" but you will never be able to like any one so much as you like me . "
66402	66405	66794	66794	she	54	" kopje . "
66738	66756	67013	67013	Em	54	" Where is my wife ? Has no one seen my wife ? Wife , some coffee ! "
66788	66793	67013	67013	Em	54	" Oh , God ! "
66797	66821	67066	67066	Em	54	" I am so glad ! I do not know what I have done that I should be so glad . Thank you ! "
67005	67011	67013	67013	Em	54	" What are you noticing ? "
67015	67054	67104	67104	Lyndall	59	" Nothing and everything . I thought the windows were higher . If I were you , when I get this place I should raise the walls . There is not room to breathe here ; one suffocates . "
67055	67064	67130	67130	Lyndall	59	" Gregory is going to make many alterations , "
67079	67092	67130	67130	Lyndall	59	" Do you like him , Lyndall ? Is he not handsome ? "
67093	67102	67158	67158	they	2026	" He must have been a fine baby , "
67122	67128	67171	67171	she	54	" There are some men , "
67132	67143	67267	67267	Lyndall	59	" whom you never can believe were babies at all ; and
67165	67165	67267	67267	Lyndall	59	"
67178	67244	67372	67372	men	3470	" When you know him you will love him as I do . When I compare other people with him , they seem so weak and little . Our hearts are so cold , our loves are mixed up with so many other things . But he no one is worthy of his love . I am not . It is so great and pure . "
67245	67265	67398	67398	Em	54	" You need not make yourself unhappy upon that point your poor return for his love , my dear , "
67269	67337	67443	67443	Em	54	" A man 's love is a fire of olive - wood . It leaps higher every moment ; it roars , it blazes , it shoots out red flames ; it threatens to wrap you round and devour you you who stand by like an icicle in the glow of its fierce warmth . You are self - reproached at your own chilliness and want of reciprocity .
67384	67384	67473	67473	She	59	"
67385	67396	67518	67518	Em	54	" You speak so because you do not know men , "
67425	67441	67518	67518	Em	54	" You will know them too some day , and then you will think differently , "
67506	67508	67587	67587	she	59	" R.R. "
67512	67517	67591	67591	she	59	" Ah , Lyndall , "
67521	67546	67768	67768	she	59	" perhaps you are engaged yourself that is why you smile . Yes ; I am sure you are . Look at this ring ! "
67555	67586	67768	67768	she	59	" I am not in so great a hurry to put my neck beneath any man 's foot ; and I do not so greatly admire the crying of babies , "
67604	67614	67768	67768	she	59	" There are other women glad of such work . "
67751	67762	67834	67834	she	59	" Wait for me ; I am coming with you , "
67774	67806	67883	67883	she	59	" If I had not gone to look for you yesterday you would not have come to greet me till now . Do you not like me any longer , Waldo ? "
67807	67814	67883	67883	she	59	" Yes but you are changed . "
67826	67833	67925	67927	an uncomprehended cipher	2037	" You like the pinafores better ? "
67874	67882	67944	67944	You	60	" My dress has changed a little , "
67886	67890	67957	67957	I	0	" and I also ;
67929	67943	68012	68012	he	60	" Waldo changed the bag , and they walked on side by side . "
67948	67952	68041	68041	She	2041	" she said . "
67976	67976	68041	68041	She	2041	"
68005	68011	68181	68181	They	2048	" Have you learnt much ? "
68024	68040	68278	68278	he	0	" When I come back again I shall know everything that a human being can . "
68044	68084	68483	68484	the drove	4310	" Are you thinking of my old boast ? Yes ; I have learnt something , though hardly what I expected , and not quite so much . In the first place , I have learnt that one of my ancestors
68192	68271	68652	68652	you	0	" Into how little space a human soul can be crushed?í I have seen some souls so compressed that they would have fitted into a small thimble , and found room to move there , wide room . A woman who has been for many years in one of those places carries the mark of the beast on her till she dies , though she may expand a little afterward , when she breathes in the free world . "
68272	68277	68690	68690	she	2057	" Were you miserable ? "
68288	68478	68676	68676	They	2056	" I ? no . I am never miserable and never happy . I wish I were . But I should have run away from the place on the fourth day , and hired myself to the first Boer - woman whose farm I came to , to make fire under her soap - pot , if I had to live as the rest of the drove did . Can you form an idea , Waldo , of what it must be to be shut up with cackling old women , who are without knowledge of life , without love of the beautiful , without strength , to have your soul cultured by them ? It is suffocation only to breathe the air they breathe ; but I made them give me room . I told them I should leave , and they knew I came there on my own account ; so they gave me a bed - room without the companionship of one of those things that were having their brains slowly diluted and squeezed out of them . I did not learn music , because I had no
68656	68656	68690	68690	she	2057	"
68657	68660	68712	68712	he	0	" Nothing . "
68661	68675	68748	68748	she	2057	" That is not possible . I shall find out by and by . "
68695	68707	68748	68748	she	2057	" Do n't you wish you were a woman , Waldo ? "
68708	68711	68922	68922	she	2057	" No , "
68719	68747	68990	68990	she	2057	" I thought not . Even you are too worldly wise for that . I never met a man who did . This is a pretty ring , "
68767	68834	68990	68990	she	2057	" Worth fifty pounds at least . I will give it to the first man who tells me he would like to be a woman . There might be one on Robbin Island who would win it perhaps , but I doubt it even there . It is delightful to be a woman ; but every man thanks the Lord devoutly that he is n't one . "
68909	68921	68970	68970	Waldo	60	" Let us wait at this camp and watch the birds , "
68983	68989	69131	69131	she	2060	" I like these birds , "
68993	69018	69206	69206	she	2060	" they share each other 's work , and are companions . Do you take an interest in the position of women , Waldo ? "
69019	69022	69206	69206	she	2060	" No . "
69023	69130	69206	69206	she	2060	" I thought not . No one does , unless they are in need of a subject upon which to show their wit . And as for you , from of old you can see nothing that is not separated from you by a few millions of miles , and strewed over with mystery . If women were the inhabitants of Jupiter , of whom you had happened to hear something , you would pore over us and our condition night and day ; but because we are before your eyes you never look at us . You care nothing that this is ragged and ugly , "
69142	69205	69255	69255	he	2062	" but you strive mightily to make an imaginary leaf on an old stick beautiful . I 'm sorry you do n't care for the position of women ; I should have liked us to be friends ; and it is the only thing about which I think much or feel much if , indeed , I have any feeling about anything , "
69217	69232	69255	69255	he	2062	" When I was a baby , I fancy my parents left me out in the
69246	69246	69320	69320	she	2063	"
69247	69254	69320	69320	she	2063	" Show me what you feel , "
69258	69314	69432	69432	she	2063	" I have only a few old thoughts , and I think them over and over again ; always beginning where I left off . I never get any further . I am weary of them . I am like an old hen that sits on eggs month after month and they never come out . "
69315	69319	69404	69404	she	2063	" And I , "
69324	69392	69501	69502	the boy	234	" am so pressed in upon by new things that , lest they should trip one another up , I have to keep forcing them back . My head swings sometimes . But this one thought stands , never goes if I might but be one of these born in the future ; then perhaps to be born a woman will not be to be born branded . "
69411	69431	69501	69502	the boy	234	" I know it is foolish . Wisdom never kicks at the iron walls it ca n't bring down , "
69435	69492	69545	69545	she	2063	" But we are cursed . Waldo , born cursed from the time our mothers bring us into the world till the shrouds are put on us . Do not look at me as though I were talking nonsense . Everything has two sides the outside that is ridiculous , and the inside that is solemn . "
69493	69499	69545	69545	she	2063	" I am not laughing , "
69506	69512	69545	69545	she	2063	" but what curses you ? "
69527	69544	69545	69545	she	2063	" It is not what is done to us , but what is made of us , "
69550	69615	69707	69707	women	1671	" that wrongs us . No man can be really injured but by what modifies himself . We all enter the world little plastic beings , with so much natural force perhaps , but for the rest blank ; and the world tells us what we are to be , and shapes us by the ends it sets before us . To you it says "
69618	69624	69707	69707	women	1671	" and to us it says "
69627	69645	69941	69941	your	2071	" To you it says As you approximate to man 's highest ideal of God , as your arm
69709	69853	70282	70287	the person I am talking to	2077	" Look at this little chin of mine , Waldo , with the dimple in it . It is but a small part of my person ; but though I had a knowledge of all things under the sun , and the wisdom to use it , and the deep loving heart of an angel , it would not stead me through life like this little chin . I can win money with it , I can win love ; I can win power with it , I can win fame . What would knowledge help me ? The less a woman has in her head the lighter she is for climbing . I once heard an old man say , that he never saw intellect help a woman so much as a pretty ankle ; and it was the truth . They begin to
69861	69877	70282	70287	the person I am talking to	2077	" she said , with her lips drawn in to look as though they smiled , "
69927	69940	70282	70287	the person I am talking to	2077	" Little one , you can not go , í they say ; "
70181	70256	70526	70526	they	2087	" But what does it help ? A little bitterness , a little longing when we are young , a little futile searching for work , a little passionate striving for room for the exercise of our powers , and then we go with the drove . A woman must march with her regiment . In the end she must be trodden down or go with it ; and if she is wise she goes .
70257	70266	70568	70568	she	2085	" I see in your great eyes what you are
70269	70277	70568	70568	she	2085	" she said , glancing at him ; "
70536	70536	70737	70737	they	2087	"
70563	70567	70737	70737	they	2087	" Mark you , "
70571	70626	70795	70795	you	2100	" we have always this advantage over you we can at any time step into ease and competence , where you must labour patiently for it . A little weeping , a little wheedling , a little self - degradation , a little careful use of our advantages , and then some man will say "
70712	70735	70817	70817	She	2103	" She ran her little finger savagely along the topmost bar , shaking off the dozen little dewdrops that still hung there . "
70747	70751	70817	70817	She	2103	" she cried . "
70800	70800	70955	70955	they	2105	"
70824	70875	70955	70955	they	2105	" I was coming up in Cobb and Co. 's the other day . At a little wayside hotel we had to change the large coach for a small one . We were ten passengers , eight men and two women . As I sat in the house the gentlemen came and
70880	70946	71056	71056	another	4138	" There is not room for all in the new coach , take your seat quickly.í We hurried out , and they gave me the best seat , and covered me with rugs , because it was drizzling . Then the last passenger came running up to the coach an old woman with a wonderful bonnet , and a black shawl pinned with a yellow pin .
70947	70948	70955	70955	they	2105	" "
70958	70988	71048	71048	You	0	" you must wait till next week 's coach takes you up;í but she climbed on to the step , and held on at the window with both hands . "
70989	71011	71056	71056	another	4138	" My son - in - law is ill , and I must go and see him , í she said . "
71012	71021	71066	71066	I	0	" My good woman , í said one , "
71046	71047	71082	71082	they	2109	" "
71058	71065	71103	71103	he	0	" or the wheel will catch you.í "
71075	71076	71111	71112	the woman	693	" "
71085	71090	71246	71246	her	693	" we will not allow that.í
71091	71092	71222	71222	Waldo	60	" "
71116	71141	71222	71222	Waldo	60	" There were nine of us in that coach , and only one showed chivalrous attention and that was a woman to a woman . "
71171	71214	71246	71246	her	693	" The bees are very attentive to the flowers till their honey is done , and then they fly over them . I do n't know if the flowers feel grateful to the bees ; they are great fools if they do . "
71215	71220	71380	71380	he	162	" But some women , "
71237	71243	71566	71566	she	2128	" some women have power . "
71253	71282	71566	71566	she	2128	" Power ! Did you ever hear of men being asked whether other souls should have power or not ? It is born in them . You may dam up
71374	71377	71740	71740	We	2130	" Faustí and "
71562	71565	71776	71776	we	2130	" Power ! "
71579	71692	71810	71810	he	2133	" Yes , we have power ; and since we are not to expend it in tunnelling mountains , nor healing diseases , nor making laws , nor money , nor on any extraneous object , we expend it on you . You are our goods , our merchandise , our material for operating on ; we buy you , we sell you , we make fools of you , we act the wily old Jew with you , we keep six of you crawling to our little feet , and praying only for a touch of our little hand ; and they say truly , there was never an ache or pain or
71754	71774	71870	71870	she	2137	" she said , balancing her outstretched arm gracefully , as though tiny beings disported themselves in its palm . "
71788	71797	71870	71870	she	2137	" she said , folding her arms composedly . "
71824	71824	71902	71902	They	2138	"
71852	71869	72002	72002	you	2142	" They bring weighty arguments against us when we ask for the perfect freedom of women , "
71873	71891	72124	72124	she	144	" but , when you come up to the objections , they are like pumpkin - devils , with
71925	71989	72147	72147	Waldo	60	" If the bird does like its cage , and does like its sugar and will not leave it , why keep the door so very carefully shut ? Why not open it , only a little ? Do they know , there is many a bird will not break its wings against the bars , but would fly if the doors were open .
71990	71996	72449	72449	she	2156	" Then they say again , "
72116	72116	72449	72449	she	2156	"
72152	72276	72503	72503	they	2158	" They say women have one great and noble work left them , and they do it ill . That is true ; they do it execrably . It is the work that demands the broadest culture , and they have not even the narrowest . The lawyer may see no deeper than his law books , and the chemist see no further than the windows of his laboratory , and they may do their work well . But the woman who does woman 's work needs a many - sided , multiform culture ; the heights and depths of human life must strike an answering chord in her ; she must have knowledge of men and things in many states , a wide catholicity
72398	72448	72517	72517	she	2156	" The mightiest and noblest of human work is given to us , and we do it ill . Send an untutored navvie to work into an artist 's studio , and see what you will find there ! And yet , thank God , we have this work , "
72453	72474	72517	72517	she	2156	" it is the one window through which we see into the great world of earnest labour . The meanest girl who
72510	72510	72714	72714	She	2156	"
72511	72516	72714	72714	She	2156	" And they say , "
72521	72554	72714	72714	She	2156	" that we complain of woman 's being compelled to look upon marriage as a profession ; but that she is free to enter upon it or leave it , as she pleases .
72555	72679	72798	72799	a Hottentot	2165	" Yes and a cat set afloat in a pond is free to sit in the tub till it dies , it is under no obligation to wet its feet ; and a drowning man may catch at a straw or not , just as he likes it is a glorious liberty ! Let any man think for five minutes of what old maidenhood means to a woman and then let him be silent . Is it easy to bear through life a name that in itself signifies defeat ? to dwell , as nine out of ten unmarried women must , under the finger of another woman ? Is it easy to look forward to an old age without honour , without the reward
72713	72713	72960	72960	She	2172	"
72727	72742	72960	72960	She	2172	" And then , when they have no other argument against us , they say "
72788	72797	73072	73073	The Lord	3492	" she said , curling her pretty lip ; "
72959	72959	73200	73200	She	2172	"
72983	73043	73229	73229	she	2172	" They ask , What will you gain , even if man does not become extinct ? you will have brought justice and equality on to the earth , and sent love from it . When men and women are equals they will love no more . Your highly - cultured women will not be lovable , will not love .
73044	73071	73229	73229	she	2172	" Do they see nothing , understand nothing ? It is Tant ' Sannie who buries husbands one after another , and folds her hands resignedly , "
73138	73199	73323	73323	his	60	" A great soul draws and is drawn with a more fierce intensity than any small one . By every inch we grow in intellectual height our love strikes down its roots deeper , and spreads out its arms wider . It is for love 's sake yet more than for any other that we look for that new time . "
73221	73228	73319	73319	he	60	" Then when that time comes , "
73233	73252	73351	73351	She	2172	" when love is no more bought or sold , when it is not a means of making bread ,
73297	73297	73361	73361	she	2172	"
73315	73318	73361	73361	she	2172	" Lyndall , "
73329	73350	73393	73393	he	60	" if you think that that new time will be so great , so good , you who speak so easily "
73355	73360	73393	73393	he	60	" Speak ! speak ! "
73364	73379	73428	73428	she	2172	" the difficulty is not to speak ; the difficulty is to keep silence . "
73380	73392	73470	73470	she	2172	" But why do you not try to bring that time ? "
73399	73417	73470	73470	she	2172	" When you speak I believe all you say ; other people would listen to you also . "
73418	73427	73540	73540	she	2172	" I am not so sure of that , "
73462	73469	73588	73588	she	2172	" I , Waldo , I ? "
73473	73515	73622	73622	she	2172	" I will do nothing good for myself , nothing for the world , till some one wakes me . I am asleep , swathed , shut up in self ; till I have been delivered I will deliver no one . "
73530	73539	73780	73780	he	60	" To see the good and the beautiful , "
73543	73587	73793	73793	she	59	" and to have no strength to live it , is only to be Moses on the mountain of Nebo , with the land at your feet and no power to enter . It would be better not to see it . Come , "
73603	73621	73857	73857	he	60	" let us go , it is getting late . Doss is anxious for his breakfast also , "
73772	73779	73857	73857	he	60	" I made it for you , "
73787	73792	73929	73929	He	60	" I like it , "
73847	73856	73946	73946	he	60	" There is one strange thing about it , "
73869	73914	73946	73946	he	60	" I made it without these , and I felt something was wrong ; I tried many changes , and at last I let these in , and then it was right . But why was it ? They are not beautiful in themselves . "
73915	73928	74019	74019	She	59	" They relieve the monotony of the smooth leaves , I suppose . "
73939	73945	73946	73946	he	60	" The sky is monotonous , "
73949	74018	74174	74174	he	2186	" when it is blue , and yet it is beautiful . I have thought of that often ; but it is not monotony and it is not variety makes beauty . What is it ? The sky , and your face , and this box the same thing is in them all , only more in the sky and in your face . But what is it ? "
74022	74033	74235	74236	Gregory Rose	156	" So you are at your old work still . Why ,
74049	74053	74174	74174	he	2186	" she said , "
74185	74185	74286	74286	Lyndall	59	"
74186	74193	74286	74286	Lyndall	59	" But he might find it . "
74194	74219	74363	74363	Waldo	60	" Might ! but he never has and never will . Life is too short to run after mights ; we must have certainties . "
74281	74284	74363	74363	Waldo	60	" There , "
74288	74350	74286	74286	Lyndall	59	" goes a true woman one born for the sphere that some women have to fill without being born for it . How happy he would be sewing frills into his little girl 's frocks , and how pretty he would look sitting in a parlour , with a rough man making love to him ! Do n't you think so ? "
74351	74362	74286	74286	Lyndall	59	" I shall not stay here when he is master , "
74378	74408	74363	74363	Waldo	60	" I should imagine not . The rule of a woman is tyranny ; but the rule of a man - woman grinds fine . Where are you going ? "
74409	74412	74286	74286	Lyndall	59	" Anywhere . "
74413	74418	74363	74363	Waldo	60	" What to do ? "
74419	74424	74552	74552	she	2189	" See see everything . "
74425	74431	74552	74552	she	2189	" You will be disappointed . "
74432	74437	75016	75016	Waldo	60	" And were you ? "
74438	74551	75170	75170	they	2209	" Yes ; and you will be more so . I want some things that men and the world give , you do not . If you have a few yards of earth to stand on , and a bit of blue over you , and something that you can not see to dream about , you have all that you need , all that you know how to use . But I like to see real men . Let them be as disagreeable as they please , they are more interesting to me than flowers , or trees , or stars , or any other thing under the sun . Sometimes , "
74567	74634	75016	75016	Waldo	60	" when I am not too busy trying to find a new way of doing my hair that will show my little neck to better advantage , or over other work of that kind , sometimes it amuses me intensely to trace out the resemblance between one man and another : to see how Tant ' Sannie and I , you and Bonaparte , St. Simon on his

75019	75028	75170	75170	they	2209	" Yes ; but the harness is broken . "
75029	75066	75170	75170	they	2209	" Well , I wish you would mend it . You must teach me to drive . I must learn something while I am here . I got the Hottentot girl to show me how to make "
75086	75103	75206	75206	they	3470	" kapjes.í I will come and sit with you this afternoon while you mend the harness . "
75104	75108	75233	75233	she	2215	" Thank you . "
75109	75145	75558	75558	she	952	" No , do n't thank me ; I come for my own pleasure . I never find any one I can talk to . Women bore me , and men , I talk so to "
75215	75215	75558	75558	she	952	"
75223	75232	75578	75580	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Tell me when you set to work , "
75551	75557	75613	75613	she	952	" Here is another one ! "
75560	75571	75613	75613	she	952	" a widower ; I see it by his hat . "
75572	75576	75641	75642	the maid	222	" Good Lord ! "
75582	75612	75657	75659	Tant ' Sannie	53	" it 's the seventh I 've had this month ; but the men know where sheep and good looks and money in the bank are to be found , "
75619	75625	75657	75659	Tant ' Sannie	53	" How does he look ? "
75626	75639	75699	75699	I	0	" Nineteen , weak eyes , white hair , little round nose , "
75644	75655	75750	75750	his	726	" Then it 's he ! then it 's he ! "
75662	75668	75782	75784	Tant ' Sannie	53	" little Piet Vander Walt , whose

75805	75812	75843	75845	Tant ' Sannie	53	" can I off - saddle ? "

75831	75841	76143	76145	Tant ' Sannie	53	" I told you so ! I knew it ! "
75847	75857	76143	76145	Tant ' Sannie	53	" The dear Lord does n't send dreams for nothing .

76130	76141	76178	76180	the young man	726	" I was related to your aunt Selena who died , "
76147	76170	76198	76200	Tant ' Sannie	53	" My mother 's step - brother 's child was married to her father 's brother 's step - nephew 's niece . "
76171	76176	76143	76145	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Yes , aunt , "
76182	76189	76249	76251	the young man	726	" I knew we were related . "
76190	76196	76263	76265	Tant ' Sannie	53	" It was her cousin , "
76208	76241	76263	76265	Tant ' Sannie	53	" who had the cancer cut out of her breast by the other doctor , who was not the right doctor they sent for , but who did it quite as well . "
76242	76247	76325	76327	the young man	726	" Yes , aunt , "
76253	76261	76340	76342	Tant ' Sannie	53	" I 've heard about it often , "
76267	76315	76340	76342	Tant ' Sannie	53	" And he was the son of the old doctor that they say died on Christmas day ; but I do n't know if that 's true . People do tell such awful lies . Why should he die on Christmas day more than any other day ? "
76316	76323	76421	76421	Tant	53	" Yes , aunt , why ? "
76330	76338	76423	76423	Sannie	53	" Did you ever have the toothache ? "
76344	76349	76453	76453	her	214	" No , aunt . "
76350	76419	76528	76530	the young man	726	" Well , they say that doctor , not the son of the old doctor that died on Christmas day , the other that did n't come when he was sent for , he gave such good stuff for the toothache , that if you opened the bottle in the room where any one was bad they got better directly . You could see it was good stuff , "
76425	76445	76598	76600	Tant ' Sannie	53	" it tasted horrid . That was a real doctor ! He used to give a bottle so high , "
76461	76520	76607	76609	the young man	726	" you could drink at it for a month and it would n't get done , and the same medicine was good for all sorts of sicknesses croup , measles , jaundice , dropsy . Now you have to buy a new kind for each sickness . The doctors are n't so good as they used to be . "
76521	76526	76616	76618	Tant ' Sannie	53	" No , aunt , "
76584	76596	76616	76618	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Did you ever have convulsions when you were a baby ? "
76602	76605	76641	76643	the young man	726	" Yes , "
76611	76614	76641	76643	the young man	726	" Strange ! "
76620	76635	76688	76688	she	53	" I had convulsions too . Wonderful that we should be so much alike ! "
76636	76639	76765	76765	she	53	" Aunt , "
76646	76656	76782	76782	Gregory	156	" can we sit - up to - night ? "
76691	76694	76796	76798	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Yes , "
76757	76764	76813	76813	she	53	" He 's asked for them , "
76768	76780	76909	76911	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Does he want them for his horse 's sore back ? "
76791	76794	76922	76924	the young man	726	" No , "
76802	76811	76922	76924	the young man	726	" we 're going to sit - up ! "
76896	76907	76922	76924	the young man	726	" Wo n't you put your feet on my stove ? "

76974	76980	77016	77018	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Ten months , aunt . "
76981	76988	77025	77027	the young man	726	" How old was your baby ? "
76989	76996	77025	77027	the young man	726	" Three days when it died . "
76997	77014	77044	77046	Tant ' Sannie	53	" It 's very hard when we must give our husbands and wives to the Lord , "
77020	77023	77044	77046	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Very , "
77029	77038	77120	77120	she	53	" but it 's the Lord 's will . "
77039	77042	77120	77120	she	53	" Yes , "
77051	77085	77155	77157	Tant ' Sannie	53	" She was such a good wife , aunt : I 've known her break a churn - stick over a maid 's head for only letting dust come on a milk cloth . "
77109	77119	77164	77166	the young man	726	" I hope your wife made a good end , "
77123	77145	77164	77166	the young man	726	" Oh , beautiful , aunt : she said up a psalm and two hymns and a half before she died . "
77146	77153	77120	77120	she	53	" Did she leave any messages ? "
77159	77162	77164	77166	the young man	726	" No , "
77168	77192	77164	77166	the young man	726	" but the night before she died I was lying at the foot of her bed ; I felt her foot kick me . "
77193	77200	77164	77166	the young man	726	" Piet , í she said . "
77201	77210	77241	77241	I	0	" Annie , my heart , í said I. "
77211	77234	77264	77264	I	0	" My little baby that died yesterday has been here , and it stood over the waggon - box , í she said .

77380	77385	77524	77526	the young man	726	" said Tant ' Sannie .
77447	77458	77524	77526	the young man	726	" I suppose that 's why you came to me , "
77464	77505	77524	77526	the young man	726	" Yes , aunt . And pa said I ought to get married before shearing time . It is bad if there 's no one to see after things then ; and the maids waste such a lot of fat . "
77506	77515	77550	77552	Tant ' Sannie	53	" When do you want to get married ? "
77516	77522	77573	77573	she	53	" Next month , aunt , "
77534	77542	77609	77612	the Boer - woman	214	" May I kiss you , aunt ? "
77543	77548	77637	77639	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Fie ! fie ! "
77562	77572	77660	77660	she	53	" Come , draw your chair a little closer , "
77623	77630	77681	77681	she	53	" Where is Piet Vander Walt ? "
77631	77635	77880	77880	he	156	" Just gone , "
77641	77659	77880	77880	he	156	" and I am going to marry him this day four weeks . I am dead sleepy , "
77663	77679	77880	77880	he	156	" the stupid thing does n't know how to talk love - talk at all , "
77897	77900	77880	77880	he	156	" Beloved Sister ,
77901	77969	78279	78279	I	0	" IT is a long while since I last wrote to you , but I have had no time . This is the first morning I have been at home since I do n't know when . Em always expects me to go down to the farm - house in the morning ; but I did n't feel as though I could stand the ride to - day .
77970	77977	78413	78413	she	2289	" I have much news for you .
77978	78015	78619	78619	she	157	" Tant ' Sannie , Em 's Boer step - mother , is to be married to - morrow . She is gone to town to - day , and the wedding feast is to be at her
78116	78277	78619	78619	she	157	" They are going to have a grand affair to - morrow : all the Boers about are coming , and they are going to dance all night ; but I do n't think I shall dance at all ; for , as Em 's cousin says , these Boer dances are low things . I am sure I only danced at the last to please Em . I do n't know why she is so fond of dancing . Em talked of our being married on the same day as Tant ' Sannie ; but I said it would be nicer for her if she waited till the shearing was over , and I took her down to see you . I suppose she will have to live with us Em 's cousin , I mean , as she has not anything in the world but a poor fifty pounds . I do n't like her at all , Jemima ,
78437	78543	79014	79015	a man	242	" She gets the wildest horses in that buggy , and a horrid snappish little cur belonging to the German sitting in front , and then she drives out alone . I do n't think it 's at all proper for a woman to drive out alone ; I would n't allow it if she was my sister . The other morning , I do n't know how it happened , I was going in the way from which she was coming , and that little beast they call him Doss began to bark when he saw me he always does , the little wretch and the
78622	78664	79103	79103	Your	2308	" No , thank you ; I can manage them myself . I 've got a pair of bits that would break their jaws if I used them well , í and she laughed and drove away . It 's so unwomanly .
78665	78810	79103	79103	Your	2308	" Tell father my hire of the ground will not be out for six months , and before that Em and I will be married . My pair of birds is breeding now , but I have n't been down to see them for three days . I do n't seem to care about anything any more . I do n't know what it is ; I 'm not well . If I go into town on Saturday I will let the doctor examine me ; but perhaps she 'll go in herself . It 's a very strange thing , Jemima , but she never will send her letters to post by me . If I ask her she has none , and the very next day she goes in and posts them herself . You must n't say anything about it , Jemima ,
79030	79041	79103	79103	Your	2308	" Give my love to mother and the children . The "
79069	79079	79103	79103	Your	2308	" Em sends her love to you . She is making
79099	79102	79161	79161	Gregory	156	" Write soon to
79109	79134	79195	79195	Em	54	" P.S. She drove past just now ; I was sitting on the kraal wall right before her eyes , and she never even bowed .
79135	79137	79227	79227	he	156	" G.N.R. "
79146	79159	79267	79267	Gregory	156	" I DIDN'T know before you were so fond of riding hard , "
79185	79193	79267	79267	Gregory	156	" Do you call this riding hard ? "
79200	79226	79294	79294	Em	54	" Of course I do ! It 's enough to break the horses ' necks , and knock one up for the whole day besides , "
79245	79265	79294	79294	Em	54	" I thought Waldo was such a mad driver ; they are taking it easily enough to - day , "
79269	79279	79345	79345	he	156	" One would think the black stallions were lame . "
79280	79292	79363	79363	Lyndall	59	" I suppose they want to keep out of our dust , "
79296	79308	79363	79363	Lyndall	59	" See , they stand still as soon as we do . "
79320	79344	79471	79471	he	60	" It 's all that horse of yours : she kicks up such a confounded dust , I ca n't stand it myself , "
79356	79361	79497	79497	he	60	" Take the reins , "
79365	79392	79497	79497	he	60	" and make them walk . I want to rest and watch their hoofs to - day not to be exhilarated ; I am so tired . "
79476	79481	79526	79526	she	59	" What is it ? "
79482	79496	79526	79526	she	59	" I feared you had gone to sleep and might be jolted out , "
79500	79506	79600	79600	she	59	" you sat so quietly . "
79507	79521	79600	79600	she	59	" No ; do not talk to me ; I am not asleep ; "
79530	79544	79726	79726	you	60	" I hope I shall never bring a human being into the world . "
79591	79599	79744	79744	Waldo	60	" I have no conscience , none , "
79603	79633	79794	79794	God	56	" but I would not like to bring a soul into this world . When it sinned and when it suffered something like a dead hand would fall on me "
79733	79743	79912	79912	She	2331	" Soul , what have I to do with you?í "
79748	79764	79992	79992	she	2331	" It is a marvellous thing that one soul should have power to cause another . "
79789	79793	79992	79992	she	2331	" They say , "
79905	79911	80063	80064	The Devil	170	" God sends the little babies!í "
79921	79991	80093	80093	all	2339	" The small children say so earnestly . They touch the little stranger reverently who has just come from God 's far country , and they peep about the room to see if not one white feather has dropped from the wing of the angel that brought him . On their lips the phrase means much ; on all others it is a deliberate lie . Noticeable , too , "
80009	80024	80151	80151	she	2340	" when people are married , though they should have sixty children , they throw the

80138	80150	80275	80275	she	2346	" It must be very nice to believe in the Devil , "
80154	80180	80375	80375	she	2348	" I wish I did . If it would be of any use I would pray three hours night and morning on my bare knees , "
80248	80274	80375	80375	she	2348	" I myself did it , I . Not God , not Satan ; I myself!í That is the sting that strikes deep . Waldo , "
80288	80299	81357	81357	she	2310	" I like you so much , I love you . "
80309	80374	81357	81357	she	2310	" When I am with you I never know that I am a woman and you are a man ; I only know that we are both things that think . Other men when I am with them , whether I love them or not , they are mere bodies to me ; but you are a spirit ; I like you . Look , "
80385	80407	81386	81387	her lover	2009	" what a pretty pinkness there is on all the hill - tops ! The sun will rise in a moment . "
81342	81356	81386	81387	her lover	2009	" I wish you would go and ask Lyndall to dance with you , "
81360	81375	81450	81450	she	2310	" she must be so tired ; she has sat still the whole evening . "
81376	81384	81525	81525	he	156	" I have asked her three times , "
81390	81426	81557	81557	He	156	" I 'm not going to be her dog , and creep to her feet , just to give her the pleasure of kicking me not for you , Em , nor for anybody else . "
81427	81441	81557	81557	He	156	" Oh , I did n't know you had asked her , Greg , "
81533	81551	81596	81596	Gregory	156	" May I not bring you a stove , Miss Lyndall , to put your feet on ? "
81552	81556	81900	81900	He	156	" Thank you . "
81569	81587	81958	81958	she	54	" There is a draught from that broken window : shall I stuff something in the pane ? "
81588	81595	81958	81958	she	54	" No , we want air . "
81906	81915	82014	82014	he	156	" These Boer dances are very low things ; "
81952	81957	82014	82014	he	156	" Oh , come , "
81961	81987	82058	82058	he	156	" they are going to have the cushion - dance . I do not want to kiss any of these fellows . Take me quickly . "
81997	82013	82087	82087	Gregory	156	" It is so dusty , Em ; do you care to dance any more ? "
82020	82036	82099	82099	she	54	" Oh , I do not mind the dust , and the dancing rests me . "
82043	82057	82099	82099	she	54	" I feel tired ; I do not think I shall dance again , "
82079	82085	82162	82167	a group of men and boys	2415	" I have often imagined , "

82102	82132	82240	82240	He	60	" I wonder where Waldo is ; he must take me home . These people will not leave off till morning , I suppose ; it is three already . "

82221	82239	82373	82373	she	54	" is that you ? I am so dazed with the tallow candles , I see nothing . "
82263	82272	82373	82373	she	54	" I thought I should find you here , "
82284	82296	82715	82715	She	2432	" You must take me home presently , but not now . "
82359	82372	82732	82732	she	2432	" It is so nice to lie here and hear that noise , "
82376	82562	82741	82741	he	2435	" I like to feel that strange life beating up against me . I like to realise forms of life utterly unlike mine . When my own life feels small , and I am oppressed with it , I like to crush together , and see it in a picture , in an instant , a multitude of disconnected unlike phases of human life a medi?val monk with his string of beads pacing the quiet orchard , and looking up from the grass at his feet to the heavy fruit - trees ; little Malay boys playing naked on a shining sea - beach ; a Hindoo philosopher alone under his banyan tree , thinking , thinking , thinking , so that in the thought of God he may lose himself ; a troop of Bacchanalians dressed in white , with crowns of vine - leaves , dancing as they sing along the Roman streets ; a martyr on the night of his death looking through the narrow window to the sky , and feeling that already he has the wings that shall bear him up ;
82714	82714	82741	82741	he	2435	"
82724	82731	82772	82772	I	0	" Have you made any plans ? "
82737	82740	82741	82741	he	2435	" Yes , "
82754	82761	82790	82790	She	2432	" I will take the grey mare ,

82778	82782	82883	82883	she	2432	" What work ? "
82783	82789	83031	83031	I	0	" I do not know . "
82797	82882	83045	83045	you	2435	" That is no plan . If you go into the world aimless , without a definite object , dreaming , dreaming , you will be definitely defeated , bamboozled , knocked this way and that ; in the end you will stand with your beautiful life all spent , and nothing to show . They talk of genius it is nothing but this , that a man knows what he can do best , and does it , and nothing else . Waldo , "
82894	82958	83031	83031	I	0	" I wish I could help you ; I wish I could rouse you up , and make you see tht now to - day you must decide what you will be and do . It does not matter what you choose , be a farmer , business - man , artist , politician , what you will , but know your aim , and
83034	83040	83527	83527	she	2438	" she said , concisely ; "

83052	83166	83588	83588	she	214	" Suppose a woman , young , friendless as I am , the weakest thing on God 's earth . But she must make her way through life . What she would be she can not be because she is a woman ; so she looks carefully at herself and the world about her , to see where her path must lie . There is no one to help her ; she must help herself . She looks . These things she has a sweet voice , rich in subtile intonations ; a fair , very fair face , with a power of concentrating in itself , and giving expression to , feelings that otherwise
83443	83526	83688	83688	he	60	" If she does all this if she waits patiently , if she is never cast down , never despairs , never forgets her end , moves straight toward it , bending men and things most unlikely to her purpose , she must succeed at last . Men and things are plastic ; they part to the right and left when one comes among them moving in a straight line to one end . I know it by my own little experience , "
83530	83570	83688	83688	he	60	" Long years ago I resolved to be sent to school . It seemed a thing utterly out of my power ; but I waited , I watched , I collected clothes , I took my place at the school ;

83684	83687	83943	83943	We	2460	" Yes , "
83691	83722	84053	84053	You	60	" but when we lie and think , and think , we see that there is nothing worth doing . The universe is so large , and man is so small "
83729	83774	84084	84084	Your	60	" But we must not think so far ; it is madness , it is a disease . We know that no man 's work is great , and stands for ever . Moses is dead , and the prophets , and the books that our

84093	84100	84185	84185	he	60	" No , we will work , "
84164	84167	84197	84197	she	2467	" Waldo , "
84173	84180	84197	84197	she	2467	" they are laughing at us . "
84181	84184	84287	84287	he	60	" Who ? "
84191	84196	84287	84287	he	60	" They the stars ! "
84202	84274	84319	84319	he	60	" Do you not see ? there is a little white , mocking finger pointing down at us from each one of them ! We are talking of to - morrow , and to - morrow , and our hearts are so strong ; we are not thinking of something that can touch us softly in the dark and make us still forever . They are laughing at us , Waldo . "
84280	84286	84319	84319	he	60	" Do you ever pray ? "
84295	84298	84419	84419	she	2467	" No . "
84299	84318	84451	84451	She	2467	" I never do ; but I might when I look up there . I will tell you , "
84328	84387	84495	84495	he	156	" where I could pray . If there were a wall of rock on the edge of a world , and one rock stretched out far into space , and I stood alone upon it , alone with stars above me , and stars below . I would not say anything ; but the feeling would be prayer . "
84415	84418	84504	84504	she	2467	" Ah , "
84432	84450	84544	84544	she	2467	" I am cold . Span in the horses , and call me when you are ready . "
84478	84494	84576	84576	He	156	" I have been looking for you everywhere ; may I not drive you home ? "
84498	84503	84576	84576	He	156	" Waldo drives me , "
84547	84557	84662	84662	Gregory	156	" If you wish to drive me you may . "
84585	84601	84662	84662	Gregory	156	" You must ride with Waldo ; I am going to drive your cousin home . "
84602	84630	84709	84709	her	2473	" But I ca n't come just now , Greg ; I promised Tante Annie to look after the things while she went to rest a little . "
84631	84660	84750	84750	he	156	" Well , you can come presently , ca n't you ? I did n't say you were to come now . I 'm sick of this thing , "
84670	84689	84750	84750	he	156	" Why must I sit up the whole night because your step - mother chooses to get married ? "
84690	84703	84769	84769	She	2473	" Oh , it 's all right , Greg , I only meant "
84743	84749	84864	84864	she	54	" The horses are ready , "
84753	84768	84897	84897	Waldo	60	" but if you would like to have one dance more I will wait . "
84775	84788	84906	84906	she	54	" No ; I am quite ready . I want to go . "
84867	84888	84978	84978	Waldo	60	" I wonder if all people feel so old , so very old , when they get to be seventeen . "
84889	84895	85040	85040	he	60	" Not older than before , "
84910	84972	85040	85040	he	60	" I wish I could have been a little child always . You are good then . You are never selfish ; you like every one to have everything ; but when you are grown - up there are some things you like to have all to yourself , you do n't like any one else to have any of them . "
84973	84976	85077	85077	she	54	" Yes , "
85033	85039	85077	85077	she	54	" You are very tired , "
85052	85064	85207	85207	she	54	" let me go in and light a candle for you . "
85065	85076	85207	85207	she	54	" No , thank you ; it is all right , "
85080	85088	85462	85462	Lyndall	59	" Good night , Waldo , dear . "
85196	85206	85574	85574	she	54	" You can leave the old things lying about , "
85210	85229	85623	85623	he	156	" I will lock the room , and keep it waiting for you to come back some day . "
85451	85461	85623	85623	he	156	" Go and fetch me a glass of water , "
85590	85592	85673	85673	she	54	" kapje "
85614	85622	85673	85673	she	54	" I thought you were never coming , "
85638	85655	85703	85703	He	156	" You know I have been shearing all day , and it is ten o'clock already . "
85656	85672	85729	85729	he	156	" I 'm sorry . I did not think you would be going so soon , "
85680	85702	85729	85729	he	156	" I ca n't hear what you say . What makes you mumble so ? Well , good night , Em . "
85711	85721	85767	85767	she	54	" I want to talk to you , Gregory . "
85722	85728	85767	85767	she	54	" Well , make haste , "
85733	85757	85729	85729	he	156	" I 'm awfully tired . I 've been sitting here all the evening . Why could n't you come and talk before ? "
85758	85766	85841	85841	she	54	" I will not keep you long , "
85773	85793	85942	85942	his	2489	" I think , Gregory , it would be better if you and I were never to be married . "
85794	85831	85961	85961	she	54	" Good heavens ! Em , what do you mean ? I thought you were so fond of me ? You always professed to be . What on earth have you taken into your head now ? "
85832	85840	85972	85972	he	2489	" I think it would be better , "
85859	85939	85972	85972	he	2489	" Better , Em ! What do you mean ? Even a woman ca n't take a freak all about nothing ! You must have some reason for it , and I 'm sure I 've done nothing to offend you . I wrote only to - day to my sister to tell her to come up next month to our wedding , and I 've been as affectionate and happy as possible . Come what 's the matter ? "
85952	85960	86030	86030	She	54	" I think it would be better , "
85966	85971	86035	86035	him	2489	" Oh , well , "
85979	86029	86207	86207	She	2490	" if you wo n't enter into explanations you wo n't ; and I 'm not the man to beg and pray not to any woman , and you know that ! If you do n't want to marry me I ca n't oblige you to , of course . "
86037	86080	86207	86207	She	2490	" You women never do know your own minds for two days together ; and of course you know the state of your own feelings best ; but it 's very strange . Have you really made up your mind , Em ? "
86081	86084	86238	86238	You	2490	" Yes . "
86085	86206	86238	86238	You	2490	" Well , I 'm very sorry . I 'm sure I 've not been in anything to blame . A man ca n't always be billing and cooing ; but , as you say , if your feeling for me has changed , it 's much better you should n't marry me . There 's nothing so foolish as to marry some one you do n't love ; and I only wish for your happiness , I 'm sure . I daresay you 'll find some one can make you much happier than I could ; the first person we love is seldom the right one . You are very young ; it 's quite natural you should change . "
86211	86220	86293	86293	Em	54	" Things often seem hard at the time , but
86233	86237	86547	86547	she	54	" said Gregory . "
86254	86259	86566	86566	Her	54	" He stooped down . "
86295	86295	86619	86619	he	60	"
86540	86546	86619	86619	he	60	" So you are ready , "
86590	86610	86658	86658	he	60	" I wonder when we shall meet again , Waldo . What you will be , and what I ? "
86611	86618	86658	86658	he	60	" Will you write to me ? "
86624	86648	86619	86619	he	60	" Yes ; and if I should not , you can still remember , wherever you are , that you are not alone . "
86649	86657	86694	86694	They	2503	" I have left Doss for you , "
86661	86668	86704	86704	she	54	" Will you not miss him ? "
86669	86688	86725	86725	she	54	" No ; I want you to have him . He loves you better than he loves me . "
86689	86693	86741	86741	She	54	" Thank you . "
86698	86703	86794	86795	THE KOPJE	160	" Good - bye ! "
86730	86740	86938	86938	he	156	" Come back , I want to kiss you . "
86765	86772	87037	87037	he	60	" Good - bye , dear ! "
86797	86801	87037	87037	he	60	" GOOD morning ! "
86916	86937	87143	87143	he	60	" You must let me call you Em still , and be like a brother to you till I go , "
86993	87035	87143	87143	he	60	" I think I 'll just take a walk up to the camps and see how your birds are getting on . Now Waldo 's gone you 've no one to see after things . Nice morning , is n't it ? "
87041	87058	87182	87182	Em	54	" I 'll just go round to the house and get a drink of water first ; "
87136	87142	87192	87192	Gregory	156	" Awfully nice morning this , "
87160	87176	87192	87192	Gregory	156	" It is n't hot and it is n't cold . It 's awfully nice . "
87177	87180	87218	87218	Em	54	" Yes , "
87184	87190	87192	87192	Gregory	156	" Your cousin , now , "
87199	87212	87192	87192	Gregory	156	" I suppose she 's shut up in her room writing letters . "
87213	87216	87192	87192	Gregory	156	" No , "
87220	87235	87192	87192	Gregory	156	" Gone for a drive , I expect ? Nice morning for a drive . "
87236	87239	87259	87259	Em	54	" No . "
87240	87250	87298	87298	he	156	" Gone to see the ostriches , I suppose ? "
87251	87254	87298	87298	he	156	" No . "
87262	87274	87324	87324	Em	54	" I saw her go by the kraals to the kopje . "
87282	87297	87399	87399	he	156	" Well , I think I 'll just go and have a look about , "
87301	87307	87455	87455	Gregory	156	" and see how things are getting
87323	87323	87565	87565	Gregory	156	"
87429	87432	87565	87565	Gregory	156	" kopje . "
87452	87454	87567	87567	he	156	" kopje "
87554	87563	87567	87567	he	156	" I hope I am not troubling you , "
87572	87583	87565	87565	Gregory	156	" If I am I will go away . I just "
87584	87591	87633	87633	Gregory	156	" No ; you may stay . "
87592	87599	87633	87633	Gregory	156	" I fear I startled you . "
87600	87622	87633	87633	Gregory	156	" Yes ; your step was firmer than it generally is . I thought it was that of some one else . "
87623	87631	87673	87673	Gregory	156	" Who could it be but me ? "
87644	87662	87633	87633	Gregory	156	" Do you suppose you are the only man who would find anything to attract him to this "
87665	87665	87726	87726	he	156	"
87666	87671	87726	87726	he	156	" Oh , no , "
87703	87706	87755	87755	she	2523	" kopje , "
87721	87725	87792	87792	he	156	" Miss Lyndall , "
87731	87745	87867	87867	Gregory	156	" I do n't know why it is you never talk to me . "
87746	87754	87901	87901	she	2525	" We had a long conversation yesterday , "
87762	87791	87923	87923	Gregory	156	" Yes ; but you ask me questions about sheep and oxen . I do n't call that talking . You used to talk to Waldo , now , "
87802	87865	87923	87923	Gregory	156	" I 've heard you when I came in , and then you 've just left off . You treated me like that from the first day ; and you could n't tell from just looking at me that I could n't talk about the things you like . I 'm sure I know as much about such things as Waldo does , "
87875	87900	87950	87950	she	2525	" I do not know which things you refer to . If you will enlighten me I am quite prepared to speak of them , "
87909	87921	87950	87950	she	2525	" Oh , you never used to ask Waldo like that , "
87934	87941	88091	88091	he	2526	" You used just to begin . "
87942	87949	88114	88114	Gregory	156	" Well , let me see , "
87963	88081	88091	88091	he	2526	" There goes a Kaffir ; he has nothing on but a blanket ; he is a splendid fellow six feet high , with a magnificent pair of legs . In his leather bag he is going to get his rations , and I suppose to kick his wife with his beautiful legs when he gets home . He has a right to ; he bought her for two oxen . There is a lean dog going after him , to whom I suppose he never gives more than a bone from which he has sucked the marrow ; but his dog loves him , as his wife does . There is something of the master about him in
88101	88101	88091	88091	he	2526	"
88102	88112	88313	88313	he	156	" Oh , but are n't you making fun ? "
88128	88131	88313	88313	he	156	" kopje . "
88132	88224	88313	88313	he	156	" No ; I am very serious . He is the most interesting and intelligent thing I can see just now , except , perhaps , Doss . He is profoundly suggestive . Will his race melt away in the heat of a collision with a higher ? Are the men of the future to see his bones only in museums a vestige of one link that spanned between the dog and the white man ? He wakes thoughts that run far out into the future and back into the past . "
88276	88312	88432	88432	she	2529	" I 've often thought so myself . It 's funny we should both think the same ; I knew we should if once we talked . But there are other things love , now , "
88316	88354	88432	88432	she	2529	" I wonder if we would think alike about that . I wrote an essay on love once ; the master said it was the best I ever wrote , and I can remember the first sentence still "
88364	88365	88401	88401	you	156	" "
88379	88380	88432	88432	she	2529	" "
88383	88389	88432	88432	she	2529	" said Gregory , regretfully ; "
88406	88421	88678	88679	a god	724	" A look , half of abstraction , half amusement , played on her lips .
88422	88431	88692	88692	she	2539	" I do n't know much about love , "
88435	88465	88802	88802	she	2539	" and I do not like to talk of things I do not understand ; but I have heard two opinions . Some say the devil carried the seed from hell
88683	88683	88802	88802	she	2539	"
88698	88795	89069	89069	Gregory	156	" There are as many kinds of loves as there are flowers . Everlastings that never wither ; Speedwells that wait for the wind to fan them out of life ; blood - red mountain - lilies that pour their voluptuous sweetness out for one day , and lie in the dust at night . There is no flower has the charm of all the Speedwell 's purity , the Everlasting 's strength , the mountain - lily 's warmth ; but who knows whether there is no love that holds all friendship , passion , worship !
88796	88801	89069	89069	Gregory	156	" Such a love , "
88810	88865	89089	89089	Gregory	156	" will fall on the surface of strong , cold , selfish life as the sunlight falls on a torpid winter world ; there , where the trees are bare , and the ground frozen , till it rings to the step like iron , and the water is solid , and the air is sharp
89062	89067	89089	89089	Gregory	156	" she asked , looking down
89071	89081	89121	89121	her	59	" Is that how you like me to talk ? "
89082	89087	89133	89133	Gregory	156	" Oh , yes , "
89091	89111	89299	89299	Gregory	156	" that is what I have already thought . We have the same thoughts about everything . How strange ! "
89112	89115	89306	89306	she	59	" Very , "
89179	89186	89339	89339	Gregory	156	" Battle of Hohenlinden , í and "
89290	89297	89339	89339	Gregory	156	" You have hurt that dog , "
89301	89305	89401	89401	he	156	" Have I ? "
89327	89337	89448	89448	He	2543	" He 's a nasty , snappish little cur ! "
89352	89392	89495	89495	she	59	" He snapped at my horse 's tail yesterday , and nearly made it throw me . I wonder his master did n't take him , instead of leaving him here to be a nuisance to all of us ! "
89406	89437	89541	89541	He	2543	" Do you think now , Miss Lyndall , that he 'll ever have anything in the world that German . I mean money enough to support a wife on , and
89455	89455	89569	89569	Gregory	156	"
89476	89494	89583	89583	Lyndall	59	" I think I should be rather astonished if he ever became a respectable member of society , "
89554	89554	89583	89583	Lyndall	59	"
89555	89567	89633	89633	He	2543	" Yes ; I do n't expect anything of him either , "
89573	89581	89682	89682	he	156	" Well , I do n't know , "
89585	89605	89682	89682	he	156	" there are some small things I rather look to him for . If he were to invent wings , or
89659	89659	89793	89793	Gregory	156	"
89673	89681	89793	89793	Gregory	156	" Well , I do n't know , "
89686	89759	89811	89811	Lyndall	59	" to me he looks like a fool . To walk about always in that dead - and - alive sort of way , muttering to himself like an old Kaffir witch - doctor ! He works hard enough , but it 's always as though he did n't know what he was doing . You do n't know how he looks to a person who sees him for the first time . "
89785	89791	89811	89811	Lyndall	59	" But , Miss Lyndall , "
89795	89804	89793	89793	Gregory	156	" what do you really think of him ? "
89805	89809	89860	89860	Gregory	156	" I think , "
89813	89829	89864	89864	Lyndall	59	" that he is like a thorn - tree , which grows up very quietly , without
89847	89847	89927	89927	Gregory	156	"
89848	89858	89927	89927	Gregory	156	" And what do you think I am like ? "
89871	89909	89864	89864	Lyndall	59	" Like a little tin duck floating on a dish of water , that comes after a piece of bread stuck on a needle , and the more the needle pricks it the more it comes on . "
89910	89925	89927	89927	Gregory	156	" Oh , you are making fun of me now , you really are ! "
89931	89943	89864	89864	Lyndall	59	" You are making fun , are n't you , now ? "
89944	89955	90022	90022	she	2551	" Partly . It is always diverting to make comparisons . "
89956	89982	90041	90041	Gregory	156	" Yes ; but you do n't compare me to anything nice , and you do other people . What is Em like , now ? "
89983	90013	90041	90041	Gregory	156	" The accompaniment of a song . She fills up the gaps in other people 's lives , and is always number two ; but I think she is like many
90027	90027	90097	90097	he	156	"
90028	90039	90097	90097	he	156	" She is not half so good as you are ! "
90050	90088	90133	90133	Gregory	156	" She is so much better than I , that her little finger has more goodness in it than my whole body . I hope you may not live to find out the truth of that fact . "
90089	90096	90133	90133	Gregory	156	" You are like an angel , "
90109	90120	90220	90220	she	2552	" Yes , probably ; angels are of many orders . "
90121	90131	90220	90220	she	2552	" You are the one being that I love ! "
90136	90212	90263	90263	he	2553	" I thought I loved before , but I know now ! Do not be angry with me . I know you could never like me ; but , if I might but always be near you to serve you , I would be utterly , utterly happy . I would ask nothing in return ! If you could only take everything I have and use it ; I want nothing but to see you . "
90213	90219	90263	90263	he	2553	" How do you know , "
90224	90239	90371	90371	he	2553	" that I would not be willing to marry you if you asked me ? "
90251	90262	90371	90371	he	2553	" You are very cruel ; you are ridiculing me , "
90266	90324	90454	90454	he	2555	" No , I am not , Gregory . What I am saying is plain , matter - of - fact business . If you are willing to marry me within three weeks ' time , I am willing to marry you , if not , not . That is a clear proposal , is it not ? "
90363	90370	90477	90477	They	2554	" Do you really mean it ? "
90374	90409	90488	90488	he	2553	" Yes . You wish to be near me , and to serve me , and to have nothing in return ? you shall have what you wish . I believe you love me ; I
90449	90453	90488	90488	he	2553	" she added ; "
90476	90476	90526	90526	he	2553	"
90480	90483	90526	90526	he	2553	" kopje . "
90491	90505	90562	90562	she	2553	" Would you not take my arm ? the path is very rough . "
90514	90525	90562	90562	she	2553	" I would try to make everything beautiful for you , "
90529	90537	90627	90627	you	2553	" but now there is not time . "
90538	90561	90651	90651	he	2553	" It does not matter . I may yet change my mind about marrying you before the time comes . Mark you ! "
90570	90611	90806	90806	she	59	" I remember your words : You will give everything , and expect nothing . The knowledge that you are serving me is to be your reward ; and you will have that . You will serve me , and greatly .
90637	90637	90825	90825	Lyndall	59	"
90638	90650	90845	90845	she	59	" I only want to be of some use to you , "
90793	90805	90845	90845	she	59	" I want to say good night to you , Lyndall , "
90817	90824	90937	90937	her	3445	" I thought you were asleep , "
90828	90844	90989	90989	Lyndall	59	" Yes , I have been asleep ; but I had such a vivid dream , "
90854	90869	90998	90998	She	3445	" and that woke me . I never had so vivid a dream before . "
90942	90955	91084	91084	Lyndall	59	" Hush ! it is a little dead baby.í And I said , "
90972	90986	91084	91084	Lyndall	59	" And they put their faces close down to my ear and whispered , "
90992	90997	91164	91164	I	0	" And I said , "
91031	91083	91173	91173	dear	3635	" And when I came to some people who were dressed in black , I asked them where you were , and they looked down at their black clothes , and shook their heads , and said nothing ; and I could not find you anywhere . And then I woke . "
91086	91100	91171	91171	you	59	" she said , putting her face down upon the hands she held , "
91168	91169	91232	91232	she	59	" "
91175	91179	91429	91429	her	2579	" Lyndall said . "
91196	91196	91460	91460	She	2579	"
91235	91248	91507	91507	he	405	" There are some wiser in their sleeping than in their waking . "
91434	91442	91507	91507	he	405	" I thought you were not coming . "
91443	91459	91507	91507	he	405	" I waited till all had gone to bed . I could not come before . "
91493	91506	91507	91507	he	405	" I hardly see why I should be outlawed after this fashion , "
91524	91545	91507	91507	he	405	" these are hardly the quarters one expects to find after travelling a hundred miles in answer to an invitation . "
91546	91550	91507	91507	he	405	" I said , "
91555	91555	91606	91606	he	405	"
91556	91569	91606	91606	he	405	" And I did wish . You give me a cold reception . "
91570	91592	91703	91703	She	2581	" I could not take you to the house . Questions would be asked which I could not answer without prevarication . "
91593	91605	91703	91703	She	2581	" Your conscience is growing to have a certain virgin tenderness , "
91616	91679	91606	91606	he	405	" I have no conscience . I spoke one deliberate lie this evening . I said the man who had come looked rough , we had best not have him in the house ; therefore I brought him here . It was a deliberate lie , and I hate lies . I tell them if I must , but they hurt me . "
91680	91702	91739	91744	this fellow you talk of marrying	2583	" Well , you do not tell lies to yourself , at all events . You are candid , so far . "
91707	91714	91606	91606	he	405	" You got my short letter ? "
91715	91727	91703	91703	She	2581	" Yes ; that is why I come . You sent a very
91746	91746	91739	91744	this fellow you talk of marrying	2583	"
91747	91752	91606	91606	he	405	" A young farmer . "
91753	91757	91606	91606	he	405	" Lives here ? "
91758	91773	91703	91703	She	2581	" Yes ; he has gone to town to get things for our wedding . "
91774	91783	91606	91606	he	405	" What kind of a fellow is he ? "
91784	91788	91824	91824	he	2583	" A fool . "
91789	91799	91846	91846	she	2581	" And you would rather marry him than me ? "
91800	91809	91846	91846	she	2581	" Yes ; because you are not one . "
91810	91823	91907	91907	you	2581	" That is a novel reason for refusing to marry a man , "
91838	91845	91962	91962	he	341	" It is a wise one , "
91850	91906	91962	91962	he	341	" If I marry him I shall shake him off my hand when it suits me . It is three weeks since I first talked of marrying him , and he has not once dared to kiss my hand . As far as I wish he should come , he comes , and no further . Would
91920	91920	91931	91931	his	341	"
91949	91961	92032	92032	she	2581	" What have you done with the ring I gave you ? "
91965	92000	92032	92032	she	2581	" Sometimes I wear it ; then I take it off and wish to throw it into the fire ; the next day I put it on again , and sometimes I kiss it . "
92001	92010	92071	92071	he	2585	" So you do love me a little ? "
92011	92031	92071	92071	he	2585	" If you were not something more to me than any other man in the world , do you think "
92035	92055	92124	92124	he	2585	" I love you when I see you ; but when you are away from me I hate you . "
92056	92070	92124	92124	he	2585	" Then I fear I must be singularly invisible at the present moment , "
92074	92091	92110	92110	her	2581	" Possibly if you were to look less fixedly into the fire you might perceive me . "
92116	92123	92256	92256	he	2586	" If you do love me , "
92128	92136	92256	92256	he	2586	" why will you not marry me ? "
92137	92243	92329	92329	I	0	" Because , if I had been married to you for a year I should have come to my senses and seen that your hands and your voice are like the hands and the voice of any other man . I can not quite see that now . But it is all madness . You call into activity one part of my nature ; there is a higher part that you know nothing of , that you never touch . If I married you , afterwards it would arise and assert itself , and I should hate you always , as I do now sometimes . "
92244	92255	92364	92364	he	2586	" I like you when you grow metaphysical and analytical , "
92266	92277	92364	92364	he	2586	" Go a little further in your analysis , say , "
92337	92337	92592	92592	herself	2596	"
92355	92363	92592	92592	herself	2596	" You are acting foolishly , Lyndall , "
92377	92499	92611	92611	you	2590	" most foolishly . You are acting like a little child ; I am surprised at you . It is all very well to have ideals and theories ; but you know as well as any one can that they must not be carried into the practical world . I love you . I do not pretend that it is in any high , superhuman sense ; I do not say that I should like you as well if you were ugly and deformed , or that I should continue to prize you whatever your treatment of me might be , or to love you though you were a spirit without any body at all . That is sentimentality for beardless boys .
92569	92569	92611	92611	you	2590	"
92570	92588	92800	92801	The stranger	418	" Yes go on . Do not grow sorry for me . Say what you were going to "
92626	92633	92800	92801	The stranger	418	" Then she added after a pause ,
92634	92696	92918	92918	he	418	" I believe you do love me , as much as you possibly could love anything ; and I believe that when you ask me to marry you , you are performing the most generous act you ever have performed in the course of your life , or ever will ; but , at the same time , if I had required your
92744	92799	92921	92921	He	418	" Poor little Devil!í you would have said , and torn it up . The next week you would have sailed for Europe , and have sent me a check for a hundred and fifty pounds which I would have thrown in the fire , and I would have heard no more of you . "
92804	92897	93013	93013	He	418	" But because I declined your proposal , and wrote that in three weeks I should be married to another , then what you call love woke up . Your man 's love is a child 's love for butterflies . You follow till you have the thing , and break it . If you have broken one wing , and the thing flies still , then you love it more than ever , and follow till you break both ; then you are satisfied when it lies still on the ground . "
92898	92917	93013	93013	He	418	" You are profoundly wise in the ways of the world ; you have seen far into life , "
92931	92990	93013	93013	He	418	" I have seen enough to tell me that you love me because you can not bear to be resisted , and want to master me . You liked me at first because I treated you and all men with indifference . You resolved to have me because I seemed unattainable . This is all your love means . "
93017	93055	93013	93013	He	418	" Well , since you will not marry me , may I inquire what your intentions are , the plan you wrote of . You asked me to come and hear it , and I have come . "
93056	93060	93104	93104	she	2600	" I said , "
93081	93082	93159	93159	she	2600	" "
93085	93095	93159	93159	she	2600	" She was still looking beyond him at the fire .
93096	93103	93207	93207	he	2601	" I can not marry you , "
93108	93158	93207	93207	he	2601	" because I can not be tied ; but if you wish , you may take me away with you , and take care of me ; then when we do not love any more we can say good - bye . I will not go down - country , "
93162	93199	93244	93244	She	2600	" I will not go to Europe . You must take me to the Transvaal . That is out of the world . People we meet there we need not see again in our future lives . "
93200	93206	93207	93207	he	2601	" Oh , my darling , "
93221	93243	93244	93244	She	2600	" why will you not give yourself entirely to me ? One day you will desert me and go to another . "
93253	93268	93333	93333	You	2603	" No , life is too long . But I will go with you . "
93269	93272	93350	93350	he	2601	" When ? "
93273	93306	93695	93695	he	2601	" To - morrow . I have told them that before daylight I go to the next farm . I will write from the town and tell them the facts . I do not
93342	93342	93695	93695	he	2601	"
93353	93379	93706	93706	She	2604	" It is better to have you on those conditions than not at all . If you will have it , let it be so . "
93689	93694	93733	93733	She	2604	" Poor little thing ! "
93698	93705	93771	93771	he	2601	" you are only a child . "
93722	93728	93829	93829	He	2601	" You are very tired ? "
93729	93732	93813	93813	he	2601	" Yes . "
93765	93770	93871	93871	He	2601	" Poor little thing ! "
93845	93855	93875	93875	she	2604	" Do n't you want to talk to me ? "
93856	93859	93894	93894	They	2613	" No . "
93860	93870	93988	93988	she	2604	" Have you forgotten the night in the avenue ? "
93880	93889	93991	93992	The stranger	418	" Do you want to be quiet now ? "
93890	93893	94046	94046	She	2604	" Yes . "
93982	93987	94093	94093	she	2604	" I must go , "
94001	94026	94111	94111	She	2604	" Keep it close around your face , Lyndall ; it is very damp outside . Shall I walk with you to the house ? "
94027	94045	94320	94320	she	1161	" No . Lie down and rest ; I will come and wake you at three o'clock . "
94100	94106	94353	94353	she	1161	" Have you forgotten anything ? "
94107	94110	94353	94353	she	1161	" No . "
94310	94319	94353	94353	she	1161	" I shall never come to you again , "
94338	94352	94461	94461	I	0	" Dear old man , good old man , I am so tired ! "
94374	94384	94502	94503	no one	237	" I am so tired . There is light , there
94388	94392	94782	94782	she	2629	" she wailed ; "
94450	94460	94929	94929	she	2629	" She pressed her cheek against the wooden post . "
94507	94507	94929	94929	she	2629	"
94770	94781	94969	94969	they	2644	" Fifty pounds for a lover ! A noble reward ! "
94918	94928	95006	95006	you	2646	" We are all alone , you and I , "
94932	94949	95056	95056	She	2629	" no one helps us , no one understands us ; but we will help ourselves . "
94998	95005	95053	95053	she	2629	" We shall never be quite alone ,
95010	95014	95056	95056	She	2629	" she said ; "

96434	96441	96468	96468	he	156	" I am not coming back . "
96442	96450	96527	96527	She	54	" Are you going to your friends ? "

96548	96589	96637	96637	her	54	" Yes , I do . She was in Bloemfontein when I heard last . I will go there , and I will find out where she went then , and then , and then ! I will have her . "

96614	96632	96640	96640	she	54	" she does not want us ; she told us so clearly in the letter she wrote . "
96643	96663	96736	96736	He	2684	" It will only be pain to you , Gregory . Will she like to have you near her ? "
96692	96697	96751	96751	he	2684	" I am going . "

96742	96750	96823	96823	he	2684	" People say , forget , forget ! "

Who am I , what am I , that she should look at me ? It was right that she left me ; right that she should not look at me . If any one says it is not , it is a lie ! I am not going to speak to her , "
97135	97154	97558	97558	She	54	" only to see her ; only to stand sometimes in a place where she has stood before . "

98241	98247	98309	98309	he	2697	" Where has he been ? "
98260	98275	98309	98309	he	2697	" How the wind blows ! One can hardly hear one 's own voice , "
98279	98300	98387	98387	he	2697	" Take this warm cake ; no one 's cakes are like mine . Why , you have eaten nothing ! "
98301	98308	98387	98387	he	2697	" I am a little weary , "
98312	98321	98694	98694	he	2697	" the wind was mad to - night . "
98378	98386	98853	98854	my master	2706	" I will write a few lines , "
98390	98401	98884	98884	he	2706	" till you are ready to sit down and talk . "
98702	98793	99174	99174	I	0	" and then I got to the next town , and my horse was tired , so I could go no further , and looked for work . A shop - keeper agreed to hire me as salesman . He made me sign a promise to remain six months , and he gave me a little empty room at the back of the store to sleep in . I had still three pounds of my own , and when you just come from the country three pounds seems a great deal .
98794	98828	99253	99253	he	2709	" When I had been in the shop three days I wanted to go away again . A clerk in a shop has the lowest work to do of all the people . It is
98888	99021	99253	99253	he	2709	" I found out afterward he was only giving me half as much as he gave to the others that was why . I had fear when I looked at the other clerks that I would at last become like them . All day they were bowing and smirking to the women who came in ; smiling , when all they wanted was to get their money from them . They used to run and fetch the dresses and ribbons to show them , and they seemed to me like worms with oil on . There was one respectable thing in that store it was the Kaffir storeman . His work was to load and unload , and he never needed to smile except when he liked , and he never told lies .
99022	99173	99253	99253	he	2709	" The other clerks gave me the name of Old Salvation ; but there was one person I liked very much . He was clerk in another store . He often went past the door . He seemed to me not like others his face was bright and fresh like a little child 's . When he came to the shop I felt I liked him . One day I saw a book in his pocket , and that , made me feel near him . I asked him if he was fond of reading , and he said , yes , when there was nothing else to do . The next day he came to me , and asked me if I did not feel lonely ; he never saw me going out with the other fellows ; he would come and see me that evening , he said . "
99242	99243	99352	99352	he	2709	" "
99256	99299	99378	99378	he	2709	" You see there was nothing in it but packing - cases for furniture , and it was rather empty . While I was putting the food on the box he looked at my books ; he read their names out aloud . "
99304	99307	99378	99378	he	2709	" First Principles.í "
99308	99313	99470	99470	he	2709	" Golly!í he said ; "
99364	99369	99623	99623	he	2709	" Black - eyed Creole.í "
99381	99408	99623	99623	he	2709	" there where the fellow takes the nigger - girl by the arm , and the other fellow cuts it off ! That 's what I like.í "
99442	99450	99623	99623	he	2709	" When he had finished eating he did not
99544	99619	99656	99656	I	0	" After he was gone my little room got back to its old look . I loved it so ; I was so glad to get into it at night , and it seemed to be reproaching me for bringing him there . The next day he took the grey mare . On Thursday he did not bring her back , and on Friday I found the saddle and bridle standing at my door . "
99633	99634	99798	99798	he	2723	" "
99679	99746	99798	99798	he	2723	" But I sprung over the counter , and got him by his throat . My father was so gentle with her ; he never would ride her up - hill , and now this fellow had murdered her ! I asked him where he had killed her , and I shook him till he slipped out of my hand . He stood in the door grinning .
99747	99748	99798	99798	he	2723	" "
99801	99828	100089	100089	he	2726	" and if you think I 've jumped her , you 'd better go and look yourself . You 'll find her along the road by the "

99837	99881	100041	100041	he	2726	" I caught him by his collar , and I lifted him from the ground , and I threw him out into the street , half - way across it . I heard the book - keeper say to the clerk that there was always
99898	100034	100089	100089	he	2726	" I am writing to you of very small things , but there is nothing else to tell ; it has been all small and you will like it . Whenever anything has happened I have always thought I would tell it to you . The back thought in my mind is always you . After that only one old man came to visit me . I had seen him in the streets often ; he always wore very dirty black clothes , and a hat with crape round it , and he had one eye , so I noticed him . One day he came to my room with a subscription - list for a minister 's salary . When I said I had nothing to give he looked at me with his one eye .

100174	100224	100727	100728	the boy	234	" He would not go till I gave him half - a - crown for the minister 's salary . Afterward I heard he was the man who collected the pew - rents , and got a per centage . I did n't get to know any one else . "
100247	100298	100727	100728	the boy	234	" That first morning , when I sat in the front and called to my oxen , and saw nothing about me but the hills with the blue coming down to them , and the karroo bushes , I was drunk ; I laughed ; my heart was throbbing till it hurt

I ate as much as I could , and then lay down on my

I think sometimes when I walked by my oxen I called to them in my sleep , for I know I thought of nothing ; I was like an animal . My body was strong and well to work , but my brain was dead . If you have not felt it , Lyndall , you can not understand it . You may work , and work , and work , till you are only a body , not a soul . Now , when I see one of those evil - looking men that come from Europe navvies , with the beast - like , sunken face , different from any Kaffir 's I know what brought that look into their eyes ; and if I have only one inch of tobacco I give them half . It is work , grinding , mechanical work , that they or their ancestors have done , that has made them into beasts . You may work a man 's body so that his soul dies . Work is good . I have worked at the old farm from the

I know all about it.í When I turned my head from him I saw the earth , so pure after the rain , so green , so fresh , so blue ; and I was a drunken carrier , whom his leader had picked up in the mud , and laid at the roadside to sleep out his drunken booze . I remember my old life , and I remember you . I saw how , one day , you would read in the papers "
101737	101789	101932	101932	he	2775	" I do not know why I kept on working so hard for that master . I think it was as the oxen come every day and stand by the yokes ; they do not know why . Perhaps I would have been with him still ; but one day we started with

We tried for a little time , then I told him it was no use , they could never do it . He swore louder and called to the leaders to come on with their whips , and

102361	102415	102658	102658	You	2806	" The thing was just dying . He opened his clasp - knife and stooped down over it . I do not know what I did then . But afterward I know I had him on the stones , and I was kneeling on him . The boys dragged me off . I wish they

102713	102763	103677	103677	they	2840	" I got to the beach that afternoon , and I saw the water run up and down on the sand , and I saw the white foam breakers ; they were pretty , but I thought I would go back the next day . It was not my sea .
102764	102840	103697	103697	she	2841	" But I began to like it when I sat by it that night in the moonlight ; and the next day I liked it better ; and before I left I loved it . It was not like the sky and stars , that talk of what has no beginning and no end ; but it is so human . Of all the things I have ever seen , only the sea is like a human

When they got out he helped the ladies into a phaeton , and stood for a moment with his foot on the step talking to them . He had a little cane in his hand , and an Italian greyhound ran after him .

103763	103875	103884	103884	I	0	" I stayed in my situation four months after that , but I was not happy . I had no rest . The people about me pressed on me , and made me dissatisfied . I could not forget them . Even when I did not see them they pressed on me , and made me miserable . I did not love books ; I wanted people . When I walked home under the shady trees in the street I could not be happy , for when I passed the houses I heard music , and saw faces between the curtains . I did not want any of them , but I wanted
103890	103952	104219	104219	He	2846	" Only one day something made me happy . A nurse came to the store with a little girl belonging to one of our clerks . While the maid went into the office to give a message to its father , the little child stood looking at me . Presently she came close to me and peeped up into my face . "
103953	103964	104277	104277	He	2846	" Nice curls , pretty curls , í she said ; "
103968	104058	104713	104715	the little girl	2857	" She felt my hair all over , with her little hands . When I put out my arm she let me take her and sit her on my knee . She kissed me with her soft mouth . We were happy till the nurse - girl came and shook the little one , and asked her if she was not ashamed to sit on the knee of that strange man . But I do not think my little one minded . She laughed at me as she went out .
104059	104218	104896	104896	she	54	" If the world was all children I could like it ; but men and women draw me so strangely , and then press me away , till I am in agony . I was not meant to live among people . Perhaps some day , when I am grown older , I will be able to go and live among them and look at them as I look at the rocks and bushes , without letting them disturb me , and take myself from me ; but not now . So I grew miserable ; a kind of fever seemed to eat me ; I could not rest , or read , or think ; so I came here . I knew you were not here , but it seemed as though I should be nearer you ; and it is you I want you that the other people suggest to me , but can not give . "
104293	104348	104952	104952	she	54	" It has been a delightful journey , this journey home . I have walked on foot . The evening before last , when it was just sunset , I was a little footsore and thirsty , and went out of the road to look for water . I went down into a deep little "

I am very helpless ; I shall never do anything ; but you will work , and I will take your work for mine . Sometimes such a sudden gladness seizes me when I remember that somewhere in the world you are living and working . You are my very own ; nothing else is my own so . When I have finished I am going to look at your room door "

111053	111090	111217	111217	she	2978	" and throw this book out ? It is so utterly foolish . I thought it was a nice book ; but the words are merely strung together , they make no sense . Yes so ! "
111105	111119	111217	111217	she	2978	" I must have been very foolish when I thought that book nice . "
111150	111170	111466	111466	she	2978	" I wish you would take a handkerchief and tie it tight round my head , it aches so . "
111198	111216	111475	111475	he	156	" I am not accustomed to so much light , it makes my head swim a little , "

111460	111465	111523	111523	she	2978	" Who was that ? "
111469	111474	111523	111523	she	2978	" An old man , "
111478	111500	111564	111564	he	156	" a very old man ; they say he was ninety - four ; but his name I do not know . "
111512	111522	111596	111596	she	2978	" That is why the bell rang so cheerfully , "
111526	111555	111639	111639	she	2978	" When the old die it is well ; they have had their time . It is when the young die that the bells weep drops of blood . "
111556	111563	111639	111639	she	2978	" But the old love life ? "
111583	111595	111715	111715	They	3116	" They love life , they do not want to die , "
111599	111638	111804	111804	she	2978	" but what of that ? They have had their time . They knew that a man 's life is three - score years and ten ; they should have made their plans accordingly ! But the young , "
111642	111701	111841	111841	she	2978	" the young , cut down , cruelly , when they have not seen , when they have not known , when they have not found it is for them that the bells weep blood . I heard in the ringing it was an old man . When the old die Listen to the bell ! it is laughing "

111848	111903	111968	111968	She	2978	" Will you presently take my cloak the new grey cloak from behind the door and go with it . You will find a little grave at the foot of the tall blue gum - tree ; the water drips off the long , pointed leaves ; you must cover it up with that . "
111926	111932	112029	112029	She	2978	" It was so small , "
111936	111967	112029	112029	She	2978	" it lived such a little while only three hours . They laid it close by me , but I never saw it ; I could feel it by me . "
111971	112001	112063	112063	she	2978	" Its feet were so cold ; I took them in my hand to make them warm , and my hand closed right over them they were so little . "
112010	112028	112272	112272	she	3133	" It crept close to me ; it wanted to drink , it wanted to be warm . "
112034	112061	112272	112272	she	3133	" I did not love it ; its father was not my prince ; I did not care for it ; but it was so little . "
112069	112105	112358	112358	his	3134	" They might have kissed it , one of them , before they put it in . It never did any one any harm in all its little life . They might have kissed it . "

I have learnt to love you more wisely , more tenderly , than of old ; you shall have perfect freedom . Lyndall , grand little woman , for your own sake be my wife !

112490	112534	112685	112685	she	3136	" I thank you much for the love you have shown me ; but I can not listen . You will call me mad , foolish the world would do so ; but I know what I need and the kind of path I must

112965	112978	112996	112996	she	3136	" and it crept right in and I was alone with it . "
112979	112985	113053	113053	he	156	" What do you fear ? "

It was not cut short , and in the end it learnt , through tears and much pain , that holiness is an infinite compassion for others ; that greatness is to take the common things of life and walk grandly

He would have lifted her down from the bed when he had finished , but she pushed him from her , laughing very softly . It was the first time she had laughed in those long , dreary months .

And the books were opened , and the dead were judged from those things which were written in the books . And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire , which is the second death . í Yes ; you shall see her again . She died so with her knee unbent , with her hand unraised , with a prayer unuttered , in the pride of her intellect and the strength of her youth . She loved and she was loved ; but she said no prayer to God ; she cried for no mercy ; she repented of no sin . Yes ; you shall see her again . "
116811	116825	116905	116905	he	3222	" Ha , I have long ceased to hearken to your hellish voice . "

The All - Father will show her to you again ; not spirit only the little hands , the little feet you loved , you shall lie down and kiss them if you will . Christ arose , and did eat and drink , so shall she arise . The dead , all the dead , raised incorruptible ! God is love . You shall see her again . "
117042	117178	117212	117213	any one	504	" The thing I loved was a woman proud and young ; it had a mother once , who , dying , kissed her little baby , and prayed God that she might see it again . If it had lived the loved thing would itself have had a son , who , when he closed the weary eyes and smoothed the wrinkled forehead of his mother , would have prayed God to see that old face smile again in the Here - after . To the son heaven will be no heaven if the sweet worn face is not in one of the choirs ; he will look for it through the phalanx of God 's glorified angels ; and the youth will look for the maid , and the mother for the baby .

117238	117361	117562	117562	he	3229	" What have you to do with flesh , the gross and miserable garment in which spirit hides itself ? You shall see her again . But the hand , the foot , the forehead you loved , you shall see no more . The loves , the fears , the frailties that are born with the flesh , with the flesh they shall die . Let them die ! There is that in man that can not die a seed , a germ an embryo , a spiritual essence . Higher than she was on earth , as the tree is higher than the seed , the man than the embryo , so shall you behold her ; changed , glorified ! "
117478	117487	117621	117621	he	3229	" Change is death , change is death , "
117491	117522	117621	117621	he	3229	" I want no angel , only she ; no holier and no better , with all her sins upon her , so give her me or give me nothing ! "
117556	117561	117762	117762	he	60	" Change is death , "
117565	117620	117762	117762	he	60	" change is death ! Who dares to say the body never dies , because it turns again to grass and flowers ? And yet they dare to say the spirit never dies , because in space some strange unearthly being may have sprung up upon its ruins . Leave me ! Leave me ! "
117627	117641	117817	117817	I	0	" Give me back what I have lost , or give me nothing ! "
117747	117761	117762	117762	he	60	" There must be a Here - after because man longs for it ? "
117765	117816	117924	117924	he	60	" Is not all life from the cradle to the grave one long yearning for that which we never touch ? There must be a Here - after because we can not think of any end to life . Can we think of a beginning ? Is it easier to say "
117823	117842	117924	117924	he	60	" I shall not beí ? And yet , where were we ninety years ago ? Dreams , dreams !
117854	117854	118037	118037	He	60	"
117916	117923	118116	118116	he	60	" All dies , all dies ! "
117927	118017	118116	118116	he	60	" the roses are red with the matter that once reddened the cheek of the child ; the flowers bloom the fairest on the last year 's battle - ground ; the work of death 's finger cunningly wreathed over is at the heart of all things , even of the living . Death 's finger is everywhere . The rocks are built up of a life that was . Bodies , thoughts , and loves die : from where springs that whisper to the tiny soul of man , "
118036	118036	118367	118367	His	3254	"
118108	118115	119050	119052	Tant ' Sannie	53	" No death , no death , "
118119	118223	119050	119052	Tant ' Sannie	53	" there is that which never dies which abides . It is but the individual that perishes , the whole remains . It is the organism that vanishes , the atoms are there . It is but the man that dies , the Universal Whole of which he is part reworks him into its inmost self . Ah , what matter that man 's day be short ! that the sunrise sees him , and the sunset sees his grave ; that of which he is but the breath has breathed him forth and drawn him back again . That abides we abide . "
118296	118318	119104	119104	she	53	" Let us die , beloved , you and I , that we may pass on forever through the Universal Life ! "
119036	119048	119104	119104	she	53	" You take it and get into the cart with it , "
119054	119068	119173	119174	my child	4091	" What do you want here , listening to our woman 's talk ? "
119082	119097	119205	119205	Em	54	" I 'm very glad you are going to be married , my child , "
119114	119118	119226	119228	Tant ' Sannie	53	" I would n't say
119178	119178	119173	119174	my child	4091	"
119179	119203	119326	119328	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Perhaps it might not suit all people , at all times , as well as it suits you , Tant ' Sannie , "
119218	119224	119366	119366	she	53	" Not suit every one ! "
119230	119324	119449	119449	she	53	" If the beloved Redeemer did n't mean men to have wives what did He make women for ? That 's what I say . If a woman 's old enough to marry and does n't she 's sinning against the Lord it 's a wanting to know better than Him . What , does she think the Lord took all that trouble in making her for nothing ? It 's evident He wants babies , otherwise why does He send them ? Not that I 've done much in that way myself , "
119332	119340	119449	119449	she	53	" but I 've done my best . "
119358	119365	119544	119545	a man	242	" It 's a strange thing , "
119369	119442	119587	119587	she	53	" but you ca n't love a man till you 've had a baby by him . Now there 's that boy there , when we were first married if he only sneezed in the night I boxed his ears ; now if he lets his pipe - ash come on my milk - cloths I do n't think of laying a finger on him . There 's nothing like being married , "
119455	119529	119632	119632	she	53	" If a woman 's got a baby and a husband she 's got the best things the Lord can give her ; if only the baby does n't have convulsions . As for a husband , it 's very much the same who one has . Some men are fat , and some men are thin ; some men drink brandy , and some men drink gin ; but it all comes to the

119590	119631	119791	119791	He	156	" I hope you 'll have as many children in five years as a cow has calves , and more too . I think I 'll just go and have a look at your soap - pot before I start , "
119639	119683	119834	119834	she	53	" Not that I believe in this new plan of putting soda in the pot . If the dear Father had meant soda to be put into soap what would He have made milk - bushes for , and stuck them all over the "

119839	119890	120162	120165	the Boer - woman	214	" It 's with all these new inventions that the wrath of God must fall on us . What were the children of Israel punished for , if it was n't for making a golden calf ? I may have my sins , but I do remember the tenth commandment . "
119982	119995	120209	120211	Tant ' Sannie	53	" said Tant ' Sannie , with the serenity of conscious virtue , "
120104	120121	120254	120256	Tant ' Sannie	53	" said Tant ' Sannie sorrowfully , thinking of the splendid chance which this generation had lost .
120135	120160	120254	120256	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Depend upon it you 'll get the itch , or some other disease ; the blessing of the Lord'll never rest upon it , "

120258	120337	120520	120522	Tant ' Sannie	53	" I had almost forgotten to tell you . By the Lord if I had him here ! We were walking to church last Sacrament Sunday , Piet and I. Close in front of us with old Tant ' Trana , with dropsy and cancer , and ca n't live eight months . Walking by her was something with its hands under its coat - tails , flap , flap , flap ; and its chin in the air ,
120361	120368	120520	120522	Tant ' Sannie	53	" Who 's that?í I asked . "
120379	120393	120563	120563	I	0	" Rich Englishman ! I 'll rich Englishman him , í I said ; "
120429	120518	120591	120591	he	3338	" sourka , sourka , courka , í any more . But I thought , wait till I 've had it , and then . But he , sly fox , son of Satan , seed of the Amalekite , he saw me looking at him in the church . The blessed Sacrament was n't half over when he takes Tant ' Trana by the arm , and out they go . I clap my baby down to its father , and I go after them . But , "
120526	120557	120591	120591	he	3338	" I could n't get up to them ; I am too fat . When I got to the corner he was pulling Tant ' Trana up into the cart . "

120900	120912	121100	121100	she	54	" No , little one , I will not take it , "
120922	120982	121115	121115	she	54	" the time was when I would have been very grateful to any one who would have given me a little money , a little help , a little power of gaining knowledge . But now , I have gone so far alone I may go on to the end . I do n't want it , little one . "
121011	121023	121203	121203	I	0	" Why is it always so , Waldo , always so ? "
121027	121099	121301	121301	Waldo	60	" we long for things , and long for them , and pray for them ; we would give all we have to come near to them , but we never reach them . Then at last , too late , just when we do n't want them any more , when all the sweetness is taken out of them , then they come . We do n't want them then , "
121118	121200	121362	121362	she	54	" I remember once , very long ago , when I was a very little girl , my mother had a work - box full of coloured reels . I always wanted to play with them , but she would never let me . At last one day she said I might take the box . I was so glad I hardly knew what to do . I ran round the house , and sat down with it on the back steps .
