727	735	736	736	he	190	" I see some hope , sir , "
739	771	736	736	he	190	" of inclining the heart of this woman to religious belief , before it is too late . Will you read my report , and say if you agree with me ? "
782	786	736	736	he	190	" A Memorandum , "
792	882	736	736	he	190	" At his last interview with the Prisoner , the Chaplain asked her if she had ever entered a place of public worship . She replied that she had occasionally attended the services at a Congregational Church in this town ; attracted by the reputation of the Minister as a preacher . ' He entirely failed to make a Christian of me , ' she said ; ' but I was struck by his eloquence . Besides , he interested me personally - he was a fine man . ' "
996	1120	1121	1121	She	200	" It was useless to repeat a protest which had already failed . Recklessly and flippantly as she had described it , an impression had been produced on her . It occurred to the Chaplain that he might at least make the attempt to turn this result to her own religious advantage . He asked whether she would receive the Minister , if the reverend gentleman came to the prison . ' That will depend , ' she said , ' on whether you answer some questions which I want to put to you first . ' The Chaplain consented ; provided always that he could reply with propriety to what she asked of him . Her first question only related to himself . "
1150	1160	1161	1161	She	200	" The Chaplain answered that it was quite true . "
1224	1233	1207	1207	she	200	" ' Is my handsome preacher married ? ' "
1238	1247	1207	1207	she	200	" ' Has he got any children ? ' "
1257	1267	1207	1207	she	200	" ' How long has he been married ? ' "
1281	1292	1294	1295	A lady	210	" ' What sort of woman is his wife ? ' "
1300	1318	1207	1207	she	200	" ' I do n't care whether she is respected or not . Is she kind ? ' "
1323	1332	1334	1334	He	161	" ' Is her husband well off ? ' "
1341	1377	1379	1379	her	211	" After that reply , the Prisoner 's curiosity appeared to be satisfied . She said , ' Bring your friend the preacher to me , if you like ' - and there it ended . "
1473	1674	1429	1430	the Governor	148	" In those serious words the Memorandum ended . Although not personally acquainted with the Minister I had heard of him , on all sides , as an excellent man . In the emergency that confronted us he had , as it seemed to me , his own sacred right to enter the prison ; assuming that he was willing to accept , what I myself felt to be , a very serious responsibility . The first necessity was to discover whether we might hope to obtain his services . With my full approval the Chaplain left me , to state the circumstances to his reverend colleague . CHAPTER III . THE CHILD APPEARS . During my friend 's absence , my attention was claimed by a sad incident - not unforeseen . It is , I suppose , generally known that near relatives are admitted to take their leave of criminals condemned to death . In the case of the Prisoner now waiting for execution , no person applied to the authorities for permission to see her . I myself inquired if she had any relations living , and if she would like to see them . She answered : "
1696	2132	1690	1694	the nearest relation of all	219	" In those last words the miserable creature alluded to her only child , a little girl an infant , I should say , who had passed her first year 's birthday by a few months . The farewell interview was to take place on the mother 's last evening on earth ; and the child was now brought into my rooms , in charge of her nurse . I had seldom seen a brighter or prettier little girl . She was just able to walk alone , and to enjoy the first delight of moving from one place to another . Quite of her own accord she came to me , attracted I daresay by the glitter of my watch - chain . Helping her to climb on my knee , I showed the wonders of the watch , and held it to her ear . At that past time , death had taken my good wife from me ; my two boys were away at Harrow School ; my domestic life was the life of a lonely man . Whether I was reminded of the bygone days when my sons were infants on my knee , listening to the ticking of my watch - or whether the friendless position of the poor little creature , who had lost one parent and was soon to lose the other by a violent death , moved me in depths of pity not easily reached in my later experience - I am not able to say . This only I know : my heart ached for the child while she was laughing and listening ; and something fell from me on the watch which I do n't deny might have been a tear . A few of the toys , mostly broken now , which my two children used to play with are still in my possession ; kept , like my poor wife 's favorite jewels , for old remembrance ' sake . These I took from their repository when the attraction of my watch showed signs of failing . The child pounced on them with her chubby hands , and screamed with pleasure . And the hangman was waiting for her mother - and , more horrid still , the mother deserved it ! My duty required me to let the Prisoner know that her little daughter had arrived . Did that heart of iron melt at last ? It might have been so , or it might not ; the message sent back kept her secret . All that it said to me was : "
2143	2256	2257	2257	My	0	" The Minister had consented to help us . On his arrival at the prison , I received him privately in my study . I had only to look at his face - pitiably pale and agitated - to see that he was a sensitive man , not always able to control his nerves on occasions which tried his moral courage . A kind , I might almost say a noble face , and a voice unaffectedly persuasive , at once prepossessed me in his favor . The few words of welcome that I spoke were intended to compose him . They failed to produce the impression on which I had counted . "
2260	2264	2257	2257	My	0	" he said , "
2323	2351	2314	2314	I	0	" I suggested that he should wait a while , in the hope that time and quiet might help him . He thanked me , and refused . "
2360	2364	2314	2314	I	0	" he said , "
2418	2895	2413	2413	I	0	" My own observation of human nature told me that this was wisely said . I led the way at once to the cell . CHAPTER IV . THE MINISTER SAYS YES . The Prisoner was seated on her bed , quietly talking with the woman appointed to watch her . When she rose to receive us , I saw the Minister start . The face that confronted him would , in my opinion , have taken any man by surprise , if he had first happened to see it within the walls of a prison . Visitors to the picture - galleries of Italy , growing weary of Holy Families in endless succession , observe that the idea of the Madonna , among the rank and file of Italian Painters , is limited to one changeless and familiar type . I can hardly hope to be believed when I say that the personal appearance of the murderess recalled that type . She presented the delicate light hair , the quiet eyes , the finely - shaped lower features and the correctly oval form of face , repeated in hundreds on hundreds of the conventional works of Art to which I have ventured to allude . To those who doubt me , I can only declare that what I have here written is undisguised and absolute truth . Let me add that daily observation of all classes of criminals , extending over many years , has considerably diminished my faith in physiognomy as a safe guide to the discovery of character . Nervous trepidation looks like guilt . Guilt , firmly sustained by insensibility , looks like innocence . One of the vilest wretches ever placed under my charge won the sympathies while he was waiting for his trial of every person who saw him , including even the persons employed in the prison . Only the other day , ladies and gentlemen coming to visit me passed a body of men at work on the road . Judges of physiognomy among them were horrified at the criminal atrocity betrayed in every face that they noticed . They condoled with me on the near neighborhood of so many convicts to my official place of residence . I looked out of the window and saw a group of honest laborers whose only crime was poverty employed by the parish ! Having instructed the female warder to leave the room - but to take care that she waited within call - I looked again at the Minister . Confronted by the serious responsibility that he had undertaken , he justified what he had said to me . Still pale , still distressed , he was now nevertheless master of himself . I turned to the door to leave him alone with the Prisoner . She called me back . "
2904	2908	2413	2413	I	0	" she said , "
2920	2941	2917	2918	a witness	227	" Finding that we were both willing to comply with this request , she addressed herself directly to the Minister . "
2951	2955	2958	2958	you	226	" she began , "
2967	2994	2958	2958	you	226	" The voice in which she spoke to him was steady and clear ; a marked contrast to the tremulous earnestness with which he answered her . "
3028	3065	3009	3009	I	0	" She looked at him , and listened to him , as if he was speaking to her in an unknown tongue , and went on with what she had to say as quietly as ever . "
3101	3102	3084	3084	you	226	" "
3111	3112	3109	3109	God	38	" "
3133	3134	3129	3129	you	226	" "
3143	3163	3129	3129	you	226	" She paused for a while , evidently considering with special attention what she was about to say next . "
3169	3173	3175	3175	you	226	" she resumed , "
3201	3202	3175	3175	you	226	" "
3212	3218	3175	3175	you	226	" he said , fervently , "
3239	3246	3221	3221	I	0	" The Prisoner turned to me . "
3256	3257	3248	3254	the person who watches me waiting outside	231	" "
3260	3261	3248	3254	the person who watches me waiting outside	231	" "
3280	3338	3273	3273	I	0	" It was plain that she had been leading the way to the delivery of that message , whatever it might be , in all that she had said up to the present time . So far my poor powers of penetration helped me , and no further . The warder appeared , and received her message . "
3358	3420	3351	3351	I	0	" Taken completely by surprise , I signed to the attendant to wait for further instructions . In a moment more I had sufficiently recovered myself to see the impropriety of permitting any obstacle to interpose between the Minister and his errand of mercy . I gently reminded the Prisoner that she would have a later opportunity of seeing her child . "
3425	3430	3421	3421	Your	232	" I told her , "
3448	3471	3440	3441	the clergyman	235	" For the second time I attempted to leave the cell . For the second time this impenetrable woman called me back . "
3479	3483	3489	3489	him	236	" she said . "
3491	3621	3622	3622	You	237	" The patient Minister yielded , and appealed to me to follow his example . I reluctantly sanctioned the delivery of the message . After a brief interval the child was brought to us , tired and sleepy . For a while the nurse roused her by setting her on her feet . She happened to notice the Minister first . Her bright eyes rested on him , gravely wondering . He kissed her , and , after a momentary hesitation , gave her to her mother . The horror of the situation overpowered him : he turned his face away from us . I understood what he felt ; he almost overthrew my own self - command . The Prisoner spoke to the nurse in no friendly tone : "
3626	3644	3622	3622	You	237	" The nurse turned to me , ostentatiously ignoring the words that had been addressed to her . "
3656	3701	3622	3622	You	237	" I suggested that she should return to the waiting - room . She returned at once in silence . The Prisoner looked after her as she went out , with such an expression of hatred in her eyes that the Minister noticed it . "
3711	3715	3716	3716	She	239	" he asked . "
3812	3886	3806	3806	you	237	" The sorrow and pity in his face answered for him . Quietly sleeping , the poor baby rested on her mother 's bosom . Was the heart of the murderess softened by the divine influence of maternal love ? The hands that held the child trembled a little . For the first time it seemed to cost her an effort to compose herself , before she could speak to the Minister again . "
3894	3898	3899	3899	I	0	" she said , "
3929	3952	3955	3955	my	0	" She paused ; a first tinge of color rose on her pale face ; she broke into an outburst of rage . "
4016	4049	4011	4011	I	0	" The Minister sternly stopped her before she could say the next word . To my astonishment she appeared to be humbled , to be even ashamed : she asked his pardon : "
4081	4094	4078	4079	your wife	253	" Her altered tone touched him . He answered sadly and kindly : "
4104	4176	4177	4177	I	0	" The purpose which she had been keeping in view from the moment when the Minister entered her cell was no mystery now . Ought I to have interfered ? Let me confess a weakness , unworthy perhaps of my office . I was so sorry for the child - I hesitated . My silence encouraged the mother . She advanced to the Minister with the sleeping infant in her arms . "
4188	4192	4179	4179	you	255	" she said . "
4228	4238	4217	4217	you	255	" She lost her self - possession once more . "
4246	4251	4217	4217	you	255	" she burst out . "
4256	4369	4217	4217	you	255	" God knows how I still shrunk from it ! But there was no alternative now ; I was bound to remember my duty to the excellent man , whose critical position at that moment was , in some degree at least , due to my hesitation in asserting my authority . Could I allow the Prisoner to presume on his compassionate nature , and to hurry him into a decision which , in his calmer moments , he might find reason to regret ? I spoke to him . Does the man live who - having to say what I had to say - could have spoken to the doomed mother ? "
4381	4385	4370	4370	I	0	" I said . "
4397	4408	4409	4409	He	3443	" She turned on me with a look of fury . "
4413	4432	4409	4409	He	3443	" she cried . I saw , or thought I saw , signs of yielding in his face . "
4436	4440	4409	4409	He	3443	" I persisted - "
4449	4456	4446	4446	you	259	" She stepped up to me . "
4460	4464	4446	4446	you	259	" she repeated . "
4478	4497	4466	4466	you	3443	" She laid the sleeping child on her bed , and fell on her knees before the Minister : "
4577	4595	4596	4596	You	3443	" She sank prostrate at his feet , and beat her hands in frenzy on the floor . "
4604	4610	4596	4596	You	3443	" she reminded him furiously . "
4624	4725	4596	4596	You	3443	" He raised her . Her fierce tearless eyes questioned his face in a mute expectation dreadful to see . Suddenly , a foretaste of death - the death that was so near now ! - struck her with a shivering fit : her head dropped on the Minister 's shoulder . Other men might have shrunk from the contact of it . That true Christian let it rest . Under the maddening sting of suspense , her sinking energies rallied for an instant . In a whisper , she was just able to put the supreme question to him . "
4731	4735	4596	4596	You	3443	" He answered : "
4738	4783	4596	4596	You	3443	" A faint breath of relief , just audible in the silence , told me that she had heard him . It was her last effort . He laid her , insensible , on the bed , by the side of her sleeping child . "
4788	4796	4596	4596	You	3443	" was all he said to me ; "
4802	5031	4596	4596	You	3443	" CHAPTER V. MISS CHANCE ASSERTS HERSELF . The services of our medical officer were required , in order to hasten the recovery of the Prisoner 's senses . When the Doctor and I left the cell together , she was composed , and ready in the performance of her promise to listen to the exhortations of the Minister . The sleeping child was left undisturbed , by the mother 's desire . If the Minister felt tempted to regret what he had done , there was the artless influence which would check him ! As we stepped into the corridor , I gave the female warder her instructions to remain on the watch , and to return to her post when she saw the Minister come out . In the meantime , my companion had walked on a little way . Possessed of ability and experience within the limits of his profession , he was in other respects a man with a crotchety mind ; bold to the verge of recklessness in the expression of his opinion ; and possessed of a command of language that carried everything before it . Let me add that he was just and merciful in his intercourse with others , and I shall have summed him up fairly enough . When I joined him he seemed to be absorbed in reflection . "
5037	5041	5034	5035	the Prisoner	158	" I said . "
5058	5062	5034	5035	the Prisoner	158	" he answered , "
5073	5095	5096	5096	I	0	" I was not without hope of a good result , and I said so . The Doctor disagreed with me . "
5106	5110	5112	5112	I	0	" he remarked ; "
5131	5195	5196	5196	Governor	152	" There was no reason for concealing from one of my colleagues the benevolent decision , on the part of the good Minister , of which I had been a witness . The Doctor listened to me with the first appearance of downright astonishment that I had ever observed in his face . When I had done , he made an extraordinary reply : "
5223	5297	5209	5209	He	236	" Was the doctor in earnest ? Strongly in earnest ; there could be no doubt of it . Before I could ask him what he meant , he was called away to a patient on the other side of the prison . When we parted at the door of my room , I made it a request that my medical friend would return to me and explain what he had just said . "
5308	5312	5313	5313	you	278	" he replied , "
5335	5336	5327	5327	you	278	" "
5345	5349	5327	5327	you	278	" I rejoined . "
5363	5367	5355	5355	I	0	" he said . "
5411	5468	5396	5396	you	278	" The Doctor as I concluded was still strongly impressed by the Minister 's resolution to adopt a child whose wicked mother had committed the most atrocious of all crimes . Was some serious foreboding in secret possession of his mind ? My curiosity to hear him was now increased tenfold . I replied without hesitation : "
5474	5489	5472	5472	you	0	" He looked at me with his sense of humor twinkling in his eyes . "
5499	5505	5491	5491	you	278	" he said , slyly . "
5514	5588	5509	5509	I	0	" Left by myself , I took up the day 's newspaper . My attention wandered ; my thoughts were in the cell with the Minister and the Prisoner . How would it end ? Sometimes , I was inclined to doubt with the Doctor . Sometimes , I took refuge in my own more hopeful view . These idle reflections were agreeably interrupted by the appearance of my friend , the Chaplain . "
5594	5598	5589	5589	You	286	" I said ; "
5614	5615	5605	5605	I	0	" "
5621	5626	5605	5605	I	0	" the Chaplain added , "
5636	5637	5639	5640	the stranger	288	" "
5646	5650	5639	5640	the stranger	288	" I asked . "
5715	6111	5709	5709	she	291	" The nurse having been in this way recalled to my memory , I felt some little interest in seeing her , after what had passed in the cell . In plainer words , I was desirous of judging for myself whether she deserved the hostile feeling which the Prisoner had shown toward her . I thanked the Chaplain before he left me , and gave the servant the necessary instructions . When she entered the room , I looked at the woman attentively for the first time . Youth and a fine complexion , a well - made figure and a natural grace of movement - these were her personal attractions , so far as I could see . Her defects were , to my mind , equally noticeable . Under a heavy forehead , her piercing eyes looked out at persons and things with an expression which was not to my taste . Her large mouth - another defect , in my opinion - would have been recommended to mercy , in the estimation of many men , by her magnificent teeth ; white , well - shaped , cruelly regular . Believers in physiognomy might perhaps have seen the betrayal of an obstinate nature in the lengthy firmness of her chin . While I am trying to describe her , let me not forget her dress . A woman 's dress is the mirror in which we may see the reflection of a woman 's nature . Bearing in mind the melancholy and impressive circumstances under which she had brought the child to the prison , the gayety of color in her gown and her bonnet implied either a total want of feeling , or a total want of tact . As to her position in life , let me confess that I felt , after a closer examination , at a loss to determine it . She was certainly not a lady . The Prisoner had spoken of her as if she was a domestic servant who had forfeited her right to consideration and respect . And she had entered the prison , as a nurse might have entered it , in charge of a child . I did what we all do when we are not clever enough to find the answer to a riddle - I gave it up . "
6119	6123	6114	6114	I	0	" I asked . "
6130	6134	6125	6125	you	0	" she answered , "
6148	6149	6125	6125	you	0	" "
6153	6158	6125	6125	you	0	" I reminded her , "
6165	6166	6125	6125	you	0	" "
6174	6250	6125	6125	you	0	" The Minister had undoubtedly acquired the sole right of deciding . It was for him to say whether this woman should , or should not , remain in attendance on the child whom he had adopted . In the meanwhile , the feeling of distrust which was gaining on my mind warned me to remember the value of reserve in holding intercourse with a stranger . She seemed to be irritated by my silence . "
6260	6264	6267	6267	you	0	" she asked , "
6278	6279	6267	6267	you	0	" "
6289	6293	6280	6280	You	0	" I said ; "
6307	6308	6301	6302	your mistress	297	" "
6313	6324	6301	6302	your mistress	297	" I had evidently given offense ; I stopped directly . "
6334	6340	6348	6348	herself	299	" she declared , loftily , "
6367	6368	6360	6360	I	0	" "
6376	6380	6370	6370	you	0	" I suggested . "
6385	6396	6383	6383	her	3474	" It was unwise on my part - I protested . "
6407	6411	6412	6412	Her	3474	" I said . "
6415	6432	6412	6412	Her	3474	" She said it with the air of a woman who had produced an unanswerable reason . "
6439	6444	6412	6412	Her	3474	" she went on . "
6479	6577	6470	6470	I	0	" Putting together what I had just heard , and what I had seen in the cell , I drew the right conclusion at last . The woman , whose position in life had been thus far an impenetrable mystery to me , now stood revealed as one , among other objects of the Prisoner 's jealousy , during her disastrous married life . A serious doubt occurred to me as to the authority under which the husband 's mistress might be acting , after the husband 's death . I instantly put it to the test . "
6590	6594	6581	6581	you	307	" I asked . "
6597	6601	6602	6602	I	0	" she repeated . "
6720	6732	6710	6710	I	0	" I forgot myself once more - I lost my temper . "
6737	6741	6710	6710	I	0	" I said . "
6758	6759	6760	6760	I	0	" "
6766	6772	6764	6764	you	0	" the wretch burst out . "
6779	6785	6786	6786	I	0	" A quiet voice answered : "
6791	6881	6786	6786	I	0	" We both looked round and saw the Minister standing in the open doorway , with the child in his arms . The ordeal that he had gone through in the condemned cell was visible in his face ; he looked miserably haggard and broken . I was eager to know if his merciful interest in the Prisoner had purified her guilty soul - but at the same time I was afraid , after what he had but too plainly suffered , to ask him to enter into details . "
6886	6890	6786	6786	I	0	" I said . "
6897	6898	6892	6892	your	0	" "
6906	6910	6899	6899	God	38	" he answered . "
6930	6983	6924	6924	she	322	" After handing the written and signed confession to me , he approached the venomous creature , still lingering in the room to hear what passed between us . Before I could stop him , he spoke to her , under a natural impression that he was addressing the Prisoner 's servant . "
6992	6996	6984	6984	I	0	" he said , "
7028	7036	7037	7037	I	0	" She listened with an evil smile . "
7046	7050	7037	7037	I	0	" she answered . "
7146	7166	7167	7167	I	0	" Too weary and too preoccupied to notice the insolence of her manner , the Minister mentioned his name . "
7171	7175	7167	7167	I	0	" he said , "
7191	7203	7186	7186	you	0	" Still insolent , Miss Elizabeth Chance shook her head carelessly . "
7253	7260	7263	7263	she	3474	" The Minister turned to me . "
7266	7267	7263	7263	she	3474	" "
7275	7280	7268	7268	I	0	" Miss Chance interposed . "
7303	7310	7300	7300	I	0	" She pointed to the child . "
7331	7375	7322	7325	the tigress - cub	334	" With those parting words , she favored us with a low curtsey , and left the room . CHAPTER VI . THE DOCTOR DOUBTS . The Minister looked at me in an absent manner ; his attention seemed to have been wandering . "
7383	7422	7379	7380	Miss Chance	41	" he asked . Before I could speak , a friend 's voice at the door interrupted us . The Doctor , returning to me as he had promised , answered the Minister 's question in these words : "
7514	7526	7508	7508	she	338	" the Doctor continued , gently patting the child 's cheek , "
7562	7582	7584	7584	me	0	" I was on the point of protesting against my friend 's interpretation , when the Minister stopped me . "
7594	7601	7588	7588	sir	3443	" he said to the Doctor . "
7625	7630	7620	7620	me	0	" he went on , "
7692	7693	7695	7695	she	348	" "
7702	7706	7707	7707	She	348	" I asked . "
7783	7797	7780	7781	my darling	350	" He kissed the child tenderly , and took her away with him . "
7809	7814	7798	7799	That man	351	" the Doctor remarked . "
7858	7885	7845	7845	his	351	" It was a trial of my temper to hear my clever colleague justifying , in this way , the ignorant prediction of an insolent woman . "
7893	7897	7845	7845	his	351	" I insisted . "
7992	8000	7986	7986	you	333	" The Doctor took out his pipe . "
8007	8011	8012	8012	Tobacco	44	" he asked . "
8020	8057	8012	8012	Tobacco	44	" I gave him the means of arranging his ideas ; that is to say , I gave him the match - box . He blew some preliminary clouds of smoke and then he answered me : "
8271	8272	8221	8221	you	3475	" "
8276	8280	8221	8221	you	3475	" I admitted . "
8292	8293	8295	8295	you	0	" "
8301	8306	8295	8295	you	0	" the Doctor asked . "
8329	8330	8321	8321	you	0	" "
8701	8767	8768	8768	You	387	" It was useless to dispute with a man who possessed his command of language . At the same time , there was a bright side to the poor Minister 's prospects which the Doctor had failed to see . It was barely possible that I might succeed in putting my positive friend in the wrong . I tried the experiment , at any rate . "
8774	8779	8768	8768	You	387	" I reminded him , "
8814	8840	8850	8850	you	387	" Now that he was enjoying the fumes of tobacco , the Doctor was as placid and sweet - tempered as a man could be . "
8844	8848	8850	8850	you	387	" he said . "
8857	8867	8850	8850	you	387	" I asked sternly . He answered , sweetly : "
8871	8872	8850	8850	you	387	" "
8879	8880	8850	8850	you	387	" "
8887	8888	8850	8850	you	387	" "
8895	8896	8897	8897	I	0	" "
8906	8980	8897	8897	I	0	" I had not expected this extraordinary docility . The Doctor had got the upper hand of me again - a state of things that I might have found it hard to endure , but for a call of duty which put an end to our sitting . One of the female warders appeared with a message from the condemned cell . The Prisoner wished to see the Governor and the Medical Officer . "
8985	8990	8993	8993	sir	3443	" the Doctor inquired . "
8995	8996	8993	8993	sir	3443	" "
9004	9005	8993	8993	sir	3443	" "
9019	9151	8993	8993	sir	3443	" We set forth together for the condemned cell . CHAPTER VII . THE MURDERESS CONSULTS THE AUTHORITIES . There was a considerate side to my friend 's character , which showed itself when the warder had left us . He was especially anxious to be careful of what he said to a woman in the Prisoner 's terrible situation ; especially in the event of her having been really subjected to the influence of religious belief . On the Minister 's own authority , I declared that there was every reason to adopt this conclusion ; and in support of what I had said I showed him the confession . It only contained a few lines , acknowledging that she had committed the murder and that she deserved her sentence . "
9180	9230	9173	9173	I	0	" With that remarkable disavowal of the defense set up by her advocate , the confession ended . My colleague read the paper , and handed it back to me without making any remark . I asked if he suspected the Prisoner of feigning conversion to please the Minister . "
9237	9243	9231	9231	She	396	" he answered , gravely , "
9248	9439	9173	9173	I	0	" It would not be true to say that the Doctor 's obstinacy had shaken my belief in the good result of the Minister 's interference . I may , however , acknowledge that I felt some misgivings , which were not dispelled when I found myself in the presence of the Prisoner . I had expected to see her employed in reading the Bible . The good book was closed and was not even placed within her reach . The occupation to which she was devoting herself astonished and repelled me . Some carelessness on the part of the attendant had left on the table the writing materials that had been needed for her confession . She was using them now - when death on the scaffold was literally within a few hours of her - to sketch a portrait of the female warder , who was on the watch ! The Doctor and I looked at each other ; and now the sincerity of her repentance was something that I began to question , too . She laid down the pen , and proceeded quietly to explain herself . "
9459	9463	9464	9464	I	0	" she said . "
9528	9538	9524	9524	you	398	" She paused , and tore up the portrait . "
9545	9549	9550	9550	I	0	" she resumed , "
9591	9616	9581	9582	the warder	3547	" Giving the woman permission to withdraw for a while , I waited with some anxiety to hear what the Prisoner wanted of me . "
9625	9629	9617	9617	I	0	" she proceeded , "
9668	9713	9772	9772	you	3443	" How another man might have felt , in my place , I can not , of course , say . To my mind , such a question - on her lips - was too shocking to be answered in words . I bowed . "
9720	9725	9772	9772	you	3443	" she went on , "
9730	9738	9772	9772	you	3443	" I could remain silent no longer . "
9748	9753	9772	9772	you	3443	" I burst out . "
9761	9762	9772	9772	you	3443	" "
9792	9802	9777	9777	I	0	" I replied as before , by a bow . "
9805	9809	9777	9777	I	0	" she said , "
9844	9875	9815	9815	I	0	" She hesitated ; her infernal self - possession failed her at last . The color left her face ; she was no longer able to look at me firmly . "
9881	9885	9815	9815	I	0	" she resumed , "
9982	10021	9973	9980	the boldest man that ever mounted the scaffold	411	" Before I could stop her , she seized me by the hand , and wrung it with a furious power that left the mark of her grasp on me , in a bruise , for days afterward . "
10027	10031	10023	10023	you	3443	" she cried . "
10049	10072	10073	10073	I	0	" I gave her my promise . The relief to her tortured spirit expressed itself horribly in a burst of frantic laughter . "
10079	10083	10073	10073	I	0	" she gasped ; "
10089	10156	10084	10084	I	0	" My enemies said of me , when I got my appointment , that I was too excitable a man to be governor of a prison . Perhaps they were not altogether wrong . Anyhow , the quick - witted Doctor saw some change in me , which I was not aware of myself . He took my arm and led me out of the cell . "
10162	10166	10084	10084	I	0	" he whispered . "
10182	10199	10200	10200	I	0	" When we met again , I asked what had passed between the Prisoner and himself . "
10207	10212	10200	10200	I	0	" he told me ; "
10520	10528	10508	10508	you	419	" I confessed that I was surprised . "
10533	10538	10508	10508	you	419	" the Doctor said . "
10558	10583	10508	10508	you	419	" I objected to this that she had shown fondness for her child . My friend disposed of the objection with his customary readiness . "
10588	10592	10508	10508	you	419	" he said . "
10669	10670	10663	10663	I	0	" "
10680	10684	10675	10675	you	3443	" I asked . "
10693	10697	10690	10690	you	3443	" he answered , "
10907	11042	10896	10897	the people	439	" CHAPTER VIII . THE MINISTER SAYS GOOD - BY . The Capital Punishment of the Prisoner is in no respect connected with my purpose in writing the present narrative . Neither do I desire to darken these pages by describing in detail an act of righteous retribution which must present , by the nature of it , a scene of horror . For these reasons I ask to be excused , if I limit what I must needs say of the execution within the compass of a few words - and pass on . The one self - possessed person among us was the miserable woman who suffered the penalty of death . Not very discreetly , as I think , the Chaplain asked her if she had truly repented . She answered : "
11057	11111	11054	11054	you	3443	" To my mind - still hesitating between the view that believes with the Minister , and the view that doubts with the Doctor - this reply leaves a way open to hope of her salvation . Her last words to me , as she mounted the steps of the scaffold , were : "
11116	11239	11240	11240	I	0	" It was easy for me to be true to my word . At that bygone time , no difficulties were placed in my way by such precautions as are now observed in the conduct of executions within the walls of the prison . From the time of her death to the time of her burial , no living creature saw her face . She rests , veiled in her prison grave . Let me now turn to living interests , and to scenes removed from the thunder - clouds of crime . ....... On the next day I received a visit from the Minister . His first words entreated me not to allude to the terrible event of the previous day . "
11248	11252	11240	11240	I	0	" he said , "
11261	11457	11254	11254	I	0	" This seemed to me to be the misplaced confidence of a weak man in the refuge of silence . By way of changing the subject , I spoke of the child . There would be serious difficulties to contend with as I ventured to suggest , if he remained in the town , and allowed his new responsibilities to become the subject of public talk . His reply to this agreeably surprised me . There were no difficulties to be feared . The state of his wife 's health had obliged him acting under medical advice to try the influence of her native air . An interval of some months might elapse before the good effect of the change had sufficiently declared itself ; and a return to the peculiar climate of the town might bring on a relapse . There had consequently been no alternative to but resign his charge . Only on that day the resignation had been accepted - with expressions of regret sincerely reciprocated by himself . He proposed to leave the town immediately ; and one of the objects of his visit was to bid me good - by . "
11465	11469	11254	11254	I	0	" he said , "
11575	11592	11558	11558	she	447	" I congratulated the Minister on the good fortune which had befriended him , so far . "
11605	11609	11598	11598	I	0	" he continued , "
11683	12072	11670	11670	I	0	" There could be no doubt of the necessity . If the child was described as adopted , there would be curiosity about the circumstances , and inquiries relating to the parents . Prevaricating replies lead to suspicion , and suspicion to discovery . But for the wise course which the Minister had decided on taking , the poor child 's life might have been darkened by the horror of the mother 's crime , and the infamy of the mother 's death . Having quieted my friend 's needless scruples by this perfectly sincere expression of opinion , I ventured to approach the central figure in his domestic circle , by means of a question relating to his wife . How had that lady received the unfortunate little creature , for whose appearance on the home - scene she must have been entirely unprepared ? The Minister 's manner showed some embarrassment ; he prefaced what he had to tell me with praises of his wife , equally creditable no doubt to both of them . The beauty of the child , the pretty ways of the child , he said , fascinated the admirable woman at first sight . It was not to be denied that she had felt , and had expressed , misgivings , on being informed of the circumstances under which the Minister 's act of mercy had been performed . But her mind was too well balanced to incline to this state of feeling , when her husband had addressed her in defense of his conduct . She then understood that the true merit of a good action consisted in patiently facing the sacrifices involved . Her interest in the new daughter being , in this way , ennobled by a sense of Christian duty , there had been no further difference of opinion between the married pair . I listened to this plausible explanation with interest , but , at the same time , with doubts of the lasting nature of the lady 's submission to circumstances ; suggested , perhaps , by the constraint in the Minister 's manner . It was well for both of us when we changed the subject . He reminded me of the discouraging view which the Doctor had taken of the prospect before him . "
12087	12091	12073	12073	I	0	" he said . "
12168	12172	12174	12174	you	456	" he concluded , "
12201	12877	12184	12184	himself	3466	" He intrusted me with that message , and gave me his hand . So we parted . I agreed with him , I admired him ; but my faith seemed to want sustaining power , as compared with his faith . On his own showing as it appeared to me , there would be two forces in a state of conflict in the child 's nature as she grew up - inherited evil against inculcated good . Try as I might , I failed to feel the Minister 's comforting conviction as to which of the two would win . CHAPTER IX . THE GOVERNOR RECEIVES A VISIT . A few days after the good man had left us , I met with a serious accident , caused by a false step on the stone stairs of the prison . The long illness which followed this misfortune , and my removal afterward in the interests of my recovery to a milder climate than the climate of England , obliged me to confide the duties of governor of the prison to a representative . I was absent from my post for rather more than a year . During this interval no news reached me from my reverend friend . Having returned to the duties of my office , I thought of writing to the Minister . While the proposed letter was still in contemplation , I was informed that a lady wished to see me . She sent in her card . My visitor proved to be the Minister 's wife . I observed her with no ordinary attention when she entered the room . Her dress was simple ; her scanty light hair , so far as I could see it under her bonnet , was dressed with taste . The paleness of her lips , and the faded color in her face , suggested that she was certainly not in good health . Two peculiarities struck me in her personal appearance . I never remembered having seen any other person with such a singularly narrow and slanting forehead as this lady presented ; and I was impressed , not at all agreeably , by the flashing shifting expression in her eyes . On the other hand , let me own that I was powerfully attracted and interested by the beauty of her voice . Its fine variety of compass , and its musical resonance of tone , fell with such enchantment on the ear , that I should have liked to put a book of poetry into her hand , and to have heard her read it in summer - time , accompanied by the music of a rocky stream . The object of her visit - so far as she explained it at the outset - appeared to be to offer her congratulations on my recovery , and to tell me that her husband had assumed the charge of a church in a large town not far from her birthplace . Even those commonplace words were made interesting by her delicious voice . But however sensitive to sweet sounds a man may be , there are limits to his capacity for deceiving himself - especially when he happens to be enlightened by experience of humanity within the walls of a prison . I had , it may be remembered , already doubted the lady 's good temper , judging from her husband 's over - wrought description of her virtues . Her eyes looked at me furtively ; and her manner , gracefully self - possessed as it was , suggested that she had something of a delicate , or disagreeable , nature to say to me , and that she was at a loss how to approach the subject so as to produce the right impression on my mind at the outset . There was a momentary silence between us . For the sake of saying something , I asked how she and the Minister liked their new place of residence . "
12884	12888	12184	12184	himself	3466	" she answered , "
12918	12965	12903	12903	I	0	" There she stopped : expecting me , as I fancied , to guess what she meant . A woman , and that woman a mother , might have fulfilled her anticipations . A man , and that man not listening attentively , was simply puzzled . "
12971	12975	12903	12903	I	0	" I said ; "
12983	13029	13030	13030	I	0	" The lady 's temper looked at me out of the lady 's shifting eyes , and hid itself again in a moment . She set herself right in my estimation by taking the whole blame of our little misunderstanding on her own innocent shoulders . "
13038	13042	13030	13030	I	0	" she said . "
13103	13134	13136	13136	I	0	" My languid interest in the Minister 's wife was not stimulated by the announcement of this domestic event . I felt no wish to see the ' sweet little girl "
13323	13330	13331	13331	I	0	" It is pleasant to think , "
13334	13340	13341	13341	She	174	" that your other daughter - "
13350	13365	13341	13341	She	174	" Do you mean the child that my husband was foolish enough to adopt ? "
13366	13374	13375	13375	I	0	" Say rather fortunate enough to adopt , "
13378	13414	13341	13341	She	174	" As your own little girl grows up , she will want a playfellow . And she will find a playfellow in that other child , whom the good Minister has taken for his own . "
13415	13429	13436	13436	her	174	" No , my dear sir - not if I can prevent it . "
13483	13489	13490	13490	she	174	" You must surely understand , "
13494	13515	13490	13490	she	174	" that we do n't want another person 's child , now we have a little darling of our own ? "
13516	13527	13528	13528	I	0	" Does your husband agree with you in that view ? "
13531	13575	13576	13576	She	174	" Oh dear , no ! He said what you said just now , and oddly enough almost in the same words . But I do n't at all despair of persuading him to change his mind - and you can help me . "
13604	13610	13611	13611	I	0	" What do you mean ? "
13638	13647	13648	13648	she	174	" You will find what I mean there , "
13755	13761	13762	13762	she	174	" In two years more , "
13765	13876	13762	13762	she	174	" the child of that detestable creature who was hanged - do you know , I can not even look at the little wretch without thinking of the gallows ? - will be old enough with your interest to help us to be received into the asylum . What a relief it will be to get rid of that child ! And how hard I shall work at canvassing for subscribers ' votes ! Your name will be a tower of strength when I use it as a reference . Pardon me - you are not looking so pleasantly as usual . Do you see some obstacles in our way ? "
13877	13883	13950	13950	She	484	" I see two obstacles . "
13884	13891	13950	13950	She	484	" What can they possibly be ? "
13908	13914	13915	13915	I	0	" You know perfectly well , "
13918	13926	13915	13915	I	0	" what one of the obstacles is . "
13927	13945	13950	13950	She	484	" Am I to understand that you contemplate any serious resistance on the part of my husband ? "
13946	13949	13950	13950	She	484	" Certainly ! "
13958	13965	13966	13966	she	484	" Are you a single man ? "
13969	13975	13966	13966	she	484	" I am a widower . "
13976	14088	13950	13950	She	484	" Then your experience ought to tell you that I know every weak point in the Minister 's character . I can tell him , on your authority , that the hateful child will be placed in competent and kindly hands - and I have my own sweet baby to plead for me . With these advantages in my favor , do you actually suppose I can fail to make my way of thinking his way of thinking ? You must have forgotten your own married life ! Suppose we go on to the second of your two obstacles . I hope it will be better worth considering than the first . "
14089	14098	14099	14099	I	0	" The second obstacle will not disappoint you , "
14102	14111	14099	14099	I	0	" I am the obstacle , this time . "
14112	14119	13950	13950	She	484	" You refuse to help me ? "
14120	14123	13950	13950	She	484	" Positively . "
14124	14132	14099	14099	I	0	" Perhaps reflection may alter your resolution ? "
14133	14142	13950	13950	She	484	" Reflection will do nothing of the kind . "
14143	14150	13950	13950	She	484	" You are rude , sir ! "
14151	14168	14169	14169	She	485	" In speaking to you , madam , I have no alternative but to speak plainly . "
14184	14195	14196	14196	she	485	" What sort of enemy have I made of you ? "
14199	14223	14196	14196	she	485	" A passive enemy who is content with refusing to help me ? Or an active enemy who will write to my husband ? "
14224	14229	14230	14230	I	0	" It depends entirely , "
14234	14255	14230	14230	I	0	" on what your husband does . If he questions me about you , I shall tell him the truth . "
14256	14261	14196	14196	she	485	" And if not ? "
14262	14281	14230	14230	I	0	" In that case , I shall hope to forget that you ever favored me with a visit . "
14344	14355	14356	14356	she	485	" Come and see us in two years ' time , "
14360	14430	14356	14356	she	485	" and discover the orphan of the gallows in our house if you can ! If your Asylum wo n't take her , some other Charity will . Ha , Mr. Governor , I deserve my disappointment ! I ought to have remembered that you are only a jailer after all . And what is a jailer ? Proverbially a brute . Do you hear that ? A brute ! "
14531	14535	14536	14536	he	162	" Drink it , "
14543	14547	14548	14548	he	162	" Drink it , "
14551	14557	14548	14548	he	162	" or you will die . "
14580	14586	14587	14587	he	162	" She will do now , "
14590	14595	14596	14596	she	485	" Can I go ? "
14599	14619	14596	14596	she	485	" Go wherever you please , madam - so long as you do n't go upstairs in a hurry . "
14623	14637	14620	14620	She	485	" I understand you , sir - and thank you for your advice . "
14661	14666	14667	14667	he	162	" What I felt , "
14670	14689	14667	14667	he	162	" when I had my fingers on her pulse . You heard her say that she understood me . "
14690	14702	14640	14641	the Doctor	162	" Yes ; but I do n't know what she meant . "
14703	14720	14667	14667	he	162	" She meant , probably , that her own doctor had warned her as I did . "
14721	14729	14667	14667	he	162	" Something seriously wrong with her health ? "
14730	14733	14640	14641	the Doctor	162	" Yes . "
14734	14739	14667	14667	he	162	" What is it ? "
14740	14743	14667	14667	he	162	" Heart . "
14809	14823	14824	14824	he	161	" Within an easy journey of the populous scene of my present labors , "
14827	15031	14824	14824	he	161	" there is a secluded country village called Low Lanes . The rector of the place is my wife 's brother . Before the birth of our infant , he had asked his sister to stay for a while at his house ; and the doctor thought she might safely be allowed to accept the invitation . Through some error in the customary calculations , as I suppose , the child was born unexpectedly at the rectory ; and the ceremony of baptism was performed at the church , under circumstances which I am not able to relate within the limits of a letter : Let me only say that I allude to this incident without any sectarian bitterness of feeling - for I am no enemy to the Church of England . You have no idea what treasures of virtue and treasures of beauty maternity has revealed in my wife 's sweet nature . Other mothers , in her proud position , might find their love cooling toward the poor child whom we have adopted . But my household is irradiated by the presence of an angel , who gives an equal share in her affections to the two little ones alike . "
15360	15366	15367	15367	he	161	" I am not aware , "
15370	15403	15367	15367	he	161	" whether I have , or have not , committed an offense against the Law . In any case , I may hope to have made atonement by obedience to the Gospel . "
15953	16084	15924	15925	The father	548	" I heard yesterday , for the first time , by means of an old newspaper - cutting sent to me by a friend , that the miserable woman who suffered the ignominy of public execution has left an infant child . Can you tell me what has become of the orphan ? If this little girl is , as I fear , not well provided for , I only do what my wife would have done if she had lived , by offering to make the child 's welfare my especial care . I am willing to place her in an establishment well known to me , in which she will be kindly treated , well educated , and fitted to earn her own living honorably in later life . "
16140	16249	16121	16121	I	0	" In the first place , there is at least a possibility - however carefully I might try to conceal it - that the child 's parentage would sooner or later be discovered . In the second place and assuming that the parentage had been successfully concealed , if this girl and my boy grew up together , there is another possibility to be reckoned with : they might become attached to each other . Does the father live who would allow his son ignorantly to marry the daughter of a convicted murderess ? I should have no alternative but to part them cruelly by revealing the truth . "
16667	16683	16684	16684	he	47	" I have a card to deliver from an acquaintance whom you have not mentioned , "
16687	16697	16684	16684	he	47	" and I rather think it will astonish you . "
16719	16727	16704	16704	he	47	" MRS . TENBRUGGEN OF SOUTH BEVELAND . "
16728	16731	16733	16734	the Chaplain	160	" Well ? "
16736	16739	16733	16734	the Chaplain	160	" Well , "
16743	16760	16740	16740	I	0	" I never even heard of Mrs. Tenbruggen , of South Beveland . Who is she ? "
16761	16781	16782	16783	the Chaplain	160	" I married the lady to a foreign gentleman , only last week , at my friend 's church , "
16786	16795	16796	16796	He	47	" Perhaps you may remember her maiden name ? "
16871	16877	16865	16865	I	0	" How did it happen ? "
16878	16887	16888	16889	my friend	3475	" In the ordinary course of such things , "
16892	17022	16888	16889	my friend	3475	" They were married by license , in their parish church . The bridegroom was a fine tall man , with a bold eye and a dashing manner . The bride and I recognized each other directly . When Miss Chance had become Mrs. Tenbruggen , she took me aside , and gave me her card . ' Ask the Governor to accept it , ' she said , ' in remembrance of the time when he took me for a nursemaid . Tell him I am married to a Dutch gentleman of high family . If he ever comes to Holland , we shall be glad to see him in our residence at South Beveland . ' There is her message to you , repeated word for word . "
17023	17036	17071	17072	the Minister	161	" I am glad she is going to live out of England . "
17037	17049	16888	16889	my friend	3475	" Why ? Surely you have no reason to fear her ? "
17050	17054	16888	16889	my friend	3475	" None whatever . "
17055	17066	17071	17072	the Minister	161	" You are thinking , perhaps , of somebody else ? "
17245	17247	17224	17224	her	596	" Journal "
17363	17366	17353	17353	I	0	" Helena ! "
17396	17399	17400	17400	I	0	" Well ! "
17403	17408	17400	17400	I	0	" What is it ? "
17409	17415	17416	17416	she	596	" Have you done already ? "
17463	17468	17450	17450	She	596	" That comforts me . "
17492	17500	17501	17501	she	596	" What will papa think of us , "
17504	17514	17501	17501	she	596	" if we do n't begin to - night ? "
17515	17520	17521	17521	I	0	" Why not begin , "
17524	17559	17501	17501	she	596	" by writing down what he said , when he gave us our journals ? Those wise words of advice will be in their proper place on the first page of the new books . "
17613	17616	17617	17617	she	53	" Oh , "
17621	17640	17617	17617	she	53	" how clever you are ! The very thing to write about ; I 'll do it directly . "
17724	17731	17732	17732	she	53	" It 's not worth while , "
17735	17752	17732	17732	she	53	" Anybody who cares to do it may read what I write . Good - night . "
17909	17946	17886	17886	she	53	" I am not half so fond of anybody as I am of papa . He is always kind , he is always right . I love him , I love him , I love him . "
17976	18058	18059	18059	He	608	" He said to me : ' You are getting lazier than ever , Eunice . ' He said to Helena : ' You are feeling the influence of Eunice 's example . ' He said to both of us : ' You are too ready , my dear children , to sit with your hands on your laps , looking at nothing and thinking of nothing ; I want to try a new way of employing your leisure time . ' "
18155	18331	18145	18145	I	0	" The truth is , I feel out of spirits now if I think of papa ; I am not easy in my mind about him . When he is very much interested , there is a quivering in his face which I do n't remember in past times . He seems to have got older and thinner , all on a sudden . He shouts which he never used to do when he threatens sinners at sermon - time . Being in dreadful earnest about our souls , he is of course obliged to speak of the devil ; but he never used to hit the harmless pulpit cushion with his fist as he does now . Nobody seems to have seen these things but me ; and now I have noticed them what ought I to do ? I do n't know ; I am certain of nothing , except what I have put in at the top of page one : I love him , I love him , I love him . "
19347	19365	19329	19329	she	53	" I hope papa will excuse me ; I have nothing to write about to - day . "
19409	19422	19392	19392	I	0	" Why do n't you call him father , as I do ? "
19436	19450	19430	19430	She	596	" I used to call him papa when I was a little girl . "
19451	19454	19455	19455	I	0	" That , "
19459	19470	19455	19455	I	0	" does n't justify you in calling him papa now . "
19476	19481	19472	19472	she	596	" Yes it does . "
19778	19788	19789	19789	I	0	" You will find something to write about now , "
19793	19831	19789	19789	I	0	" While I record everything that happens at home , you will keep your diary of all that you do in London , and when you come back we will show each other what we have written . "
19839	19852	19853	19853	she	596	" I do n't feel sure of being able to do it , "
19856	19863	19853	19853	she	596	" but I promise to try . "
20163	20203	20160	20160	She	700	" My dear child , you are improving . You were wretchedly thin when I saw you last . Now you are almost as well - developed as your sister . I think you are prettier than your sister . "
20237	20249	20234	20234	Mr.	703	" She has n't got her sister 's pretty gray eyes . "
20253	20267	20250	20250	Mrs.	704	" She has got pretty brown eyes , which are just as good . "
20271	20282	20268	20268	Mr.	705	" You ca n't compare her complexion with Helena 's . "
20286	20297	20283	20283	Mrs.	706	" I like Eunice 's pale complexion . So delicate . "
20303	20313	20298	20299	Young Miss	56	" I admire Helena 's hair - light brown . "
20320	20330	20314	20315	Young Master	57	" I prefer Eunice 's hair - dark brown . "
20343	20356	20333	20333	his	707	" Which of you two sisters is the oldest ? I forget . "
20362	20378	20357	20357	Mrs.	708	" Helena is the oldest ; she told us so when she was here last . "
20386	20392	20393	20393	I	0	" You must be mistaken , "
20397	20404	20393	20393	I	0	" Certainly not , my dear . "
20405	20411	20412	20412	I	0	" Then Helena was mistaken . "
20446	20463	20443	20443	Mrs.	714	" You seem to be very positive , Eunice . Surely , Helena ought to know . "
20467	20489	20464	20464	I	0	" Helena knows a good deal ; but she does n't know which of us is the oldest of the two . "
20496	20501	20490	20490	Mr.	715	" Do you know ? "
20502	20509	20510	20510	Mrs.	716	" No more than Helena does . "
20513	20520	20510	20510	Mrs.	716	" Do n't you keep birthdays ? "
20524	20537	20510	20510	Mrs.	716	" Yes ; we keep both our birthdays on the same day . "
20538	20543	20510	20510	Mrs.	716	" On what day ? "
20544	20553	20554	20554	Mr.	717	" The first day of the New Year . "
20558	20566	20554	20554	Mr.	717	" You ca n't possibly be twins ? "
20567	20573	20510	20510	Mrs.	716	" I do n't know . "
20574	20579	20554	20554	Mr.	717	" Perhaps Helena knows ? "
20580	20584	20585	20585	Mrs.	718	" Not she ! "
20597	20613	20585	20585	Mrs.	718	" Come , come , my dear ! you must know how old you are . "
20614	20626	20585	20585	Mrs.	718	" Yes ; I do know that . I 'm eighteen . "
20627	20634	20585	20585	Mrs.	718	" And how old is Helena ? "
20635	20640	20641	20641	Mrs.	720	" Helena 's eighteen . "
20647	20653	20645	20645	Mr.	721	" Do you hear that ? "
20657	20671	20654	20654	Mr.	722	" I shall write to her father , and ask what it means . "
20675	20689	20672	20672	I	0	" Papa will only tell you what he told us - years ago . "
20690	20697	20585	20585	Mrs.	718	" What did your father say ? "
20698	20817	20818	20818	I	0	" He said he had added our two ages together , and he meant to divide the product between us . It 's so long since , I do n't remember what the product was then . But I 'll tell you what the product is now . Our two ages come to thirty - six . Half thirty - six is eighteen . I get one half , and Helena gets the other . When we ask what it means , and when friends ask what it means , papa has got the same answer for everybody , ' I have my reasons . ' That 's all he says - and that 's all I say . "
20854	20876	20851	20851	He	723	" Let me tell you , Miss Gracedieu , it is not becoming in a young lady to mystify her elders . "
20912	20933	20934	20935	A woman	222	" If you please , sir , write to papa . You will find that I have spoken the truth . "
20946	20951	20934	20935	A woman	222	" Dinner , ma'am . "
21158	21162	21155	21155	Mr.	735	" Very odd ; "
21193	21199	21184	21185	young Master	737	" I had got religion . "
21216	21222	21223	21223	she	52	" Nobody but a simpleton , "
21226	21285	21223	21223	she	52	" would have contradicted me as you did . Who but you could have failed to see that papa 's strange objection to let it be known which of us is the elder makes us ridiculous before other people ? My presence of mind prevented that . You ought to have been grateful , and held your tongue . "
21620	21630	21615	21615	she	59	" Perfectly beautiful , Eunice , is n't it ? "
21641	21653	21638	21638	She	59	" You strange girl , what do you mean by that ? "
21673	21733	21670	21670	I	0	" I never saw the flesh of any person 's face like the flesh in the faces which that man paints . He reminds me of wax - work . Why does he paint the same waxy flesh in all four of his pictures ? I do n't see the same colored flesh in all the faces about us . "
21750	21767	21747	21747	She	59	" Do n't speak so loud , Eunice ; you are only exposing your own ignorance . "
21779	21800	21775	21776	The voice	749	" Excuse me , Mrs. Staveley , if I expose my ignorance . I entirely agree with the young lady . "
22032	22037	22026	22026	I	0	" Who is he ? "
22047	22052	22043	22043	I	0	" Who is he ? "
22056	22063	22053	22053	She	59	" He is young Mr. Dunboyne . "
22067	22074	22064	22064	I	0	" Does he live in London ? "
22083	22090	22079	22079	I	0	" Does he live in London ? "
22094	22113	22091	22091	She	59	" He is here for a holiday ; he lives with his father at Fairmount , in Ireland . "
22209	22212	22195	22199	one of our two servants	761	" bewitched . "
22600	22617	22594	22595	Mrs. Staveley	59	" We are going to have a dinner - party . Shall I ask Philip Dunboyne ? "
22624	22629	22618	22618	I	0	" Oh , do ! "
23151	23175	23146	23147	Mrs. Staveley	59	" I suppose , Eunice , you have often been told that you have a good figure , and that you walk well ? "
23179	23203	23176	23176	I	0	" Helena thinks my figure is better than my face . But do I really walk well ? Nobody ever told me that . "
23207	23259	23204	23204	She	59	" Philip Dunboyne thinks so . He said to me , ' I resist the temptation because I might be wanting in respect if I gave way to it . But I should like to follow her when she goes out - merely for the pleasure of seeing her walk . ' "
23313	23354	23310	23310	She	59	" I am interested in Philip . I lived near Fairmount in the time before I was married ; and in those days he was a child . I want him to marry a charming girl , and be happy . "
23441	23511	23439	23439	herself	59	" Philip is not much liked , poor fellow , in our house . My husband considers him to be weak and vain and fickle . And my daughter agrees with her father . There are times when she is barely civil to Philip . He is too good - natured to complain , but I see it . Tell me , my dear , do you like Philip ? "
23512	23518	23439	23439	herself	59	" Of course I do ! "
23573	23598	23560	23560	She	59	" My dear , you are as clear as crystal , and as true as steel . You are a favorite of mine already . "
23628	23631	23625	23625	She	59	" Better . "
23869	23875	23863	23863	I	0	" He thinks you charming . "
23937	23941	23933	23934	Mrs. Staveley	59	" No profession . "
23954	23959	23951	23951	I	0	" Is he idle ? "
23964	23982	23960	23961	Mrs. Staveley	59	" My dear , he is an only son - and his father is a rich man . "
24713	24756	24711	24711	them	843	" Here we are all alone in the wilderness - alone in the wilderness - in the wilderness alone , alone , alone - here we are in the wilderness - alone in the wilderness - all all alone in the wilderness , "
24869	24881	24863	24863	He	47	" You are getting tired of this . And so am I. "
24882	24890	24891	24891	I	0	" I am trying to like it , "
24895	24900	24901	24901	he	47	" Do n't try , "
24904	24909	24901	24901	he	47	" Let 's talk . "
24976	24993	24973	24973	He	47	" Is it really true that your visit to Mrs. Staveley is coming to an end ? "
24997	25010	24973	24973	He	47	" It comes to an end the day after to - morrow . "
25011	25023	25030	25030	he	47	" Are you sorry to be leaving your friends in London ? "
25072	25095	25063	25063	I	0	" You ca n't possibly be as sorry as I am , Eunice . May I call you by your pretty name ? "
25096	25103	25067	25067	him	47	" Yes , if you please . "
25104	25107	25067	25067	him	47	" Eunice ! "
25108	25111	25063	25063	I	0	" Yes . "
25112	25126	25067	25067	him	47	" You will leave a blank in my life when you go away - "
25212	25248	25209	25209	He	47	" Will you help me to think of you while you are away ? I want to imagine what your life is at home . Do you live in a town or in the country ? "
25308	25321	25305	25305	I	0	" Would you rather have heard that I live in the country ? "
25322	25358	25359	25359	I	0	" Live where you may , Eunice , the place will be a favorite place of mine . Besides , your town is famous . It has a public attraction which brings visitors to it . "
25399	25419	25390	25390	He	860	" I alluded to a building hundreds of years older than your market - place - your beautiful cathedral . "
25533	25562	25530	25530	He	58	" Do you know , I take the greatest interest in cathedrals . I propose to enjoy the privilege and pleasure of seeing your cathedral early next week . "
25589	25597	25598	25598	He	58	" paying his respects to Mr. Gracedieu . "
25656	25662	25653	25653	I	0	" Oh dear , no ! "
25695	25698	25688	25691	One hideous old woman	878	" Silence ! "
25754	25760	25748	25748	He	47	" Expect me next week . "
25923	25950	25920	25920	She	59	" How do you feel after the concert ? You must be hard to please indeed if you were not satisfied with the accompaniments last night . "
25951	25958	25920	25920	She	59	" The accompaniments of the Oratorio ? "
25959	25970	25971	25971	I	0	" No , my dear . The accompaniments of Philip . "
25996	26013	25993	25993	I	0	" I hope Mr. Dunboyne 's father will not hear how kind he was to me . "
26029	26037	26026	26026	I	0	" Because papa is a poor man . "
26038	26048	26050	26051	Mrs. Staveley	59	" And Philip 's papa is a rich man , "
26062	26082	26050	26051	Mrs. Staveley	59	" Where do you get these ideas , Eunice ? Surely , you are not allowed to read novels ? "
26083	26087	26026	26026	I	0	" Oh no ! "
26088	26098	26026	26026	I	0	" And you have certainly never seen a play ? "
26099	26102	26050	26051	Mrs. Staveley	59	" Never . "
26103	26212	26213	26213	I	0	" Clear your head , child , of the nonsense that has got into it - I ca n't think how . Rich Mr. Dunboyne has taught his heir to despise the base act of marrying for money . He knows that Philip will meet young ladies at my house ; and he has written to me on the subject of his son 's choice of a wife . ' Let Philip find good principles , good temper , and good looks ; and I promise beforehand to find the money . ' There is what he says . Are you satisfied with Philip 's father , now ? "
26314	26318	26319	26319	she	59	" Bad news ? "
26353	26438	26347	26347	Helena	52	" I must prepare you for a surprise , before your return . You will find a strange lady established at home . Do n't suppose there is any prospect of her bidding us good - by , if we only wait long enough . She is already with father 's full approval as much a member of the family as we are . You shall form your own unbiased opinion of her , Eunice . For the present , I say no more . "
26455	26473	26452	26452	She	59	" Your father approves of the lady , my dear . I suppose it 's good news . "
26583	26596	26575	26575	I	0	" Yes , miss ; a lady , to see the master . "
26597	26601	26575	26575	I	0	" A stranger ? "
26602	26615	26616	26616	I	0	" Never saw her before , miss , in all my life . "
26768	26779	26780	26780	I	0	" Has anything happened , father , to vex you ? "
26783	26786	26780	26780	I	0	" Yes . "
26787	26795	26762	26762	he	615	" Is the lady concerned in it ? "
26796	26803	26762	26762	he	615	" What lady , my dear ? "
26804	26816	26780	26780	I	0	" The lady who called on you while I was out . "
26817	26827	26762	26762	he	615	" Who told you she had called on me ? "
26828	26833	26762	26762	he	615	" I asked Maria - "
26834	26845	26846	26846	He	615	" That will do , Helena , for the present . "
26928	26967	26924	26926	the mysterious lady	913	" She looked between young and old . And , oh dear me , she was certainly not pretty . Not dressed nicely , to my mind ; but they do say dress is a matter of taste . "
27031	27046	27023	27024	The cook	629	" I ca n't say I saw the lady ; but I heard her . "
27047	27057	27023	27024	The cook	629	" Do you mean that you heard her speaking ? "
27058	27065	27023	27024	The cook	629	" No , miss - crying . "
27066	27072	27023	27024	The cook	629	" Where was she crying ? "
27073	27080	27023	27024	The cook	629	" In the master 's study . "
27081	27090	27023	27024	The cook	629	" How did you come to hear her ? "
27091	27106	27023	27024	The cook	629	" Am I to understand , miss , that you suspect me of listening ? "
27152	27166	27147	27147	she	629	" I was passing the door , miss , on my way upstairs . "
27271	27282	27266	27266	he	615	" Excuse me , Helena , I want to think . "
27360	27390	27351	27351	he	615	" You are looking pale , Helena , and you will be the better for a little fresh air . Besides , I have something to say to you . "
27461	27470	27471	27471	he	615	" When that lady called on me yesterday , "
27474	27582	27471	27471	he	615	" you wanted to know who she was , and you were surprised and disappointed when I refused to gratify your curiosity . My silence was not a selfish silence , Helena . I was thinking of you and your sister ; and I was at a loss how to act for the best . You shall hear why my children were in my mind , presently . I must tell you first that I have arrived at a decision ; I hope and believe on reasonable grounds . Ask me any questions you please ; my silence will be no longer an obstacle in your way . "
27594	27605	27589	27589	I	0	" I should like to know who the lady is . "
27606	27614	27615	27615	he	935	" The lady is related to me , "
27618	27623	27589	27589	I	0	" We are cousins . "
27678	27686	27687	27687	I	0	" Is your cousin a married lady ? "
27692	27695	27687	27687	I	0	" No . "
27767	27778	27779	27779	I	0	" Have I or my sister ever seen the lady ? "
27782	27805	27779	27779	I	0	" Never . She has been living abroad ; and I have not seen her myself since we were both young people . "
27880	27892	27893	27893	I	0	" After the long interval that has passed since you met , "
27896	27906	27893	27893	I	0	" I suppose she has become an old woman ? "
27907	27923	27893	27893	I	0	" No , my dear . Let us say , a middle - aged woman . "
27924	27933	27934	27934	He	943	" Perhaps she is still an attractive person ? "
27937	27956	27934	27934	He	943	" I am afraid , Helena , that would never have been a very accurate description of her . "
27984	27996	27997	27997	I	0	" We have been talking about the lady for some time , "
28000	28011	27997	27997	I	0	" and you have not yet told me her name . "
28017	28026	28027	28027	he	943	" It 's not a very pretty name , "
28030	28043	28027	28027	he	943	" My cousin , my unfortunate cousin , is - Miss Jillgall . "
28051	28054	28044	28044	I	0	" Oh ! "
28106	28118	28119	28119	I	0	" The next time Miss Jillgall honors you with a visit , "
28122	28135	28119	28119	I	0	" you must give me an opportunity of being presented to her . "
28142	28156	28136	28136	He	65	" You may find your opportunity , Helena , sooner than you anticipate . "
28183	28196	28180	28180	I	0	" Oh , father , another lady fascinated by the popular preacher ? "
28221	28227	28204	28204	He	65	" This is my fault . "
28228	28234	28235	28235	I	0	" What is your fault ? "
28238	28389	28204	28204	He	65	" I have left you in ignorance , my dear , of my cousin 's sad story . It is soon told ; and , if it checks your merriment , it will make amends by deserving your sympathy . I was indebted to her father , when I was a boy , for acts of kindness which I can never forget . He was twice married . The death of his first wife left him with one child - once my playfellow ; now the lady whose visit has excited your curiosity . His second wife was a Belgian . She persuaded him to sell his business in London , and to invest the money in a partnership with a brother of hers , established as a sugar - refiner at Antwerp . The little daughter accompanied her father to Belgium . Are you attending to me , Helena ? "
28411	28417	28418	28418	he	952	" As time went on , "
28421	28510	28418	28418	he	952	" the new partner found that the value of the business at Antwerp had been greatly overrated . After a long struggle with adverse circumstances , he decided on withdrawing from the partnership before the whole of his capital was lost in a failing commercial speculation . The end of it was that he retired , with his daughter , to a small town in East Flanders ; the wreck of his property having left him with an income of no more than two hundred pounds a year . "
28552	28560	28561	28561	he	952	" It is too shameful a story , "
28564	28610	28561	28561	he	952	" to be told to a young girl . The marriage was dissolved by law ; and the wife was the person to blame . I am sure , Helena , you do n't wish to hear any more of this part of the story . "
28631	28637	28638	28638	he	952	" The father and daughter , "
28642	28836	28638	28638	he	952	" never so much as thought of returning to their own country . They were too poor to live comfortably in England . In Belgium their income was sufficient for their wants . On the father 's death , the daughter remained in the town . She had friends there , and friends nowhere else ; and she might have lived abroad to the end of her days , but for a calamity to which we are all liable . A long and serious illness completely prostrated her . Skilled medical attendance , costing large sums of money for the doctors ' traveling expenses , was imperatively required . Experienced nurses , summoned from a distant hospital , were in attendance night and day . Luxuries , far beyond the reach of her little income , were absolutely required to support her wasted strength at the time of her tedious recovery . In one word , her resources were sadly diminished , when the poor creature had paid her debts , and had regained her hold on life . At that time , she unhappily met with the man who has ruined her . "
28844	28848	28849	28849	I	0	" Ruined her ? "
28852	28861	28849	28849	I	0	" Do you mean that he robbed her ? "
28862	28990	28638	28638	he	952	" That , Helena , is exactly what I mean - and many and many a helpless woman has been robbed in the same way . The man of whom I am now speaking was a lawyer in large practice . He bore an excellent character , and was highly respected for his exemplary life . My cousin not at all a discreet person , I am bound to admit was induced to consult him on her pecuniary affairs . He expressed the most generous sympathy - offered to employ her little capital in his business - and pledged himself to pay her double the interest for her money , which she had been in the habit of receiving from the sound investment chosen by her father . "
28991	29006	28849	28849	I	0	" And of course he got the money , and never paid the interest ? "
29030	29042	29022	29023	My father	615	" He paid the interest regularly as long as he lived . "
29043	29051	28638	28638	he	952	" And what happened when he died ? "
29052	29103	29022	29023	My father	615	" He died a bankrupt ; the secret profligacy of his life was at last exposed . Nothing , actually nothing , was left for his creditors . The unfortunate creature , whose ugly name has amused you , must get help somewhere , or must go to the workhouse . "
29201	29236	29194	29195	My father	615	" My dear , they were poor people , and did all they could afford to do . But for their kindness , my cousin might not have been able to return to England . "
29237	29246	29247	29247	I	0	" And to cast herself on your mercy , "
29250	29259	29247	29247	I	0	" in the character of a helpless woman . "
29260	29317	29318	29318	I	0	" No , Helena ! Not to cast herself on my mercy - but to find my house open to her , as her father 's house was open to me in the bygone time . I am her only surviving relative ; and , while I live , she shall not be a helpless woman . "
29355	29368	29369	29369	he	615	" I understand the momentary bitterness of feeling that has escaped you , "
29372	29524	29369	29369	he	615	" I may almost say that I expected it . My only hesitation in this matter has been caused by my sense of what I owe to my children . It was putting your endurance , and your sister 's endurance , to a trial to expect you to receive a stranger and that stranger not a young girl like yourselves as one of the household , living with you in the closest intimacy of family life . The consideration which has decided me does justice , I hope , to you and Eunice , as well as to myself . I think that some allowance is due from my daughters to the father who has always made loving allowance for them . Am I wrong in believing that my good children have not forgotten this , and have only waited for the occasion to feel the pleasure of rewarding me ? "
29566	29604	29553	29553	I	0	" She is staying , Helena , at a small hotel in the town . I have already sent to say that we are waiting to see her . Perhaps you will look at the spare bedroom ? "
29605	29616	29617	29617	I	0	" It shall be got ready , father , directly . "
29805	29815	29816	29816	I	0	" Dear girl , what friends we shall be ! "
29927	29935	29936	29936	he	615	" Wait for a day or two , "
29939	29953	29936	29936	he	615	" and then form your estimate of the new member of our household . "
30598	30603	30604	30604	she	66	" You charming girl , "
30607	30709	30604	30604	she	66	" your bright face encourages me to ask a favor . Pray make me useful ! The one aspiration of my life is to be useful . Unless you employ me in that way , I have no right to intrude myself into your family circle . Yes , yes , I know that your father has opened his house and his heart to me . But I dare not found any claim - your name is Helena , is n't it ? Dear Helena , I dare not found any claim on what I owe to your father 's kindness . "
30710	30714	30715	30715	I	0	" Why not ? "
30718	30727	30715	30715	I	0	" Because your father is not a man - "
30736	30743	30715	30715	I	0	" What is he , then ? "
30744	30748	30749	30750	Miss Jillgall	66	" An angel , "
30755	30777	30749	30750	Miss Jillgall	66	" A destitute earthly creature like me must not look up as high as your father . I might be dazzled . "
30788	30793	30794	30794	I	0	" Let us try , "
30797	30809	30794	30794	I	0	" if we ca n't understand each other , at starting . "
30821	30831	30832	30832	she	991	" The very thing I was going to propose ! "
30836	30840	30832	30832	she	991	" Very well , "
30845	30862	30841	30841	I	0	" then , let me tell you plainly that flattery is not relished in this house . "
30863	30866	30867	30867	She	991	" Flattery ? "
30885	30919	30869	30869	her	991	" Dear Helena , I have lived all my life in East Flanders , and my own language is occasionally strange to me . Can you tell me what flattery is in Flemish ? "
30920	30927	30841	30841	I	0	" I do n't understand Flemish . "
30928	30973	30974	30974	She	991	" How very provoking ! You do n't understand Flemish , and I do n't understand Flattery . I should so like to know what it means . Ah , I see books in this lovely room . Is there a dictionary among them ? "
30985	30992	30993	30993	she	991	" Now I shall understand Flattery , "
30996	31014	31015	31015	She	991	" and then we shall understand each other . Oh , let me find it for myself ! "
31032	31095	31096	31096	She	991	" ' FAD . ' That wo n't do . ' FIE . ' Further on still . ' FLE . ' Too far the other way . ' FLA . ' Here we are ! ' Flattery : False praise . Commendation bestowed for the purpose of gaining favor and influence . ' Oh , Helena , how cruel of you ! "
31253	31262	31263	31264	Miss Jillgall	66	" If you will make me love you , "
31267	31361	31263	31264	Miss Jillgall	66	" you must expect to be kissed . Dear girl , let us go back to my poor little petition . Oh , do make me useful ! There are so many things I can do : you will find me a treasure in the house . I write a good hand ; I understand polishing furniture ; I can dress hair look at my own hair ; I play and sing a little when people want to be amused ; I can mix a salad and knit stockings - who is this ? "
31379	31384	31386	31387	Miss Jillgall	66	" And , oh , "
31392	31407	31386	31387	Miss Jillgall	66	" I can cook ! Do , please , let me see the kitchen . "
31457	31492	31448	31448	she	629	" I must ask you , miss , to let me send up the cauliflower plain boiled ; I do n't understand the directions in the book for doing it in the foreign way . "
31529	31532	31533	31533	she	629	" Here , "
31536	31669	31533	31533	she	629	" is an opportunity of making myself useful ! What is the cook 's name ? Hannah ? Take me downstairs , Hannah , and I 'll show you how to do the cauliflower in the foreign way . She seems to hesitate . Is it possible that she does n't believe me ? Listen , Hannah , and judge for yourself if I am deceiving you . Have you boiled the cauliflower ? Very well ; this is what you must do next . Take four ounces of grated cheese , two ounces of best butter , the yolks of four eggs , a little bit of glaze , lemon - juice , nutmeg - dear , dear , how black she looks . What have I said to offend her ? "
31698	31726	31694	31694	herself	629	" If I am to be interfered with in my own kitchen , miss , I will ask you to suit yourself at a month 's notice . "
31735	31741	31742	31742	she	66	" I meant so kindly , "
31745	31784	31785	31785	she	66	" and I seem to have made mischief . With the best intentions , Helena , I have set you and your servant at variance . I really did n't know you had such a temper , Hannah , "
31795	31884	31886	31887	Miss Jillgall	66	" I 'm sure there 's nothing I am not ready to do to make it up with you . Perhaps you have not got the cheese downstairs ? I 'm ready to go out and buy it for you . I could show you how to keep eggs sweet and fresh for weeks together . Your gown does n't fit very well ; I shall be glad to improve it , if you will leave it out for me after you have gone to bed . There ! "
31903	31948	31890	31891	the cook	629	" I have done my best to make it up , and you see how my advances are received . What more could I have done ? I really ask you , dear , as a friend , what more could I have done ? "
31961	32003	31949	31949	I	0	" The cook does n't ask you to buy cheese for her , or to teach her how to keep eggs , or to improve the fit of her gown ; all she wants is to have her kitchen to herself . "
32022	32029	32030	32030	I	0	" Pray do n't distress yourself , "
32033	32046	32030	32030	I	0	" I am sure you are not to blame , Miss Jillgall - "

32054	32060	32030	32030	I	0	" Do n't - what ? "
32061	32078	32030	32030	I	0	" Do n't call me Miss Jillgall . I call you Helena . Call me Selina . "

32169	32231	32164	32164	she	72	" Is that it , indeed ? An explanation was all I wanted . How good of you ! And now tell me - is there no chance , in the house or out of the house , of my making myself useful ? Oh , what 's that ? Do I see a chance ? I do ! I do ! "
32303	32314	32297	32297	She	66	" My heart is light , my will is free - "
32699	32706	32707	32707	he	615	" Quite right , my child , "
32881	33041	33043	33043	yours	1026	" DEAR SIR - You have , I hope , not quite forgotten the interesting conversation that we had last year in the Governor 's rooms . I am afraid I spoke a little flippantly at the time ; but I am sure you will believe me when I say that this was out of no want of respect to yourself . My pecuniary position being far from prosperous , I am endeavoring to obtain the vacant situation of housekeeper in a public institution the prospectus of which I inclose . You will see it is a rule of the place that a candidate must be a single woman which I am , and must be recommended by a clergyman . You are the only reverend gentleman whom it is my good fortune to know , and the thing is of course a mere formality . Pray excuse this application , and oblige me by acting as my reference . "

In that idle position he could hardly complain of me for interrupting him , if I ventured to talk about the letters which I had put together . If my curiosity displeased him , he had only to say so , and there would be an end to any allusions of mine to the subject . My first idea was to join him at the window . On reflection , and still perceiving that he kept his back turned on me , I thought it might be more prudent to remain at the table . "

33325	33415	33274	33275	Miss Chance	41	" Here were three answers which Eunice herself would have been quick enough to interpret as three warnings to say no more . I felt a little hurt by his keeping his back turned on me . At the same time , and naturally , I think , I found my interest in Miss Chance I do n't say my friendly interest considerably increased by my father 's unusually rude behavior . I was also animated by an irresistible desire to make him turn round and look at me . "
33426	33430	33431	33431	I	0	" I resumed . "
33444	33445	33439	33439	she	41	" "
33452	33453	33446	33446	I	0	" "

33477	33478	33475	33475	Helena	52	" "
33483	33494	33475	33475	Helena	52	" I declare he looked as if he suspected me ! "
33502	33506	33498	33498	you	52	" he said . "
33550	33551	33543	33543	you	52	" "
33587	33588	33578	33578	you	3936	" "
33617	33693	33603	33603	I	0	" This roused my temper . When a young lady is told that she is vulgar , if she has any self - conceit - I mean self - respect - she feels insulted . I said something sharp in my turn . It was in the way of argument . I do not know how it may be with other young persons , I never reason so well myself as when I am angry . "
33701	33705	33694	33694	You	3936	" I said , "
33714	33715	33708	33708	you	3936	" "
33727	33731	33717	33717	you	3936	" he asked . "
33735	33755	33717	33717	you	3936	" I answered . He changed again . After having looked unaccountably angry , he now looked unaccountably relieved . "
33762	33766	33756	33756	I	0	" he said , "
33873	33877	33853	33853	you	3936	" I could say "
33879	33917	33918	33918	I	0	" to this with a safe conscience . But there were some perplexities still left in my mind . It seemed strange that Miss Chance should apparently have submitted to the severity of my father 's reply . "
33923	33929	33931	33931	she	41	" I said to him , "
33957	33958	33959	33959	She	41	" "
33989	34096	34101	34101	Helena	52	" He spoke in a loud voice , with a flushed face - as if it was quite a triumph to have prevented this woman from discovering his address . What reason could he have for being so anxious to keep her away from him ? Could I venture to conclude that there was a mystery in the life of a man so blameless , so truly pious ? It shocked one even to think of it . There was a silence between us , to which the housemaid offered a welcome interruption . Dinner was ready . He kissed me before we left the room . "
34103	34107	34101	34101	Helena	52	" he said , "
34125	34243	34122	34123	Elizabeth Chance	41	" CHAPTER XVII . HELENA 'S DIARY . Miss Jillgall joined us at the dinner - table , in a state of excitement , carrying a book in her hand . I am inclined , on reflection , to suspect that she is quite clever enough to have discovered that I hate her - and that many of the aggravating things she says and does are assumed , out of retaliation , for the purpose of making me angry . That ugly face is a double face , or I am much mistaken . To return to the dinner - table , Miss Jillgall addressed herself , with an air of playful penitence , to my father . "
34320	34330	34331	34332	Doctor Watts	76	" My father looked at the title - page : "
34350	34351	34338	34338	Selina	72	" "
34380	34390	34399	34401	my other daughter	1045	" My patient father turned to the blank page . "
34393	34398	34399	34401	my other daughter	1045	" he said quietly , "
34419	34427	34430	34430	my	0	" Miss Jillgall clasped her hands distractedly . "
34466	34479	34461	34461	you	72	" The dinner was getting cold . I was provoked into saying : "
34486	34499	34482	34482	we	1049	" She had evidently not forgiven me for leaving her by herself . "
34537	34550	34531	34532	Dear cousin	1041	" Even my father declined to wait for his dinner any longer . "
34592	34597	34586	34586	me	0	" Miss Jillgall groaned . "
34648	34778	34795	34795	Euneece	77	" I discovered another of Miss Jillgall 's peculiarities . Her appetite was enormous , and her ways were greedy . You heard her eat her soup . She devoured the food on her plate with her eyes before she put it into her mouth ; and she criticised our English cookery in the most impudent manner , under pretense of asking humbly how it was done . There was , however , some temporary compensation for this . We had less of her talk while she was eating her dinner . With the removal of the cloth , she recovered the use of her tongue ; and she hit on the one subject of all others which proves to be the sorest trial to my father 's patience . "
34811	34812	34807	34807	she	77	" "
34819	34820	34807	34807	she	77	" "
34842	34843	34845	34846	the one	1060	" "
34853	34854	34845	34846	the one	1060	" "
34920	35016	35017	35017	I	0	" When the subject of our ages was unluckily started at Mrs. Staveley 's , I had slipped out of the difficulty easily by assuming the character of the eldest sister - an example of ready tact which my dear stupid Eunice does n't understand . In my father 's presence , it is needless to say that I kept silence , and left it to him . I was sorry to be obliged to do this . Owing to his sad state of health , he is easily irritated - especially by inquisitive strangers . "
35022	35040	35020	35020	you	1064	" he answered , without taking the slightest notice of what Miss Jillgall had said to him . "
35048	35059	35063	35063	me	0	" She stopped him on his way to the door . "
35071	35072	35063	35063	me	0	" "
35078	35079	35074	35074	you	1064	" "
35095	35096	35097	35097	You	1064	" "
35101	35126	35097	35097	You	1064	" Miss Jillgall 's demonstrative hands flew up into the air again , and expressed the climax of astonishment by quivering over her head . "
35132	35136	35097	35097	You	1064	" she declared . "
35142	35143	35148	35148	cousin	1066	" "
35160	35182	35145	35145	my	0	" He left the room . Miss Jillgall appealed to me . I imitated my father 's wise brevity of expression : "
35203	35360	35145	35145	my	0	" Every step of the way up to the drawing - room was marked by a protest or an inquiry . Did I expect her to believe that I could n't say which of us was the elder of the two ? that I did n't really know what my father 's motive was for this extraordinary mystification ? that my sister and I had submitted to be robbed , as it were , of our own ages , and had not insisted on discovering which of us had come into the world first ? that our friends had not put an end to this sort of thing by comparing us personally , and discovering which was the elder sister by investigation of our faces ? To all this I replied : First , that I did certainly expect her to believe whatever I might say : Secondly , that what she was pleased to call the "
35362	35718	35809	35809	My	0	" had begun when we were both children ; that habit had made it familiar to us in the course of years ; and above all , that we were too fond of our good father to ask for explanations which we knew by experience would distress him : Thirdly , that friends did try to discover , by personal examination , which was the elder sister , and differed perpetually in their conclusions ; also that we had amused ourselves by trying the same experiment before our looking - glasses , and that Eunice thought Helena was the oldest , and Helena thought Eunice was the oldest : Fourthly and finally , that the Reverend Mr. Gracedieu 's cousin had better drop the subject , unless she was bent on making her presence in the house unendurable to the Reverend Mr. Gracedieu himself . I write it with a sense of humiliation ; Miss Jillgall listened attentively to all I had to say - and then took me completely by surprise . This inquisitive , meddlesome , restless , impudent woman suddenly transformed herself into a perfect model of amiability and decorum . She actually said she agreed with me , and was much obliged for my good advice ! A stupid young woman , in my place , would have discovered that this was not natural , and that Miss Jillgall was presenting herself to me in disguise , to reach some secret end of her own . I am not a stupid young woman ; I ought to have had at my service penetration enough to see through and through Cousin Selina . Well ! Cousin Selina was an impenetrable mystery to me . The one thing to be done was to watch her . I was at least sly enough to take up a book , and pretend to be reading it . How contemptible ! She looked round the room , and discovered our pretty writing - table ; a present to my father from his congregation . After a little consideration , she sat down to write a letter . "
35726	35768	35809	35809	My	0	" she asked . I mentioned the hour ; and she began her letter . Before she could have written more than the first two or three lines , she turned round on her seat , and began talking to me . "
35778	35779	35770	35770	you	1068	" "
35792	35793	35794	35797	Only a few friends	1070	" "
35973	36177	35961	35961	I	0	" She twisted herself back again to the writing - table , and went on with her letter . I have not attempted to conceal my stupidity . Let me now record a partial recovery of my intelligence . It was not to be denied that Miss Jillgall had discovered a good reason for writing to her friend ; but I was at a loss to understand why she should have been so anxious to mention the reason . Was it possible - after the talk which had passed between us - that she had something mischievous to say in her letter , relating to my father or to me ? Was she afraid I might suspect this ? And had she been so communicative for the purpose of leading my suspicions astray ? These were vague guesses ; but , try as I might , I could arrive at no clearer view of what was passing in Miss Jillgall 's mind . What would I not have given to be able to look over her shoulder , without discovery ! She finished her letter , and put the address , and closed the envelope . Then she turned round toward me again . "
36188	36605	35961	35961	I	0	" If I could look at nothing else , I was resolved to look at her envelope . It was only necessary to go to the study , and to apply to my father . I returned with the foreign stamp , and I stuck it on the envelope with my own hand . There was nothing to interest me in the address , as I ought to have foreseen , if I had not been too much excited for the exercise of a little common sense . Miss Jillgall 's wonderful friend was only remarkable by her ugly foreign name - MRS . TENBRUGGEN . CHAPTER XVIII . EUNICE 'S DIARY . Here I am , writing my history of myself , once more , by my own bedside . Some unexpected events have happened while I have been away . One of them is the absence of my sister . Helena has left home on a visit to a northern town by the seaside . She is staying in the house of a minister one of papa 's friends , and is occupying a position of dignity in which I should certainly lose my head . The minister and his wife and daughters propose to set up a Girls ' Scripture Class , on the plan devised by papa ; and they are at a loss , poor helpless people , to know how to begin . Helena has volunteered to set the thing going . And there she is now , advising everybody , governing everybody , encouraging everybody - issuing directions , finding fault , rewarding merit - oh , dear , let me put it all in one word , and say : thoroughly enjoying herself . Another event has happened , relating to papa . It so distressed me that I even forgot to think of Philip - for a little while . Traveling by railway I suppose because I am not used to it gives me the headache . When I got to our station here , I thought it would do me more good to walk home than to ride in the noisy omnibus . Half - way between the railway and the town , I met one of the doctors . He is a member of our congregation ; and he it was who recommended papa , some time since , to give up his work as a minister and take a long holiday in foreign parts . "
36615	36620	36606	36606	I	0	" the doctor said . "
36646	36687	36634	36634	I	0	" It seemed that he had been observing papa , in chapel , from what he called his own medical point of view . He did not conceal from me that he had drawn conclusions which made him feel uneasy . "
36693	36697	36634	36634	I	0	" he said , "
36782	36959	36963	36963	her	1089	" Poor dear papa ! I did see a change in him for the worse - though I had only been away for so short a time . When I put my arms round his neck , and kissed him , he turned pale , and then flushed up suddenly : the tears came into his eyes . Oh , it was hard to follow the doctor 's advice , and not to cry , too ; but I succeeded in controlling myself . I sat on his knee , and made him tell me all that I have written here about Helena . This led to our talking next of the new lady , who is to live with us as a member of the family . I began to feel less uneasy at the prospect of being introduced to this stranger , when I heard that she was papa 's cousin . And when he mentioned her name , and saw how it amused me , his poor worn face brightened into a smile . "
36965	36969	36972	36972	yourself	1090	" he said , "
36994	37367	36974	36974	I	0	" The servants told me that Miss Jillgall was in the garden . I searched here , there , and everywhere , and failed to find her . The place was so quiet , it looked so deliciously pure and bright , after smoky dreary London , that I sat down at the further end of the garden and let my mind take me back to Philip . What was he doing at that moment , while I was thinking of him ? Perhaps he was in the company of other young ladies , who drew all his thoughts away to themselves ? Or perhaps he was writing to his father in Ireland , and saying something kindly and prettily about me ? Or perhaps he was looking forward , as anxiously as I do , to our meeting next week . I have had my plans , and I have changed my plans . On the railway journey , I thought I would tell papa at once of the new happiness which seems to have put a new life into me . It would have been delightful to make my confession to that first and best and dearest of friends ; but my meeting with the doctor spoiled it all . After what he had said to me , I discovered a risk . If I ventured to tell papa that my heart was set on a young gentleman who was a stranger to him , could I be sure that he would receive my confession favorably ? There was a chance that it might irritate him - and the fault would then be mine of doing what I had been warned to avoid . It might be safer in every way to wait till Philip paid his visit , and he and papa had been introduced to each other and charmed with each other . Could Helena herself have arrived at a wiser conclusion ? I declare I felt proud of my own discretion . In this enjoyable frame of mind I was disturbed by a woman 's voice . The tone was a tone of distress , and the words reached my ears from the end of the garden : "
37376	37481	37483	37483	her	1093	" A shrubbery marks the limit of our little bit of pleasure - ground . On the other side of it there is a cottage standing on the edge of the common . The most good - natured woman in the world lives here . She is our laundress - married to a stupid young fellow named Molly , and blessed with a plump baby as sweet - tempered at herself . Thinking it likely that the piteous voice which had disturbed me might be the voice of Mrs. Molly , I was astonished to hear her appealing to anybody perhaps to me ? to "
37486	37567	37483	37483	her	1093	" So I passed through the shrubbery , wondering whether the gate had been locked during my absence in London . No ; it was as easy to open as ever . The cottage door was not closed . I saw our amiable laundress in the passage , on her knees , trying to open an inner door which seemed to be locked . She had her eye at the keyhole ; and , once again , she called out : "
37576	37648	37570	37570	miss	4033	" I waited to see if the door would be opened - nothing happened . I waited again , to hear if some person inside would answer - nobody spoke . But somebody , or something , made a sound of splashing water on the other side of the door . I showed myself , and asked what was the matter . Mrs. Molly looked at me helplessly . She said : "
37657	37658	37649	37650	Miss Eunice	53	" "
37665	37682	37661	37662	the baby	1095	" I inquired . Mrs. Molly got on her feet , and whispered in my ear : "
37691	37692	37661	37662	the baby	1095	" "
37695	37696	37661	37662	the baby	1095	" "
37707	37708	37709	37710	What lady	4040	" "
37712	37713	37714	37715	Miss Jillgall	66	" "
37717	37743	37714	37715	Miss Jillgall	66	" The very person I had been trying to find ! I asked where she was . The laundress pointed dolefully to the locked door : "
37747	37748	37714	37715	Miss Jillgall	66	" "
37755	37765	37766	37766	I	0	" The poor woman still pointed to the door : "
37780	37781	37766	37766	I	0	" "
37799	37800	37801	37802	Miss Jillgall	66	" "
37805	37831	37801	37802	Miss Jillgall	66	" Her puzzled face made this singular reply more funny still . The splashing of water on the other side of the door began again . "
37839	37843	37834	37835	Miss Jillgall	66	" I said . "
38199	38222	38195	38195	I	0	" Mrs. Molly knocked , and the proverb proved to be true ; she got an answer from Miss Jillgall at last : "
38243	38275	38233	38233	you	0	" Who could help it ? - I burst out laughing . Miss Jillgall as I supposed from the tone of her voice took severe notice of this act of impropriety . "
38281	38286	38288	38288	yourself	0	" she called out ; "
38292	38346	38288	38288	yourself	0	" I gave my name . The door was instantly thrown open with a bang . Papa 's cousin appeared , in a disheveled state , with splashes of soap and water all over her . She held the child in one arm , and she threw the other arm round my neck . "
38365	38539	38360	38360	you	1122	" To the curious story of my introduction to Miss Jillgall , I ought perhaps to add that I have got to be friends with her already . I am the friend of anybody who amuses me . What will Helena say when she reads this ? CHAPTER XIX . EUNICE 'S DIARY . When people are interested in some event that is coming , do they find the dull days , passed in waiting for it , days which they are not able to remember when they look back ? This is my unfortunate case . Night after night , I have gone to bed without so much as opening my Journal . There was nothing worth writing about , nothing that I could recollect , until the postman came to - day . I ran downstairs , when I heard his ring at the bell , and stopped Maria on her way to the study . There , among papa 's usual handful of letters , was a letter for me . "
38545	38550	38551	38551	I	0	" Yours ever truly . "
38869	38885	38894	38898	The lady of his worship	4334	" an application made to the magistrates by the lady of his worship the Mayor . "
38951	39020	38942	38942	I	0	" In her address to the magistrates , the Mayoress stated that she had seen a disgusting photograph in the shop window of a stationer , lately established in the town . She desired to bring this person within reach of the law , and to have all his copies of the shameless photograph destroyed . The usher of the court was thereupon sent to purchase the photograph . "
39154	39160	39161	39161	she	82	" I shall expose Venus , "
39164	39170	39161	39161	she	82	" to the Lord Chancellor . "

39255	39268	39249	39249	they	1153	" to get a lesson in the ideal of beauty and grace . "
39464	39469	39470	39470	I	0	" Ask for papa , "
39511	39531	39501	39501	Maria	64	" Oh , miss , what a handsome young gentleman , and how beautifully dressed ! Is he - ? "
39880	39911	39877	39877	She	1180	" Go into the garden , miss , and you will find somebody there who is dying to see you . Mind you let him out by the shrubbery gate . "
39933	39940	39917	39917	I	0	" Hundreds of times , miss . "
40050	40062	40039	40039	we	1183	" Oh , Eunice , your father does n't like me ! "
40092	40107	40089	40089	I	0	" Trust my father 's goodness , trust his kindness , as I do . "
40177	40196	40174	40174	He	47	" Tell me , dear , is Mr. Gracedieu always as serious as he is to - day ? "
40197	40201	40174	40174	He	47	" Oh no ! "
40202	40217	40174	40174	He	47	" When he takes exercise , does he ride ? or does he walk ? "
40218	40223	40174	40174	He	47	" Papa always walks . "
40224	40228	40174	40174	He	47	" By himself ? "
40229	40249	40174	40174	He	47	" Sometimes by himself . Sometimes with me . Do you want to meet him when he goes out ? "
40250	40253	40174	40174	He	47	" Yes . "
40254	40262	40174	40174	He	47	" When he is out with me ? "
40263	40273	40174	40174	He	47	" No . When he is out by himself . "
40310	40319	40303	40303	He	1187	" Eunice ! do n't you understand me ? "
40333	40340	40320	40320	I	0	" No ; I do n't ! "
40341	40348	40349	40349	he	1187	" Then let me help you , "
40429	40469	40425	40425	Philip	47	" I want to ask your father to do me the greatest of all favors - and there is no time to lose . Every day , I expect to get a letter which may recall me to Ireland . "
40507	40600	40503	40503	He	47	" How am I to get my opportunity of speaking to Mr. Gracedieu ? I must n't call on him again as soon as to - morrow or next day . But I might meet him , out walking alone , if you will tell me how to do it . A note to my hotel is all I want . Do n't tremble , my sweet . If you are not present at the time , do you see any objection to my owning to your father that I love you ? "
40671	40700	40667	40667	He	1188	" When I have told your father that I love you , he will expect me to tell him something else . Can you guess what it is ? "
40746	40796	40730	40730	He	1188	" Dearest Eunice , when your father has heard my confession , he will suspect that there is another confession to follow it - he will want to know if you love me . My angel , will my hopes be your hopes too , when I answer him ? "
40849	40859	40846	40846	He	1190	" Say you love me , in a kiss ! "
40928	40932	40925	40925	he	1190	" kiss me , "

41378	41472	41473	41473	She	1208	" I know , dearest Euneece , that we have only been acquainted for a day or two and that I ought not perhaps to have expected you to confide in me so soon . Can I trust you not to betray me if I set an example of confidence ? Ah , I see I can trust you ! And , my dear , I do so enjoy telling secrets to a friend . Hush ! Your father , your excellent father , has been talking to me about young Mr. Dunboyne . "
41494	41500	41501	41501	she	1208	" I want to whisper , "
41523	41645	41514	41515	Miss Jillgall	66	" The minister has some reason , Euneece , for disapproving of Mr. Dunboyne ; but , mind this , I do n't think he has a bad opinion of the young man himself . He is going to return Mr. Dunboyne 's call . Oh , I do so hate formality ; I really ca n't go on talking of Mr. Dunboyne . Tell me his Christian name . Ah , what a noble name ! How I long to be useful to him ! Tomorrow , my dear , after the one o'clock dinner , your papa will call on Philip , at his hotel . I hope he wo n't be out , just at the wrong time . "
41698	41950	41683	41683	she	66	" It all looks bright enough so far , does n't it , dear sister ? Will you let me be your second sister ? I do so love you , Euneece . Thank you ! thank you ! But the gloomy side of the picture is to come next ! The minister - no ! now I am your sister I must call him papa ; it makes me feel so young again ! Well , then , papa has asked me to be your companion whenever you go out . ' Euneece is too young and too attractive to be walking about this great town in Helena 's absence by herself . ' That was how he put it . Slyly enough , if one may say so of so good a man . And he used your sister did n't he ? as a kind of excuse . I wish your sister was as nice as you are . However , the point is , why am I to be your companion ? Because , dear child , you and your young gentleman are not to make appointments and to meet each other alone . Oh , yes - that 's it ! Your father is quite willing to return Philip 's call ; he proposes as a matter of civility to Mrs. Staveley to ask Philip to dinner ; but , mark my words , he does n't mean to let Philip have you for his wife . "
41964	41967	41968	41968	I	0	" Oh , "
41971	41979	41968	41968	I	0	" can you be right about it ? "
42027	42037	42038	42038	she	1209	" When my views are directed by my affections , "
42042	42055	42038	42038	she	1209	" I never see wrong . My bosom is my strong point . "
42124	42131	42132	42132	I	0	" I mean to marry Philip , "
42135	42152	42132	42132	I	0	" Certainly , my dear Euneece . But please do n't be so fierce about it . "
42153	42164	42165	42165	I	0	" If my father does really object to my marriage , "
42169	42185	42165	42165	I	0	" it must be because he dislikes Philip . There can be no other reason . "
42186	42196	42132	42132	I	0	" Oh , yes , dear - there can . "
42197	42205	42132	42132	I	0	" What is the reason , then ? "
42206	42226	42165	42165	I	0	" That , my sweet girl , is one of the things that we have got to find out . "
42379	42383	42400	42400	he	47	" deliberately , obstinately "

42925	42931	42912	42912	I	0	" A chain of events . "
43106	43112	43102	43103	the friend	1259	" What a charming creature ! "
43237	43247	43248	43248	he	288	" I had the honor of meeting your sister , "
43251	43261	43248	43248	he	288	" in London , at Mr. Staveley 's house . "
43662	43704	43658	43658	She	53	" I have got a delicious surprise for you , my dear ; and I do so enjoy prolonging it . Tell me , Helena , what did you propose we should both do when we found ourselves at home again ? "
43723	43726	43719	43719	She	53	" Catch ! "
43743	43753	43754	43754	she	53	" We were to read each other 's diaries , "
43757	43765	43754	43754	she	53	" There is mine to begin with . "
43910	43921	43907	43907	she	1290	" My darling , why do n't you congratulate me ? "
43947	43952	43953	43953	I	0	" My dear Eunice , "
43956	43969	43953	43953	I	0	" let me beg you to excuse me . I am waiting - "
44021	44031	44032	44032	she	1290	" You have been away from home , too , "
44035	44064	44032	44032	she	1290	" Do I see in this serious face some astonishing news waiting to overpower me ? Have you found a sweetheart ? Are you engaged to be married ? "
44093	44099	44100	44100	she	1290	" Oh , my dear , "
44113	44138	44100	44100	she	1290	" There was but one possible reply to this : I laughed at it . Is Eunice 's head turned ? She kissed me ! "
44143	44147	44140	44140	you	0	" she said , "
44260	44283	44240	44240	you	0	" Her head was turned . I drew the poor soul 's attention compassionately to what I had said a moment since . "
44311	44312	44303	44303	I	0	" "
44316	44317	44303	44303	I	0	" "
44335	44421	44422	44422	My	0	" This explanation , offered with the kindest intentions , produced another change in my very variable sister . I had extinguished her good spirits as I might have extinguished a light . She sat down by me , and sighed in the saddest manner . The heart must be hard indeed which can resist the distress of a person who is dear to us . I put my arm round her ; she was becoming once more the Eunice whom I so dearly loved . "
44426	44430	44422	44422	My	0	" I said , "
44452	44458	44443	44444	Your father	3954	" She shook her head . "
44478	44479	44472	44472	He	3927	" "
44499	45036	44487	44487	I	0	" She was quite willing to enlighten me . It was a simple little story which , to my mind , sufficiently explained the strange behavior that had puzzled my unfortunate sister . There could indeed be no doubt that my father considered Eunice far too childish in character , as yet , to undertake the duties of matrimony . But , with his customary delicacy , and dread of causing distress to others , he had deferred the disagreeable duty of communicating his opinion to Mr. Dunboyne . The adverse decision must , however , be sooner or later announced ; and he had arranged to inflict disappointment , as tenderly as might be , at his own table . Considerately leaving Eunice in the enjoyment of any vain hopes which she may have founded on the event of the dinner - party , I passed the evening until supper - time came in the study with my father . Our talk was mainly devoted to the worthy people with whom I had been staying , and whose new schools I had helped to found . Not a word was said relating to my sister , or to Mr. Dunboyne . Poor father looked so sadly weary and ill that I ventured , after what the doctor had said to Eunice , to hint at the value of rest and change of scene to an overworked man . Oh , dear me , he frowned , and waved the subject away from him impatiently , with a wan , pale hand . After supper , I made an unpleasant discovery . Not having completely finished the unpacking of my boxes , I left Miss Jillgall and Eunice in the drawing - room , and went upstairs . In half an hour I returned , and found the room empty . What had become of them ? It was a fine moonlight night ; I stepped into the back drawing - room , and looked out of the window . There they were , walking arm - in - arm with their heads close together , deep in talk . With my knowledge of Miss Jillgall , I call this a bad sign . An odd thought has just come to me . I wonder what might have happened , if I had been visiting at Mrs. Staveley 's , instead of Eunice , and if Mr. Dunboyne had seen me first . Absurd ! if I was not too tired to do anything more , those last lines should be scratched out . CHAPTER XXII . EUNICE 'S DIARY . I said so to Miss Jillgall , and I say it again here . Nothing will induce me to think ill of Helena . My sister is a good deal tired , and a little out of temper after the railway journey . This is exactly what happened to me when I went to London . I attribute her refusal to let me read her journal , after she had read mine , entirely to the disagreeable consequences of traveling by railway . Miss Jillgall accounted for it otherwise , in her own funny manner : "
45053	45059	44487	44487	I	0	" I humored the joke : "
45079	45177	44487	44487	I	0	" This seemed to be a droll saying at the time . But it does n't look particularly amusing , now it is written down . We had ginger wine at supper , to celebrate Helena 's return . Although I only drank one glass , I daresay it may have got into my head . However that may be , when the lovely moonlight tempted us into the garden , there was an end to our jokes . We had something to talk about which still dwells disagreeably on my mind . Miss Jillgall began it . "
45204	45467	45468	45468	I	0	" I told my good little friend that she might depend on me , provided her secrets did no harm to any person whom I loved . She clasped her hands and looked up at the moon - I can only suppose that her sentiments overpowered her . She said , very prettily , that her heart and my heart beat together in heavenly harmony . It is needless to add that this satisfied me . Miss Jillgall 's generous confidence in my discretion was , I am afraid , not rewarded as it ought to have been . I found her tiresome at first . She spoke of an excellent friend a lady , who had helped her , at the time when she lost her little fortune , by raising a subscription privately to pay the expenses of her return to England . Her friend 's name - not very attractive to English ears - was Mrs. Tenbruggen ; they had first become acquainted under interesting circumstances . Miss Jillgall happened to mention that my father was her only living relative ; and it turned out that Mrs. Tenbruggen was familiar with his name , and reverenced his fame as a preacher . When he had generously received his poor helpless cousin under his own roof , Miss Jillgall 's gratitude and sense of duty impelled her to write and tell Mrs. Tenbruggen how happy she was as a member of our family . Let me confess that I began to listen more attentively when the narrative reached this point . "
45479	45488	45490	45490	I	0	" Miss Jillgall said , describing her letter ; "
45555	45568	45570	45570	she	49	" By this time , I was all eagerness to hear more . "
45575	45595	45570	45570	she	49	" I asked . Miss Jillgall looked at me affectionately , and took the reply out of her pocket . "
45612	45679	45609	45609	she	49	" ' Your letter , dear Selina , especially interests me by what it says about the two Miss Gracedieus . ' - Look , dear ; she underlines the word Two . Why , I ca n't explain . Can you ? Ah , I thought not . Well , let us get back to the letter . My accomplished friend continues in these terms : "
45840	45944	45835	45836	my friend	3475	" ' If you find anything new to tell me which relates to this interesting subject , direct your letter as before - provided you write within a week from the present time . Afterward , my letters will be received by the English physician whose card I inclose . You will be pleased to hear that my professional interests call me to London at the earliest moment that I can spare . ' - There , dear child , the letter comes to an end . I daresay you wonder what Mrs. T. means , when she alludes to her professional interests ? "
46068	46071	46064	46064	she	87	" Masseuse . "
46085	46089	46081	46081	I	0	" Medical Rubber , "
46184	46193	46194	46194	she	66	" Put two and two together , darling , "
46197	46210	46194	46194	she	66	" and , one of these days , they may make four . "
46288	46314	46281	46281	She	66	" With all my heart , dear . But do n't deceive yourself - the subject will turn up again when we least expect it . "
46958	46972	46950	46951	Miss Jillgall	66	" Go on by yourselves , and leave me to wait for her . "
47006	47022	47001	47001	He	47	" Miss Jillgall sees a chance of annoying your sister , and enjoys the prospect . "
47094	47149	47091	47091	I	0	" Let him see , dear , how clever you are , and how many things you know - and you ca n't imagine what a high place you will have in his opinion . I hope you do n't think I am taking too much on myself in telling you how to behave . "
47197	47203	47204	47204	he	47	" I do sincerely believe , "
47207	47247	47204	47204	he	47	" that you are the most innocent girl , the sweetest , truest girl that ever lived . I wish I was a better man , Eunice ; I wish I was good enough to be worthy of you ! "
47326	47335	47336	47336	he	47	" I want to be alone with you , "
47420	47429	47430	47430	she	52	" Why did n't you wait for me ? "
47439	47453	47454	47454	he	47	" If Eunice likes seeing the river better than waiting in the street , "
47457	47468	47454	47454	he	47	" is n't she free to do as she pleases ? "
47495	47505	47506	47506	I	0	" Surely Philip ca n't have quarreled with Helena ? "
47520	47537	47509	47510	Miss Jillgall	66	" Not he ! He is a great deal more likely to have quarreled with himself . "
47538	47541	47509	47510	Miss Jillgall	66	" Why ? "
47542	47549	47509	47510	Miss Jillgall	66	" Suppose you ask him why ? "
47568	47571	47572	47572	I	0	" Selina ! "
47575	47597	47572	47572	I	0	" there is something odd about you to - day . What is the matter ? I do n't understand you . "
47598	47612	47613	47613	I	0	" My poor dear , you will find yourself understanding me before long . "
47628	47633	47634	47634	I	0	" My poor dear ? "
47637	47648	47634	47634	I	0	" What makes you speak to me in that way ? "
47649	47673	47678	47678	she	66	" I do n't know - I 'm tired ; I 'm an old fool - I 'll go back to the house . "
47774	47784	47785	47785	he	47	" Have you any objection to follow her example ? "
47802	47814	47785	47785	he	47	" I do n't care for the banks of this river . "
47911	47922	47923	47923	she	52	" Let 's take him to the Girls ' School , "
47947	47961	47962	47962	He	47	" Oh , yes , of course . Deeply interesting ! deeply interesting ! "
47988	47995	47996	47996	Helena	52	" What a boy you are ! "
48199	48223	48196	48196	him	58	" Pray do n't suppose , Mr. Dunboyne , that you are intruding ; remain with us by all means if you like . "
48241	48263	48225	48225	he	58	" You could n't have come here , my dears , at a time when your presence was more urgently needed . "
48270	48296	48264	48264	He	58	" Tell my daughters what has happened ; tell them why they see me here - shocked and distressed , I do n't deny it . "
48393	48401	48402	48402	they	1394	" If we had been young ladies , "
48409	48432	48402	48402	they	1394	" more indulgence would have been shown to us ; we should have been allowed to read stories and to see plays . "
48483	48489	48490	48490	he	3927	" Here are my daughters , "
48493	48545	48490	48490	he	3927	" You will not deny that they are young ladies . Now listen . They shall tell you themselves whether my rules make any difference between them and you . Helena ! Eunice ! do I allow you to read novels ? do I allow you to go to the play ? "
48549	48551	48490	48490	he	3927	" No "
48571	48578	48579	48579	he	3927	" Answer some of the questions , "
48583	48598	48579	48579	he	3927	" from my Manual of Christian Obligation , which the girls call my catechism . "
48606	48642	48579	48579	he	3927	" If you are told to do unto others as you would they should do unto you , and if you find a difficulty in obeying that Divine Precept , what does your duty require ? "
48673	48692	48661	48661	She	52	" My duty requires me to go to the minister , and to seek for advice and encouragement . "
48693	48699	48769	48769	papa	58	" And if these fail ? "
48700	48767	48769	48769	papa	58	" Then I am to remember that my pastor is my friend . He claims no priestly authority or priestly infallibility . He is my fellow - Christian who loves me . He will tell me how he has himself failed ; how he has struggled against himself ; and what a blessed reward has followed his victory - a purified heart , a peaceful mind . "
48809	48859	48800	48800	He	58	" Is what you have just heard a part of my catechism ? Has my daughter been excused from repeating it because she is a young lady ? Where is the difference between the religious education which is given to my own child , and that given to you ? "
48898	48901	48892	48892	He	58	" Eunice ! "
49081	49088	49078	49078	I	0	" I ca n't do it . "
49110	49117	49107	49107	I	0	" I wo n't do it . "
49126	49145	49123	49123	he	47	" I am going to ask you something ; I insist on your answering , Yes or No . "
49163	49172	49173	49173	he	47	" Have you been taught like your sister ? "
49176	49204	49173	49173	he	47	" Has the catechism that has been her religious lesson , for all her life , been your religious lesson , for all your life , too ? "
49208	49210	49205	49205	I	0	" Yes "
49278	49296	49266	49266	his	58	" Do you feel sorry for what you have done ? Do you ask to be forgiven ? "
49315	49324	49306	49306	He	58	" Those two pupils are expelled the school . "
49355	49358	49348	49348	He	4220	" Silence ! "
49522	49525	49526	49526	I	0	" Oh , "
49533	49541	49526	49526	I	0	" what must you think of me ? "
49542	49553	49554	49554	he	47	" I will tell you what I think of you , "
49557	49611	49554	49554	he	47	" It is your father who is in fault , Eunice - not you . Nothing could have been in worse taste than his management of that trumpery affair in the schoolroom ; it was a complete mistake from beginning to end . Make your mind easy ; I do n't blame You . "
49612	49627	49664	49664	she	52	" Are you , really and truly , as fond of me as ever ? "
49628	49635	49554	49554	he	47	" Yes , to be sure ! "
49788	49796	49797	49797	he	47	" From my father , at last , "
49815	49915	49797	49797	he	47	" Do not be alarmed , my dear boy , at the change for the worse in my handwriting . I am suffering for my devotion to the studious habits of a lifetime : my right hand is attacked by the malady called Writer 's Cramp . The doctor here can do nothing . He tells me of some foreign woman , mentioned in his newspaper , who cures nervous derangements of all kinds by hand - rubbing , and who is coming to London . When you next hear from me , I may be in London too . "
50033	50055	50019	50019	her	1436	" Dear Helena , what has become of your beauty ? One would think you had left it in your room ! "
50064	50082	50060	50060	her	53	" Do n't joke about it , Selina : ca n't you see that Helena is ill ? "
51121	51130	51131	51133	the poor wretch	830	" We had arranged it all so nicely , "
51136	51205	51131	51133	the poor wretch	830	" Philip was to have been so clever and agreeable at dinner , and was to have chosen his time so very discreetly , that papa would have been ready to listen to anything he said . Oh , we should have succeeded ; I have n't a doubt of it ! Our only hope , Helena , is in you . What are we to do now ? "
51206	51209	51210	51210	I	0	" Wait , "
51213	51216	51217	51217	she	53	" Wait ? "
51222	51265	51217	51217	she	53	" Is my heart to be broken ? and , what is more cruel still , is Philip to be disappointed ? I expected something more sensible , my dear , from you . What possible reason can there be for waiting ? "
51408	51415	51418	51418	she	53	" I suppose you know best , "
51723	51729	51730	51730	I	0	" Let me see him , "
51733	51742	51730	51730	I	0	" I can easily say you are engaged . "
51760	51770	51771	51771	he	615	" Mr. Dunboyne 's visit pays me a compliment , "
51774	51781	51771	51771	he	615	" and I must receive him . "
51799	51814	51815	51815	Philip	47	" This is not a private interview , Helena ; stay where you are . "
51961	51983	51984	51984	he	47	" I am glad , Mr. Gracedieu , to see that you are well enough to be in your study again , "
51997	52006	52007	52007	he	47	" Am I one of the idle people , "
52015	52023	52007	52007	he	47	" who are always interrupting useful employment ? "

52162	52211	52159	52159	father	3936	" and I can not honestly say that I enjoy traveling . I dislike manners and customs that are strange to me ; I do n't find that hotels reward me for giving up the comforts of my own house . How do you find the hotel here ? "
52212	52262	52265	52265	he	1500	" I submit to the hotel , sir . They are sad savages in the kitchen ; they put mushroom ketchup into their soup , and mustard and cayenne pepper into their salads . I am half - starved at dinner - time , but I do n't complain . "
52283	52299	52300	52300	I	0	" I have heard you acknowledge that the landlord and landlady are very obliging people , "
52303	52323	52300	52300	I	0	" Why do n't you ask them to let you make your own soup and mix your own salad ? "
52374	52383	52384	52384	he	47	" Will you excuse me , Miss Helena , "
52387	52400	52384	52384	he	47	" if I ask leave to speak to Mr. Gracedieu in private ? "
52448	52453	52454	52454	he	47	" May I ask , "
52459	52468	52454	52454	he	47	" what is the object of the interview ? "
52469	52472	52473	52473	Philip	47	" Certainly , "
52476	52482	52473	52473	Philip	47	" when we are alone . "
52576	52579	52580	52580	I	0	" Listening ! "
52587	52590	52591	52591	she	53	" Yes , "
52595	52601	52591	52591	she	53	" You listen , too ! "
52672	52678	52679	52679	she	53	" He 's getting nervous , "
52682	52696	52679	52679	she	53	" he 'll forget to say the right thing at the right time . "
52697	52701	52702	52702	Philip	47	" Mr. Gracedieu , "
52705	52713	52714	52714	Father	65	" I wish to speak to you - "
52718	52738	52716	52716	him	47	" We are alone now , Mr. Dunboyne . I want to know why you consult me in private ? "
52739	52753	52679	52679	she	53	" I am anxious to consult you , sir , on a subject - "
52754	52763	52679	52679	she	53	" On what subject ? Any religious difficulty ? "
52764	52767	52716	52716	him	47	" No . "
52768	52779	52679	52679	she	53	" Anything I can do for you in the town ? "
52780	52792	52679	52679	she	53	" Not at all . If you will only allow me - "
52793	52808	52809	52809	Philip	47	" I am still waiting , sir , to know what it is about . "
52818	52826	52827	52827	he	47	" Once for all , Mr. Gracedieu , "
52830	52843	52827	52827	he	47	" will you let me speak ? It 's about your daughter - "
52844	52853	52854	52855	My father	615	" No more of it , Mr. Dunboyne ! "
52863	52882	52854	52855	My father	615	" I do n't desire to hold a private conversation with you on the subject of my daughter . "
52883	52904	52854	52855	My father	615	" If you have any personal objection to me , sir , be so good as to state it plainly . "
52905	52917	52854	52855	My father	615	" You have no right to ask me to do that . "
52918	52925	52854	52855	My father	615	" You refuse to do it ? "
52926	52929	52854	52855	My father	615	" Positively . "
52930	52940	52854	52855	My father	615	" You are not very civil , Mr. Gracedieu . "
52941	52959	52960	52960	Philip	47	" If I speak without ceremony , Mr. Dunboyne , you have yourself to thank for it . "
52971	53000	52960	52960	Philip	47	" You are a minister of religion , and you are an old man . Two privileges - and you presume on them both . Good - morning . "
53046	53066	53038	53038	she	53	" Oh , Philip ! Philip ! what have you done ? Why did n't you keep your temper ? "
53067	53078	53079	53079	he	47	" Did you hear what your father said to me ? "
53082	53104	53105	53105	Her	53	" Yes , dear ; but you ought to have controlled yourself - you ought , indeed , for my sake . "
53121	53130	53131	53131	he	47	" If you wish me to recover myself , "
53136	53144	53131	53131	he	47	" you had better let me go . "
53145	53169	53118	53118	her	53	" Oh , how cruel , Philip , to leave me when I am so wretched ! Why do you want to go ? "
53170	53182	53183	53183	he	47	" You told me just now what I ought to do , "
53190	53208	53131	53131	he	47	" If I am to get the better of my temper , I must be left alone . "
53209	53220	53118	53118	her	53	" I never said anything about your temper , darling . "
53221	53231	53131	53131	he	47	" Did n't you tell me to control myself ? "
53232	53249	53131	53131	he	47	" Oh , yes ! Go back to Papa , and beg him to forgive you . "
53250	53258	53118	53118	her	53	" I 'll see him damned first ! "
53310	53314	53315	53315	I	0	" You fool , "
53318	53327	53315	53315	I	0	" have n't you made mischief enough already ? "
53328	53335	53336	53336	she	53	" What am I to do ? "
53342	53354	53336	53336	she	53	" Do what I told you to do yesterday - wait . "
53473	53485	53486	53486	I	0	" You are not to attempt to justify yourself in writing , "
53491	53512	53486	53486	I	0	" Let your reply merely inform me if you can keep the appointment . The rest , when we meet . "
53767	53786	53761	53761	She	96	" My sweet child , I must n't think of it - I am too fond of you . "
53933	53942	53914	53922	this little woman , so bright , and quick	1535	" I leave it to you , dear , "
53964	53982	53914	53922	this little woman , so bright , and quick	1535	" Maria , did you open the door for Mr. Dunboyne when he went away just now ? "
53983	53988	53914	53922	this little woman , so bright , and quick	1535	" No , miss . "
54070	54082	54038	54038	she	96	" Perhaps they have been talking in the kitchen about Philip ? "
54111	54127	54091	54091	I	0	" Did you happen to hear which way Mr. Dunboyne went when he left us ? "
54128	54142	54091	54091	I	0	" I know where he was , miss , half an hour ago . "
54143	54148	54091	54091	I	0	" Where was he ? "
54149	54154	54155	54155	Selina	96	" At the hotel . "
54168	54181	54155	54155	Selina	96	" How does she know - ah , how does she know ? "
54202	54215	54192	54192	My	0	" How do you know that Mr. Dunboyne was at the hotel ? "
54216	54233	54159	54159	her	96	" I was sent there with a letter for him , and waited for the answer . "
54248	54253	54254	54254	Maria	64	" Who sent you ? "
54263	54273	54254	54254	Maria	64	" You wo n't tell upon me , miss ? "
54286	54289	54290	54290	I	0	" Well , "
54293	54298	54290	54290	I	0	" who sent you ? "
54299	54303	54304	54304	Selina	96	" Miss Helena . "
54430	54446	54427	54427	I	0	" Suppose I go to Helena , and ask her why she wrote to Philip ? "
54451	54458	54448	54448	Selina	96	" Suppose you do , dear . "
54466	54475	54459	54459	I	0	" Do you know where my sister is ? "
54476	54483	54459	54459	I	0	" Just gone out , miss . "
54661	54715	54650	54650	she	96	" You good little soul , you are always right . Look at me again , Euneece . Are you beginning to doubt me ? Oh , my darling , do n't do that ! It is n't using me fairly . I ca n't bear it - I ca n't bear it ! "
54793	54874	54773	54773	she	96	" Go away to papa ! Do n't mind me - I 'm a creature of impulse - ha ! ha ! ha ! a little hysterical - the state of the weather - I get rid of these weaknesses , my dear , by singing to myself . I have a favorite song : ' My heart is light , my will is free . ' - Go away ! oh , for God 's sake , go away ! "
55143	55148	55140	55140	He	58	" Who is it ? "
55161	55167	55158	55158	He	58	" What do you want ? "
55184	55192	55181	55181	I	0	" Papa , have you forgotten Eunice ? "
55223	55402	55210	55210	He	58	" My dear child , what delusion has got into that pretty little head of yours ? Fancy her thinking that I had forgotten my own daughter ! I was lost in thought , Eunice . For the moment , I was what they call an absent man . Did I ever tell you the story of the absent man ? He went to call upon some acquaintance of his ; and when the servant said , ' What name , sir ? ' He could n't answer . He was obliged to confess that he had forgotten his own name . The servant said , ' That 's very strange . ' The absent man at once recovered himself . ' That 's it ! ' he said : ' my name is Strange . ' Droll , is n't it ? If I had been calling on a friend to - day , I daresay I might have forgotten my name , too . Much to think of , Eunice - too much to think of . "
55434	55440	55441	55441	he	1549	" Well , my dear , "
55444	55452	55441	55441	he	1549	" what can I do for you ? "
55453	55471	55472	55472	He	1549	" I came here , papa to see if there was anything I could do for You . "
55503	55513	55514	55514	he	1549	" I ought to get on with my work , "
55517	55522	55514	55514	he	1549	" Where is Helena ? "
55597	55603	55604	55604	he	1549	" Read the last page , "
55615	55625	55604	55604	he	1549	" I do n't remember where I left off . "
55755	55874	55744	55744	He	1549	" Why should there be any fear of discovery , when every possible care had been taken to prevent it ? The danger from unexpected events was far more disquieting . A man might find himself bound in honor to disclose what it had been the chief anxiety of his life to conceal . For example , could he let an innocent person be the victim of deliberate suppression of the truth - no matter how justifiable that suppression might appear to be ? On the other hand , dreadful consequences might follow an honorable confession . There might be a cruel sacrifice of tender affection ; there might be a shocking betrayal of innocent hope and trust . "
55917	55922	55923	55923	he	1549	" I 'm tired , "
55926	55934	55923	55923	he	1549	" Wait for me while I rest . "
56014	56069	56070	56070	He	1549	" Oh , my dear , what bad writing ! I declare I ca n't read what I myself told you to write . No ! no ! do n't be downhearted about it . You are not used to writing from dictation ; and I daresay I have been too quick for you . "
56077	56089	56090	56090	he	1549	" You know how fond I am of my little girl , "
56093	56126	56090	56090	he	1549	" I am afraid I like my Eunice just the least in the world more than I like my Helena . Ah , you are beginning to look a little happier now ! "
56185	56210	56180	56180	I	0	" If you knew how to make me happier than I have ever been in all my life before , would you do it ? "
56211	56217	56180	56180	I	0	" Of course I would . "
56218	56237	56238	56238	His	1549	" Then send for Philip , dear , and be a little kinder to him , this time . "
56253	56258	56259	56259	he	1549	" That man again ! "
56263	56286	56259	56259	he	1549	" Am I never to hear the last of him ? Go away , Eunice . You are of no use here . "
56303	56310	56311	56311	He	1549	" What is this fit for ? "
56366	56381	56347	56351	some hard - hearted person	1557	" Eunice , you are not fit to live any longer ; take this , "
56471	56554	57129	57129	You	0	" EVER - DEAREST EUNEECE - I have tried to make myself useful to you , and have failed . But how can I see the sad sight of your wretchedness , and not feel the impulse to try again ? I have gone to the hotel to find Philip , and to bring him back to you a penitent and faithful man . Wait for me , and hope for great things . A. hundred thousand kisses to my sweet Euneece . "
56557	56671	57129	57129	You	0	" Wait for her , after reading that note ! How could she expect it ? I had only to follow her , and to find Philip . In another minute , I was on my way to the hotel . CHAPTER XXVIII . HELENA 'S DIARY . Looking at the last entry in my Journal , I see myself anticipating that the event of to - day will decide Philip 's future and mine . This has proved prophetic . All further concealment is now at an end . Forced to it by fate , or helped to it by chance , Eunice has made the discovery of her lover 's infidelity . "
56676	57013	57129	57129	You	0	" as my father says in his sermons , we two sisters are enemies for life . I am not suspected , as Eunice is , of making appointments with a sweetheart . So I am free to go out alone , and to go where I please . Philip and I were punctual to our appointment this afternoon . Our place of meeting was in a secluded corner of the town park . We found a rustic seat in our retirement , set up one would suppose as a concession to the taste of visitors who are fond of solitude . The view in front of us was bounded by the park wall and railings , and our seat was prettily approached on one side by a plantation of young trees . No entrance gate was near ; no carriage road crossed the grass . A more safe and more solitary nook for conversation , between two persons desiring to be alone , it would be hard to find in most public parks . Lovers are said to know it well , and to be especially fond of it toward evening . We were there in broad daylight , and we had the seat to ourselves . My memory of what passed between us is , in some degree , disturbed by the formidable interruption which brought our talk to an end . But among other things , I remember that I showed him no mercy at the outset . At one time I was indignant ; at another I was scornful . I declared , in regard to my object in meeting him , that I had changed my mind , And had decided to shorten a disagreeable interview by waiving my right to an explanation , and bidding him farewell . Eunice , as I pointed out , had the first claim to him ; Eunice was much more likely to suit him , as a companion for life , than I was . "
57017	57024	57129	57129	You	0	" I said , in conclusion , "
57047	57082	57129	57129	You	0	" With this satirical explanation , I rose to say good - by . I had merely intended to irritate him . He showed a superiority to anger for which I was not prepared . "
57092	57128	57129	57129	You	0	" he said quietly . He took my letter from his pocket , and pointed to that part of it which alluded to his conduct , when we had met in my father 's study . "
57144	57149	57129	57129	You	0	" he went on . "
57239	57240	57234	57234	You	0	" "
57250	57254	57256	57256	you	0	" I said , "
57263	57268	57256	57256	you	0	" That touched him . "
57276	57281	57269	57269	I	0	" he burst out . "
57427	57428	57415	57415	you	0	" "
57436	57440	57415	57415	you	0	" I asked . "
57449	57453	57415	57415	you	0	" he said - "
57459	57460	57415	57415	you	0	" "
57468	57536	57415	57415	you	0	" It has been discovered by wiser heads than mine that weak people are always in extremes . So far , I had seen Philip in the vain and violent extreme . He now shifted suddenly to the sad and submissive extreme . When I asked him if he deserved to be forgiven , he made the humblest of all replies - he sighed and said nothing . "
57546	57551	57540	57540	my	0	" I reminded him , "
57566	57567	57568	57568	Your	0	" "
57578	57582	57568	57568	Your	0	" he answered , "
57627	57708	57623	57623	you	0	" After holding out against him resolutely , I felt myself beginning to yield . When a man has once taken their fancy , what helplessly weak creatures women are ! I saw through his vacillating weakness - and yet I trusted him , with both eyes open . My looking - glass is opposite to me while I write . It shows me a contemptible Helena . I lied , and said I was satisfied - to please him . "
57713	57749	57750	57750	My	0	" he asked . It is absurd to put it on record . Of course , I forgave him . What a good Christian I am , after all ! He took my willing hand . "
57754	57758	57750	57750	My	0	" he said , "
57788	58089	57784	57784	yours	1568	" I must have been infatuated by his voice and his look ; my heart must have been burning under the pressure of his hand on mine . Was it my modesty or my self - control that deserted me ? I let him take me in his arms . Again , and again , and again I kissed him . We were deaf to what we ought to have heard ; we were blind to what we ought to have seen . Before we were conscious of a movement among the trees , we were discovered . My sister flew at me like a wild animal . Her furious hands fastened themselves on my throat . Philip started to his feet . When he touched her , in the act of forcing her back from me , Eunice 's raging strength became utter weakness in an instant . Her arms fell helpless at her sides - her head drooped - she looked at him in silence which was dreadful , at such a moment as that . He shrank from the unendurable reproach in those tearless eyes . Meanly , he turned away from her . Meanly , I followed him . Looking back for an instant , I saw her step forward ; perhaps to stop him , perhaps to speak to him . The effort was too much for her strength ; she staggered back against the trunk of a tree . Like strangers , walking separate one from the other , we left her to her companion - the hideous traitress who was my enemy and her friend . CHAPTER XXIX . HELENA 'S DIARY . On reaching the street which led to Philip 's hotel , we spoke to each other for the first time . "
58096	58100	57784	57784	yours	1568	" I said . "
58105	58109	57784	57784	yours	1568	" he answered . "
58112	58116	57784	57784	yours	1568	" I asked . "
58119	58264	57784	57784	yours	1568	" To leave us for a while , after what had happened , might be the wisest thing which a man , in Philip 's critical position , could do . But if I went with him - unprovided as I was with any friend of my own sex , whose character and presence might sanction the step I had taken - I should be lost beyond redemption . Is any man that ever lived worth that sacrifice ? I thought of my father 's house closed to me , and of our friends ashamed of me . I have owned , in some earlier part of my Journal , that I am not very patient under domestic cares . But the possibility of Eunice being appointed housekeeper , with my power , in my place , was more than I could calmly contemplate . "
58267	58273	57784	57784	yours	1568	" I said to Philip . "
58303	58354	58356	58356	you	0	" He yielded , without an attempt to make me alter my mind . There was a sullen submission in his manner which it was not pleasant to see . Was he despairing already of himself and of me ? Had Eunice aroused the watchful demons of shame and remorse ? "
58360	58366	58356	58356	you	0	" he said , gloomily . "
58371	58385	58356	58356	you	0	" My anxiety put the all - important question to him without hesitation . "
58395	58402	58393	58393	Philip	47	" His reply instantly relieved me : "
58406	58412	58393	58393	Philip	47	" But I wanted more : "
58418	58422	58413	58413	You	47	" I persisted . "
58428	58429	58413	58413	You	47	" "
58436	58441	58432	58432	you	0	" He turned pale . "
58450	58451	58446	58446	I	0	" "
58456	58457	58446	58446	I	0	" "
58464	58483	58446	58446	I	0	" The only possible way out of our difficulty that I could see , now occurred to me . "
58496	58500	58485	58486	my sister	596	" I suggested . "
58511	58512	58502	58502	you	47	" "
58515	58516	58502	58502	you	47	" "
58529	58530	58518	58518	you	47	" "

58551	58573	58518	58518	you	47	" I said - ' suppose time passes and tries your patience - will you still consider yourself engaged to me ? "
58574	58579	58580	58580	he	47	" Engaged to you , "
58583	58594	58580	58580	he	47	" in spite of obstacles and in spite of time . "
58595	58604	58605	58605	I	0	" And while you are away from me , "
58610	58618	58605	58605	I	0	" we shall write to each other ? "
58619	58625	58626	58626	he	47	" Go where I may , "
58629	58637	58626	58626	he	47	" you shall always hear from me . "
58825	58832	58822	58822	her	66	" No , you would degrade yourself "
58993	59001	59002	59002	I	0	" You oblige me to remind you , "
59005	59015	59002	59002	I	0	" that you are not in your own room . "
59032	59037	59038	59038	I	0	" With every disposition , "
59041	59076	59038	59038	I	0	" to make allowance for the disagreeable peculiarities of your character , I can not consent to overlook an act of intrusion , committed by a Spy . Now , do you understand me ? "
59082	59090	59091	59091	she	1591	" I see no third person here , "
59094	59103	59091	59091	she	1591	" May I ask if you mean me ? "
59104	59109	59038	59038	I	0	" I mean you . "
59110	59125	59091	59091	she	1591	" Will you be so good , Miss Helena , as to explain yourself ? "
59138	59146	59147	59147	I	0	" You followed me to the park , "
59150	59191	59147	59147	I	0	" It was you who found me with Mr. Dunboyne , and betrayed me to my sister . You are a Spy , and you know it . At this very moment you dare n't look me in the face . "
59217	59221	59222	59222	she	3444	" Quite true , "
59225	59531	59222	59222	she	3444	" If I ventured to look you in the face , I am afraid I might forget myself . I have always been brought up like a lady , and I wish to show it even in the company of such a wretch as you are . There is not one word of truth in what you have said of me . I went to the hotel to find Mr. Dunboyne . Ah , you may sneer ! I have n't got your good looks - and a vile use you have made of them . My object was to recall that base young man to his duty to my dear charming injured Euneece . The hotel servant told me that Mr. Dunboyne had gone out . Oh , I had the means of persuasion in my pocket ! The man directed me to the park , as he had already directed Mr. Dunboyne . It was only when I had found the place , that I heard some one behind me . Poor innocent Euneece had followed me to the hotel , and had got her directions , as I had got mine . God knows how hard I tried to persuade her to go back , and how horribly frightened I was - No ! I wo n't distress myself by saying a word more . It would be too humiliating to let you see an honest woman in tears . Your sister has a spirit of her own , thank God ! She wo n't inhabit the same room with you ; she never desires to see your false face again . I take the poor soul 's dresses and things away - and as a religious person I wait , confidently wait , for the judgment that will fall on you ! "
60321	60418	60423	60423	she	1630	" I know I was wrong , my dear , to let my love and pity close my lips . But remember how happy you were at the time . The thought of making you miserable was more than I could endure - I am so fond of you ! Yes ; I began to suspect them , on the day when they first met at the station . And , I am afraid , I thought it just likely that you might be as cunning as I was , and have noticed them , too . "
60507	60530	60531	60531	I	0	" I wish I was a better man , Eunice ; I wish I was good enough to be worthy of you . "
60574	60840	60565	60565	she	96	" My love , you must have innocently said something to him , when you and he were alone , which touched his conscience when he had a conscience , and made him ashamed of himself . Ah , you were too fond of him to see how he changed for the worse , when your vile sister joined you , and took possession of him again . It made my heart ache to see you so unsuspicious of them . You asked me , my poor dear , if they had quarreled - you believed they were tired of walking by the river , when it was you they were tired of - and you wondered why Helena took him to see the school . My child ! she was the leading spirit at the school , and you were nobody . Her vanity saw the chance of making him compare you at a disadvantage with your clever sister . I declare , Euneece , I lose my head if I only think of it ! All the strong points in my character seem to slip away from me . Would you believe it ? - I have neglected that sweet infant at the cottage ; I have even let Mrs. Molly have her baby back again . If I had the making of the laws , Philip Dunboyne and Helena Gracedieu should be hanged together on the same gallows . I see I shock you . Do n't let us talk of it ! Oh , do n't let us talk of it ! "
60952	60968	60969	60969	she	52	" We are likely to meet often , while we are in the same house , "
60972	60992	60969	60969	she	52	" had n't we better consult appearances , and pretend to be as fond of each other as ever ? "
61014	61039	61010	61010	She	52	" After all , it is n't my fault if Philip likes me better than he likes you . Do n't you see that ? "
61052	61078	61079	61079	I	0	" How black you look , Eunice ! Are you sorry you did n't kill me , when you had your hands on my throat ? "
61082	61085	61079	61079	I	0	" Yes . "
61547	61554	61555	61555	he	162	" My patient is asleep now , "
61559	61604	61555	61555	he	162	" but remember what I said to you the last time we met ; a longer rest than any doctor 's prescription can give him is what he wants . You are not looking well yourself , my dear . What is the matter ? "
61643	61665	61666	61666	he	162	" What is physic for your father , you foolish child , is not physic for a young creature like you , "
61669	61694	61666	61666	he	162	" Count a thousand , if you ca n't sleep to - night , or turn your pillow . I wish you pleasant dreams . "
61938	61943	61944	61944	Selina	96	" And mind this , "
61947	61975	61944	61944	Selina	96	" the person who has done the mischief is the person whom I saw leaving the study . What your unnatural sister said to provoke her father - "
61976	61986	61987	61987	Helena	52	" That your unnatural sister will tell you herself , "
62082	62091	62092	62092	I	0	" Have we anything to be ashamed of ? "
62097	62103	62092	62092	I	0	" Stay where you are . "
62104	62119	62120	62121	my sister	596	" You may be of some use , Miss Jillgall , if you stay , "
62124	62140	62150	62150	her	596	" Eunice seems to be trembling . Is she angry , or is she ill ? "
62175	62185	62186	62186	I	0	" Go on with what you have to say , "
62189	62196	62186	62186	I	0	" and do n't notice me . "
62197	62350	62150	62150	her	596	" You are not very polite , my dear , but I can make allowances . Oh , come ! come ! putting up your hands to stop your ears is too childish . You would do better to express regret for having misled your father . Yes ! you did mislead him . Only a few days since , you left him to suppose that you were engaged to Philip . It became my duty , after that , to open his eyes to the truth ; and if I unhappily provoked him , it was your fault . I was strictly careful in the language I used . I said : ' Dear father , you have been misinformed on a very serious subject . The only marriage engagement for which your kind sanction is requested , is my engagement . I have consented to become Mrs. Philip Dunboyne . ' "
62351	62354	62355	62355	I	0	" Stop ! "
62358	62365	62355	62355	I	0	" Why am I to stop ? "
62366	62395	62150	62150	her	596	" Because I have something to say . You and I are looking at each other . Does my face tell you what is passing in my mind ? "
62396	62406	62407	62407	she	1672	" Your face seems to be paler than usual , "
62410	62415	62407	62407	she	1672	" that 's all . "
62416	62419	62420	62420	I	0	" No , "
62423	62468	62420	62420	I	0	" that is not all . The devil that possessed me , when I discovered you with Philip , is not cast out of me yet . Silence the sneering devil that is in You , or we may both live to regret it . "
62595	62603	62604	62604	she	96	" I wish I could comfort you ! "
62613	62621	62622	62622	I	0	" Keep my hand in your hand , "
62626	62644	62604	62604	she	96	" I am drowning in dark water - and I have nothing to hold by but you . "
62645	62658	62604	62604	she	96	" Oh , my darling , do n't talk in that way ! "
62659	62688	62689	62689	My	0	" Good Selina ! dear Selina ! You shall talk to me . Say something harmless - tell me a melancholy story - try to make me cry . "
62697	62706	62707	62707	she	96	" I 'm more likely to cry myself , "
62710	62810	62707	62707	she	96	" This is so heart - breaking - I almost wish I was back in the time , before you came home , the time when your detestable sister first showed how she hated me . I was happy , meanly happy , in the spiteful enjoyment of provoking her . Oh , Euneece , I shall never recover my spirits again ! All the pity in the world would not be pity enough for you . So hardly treated ! so young ! so forlorn ! Your good father too ill to help you ; your poor mother - "
62838	62849	62828	62828	I	0	" My dear child , I never even saw her ! "
62850	62861	62815	62815	she	1674	" Has my father never spoken to you about her ? "
62862	62925	62828	62828	I	0	" Only once , when I asked him how long she had been dead . He told me you lost her while you were an infant , and he told me no more . I was looking at her portrait in the study , only yesterday . I think it must be a bad portrait ; your mother 's face disappoints me . "
62943	62948	62949	62949	Selina	96	" At any rate , "
62952	62985	62949	62949	Selina	96	" you are not like her . Nobody would ever guess that you were the child of that lady , with the long slanting forehead and the restless look in her eyes . "
63144	63167	63168	63168	She	96	" Rest your poor eyes , my child , and your weary head - and try at least to get some sleep . "
63331	63340	63341	63341	I	0	" I must have some of your medicine , "
63346	63359	63341	63341	I	0	" I want it , dear , as badly as you do . "
63886	63900	63880	63881	our friends	669	" Eunice is a good girl ; we are all fond of Eunice . "
64365	64371	64372	64372	I	0	" Oh , no more ! "
64376	64386	64372	64372	I	0	" You are killing me with an icy death ! "

64675	64680	64622	64623	The whisper	1713	" It is true . "
64681	64694	64622	64623	The whisper	1713	" The man you loved has deserted you . Is it true ? "
64695	64700	64622	64623	The whisper	1713	" It is true . "
64701	64728	64622	64623	The whisper	1713	" A woman has lured him away to herself . A woman has had no mercy on you , or on him . Is it true ? "

64735	64749	64622	64623	The whisper	1713	" If she lives , what crime toward you will she commit next ? "

67009	67021	67022	67022	she	3958	" I believe I am speaking to my father 's friend , "
67025	67032	67022	67022	she	3958	" my name is Helena Gracedieu . "

67236	67375	67233	67233	she	52	" I am afraid you must prepare yourself to see a sad change . Nerves . The mischief first showed itself , the doctor tells us , in derangement of his nervous system . He has been , I regret to tell you , obstinate in refusing to give up his preaching and pastoral work . He ought to have tried rest at the seaside . Things have gone on from bad to worse . Last Sunday , at the beginning of his sermon , he broke down . Very , very sad , is it not ? The doctor says that precious time has been lost , and he must make up his mind to resign his charge . He wo n't hear of it . You are his old friend . Please try to persuade him . "
67584	67592	67573	67573	I	0	" Miss Helena herself introduced the subject . "
67597	67601	67594	67594	I	0	" she resumed , "
67619	67667	67607	67607	you	0	" Here was an opportunity of paying her a compliment , if I had been a younger man , or if she had produced a favorable impression on me . As it was , I hit - if I may praise myself - on an ingenious compromise . "
67674	67678	67671	67671	I	0	" I asked , "
67683	67684	67607	67607	you	0	" "
67741	67791	67792	67792	My	0	" The tone in which she said this strengthened my prejudice against her . It told me that the two girls were living together on no very friendly terms ; and it suggested - justly or unjustly I could not then decide - that Miss Helena was to blame . "
67799	67800	67792	67792	My	0	" "
67819	67820	67821	67821	I	0	" "
67856	67938	67939	67939	I	0	" What did this matter to me ? I decided on dropping the subject . My memory reverted , however , to past occasions on which the loss of my health had been entirely my own fault . There was something in these personal recollections , which encouraged my perverse tendency to sympathize with a young lady to whom I had not yet been introduced . The young lady 's sister appeared to be discouraged by my silence . She said : "
67956	67957	67941	67941	you	52	" "
67961	67962	67964	67964	you	52	" "
67992	67993	67981	67981	you	52	" "
67997	68010	67981	67981	you	52	" She slyly set the best construction on my perfectly commonplace reply . "
68014	68018	68012	68012	you	52	" she said . "
68145	68146	68138	68138	You	52	" "
68152	68282	68138	68138	You	52	" To set me against her sister , in her own private interests - there , as I felt sure , was the motive under which she was acting . As hard as her mother , as selfish as her mother , and , judging from those two bad qualities , probably as cruel as her mother . That was how I understood Miss Helena Gracedieu , when our carriage drew up at her father 's house . A middle - aged lady was on the doorstep , when we arrived , just ringing the bell . She looked round at us both ; being evidently as complete a stranger to my fair companion as she was to me . When the servant opened the door , she said : "
68289	68354	68284	68285	Miss Jillgall	66	" At the sound of that odd name , Miss Helena tossed her head disdainfully . She took no sort of notice of the stranger - lady who was at the door of her father 's house . This young person 's contempt for Miss Jillgall appeared to extend to Miss Jillgall 's friends . In the meantime , the servant 's answer was : "
68359	68366	68138	68138	You	52	" The middle aged lady said : "
68374	68375	68368	68368	you	1846	" "
68380	68381	68368	68368	you	1846	" "
68392	68393	68382	68382	I	0	" "
68401	68414	68398	68398	you	1846	" The lady stole another look at me , before she replied . "
68420	68436	68398	68398	you	1846	" she said - and walked away . CHAPTER XXXIII . THE MINISTER 'S MISFORTUNE . "
68443	68454	68438	68438	you	1846	" Miss Helena asked , as we entered the house . "
68463	68467	68455	68455	She	3768	" I answered . "
68477	68478	68469	68469	you	1846	" "
68488	68489	68491	68491	she	3768	" "
68496	68557	68491	68491	she	3768	" The lady had no doubt looked at me twice . If this meant that my face was familiar to her , I could only repeat what I have already said . Never , to my knowledge , had I seen her before . Leading the way upstairs , Miss Helena apologized for taking me into her father 's bedroom . "
68568	68572	68558	68558	He	1850	" she said ; "
68622	68643	68620	68620	We	1854	" - she favored me with a fascinating smile , devoted to winning my heart when her interests required it - "
68663	68783	68654	68654	we	1854	" I thanked her , and said I would shake hands with my old friend before I went to my room . We parted at the bedroom door . It is out of my power to describe the shock that overpowered me when I first saw the Minister again , after the long interval of time that had separated us . Nothing that his daughter said , nothing that I myself anticipated , had prepared me for that lamentable change . For the moment , I was not sufficiently master of myself to be able to speak to him . He added to my embarrassment by the humility of his manner , and the formal elaboration of his apologies . "
68796	68800	68788	68788	I	0	" he said , "
68849	68872	68873	68873	I	0	" Beginning to recover myself , I begged that he would make no more excuses . My interruption seemed to confuse him . "
68878	68883	68873	68873	I	0	" he went on , "
69047	69066	69045	69045	She	1865	" He paused , as if in search of a lost idea , and left the sentence uncompleted . "
69069	69074	69045	69045	She	1865	" he went on , "
69426	69447	69422	69422	you	1855	" he burst out fiercely , incapable of perceiving that he had allowed me no opportunity of speaking to him . "
69460	69502	69453	69453	you	3443	" The signs of mental confusion in his talk had so distressed me , that I had not been composed enough to feel sure of what he really meant , until he described himself as ' shrinking from a necessary explanation . "
69523	69527	69528	69528	I	0	" Compose yourself , "
69531	69538	69528	69528	I	0	" I understand you at last . "
69545	69549	69550	69550	he	3443	" Prove it , "
69560	69572	69550	69550	he	3443	" I want to be satisfied that you understand my position . "
69573	69579	69580	69580	I	0	" This is your position , "
69584	69641	69580	69580	I	0	" You are placed between two deplorable alternatives . If you tell this young gentleman that Miss Eunice 's mother was a criminal hanged for murder , his family - even if he himself does n't recoil from it - will unquestionably forbid the marriage ; and your adopted daughter 's happiness will be the sacrifice . "
69642	69645	69646	69646	he	3443	" True ! "
69649	69656	69646	69646	he	3443	" Frightfully true ! Go on . "
69657	69720	69721	69721	He	3443	" If , on the other hand , you sanction the marriage , and conceal the truth , you commit a deliberate act of deceit ; and you leave the lives of the young couple at the mercy of a possible discovery , which might part husband and wife - cast a slur on their children - and break up the household . "
69729	69737	69738	69738	he	3443	" Come to the end of it , "
69759	69765	69766	69766	he	3443	" No more to say ? "
69769	69783	69766	69766	he	3443	" You have not told me yet what I most want to know . "
69802	69811	69812	69812	he	3443	" Ca n't you see it for yourself ? "
69816	69831	69812	69812	he	3443	" Suppose you were put between those two alternatives which you mentioned just now . "
69832	69835	69766	69766	he	3443	" Well ? "
69836	69872	69812	69812	he	3443	" What would you do , sir , in my place ? Would you own the disgraceful truth - before the marriage - or run the risk , and keep the horrid story to yourself ? "
69919	69961	69911	69911	He	3443	" You used to be a kind - hearted man . Has age hardened you ? Have you no pity left for your old friend ? My poor heart is sadly in want of a word of wisdom , spoken kindly . "
69973	69998	69968	69968	I	0	" Be at ease , dear Minister . In your place I should run the risk , and keep that horrid story to myself . "
70007	70015	70016	70016	he	3443	" Oh , the relief of it ! "
70019	70033	70016	70016	he	3443	" How can I thank you as I ought for quieting my mind ? "
70052	70064	70065	70065	I	0	" Let us have done with serious talk for the present , "
70068	70091	70065	70065	I	0	" I have been an idle man for the last five years , and I want to tell you about my travels . "
70107	70112	70113	70113	he	3443	" Are you sure , "
70117	70130	70131	70131	he	3443	" that we have said all we ought to say ? No ! "
70139	70173	70174	70174	I	0	" I believe I have forgotten something - I am certain I have forgotten something . Perhaps I mentioned it in the letter I wrote to you . Have you got my letter ? "
70196	70200	70201	70201	he	3443	" Not there ! "
70205	70209	70201	70201	he	3443	" Not there ! "
70210	70222	70223	70223	I	0	" Is the lost remembrance connected with anybody in the house ? "
70231	70247	70223	70223	I	0	" Does it relate , by any chance , to one of the young ladies ? "
70248	70286	70287	70287	He	3443	" You wonderful man ! Nothing escapes you . Yes ; the thing I have forgotten concerns one of the girls . Stop ! Let me get at it by myself . Surely it relates to Helena ? "
70301	70309	70310	70310	he	3443	" Yes ; it relates to Helena , "
70312	70316	70317	70317	His	3443	" but how ? "
70323	70331	70332	70332	he	3443	" I am ashamed of my weakness , "
70336	70352	70332	70332	he	3443	" You do n't know how dreadful it is to forget things in this way . "
70421	70429	70430	70430	I	0	" If we talk of your daughter , "
70433	70459	70430	70430	I	0	" the merest accident - a word spoken at random by . you or me - may be all your memory wants to rouse it . "
70466	70503	70504	70504	he	3443	" Yes ! Yes ! Let me begin . Helena met you , I think , at the station . Of course , I remember that ; it only happened a few hours since . Well ? "
70525	70543	70504	70504	he	3443	" did you think my daughter a fine girl ? I hope Helena did n't disappoint you ? "
70544	70549	70556	70556	I	0	" Quite the contrary . "
70570	70579	70580	70580	I	0	" It must , however , be owned , "
70584	70591	70580	70580	I	0	" that your daughter surprised me . "
70592	70597	70580	70580	I	0	" In what way ? "
70598	70635	70636	70636	He	3443	" When she mentioned her name . Who could have supposed that you - an inveterate enemy to the Roman Catholic Church - would have christened your daughter by the name of a Roman Catholic Saint ? "
70660	70669	70670	70670	he	3443	" You happen to be wrong this time , "
70674	70782	70783	70783	he	1881	" I never gave my girl the name of Helena ; and , what is more , I never baptized her . You ought to know that . Years and years ago , I wrote to tell you that my poor wife had made me a proud and happy father . And surely I said that the child was born while she was on a visit to her brother 's rectory . Do you remember the name of the place ? I told you it was a remote little village , called - Suppose we put your memory to a test ? Can you remember the name ? "
70837	70845	70846	70846	he	1881	" Your memory is failing you now , "
70849	71215	70846	70846	he	1881	" The name is Long Lanes . And what do you think my wife did - this is so characteristic of her ! - when I presented myself at her bedside . Instead of speaking of our own baby , she reminded me of the name that I had given to our adopted daughter when I baptized the child . ' You chose the ugliest name that a girl can have , ' she said . I begged her to remember that ' Eunice ' was a name in Scripture . She persisted in spite of me . What firmness of character ! ' I detest the name of Eunice ! ' she said ; ' and now that I have a girl of my own , it 's my turn to choose the name ; I claim it as my right . ' She was beginning to get excited ; I allowed her to have her own way , of course . ' Only let me know , ' I said , ' what the name is to be when you have thought of it . ' My dear sir , she had the name ready , without thinking about it : ' My baby shall be called by the name that is sweetest in my ears , the name of my dear lost mother . ' We had - what shall I call it ? - a slight difference of opinion when I heard that the name was to be Helena . I really could not reconcile it to my conscience to baptize a child of mine by the name of a Popish saint . My wife 's brother set things right between us . A worthy good man ; he died not very long ago - I forget the date . Not to detain you any longer , the rector of Long Lanes baptized our daughter . That is how she comes by her un - English name ; and so it happens that her birth is registered in a village which her father has never inhabited . I hope , sir , you think a little better of my memory now ? "
71352	71361	71362	71362	he	1883	" Let us go on with our conversation , "
71365	71377	71362	71362	he	1883	" We have n't recovered what I had forgotten , yet . "
71387	71396	71397	71397	he	1883	" There was something I wanted to recall - "
71400	71407	71397	71397	he	1883	" and you were helping me . "
71519	71538	71507	71508	a woman	222	" My dear , I have not a moment to spare ; my patients are waiting for me . "
71552	71565	71566	71566	Her	222	" Mind ! not a word about me to that old gentleman ! "
71635	71639	71626	71630	the middle - aged stranger	1899	" Miss Jillgall , "
71788	71888	71765	71765	She	1900	" Pray walk in , sir , and permit me to introduce myself . I am Mr. Gracedieu 's cousin - Miss Jillgall . Proud indeed to make the acquaintance of a gentleman distinguished in the service of his country - or perhaps I ought to say , in the service of the Law . The Governor offers hospitality to prisoners . And who introduces prisoners to board and lodging with the Governor ? - the Law . Beautiful weather for the time of year , is it not ? May I ask - have you seen your room ? "
71989	72046	72047	72047	She	1910	" Pray let me make myself useful . The dream of my life is to make myself useful to others ; and to such a man as you - I consider myself honored . Besides , I do enjoy running up and down stairs . This way , dear sir ; this way to your room . "
72060	72112	72047	72047	She	1910	" Do you know , I am a timid person , though I may not look like it . Sometimes , curiosity gets the better of me - and then I grow bold . Did you notice a lady who was taking leave of me just now at the house door ? "
72132	72142	72143	72143	I	0	" Just as I arrived here from the station , "
72146	72160	72143	72143	I	0	" I found her paying a visit when you were not at home . "
72161	72172	72173	72173	My	0	" Yes - and do tell me one thing more . "
72195	72200	72201	72201	she	66	" Am I right , "
72204	72220	72201	72201	she	66	" in supposing that Miss Helena accompanied you on your way here from the station ? "
72221	72225	72143	72143	I	0	" Quite right . "
72226	72245	72201	72201	she	66	" Did she say anything particular , when she saw the lady asking for me at the door ? "
72246	72251	72252	72252	I	0	" Miss Helena thought , "
72255	72270	72252	72252	I	0	" that the lady recognized me as a person whom she had seen before . "
72271	72279	72201	72201	she	66	" And what did you think yourself ? "
72280	72288	72201	72201	she	66	" I thought Miss Helena was wrong . "
72289	72293	72252	72252	I	0	" Very extraordinary ! "
72363	72371	72372	72372	she	66	" I believe many years have passed , "
72483	72531	72477	72477	I	0	" There was true sorrow and sympathy in her face . I believe I should hardly have thought her ugly , if we had first met at that moment . Thus far , she had only amused me . I began really to like Miss Jillgall now . "
72539	72543	72477	72477	I	0	" I replied , "
72604	72611	72595	72595	He	63	" Miss Jillgall suddenly turned pale . "
72617	72621	72595	72595	He	63	" she repeated . "
72628	72629	72595	72595	He	63	" "
72636	72647	72648	72648	I	0	" She seemed to find some difficulty in expressing herself . "
72760	72761	72751	72752	the Minister	161	" "
72765	72769	72770	72770	you	3443	" I answered , "
72776	72777	72782	72782	Helena	52	" "
72784	72785	72782	72782	Helena	52	" "
72792	72793	72796	72796	he	161	" "
72799	72810	72796	72796	he	161	" said Miss Jillgall to herself . I heard her . "
72817	72827	72814	72814	I	0	" I asserted , in my most positive manner . "
72844	72865	72839	72840	Miss Eunice	53	" My tone left her no alternative but to believe me . She looked not only bewildered , but alarmed . "
72883	72889	72874	72874	himself	161	" she said to herself . "
72896	72902	72890	72890	I	0	" She turned to me . "
72939	72958	72927	72927	he	161	" Not the slightest hint of any such thing , I assured her , had reached my ears . "
72961	72965	72927	72927	he	161	" she cried , "
73028	73057	73003	73003	she	77	" Miss Jillgall 's good manners slipped , as it were , from under her ; she clinched her fists as a final means of expressing her sentiments . "
73070	73084	73003	73003	she	77	" she declared with a look of fury . I took a liberty . "
73094	73098	73100	73100	you	0	" I said . "
73194	73212	73187	73187	God	38	" She checked herself there , and looked suspiciously at the door of Mr. Gracedieu 's room . "
73220	73224	73187	73187	God	38	" she whispered , "
73249	73250	73243	73244	the Minister	161	" "
73262	73270	73243	73244	the Minister	161	" Miss Jillgall shook her head ominously . "
73278	73282	73243	73244	the Minister	161	" she said . "
73287	73357	73243	73244	the Minister	161	" CHAPTER XXXV . THE FUTURE LOOKS GLOOMY . My ever - helpful guide led me to my room - well out of Mr. Gracedieu 's hearing , if he happened to be awake - at the other end of the passage . Having opened the door , she paused on the threshold . The decrees of that merciless English despot , Propriety , claimed her for their own . "
73362	73368	73243	73244	the Minister	161	" she said to herself , "
73375	73508	73370	73370	I	0	" My interest as a man and , what is more , an old man in the coming disclosure was too serious to be trifled with in this way . I took her arm , and led her into my room as if I was at a dinner - party , leading her to the table . Is it the good or the evil fortune of mortals that the comic side of life , and the serious side of life , are perpetually in collision with each other ? We burst out laughing , at a moment of grave importance to us both . Perfectly inappropriate , and perfectly natural . But we were neither of us philosophers , and we were ashamed of our own merriment the moment it had ceased . "
73519	73524	73513	73513	I	0	" Miss Jillgall began , "
73567	73715	73559	73559	he	63	" With that she told the lamentable story of the desertion of Eunice . In silence I listened , from first to last . How could I trust myself to speak , as I must have spoken , in the presence of a woman ? The cruel injury inflicted on the poor girl , who had interested and touched me in the first innocent year of her life - who had grown to womanhood to be the victim of two wretches , both trusted by her , both bound to her by the sacred debt of love - so fired my temper that I longed to be within reach of the man , with a horsewhip in my hand . Seeing in my face , as I suppose , what was passing in my mind , Miss Jillgall expressed sympathy and admiration in her own quaint way : "
73824	73836	73822	73822	himself	47	" I felt inclined to be harder on Philip than ever . "
73841	73849	73839	73839	he	47	" I asked . Miss Jillgall started . "
73907	73924	73891	73891	I	0	" I repeated my question with improvement , I hope , in my looks and tones : "
73947	73972	73935	73935	I	0	" Miss Jillgall seemed to take a curious pleasure in disappointing me ; she had not forgotten my unfortunate abruptness of look and manner . "
73980	73984	73973	73973	You	1951	" she said . "
73991	73992	73986	73986	he	1961	" "
74009	74237	74006	74007	Mr. Dunboyne	47	" The name startled me . In a moment more it recalled to my memory a remarkable letter , addressed to me many years ago , which will be found in my introductory narrative . The writer - an Irish gentleman , named Dunboyne confided to me that his marriage had associated him with the murderess , who had then been recently executed , as brother - in - law to that infamous woman . This circumstance he had naturally kept a secret from every one , including his son , then a boy . I alone was made an exception to the general rule , because I alone could tell him what had become of the poor little girl , who in spite of the disgraceful end of her mother was still his niece . If the child had not been provided for , he felt it his duty to take charge of her education , and to watch over her prospects in the future . Such had been his object in writing to me ; and such was the substance of his letter . I had merely informed him , in reply , that his kind intentions had been anticipated , and that the child 's prosperous future was assured . Miss Jillgall 's keen observation noticed the impression that had been produced upon me . "
74247	74251	74238	74239	Mr. Dunboyne	47	" she said . "
74264	74278	74260	74260	you	1966	" I answered . She looked as if she could hardly believe me . "
74287	74291	74280	74280	you	1965	" she said , "
74300	74301	74293	74293	I	0	" "
74304	74305	74293	74293	I	0	" "
74317	74318	74310	74311	Mr. Gracedieu	63	" "
74321	74331	74310	74311	Mr. Gracedieu	63	" This second reply in the negative irritated her . "
74336	74342	74343	74343	you	1965	" she said , sharply , "
74355	74356	74343	74343	you	1965	" "
74359	74360	74343	74343	you	1965	" "
74364	74368	74343	74343	you	1965	" she persisted , "
74403	74426	74395	74395	I	0	" We were completely at cross - purposes . She had taken something for granted which was an unfathomable mystery to me . "
74429	74433	74435	74435	you	0	" I objected , "
74454	74455	74435	74435	you	0	" "
74459	74464	74466	74466	you	1965	" cried Miss Jillgall , "
74481	74725	74466	74466	you	1965	" I was petrified . His son ! Dunboyne 's son ! How could I have guessed it ? At a later time only , the good little creature who had so innocently deceived me , remembered that the mischief might have been wrought by the force of habit . While he had still a claim on their regard the family had always spoken of Eunice 's unworthy lover by his Christian name ; and what had been familiar in their mouths felt the influence of custom , before time enough had elapsed to make them think as readily of the enemy as they had hitherto thought of the friend . But I was ignorant of this : and the disclosure by which I found myself suddenly confronted was more than I could support . For the moment , speech was beyond me . His son ! Dunboyne 's son ! What a position that young man had occupied , unsuspected by his father , unknown to himself ! kept in ignorance of the family disgrace , he had been a guest in the house of the man who had consoled his infamous aunt on the eve of her execution - who had saved his unhappy cousin from poverty , from sorrow , from shame . And but one human being knew this . And that human being was myself ! Observing my agitation , Miss Jillgall placed her own construction on it . "
74734	74739	74727	74727	you	1968	" she asked eagerly . "
74763	74769	74770	74770	Philip	47	" I knew no more of "
74771	74860	74770	74770	Philip	47	" whom she still called by his Christian name ! than she had told me herself : there was no help for it but to disappoint her . At the same time I was unable to conceal that I was ill at ease , and that it might be well to leave me by myself . After a look round the bedchamber to see that nothing was wanting to my comfort , she made her quaint curtsey , and left me with her own inimitable form of farewell . "
74912	75576	74904	74904	I	0	" She ran out of the room ; and carried away with her some of my kindliest feelings , short as the time of our acquaintance had been . What a wife and what a mother was lost there - and all for want of a pretty face ! Left alone , my thoughts inevitably reverted to Dunboyne the elder , and to all that had happened in Mr. Gracedieu 's family since the Irish gentleman had written to me in bygone years . The terrible choice of responsibilities which had preyed on the Minister 's mind had been foreseen by Mr. Dunboyne , when he first thought of adopting his infant niece , and had warned him to dread what might happen in the future , if he brought her up as a member of the family with his own boy , and if the two young people became at a later period attached to each other . How had the wise foresight , which offered such a contrast to the poor Minister 's impulsive act of mercy , met with its reward ? Fate or Providence call it which we may had brought Dunboyne 's son and the daughter of the murderess together ; had inspired those two strangers with love ; and had emboldened them to plight their troth by a marriage engagement . Was the man 's betrayal of the trust placed in him by the faithful girl to be esteemed a fortunate circumstance by the two persons who knew the true story of her parentage , the Minister and myself ? Could we rejoice in an act of infidelity which had embittered and darkened the gentle harmless life of the victim ? Or could we , on the other hand , encourage the ruthless deceit , the hateful treachery , which had put the wicked Helena - with no exposure to dread if she married - into her wronged sister 's place ? Impossible ! In the one case as in the other , impossible ! Equally hopeless did the prospect appear , when I tried to determine what my own individual course of action ought to be . In my calmer moments , the idea had occurred to my mind of going to Dunboyne the younger , and , if he had any sense of shame left , exerting my influence to lead him back to his betrothed wife . How could I now do this , consistently with my duty to the young man 's father ; knowing what I knew , and not forgetting that I had myself advised Mr. Gracedieu to keep the truth concealed , when I was equally ignorant of Philip Dunboyne 's parentage and of Helena Gracedieu 's treachery ? Even if events so ordered it that the marriage of Eunice might yet take place - without any interference exerted to produce that result , one way or the other , on my part - it would be just as impossible for me to speak out now , as it had been in the long - past years when I had so cautiously answered Mr. Dunboyne 's letter . But what would he think of me if accident led , sooner or later , to the disclosure which I had felt bound to conceal ? The more I tried to forecast the chances of the future , the darker and the darker was the view that faced me . To my sinking heart and wearied mind , good Dame Nature presented a more acceptable prospect , when I happened to look out of the window of my room . There I saw the trees and flowerbeds of a garden , tempting me irresistibly under the cloudless sunshine of a fine day . I was on my way out , to recover heart and hope , when a knock at the door stopped me . Had Miss Jillgall returned ? When I said "
75580	75631	75633	75633	you	1971	" Mr. Gracedieu opened the door , and entered the room . He was so weak that he staggered as he approached me . Leading him to a chair , I noticed a wild look in his eyes , and a flush on his haggard cheeks . Something had happened . "
75641	75645	75633	75633	you	1971	" he began , "
75657	75658	75660	75660	you	1971	" "
75663	75664	75660	75660	you	1971	" "
75728	75796	75724	75726	my own child	1116	" Had he been awake , while Miss Jillgall and I had been talking outside his door ? Had he heard her ask me if Mr. Gracedieu had said nothing of Helena 's infamous conduct to her sister , while he was speaking of Eunice ? The way to the lost remembrance had perhaps been found there . In any case , after that bitter allusion to his "
75799	75915	75916	75916	My	0	" some result must follow . Helena Gracedieu and a day of reckoning might be nearer to each other already than I had ventured to hope . I waited anxiously for what he might say to me next . CHAPTER XXXVI . THE WANDERING MIND . For the moment , the Minister disappointed me . Without speaking , without even looking up , he took out his pocketbook , and began to write in it . Constantly interrupted either by a trembling in the hand that held the pencil , or by a difficulty as I imagined in expressing thoughts imperfectly realized - his patience gave way ; he dashed the book on the floor . "
75921	75926	75916	75916	My	0	" he burst out . "
75944	75974	75978	75978	you	1980	" Who could hear him , and be guilty of the cruelty of preaching self - control ? I picked up the pocketbook , and offered to help him . "
75981	75985	75986	75986	I	0	" he asked . "
75992	75993	75986	75986	I	0	" "
76042	76049	76050	76050	they	1982	" my poor friend said mournfully ; "
76061	76103	76050	76050	they	1982	" The entries proved to be nearly incomprehensible . Here and there I discovered some scattered words , which showed themselves more or less distinctly in the midst of the surrounding confusion . The first word that I could make out was "
76106	76143	76050	76050	they	1982	" Helped by that hint , I trusted to guess - work to guide me in speaking to him . It was necessary to be positive , or he would have lost all faith in me . "
76146	76151	76050	76050	they	1982	" he said impatiently . "
76154	76158	76159	76159	you	1981	" I answered , "
76177	76178	76159	76159	you	1981	" "
76185	76189	76190	76190	Dear	4177	" he cried . "
76206	76207	76202	76202	she	1987	" "
76228	76229	76230	76230	I	0	" "
76407	76480	76490	76490	Minister	1996	" He had now wrought himself into a state of excitement , which relieved his spirits of the depression that had weighed on them up to this time . His harmless vanity , always , as I suspect , a latent quality in his kindly nature , had already restored his confidence . With a self - sufficient smile he consulted his own unintelligible entries , and made his own wild discoveries . "
76519	76520	76521	76521	My	0	" "
76533	76534	76521	76521	My	0	" "
76542	76549	76550	76551	Her mother	3501	" He consulted the book again . "
76581	76582	76560	76560	People	673	" "
76585	76591	76595	76596	your wife	253	" I thought to myself , "
76609	76610	76604	76607	your wife 's child	2007	" "
76618	76623	76626	76627	her mother	3501	" he went on . "
76639	76665	76626	76627	her mother	3501	" He suddenly stepped up to me and laid his hands on my shoulders ; his voice dropped to hoarse , moaning , awestruck tones . "
76680	76709	76667	76667	I	0	" It was so evidently desirable to prevent any continuation of such a train of thought as this , that I could feel no hesitation in interrupting him . "
76719	76743	76744	76744	I	0	" I asked bluntly . His humor changed again ; he made me a low bow , and went back to his chair . "
76751	76756	76744	76744	I	0	" he answered politely . "
76777	76778	76775	76775	myself	0	" "
76786	76790	76775	76775	myself	0	" I continued , "
76802	76856	76775	76775	myself	0	" Making that reply , I was tempted to add another word of truth . All education is at the mercy of two powerful counter - influences : the influence of temperament , and the influence of circumstances . But this was philosophy . How could I expect him to submit to philosophy ? "
76864	76869	76775	76775	myself	0	" I went on , "
76889	76890	76887	76887	her	52	" "
76895	76900	76901	76901	I	0	" he declared firmly . "
76910	76924	76901	76901	I	0	" In the popular phrase , I struck while the iron was hot . "
76934	76962	76925	76925	You	1997	" I told him . His vanity suddenly took the alarm - I was leading him rather too undisguisedly . He handed his book back to me . "
76967	76972	76963	76963	You	1997	" he said loftily , "
76982	76998	76974	76974	I	0	" I pretended to find it , and read an imaginary entry to this effect : "
77027	77066	76974	76974	I	0	" So far , I had succeeded in flattering him . But when thinking of his paternal authority I alluded next to his daughter 's age , his eyes rested on me with a look of downright terror . "
77072	77076	77077	77077	I	0	" he said . "
77090	77172	77077	77077	I	0	" What did he mean ? It was useless to ask . I went on with the matter in hand - still deliberately speaking to him , as I might have spoken to a man with an intellect as clear as my own . In my experience , this practice generally stimulates a weak intelligence to do its best . We all know how children receive talk that is lowered , or books that are lowered , to their presumed level . "
77180	77184	77173	77173	I	0	" I continued , "
77256	77268	77248	77248	You	0	" He seemed to be at a loss how to reply . "
77273	77277	77248	77248	You	0	" he said , "
77288	77347	77286	77286	Helena	52	" Here was Miss Jillgall 's apology for Philip Dunboyne repeated in other words . Despising and detesting the fellow as I did , I was forced to admit to myself that he must be recommended by personal attractions which it would be necessary to reckon with . I tried to get some more information from Mr. Gracedieu . "
77357	77361	77350	77350	you	0	" I resumed , "
77376	77385	77350	77350	you	0	" The Minister answered by nodding his head . "
77391	77395	77350	77350	you	0	" I persisted , "
77414	77422	77423	77423	I	0	" He admitted this by another nod . "
77548	77759	77760	77760	I	0	" I placed them before him . He took up the pen ; he arranged the paper ; he was eager to begin . After writing a few words , he stopped - reflected - tried again - stopped again - tore up the little that he had done - and began a new letter , ending in the same miserable result . It was impossible to witness his helplessness , to see how pitiably patient he was over his own incapacity , and to let the melancholy spectacle go on . I proposed to write the letter ; authenticating it , of course , by his signature . When he allowed me to take the pen , he turned away his face , ashamed to let me see what he suffered . Was this the same man , whose great nature had so nobly asserted itself in the condemned cell ? Poor mortality ! The letter was easily written . I had only to inform Mr. Dunboyne of his son 's conduct ; repeating , in the plainest language that I could use , what Miss Jillgall had related to me . Arrived at the conclusion , I contrived to make Mr. Gracedieu express himself in these strong terms : "
77798	77925	77935	77937	old Mr. Dunboyne	47	" In silence , the Minister read the letter , and attached his signature to it . In silence , he rose and took my arm . I asked if he wished to go to his room . He only replied by a sign . I offered to sit with him , and try to cheer him . Gratefully , he pressed my hand : gently , he put me back from the door . Crushed by the miserable discovery of the decay of his own faculties ! What could I do ? what could I say ? Nothing ! Miss Jillgall was in the drawing - room . With the necessary explanations , I showed her the letter . She read it with breathless interest . "
77939	77943	77946	77946	him	47	" she said . "
77955	78052	77953	77953	he	47	" I could only assure her after what I remembered of his letter to me that he was a man whom we could depend upon . Miss Jillgall possessed treasures of information to which I could lay no claim . Mr. Dunboyne , she told me , was a scholar , and a writer , and a rich man . His views on marriage were liberal in the extreme . Let his son find good principles , good temper , and good looks , in a wife , and he would promise to find the money . "
78058	78063	78053	78053	I	0	" said Miss Jillgall , "
78137	78166	78134	78135	Lady Macbeth	105	" After dashing off this striking sketch of character , the fair artist asked to look at my letter again , and observed that the address was wanting . "
78175	78179	78167	78167	I	0	" she resumed , "
78290	78459	78283	78283	I	0	" CHAPTER XXXVII . THE SHAMELESS SISTER . For some reason , which my unassisted penetration was unable to discover , Miss Helena Gracedieu kept out of my way . At dinner , on the day of my arrival , and at breakfast on the next morning , she was present of course ; ready to make herself agreeable in a modest way , and provided with the necessary supply of cheerful small - talk . But the meal having come to an end , she had her domestic excuse ready , and unostentatiously disappeared like a well - bred young lady . I never met her on the stairs , never found myself intruding on her in the drawing - room , never caught her getting out of my way in the garden . As much at a loss for an explanation of these mysteries as I was , Miss Jillgall 's interest in my welfare led her to caution me in a vague and general way . "
78532	78561	78562	78563	Miss Helena	52	" In less than half an hour afterward , Helena caught me . I was writing in my room , when the maidservant came in with a message : "
78581	78613	78571	78571	you	3443	" My first excuse was of course that I was engaged . This was disposed of by a second message , provided beforehand , no doubt , for an anticipated refusal : "
78630	78659	78617	78617	me	0	" I was still obstinate ; I pleaded next that my day was filled up . A third message had evidently been prepared , even for this emergency : "
78687	79168	78673	78673	she	52	" Persistency so inveterate as this led to a result which Mr. Gracedieu 's cautious daughter had not perhaps contemplated : it put me on my guard . There seemed to be a chance , to say the least of it , that I might serve Eunice 's interests if I discovered what the enemy had to say . I locked up my writing - declared myself incapable of putting Miss Helena to needless inconvenience - and followed the maid to the lower floor of the house . The room to which I was conducted proved to be empty . I looked round me . If I had been told that a man lived there who was absolutely indifferent to appearances , I should have concluded that his views were faithfully represented by his place of abode . The chairs and tables reminded me of a railway waiting - room . The shabby little bookcase was the mute record of a life indifferent to literature . The carpet was of that dreadful drab color , still the cherished favorite of the average English mind , in spite of every protest that can be entered against it , on behalf of Art . The ceiling , recently whitewashed ; made my eyes ache when they looked at it . On either side of the window , flaccid green curtains hung helplessly with nothing to loop them up . The writing - desk and the paper - case , viewed as specimens of woodwork , recalled the ready - made bedrooms on show in cheap shops . The books , mostly in slate - colored bindings , were devoted to the literature which is called religious ; I only discovered three worldly publications among them - Domestic Cookery , Etiquette for Ladies , and Hints on the Breeding of Poultry . An ugly little clock , ticking noisily in a black case , and two candlesticks of base metal placed on either side of it , completed the ornaments on the chimney - piece . Neither pictures nor prints hid the barrenness of the walls . I saw no needlework and no flowers . The one object in the place which showed any pretensions to beauty was a looking - glass in an elegant gilt frame - sacred to vanity , and worthy of the office that it filled . Such was Helena Gracedieu 's sitting - room . I really could not help thinking : How like her ! She came in with a face perfectly adapted to the circumstances - pleased and smiling ; amiably deferential , in consideration of the claims of her father 's guest - and , to my surprise , in some degree suggestive of one of those incorrigible female prisoners , to whom Miss Jillgall had referred me when she offered a word of advice . "
79255	79410	79250	79250	my	0	" She pointed the last remark by a look at herself in the glass ; using it , while she despised it . Yes : there was a handsome face , paying her its reflected compliment - but not so well matched as it might have been by a handsome figure . Her feet were too large ; her shoulders were too high ; the graceful undulations of a well - made girl were absent when she walked ; and her bosom was , to my mind , unduly developed for her time of life . She sat down by me with her back to the light . Happening to be opposite to the window , I offered her the advantage of a clear view of my face . She waited for me , and I waited for her - and there was an awkward pause before we spoke . She set the example . "
79416	79420	79250	79250	my	0	" she remarked . "

79562	79574	79550	79550	I	0	" She drew her chair a little further away from me . "
79580	79584	79575	79575	I	0	" she said . "

79867	79890	79862	79862	you	0	" I got up to go . With an ironical gesture of remonstrance , she signed to me to sit down again . "
79940	79947	79950	79950	you	52	" I returned to my chair . "
79954	79959	79950	79950	you	52	" she went out , "
79990	80008	79973	79974	Miss Jillgall	66	" When the female mind gets into this state , no wise man answers the female questions . "
80019	80049	79973	79974	Miss Jillgall	66	" Miss Helena inquired . I begged her to interpret my silence in the sense most agreeable to herself . This naturally encouraged her . She made a proposal : "
80058	80059	80051	80051	you	52	" "
80068	80159	80065	80066	Miss Helena	52	" We changed chairs ; the light now fell full on her face . Had she deliberately challenged me to look into her secret mind if I could ? Anything like the stark insensibility of that young girl to every refinement of feeling , to every becoming doubt of herself , to every customary timidity of her age and sex in the presence of a man who had not disguised his unfavorable opinion of her , I never met with in all my experience of the world and of women . "
80169	80173	80174	80174	your	52	" she explained ; "
80226	80227	80214	80214	she	66	" "
80230	80231	80214	80214	she	66	" "
80247	80248	80249	80249	She	66	" "
80252	80253	80249	80249	She	66	" "
80291	80292	80277	80277	you	52	" "
80316	80344	80345	80345	You	52	" I was provoked into saying that . It failed entirely as a well - meant effort in the way of implied reproof . Miss Helena smiled . "
80359	80367	80368	80368	We	2058	" That was how she viewed it . "
80425	80426	80421	80421	you	52	" "
80434	80438	80428	80428	you	52	" I said , "
80453	80454	80439	80439	you	52	" "
80465	80469	80456	80456	you	52	" she suggested . "
80482	80492	80479	80479	you	52	" After that concession , she was amiability itself . "
80497	80502	80479	80479	you	52	" she assured me , "
80508	80515	80516	80516	Philip	47	" And she went on accordingly : "
80555	80556	80551	80551	you	52	" "
80565	80566	80567	80567	I	0	" "
80574	80599	80567	80567	I	0	" She made that amazing reply with such perfect composure , that I began to fear there must have been some misunderstanding between us . "
80611	80663	80604	80604	you	52	" I persisted . Her patience with me was most exemplary . She lowered herself to my level . Not trusting to words only on this occasion , she so to say beat her meaning into my head by gesticulating on her fingers , as if she was educating a child . "
80668	80672	80664	80664	Philip	47	" she began , "
80700	80711	80712	80712	Philip	47	" She impressed this on me by touching her forefinger . "
80743	80756	80757	80757	Philip	47	" She assisted me in understanding this by touching her middle finger . "
80781	80801	80802	80802	I	0	" A touch on her third finger , and an indulgent bow , announced that the lesson was ended . "
80811	80816	80802	80802	I	0	" she modestly acknowledged , "
80854	80855	80857	80857	me	0	" "
80859	80863	80857	80857	me	0	" I said , "
80870	80871	80864	80865	a person	395	" "
80877	80878	80879	80880	Your sister	3944	" "
80882	80897	80879	80880	Your sister	3944	" A little perplexed at first , Miss Helena reflected , and recovered herself . "
80902	80906	80879	80880	Your sister	3944	" she said ; "
80995	81156	80990	80990	I	0	" Let me not attempt to disguise it - Miss Helena Gracedieu confounded me . Ordinary audacity is one of those forms of insolence which mature experience dismisses with contempt . This girl 's audacity struck down all resistance , for one shocking reason : it was unquestionably sincere . Strong conviction of her own virtue stared at me in her proud and daring eyes . At that time , I was not aware of what I have learned since . The horrid hardening of her moral sense had been accomplished by herself . In her diary , there has been found the confession of a secret course of reading - with supplementary reflections flowing from it , which need only to be described as worthy of their source . A person capable of repentance and reform would , in her place , have seen that she had disgusted me . Not a suspicion of this occurred to Miss Helena . "
81163	81167	81159	81159	you	2077	" she remarked , "
81204	81205	81198	81198	I	0	" "
81208	81212	81198	81198	I	0	" I said , "

81223	81227	81219	81219	We	2079	" she replied . "
81248	81267	81235	81235	yourself	2077	" She rose , and took a turn in the room - and stopped , eying me attentively . "
81274	81278	81269	81269	you	2077	" she asked . "
81281	81282	81269	81269	you	2077	" "
81291	81292	81293	81293	My	0	" "

81345	81636	81336	81336	I	0	" The exasperating influences of her language , her looks , and her tones would , as I venture to think , have got to the end of another man 's self - control before this . Anyway , she had at last irritated me into speaking as strongly as I felt . What I said had been so plainly perhaps so rudely expressed , that misinterpretation of it seemed to be impossible . She mistook me , nevertheless . The most merciless disclosure of the dreary side of human destiny is surely to be found in the failure of words , spoken or written , so to answer their purpose that we can trust them , in our attempts to communicate with each other . Even when he seems to be connected , by the nearest and dearest relations , with his fellow - mortals , what a solitary creature , tried by the test of sympathy , the human being really is in the teeming world that he inhabits ! Affording one more example of the impotence of human language to speak for itself , my misinterpreted words had found their way to the one sensitive place in Helena Gracedieu 's impenetrable nature . She betrayed it in the quivering and flushing of her hard face , and in the appeal to the looking - glass which escaped her eyes the next moment . My hasty reply had roused the idea of a covert insult addressed to her handsome face . In other words , I had wounded her vanity . Driven by resentment , out came the secret distrust of me which had been lurking in that cold heart , from the moment when we first met . "

81779	81846	81770	81771	Miss Jillgall	66	" In alluding to Eunice , she had blundered , strangely enough , on something like the truth . But when she spoke of herself , the headlong malignity of her suspicions - making every allowance for the anger that had hurried her into them - seemed to call for some little protest against a false assertion . I told her that she was completely mistaken . "
81852	81856	81857	81857	I	0	" she answered ; "
81861	81862	81857	81857	I	0	" "

81898	81983	81888	81888	You	2081	" The reply was too ridiculous for the preservation of any control over my own sense of humor . It was wrong ; but it was inevitable - I laughed . She looked at me with a fury , revealing a concentration of evil passion in her which I had not seen yet . I asked her pardon ; I begged her to think a little before she persisted in taking a view of my conduct unworthy of her , and unjust to myself . "
81988	81993	81888	81888	You	2081	" she burst out . "
82071	82145	82146	82146	You	2081	" No such outrage as this had ever been inflicted on me , at any time in my life . My forbearance must , I suppose , have been more severely tried than I was aware of myself . With or without excuse for me , I was weak enough to let a girl 's spiteful tongue sting me , and , worse still , to let her see that I felt it . "
82160	82204	82205	82205	Your	2081	" With that foolish reply , I opened the door violently and went out . She ran after me , triumphing in having roused the temper of a man old enough to have been her grandfather , and caught me by the arm . "
82212	82221	82205	82205	Your	2081	" That was literally how she expressed herself . "
82262	82277	82250	82250	you	2081	" I shook her hand off with an inconsiderable roughness , humiliating to remember . "
82282	82286	82287	82287	I	0	" I cried . "
82297	82353	82287	82287	I	0	" The moment the words had passed my lips , I came to my senses again ; I remembered what fatal words they might prove to be , if they reached the Minister 's ears . Heard only by his daughter , my reply seemed to cool the heat of her anger in an instant . "
82360	82364	82355	82355	you	0	" she said . "
82395	82427	82373	82373	he	615	" I was wise enough - now when wisdom had come too late - not to attempt to explain myself , and not to give her an opportunity of saying more . "
82439	82443	82373	82373	he	615	" I answered , "
82468	82742	82460	82460	I	0	" In the solitude of my room , I was able to look my position fairly in the face . Mr. Gracedieu 's wife had come to me , in the long - past time , without her husband 's knowledge . Tempted to a cruel resolve by the maternal triumph of having an infant of her own , she had resolved to rid herself of the poor little rival in her husband 's fatherly affection , by consigning the adopted child to the keeping of a charitable asylum . She had dared to ask me to help her . I had kept the secret of her shameful visit - I can honestly say , for the Minister 's sake . And now , long after time had doomed those events to oblivion , they were revived - and revived by me . Thanks to my folly , Mr. Gracedieu 's daughter knew what I had concealed from Mr. Gracedieu himself . What course did respect for my friend , and respect for myself , counsel me to take ? I could only see before me a choice of two evils . To wait for events - with the too certain prospect of a vindictive betrayal of my indiscretion by Helena Gracedieu . Or to take the initiative into my own hands , and risk consequences which I might regret to the end of my life , by making my confession to the Minister . Before I had decided , somebody knocked at the door . It was the maid - servant again . Was it possible she had been sent by Helena ? "
82746	82747	82750	82750	sir	3443	" "
82759	83006	82752	82753	My master	2101	" CHAPTER XXXVIII . THE GIRLS ' AGES . Had the Minister 's desire to see me been inspired by his daughter 's betrayal of what I had unfortunately said to her ? Although he would certainly not consent to receive her personally , she would be at liberty to adopt a written method of communication with him , and the letter might be addressed in such a manner as to pique his curiosity . If Helena 's vindictive purpose had been already accomplished - and if Mr. Gracedieu left me no alternative but to present his unworthy wife in her true character - I can honestly say that I dreaded the consequences , not as they might affect myself , but as they might affect my unhappy friend in his enfeebled state of body and mind . When I entered his room , he was still in bed . The bed - curtains were so drawn , on the side nearest to the window , as to keep the light from falling too brightly on his weak eyes . In the shadow thus thrown on him , it was not possible to see his face plainly enough , from the open side of the bed , to arrive at any definite conclusion as to what might be passing in his mind . After having been awake for some hours during the earlier part of the night , he had enjoyed a long and undisturbed sleep . "
83013	83017	83007	83007	I	0	" he said , "
83031	83060	83019	83019	I	0	" If the quiet tone of his voice was not an assumed tone , he was surely ignorant of all that had passed between his daughter and myself . "
83067	83071	83019	83019	I	0	" he proceeded , "
83150	83279	83280	83280	You	2105	" He spoke more clearly and collectedly than I had heard him speak yet . Here and there I detected hesitations and repetitions , which I have purposely passed over . The substance of what he said to me is all that I shall present in this place . Careful as I have been to keep my record of events within strict limits , I have written at a length which I was far indeed from contemplating when I accepted Mr. Gracedieu 's invitation . Having promised to comply with the strange request which he had addressed to me , I ventured to remind him of past occasions on which he had pointedly abstained , when the subject presented itself , from speaking of the girls ' ages . "
83288	83292	83285	83285	my	0	" I added , "
83329	83330	83331	83331	You	2105	" "
83336	83340	83331	83331	You	2105	" he answered . "
83369	83417	83354	83354	I	0	" He said this with a sullen emphasis . In my position , the worst of evils was suspense . I told him that my curiosity could wait ; and I begged that he would relieve his mind of what was pressing on it at the moment . "
83424	83449	83354	83354	I	0	" he said . I waited anxiously for the decision at which he might arrive . Nothing came of it to justify my misgivings . "
83463	83467	83452	83452	I	0	" he said . "
83518	83885	83886	83886	I	0	" Strange as the preface was , the explanation that followed was stranger yet . I offer a shortened and simplified version , giving accurately the substance of what I heard . The Minister entered without reserve on the mysterious subject of the ages . Eunice , he informed me , was nearly two years older than Helena . If she outwardly showed her superiority of age , any person acquainted with the circumstances under which the adopted infant had been received into Mr. Gracedieu 's childless household , need only compare the so - called sisters in after - life , and would thereupon identify the eldest - looking young lady of the two as the offspring of the woman who had been hanged for murder . With such a misfortune as this presenting itself as a possible prospect , the Minister was bound to prevent the girls from ignorantly betraying each other by allusions to their ages and their birthdays . After much thought , he had devised a desperate means of meeting the difficulty - already made known , as I am told , for the information of strangers who may read the pages that have gone before mine . My friend 's plan of proceeding had , by the nature of it , exposed him to injurious comment , to embarrassing questions , and to doubts and misconceptions , all patiently endured in consideration of the security that had been attained . Proud of his explanation , Mr. Gracedieu 's vanity called upon me to acknowledge that my curiosity had been satisfied , and my doubts completely set at rest . No : my obstinate common sense was not reduced to submission , even yet . Looking back over a lapse of seventeen years , I asked what had happened , in that long interval , to justify the anxieties which still appeared to trouble my friend . This time , my harmless curiosity could be gratified by a reply expressed in three words - nothing had happened . Then what , in Heaven 's name , was the Minister afraid of ? His voice dropped to a whisper . He said : "
83893	84076	84077	84077	She	2110	" Who were the women ? Two of them actually proved to be the servants employed in Mr. Gracedieu 's house , at the bygone time when he had brought the child home with him from the prison ! To point out the absurdity of the reasons that he gave for fearing what female curiosity might yet attempt , if circumstances happened to encourage it , would have been a mere waste of words . Dismissing the subject , I next ascertained that the Minister 's doubts extended even to the two female warders , who had been appointed to watch the murderess in turn , during her last days in prison . I easily relieved his mind in this case . One of the warders was dead . The other had married a farmer in Australia . Had we exhausted the list of suspected persons yet ? No : there was one more left ; and the Minister declared that he had first met with her in my official residence , at the time when I was Governor of the prison . "
84085	84089	84091	84091	she	2110	" he said ; "
84098	84122	84095	84096	A Miss	2111	" He paused to consult his memory , and this time thanks perhaps to his night 's rest his memory answered the appeal . "
84128	84132	84133	84134	Miss Chance	41	" he cried - "
84136	84227	84133	84134	Miss Chance	41	" My friend had interested me in his imaginary perils at last . It was just possible that he might have a formidable person to deal with now . During my residence at Florence , the Chaplain and I had taken many a retrospective look as old men will at past events in our lives . My former colleague spoke of the time when he had performed clerical duty for his friend , the rector of a parish church in London . Neither he nor I had heard again of the "
84230	84524	84549	84549	He	2112	" of our disagreeable prison experience , whom he had married to the dashing Dutch gentleman , Mr. Tenbruggen . We could only wonder what had become of that mysterious married pair . Mr. Gracedieu being undoubtedly ignorant of the woman 's marriage , it was not easy to say what the consequence might be , in his excitable state , if I informed him of it . He would , in all probability , conclude that I knew more of the woman than he did . I decided on keeping my own counsel , for the present at least . Passing at once , therefore , to the one consideration of any importance , I endeavored to find out whether Mr. Gracedieu and Mrs. Tenbruggen had met , or had communicated with each other in any way , during the long period of separation that had taken place between the Minister and myself . If he had been so unlucky as to offend her , she was beyond all doubt an enemy to be dreaded . Apart , however , from a misfortune of this kind , she would rank , in my opinion , with the other harmless objects of Mr. Gracedieu 's distrust . In making my inquiries , I found that I had an obstacle to contend with . While he felt the renovating influence of the repose that he enjoyed , the Minister had been able to think and to express himself with less difficulty than usual . But the reserves of strength , on which the useful exercise of his memory depended , began to fail him as the interview proceeded . He distinctly recollected that ' something unpleasant had passed between that audacious woman and himself . "
84560	84569	84551	84551	he	2112	" had been in two minds about her . "
84690	84693	84709	84709	I	0	" Miss Chance "
84751	84762	84763	84763	I	0	" You might find the lost recollection in that way , "

85395	85401	85402	85403	The Minister	161	" May I come in ? "
85416	85422	85423	85423	he	161	" Eunice , at last ! "
85426	85431	85423	85423	he	161	" Let her in . "
85472	85483	85463	85463	her	53	" Oh , poor papa , how ill you look ! "
85567	85571	85572	85572	he	161	" My darling , "
85575	85608	85572	85572	he	161	" you do n't see my old friend . Love him , and look up to him , Eunice . He will be your friend , too , when I am gone . "
85645	85654	85655	85655	she	53	" Do you think he is seriously ill ? "
85727	85733	85734	85734	she	53	" Now I am happier , "
85739	85847	85734	85734	she	53	" Only to hear your voice seems to encourage me . On our way here , Selina did nothing but talk of you . She told me I should n't have time to feel afraid of the great man ; he would make me fond of him directly . I said , ' Are you fond of him ? ' She said , ' Madly in love with him , my dear . ' My little friend really thinks you like her , and is very proud of it . There are some people who call her ugly . I hope you do n't agree with them ? "
85867	85874	85875	85875	he	63	" How does she strike you ? "
85880	85896	85875	85875	he	63	" Is it too soon to ask if she shows her age in her face ? "
85897	85906	85907	85907	I	0	" Neither in her face nor her figure , "
85910	85945	85907	85907	I	0	" it astonishes me that you can ever have doubted it . No stranger , judging by personal appearance , could fail to make the mistake of thinking Helena the oldest of the two . "
85952	85963	85964	85964	he	63	" Her figure seems to bear out what you say , "
85968	85976	85964	85964	he	63	" Almost childish , is n't it ? "
86057	86063	86064	86064	he	63	" You speak very confidently , "
86067	86094	86064	86064	he	63	" considering that you have not seen the girls together . Think what a dreadful blow it would be to me if you made a mistake . "
86168	86174	86175	86175	he	63	" I must say it , "
86178	86202	86175	86175	he	63	" and I am afraid of her hearing me . Is there anything in her face that reminds you of her miserable mother ? "
86466	86477	86478	86478	he	614	" My pleasure has been almost too much for me , "
86481	86496	86478	86478	he	614	" Leave me for a while to rest , and get used to it . "
86660	86678	86679	86679	she	53	" Will you come with me to the part of the garden that I am fondest of ? "
86759	86767	86768	86768	she	53	" I was once very happy here , "
86771	86848	86768	86768	she	53	" When the time of the heartache came soon after , I was afraid to look at the old tree and the bench under it . But that is all over now . I like to remember the hours that were once dear to me , and to see the place that recalls them . Do you know who I am thinking of ? Do n't be afraid of distressing me . I never cry now . "
86849	86872	86768	86768	she	53	" My dear child , I have heard your sad story - but I ca n't trust myself to speak of it . "
86873	86882	86768	86768	she	53	" Because you are so sorry for me ? "
86883	86893	86768	86768	she	53	" No words can say how sorry I am ! "
86894	86903	86768	86768	she	53	" But you are not angry with Philip ? "
86904	86925	86768	86768	she	53	" Not angry ! My poor dear , I am afraid to tell you how angry I am with him . "
86926	86962	86768	86768	she	53	" Oh , no ! You must n't say that . If you wish to be kind to me - and I am sure you do wish it - do n't think bitterly of Philip . "

87011	87018	87019	87019	She	2170	" that you have forgiven him ? "
87024	87032	87019	87019	She	2170	" How could I help forgiving him ? "
87083	87089	87090	87090	she	2170	" Do I surprise you ? "
87094	87223	87224	87224	She	2174	" Perhaps love will bear any humiliation . Or perhaps I am only a poor weak creature . You do n't know what a comfort it was to me to keep the few letters that I received from Philip . When I heard that he had gone away , I gave his letters the kiss that bade him good - by . That was the time , I think , when my poor bruised heart got used to the pain ; I began to feel that there was one consolation still left for me - I might end in forgiving him . Why do I tell you all this ? I think you must have bewitched me . Is this really the first time I have seen you ? "
87270	87297	87265	87265	my	0	" I remember you an easily - pleased little creature , amusing yourself with the broken toys which were once the playthings of my own children . "

87406	87428	87403	87403	she	53	" did you know what it was to love , and to be loved - and then to lose it all ? "
87535	87545	87515	87515	I	0	" Too well , my child ; too well ! "
87630	87642	87643	87643	I	0	" Did you expect me to tell my own sad story , "
87646	87658	87643	87643	I	0	" as frankly and as trustfully as you have told yours ? "
87659	87717	87763	87763	She	2174	" Oh , do n't think that ! I know what an effort it was to you to answer me at all . Yes , indeed ! I wonder whether I may ask something . The sorrow you have just told me of is not the only one - is it ? You have had other troubles ? "
87718	87723	87763	87763	She	2174	" Many of them . "
87724	87729	87730	87730	she	2174	" There are times , "
87734	87762	87730	87730	she	2174	" when one ca n't help thinking of one 's own miserable self . I try to be cheerful , but those times come now and then . "
87780	87787	87788	87788	she	2174	" You know who Selina is ? "
87791	87806	87788	87788	she	2174	" My friend ! The only friend I had , till you came here . "
87834	87849	87850	87850	she	2174	" Selina has , I daresay , told you that I have been ill , "
87853	87869	87850	87850	she	2174	" and that I am staying in the country for the benefit of my health . "

87975	88021	87971	87971	she	2174	" Shall I make you angry with me ? or shall I make you laugh at me ? What I have shrunk from confessing to Selina - what I dare not confess to my father - I must , and will , confess to You . "
88099	88108	88109	88109	she	2174	" Did you notice how I behaved upstairs ? "
88112	88128	88109	88109	she	2174	" I mean when we left my father , and came out on the landing . "
88141	88147	88148	88148	she	2174	" Before I went downstairs , "
88151	88182	88148	88148	she	2174	" you saw me look and listen . Did you think I was afraid of meeting some person ? and did you guess who it was I wanted to avoid ? "
88183	88193	88148	88148	she	2174	" I guessed that - and I understood you . "
88194	88221	88148	88148	she	2174	" No ! You are not wicked enough to understand me . Will you do me a favor ? I want you to look at me . "

88253	88267	88250	88250	she	2174	" which makes you fear that I am not in my right mind ? "
88268	88281	88282	88282	She	2174	" Good God ! how can you ask such a horrible question ? "
88298	88306	88307	88307	she	2174	" I ought to have known better , "
88310	88382	88307	88307	she	2174	" there is no such easy way out of it as that . Tell me - is there one kind of wickedness more deceitful than another ? Can it be hid in a person for years together , and show itself when a time of suffering - no ; I mean when a sense of injury comes ? Did you ever see that , when you were master in the prison ? "
88403	88411	88396	88396	I	0	" Did you pity those poor wretches ? "

88431	88476	88428	88428	she	2174	" Pity me . If Helena looks at me - if Helena speaks to me - if I only see Helena by accident - do you know what she does ? She tempts me ! Tempts me to do dreadful things ! Tempts me - "
88539	88545	88546	88546	she	3762	" What does it mean ? "
88549	88799	88546	88546	she	3762	" I 'll submit to anything . I 'll bear my hard lot patiently , if you will only tell me what it means . Where does this horrid transformation of me out of myself come from ? Look at my good father . In all this world there is no man so perfect as he is . And oh , how he has taught me ! there is n't a single good thing that I have not learned from him since I was a little child . Did you ever hear him speak of my mother ? You must have heard him . My mother was an angel . I could never be worthy of her at my best - but I have tried ! I have tried ! The wickedest girl in the world does n't have worse thoughts than the thoughts that have come to me . Since when ? Since Helena - oh , how can I call her by her name as if I still loved her ? Since my sister - can she be my sister , I ask myself sometimes ! Since my enemy - there 's the word for her - since my enemy took Philip away from me . What does it mean ? I have asked in my prayers - and have got no answer . I ask you . What does it mean ? You must tell me ! You shall tell me ! What does it mean ? "
88904	88911	88912	88912	I	0	" Let us talk of Philip , "
88955	88958	88959	88959	she	2188	" No , "
88962	88971	88959	88959	she	2188	" we had better not talk of him . "
88972	88976	88959	88959	she	2188	" Why not ? "
88977	88997	88998	88998	I	0	" I have lost all my courage . If you speak of Philip , you will make me cry . "
89042	89045	89038	89038	I	0	" Cry ! "
89680	89684	89685	89685	she	53	" Look again , "
89821	89909	89910	89910	Eunice	53	" Pray excuse me for disturbing you . I am obliged to leave the house on one of my tiresome domestic errands . If you will kindly permit it , I wish to express , before I go , my very sincere regret for what I was rude enough to say , when I last had the honor of seeing you . May I hope to be forgiven ? How - do - you - do , Eunice ? Have you enjoyed your holiday in the country ? "
89953	89957	89958	89958	she	52	" Quite needless , "
89961	89978	89958	89958	she	52	" I shall not detain you for more than a minute . Please look at this . "
90007	90019	89979	89979	She	52	" Philip 's Letters To Me . Private . Helena Gracedieu . "
90020	90028	90029	90029	she	52	" I have a favor to ask , "
90032	90124	90125	90125	she	52	" and a proof of confidence in you to offer . Will you be so good as to look over what you find in my portfolio ? I am unwilling to give up the hopes that I had founded on our interview , when I asked for it . The letters will , I venture to think , plead my cause more convincingly than I was able to plead it for myself . I wish to forget what passed between us , to the last word . To the last word , "
90147	90153	90154	90154	she	52	" Will you indulge me ? "
90423	90429	90430	90430	I	0	" Understand , Miss Helena , "
90433	90453	90430	90430	I	0	" that I make no promises . I reserve my own opinion , and my own right of action . "
90454	90466	90467	90467	she	2230	" I am not afraid of your opinions or your actions , "
90471	90510	90467	90467	she	2230	" if you will only read the letters . In the meantime , let me relieve my sister , there , of my presence . I hope you will soon recover , Eunice , in the country air . "
90566	90573	90574	90574	she	52	" Sad , is n't it ? "
90678	90687	90688	90688	I	0	" There is nothing to be afraid of , "
90691	90696	90688	90688	I	0	" She has gone . "
90707	90713	90714	90714	she	53	" How do you know ? "
90717	90733	90714	90714	she	53	" I hear her ; but I never see her . Do you see her ? "
90734	90746	90747	90747	She	53	" My dear child ! of what person are you speaking ? "
90750	90772	90747	90747	She	53	" Of no person . I am speaking of a Voice that whispers and tempts me , when Helena is near . "
90773	90779	90714	90714	she	53	" What voice , Eunice ? "
90780	91007	90747	90747	She	53	" The whispering Voice . It said to me , ' I am your mother ; ' it called me Daughter when I first heard it . My father speaks of my mother , the angel . That good spirit has never come to me from the better world . It is a mock - mother who comes to me - some spirit of evil . Listen to this . I was awake in my bed . In the dark I heard the mock - mother whispering , close at my ear . Shall I tell you how she answered me , when I longed for light to see her by , when I prayed to her to show herself to me ? She said : ' My face was hidden when I passed from life to death ; my face no mortal creature may see . ' I have never seen her - how can you have seen her ? But I heard her again , just now . She whispered to me when Helena was standing there - where you are standing . She freezes the life in me . Did she freeze the life in you ? Did you hear her tempting me ? Do n't speak of it , if you did . Oh , not a word ! not a word ! "
91020	91028	91018	91018	Macbeth	105	" I have supped full with horrors . "
91165	91173	91174	91174	I	0	" Selina will think we are lost , "
91177	91185	91174	91174	I	0	" Let us go and find Selina . "
91186	91192	91193	91193	she	53	" Not for the world , "
91196	91200	91193	91193	she	53	" Why not ? "
91201	91238	91239	91239	I	0	" Because I do n't feel sure of myself . I might tell Selina something which she must never know ; I should be so sorry to frighten her . Let me stop here with you . "
91247	91254	91255	91255	I	0	" Let me take your hand . "
91306	91315	91316	91316	she	53	" I am afraid I have surprised you , "
91319	91329	91316	91316	she	53	" Helena brings the dreadful time back to me - "
91335	91345	91330	91330	She	53	" Do n't speak of Helena , my dear . "
91346	91370	91371	91371	she	53	" But I am afraid you will think - because I have said strange things - that I have been talking at random , "
91374	91417	91371	91371	she	53	" The doctor will say that , if you meet with him . He believes I am deluded by a dream . I tried to think so myself . It was of no use ; I am quite sure he is wrong . "
91439	91551	91435	91435	Eunice	53	" I have the story of a terrible night to tell you ; but I have n't the courage to tell it now . Why should n't you come back with me to the place that I am staying at ? A pleasant farm - house , and such kind people . You might read the account of that night in my journal . I shall not regret the misery of having written it , if it helps you to find out how this hateful second self of mine has come to me . Hush ! I want to ask you something . Do you think Helena is in the house ? "
91552	91560	91435	91435	Eunice	53	" No - she has gone out . "
91561	91572	91435	91435	Eunice	53	" Did she say that herself ? Are you sure ? "
91573	91577	91578	91578	She	2244	" Quite sure . "
91634	91641	91642	91642	she	3601	" Where did you get that ? "
91659	91667	91668	91668	she	3601	" Carry it in your other hand , "
91671	91713	91668	91668	she	3601	" the hand that 's furthest away from me . I do n't want to see it ! Do you mind waiting a moment while I find Selina ? You will go to the farm with us , wo n't you ? "
92007	92021	92022	92022	I	0	" Suppose I see Mr. Philip Dunboyne when I go back to London , "
92025	92033	92022	92022	I	0	" what shall I say to him ? "
92034	92041	92022	92022	I	0	" Say I have forgiven him . "
92042	92046	92047	92047	I	0	" And suppose , "
92051	92089	92047	92047	I	0	" that the blame really rests , where you all believe it to rest , with Helena . If that young man returns to you , truly ashamed of himself , truly penitent , will you - ? "
92095	92098	92090	92090	She	3601	" No ! "
92099	92109	92090	92090	She	3601	" Oh , Eunice , you surely mean Yes ? "
92110	92115	92090	92090	She	3601	" I mean No ! "
92116	92119	92090	92090	She	3601	" Why ? "
92120	92134	92090	92090	She	3601	" Do n't ask me ! Good - by till to - morrow . "
93107	93117	93118	93118	he	615	" It is n't a bad one for London , "
93121	93129	93118	93118	he	615	" wo n't you have some yourself ? "
93130	93140	93141	93142	Mrs. Staveley	59	" I do n't seem to have interested you , "
93145	93156	93141	93142	Mrs. Staveley	59	" What did you expect me to be interested in ? "
93161	93177	93141	93142	Mrs. Staveley	59	" I was absorbed in the fowl . Favor me by returning to the subject . "
93188	93216	93182	93182	she	59	" The subject , sir , was your son 's admiration for a charming girl : one of the daughters of Mr. Gracedieu , the famous preacher . "
93249	93257	93246	93246	he	615	" Philip was engaged to be married . "
93258	93265	93266	93267	Mrs. Staveley	59	" I am not quite sure , "
93270	93285	93266	93267	Mrs. Staveley	59	" Then , my dear friend , we will wait till we are sure . "
93286	93315	93266	93267	Mrs. Staveley	59	" But , Mr. Dunboyne , there is really no need to wait . I suppose your son comes here , now and then , to see you ? "
93316	93352	93421	93422	Mrs. Staveley	59	" My son is most attentive . In course of time he will contrive to hit on the right hour for his visit . At present , poor fellow , he interrupts me every day . "
93353	93365	93266	93267	Mrs. Staveley	59	" Suppose he hits upon the right time to - morrow ? "
93366	93369	93266	93267	Mrs. Staveley	59	" Yes ? "
93370	93380	93421	93422	Mrs. Staveley	59	" You might ask him if he is engaged ? "
93381	93397	93421	93422	Mrs. Staveley	59	" Pardon me . I think I might wait till Philip mentions it without asking . "
93398	93406	93266	93267	Mrs. Staveley	59	" What an extraordinary man you are ! "
93407	93418	93421	93422	Mrs. Staveley	59	" Oh , no , no - only a philosopher . "
93450	93458	93459	93459	she	59	" That 's thrown away upon me , "
93462	93472	93459	93459	she	59	" I do n't know what a philosopher is . "
93629	93639	93640	93640	he	615	" You do n't know what a philosopher is ! "
93643	93658	93640	93640	he	615	" Be so kind as to look at me . I am a philosopher . "
93663	93933	93659	93660	Mrs. Staveley	59	" And a philosopher , my charming friend , is a man who has discovered a system of life . Some systems assert themselves in volumes - my system asserts itself in two words : Never think of anything until you have first asked yourself if there is an absolute necessity for doing it , at that particular moment . Thinking of things , when things need n't be thought of , is offering an opportunity to Worry ; and Worry is the favorite agent of Death when the destroyer handles his work in a lingering way , and achieves premature results . Never look back , and never look forward , as long as you can possibly help it . Looking back leads the way to sorrow . And looking forward ends in the cruelest of all delusions : it encourages hope . The present time is the precious time . Live for the passing day : the passing day is all that we can be sure of . You suggested , just now , that I should ask my son if he was engaged to be married . How do we know what wear and tear of your nervous texture I succeeded in saving when I said . ' Wait till Philip mentions it without asking ? ' There is the personal application of my system . I have explained it in my time to every woman on the list of my acquaintance , including the female servants . Not one of them has rewarded me by adopting my system . How do you feel about it ? "
94182	94193	94194	94194	He	615	" Your business , Philip : do n't interrupt me . "
94669	94675	94677	94678	the philosopher	2342	" How do we know , "
94680	94752	94677	94678	the philosopher	2342	" what accidents may happen , or what doubts and hesitations may yet turn up ? I am not to burden my mind in this matter , till I know that I must do it . Let me hear when she is ready to go to church , and I will be ready with the settlements . My compliments to Miss and her papa , and let us wait a little . "
95077	95084	95070	95070	she	120	" Who is this young gentleman ? "
95097	95114	95089	95089	his	615	" Do n't interrupt me again , ma'am . The young gentleman is my son Philip . "
95179	95216	95168	95169	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" She takes liberties with my neck ; she interrupts me in my reading ; and she does me no good . I shall end , Philip , in applying a medical rubbing to Mrs. Tenbruggen . "
95226	95228	95224	95227	the masterful " Masseuse	5203	" Masseuse "
95247	95263	95238	95238	She	49	" Well , Mr. Philip , when are you going to marry Miss Eunice Gracedieu ? "
95269	95272	95273	95273	he	615	" Eunice ? "
95276	95302	95273	95273	he	615	" When my son told me he was engaged to Miss Gracedieu , he said ' Helena ' ! Philip , what does this mean ? "
95314	95328	95303	95304	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" Some mistake , sir ; it 's Eunice he is engaged to . "
95335	95344	95345	95345	I	0	" How the devil do you know that ? "
95357	95387	95349	95350	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" I am sorry to see , sir , that your son 's education has been neglected ; he seems to be grossly ignorant of the laws of politeness . "
95388	95396	95398	95399	my father	615	" Never mind the laws of politeness , "
95401	95423	95424	95425	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" You appear to be better acquainted with my son 's matrimonial prospects than he is himself . How is that ? "
95433	95459	95424	95425	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" My authority is a letter , addressed to me by a relative of Mr. Gracedieu - my dear and intimate friend , Miss Jillgall . "
95477	95484	95485	95485	he	615	" Which am I to believe ? "
95488	95498	95499	95499	I	0	" I am surprised at your asking the question , "
95508	95539	95502	95503	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" Look at Mr. Philip , sir - and you will allow him one merit . He is capable of showing it , when he knows he has disgraced himself . "
95580	95587	95588	95590	The illustrious Rubber	2361	" Mrs. Tenbruggen , you lie ! "
95623	95643	95644	95644	She	49	" Either your son or I , sir , must leave the room . Which is it to be ? "
95682	95705	95678	95678	her	49	" Messieurs Dunboyne , father and son , I keep my temper , and merely regard you as a couple of blackguards . "
95776	95790	95770	95770	me	0	" Did you say that the father of these girls was a parson ? "
95791	95798	95765	95765	he	615	" Yes - a Congregational Minister . "
95799	95808	95834	95834	him	615	" What does the Minister think of you ? "
95809	95817	95770	95770	me	0	" I do n't know , sir . "
95818	95822	95765	95765	he	615	" Find out . "
96175	96195	96163	96163	She	120	" I shall expect to be favored with your decision to - morrow morning , in my housekeeping room . "
96241	96255	96256	96256	she	66	" If you will excuse the use of strong language by a lady , "
96259	96305	96256	96256	she	66	" Helena looked perfectly devilish when she opened the letter . She rushed away , and locked herself up in her own shabby room . A serious obstacle , as I suspect , in the way of her marriage . Cheering , is n't it ? "
96372	96383	96384	96384	she	52	" I mean to come to the point at once , "
96387	96398	96384	96384	she	52	" I am glad to hear it , Miss Helena . "
96399	96416	96438	96438	her	52	" May I count on your influence to help me ? I want a positive answer . "
96427	96431	96424	96424	I	0	" Certainly not . "
96459	96464	96465	96465	she	52	" Look at that , "
96500	96515	96516	96516	she	52	" Of course , I can depend on you to tell me the truth ? "
96519	96525	96516	96516	she	52	" Without fear or favor , "
96529	96536	96526	96526	I	0	" you may depend on that . "
96537	96574	96516	96516	she	52	" The signature to the letter , Mr. Governor , is written by my father . But the letter itself is in a different hand . Do you , by any chance , recognize the writing ? "
96575	96579	96526	96526	I	0	" I do . "
96580	96586	96526	96526	I	0	" Whose writing is it ? "
96587	96590	96516	96516	she	52	" Mine . "
96636	96645	96631	96631	She	52	" Allow me to return good for evil . "
96665	96708	96709	96709	I	0	" You are no doubt anxious to know if Philip 's father has been won over to serve your purpose . Here is Philip 's own account of it : the last of his letters that I shall trouble you to read . "
96765	96771	96774	96774	he	47	" Can you answer that ? "
96812	96820	96821	96822	the philosopher	2342	" I must spare my cramped hand , "
96825	96845	96846	96846	He	3972	" and I must answer Mr. Gracedieu 's letter . Write , and leave a place for my signature . "
96853	97001	96846	96846	He	3972	" Sir - My son Philip has seen your letter , and has no defense to make . In this respect he has set an example of candor which I propose to follow . There is no excuse for him . What I can do to show that I feel for you , and agree with you , shall be done . At the age which this young man has reached , the laws of England abolish the authority of his father . If he is sufficiently infatuated to place his honor and his happiness at the mercy of a lady , who has behaved to her sister as your daughter has behaved to Miss Eunice , I warn the married couple not to expect a farthing of my money , either during my lifetime or after my death . Your faithful servant , DUNBOYNE , SENIOR . "
97014	97024	97025	97026	his father	3972	" You may send my reply to the post , "
97029	97067	97025	97026	his father	3972	" and you may keep Mr. Gracedieu 's letter . Morally speaking , I regard that last document as a species of mirror , in which a young gentleman like yourself may see how ugly he looks . "
97336	97345	97346	97346	he	123	" What do I think of Mr. Gracedieu ? "
97357	97368	97346	97346	he	123	" Well , sir , I think badly of him . "
97409	97423	97424	97425	the doctor	162	" As to the causes which have produced this lamentable break - down , "
97428	97572	97424	97425	the doctor	162	" Mr. Gracedieu has been in the habit of preaching extempore twice a day on Sundays , and sometimes in the week as well - and has uniformly refused to spare himself when he was in most urgent need of rest . If you have ever attended his chapel , you have seen a man in a state of fiery enthusiasm , feeling intensely every word that he utters . Think of such exhaustion as that implies going on for years together , and accumulating its wasting influences on a sensitively organized constitution . Add that he is tormented by personal anxieties , which he confesses to no one , not even to his own children and the sum of it all is that a worse case of its kind , I am grieved to say , has never occurred in my experience . "
97626	97640	97641	97641	he	123	" You need feel no alarm about the health of that interesting girl , "
97644	97842	97641	97641	he	123	" When she complained to me - at her age ! - of not being able to sleep , I should have taken it more seriously if I had been told that she too had her troubles , poor little soul . Love - troubles , most likely - but do n't forget that my professional limits keep me in the dark ! Have you heard that she took some composing medicine , which I had prescribed for her father ? The effect certain , in any case , to be injurious to a young girl was considerably aggravated by the state of her mind at the time . A dream that frightened her , and something resembling delirium , seems to have followed . And she made matters worse , poor child , by writing in her diary about the visions and supernatural appearances that had terrified her . I was afraid of fever , on the day when they first sent for me . We escaped that complication , and I was at liberty to try the best of all remedies - quiet and change of air . I have no fears for Miss Eunice . "
98033	98049	98050	98050	he	123	" At the very time when it is most important to keep Mr. Gracedieu quiet , "
98168	98211	98154	98154	he	123	" Knowing perfectly well what had happened , and being one of those impatient people who can never endure suspense - I offered to go at once to Mr. Gracedieu 's room . The doctor asked leave to say one word more . "
98226	98231	98216	98216	you	0	" Mr. Wellwood resumed . "
98293	98308	98289	98289	your	0	" CHAPTER XLV . THE FATAL PORTRAIT . I knocked at the bedroom door . "
98313	98468	98289	98289	your	0	" Only two words - but the voice that uttered them , hoarse and peremptory , was altered almost beyond recognition . If I had not known whose room it was , I might have doubted whether the Minister had really spoken to me . At the instant when I answered him , I was allowed to pass in . Having admitted me , he closed the door , and placed himself with his back against it . The customary pallor of his face had darkened to a deep red ; there was an expression of ferocious mockery in his eyes . Helena 's vengeance had hurt her unhappy father far more severely than it seemed likely to hurt me . The doctor had said he was on the verge of madness . To my thinking , he had already passed the boundary line . He received me with a boisterous affectation of cordiality . "
98507	98520	98501	98501	I	0	" Remembering the doctor 's advice , I obeyed him in silence . "
98534	98538	98540	98540	you	2432	" he said , "
98602	98685	98595	98595	you	2432	" What his object might be in saying this - if , indeed , he had an object - it was impossible to guess . The doctor 's advice left me no alternative ; I hastened to own that he was right . As I made that answer , I observed that he held something in his hand which was half hidden up the sleeve of his dressing - gown . What the nature of the object was I failed to discover . "
98696	98701	98688	98688	I	0	" he went on , "
98734	98775	98731	98731	you	2432	" He surprised me ; but , however he had got his information , he had not been deceived . I told him that I was connected , through my mother , with the family to which he had alluded . "
98779	98783	98776	98777	The aristocracy	2438	" he repeated . "
98841	98857	98829	98829	you	2444	" It was really pitiable . Heartily sorry for him , I pacified him again . "
98880	98894	98872	98872	you	2444	" There was no help for it - I made another conciliatory reply . "
98898	98902	98872	98872	you	2444	" he resumed , "
98948	99014	99015	99019	A minister of the Gospel	2447	" To some extent at least , his thoughts betrayed themselves in his actions . He put the object that I had half seen in his hand into the pocket of his dressing - gown , and moved to the toilet - table . Opening one of the drawers , he took from it a folded sheet of paper , and came back to me . "
99021	99025	99027	99029	a sacred man	2448	" he said , "
99073	99099	99070	99070	me	0	" He led the way out . The doctor , waiting in the passage , was not near the stairs , and so escaped notice . "
99104	99118	99119	99119	He	2450	" Mr. Wellwood whispered . In the same guarded way , I said : "
99135	99233	99126	99126	I	0	" When we descended the stairs , the doctor followed us at a safe distance . He mended his pace when the Minister opened the door of the study , and when he saw us both pass in . Before he could follow , the door was closed and locked in his face . Mr. Gracedieu took out the key and threw it through the open window , into the garden below . Turning back into the room , he laid the folded sheet of paper on the table . That done , he spoke to me . "
99240	99244	99236	99236	my	0	" he said . "
99311	99337	99295	99298	a third person present	2453	" He pointed solemnly to the portrait of his wife . It was a small picture , very simply framed ; representing the face in a "
99341	99466	99295	99298	a third person present	2453	" view , and part of the figure only . As a work of art it was contemptible ; but , as a likeness , it answered its purpose . My unhappy friend stood before it , in an attitude of dejection , covering his face with his hands . In the interval of silence that followed , I was reminded that an unseen friend was keeping watch outside . Alarmed by having heard the key turned in the lock , and realizing the embarrassment of the position in which I was placed , the doctor had discovered a discreet way of communicating with me . He slipped one of his visiting - cards under the door , with these words written on it : "
99473	99492	99493	99493	He	0	" I took the pencil from my pocketbook , and wrote on the blank side of the card : "
99509	99634	99493	99493	He	0	" A glance at the Minister , before I returned my reply , showed that his attitude was unchanged . Without being seen or suspected , I , in my turn , slipped the card under the door . The slow minutes followed each other - and still nothing happened . My anxiety to see how the doctor 's search for the key was succeeding , tempted me to approach the window . On my way to it , the tail of my coat threw down a little tray containing pens and pencils , which had been left close to the edge of the table . Slight as the noise of the fall was , it disturbed Mr. Gracedieu . He looked round vacantly . "
99642	99647	99635	99635	I	0	" he told me . "
99660	99669	99657	99658	the Lord	2457	" He pointed to the portrait once more : "
99690	99727	99728	99728	You	2458	" I removed the picture and placed it , by his directions , on a chair that stood midway between us . To my surprise his tones faltered ; I saw tears rising in his eyes . "
99737	99741	99731	99731	you	2458	" he said . "
99763	99800	99758	99759	my wife	446	" We stood together , with our eyes fixed on the portrait . Without anything said or done on my part to irritate him , he suddenly turned to me in a state of furious rage . "
99807	99812	99758	99759	my wife	446	" he burst out . "
99835	99880	99829	99829	I	0	" A first discovery of the odious suspicion of which I was the object , dawned on my mind at that moment . My capacity for restraining myself completely failed me . I spoke to him as if he had been an accountable being . "
99885	99889	99829	99829	I	0	" I said , "
99910	99927	99900	99900	You	2461	" Instead of directly replying , he seized my arm and led me to the table . "
99933	99937	99900	99900	You	2461	" he said . "
99962	100103	99958	99958	you	2461	" Was there a weapon concealed in the room ? or had he got it in the pocket of his dressing - gown ? I listened for the sound of the doctor 's returning footsteps in the passage outside , and heard nothing . My life had once depended , years since , on my success in heading the arrest of an escaped prisoner . I was not conscious , then , of feeling my energies weakened by fear . But that man was not mad ; and I was younger , in those days , by a good twenty years or more . At my later time of life , I could show my old friend that I was not afraid of him - but I was conscious of an effort in doing it . I opened the paper . "
100112	100116	100110	100110	myself	0	" I asked . "
100125	100126	100119	100119	I	0	" "
100131	100141	100119	100119	I	0	" In these terms , his daughter addressed him : "
100185	100231	100234	100234	me	0	" Grieved as I am to distress you , in your present state of health , I must not hesitate to reveal what it has been my misfortune - I may even say my misery , when I think of my mother - to discover . "
100253	100357	100248	100248	I	0	" In those happy past days , when I was still dear to my father , you said you thought of writing to invite a dearly - valued friend to pay a visit to this house . You had first known him , as I understood , when my mother was still living . Many interesting things you told me about this old friend , but you never mentioned that he knew , or that he had even seen , my mother . I was left to suppose that those two had remained strangers to each other to the day of her death . "
100404	100410	100393	100393	me	0	" Mr. Gracedieu interrupted me . "
100415	100419	100420	100420	I	0	" he cried ; "
100459	100477	100479	100479	her	2466	" I gave him the paper . He hesitated - and looked at the portrait once more . "
100484	100488	100489	100489	I	0	" he said ; "
100496	100599	100600	100600	Helena	52	" I placed the picture with its back to him . He consulted the paper , reading it with but little of the confusion and hesitation which my experience of him had induced me to anticipate . Had the mad excitement that possessed him exercised an influence in clearing his mind , resembling in some degree the influence exercised by a storm in clearing the air ? Whatever the right explanation may be , I can only report what I saw . I could hardly have mastered what his daughter had written more readily , if I had been reading it myself . "
100604	100608	100610	100610	you	0	" he began , "
100626	100627	100610	100610	you	0	" "
100631	100632	100610	100610	you	0	" "
100666	100667	100668	100668	I	0	" "
100671	100678	100679	100680	My daughter	249	" He consulted the paper again . "
100707	100708	100697	100697	she	52	" "
100731	100732	100721	100721	I	0	" "
100752	100760	100746	100746	you	0	" He referred to the paper again . "
100777	100816	100818	100818	you	0	" The evidence which was intended to convict me was the evidence which I was expected to find ! I pointed it out to him . His natural courtesy asserted itself in spite of his anger . He said "
100820	100832	100818	100818	you	0	" and questioned me the moment after as fiercely as ever . "
100858	100859	100852	100852	you	0	" "
100863	100864	100852	100852	you	0	" "
100921	100985	100912	100912	You	0	" I made another effort to defend myself . He again refused furiously to hear me . It was useless to persist . Whatever the danger that threatened me might be , the sooner it showed itself the easier I should feel . I told him that Mrs. Gracedieu had called on me , after he and his wife had left the town . "
100993	100997	100987	100987	you	0	" he cried , "
101004	101005	101006	101006	I	0	" "
101009	101033	101006	101006	I	0	" After that answer , he no longer required the paper to help him . He threw it from him on the floor . "
101039	101043	101035	101035	you	0	" he said , "
101075	101128	101064	101064	her	52	" When his mad suspicion that I had been his wife 's lover betrayed itself in this way , I made a last attempt , in the face of my own conviction that it was hopeless , to place my conduct and his wife 's conduct before him in the true light . "
101138	101162	101129	101130	Mrs. Gracedieu	98	" Before I could say the next words , I saw him put his hand into the pocket of his dressing - gown . "
101167	101172	101163	101165	An innocent man	2481	" he sternly declared , "
101230	101231	101220	101220	she	2484	" "
101246	101367	101370	101370	them	2487	" He drew from his pocket the thing that he had hidden from me . This time , there was no concealment ; he let me see that he was opening a razor . It was no time for asserting my innocence ; I had to think of preserving my life . When a man is without firearms , what defense can avail against a razor in the hands of a madman ? A chair was at my side ; it offered the one poor means of guarding myself that I could see . I laid my hand on it , and kept my eye on him . He paused , looking backward and forward between the picture and me . "
101376	101382	101370	101370	them	2487	" he said to himself . "
101404	101425	101426	101427	The woman	179	" He stopped once more , in a state of fierce self - concentration , debating what he should do . "
101429	101433	101426	101427	The woman	179	" he decided . "
101447	101497	101438	101438	Harlot	125	" With a yell of fury , he pounced on the picture - ripped the canvas out of the frame - and cut it malignantly into fragments . As they dropped from the razor on the floor , he stamped on them , and ground them under his foot . "
101505	101518	101500	101503	wife of my bosom	2494	" he cried , with a dreadful mockery of voice and look - "
101530	101537	101438	101438	Harlot	125	" His eyes glared at me . "
101542	102013	101538	101538	Your	2495	" he said - and rushed at me with his weapon ready in his hand . I hurled the chair at his right arm . The razor dropped on the floor . I caught him by the wrist . Like a wild animal he tried to bite me . With my free hand - if I had known how to defend myself in any other way , I would have taken that way - with my free hand I seized him by the throat ; forced him back ; and held him against the wall . My grasp on his throat kept him quiet . But the dread of seriously injuring him so completely overcame me , that I forgot I was a prisoner in the room , and was on the point of alarming the household by a cry for help . I was still struggling to preserve my self - control , when the sound of footsteps broke the silence outside . I heard the key turn in the lock , and saw the doctor at the open door . CHAPTER XLVI . THE CUMBERSOME LADIES . I can not prevail upon myself to dwell at any length on the events that followed . We secured my unhappy friend , and carried him to his bed . It was necessary to have men in attendance who could perform the duty of watching him . The doctor sent for them , while I went downstairs to make the best I could of the miserable news which it was impossible entirely to conceal . All that I could do to spare Miss Jillgall , I did . I was obliged to acknowledge that there had been an outbreak of violence , and that the portrait of the Minister 's wife had been destroyed by the Minister himself . Of Helena 's revenge on me I said nothing . It had led to consequences which even her merciless malice could not have contemplated . There were no obstacles in the way of keeping secret the attempt on my life . But I was compelled to own that Mr. Gracedieu had taken a dislike to me , which rendered it necessary that my visit should be brought to an end . I hastened to add that I should go to the hotel , and should wait there until the next day , in the hope of hearing better news . Of the multitude of questions with which poor Miss Jillgall overwhelmed me - of the wild words of sorrow and alarm that escaped her - of the desperate manner in which she held by my arm , and implored me not to go away , when I must see for myself that ' she was a person entirely destitute of presence of mind "
102357	102378	102379	102379	she	3971	" I do n't wish to speak of what happened yesterday , so far as I know anything about it , "
102382	102425	102379	102379	she	3971	" It is quite enough for me that you have been obliged to leave the house and to take refuge in this hotel . I have come to say a word about the future . Are you honoring me with your attention ? "
102451	102455	102456	102456	she	3971	" At first , "
102459	102571	102456	102456	she	3971	" I thought of writing ; but it occurred to me that you might keep my letter , and show it to Philip , by way of lowering me in his good opinion , as you have lowered me in the good opinion of his father . My object in coming here is to give you a word of warning . If you attempt to make mischief next between Philip and myself , I shall hear of it - and you know what to expect , when you have me for an enemy . It is not worth while to say any more . We understand each other , I hope ? "
102585	102590	102591	102591	I	0	" Not quite yet , "
102594	102647	102591	102591	I	0	" I have been hitherto , as becomes a gentleman , always mindful of a woman 's claims to forbearance . You will do well not to tempt me into forgetting that you are a woman , by prolonging your visit . Now , Miss Helena Gracedieu , we understand each other . "
102664	102676	102648	102648	She	2511	" I only desire to wish you a pleasant journey home . "
102683	102689	102690	102690	I	0	" Show this lady out , "
103020	103028	103029	103030	Miss Jillgall	66	" Do pray come back with us , "
103033	103046	103048	103048	she	1748	" We were just talking of you . I and my friend - "
103090	103094	103095	103095	she	3781	" My dear , "
103101	103146	103147	103147	She	3781	" caution ceases to be a virtue when it ceases to be of any use . The Governor is beginning to remember me , and the inevitable recognition - with his quickness of perception - is likely to be a matter of minutes now . "
103152	103246	103147	103147	She	3781	" In more ways than one , sir , women are hardly used by Nature . As they advance in years they lose more in personal appearance than the men do . You are white - haired , and pray excuse me you are too fat ; and allow me to take another liberty you stoop at the shoulders - but you have not entirely lost your good looks . I am no longer recognizable . Allow me to prompt you , as they say on the stage . I am Mrs. Tenbruggen . "
103388	103394	103395	103395	she	2536	" Where are you going ? "
103415	103422	103423	103424	Miss Jillgall	66	" To see my dear Euneece ? "
103428	103437	103423	103424	Miss Jillgall	66	" Oh , we will go with you ! "
103445	103451	103438	103439	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" With the greatest pleasure . "
103547	103556	103557	103557	she	66	" Nothing could be more agreeable to me , "
103560	103571	103572	103572	She	66	" I have been a wonderful walker all my life . "
103578	103592	103572	103572	She	66	" We will go with him , my dear , wo n't we ? "
103615	103619	103620	103620	she	66	" Five miles ! "
103623	103667	103668	103668	she	66	" And five miles back again , unless the farmer lends us a cart . My dear Selina , you might as well ask me to walk to the North Pole . You have got rid of one of us , Mr. Governor , "
103673	103713	103668	103668	she	66	" and the other , if you only walk fast enough , you will leave behind you on the road . If I believed in luck - which I do n't - I should call you a fortunate man . "
104043	104052	104053	104053	she	66	" Why did n't he destroy something else ? "
104058	104129	104053	104053	she	66	" It is such a disappointment to Me . I never liked that picture myself . Of course I ought to have admired the portrait of the wife of my benefactor . But no - that disagreeable painted face was too much for me . I should have felt inexpressibly relieved , if I could have shown it to Elizabeth , and heard her say that she agreed with me . "
104130	104141	104142	104143	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" Perhaps I saw it when I called on you , "
104146	104153	104142	104143	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" Where did the picture hang ? "
104154	104177	104179	104179	they	2563	" My dear ! I received you in the dining - room , and the portrait hung in Mr. Gracedieu 's study . "
104328	104331	104301	104302	Mrs. Gracedieu	98	" Miss Chance "
104439	104451	104419	104420	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" Mr. Governor , do you ever condescend to read novels ? "
104452	104473	104419	104420	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" It 's not easy to say , Mrs. Tenbruggen , how grateful I am to the writers of novels . "
104474	104609	104419	104420	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" Ah ! I read novels , too . But I blush to confess - do I blush ? - that I never thought of feeling grateful till you mentioned it . Selina and I do n't complain of your preferring your own reflections to our company . On the contrary , you have reminded us agreeably of the heroes of fiction , when the author describes them as being ' absorbed in thought . ' For some minutes , Mr. Governor , you have been a hero ; absorbed , as I venture to guess , in unpleasant remembrances of the time when I was a single lady . You have not forgotten how badly I behaved , and what shocking things I said , in those bygone days . Am I right ? "
104610	104616	104419	104420	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" You are entirely wrong . "
104639	104657	104632	104633	faithful Selina	96	" Oh , dear sir , do n't be hard on Elizabeth ! She always means well . "
104743	104750	104736	104736	her	66	" Is n't she good company ? "
104772	104780	104781	104781	she	49	" Perhaps I have improved a little , "
104784	104977	104781	104781	she	49	" as I have advanced in years . The sorrows of an unhappy married life may have had a purifying influence on my nature . My husband and I began badly . Mr. Tenbruggen thought I had money ; and I thought Mr. Tenbruggen had money . He was taken in by me ; and I was taken in by him . When he repeated the words of the marriage service most impressively read by your friend the Chaplain : ' With all my worldly goods I thee endow ' - his eloquent voice suggested one of the largest incomes in Europe . When I promised and vowed , in my turn , the delightful prospect of squandering my rich husband 's money made quite a new woman of me . I declare solemnly , when I said I would love , honor , and obey Mr. T. , I looked as if I really meant it . Wherever he is now , poor dear , he is cheating somebody . Such a handsome , gentleman - like man , Selina ! And , oh , Mr. Governor , such a blackguard ! "
105014	105030	105031	105031	she	2579	" Ah , what a delicious breeze is blowing , out here in the country ! "
105034	105053	105031	105031	she	2579	" Will you excuse me if I take off my gloves ? I want to air my hands . "
105071	105077	105078	105078	she	2579	" In my professional occupation , "
105081	105173	105174	105174	She	2579	" I am always rubbing , tickling , squeezing , tapping , kneading , rolling , striking the muscles of patients . Selina , do you know the movements of your own joints ? Flexion , extension , abduction , adduction , rotation , circumduction , pronation , supination , and the lateral movements . Be proud of those accomplishments , my dear , but beware of attempting to become a Masseuse . There are drawbacks in that vocation - and I am conscious of one of them at this moment . "
105182	105208	105174	105174	She	2579	" Pah ! my hands smell of other people 's flesh . The delicious country air will blow it away - the luxury of purification ! "
105373	105380	105381	105381	I	0	" Is it indiscreet to ask , "
105384	105394	105381	105381	I	0	" if you are here in your professional capacity ? "
105408	105420	105395	105395	Her	2579	" Do you wish to be one of my patients yourself ? "
105421	105429	105430	105430	I	0	" That is , unfortunately , impossible , "
105432	105441	105395	105395	Her	2579	" I have arranged to return to London . "
105442	105445	105395	105395	Her	2579	" Immediately ? "
105446	105454	105457	105457	she	2579	" To - morrow at the latest . "
105507	105516	105517	105517	she	2579	" But I have not yet answered you , "
105520	105732	105517	105517	she	2579	" To tell the truth , I am eager to try my hands on you . Massage , as I practice it , would lighten your weight , and restore your figure ; I may even say would lengthen your life . You will think of me , one of these days , wo n't you ? In the meanwhile - yes ! I am here in my professional capacity . Several interesting cases ; and one very remarkable person , brought to death 's door by the doctors ; a rich man who is liberal in paying his fees . There is my quarrel with London and Londoners . Some of their papers , medical newspapers , of course , declare that my fees are exorbitant ; and there is a tendency among the patients - I mean the patients who are rolling in riches - to follow the lead of the newspapers . I am no worm to be trodden on , in that way . The London people shall wait for me , until they miss me - and , when I do go back , they will find the fees increased . My fingers and thumbs , Mr. Governor , are not to be insulted with impunity . "
105747	105753	105736	105736	her	66	" Admire my spirited friend , "
105808	105823	105824	105824	I	0	" Speaking of Mr. Gracedieu , and of the chances of his partial recovery , "
105827	105838	105824	105824	I	0	" do you think the Minister would benefit by Massage ? "
105839	105857	105772	105773	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" I have n't a doubt of it , if you can get rid of the doctor . "
105858	105870	105824	105824	I	0	" You think he would be an obstacle in the way ? "
105871	105894	105895	105896	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" There are some medical men who are honorable exceptions to the general rule ; and he may be one of them , "
105899	105929	105895	105896	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" Do n't be too hopeful . As a doctor , he belongs to the most tyrannical trades - union in existence . May I make a personal remark ? "
105930	105933	105824	105824	I	0	" Certainly . "
105934	105963	105824	105824	I	0	" I find something in your manner - pray do n't suppose that I am angry - which looks like distrust ; I mean , distrust of me . "
105975	106064	105964	105965	Miss Jillgall	66	" Oh , no , Elizabeth ! You are not often mistaken ; but indeed you are wrong now . Look at my distinguished friend . I remember my copy book , when I was a small creature learning to write , in England . There were first lines that we copied , in big letters , and one of them said , ' Distrust Is Mean . ' I know a young person , whose name begins with H , who is one mass of meanness . But "
106080	106085	106067	106067	Selina	96	" no meanness there ! "
106108	106115	106116	106116	I	0	" You are not altogether mistaken , "
106120	106143	106116	106116	I	0	" I ca n't say that my mind is in a state of distrust , but I own that you puzzle me . "
106144	106151	106086	106087	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" How , if you please ? "
106152	106225	106227	106227	she	2589	" May I presume that you remember the occasion when we met at Mr. Gracedieu 's house - door ? You saw that I failed to recognize you , and you refused to give your name when the servant asked for it . A few days afterward , I heard you quite accidentally forbid Miss Jillgall to mention your name in my hearing . I am at a loss to understand it . "
106259	106266	106267	106267	she	49	" If it escapes my memory , "
106270	106277	106267	106267	she	49	" pray remind me of it . "
106398	106430	106387	106387	I	0	" Darling Euneece , you remember Mrs. Tenbruggen 's name , I am sure ? Elizabeth , this is my sweet girl ; I mentioned her in my letters to you . "
106431	106491	106492	106492	She	2597	" I hope she will be my sweet girl , when we know each other a little better . May I kiss you , dear ? You have lovely eyes ; but I am sorry to see that they do n't look like happy eyes . You want Mamma Tenbruggen to cheer you . What a charming old house ! "
106566	106581	106582	106582	she	2597	" I 'm sure , ma'am , you must have children of your own , "
106626	106633	106634	106634	somebody	983	" What wonderful self - possession ! "
106802	106811	106812	106812	she	49	" Is that lady a friend of yours ? "
106815	106829	106812	106812	she	49	" No ; only an acquaintance . What do you think of her ? "
106830	106987	106812	106812	she	49	" I thought I should like her at first ; she was so kind , and seemed to take such an interest in me . But she said such strange things - asked if I was reckoned like my mother , and which of us was the eldest , my sister or myself , and whether we were my father 's only two children , and if one of us was more his favorite than the other . What I could tell her , I did tell . But when I said I did n't know which of us was the oldest , she gave me an impudent tap on the cheek , and said , ' I do n't believe you , child , ' and left me . How can Selina be so fond of her ? Do n't mention it to any one else ; I hope I shall never see her again . "
106988	107009	107061	107062	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" I will keep your secret , Eunice ; and you must keep mine . I entirely agree with you . "
107010	107019	106812	106812	she	49	" You agree with me in disliking her ? "
107020	107023	107024	107024	We	2617	" Heartily . "
108113	108119	108120	108120	I	0	" You told me yesterday , "
108124	108144	108120	108120	I	0	" that I was to say you had forgiven him . Do you still wish me to do that ? "
108145	108150	108122	108122	her	53	" Indeed I do ! "
108151	108178	108120	108120	I	0	" Have you thought of it seriously ? Are you sure of not having been hurried by a generous impulse into saying more than you mean ? "
108179	108187	108188	108188	she	53	" I have been thinking of it , "
108191	108283	108188	108188	she	53	" through the wakeful hours of last night - and many things are plain to me , which I was not sure of in the time when I was so happy . He has caused me the bitterest sorrow of my life , but he ca n't undo the good that I owe to him . He has made a better girl of me , in the time when his love was mine . I do n't forget that . Miserably as it has ended , I do n't forget that . "
108314	108317	108318	108318	she	53	" No , "
108322	108338	108318	108318	she	53	" I am not going to cry . Do n't look so sorry for me . "
108397	108416	108380	108380	She	53	" When you meet with him in London , he may perhaps ask if you have seen Eunice . "
108417	108427	108368	108368	God	38	" My child ! he is sure to ask . "
108428	108456	108457	108457	I	0	" Break it to him gently - but do n't let him deceive himself . In this world , he must never hope to see me again . "
108466	108476	108477	108477	I	0	" At your age , and at his age , "
108486	108487	108477	108477	I	0	" "
108493	108502	108503	108503	I	0	" She pressed her hand on her heart . "
108513	108514	108507	108507	I	0	" "

108552	108640	108542	108542	I	0	" CHAPTER XLIX . THE GOVERNOR ON HIS GUARD . After leaving Eunice , my one desire was to be alone . I had much to think of , and I wanted an opportunity of recovering myself . On my way out of the house , in search of the first solitary place that I could discover , I passed the room in which we had dined . The door was ajar . Before I could get by it , Mrs. Tenbruggen stepped out and stopped me . "
108650	108654	108642	108642	you	2672	" she said . "
108670	108690	108663	108663	I	0	" Very unwillingly - but how could I have refused without giving offense ? - I entered the room . "
108701	108706	108692	108692	you	2672	" Mrs. Tenbruggen began , "
108775	108803	108804	108804	Selina	96	" I had purposely remained standing as a hint to her not to prolong the interview . The hint was thrown away ; I took a chair . "
108811	108815	108804	108804	Selina	96	" she resumed , "
108917	108970	108971	108971	I	0	" I began to be interested . Here was an opportunity , perhaps , of discovering what the Minister had failed to remember when he had been speaking of this woman , and when I had asked if he had ever offended her . I was especially careful in making my inquiries . "
108980	108984	108974	108974	you	0	" I said , "
109022	109023	109000	109000	you	0	" "
109140	109153	109132	109133	the Minister	161	" She paused , and finished the sentence by a significant gesture . "
109156	109160	109132	109133	the Minister	161	" I said , "
109168	109169	109161	109161	he	161	" "
109176	109180	109161	109161	he	161	" she added . "
109277	109362	109265	109265	I	0	" It was plain enough , of course . If I had known her again , or had heard her name , I might have told the Minister that Mrs. Tenbruggen and Miss Chance were one and the same . And if I had seen her and talked with her in the house , my memory might have shown itself capable of improvement . Having politely presented the expression of my thanks , I rose to go . She stopped me at the door . "
109367	109371	109265	109265	I	0	" she said , "
109427	109428	109424	109424	our	2700	" "
109432	109436	109424	109424	our	2700	" I asked . "
109442	109443	109424	109424	our	2700	" "
109449	109450	109444	109444	I	0	" "
109585	109586	109587	109587	You	2696	" "
109592	109596	109587	109587	You	2696	" I answered , "
109626	109627	109618	109619	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" "
109632	109636	109637	109637	you	2696	" she rejoined , "
109657	110000	110001	110001	Helena	52	" ....... In the evening , my hotel offered to me the refuge of which I stood in need . I could think , for the first time that day , without interruption . Being resolved to see Philip , I prepared myself for the interview by consulting my extracts once more . The letter , in which Mrs. Tenbruggen figures , inspired me with the hope of protection for Mr. Gracedieu , attainable through no less a person than Helena herself . To begin with , she would certainly share Philip 's aversion to the Masseuse , and her dislike of Miss Jillgall would , just as possibly , extend to Miss Jillgall 's friend . The hostile feeling thus set up might be trusted to keep watch on Mrs. Tenbruggen 's proceedings , with a vigilance not attainable by the coarser observation of a man . In the event , of an improvement in the Minister 's health , I should hear of it both from the doctor and from Miss Jillgall , and in that case I should instantly return to my unhappy friend and put him on his guard . I started for London by the early train in the morning . My way home from the terminus took me past the hotel at which the elder Mr. Dunboyne was staying . I called on him . He was reported to be engaged ; that is to say , immersed in his books . The address on one of Philip 's letters had informed me that he was staying at another hotel . Pursuing my inquiries in this direction , I met with a severe disappointment . Mr. Philip Dunboyne had left the hotel that morning ; for what destination neither the landlord nor the waiter could tell me . The next day 's post brought with it the information which I had failed to obtain . Miss Jillgall wrote , informing me in her strongest language that Philip Dunboyne had returned to Helena . Indignant Selina added : "
110023	110098	110099	110099	Philip	47	" In taking leave of Eunice , I had given her my address ; had warned her to be careful , if she and Mrs. Tenbruggen happened to meet again , and had begged her to write to me , or to come to me , if anything happened to alarm her in my absence . In two days more , I received a line from Eunice , written evidently in the greatest agitation . "
110136	110196	110197	110197	You	2718	" CHAPTER L. THE NEWS FROM THE FARM . When I next heard from Miss Jillgall , the introductory part of her letter merely reminded me that Philip Dunboyne was established in the town , and that Helena was in daily communication with him . I shall do Selina no injustice if my extract begins with her second page . "
110204	110208	110201	110201	I	0	" she writes , "
110420	110514	110410	110410	You	2722	" I am ashamed to mention the poor dear Minister in a postscript . The truth is , I do n't very well know what I am about . Mr. Gracedieu is quiet , sleeps better than he did , eats with a keener appetite , gives no trouble . But , alas , that glorious intellect is in a state of eclipse ! Do not suppose , because I write figuratively , that I am not sorry for him . He understands nothing ; he remembers nothing ; he has my prayers . "
110599	110690	110588	110588	I	0	" In any other affair excuse me for troubling you with a second postscript , my sympathy with Euneece would have penetrated her motives ; I should have felt with her feelings . But I have never been in love ; no gentleman gave me the opportunity when I was young . Now I am middle - aged , neglect has done its dreary work - my heart is an extinct crater . Figurative again ! I had better put my pen away , and say farewell for the present . "
110772	110952	110767	110767	Eunice	53	" I get news - and what heartbreaking news ! - of my father , by sending a messenger to Selina . It is more than ever impossible that I can put myself in the way of seeing Helena again . She has written to me about Philip , in a tone so shockingly insolent and cruel , that I have destroyed her letter . Philip 's visit to the farm , discovered I do n't know how , seems to have infuriated her . She accuses me of doing all that she might herself have done in my place , and threatens me - No ! I am afraid of the wicked whisperings of that second self of mine if I think of it . They were near to tempting me when I read Helena 's letter . But I thought of what you said , after I had shown you my Journal ; and your words took my memory back to the days when I was happy with Philip . The trial and the terror passed away . "
111062	111190	111057	111057	you	2736	" The farmer 's wife - dear good soul ! - hardly understands me so well as her husband does . She confesses to pitying Philip . ' He is so wretched , ' she says . ' And , dear heart , how handsome , and what nice , winning manners ! I do n't think I should have had your courage , in your place . To tell the truth , I should have jumped for joy when I saw him at the door ; and I should have run down to let him in - and perhaps been sorry for it afterward . If you really wish to forget him , my dear , I will do all I can to help you . ' "
111216	111323	111210	111210	I	0	" I have so much to be thankful for , and the children are so fond of me . Whether I teach them as well as I might have done , if I had been a more learned girl , may perhaps be doubtful . They do more for their governess , I am afraid , than their governess does for them . When they come into my room in the morning , and rouse me with their kisses , the hour of waking , which used to be so hard to endure after Philip left me , is now the happiest hour of my day . "
111564	111572	111573	111573	Selina	96	" Things are sadly changed for the worse "
111576	111754	111573	111573	Selina	96	" but I do n't forget that Philip was once engaged to Euneece , and that Mr. Gracedieu 's extraordinary conduct toward him puzzled us all . The mode of discovery which dear Elizabeth suggested by letter , at that time , appears to be the mode which she is following now . When I asked why , she said : ' Philip may return to Euneece ; the Minister may recover - and will be all the more likely to do so if he tries Massage . In that case , he will probably repeat the conduct which surprised you ; and your natural curiosity will ask me again to find out what it means . Am I your friend , Selina , or am I not ? ' This was so delightfully kind , and so irresistibly conclusive , that I kissed her in a transport of gratitude . With what breathless interest I have watched her progress toward penetrating the mystery of the girls ' ages , it is quite needless to tell you . "
111934	111995	111926	111926	her	66	" Always desirous of making myself useful , I thought I would give my dear Elizabeth a hint which might save time and trouble . ' Why not begin , ' I suggested , ' by asking the Governor to help you ? ' That wonderful woman never forgets anything . She had already applied to you , without success . "
112118	112175	112108	112113	the most deceitful girl in existence	2761	" When we were alone again , Elizabeth made a remark : ' If personal appearance could decide the question , ' she said , ' the disagreeable young woman is the oldest of the two . The next thing to be done is to discover if looks are to be trusted in this case . ' "
112235	112431	112432	112433	My friend	3475	" The report arrived this morning . I was only informed that the result , in one case , had entirely defeated the inquiries . In the other case , Elizabeth had helped her agent by referring him to a Birth , advertised in the customary columns of the Times newspaper . Even here , there was a fatal obstacle . The name of the place in which Mr. Gracedieu 's daughter had been born was not added , as usual . I still tried to be useful . Had my friend known the Minister 's wife ? My friend had never even seen the Minister 's wife . And , as if by a fatality , her portrait was no longer in existence . I could only mention that Helena was like her mother . But Elizabeth seemed to attach very little importance to my evidence , if I may call it by so grand a name . ' People have such strange ideas about likenesses , ' she said , ' and arrive at such contradictory conclusions . One can only trust one 's own eyes in a matter of that kind . ' "
112507	112518	112519	112519	She	174	" I asked Elizabeth what she proposed to do next . "
112571	112622	112561	112561	she	41	" I said : ' Surely , you have forgotten the sad state of his mind ? ' No ; she knew perfectly well that he was imbecile . ' I want to try , ' she explained , ' if I can rouse him for a few minutes . ' "
112631	112705	112628	112628	I	0	" She burst out laughing . ' Massage , my dear , does n't act in that way . It is an elaborate process , pursued patiently for weeks together . But my hands have more than one accomplishment at their finger - ends . Oh , make your mind easy ! I shall do no harm , if I do no good . Take me , Selina , to the Minister . ' "
112733	112856	112857	112857	Elizabeth	41	" It was a sad sight when we went in . He was quite happy , playing like a child , at cup - and - ball . The attendant retired at my request . I introduced Mrs. Tenbruggen . He smiled and shook hands with her . He said : ' Are you a Christian or a Pagan ? You are very pretty . How many times can you catch the ball in the cup ? ' The effort to talk to her ended there . He went on with his game , and seemed to forget that there was anybody in the room . It made my heart ache to remember what he was - and to see him now . "
112868	112884	112885	112885	Elizabeth	41	" I do n't know why I did such a rude thing - I hesitated . "
112907	113016	113021	113021	I	0	" A long half - hour passed . Feeling a little uneasy , I went upstairs again and looked into the room . He was leaning back in his chair ; his plaything was on the floor , and he was looking vacantly at the light that came in through the window . I found Mrs. Tenbruggen at the other end of the room , in the act of ringing the bell . Nothing in the least out of the ordinary way seemed to have happened . When the attendant had answered the bell , we left the room together . Mr. Gracedieu took no notice of us . "
113031	113045	113021	113021	I	0	" Quite calmly my noble Elizabeth answered : ' In total failure . ' "
113060	113086	113049	113049	you	0	" ' I tried , in every possible way , to get him to tell me which of his two daughters was the oldest . ' "
113095	113187	113049	113049	you	0	" ' He was only too ready to answer . First , he said Helena was the oldest - then he corrected himself , and declared that Eunice was the oldest - then he said they were twins - then he went back to Helena and Eunice . Now one was the oldest , and now the other . He rang the changes on those two names , I ca n't tell you how often , and seemed to think it a better game than cup - and - ball . ' "
113196	113207	113049	113049	you	0	" ' Nothing is to be done , Selina . ' "
113222	113324	113212	113212	I	0	" My heroic friend answered : ' I know when I am beaten , my dear - I give it up . ' She looked at her watch ; it was time to operate on the muscles of one of her patients . Away she went , on her glorious mission of Massage , without a murmur of regret . What strength of mind ! But , oh , dear , what a disappointment for poor little me ! On one thing I am determined . If I find myself getting puzzled or frightened , I shall instantly write to you . "
113454	113466	113467	113467	she	2788	" I thought I might have got at what I wanted , "
113471	113522	113467	113467	she	2788	" by mesmerizing our reverend friend . He is as weak as a woman ; I threw him into hysterics , and had to give it up , and quiet him , or he would have alarmed the house . You look as if you do n't believe in mesmerism . "
113523	113540	113627	113627	her	2789	" My looks , Mrs. Tenbruggen , exactly express my opinion . Mesmerism is a humbug ! "
113541	113594	113627	113627	her	2789	" You amusing old Tory ! Shall I throw you into a state of trance ? No ! I 'll give you a shock of another kind - a shock of surprise . I know as much as you do about Mr. Gracedieu 's daughters . What do you think of that ? "
113595	113613	113627	113627	her	2789	" I think I should like to hear you tell me , which is the adopted child . "
113614	113621	113622	113622	Her	2789	" Helena , to be sure ! "
113698	113707	113708	113708	I	0	" How did you arrive at your discovery ? "
113711	113722	113708	113708	I	0	" I know of nobody who could have helped you . "
113723	113757	113758	113758	My	0	" I helped myself , sir ! I reasoned it out . A wonderful thing for a woman to do , is n't it ? I wonder whether you could follow the process ? "
113813	113819	113820	113820	she	49	" In the first place , "
113823	114004	113820	113820	she	49	" Helena is plainly the wicked one of the two . I was not prejudiced by what Selina had told me of her : I saw it , and felt it , before I had been five minutes in her company . If lying tongues ever provoke her as lying tongues provoked her mother , she will follow her mother 's example . Very well . Now - in the second place - though it is very slight , there is a certain something in her hair and her complexion which reminds me of the murderess : there is no other resemblance , I admit . In the third place , the girls ' names point to the same conclusion . Mr. Gracedieu is a Protestant and a Dissenter . Would he call a child of his own by the name of a Roman Catholic saint ? No ! he would prefer a name in the Bible ; Eunice is his child . And Helena was once the baby whom I carried into the prison . Do you deny that ? "
114005	114012	113820	113820	she	49	" I do n't deny it . "
114114	114130	114131	114131	she	49	" I have taken some trouble in finding the clew to the Minister 's mystery , "
114134	114141	114131	114131	she	49	" Do n't you wonder why ? "
114142	114148	114149	114149	I	0	" If I did wonder , "
114152	114159	114149	114149	I	0	" would you tell me why ? "
114169	114173	114174	114174	she	49	" Another lesson , "
114177	114218	114174	114174	she	49	" to assist a helpless man in studying the weaker sex . I have already shown you that a woman can reason . Learn next that a woman can keep a secret . Good - by . God bless you ! "
114555	114561	114562	114562	I	0	" Really , Mrs. Tenbruggen , "
114565	114621	114562	114562	I	0	" I must request Miss Jillgall to moderate her selfish enjoyment of your company , for your own sake . Your time is too valuable , in a professional sense , to be wasted on an idle woman who has no sympathy with your patients , waiting for relief perhaps , and waiting in vain . "
114634	114656	114622	114622	She	1894	" My dear , do you know how I might answer you , if I was an ill - natured woman ? "
114657	114669	114562	114562	I	0	" I have no curiosity to hear it , Mrs. Tenbruggen . "
114670	114676	114677	114677	she	1894	" I might ask you , "
114680	114723	114677	114677	she	1894	" to allow me to mind my own business . But I am incapable of making an ungrateful return for the interest which you take in my medical welfare . Let me venture to ask if you understand the value of time . "
114724	114736	114562	114562	I	0	" Are you going to say much more , Mrs. Tenbruggen ? "
114737	114896	114562	114562	I	0	" I am going to make a sensible remark , my child . If you feel tired , permit me - here is a chair . Father Time , dear Miss Gracedieu , has always been a good friend of mine , because I know how to make the best use of him . The author of the famous saying Tempus fugit you understand Latin , of course was , I take leave to think , an idle man . The more I have to do , the readier Time is to wait for me . Let me impress this on your mind by some interesting examples . The greatest conqueror of the century - Napoleon - had time enough for everything . The greatest novelist of the century - Sir Walter Scott - had time enough for everything . At my humble distance , I imitate those illustrious men , and my patients never complain of me . "
114897	114902	114903	114903	I	0	" Have you done ? "
114906	114915	114903	114903	I	0	" Yes , dear - for the present . "
114916	114962	114963	114963	She	2810	" You are a clever woman , Mrs. Tenbruggen and you know it . You have an eloquent tongue , and you know it . But you are something else , which you do n't seem to be aware of . You are a Bore . "
115128	115175	115103	115103	I	0	" Your letter received , dear girl . I am not in the least angry ; partly because I am very fond of you , partly because I know that you will ask me to come back again . P. S. : Philip sends his love . "
115331	115345	115317	115317	she	66	" Oh , if I was rich enough to leave this wicked house ! "
115873	115885	115860	115860	He	47	" How are we to live ? where is the money ? "
116291	116308	116279	116279	she	4092	" There is the wretch who has been trying to persuade me to poison your mother ! "
116920	116926	116927	116927	He	47	" a matter of business . "
117038	117041	117042	117042	I	0	" You , "
117045	117061	117042	117042	I	0	" who distrusted and detested her - you are on friendly terms with that woman ? "
117067	117197	117062	117062	He	47	" My dear Helena , do n't speak in that way of Mrs. Tenbruggen . We have both been mistaken about her . That good creature has forgiven the brutal manner in which I spoke to her , when she was in attendance on my father . She was the first to propose that we should shake hands and forget it . My darling , do n't let all the good feeling be on one side . You have no idea how kindly she speaks of you , and how anxious she is to help us to be married . Come ! come ! meet her half - way . Write down the name of the shop on my card , and I will take it back to her . "
117302	117313	117314	117314	he	47	" I never knew before how obstinate you could be , "
117317	117339	117314	117314	he	47	" you seem to be doing your best - I ca n't imagine why - to lower yourself in my estimation . "
117514	117533	117494	117494	I	0	" I earn more money than I know what to do with ; and I adore Irish lace . "
117568	117645	117541	117541	she	49	" A tribute , dear Helena , offered by one of my grateful patients . Too beautiful a present for an old woman like me . I agree with the poet : ' Sweets to the sweet . ' A charming thought of Shakespeare 's , is it not ? I should like to verify the quotation . Would you mind leaving the volume for me in the hall , if I call to - morrow ? "
117731	117740	117741	117741	she	66	" Oh , for me ! for me ! "
117744	117761	117741	117741	she	66	" I noticed it this morning on Elizabeth 's table . How very kind of her ! "
117780	117786	117787	117787	she	66	" The perfume of goodness , "
117790	117798	117787	117787	she	66	" mingled with the perfume of flowers ! "
117799	117808	117809	117809	I	0	" When you have quite done with it , "
117812	117825	117809	117809	I	0	" perhaps you will be so good as to return my nosegay ? "
117826	117830	117831	117831	she	66	" Your nosegay ! "
117834	117842	117843	117843	I	0	" There is Mrs. Tenbruggen 's letter , "
117846	117856	117843	117843	I	0	" if you would like to look at it . "
118175	118197	118165	118165	her	66	" Your sister is a nice girl , but she is like other nice girls - she does n't interest me . "
118471	118484	118464	118464	she	66	" Has Mr. Philip Dunboyne told you why he went to London ? "
118485	118492	118493	118493	I	0	" He made a commonplace excuse , "
118496	118512	118466	118466	her	66	" Business , he said , took him to London . I know no more . "
118513	118613	118464	118464	she	66	" You have a fair prospect of happiness , Miss Helena , when you are married - your future husband is evidently afraid of you . I am not afraid of you ; and I shall confide to your private ear something which you have an interest in knowing . The business which took young Mr. Dunboyne to London was to consult a competent person , on a matter concerning himself . The competent person is the sagacious not to say sly old gentleman - whom we used to call the Governor . You know him , I believe ? "
118614	118632	118464	118464	she	66	" Yes . But I am at a loss to imagine why Philip should have consulted him . "
118633	118657	118466	118466	her	66	" Have you ever heard or read , Miss Helena , of such a thing as ' an old man 's fancy ' ? "
118658	118664	118464	118464	she	66	" I think I have . "
118665	118695	118464	118464	she	66	" Well , the Governor has taken an old man 's fancy to your sister . They appeared to understand each other perfectly when I was at the farmhouse . "
118696	118718	118719	118719	She	2917	" Excuse me , Mrs. Tenbruggen , that is what I know already . Why did Philip go to the Governor ? "
118722	118759	118719	118719	She	2917	" If anybody is acquainted with the true state of your sister 's feelings , the Governor is the man . I sent Mr. Dunboyne to consult him - and there is the reason for it . "
118867	118875	118876	118876	she	2917	" Philip Dunboyne is an excellent fellow , "
118879	119042	118876	118876	she	2917	" I really like him - but he has his faults . He sadly wants strength of purpose ; and , like weak men in general , he only knows his own mind when a resolute friend takes him in hand and guides him . I am his resolute friend . I saw him veering about between you and Eunice ; and I decided for his sake - may I say for your sake also ? - on putting an end to that mischievous state of indecision . You have the claim on him ; you are the right wife for him , and the Governor was as I thought likely from what I had myself observed the man to make him see it . I am not in anybody 's secrets ; it was pure guesswork on my part , and it has succeeded . There is no more doubt now about Miss Eunice 's sentiments . The question is settled . "
119043	119048	118860	118860	her	2917	" In my favor ? "
119049	119066	118860	118860	her	2917	" Certainly in your favor - or I should not have said a word about it . "
119067	119084	118876	118876	she	2917	" Was Philip 's visit kindly received ? Or did the old wretch laugh at him ? "
119085	119478	118860	118860	her	2917	" My dear Miss Gracedieu , the old wretch is a man of the world , and never makes mistakes of that sort . Before he could open his lips , he had to satisfy himself that your lover deserved to be taken into his confidence , on the delicate subject of Eunice 's sentiments . He arrived at a favorable conclusion . I can repeat Philip 's questions and the Governor 's answers after putting the young man through a stiff examination just as they passed : ' May I inquire , sir , if she has spoken to you about me ? ' ' She has often spoken about you . ' ' Did she seem to be angry with me ? ' ' She is too good and too sweet to be angry with you . ' ' Do you think she will forgive me ? ' ' She has forgiven you . ' ' Did she say so herself ? ' ' Yes , of her own free will . ' ' Why did she refuse to see me when I called at the farm ? ' ' She had her own reasons - good reasons . ' ' Has she regretted it since ? ' ' Certainly not . ' ' Is it likely that she would consent , if I proposed a reconciliation ? ' ' I put that question to her myself . ' ' How did she take it , sir ? ' ' She declined to take it . ' ' You mean that she declined a reconciliation ? ' ' Yes . ' ' Are you sure she was in earnest ? ' ' I am positively sure . ' That last answer seems , by young Dunboyne 's own confession , to have been enough , and more than enough for him . He got up to go - and then an odd thing happened . After giving him the most unfavorable answers , the Governor patted him paternally on the shoulder , and encouraged him to hope . ' Before we say good - by , Mr. Philip , one word more . If I was as young as you are , I should not despair . ' There is a sudden change of front ! Who can explain it ? "
119513	119517	119518	119518	I	0	" Go on , "
119521	119545	119518	119518	I	0	" I am prepared to hear next that Philip has paid another visit to my sister , and has been received this time . "
119560	119569	119570	119570	she	49	" He has not been to the farm , "
119573	119590	119570	119570	she	49	" but he has done something nearly as foolish . He has written to your sister . "
119591	119603	119604	119604	She	49	" And he has received a favorable reply , of course ? "
119615	119623	119624	119624	she	49	" There is your sister 's reply , "
119686	119727	119681	119681	she	53	" You are engaged to Helena . Consider me as a stranger until you are married . After that time you will be my brother - in - law , and then I may pardon you for writing to me . "
119791	119803	119804	119804	I	0	" I have been unworthy of your generous interest in me , "
119807	119818	119804	119804	I	0	" I am almost ashamed to offer you my hand . "
119833	119838	119839	119839	she	49	" Are we friends ? "
119849	119859	119860	119860	she	49	" Then let us be easy and pleasant again , "
119864	120009	119860	119860	she	49	" Will you call me Elizabeth ; and shall I call you Helena ? Very well . Now I have got something else to say ; another secret which must be kept from Philip I call him by his name now , you see for a few days more . Your happiness , my dear , must not depend on his miserly old father . He must have a little income of his own to marry on . Among the hundreds of unfortunate wretches whom I have relieved from torture of mind and body , there is a grateful minority . Small ! small ! but there they are . I have influence among powerful people ; and I am trying to make Philip private secretary to a member of Parliament . When I have succeeded , you shall tell him the good news . "
120064	120069	120070	120070	she	2926	" What a sacrifice ! "
120073	120120	120070	120070	she	2926	" A kiss for me , which ought to have been kept for Philip ! By - the - by , do you know what I should do , Helena , in your place ? I should take our handsome young man away from that hotel ! "
120121	120130	120131	120131	I	0	" I will do anything that you advise , "
120134	120279	120131	120131	I	0	" And you will do well , my child . In the first place , the hotel is too expensive for Philip 's small means . In the second place , two of the chambermaids have audaciously presumed to be charming girls ; and the men , my dear - well ! well ! I will leave you to find that out for yourself . In the third place , you want to have Philip under your own wing ; domestic familiarity will make him fonder of you than ever . Keep him out of the sort of company that he meets with in the billiard - room and the smoking - room . You have got a spare bed here , I know , and your poor father is in no condition to use his authority . Make Philip one of the family . "
120300	120307	120308	120308	she	49	" Make Selina of some use , "
120311	120396	120308	120308	she	49	" While you have got her in the house , Propriety is rampant . Why condemn poor helpless Philip to cheap lodgings ? Time enough to cast him out to the feather - bed and the fleas on the night before your marriage . Besides , I shall be in and out constantly - for I mean to cure your father . The tongue of scandal is silent in my awful presence ; an atmosphere of virtue surrounds Mamma Tenbruggen . Think of it . "
120508	120625	120626	120626	she	2932	" Miss Helena Gracedieu , my first impulse under the present disgusting circumstances was to leave the house , and earn a bare crust in the cheapest garret I could find in the town . But my grateful heart remembers Mr. Gracedieu . My poor afflicted cousin was good to me when I was helpless . I can not forsake him when he is helpless . At whatever sacrifice of my own self - respect , I remain under this roof , so dear to me for the Minister 's sake . I notice , miss , that you smile . I see my once dear Elizabeth , the friend who has so bitterly disappointed me - "
120642	120719	120626	120626	she	2932	" the friend who has so bitterly disappointed me , taking satirical notes of what I say . I am not ashamed of what I say . The virtue which will not stretch a little , where the motive is good , is feeble virtue indeed . I shall stay in the house , and witness horrors , and rise superior to them . Good - morning , Miss Gracedieu . Good - morning , Elizabeth . "
121015	121019	121023	121023	he	2937	" L'Ame Damne'e , "
121460	121468	121457	121457	She	66	" You have got your own watch . "
121477	121482	121483	121483	she	66	" So has mine , "
122374	122382	122345	122345	she	2919	" My angel , I love you ! "
122647	122669	122670	122671	What friend	2978	" Good - by , Miss Helena . I am going to stay for a day or two with a friend . "
122881	122886	122887	122887	I	0	" Double your fare , "
122893	122913	122887	122887	I	0	" whatever it may be , if you follow that chaise cleverly , and do what I tell you . "
122995	123049	122978	122978	He	2986	" If we keep too near the gentleman , miss , he has only got to look back , and he 'll see we are following him . The safe thing to do is to let the chaise get on a bit . We ca n't lose sight of it , out here . "
123139	123191	123130	123130	his	2996	" Wherever the chaise stops , miss , we must drive past it as if we were going somewhere else . I shall notice the place while we go by ; and you will please sit back in the corner of the cab so that the gentleman ca n't see you . "
123192	123195	123196	123196	I	0	" Well , "
123199	123204	123196	123196	I	0	" and what next ? "
123205	123346	123130	123130	his	2996	" Next , miss , I shall pull up , wherever it may be , out of sight of the driver of the chaise . He bears an excellent character , I do n't deny it ; but I 've known him for years - and we had better not trust him . I shall tell you where the gentleman stopped ; and you will go back to the place on foot , of course , and see for yourself what 's to be done , specially if there happens to be a lady in the case . No offense , miss ; it 's in my experience that there 's generally a lady in the case . Anyhow , you can judge for yourself , and you 'll know where to find me waiting when you want me again . "
123347	123352	123353	123353	I	0	" Suppose something happens , "
123356	123363	123353	123353	I	0	" that we do n't expect ? "
123364	123377	123130	123130	his	2996	" I sha n't lose my head , miss , whatever happens . "
123378	123394	123403	123404	the man	3581	" All very well , coachman ; but I have only your word for it . "
123413	123457	123403	123404	the man	3581	" Begging your pardon , my young lady , you 've got if I may say so what they call a guarantee . When I was a young man , I drove a cab in London for ten years . Will that do ? "
123458	123464	123465	123465	I	0	" I suppose you mean , "
123468	123483	123465	123465	I	0	" that you have learned deceit in the wicked ways of the great city . "
123491	123502	123484	123484	He	3581	" Thank you , miss . That 's it exactly . "
123592	123599	123600	123600	he	3581	" In your place , miss , "
123604	123647	123600	123600	he	3581	" the private way back is the way I should wish to take . Try it by the fields . Turn to the right when you have passed the barn , and you 'll find yourself at the back of the house . "
123659	123665	123666	123666	he	3581	" Half - past twelve , "
123669	123750	123666	123666	he	3581	" the Chawbacons - I mean the farmhouse servants , miss - will be at their dinner . All in your favor , so far . If the dog happens to be loose , do n't forget that his name 's Grinder ; call him by his name , and pat him before he has time enough to think , and he 'll let you be . When you want me , here you 'll find me waiting for orders . "
124044	124097	124042	124042	Philip	47	" I am afraid , dear Mr. Philip , you do n't quite understand my sweet Euneece . Honorable , high minded , delicate in her feelings , and , oh , so unselfish ! I do n't want to alarm you , but when she hears you have been deceiving Helena - "
124098	124157	124040	124040	her	66	" Upon my word , Miss Jillgall , you are so provoking ! I have not been deceiving Helena . Have n't I told you what discouraging answers I got , when I went to see the Governor ? Have n't I shown you Eunice 's reply to my letter ? You ca n't have forgotten it already ? "
124158	124187	124040	124040	her	66	" Oh , yes , I have . Why should I remember it ? Do n't I know poor Euneece was in your mind , all the time ? "
124188	124247	124042	124042	Philip	47	" You 're wrong again ! Eunice was not in my mind all the time . I was hurt - I was offended by the cruel manner in which she had treated me . And what was the consequence ? So far was I from deceiving Helena - she rose in my estimation by comparison with her sister . "
124248	124276	124040	124040	her	66	" Oh , come , come , Mr. Philip ! that wo n't do . Helena rising in anybody 's estimation ? Ha ! ha ! ha ! "
124277	124353	124040	124040	her	66	" Laugh as much as you like , Miss Jillgall , you wo n't laugh away the facts . Helena loved me ; Helena was true to me . Do n't be hard on a poor fellow who is half distracted . What a man finds he can do on one day , he finds he ca n't do on another . Try to understand that a change does sometimes come over one 's feelings . "
124354	124394	124042	124042	Philip	47	" Bless my soul , Mr. Philip , that 's just what I have been understanding all the time ! I know your mind as well as you know it yourself . You ca n't forget my sweet Euneece . "
124395	124474	124040	124040	her	66	" I tell you I tried to forget her ! On my word of honor as a gentleman , I tried to forget her , in justice to Helena . Is it my fault that I failed ? Eunice was in my mind , as you said just now . Oh , my friend - for you are my friend , I am sure - persuade her to see me , if it 's only for a minute ! "
124531	124582	124527	124527	she	96	" Mr. Philip , you are hard and unreasonable . I have tried to persuade her , and I have made my darling cry . Nothing you can say will induce me to distress her again . Go back , you very undetermined man - go back to your Helena . "
124583	124587	124505	124505	Eunice	53	" Too late . "
124588	124591	124505	124505	Eunice	53	" Nonsense ! "
124592	124648	124527	124527	she	96	" I say too late . If I could have married Helena when I first went to stay in the house , I might have faced the sacrifice . As it is , I ca n't endure her ; and I tell you this in confidence she has herself to thank for what has happened . "
124649	124655	124675	124675	her	3026	" Is that really true ? "
124656	124660	124527	124527	she	96	" Quite true . "
124661	124668	124527	124527	she	96	" Tell me what she did . "

124945	124981	124982	124982	Helena	52	" CHAPTER LVII . HELENA 'S DIARY RESUMED . So it was all settled between them . Philip is to throw me away , like one of his bad cigars , for this unanswerable reason : "
124986	125081	124982	124982	Helena	52	" And he is to persuade Eunice to take my place , and be his wife . Yes ! if I let him do it . I heard no more of their talk . With that last , worst outrage burning in my memory , I left the place . On my way back to the carriage , the dog met me . Truly , a grand creature . I called him by his name , and patted him . He licked my hand . Something made me speak to him . I said : "
125101	125241	125097	125097	you	3033	" The great good - natured brute held out his paw to shake hands . Well ! well ! I was not an object of disgust to the dog . But the coachman was startled , when he saw me again . He said something , I did not know what it was ; and he produced a pocket - flask , containing some spirits , I suppose . Perhaps he thought I was going to faint . He little knew me . I told him to drive back to the place at which I had hired the cab , and earn his money . He earned it . On getting home , I found Mrs. Tenbruggen walking up and down the dining - room , deep in thought . She was startled when we first confronted each other . "
125247	125276	125242	125242	You	3034	" she said . I answered that I had been out for a little exercise , and had over - fatigued myself ; and then changed the subject . "
125287	125291	125278	125279	my father	615	" I asked . "

125426	125468	125423	125423	he	615	" The cabinet was full of old letters . I could tell her that - and could tell her no more . I had never heard of his brother - in - law . Another of his delusions , no doubt . "
125476	125482	125473	125473	him	615	" Mrs. Tenbruggen went on , "
125490	125519	125473	125473	him	615	" She waited for my reply to this last inquiry with an appearance of anxiety that surprised me . I had never heard him speak of Low Lanes . "
125529	125533	125521	125521	you	0	" I asked . "
125537	125707	125521	125521	you	0	" She went away to attend on a patient . I retired to my bedroom , and opened my Diary . Again and again , I read that remarkable story of the intended poisoning , and of the manner in which it had ended . I sat thinking over this romance in real life till I was interrupted by the announcement of dinner . Mr. Philip Dunboyne had returned . In Miss Jillgall 's absence we were alone at the table . My appetite was gone . I made a pretense of eating , and another pretense of being glad to see my devoted lover . I talked to him in the prettiest manner . As a hypocrite , he thoroughly matched me ; he was gallant , he was amusing . If baseness like ours had been punishable by the law , a prison was the right place for both of us . Mrs. Tenbruggen came in again after dinner , still not quite easy about my health . "
125713	125717	125521	125521	you	0	" she said . "
125724	125812	125521	125521	you	0	" I laughed , and left her with Mr. Philip Dunboyne . Passing my father 's door , I looked in , anxious to see if he was in the excitable state which Mrs. Tenbruggen had described . Yes ; the effect which she had produced on him - how , she knows best - had not passed away yet : he was still talking . The attendant told me it had gone on for hours together . On my approaching his chair , he called out : "
125821	125835	125819	125819	Helena	52	" When I had answered him , he beckoned me to come nearer . "
125843	125847	125819	125819	Helena	52	" he said . "
125865	126218	125848	125848	We	3043	" Where had I been born ? He had never told me where . Had he mentioned the place in Mrs. Tenbruggen 's hearing ? I asked the attendant if he had been present while she was in the room . Yes ; he had remained at his post ; he had also heard the allusion to the place with the odd name . Had Mr. Gracedieu said anything more about that place ? Nothing more ; the poor Minister 's mind had wandered off to other things . He was wandering now . Sometimes , he was addressing his congregation ; sometimes , he wondered what they would give him for supper ; sometimes , he talked of the flowers in the garden . And then he looked at me , and frowned , and said I prevented him from thinking . I went back to my bedroom , and opened my Diary , and read the story again . Was the poison of which that resolute young wife proposed to make use something that acted slowly , and told the doctors nothing if they looked for it after death ? Would it be running too great a risk to show the story to the doctor , and try to get a little valuable information in that way ? It would be useless . He would make some feeble joke ; he would say , girls and poisons are not fit company for each other . But I might discover what I want to know in another way . I might call on the doctor , after he has gone out on his afternoon round of visits , and might tell the servant I would wait for his master 's return . Nobody would be in my way ; I might get at the medical literature in the consulting - room , and find the information for myself . A knock at my door interrupted me in the midst of my plans . Mrs. Tenbruggen again ! - still in a fidgety state of feeling on the subject of my health . "
126223	126227	125848	125848	We	3043	" she said . "

126319	126351	126267	126267	I	0	" Beyond the limits of the town , of course ? Philip has been taking a walk in the country , too . He does n't say that he met you . "
126458	126466	126467	126467	she	3047	" Have I interrupted you in writing ? "
126475	126498	126467	126467	she	3047	" No ; I was idling over what I have written already - an extraordinary story which I copied from a book . "
126499	126506	126507	126507	I	0	" May I look at it ? "
126543	126552	126553	126553	I	0	" It 's a piece of family history , "
126556	126570	126553	126553	I	0	" I think you will agree with me that it is really interesting . "
126649	126653	126654	126655	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" Coarse melodrama ! "
126658	126673	126654	126655	Mrs. Tenbruggen	49	" Mere sensation . No analysis of character . A made - up story ! "
126674	126681	126682	126682	I	0	" Well made up , surely ? "
126685	126693	126682	126682	I	0	" I do n't agree with you . "
126744	126758	126727	126727	she	3047	" Take care of yourself , Helena ; pray take care of yourself . "
127325	127332	127333	127333	he	47	" In a few days more , "
127336	127345	127333	127333	he	47	" I shall ask for leave of absence . "
127457	127467	127468	127468	I	0	" Is there any other motive for your departure ? "
127471	127479	127480	127480	he	47	" What other motive can there be ? "
127497	127516	127517	127517	He	47	" Tell me , Philip , are you beginning to wish that you were a free man again ? "
127564	127575	127576	127576	I	0	" I fancy you have been out of temper lately , "
127579	127607	127576	127576	I	0	" You have not been your own kinder and better self . Is this the right interpretation of the change that I think I see in you ? "
127611	127620	127608	127608	He	47	" I have not been very well lately . "
127621	127627	127608	127608	He	47	" And that is all ? "
127628	127635	127608	127608	He	47	" Yes - that is all . "
127726	127772	127777	127777	your	3084	" If anything of importance happens , I trust to you to write an account of it , and to send the writing to me . I will come to you at once , if I see reason to believe that my presence is required . "
128258	128278	128253	128253	I	0	" Elizabeth , you appear to have changed your opinion of the two girls , since I saw you . "

128300	128322	128297	128297	I	0	" A woman of your intellectual caliber , dear , does n't change her mind without a good reason for it . "

128358	128370	128354	128354	I	0	" I suppose I may not ask what the discovery is ? "
128371	128381	128329	128329	I	0	" No , Selina , you may not ask . "

128722	128771	128719	128719	she	174	" Beware of her , Selina . Unless I am much mistaken , she is going to end badly . Take care of Philip , take care of Euneece . If you want help , apply at once to my favorite hero in real life , The Governor . "

Placed meanwhile under the care of Miss Selina Jillgall . "
128977	129007	128974	128974	he	47	" It is n't exactly pain ; I feel as if I was sinking . Sometimes I am giddy ; and sometimes I find myself feeling thirsty and sick . "
129359	129388	129356	129356	he	162	" I do n't want to have a listener at the door . Come out on the lawn , where we can be sure that we are alone . "
129403	129411	129412	129412	he	162	" Rouse your courage , Miss Jillgall , "
129415	129433	129412	129412	he	162	" In the Minister 's helpless state there is nobody whom I can speak to but yourself . "
129468	129471	129464	129464	he	162	" No ! "
129512	129519	129520	129520	he	162	" Now , listen to this , "
129524	129567	129520	129520	he	162	" Everything that my art can do for Mr. Philip Dunboyne , while I am at his bedside , is undone while I am away by some other person . He is worse to - day than I have seen him yet . "
129568	129580	129520	129520	he	162	" Oh , sir , do you think he will die ? "
129581	129649	129520	129520	he	162	" He will certainly die unless the right means are taken to save him , and taken at once . It is my duty not to flinch from telling you the truth . I have made a discovery since yesterday which satisfies me that I am right . Somebody is trying to poison Mr. Dunboyne ; and somebody will succeed unless he is removed from this house . "
129719	129751	129716	129716	He	162	" To the hospital . No poisoner can follow my patient there . Persuade him to let me take him away , when I call again in an hour 's time . "
129856	129861	129862	129862	he	47	" I am dying , "
129865	129899	129862	129862	he	47	" If you have any pity for me , send for Euneece . Let me see her once more , let me hear her say that she forgives me , before I die . "
129937	129942	129943	129943	he	47	" If you refuse , "
129947	129966	129943	129943	he	47	" the grave wo n't hold me . I 'll haunt you for the rest of your life . "

130090	130094	130095	130095	I	0	" Do nothing , "

130321	130328	130329	130329	she	77	" Which is Philip 's room ? "
130411	130418	130424	130428	this sadly - changed girl	3167	" Who is with him now ? "

130457	130508	130445	130445	she	77	" Euneece got no further than that . Her breath quickened , her color faded away . I had seen people look as she was looking now , when they suffered under some sudden pain . Before I could offer to help her , she rallied , and went on : "
130511	130516	130518	130520	the other nurse	3168	" she began again , "

She saw that I was overpowered . Her sweet nature , so strangely frozen up thus far , melted at last . "
130605	130609	130596	130596	You	0	" she said , "
130622	130656	130610	130610	you	0	" She left her chair , and sat on my knee with the familiarity of the dear old times , and took the letter that I had written to her from her pocket . "

130881	130931	130877	130877	I	0	" she asked . I have heard some insolent men say that women are like cats . If they mean that we do , figuratively speaking , scratch at times , I am afraid they are not altogether wrong . An irresistible impulse made me say to poor Euneece : "
130945	130946	130939	130939	you	242	" "
130955	130960	130939	130939	you	242	" she asked sadly . "
130969	130984	130985	130985	I	0	" I begged her to forgive me ; I said I meant no harm . "
130993	130997	130985	130985	I	0	" she continued , "
131045	131140	131037	131037	Selina	140	" She put her arm round me , and made me get up from my chair . I was so easily persuaded by her , that the fear of what Helena 's jealousy and Helena 's anger might do was scarcely present in my thoughts . The door of communication was locked on the side of the bedchamber . I went into the hall , to enter Philip 's room by the other door . She followed , waiting behind me . I heard what passed between them when Maria went out to her . "
131146	131147	131143	131144	Miss Gracedieu	52	" "
131157	131158	131143	131144	Miss Gracedieu	52	" "

131209	131282	131203	131203	I	0	" She joined me . I held the door open for her to go into Philip 's room . It was not out of curiosity ; the feeling that urged me was sympathy , when I waited a moment to see their first meeting . She bent over the poor , pallid , trembling , suffering man , and raised him in her arms , and laid his head on her bosom . "
131286	131344	131203	131203	I	0	" She murmured those words in a kiss . I closed the door , I had a good cry ; and , oh , how it comforted me ! There was only a minute to spare when she came out of the room . Maria was waiting for her . Euneece said , as quietly as ever : "
131351	131557	131558	131558	You	3191	" The girl looked at her , and saw - I do n't know what . Maria became alarmed . But she went up the stairs , and returned in haste to tell us that her young mistress was coming down . The faint rustling of Helena 's dress as she left her room reached us in the silence . I remained at the open door of the dining - room , and Maria approached and stood near me . We were both frightened . Euneece stepped forward , and stood on the mat at the foot of the stairs , waiting . Her back was toward me ; I could only see that she was as still as a statue . The rustling of the dress came nearer . Oh , heavens ! what was going to happen ? My teeth chattered in my head ; I held by Maria 's shoulder . Drops of perspiration showed themselves on the girl 's forehead ; she stared in vacant terror at the slim little figure , posted firm and still on the mat . Helena turned the corner of the stairs , and waited a moment on the last landing , and saw her sister . "
131561	131565	131558	131558	You	3191	" she said . "
131571	131846	131568	131568	you	3191	" There was no reply . Helena descended , until she reached the last stair but one . There , she stopped . Her staring eyes grew large and wild ; her hand shook as she stretched it out , feeling for the banister ; she staggered as she caught at it , and held herself up . The silence was still unbroken . Something in me , stronger than myself , drew my steps along the hall nearer and nearer to the stair , till I could see the face which had struck that murderous wretch with terror . I looked . No ! it was not my sweet girl ; it was a horrid transformation of her . I saw a fearful creature , with glittering eyes that threatened some unimaginable vengeance . Her lips were drawn back ; they showed her clinched teeth . A burning red flush dyed her face . The hair of her head rose , little by little , slowly . And , most dreadful sight of all , she seemed , in the stillness of the house , to be listening to something . If I could have moved , I should have fled to the first place of refuge I could find . If I could have raised my voice , I should have cried for help . I could do neither the one nor the other . I could only look , look , look ; held by the horror of it with a hand of iron . Helena must have roused her courage , and resisted her terror . I heard her speak : "
131851	131852	131568	131568	you	3191	" "
131855	131891	131568	131568	you	3191	" Slowly , steadily , in a whisper , Euneece made that reply . Helena tried once more - still fighting against her own terror : I knew it by the trembling of her voice . "
131896	131900	131901	131901	I	0	" she repeated ; "
131911	131912	131904	131904	my	0	" "
131922	131923	131913	131913	You	0	" "
131929	131930	131931	131931	I	0	" "
131934	131981	131982	131982	Poisoner	142	" She had spoken in the same steady whisper throughout - but now she moved . I saw her set her foot on the first stair . I saw the horrid glitter in her eyes flash close into Helena 's face . I heard her say : "
131990	132489	131982	131982	Poisoner	142	" Silent and shuddering , Helena shrank away from her - daunted by her glittering eyes ; mastered by her lifted hand pointing up the stairs . Helena slowly ascended till she reached the landing . She turned and looked down ; she tried to speak . The pointing hand struck her dumb , and drove her up the next flight of stairs . She was lost to view . Only the small rustling sound of the dress was to be heard , growing fainter and fainter ; then an interval of stillness ; then the noise of a door opened and closed again ; then no sound more - but a change to be seen : the transformed creature was crouching on her knees , still and silent , her face covered by her hands . I was afraid to approach her ; I was afraid to speak to her . After a time , she rose . Suddenly , swiftly , with her head turned away from me , she opened the door of Philip 's room - and was gone . I looked round . There was only Maria in the lonely hall . Shall I try to tell you what my sensations were ? It may sound strangely , but it is true - I felt like a sleeper , who has half - awakened from a dream . CHAPTER LX . DISCOVERY . A little later , on that eventful day , when I was most in need of all that your wisdom and kindness could do to guide me , came the telegram which announced that you were helpless under an attack of gout . As soon as I had in some degree got over my disappointment , I remembered having told Euneece in my letter that I expected her kind old friend to come to us . With the telegram in my hand I knocked softly at Philip 's door . The voice that bade me come in was the gentle voice that I knew so well . Philip was sleeping . There , by his bedside , with his hand resting in her hand , was Euneece , so completely restored to her own sweet self that I could hardly believe what I had seen , not an hour since . She talked of you , when I showed her your message , with affectionate interest and regret . Look back , my admirable friend , at what I have written on the two or three pages which precede this , and explain the astounding contrast if you can . I was left alone to watch by Philip , while Euneece went away to see her father . Soon afterward , Maria took my place ; I had been sent for to the next room to receive the doctor . He looked care - worn and grieved . I said I was afraid he had brought bad news with him . "
132495	132499	131982	131982	Poisoner	142	" he answered . "
132515	132703	132508	132508	I	0	" He then asked me to remember the day when I had been surprised by the singular questions which he had put to me , and when he had engaged to explain himself after he had made some inquiries . Why , and how , he had set those inquiries on foot was what he had now to tell . I will repeat what he said , in his own words , as nearly as I can remember them . While he was in attendance on Philip , he had observed symptoms which made him suspect that Digitalis had been given to the young man , in doses often repeated . Cases of attempted poisoning by this medicine were so rare , that he felt bound to put his suspicions to the test by going round among the chemists 's shops - excepting of course the shop at which his own prescriptions were made up - and asking if they had lately dispensed any preparation of Digitalis , ordered perhaps in a larger quantity than usual . At the second shop he visited , the chemist laughed . "
132708	132712	132905	132905	you	419	" he said , "
132720	132783	132716	132716	your	419	" After this , the prescription was asked for , and produced . It was on the paper used by the doctor - paper which had his address printed at the top , and a notice added , telling patients who came to consult him for the second time to bring their prescriptions with them . Then , there followed in writing : "
132790	132877	132879	132879	you	419	" - with his signature at the end , not badly imitated , but a forgery nevertheless . The chemist noticed the effect which this discovery had produced on the doctor , and asked if that was his signature . He could hardly , as an honest man , have asserted that a forgery was a signature of his own writing . So he made the true reply , and asked who had presented the prescription . The chemist called to his assistant to come forward . "
132897	132903	132879	132879	you	419	" The assistant admitted it . "
132914	132915	132916	132916	I	0	" "

132936	132942	132943	132943	I	0	" The chemist then said : "
132996	133045	132987	132987	you	419	" Our good friend thought of the poor Minister , so sorely afflicted , and of the famous name so sincerely respected in the town and in the country round , and said he could not undertake to give an immediate answer . The chemist was excessively angry . "
133054	133058	133046	133046	You	419	" he said , "
133108	133320	133088	133088	you	419	" He ended in declaring he should consult his lawyer . The doctor went home , and questioned his servant . The man remembered the day of Miss Helena 's visit in the afternoon , and the intention that she expressed of waiting for his master 's return . He had shown her into the parlor which opened into the consulting - room . No other visitor was in the house at that time , or had arrived during the rest of the day . The doctor 's own experience , when he got home , led him to conclude that Helena had gone into the consulting - room . He had entered that room , for the purpose of writing some prescriptions , and had found the leaves of paper that he used diminished in number . After what he had heard , and what he had discovered to say nothing of what he suspected , it occurred to him to look along the shelves of his medical library . He found a volume treating of Poisons with a slip of paper left between the leaves ; the poison described at the place so marked being Digitalis , and the paper used being one of his own prescription - papers . "
133339	133344	133407	133407	she	52	" the doctor concluded , "
133365	133405	133407	133407	she	52	" It is my belief that I could have felt no greater dismay , if the long arm of the Law had laid its hold on me while he was speaking . I asked what was to be done . "
133414	133490	133407	133407	she	52	" the doctor replied , ' she may escape the infamy of being charged with an attempt at murder by poison ; and , in her absence , I can answer for Philip 's life . I do n't urge you to warn her , because that might be a dangerous thing to do . It is for you to decide , as a member of the family , whether you will run the risk . "
133522	133530	133531	133531	he	3202	" Keep it for a fitter time , "
133534	133546	133531	133531	he	3202	" and think of what I have just said to you . "
133770	133774	133768	133768	Euneece	77	" a mere girl "
133875	133887	133888	133888	she	53	" All that Philip wants , and all that we want , "
133891	133908	133888	133888	she	53	" we can provide for ourselves . Give me a morsel of paper to write on . "
133928	133932	133933	133933	she	53	" Somebody listening , "
133936	133941	133933	133933	she	53	" Let them listen . "
133972	133980	133981	133981	she	53	" I do n't doubt the servants , "
133992	134020	133981	133981	she	53	" but I am afraid of what a Poisoner 's cunning and a Poisoner 's desperation may do , in a kitchen which is open to her . "
134059	134069	134070	134070	she	53	" We can now attend on him in turn , "
134073	134166	134070	134070	she	53	" without opening either of the doors which lead into the hall . At night we can relieve each other , and each of us can get sleep as we want it in the large armchair in the dining - room . Philip must be safe under our charge , or the doctor will insist on taking him to the hospital . When we want Maria 's help , from time to time , we can employ her under our own superintendence . Have you anything else , Selina , to suggest ? "
134197	134218	134193	134193	She	53	" I 'm sure I do n't know ; my thoughts came to me while I was looking at Philip . "
134327	134337	134338	134338	I	0	" Are you going to withdraw from the case ? "
134341	134350	134351	134351	he	162	" I am coming back to the case , "
134354	134360	134351	134351	he	162	" to - morrow morning . "
134648	134660	134645	134645	I	0	" This is a treaty of peace between father and son . "
134760	134773	134774	134774	I	0	" Are you still afraid that she may succeed in poisoning Philip ? "
134777	134785	134786	134786	he	162	" I am afraid of her cunning , "
134789	134840	134786	134786	he	162	" If she is charged with attempting to poison young Dunboyne , she has some system of defense , you may rely on it , for which we are not prepared . There , in my opinion , is the true reason for her extraordinary insensibility to her own danger . "
134891	134987	134988	134988	I	0	" Miss Helena is tempting me . She is so miserable at being prevented from seeing Mr. Philip , and helping to nurse him , that it is quite distressing to see her . At the same time , miss , it 's hard on a poor servant . She asks me to take the key secretly out of the door , and lend it to her at night for a few minutes only . I 'm really afraid I shall be led into doing it , if she goes on persuading me much longer . "
135150	135177	135142	135142	He	162	" I think I see a note in your hand . Was it given to you by the young man who has just left the house ? "
135178	135183	135142	135142	He	162	" Yes , sir . "
135200	135201	135193	135193	I	0	" "

135247	135296	135231	135231	I	0	" The moment I heard that I threw open the dining - room door . Curiosity is not easily satisfied . When it hears , it wants to see ; when it sees , it wants to know . Every lady will agree with me in this observation . "
135301	135305	135309	135310	Miss Jillgall	140	" I said . "
135346	135361	135342	135342	you	64	" He joined me in the dining - room , and closed the door . "
135366	135371	135342	135342	you	64	" he went on , "
135414	135415	135390	135402	a young man who was called to speak to a question of identity	3255	" "
135420	135421	135422	135424	That young man	780	" "

135474	135495	135467	135467	Her	53	" She had gone out to buy some fruit and flowers for Philip . The doctor accepted his disappointment resignedly . "
135506	135510	135467	135467	Her	53	" he said . "
135562	135642	135554	135555	the poisoner	3169	" I asked if the chemist had written the note . Foolish enough of me when I came to think of it . The chemist would scarcely act a friendly part toward Helena , when she was answerable for the awkward position in which he had placed himself . Perhaps the young man who had left the warning was also the writer of the warning . The doctor reminded me that he was all but a stranger to Helena . "
135649	135653	135643	135643	We	3267	" he remarked , "
135664	135665	135668	135668	he	3268	" "
135674	135707	135668	135668	he	3268	" I ventured to say . This was a strong hint , but the doctor failed to see it . He had evidently forgotten his own youth . I made another attempt . "
135714	135718	135670	135672	a young man	1228	" I continued , "
135735	135742	135743	135743	Woman	3271	" He saw it at last . "
135747	135751	135743	135743	Woman	3271	" he cried . "
135779	135780	135760	135762	The young fool	3273	" "

135880	135934	135859	135859	you	3272	" Just as he said those terrifying words , Maria came back to us . He asked at once what had kept her so long upstairs . The girl had evidently something to say , which had inflated her if I may use such an expression with a sense of her own importance . "
135944	135948	135950	135950	my	0	" she answered , "
136114	136120	136105	136105	I	0	" The doctor dismissed Maria . "
136125	136131	136105	136105	I	0	" he said to me , "
136139	136362	136363	136363	I	0	" I am not a courageous woman ; I expressed myself as being willing to go to her , if the doctor went with me . He said that was impossible ; she would probably refuse to speak before any witness ; and certainly before him . But he promised to look after Philip in my absence , and to wait below if it really so happened that I wanted him . I need only ring the bell , and he would come to me the moment he heard it . Such kindness as this roused my courage , I suppose . At any rate , I went upstairs . She was standing by the fire - place , with her elbow on the chimney - piece , and her head , resting on her hand . I stopped just inside the door , waiting to hear what she had to say . In this position her side - face only was presented to me . It was a ghastly face . The eye that I could see turned wickedly on me when I came in - then turned away again . Otherwise , she never moved . I confess I trembled , but I did my best to disguise it . She broke out suddenly with what she had to say : "
136476	136496	136497	136497	I	0	" In my own mind , I asked myself if she had gone mad . But I only answered : "
136503	136508	136497	136497	I	0	" She said again : "
136515	136516	136511	136511	Eunice	53	" "
136521	136541	136511	136511	Eunice	53	" I asked . She turned her head slowly and faced me . I shrank from looking at her . "
136548	136553	136511	136511	Eunice	53	" she went on . "
136747	136772	136744	136745	the magistrates	4333	" I lost all fear of her : I stepped close up to the place at which she was standing ; I cried out : "
136787	136791	136792	136792	I	0	" She answered : "
136800	136836	136792	136792	I	0	" I ran out of the room ; I rushed headlong down the stairs . The doctor heard me , and came running into the hall . I caught hold of him like a madwoman . "
136839	136850	136837	136837	Euneece	77	" My breath was gone ; I could only say : "
136853	136902	136851	136851	Euneece	77	" He dragged me into the dining - room . There was wine on the side - board , which he had ordered medically for Philip . He forced me to drink some of it . It ran through me like fire ; it helped me to speak . "
136907	136911	136914	136914	she	3297	" he said , "
136919	136920	136921	136921	She	3297	" "
136929	136933	136921	136921	She	3297	" I answered . "
136939	136951	136914	136914	she	3297	" I told him . He looked me through and through . "
136955	136959	136914	136914	she	3297	" he said . "
136990	137020	137023	137023	you	0	" I said it again - quietly this time . His face startled me ; it was white with rage . He snatched his hat off the hall table . "

137036	137539	137033	137033	My	0	" He was out of the house before I could speak to him again . Third Period concluded . TROUBLES AND TRIUMPHS OF THE FAMILY , RELATED BY THE GOVERNOR . CHAPTER LXII . THE SENTENCE PRONOUNCED . MARTYRS to gout know , by sad experience , that they suffer under one of the most capricious of maladies . An attack of this disease will shift , in the most unaccountable manner , from one part of the body to another ; or , it will release the victim when there is every reason to fear that it is about to strengthen its hold on him ; or , having shown the fairest promise of submitting to medical treatment , it will cruelly lay the patient prostrate again in a state of relapse . Adverse fortune , in my case , subjected me to this last and worst trial of endurance . Two months passed - months of pain aggravated by anxiety - before I was able to help Eunice and Miss Jillgall personally with my sympathy and advice . During this interval , I heard regularly from the friendly and faithful Selina . Terror and suspense , courageously endured day after day , seem to have broken down her resistance , poor soul , when Eunice 's good name and Eunice 's tranquillity were threatened by the most infamous of false accusations . From that time , Miss Jillgall 's method of expressing herself betrayed a gradual deterioration . I shall avoid presenting at a disadvantage a correspondent who has claims on my gratitude , if I give the substance only of what she wrote - assisted by the newspaper which she sent to me , while the legal proceedings were in progress . Honest indignation does sometimes counsel us wisely . When the doctor left Miss Jillgall , in anger and in haste , he had determined on taking the course from which , as a humane man and a faithful friend , he had hitherto recoiled . It was no time , now , to shrink from the prospect of an exposure . The one hope of successfully encountering the vindictive wickedness of Helena lay in the resolution to be beforehand with her , in the appeal to the magistrates with which she had threatened Eunice and Miss Jillgall . The doctor 's sworn information stated the whole terrible case of the poisoning , ranging from his first suspicions and their confirmation , to Helena 's atrocious attempt to accuse her innocent sister of her own guilt . So firmly were the magistrates convinced of the serious nature of the case thus stated , that they did not hesitate to issue their warrant . Among the witnesses whose attendance was immediately secured , by the legal adviser to whom the doctor applied , were the farmer and his wife . Helena was arrested while she was dressing to go out . Her composure was not for a moment disturbed . "
137546	137551	137540	137540	I	0	" she said coolly , "
137572	137580	137562	137562	they	1148	" The attempt of this shameless wretch to "
137584	138208	137562	137562	they	1148	" on poor Eunice - suggested , as I afterward discovered , by the record of family history which she had quoted in her journal - was defeated with ease . The farmer and his wife proved the date at which Eunice had left her place of residence under their roof . The doctor 's evidence followed . He proved , by the production of his professional diary , that the discovery of the attempt to poison his patient had taken place before the day of Eunice 's departure from the farm , and that the first improvement in Mr. Philip Dunboyne 's state of health had shown itself after that young lady 's arrival to perform the duties of a nurse . To the wise precautions which she had taken - perverted by Helena to the purpose of a false accusation - the doctor attributed the preservation of the young man 's life . Having produced the worst possible impression on the minds of the magistrates , Helena was remanded . Her legal adviser had predicted this result ; but the vindictive obstinacy of his client had set both experience and remonstrance at defiance . At the renewed examination , the line of defense adopted by the prisoner 's lawyer proved to be - mistaken identity . It was asserted that she had never entered the chemist 's shop ; also , that the assistant had wrongly identified some other lady as Miss Helena Gracedieu ; also , that there was not an atom of evidence to connect her with the stealing of the doctor 's prescription - paper and the forgery of his writing . Other assertions to the same purpose followed , on which it is needless to dwell . The case for the prosecution was , happily , in competent hands . With the exception of one witness , cross - examination afforded no material help to the evidence for the defense . The chemist swore positively to the personal appearance of Helena , as being the personal appearance of the lady who had presented the prescription . His assistant , pressed on the question of identity , broke down under cross - examination - purposely , as it was whispered , serving the interests of the prisoner . But the victory , so far gained by the defense , was successfully contested by the statement of the next witness , a respectable tradesman in the town . He had seen the newspaper report of the first examination , and had volunteered to present himself as a witness . A member of Mr. Gracedieu 's congregation , his pew in the chapel was so situated as to give him a view of the minister 's daughters occupying their pew . He had seen the prisoner on every Sunday , for years past ; and he swore that he was passing the door of the chemist 's shop , at the moment when she stepped out into the street , having a bottle covered with the customary white paper in her hand . The doctor and his servant were the next witnesses called . They were severely cross - examined . Some of their statements - questioned technically with success - received unexpected and powerful support , due to the discovery and production of the prisoner 's diary . The entries , guardedly as some of them were written , revealed her motive for attempting to poison Philip Dunboyne ; proved that she had purposely called on the doctor when she knew that he would be out , that she had entered the consulting - room , and examined the medical books , had found to use her own written words "
138215	138467	137562	137562	they	1148	" and had used the prescription - papers for the purpose of making notes . The notes themselves were not to be found ; they had doubtless been destroyed . Enough , and more than enough , remained to make the case for the prosecution complete . The magistrates committed Helena Gracedieu for trial at the next assizes . I arrived in the town , as well as I can remember , about a week after the trial had taken place . Found guilty , the prisoner had been recommended to mercy by the jury - partly in consideration of her youth ; partly as an expression of sympathy and respect for her unhappy father . The judge a father himself passed a lenient sentence . She was condemned to imprisonment for two years . The careful matron of the jail had provided herself with a bottle of smelling - salts , in the fear that there might be need for it when Helena heard her sentence pronounced . Not the slightest sign of agitation appeared in her face or her manner . She lied to the last ; asserting her innocence in a firm voice , and returning from the dock to the prison without requiring assistance from anybody . Relating these particulars to me , in a state of ungovernable excitement , good Miss Jillgall ended with a little confession of her own , which operated as a relief to my overburdened mind after what I had just heard .

138666	138841	138663	138664	Miss Jillgall	140	" CHAPTER LXIII . THE OBSTACLE REMOVED . When the subject of the trial was happily dismissed , my first inquiry related to Eunice . The reply was made with an ominous accompaniment of sighs and sad looks . Eunice had gone back to her duties as governess at the farm . Hearing this , I asked naturally what had become of Philip . Melancholy news , again , was the news that I now heard . Mr. Dunboyne the elder had died suddenly , at his house in Ireland , while Philip was on his way home . When the funeral ceremony had come to an end , the will was read . It had been made only a few days before the testator 's death ; and the clause which left all his property to his son was preceded by expressions of paternal affection , at a time when Philip was in sore need of consolation . After alluding to a letter , received from his son , the old man added : "
138944	138945	138940	138940	God	38	" "
138954	138958	138947	138947	Philip	47	" I asked . "
138965	138966	138968	138968	he	47	" "
138989	138994	138985	138985	I	0	" Miss Jillgall continued , "
139051	139082	139012	139012	I	0	" Whatever I can do , Miss Jillgall , shall be gladly done . Is it really possible that Eunice refuses to marry him , after having saved his life ? "
139083	139124	139135	139136	the Minister	161	" A little patience , please , Mr. Governor ; let Philip tell his own story . If I try to do it , I shall only cry - and we have had tears enough lately , in this house . "
139191	139198	139199	139200	the man	3581	" You see it amuses him , "
139205	139239	139199	139200	the man	3581	" Do n't notice his mistakes , he thinks there is n't such another in the world for knitting as himself . You can see , sir , how he sticks to it . "
139318	139327	139328	139328	I	0	" Do n't you remember your old friend ? "
139342	139351	139331	139331	He	161	" Yes , yes , my old friend . "
139367	139373	139374	139375	the man	3581	" His memory is gone , "
139378	139451	139374	139375	the man	3581	" When he puts away his knitting , at night , I have to find it for him in the morning . But , there ! he 's happy - enjoys his victuals , likes sitting out in the garden and watching the birds . There 's been a deal of trouble in the family , sir ; and it has all passed over him like a wet sponge over a slate . "
139510	139517	139520	139521	some persons	3332	" It is to be envied . "
139691	139709	139710	139710	he	3336	" Do you remember how kindly you spoke to me when I called on you in London ? "
139713	139798	139710	139710	he	3336	" If I have repeated those words once - but perhaps you do n't remember them ? You said : ' If I was as young as you are , I should not despair . ' Well ! I have said that to myself over and over again , for a hundred times at least . Eunice will listen to you , sir , when she will listen to nobody else . This is the first happy moment I have had for weeks past . "
139888	139894	139895	139895	I	0	" Now , Mr. Philip , "
139898	139936	139895	139895	I	0	" I have been waiting , at Miss Jillgall 's suggestion , to get my information from you . There is something wrong between Eunice and yourself . What is it ? And who is to blame ? "
139937	139945	139946	139946	he	47	" Her vile sister is to blame , "
139949	139964	139965	139965	he	47	" That reptile was determined to sting us . And she has done it ! "
139992	140019	139965	139965	he	47	" I say , she has done it , after Eunice has saved me - done it , when Eunice was ready to be my wife . "
140020	140027	140032	140032	his	47	" How has she done it ? "
140077	140085	140086	140086	she	53	" If I consent to marry you , "
140089	140102	140086	140086	she	53	" I stain you with my disgrace ; that shall never be . "
140112	140120	140121	140121	Philip	47	" I have tried to convince her , "
140124	140244	140121	140121	Philip	47	" that she will not be associated with her sister 's disgrace when she bears my name ; I have promised to take her far away from England , among people who have never even heard of her sister . Miss Jillgall has used her influence to help me . All in vain ! There is no hope for us but in you . I am not thinking selfishly only of myself . She tries to conceal it - but , oh , she is broken - hearted ! Ask the farmer 's wife , if you do n't believe me . Judge for yourself , sir . Go - for God 's sake , go to the farm . "
140254	140265	140266	140266	I	0	" You may depend on my going to the farm , "
140269	140287	140266	140266	I	0	" I shall write to Eunice to - day , and follow my letter to - morrow . "
140301	140313	140314	140314	I	0	" Before I consent to accept the expression of your gratitude , "
140317	140380	140314	140314	I	0	" I must know a little more of you than I know now . This is only the second occasion on which we have met . Let us look back a little , Mr. Philip Dunboyne . You were Eunice 's affianced husband ; and you broke faith with her . That was a rascally action . How do you defend it ? "
140385	140393	140394	140394	he	3345	" I am ashamed to defend it , "
140403	140408	140409	140409	I	0	" You own yourself , "
140412	140420	140409	140409	I	0	" that it was a rascally action ? "
140421	140438	140397	140397	I	0	" Use stronger language against me , even than that , sir - I deserve it . "
140439	140444	140445	140445	I	0	" In plain words , "
140449	140459	140445	140445	I	0	" you can find no excuse for your conduct ? "
140460	140466	140467	140467	he	3345	" In the past time , "
140470	140477	140467	140467	he	3345	" I might have found excuses . "
140478	140487	140445	140445	I	0	" But you ca n't find them now ? "
140488	140498	140445	140445	I	0	" I must not even look for them now . "
140499	140503	140445	140445	I	0	" Why not ? "
140504	140529	140445	140445	I	0	" I owe it to Eunice to leave my conduct at its worst ; with nothing said - by me - to defend it . "
140530	140545	140445	140445	I	0	" What has Eunice done to have such a claim on you as that ? "
140546	140552	140445	140445	I	0	" Eunice has forgiven me . "
141533	141539	141540	141540	she	3369	" Have you seen Philip ? "
141649	141678	141639	141639	I	0	" My child , I know what a sacrifice you have made ; and I should honor your scruples , if you had any reason for feeling them . "
141679	141686	141687	141687	She	3369	" Any reason for feeling them ? "
141721	141735	141736	141736	I	0	" My dear , I am not putting you to any unfair trial , "
141740	141760	141736	141736	I	0	" I am going to prove that I love you as truly as if you were my own child . "
141805	141815	141816	141816	I	0	" I am here to make you both happy , "
141819	141881	141816	141816	I	0	" I can remove the only obstacle to your marriage , and I mean to do it . But I must insist on one condition . Give me your promise , Philip , that you will ask for no explanations , and that you will be satisfied with the one true statement which is all that I can offer to you . "
141894	141901	141902	141902	I	0	" Philip grants what I ask , "
141907	141915	141902	141902	I	0	" Do you grant it , too ? "
141931	141934	141924	141924	she	53	" Yes . "
141963	142046	141955	141955	my	0	" Rouse your courage , dear Eunice ; you are no more affected by Helena 's disgrace than I am . You are not her sister . Her father is not your father ; her mother was not your mother . I was present , in the time of your infancy , when Mr. Gracedieu 's fatherly kindness received you as his adopted child . This , I declare to you both , on my word of honor , is the truth . "
142244	142249	142250	142250	she	53	" Do n't think , "
142253	142332	142250	142250	she	53	" that I am forgetting my promise to be content with what you have told me about myself . I am not so ungrateful as that . But I do want , before I consent to be Philip 's wife , to feel sure that I am not quite unworthy of him . Is it because I am of mean birth that you told me I was Mr. Gracedieu 's adopted child - and told me no more ? "
142342	142346	142347	142347	I	0	" Certainly not ! "
142358	142364	142365	142365	she	3393	" Do you say that , "
142368	142386	142365	142365	she	3393	" to make my mind easy ? or do you say it on your word of honor ? "
142387	142394	142395	142395	We	3394	" On my word of honor . "
142414	142487	142409	142409	her	140	" No wedding breakfast , when you do n't want to eat it . No wedding speeches , when nobody wants to make them , and nobody wants to hear them . And no false sentiment , shedding tears and reddening noses , on the happiest day in the whole year . A model marriage ! I could desire nothing better , if I had any prospect of being a bride myself . "
142558	142563	142564	142564	she	53	" His adopted daughter , "
142569	142576	142564	142564	she	53	" is his only daughter now . "
142934	142937	142931	142932	My servant	3411	" a lady "
142965	142974	142975	142975	she	49	" I have heard it all from Selina , "
142978	143137	142975	142975	she	49	" Philip 's marriage to Eunice I shall go and congratulate them , of course , and the catastrophe how dramatic ! of Helena Gracedieu . I warned . Selina that Miss Helena would end badly . To tell the truth , she frightened me . I do n't deny that I am a mischievous woman when I find myself affronted , quite capable of taking my revenge in my own small spiteful way . But poison and murder - ah , the frightful subject ! let us drop it , and talk of something that does n't make my hair it 's really my own hair stand on end . Has Selina told you that I have got rid of my charming husband , on easy pecuniary terms ? Oh , you know that ? Very well . I will tell you something that you do n't know . Mr. Governor , I have found you out . "
143138	143146	142951	142951	She	49	" May I venture to ask how ? "
143147	143159	143160	143160	she	3412	" When I guessed which was which of those two girls , "
143163	143337	143160	143160	she	3412	" and guessed wrong , you deliberately encouraged the mistake . Very clever , but you overdid it . From that moment , though I kept it to myself , I began to fear I might be wrong . Do you remember Low Lanes , my dear sir ? A charming old church . I have had another consultation with my lawyer . His questions led me into mentioning how it happened that I heard of Low Lanes . After looking again at his memorandum of the birth advertised in the newspaper without naming the place - he proposed trying the church register at Low Lanes . Need I tell you the result ? I know , as well as you do , that Philip has married the adopted child . He has had a mother - in - law who was hanged , and , what is more , he has the honor , through his late father , of being otherwise connected with the murderess by marriage - as his aunt ! "
143349	143356	143357	143357	I	0	" How did you discover that ? "
143364	143377	143378	143378	she	3413	" Do you remember when I brought the baby to the prison ? "
143381	143443	143378	143378	she	3413	" The father - as I mentioned at the time - had been a dear and valued friend of mine . No person could be better qualified to tell me who had married his wife 's sister . If that lady had been living , I should never have been troubled with the charge of the child . Any more questions ? "
143444	143455	143536	143536	Philip	47	" Only one . Is Philip to hear of this ? "
143456	143520	143378	143378	she	3413	" Oh , for shame ! I do n't deny that Philip insulted me grossly , in one way ; and that Philip 's late father insulted me grossly , in another way . But Mamma Tenbruggen is a Christian . She returns good for evil , and would n't for the world disturb the connubial felicity of Mr. and Mrs. Philip Dunboyne . "
143697	143701	143694	143694	she	53	" Not yet . "
143718	143726	143727	143727	she	53	" I shall never be quite happy , "
143730	143765	143727	143727	she	53	" till I know what it is that you kept from me on that memorable day . I do n't like having a secret from my husband - though it is not my secret . "
143766	143771	143772	143772	I	0	" Remember your promise , "
143774	143781	143782	143782	she	53	" I do n't forget it , "
143785	143807	143782	143782	she	53	" I can only wish that my promise would keep back the thoughts that come to me in spite of myself . "
143808	143812	143727	143727	she	53	" What thoughts ? "
143813	143858	143727	143727	she	53	" There is something , as I fear , in the story of my parents which you are afraid to confide to me . Why did Mr. Gracedieu allow me to believe and leave everybody to believe , that I was his own child ? "
143859	143877	143782	143782	she	53	" My dear , I relieved your mind of those doubts on the morning of your marriage . "
143878	143906	143727	143727	she	53	" No . I was only thinking of myself at that time . My mother - the doubt of her is the doubt that torments me now . "
143907	143913	143914	143914	She	3425	" What do you mean ? "
143929	143935	143936	143936	she	3425	" The mock - mother ! "
143939	144012	143936	143936	she	3425	" Do you remember that dreadful Vision , that horrid whispering temptation in the dead of night ? Was it a mock - mother ? Oh , pity me ! I do n't know who my mother was . One horrid thought about her is a burden on my mind . If she was a good woman , you who love me would surely have made me happy by speaking of her ? "
144071	144081	144082	144082	she	3425	" Does it beat as if I was frightened ? "
144092	144099	144100	144100	It	3427	" Does it relieve your anxiety ? "
144138	144142	144143	144143	I	0	" I know , "
144146	144226	144143	144143	I	0	" that those whispered temptations overpowered you again , when you and Helena met on the stairs , and you forbade her to enter Philip 's room . And I know that love had conquered once more , when you were next seen sitting by Philip 's bedside . Tell me - have you any misgivings now ? Is there fear in your heart of the return of that tempting spirit in you , in the time to come ? "
144227	144233	144237	144237	her	3425	" Not while Philip lives ! "
144263	144268	144256	144256	I	0	" To tell Philip , "
144290	144295	144296	144296	I	0	" Is it done ? "
144299	144304	144305	144305	she	3425	" It is done , "
144308	144314	144305	144305	she	3425	" What did he say ? "
144315	144342	144343	144343	I	0	" He said : ' My darling , if I could be fonder of you than ever , I should be fonder of you now . ' "
144437	144440	144441	144441	she	49	" Somebody , "
144444	144452	144441	144441	she	49	" has told you of it already ? "
144457	144463	144454	144454	Philip	47	" Yes ; my wife . "
144481	144500	144476	144476	he	63	" I want to teach you to knit . Sit by me , and see me do it . "
144526	144534	144523	144523	him	63	" How pleasant it is to sleep ! "
144789	144797	144798	144798	she	140	" Do you recognize the illustrious original ? "
144814	144821	144822	144823	Miss Jillgall	140	" Now read her new title , "
144829	144835	144826	144826	I	0	" The Reverend Miss Gracedieu . "
144846	144979	144987	144988	Miss Jillgall	140	" This eminent lady , the victim of a shocking miscarriage of justice in England , is now the distinguished leader of a new community in the United States . We hail in her the great intellect which asserts the superiority of woman over man . In the first French Revolution , the attempt made by men to found a rational religion met with only temporary success . It was reserved for the mightier spirit of woman to lay the foundations more firmly , and to dedicate one of the noblest edifices in this city to the Worship of Pure Reason . Readers who wish for further information will do well to provide themselves with the Reverend Miss Gracedieu 's Orations - the tenth edition of which is advertised in our columns . "
144980	144986	144987	144988	Miss Jillgall	140	" I once asked you , "
144992	145024	144987	144988	Miss Jillgall	140	" what Helena would do when she came out of prison , and you said she would do very well . Oh , Mr. Governor , Solomon was nothing to You ! "
