324	371	313	313	his	328	" Why in God 's name , should this injustice be ? Why should a worthless lounger have his pockets full of gold by mere chance and heritage , while I , toiling wearily from morn till midnight , can scarce afford myself a satisfying meal ? "
1949	1954	1956	1956	he	396	" I 'm sorry , "
1958	2051	1956	1956	he	396	" very sorry , but my readers are quite unanimous . From what I can learn , it seems to me you have been too earnest . And also , rather sarcastic in certain strictures against society . My dear fellow , that wo n't do . Never blame society , - it buys books ! Now if you could write a smart love - story , slightly risqué , - even a little more than risqué for that matter ; that is the sort of thing that suits the present age . "
2052	2056	2057	2057	I	0	" Pardon me , "
2062	2074	2057	2057	I	0	" but are you sure you judge the public taste correctly ? "
2097	2104	2106	2106	he	396	" Of course I am sure , "
2109	2161	2164	2164	he	396	" It is my business to know the public taste as thoroughly as I know my own pocket . Understand me , - I do n't suggest that you should write a book on any positively indecent subject , - that can be safely left to the ' New ' woman , "
2168	2225	2164	2164	he	396	" but I assure you high - class fiction does n't sell . The critics do n't like it , to begin with . What goes down with them and with the public is a bit of sensational realism told in terse newspaper English . Literary English , - Addisonian English , - is a mistake . "
2226	2236	2237	2237	I	0	" And I am also a mistake I think , "
2244	2296	2237	2237	I	0	" At any rate if what you say be true , I must lay down the pen and try another trade . I am old - fashioned enough to consider Literature as the highest of all professions , and I would rather not join in with those who voluntarily degrade it . "
2311	2316	2317	2317	he	396	" Well , well ! "
2321	2345	2317	2317	he	396	" you are a little quixotic . That will wear off . Will you come on to my club and dine with me ? "
3149	3158	3159	3159	I	0	" Of course it will be a refusal , "
3166	3255	3159	3159	I	0	" However kindly a friend may otherwise be , he soon turns crusty if asked to lend money . He will express many regrets , accuse trade and the general bad times and hope I will soon ' tide over . ' I know the sort of thing . Well , - after all , why should I expect him to be different to other men ? I 've no claim on him beyond the memory of a few sentimental arm - in - arm days at Oxford . "

3648	3786	3639	3639	I	0	" practising away on that friendly fiddle of yours , - no doubt for a mere pittance which barely keeps you alive . Possibly you are some poor wretch in a cheap orchestra , - or you might even be a street - player and be able to live in this neighbourhood of the élite starving , - you can have no hope whatever of being the ' fashion ' and making your bow before Royalty , - or if you have that hope , it is wildly misplaced . Play on , my friend , play on ! - the sounds you make are very agreeable , and seem to imply that you are happy . I wonder if you are ? - or if , like me , you are going rapidly to the devil ! "

The larger bulk of the cash is lodged in the Bank of England , and a considerable amount is placed in French government securities . We should prefer going into further details with you personally rather than by letter . Trusting you will call on us without delay , we are , Sir , yours obediently .... "

And as for the new Mæcenas you are sending to help me over my difficulties , - well , he may be a very excellent old gentleman , but he will find himself quite out of his element this time . I want neither assistance nor advice nor patronage , - I can buy them all ! Titles , honours , possessions , - they are all purchaseable , - love , friendship , position , - they are all for sale in this admirably commercial age and go to the highest bidder ! By my soul ! - The wealthy ' philanthropist ' will find it difficult to match me in power ! He will scarcely have more than five millions to waste , I warrant ! And now for supper , - I shall have to live on credit till I get some ready cash , - and there is no reason why I should not leave this wretched hole at once , and go to one of the best hotels and swagger it !

6918	6971	6915	6915	she	401	" I 'm afraid Mr Tempest is n't in after all , sir , though I certainly saw him about half - an - hour ago . If you do n't mind waiting here a minute I 'll fetch a light and see if he has left any message on his table . "

7165	7235	7162	7162	I	0	" And being here I am ashamed to give you such a welcome as this . You are Prince Rimânez of course ; - I have just read your note which prepared me for your visit , but I was hoping that my landlady , finding the room in darkness , would conclude I was out , and show you downstairs again . You see I am perfectly frank ! "
7236	7241	7243	7244	the stranger	498	" You are indeed ! "
7259	7290	7246	7246	his	498	" So frank that I can not fail to understand you . Briefly , and without courtesy , you resent my visit this evening and wish I had not come ! "
7326	7335	7337	7337	I	0	" Pray do not think me so churlish , "
7340	7397	7337	7337	I	0	" The fact is , I only opened your letter a few minutes ago , and before I could make any arrangements to receive you , the lamp went out , with the awkward result that I am forced to greet you in this unsociable darkness , which is almost too dense to shake hands in . "
7398	7403	7416	7416	his	497	" Shall we try ? "
7422	7449	7416	7416	his	497	" Here is my hand , - if yours has any friendly instinct in it the twain will meet , - quite blindly and without guidance ! "

7936	7989	7933	7933	he	501	" I always do ! It is my peculiar misfortune . Well - bred people never intrude where they are not wanted , - and in this particular I 'm afraid my manners leave much to be desired . Try to forgive me if you can , for the sake of this , "
8008	8021	7992	7992	he	501	" And permit me to sit down while you read my credentials . "
8042	8048	8049	8049	I	0	" No credentials are necessary , "
8060	8117	8049	8049	I	0	" I have already had a letter from Carrington in which he speaks of you in the highest and most grateful terms . But the fact is - - well ! - really , prince , you must excuse me if I seem confused or astonished ... I had expected to see quite an old man ... "

8156	8247	8152	8152	he	501	" even the grandmothers and grandfathers are friskier at fifty than they were at fifteen . One does not talk of age at all now in polite society , - it is ill - bred , even coarse . Indecent things are unmentionable - age has become an indecent thing . It is therefore avoided in conversation . You expected to see an old man you say ? Well , you are not disappointed - I am old . In fact you have no idea how very old I am ! "
8256	8265	8267	8267	I	0	" Why , you are younger than I , "
8270	8279	8267	8267	I	0	" or if not , you look it . "

8293	8334	8289	8289	he	501	" I am like several of the most noted fashionable beauties , - much riper than I seem . But come , read the introductory missive I have brought you , - I shall not be satisfied till you do . "
8726	8804	8720	8720	I	0	" This letter , prince , adds to my shame and regret that I should have greeted you in so churlish a manner this evening . No apology can condone my rudeness , - but you can not imagine how mortified I felt and still feel , to be compelled to receive you in this miserable den , - it is not at all the sort of place in which I should have liked to welcome you .... "
8853	8858	8859	8859	he	529	" Why be mortified ? "
8862	8897	8859	8859	he	529	" Rather be proud that you can dispense with the vulgar appurtenances of luxury . Genius thrives in a garret and dies in a palace , - is not that the generally accepted theory ? "
8898	8910	8912	8912	I	0	" Rather a worn - out and mistaken one I consider , "
8915	8936	8912	8912	I	0	" Genius might like to try the effect of a palace for once , - it usually dies of starvation . "
8937	9018	9019	9019	He	529	" True ! - but in thus dying , think how many fools it afterwards fattens ! There is an all - wise Providence in this , my dear sir ! Schubert perished of want , - but see what large profits all the music - publishers have made since out of his compositions ! It is a most beautiful dispensation of nature , - that honest folk should be sacrificed in order to provide for the sustenance of knaves ! "
9051	9058	9059	9059	I	0	" You speak sarcastically of course ? "
9062	9072	9059	9059	I	0	" You do not really believe what you say ? "
9073	9080	9081	9081	he	529	" Oh , do I not ! "
9101	9199	9088	9088	his	529	" If I could not believe the teaching of my own experience , what would be left to me ? I always realize the ' needs must ' of things - how does the old maxim go - ' needs must when the devil drives . ' There is really no possible contradiction to offer to the accuracy of that statement . The devil drives the world , whip in hand , - and oddly enough , considering that some belated folk still fancy there is a God somewhere succeeds in managing his team with extraordinary ease ! "
9223	9297	9216	9216	he	529	" But let us not moralize , - morals sicken the soul both in church and out of it , - every sensible man hates to be told what he could be and what he wo n't be . I am here to make friends with you if you permit , - and to put an end to ceremony , will you accompany me back to my hotel where I have ordered supper ? "
9356	9360	9361	9361	I	0	" With pleasure ! "
9364	9495	9361	9361	I	0	" But first of all , you must allow me to explain matters a little . You have heard a good deal about my affairs from my friend John Carrington , and I know from his private letter to me that you have come here out of pure kindness and goodwill . For that generous intention I thank you ! I know you expected to find a poor wretch of a literary man struggling with the direst circumstances of disappointment and poverty , - and a couple of hours ago you would have amply fulfilled that expectation . But now , things have changed , - I have received news which completely alters my position , - in fact I have had a very great and remarkable surprise this evening .... "
9496	9503	9505	9506	my companion	531	" An agreeable one I trust ? "
9512	9517	9519	9519	I	0	" Judge for yourself ! "
9554	9562	9564	9564	he	531	" I suppose I should congratulate you , "
9567	9649	9564	9564	he	531	" And I do . Though of course this wealth which seems to content you , to me appears a mere trifle . It can be quite conveniently run through and exhausted in about eight years or less , therefore it does not provide absolute immunity from care . To be rich , really rich , in my sense of the word , one should have about a million a year . Then one might reasonably hope to escape the workhouse ! "
9693	9888	9889	9889	He	533	" The inexhaustible greed of a man , my dear sir , can never be satisfied . If he is not consumed by desire for one thing , he is for another , and his tastes are generally expensive . A few pretty and unscrupulous women for example , would soon relieve you of your five millions in the purchase of jewels alone . Horse - racing would do it still more quickly . No , no , - you are not rich , - you are still poor , - only your needs are no longer so pressing as they were . And in this I confess myself somewhat disappointed , - for I came to you hoping to do a good turn to some one for once in my life , and to play the foster - father to a rising genius - and here I am - forestalled , - as usual ! It is a singular thing , do you know , but nevertheless a fact , that whenever I have had any particular intentions towards a man I am always forestalled ! It is really rather hard upon me ! "
9901	9906	9907	9907	he	533	" What is that ? "
9921	9925	9926	9926	I	0	" Ave Maria . "
9931	9938	9939	9939	he	533	" Dismal , - very dismal ! "
9946	10006	9939	9939	he	533	" I hate all that kind of mawkish devotional stuff . Well ! - millionaire as you are , and acknowledged lion of society as you shortly will be , there is no objection I hope , to the proposed supper ? And perhaps a music - hall afterwards if you feel inclined , - what do you say ? "
10098	10109	10110	10110	I	0	" I am not fit to accompany you , prince , "
10113	10124	10110	10110	I	0	" I look more like a tramp than a millionaire . "
10132	10141	10142	10142	he	533	" Upon my life , so you do ! "
10146	10243	10244	10244	He	533	" But be satisfied ! - you are in this respect very like many another Croesus . It is only the poor and proud who take the trouble to dress well , - they and the dear ' naughty ' ladies , generally monopolize tasteful and becoming attire . An ill - fitting coat often adorns the back of a Prime Minister , - and if you see a woman clad in clothes vilely cut and coloured , you may be sure she is eminently virtuous , renowned for good works , and probably a duchess ! "
10253	10264	10265	10265	he	533	" What matter the coat if the purse be full ! "
10270	10401	10265	10265	he	533	" Let it once be properly paragraphed in the papers that you are a millionaire , and doubtless some enterprising tailor will invent a ' Tempest ' ulster coloured softly like your present garb , an artistic mildewy green ! And now come along , - your solicitor 's communication should have given you a good appetite , or it is not so valuable as it seems , - and I want you to do justice to my supper . I have my own chef with me , and he is not without skill . I hope , by the way , you will at least do me this much service , - that pending legal discussion and settlement of your affairs , you will let me be your banker ? "
11005	11017	11018	11018	he	555	" Do you not feel the world already at your feet ? "
11026	11108	11018	11018	he	555	" Like a football , waiting to be kicked ? It is such an absurd world , you know - so easily moved . Wise men in all ages have done their best to make it less ridiculous , - with no result , inasmuch as it continues to prefer folly to wisdom . A football , or let us say a shuttlecock among worlds , ready to be tossed up anyhow and anywhere , provided the battledore be of gold ! "
11109	11117	11119	11119	I	0	" You speak a trifle bitterly , prince "
11122	11135	11119	11119	I	0	" But no doubt you have had a wide experience among men ? "
11136	11140	11141	11141	he	555	" I have , "
11146	11154	11141	11141	he	555	" My kingdom is a vast one . "
11155	11163	11164	11164	I	0	" You are a ruling power then ? "
11170	11180	11164	11164	I	0	" Yours is not a title of honour only ? "
11181	11198	11200	11200	he	555	" Oh , as your rules of aristocracy go , it is a mere title of honour "
11204	11251	11200	11200	he	555	" When I say that my kingdom is a vast one , I mean that I rule wherever men obey the influence of wealth . From this point of view , am I wrong in calling my kingdom vast ? - is it not almost boundless ? "
11252	11260	11262	11262	I	0	" I perceive you are a cynic , "
11265	11287	11262	11262	I	0	" Yet surely you believe that there are some things wealth can not buy , - honour and virtue for example ? "
11296	11305	11306	11306	he	555	" I suppose honour and virtue do exist - "
11309	11580	11288	11288	He	555	" And when they are existent of course they can not be bought . But my experience has taught me that I can always buy everything . The sentiments called honour and virtue by the majority of men are the most shifty things imaginable , - set sufficient cash down , and they become bribery and corruption in the twinkling of an eye ! Curious - very curious . I confess I found a case of unpurchaseable integrity once , but only once . I may find it again , though I consider the chance a very doubtful one . Now to revert to myself , pray do not imagine I am playing the humbug with you or passing myself off under a bogus title . I am a bona - fide prince , believe me , and of such descent as none of your oldest families can boast , - but my dominions are long since broken up and my former subjects dispersed among all nations , - anarchy , nihilism , disruption and political troubles generally , compel me to be rather reticent concerning my affairs . Money I fortunately have in plenty , - and with that I pave my way . Some day when we are better acquainted , you shall know more of my private history . I have various other names and titles besides that on my card - but I keep to the simplest of them , because most people are such bunglers at the pronunciation of foreign names . My intimate friends generally drop my title , and call me Lucio simply . "
11581	11589	11590	11590	I	0	" That is your christian name - ? "
11593	11606	11608	11608	he	556	" Not at all - I have no ' christian ' name , "
11615	11629	11608	11608	he	556	" There is no such thing as ' christian ' in my composition ! "
11651	11654	11655	11655	I	0	" Indeed ! "
11664	11748	11659	11659	He	556	" ' Indeed ! ' That is all you can find to say ! Indeed and again indeed the word ' christian ' vexes me . There is no such creature alive . You are not a Christian , - no one is really , - people pretend to be , - and in so damnable an act of feigning are more blasphemous than any fallen fiend ! Now I make no pretences of the kind , - I have only one faith - "
11749	11754	11659	11659	He	556	" And that is ? "
11756	11763	11764	11764	he	556	" A profound and awful one ! "
11770	11860	11764	11764	he	556	" And the worst of it is that it is true , - as true as the workings of the Universe . But of that hereafter , - it will do to talk of when we feel low - spirited and wish to converse of things grim and ghastly , - at present here we are at our destination , and the chief consideration of our lives , it is the chief consideration of most men 's lives must be the excellence or non - excellence of our food . "
11952	11963	11965	11965	he	529	" Oh , my man will see to that for you "
11969	11997	11965	11965	he	529	" The house is not full , - at anyrate all the best rooms are not taken ; and of course you want one of the best . "
12519	12535	12536	12536	he	592	" Will you continue your literary career now you have this little fortune left you ? "
12559	12572	12545	12545	Amiel	141	" Do you think you will care to go on with it ? "
12573	12577	12579	12579	I	0	" Certainly I shall "
12582	12618	12579	12579	I	0	" if only for the fun of the thing . You see , with money I can force my name into notice whether the public like it or not . No newspaper refuses paying advertisements . "
12619	12639	12545	12545	Amiel	141	" True ! - but may not inspiration refuse to flow from a full purse and an empty head ? "
12648	12657	12658	12658	I	0	" Do you consider me empty - headed ? "
12664	12864	12545	12545	Amiel	141	" Not at present . My dear Tempest , do not let either the Tokay we have been drinking , or the cognac we are going to drink , speak for you in such haste ! I assure you I do not think you empty - headed , - on the contrary , your head , I believe from what I have heard , has been and is full of ideas , - excellent ideas , original ideas , which the world of conventional criticism does not want . But whether these ideas will continue to germinate in your brain , or whether , with the full purse , they will cease , is now the question . Great originality and inspiration , strange to say , seldom endow the millionaire . Inspiration is supposed to come from above , - money from below ! In your case however both originality and inspiration may continue to flourish and bring forth fruit , - I trust they may . It often happens , nevertheless that when bags of money fall to the lot of aspiring genius , God departs and the devil walks in . Have you never heard that ? "
12865	12868	12869	12869	I	0	" Never ! "
12873	12934	12545	12545	Amiel	141	" Well , of course the saying is foolish , and sounds doubly ridiculous in this age when people believe in neither God nor devil . It implies however that one must choose an up or a down , - genius is the Up , money is the Down . You can not fly and grovel at the same instant . "
12935	12949	12951	12951	I	0	" The possession of money is not likely to cause a man to grovel "
12954	12974	12951	12951	I	0	" It is the one thing necessary to strengthen his soaring powers and lift him to the greatest heights . "
12975	12980	12982	12983	my host	576	" You think so ? "
12996	13183	12982	12983	my host	576	" Then I 'm afraid , you do n't know much about what I shall call natural psychics . What belongs to the earth tends earthwards , - surely you realize that ? Gold most strictly belongs to the earth , - you dig it out of the ground , - you handle it and dispose of it in solid wedges or bars - it is a substantial metal enough . Genius belongs to nobody knows where , - you can not dig it up or pass it on , or do anything with it except stand and marvel - it is a rare visitant and capricious as the wind , and generally makes sad havoc among the conventionalities of men . It is as I said an ' upper ' thing , beyond earthly smells and savours , - and those who have it always live in unknown high latitudes . But money is a perfectly level commodity , - level with the ground ; - when you have much of it , you come down solidly on your flat soles and down you stay ! "
13187	13198	13199	13199	I	0	" Upon my word you preach very eloquently against wealth ! "
13202	13216	13199	13199	I	0	" You yourself are unusually rich , - are you sorry for it ? "
13217	13232	13234	13234	he	599	" No , I am not sorry , because being sorry would be no use "
13237	13293	13234	13234	he	599	" And I never waste my time . But I am telling you the truth - Genius and great riches hardly ever pull together . Now I , for example , - you can not imagine what great capabilities I had once ! - a long time ago - before I became my own master ! "
13294	13303	13305	13305	I	0	" And you have them still I am sure "
13333	13342	13343	13343	he	599	" Ah , you mean to compliment me ! "
13346	13531	13343	13343	he	599	" You like my looks , - many people do . Yet after all there is nothing so deceptive as one 's outward appearance . The reason of this is that as soon as childhood is past , we are always pretending to be what we are not , - and thus , with constant practice from our youth up , we manage to make our physical frames complete disguises for our actual selves . It is really wise and clever of us , - for hence each individual is so much flesh - wall through which neither friend nor enemy can spy . Every man is a solitary soul imprisoned in a self - made den , - when he is quite alone he knows and frequently hates himself , - sometimes he even gets afraid of the gaunt and murderous monster he keeps hidden behind his outwardly pleasant body - mask , and hastens to forget its frightful existence in drink and debauchery . That is what I do occasionally , - you would not think it of me , would you ? "
13532	13535	13536	13536	I	0	" Never ! "
13551	13562	13536	13536	I	0	" You belie yourself , and wrong your own nature . "
13567	13572	13573	13573	he	600	" Perhaps I do ! "
13577	13665	13573	13573	he	600	" This much you may believe of me - that I am no worse than most men ! Now to return to the subject of your literary career , - you have written a book , you say , - well , publish it and see the result - if you only make one ' hit ' that is something . And there are ways of arranging that the ' hit ' shall be made . What is your story about ? I hope it is improper ? "
13666	13672	13674	13674	I	0	" It certainly is not ; "
13678	13727	13674	13674	I	0	" It is a romance dealing with the noblest forms of life and highest ambitions ; - I wrote it with the intention of elevating and purifying the thoughts of my readers , and wished if I could , to comfort those who had suffered loss or sorrow - "
13732	13740	13741	13741	he	600	" Ah , it wo n't do ! "
13744	13947	13741	13741	he	600	" I assure you it wo n't ; - it does n't fit the age . It might go down , possibly , if you could give a ' first - night ' of it as it were to the critics , like one of my most intimate friends , Henry Irving , - a ' first - night ' combined with an excellent supper and any amount of good drinks going . Otherwise it 's no use . If it is to succeed by itself , it must not attempt to be literature , - it must simply be indecent . As indecent as you can make it without offending advanced women , - that is giving you a good wide margin . Put in as much as you can about sexual matters and the bearing of children , - in brief , discourse of men and women simply as cattle who exist merely for breeding purposes , and your success will be enormous . There 's not a critic living who wo n't applaud you , - there 's not a school - girl of fifteen who will not gloat over your pages in the silence of her virginal bedroom ! "
13980	14190	13976	13976	he	601	" What put it into your head , my dear Tempest , to write a book dealing with , as you say , ' the noblest forms of life ' ? There are no noble forms of life left on this planet , - it is all low and commercial , - man is a pigmy , and his aims are pigmy like himself . For noble forms of life seek other worlds ! - there are others . Then again , people do n't want their thoughts raised or purified in the novels they read for amusement - they go to church for that , and get very bored during the process . And why should you wish to comfort folks who , out of their own sheer stupidity generally , get into trouble ? They would n't comfort you , - they would not give you sixpence to save you from starvation . My good fellow , leave your quixotism behind you with your poverty . Live your life to yourself , - if you do anything for others they will only treat you with the blackest ingratitude , - so take my advice , and do n't sacrifice your own personal interests for any consideration whatever . "
14236	14250	14252	14252	I	0	" If you were not so good - looking I should call you heartless "
14257	14313	14252	14252	I	0	" But your features are a direct contradiction to your words . You have not really that indifference to human nature which you strive to assume , - your whole aspect betokens a generosity of spirit which you can not conquer if you would . Besides , are you not always trying to do good ? "
14317	14383	14314	14314	He	602	" Always ! That is , I am always at work endeavouring to gratify every man 's desire . Whether that is good of me , or bad , remains to be proved . Men 's wants are almost illimitable , - the only thing none of them ever seem to wish , so far as I am concerned , is to cut my acquaintance ! "
14384	14400	14401	14401	I	0	" Why , of course not ! After once meeting you , how could they ! "
14421	14429	14430	14430	he	602	" Their desires are not always virtuous , "
14446	14459	14460	14460	I	0	" But of course you do not gratify them in their vices ! "
14466	14480	14460	14460	I	0	" That would be playing the part of a benefactor somewhat too thoroughly ! "
14481	14499	14501	14501	he	602	" Ah now I see we shall flounder in the quicksands of theory if we go any further "
14504	14700	14501	14501	he	602	" You forget , my dear fellow , that nobody can decide as to what is vice , or what is virtue . These things are chameleon - like , and take different colours in different countries . Abraham had two or three wives and several concubines , and he was the very soul of virtue according to sacred lore , - whereas my Lord Tom - Noddy in London to - day has one wife and several concubines , and is really very much like Abraham in other particulars , yet he is considered a very dreadful person . ' Who shall decide when doctors disagree ! ' Let 's drop the subject , as we shall never settle it . What shall we do with the rest of the evening ? There is a stout - limbed , shrewd wench at the Tivoli , dancing her way into the affections of a ricketty little Duke , - shall we go and watch the admirable contortions with which she is wriggling into a fixed position among the English aristocracy ? Or are you tired , and would you prefer a long night 's rest ? "
14743	14758	14759	14759	I	0	" Upon my word I think I would rather go to bed than anything - "
14762	14769	14759	14759	I	0	" But what about my room ? "
14770	14788	14790	14790	he	603	" Oh , Amiel will have attended to that for you , - we 'll ask him . "
14800	14810	14759	14759	I	0	" Have you got a room for Mr Tempest ? "
14811	14854	14795	14795	His	603	" Yes , your Excellency . An apartment in this corridor almost facing your Excellency 's suite . It is not as well furnished as it might be , but I have made it as comfortable as I can for the night . "
14855	14860	14861	14861	I	0	" Thanks very much ! "
14864	14872	14861	14861	I	0	" I am greatly obliged to you . "
14877	14883	14884	14884	He	141	" Thank you , sir . "
14917	14925	14926	14926	he	141	" I like you , Geoffrey Tempest ; "
14929	15133	15136	15136	he	606	" And because I like you , and because I think there are the makings of something higher than mere earthy brute in you , I am going to make you what you may perhaps consider rather a singular proposition . It is this , - that if you do n't like me , say so at once , and we will part now , before we have time to know anything more of each other , and I will endeavour not to cross your path again unless you seek me out . But if on the contrary , you do like me , - if you find something in my humour or turn of mind congenial to your own disposition , give me your promise that you will be my friend and comrade for a while , say for a few months at any rate . I can take you into the best society , and introduce you to the prettiest women in Europe as well as the most brilliant men . I know them all , and I believe I can be useful to you . But if there is the smallest aversion to me lurking in the depths of your nature "
15146	15178	15136	15136	he	606	" in God 's name give it full way and let me go , - because I swear to you in all sober earnest that I am not what I seem ! "
15260	15271	15272	15272	I	0	" My dear fellow , your warning comes too late ! "
15276	15370	15272	15272	I	0	" Whatever you are , or whatever you choose to think you are , I find you most sympathetic to my disposition , and I consider myself most fortunate in knowing you . My old friend Carrington has indeed done me a good turn in bringing us together , and I assure you I shall be proud of your companionship . You seem to take a perverse delight in running yourself down ! - but you know the old adage , ' the devil is not so black as he is painted ' ? "
15371	15377	15378	15378	he	608	" And that is true ! "
15382	15405	15378	15378	he	608	" Poor devil ! His faults are no doubt much exaggerated by the clergy ! And so we are to be friends ? "
15406	15422	15272	15272	I	0	" I hope so ! I shall not be the first to break the compact ! "
15444	15450	15452	15452	he	608	" Compact is a good word "
15455	15521	15452	15452	he	608	" So , - a compact we will consider it . I meant to improve your material fortunes , - you can dispense with that aid now ; but I think I can still be of service in pushing you on in society . And love - of course you will fall in love if you have not already done so , - have you ? "
15522	15526	15527	15527	I	0	" Not I ! "
15535	15550	15527	15527	I	0	" I have seen no woman yet who perfectly fulfils my notions of beauty . "
15557	15568	15569	15569	he	608	" Upon my word you are not wanting in audacity ! "
15572	15609	15569	15569	he	608	" Nothing but perfect beauty will suit you , eh ? But consider , my friend , you , though a good - looking well - built man , are not yourself quite a Phoebus Apollo ! "
15610	15619	15621	15621	I	0	" That has nothing to do with the matter "
15624	15657	15621	15621	I	0	" A man should choose a wife with a careful eye to his own personal gratification , in the same way that he chooses horses or wine , - perfection or nothing . "
15658	15663	15665	15665	Rimânez	124	" And the woman ? "
15672	15681	15683	15683	I	0	" The woman has really no right of choice "
15702	15751	15694	15694	I	0	" She must mate wherever she has the chance of being properly maintained . A man is always a man , - a woman is only a man 's appendage , and without beauty she can not put forth any just claim to his admiration or his support . "
15752	15763	15765	15765	he	608	" Right ! - very right , and logically argued ! "
15775	15909	15765	15765	he	608	" I myself have no sympathy with the new ideas that are in vogue concerning the intellectuality of woman . She is simply the female of man , - she has no real soul save that which is a reflex of his , and being destitute of logic , she is incapable of forming a correct opinion on any subject . All the imposture of religion is kept up by this unmathematical hysterical creature , - and it is curious , considering how inferior a being she is , what mischief she has contrived to make in the world , upsetting the plans of the wisest kings and counsellors , who as mere men , should undoubtedly have mastered her ! And in the present age she is becoming more than ever unmanageable . "
15910	15917	15919	15919	I	0	" It is only a passing phase "
15923	15955	15919	15919	I	0	" A fad got up by a few unloved and unlovable types of the feminine sex . I care very little for women - I doubt whether I shall ever marry . "
15956	15976	15978	15978	he	609	" Well you have plenty of time to consider , and amuse yourself with the fair ones , en passant "
15984	16101	15978	15978	he	609	" And in the meantime I can take you round the different marriage - markets of the world if you choose , though the largest one of them all is of course this very metropolis . Splendid bargains to be had , my dear friend ! - wonderful blonde and brunette specimens going really very cheap . We 'll examine them at our leisure . I 'm glad you have yourself decided that we are to be comrades , - for I am proud ; - I may say damnably proud ; - and never stay in any man 's company when he expresses the slightest wish to be rid of me . Good - night ! "
16102	16107	16108	16108	I	0	" Good - night ! "
16188	16193	16194	16194	he	529	" What a storm ! "
16198	16209	16194	16194	he	529	" Such thunder in winter is rather unusual . Amiel ! "
16227	16234	16237	16238	his master	548	" These lamps have gone out , "
16240	16269	16237	16238	his master	548	" It 's very odd that civilized humanity has not yet learned the complete management of the electric light . Can you put them in order , Amiel ? "
16270	16276	16333	16333	Rimânez	124	" Yes , your excellency . "
16323	16330	16333	16333	Rimânez	124	" Really remarkable weather for January , "
16341	16351	16333	16333	Rimânez	124	" Good - night my friend ! Sleep well . "
16352	16362	16363	16363	I	0	" If the anger of the elements will permit ! "
16368	16413	16333	16333	Rimânez	124	" Oh , never mind the elements . Man has nearly mastered them or soon will do so , now that he is getting gradually convinced there is no Deity to interfere in his business . Amiel , show Mr Tempest to his room . "
16511	16522	16523	16523	he	141	" Is there anything I can do for you sir ? "
16526	16531	16533	16533	I	0	" No thank you , "
16562	16576	16552	16553	this man	592	" you have been very attentive , - I shall not forget it . "
16585	16597	16582	16582	his	141	" Much obliged to you , sir . Good - night . "
16749	16759	16760	16760	I	0	" Geoffrey Tempest , the world is before you - "
16767	16891	16760	16760	I	0	" you are a young man , - you have health , a good appearance , and brains , - added to these you now have five millions of money , and a wealthy prince for your friend . What more do you want of Fate or Fortune ? Nothing , - except fame ! And that you will get easily , for now - a - days even fame is purchaseable - like love . Your star is in the ascendant , - no more literary drudgery for you my boy ! - pleasure and profit and ease are yours to enjoy for the rest of your life . You are a lucky dog ! - at last you have your day ! "
16935	16940	16930	16931	the prince	529	" Amiel ! Amiel ! "
17048	17063	17038	17038	I	0	" Peace ! Trouble him not . Let the fool in his folly sleep ! "
17454	17460	17462	17462	he	124	" You slept late , Tempest "
17483	17659	17462	17462	he	124	" To - morrow you must come with me and join what they call in fashionable slang parlance the Liver Brigade . Once upon a time it was considered the height of indelicacy and low breeding to mention the ' liver ' or any other portion of one 's internal machinery , - but we have done with all that now , and we find a peculiar satisfaction in discoursing of disease and unsavoury medical matters generally . And in the Liver Brigade you see at a glance all those interesting fellows who have sold themselves to the devil for the sake of the flesh - pots of Egypt , - men who eat till they are well - nigh bursting , and then prance up and down on good horses , - much too respectable beasts by the way to bear such bestial burdens - in the hope of getting out of their poisoned blood the evil they have themselves put in . They think me one of them , but I am not . "
17685	17694	17695	17695	I	0	" Why do you join the procession then ? "
17727	17733	17712	17712	he	645	" You are a fraud ! "
17734	17738	17739	17739	he	645	" I am ! "
17743	17763	17739	17739	he	645	" And do you know I am not the only one in London ! Where are you off to ? "
17764	17801	17712	17712	he	645	" To those lawyers who wrote to me last night ; - Bentham and Ellis is the name of the firm . The sooner I interview them the better , - do n't you think so ? "
17802	17809	17812	17812	he	645	" Yes - but see here , "
17817	17904	17812	17812	he	645	" You must have some ready cash . It does n't look well to apply at once for advances , - and there is really no necessity to explain to these legal men that you were on the verge of starvation when their letter arrived . Take this pocket - book , - remember you promised to let me be your banker , - and on your way you might go to some well - reputed tailor and get properly rigged out . Ta - ta ! "
17927	17936	17938	17938	I	0	" But wait - I say - Lucio ! "
17960	17963	17964	17964	he	645	" Well ? "
17974	17983	17985	17985	I	0	" You do n't give me time to speak "
18006	18083	17985	17985	I	0	" The fact is I have some money , or rather I can get it directly , - Carrington sent me a draft for fifty pounds in his letter - I forgot to tell you about it . It was very good of him to lend it to me , - you had better have it as security for this pocket - book , - by - the - bye how much is there inside it ? "
18084	18096	18098	18098	he	645	" Five hundred , in bank notes of tens and twenties , "
18106	18126	17985	17985	I	0	" Five hundred ! My dear fellow , I do n't want all that . It 's too much ! "
18127	18137	18139	18139	he	645	" Better have too much than too little nowadays , "
18145	18218	18139	18139	he	645	" My dear Tempest , do n't make such a business of it . Five hundred pounds is really nothing . You can spend it all on a dressing - case for example . Better send back John Carrington 's draft , - I do n't think much of his generosity considering that he came into a mine worth a hundred thousand pounds sterling , a few days before I left Australia . "
18306	18337	18295	18295	Rimânez	124	" Did he not tell you of his luck ? That was not very friendly of him - but as I remarked last night , money often spoils a man . "
18338	18350	18351	18351	I	0	" Oh I daresay he meant no slight by the omission , "
18359	18379	18351	18351	I	0	" No doubt he will make it the subject of his next letter . Now as to this five hundred "
18381	18389	18391	18391	he	645	" Keep it , man , keep it "
18395	18412	18391	18391	he	645	" What do you talk about security for ? Have n't I got you as security ? "
18416	18424	18426	18426	I	0	" Well , I am fairly reliable now "
18429	18439	18426	18426	I	0	" And I 'm not going to run away . "
18440	18444	18445	18445	he	645	" From me ? "
18456	18464	18445	18445	he	645	" No , - I fancy not ! "
18695	18705	18715	18715	he	145	" You are a very fortunate man Mr Tempest ; "
18733	18768	18715	18715	he	145	" At your age this princely inheritance may be either a great boon to you or a great curse , - one never knows . The possession of such enormous wealth involves great responsibilities . "
18793	18808	18810	18810	I	0	" Many people would be glad to accept such responsibilities and change places with me "
18817	18824	18810	18810	I	0	" You yourself , for example ? "
18883	18889	18891	18891	he	145	" No Mr Tempest , no "
18895	18967	18891	18891	he	145	" I do not think I should at all be disposed to change places with you . I feel very well satisfied as I am . My brain is my bank , and brings me in quite sufficient interest to live upon , which is all that I desire . To be comfortable , and pay one 's way honestly is enough for me . I have never envied the wealthy . "
18968	18975	18978	18979	his partner	664	" Mr Bentham is a philosopher , "
18985	19020	18981	18982	Mr Ellis	146	" In our profession Mr Tempest , we see so many ups and downs of life , that in watching the variable fortunes of our clients , we ourselves learn the lesson of content . "
19021	19036	19037	19037	I	0	" Ah , it is a lesson that I have never mastered till now ! "
19041	19052	19037	19037	I	0	" But at the present moment I confess myself satisfied . "
19068	19079	19080	19080	he	145	" Business being concluded , allow me to congratulate you , "
19084	19124	19080	19080	he	145	" Of course , if you should wish at any time to entrust your legal affairs to other hands , my partner and myself are perfectly willing to withdraw . Your deceased relative had the highest confidence in us .... "
19125	19135	19137	19137	I	0	" As I have also , I assure you , "
19141	19169	19137	19137	I	0	" Pray do me the favour to continue managing things for me as you did for my relative , and be assured of my gratitude in advance . "
19184	19201	19202	19202	Bentham	145	" We shall do our best for you , Mr Tempest , shall we not Bentham ? "
19206	19228	19202	19202	Bentham	145	" And now what do you say - shall we mention it Bentham ? - or shall we not mention it ? "
19229	19232	19234	19234	Bentham	145	" Perhaps , "
19237	19247	19234	19234	Bentham	145	" it would be as well to mention it . "
19271	19407	19265	19265	his	146	" The fact is Mr Tempest , your deceased relative had one very curious idea - he was a shrewd man and a clever one , but he certainly had one very curious idea - and perhaps if he had followed it up to any extent , it might - yes , it might have landed him in a lunatic asylum and prevented his disposing of his extensive fortune in the - er - the very just and reasonable manner he has done . Happily for himself and - er - for you , he did not follow it up , and to the last he retained his admirable business qualities and high sense of rectitude . But I do not think he ever quite dispossessed himself of the idea itself , did he Bentham ? "
19427	19439	19440	19440	he	145	" I think not , - no , I think not , "
19443	19453	19440	19440	he	145	" I believe he was perfectly convinced of it . "
19454	19460	19461	19461	I	0	" And what was it ? "
19467	19497	19461	19461	I	0	" Did he want to bring out some patent ? - a new notion for a flying - machine , and get rid of his money in that way ? "
19498	19505	19507	19508	Mr Ellis	146	" No , no , no ! "
19519	19623	19507	19508	Mr Ellis	146	" No , my dear sir - nothing of a purely mechanical or commercial turn captivated his imagination . He was too , - er - yes , I think I may say too profoundly opposed to what is called ' progress ' in the world to aid it by any new invention or other means whatever . You see it is a little awkward for me to explain to you what really seems to be the most absurd and fantastic notion , - but - to begin with , we never really knew how he made his money , did we Bentham ? "
19635	19678	19626	19626	his	145	" We had to take charge of large sums , and advise as to investments and other matters , - but it was not our business to inquire where the cash came from in the first place , was it , Bentham ? "
19686	19693	19697	19698	his partner	664	" We were entrusted with it ; "
19712	19791	19697	19698	his partner	664	" and we did our best to fulfil that trust - with - er - with discretion and fidelity . And it was only after we had been for many years connected in business that our client mentioned - er - his idea ; - a most erratic and extraordinary one , which was briefly this , - that he had sold himself to the devil , and that his large fortune was one result of the bargain ! "
19798	19804	19805	19805	I	0	" What a ridiculous notion ! "
19808	19836	19805	19805	I	0	" Poor man ! - a weak spot in his brain somewhere evidently , - or perhaps he used the expression as a mere figure of speech ? "
19837	19842	19845	19846	Mr Ellis	146	" I think not ; "
19855	19881	19845	19846	Mr Ellis	146	" I think our client did not use the phrase ' sold to the devil ' as a figure of speech merely , Mr Bentham ? "
19882	19890	19893	19893	Bentham	145	" I am positive he did not , "
19896	19911	19893	19893	Bentham	145	" He spoke of the ' bargain ' as an actual and accomplished fact . "
19921	19935	19937	19937	I	0	" Well , people have all sorts of fancies now - a - days "
19940	19979	19937	19937	I	0	" What with Blavatskyism , Besantism and hypnotism , it is no wonder if some folks still have a faint credence in the silly old superstition of a devil 's existence . But for a thoroughly sensible man .... "
19980	19987	19990	19991	Mr Ellis	146	" Yes - er , yes ; "
19993	20059	19990	19991	Mr Ellis	146	" Your relative , Mr Tempest , was a thoroughly sensible man , and this - er - this idea was the only fancy that ever appeared to have taken root in his eminently practical mind . Being only an idea , it seemed hardly worth mentioning - but perhaps it is well - Mr Bentham agreeing with me - that we have mentioned it . "
20060	20070	20073	20074	Mr Bentham	145	" It is a satisfaction and relief to ourselves , "
20076	20083	20073	20074	Mr Bentham	145	" to have had it mentioned . "
20125	20132	20135	20136	Mr Bentham	145	" Good - day Mr Tempest , "
20138	20193	20135	20136	Mr Bentham	145	" I need scarcely say that we shall serve you as we served our late client , to the best of our ability . And in matters where advice may be pleasant or profitable , we may possibly be of use to you . May we ask whether you require any cash advances immediately ? "
20194	20200	20202	20202	I	0	" No , thank you , "
20225	20231	20210	20210	Rimânez	124	" I am amply provided . "
20365	20368	20369	20369	he	677	" Hullo ! "
20374	20377	20378	20378	I	0	" Hullo ! "
20381	20388	20389	20389	he	677	" Where are you off to ? "
20393	20417	20389	20389	he	677	" Going to try and place that unlucky novel ? My dear boy , believe me it will never do as it is .... "
20418	20427	20429	20429	I	0	" It will do , it shall do ; "
20433	20442	20429	20429	I	0	" I am going to publish it myself . "
20446	20472	20443	20443	He	677	" Publish it yourself ! Good heavens ! - it will cost you - ah ! - sixty or seventy , perhaps a hundred pounds . "
20473	20485	20389	20389	he	677	" I do n't care if it costs me a thousand ! "
20501	20508	20509	20509	he	677	" I thought ... excuse me ... "
20513	20523	20509	20509	he	677	" I thought money was scarce with you - - "
20524	20528	20529	20529	I	0	" It was , "
20533	20539	20529	20529	I	0	" It is n't now . "
20607	20612	20613	20613	I	0	" Look here man , "
20624	20644	20613	20613	I	0	" I 'm not mad - do n't you think it , - I 'm only a - millionaire ! "
20691	20807	20680	20680	I	0	" I assure you on my word of honour I 'm not joking - it 's a fact . Last night I wanted a dinner , and you , like a good fellow , offered to give me one , - to - day I possess five millions of money ! Do n't stare so ! do n't have a fit of apoplexy ! And as I have told you , I shall publish my book myself at my own expense , and it shall succeed ! Oh I 'm in earnest , grim earnest , grim as death ! - I 've more than enough in my pocketbook to pay for its publication now ! "
20823	20829	20830	20830	he	680	" God bless my soul ! "
20834	20851	20830	20830	he	680	" It 's like a dream ! - I was never more astonished in my life ! "
20852	20856	20857	20857	I	0	" Nor I ! "
20869	20920	20857	20857	I	0	" But strange things happen in life , as in fiction . And that book which the builders - I mean the readers - rejected , shall be the headstone of the corner - or - the success of the season ! What will you take to bring it out ? "
20921	20931	20830	20830	he	680	" Take ? I ? I bring it out ! "
20932	21117	20857	20857	I	0	" Yes , you - why not ? If I offer you a chance to turn an honest penny shall your paid pack of ' readers ' prevent your accepting it ? Fie ! you are not a slave , - this is a free country . I know the kind of people who ' read ' for you , - the gaunt unlovable spinster of fifty , - the dyspeptic book - worm who is a ' literary failure ' and can find nothing else to do but scrawl growling comments on the manuscript of promising work , - why in heaven 's name should you rely on such incompetent opinion ? I 'll pay you for the publication of my book at as stiff a price as you choose and something over for good - will . And I guarantee you another thing - it shall not only make my name as an author , but yours as a publisher . I 'll advertise royally , and I 'll work the press . Everything in this world can be done for money ... "
21118	21123	21125	21125	he	681	" Stop , stop , "
21129	21152	21125	21125	he	681	" This is so sudden ! You must let me think of it - you must give me time to consider - - "
21153	21162	21163	21163	I	0	" Take a day for your meditations then , "
21166	21209	21163	21163	I	0	" But no longer . For if you do n't say yes , I 'll get another man , and he 'll have the big pickings instead of you ! Be wise in time , my friend ! - good - day ! "
21215	21241	21210	21210	He	681	" Stay , - look here ! You 're so strange , so wild - so erratic you know ! Your head seems quite turned ! "
21242	21253	21125	21125	he	681	" It is ! The right way round this time ! "
21254	21259	21261	21261	he	681	" Dear dear me , "
21265	21291	21261	21261	he	681	" Why , you do n't give me a chance to congratulate you . I really do , you know - I congratulate you sincerely ! "
21302	21373	21293	21293	he	681	" And as regards the book I believe there was really no fault found with it in the matter of literary style or quality , - it was simply too - too transcendental , and unlikely therefore to suit the public taste . The Domestic - Iniquity line is what we find pays best at present . But I will think about it - where will a letter find you ? "
21374	21378	21379	21379	I	0	" Grand Hotel , "
21414	21465	21400	21400	he	681	" Come there , and lunch or dine with me to - morrow if you like - only send me a word beforehand . Remember , I give you just a day 's grace to decide , - it must be yes or no , in twenty - four hours ! "
21788	21797	21798	21798	he	555	" Ah , Geoffrey ! Here you are ! "
21801	21818	21798	21798	he	555	" I imagined you would get through your business by lunch time , so I waited . "
21819	21825	21826	21826	I	0	" Very good of you ! "
21845	21852	21826	21826	I	0	" What have you got there ? "
21853	21859	21861	21861	he	555	" A pet of mine , "
21867	21877	21861	21861	he	555	" Did you ever see anything like it before ? "
21922	21927	21928	21928	I	0	" Is it alive ? "
21931	21944	21947	21947	Rimânez	124	" It is alive , and has a sufficient share of intelligence , "
21949	21989	21947	21947	Rimânez	124	" I feed it and it knows me , - that is the utmost you can say of the most civilized human beings ; they know what feeds them . It is quite tame and friendly as you perceive , "
22053	22065	22050	22050	he	555	" Off , Sprite ! Fly , and return to me ! "
22137	22159	22162	22163	the prince	529	" There is a well - worn platitude which declares that ' in the midst of life we are in death ' "
22179	22264	22168	22168	his	529	" But as a matter of fact that maxim is wrong as so many trite human maxims are . It should be ' in the midst of death we are in life . ' This creature is a rare and curious production of death , but not I believe the only one of its kind . Others have been found under precisely similar circumstances . I took possession of this one myself in rather a weird fashion , - will the story bore you ? "
22265	22269	22271	22271	I	0	" On the contrary "
22305	22436	22297	22297	He	529	" Well , - it happened simply thus , - I was present at the uncasing of an Egyptian female mummy ; - her talismans described her as a princess of a famous royal house . Several curious jewels were tied round her neck , and on her chest was a piece of beaten gold quarter of an inch thick . Underneath this gold plate , her body was swathed round and round in an unusual number of scented wrappings ; and when these were removed it was discovered that the mummified flesh between her breasts had decayed away , and in the hollow or nest thus formed by the process of decomposition , this insect I hold was found alive , as brilliant in colour as it is now ! "
22446	22449	22450	22450	I	0	" Horrible ! "
22453	22484	22450	22450	I	0	" I confess , if I were you , I should not care to make a pet of such an uncanny object . I should kill it , I think . "
22494	22497	22498	22498	he	702	" Why ? "
22501	22620	22621	22621	He	702	" I 'm afraid , my dear Geoffrey , you are not disposed to study science . To kill the poor thing who managed to find life in the very bosom of death , is a cruel suggestion , is it not ? To me , this unclassified insect is a valuable proof if I needed one of the indestructibility of the germs of conscious existence ; it has eyes , and the senses of taste , smell , touch and hearing , - and it gained these together with its intelligence , out of the dead flesh of a woman who lived , and no doubt loved and sinned and suffered more than four thousand years ago ! "
22630	22724	22621	22621	He	702	" All the same I frankly admit to you that I believe it to be an evil creature . I do indeed ! But I like it none the less for that . In fact I have rather a fantastic notion about it myself . I am much inclined to accept the idea of the transmigration of souls , and so I please my humour sometimes by thinking that perhaps the princess of that Royal Egyptian house had a wicked , brilliant , vampire soul , - and that ... here it is ! "
22860	22866	22868	22868	I	0	" It is certainly remarkable , "
22871	22894	22868	22868	I	0	" No wonder you value it , - as a curiosity . Its eyes are quite distinct , almost intelligent in fact . "
22895	22903	22906	22906	Rimânez	124	" No doubt she had beautiful eyes , "
22909	22917	22868	22868	I	0	" She ? Whom do you mean ? "
22918	22925	22926	22926	he	702	" The princess , of course ! "
22932	22962	22926	22926	he	702	" The dear dead lady , - some of whose personality must be in this creature , seeing that it had nothing but her body to nourish itself upon . "
22978	22981	22983	22983	I	0	" I suppose "
22987	23006	22983	22983	I	0	" you , in your pursuit of science , would infer from this that nothing actually perishes completely ? "
23007	23010	23012	23012	Rimânez	124	" Exactly ! "
23015	23047	23012	23012	Rimânez	124	" There , my dear Tempest , is the mischief , - or the deity , - of things . Nothing can be entirely annihilated ; - not even a thought . "
23069	23075	23076	23076	he	702	" And now for luncheon , "
23086	23124	23076	23076	he	702	" You look twenty per cent . better than when you went out this morning , Geoffrey , so I conclude your legal matters are disposed of satisfactorily . And what else have you done with yourself ? "
23196	23200	23201	23201	he	141	" Of course ! "
23209	23367	23201	23201	he	141	" There is nothing in the least surprising in the conduct of the worthy man . In fact I think he showed remarkable discretion and decency in not at once jumping at your proposition , - his pleasant hypocrisy in retiring to think it over , shows him to be a person of tact and foresight . Did you ever imagine that a human being or a human conscience existed that could not be bought ? My good fellow , you can buy a king if you only give a long price enough ; and the Pope will sell you a specially reserved seat in his heaven if you will only hand him the cash down while he is on earth ! Nothing is given free in this world save the air and the sunshine , - everything else must be bought , - with blood , tears and groans occasionally , - but oftenest with money . "
23544	23550	23552	23552	he	709	" Now let us talk , "
23555	23603	23552	23552	he	709	" I believe I am at present the best friend you have , and I certainly know the world better than you do . What do you propose to make of your life ? Or in other words how do you mean to begin spending your money ? "
23607	23629	23631	23631	I	0	" Well , I sha n't provide funds for the building of a church , or the endowment of a hospital , "
23634	23703	23631	23631	I	0	" I shall not even start a Free Library , for these institutions , besides becoming centres for infectious diseases , generally get presided over by a committee of local grocers who presume to consider themselves judges of literature . My dear Prince Rimânez , I mean to spend my money on my own pleasure , and I daresay I shall find plenty of ways to do it . "
23733	23747	23749	23749	he	124	" With your fortune , you could make hundreds of miserable people happy ; "
23752	23762	23764	23764	I	0	" Thanks , I would rather be happy myself first "
23768	23788	23764	23764	I	0	" I daresay I seem to you selfish , - you are philanthropic I know ; I am not . "
23795	23806	23809	23809	him	124	" You might help your fellow - workers in literature .... "
23815	23889	23809	23809	him	124	" That I will never do , my friend , though the heavens should crack ! My fellow - workers in literature have kicked me down at every opportunity , and done their best to keep me from earning a bare livelihood , - it is my turn at kicking now , and I will show them as little mercy , as little help , as little sympathy as they have shown me ! "
23890	23895	23896	23896	he	124	" Revenge is sweet ! "
23900	23915	23896	23896	he	124	" I should recommend your starting a high - class half - crown magazine . "
23916	23919	23809	23809	him	124	" Why ? "
23920	24039	23896	23896	he	124	" Can you ask ? Just think of the ferocious satisfaction it would give you to receive the manuscripts of your literary enemies , and reject them ! To throw their letters into the waste - paper basket , and send back their poems , stories , political articles and what not , with ' Returned with thanks ' or ' Not up to our mark ' type - written on the backs thereof ! To dig knives into your rivals through the medium of anonymous criticism ! The howling joy of a savage with twenty scalps at his belt would be tame in comparison to it ! I was an editor once myself , and I know ! "
24047	24054	24056	24056	I	0	" I daresay you are right , "
24059	24089	24056	24056	I	0	" I can grasp the vengeful position thoroughly ! But the management of a magazine would be too much trouble to me , - too much of a tie . "
24090	24261	23896	23896	he	124	" Do n't manage it ! Follow the example of all the big editors , and live out of the business altogether , - but take the profits ! You never see the real editor of a leading daily newspaper you know , - you can only interview the sub . The real man is , according to the seasons of the year , at Ascot , in Scotland , at Newmarket , or wintering in Egypt , - he is supposed to be responsible for everything in his journal , but he is generally the last person who knows anything about it . He relies on his ' staff ' - a very bad crutch at times , - and when his ' staff ' are in a difficulty , they get out of it by saying they are unable to decide without the editor . Meanwhile the editor is miles away , comfortably free from worry . You could bamboozle the public in that way if you liked . "
24262	24275	24276	24276	I	0	" I could , but I should n't care to do so , "
24279	24298	24276	24276	I	0	" If I had a business I would not neglect it . I believe in doing things thoroughly . "
24299	24304	24306	24306	Rimânez	124	" So do I ! "
24309	24342	24343	24343	He	124	" I am a very thorough - going fellow myself , and whatever my hand findeth to do , I do it with my might ! - excuse me for quoting Scripture ! "
24355	24372	24343	24343	He	124	" Well , in what , at present does your idea of enjoying your heritage consist ? "
24373	24379	24380	24380	I	0	" In publishing my book , "
24383	24409	24380	24380	I	0	" That very book I could get no one to accept , - I tell you , I will make it the talk of London ! "
24410	24414	24416	24416	he	124	" Possibly you will "
24434	24505	24416	24416	he	124	" London easily talks . Particularly on unsavoury and questionable subjects . Therefore , - as I have already hinted , - if your book were a judicious mixture of Zola , Huysmans and Baudelaire , or had for its heroine a ' modest ' maid who considered honourable marriage a ' degradation , ' it would be quite sure of success in these days of new Sodom and Gomorrah . "
24521	24666	24507	24507	he	124	" Why do not the heavens rain fire on this accursed city ! It is ripe for punishment , - full of abhorrent creatures not worth the torturing in hell to which it is said liars and hypocrites are condemned ! Tempest , if there is one human being more than another that I utterly abhor , it is the type of man so common to the present time , the man who huddles his own loathly vices under a cloak of assumed broad - mindedness and virtue . Such an one will even deify the loss of chastity in woman by the name of ' purity , ' - because he knows that it is by her moral and physical ruin alone that he can gratify his brutal lusts . Rather than be such a sanctimonious coward I would openly proclaim myself vile ! "
24667	24676	24678	24678	I	0	" That is because yours is a noble nature "
24681	24690	24678	24678	I	0	" You are an exception to the rule . "
24691	24697	24700	24700	he	713	" An exception ? I ? "
24704	24885	24700	24700	he	713	" Yes , you are right ; I am an exception among men perhaps , - but I am one with the beasts in honesty ! The lion does not assume the manners of the dove , - he loudly announces his own ferocity . The very cobra , stealthy though its movements be , evinces its meaning by a warning hiss or rattle . The hungry wolf 's bay is heard far down the wind , intimidating the hurrying traveller among the wastes of snow . But man gives no clue to his intent - more malignant than the lion , more treacherous than the snake , more greedy than the wolf , he takes his fellow - man 's hand in pretended friendship , and an hour later defames his character behind his back , - with a smiling face he hides a false and selfish heart , - flinging his pigmy mockery at the riddle of the Universe , he stands gibing at God , feebly a - straddle on his own earth - grave - Heavens ! "
24896	24912	24888	24888	he	714	" What should the Eternities do with such a thankless , blind worm as he ! "
25017	25027	25029	25029	he	714	" I think I was born to be an actor "
25033	25074	25029	25029	he	714	" Now and then the love of declamation masters me . Then I speak - as Prime Ministers and men in Parliament speak - to suit the humour of the hour , and without meaning a single word I say ! "
25075	25082	25084	25084	I	0	" I can not accept that statement "
25092	25112	25084	25084	I	0	" You do mean what you say , - though I fancy you are rather a creature of impulse . "
25113	25118	25119	25119	he	714	" Do you really ! "
25122	25220	25119	25119	he	714	" How wise of you ! - good Geoffrey Tempest , how very wise of you ! But you are wrong . There never was a being created who was less impulsive , or more charged with set purpose than I. Believe me or not as you like , - belief is a sentiment that can not be forced . If I told you that I am a dangerous companion , - that I like evil things better than good , - that I am not a safe guide for any man , what would you think ? "
25221	25236	25238	25238	I	0	" I should think you were whimsically fond of under - estimating your own qualities "
25255	25280	25238	25238	I	0	" And I should like you just as well as I do now , - perhaps better , - though that would be difficult . "
25298	25320	25285	25285	he	716	" Tempest , you follow the fashion of the prettiest women about town , - they always like the greatest scoundrels ! "
25321	25329	25331	25331	I	0	" But you are not a scoundrel ; "
25337	25359	25285	25285	he	716	" No , - I 'm not a scoundrel , but there 's a good deal of the devil in me . "
25360	25365	25366	25366	I	0	" All the better ! "
25379	25391	25366	25366	I	0	" I hope there 's something of him in me too . "
25392	25399	25401	25401	Rimânez	124	" Do you believe in him ? "
25404	25412	25366	25366	I	0	" The devil ? of course not ! "
25413	25422	25425	25426	the prince	529	" He is a very fascinating legendary personage ; "
25439	25867	25425	25426	the prince	529	" And he is the subject of many a fine story . Picture his fall from heaven ! - ' Lucifer Son of the Morning ' - what a title , and what a birthright ! To be born of the morning implies to be a creature formed of translucent light undefiled , with all the warm rose of a million orbs of day colouring his bright essence , and all the lustre of fiery planets flaming in his eyes . Splendid and supreme , at the right hand of Deity itself he stood , this majestic Arch - angel , and before his unwearied vision rolled the grandest creative splendours of God 's thoughts and dreams . All at once he perceived in the vista of embryonic things a new small world , and on it a being forming itself slowly as it were into the Angelic likeness , - a being weak yet strong , sublime yet foolish , - a strange paradox , destined to work its way through all the phases of life , till imbibing the very breath and soul of the Creator it should touch Conscious Immortality , - Eternal Joy . Then Lucifer , full of wrath , turned on the Master of the Spheres , and flung forth his reckless defiance , crying aloud - ' Wilt thou make of this slight poor creature an Angel even as I ? I do protest against thee and condemn ! Lo , if thou makest Man in Our image I will destroy him utterly , as unfit to share with me the splendours of Thy Wisdom , - the glory of Thy love ! ' And the Voice Supreme in accents terrible and beautiful replied ; ' Lucifer , Son of the Morning , full well dost thou know that never can an idle or wasted word be spoken before Me . For Free - will is the gift of the Immortals ; therefore what thou sayest , thou must needs do ! Fall , proud Spirit from thy high estate ! - thou and thy companions with thee ! - and return no more till Man himself redeem thee ! Each human soul that yields unto thy tempting shall be a new barrier set between thee and heaven ; each one that of its own choice doth repel and overcome thee , shall lift thee nearer thy lost home ! When the world rejects thee , I will pardon and again receive thee , - but not till then . ' "
25868	25880	25882	25882	I	0	" I never heard exactly that version of the legend before , "
25886	25901	25882	25882	I	0	" The idea that Man should redeem the devil is quite new to me . "
25902	25906	25908	25908	he	718	" Is it ? "
25914	26020	25908	25908	he	718	" Well - it is one form of the story , and by no means the most unpoetical . Poor Lucifer ! His punishment is of course eternal , and the distance between himself and Heaven must be rapidly increasing every day , - for Man will never assist him to retrieve his error . Man will reject God fast enough and gladly enough - but never the devil . Judge then , how , under the peculiar circumstances of his doom , this ' Lucifer , Son of the Morning , ' Satan , or whatever else he is called , must hate Humanity ! "
26024	26033	26021	26021	I	0	" Well he has one remedy left to him "
26038	26045	26035	26035	I	0	" He need not tempt anybody . "
26046	26063	26066	26066	Rimânez	124	" You forget ! - he is bound to keep his word , according to the legend "
26068	26133	26066	26066	Rimânez	124	" He swore before God that he would destroy Man utterly , - he must therefore fulfil that oath , if he can . Angels , it would seem , may not swear before the Eternal without endeavouring at least to fulfil their vows , - men swear in the name of God every day without the slightest intention of carrying out their promises . "
26134	26143	26145	26145	I	0	" But it 's all the veriest nonsense , "
26150	26210	26145	26145	I	0	" All these old legends are rubbish . You tell the story well , and almost as if you believed in it , - that is because you have the gift of speaking with eloquence . Nowadays no one believes in either devils or angels ; - I , for example , do not even believe in the soul . "
26211	26217	26219	26219	he	719	" I know you do not "
26223	26259	26219	26219	he	719	" And your scepticism is very comfortable because it relieves you of all personal responsibility . I envy you ! For - I regret to say , I am compelled to believe in the soul . "
26260	26263	26264	26264	I	0	" Compelled ! "
26267	26283	26264	26264	I	0	" That is absurd - no one can compel you to accept a mere theory . "
26300	26437	26219	26219	he	719	" True ! very true ! There is no compelling force in the whole Universe , - Man is the supreme and independent creature , - master of all he surveys and owning no other dominion save his personal desire . True - I forgot ! Let us avoid theology , please , and psychology also , - let us talk about the only subject that has any sense or interest in it - namely , Money . I perceive your present plans are definite , - you wish to publish a book that shall create a stir and make you famous . It seems a modest enough campaign ! Have you no wider ambitions ? There are several ways , you know , of getting talked about . Shall I enumerate them for your consideration ? "
26441	26446	26438	26438	I	0	" If you like ! "
26447	26504	26284	26284	He	719	" Well , in the first place I should suggest your getting yourself properly paragraphed . It must be known to the press that you are an exceedingly rich man . There is an Agency for the circulation of paragraphs , - I daresay they 'll do it sufficiently well for about ten or twenty guineas . "
26514	26526	26438	26438	I	0	" Oh , is that the way these things are done ? "
26527	26539	26540	26540	he	720	" My dear fellow , how else should they be done ? "
26545	26689	26540	26540	he	720	" Do you think anything in the world is done without money ? Are the poor , hard - working journalists your brothers or your bosom friends that they should lift you into public notice without getting something for their trouble ? If you do not manage them properly in this way , they 'll abuse you quite heartily and free of cost , - that I can promise you ! I know a ' literary agent , ' a very worthy man too , who for a hundred guineas down , will so ply the paragraph wheel that in a few weeks it shall seem to the outside public that Geoffrey Tempest , the millionaire , is the only person worth talking about , and the one desirable creature whom to shake hands with is next in honour to meeting Royalty itself . "
26690	26694	26695	26695	I	0	" Secure him ! "
26699	26716	26695	26695	I	0	" And pay him two hundred guineas ! So shall all the world hear of me ! "
26717	26725	26728	26728	Rimânez	124	" When you have been paragraphed thoroughly , "
26730	26887	26728	26728	Rimânez	124	" the next move will be a dash into what is called ' swagger ' society . This must be done cautiously and by degrees . You must be presented at the first Levée of the season , and later on , I will get you an invitation to some great lady 's house , where you will meet the Prince of Wales privately at dinner . If you can oblige or please His Royal Highness in any way so much the better for you , - he is at least the most popular royalty in Europe , so it should not be difficult to you to make yourself agreeable . Following upon this event , you must purchase a fine country seat , and have that fact ' paragraphed ' - then you can rest and look round , - Society will have taken you up , and you will find yourself in the swim ! "
26900	26905	26906	26906	he	721	" I should not , "
26909	26944	26906	26906	he	721	" propose your putting yourself to the trouble of getting into Parliament . That is no longer necessary to the career of a gentleman . But I should strongly recommend your winning the Derby . "
26945	26951	26952	26952	I	0	" I daresay you would ! "
26956	26971	26952	26952	I	0	" It 's an admirable suggestion , - but not very easy to follow ! "
26972	26981	26982	26982	he	721	" If you wish to win the Derby , "
26986	27000	26982	26982	he	721	" you shall win it . I 'll guarantee both horse and jockey ! "
27020	27028	27029	27029	I	0	" Are you a worker of miracles ? "
27034	27040	27029	27029	I	0	" Do you mean it ? "
27041	27045	27046	27046	he	721	" Try me ! "
27049	27058	27046	27046	he	721	" Shall I enter a horse for you ? "
27059	27069	27070	27070	I	0	" You ca n't ; it 's too late , "
27073	27094	27070	27070	I	0	" You would need to be the devil himself to do it . Besides I do n't care about racing . "
27095	27105	27107	27107	he	721	" You will have to amend your taste then , "
27110	27440	27107	27107	he	721	" That is , if you want to make yourself agreeable to the English aristocracy , for they are interested in little else . No really great lady is without her betting book , though she may be deficient in her knowledge of spelling . You may make the biggest literary furore of the season , and that will count as nothing among ' swagger ' people , but if you win the Derby you will be a really famous man . Personally speaking I have a great deal to do with racing , - in fact I am devoted to it . I am always present at every great race , - I never miss one ; I always bet , and I never lose ! And now let me proceed with your social plan of action . After winning the Derby you will enter for a yacht race at Cowes , and allow the Prince of Wales to beat you just narrowly . Then you will give a grand dinner , arranged by a perfect chef , - and you will entertain His Royal Highness to the strains of ' Britannia rules the waves , ' which will serve as a pretty compliment . You will allude to the same well - worn song in a graceful speech , - and the probable result of all this will be one , or perhaps two Royal invitations . So far , so good . With the heats of summer you will go to Homburg to drink the waters there whether you require them or not , - and in the autumn you will assemble a shooting - party at the country seat before - mentioned which you will have purchased , and invite Royalty to join you in killing the poor little partridges . Then your name in society may be considered as made , and you can marry whatever fair lady happens to be in the market ! "
27441	27448	27450	27450	I	0	" Thanks ! - much obliged ! "
27457	27472	27450	27450	I	0	" Upon my word Lucio , your programme is perfect ! It lacks nothing ! "
27473	27483	27485	27485	Lucio	124	" It is the orthodox round of social success , "
27490	27512	27485	27485	Lucio	124	" Intellect and originality have nothing whatever to do with it , - only money is needed to perform it all . "
27513	27518	27520	27520	I	0	" You forget my book "
27523	27555	27520	27520	I	0	" I know there is some intellect in that , and some originality too . Surely that will give me an extra lift up the heights of fashionable light and leading . "
27556	27561	27562	27562	he	124	" I doubt it ! "
27565	27857	27562	27562	he	124	" I very much doubt it . It will be received with a certain amount of favour of course , as a production of a rich man amusing himself with literature as a sort of whim . But , as I told you before , genius seldom develops itself under the influence of wealth . Then again ' swagger ' folks can never get it out of their fuddled heads that Literature belongs to Grub Street . Great poets , great philosophers , great romancists are always vaguely alluded to by ' swagger ' society as ' those sort of people . ' Those sort of people are so ' interesting ' say the blue - blooded noodles deprecatingly , excusing themselves as it were for knowing any members of the class literary . You can fancy a ' swagger ' lady of Elizabeth 's time asking a friend - ' O do you mind , my dear , if I bring one Master William Shakespeare to see you ? He writes plays , and does something or other at the Globe theatre , - in fact I 'm afraid he acts a little - he 's not very well off poor man , - but these sort of people are always so amusing ! ' Now you , my dear Tempest , are not a Shakespeare , but your millions will give you a better chance than he ever had in his life - time , as you will not have to sue for patronage , or practise a reverence for ' my lord ' or ' my lady , ' - these exalted personages will be only too delighted to borrow money of you if you will lend it . "
27858	27864	27866	27866	I	0	" I shall not lend , "
27869	27873	27866	27866	I	0	" Nor give ? "
27874	27878	27879	27879	His	722	" Nor give . "
27885	27891	27892	27892	he	722	" I am very glad , "
27895	27976	27892	27892	he	722	" that you are determined not to ' go about doing good ' as the canting humbugs say , with your money . You are wise . Spend on yourself , - because your very act of spending can not but benefit others through various channels . Now I pursue a different course . I always help charities , and put my name on subscription - lists , - and I never fail to assist a certain portion of clergy . "
27977	27984	27985	27985	I	0	" I rather wonder at that - "
27988	28000	27985	27985	I	0	" Especially as you tell me you are not a Christian . "
28001	28015	28017	28017	he	722	" Yes , - it does seem strange , - does n't it ? "
28031	28094	28017	28017	he	722	" But perhaps you do n't look at it in the proper light . Many of the clergy are doing their utmost best to destroy religion , - by ca nt , by hypocrisy , by sensuality , by shams of every description , - and when they seek my help in this noble work , I give it , - freely ! "
28097	28104	28106	28106	I	0	" You must have your joke evidently "
28120	28140	28106	28106	I	0	" And I see you are fond of satirizing your own good actions . Hullo , what 's this ? "
28176	28186	28158	28158	I	0	" Accept book with pleasure . Send manuscript immediately . "
28201	28273	28198	28198	He	124	" Of course ! what else did you expect ? Only the man should have worded his telegram differently , for I do not suppose he would accept the book with pleasure if he had to lay out his own cash upon it . ' Accept money for publishing book with pleasure ' should have been the true message of the wire . Well , what are you going to do ? "
28274	28282	28284	28284	I	0	" I shall see about this at once "
28307	28347	28284	28284	I	0	" The book must be hurried through the press as quickly as possible , - and I shall take a particular pleasure in personally attending to all the details concerning it . For the rest of my plans , - "
28348	28354	28356	28356	Rimânez	124	" Leave them to me ! "
28371	28423	28358	28358	his	124	" Leave them to me ! - and be sure that before very long I shall have set you aloft like the bear who has successfully reached the bun on the top of a greased pole , - a spectacle for the envy of men , and the wonder of angels ! "
30087	30091	30092	30092	Rimânez	124	" Come in ! "
30095	30104	30105	30105	he	124	" What , all in the dark Tempest ! "
30109	30117	30105	30105	he	124	" Why do n't you light up ? "
30118	30124	30126	30126	I	0	" The fire 's enough , "
30130	30139	30126	30126	I	0	" Enough at any rate to think by . "
30140	30147	30148	30148	he	124	" And have you been thinking ? "
30152	30206	30148	30148	he	124	" Do n't do it . It 's a bad habit . No one thinks now - a - days , - people ca n't stand it - their heads are too frail . Once begin to think and down go the foundations of society , - besides thinking is always dull work . "
30207	30214	30215	30215	I	0	" I have found it so , "
30219	30230	30215	30215	I	0	" Lucio , there is something wrong about me somewhere . "
30243	30272	30231	30231	His	124	" Wrong ? Oh no , surely not ! What can there be wrong about you , Tempest ? Are you not one of the richest men living ? "
30279	30285	30286	30286	I	0	" Listen , my friend , "
30290	30316	30286	30286	I	0	" You know I have been busy for the last fortnight correcting the proofs of my book for the press , - do you not ? "
30324	30375	30273	30273	I	0	" Well I have arrived almost at the end of my work and I have come to the conclusion that the book is not Me , - it is not a reflex of my feelings at all , - and I can not understand how I came to write it . "
30376	30383	30385	30385	Lucio	124	" You find it stupid perhaps ? "
30388	30391	30392	30392	I	0	" No , "
30400	30408	30392	30392	I	0	" I do not find it stupid . "
30409	30413	30273	30273	I	0	" Dull then ? "
30414	30423	30392	30392	I	0	" No , - it is not dull . "
30424	30427	30273	30273	I	0	" Melodramatic ? "
30428	30435	30392	30392	I	0	" No , - not melodramatic . "
30436	30457	30458	30458	he	124	" Well , my good fellow , if it is not dull or stupid or melodramatic , what is it ! "
30462	30468	30458	30458	he	124	" It must be something ! "
30469	30484	30486	30486	I	0	" Yes , - it is this , - it is beyond me altogether . "
30492	30554	30486	30486	I	0	" Quite beyond me . I could not write it now , - I wonder I could write it then . Lucio , I daresay I am talking foolishly , - but it seems to me I must have been on some higher altitude of thought when I wrote the book , - a height from which I have since fallen . "
30555	30563	30564	30564	he	124	" I 'm sorry to hear this , "
30571	30634	30564	30564	he	124	" From what you say it appears to me you have been guilty of literary sublimity . Oh bad , very bad ! Nothing can be worse . To write sublimely is a grievous sin , and one which critics never forgive . I 'm really grieved for you , my friend - I never thought your case was quite so desperate . "
30643	30650	30651	30651	I	0	" You are incorrigible , Lucio ! "
30654	30719	30651	30651	I	0	" But your cheerfulness is very inspiriting . All I wanted to explain to you is this , - that my book expresses a certain tone of thought which purporting to be mine , is not me , - in short , I , in my present self have no sympathy with it . I must have changed very much since I wrote it . "
30720	30731	30733	30733	Lucio	124	" Changed ? Why yes , I should think so ! "
30737	30964	30733	30733	Lucio	124	" The possession of five millions is bound to change a man considerably for the better - or worse ! But you seem to be worrying yourself most absurdly about nothing . Not one author in many centuries writes from his own heart or as he truly feels - when he does , he becomes well - nigh immortal . This planet is too limited to hold more than one Homer , one Plato , one Shakespeare . Do n't distress yourself - you are neither of these three ! You belong to the age , Tempest , - it is a decadent ephemeral age , and most things connected with it are decadent and ephemeral . Any era that is dominated by the love of money only , has a rotten core within it and must perish . All history tells us so , but no one accepts the lesson of history . Observe the signs of the time , - Art is made subservient to the love of money - literature , politics and religion the same , - you can not escape from the general disease . The only thing to do is to make the best of it , - no one can reform it - least of all you , who have so much of the lucre given to your share . "
30985	30994	30995	30995	he	781	" What I am going to say now , "
31004	31181	30995	30995	he	781	" will sound ridiculously trite , - still it has the perverse prosiness of truth about it . It is this - in order to write with intense feeling , you must first feel . Very likely when you wrote this book of yours , you were almost a human hedge - hog in the way of feeling . Every prickly point of you was erect and responsive to the touch of all influences , pleasant or the reverse , imaginative or realistic . This is a condition which some people envy and others would rather dispense with . Now that you , as a hedge - hog , have no further need for either alarm , indignation or self - defence , your prickles are soothed into an agreeable passiveness , and you partially cease to feel . That is all . The ' change ' you complain of is thus accounted for ; - you have nothing to feel about , - hence you can not comprehend how it was that you ever felt . "
31195	31209	31210	31210	I	0	" Do you take me for such a callous creature as all that ? "
31213	31228	31210	31210	I	0	" You are mistaken in me , Lucio . I feel most keenly - - "
31229	31235	31236	31236	he	781	" What do you feel ? "
31246	31344	31236	31236	he	781	" There are hundreds of starving wretches in this metropolis , - men and women on the brink of suicide because they have no hope of anything in this world or the next , and no sympathy from their kind - do you feel for them ? Do their griefs affect you ? You know they do not , - you know you never think of them , - why should you ? One of the chief advantages of wealth is the ability it gives us to shut out other people 's miseries from our personal consideration . "
31386	31389	31390	31390	he	782	" Yesterday , "
31399	31757	31390	31390	he	782	" a child was run over here , just opposite this hotel . It was only a poor child , - mark that ' only . ' Its mother ran shrieking out of some back - street hard by , in time to see the little bleeding body carted up in a mangled heap . She struck wildly with both hands at the men who were trying to lead her away , and with a cry like that of some hurt savage animal fell face forward in the mud - dead . She was only a poor woman , - another ' only . ' There were three lines in the paper about it headed ' Sad Incident . ' The hotel - porter here witnessed the scene from the door with as composed a demeanor as that of a fop at the play , never relaxing the serene majesty of his attitude , - but about ten minutes after the dead body of the woman had been carried out of sight , he , the imperial , gold - buttoned being , became almost crook - backed in his servile haste to run and open the door of your brougham , my dear Geoffrey , as you drove up to the entrance . This is a little epitome of life as it is lived now - a - days , - and yet the canting clerics swear we are all equal in the sight of heaven ! We may be , though it does not look much like it , - and if we are , it does not matter , as we have ceased to care how heaven regards us . I do n't want to point a moral , - I simply tell you the ' sad incident ' as it occurred , - and I am sure you are not the least sorry for the fate of either the child who was run over , or its mother who died in the sharp agony of a suddenly broken heart . Now do n't say you are , because I know you 're not ! "
31758	31776	31777	31777	I	0	" How can one feel sorry for people one does not know or has never seen , - "
31780	31912	31390	31390	he	782	" Exactly ! - How is it possible ? And there we have it - how can one feel , when one 's self is so thoroughly comfortable as to be without any other feeling save that of material ease ? Thus , my dear Geoffrey , you must be content to let your book appear as the reflex and record of your past when you were in the prickly or sensitive stage , - now you are encased in a pachydermatous covering of gold , which adequately protects you from such influences as might have made you start and writhe , perhaps even roar with indignation , and in the access of fierce torture , stretch out your hands and grasp - quite unconsciously - the winged thing called Fame ! "
31913	31921	31923	31923	I	0	" You should have been an orator , "
31938	31963	31923	31923	I	0	" But to me your words are not consoling , and I do not think they are true . Fame is easily enough secured . "
31964	31972	31975	31975	Lucio	124	" Pardon me if I am obstinate ; "
31981	32024	31975	31975	Lucio	124	" Notoriety is easily secured - very easily . A few critics who have dined with you and had their fill of wine , will give you notoriety . But fame is the voice of the whole civilized public of the world . "
32025	32029	32030	32030	I	0	" The public ! "
32034	32042	32030	32030	I	0	" The public only care for trash . "
32043	32055	32057	32057	he	124	" It is a pity you should appeal to it then ; "
32063	32254	32057	32057	he	124	" If you think so little of the public why give it anything of your brain ? It is not worthy of so rare a boon ! Come , come Tempest , - do not join in the snarl of unsuccessful authors who take refuge , when marked unsaleable , in pouring out abuse on the public . The public is the author 's best friend and truest critic . But if you prefer to despise it , in company with all the very little literature - mongers who form a mutual admiration society , I tell you what to do , - print just twenty copies of your book and present these to the leading reviewers , and when they have written you up as they will do - I 'll take care of that let your publisher advertise to the effect that the ' First and Second Large Editions ' of the new novel by Geoffrey Tempest , are exhausted , one hundred thousand copies having been sold in a week ! If that does not waken up the world in general , I shall be much surprised ! "
32268	32287	32288	32288	I	0	" It would be quite as fair a plan of action as is adopted by many modern publishers , "
32291	32336	32288	32288	I	0	" The loud hawking of literary wares now - a - days reminds me of the rival shouting of costermongers in a low neighbourhood . But I will not go quite so far , - I 'll win my fame legitimately if I can . "
32337	32342	32344	32344	Lucio	124	" You ca n't ! "
32350	32555	32344	32344	Lucio	124	" It 's impossible . You are too rich . That of itself is not legitimate in Literature , which great art generally elects to wear poverty in its button - hole as a flower of grace . The fight can not be equal in such circumstances . The fact that you are a millionaire must weigh the balance apparently in your favour for a time . The world can not resist money . If I , for example , became an author , I should probably with my wealth and influence , burn up every one else 's laurels . Suppose that a desperately poor man comes out with a book at the same time as you do , he will have scarcely the ghost of a chance against you . He will not be able to advertise in your lavish style , - nor will he see his way to dine the critics as you can . And if he should happen to have more genius than you , and you succeed , your success will not be legitimate . But after all , that does not matter much - in Art , if in nothing else , things always right themselves . "
32678	32687	32688	32688	I	0	" Are you in the dumps now Lucio ? "
32691	32701	32688	32688	I	0	" I 'm afraid my depression has proved infectious . "
32725	32730	32731	32731	he	124	" I was thinking , "
32739	32805	32731	32731	he	124	" of the last words I uttered just now , - things always right themselves . Curiously enough in art they always do , - no charlatanism or sham lasts with the gods of Parnassus . But in other matters it is different . For instance I shall never right myself ! Life is hateful to me at times , as it is to everybody . "
32806	32813	32814	32814	I	0	" Perhaps you are in love ? "
32824	32965	32731	32731	he	124	" In love ! By all the heavens and all the earths too , that suggestion wakes me with a vengeance ! In love ! What woman alive do you think could impress me with the notion that she was anything more than a frivolous doll of pink and white , with long hair frequently not her own ? And as for the tom - boy tennis - players and giantesses of the era , I do not consider them women at all , - they are merely the unnatural and strutting embryos of a new sex which will be neither male nor female . My dear Tempest , I hate women . So would you if you knew as much about them as I do . They have made me what I am , and they keep me so . "
32966	32975	32977	32977	I	0	" They are to be much complimented then , "
32980	32986	32977	32977	I	0	" You do them credit ! "
32987	32991	32992	32992	he	786	" I do ! "
32996	33003	32992	32992	he	786	" In more ways than one ! "
33030	33136	33013	33013	his	786	" Believe me , I shall never contest with you such a slight gift as woman 's love , Geoffrey . It is not worth fighting for . And apropos of women , that reminds me , - I have promised to take you to the Earl of Elton 's box at the Haymarket to - night , - he is a poor peer , very gouty and somewhat heavily flavoured with port - wine , but his daughter , Lady Sibyl , is one of the belles of England . She was presented last season and created quite a furore . Will you come ? "
33137	33144	33146	33146	I	0	" I am quite at your disposition "
33190	33197	33167	33167	Lucio	124	" What time shall we meet ? "
33198	33210	33212	33212	he	124	" Go and dress now , and join me at dinner , "
33215	33292	33212	33212	he	124	" And we 'll drive together to the theatre afterwards . The play is on the usual theme which has lately become popular with stage - managers , - the glorification of a ' fallen ' lady , and the exhibition of her as an example of something superlatively pure and good , to the astonished eyes of the innocent . As a play it is not worth seeing , - but perhaps Lady Sibyl is . "
33358	33376	33377	33377	I	0	" Do n't you find that people look at you very often as you pass , Lucio ? "
33387	33456	33384	33384	He	124	" Not at all . Why should they ? Every man is so intent on his own aims , and thinks so much of his own personality that he would scarcely forget his ego if the very devil himself were behind him . Women look at me sometimes , with the affected coy and kitten - like interest usually exhibited by the frail sex for a personable man . "
33457	33464	33465	33465	I	0	" I can not blame them ! "
33495	33516	33465	33465	I	0	" What of this Lady Sibyl we are to meet to - night , - how does she regard you ? "
33517	33525	33527	33527	he	124	" Lady Sibyl has never seen me , "
33530	33564	33527	33527	he	124	" And I have only seen her at a distance . It is chiefly for the purpose of an introduction to her that the Earl has asked us to his box this evening . "
33565	33573	33574	33574	I	0	" Ha ha ! Matrimony in view ! "
33578	33589	33591	33591	he	124	" Yes - I believe Lady Sibyl is for sale , "
33614	33646	33591	33591	he	124	" But up to the present the bids have not been sufficiently high . And I shall not purchase . I have told you already , Tempest , I hate women . "
33647	33650	33527	33527	he	124	" Seriously ? "
33651	33770	33591	33591	he	124	" Most seriously . Women have always done me harm , - they have wantonly hindered me in my progress . And why I specially abominate them is , that they have been gifted with an enormous power for doing good , and that they let this power run to waste and will not use it . Their deliberate enjoyment and choice of the repulsive , vulgar and common - place side of life disgusts me . They are much less sensitive than men , and infinitely more heartless . They are the mothers of the human race , and the faults of the race are chiefly due to them . That is another reason for my hatred . "
33771	33782	33783	33783	I	0	" Do you want the human race to be perfect ? "
33787	33800	33783	33783	I	0	" Because , if you do , you will find that impossible . "
33811	33819	33821	33821	he	789	" Everything in the Universe is perfect , "
33824	33859	33821	33821	he	789	" except that curious piece of work - Man . Have you never thought out any reason why he should be the one flaw , - the one incomplete creature in a matchless Creation ? "
33860	33867	33869	33869	I	0	" No , I have not , "
33872	33881	33869	33869	I	0	" I take things as I find them . "
33882	33887	33890	33890	he	789	" So do I , "
33894	33917	33890	33890	he	789	" And as I find them , so they find me ! Au revoir ! Dinner in an hour 's time remember ! "
34505	34518	34519	34519	she	166	" Sibyl ! Prince Rimânez and his friend , Mr Geoffrey Tempest , "
34681	34688	34689	34689	he	124	" At last , Lady Sibyl , "
34697	34725	34689	34689	he	124	" At last I have the honour of meeting you . I have seen you often , as one sees a star , - at a distance . "
34747	34758	34759	34759	she	166	" I do not think I have ever seen you , "
34762	34795	34759	34759	she	166	" And yet there is something oddly familiar in your face . I have heard my father speak of you constantly , - I need scarcely say his friends are always mine . "
34799	34818	34819	34819	he	813	" To merely speak to Lady Sibyl Elton is counted sufficient to make the man so privileged happy , "
34822	34834	34819	34819	he	813	" To be her friend is to discover the lost paradise . "
34890	34897	34898	34898	he	813	" Will you sit here Geoffrey ? "
34901	34915	34898	34898	he	813	" I want to have a moment 's business chat with Lord Elton . "
34963	34973	34974	34974	she	814	" You are a great friend of Prince Rimânez ? "
34983	34991	34992	34992	I	0	" Yes , we are very intimate , "
34995	35002	34992	34992	I	0	" He is a delightful companion . "
35003	35009	35011	35011	she	814	" So I should imagine ! "
35029	35035	35011	35011	she	814	" He is singularly handsome . "
35280	35285	35287	35287	Rimânez	124	" England has progressed ! "
35295	35332	35287	35287	Rimânez	124	" Once upon a time this play would have been hooted off the stage as likely to corrupt the social community . But now the only voice of protest comes from the ' lower ' classes . "
35333	35341	35343	35344	Lady Sibyl	166	" Are you a democrat , prince ? "
35354	35425	35343	35344	Lady Sibyl	166	" Not I ! I always insist on the pride and supremacy of worth , - I do not mean money value , but intellect . And in this way I foresee a new aristocracy . When the High grows corrupt , it falls and becomes the Low ; - when the Low educates itself and aspires , it becomes the High . This is simply the course of nature . "
35426	35434	35436	35437	Lord Elton	165	" But , God bless my soul ! "
35439	35485	35436	35437	Lord Elton	165	" you do n't call this play low or immoral do you ? It 's a realistic study of modern social life - that 's what it is . These women you know , - these poor souls with a past - are very interesting ! "
35486	35489	35491	35492	his daughter	4218	" Very ! "
35495	35531	35491	35492	his daughter	4218	" In fact it would seem that for women with no such ' past ' there can be no future ! Virtue and modesty are quite out of date , and have no chance whatever . "
35540	35555	35532	35532	I	0	" Lady Sibyl , I am glad to see this wretched play offends you . "
35569	35577	35578	35578	she	166	" Oh no , it does n't , "
35581	35710	35578	35578	she	166	" I have seen so many like it . And I have read so many novels on just the same theme ! I assure you , I am quite convinced that the so - called ' bad ' woman is the only popular type of our sex with men , - she gets all the enjoyment possible out of life , - she frequently makes an excellent marriage , and has , as the Americans say ' a good time all round . ' It 's the same thing with our convicted criminals , - in prison they are much better fed than the honest working - man . I believe it is quite a mistake for women to be respectable , - they are only considered dull . "
35711	35720	35721	35721	I	0	" Ah , now you are only joking ! "
35728	35740	35721	35721	I	0	" You know that in your heart you think very differently ! "
35765	35772	35741	35741	She	828	" having a good time all round "
35852	35860	35848	35848	Lucio	124	" I believe Lady Sibyl is for sale "
35951	35964	35947	35947	I	0	" All this loveliness is purchaseable , and I will purchase it ! "
35976	35988	35969	35969	she	166	" You are the famous Mr Tempest , are you not ? "
35989	35992	35993	35993	I	0	" Famous ? "
36002	36020	35993	35993	I	0	" Well , - I am scarcely that , - yet ! My book is not published ... "
36027	36040	36021	36021	Her	166	" Your book ? I did not know you had written one ? "
36048	36055	36056	36056	I	0	" It has been extensively advertised , "
36069	36112	36062	36062	she	166	" Oh I never read advertisements , - it 's too much trouble . When I asked if you were the famous Mr Tempest , I meant to say were you the great millionaire who has been so much talked of lately ? "
36133	36147	36148	36148	she	166	" How delightful it must be for you to have so much money ! "
36151	36163	36148	36148	she	166	" And you are young too , and good - looking . "
36177	36186	36174	36174	I	0	" You are very kind , Lady Sibyl ! "
36187	36190	36191	36191	she	166	" Why ? "
36203	36254	36191	36191	she	166	" Because I tell you the truth ? You are young and you are good - looking ! Millionaires are generally such appalling creatures . Fortune , while giving them money , frequently deprives them of both brains and personal attractiveness . And now do tell me about your book ! "
36384	36394	36395	36395	he	4230	" Come and dine , - come and dine ! "
36399	36620	36395	36395	he	4230	" Come - let me see , - this is Tuesday - come on Thursday . Short notice and no ceremony ! My wife is paralysed I 'm sorry to say , - she ca n't receive , - she can only see a few people now and then when she is in the humour , - her sister keeps house and does the honours , - Aunt Charlotte , eh Sibyl ? - ha - ha - ha ! The Deceased Wife 's Sister 's Bill would never be any use to me , for if my wife were to die I should n't be anxious to marry Miss Charlotte Fitzroy ! Ha ha ha ! A perfectly unapproachable woman sir ! - a model , - ha ha ! Come and dine with us , Mr Tempest , - Lucio , you bring him along with you , eh ? We 've got a young lady staying with us , - an American , dollars , accent and all , - and by Jove I believe she wants to marry me ha ha ha ! and is waiting for Lady Elton to go to a better world first , ha ha ! Come along - come and see the little American , eh ? Thursday shall it be ? "
36642	36646	36648	36648	she	166	" little American , "
36782	36785	36766	36766	his	124	" Well ? "
36790	36797	36798	36798	he	124	" Do n't you admire her ? "
36802	36835	36798	36798	he	124	" I must confess she is cold , - a very chilly vestal indeed , - but snow often covers volcanoes ! She has good features , and a naturally clear complexion . "
36851	36857	36859	36859	I	0	" She is perfectly beautiful , "
36863	36918	36859	36859	I	0	" The dullest eyes must see that . There is not a fault to be found with her . And she is wise to be reserved and cold - were she too lavish of her smiles and too seductive in manner , she might drive many men not only into folly , but madness . "
36934	36980	36929	36929	he	124	" Positively , Geoffrey , I believe that notwithstanding the fact that we are only in February , the wind blows upon you due south , bringing with it odours of rose and orange - blossom ! I fancy Lady Sibyl has powerfully impressed you ? "
36981	36990	36991	36991	I	0	" Did you wish me to be impressed ? "
36994	37116	37119	37119	him	844	" I ? My dear fellow , I wish nothing that you yourself do not wish . I accommodate my ways to my friends ' humours . If asked for my opinion I should say it is rather a pity if you are really smitten with the young lady , as there are no obstacles to be encountered . A love - affair , to be conducted with spirit and enterprise should always bristle with opposition and difficulty , real or invented . A little secrecy and a good deal of wrong - doing , such as sly assignations and the telling of any amount of lies - such things add to the agreeableness of love - making on this planet - "
37121	37146	37148	37148	I	0	" See here , Lucio , you are very fond of alluding to ' this ' planet as if you knew anything about other planets "
37152	37173	37148	37148	I	0	" This planet , as you somewhat contemptuously call it , is the only one we have any business with . "
37191	37197	37198	37198	he	844	" If that is so , "
37201	37272	37198	37198	he	844	" why in Heaven 's name do you not let the other planets alone ? Why do you strive to fathom their mysteries and movements ? If men , as you say , have no business with any planet save this one why are they ever on the alert to discover the secret of mightier worlds , - a secret which haply it may some day terrify them to know ! "
37299	37430	37295	37295	he	844	" Do not let us talk , my friend , of planets , not even of this particular pin 's point among them known as Earth . Let us return to a better subject - the Lady Sibyl . As I have already said , there are no obstacles in the way of your wooing and winning her , if such is your desire . Geoffrey Tempest , as mere author of books would indeed be insolent to aspire to the hand of an earl 's daughter , but Geoffrey Tempest , millionaire , will be a welcome suitor . Poor Lord Elton 's affairs are in a bad way - he is almost out - at - elbows ; - the American woman who is boarding with him - - "
37431	37436	37437	37437	I	0	" Boarding with him ! "
37440	37451	37437	37437	I	0	" Surely he does not keep a boarding - house ? "
37456	37610	37295	37295	he	844	" No , no ! - you must not put it so coarsely , Geoffrey . It is simply this , that the Earl and Countess of Elton give the prestige of their home and protection to Miss Diana Chesney the American aforesaid for the trifling sum of two thousand guineas per annum . The Countess being paralyzed , is obliged to hand over her duties of chaperonage to her sister Miss Charlotte Fitzroy , - but the halo of the coronet still hovers over Miss Chesney 's brow . She has her own suite of rooms in the house , and goes wherever it is proper for her to go , under Miss Fitzroy 's care . Lady Sibyl does not like the arrangement , and is therefore never seen anywhere except with her father . She will not join in companionship with Miss Chesney , and has said so pretty plainly . "
37611	37618	37619	37619	I	0	" I admire her for it ! "
37623	37635	37619	37619	I	0	" I really am surprised that Lord Elton should condescend - - "
37636	37641	37643	37643	Lucio	124	" Condescend to what ? "
37645	37733	37643	37643	Lucio	124	" Condescend to take two thousand guineas a year ? Good heavens man , there are no end of lords and ladies who will readily agree to perform such an act of condescension . ' Blue ' blood is getting thin and poor , and only money can thicken it . Diana Chesney is worth over a million dollars and if Lady Elton were to die conveniently soon , I should not be surprised to see that ' little American ' step triumphantly into her vacant place . "
37734	37743	37744	37744	I	0	" What a state of topsy - turveydom ! "
37750	37915	37643	37643	Lucio	124	" Geoffrey , my friend , you are really amazingly inconsistent ! Is there a more flagrant example of topsy - turveydom than yourself for instance ? Six weeks ago , what were you ? A mere scribbler , with flutterings of the wings of genius in your soul , but many uncertainties as to whether those wings would ever be strong enough to lift you out of the rut of obscurity in which you floundered , struggling and grumbling at adverse fate . Now , as millionaire , you think contemptuously of an Earl , because he ventures quite legitimately to add a little to his income by boarding an American heiress and launching her into society where she would never get without him . And you aspire , or probably mean to aspire to the hand of the Earl 's daughter , as if you yourself were a descendant of kings . Nothing can be more topsy - turvey than your condition ! "
37916	37923	37924	37924	I	0	" My father was a gentleman , "
37933	37960	37924	37924	I	0	" and a descendant of gentlemen . We were never common folk , - our family was one of the most highly esteemed in the counties . "
37964	38143	37961	37961	Lucio	124	" I do not doubt it , my dear fellow , - I do not in the least doubt it . But a simple ' gentleman ' is a long way below - or above - an Earl . Have it which side you choose ! - because it really does n't matter nowadays . We have come to a period of history when rank and lineage count as nothing at all , owing to the profoundly obtuse stupidity of those who happen to possess it . So it chances , that as no resistance is made , brewers are created peers of the realm , and ordinary tradesmen are knighted , and the very old families are so poor that they have to sell their estates and jewels to the highest bidder , who is frequently a vulgar ' railway - king ' or the introducer of some new manure . You occupy a better position than such , since you inherit your money with the farther satisfaction that you do not know how it was made . "
38144	38147	38148	38148	I	0	" True ! "
38164	38199	38161	38161	I	0	" By the way I never told you that my deceased relative imagined that he had sold his soul to the devil , and that this vast fortune of his was the material result ! "
38209	38215	38216	38216	he	124	" No ! Not possible ! "
38220	38273	38216	38216	he	124	" What an idea ! I suppose he had a screw loose somewhere ! Imagine any sane man believing in a devil ! Ha , ha , ha ! And in these advanced days too ! Well , well ! The folly of human imaginations will never end ! Here we are ! "
38289	38311	38276	38276	he	124	" I will say good - night to you , Tempest . I 've promised to go and have a gamble . "
38312	38318	38353	38353	I	0	" A gamble ? Where ? "
38319	38352	38276	38276	he	124	" At one of the select private clubs . There are any amount of them in this eminently moral metropolis - no occasion to go to Monte Carlo ! Will you come ? "
38399	38405	38407	38407	I	0	" Not to - night ; "
38418	38451	38415	38415	I	0	" It must be rather a one - sided affair for other men to gamble with you , Lucio ! You can afford to lose , - and perhaps they ca n't . "
38452	38463	38465	38465	he	847	" If they ca n't , they should n't play , "
38468	38575	38465	38465	he	847	" A man should at least know his own mind and his own capacity ; if he does n't , he is no man at all . As far as I have learned by long experience , those who gamble like it , and when they like it , I like it . I 'll take you with me to - morrow if you care to see the fun , - one or two very eminent men are members of the club , though of course they would n't have it known for worlds . You sha n't lose much - I 'll see to that . "
38576	38588	38590	38590	I	0	" All right , - to - morrow it shall be ! "
38611	38628	38590	38590	I	0	" But to - night I think I 'll write some letters before going to bed . "
38629	38638	38640	38640	Lucio	124	" Yes - and dream of Lady Sibyl ! "
38643	38664	38640	38640	Lucio	124	" If she fascinates you as much when you see her again on Thursday you had better begin the siege ! "
38904	38911	38913	38913	he	124	" We shall publish next week , "
38934	39123	38913	38913	he	124	" And as you do n't mind what you spend , I 'll tell you just what I propose to do . I intend to write out a mystifying paragraph of about some seventy lines or so , describing the book in a vague sort of way as ' likely to create a new era of thought ' - or , ' ere long everybody who is anybody will be compelled to read this remarkable work , ' - or ' as something that must be welcome to all who would understand the drift of one of the most delicate and burning questions of the time . ' These are all stock phrases , used over and over again by the reviewers , - there 's no copyright in them . And the last one always ' tells ' wonderfully , considering how old it is , and how often it has been made to do duty , because any allusion to a ' delicate and burning question ' makes a number of people think the novel must be improper , and they send for it at once ! "
39207	39214	39216	39216	he	124	" The book has been splendidly advertised "
39220	39301	39216	39216	he	124	" It could not have been more lavishly done . Orders do not come in very fast yet - but they will , - they will . This paragraph of mine , which will take the shape of a ' leaderette , ' I can get inserted in about eight hundred to a thousand newspapers here and in America . It will cost you , - say a hundred guineas - perhaps a trifle more . Do you mind that ? "
39302	39308	39309	39309	I	0	" Not in the least ! "
39336	39355	39331	39331	his	124	" You understand I suppose , that I shall only issue two hundred and fifty copies at first ? "
39369	39376	39377	39377	I	0	" Such an idea is ridiculous ! "
39380	39393	39377	39377	I	0	" you can not supply the trade with such a scanty edition . "
39394	39452	39331	39331	his	124	" Wait , my dear sir , wait , - you are too impatient . You do not give me time to explain . All these two hundred and fifty will be given away by me in the proper quarters on the day of publication , - never mind how , - they must be given away - "
39453	39456	39377	39377	I	0	" Why ? "
39457	39460	39331	39331	his	124	" Why ? "
39468	39601	39462	39464	the worthy Morgeson	174	" I see , my dear Mr Tempest , you are like most men of genius - you do not understand business . The reason why we give the first two hundred and fifty copies away is in order to be able to announce at once in all the papers that ' The First Large Edition of the New Novel by Geoffrey Tempest being exhausted on the day of publication , a Second is in Rapid Preparation . ' You see we thus hoodwink the public , who of course are not in our secrets , and are not to know whether an edition is two hundred or two thousand . The Second Edition will of course be ready behind the scenes , and will consist of another two hundred and fifty . "
39602	39612	39613	39613	I	0	" Do you call that course of procedure honest ? "
39617	39626	39628	39628	his	174	" Honest ? My dear sir ! Honest ? "
39636	39781	39628	39628	his	174	" Of course it is honest ! Look at the daily papers ! Such announcements appear every day - in fact they are getting rather too common . I freely admit that there are a few publishers here and there who stick up for exactitude and go to the trouble of not only giving the number of copies in an Edition , but also publishing the date of each one as it was issued , - this may be principle if they like to call it so , but it involves a great deal of precise calculation and worry ! If the public like to be deceived , what is the use of being exact ! Now , to resume , - your second edition will be sent off ' on sale or return ' to provincial booksellers , and then we shall announce - "
39817	39917	40090	40090	Morgeson	174	" And so on , and so on , till we get to the sixth or seventh edition always numbering two hundred and fifty each in three volumes ; perhaps we can by skilful management work it to a tenth . It is only a question of diplomacy and a little dexterous humbugging of the trade . Then we shall arrive at the one - volume issue , which will require different handling . But there 's time enough for that . The frequent advertisements will add to the expense a bit , but if you do n't mind - "
39918	39925	39926	39926	I	0	" I do n't mind anything , "
39938	39938	39926	39926	I	0	"
39939	39943	39944	39944	he	174	" Your fun ? "
39948	39961	39944	39944	he	174	" I thought it was fame you wanted , more than fun ! "
39966	39983	39984	39984	I	0	" I 'm not such a fool as to suppose that fame is secured by advertisement , "
39987	40072	39984	39984	I	0	" For instance I am one of those who think the fame of Millais as an artist was marred when he degraded himself to the level of painting the little green boy blowing bubbles of Pears 's Soap . That was an advertisement . And that very incident in his career , trifling though it seems , will prevent his ever standing on the same dignified height of distinction with such masters in art as Romney , Sir Peter Lely , Gainsborough or Reynolds . "
40073	40088	40092	40092	his	174	" I believe there is a great deal of justice in what you say ; "
40096	40109	40092	40092	his	174	" Viewed from a purely artistic and sentimental standpoint you are right . "
40118	40182	40111	40111	he	174	" Yes , - it is a most extraordinary thing how fame does escape people sometimes just when they seem on the point of grasping it . They are ' boomed ' in every imaginable way , and yet after a time nothing will keep them up . And there are others again who get kicked and buffeted and mocked and derided - - "
40183	40187	40188	40188	I	0	" Like Christ ? "
40224	40226	40229	40229	he	174	" Yes "
40232	40275	40229	40229	he	174	" as you suggest , Mr Tempest , like Christ . Mocked and derided and opposed at every turn , - and yet by the queerest caprice of destiny , they succeed in winning a world - wide fame and power - - "
40276	40281	40282	40282	I	0	" Like Christ again ! "
40297	40300	40301	40301	He	174	" Exactly ! "
40318	40341	40315	40315	he	174	" But I was not thinking of the Great Example just then , Mr Tempest - I was thinking of a woman . "
40342	40345	40346	40346	I	0	" Indeed ! "
40350	40379	40382	40382	he	174	" Yes - a woman , who despite continued abuse and opposition is rapidly becoming celebrated . You are sure to hear of her in literary and social circles "
40392	40483	40382	40382	he	174	" but she is not rich , you know , - only famous . However , - we have nothing to do with her just now - so let us return to business . The one uncertain point in the matter of your book 's success is the attitude of the critics . There are only six leading men who do the reviews , and between them they cover all the English magazines and some of the American too , as well as the London papers . Here are their names "
40494	40675	40486	40486	he	174	" and their addresses , as far as I can ascertain them , or the addresses of the papers for which they most frequently write . The man at the head of the list , David McWhing , is the most formidable of the lot . He writes everywhere about everything , - being a Scotchman he 's bound to have his finger in every pie . If you can secure McWhing , you need not trouble so much about the others , as he generally gives the ' lead , ' and has his own way with the editors . He is one of the ' personal friends ' of the editor of the Nineteenth Century for example , and you would be sure to get a notice there , which would otherwise be impossible . No reviewer can review anything for that magazine unless he is one of the editor 's friends . 2 You must manage McWhing , or he might , just for the sake of ' showing off , ' cut you up rather roughly . "
40676	40682	40683	40683	I	0	" That would not matter , "
40697	40708	40683	40683	I	0	" A little slating always helps a book to sell . "
40709	40716	40721	40721	his	174	" In some cases it does , "
40726	40773	40721	40721	his	174	" But in others it most emphatically does not . Where there is any very decided or daring originality , adverse criticism is always the most effective . But a work like yours requires fostering with favour , - wants ' booming ' in short - - "
40774	40778	40780	40780	I	0	" I see ! "
40785	40798	40780	40780	I	0	" You do n't think my book original enough to stand alone ? "
40799	40817	40819	40819	he	174	" My dear sir ! - you are really - really - ! what shall I say ? "
40823	40916	40819	40819	he	174	" a little brusque ? I think your book shows admirable scholarship and delicacy of thought , - if I find fault with it at all , it is perhaps because I am dense . The only thing it lacks in my opinion is what I should call tenaciousness , for want of a better expression , - the quality of holding the reader 's fancy fixed like a nail . But after all this is a common failing of modern literature ; few authors feel sufficiently themselves to make others feel . "
40938	40941	40942	40942	I	0	" Well ! "
40947	40980	40942	40942	I	0	" If I had no feeling when I wrote the book , I certainly have none now . Why man , I felt every line of it ! - painfully and intensely ! "
40981	40987	40989	40989	Morgeson	174	" Ay , ay indeed ! "
40992	41102	40989	40989	Morgeson	174	" Or perhaps you thought you felt , which is another very curious phase of the literary temperament . You see , to convince people at all , you must first yourself be convinced . The result of this is generally a singular magnetic attraction between author and public . However I am a bad hand at argument , - and it is possible that in hasty reading I may have gathered a wrong impression of your intentions . Anyhow the book shall be a success if we can make it so . All I venture to ask of you is that you should personally endeavour to manage McWhing ! "
41287	41293	41295	41295	he	124	" Morgeson is quite right , "
41298	41369	41295	41295	he	124	" McWhing is intimate with the rest of these fellows - they meet at the same clubs , dine at the same cheap restaurants and make love to the same painted ballet - girls . All in a comfortable little fraternal union together , and one obliges the other on their several journals when occasion offers . Oh yes ! I should make up to McWhing if I were you . "
41370	41374	41375	41375	I	0	" But how ? "
41409	41421	41402	41402	I	0	" I can not ask any favour of a press critic . "
41422	41427	41429	41429	Lucio	124	" Of course not ! "
41434	41514	41429	41429	Lucio	124	" If you were to do such an idiotic thing what a slating you 'd get for your pains ! There 's no sport a critic loves so much as the flaying of an author who has made the mistake of lowering himself to the level of asking favours of his intellectual inferiors ! No , no , my dear fellow ! - we shall manage McWhing quite differently , - I know him , though you do not . "
41515	41523	41524	41524	I	0	" Come , that 's good news ! "
41527	41539	41524	41524	I	0	" Upon my word Lucio , you seem to know everybody . "
41540	41550	41552	41552	Lucio	124	" I think I know most people worth knowing - "
41555	42006	41552	41552	Lucio	124	" Though I by no means include Mr McWhing in the category of worthiness . I happened to make his personal acquaintance in a somewhat singular and exciting manner . It was in Switzerland , on that awkward ledge of rock known as the Mauvais Pas . I had been some weeks in the neighbourhood on business of my own , and being surefooted and fearless , was frequently allowed by the guides to volunteer my services with theirs . In this capacity of amateur guide , capricious destiny gave me the pleasure of escorting the timid and bilious McWhing across the chasms of the Mer de Glace , and I conversed with him in the choicest French all the while , a language of which , despite his boasted erudition , he was deplorably ignorant . I knew who he was I must tell you , as I know most of his craft , and had long been aware of him as one of the authorised murderers of aspiring genius . When I got him on the Mauvais Pas , I saw that he was seized with vertigo ; I held him firmly by the arm and addressed him in sound strong English thus - ' Mr McWhing , you wrote a damnable and scurrilous article against the work of a certain poet ' and I named the man - ' an article that was a tissue of lies from beginning to end , and which by its cruelty and venom embittered a life of brilliant promise , and crushed a noble spirit . Now , unless you promise to write and publish in a leading magazine a total recantation of this your crime when you get back to England , - if you get back ! - giving that wronged man the ' honourable mention ' he rightly deserves , - down you go ! I have but to loosen my hold ! ' Geoffrey , you should have seen McWhing then ! He whined , he wriggled , he clung ! Never was an oracle of the press in such an unoracular condition . ' Murder ! - murder ! ' he gasped , but his voice failed him . Above him towered the snow peaks like the summits of that Fame he could not reach and therefore grudged to others , - below him the glittering ice - waves yawned in deep transparent hollows of opaline blue and green , - and afar off the tinkling cowbells echoed through the still air , suggestive of safe green pastures and happy homes . ' Murder ! ' he whispered gurglingly . ' Nay ! ' said I , "
42427	42427	42405	42407	all the gods	883	"
42433	42438	42440	42440	I	0	" But he did know "
42443	42452	42440	42440	I	0	" Did you not say you exchanged cards ? "
42453	42461	42463	42463	Lucio	124	" True , but that was afterwards ! "
42466	42482	42463	42463	Lucio	124	" I assure you , my dear fellow , we can ' manage ' McWhing ! "
42529	42541	42522	42522	I	0	" You would certainly have made a superb actor , Lucio ! "
42542	42552	42553	42553	he	124	" How do you know I am not one ? "
42565	42692	42561	42561	he	124	" No , - there is no occasion to paint the face and prance over the boards before a row of tawdry footlights like the paid mimes , in order to be histrionically great . The finest actor is he who can play the comedy of life perfectly , as I aspire to do . To walk well , talk well , smile well , weep well , groan well , laugh well - and die well ! - it is all pure acting , - because in every man there is the dumb dreadful immortal Spirit who is real , - who can not act , - who Is , - and who steadily maintains an infinite though speechless protest against the body 's Lie ! "
43828	43836	43837	43837	he	921	" Well , I 'm cleaned out ! "
43846	43863	43837	43837	he	921	" You must give me my chance of a revanche to - morrow , Mr Tempest ! "
43867	43871	43872	43872	He	921	" With pleasure ! "
43966	43976	43977	43977	he	124	" Will you make up another game with me ? "
43980	43989	43992	43992	he	124	" I 'll start the bank with this , "
44050	44057	44058	44058	he	935	" I ca n't stake anything , "
44061	44091	44058	44058	he	935	" I 've already told you I 'm cleaned out , - ' stony - broke , ' as the slang goes . It 's no use my joining . "
44092	44101	44103	44106	one man near him	936	" Sit down , sit down , Lynton ! "
44108	44119	44103	44106	one man near him	936	" I 'll lend you enough to go on with . "
44120	44128	44129	44129	he	124	" Thanks , I 'd rather not ! "
44136	44168	44129	44129	he	124	" I 'm too much in your debt already . Awfully good of you all the same . You go on , you fellows , and I 'll watch the play . "
44169	44177	44179	44179	Lucio	124	" Let me persuade you Viscount Lynton , "
44190	44226	44179	44179	Lucio	124	" just for the fun of the thing ! If you do not feel justified in staking money , stake something trifling and merely nominal , for the sake of seeing whether the luck will turn "
44236	44264	44230	44230	he	124	" This frequently represents fifty pounds , - let it represent for once something that is not valuable like money , - your soul , for example ! "
44281	44308	44310	44310	he	124	" We all have , I hope , enough instruction in modern science to be aware that there is no such thing as a soul in existence "
44313	44372	44310	44310	he	124	" Therefore , in proposing it as a stake for this game at baccarat , I really propose less than one hair of your head , because the hair is a something , and the soul is a nothing ! Come ! Will you risk that non - existent quantity for the chance of winning a thousand pounds ? "
44396	44399	44400	44400	he	935	" Done ! "
44454	44459	44460	44460	he	935	" I have won ! "
44464	44515	44460	44460	he	935	" But you owe me nothing , my dear Viscount , inasmuch as you risked - Nothing ! We played this game simply for fun . If souls had any existence of course I should claim yours ; - I wonder what I should do with it by the way ! "
44522	44607	44516	44516	He	935	" What nonsense , is n't it ! - and how thankful we ought to be that we live in advanced days like the present , when such silly superstitions are being swept aside by the march of progress and pure Reason ! Good - night ! Tempest and I will give you , your full revenge to - morrow , - the luck is sure to change by then , and you will probably have the victory . Again - good - night ! "
44703	44711	44712	44712	he	935	" You are an awfully good fellow ! "
44722	44779	44712	44712	he	935	" And I assure you seriously if I had a soul I should be very glad to part with it for a thousand pounds at the present moment . The soul would n't be an atom of use to me and the thousand pounds would . But I feel convinced I shall win to - morrow ! "
44780	44788	44790	44790	Lucio	124	" I am equally sure you will ! "
44793	44829	44832	44832	he	935	" In the meantime , you will not find my friend here , Geoffrey Tempest , a hard creditor , - he can afford to wait . But in the case of the lost soul , "
44845	44855	44832	44832	he	935	" of course I can not afford to wait ! "
44892	44895	44899	44899	them	948	" Ruined ! "
44906	44917	44832	44832	he	935	" His gambling debts are more than he can ever pay "
44922	44937	44832	44832	he	935	" And I hear he has lost a clear fifty thousand on the turf . "
45160	45187	45188	45188	he	531	" Tempest , if you are going to be kind - hearted or sympathetic to undeserving rascals , I shall have to part company with you ! "
45203	45326	45188	45188	he	531	" I see by the expression of your face that you are meditating some silly disinterested action of pure generosity . Now you might just as well flop down on these paving stones and begin saying prayers in public . You want to let Lynton off his debt , - you are a fool for your pains . He is a born scoundrel , - and has never seen his way to being anything else , - why should you compassionate him ? From the time he first went to college till now , he has been doing nothing but live a life of degraded sensuality , - he is a worthless rake , less to be respected than an honest dog ! "
45327	45336	45337	45337	I	0	" Yet some one loves him I daresay ! "
45340	45346	45348	45348	Lucio	124	" Some one loves him ! "
45353	45493	45348	45348	Lucio	124	" Bah ! Three ballet girls live on him if that is what you mean . His mother loved him , - but she is dead , - he broke her heart . He is no good I tell you , - let him pay his debt in full , even to the soul he staked so lightly . If I were the devil now , and had just won the strange game we played to - night , I suppose according to priestly tradition , I should be piling up the fire for Lynton in high glee , - but being what I am , I say let the man alone to make his own destiny , - let things take their course , - and as he chose to risk everything , so let him pay everything . "
45545	45551	45552	45552	I	0	" Why there he is ! "
45555	45561	45552	45552	I	0	" there is Viscount Lynton ! "
45571	45584	45562	45562	Lucio	124	" You do n't want to speak to him now , surely ! "
45585	45601	45562	45562	Lucio	124	" No . But I wonder where he 's going ? He walks rather unsteadily . "
45602	45608	45562	45562	Lucio	124	" Drunk , most probably ! "
45669	45672	45666	45666	he	935	" Hansom ! "
45720	45724	45725	45725	I	0	" Good God ! "
45734	45740	45725	45725	I	0	" He has shot himself ! "
45815	45821	45822	45822	he	124	" Keep cool , Geoffrey ! "
45825	45891	45822	45822	he	124	" Do you want to be called up to identify ? And betray the club and all its members ? Not while I am here to prevent you ! Check your mad impulses , my good fellow , - they will lead you into no end of difficulties . If the man 's dead he 's dead , and there 's an end of it . "
45892	45900	45901	45901	I	0	" Lucio ! You have no heart ! "
45912	45975	45901	45901	I	0	" How can you stop to reason in such a case ! Think of it ! I am the cause of all the mischief ! - it is my cursed luck at baccarat this evening that has been the final blow to the wretched young fellow 's fortunes , - I am convinced of it ! - I shall never forgive myself - "
45976	45989	45990	45990	he	124	" Upon my word , Geoffrey , your conscience is very tender ! "
46006	46129	45990	45990	he	124	" You must try and toughen it a little if you want to be successful in life . Your ' cursed luck ' you think , has caused Lynton 's death ? Surely it is a contradiction in terms to call luck ' cursed , ' - and as for the Viscount , he did not need that last game at baccarat to emphasise his ruin . You are not to blame . And for the sake of the club , if for nothing else , I do not intend either you or myself to be mixed up in a case of suicide . The coroner 's verdict always disposes of these incidents comfortably in two words - ' Temporary insanity . ' "
46178	46183	46186	46186	Lucio	124	" ' Temporary insanity ' "
46195	46272	46186	46186	Lucio	124	" all remorse , despair , outraged honour , wasted love , together with the scientific modern theory of Reasonable Nothingness - Life a Nothing , God a Nothing , - when these drive the distracted human unit to make of himself also a nothing , ' temporary insanity ' covers up his plunge into the infinite with an untruthful pleasantness . However , after all , it is as Shakespeare says , a mad world ! "
46327	46330	46331	46331	I	0	" Perhaps , "
46334	46349	46331	46331	I	0	" he has not really killed himself ? It may be only an attempt ? "
46350	46356	46359	46359	Lucio	124	" He was a capital shot "
46363	46391	46359	46359	Lucio	124	" That was his one quality . He has no principles , - but he was a good marksman . I can not imagine his missing aim . "
46392	46416	46331	46331	I	0	" It is horrible ! An hour ago alive , ... and now ... I tell you , Lucio , it is horrible ! "
46417	46434	46436	46436	he	124	" What is ? Death ? It is not half so horrible as Life lived wrongly , "
46453	46563	46436	46436	he	124	" Believe me , the mental sickness and confusion of a wilfully degraded existence are worse tortures than are contained in the priestly notions of Hell . Come come , Geoffrey , you take this matter too much to heart , - you are not to blame . If Lynton has given himself the ' happy dispatch ' it is really the best thing he could do , - he was of no use to anybody , and he is well out of it . It is positively weak of you to attach importance to such a trifle . You are only at the beginning of your career - - "
46564	46588	46590	46590	I	0	" Well , I hope that career will not lead me into any more such tragedies as the one enacted to - night , "
46594	46607	46590	46590	I	0	" If it does , it will be entirely against my will ! "
46614	46623	46625	46625	he	124	" Nothing can happen to you against your will "
46628	46702	46625	46625	he	124	" I suppose you wish to imply that I am to blame for introducing you to the club ? My good fellow , you need not have gone there unless you had chosen to do so ! I did not bind and drag you there ! You are upset and unnerved , - come into my room and take a glass of wine , - you will feel more of a man afterwards . "
46775	46787	46788	46788	I	0	" That last stake of Lynton 's , ... to you - "
46792	46797	46788	46788	I	0	" His soul - - "
46798	46814	46816	46816	Lucio	124	" Which he did not believe in , and which you do not believe in ! "
46822	46884	46816	46816	Lucio	124	" Why do you now seem to tremble at a mere sentimental idea ? If fantastic notions such as God , the Soul , and the Devil were real facts , there would perhaps be cause for trembling , but being only the brainsick imaginations of superstitious mankind , there is nothing in them to awaken the slightest anxiety or fear . "
46885	46888	46890	46890	I	0	" But you "
46893	46902	46890	46890	I	0	" you say you believe in the soul ? "
46903	46910	46912	46912	he	124	" I ? I am brainsick ! "
46916	46972	46912	46912	he	124	" Have you not found that out yet ? Much learning hath driven me mad , my friend ! Science has led me into such deep wells of dark discovery , that it is no wonder if my senses sometimes reel , - and I believe - at such insane moments - in the Soul ! "
46977	46986	46987	46987	I	0	" I think I will go to bed , "
46990	47001	46987	46987	I	0	" I am tired out , - and absolutely miserable ! "
47002	47008	47010	47010	Lucio	124	" Alas , poor millionaire ! "
47014	47031	47010	47010	Lucio	124	" I am sorry , I assure you , that the evening has ended so disastrously . "
47032	47037	47038	47038	I	0	" So am I ! "
47042	47046	47047	47047	he	124	" Imagine it ! "
47055	47113	47047	47047	he	124	" If my beliefs , - my crack - brained theories , - were worth anything , - which they are not - I could claim the only positive existing part of our late acquaintance Viscount Lynton ! But , - where and how to send in my account with him ? If I were Satan now .... "
47120	47128	47129	47129	I	0	" You would have cause to rejoice ! "
47148	47152	47155	47155	his	124	" No , Geoffrey "
47166	47221	47155	47155	his	124	" No , my friend ! If I were Satan I should probably lament ! - for every lost soul would of necessity remind me of my own fall , my own despair , - and set another bar between myself and heaven ! Remember , - the very Devil was an Angel once ! "
47652	47655	47681	47682	the Figures	189	" Misery ! "
47735	47738	47752	47752	I	0	" Misery ! "
47831	47834	47809	47809	their	981	" Misery ! "
48018	48032	48014	48014	I	0	" No ! No ! Not that eternal Doom ! ... Not yet ! "
48431	48441	48442	48442	he	124	" I told you he was a good shot ! "
48526	48537	48538	48538	he	124	" That old Tokay was evidently too strong for you ! "
48548	48556	48557	48557	I	0	" Did you give me old Tokay ? "
48561	48611	48557	48557	I	0	" Then the mystery is explained ! I was already overwrought , and needed no stimulant . But what tricks the imagination plays us to be sure ! You have no idea of the distinct manner in which those three phantoms asserted themselves ! The impression was extraordinarily vivid . "
48612	48616	48618	48618	his	124	" No doubt ! "
48625	48647	48618	48618	his	124	" Impressions often are very vivid . See what a marvellously real impression this world makes upon us , for example ! "
48648	48658	48659	48659	I	0	" Ah ! But then the world is real ! "
48662	48876	48884	48884	his	989	" Is it ? You accept it as such , I daresay , and things are as they appear to each separate individual . No two human beings think alike ; hence there may be conflicting opinions as to the reality or non - reality of this present world . But we will not take unnecessary plunges into the infinite question of what is , as contrasted with what appears to be . I have some letters here for your consideration . You have lately spoken of buying a country estate - what say you to Willowsmere Court in Warwickshire ? I have had my eye on that place for you , - it seems to me just the very thing . It is a magnificent old pile ; part of it dates from Elizabeth 's time . It is in excellent repair ; the grounds are most picturesque , the classic river Avon winds with rather a broad sweep through the park , - and the whole thing , with a great part of the furniture included , is to be sold for a mere song ; - fifty thousand pounds cash . I think you had better go in for it ; it would just suit your literary and poetic tastes . "
48915	48959	48884	48884	his	989	" Anything you recommend must be worth looking at , and I 'll certainly go and see it . The description sounds well , and Shakespeare 's country always appeals to me . But would n't you like to secure it for yourself ? "
48963	49032	48884	48884	his	989	" Not I ! I live nowhere for long . I am of a roving disposition , and am never happy tied down to one corner of the earth . But I suggest Willowsmere to you for two reasons , - first that it is charming and perfectly appointed ; secondly , that it will impress Lord Elton considerably if he knows you are going to buy it . "
49033	49037	48884	48884	his	989	" How so ? "
49038	49048	49051	49051	Lucio	124	" Why , because it used to be his property "
49054	49171	49051	49051	Lucio	124	" till he got into the hands of the Jews . He gave them Willowsmere as security for loans , and latterly they have stepped in as owners . They 've sold most of the pictures , china , bric - a - brac and other valuables . By the way , have you noticed how the legended God still appears to protect the house of Israel ? Particularly the ' base usurer ' who is allowed to get the unhappy Christian into his clutches nine times out of ten ? And no remedy drops from heaven ! The Jew always triumphs . Rather inconsistent is n't it , on the part of an equitable Deity ! "
49182	49229	49179	49179	he	124	" As a result of Lord Elton 's unfortunate speculations , and the Jews ' admirable shrewdness , Willowsmere , as I tell you is in the market , and fifty thousand pounds will make you the envied owner of a place worth a hundred thousand . "
49230	49245	49246	49246	I	0	" We dine at the Eltons ' to - night , do we not ? "
49250	49268	49269	49269	he	124	" We do . You can not have forgotten that engagement and Lady Sibyl so soon surely ! "
49273	49280	49282	49282	I	0	" No , I have not forgotten "
49292	49322	49282	49282	I	0	" And I will buy this Willowsmere . I will telegraph instructions to my lawyers at once . Will you give me the name and address of the agents ? "
49323	49331	49333	49333	Lucio	124	" With pleasure , my dear boy ! "
49351	49381	49333	49333	Lucio	124	" But are you not making up your mind rather suddenly ? Had n't you better inspect the property first ? There may be things you object to - - "
49382	49392	49393	49393	I	0	" If it were a rat - infested barrack , "
49397	49431	49393	49393	I	0	" I would still buy it ! I shall settle the matter at once . I wish to let Lord Elton know this very night that I am the future owner of Willowsmere ! "
49432	49435	49441	49441	his	531	" Good ! "
49454	49502	49441	49441	his	531	" I like your swiftness of action Geoffrey . It is admirable ! I always respect determination . Even if a man makes up his mind to go to hell , I honour him for keeping to his word , and going there straight as a die ! "
49624	49629	49631	49631	he	164	" Excuse me sir , "
49635	49657	49631	49631	he	164	" but I daresay you 've noticed that there 's something unpleasant - like about the prince 's valet , Amiel ? "
49658	49676	49678	49678	I	0	" Well , he 's rather a down - looking fellow if that 's what you mean , "
49681	49692	49678	49678	I	0	" But I suppose there 's no harm in him . "
49693	49702	49705	49705	Morris	164	" I do n't know about that sir , "
49708	49748	49705	49705	Morris	164	" He does a great many strange things I do assure you . Downstairs with the servants he goes on something surprising . Sings and acts and dances too , as if he were a whole music - hall . "
49749	49752	49753	49753	I	0	" Really ! "
49758	49766	49753	49753	I	0	" I should never have thought it . "
49767	49779	49705	49705	Morris	164	" Nor should I sir , but it 's a fact . "
49780	49790	49792	49792	I	0	" He must be rather an amusing fellow then , "
49811	49823	49826	49826	Morris	164	" Oh , I do n't say anything against his amusingness , "
49835	49971	49826	49826	Morris	164	" It 's all very well for him to cut capers and make himself agreeable if he likes , - but it 's the deceit of him that surprises me sir . You 'd think to look at him that he was a decent sort of dull chap with no ideas beyond his duty , but really sir , it 's quite the contrary , if you 'll believe me . The language he uses when he 's up to his games downstairs is something frightful ! And he actually swears he learnt it from the gentlemen of the turf , sir ! Last night he was play acting , and taking off all the fashionable folks , - then he took to hypnotising - and upon my word it made my blood run cold . "
49972	49980	49981	49981	I	0	" Why , what did he do ? "
49987	50188	49826	49826	Morris	164	" Well , sir , he took one of the scullery - maids and sat her in a chair and just pointed at her . Pointed at her and grinned , for all the world like a devil out of a pantomime . And though she is generally a respectable sober young woman , if she did n't get up with a screech and commence dancing round and round like a lunatic , while he kept on pointing . And presently she got to jumping and lifting her skirts that high that it was positively scandalous ! Some of us tried to stop her and could n't ; she was like mad , till all at once number twenty - two bell rang - that 's the prince 's room , - and he just caught hold of her , set her down in her chair again and clapped his hands . She came to directly , and did n't know a bit what she 'd been doing . Then twenty - two bell rang again , and the fellow rolled up his eyes like a clergyman and said , ' Let us pray ! ' and off he went . "
50192	50204	50206	50206	I	0	" He seems to have a share of humour at anyrate , "
50209	50230	50206	50206	I	0	" I should not have thought it of him . But do you think these antics of his are mischievous ? "
50231	50243	50246	50246	Morris	164	" Well that scullery girl is very ill to - day , "
50248	50317	50246	50246	Morris	164	" I expect she 'll have to leave . She has what she calls the ' jumps ' and none of us dare tell her how she got them . No sir , believe me or not as you like , there 's something very queer about that Amiel . And another thing I want to know is this - what does he do with the other servants ? "
50318	50328	50329	50329	I	0	" What does he do with the other servants ? "
50333	50341	50329	50329	I	0	" What on earth do you mean ? "
50342	50358	50360	50360	Morris	164	" Well sir , the prince has a chef of his own has n't he ? "
50366	50499	50360	50360	Morris	164	" And two personal attendants besides Amiel , - quiet fellows enough who help in the waiting . Then he has a coachman and groom . That makes six servants altogether . Now none of these except Amiel are ever seen in the hotel kitchens . The chef sends all the meals in from somewhere , in a heated receptacle - and the two other fellows are never seen except when waiting at table , and they do n't live in their own rooms all day , though they may sleep there , - and nobody knows where the carriage and horses are put up , or where the coachman and groom lodge . Certain it is that both they and the chef board out . It seems to me very mysterious . "
50508	50514	50515	50515	I	0	" Look here , Morris , "
50518	50654	50515	50515	I	0	" There 's nothing more useless or more harmful than the habit of inquiring into other people 's affairs . The prince has a right to live as he likes , and do as he pleases with his servants - I am sure he pays royally for his privileges . And whether his cook lives in or out , up in the skies or down in a cellar is no matter of mine . He has been a great traveller and no doubt has his peculiarities ; and probably his notions concerning food are very particular and fastidious . But I do n't want to know anything about his ménage . If you dislike Amiel , it 's easy to avoid him , but for goodness sake do n't go making mysteries where none exist . "
50683	50689	50691	50691	he	164	" Very well , sir , "
50746	50757	50759	50759	he	124	" Amiel 's spirits are often too much for him , "
50762	50777	50759	50759	he	124	" He is a perfect imp of mischief and can not always control himself . "
50778	50791	50792	50792	I	0	" Why , what a wrong estimate I have formed of him ! "
50795	50808	50792	50792	I	0	" I thought he had a peculiarly grave and somewhat sullen disposition . "
50809	50820	50823	50824	my companion	531	" You know the trite saying - appearances are deceptive ? "
50827	50899	50823	50824	my companion	531	" It 's extremely true . The professed humourist is nearly always a disagreeable and heavy man personally . As for Amiel , he is like me in the respect of not being at all what he seems . His only fault is a tendency to break the bounds of discipline , but otherwise he serves me well , and I do not inquire further . Is Morris disgusted or alarmed ? "
50900	50905	50906	50906	I	0	" Neither I think , "
50910	50924	50906	50906	I	0	" He merely presents himself to me as an example of outraged respectability . "
50925	50951	50953	50953	Lucio	124	" Ah then , you may be sure that when the scullery - maid was dancing , he observed her steps with the closest nicety ; "
50955	51117	50953	50953	Lucio	124	" Very respectable men are always particular of inspection into these matters ! Soothe his ruffled feelings , my dear Geoffrey , and tell him that Amiel is the very soul of virtue ! I have had him in my service for a long time , and can urge nothing against his character as a man . He does not pretend to be an angel . His tricks of speech and behaviour are the result of a too constant repression of his natural hilarity , but he is really an excellent fellow . He dabbled in hypnotic science when he was with me in India ; I have often warned him of the danger there is in practising this force on the uninitiated . But - a scullery - maid ! - heavens ! - there are so many scullery - maids ! One more or less with the ' jumps ' will not matter . This is Lord Elton 's . "
51193	51208	51178	51178	he	1007	" See to what ignominious degradation a cruel fate reduces so great a man ! "
51339	51370	51322	51322	her	1013	" Charlotte , allow me , - my friends , Prince Lucio Rimânez - Mr Geoffrey Tempest ; gentlemen , my sister - in - law , Miss Charlotte Fitzroy . "
51541	51545	51569	51569	herself	1015	" upper ten . "
51588	51593	51596	51597	the Earl	4230	" Miss Diana Chesney , "
51600	51633	51596	51597	the Earl	4230	" You perhaps know her father , prince , - you must have heard of him at any rate - the famous Nicodemus Chesney , one of the great railway - kings . "
51634	51640	51643	51643	Lucio	124	" Of course I know him "
51646	51685	51643	51643	Lucio	124	" Who does not ! I have met him often . A charming man , gifted with most remarkable humour and vitality - I remember him perfectly . We saw a good deal of each other in Washington . "
51686	51691	51693	51694	Miss Chesney	173	" Did you though ? "
51702	51794	51693	51694	Miss Chesney	173	" He 's a queer sort of man to my thinking ; rather a cross between the ticket - collector and custom - house officer combined , you know ! I never see him but what I feel I must start on a journey directly - railways seem to be written all over him . I tell him so . I say ' Pa , if you did n't carry railway - tracks in your face you 'd be better looking . ' And you found him humorous , did you ? "
51817	51823	51826	51827	Miss Chesney	173	" Well I do n't , "
51829	51938	51826	51827	Miss Chesney	173	" But that may be because I 've heard all his stories over and over again , and I 've read most of them in books besides , - so they 're not much account to me . He tells some of them to the Prince of Wales whenever he can get a chance , - but he do n't try them off on me any more . He 's a real clever man too ; he 's made his pile quicker than most . And you 're quite right about his vitality , - my ! - his laugh takes you into the middle of next week ! "
51955	51965	51966	51966	she	173	" Think I 'm irreverent , do n't you ? "
51970	52019	51966	51966	she	173	" But you know Pa 's not a ' stage parent ' all dressed out in lovely white hair and benedictions , - he 's just an accommodating railway - track , and he would n't like to be reverenced . Do sit down , wo n't you ? "
52031	52061	52062	52062	she	173	" Make them sit down , Lord Elton , - I hate to see men standing . The superior sex , you know ! Besides you 're so tall , "
52077	52096	52062	52062	she	173	" that it 's like peering up an apple - tree at the moon to look at you ! "
52168	52177	52178	52178	she	173	" So you 're the famous Mr Tempest ? "
52185	52318	52178	52178	she	173	" Why , it 's simply splendid for you is n't it ? I always say it 's no use having a heap of money unless you 're young , - if you 're old , you only want it to fill your doctor 's pockets while he tries to mend your poor tuckered - out constitution . I once knew an old lady who was left a legacy of a hundred thousand pounds when she was ninety - five . Poor old dear , she cried over it . She just had sense enough to understand what a good time she could n't have . She lived in bed , and her only luxury was a halfpenny bun dipped in milk for her tea . It was all she cared for . "
52319	52332	52333	52333	I	0	" A hundred thousand pounds would go a long way in buns ! "
52337	52343	52345	52347	the fair Diana	1031	" Would n't it just ! "
52350	52396	52345	52347	the fair Diana	1031	" But I guess you 'll want something a little more substantial for your cash Mr Tempest ! A fortune in the prime of life is worth having . I suppose you 're one of the richest men about just now , are n't you ? "
52419	52428	52430	52430	I	0	" I may be one of the richest , "
52454	52468	52445	52445	I	0	" But my friend here , the prince , is far richer than I. "
52469	52474	52476	52476	she	1031	" Is that so ! "
52494	52523	52480	52480	Lucio	124	" Well now ! I guess Pa 's no better than a sort of pauper after all ! Why , you must have the world at your feet ! "
52524	52529	52532	52532	Lucio	124	" Pretty much so , "
52535	52561	52532	52532	Lucio	124	" But then , my dear Miss Chesney , the world is so very easily brought to one 's feet . Surely you know that ? "
52576	52583	52585	52585	she	1031	" I guess you mean compliments , "
52589	52607	52585	52585	she	1031	" I do n't like them as a rule , but I 'll forgive you this once ! "
52608	52611	52613	52613	Lucio	124	" Do ! "
52642	52653	52655	52655	she	1031	" And you too are young , like Mr Tempest , "
52659	52663	52665	52665	Lucio	124	" Pardon me ! "
52667	52674	52665	52665	Lucio	124	" I am many years older . "
52675	52678	52680	52681	Lord Elton	165	" Really ! "
52686	52697	52680	52681	Lord Elton	165	" You do n't look it , does he Charlotte ? "
52723	52737	52739	52739	she	170	" I should imagine the prince to be slightly the senior of Mr Tempest "
52748	52754	52739	52739	she	170	" But only very slightly . "
52755	52758	52760	52761	Miss Chesney	173	" Anyhow , "
52762	52776	52739	52739	she	170	" you 're young enough , to enjoy your wealth are n't you ? "
52777	52791	52794	52794	Lucio	124	" Young enough , or old enough ; - just as you please ; "
52800	52812	52794	52794	Lucio	124	" But as it happens - I do not enjoy it ! "
52825	52833	52836	52836	Lucio	124	" What does money do for you ? "
52854	53195	52836	52836	Lucio	124	" The world is at your feet , perhaps ; yes - but what a world ! What a trumpery clod of kickable matter ! Wealth acts merely as a kind of mirror to show you human nature at its worst . Men skulk and fawn about you , and lie twenty times in as many hours in the hope to propitiate you and serve their own interests ; princes of the blood willingly degrade themselves and their position to borrow cash of you , - your intrinsic merit if you have any is thought nothing of , - your full pockets are your credentials with kings , prime ministers and councillors ! You may talk like a fool , laugh like a hyena and look like a baboon , but if the chink - chink of your gold be only sufficiently loud , you may soon find yourself dining with the Queen if such be your ambition . If , on the contrary you happen to be truly great , brave , patient , and enduring , with a spark in you of that genius which strengthens life and makes it better worth living , - if you have thoughts which take shape in work that shall endure when kingdoms are swept away like dust before the wind , and if , with all this you are yet poor in current coin , why then , - you shall be spurned by all the crowned dummies of the world , - you shall be snubbed by the affluent starch - maker and the Croesus who lives on a patent pill , - the tradesman from whom you buy bedsteads and kitchen ware , can look down upon you with lordly scorn , for does he not by virtue of his wealth alone , drive a four - in - hand , and chat on easy and almost patronizing terms with the Prince of Wales ? The wealthy denizens of Snob - land delight in ignoring Nature 's elected noblemen . "
53196	53199	53201	53202	Miss Chesney	173	" But supposing "
53205	53241	53201	53202	Miss Chesney	173	" you happen to be a Nature 's nobleman yourself , and have the advantage of wealth besides , surely you must fairly allow that to be rather a good thing , must n't you ? "
53247	53482	53242	53242	Lucio	124	" I will retort upon you in your own words fair lady , and say ' I guess you mean compliments . ' What I venture to imply however , is that even when wealth does fall to the lot of one of these ' Nature 's noblemen , ' it is not because of his innate nobility that he wins social distinction . It is simply because he is rich . That is what vexes me . I for example , have endless friends who are not my friends so much as the friends of my income . They do not trouble to inquire as to my antecedents , - what I am or where I came from is of no importance . Neither are they concerned in how I live or what I do ; whether I am sick or well , happy or unhappy , is equally with them a matter of indifference . If they knew more about me , it would perhaps be better in the long run . But they do not want to know , - their aims are simple and unconcealed , - they wish to make as much out of me , and secure as much advantage to themselves by their acquaintance with me as possible . And I give them their full way , - they get all they want , - and more ! "
53531	53540	53543	53544	Lord Elton	165	" Very few people have any real friends , "
53547	53626	53543	53544	Lord Elton	165	" And in that respect I suppose we 're none of us worse off than Socrates , who used to keep two chairs only in his house ' one for myself , and another for a friend - when I find him ! ' But you are a universal favourite Lucio , - a most popular fellow - and I think you 're rather hard on your set . People must look after themselves you know - eh ? "
53633	53638	53639	53639	he	124	" They must indeed , "
53642	53659	53639	53639	he	124	" Especially as the latest news of science is that God has given up the business . "
53714	53719	53720	53720	she	173	" It 's Sibyl ! "
53739	53747	53720	53720	she	173	" I never can loll before Sibyl ! "
53992	53999	54001	54002	her aunt	1045	" You are late , Sibyl , "
54005	54009	54010	54010	she	1045	" Am I ? "
54016	54030	54010	54010	she	1045	" So sorry ! Papa , are you an extemporized fire - screen ? "
54050	54059	54061	54062	Lady Sibyl	166	" Are you not cold , Miss Chesney ? "
54070	54081	54061	54062	Lady Sibyl	166	" Would you not like to come nearer the fire ? "
54094	54099	54101	54101	she	173	" Thank - you ! "
54131	54143	54145	54146	Lady Sibyl	166	" We heard some shocking news this morning , Mr Tempest , "
54156	54180	54145	54146	Lady Sibyl	166	" No doubt you read it in the papers , - an acquaintance of ours , Viscount Lynton , shot himself last night . "
54204	54225	54189	54189	Lucio	124	" Yes , I read a brief account of the affair - terrible indeed ! I also knew him slightly . "
54226	54241	54244	54245	Lady Sibyl	166	" Did you ? Well , he was engaged to a friend of mine , "
54247	54319	54244	54245	Lady Sibyl	166	" I myself think she has had a lucky escape , because though he was an agreeable man enough in society , he was a great gambler , and very extravagant , and he would have run through her fortune very quickly . But she can not be brought to see it in that light , - she is dreadfully upset . She had set her heart on being a Viscountess . "
54320	54324	54326	54327	Miss Chesney	173	" I guess , "
54338	54403	54335	54335	her	173	" it 's not only Americans who run after titles . Since I 've been over here I 've known several real nice girls marry downright mean dough - heads just for the sake of being called ' my lady ' or ' your grace . ' I like a title very well myself - but I also like a man attached to it . "
54429	54471	54244	54245	Lady Sibyl	166	" Of course my friend will have other chances , - she is young and handsome - but I really think , apart from the social point of view , that she was a little in love with the Viscount - - "
54472	54477	54479	54480	her father	815	" Nonsense ! nonsense ! "
54484	54613	54479	54480	her father	815	" You always have some romantic notion or other in your head Sibyl , - one ' season ' ought to have cured you of sentiment - ha - ha - ha ! She always knew he was a dissolute rascal , and she was going to marry him with her eyes wide open to the fact . When I read in the papers that he had blown his brains out in a hansom , I said ' Bad taste - bad taste ! spoiling a poor cabby 's stock - in - trade to satisfy a selfish whim ! ' ha - ha ! - but I thought it was a good riddance of bad rubbish . He would have made any woman 's life utterly miserable . "
54614	54620	54622	54623	Lady Sibyl	166	" No doubt he would ! "
54627	54643	54622	54623	Lady Sibyl	166	" But , all the same , there is such a thing as love sometimes . "
54721	54729	54711	54715	one of the gorgeous footmen	1049	" Dinner is served , my lud . "
54730	54733	54735	54736	the Earl	4230	" Good ! "
54745	54773	54735	54736	the Earl	4230	" Prince , will you take Miss Fitzroy , - Mr Tempest , my daughter falls to your escort , - I will follow with Miss Chesney . "
54903	54911	54914	54915	Miss Charlotte	170	" Then you know the dear Canon ? "
54918	54922	54924	54924	Lucio	124	" Most intimately ! "
54928	54958	54924	54924	Lucio	124	" and I assure you I am thankful to have the privilege of knowing him . A truly perfect man ! - almost a saint - if not quite ! "
54959	54965	54967	54968	the spinster	1057	" So pure - minded ! "
54970	54979	54981	54981	Lucio	124	" So free from every taint of hypocrisy ! "
54986	54997	54981	54981	Lucio	124	" Ah yes ! Yes indeed ! And so - - "
55411	55415	55416	55416	I	0	" I believe , "
55424	55438	55416	55416	I	0	" you used to live in Warwickshire at Willowsmere Court did you not ? "
55454	55487	55416	55416	I	0	" Yes - er - yes . I - er had the place for some time , - rather a bore to keep up , - wants quite an army of servants . "
55488	55492	55493	55493	I	0	" Just so ; "
55502	55520	55493	55493	I	0	" I presume it will require a considerable domestic retinue . I have arranged to purchase it . "
55553	55563	55564	55564	he	4230	" You ? You are going to buy Willowsmere ? "
55567	55584	55587	55587	I	0	" Yes . I have wired to my lawyers to settle the matter as quickly as possible "
55606	55629	55590	55590	Lucio	124	" I like Warwickshire , - and as I shall entertain a great deal I think the place will suit me perfectly . "
55668	55675	55678	55679	the Earl	4230	" Sibyl was born at Willowsmere , "
55687	55700	55702	55702	I	0	" A new charm is added to its possession by that knowledge , "
55714	55723	55702	55702	I	0	" Have you many recollections of the place ? "
55724	55731	55732	55732	she	166	" Indeed , indeed I have ! "
55746	55817	55732	55732	she	166	" There is no corner of the world I love so well ! I used to play on the lawns under the old oak - trees , and I always gathered the first violets and primroses that came out on the banks of the Avon . And when the hawthorn was in full flower I used to make believe that the park was fairyland and I the fairy queen - - "
55818	55825	55827	55827	Lucio	124	" As you were and are ! "
55845	55948	55839	55839	she	166	" It was all very foolish , but I loved Willowsmere , and love it still . And I often saw in the fields on the other side of the river which did not belong to the estate , a little girl about my own age , playing all by herself and making long daisy - chains and buttercup balls , - a little girl with long fair curls and a sweet baby face . I wanted to know her and speak to her , but my nurse would never let me because she was supposed to be ' beneath ' me . "
55959	56021	55949	55950	Lady Sibyl	166	" Yet she was well - born ; she was the orphan child of a very distinguished scholar and gentleman , and had been adopted by the physician who attended her mother 's deathbed , she having no living relatives left to take care of her . And she - that little fair - haired girl , - was Mavis Clare . "
56056	56067	56046	56046	Lucio	124	" Have you never heard of Mavis Clare , Tempest ? "
56172	56179	56181	56182	Lady Sibyl	166	" Mavis Clare is a genius , "
56186	56301	56181	56182	Lady Sibyl	166	" If Mr Tempest has not heard of her , there is no doubt he will hear . I often regret that I never made her acquaintance in those old days at Willowsmere , - the stupidity of my nurse often rankles in my mind . ' Beneath me ' - indeed ! - and how very much she is above me now ! She still lives down there , - her adopted parents are dead and she rents the lovely little house they inhabited . She has bought some extra land about it and improved the place wonderfully . Indeed I have never seen a more ideal poet 's corner than Lily Cottage . "
56337	56349	56351	56351	I	0	" Rather an odd name , Mavis , is n't it ? "
56358	56383	56351	56351	I	0	" Yes , - but it suits her wonderfully . She sings quite as sweetly as any thrush , so she merits her designation . "
56384	56392	56393	56393	I	0	" What has she done in literature ? "
56396	56404	56406	56406	Lucio	124	" Oh , - only a novel ! "
56411	56439	56406	56406	Lucio	124	" But it has a quality unusual to novels ; it lives ! I hope , Tempest , that your forthcoming work will enjoy the same vitality . "
56472	56480	56481	56481	he	165	" Why , God bless my soul ! "
56484	56500	56481	56481	he	165	" You do n't mean to tell me you have written a novel Mr Tempest ? "
56523	56538	56519	56519	I	0	" What do you want to do that for , with your immense position ? "
56539	56545	56547	56547	Lucio	124	" He hankers after fame ! "
56554	56561	56563	56564	the Earl	4230	" But you 've got fame ! "
56567	56577	56563	56564	the Earl	4230	" Everybody knows who you are by this time . "
56578	56596	56599	56599	Lucio	124	" Ah , my dear lord , that is not enough for the aspirations of my gifted friend "
56625	56807	56605	56605	his	124	" He does not particularly care for the ' immense position ' that is due to wealth alone , because that does not lift him a jot higher than Maple of Tottenham Court Road . He seeks to soar beyond the furniture man , - and who shall blame him ? He would be known for that indescribable quality called Genius , - for high thoughts , poetry , divine instincts , and prophetic probings into the heart of humanity , - in short , for the power of the Pen , which topples down great kingdoms like card - houses and sticks foolscaps on the heads of kings . Generally it is the moneyless man or woman who is endowed with this unpurchaseable power , - this independence of action and indifference to opinion , - the wealthy seldom do anything but spend or hoard . But Tempest means to unite for once in his own person the two most strenuously opposed forces in nature , - genius and cash , - or in other words , God and Mammon . "
56830	56835	56837	56837	she	166	" I am afraid , "
56842	56901	56837	56837	she	166	" that the claims of society will take up too much of your time , Mr Tempest , to allow you to continue the writing of books . I remember you told me the other evening that you were about to publish a novel . I suppose you were - originally I mean - an author by profession ? "
57037	57045	57047	57047	I	0	" I am an author , Lady Sibyl "
57052	57111	57047	57047	I	0	" and I hope I may soon prove my right to be acknowledged as one . ' Author ' is in my opinion , a prouder title than king , and I do not think any social claims will deter me from following the profession of literature , which I look upon as the highest in the world . "
57120	57124	57126	57126	he	165	" But your people "
57129	57137	57126	57126	he	165	" Your family - are they literary ? "
57138	57148	57150	57150	I	0	" No members of my family are now living , "
57155	57164	57150	57150	I	0	" My father was John Tempest of Rexmoor . "
57165	57168	57170	57171	the Earl	4230	" Indeed ! "
57177	57221	57170	57171	the Earl	4230	" Dear me , dear me ! I used to meet him often in the hunting field years ago . You come of a fine old stock , sir ! - the Tempests of Rexmoor are well and honourably known in county chronicles . "
57242	57248	57254	57254	his	124	" One begins to wonder , "
57259	57373	57251	57251	Lucio	124	" when one is the descendant of a good English county family , - a distinct cause for pride ! - and moreover has the still more substantial fact of a large fortune to support that high lineage , why one should trouble to fight for merely literary honours ! You are far too modest in your ambitions , Tempest ! - high - seated as you are upon bank - notes and bullion , with all the glory of effulgent county chronicles behind you , you still stoop to clutch the laurel ! Fie , my dear fellow ! You degrade yourself by this desire to join the company of the immortals ! "
57422	57429	57430	57430	he	4230	" That 's all very fine , "
57433	57453	57430	57430	he	4230	" But you see it is n't as if Mr Tempest were driven by necessity to write for his living "
57455	57473	57475	57475	I	0	" One may love work for the work 's sake without any actual necessity for doing it , "
57478	57503	57475	57475	I	0	" For example , - this Mavis Clare you speak of , - is she , - a woman , - driven by necessity ? "
57504	57520	57523	57524	Lord Elton	165	" Mavis Clare has n't a penny in the world that she does not earn , "
57527	57540	57523	57524	Lord Elton	165	" I suppose that if she did not write she would starve . "
57545	57558	57560	57560	she	173	" I guess she 's a long way off starvation just now , "
57568	57635	57560	57560	she	173	" Why , she 's as proud as the proudest , - drives in the Park in her victoria and pair with the best in the land , and knows all the ' swagger ' people . She 's nowhere near Grub Street I should say . I hear she 's a splendid business woman , and more than a match for the publishers all round . "
57636	57644	57647	57648	the Earl	4230	" Well I should rather doubt that , "
57653	57664	57647	57648	the Earl	4230	" It needs the devil himself to match the publishers . "
57665	57670	57673	57673	Lucio	124	" You are right ! "
57675	57726	57673	57673	Lucio	124	" In fact I daresay that in the various ' phases ' or transmigrations of the spirit into differing forms of earthy matter , the devil should he exist at all has frequently become a publisher , - and a particularly benevolent publisher too ! - by way of diversion . "
57731	57748	57751	57752	Lady Sibyl	166	" Well , I should imagine Mavis Clare to be a match for anybody or anything , "
57754	57814	57751	57752	Lady Sibyl	166	" Of course she is not rich , - but she spends her money wisely and to effective advantage . I do not know her personally , - I wish I did ; but I have read her books , which are quite out of the common . She is a most independent creature too ; quite indifferent to opinions "
57816	57825	57827	57827	I	0	" I suppose she must be extremely plain then "

57854	57878	57889	57890	Diana Chesney	173	" True , - but that would not apply to Miss Clare . She is pretty , and knows how to dress besides . "
57879	57887	57889	57890	Diana Chesney	173	" Such a virtue in literary women ! "
57892	57900	57889	57890	Diana Chesney	173	" Some of them are such dowdies ! "
57901	57907	57910	57911	Lady Sibyl	166	" Most people of culture , "
57913	57971	57910	57911	Lady Sibyl	166	" in our set at any rate , are accustomed to look upon Miss Clare as quite an exception to the usual run of authors . She is charming in herself as well as in her books , and she goes everywhere . She writes with inspiration , - and always has something so new to say - "
57972	57984	57986	57986	Lucio	124	" That of course all the critics are down upon her ? "
57988	57999	57889	57890	Diana Chesney	173	" Oh , naturally ! But we never read reviews . "
58000	58008	58011	58012	Lord Elton	165	" Nor anyone else I should hope , "
58017	58224	58011	58012	Lord Elton	165	" except the fellows who write them , ha - ha - ha ! I call it damned impertinence - excuse the word - on the part of a newspaper hack to presume to teach me what I ought to read , or what I ought to appreciate . I 'm quite capable of forming my own judgment on any book that ever was written . But I avoid all the confounded ' new ' poets , - avoid 'em like poison , sir - ha - ha ! Anything but a ' new ' poet ; the old ones are good enough for me ! Why sir , these reviewers who give themselves such airs with a pennorth of ink and a pen , are mostly half - grown half - educated boys who for a couple of guineas a week undertake to tell the public what they think of such and such a book , as if anyone cared a jot about their green opinions ! Ridiculous - quite ridiculous ! - what do they take the public for I wonder ! Editors of responsible journals ought to know better than to employ such young coxcombs just because they can get them cheap - - "
58261	58294	58251	58251	he	1095	" Charlotte , Lady Elton sends word that she will come into the drawing - room to - night . Perhaps you had better go and see that she is made comfortable . "
58308	58384	58386	58386	he	1095	" My wife is seldom well enough to see visitors , but this evening she feels inclined for a little change and distraction from the monotony of her sick - room . It will be very kind of you two gentlemen to entertain her , - she can not speak much , but her hearing and sight are excellent , and she takes great interest in all that is going on . Dear dear me ! "
58393	58405	58386	58386	he	1095	" She used to be one of the brightest of women ! "
58406	58411	58413	58414	Miss Chesney	173	" The sweet Countess ! "
58419	58426	58413	58414	Miss Chesney	173	" She is quite lovely still ! "

59057	59074	59078	59079	a woman	3838	" How hardly shall he that is a rich man , enter the Kingdom of Heaven ! "
59867	59872	59875	59876	Lord Elton	165	" Well , my dear "
59879	59904	59875	59876	Lord Elton	165	" This is an unexpected pleasure ! It is nearly three months since you honoured us with your company . How do you feel ? "
59905	59908	59909	59909	she	1151	" Better , "
59927	59934	59937	59938	Lady Sibyl	166	" Mother found the room rather cold "
59940	59956	59959	59959	she	1151	" So we brought her as near to the fire as possible . It is cold "
59962	59971	59959	59959	she	1151	" I fancy it must be freezing hard . "
59972	59977	59979	59980	the Earl	4230	" Where is Diana ? "
59992	60006	60008	60009	his daughter	4218	" Miss Chesney has gone to her own room to write a letter ; "
60013	60020	60008	60009	his daughter	4218	" She will be back directly . "
60050	60055	60056	60056	she	166	" Who is that ? "
60059	60068	60071	60072	Lady Sibyl	166	" Why , mother dear , I told you "
60075	60087	60071	60072	Lady Sibyl	166	" That is Prince Lucio Rimânez , Papa 's great friend . "
60105	60110	60111	60113	the slow voice	1157	" What is he ? "
60129	60138	60141	60142	her husband	1158	" Now Helena , you must not excite yourself "
60154	60177	60141	60142	her husband	1158	" Surely you remember all I have told you about the prince ? And also about this gentleman , Mr Geoffrey Tempest ? "
60195	60207	60210	60210	her	166	" You are a very young man to be a millionaire , "
60219	60224	60210	60210	her	166	" Are you married ? "
60278	60292	60271	60271	she	166	" Ask your friend ... to come here ... and speak to me . "
60329	60337	60339	60339	she	166	" Your face seems familiar to me , "
60353	60361	60339	60339	she	166	" Have I ever met you before ? "
60362	60371	60373	60373	he	124	" Dear lady , you may have done so "
60387	60434	60373	60373	he	124	" It occurs to me , now I think of it , that years ago , I saw once , as a passing vision of loveliness , in the hey - day of youth and happiness , Helena Fitzroy , before she was Countess of Elton . "
60435	60452	60453	60453	she	166	" You must have been a mere boy - a child , - at that time ! "
60458	60568	60373	60373	he	124	" Not so ! - for you are still young , Madame , and I am old . You look incredulous ? Alas , why is it I wonder , I may not look the age I am ! Most of my acquaintances spend a great part of their lives in trying to look the age they are not ; and I never came across a man of fifty who was not proud to be considered thirty - nine . My desires are more laudable , - yet honourable eld refuses to impress itself upon my features . It is quite a sore point with me I assure you . "
60569	60578	60580	60581	Lady Sibyl	166	" Well , how old are you really ? "
60586	60595	60596	60596	he	1161	" Ah , I dare not tell you ! "
60603	60652	60596	60596	he	1161	" But I ought to explain that in my countings I judge age by the workings of thought and feeling , more than by the passing of years . Thus it should not surprise you to hear that I feel myself old , - old as the world ! "
60653	60666	60667	60667	I	0	" But there are scientists who say that the world is young ; "
60670	60688	60667	60667	I	0	" And that it is only now beginning to feel its forces and put forth its vigour . "
60689	60698	60699	60699	he	1161	" Such optimistic wise - acres are wrong , "
60703	60729	60699	60699	he	1161	" The world is a veritable husk of a planet ; humanity has nearly completed all its allotted phases , and the end is near . "
60730	60734	60736	60737	Lady Sibyl	166	" The end ? "
60740	60753	60736	60737	Lady Sibyl	166	" Do you believe the world will ever come to an end ? "
60754	60813	60699	60699	he	1161	" I do , most certainly . Or , to be more correct , it will not actually perish , but will simply change . And the change will not agree with the constitution of its present inhabitants . They will call the transformation the Day of Judgment . I should imagine it would be a fine sight . "
60827	60835	60838	60839	Lord Elton	165	" I would rather not witness it , "
60842	60847	60849	60849	Rimânez	124	" Oh , why ? "
60858	60885	60888	60888	he	1161	" A final glimpse of the planet ere we a scend or de scend to our future homes elsewhere , would be something to remember ! Madame "
60893	60900	60888	60888	he	1161	" are you fond of music ? "
60925	60930	60931	60931	she	173	" Do you play ? "
60947	61023	60944	60944	He	1161	" I do . In an erratic sort of fashion . I also sing . Music has always been one of my passions . When I was very young , - ages ago , - I used to imagine I could hear the angel Israfel chanting his strophes amid the golden glow of heavenly glory , - himself white - winged and wonderful , with a voice out - ringing beyond the verge of paradise ! "
61074	61077	61078	61078	he	1161	" Sometimes , "
61083	61127	61078	61078	he	1161	" just at odd moments - I like to believe in Paradise . It is a relief , even to a hardened sinner like myself , to fancy that there may exist something in the way of a world better than this one . "
61128	61132	61134	61136	Miss Charlotte Fitzroy	170	" Surely sir , "
61139	61145	61134	61136	Miss Charlotte Fitzroy	170	" you believe in Heaven ? "
61154	61288	61146	61146	He	1161	" Madame , forgive me ! I do not believe in the clerical heaven . I know you will be angry with me for this frank confession ! But I can not picture the angels in white smocks with goose wings , or the Deity as a somewhat excitable personage with a beard . Personally I should decline to go to any heaven which was only a city with golden streets ; and I should object to a sea of glass , resenting it as a want of invention on the part of the creative Intelligence . But - - do not frown , dear Miss Fitzroy ! - I do believe in Heaven all the same , - a different kind of heaven , - I often see it in my dreams ! "
61339	61350	61335	61335	he	1167	" Shall I give you some music now , Madame ? "
61837	61848	61849	61849	she	173	" Well , that beats everything I 've ever heard ! "
61957	61963	61965	61965	I	0	" You are a great master "
61968	61982	61965	61965	I	0	" A wonderful performer ! But do you know what your music suggests ? "
61998	62001	62002	62002	I	0	" Crime ! "
62005	62032	62002	62002	I	0	" You have roused in me evil thoughts of which I am ashamed . I did not think that was possible to so divine an Art . "
62051	62064	62066	62066	he	124	" Art takes its colours from the mind , my dear friend ; "
62069	62092	62066	62066	he	124	" If you discover evil suggestions in my music , the evil , I fear , must be in your own nature . "
62093	62098	62099	62099	I	0	" Or in yours ! "
62103	62108	62110	62110	he	124	" Or in mine ; "
62114	62125	62110	62110	he	124	" I have often told you I am no saint . "
62168	62174	62175	62175	I	0	" Pardon me , Lucio ! "
62179	62210	62175	62175	I	0	" I spoke in haste ; but truly your music almost put me in a state of frenzy , - I never heard anything in the least like it - - "
62211	62215	62218	62219	Lady Sibyl	166	" Nor I , "
62229	62243	62218	62219	Lady Sibyl	166	" It was marvellous ! Do you know , it quite frightened me ? "
62244	62249	62250	62250	he	124	" I am sorry ! "
62257	62284	62250	62250	he	124	" I know I am quite a failure as a pianist - I am not sufficiently ' restrained , ' as the press men would say . "
62285	62292	62294	62295	Lord Elton	165	" A failure ? Good God ! "
62300	62317	62294	62295	Lord Elton	165	" Why , if you played like that in public , you 'd drive everyone frantic ! "
62318	62322	62324	62324	Lucio	124	" With alarm ? "
62328	62333	62324	62324	Lucio	124	" Or with disgust ? "
62334	62393	62294	62295	Lord Elton	165	" Nonsense ! you know what I mean very well . I have always had a contempt for the piano as an instrument , but by Jove ! I never heard such music as yours even in a full orchestra . It is extraordinary ! - it is positively magnificent ! Where in the world did you study ? "
62394	62400	62403	62403	Rimânez	124	" In Nature 's conservatoire ; "
62406	62637	62403	62403	Rimânez	124	" My first ' maestro ' was an amiable nightingale . He , singing on a branch of fir when the moon was full , explained with liquid - noted patience , how to construct and produce a pure roulade , cadenza and trill , - and when I had learned thus far , he showed me all the most elaborate methods of applying rhythmic tune to the upward and downward rush of the wind , thus supplying me with perfect counterpoint . Chords I learned from old Neptune , who was good enough to toss a few of his largest billows to the shore for my special benefit . He nearly deafened me with his instructions , being somewhat excitable and loud - voiced , - but on finding me an apt pupil , he drew back his waves to himself with so much delicacy among the pebbles and sand , that at once I mastered the secret of playing arpeggi . Once too I had a finishing lesson from a Dream , - a mystic thing with wild hair and wings - it sang one word in my ears , and the word was unpronounceable in mortal speech , - but after many efforts I discovered it lurking in the scale of sound . The best part of it all was , that my instructors asked no fees ! "
62638	62651	62654	62655	Lady Sibyl	166	" I think you are a poet as well as a musician , "
62657	62793	62294	62295	Lord Elton	165	" A poet ! Spare me ! - my dear young lady , why are you so cruel as to load me with so vile an imputation ! Better be a murderer than a poet , - one is treated with much more respect and courteous consideration , - by the press at anyrate . The murderer 's breakfast - menu will be given due place in many of the most estimable journals , - but the poet 's lack of both breakfast and dinner will be deemed his fitting reward . Call me a live - stock producer , a horse - breeder , a timber - merchant , - anything but a poet ! Why even Tennyson became an amateur milkman to somewhat conceal and excuse the shame and degradation of writing verse ! "
62798	62805	62807	62808	Lord Elton	165	" Well , you must admit , "
62810	62855	62807	62808	Lord Elton	165	" that we 've had rather too much of poets lately . It 's no wonder we 're sick of them , and that poetry has fallen into disrepute . Poets are such a quarrelsome lot too - effeminate , puling , unmanly humbugs ! "
62856	62870	62872	62872	Lucio	124	" You are speaking of the newly ' discovered ' ones of course , "
62874	63048	62872	62872	Lucio	124	" Yes , they are a weedy collection . I have sometimes thought that out of pure philanthropy I would start a bon - bon manufactory , and employ them to write mottoes for the crackers . It would keep them out of mischief and provide them with a little pocket - money , for as matters stand they do not make a farthing by their books . But I do not call them ' poets ' at all , - they are mere rhymers . One or two real poets do exist , but , like the prophets of Scripture , they are not ' in society , ' nor can they get their logs rolled by any of their contemporaries . They are not favourites with any ' set ' ; that is why I am afraid my dear friend Tempest will never be accepted as the genius he is ; society will be too fond of him to let him go down into dust and ashes to gather the laurel . "
63049	63064	63065	63065	I	0	" It is not necessary to go down into dust and ashes for that , "
63068	63076	63077	63077	he	1178	" I assure you it is ! - "
63081	63102	63077	63077	he	1178	" Positively imperative . The laurel flourishes best so , - it will not grow in a hot - house . "
63110	63122	63123	63123	she	173	" Lady Elton would like to hear you sing , prince - "
63126	63171	63123	63123	she	173	" Will you give us that pleasure ? Do ! Something quite simple , you know , - it will set our nerves straight after your terribly beautiful music ! You 'd hardly believe it perhaps , - but I really feel quite unstrung ! "
63183	63187	63188	63188	he	1178	" Forgive me ! "
63191	63211	63188	63188	he	1178	" I 'm always , as the church service says , doing those things I ought not to do . "
63220	63227	63228	63228	she	173	" Oh , I forgive you ! "
63231	63238	63228	63228	she	173	" On condition that you sing . "
63239	63243	63247	63247	he	1178	" I obey ! "
63451	63457	63458	63458	she	173	" You call that simple ! "
63464	63478	63481	63481	Lucio	124	" Quite so . Love and Death are the simplest things in the world "
63484	63544	63481	63481	Lucio	124	" The ballad is a mere trifle , - it is entitled ' The Last Love - Song ' and is supposed to be the utterance of a lover about to kill his mistress and himself . Such events happen every day , - you know that by the newspapers , - they are perfectly common - place - - "
63559	63567	63545	63545	He	124	" Where did you learn that song ? "
63660	63670	63672	63672	she	1151	" Go away , - I 'm not ill , "
63676	63697	63672	63672	she	1151	" I feel better , - much better than I have done for months . The music does me good . "
63706	63765	63703	63703	she	1151	" Ask your friend to come and sit here by me , - I want to talk to him . He has a magnificent voice , - and - I know that song he sang , - I remember reading it - in a manuscript album - long ago . I want to know where he found it - "
63788	63797	63799	63799	he	165	" You are working miracles on my wife , "
63802	63813	63799	63799	he	165	" I have not seen her so animated for years . "
63846	63870	63871	63871	I	0	" I have just been expressing the hope that you and your daughter will pay me a visit at Willowsmere , Lord Elton , "
63886	63892	63894	63894	he	165	" We shall be delighted , "
63897	63904	63894	63894	he	165	" when do you take possession ? "
63905	63914	63916	63916	I	0	" As soon as it is at all feasible "
63919	63944	63916	63916	I	0	" I shall wait in town till the next Levée is over , as both my friend and myself have arranged to be presented . "
63945	64006	64007	64007	I	0	" Oh - ah - yes ! - er - yes ! That is always advisable . And it 's not half such a troublesome business as a Drawing - room is for the ladies . It 's soon over , - and low bodices are not de rigeur - ha - ha - ha ! Who is your presenter ? "
64024	64037	64039	64039	he	165	" A very good man , - you could not have a better "
64043	64057	64039	64039	he	165	" And this book of yours , - when does it come out ? "
64058	64062	64039	64039	he	165	" Next week . "
64063	64076	64079	64080	Lord Elton	165	" We must get it , - we must certainly get it , "
64086	64099	64079	64080	Lord Elton	165	" Sybil , you must put it down on your library list . "
64112	64126	64127	64127	I	0	" On the contrary you must allow me to present it to you ; "
64130	64146	64127	64127	I	0	" It will be a pleasure to me which I hope you will not deny . "
64147	64153	64155	64155	she	1194	" You are very kind , "
64168	64201	64155	64155	she	1194	" But the librarian at Mudie 's is sure to send it - he knows I read everything . Though I confess I never buy any books except those by Mavis Clare . "
64221	64230	64231	64231	I	0	" I shall be jealous of Mavis Clare , "
64235	64240	64241	64241	she	1194	" Most men are ! "
64245	64255	64256	64256	I	0	" You are indeed an enthusiastic partisan of hers ! "
64262	64312	64256	64256	I	0	" Yes , I suppose I am . I like to see any member of my sex distinguish herself as nobly as she does . I have no genius of my own , and that is one of the reasons why I honour it so much in other women . "
64385	64390	64391	64391	he	124	" I am afraid , "
64395	64413	64391	64391	he	124	" that the Countess is not so well , - perhaps you had better go to her - "
64493	64518	64481	64481	her	166	" Mercy ! - mercy ! - oh God - God ! Tell Sibyl ! - pray - pray to God , - pray - "
64570	64575	64576	64576	he	165	" Fetch the doctor ! "
64583	64601	64576	64576	he	165	" Lady Elton has had another shock ! She must be taken to her room at once ! "
64602	64610	64611	64611	I	0	" Can I be of any service ? "
64634	64644	64646	64647	the Earl	4230	" No no , - thanks all the same ! "

64942	64948	64949	64949	I	0	" I am deeply sorry ! "

64973	65011	64964	64964	She	166	" Thank - you . But the doctors have always said that my mother would have another shock depriving her of speech . It is very sad ; she will probably live for some years like that . "
65018	65031	65032	65032	I	0	" May I come and inquire about you all to - morrow ? "
65035	65044	65046	65046	she	166	" It will be very kind of you , "

65218	65238	65205	65205	he	4230	" Paralysis is perhaps the worst of all the physical punishments that can befall a ' rapid ' lady . "
65239	65246	65205	65205	he	4230	" Was she ' rapid ' ? "
65247	65268	65270	65270	he	4230	" Well , - perhaps ' rapid ' is too mild a term , but I can find no other ; "
65273	65337	65270	65270	he	4230	" When she was young , - she is barely fifty now , - she did everything that could be done by woman at her worst and wildest . She had scores of lovers , - and I believe one of them cleared off her husband 's turf - debts , - the Earl consenting gladly , - on a rather pressing occasion . "
65338	65343	65344	65344	I	0	" What disgraceful conduct ! "
65358	65418	65347	65347	He	4230	" Think so ? The ' upper ten ' quite condone that sort of thing in their own set now - a - days . It is all right . If a lady has lovers , and her husband beams benevolence on the situation what can be said ? Nothing . How very tender your conscience is , Geoffrey ! "
65443	65451	65453	65453	he	4230	" I made a mistake this evening , "
65457	65576	65453	65453	he	4230	" I should not have sung that ' Last Love - song . ' The fact is , the words were written by one of her ladyship 's former admirers , a man who was something of a poet in his way , - and she had an idea that she was the only person living who had ever seen the lines . She wanted to know if I knew the man who composed them , and I was able to say that I did - very intimately . I was just explaining how it was , and why I knew him so well , when the distressing attack of convulsions came on , and finished our conversation . "
65577	65582	65583	65583	I	0	" She looked horrible ! "
65586	65658	65453	65453	he	4230	" The paralysed Helen of a modern Troy ? Yes , - her countenance at the last was certainly not attractive . Beauty combined with wantonness frequently ends in the drawn twitch , fixed eye and helpless limbs of life - in - death . It is Nature 's revenge on the outraged body , - and do you know , Eternity 's revenge on the impure Soul is extremely similar ? "
65659	65667	65668	65668	I	0	" What do you know about it ? "
65692	65710	65677	65677	I	0	" Your absurd fancies about the soul are the only traces of folly I discover in you . "
65711	65752	65779	65779	he	1218	" Really ? Well I am glad I have something of the fool in my disposition , - foolishness being the only quality that makes wisdom possible . I confess I have odd , very odd notions about the soul . "
65753	65759	65760	65760	I	0	" I will excuse them - "
65784	65813	65779	65779	he	1218	" In fact I will excuse anything for the sake of your voice . I do not flatter you , Lucio , - you sing like an angel . "
65814	65821	65823	65823	he	1218	" Do n't use impossible comparisons ; "
65826	65835	65823	65823	he	1218	" Have you ever heard an angel sing ? "
65836	65839	65840	65840	I	0	" Yes ! "
65844	65853	65840	65840	I	0	" I have , - this very night ! "
65859	65865	65866	65866	he	1218	" A very open compliment ! "
65896	66077	65880	65880	he	1218	" This vehicle is suffocating me , - let us have some air . See how the stars are shining ! - like great crown jewels - Deity 's regalia ! Hard frost , like hard times , brings noble works into prominence . Yonder , far off , is a star you can hardly perceive ; red as a cinder at times and again blue as the lightning , - I can always discover it , though many can not . It is Algol , - judged by superstitious folk to be an evil star . I love it chiefly on account of its bad reputation , - it is no doubt much maligned . It may be a cold quarter of hell where weeping spirits sit frozen in ice made of their own congealed tears , - or it may be a preparatory school for Heaven - who knows ! Yonder too , shines Venus , - your star Geoffrey ! - for you are in love my friend ! - come confess it ! are you not ? "
66078	66084	66086	66086	I	0	" I am not sure ; "
66090	66103	66086	66086	I	0	" The phrase ' in love ' scarcely describes my present feeling .... "
66104	66110	66112	66112	he	1220	" You have dropped these , "
66176	66193	66195	66195	he	1220	" My dear fellow , do not try to hide your intentions from your best friend , "
66201	66233	66195	66195	he	1220	" You wish to marry the Earl of Elton 's beautiful daughter , and you shall . Trust me ! - I will do everything I can to promote your desire . "
66234	66238	66239	66239	I	0	" You will ? "
66258	66265	66266	66266	he	1220	" I will , I promise - "
66270	66306	66266	66266	he	1220	" I assure you that such a marriage would be one after my own heart . I 'll do all I can for you , - and I have made many matches in my time ! "
66347	66356	66357	66357	he	1220	" Grateful to - whom did you say ? "
66364	66369	66323	66323	his	1220	" To the Fates ! "
66370	66393	66416	66416	he	1220	" Are you really ? They are very ugly sisters I believe . Perhaps they were your ghostly visitors of last night ! "
66394	66398	66399	66399	I	0	" God forbid ! "
66402	66415	66416	66416	he	1220	" Ah ! God never forbids the fulfilment of His own laws ! "
66419	66430	66416	66416	he	1220	" To do so He would have to destroy Himself . "
66431	66438	66439	66439	I	0	" If He exists at all ! "
66443	66449	66416	66416	he	1220	" True ! If - ! "
67330	67335	67336	67336	he	165	" The fact is , "
67431	67431	67429	67429	everybody	369	"
67796	67799	67800	67800	he	124	" Geoffrey , "
67803	67814	67800	67800	he	124	" I 'm going to lend you five hundred pounds ! "
67822	67826	67815	67815	I	0	" What for ? "
67877	67885	67827	67827	He	124	" Well ? What does it mean ? "
67886	67889	67892	67892	he	124	" It means "
67894	68066	68068	68068	he	1274	" that I am going to see Mr McWhing this morning . I have an appointment with him at twelve . You , as Geoffrey Tempest , the author of the book Mr McWhing is going to criticise and make a ' boom ' of , could not possibly put your name to such a cheque . It would not be ' good form ' - it might crop up afterwards and so betray ' the secrets of the prison - house . ' But for me it is another affair . I am going to ' pose ' as your businessman - your ' literary agent ' who pockets ten per cent . of the profits and wants to make a ' big thing ' out of you , and I 'm going to talk the matter over with the perfectly practical McWhing who has , like every true Scot , a keen eye for the main chance . Of course it will be in confidence , - strict confidence ! "
68071	68114	68068	68068	he	1274	" It 's all a question of business you know , - in these commercial days , literature has become a trade like everything else , and even critics only work for what pays them . As indeed why should they not ? "
68115	68129	68130	68130	I	0	" Do you mean to tell me McWhing will take that five hundred ? "
68134	68172	68068	68068	he	1274	" I mean to tell you nothing of the kind . I would not put the matter so coarsely for the world ! This money is not for McWhing , - it is for a literary charity . "
68173	68188	68068	68068	he	1274	" Indeed ! I thought you had an idea perhaps of offering a bribe .... "
68189	68220	68222	68222	he	1275	" Bribe ! Good Heavens ! Bribe a critic ! Impossible , my good Geoffrey ! - such a thing was never heard of - never , never , never ! "
68235	68452	68224	68224	his	1275	" No no ! Press people never take money for anything - not even for ' booming ' a new gold - mining company , - not even for putting a notice of a fashionable concert into the Morning Post . Everything in the English press is the just expression of pure and lofty sentiment , believe me ! This little cheque is for a charity of which Mr McWhing is chief patron , - you see the Civil List pensions all go by favour to the wrong persons nowadays ; to the keeping of lunatic versifiers and retired actresses who never could act - the actual bona - fide ' genius ' never gets anything out of Government , and moreover would scorn to take a farthing from that penurious body , which grudges him anything higher than a money - recognition . It is as great an insult to offer a beggarly pension of fifty or a hundred pounds a year to a really great writer as to give him a knighthood , - and we can not fall much lower than to be a knight , as knights go . The present five hundred pounds will help to relieve certain ' poor and proud ' but pressing literary cases known to McWhing alone ! "
68470	68502	68505	68505	he	1275	" I have no doubt I shall be able to represent the benevolent and respectable literary agent to perfection - of course I shall insist on my ten per cent . ! "
68510	68598	68505	68505	he	1275	" But I ca n't stop to discuss the matter now with you - I 'm off . I promised McWhing to be with him at twelve o'clock precisely , and it 's now half - past - eleven . I shall probably lunch with him , so do n't wait for me . And concerning the five hundred , you need n't be in my debt an hour longer than you like - I 'll take a cheque for the money back from you this evening . "
68599	68602	68604	68604	I	0	" All right "
68607	68623	68604	68604	I	0	" But perhaps the great oracle of the cliques will reject your proposals with scorn . "
68624	68634	68637	68637	Lucio	124	" If he does , then is Utopia realized ! "
68648	68669	68671	68671	he	124	" Where 's a copy of your book ? Ah - here 's one - smelling newly of the press , "
68680	68749	68671	68671	he	124	" Allow me , before departure , to express the opinion that you are a singularly ungrateful fellow , Geoffrey ! Here am I , perfectly devoted to your interests , - and despite my princedom actually prepared to ' pose ' to McWhing as your ' acting manager ' pro tem , and you have n't so much as a thank - you to throw at me ! "
68769	68783	68785	68785	I	0	" McWhing will never take you for an acting manager or literary agent , "
68788	68811	68785	68785	I	0	" You do n't look it . If I seem churlish I 'm sorry - but the fact is I am disgusted ... "
68812	68816	68817	68817	he	124	" At what ? "
68823	68832	68834	68834	I	0	" Oh , at the humbug of everything , "
68838	68871	68834	68834	I	0	" The stupid farce of it all . Why should n't a book get noticed on its own merits without any appeal to cliquism and influential wire - pulling on the press ? "
68872	68875	68877	68877	he	124	" Exactly ! "
68890	68921	68877	68877	he	124	" And why should n't a man get received in society on his own merits , without any money to recommend him or any influential friend to back him up ? "
68926	68935	68937	68937	he	124	" The world is as it is made , "
68945	69095	68937	68937	he	124	" It is moved by the lowest and pettiest motives , - it works for the most trivial , ridiculous and perishable aims . It is not a paradise . It is not a happy family of united and affectionate brethren . It is an over - populated colony of jabbering and quarrelsome monkeys , who fancy they are men . Philosophers in old days tried to teach it that the monkey - type should be exterminated for the growth and encouragement of a nobler race , - but they preached in vain - there never were enough real men alive to overcome the swarming majority of the beasts . God Himself , they say , came down from Heaven to try and set wrong things right , and to restore if possible His own defaced image to the general aspect of humanity , - and even He failed . "
69096	69106	69108	69108	I	0	" There is very little of God in this world "
69112	69119	69108	69108	I	0	" There is much more Devil ! "
69152	69156	69157	69157	he	1276	" No doubt ! "
69165	69253	69157	69157	he	1276	" Mankind certainly prefer the devil to any other deity , - therefore if they elect him as their representative , it is scarcely to be wondered at that he governs where he is asked to govern . And yet - do you know Geoffrey - this devil , - if there is one , - can hardly , I think , be quite so bad as his detractors say . I myself do n't believe he is a whit worse than a nineteenth - century financier ! "
69261	69265	69266	69266	I	0	" After that , "
69269	69300	69266	69266	I	0	" you had better go to McWhing . I hope you will tell him that I am the triple essence of all the newest ' discoveries ' rolled into one ! "
69301	69305	69307	69307	Lucio	124	" Never fear ! "
69310	69366	69307	69307	Lucio	124	" I 've learned all my stock - phrases by heart - a ' star of the first magnitude ' etc . , - I 've read the Athenæum till I 've got the lingo of the literary auctioneer well - nigh perfect , and I believe I shall acquit myself admirably . Au revoir ! "
69470	69477	69478	69478	I	0	" Has this a good sale ? "
69499	69502	69503	69503	he	1280	" Sale ? "
69506	69522	69503	69503	he	1280	" Well , I should think so - rather ! Why everybody 's reading it ! "
69523	69526	69528	69528	I	0	" Indeed ! "
69536	69548	69528	69528	I	0	" I see no allusion whatever to it in the papers . "
69557	69568	69570	69570	he	1281	" No - and you 're not likely to , sir "
69573	69766	69570	69570	he	1281	" Miss Clare is too popular to need reviews . Besides , a large number of the critics , - the ' log - rollers ' especially , are mad against her for her success , and the public know it . Only the other day a man came in here from one of the big newspaper offices and told me he was taking a few notes on the books which had the largest sales , - would I tell him which author 's works were most in demand ? I said Miss Clare took the lead , - as she does , - and he got into a regular rage . Said he - ' That 's the answer I 've had all along the line , and however true it is , it 's no use to me because I dare not mention it . My editor would instantly scratch it out - he hates Miss Clare . ' ' A precious editor you 've got ! ' I said , and he looked rather queer . There 's nothing like journalism , sir , for the suppression of truth ! "
70510	70515	70516	70516	he	124	" Congratulate me Geoffrey ! "
70524	70545	70516	70516	he	124	" Congratulate me , and yourself ! I am minus the five hundred pound cheque I showed you this morning ! "
70546	70553	70555	70555	I	0	" McWhing has pocketed it then , "
70559	70576	70555	70555	I	0	" All right ! Much good may it do him , and his ' charity ' ! "
70585	70597	70598	70598	he	124	" Why , what has happened to you since we parted ? "
70612	70757	70598	70598	he	124	" You seem out of temper ! Yet you ought to be a perfectly happy man - for your highest ambition is about to be gratified . You said you wished to make your book and yourself ' the talk of London , ' - well , within the next two or three weeks you will see yourself praised in a very large number of influential newspapers as the newest discovered ' genius ' of the day , only a little way removed from Shakespeare himself three of the big leading magazines are guaranteed to say that and all this through the affability of Mr McWhing , and the trifling sum of five hundred pounds ! And are you not satisfied ? Really , my friend , you are becoming difficult ! - I warned you that too much good fortune spoils a man . "
70772	70776	70778	70778	I	0	" Look at this "
70781	70794	70778	70778	I	0	" Does she pay five hundred pounds to David McWhing 's charity ? "
70805	70820	70853	70853	Rimânez	124	" Certainly not . But then , - she gets slandered - not criticized ! "
70821	70827	70828	70828	I	0	" What does that matter ! "
70831	70847	70828	70828	I	0	" The man from whom I bought this book says that everybody is reading it . "
70848	70851	70853	70853	Rimânez	124	" Exactly ! "
70869	71008	70853	70853	Rimânez	124	" But you know the old axiom , my dear Geoffrey ? - ' you may lead a horse to the water but you can not make him drink . ' Which statement , interpreted for the present occasion , means that though certain log - rollers , headed by our estimable friend McWhing , may drag the horse - i.e. the public , up to their own particularly prepared literary trough , they can not force it to swallow the mixture . The horse frequently turns tail and runs away in search of its own provender , - it has done so in the case of Miss Clare . When the public choose an author for themselves , it is a dreadful thing of course for other authors , - but it really ca n't be helped ! "
71009	71017	71018	71018	I	0	" Why should they choose Mavis Clare ? "
71022	71028	71029	71029	he	1313	" Ah , why indeed ! "
71033	71060	71029	71029	he	1313	" McWhing would tell you they do it out of sheer idiotcy ; - the public would answer that they choose her because she has genius . "
71061	71064	71065	71065	I	0	" Genius ! "
71069	71081	71065	71065	I	0	" The public are perfectly incapable of recognizing such a quality ! "
71082	71087	71088	71088	he	1313	" You think so ? "
71093	71275	71088	71088	he	1313	" you really think so ? In that case it 's very odd is n't it , how everything that is truly great in art and literature becomes so widely known and honoured , not only in this country but in every civilized land where people think or study ? You must remember that all the very famous men and women have been steadily ' written down ' in their day , even to the late English Laureate , Tennyson , who was ' criticized ' for the most part in the purest Billingsgate , - it is only the mediocrities who are ever ' written up . ' It seems as if the stupid public really had a hand in selecting these ' great , ' for the reviewers would never stand them at any price , till driven to acknowledge them by the popular force majeure . But considering the barbarous want of culture and utter foolishness of the public , Geoffrey , what I wonder at , is that you should care to appeal to it at all ! "
71287	71292	71293	71293	he	1314	" I am afraid - "
71318	71457	71293	71293	he	1314	" that Miss Clare is going to be a thorn in your side , my friend ! A man rival in literature is bad enough , - but a woman rival is too much to endure with any amount of patience ! However you may console yourself with the certainty that she will never get ' boomed , ' - while you - thanks to my tender fostering of the sensitive and high - principled McWhing , will be the one delightful and unique ' discovery ' of the press for at least one month , perhaps two , which is about as long as any ' new star of the first magnitude ' lasts in the latter - day literary skies .

Fie Geoffrey ! - get over your sulks ! Jealous of a woman ! Be ashamed , - is not woman the inferior creature ? , and shall the mere spectre of a feminine fame cause a five - fold millionaire to abase his lofty spirit in the dust ?

72611	72616	72617	72617	he	1347	" I thank you ! "
72621	72628	72617	72617	he	1347	" You make me your debtor . "
72651	72661	72662	72662	he	1347	" You paid dearly for that blessing , Rimânez ! "
72665	72691	72662	72662	he	1347	" You gave her three sovereigns ; - by Jove ! I 'd have had something more than a blessing if I had been you . "
72692	72696	72698	72698	Rimânez	124	" No doubt ! "
72700	72734	72698	72698	Rimânez	124	" You deserve more , - much more ! I hope you will get it ! A blessing would be of no advantage whatever to you ; - it is , to me . "

73735	73755	73725	73725	they	3751	" You have written a novel , have n't you ? What an odd thing for you to do ! "
73764	73787	73725	73725	they	3751	" I have n't read it , - I 've so little time - I must ask for it at the library . "
73992	73997	73998	73998	he	124	" You wrote this ! "
74008	74020	73998	73998	he	124	" It must have been a great relief to your mind ! "
74048	74057	74058	74058	he	124	" There are some human beings so constituted , "
74061	74109	74058	74058	he	124	" that if they had been with Noah in the ark according to the silly old legend , they would have shot the dove bearing the olive - leaf , directly it came in sight over the waste of waters . You are of that type Geoffrey . "
74110	74121	74122	74122	I	0	" I do not see the force of your comparison , "
74125	74241	74058	74058	he	124	" Do you not ? Why , what harm has this Mavis Clare done to you ? Your positions are entirely opposed . You are a millionaire ; she is a hard - working woman dependent on her literary success for a livelihood , and you , rolling in wealth do your best to deprive her of the means of existence . Does this redound to your credit ? She has won her fame by her own brain and energy alone , - and even if you dislike her book need you abuse her personally as you have done in this article ? You do not know her ; you have never seen her , ... "
74242	74249	74250	74250	I	0	" I hate women who write ! "
74254	74330	74058	74058	he	124	" Why ? Because they are able to exist independently ? Would you have them all the slaves of man 's lust or convenience ? My dear Geoffrey , you are unreasonable . If you admit that you are jealous of this woman 's celebrity and grudge it to her , then I can understand your spite , for jealousy is capable of murdering a fellow - creature with either the dagger or the pen . "
74335	74350	74351	74351	he	1390	" Is the book such wretched stuff as you make it out to be ? "
74355	74364	74366	74366	I	0	" I suppose some people might admire it , "
74370	74375	74366	74366	I	0	" I do not . "
74432	74435	74437	74437	Rimânez	124	" Well , "
74449	74482	74443	74443	he	1390	" all I can say Geoffrey , is that this will not touch Mavis Clare in the least . You have overshot the mark , my friend ! Her public will simply cry "
74487	74525	74443	74443	he	1390	" and clamour for her work more than ever . And as for the woman herself , - she has a merry heart , and she will laugh at it . You must see her some day . "
74526	74535	74536	74536	I	0	" I do n't want to see her , "
74539	74560	74443	74443	he	1390	" Probably not . But you will scarcely be able to avoid doing so when you live at Willowsmere Court . "
74561	74573	74575	74575	I	0	" One is not obliged to know everybody in the neighbourhood , "
74583	74593	74594	74594	he	124	" How well you carry your fortunes , Geoffrey ! "
74597	74783	74594	74594	he	124	" For a poor devil of a Grub - street hack who lately was at a loss for a sovereign , how perfectly you follow the fashions of your time ! If there is one man more than another that moves me to wondering admiration it is he who asserts his wealth strenuously in the face of his fellows , and who comports himself in this world as though he could bribe death and purchase the good - will of the Creator . It is such splendid effrontery , - such superlative pride ! Now I , though over - wealthy myself , am so curiously constituted that I can not wear my bank - notes in my countenance as it were , - I have put in a claim for intellect as well as gold , - and sometimes , do you know , in my travels round the world , I have been so far honoured as to be taken for quite a poor man ! Now you will never have that chance again ; - you are rich and you look it ! "
74784	74789	74790	74790	I	0	" And you , - "
74800	74832	74790	74790	I	0	" do you know what you look ? You imply that I assert my wealth in my face ; do you know what you assert in your every glance and gesture ? "
74833	74839	74840	74840	he	1391	" I can not imagine ! "
74844	74850	74851	74851	I	0	" Contempt for us all ! "
74854	74931	74851	74851	I	0	" Immeasurable contempt , - even for me , whom you call friend . I tell you the truth , Lucio , - there are times , when in spite of our intimacy I feel that you despise me . I daresay you do ; you have an extraordinary personality united to extraordinary talents ; you must not however expect all men to be as self - restrained and as indifferent to human passions as yourself . "
74941	74944	74945	74945	he	1391	" Expect ! "
74948	75028	74945	74945	he	1391	" My good fellow , I expect nothing at all , - from men . They , on the contrary , - at least all those I know - expect everything from me . And they get it , - generally . As for ' despising ' you , have I not said that I admire you ? I do . I think there is something positively stupendous in the brilliant progress of your fame and rapid social success . "
75029	75033	75034	75034	I	0	" My fame ! "
75038	75050	75034	75034	I	0	" How has it been obtained ? What is it worth ? "
75051	75058	75059	75059	he	1391	" That is not the question ; "
75066	75278	75279	75279	His	1391	" How unpleasant it must be for you to have these gouty twinges of conscience Geoffrey ! Of course no fame is actually worth much now - a - days , - because it is not classic fame , strong in reposeful old - world dignity , - it is blatant noisy notoriety merely . But yours , such as it is , is perfectly legitimate , judged by its common - sense commercial aspect , which is the only aspect in which anyone looks at anything . You must bear in mind that no one works out of disinterestedness in the present age , - no matter how purely benevolent an action may appear on the surface , Self lies at the bottom of it . Once grasp this fact , and you will perceive that nothing could be fairer or more straightforward than the way you have obtained your fame . You have not ' bought ' the incorruptible British Press ; you could not do that ; that is impossible , for it is immaculate , and bristles stiffly all over with honourable principles . There is no English paper existing that would accept a cheque for the insertion of a notice or a paragraph ; not one ! "
75290	75417	75286	75286	he	1391	" No , - it is only the Foreign Press that is corrupt , so the British Press says ; - John Bull looks on virtuously aghast at journalists who , in dire stress of poverty , will actually earn a little extra pay for writing something or somebody ' up ' or ' down . ' Thank Heaven , he employs no such journalists ; his pressmen are the very soul of rectitude , and will stoically subsist on a pound a week rather than take ten for a casual job ' to oblige a friend . ' Do you know Geoffrey , when the Judgment Day arrives , who will be among the first saints to ascend to Heaven with the sounding of trumpets ? "
75429	75439	75441	75441	Lucio	124	" All the English not foreign editors and journalists ! "
75449	75536	75441	75441	Lucio	124	" and why ? Because they are so good , so just , so unprejudiced ! Their foreign brethren will be reserved for the eternal dance of devils of course - but the Britishers will pace the golden streets singing Alleluia ! I assure you I consider British journalists generally the noblest examples of incorruptibility in the world - they come next to the clergy as representatives of virtue , and exponents of the three evangelical counsels , - voluntary poverty , chastity , and obedience ! "
75558	75564	75565	75565	he	124	" Be consoled , Geoffrey , "
75568	75749	75565	75565	he	124	" your fame is honourably won . You have simply , through me , approached one critic who writes in about twenty newspapers and influences others to write in other twenty , - that critic being a noble creature , all critics are noble creatures has a pet ' society ' for the relief of authors in need a noble scheme you will own and to this charity I subscribe out of pure benevolence , five hundred pounds . Moved by my generosity and consideration , particularly as I do not ask what becomes of the five hundred McWhing ' obliges ' me in a little matter . The editors of the papers for which he writes accept him as a wise and witty personage ; they know nothing about the charity or the cheque , - it is not necessary for them to know . The whole thing is really quite a reasonable business arrangement ; - it is only a self - tormenting analyst like you who would stop to think of such a trifle a second time . "
75750	75762	75763	75763	I	0	" If McWhing really and conscientiously admired my book for itself ; "
75766	75775	75777	75777	Lucio	124	" Why should you imagine he does not ? "
75779	75839	75777	75777	Lucio	124	" Myself , I believe that he is a perfectly sincere and honorable man . I think he means all he says and writes . I consider that if he had found your work not worthy of his commendation , he would have sent me back that cheque for five hundred pounds , torn across in a noble scorn ! "
76199	76209	76210	76210	he	124	" My dear boy , it is all flunkeydom ; "
76213	76223	76225	76225	he	124	" All sham and humbug . Look at this - "
76235	76288	76290	76290	he	124	" There is no real use in this flimsy blade , - it is merely an emblem of dead chivalry . In old times , if a man insulted you , or insulted a woman you admired , out flashed a shining point of tempered Toledo steel that could lunge - so ! "
76303	76326	76328	76328	he	124	" and you pricked the blackguard neatly through the ribs or arm and gave him cause to remember you . But now - "
76337	76442	76328	76328	he	124	" men carry toys like these as a melancholy sign to show what bold fellows they were once , and what spiritless cravens they are now , - relying no more on themselves for protection , but content to go about yelling ' Police ! Police ! ' at the least threat of injury to their worthless persons . Come , it 's time we started , Geoffrey ! - let us go and bow our heads before another human unit formed precisely like ourselves , and so act in defiance of Death and the Deity , who declare all men to be equal ! "
76459	76476	76479	76479	Lucio	124	" His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is not exactly the Creator of the universe ; "
76498	76502	76503	76503	I	0	" Why no ! "
76507	76515	76503	76503	I	0	" What do you say that for ? "
76516	76579	76604	76604	He	124	" Because there is as much fuss about him as if he were , - in fact , more . The Creator does not get half as much attention bestowed upon Him as Albert Edward . We never attire ourselves in any special way for entering the presence of God ; we do n't put so much as a clean mind on . "
76580	76584	76586	76586	I	0	" But then , "
76590	76603	76586	76586	I	0	" God is non est , - and Albert Edward is est . "
76620	76626	76627	76627	he	124	" That is your opinion ? "
76630	76704	76627	76627	he	124	" Well , it is not original , - many choice spirits share it with you . There is at least one good excuse for people who make no preparation to enter the presence of God , - in going to church , which is called the ' house of God , ' they do not find God at all ; they only discover the clergyman . It is somewhat of a disappointment . "
77622	77626	77675	77675	Rimânez	124	" Five millions ! "
77680	77688	77673	77673	I	0	" You made a veritable sensation Lucio ! "
77689	77693	77694	77694	He	124	" Did I ? "
77697	77703	77694	77694	He	124	" You flatter me Geoffrey . "
77704	77721	77673	77673	I	0	" Not at all . Why did you stop so long in front of the daïs ? "
77722	77728	77729	77729	he	124	" To please my humour ! "
77733	77754	77729	77729	he	124	" And partly , to give his Royal Highness the chance of remembering me the next time he sees me . "
77755	77763	77765	77765	I	0	" But he seemed to recognise you , "
77768	77775	77765	77765	I	0	" Have you met him before ? "
77780	77852	77776	77776	His	124	" Often ! But I have never till now made a public appearance at St James 's . Court costume and ' company manners ' make a difference to the looks of most men , - and I doubt , - yes , I very much doubt , whether , even with his reputed excellent memory for faces , the Prince really knew me to - day for what I am ! "
77965	77973	77974	77974	I	0	" Why , what 's the matter ? "
77995	78022	77982	77982	I	0	" You , of all people in the world , having a private ' weep ' ! Has our dear railway papa ' bust up ' ? "
78030	78038	78039	78039	she	173	" Not just yet , you bet ! "
78059	78091	78039	78039	she	173	" There 's nothing wrong with the funds as far as I know . I 've only had a , - - well , a sort of rumpus here with Sibyl . "
78092	78096	78023	78023	She	173	" With Sibyl ? "
78097	78100	78103	78103	she	173	" Yes , "
78121	78732	78103	78103	she	173	" You see it 's the Catsup 's ' At Home ' to - night , and I 'm invited and Sibyl 's invited ; Miss Charlotte is knocked up with nursing the Countess , and of course I made sure that Sibyl would go . Well , she never said a word about it till she came down to dinner , and then she asked me what time I wanted the carriage . I said ' Are n't you going too ? ' and she looked at me in that provoking way of hers , - you know ! - a look that takes you in from your topmost hair to your shoe - edge , - and answered ' Did you think it possible ! ' Well , I flared up , and said of course I thought it possible , - why should n't it be possible ? She looked at me in the same way again and said - ' To the Catsups ? with you ! ' Now , you know , Mr Tempest , that was real downright rudeness , and more than I could stand so I just gave way to my mind . ' Look here , ' I said - ' though you are the daughter of an Earl , you need n't turn up your nose at Mrs Catsup . She is n't half bad , - I do n't speak of her money , - but she 's a real good sort , and has a kind heart , which it appears to me is more than you have . Mrs Catsup would never treat me as unkindly as you do . ' And then I choked , - I could have burst out in a regular yell , if I had n't thought the footman might be outside the door listening . And Sibyl only smiled , that patent ice - refrigerator smile of hers , and asked - ' would you prefer to live with Mrs Catsup ? ' Of course I told her no , - nothing would induce me to live with Mrs Catsup , and then she said - ' Miss Chesney , you pay my father for the protection and guarantee of his name and position in English social circles , but the companionship of my father 's daughter was not included in the bargain . I have tried to make you understand as distinctly as I can that I will not be seen in society with you , - not because I dislike you , - far from it , - but simply because people would say I was acting as your paid companion . You force me to speak plainly , and I am sorry if I offend . As for Mrs Catsup , I have only met her once , and she seemed to me very common and ill - bred . Besides I do not care for the society of tradespeople . ' And with that she got up and sailed out , - and I heard her order the carriage for me at ten . It 's coming round directly , and just look at my red eyes ! It 's awfully hard on me , - I know old Catsup made his pile out of varnish , but varnish is as good as anything else in the general market . And - - and - - it 's all out now , Mr Tempest , - and you can tell Sibyl what I 've said if you like ; I know you 're in love with her ! "
78745	78751	78752	78752	I	0	" Really , Miss Chesney , "
78756	78772	78773	78773	she	1456	" Oh yes , Miss Chesney , Miss Chesney - it 's all very well ! "
78798	78928	78793	78793	she	1456	" I 'm only a girl , and it is n't my fault if I 've got a vulgar man for a father who wants to see me married to an English nobleman before he dies , - that 's his look - out - I do n't care about it . English noblemen are a ricketty lot in my opinion . But I 've as good a heart as anyone , and I could love Sibyl if she 'd let me , but she wo n't . She leads the life of an ice - berg , and does n't care a rap for anyone . She does n't care for you , you know ! - I wish she did , - she 'd be more human ! "
78929	78938	78940	78940	I	0	" I 'm very sorry for all this , "
78969	79035	78940	78940	I	0	" But you must n't mind it so much . You are a dear little soul Diana , - kind and generous and impulsive and all the rest of it , - but , - well - - English people are very apt to misunderstand Americans . I can quite enter into your feelings , - still you know Lady Sibyl is very proud - - "
79036	79039	79040	79040	she	1457	" Proud ! "
79043	79114	79040	79040	she	1457	" My ! I guess it must feel something splendid to have an ancestor who was piked through the body on Bosworth field , and left there for the birds to eat . It seems to give a kind of stiffness in the back to all the family ever afterwards . Should n't wonder if the descendants of the birds who ate him felt kinder stuck up about it too ! "
79130	79150	79151	79151	she	1457	" If I told you my ancestor was a Pilgrim Father , you would n't believe me I expect ! "
79161	79170	79171	79171	I	0	" I should believe anything from your lips ! "
79175	79241	79157	79157	her	1457	" Well , believe that , then ! Swallow it down if you can ! I ca n't ! He was a Pilgrim Father in the Mayflower , and he fell on his knees and thanked God as soon as he touched dry land in the true Pilgrim - Father way . But he could n't hold a candle to the piked man at Bosworth . "
79253	79260	79250	79251	a footman	1459	" The carriage is waiting , Miss. "
79261	79302	79250	79251	a footman	1459	" Thanks , - all right . Good - night Mr Tempest , - you 'd better send word to Sibyl you are here ; Lord Elton is dining out , but Sibyl will be at home all the evening . "
79561	79567	79568	79568	she	1460	" My father is out - "
79571	79588	79549	79549	She	1460	" I know . But I came to see you . May I stay a little ? "
79615	79622	79624	79624	I	0	" You look tired Lady Sibyl , "
79628	79634	79624	79624	I	0	" Are you not well ? "
79635	79641	79642	79642	she	1460	" I am quite well - "
79645	79661	79642	79642	she	1460	" But you are right in saying I am tired . I am dreadfully tired ! "
79662	79681	79624	79624	I	0	" You have been doing too much perhaps ? - your attendance on your mother tries you - - "
79686	79825	79624	79624	I	0	" Attendance on my mother ! - pray do not credit me with so much devotion . I never attend on my mother . I can not do it ; I am too much of a coward . Her face terrifies me ; and whenever I do venture to go near her , she tries to speak , with such dreadful , such ghastly efforts , as make her more hideous to look at than anyone can imagine . I should die of fright if I saw her often . As it is , when I do see her I can scarcely stand - and twice I have fainted with the horror of it . To think of it ! - that that living corpse with the fearful fixed eyes and distorted mouth should actually be my mother ! "
79849	79859	79861	79861	I	0	" This must be very bad for your health , "
79871	79881	79861	79861	I	0	" Can you not get away for a change ? "
79913	79924	79926	79926	I	0	" I saw Miss Chesney for a few moments just now "
79930	79936	79926	79926	I	0	" She seemed very unhappy . "
79937	79946	79948	79948	Sibyl	166	" She has nothing to be unhappy about - "
79951	79978	79948	79948	Sibyl	166	" except the time my mother takes in dying . But she is young ; she can afford to wait a little for the Elton coronet . "
79979	79994	79995	79995	I	0	" Is not - - may not this be a mistaken surmise of yours ? "
79999	80013	79995	79995	I	0	" Whatever her faults , I think the girl admires and loves you . "
80018	80028	80030	80030	she	166	" I want neither her love nor her admiration , "
80033	80065	80030	80030	she	166	" I have few women - friends and those few are all hypocrites whom I mistrust . When Diana Chesney is my step - mother , we shall still be strangers . "
80089	80095	80097	80097	Sibyl	166	" Where is your friend ? "
80106	80116	80097	80097	Sibyl	166	" Why does he so seldom come here now ? "
80117	80163	80030	80030	she	166	" Rimânez ? Well , he is a very queer fellow , and at times takes an abhorrence for all society . He frequently meets your father at the club , and I suppose his reason for not coming here is that he hates women . "
80164	80168	80169	80169	she	166	" All women ? "
80176	80180	80254	80254	I	0	" Without exception ! "
80181	80187	80254	80254	I	0	" Then he hates me ? "
80188	80195	80196	80196	I	0	" I did not say that - "

80242	80249	80250	80250	she	166	" So he will never marry ? "
80257	80270	80254	80254	I	0	" Oh , never ! That you may be quite sure of . "
80368	80377	80378	80378	she	166	" Oh , I can not bear it ! "

80427	80492	80494	80494	she	166	" Why do n't you tell me , as you tell my father , your purpose in coming here ? - why do n't you say to me , as you say to him , that your sovereign choice has fastened upon me , - that I am the woman out of all the world you have elected to marry ! Look at me ! "
80503	80640	80494	80494	she	166	" Is there any flaw in the piece of goods you wish to purchase ? This face is deemed worthy of the fashionable photographer 's pains ; worthy of being sold for a shilling as one of England 's ' beauties , ' - this figure has served as a model for the showing - off of many a modiste 's costume , purchased at half - cost on the understanding that I must state to my circle of acquaintance the name of the maker or designer , - these eyes , these lips , these arms are all yours for the buying ! Why do you expose me to the shame of dallying over your bargain ? - by hesitating and considering as to whether , after all , I am worthy of your gold ! "
80673	80678	80679	80679	I	0	" Sibyl , Sibyl ! "
80682	80814	80679	80679	I	0	" Hush - hush ! You are overwrought with fatigue and excitement , - you can not know what you are saying . My darling , what do you take me for ? - what is all this nonsense in your mind about buying and selling ? You know I love you , - I have made no secret of it , - you must have seen it in my face , - and if I have hesitated to speak , it is because I feared your rejection of me . You are too good for me , Sibyl , - too good for any man , - I am not worthy to win your beauty and innocence . My love , my love - do not give way in this manner "
80831	80895	80820	80820	she	1474	" What can I say to you , but that I worship you with all the strength of my life , - I love you so deeply that I am afraid to think of it ; it is a passion I dare not dwell upon , Sibyl , - I love you too well , - too madly for my own peace - - "
81069	81076	81077	81077	she	1474	" What did you feel then ? "
81080	81085	81060	81060	She	1474	" When , Sibyl ? "

81305	81682	81298	81298	she	1474	" this , to which I have now come , - to be the property of a rich man . Many men have looked at me with a view to purchase , but they could not pay the price my father demanded . Pray do not look so distressed ! - what I say is quite true and quite commonplace , - all the women of the upper classes , - the unmarried ones , - are for sale now in England as utterly as the Circassian girls in a barbarian slave - market . I see you wish to protest , and assure me of your devotion , - but there is no need of this , - I am quite sure you love me , - as much as any man can love , - and I am content . But you do not know me really , - you are attracted by my face and form , - and you admire my youth and innocence , which you think I possess . But I am not young - I am old in heart and feeling . I was young for a little while at Willowsmere , when I lived among flowers and birds and all the trustful honest creatures of the woods and fields , - but one season in town was sufficient to kill my youth in me , - one season of dinners and balls , and - fashionable novel - reading . Now you have written a book , and therefore you must know something about the duties of authorship , - of the serious and even terrible responsibility writers incur when they send out to the world books full of pernicious and poisonous suggestion to contaminate the minds that have hitherto been clean and undiseased . Your book has a noble motive ; and for this I admire it in many parts , though to me it is not as convincing as it might have been . It is well written too ; but I gained the impression while reading it , that you were not altogether sincere yourself in the thoughts you strove to inculcate , - and that therefore you just missed what you should have gained .

81745	82062	81731	81731	she	1476	" you have not polluted your pen with the vileness common to many of the authors of the day . I ask you , do you think a girl can read the books that are now freely published , and that her silly society friends tell her to read , - ' because it is so dreadfully queer ! ' - and yet remain unspoilt and innocent ? Books that go into the details of the lives of outcasts ? - that explain and analyse the secret vices of men ? - that advocate almost as a sacred duty ' free love ' and universal polygamy ? - that see no shame in introducing into the circles of good wives and pure - minded girls , a heroine who boldly seeks out a man , any man , in order that she may have a child by him , without the ' degradation ' of marrying him ? I have read all those books , - and what can you expect of me ? Not innocence , surely ! I despise men , - I despise my own sex , - I loathe myself for being a woman ! You wonder at my fanaticism for Mavis Clare , - it is only because for a time her books give me back my self - respect , and make me see humanity in a nobler light , - because she restores to me , if only for an hour , a kind of glimmering belief in God , so that my mind feels refreshed and cleansed . All the same , you must not look upon me as an innocent young girl Geoffrey , - a girl such as the great poets idealized and sang of , - I am a contaminated creature , trained to perfection in the lax morals and prurient literature of my day . "
82135	82144	82146	82146	she	1477	" You shall not be deceived in me , "
82157	82490	82146	82146	she	1477	" If you marry me , you must do so with a full realization of the choice you make . For with such wealth as yours , you can of course we d any woman you fancy . I do not say you could find a girl better than I am ; I do not think you could in my ' set , ' because we are all alike , - all tarred with the same brush , and filled with the same merely sensual and materialistic views of life and its responsibilities as the admired heroines of the ' society ' novels we read . Away in the provinces , among the middle classes it is possible you might discover a really good girl of the purest blush - rose innocence , - but then you might also find her stupid and unentertaining , and you would not care for that . My chief recommendation is that I am beautiful , - you can see that ; everybody can see that , - and I am not so affected as to pretend to be unconscious of the fact . There is no sham about my external appearance ; my hair is not a wig , - my complexion is natural , - my figure is not the result of the corset - maker 's art , - my eyebrows and eyelashes are undyed . Oh yes , - you can be sure that the beauty of my body is quite genuine ! - but it is not the outward expression of an equally beautiful soul . And this is what I want you to understand . I am passionate , resentful , impetuous , - frequently unsympathetic , and inclined to morbidness and melancholy , and I confess I have imbibed , consciously or unconsciously , that complete contempt of life and disbelief in a God , which is the chief theme of nearly all the social teachings of the time . "

82731	82748	82725	82725	she	1480	" Be consoled ! - it is not too late for you to change your mind ! "

82783	82813	82780	82780	I	0	" I love you , - I shall always love you . But I wish you would not analyse yourself so pitilessly , - you have such strange ideas - "
82814	82820	82821	82821	she	1480	" You think them strange ? "
82824	82865	82867	82867	she	1480	" You should not , - in these ' new women ' days ! I believe that , thanks to newspapers , magazines and ' decadent ' novels , I am in all respects eminently fitted to be a wife ! "

You are one of those who can be in the world yet not of it ; your mind is too open and pure to be sullied , even by contact with evil things . I will believe nothing you say against your own sweet and noble character , - and , Sibyl , let me again ask you not to distress me by this constant harping on the subject of my wealth , or I shall be inclined to look upon it as a curse , - I should love you as much if I were poor - - "
83207	83214	83216	83216	she	1497	" Oh , you might love me "
83225	83235	83216	83216	she	1497	" but you would not dare to say so ! "

83262	83349	83259	83259	she	1497	" I have finished my discourse , - my bit of Ibsenism , or whatever other ism affects me , - and we need not be miserable about it . I have said what was in my mind ; I have told you the truth , that in heart I am neither young nor innocent . But I am no worse than all my ' set ' so perhaps you had better make the best of me . I please your fancy , do I not ? "
83350	83364	83365	83365	I	0	" My love for you can not be so lightly expressed , Sibyl ! "
83373	83386	83388	83388	she	1498	" Never mind , - it is my humour so to express it "
83392	83441	83443	83443	she	1498	" I please your fancy , and you wish to marry me . Well now , all I ask is , go to my father and buy me at once ! Conclude the bargain ! And when you have bought me , - do n't look so tragic ! "
83447	83554	83443	83443	she	1498	" and when you have paid the clergyman , and paid the bridesmaids with monogram lockets or brooches and paid the guests with wedding - cake and champagne and cleared up all scores with everybody , even to the last man who shuts the door of the nuptial brougham , - will you take me away , - far away from this place - this house , where my mother 's face haunts me like a ghost in the darkness ; where I am tortured by terrors night and day , - where I hear such strange sounds , and dream of such ghastly things , - "
83570	83615	83562	83562	she	1498	" Oh yes , Geoffrey , take me away as quickly as possible ! Let us never live in hateful London , but at Willowsmere ; I may find some of the old joys there , - and some of the happy bygone days . "
83652	83663	83664	83664	I	0	" It shall be as you wish , my darling , "

83720	83762	83716	83716	I	0	" remember , - there must be no more talk of money and bargaining . Tell me what you have not yet told me , - that you love me , - and would love me even if I were poor . "
83775	83783	83785	83785	she	1498	" I can not tell you that , "
83789	83819	83785	83785	she	1498	" I have told you I do not believe in love ; and if you were poor I certainly should not marry you . It would be no use ! "
83820	83827	83842	83842	she	1498	" You are frank , Sibyl ! "
83828	83840	83842	83842	she	1498	" It is best to be frank , is it not ? "
83861	83953	83842	83842	she	1498	" Geoffrey what is the good of pretence ? You would hate to be poor , and so should I. I do not understand the verb ' to love , ' - now and then when I read a book by Mavis Clare , I believe love may exist , but when I close the book my belief is shut up with it . So do not ask for what is not in me . I am willing - even glad to marry you ; that is all you must expect . "

84569	84659	84561	84561	His	124	" Oh ! - sets the wind in that quarter ! Why then , my dear Geoffrey , I congratulate you more heartily than ever . To conquer the affections of one of the proudest girls in England , and win her love so completely as to be sure she would marry you even if you had not a sou to bless yourself with - this is a victory indeed ! - and one of which you may well be proud . Again and yet again I congratulate you ! "
84765	84768	84770	84770	he	124	" You see "
84779	84888	84770	84770	he	124	" I was not aware that any old - world romance graced the disposition of one so apparently impassive as your beautiful fiancée . To love for love 's sake only , is becoming really an obsolete virtue . I thought Lady Sibyl was an essentially modern woman , conscious of her position , and the necessity there was for holding that position proudly before the world at all costs , - and that the pretty pastoral sentiments of poetical Phyllises and Amandas had no place in her nature . I was wrong , it seems ; and for once I have been mistaken in the fair sex ! "
84920	84959	84890	84890	he	124	" My friend , I assure you , if you have won a true woman 's true love , you have a far greater fortune than your millions , - a treasure that none can afford to despise . "
84983	84993	84975	84975	I	0	" Why Lucio , I thought you hated women ? "

85004	85084	85000	85000	he	124	" But do not forget why I hate them ! It is because they have all the world 's possibilities of good in their hands , and the majority of them deliberately turn these possibilities to evil . Men are influenced entirely by women , though few of them will own it , - through women they are lifted to heaven or driven to hell . The latter is the favourite course , and the one almost universally adopted . "
85116	85138	85113	85113	I	0	" Put that abominable ' sprite ' of yours away , will you ? I hate to see you with it ! "

85154	85200	85148	85148	he	124	" Why so cruel to her Geoffrey ? If you had lived in her day , you might have been one of her lovers ! She was no doubt a charming person , - I find her charming still ! However , to oblige you - "
85233	85273	85230	85230	he	124	" Who knows what the ' sprite ' suffered as a woman , Geoffrey ! Perhaps she made a rich marriage , and repented it ! At anyrate I am sure she is much happier in her present condition ! "

' In these ' matters scientific ' you have not tested my skill , - yet you ask - ' how can I know ? ' I answer that I do know - many things of which you are ignorant . Do not presume too much on your own intellectual capability my friend , - lest I prove it naught ! - lest I demonstrate to you , beyond all possibility of consoling doubt , that the shreds and strippings of that change you call death , are only so many embryos of new life which you must live , whether you will or no !

85610	85774	85598	85598	he	1509	" ' Every man his own theory ' is the fashionable motto of the hour . Each little biped tells you that he has his ' own idea ' of God , and equally ' his own ' idea of the Devil . It is very droll ! But let us return to the theme of love . I feel I have not congratulated you half enough , - for surely Fortune favours you singularly . Out of the teeming mass of vain and frivolous femininity , you have secured a unique example of beauty , truth and purity , - a woman , who apart from all self - interest and worldly advantage , weds you , with five millions , for yourself alone ! The prettiest poem in the world could be made out of such an exquisitely innocent maiden type ! You are one of the luckiest men alive ; in fact , you have nothing more to wish for ! "

86066	86325	86063	86063	he	174	" No one can account for the caprices of the public ; they are entirely beyond the most cautious publisher 's control or calculation . Miss Clare is a sore subject to many authors besides yourself , - she always ' takes ' and no one can help it . I sympathize with you in the matter heartily , but I am not to blame . At any rate the reviewers are all with you , - their praise has been almost unanimous . Now Mavis Clare 's ' Differences , ' though to my thinking a very brilliant and powerful book , has been literally cut to pieces whenever it has been noticed at all , - and yet the public go for her and do n't go for you . It is n't my fault . You see people have got Compulsory Education now , and I 'm afraid they begin to mistrust criticism , preferring to form their own independent opinions ; if this is so , of course it will be a terrible thing , because the most carefully organized clique in the world will be powerless . Everything has been done for you that can be done , Mr Tempest , - I am sure I regret as much as yourself that the result has not been all you expected or desired . Many authors would not care so much for the public approval ; the applause of cultured journalism such as you have obtained , would be more than sufficient for them . "
86433	86455	86428	86428	I	0	" You have not kept all your promises , my friend ! - you told me you could give me fame ! "

86476	86484	86485	86485	I	0	" No . I am merely notorious , "
86491	86524	86456	86456	He	124	" The word fame , my good Geoffrey , traced to its origin means ' a breath ' - the breath of popular adulation . You have that - for your wealth . "

86582	86735	86578	86578	he	124	" Now the nature of work I can not exactly express , because it is a divine thing and is judged by a divine standard . One must consider in all work two things ; first , the object for which it is undertaken , and secondly the way in which it is performed . All work should have a high and unselfish intent , - without this , it perishes and is not considered work at all , - not at least by the eternal judges invisible . If it is work , truly and nobly done in every sense of the word , it carries with it its own reward , and the laurels descend from heaven shaped ready for wearing , - no earthly power can bestow them . I can not give you that fame , - but I have secured you a very fair imitation of it . "
87318	87327	87328	87328	I	0	" It is all your doing , Lucio ! "
87331	87379	87328	87328	I	0	" I feel I can never thank you enough ! Without you I should perhaps never have met Sibyl , - I might never have heard of her , or of Willowsmere ; and I never could have been as happy as I am to - day ! "
87380	87388	87389	87389	he	1540	" Oh , you are happy then ? "
87396	87403	87389	87389	he	1540	" I fancied you were not ! "
87404	87419	87420	87420	I	0	" Well - I have not been as happy as I expected to be ; "
87424	87451	87420	87420	I	0	" Something in my sudden accession to wealth seems to have dragged me down rather than lifted me up , - - it is strange - - "
87452	87459	87461	87461	he	1540	" It is not strange at all "
87465	87488	87461	87461	he	1540	" on the contrary it is very natural . As a rule the most miserable people in the world are the rich . "
87489	87497	87498	87498	I	0	" Are you miserable , for instance ? "
87515	87526	87527	87527	he	1540	" Are you too blind to see that I am ? "
87537	87724	87527	87527	he	1540	" Can you think I am happy ? Does the smile I wear , - the disguising smile men put on as a mask to hide their secret agonies from the pitiless gaze of unsympathetic fellow - creatures , - persuade you that I am free from care ? As for my wealth , - I have never told you the extent of it ; if I did , it might indeed amaze you , though I believe it would not now arouse your envy , considering that your trifling five millions have not been without effect in depressing your mind . But I , - I could buy up kingdoms and be none the poorer , - I could throne and unthrone kings and be none the wiser , - I could crush whole countries under the iron heel of financial speculation , - I could possess the world , - and yet estimate it at no higher value than I do now , - the value of a grain of dust circling through infinity , or a soap - bubble blown on the wind ! "
87739	87748	87750	87750	I	0	" There is some mystery about you Lucio ; "
87753	87784	87750	87750	I	0	" Some grief or loss that your wealth can not repair - and that makes you the strange being you are . One day perhaps you will confide in me ... "
87802	87806	87807	87807	he	1541	" I will ! "
87810	87915	87807	87807	he	1541	" I will tell you my history ! And you , excellent agnostic as you are , shall ' minister to a mind diseased , ' and ' pluck out the memory of a rooted sorrow ! ' What a power of expression there was in Shakespeare , the uncrowned but actual King of England ! Not the ' rooted sorrow ' alone was to be ' plucked out ' but the very ' memory ' of it . The apparently simple line holds complex wisdom ; no doubt the poet knew , or instinctively guessed the most terrible fact in all the Universe ... "
87916	87922	87953	87953	I	0	" And what is that ? "
87923	87930	87931	87931	he	1541	" The eternal consciousness of Memory - "
87934	87952	87931	87931	he	1541	" God can not forget , - and in consequence of this , His creatures may not ! "
87985	87996	87997	87997	he	1541	" I go beyond your patience , do I not ! "
88003	88103	87997	87997	he	1541	" When I mention God , - who is declared by certain scientists to be non - existent except as a blind , indifferent natural Force or Atom - producer ; - you are bored ! I can see that at a glance . Pray forgive me ! Let us resume our tour of inspection through this charming abode . You will be very difficult to satisfy if you are not a very emperor of contentment here ; - with a beautiful wife and plenty of cash , you can well afford to give fame the go - by . "
88104	88111	88112	88112	I	0	" I may win it yet ! "
88116	88132	88112	88112	I	0	" In this place , I feel I could write something worthy of being written . "
88133	88174	87997	87997	he	1541	" Good ! The ' divine flutterings ' of winged thoughts are in your brain ! Apollo grant them strength to fly ! And now let us have luncheon , - afterwards we shall have time to take a stroll . "
88253	88266	88269	88269	Lucio	124	" Now I want you to do me a favour , Geoffrey , "
88275	88387	88269	88269	Lucio	124	" You will scarcely need to reside here till after your marriage ; you have too many engagements in town . You spoke of entertaining a big house - party down here , - I would n't do that if I were you , - it is n't worth while . You would have to get in a staff of servants , and leave them all afterwards to their own devices while you are on your honeymoon . This is what I propose , - give a grand fête here in honour of your betrothal to Lady Sibyl , in May - and let me be the master of the revels ! "
88416	88532	88411	88411	Rimânez	124	" You understand of course , that if I undertake to do a thing I always do it thoroughly , and brook no interference with my plans . Now as your marriage will be the signal for our parting , - at any rate for a time , - I should like to show my appreciation of your friendship , by organizing a brilliant affair of the kind I suggest , - and if you will leave it all to me , I guarantee you shall hold such a fête as has never been seen or known in England . And it will be a personal satisfaction to me if you consent to my proposal . "
88533	88538	88539	88539	I	0	" My dear fellow - "
88542	88585	88539	88539	I	0	" Of course I consent - willingly ! I give you carte blanche , - do as you like ; do all you like ! It is most friendly and kind of you ! But when are we to make this sensation ? "
88586	88595	88596	88596	he	1546	" You are to be married in June ? "
88599	88611	88539	88539	I	0	" Yes , - in the second week of the month . "
88612	88707	88715	88715	him	1546	" Very well . The fête shall be held on the twenty - second of May , - that will give society time to recover from the effect of one burst of splendour in order to be ready for another , - namely the wedding . Now we need not talk of this any more - it is settled , - the rest devolves on me . We 've got three or four hours to spare before we take the train back to town , - suppose we take a saunter through the grounds ? "
88967	88972	88973	88973	he	124	" Listen , Geoffrey ! "
88976	89006	88973	88973	he	124	" Listen to the silence of the earth while the lark sings ! Have you ever observed the receptive attitude in which Nature seems to wait for sounds divine ! "
89051	89057	89060	89060	Lucio	124	" In the clerical Heaven , "
89063	89163	89060	89060	Lucio	124	" there are no birds . There are only conceited human souls braying forth ' Alleluia ' ! No flowers are included , - no trees ; only ' golden streets . ' What a poor and barbarous conception ! As if a World inhabited by Deity would not contain the wonders , graces and beauties of all worlds ! Even this little planet is more naturally beautiful than the clerical Heaven , - that is , it is beautiful wherever Man is not . I protest - I have always protested , - against the creation of Man ! "
89167	89176	89177	89177	I	0	" You protest against your own existence then ! "
89190	89478	89180	89180	His	124	" When the sea roars and flings itself in anger on the shore , it craves its prey - Mankind ! - it seeks to wash the fair earth clean of the puny insect that troubles the planet 's peace ! It drowns the noxious creature when it can , with the aid of its sympathizing comrade the wind ! When the thunder crashes down a second after the lightning , does it not seem to you that the very clouds combine in the holy war ? The war against God 's one mistake ; - the making of humanity , - the effort to sweep it out of the universe as one erases a weak expression in an otherwise perfect Poem ! You and I , for example , are the only discords in to - day 's woodland harmony . We are not particularly grateful for life , - we certainly are not content with it , - we have not the innocence of a bird or a flower . We have more knowledge you will say , - but how can we be sure of that ? Our wisdom came from the devil in the first place , according to the legend of the tree of knowledge , - the fruit of which taught both good and evil , but which still apparently persuades man to evil rather than good , and leads him on to a considerable amount of arrogance besides , for he has an idea he will be immortal as a god in the hereafter , - ye majestic Heavens ! - what an inadequately stupendous fate for a grain of worthless dust , - a dwarfish atom such as he ! "
89479	89488	89490	89490	I	0	" Well , I have no ideas of immortality "
89493	89516	89490	89490	I	0	" I have told you that often . This life is enough for me , - I want and expect no other . "
89517	89526	89528	89528	Lucio	124	" Aye , but if there were another ! "
89537	89569	89528	89528	Lucio	124	" And - if you were not asked your opinion about it - but simply plunged headlong into a state of terrible consciousness in which you would rather not be - - "
89570	89574	89575	89575	I	0	" Oh come , "
89579	89630	89575	89575	I	0	" do not let us theorise ! I am happy to - day ! - my heart is as light as that of the bird singing in the sky ; I am in the very best of humours , and could not say an unkind word to my worst enemy . "
89634	89640	89642	89642	he	124	" Is that your humour ? "
89649	89668	89642	89642	he	124	" Then there could be no better opportunity for showing you this pretty little corner of the world ; "
89729	89764	90143	90143	He	124	" Keep firm hold over your temper Geoffrey , - and maintain the benignant tranquillity of your mind ! - here dwells the woman whose name and fame you hate , - Mavis Clare ! "
89778	89784	89785	89785	I	0	" Let us go back , "
89788	89791	90102	90102	he	124	" Why ? "
89792	89823	90102	90102	he	124	" Because I do not know Miss Clare and do not want to know her . Literary women are my abhorrence , - they are always more or less unsexed . "
89824	89954	90102	90102	he	124	" You are thinking of the ' New ' women I suppose , - but you flatter them , - they never had any sex to lose . The self - degrading creatures who delineate their fictional heroines as wallowing in unchastity , and who write freely on subjects which men would hesitate to name , are unnatural hybrids of no - sex . Mavis Clare is not one of them , - she is an ' old - fashioned ' young woman . Mademoiselle Derino , the dancer , is ' unsexed , ' but you did not object to her on that score , - on the contrary I believe you have shown your appreciation of her talents by spending a considerable amount of cash upon her . "
89955	89962	89964	89964	I	0	" That 's not a fair comparison "
89968	89977	89964	89964	I	0	" Mademoiselle Derino amused me for a time . "
89978	89987	89989	89989	Lucio	124	" And was not your rival in art ! "
89996	90086	89989	89989	Lucio	124	" I see ! Still , - as far as the question of being ' unsexed ' goes , I , personally , consider that a woman who shows the power of her intellect is more to be respected than the woman who shows the power of her legs . But men always prefer the legs , - just as they prefer the devil to the Deity . All the same , I think , as we have time to spare , we may as well see this genius . "
90087	90090	90091	90091	I	0	" Genius ! "
90095	90101	90102	90102	he	124	" Feminine twaddler , then ! "
90107	90142	90102	90102	he	124	" Let us see this feminine twaddler . She will no doubt prove as amusing as Mademoiselle Derino in her way . I shall ring the bell and ask if she is at home . "
90193	90208	90188	90190	a clear voice	1562	" Oh Tricksy ! You wicked boy ! Take it back directly and apologise ! "
90222	90227	90228	90228	he	124	" There she is ! "
90231	90273	90228	90228	he	124	" There is the dyspeptic , sour , savage old blue - stocking , - there , on the lawn , - by Heaven ! - she 's enough to strike terror into the heart of any man - and millionaire ! "
90569	90577	90578	90578	I	0	" That can not be Miss Clare , "
90581	90630	90578	90578	I	0	" More likely a visitor , - or perhaps the companion - secretary . The novelist must be very different in appearance to that frivolous young person in white , whose dress is distinctly Parisian , and who seems to have nothing whatever to do but amuse herself . "
90631	90634	90636	90638	the clear voice	1574	" Tricksy ! "
90641	90649	90636	90638	the clear voice	1574	" Take back the biscuit and apologise ! "
90682	90685	90636	90638	the clear voice	1574	" Tricksy ! "
90693	90700	90636	90638	the clear voice	1574	" Take it back and apologise ! "
90772	90778	90779	90781	The St Bernard	236	" There ! take it ! "
90834	90836	90820	90820	he	236	" Tricksy "
90903	90910	90911	90911	he	124	" Is Miss Clare at home ? "
90914	90930	90931	90932	the maid	1579	" Yes sir . But I am not sure whether she will receive you , - "
90935	90942	90931	90932	the maid	1579	" Unless you have an appointment ? "
90943	90949	90952	90952	Lucio	124	" We have no appointment , "
90955	90965	90952	90952	Lucio	124	" but if you will take these cards , - "
90972	90981	90967	90967	he	124	" Geoffrey , give me one of yours ! "
90988	90995	90997	90997	he	124	" If you will take these cards "
91000	91027	90997	90997	he	124	" to Miss Clare , it is just possible she may be kind enough to see us . If not , it will be our loss . "
91052	91063	91064	91064	she	903	" Step in , sir , if you please , - "
91276	91286	91287	91287	he	124	" Here is the Autocrat of all the Russias , "
91299	91396	91399	91399	his	124	" Signed by the Imperial hand too . Now what has the ' feminine twaddler ' done to deserve that honour I wonder ! Here in strange contrast , is the wild - haired Paderewski , - and beside him the perennial Patti , - there is Her Majesty of Italy , and here we have the Prince of Wales , - all autographed likenesses . Upon my word , Miss Clare seems to attract a great many notabilities around her without the aid of hard cash . I wonder how she does it , Geoffrey ? "
91405	91421	91423	91423	he	124	" Can it be a case of genius after all ? Look at those lilies ! "
91437	91475	91423	91423	he	124	" Are they not far more beautiful creatures than men and women ? Dumb - yet eloquent of purity ! - no wonder the painters choose them as the only flowers suitable for the adornment of angels . "
91556	91567	91569	91569	he	124	" We must apologise for our intrusion , Miss Clare , "
91572	91597	91599	91599	he	124	" But happening to pass your house , we could not resist making an attempt to see you . My name is - - Rimânez "
91610	91625	91599	91599	he	124	" and this is my friend Mr Geoffrey Tempest , the author , - - "
91645	91727	91642	91642	her	814	" he has , as I daresay you know , become the owner of Willowsmere Court . You will be neighbours , and I hope , friends . In any case if we have committed a breach of etiquette in venturing to call upon you without previous introduction , you must try and forgive us ! It is difficult , - to me impossible , - to pass the dwelling of a celebrity without offering homage to the presiding genius within . "
91748	91754	91755	91755	she	200	" You are very welcome , "
91776	91803	91755	91755	she	200	" I am quite accustomed to visits from strangers . But I already know Mr Tempest very well by reputation . Wo n't you sit down ? "
91827	91832	91823	91824	Her maid	1598	" Tea , Janet . "
92068	92078	92079	92079	she	200	" Is this your first visit to Willowsmere Court ? "
92082	92085	92086	92086	I	0	" Yes , "
92099	92122	92086	92086	I	0	" I bought the place , - on the recommendation of my friend the prince here , - without looking at it . "
92123	92128	92130	92130	she	200	" So I heard , "
92138	92146	92130	92130	she	200	" And you are satisfied with it ? "
92147	92163	92130	92130	she	200	" More than satisfied - I am delighted . It exceeds all my best expectations . "
92164	92180	92130	92130	she	200	" Mr Tempest is going to marry the daughter of the former owner of Willowsmere , "
92187	92199	92130	92130	she	200	" No doubt you have seen it announced in the papers ? "
92200	92203	92205	92205	she	200	" Yes ; "
92212	92283	92205	92205	she	200	" I have seen it - and I think Mr Tempest is much to be congratulated . Lady Sibyl is very lovely , - I remember her as a beautiful child when I was a child myself - I never spoke to her , but I often saw her . She must be charmed at the prospect of returning as a bride to the old home she loved so well . "
92434	92443	92445	92445	she	204	" Your book was very clever , Mr Tempest "
92453	92476	92445	92445	she	204	" I read it as soon as it came out . But do you know I think your article was even cleverer ? "
92487	92498	92499	92499	I	0	" To what article do you allude , Miss Clare ? "
92503	92512	92499	92499	I	0	" I do not write for any magazine . "
92513	92516	92518	92518	she	204	" No ? "
92522	92614	92518	92518	she	204	" But you did on this occasion ! You ' slated ' me very smartly ! - I quite enjoyed it . I found out that you were the author of the philippic , - not through the editor of the journal - oh no , poor man ! he is very discreet ; but through quite another person who must be nameless . It is very difficult to prevent me from finding out whatever I wish to know , especially in literary matters ! Why , you look quite unhappy ! "
92631	92683	92623	92623	she	204	" You really do n't suppose I was hurt by your critique , do you ? Dear me , no ! Nothing of that kind ever affronts me , - I am far too busy to waste any thought on reviews or reviewers . Only your article was so exceptionally funny ! "
92684	92687	92688	92688	I	0	" Funny ? "
92702	92707	92708	92708	she	204	" Yes , funny ! "
92711	92749	92708	92708	she	204	" It was so very angry that it became amusing . My poor ' Differences ' ! I am really sorry it put you into such a temper , - temper does exhaust one 's energies so ! "
92919	92927	92928	92928	she	204	" Tricksy , what is the matter ? "
92954	92964	92966	92966	she	204	" I never knew him do such a thing before "
92969	92980	92966	92966	she	204	" Perhaps you do not like dogs , Prince Rimânez ? "
92981	92991	92992	92992	he	124	" I am afraid they do not like me ! "
92997	93005	93006	93006	she	204	" Then pray excuse me a moment ! "
93094	93136	93046	93046	she	204	" I am very glad , Miss Clare , that you were not offended at the article you speak of . It was rather strong I admit , - but you know we can not all be of the same opinion ... "
93137	93141	93142	93142	she	204	" Indeed no ! "
93151	93439	93142	93142	she	204	" Such a state of things would make a very dull world ! I assure you I was not and am not in the least offended - the critique was a smart piece of writing , and made not the slightest effect on me or on my book . You remember what Shelley wrote of critics ? No ? You will find the passage in his preface to ' The Revolt of Islam , ' and it runs thus , - ' I have sought to write as I believe that Homer , Shakespeare , and Milton wrote , with an utter disregard of anonymous censure . I am certain that calumny and misrepresentation , though it may move me to compassion can not disturb my peace . I shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak . I shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions , those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discern in my appeal to the Public . If certain Critics were as clear - sighted as they are malignant , how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings ! As it is , I fear I shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives . Should the public judge that my composition is worthless , I shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which Milton received his crown of immortality , and shall seek to gather , if I live , strength from that defeat , which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless ! ' "
93487	93495	93496	93496	she	1610	" You see I know my Shelley ! "
93507	93589	93591	93591	she	1610	" And those words are particularly familiar to me , because I have had them painted up on a panel in my study . Just to remind me , in case I should forget , what the really great geniuses of the world thought of criticism , - because their example is very encouraging and helpful to a humble little worker like myself . I am not a press - favourite - and I never get good reviews , - but - "
93595	93618	93591	93591	she	1610	" I like my reviewers all the same ! If you have finished your tea , will you come and see them ? "
93644	93650	93651	93651	she	1610	" Come and see them ! "
93654	93663	93651	93651	she	1610	" They generally expect me at this hour ! "
93935	93946	93947	93947	she	200	" Let me hold him ! He will obey me ! "
93961	93975	93947	93947	she	200	" Down , Emperor ! Down ! How dare you ! Down sir ! "
94025	94032	94033	94033	she	200	" I am so very sorry ! "
94037	94098	94033	94033	she	200	" I forgot , - you told me dogs do not like you . But what a singularly marked antipathy , is it not ? I can not understand it . Emperor is generally so good - natured , - I must apologize for his bad conduct - it is quite unusual . I hope he has not hurt you ? "
94099	94104	94106	94106	Lucio	124	" Not at all ! "
94114	94128	94106	94106	Lucio	124	" I hope I have not hurt him , - or distressed you ! "
94165	94173	94174	94174	he	124	" What do you think of her ? "
94179	94187	94188	94188	I	0	" I hardly know what to think , "
94192	94209	94188	94188	I	0	" She is very different to what I imagined . Her dogs are rather unpleasant company ! "
94210	94216	94217	94217	he	124	" They are honest animals ! "
94221	94240	94217	94217	he	124	" They are no doubt accustomed to candour in their mistress , and therefore object to personified lies . "
94241	94246	94247	94247	I	0	" Speak for yourself ! "
94251	94259	94247	94247	I	0	" They object to you , chiefly . "
94260	94269	94270	94270	he	124	" Am I not fully aware of that ? "
94273	94376	94270	94270	he	124	" and do I not speak for myself ? You do not suppose I would call you a personified lie , do you , - even if it were true ! I would not be so uncivil . But I am a living lie , and knowing it I admit it , which gives me a certain claim to honesty above the ordinary run of men . This woman - wearer of laurels is a personified truth ! - imagine it ! - she has no occasion to pretend to be anything else than she is ! No wonder she is famous ! "
94565	94571	94572	94572	she	1626	" Here are my reviewers ! "
94576	94623	94572	94572	she	1626	" Are they not pretty creatures ? The ones I know best are named after their respective journals , - there are plenty of anonymous ones of course , who flock in with the rest . Here , for instance , is the ' Saturday Review ' "
94649	94673	94626	94626	she	1626	" He fights with all his companions and drives them away from the food whenever he can . He is a quarrelsome creature ! "
94683	94723	94725	94725	she	1626	" You never know how to please him , - he takes offence at the corn sometimes and will only eat peas , or vice versa . He quite deserves his name , - go away , old boy ! "
94740	94755	94758	94758	she	1626	" He is such a comical old grumbler ! There is the ' Speaker ' "
94766	94891	94893	94893	she	1626	" He struts very well , and fancies he 's important , you know , but he is n't . Over there is ' Public Opinion , ' - that one half - asleep on the wall ; next to him is the ' Spectator , ' - you see he has two rings round his eyes like spectacles . That brown creature with the fluffy wings all by himself on that flower - pot is the ' Nineteenth Century , ' - the little bird with the green neck is the ' Westminster Gazette , ' and the fat one sitting on the platform of the cote is the ' Pall - Mall . ' He knows his name very well - see ! "
94897	94908	94893	94893	she	1626	" Pall Mall ! Come boy ! - come here ! "
94926	94942	94944	94944	she	1626	" There are so many others , - it is difficult to distinguish them sometimes , "
94948	95059	94944	94944	she	1626	" Whenever I get a bad review I name a pigeon , - it amuses me . That draggle - tailed one with the muddy feet is the ' Sketch , ' - he is not at all a well - bred bird I must tell you ! - that smart - looking dove with the purple breast is the ' Graphic , ' and that bland old grey thing is the ' I. L. N. ' short for ' Illustrated London News . ' Those three white ones are respectively ' Daily Telegraph , ' ' Morning Post , ' and ' Standard . ' Now see them all ! "
95150	95159	95162	95162	Lucio	124	" You are indeed a sweet - natured philosopher "
95165	95179	95162	95162	Lucio	124	" if you can symbolize your adverse reviewers by a flock of doves ! "
95184	95195	95197	95197	she	1626	" Well , it is a remedy against all irritation , "
95200	95280	95197	95197	she	1626	" I used to worry a good deal over my work , and wonder why it was that the press people were so unnecessarily hard upon me , when they showed so much leniency and encouragement to far worse writers , - but after a little serious consideration , finding that critical opinion carried no sort of conviction whatever to the public , I determined to trouble no more about it , - except in the way of doves ! "
95281	95293	95295	95295	I	0	" In the way of doves , you feed your reviewers , "
95298	95315	95316	95316	she	1626	" Exactly ! And I suppose I help to feed them even as women and men ! "
95319	95379	95316	95316	she	1626	" They get something from their editors for ' slashing ' my work , - and they probably make a little more out of selling their ' review copies . ' So you see the dove - emblem holds good throughout . But you have not seen the ' Athenæum , ' - oh , you must see him ! "
95483	95488	95490	95490	Mavis	200	" Cross old boy ! "
95504	95529	95490	95490	Mavis	200	" Have n't you found any mice to kill to - day ? Oh , what wicked eyes ! - what a snappy mouth ! "
95539	95614	95535	95535	she	1626	" Is n't he a lovely owl ? Does n't he look wise ? - but as a matter of fact he 's just as stupid as ever he can be . That is why I call him the ' Athenæum ' ! He looks so profound , you 'd fancy he knows everything , but he really thinks of nothing but killing mice all the time , - which limits his intelligence considerably ! "
95632	95642	95644	95644	I	0	" But there are two other owls in the cage "
95647	95653	95644	95644	I	0	" What are their names ? "
95664	95673	95674	95674	she	1626	" Ah , that would be telling secrets ! "
95677	95720	95674	95674	she	1626	" They 're all the ' Athenæum ' - the holy Three , - a sort of literary Trinity . But why a trinity I do not venture to explain ! - it is a riddle I must leave you to guess ! "
95758	95769	95755	95755	she	1626	" Would you care to see my work - room ? "
95795	95810	95811	95811	he	124	" Miss Clare , are you going to name a pigeon after Mr Tempest ? "
95814	95838	95811	95811	he	124	" He played the part of an adverse critic , you know - but I doubt whether he will ever do so again ! "
95847	95858	95860	95860	she	1626	" Oh , I have been merciful to Mr Tempest , "
95863	95877	95860	95860	she	1626	" He is among the anonymous birds whom I do not specially recognise ! "
96146	96174	96099	96099	she	200	" To thine own self be true , And it must follow as the night the day , Thou canst not then be false to any man . "
96285	96298	96300	96300	he	124	" We could stay on here for an indefinite period Miss Clare , "
96311	96331	96332	96332	He	124	" It is a place for peace and happy meditation , - a restful corner for a tired soul . "
96343	96361	96332	96332	He	124	" But trains wait for no man , and we are returning to town to - night . "
96362	96372	96374	96376	our young hostess	1650	" Then I will not detain you any longer , "
96409	96416	96417	96417	she	1650	" I hope , Mr Tempest , "
96425	96451	96417	96417	she	1650	" that now we have met , you will no longer desire to qualify as one of my pigeons ! It is scarcely worth while ! "
96452	96456	96457	96457	I	0	" Miss Clare , "
96466	96496	96457	96457	I	0	" I assure you , on my honour , I am very sorry I wrote that article against you . If I had only known you as you are - "
96497	96509	96510	96510	she	1650	" Oh , that should make no difference to a critic ! "
96514	96524	96526	96526	I	0	" It would have made a great difference to me "
96529	96542	96526	96526	I	0	" You are so unlike the objectionable ' literary woman , ' - "
96563	96584	96560	96560	I	0	" I must tell you that Sibyl , - Lady Sibyl Elton - is one of your most ardent admirers . "
96585	96594	96596	96596	she	1650	" I am very pleased to hear that , "
96600	96616	96596	96596	she	1650	" I am always glad when I succeed in winning somebody 's approval and liking . "
96617	96626	96628	96628	Lucio	124	" Does not everyone approve and admire you ? "
96630	96653	96655	96655	she	1650	" Oh no ! By no means ! The ' Saturday ' says I only win the applause of shop - girls ! "
96658	96699	96655	96655	she	1650	" Poor old ' Saturday ' ! - the writers on its staff are so jealous of any successful author . I told the Prince of Wales what it said the other day , and he was very much amused . "
96700	96706	96707	96707	I	0	" You know the Prince ? "
96715	96730	96731	96731	she	1650	" Well , it would be more correct to say that he knows me , "
96734	96799	96731	96731	she	1650	" He has been very amiable in taking some little interest in my books . He knows a good deal about literature too , - much more than people give him credit for . He has been here more than once , - and has seen me feed my reviewers - the pigeons , you know ! He rather enjoyed the fun I think ! "
96903	96921	96922	96922	I	0	" How different you are - how widely different - to the ordinary run of literary people ! "
96926	96935	96937	96937	she	1650	" I am glad you find me so , "
96940	97100	96937	96937	she	1650	" I hope I am different . As a rule literary people take themselves far too seriously , and attach too much importance to what they do . That is why they become such bores . I do n't believe anyone ever did thoroughly good work who was not perfectly happy over it , and totally indifferent to opinion . I should be quite content to write on , if I only had a garret to live in . I was once very poor , - shockingly poor ; and even now I am not rich , but I 've got just enough to keep me working steadily , which is as it should be . If I had more , I might get lazy and neglect my work , - then you know Satan might step into my life , and it would be a question of idle hands and mischief to follow , according to the adage . "
97101	97114	97116	97116	Lucio	124	" I think you would have strength enough to resist Satan , - "
97131	97150	97152	97152	she	1659	" Oh , I do n't know about that , - I could not be sure of myself ! "
97155	97211	97152	97152	she	1659	" I should imagine he must be a dangerously fascinating personage . I never picture him as the possessor of hoofs and a tail , - common - sense assures me that no creature presenting himself under such an aspect would have the slightest power to attract . Milton 's conception of Satan is the finest "
97225	97249	97214	97214	her	1659	" A mighty Angel fallen ! - one can not but be sorry for such a fall , if the legend were true ! "
97275	97283	97285	97285	Lucio	124	" Good - bye , Mavis Clare ! "
97315	97320	97321	97321	she	1659	" Good - bye ! "
97365	97374	97376	97376	he	124	" Be always as you are Mavis Clare ! "
97380	97631	97376	97376	he	124	" Let nothing change you ! Keep that bright nature of yours , - that unruffled spirit of quiet contentment , and you may wear the bitter laurel of fame as sweetly as a rose ! I have seen the world ; I have travelled far , and have met many famous men and women , - kings and queens , senators , poets and philosophers , - my experience has been wide and varied , so that I am not altogether without authority for what I say , - and I assure you that the Satan of whom you are able to speak with compassion , can never trouble the peace of a pure and contented soul . Like consorts with like , - a fallen angel seeks the equally fallen , - and the devil , - if there be one , - becomes the companion of those only who take pleasure in his teaching and society . Legends say he is afraid of a crucifix , - but if he is afraid of anything I should say it must be of that ' sweet content ' concerning which your country 's Shakespeare sings , and which is a better defence against evil than the church or the prayers of the clergy ! I speak as one having the right of age to speak , - I am so many many years older than you ! - - you must forgive me if I have said too much ! "
97674	97687	97689	97689	I	0	" I am very glad to have met you , Miss Clare , "
97692	97700	97689	97689	I	0	" I hope we shall be friends ! "
97701	97714	97715	97715	she	1661	" There is no reason why we should be enemies I think , "
97719	97760	97715	97715	she	1661	" I am very pleased you came to - day . If ever you want to ' slate ' me again , you know your fate ! - you become a dove , - nothing more ! Good - bye ! "
97856	97868	97853	97853	Lucio	124	" Well ; now , what do you think of her ? "
97869	97887	97888	97888	I	0	" She is as unlike the accepted ideal of the female novelist as she can well be , "
97895	97903	97905	97905	he	124	" Accepted ideals are generally mistaken ones , "
97912	98250	97905	97905	he	124	" An accepted ideal of Divinity in some church pictures is an old man 's face set in a triangle . The accepted ideal of the devil is a nondescript creature , with horns , hoofs one of them cloven and a tail , as Miss Clare just now remarked . The accepted ideal of beauty is the Venus de Medicis , - whereas your Lady Sibyl entirely transcends that much over - rated statue . The accepted ideal of a poet is Apollo , - he was a god , - and no poet in the flesh ever approaches the god - like ! And the accepted ideal of the female novelist , is an elderly , dowdy , spectacled , frowsy fright , - Mavis Clare does not fulfil this description , yet she is the author of ' Differences . ' Now McWhing , who thrashes her continually in all the papers he can command , is elderly , ugly , spectacled and frowsy , - and he is the author of - nothing ! Women - authors are invariably supposed to be hideous , - men - authors for the most part are hideous . But their hideousness is not noted or insisted upon , - whereas , no matter how good - looking women - writers may be , they still pass under press - comment as frights , because the fiat of press - opinion considers they ought to be frights , even if they are not . A pretty authoress is an offence , - an incongruity , - a something that neither men nor women care about . Men do n't care about her , because being clever and independent , she does not often care about them , - women do n't care about her , because she has the effrontery to combine attractive looks with intelligence , and she makes an awkward rival to those who have only attractive looks without intelligence . So wags the world ! -
98333	98340	98341	98341	I	0	" What a voice you have ! "
98344	98350	98341	98341	I	0	" What a glorious gift ! "
98413	98420	98421	98421	I	0	" What strange song is that ? "
98434	98441	98421	98421	I	0	" It seems to mean nothing ! "
98450	98456	98457	98457	he	0	" It does mean nothing ! "
98460	98489	98457	98457	he	0	" All drawing - room songs mean nothing . Mine is a drawing - room song - calculated to waken emotional impulses in the unloved spinster religiously inclined ! "
98490	98493	98494	98494	I	0	" Nonsense ! "
98499	98512	98457	98457	he	0	" Exactly ! That is what I say . It is nonsense ! "
98525	98540	98514	98514	we	1673	" Just twenty minutes to catch the train , Geoffrey ! Off we go ! "
98574	98580	98582	98582	Lucio	124	" You like your purchase ? "
98585	98591	98457	98457	he	0	" I do . Immensely ! "
98592	98605	98582	98582	Lucio	124	" And your rival , Mavis Clare ? Do you like her ? "
98615	98670	98606	98606	I	0	" Yes . I like her . And I will admit something more than that to you now . I like her book . It is a noble work , - worthy of the most highly - gifted man . I always liked it - and because I liked it , I slated it . "
98671	98679	98681	98681	he	124	" Rather a mysterious course of procedure ! "
98684	98690	98681	98681	he	124	" Can you not explain ? "
98691	98698	98700	98700	I	0	" Of course I can explain , "
98703	98760	98700	98700	I	0	" Explanation is easy . I envied her power - I envy it still . Her popularity caused me a smarting sense of injury , and to relieve it I wrote that article against her . But I shall never do anything of the kind again . I shall let her grow her laurels in peace . "
98761	98772	98775	98775	Lucio	124	" Laurels have a habit of growing without any permission , "
98778	98802	98775	98775	Lucio	124	" In all sorts of unexpected places too . And they can never be properly cultivated in the forcing - house of criticism . "
98803	98808	98809	98809	I	0	" I know that ! "
98833	98844	98809	98809	I	0	" I have learned that lesson thoroughly , by heart ! "
98851	98864	98866	98866	he	124	" It is only one of many you may have yet to learn "
98869	98887	98866	98866	he	124	" It is a lesson in fame . Your next course of instruction will be in love ! "
99551	99562	99564	99564	she	166	" You have given me an emblem of the Soul , "
99567	99580	99564	99564	she	166	" No doubt you remembered I have no soul of my own ! "
100260	100295	100249	100249	they	3622	" More , - more of these thoughts which comfort and inspire us ! - which make us hear God 's voice proclaiming ' All 's well ! ' above the storms of life ! "
100855	100863	100865	100865	he	1727	" for , believe me Mr Tempest , "
100867	100962	100865	100865	he	1727	" I should be sorry if you thought , as some of the wealthy are unhappily apt to do , that I seek money simply to apply it to my own personal uses . If you would visit the district yourself , and distribute whatever you pleased with your own hand , it would be infinitely more gratifying to me , and would have a far better effect on the minds of the people . For , sir , the poor will not always be patient under the cruel burdens they have to bear . "
101474	101482	101483	101483	I	0	" Good heavens ! - not possible ! "
101486	101491	101483	101483	I	0	" Can he ride ? "
101492	101498	101501	101502	my friend	427	" Like the very devil ! "
101507	101520	101501	101502	my friend	427	" He will ride ' Phosphor ' to the winning - post . "
102105	102115	102117	102117	he	124	" Nothing English is good enough for the English , "
102120	102344	102117	102117	he	124	" Things have to be imported from France to please the people whom the French themselves angrily designate as ' perfide Albion . ' You must not have a ' Bill of Fare ' ; you must have a ' Menu ' ; and all your dishes must bear French titles , otherwise they will not be in good form . You must have French ' comediennes ' and ' danseuses ' to please the British taste , and your silken draperies must be woven on French looms . Lately too , it has been deemed necessary to import Parisian morality as well as Parisian fashions . It does not suit stalwart Great Britain at all , you know , - stalwart Great Britain , aping the manners of Paris , looks like a jolly open - faced , sturdy - limbed Giant , with a doll 's bonnet stuck on his leonine head . But the doll 's bonnet is just now la mode . Some day I believe the Giant will discover it looks ridiculous , and cast it off with a burst of genuine laughter at his own temporary folly . And without it , he will resume his original dignity ; - the dignity that best becomes a privileged conqueror who has the sea for his standing - army . "
102345	102351	102352	102352	I	0	" Evidently you like England ! "
102359	102456	102356	102356	He	1783	" Not in the very least ! I do not like England any more than any other country on the globe . I do not like the globe itself ; and England comes in for a share of my aversion as one of the spots on the trumpery ball . If I could have my way , I should like to throne myself on a convenient star for the purpose and kick out at Earth as she whirls by in space , hoping by that act of just violence to do away with her for ever ! "
102457	102461	102462	102462	I	0	" But why ? "
102467	102487	102462	102462	I	0	" Why do you hate the Earth ? What has the poor little planet done to merit your abhorrence ? "
102495	102507	102488	102488	He	1783	" Shall I tell you ? You will never believe me ! "
102508	102514	102515	102515	I	0	" No matter for that ! "
102519	102523	102515	102515	I	0	" Say on ! "
102524	102533	102534	102534	he	1783	" What has the poor little planet done ? "
102538	102862	102534	102534	he	1783	" The poor little planet has done - nothing . But it is what the gods have done with this same poor little planet , that awakens my anger and scorn . They have made it a living sphere of wonders , - endowed it with beauty borrowed from the fairest corners of highest Heaven , - decked it with flowers and foliage , - taught it music , - the music of birds and torrents and rolling waves and falling rains , - rocked it gently in clear ether , among such light as blinds the eyes of mortals , - guided it out of chaos , through clouds of thunder and barbëd shafts of lightning , to circle peacefully in its appointed orbit , lit on the one hand by the vivid splendours of the sun , and on the other by the sleepy radiance of the moon ; - and more than all this , they have invested it with a Divine Soul in man ! Oh , you may disbelieve as you will , - but notwithstanding the pigmy peeps earth takes at the vast and eternal ocean of Science , the Soul is here , and all the immortal forces with it and around it ! Nay , the gods - I speak in the plural , after the fashion of the ancient Greeks - for to my thinking there are many gods emanating from the Supreme Deity , - the gods , I say , have so insisted on this fact , that One of them has walked the earth in human guise , solely for the sake of emphasizing the truth of Immortality to these frail creatures of seemingly perishable clay ! For this I hate the planet ; - were there not , and are there not , other and far grander worlds that a God should have chosen to dwell on than this one ! "
102875	102880	102881	102881	I	0	" You amaze me ! "
102886	102941	102881	102881	I	0	" You allude to Christ , I suppose ; but everybody is convinced by this time that He was a mere man like the rest of us ; there was nothing divine about Him . What a contradiction you are ! Why , I remember you indignantly denied the accusation of being a Christian . "
102942	102952	102954	102954	he	1784	" Of course , - and I deny it still "
102958	103043	102954	102954	he	1784	" I have not a fat living in the church that I should tell a lie on such a subject . I am not a Christian ; nor is anyone living a Christian . To quote a very old saying ' There never was a Christian save One , and He was crucified . ' But though I am not a Christian I never said I doubted the existence of Christ . That knowledge was forced upon me , - with considerable pressure too ! "
103044	103050	103051	103051	I	0	" By a reliable authority ? "
103135	103144	103146	103146	he	1784	" You touch me on a sore point , "
103159	103228	103146	103146	he	1784	" My convictions respecting certain religious phases of man 's development and progress , are founded on the arduous study of some very unpleasant truths to which humanity generally shuts its eyes , burying its head in the desert - sands of its own delusions . These truths I will not enter upon now . Some other time I will initiate you into a few of my mysteries . "
103788	103792	103794	103794	Lucio	124	" I think , "
103801	103853	103794	103794	Lucio	124	" You will find everything as complete as this world 's resources will allow . The retinue of servants here are what is vulgarly called ' on the job ' ; their payment is agreed upon , and they know their duties thoroughly , - they will give you no trouble . "
103949	103966	103941	103941	Shakespeare	163	" All the world 's a stage , And all the men and women merely players . "
104020	104042	104044	104044	he	124	" I have arranged for a few ' tableaux vivants ' in the theatre to fill up a gap of time ; "
104048	104151	104044	104044	he	124	" Fashionable folks now - a - days get so soon tired of one amusement that it is necessary to provide several in order to distract the brains that can not think , or discover any means of entertainment in themselves . As a matter of fact , people can not even converse long together because they have nothing to say . Oh , do n't bother to go out in the grounds on a tour of inspection just now , - leave a few surprises for yourself as well as for your company to - morrow . Come and have dinner ! "
104237	104248	104250	104250	I	0	" You seem to do everything by magic , Lucio ; "
104258	104268	104250	104250	I	0	" All these lavish decorations , - these servants - "
104269	104280	104282	104282	he	124	" Money , my dear fellow , - nothing but money "
104288	104331	104282	104282	he	124	" Money , the devil 's pass - key ! you can have the retinue of a king without any of a king 's responsibilities , if you only choose to pay for it . It is merely a question of cost . "
104332	104336	104337	104337	I	0	" And taste ! "
104341	104467	104282	104282	he	124	" True , - and taste . Some rich men there are who have less taste than a costermonger . I know one who has the egregious vulgarity to call the attention of his guests to the value of his goods and chattels . He pointed out for my admiration one day , an antique and hideous china plate , the only one of that kind in the world , and told me it was worth a thousand guineas . ' Break it , ' - I said coolly - ' You will then have the satisfaction of knowing you have destroyed a thousand guineas ' worth of undesirable ugliness . ' You should have seen his face ! He showed me no more curios ! "
104512	104519	104520	104520	he	531	" I was just then thinking , "
104523	104552	104520	104520	he	531	" what you would have done with your life if you had not inherited this fortune , and if , - if I had not come your way ? "
104553	104562	104564	104564	I	0	" I should have starved , no doubt , "
104567	104582	104564	104564	I	0	" Died like a rat in a hole , - of want and wretchedness . "
104583	104589	104590	104590	he	531	" I rather doubt that ; "
104594	104607	104590	104590	he	531	" It is just possible you might have become a great writer . "
104608	104616	104617	104617	I	0	" Why do you say that now ? "
104620	104781	104564	104564	I	0	" Because I have been reading your book . There are fine ideas in it , - ideas that might , had they been the result of sincere conviction , have reached the public in time , because they were sane and healthy . The public will never put up for long with corrupt ' fads ' and artificial ' crazes . ' Now you write of God , - yet according to your own statement , you did not believe in God even when you wrote the words that imply His existence , - and that was long before I met you . Therefore the book was not the result of sincere conviction , and that 's the key - note of your failure to reach the large audience you desired . Each reader can see you do not believe what you write , - the trumpet of lasting fame never sounds triumph for an author of that calibre . "
104782	104795	104796	104796	I	0	" Do n't let us talk about it for Heaven 's sake ! "
104800	104850	104796	104796	I	0	" I know my work lacks something , - and that something may be what you say or it may not , - I do not want to think about it . Let it perish , as it assuredly will ; perhaps in the future I may do better . "
104877	104883	104884	104884	he	1825	" I must turn in , "
104889	104928	104884	104884	he	1825	" I have a few more directions to give to the servants for to - morrow . I shall go to my room as soon as I have done , - so I 'll say good - night . "
104929	104940	104942	104942	I	0	" But surely you are taking too much personal trouble , "
104945	104954	104942	104942	I	0	" Ca n't I help in any way ? "
104955	104962	104964	104964	he	1825	" No , you ca n't , "
104968	104997	104964	104964	he	1825	" When I undertake to do anything I like to do it in my own fashion , or not at all . Sleep well , and rise early . "
105662	105668	105669	105669	I	0	" Has the prince retired ? "
105673	105678	105693	105693	Amiel	141	" Yes , sir . "
105679	105692	105693	105693	Amiel	141	" He has a red lamp in his window has he not ? "
105706	105721	105703	105703	him	141	" I think - - yes , - I believe he has , sir . "
105740	105746	105747	105747	he	141	" Good - night sir ! "
105763	105768	105769	105769	I	0	" Good - night ! "
106137	106140	106142	106142	I	0	" Yes , "
106148	106279	106142	106142	I	0	" Say what philosophers will , the possession of money does insure satisfaction and power . It is all very well to talk about fame , but what is fame worth , if , like Carlyle , one is too poor to enjoy it ! Besides , literature no longer holds its former high prestige , - there are too many in the field , - too many newspaper - scribblers , all believing they are geniuses , - too many ill - educated lady - paragraphists and ' new ' women , who think they are as gifted as Georges Sand or Mavis Clare . With Sibyl and Willowsmere , I ought to be able to resign the idea of fame - literary fame - with a good grace . "
106431	106439	106440	106440	he	124	" Not a cloud on the day ! "
106465	106476	106440	106440	he	124	" The fête will be a brilliant success , Geoffrey . "
106477	106482	106483	106483	I	0	" Thanks to you ! "
106486	106513	106483	106483	I	0	" Personally I am quite in the dark as to your plans , - but I believe you can do nothing that is not well done . "
106514	106519	106520	106520	he	124	" You honour me ! "
106527	106582	106520	106520	he	124	" You credit me then with better qualities than the Creator ! For what He does , in the opinion of the present generation , is exceedingly ill done ! Men have taken to grumbling at Him instead of praising Him , - and few have any patience with or liking for His laws . "
106586	106598	106583	106583	I	0	" Well , you must admit those laws are very arbitrary ! "
106599	106609	106483	106483	I	0	" They are . I entirely acknowledge the fact ! "
106695	106702	106704	106704	he	124	" About noon I should say , "
106707	106758	106704	106704	he	124	" Perhaps before . But whatever their hour , they will all be in their places at the proper moment , depend upon it . The people I employ - both musicians and ' artistes ' - know their business thoroughly , and are aware that I stand no nonsense . "
106772	106848	106765	106765	his	124	" None of your guests can arrive here till one o'clock , - as that is about the time the special train will bring the first batch of them from London , - and the first ' déjeuner ' will be served in the gardens at two . If you want to amuse yourself there 's a Maypole being put up on the large lawn , - you 'd better go and look at it . "
106849	106853	106854	106854	I	0	" A Maypole ! "
106857	106865	106854	106854	I	0	" Now that 's a good idea ! "
106866	106875	106877	106877	he	124	" It used to be a good idea , "
106880	107011	106877	106877	he	124	" When English lads and lasses had youth , innocence , health and fun in their composition , a dance round the Maypole hand in hand , did them good and did nobody harm . But now there are no lads and lasses , - enervated old men and women in their teens walk the world wearily , speculating on the uses of life , - probing vice , and sneering down sentiment , and such innocent diversions as the Maypole no longer appeal to our jaded youth . So we have to get ' professionals ' to execute the May - revels , - of course the dancing is better done by properly trained legs ; but it means nothing , and is nothing , except a pretty spectacle . "
107012	107019	107020	107020	I	0	" And are the dancers here ? "
107033	107070	107073	107073	his	1874	" No , not yet . But the May - pole is ; - fully decorated . It faces the woods at the back of the house , - go and see if you like it . "
107527	107538	107539	107539	I	0	" Welcome back to your old home , my Sibyl ! "
107690	107698	107699	107699	she	166	" How charming of you , Geoffrey ! "
107702	107715	107699	107699	she	166	" What a poet you are to devise so pretty a greeting ! "
107716	107724	107725	107725	I	0	" I wish I deserved your praise ! "
107732	107756	107725	107725	I	0	" But the poet in question is Prince Rimânez , - he is the master and ruler of to - day 's revels . "
109325	109334	109335	109335	she	166	" Oh , it is lovely - lovely ! "
109338	109346	109335	109335	she	166	" Is this the prince 's idea ? "
109358	109373	109355	109355	she	166	" Where , I wonder , did he find such exquisitely pretty little children ! "
109489	109497	109502	109502	her	166	" Oh do call them back again ! "
109511	109526	109502	109502	her	166	" I should so like to speak to two or three of the prettiest ! "
109537	109549	109550	109550	he	124	" You would do them too much honour , Lady Sibyl , "
109553	109589	109550	109550	he	124	" They are not accustomed to such condescension from great ladies and would not appreciate it . They are paid professionals , and , like many of their class , only become insolent when praised . "
109603	109611	109612	109612	she	173	" I ca n't see them anywhere ! "
109616	109668	109612	109612	she	173	" The dear little darlings ! I ran after them as fast as I could ; I wanted to kiss one of those perfectly scrumptious boys , but they 're gone ! - not a trace of them left ! It 's just as if they had sunk into the ground ! "
109673	109680	109681	109681	he	124	" They have their orders , - "
109685	109692	109681	109681	he	124	" And they know their place . "

109939	109943	109945	109945	I	0	" You do ! "
109955	109962	109945	109945	I	0	" And how did you learn ? "
109985	109989	109990	109990	she	166	" Very strangely ! "
109993	110013	110015	110015	she	166	" And - quite suddenly ! The lesson was easy , I found ; - too easy ! Geoffrey , "
110026	110046	110015	110015	she	166	" I will tell you how I learnt it , ... but not now , ... some other day . "

I was quite as happy , and I think as innocent as these blossoms ; I had no thought of evil in my nature , - and the only love I dreamed of was the love of the fairy prince for the fairy princess , - as harmless an idea as the loves of the flowers themselves . Yes ! - I was then all I should like to be now , - all that I am not ! "

111009	111045	111046	111046	I	0	" I think he likes her more than he does most women ! He showed the most extraordinary deference towards her , and seemed almost abashed in her presence . Are you cold , Sibyl ? "

117080	117187	117189	117189	he	124	" The body is our chief care , - we cosset it , and make much of it , feed it and pamper it , and guard it from so much as a pin - prick of pain if we can , - and thus we flatter ourselves that all is well , - all must be well ! Yet it is but a clay chrysalis , bound to split and crumble with the growth of the moth - soul within , - the moth that flies with blind instinctiveness straight into the Unknown , and is dazzled by excess of light !

The flowers are asleep , - the trees are surely glad to be disburdened of all the gaudy artificial lamps that lately hung upon their branches , - there is the young moon pillowing her chin on the edge of a little cloud and sinking to sleep in the west , - a moment ago there was a late nightingale awake and singing . You can feel the breath of the roses from the trellis yonder ! All this is Nature 's work , - and how much fairer and sweeter it is now than when the lights were ablaze and the blare of band - music startled the small birds in their downy nests ! - Yet ' society ' would not appreciate this cool dusk , this happy solitude ; - ' society ' prefers a false glare to all true radiance .

117738	117755	117758	117758	Lucio	124	" Well , if you elect to call money devil 's magic , you are right , "
117760	117776	117779	117779	I	0	" But surely in some cases , not even money could procure such perfection of detail "

117804	117928	117790	117790	he	124	" I told you that long ago . It is a hook for the devil himself . Not that the devil could be supposed to care about world 's cash personally , - but he generally conceives a liking for the company of the man who possesses it ; - possibly he knows what that man will do with it . I speak metaphorically of course , - but no metaphor can exaggerate the power of money . Trust no man or woman 's virtue till you have tried to purchase it with a round sum in hard cash ! Money , my excellent Geoffrey , has done everything for you , - remember that ! - you have done nothing for yourself . "

117946	118002	118004	118004	he	2160	" No ? And why ? Because it 's true ? I notice most people complain of ' unkindness ' when they are told a truth . It is true , and I see no unkindness in it . You 've done nothing for yourself and you 're not expected to do anything - except , "

118321	118394	118402	118402	his	2160	" Why ? Because life hangs on a thread , - a society crush is the very acme of boredom and exhaustion , - and that we escape with our lives from a general guzzle and giggle is matter for thanksgiving , - that 's all !

119302	119348	119293	119293	I	0	" Give it way ? What do you mean ? Would you have me tell humbugs that I know them as such ? , - and liars that I discern their lies ? My dear fellow , society would become too hot to hold me ! "
119349	119373	119375	119375	he	124	" It could not be hotter - or colder - than hell , if you believed in hell , which you do not , "
119384	119427	119375	119375	he	124	" But I did not assume that you should say these things straight out and bluntly , to give offence . An affronting candour is not nobleness , - it is merely coarse . To act nobly is better than to speak . "
119428	119437	119438	119438	I	0	" And what would you have me do ? "
119465	119699	119461	119461	he	124	" My advice will seem to you singular , Geoffrey , - but if you want it , here it is . Give , as I said , the noble , and what the world would call the quixotic part of your nature full way , - do not sacrifice your higher sense of what is right and just for the sake of pandering to anyone 's power or influence , - and - say farewell to me ! I am no use to you , save to humour your varying fancies , and introduce you to those great , - or small , - personages you wish to know for your own convenience or advantage , - believe me , it would be much better for you and much more consoling at the inevitable hour of death , if you were to let all this false and frivolous nonsense go , and me with it ! Leave society to its own fool 's whirligig of distracted follies , - put Royalty in its true place , and show it that all its pomp , arrogance and glitter are worthless , and itself a nothing , compared to the upright standing of a brave soul in an honest man , - and , as Christ said to the rich ruler - ' Sell half that thou hast and give to the poor . ' "
119940	120058	119937	119937	I	0	" Your advice , my dear fellow , would do credit to a Salvationist preacher , - but it is quite valueless to me , because impossible to follow . To say farewell for ever to you , in the first place , would be to make myself guilty of the blackest ingratitude , - in the second instance , society , with all its ridiculous humbug , is nevertheless necessary for the amusement of myself and my future wife , - Royalty moreover , is accustomed to be flattered , and we shall not be hurt by joining in the general inane chorus ; - thirdly , if I did as the visionary Jew suggested - - "

120183	120197	120092	120092	his	124	" Naturally ! Most people like a little gratitude in return for benefits . "
120198	120218	120220	120220	he	124	" They do . And the Creator , who is always giving , is supposed to like gratitude also , "

If one gives largely , one expects to be acknowledged as generous , - but if I were to divide my fortune , and hand half of it to the poor , the matter would be chronicled in about six lines in one of the papers , and society would exclaim ' What a fool !

Did I not tell you I would set you up as successfully as the bear who has reached the bun on the top of the slippery pole , a spectacle for the envy of men and the wonder of angels ? Well , there you are ! - triumphant ! - a great creature Geoffrey ! - in fact , you are the greatest product of the age , a man with five millions and owner of the Derby - winner ! What is the glory of intellect compared to such a position as yours ! Men envy you , - and as for angels , - if there are any , - you may be sure they do wonder !

121846	121863	121864	121864	I	0	" Yes , - and you will be the most eagerly desired guest of all invited ! "
121872	121878	121879	121879	he	124	" Fie , for shame ! "
121883	121978	121879	121879	he	124	" Be not so disloyal of speech , Geoffrey ! Are you not going to entertain the Prince of Wales ? - and shall anyone be more ' eagerly - desired ' than he ? No , - I must play a humble third or even fourth on your list where Royalty is concerned , - my princedom is alas ! not that of Wales , - and the throne I might claim if I had anyone to help me , which I have not is a long way removed from that of England ! "
122008	122015	122016	122016	he	124	" Good - bye Lady Sibyl ! "
122020	122125	122016	122016	he	124	" All joy be with you ! To us who are left behind , your absence will seem long , - but to you , - ah ! - Love gives wings to time , and what would be to ordinary folks a month of mere dull living , will be for you nothing but a moment 's rapture ! Love is better than wealth , - you have found that out already I know ! - but I think - and hope - that you are destined to make the knowledge more certain and complete ! Think of me sometimes ! Au revoir ! "
123009	123030	123003	123003	she	2267	" I am a contaminated creature , trained to perfection in the lax morals and prurient literature of my day . "
123574	123606	123554	123554	He	4230	" As you are a bride and are travelling abroad , I should advise you by no means to go into mourning . Under the circumstances it is really not necessary . "
123685	123695	123681	123681	She	166	" What a good thing her sufferings are over ! "
123708	123722	123704	123704	she	166	" I wonder when we shall receive the Elton - Chesney wedding cards ! "
124011	124024	123983	123996	some pure , true - hearted woman whose white soul , like an angel	2297	" Do what you will with it , - it is yours ! "
124852	124863	124864	124864	she	166	" How violent you are to - day , Geoffrey ! "
124960	124965	124966	124966	I	0	" I am sorry ! "
124974	124988	124966	124966	I	0	" But I hate to see you with such a book as that ! "
124989	124995	124996	124996	she	166	" You know its contents ? "
125005	125010	124971	124971	her	166	" I can guess . "
125011	125023	125025	125025	she	166	" Such things have to be written , they say nowadays , "
125029	125094	125095	125095	She	166	" And , certainly , to judge from the commendation bestowed on these sort of books by the press , it is very evident that the wave of opinion is setting in the direction of letting girls know all about marriage before they enter upon it , in order that they may do so with their eyes wide open , - very wide open ! "
125108	125130	125131	125131	she	166	" What an old - fashioned idea the bride of the poets and sixty - years - ago romancists seems now ! "
125134	125240	125131	125131	she	166	" Imagine her ! - a shrinking tender creature , shy of beholders , timid of speech , ... wearing the emblematic veil , which in former days , you know , used to cover the face entirely , as a symbol that the secrets of marriage were as yet hidden from the maiden 's innocent and ignorant eyes . Now the veil is worn flung back from the bride 's brows , and she stares unabashed at everybody , - oh yes , indeed we know quite well what we are doing now when we marry , thanks to the ' new ' fiction ! "
125241	125248	125250	125250	I	0	" The new fiction is detestable , "
125254	125309	125250	125250	I	0	" Both in style and morality . Even as a question of literature I wonder at your condescending to read any of it . The woman whose dirty book I have just thrown away - and I feel no compunction for having done it , - is destitute of grammar as well as decency . "
125310	125321	125323	125323	she	166	" Oh , but the critics do n't notice that , "
125335	125422	125323	125323	she	166	" It is apparently not their business to assist in preserving the purity of the English language . What they fall into raptures over is the originality of the ' sexual ' theme , though I should have thought all such matters were as old as the hills . I never read reviews as a rule , but I did happen to come across one on the book you have just drowned , - and in it , the reviewer stated he had cried over it ! "
125427	125430	125431	125431	I	0	" Beast ! "
125435	125469	125431	125431	I	0	" He probably found in it some glozing - over of his own vices . But you , Sibyl - why do you read such stuff ? - how can you read it ? "
125470	125479	125481	125481	she	166	" Curiosity moved me in the first place , "
125485	125627	125481	125481	she	166	" I wanted to see what makes a reviewer cry ! Then when I began to read , I found that the story was all about the manner in which men amuse themselves with the soiled doves of the highways and bye - ways , - and as I was not very well instructed in that sort of thing , I thought I might as well learn ! You know these unpleasant morsels of information on unsavoury subjects are like the reputed suggestions of the devil , - if you listen to one , you are bound to hear more . Besides , literature is supposed to reflect the time we live in , - and that kind of literature being more prevalent than anything else , we are compelled to accept and study it as the mirror of the age . "
125658	125667	125668	125668	she	166	" The fishes will eat that book , - "
125671	125699	125668	125668	she	166	" I hope it will not poison them ! If they could read and understand it , what singular ideas they would have of us human beings ! "
125700	125711	125712	125712	I	0	" Why do n't you read Mavis Clare 's books ? "
125716	125724	125712	125712	I	0	" You told me you admired her . "
125725	125733	125734	125734	she	166	" So I do , - immensely ! "
125738	125883	125734	125734	she	166	" I admire her and wonder at her , both together . How that woman can keep her child 's heart and child 's faith in a world like this , is more than I can understand . It is always a perfect marvel to me , - a sort of supernatural surprise . You ask me why do n't I read her books , - I do read them , - I 've read them all over and over again , - but she does not write many , and one has to wait for her productions longer than for those of most authors . When I want to feel like an angel , I read Mavis Clare , - but I more often am inclined to feel the other way , and then her books are merely so many worries to me . "
125884	125887	125888	125888	I	0	" Worries ? "
125891	125980	125734	125734	she	166	" Yes . It is worrying to find somebody believing in a God when you ca n't believe in Him , - to have beautiful faiths offered to you which you ca n't grasp , - and to know that there is a creature alive , a woman like yourself in everything except mind , who is holding fast a happiness which you can never attain , - no , not though you held out praying hands day and night and shouted wild appeals to the dull heavens ! "
126098	126102	126103	126103	she	2332	" Poor Geoffrey ! "
126116	126360	126103	126103	she	2332	" I am sorry for you ! With all my vagaries of disposition I am not a fool , and at anyrate I have learned how to analyse myself as well as others . I read you as easily as I read a book , - I see what a strange tumult your mind is in ! You love me - and you loathe me ! - and the contrast of emotion makes a wreck of you and your ideals . Hush , - do n't speak ; I know , - I know ! But what would you have me be ? An angel ? I can not realize such a being for more than a fleeting moment of imagination . A saint ? They were all martyred . A good woman ? I never met one . Innocent ? - ignorant ? I told you before we married that I was neither ; there is nothing left for me to discover as far as the relations between men and women are concerned , - I have taken the measure of the inherent love of vice in both sexes . There is not a pin to choose between them , - men are no worse than women , - women no worse than men . I have discovered everything - except God ! - and I conclude no God could ever have designed such a crazy and mean business as human life . "
126464	126467	126468	126468	I	0	" Sibyl ! "
126471	126548	126468	126468	I	0	" Sibyl , what is wrong with us both ? How is it that we do not seem to find the loveliest side of love ? - why is it that even in our kisses and embraces , some impalpable darkness comes between us , so that we anger or weary each other when we should be glad and satisfied ? What is it ? Can you tell ? For you know the darkness is there ! "
126579	126586	126587	126587	she	2339	" Yes , it is there ! "
126591	126714	126587	126587	she	2339	" And it is of our own mutual creation . I believe you have something nobler in your nature , Geoffrey , than I have in mine , - an indefinable something that recoils from me and my theories despite your wish and will . Perhaps if you had given way to that feeling in time , you would never have married me . You speak of the loveliest side of love , - to me there is no lovely side , - it is all coarse and horrible ! You and I for instance , - cultured man and woman , - we can not , in marriage , get a flight beyond the common emotions of Hodge and his girl ! "
126725	126817	126715	126715	She	2342	" What liars the poets are , Geoffrey ! They ought to be sentenced to life - long imprisonment for their perjuries ! They help to mould the credulous beliefs of a woman 's heart ; - in her early youth she reads their delicious assurances , and imagines that love will be all they teach , - a thing divine and lasting beyond earthly countings ; - then comes the coarse finger of prose on the butterfly - wing of poesy , and the bitterness and hideousness of complete disillusion ! "
126844	126860	126861	126861	I	0	" But I love you Sibyl ! - - my wife , I love you ! "
126872	126895	126896	126896	she	2342	" You love me , - yes , I know , but how ? In a way that is abhorrent to yourself ! "
126899	126994	126896	126896	she	2342	" It is not poetic love , - it is man 's love , and man 's love is brute love . So it is , - so it will be , - so it must be . Moreover the brute - love soon tires , - and when it dies out from satiety there is nothing left . Nothing , Geoffrey , - absolutely nothing but a blank and civil form of intercourse , which I do not doubt we shall be able to keep up for the admiration and comment of society ! "
127008	127011	127012	127012	she	2342	" Come ! "
127033	127139	127012	127012	she	2342	" You know there is a famous lady in London who advertises her saleable charms to the outside public by means of her monogram worked into the lace of all her window - blinds , thinking it no doubt good for trade ! I am not quite so bad as that ! You have paid dearly for me I know ; - but remember I as yet wear no jewels but yours , and crave no gifts beyond those you are generous enough to bestow , - and my dutiful desire is to give you as much full value as I can for your money . "
127140	127147	127148	127148	I	0	" Sibyl , you kill me ! "
127155	127164	127148	127148	I	0	" Do you think me so base - - "
127175	127183	127184	127184	she	2345	" You can not help being base , "
127192	127453	127184	127184	she	2345	" because you are a man . I am base because I am a woman . If we believed in a God , either of us , we might discover some different way of life and love - who knows ? - but neither you nor I have any remnant of faith in a Being whose existence all the scientists of the day are ever at work to disprove . We are persistently taught that we are animals and nothing more , - let us therefore not be ashamed of animalism . Animalism and atheism are approved by the scientists and applauded by the press , - and the clergy are powerless to enforce the faith they preach . Come Geoffrey , do n't stay mooning like a stricken Parsifal under those pines , - throw away that thing which troubles you , your conscience , - throw it away as you have thrown the book I was lately reading , and consider this , - that most men of your type take pride and rejoice in being the prey of a bad woman ! - so you should really congratulate yourself on having one for a wife ! - one who is so broad - minded too , that she will always let you have your own way in everything you do , provided you let her have hers ! It is the way all marriages are arranged nowadays , - at any rate in our set , - otherwise the tie would be impossible of endurance . Come ! "
127454	127467	127468	127468	I	0	" We can not live together on such an understanding , Sibyl ! "
127483	127490	127491	127491	she	2346	" Oh yes , we can ! "
127503	127606	127491	127491	she	2346	" We can do as others do , - there is no necessity for us to stand out from the rest like quixotic fools , and pose as models to other married people , - we should only be detested for our pains . It is surely better to be popular than virtuous , - virtue never pays ! See , there is our interesting German waiter coming to inform us that dinner is ready ; please do n't look so utterly miserable , for we have not quarrelled , and it would be foolish to let the servants think we have . "
128396	128404	128410	128410	she	4266	" What a pretty place it is ! "
128426	128442	128410	128410	she	4266	" I really think it is prettier than Willowsmere . It has been wonderfully improved . "
128696	128707	128708	128708	she	200	" To think that you are the famous Mavis Clare ! "
128720	128751	128714	128714	she	200	" I always heard and knew that you did not look at all literary , but I never quite realized that you could be exactly what I see you are ! "
128752	128765	128767	128767	Mavis	200	" To look literary does not always imply that you are literary ! "
128773	128831	128767	128767	Mavis	200	" Too often I am afraid you will find that the women who take pains to look literary are ignorant of literature ! But how glad I am to see you , Lady Sibyl ! Do you know I used to watch you playing about on the lawns at Willowsmere when I was quite a little girl ? "
128832	128840	128843	128843	Sibyl	166	" And I used to watch you , "
128845	128892	128843	128843	Sibyl	166	" You used to make daisy - chains and cowslip - balls in the fields opposite on the other side of the Avon . It is a great pleasure to me to know we are neighbours . You must come and see me often at Willowsmere . "
128941	128970	128915	128915	Sibyl	166	" You will come , will you not ? As often as you like , - the oftener the better . We must be friends , you know ! "
128984	128991	128992	128992	she	200	" Do you really mean it ? "
128995	128999	129001	129001	Sibyl	166	" Mean it ! "
129003	129011	129001	129001	Sibyl	166	" Why , of course I do ! "
129012	129019	129020	129020	I	0	" How can you doubt it ! "
129023	129036	129039	129039	Mavis	200	" Well , you must both forgive me for asking such a question "
129043	129070	129039	129039	Mavis	200	" But you see you are now among what are called the ' county magnates , ' and county magnates consider themselves infinitely above all authors ! "
129083	129181	129076	129076	her	200	" I think many of them estimate writers of books as some sort of strange outgrowth of humanity that is barely decent . It is deliciously funny and always amuses me , - nevertheless , among my many faults , the biggest one is , I fancy , pride , and a dreadfully obstinate spirit of independence . Now , to tell you the truth , I have been asked by many so - called ' great ' people to their houses , and when I have gone , I have generally been sorry for it afterwards . "
129182	129185	129186	129186	I	0	" Why ? "
129189	129197	129186	129186	I	0	" They honour themselves by inviting you . "
129198	129214	129215	129215	she	200	" Oh , I do n't think they take it in that way at all ! "
129224	129278	129219	129219	her	200	" They fancy they have performed a great act of condescension , - whereas it is really I who condescend , for it is very good of me , you know , to leave the society of the Pallas Athene in my study for that of a flounced and frizzled lady of fashion ! "
129291	129309	129287	129287	she	200	" Once I was asked to luncheon with a certain baron and baroness who invited a few guests "
129314	129488	129287	129287	she	200	" so they said . I was not introduced to more than one or two of these people , - the rest sat and stared at me as if I were a new kind of fish or fowl . Then the baron showed me his house , and told me the prices of his pictures and his china , - he was even good enough to explain which was Dresden and which was Delft ware , though I believe , benighted author as I am , I could have instructed him equally on these , and other matters . However I managed to smile amicably through the whole programme , and professed myself charmed and delighted in the usual way ; - but they never asked me to visit them again , - and , unless indeed they wanted me to be impressed with their furniture - catalogue I can never make out what I did to be asked at all , and what I have done never to be asked any more ! "
129489	129496	129499	129499	Sibyl	166	" They must have been parvenus , "
129502	129523	129499	129499	Sibyl	166	" No well - bred people would have priced their goods to you , unless they happened to be Jews . "
129542	129853	129539	129539	she	200	" Well , I will not say who they were , - I must keep something for my ' literary reminiscences ' when I get old ! Then all these people will be named , and go down to posterity as Dante 's enemies went down to Dante 's hell ! I have only told you the incident just to show you why I asked you if you meant it , when you invited me to visit you at Willowsmere . Because the baron and baroness I have spoken of ' gushed ' over me and my poor books to such an extent that you would have fancied I was to be for evermore one of their dearest friends , - and they did n't mean it ! Other people I know embrace me effusively and invite me to their houses , and they do n't mean it ! And when I find out these shams , I like to make it very clear on my own side that I do not seek to be embraced or invited , and that if certain great folks deem it a ' favour ' to ask me to their houses , I do not so consider it , but rather think the ' favour ' is entirely on my part if I accept the invitation . And I do not say this for my own self at all , - self has nothing to do with it , - but I do say it and strongly assert it for the sake of the dignity of Literature as an art and profession . If a few other authors would maintain this position , we might raise the standard of letters by degrees to what it was in the old days of Scott and Byron . I hope you do not think me too proud ? "
129854	129865	129868	129868	Sibyl	166	" On the contrary , I think you are quite right "
129871	129947	129868	129868	Sibyl	166	" And I admire you for your courage and independence . Some of the aristocracy are , I know , such utter snobs that often I feel ashamed to belong to them . But as far as we are concerned , I can only assure you that if you will honour us by becoming our friend as well as neighbour , you shall not regret it . Do try and like me if you can ! "
129968	129974	129975	129975	she	200	" How beautiful you are ! "
129979	130062	129975	129975	she	200	" Everybody tells you this of course , - still , I can not help joining in the general chorus . To me , a lovely face is like a lovely flower , - I must admire it . Beauty is quite a divine thing , and though I am often told that the plain people are always the good people , I never can quite believe it . Nature is surely bound to give a beautiful face to a beautiful spirit . "
130095	130102	130104	130104	she	200	" Not always , Miss Clare , "
130119	130133	130104	130104	she	200	" One can imagine a fair fiend as easily as a fair angel . "
130134	130137	130139	130139	Mavis	200	" True ! "
130158	130286	130155	130155	she	200	" Quite true ! Really I can not picture an ugly fiend , - for the fiends are supposed to be immortal , and I am convinced that immortal ugliness has no part in the universe . Downright hideousness belongs to humanity alone , - and an ugly face is such a blot on creation that we can only console ourselves by the reflection that it is fortunately perishable , and that in course of time the soul behind it will be released from its ill - formed husk , and will be allowed to wear a fairer aspect . Yes , Lady Sibyl , I will come to Willowsmere ; I can not refuse to look upon such loveliness as yours as often as I may ! "
130287	130294	130296	130296	Sibyl	166	" You are a charming flatterer ! "
130324	130430	130311	130311	hers	166	" But I confess I prefer to be flattered by a woman rather than by a man . Men say the same things to all women , - they have a very limited répertoire of compliments , - and they will tell a fright she is beautiful , if it happens to serve their immediate purpose . But women themselves can so hardly be persuaded to admit that any good qualities exist either inwardly or outwardly in one another , that when they do say a kind or generous thing of their own sex it is a wonder worth remembering . May I your study ? "
130528	130543	130524	130524	Mavis	200	" Where is the friend who came with you here first , Prince Rimânez ? "
130544	130553	130555	130555	I	0	" He is in St Petersburg just now , "
130558	130579	130555	130555	I	0	" But we expect him in two or three weeks to stay with us on a visit for some time . "
130580	130589	130592	130592	Mavis	200	" He is surely a very singular man , "
130595	130623	130592	130592	Mavis	200	" Do you remember how strangely my dogs behaved to him ? Emperor was quite restless and troublesome for two or three hours after he had gone . "
130644	130654	130657	130657	Sibyl	166	" Some people have a natural antipathy to dogs , "
130663	130694	130657	130657	Sibyl	166	" And the dogs always find it out , and resent it . But I should not have thought Prince Rimânez had an antipathy to any creatures except - women ! "
130703	130707	130709	130709	Mavis	200	" Except women ! "
130712	130738	130709	130709	Mavis	200	" Does he hate women ? He must be a very good actor then , - for to me he was wonderfully kind and gentle . "
130756	130818	130753	130753	she	200	" Perhaps it is because he knows you are unlike the ordinary run of women and have nothing in common with their usual trumpery aims . Of course he is always courteous to our sex , - but I think it is easy to see that his courtesy is often worn as a mere mask to cover a very different feeling . "
130819	130829	130830	130830	I	0	" You have perceived that , then , Sibyl ? "
130837	130848	130850	130850	she	200	" I should be blind if I had not perceived it "
130853	130878	130850	130850	she	200	" I do not however blame him for his pet aversion , - I think it makes him all the more attractive and interesting . "
130879	130888	130890	130890	Mavis	200	" He is a great friend of yours ? "
130901	130909	130911	130911	I	0	" The very greatest friend I have , "
130915	130941	130911	130911	I	0	" I owe him more than I can ever repay , - indeed I have to thank him even for introducing me to my wife ! "
131448	131455	131475	131475	Mavis	200	" Now is the acceptable time ! "
131637	131650	131651	131651	she	166	" Miss Clare has very strong opinions of her own , Geoffrey , "
131654	131687	131651	131651	she	166	" She is not as much captivated by Prince Rimânez as most people are , - in fact , she has just confided to me that she does not quite like him . "
131700	131714	131715	131715	she	200	" It is wrong to say what one thinks , I know , - "
131722	131795	131715	131715	she	200	" And it is a dreadful fault of mine . Please forgive me Mr Tempest ! You tell me the prince is your greatest friend , - and I assure you I was immensely impressed by his appearance when I first saw him , ... but afterwards , ... after I had studied him a little , the conviction was borne in upon me that he was not altogether what he seemed . "
131796	131806	131808	131808	I	0	" That is exactly what he says of himself , "
131815	131856	131808	131808	I	0	" He has a mystery I believe , - and he has promised to clear it up for me some day . But I 'm sorry you do n't like him , Miss Clare , - for he likes you . "
131857	131869	131872	131872	Mavis	200	" Perhaps when I meet him again my ideas may be different "
131875	131941	131872	131872	Mavis	200	" at present , ... well , - do not let us talk of it any more , - indeed I feel I have been very rude to express any opinion at all concerning one for whom you and Lady Sibyl have so great a regard . But somehow I seemed impelled , almost against my will , to say what I did just now . "
131968	131972	131974	131974	she	200	" Oh yes , "
131977	132020	131974	131974	she	200	" It would never do for me to be idle . The public are very kind to me , - and no sooner have they read one thing of mine than they clamour for another , so I am kept very busy . "
132021	132028	132029	132029	I	0	" And what of the critics ? "
132042	132052	132053	132053	she	200	" I never pay the least attention to them , "
132056	132264	132053	132053	she	200	" except when they are hasty and misguided enough to write lies about me , - then I very naturally take the liberty to contradict those lies , either through my own statement or that of my lawyers . Apart from refusing to allow the public to be led into a false notion of my work and aims , I have no grudge whatever against the critics . They are generally very poor hard - working men , and have a frightful struggle to live . I have often , privately , done some of them a good turn without their knowledge . A publisher of mine sent me an MS . the other day by one of my deadliest enemies on the press , and stated that my opinion would decide its rejection or acceptance , - I read it through , and though it was not very brilliant work , it was good enough , so I praised it as warmly as I could , and urged its publication , with the stipulation that the author should never be told I had had the casting vote . It has just come out I see , - and I 'm sure I hope it will succeed . "
132282	132295	132297	132297	she	2422	" Yes , - critics are very badly , even cruelly paid , "
132302	132437	132297	132297	she	2422	" It is not to be expected that they should write eulogies of the successful author , while they continue unsuccessful , - such work could not be anything but gall and wormwood to them . I know the poor little wife of one of them , - and settled her dressmaker 's bill for her because she was afraid to show it to her husband . The very week afterwards he slashed away at my last book in the most approved style in the paper on which he is employed , and got , I suppose , about a guinea for his trouble . Of course he did n't know about his little wife and her dunning dressmaker ; and he never will know , because I have bound her over to secrecy . "
132438	132447	132449	132449	Sibyl	166	" But why do you do such things ? "
132452	132474	132449	132449	Sibyl	166	" I would have let his wife get into the County Court for her bill , if I had been you ! "
132475	132479	132481	132481	Mavis	200	" Would you ? "
132485	132722	132481	132481	Mavis	200	" Well , I could not . You know Who it was that said ' Bless them that curse you , and do good to them that hate you ' ? Besides , the poor little woman was frightened to death at her own expenditure . It is pitiful , you know , to see the helpless agonies of people who will live beyond their incomes , - they suffer much more than the beggars in the street who make frequently more than a pound a day by merely whining and snivelling . The critics are much more in evil case than the beggars - few of them make even a pound a day , and of course they regard as their natural enemies the authors who make thirty to fifty pounds a week . I assure you I am very sorry for critics all round , - they are the least - regarded and worst - rewarded of all the literary community . And I never bother myself at all about what they say of me , except as I before observed , when in their haste they tell lies , - then of course it becomes necessary for me to state the truth in simple self - defence as well as by way of duty to my public . But as a rule I hand over all my press - notices to Tricksy there , "
132741	132754	132481	132481	Mavis	200	" and he tears them to indistinguishable shreds in about three minutes ! "
132811	132821	132828	132828	her	4266	" May I come and talk to you sometimes ? "
132835	132843	132828	132828	her	4266	" It would be such a privilege ! "
132844	132855	132858	132858	Mavis	200	" You can come whenever you like in the afternoons , "
132861	132877	132858	132858	Mavis	200	" The mornings belong to a goddess more dominant even than Beauty ; - Work ! "
132878	132885	132886	132886	I	0	" You never work at night ? "
132889	132937	132828	132828	her	4266	" Indeed no ! I never turn the ordinances of Nature upside down , as I am sure I should get the worst of it if I made such an attempt . The night is for sleep - and I use it thankfully for that blessed purpose . "
132938	132948	132949	132949	I	0	" Some authors can only write at night though , "
132952	132967	132969	132969	Mavis	200	" Then you may be sure they only produce blurred pictures and indistinct characterization , "
132971	133038	132969	132969	Mavis	200	" Some I know there are , who invite inspiration through gin or opium , as well as through the midnight influences , but I do not believe in such methods . Morning , and a freshly rested brain are required for literary labour , - that is , if one wants to write a book that will last for more than one ' season . ' "
133066	133075	133078	133078	Sibyl	166	" At any rate work agrees with you , "
133091	133097	133078	133078	Sibyl	166	" You look perfectly happy . "
133098	133104	133106	133106	she	4266	" I am perfectly happy , "
133111	133135	133106	133106	she	4266	" I have nothing in all the world to wish for , except that I may die as peacefully as I have lived . "
133136	133144	133145	133145	I	0	" May that day be far distant ! "
133158	133162	133163	133163	she	4266	" Thank you ! "
133167	133185	133163	133163	she	4266	" But I do not mind when it comes , so long as it finds me ready . "
133223	133238	133240	133240	she	166	" I quite understand the hatred there is in some quarters for Mavis Clare , "
133243	133254	133240	133240	she	166	" I am afraid I begin to hate her myself ! "
133266	133280	133255	133255	I	0	" You begin to hate her - - you ? - and why ? "
133281	133293	133294	133294	she	4266	" Are you so blind that you can not perceive why ? "
133310	133479	133294	133294	she	4266	" Because she is happy ! Because she has no scandals in her life , and because she dares to be content ! One longs to make her miserable ! But how to do it ? She believes in a God , - she thinks all He ordains is right and good . With such a firm faith as that , she would be happy in a garret earning but a few pence a day . I see now perfectly how she has won her public , - it is by the absolute conviction she has herself of the theories of life she tries to instil . What can be done against her ? Nothing ! But I understand why the critics would like to ' quash ' her , - if I were a critic , fond of whiskey - and - soda , and music - hall women , I should like to quash her myself for being so different to the rest of her sex ! "
133480	133490	133491	133491	I	0	" What an incomprehensible woman you are , Sibyl ! "
133498	133554	133491	133491	I	0	" You admire Miss Clare 's books , - you have always admired them , - you have asked her to become your friend , - and almost in the same breath you aver you would like to ' quash ' her or to make her miserable ! I confess I can not understand you ! "
133555	133562	133563	133563	she	2432	" Of course you can not ! "
133597	133741	133744	133744	she	2435	" I never supposed you could , and unlike the ordinary femme incomprise , I have never blamed you for your want of comprehension . It has taken me some time to understand myself , and even now I am not quite sure that I have gauged the depths or shallownesses of my own nature correctly . But on this matter of Mavis Clare , can you not imagine that badness may hate goodness ? That the confirmed drunkard may hate the sober citizen ? That the outcast may hate the innocent maiden ? And that it is possible that I , - reading life as I do , and finding it loathsome in many of its aspects , - distrusting men and women utterly , - and being destitute of any faith in God , - may hate , - yes hate , "
133763	133854	133744	133744	she	2435	" a woman who finds life beautiful , and God existent , - who takes no part in our social shams and slanders , - and who in place of my self - torturing spirit of analysis , has secured an enviable fame and the honour of thousands , allied to a serene content ? Why it would be something worth living for , to make such a woman wretched for once in her life ! - but , as she is constituted , it is impossible to do it . "
133872	133889	133891	133891	I	0	" If you do not mean to be her friend , you should tell her so , "
133895	133907	133891	133891	I	0	" You heard what she said about pretended protestations of regard ? "
133908	133912	133914	133914	she	2435	" I heard , "
133918	133940	133914	133914	she	2435	" She is a clever woman , Geoffrey , and you may trust her to find me out without any explanation ! "
133981	133995	133978	133978	I	0	" O Sibyl , Sibyl ! Why were you made as you are ! "
133996	134002	134003	134003	she	2435	" Ah , why indeed ! "
134012	134126	134003	134003	she	2435	" And why , being made as I am , was I born an Earl 's daughter ? If I had been a drab of the street , I should have been in my proper place , - and novels would have been written about me , and plays , - and I might have become such a heroine as should cause all good men to weep for joy because of my generosity in encouraging their vices ! But as an Earl 's daughter , respectably married to a millionaire , am a mistake of nature . Yet nature does make mistakes sometimes Geoffrey , and when she does they are generally irremediable ! "
134152	134155	134157	134157	I	0	" Sibyl , "
134162	134174	134157	134157	I	0	" I had hoped you and Mavis Clare might be friends . "
134178	134192	134194	134194	she	2439	" So we shall be friends I daresay , - for a little while "
134197	134305	134194	134194	she	2439	" But the dove does not willingly consort with the raven , and Mavis Clare 's way of life and studious habits would be to me insufferably dull . Besides , as I said before , she , as a clever woman and a thinker , is too clear - sighted not to find me out in the course of time . But I will play humbug as long as I can . If I perform the part of ' county lady ' or ' patron , ' of course she wo n't stand me for a moment . I shall have to assume a much more difficult r"le
134314	134314	134194	134194	she	2439	"

136477	136667	136473	136473	she	200	" Most people like him who know him , - but I do not always like those who surround him , - pardon me for my frankness ! The Prince of Wales is a social magnet , - he draws a number of persons after him who by dint of wealth , if not intelligence , can contrive to ' push ' into his set . Now I am not an advocate of ' push ' - moreover I do not care to be seen with ' everybody ' ; - this is my sinful pride you will say , or as our American cousins would put it , my ' cussedness . ' But I assure you , Mr Tempest , the best possession I have , and one which I value a great deal more even than my literary success , is my absolute independence , and I would not have it thought , even erroneously , that I am anxious to mix with the crowd of sycophants and time - servers who are only too ready to take advantage of the Prince 's good - nature . "
137676	137683	137684	137684	she	4266	" How he despises us all ! "

137753	137771	137744	137744	she	4266	" It is as if he read their thoughts , and perceived their intentions at a distance . "
138034	138078	138031	138031	she	166	" I have been thinking , Geoffrey , that perhaps there is some good in life after all , if I could only find it out and live it . But you are the last person to help me in such a matter . "
138110	138118	138119	138119	I	0	" What do you mean , Sibyl ? "
138122	138153	138119	138119	I	0	" Surely you know that I have the greatest desire to see you always in your best aspect , - many of your ideas have been most repugnant to me .... "

Have you not the same base passions as I ? - and do you not give way to them as basely ? What have I seen in you from day to day that I should take you as an example ? You are master here , and you rule with all the arrogance wealth can give , - you eat , drink and sleep , - you entertain your acquaintances simply that you may astonish them by the excess of luxury in which you indulge , - you read and smoke , shoot and ride , and there an end , - you are an ordinary , not an exceptional man . Do you trouble to ask what is wrong with me ? - do you try , with the patience of a great love , to set before me nobler aims than those I have consciously or unconsciously imbibed ? - do you try to lead me , an erring , passionate , misguided woman , into what I dream of as the light , - the light of faith and hope which alone gives peace ?

Despair and a sense of sin and misery ? - nonsense ! - bathe her temples with vinegar ! An uneasy conscience ? - ah ! - for an uneasy conscience there is nothing better than sal volatile ! Woman is a toy , - a breakable fool 's toy ; - and when she is broken , throw her aside and have done with her , - do n't try to piece together the fragile rubbish ! "

And I was not disappointed , - I found you , as I expected , enjoying each other 's society ! - the happiest and most fortunate couple existent , - people whom , out of all the world I should be disposed to envy , if I envied worldly happiness at all , which I do not !

139037	139127	139128	139128	I	0	" Thanks , yes . The town of Leamington provided me with quite a sumptuous repast of bread and cheese and ale . I am tired of luxuries you know , - that is why I find plain fare delicious . You are looking wonderfully well , Geoffrey ! - shall I offend you if I say you are growing - yes - positively stout ? - with the stoutness befitting a true county gentleman , who means to be as gouty in the future as his respectable ancestors ?

139211	139293	139196	139196	he	2582	" The necessary quantity of flesh is a bore to me always , - extra flesh would be a positive infliction . I should like , as the irreverent though reverend Sidney Smith said , on a hot day , ' to sit in my bones , ' or rather , to become a spirit of fine essence like Shakespeare 's Ariel , if such things were possible and permissible . How admirably married life agrees with you , Lady Sibyl ! "

139482	139530	139468	139468	he	2584	" But , my dear Lady Sibyl , time alters our ideas , and I am not sure whether you and your excellent husband are of the same opinion as you were when you started on your wedding - tour . You may not want me now ! "

139554	139592	139551	139551	I	0	" I shall always want you Lucio , - you are the best friend I ever had , and the only one I care to keep . Believe me ! - there 's my hand upon it ! "
139611	139619	139620	139620	he	2584	" And what does Lady Sibyl say ? "
139630	139635	139636	139636	she	4266	" Lady Sibyl says , "
139652	139697	139649	139649	her	4266	" that she will be proud and glad if you will consider Willowsmere your home as long as you have leisure to make it so , - and that she hopes , - though you are reputed to be a hater of women , - "
139711	139724	139699	139699	she	4266	" you will relent a little in favour of your present châtelaine ! "
139789	139793	139794	139794	he	124	" By Heaven ! "
139798	139820	139823	139823	he	124	" A perfect woman ! I should be a churl to withstand her , - or you , my good Geoffrey , "
139828	139894	139823	139823	he	124	" I have led a very devil of a life since I saw you last , - it 's time I reformed , - upon my soul it is ! The peaceful contemplation of virtuous marriage will do me good ! - send for my luggage to the station , Geoffrey , and make the best of me , - I 've come to stay ! "
141230	141238	141241	141241	Lucio	124	" I have asked you Mavis Clare , "
141244	141446	141241	141241	Lucio	124	" to let me serve you . You have genius - a rare quality in a woman , - and I would advance your fortunes . I should not be what I am if I did not try to persuade you to let me help on your career . You are not rich , - I could show you how to become so . You have a great fame - that I grant ; but you have many enemies and slanderers who are for ever trying to pull you down from the throne you have won . I could bring these to your feet , and make them your slaves . With your intellectual power , your personal grace and gifts of temperament , I could , if you would let me guide you , give you such far - reaching influence as no woman has possessed in this century . I am no boaster , - I can do what I say and more ; and I ask nothing from you in return except that you should follow my advice implicitly . My advice , let me tell you is not difficult to follow ; most people find it easy ! "
141521	141530	141531	141531	she	200	" You are very good , Prince Rimânez , "
141539	141813	141531	141531	she	200	" to take any thought for me at all . I can not imagine why you should do so ; for I am really nothing to you . I have of course heard from Mr Tempest of your great wealth and influence , and I have no doubt you mean kindly . But I have never owed anything to any one , - no one has ever helped me , - I have helped myself , and still prefer to do so . And really I have nothing to wish for , - except - when the time comes - a happy death . It is true I am not rich , - but then I do not want to be rich . I would not be the possessor of wealth for all the world ! To be surrounded with sycophants and flatterers , - never to be able to distinguish false friends from true , - to be loved for what you have and not for what you are ! - oh no , it would be misery to me . And I have never craved for power , - except perhaps the power to win love . And that I have , - many people love my books , and through my books love me , - I feel their love , though I may never see or know them personally . But I am so conscious of their sympathy that I love them in return without the necessity of personal acquaintance . They have hearts which respond to my heart , - that is all the power I care about . "
141814	141821	141823	141823	Lucio	124	" You forget your numerous enemies ! "
141830	141839	141841	141841	she	2632	" No , I do not forget them , "
141845	142069	141841	141841	she	2632	" But - I forgive them ! They can do me no harm . As long as I do not lower myself , no one else can lower me . If my own conscience is clear , no reproaches can wound . My life is open to all , - people can see how I live , and what I do . I try to do well , - but if there are those who think I do ill , I am sorry , - and if my faults can be amended I shall be glad to amend them . One must have enemies in this world , - that is , if one makes any sort of position , - people without enemies are generally nonentities . All who succeed in winning some little place of independence must expect the grudging enmity of hundreds who can not find even the smallest foothold , and are therefore failures in the battle of life , - I pity these sincerely , and when they say or write cruel things of me , I know it is only spleen and disappointment that moves both their tongues and pens , and freely pardon them . They can not hurt or hinder me , - in fact , no one can hurt or hinder me but myself . "
142126	142145	142147	142147	he	124	" Fair philosopher , you are almost a feminine Marcus Aurelius in your estimate of men and things ! "
142150	142445	142147	142147	he	124	" But - you are still a woman - and there is one thing lacking to your life of sublime and calm contentment - a thing at whose touch philosophy fails , and wisdom withers at its root . Love , Mavis Clare ! - lover 's love , - devoted love , blindly passionate , - this has not been yours as yet to win ! No heart beats against your own , - no tender arms caress you , - you are alone . Men are for the most part afraid of you , - being brute fools themselves , they like their women to be brute fools also , - and they grudge you your keen intellect , - your serene independence . Yet which is best ? - the adoration of a brute fool , or the loneliness pertaining to a spirit aloft on some snowy mountain - peak , with no companions but the stars ? Think of it ! - the years will pass , and you must needs grow old , - and with the years will come that solitary neglect which makes age bitter . Now , you will doubtless wonder at my words - yet believe me I speak the truth when I say that I can give you love , - not my love , for I love none , - but I can bring to your feet the proudest men in any country of the world as suitors for your hand . You shall have your choice of them , and your own time for choosing , - and whomsoever you love , him you shall we d , ... why - what is wrong with you that you shrink from me thus ? "
142462	142467	142468	142468	she	2633	" You terrify me ! "
142488	142583	142483	142483	she	2633	" Such promises are incredible - impossible ! You speak as if you were more than human ! I do not understand you , Prince Rimânez , - you are different to anyone I ever met , and ... and ... something in me stronger than myself warns me against you . What are you ? - why do you talk to me so strangely ? Pardon me if I seem ungrateful ... , oh , let us go in - it is getting quite late I am sure , and I am cold ... "
142616	142624	142626	142626	she	2633	" You say my life is lonely , "
142641	142797	142626	142626	she	2633	" and you suggest love and marriage as the only joys that can make a woman happy . You may be right . I do not presume to assert that you are wrong . I have many married women - friends - but I would not change my lot with any one of them . I have dreamed of love , - but because I have not realized my dream I am not the less content . If it is God 's will that I should be alone all my days , I shall not murmur , for my solitude is not actual loneliness . Work is a good comrade , - then I have books , and flowers and birds - I am never really lonely . And that I shall fully realize my dream of love one day I am sure , - if not here , then hereafter . I can wait ! "
142852	142863	142864	142864	he	124	" True , - you can wait , Mavis Clare ! "
142877	143125	142864	142864	he	124	" You can afford to wait ! Tell me , - think for a moment ! - can you remember me ? Is there a time on which you can look back , and looking , see my face , not here but elsewhere ? Think ! Did you ever see me long ago - in a far sphere of beauty and light , when you were an Angel , Mavis , - and I was - not what I am now ! How you tremble ! You need not fear me , - I would not harm you for a thousand worlds ! I talk wildly at times I know ; - I think of things that are past , - long long past , - and I am filled with regrets that burn my soul with fiercer heat than fire ! And so neither world 's wealth , world 's power , nor world 's love will tempt you , Mavis ! - and you , - a woman ! You are a living miracle then , - as miraculous as the drop of undefiled dew which reflects in its tiny circumference all the colours of the sky , and sinks into the earth sweetly , carrying moisture and refreshment where it falls . I can do nothing for you - you will not have my aid - you reject my service ? Then as I may not help you , you must help me ! "
143141	143289	143132	143132	he	2637	" I ask a very little thing of you , - pray for me ! I know you are accustomed to pray , so it will be no trouble to you , - you believe God hears you , - and when I look at you , I believe it too . Only a pure woman can make faith possible to man . Pray for me then , as one who has fallen from his higher and better self , - who strives , but who may not attain , - who labours under heavy punishment , - who would fain reach Heaven , but who by the cursëd will of man , and man alone , is kept in Hell ! Pray for me , Mavis Clare ! promise it ! - and so shall you lift me a step nearer the glory I have lost ! "
143372	143383	143385	143385	she	200	" Since you desire it so earnestly , I promise , "
143388	143411	143385	143385	she	200	" I will pray that the strange and bitter sorrow which seems to consume you may be removed from your life - - "
143412	143415	143416	143416	he	124	" Sorrow ! "
143431	143679	143680	143680	He	2640	" Woman , - genius , - angel , whatever you are , do not speak of one sorrow for me ! I have a thousand thousand sorrows ! - aye a million million , that are as little flames about my heart , and as deeply seated as the centres of the universe ! The foul and filthy crimes of men , - the base deceits and cruelties of women , - the ruthless , murderous ingratitude of children , - the scorn of good , the martyrdom of intellect , the selfishness , the avarice , the sensuality of human life , the hideous blasphemy and sin of the creature to the Creator - these are my endless sorrows ! - these keep me wretched and in chains , when I would fain be free . These create hell around me , and endless torture , - these bind and crush me and pervert my being till I become what I dare not name to myself , or to others . And yet , ... as the eternal God is my witness , ... I do not think I am as bad as the worst man living ! I may tempt - but I do not pursue , - I take the lead in many lives , yet I make the way I go so plain that those who follow me do so by their own choice and free will more than by my persuasion ! "
143691	143786	143680	143680	He	2640	" You look afraid of me , - but be assured you never had less cause for terror . You have truth and purity - I honour both . You will have none of my advice or assistance in the making of your life 's history , - to - night therefore we part , to meet no more on earth . Never again , Mavis Clare ! - no , not through all your quiet days of sweet and contented existence will I cross your path , - before Heaven I swear it ! "
143787	143791	143793	143793	Mavis	200	" But why ? "
143818	143871	143812	143812	her	200	" Why do you speak with such a passion of self - reproach ? What dark cloud is on your mind ? Surely you have a noble nature , - and I feel that I have wronged you in my thoughts , ... you must forgive me - I have mistrusted you - "
143872	143880	143881	143881	he	2640	" You do well to mistrust me ! "
143914	144156	143888	143888	he	2640	" Your instinct teaches you rightly . Would there were many more like you to doubt me and repel me ! One word , - if , when I am gone , you ever think of me , think that I am more to be pitied than the veriest paralysed and starving wretch that ever crawled on earth , - for he , perchance , has hope - and I have none . And when you pray for me - for I hold you to this promise , - pray for one who dares not pray for himself ! You know the words , ' Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil ' ? To - night you have been led into temptation , though you knew it not , but you have delivered yourself from evil as only a true soul can . And now farewell ! In life I shall see you no more : - in death , - well ! I have attended many death - beds in response to the invitations of the moribund , - but I shall not be present at yours ! Perhaps , when your parting spirit is on the verge between darkness and light , you may know who I was , and am ! - and you may thank God with your last breath that we parted to - night - as we do now - forever ! "
144342	144370	144332	144332	Lucio	124	" Well , eavesdropper ! Why did you not come out of the shadow of that elm - tree and see the play to a better advantage ? "
144383	144393	144394	144394	he	2641	" You saw a pretty bit of acting here , "
144420	144509	144407	144407	he	2641	" you know my theory , that all men and all women are purchaseable for gold ? Well , I wanted to try Mavis Clare . She rejected all my advantageous offers , as you must have heard , and I could only make matters smooth by asking her to pray for me . That I did this very melodramatically I hope you will admit ? A woman of that dreamy idealistic temperament always likes to imagine that there is a man who is grateful for her prayers ! "
144510	144520	144521	144521	I	0	" You seemed very much in earnest about it ! "
144534	144540	144541	144541	he	2644	" Why , of course ! "
144551	144577	144541	144541	he	2644	" I had an audience ! Two fastidious critics of dramatic art heard me rant my rantings , - I had to do my best ! "
144578	144582	144583	144583	I	0	" Two critics ? "
144587	144632	144545	144545	his	2644	" Yes . You on one side , - Lady Sibyl on the other . Lady Sibyl rose , after the custom of fashionable beauties at the opera , before the last scene , in order to get home in good time for supper ! "
144645	144652	144653	144653	I	0	" You must be mistaken Lucio - "
144656	144682	144653	144653	I	0	" That I listened I admit , - and it was wrong of me to do so , - but my wife would never condescend ... "
144683	144714	144715	144715	he	2644	" Ah , then it must have been a sylph of the woods that glided out of the shadow with a silken train behind her and diamonds in her hair ! "
144719	144799	144715	144715	he	2644	" Tut Geoffrey ! - do n't look so crestfallen . I have done with Mavis Clare , and she with me . I have not been making love to her , - I have simply , just to amuse myself , tested her character , - and I find it stronger than I thought . The combat is over . She will never go my way , - nor , I fear , shall I ever go hers ! "
144800	144807	144808	144808	I	0	" Upon my word , Lucio , "
144814	144829	144808	144808	I	0	" Your disposition seems to grow more and more erratic and singular every day ! "
144830	144835	144836	144836	he	2645	" Does it not ! "
144848	144905	144907	144907	he	2645	" I am a curious creature altogether ! Wealth is mine and I care not a jot for it , - power is mine and I loathe its responsibility ; - in fact I would rather be anything but what I am ! Look at the lights of your ' home , sweet home ' Geoffrey ! "
144939	145057	144907	144907	he	2645	" Lady Sibyl is there , - an enchanting and perfect woman , who lives but to welcome you to her embracing arms ! Fortunate man ! - who would not envy you ! Love ! - who would , who could exist without it - save me ! Who , in Europe at least , would forego the delights of kissing , - which the Japanese by - the - by consider a disgusting habit , - without embraces , - and all those other endearments which are supposed to dignify the progress of true love ! One never tires of these things , - there is no satiety ! I wish I could love somebody ! "
145058	145067	145069	145069	I	0	" So you can , if you like , "
145078	145231	145233	145233	his	2649	" I can not . It is not in me . You heard me tell Mavis Clare as much . I have it in my power to make other people fall in love , somewhat after the dexterous fashion practised by match - making mothers , - but for myself , love on this planet is too low a thing - too brief in duration . Last night , in a dream , - I have strange dreams at times , - I saw one whom possibly I could love , - but she was a Spirit , with eyes more lustrous than the morning , and a form as transparent as flame ; - she could sing sweetly , and I watched her soaring upward , and listened to her song . It was a wild song , and to many mortal ears meaningless , - it was something like this ... "
145344	145351	145353	145353	he	2649	" She was a strange Spirit , "
145356	145364	145353	145353	he	2649	" because she could see nothing but herself "
145401	145401	145392	145392	I	0	"
145412	145417	145419	145419	I	0	" You talk wildly , "
145422	145438	145419	145419	I	0	" And you sing wildly . Of things that mean nothing , and are nothing . "
145456	145459	145460	145460	he	2649	" True ! "
145463	145615	145460	145460	he	2649	" Things which have meaning and are valuable , have all to do with money or appetite , Geoffrey ! There is no wider outlook evidently ! But we were speaking of love , and I hold that love should be eternal as hate . Here you have the substance of my religious creed if I have any , - that there are two spiritual forces ruling the universe - love and hate , - and that their incessant quarrel creates the general confusion of life . Both contend one against the other , - and only at Judgment - Day will it be proved which is the strongest . I am on the side of Hate myself , - for at present Hate has scored all the victories worth winning , while Love has been so often martyred that there is only the poor ghost of it left on earth . "
145641	145648	145649	145649	he	124	" Your guardian - angel beckons ! "
145667	145673	145649	145649	he	124	" Let us go in . "
146450	146459	146460	146460	I	0	" trifles which make up the sum of life "

147307	147342	147302	147302	I	0	" This is a piece of acting doubtless - - such as chanced the other night with Mavis Clare ! - - patience ! - - let us hear this - - this comedy ! "
147523	147528	147529	147529	she	4266	" I love you ! "
147532	147619	147529	147529	she	4266	" Lucio , I love you , and my love is killing me ! Be merciful ! - have pity on my passion ! - love me for one hour , one little hour ! - it is not much to ask , and afterwards , - do with me what you will , - torture me , brand me an outcast in the public sight , curse me before Heaven - I care nothing - I am yours body and soul - I love you ! "
147636	147642	147643	147643	I	0	" Hush , - hush ! "

147737	147742	147743	147743	she	4266	" Lucio - Lucio ! "
147746	147849	147743	147743	she	4266	" Have you a heart ? Can you reject me when I pray to you thus ? - when I offer you all myself , - all that I am , or ever hope to be ? Am I so repugnant to you ? Many men would give their lives if I would say to them what I say to you , - but they are nothing to me - you alone are my world , - the breath of my existence ! - ah , Lucio , can you not believe , will you not realize how deeply I love you ! "
147875	147882	147883	147883	he	2692	" I know you love me ! "
147910	147954	147899	147899	his	2692	" I have always known it ! Your vampire soul leaped to mine at the first glance I ever gave you , - you were a false foul thing from the first , and you recognized your master ! Yes - your Master ! "
147985	148162	147969	147969	he	2692	" Listen to the truth of yourself for once from one who is not afraid to speak it ! - you love me , - and truly your body and soul are mine to claim , if I so choose ! You married with a lie upon your lips ; you swore fidelity to your husband before God , with infidelity already in your thoughts , and by your own act made the mystical blessing a blasphemy and a curse ! Wonder not then that the curse has fallen ! I knew it all ! - the kiss I gave you on your wedding - day put fire in your blood and sealed you mine ! - why , you would have fled to me that very night , had I demanded it , - had I loved you as you love me , - that is , if you choose to call the disease of vanity and desire that riots in your veins , by such a name as love ! But now hear me ! "
148196	148382	148170	148170	he	2695	" I hate you ! Yes - I hate you , and all such women as you ! For you corrupt the world , - you turn good to evil , - you deepen folly into crime , - with the seduction of your nude limbs and lying eyes , you make fools , cowards and beasts of men ! When you die , your bodies generate foulness , - things of the mould and slime are formed out of the flesh that was once fair for man 's delight , - you are no use in life - you become poison in death , - I hate you all ! I read your soul - it is an open book to me - and it is branded with a name given to those who are publicly vile , but which should , of strict right and justice , be equally bestowed on women of your position and type , who occupy pride and place in this world 's standing , and who have not the excuse of poverty for selling themselves to the devil ! "
148604	148610	148611	148611	she	4266	" Lucio ! ... Lucio ! "
148629	148796	148611	148611	she	4266	" Say what you will - say all you will of me , - you can say nothing that is not true . I am vile - I own it . But is it of much avail to be virtuous ? What pleasure comes from goodness ? - what gratification from self - denial ? There is no God to care ! A few years , and we all die , and are forgotten even by those who loved us , - why should we lose such joys as we may have for the mere asking ? Surely it is not difficult to love even me for an hour ? - am I not fair to look upon ? - and is all this beauty of my face and form worthless in your sight , and you no more than man ? Murder me as you may with all the cruelty of cruel words , I care nothing ! - I love you - love you ! "
148833	148853	148807	148807	she	2708	" Look at me ! You shall not , - you dare not spurn such a love as mine ! "
148927	148935	148936	148936	he	124	" Shall not ! - dare not ! "
148940	149156	148936	148936	he	124	" Woman 's words , - woman 's ranting ! - the shriek of the outraged feminine animal who fails to attract , as she thinks , her chosen mate . Such a love as yours ! - what is it ? Degradation to whosoever shall accept it , - shame to whosoever shall rely upon it ! You make a boast of your beauty ; your mirror shows you a pleasing image , - but your mirror lies ! - as admirably as you do ! You see within it not the reflection of yourself , for that would cause you to recoil in horror , ... you merely look upon your fleshly covering , a garment of tissues , shrinkable , perishable , and only fit to mingle with the dust from which it sprang . Your beauty ! I see none of it , - I see You ! and to me you are hideous , and will remain hideous for ever . I hate you ! - I hate you with the bitterness of an immeasurable and unforgiving hatred , - for you have done me a wrong , - you have wrought an injury upon me , - you have added another burden to the load of punishment I carry ! "
149175	149179	149180	149180	he	2710	" Stand back ! "
149183	149283	149180	149180	he	2710	" Be afraid of me , as of an unknown Terror ! O pitiless Heaven ! - to think of it ! - but a night ago I was lifted a step nearer to my lost delight ! - and now this woman drags me back , and down ! - and yet again I hear the barring of the gates of Paradise ! O infinite torture ! O wicked souls of men and women ! - is there no touch of grace or thought of God left in you ! - and will ye make my sorrows eternal ! "
149369	149372	149374	149374	she	2711	" Lucio , "
149377	149451	149374	149374	she	2711	" Lucio , ... what is it ... what have I done ? - I who would not wound you for the world ? - I who but seek your love , Lucio , to repay it in full with such fond passion and tenderness as you have never known ! For this and this only , I married Geoffrey , - I chose your friend as husband because he was your friend ! "
149456	149555	149374	149374	she	2711	" and because I saw his foolish egotism - his pride in himself and his riches , - his blind confidence in me and in you ; - I knew that I could , after a time , follow the fashion of many another woman in my set and choose my lover , - ah , my lover ! - I had chosen him already , - I have chosen you , Lucio ! - yes , though you hate me you can not hinder me from loving you , - I shall love you till I die ! "
149572	149578	149579	149579	he	2714	" And after you die ? "
149582	149589	149579	149579	he	2714	" Will you love me then ? "
149605	149610	149611	149611	she	2715	" After death ! ... "
149614	149621	149622	149622	he	2714	" Yes , - after death ! "
149626	149638	149622	149622	he	2714	" There is an after ; - as your mother knows ! "
149654	149658	149659	149659	he	2714	" Fair lady , "
149663	149891	149659	149659	he	2714	" your mother was , like yourself , a voluptuary . She , like you , made up her mind to ' follow the fashion ' as you put it , as soon as her husband 's ' blind ' or willing confidence was gained . She chose , not one lover but many . You know her end . In the written but miscomprehended laws of Nature , a diseased body is the natural expression of a diseased mind , - her face in her last days was the reflex of her soul . You shudder ? - the thought of her hideousness is repellent to your self - conscious beauty ? Yet the evil that was in her is also in you , - it festers in your blood slowly but surely , and as you have no faith in God to cure the disease , it will have its way - even at the final moment when death clutches at your throat and stops your breathing . The smile upon your frozen lips then will not be the smile of a saint , believe me , but of a sinner ! Death is never deceived , though life may be . And afterwards ... I ask again , will you love me , do you think ? ... when you know WHO I am ? "
149922	149930	149931	149931	she	2717	" When I know who you are ! "
149935	149975	149931	149931	she	2717	" Do I not know ? You are Lucio , - Lucio Rimânez - my love , - my love ! - whose voice is my music , - whose beauty I adore , - whose looks are my heaven "
149977	149981	149982	149982	he	2716	" And Hell ! "
149990	149994	149982	149982	he	2716	" Come here ! "
150033	150041	150043	150043	he	2716	" Since you love me so well , "
150046	150053	150043	150043	he	2716	" Kneel down and worship me ! "
150111	150122	150123	150123	she	2717	" With every pulse of my being I worship you ! "
150127	150182	150123	150123	she	2717	" My king ! - my god ! The cruel things you say but deepen my love for you , - you can kill , but you can never change me ! For one kiss of your lips I would die , - for one embrace from you I would give my soul ! ... "
150183	150190	150191	150191	he	2718	" Have you one to give ? "
150195	150475	150191	150191	he	2718	" Is it not already disposed of ? You should make sure of that first ! Stay where you are and let me look at you ! So ! - a woman , wearing a husband 's name , holding a husband 's honour , clothed in the very garments purchased with a husband 's money , and newly risen from a husband 's side , steals forth thus in the night , seeking to disgrace him and pollute herself by the vulgarest unchastity ! And this is all that the culture and training of nineteenth - century civilization can do for you ? Myself , I prefer the barbaric fashion of old times , when rough savages fought for their women as they fought for their cattle , treated them as cattle , and kept them in their place , never dreaming of endowing them with such strong virtues as truth and honour ! If women were pure and true , then the lost happiness of the world might return to it , - but the majority of them are like you , liars , ever pretending to be what they are not . I may do what I choose with you , you say ? torture you , kill you , brand you with the name of outcast in the public sight , and curse you before Heaven - if I will only love you ! - all this is melodramatic speech , and I never cared for melodrama at any time . I shall neither kill you , brand you , curse you , nor love you ; - I shall simply - call your husband ! "
150502	150507	150508	150508	she	2719	" You dare not ! "
150511	150520	150508	150508	she	2719	" You dare not so ... disgrace me ! "
150521	150525	150526	150526	he	0	" Disgrace you ! "
150530	150543	150526	150526	he	0	" That remark comes rather late , seeing you have disgraced yourself ! "
150585	150595	150596	150596	she	2719	" You repulse me , - you scorn me ! "
150610	150729	150731	150731	she	2720	" You make a mockery of my heart 's anguish and despair , but you shall suffer for it ! I am your match , - nay your equal ! You shall not spurn me a second time ! You ask , will I love you when I know who you are , - it is your pleasure to deal in mysteries , but I have no mysteries - I am a woman who loves you with all the passion of a life , - and I will murder myself and you , rather than live to know that I have prayed you for your love in vain . Do you think I came unprepared ? - no ! "
150761	150791	150731	150731	she	2720	" Love me , I say ! - or I will stab myself dead here at your feet , and cry out to Geoffrey that you have murdered me ! "
150848	150857	150858	150858	he	124	" Your place was the stage , Madam ! "
150861	150976	150858	150858	he	124	" You should have been the chief female mime at some ' high - class ' theatre ! You would have adorned the boards , drawn the mob , had as many lovers , stagey and private as you pleased , been invited to act at Windsor , obtained a payment - jewel from the Queen , and written your name in her autograph album . That should undoubtedly have been your ' great ' career - you were born for it - made for it ! You would have been as brute - souled as you are now , - but that would not have mattered , - mimes are exempt from chastity ! "
151061	151235	151054	151054	she	2721	" Lucio Rimânez , I have borne your insults as I would bear my death at your hands , because I love you . You loathe me , you say - you repulse me , - I love you still ! You can not cast me off - I am yours ! You shall love me , or I will die , - one of the two . Take time for thought , - I leave you to - night , - I give you all to - morrow to consider , - love me , - give me yourself , - be my lover , - and I will play the comedy of social life as well as any other woman , - so well that my husband shall never know . But refuse me again as you have refused me now , and I will make away with myself . I am not ' acting , ' - I am speaking calmly and with conviction ; I mean what I say ! "
151236	151240	151242	151242	Lucio	124	" Do you ? "
151245	151258	151242	151242	Lucio	124	" Let me congratulate you ! Few women attain to such coherence ! "
151259	151271	151272	151272	she	2723	" I will put an end to this life of mine ; "
151285	151297	151272	151272	she	2723	" I can not endure existence without your love , Lucio ! "
151307	151386	151387	151387	he	2724	" I hunger for the kisses of your lips , - the clasp of your arms ! Do you know - do you ever think of your own power ? - the cruel , terrible power of your eyes , your speech , your smile , - the beauty which makes you more like an angel than a man , - and have you no pity ? Do you think that ever a man was born like you ? "
151405	151461	151402	151402	his	2724	" When you speak , I hear music - when you sing , it seems to me that I understand what the melodies of a poet 's heaven must be ; - surely , surely you know that your very looks are a snare to the warm weak soul of a woman ! Lucio ! - "
151474	151490	151468	151468	she	2723	" Meet me to - morrow in the lane near the cottage of Mavis Clare .... "
151507	151519	151520	151520	she	2723	" I heard all you said to her the other night ; "
151532	151700	151520	151520	she	2723	" I followed you , - and I listened . I was well - nigh mad with jealousy - I thought - I feared - you loved her , - but I was wrong . I never do thank God for anything , - but I thanked God that night that I was wrong ! She was not made for you - I am ! Meet me outside her house , where the great white rose - tree is in bloom - gather one , - one of those little autumnal roses and give it to me - I shall understand it as a signal - a signal that I may come to you to - morrow night and not be cursed or repulsed , but loved , - loved ! - ah Lucio ! promise me ! - one little rose ! - the symbol of an hour 's love ! - then let me die ; I shall have had all I ask of life ! "
151797	151804	151805	151805	he	2726	" Woman , false and accurséd ! "
151815	151968	151805	151805	he	2726	" You know not what you seek ! All that you ask of life shall be yours in death ! - this is the law , - therefore beware what demands you make lest they be too fully granted ! A rose from the cottage of Mavis Clare ? - a rose from the garden of Eden ! - they are one and the same to me ! Not for my gathering or yours ! Love and joy ? For the unfaithful there is no love , - for the impure there is no joy . Add no more to the measure of my hatred and vengeance ! - Go while there is yet time , - go and front the destiny you have made for yourself - for nothing can alter it ! And as for me , whom you love , - before whom you have knelt in idolatrous worship - "
151977	152000	151975	151975	him	2726	" why , - restrain your feverish desires , fair fiend ! - have patience ! - we shall meet ere long ! "
152031	152046	152047	152047	I	0	" Let me defend you , Lucio , from the pertinacities of this wanton ! "
152056	152084	152047	152047	I	0	" An hour ago I thought she was my wife , - I find her nothing but a purchased chattel , who seeks a change of masters ! "
152143	152149	152150	152150	I	0	" I have heard you ! "
152153	152405	152150	152150	I	0	" I have seen you ! I have watched you kneel before my true friend , my loyal comrade there , and try your best to make him as vile as yourself ! I am that poor fool , your husband , - that blind egoist whose confidence you sought to win - and to betray ! I am the unhappy wretch whose surplus of world 's cash has bought for him in marriage a shameless courtezan ! You dare to talk of love ? You profane its very name ! Good God ! - what are such women as you made of ? You throw yourselves into our arms , - you demand our care - you exact our respect - you tempt our senses - you win our hearts , - and then you make fools of us all ! Fools , and worse than fools , - you make us men without feeling , conscience , faith , or pity ! If we become criminals , what wonder ! If we do things that shame our sex , is it not because you set us the example ? God - God ! I , who loved you , - yes , loved you in spite of all that my marriage with you taught me , - I , who would have died to save you from a shadow of suspicion , - I am the one out of all the world you choose to murder by your treachery ! "
152434	152442	152443	152443	she	2732	" What did you marry me for ? "
152446	152454	152443	152443	she	2732	" For my sake or your own ? "
152499	152516	152518	152518	Sibyl	166	" Was it because you desired to make me happy out of pure love for me ? "
152520	152746	152518	152518	Sibyl	166	" Or because you wished to add dignity to your own position by wedding the daughter of an Earl ? Your motives were not unselfish , - you chose me simply because I was the ' beauty ' of the day whom London men stared at and talked of , - and because it gave you a certain ' prestige ' to have me for your wife , in the same way as it gave you a footing with Royalty to be the owner of the Derby - winner . I told you honestly what I was before our marriage , - it made no effect upon your vanity and egoism . I never loved you , - I could not love you , and I told you so . You have heard , so you say , all that has passed between me and Lucio , - therefore you know why I married you . I state it boldly to your face , - it was that I might have your intimate friend for my lover . That you should pretend to be scandalized at this is absurd ; it is a common position of things in France , and is becoming equally common in England . Morality has always been declared unnecessary for men , - it is becoming equally unnecessary for women ! "
152779	152791	152793	152793	she	2733	" You have only to read the ' new ' fiction , "
152806	153063	152793	152793	she	2733	" and indeed all ' new ' literature generally , to be assured that your ideas of domestic virtue are quite out of date . Both men and women are , according to certain accepted writers of the day , at equal liberty to love when they will , and where they may . Polygamous purity is the ' new ' creed ! Such love , in fact , so we are taught , constitutes the only ' sacred ' union . If you want to alter this ' movement , ' and return to the old - fashioned types of the modest maiden and the immaculate matron , you must sentence all the ' new ' writers of profitable pruriency to penal servitude for life , and institute a Government censorship of the modern press . As matters stand , your attitude of the outraged husband is not only ridiculous , - it is unfashionable . I assure you I do not feel the slightest prick of conscience in saying I love Lucio , - any woman might be proud of loving him ; - he , however , will not , or can not love me , - we have had a ' scene , ' and you have completed the dramatic effect by witnessing it , - there is no more to be said or done in the affair . I do not suppose you can divorce me , - but if you can , you may - I shall make no defence . "
153106	153118	153120	153120	he	124	" This is a very painful and distressing state of things , "
153139	153171	153120	153120	he	124	" but I must positively protest against the idea of divorce , not only for her ladyship 's sake , but my own . I am entirely innocent in the matter ! "
153172	153175	153176	153176	I	0	" Innocent ! "
153186	153259	153176	153176	I	0	" You are nobility itself , Lucio ! - as loyal a friend as ever man had ! I thank you for your courage , - for the plain and honest manner in which you have spoken . I heard all you said ! Nothing was too strong , - nothing could be too strong to awaken this misguided woman to a sense of her outrageous conduct , - her unfaithfulness - - "
153260	153264	153265	153265	he	124	" Pardon me ! "
153269	153351	153265	153265	he	124	" The Lady Sibyl can scarcely be called unfaithful , Geoffrey . She suffers , - - from - - let us call it , a little exaltation of nerves ! In thought she may be guilty of infidelity , but society does not know that , - and in act she is pure , - pure as the newly - driven snow , - and as the newly - driven snow , will society , itself immaculate , regard her ! "
153364	153373	153374	153374	I	0	" You think as I do , Lucio ! "
153378	153415	153374	153374	I	0	" You feel with me , that a wife 's unchaste thought is as vile as her unchaste act . There is no excuse , - no palliative for such cruel and abominable ingratitude . Why , "
153430	153484	153423	153423	I	0	" Did I not free you and your family from the heavy pressure of poverty and debt ? Have I grudged you anything ? Are you not loaded with jewels ? - have you not greater luxuries and liberties than a queen ? And do you not owe me at least some duty ? "
153485	153491	153492	153492	she	166	" I owe you nothing ! "
153496	153519	153492	153492	she	166	" I gave you what you paid for , - my beauty and my social position . It was a fair bargain ! "
153520	153527	153528	153528	I	0	" A dear and bitter one ! "
153531	153560	153492	153492	she	166	" Maybe so . But such as it was , you struck it , - not I. You can end it when you please , - the law ... "
153561	153574	153577	153577	Lucio	124	" The law will give you no freedom in such a case , "
153585	153664	153577	153577	Lucio	124	" A judicial separation on the ground of incompatibility of temper might be possible certainly - but would not that be a pity ? Her ladyship is unfortunate in her tastes , - that is all ! - she selected me as her cavaliere servente , and I refused the situation , - hence there is nothing for it but to forget this unpleasant incident , and try to live on a better understanding for the future - - "
153665	153669	153672	153673	my wife	4266	" Do you think "
153691	153718	153686	153686	she	4266	" Do you think I will live with him after what he has seen and heard to - night ? What do you take me for ? "
153719	153732	153735	153735	Lucio	124	" For a very charming woman of hasty impulses and unwise reasoning , "
153744	153831	153735	153735	Lucio	124	" Lady Sibyl , you are illogical , - most of your sex are . You can do no good by prolonging this scene , - a most unpleasant and trying one to us poor men . You know how we hate ' scenes ' ! Let me beg of you to retire ! Your duty is to your husband ; pray heaven he may forget this midnight delirium of yours , and set it down to some strange illness rather than to any evil intention . "
153848	153851	153852	153852	she	2736	" Lucio ! "
153855	153870	153852	153852	she	2736	" Lucio , my love ! Good - night ! - Good - bye ! "

153890	153900	153887	153887	I	0	" O infamous woman ! Have you no shame ? "
153901	153904	153905	153905	she	2736	" None ! "
153913	153994	153905	153905	she	2736	" I glory in my love for such a king of worth and beauty ! Look at him ! - and then look at yourself in the nearest mirror that reflects so poor and mean a picture of a man ! How , even in your egoism , could you deem it possible for a woman to love you when he was near ! Stand out of the light ! - you interpose a shadow between my god and me ! "
154034	154047	154049	154049	she	2736	" I may as well say good - bye to you also , "
154052	154062	154049	154049	she	2736	" For I shall never live with you again . "
154063	154069	154070	154070	I	0	" Nor I with you ! "
154074	154085	154086	154086	she	2736	" Nor I with you - nor I with you ! "
154095	154116	154086	154086	she	2736	" Of course not ! - if I do not live with you , you can not live with me ! "
154131	154136	154137	154137	she	2736	" Good - bye ! "
154243	154255	154256	154256	I	0	" By heaven , a veritable new Venus and reluctant Adonis ! "

Go , with the proud consciousness that you have worked all the mischief and ruin that is most dear to the heart of a woman , - you have spoilt a life and dishonoured a name , - you can do no more , - your feminine triumph is complete ! Go ! - would to God I might never see your face again ! - would to God I had been spared the misery of having married you ! "
154630	154634	154635	154635	I	0	" Lucio ! ... "
154638	154659	154635	154635	I	0	" Lucio ... my friend ! I think , ... I am , ... dying ! My heart is broken ! "
155108	155129	155094	155094	Lucio	124	" Keep still , Geoffrey ! You 'll be all right in a few minutes . Do n't worry yourself . "
155130	155134	155135	155135	I	0	" Worry myself ! "
155139	155148	155135	155135	I	0	" Why not say do n't kill yourself ! "
155149	155163	155164	155164	he	124	" Because I see no necessity to offer you that advice at present - "
155168	155213	155164	155164	he	124	" and if there were necessity , I doubt if I should give it , - because I consider it better to kill one 's self than worry one 's self . However opinions differ . I want you to take this matter lightly . "
155214	155226	155227	155227	I	0	" Lightly ! - take my own dishonour and disgrace lightly ! "
155236	155242	155227	155227	I	0	" You ask too much ! "
155243	155438	155439	155439	His	2753	" My good fellow , I ask no more than is asked and expected of a hundred ' society ' husbands to - day . Consider ! - your wife has been led away from her soberer judgment and reasoning by an exalted and hysterical passion for me on account of my looks , - not for myself at all - because she really does not know Me , - she only sees me as I appear to be . The love of handsome exterior personalities is a common delusion of the fair sex - and passes in time like other women 's diseases . No actual dishonour or disgrace attaches to her or to you , - nothing has been seen , heard , or done , in public . This being so , I ca n't understand what you are making a fuss about . The great object of social life , you know , is to hide all savage passions and domestic differences from the gaze of the vulgar crowd . You can be as bad as you like in private - only God sees - and that does not matter ! "
155459	155475	155456	155456	his	2753	" If she be not fair for me What care I how fair she be ! "
155476	155485	155487	155487	he	2753	" That is the true spirit , Geoffrey , "
155491	155560	155487	155487	he	2753	" It sounds flippant to you no doubt in your present tragic frame of mind , - but it is the only way to treat women , in marriage or out of it . Before the world and society , your wife is like Cæsar 's , above suspicion . Only you and I we will leave God out have been the witnesses of her attack of hysteria ... "
155561	155572	155573	155573	I	0	" Hysteria , you call it ! She loves you ! "
155577	155599	155573	155573	I	0	" And she has always loved you . She confessed it , - and you admitted that you always knew it ! "
155600	155617	155619	155619	he	2754	" I always knew she was hysterical - yes - if that is what you mean ; "
155622	155771	155619	155619	he	2754	" The majority of women have no real feelings , no serious emotions - except one - vanity . They do not know what a great love means , - their chief desire is for conquest , - and failing in this , they run up the gamut of baffled passion to the pitch of frenetic hysteria , which with some becomes chronic . Lady Sibyl suffers in this way . Now listen to me . I will go off to Paris or Moscow or Berlin at once , - after what has happened , of course I can not stay here , - and I give you my word I will not intrude myself into your domestic circle again . In a few days you will tide over this rupture , and learn the wisdom of supporting the differences that occur in matrimony , with composure - - "
155772	155782	155783	155783	I	0	" Impossible ! I will not part with you ! "
155787	155809	155783	155783	I	0	" Nor will I live with her ! Better the companionship of a true friend than that of a false wife ! "
155861	155997	155837	155837	he	2755	" Upon my word , you put me in a very awkward position Geoffrey , - what is to be done ? You can get a judicial separation if you like , but I think it would be an unwise course of procedure after barely four months of marriage . The world would be set talking at once . Really it is better to do anything than give the gossips a chance for floating scandal . Look here - do n't decide anything hastily , - come up to town with me for a day , and leave your wife alone to meditate upon her foolishness and its possible consequences , - then you will be better able to judge as to your future movements . Go to your room , and sleep till morning . "
155998	156001	156002	156002	I	0	" Sleep ! "
156008	156016	156002	156002	I	0	" In that room where she - - "
156029	156084	156017	156017	I	0	" Am I going mad , I wonder ! My brain seems on fire ! If I could forget ! ... if I could forget ! Lucio - if you , my loyal friend , had been false to me I should have died , - your truth , your honour have saved me ! "
156095	156105	156107	156107	he	2757	" Tut - - I make no boast of virtue "
156110	156222	156107	156107	he	2757	" If the lady 's beauty had been any temptation to me I might have yielded to her charms , - in so doing I should have been no more than man , as she herself suggested . But perhaps I am more than man ! - at anyrate bodily beauty in woman makes no sort of effect on me , unless it is accompanied by beauty of soul , - then it does make an effect , and a very extraordinary one . It provokes me to try how deep the beauty goes - whether it is impervious or vulnerable . As I find it , so I leave it ! "
156234	156241	156242	156242	I	0	" What am I to do ? "
156245	156251	156242	156242	I	0	" What would you advise ? "
156252	156260	156262	156262	he	2758	" Come up to town with me , "
156265	156330	156262	156262	he	2758	" You can leave a note for your wife , explaining your absence , - and at one of the clubs we will talk over the matter quietly , and decide how best to avoid a social scandal . Meanwhile , go to bed . If you wo n't go back to your own room , sleep in the spare one next to mine . "
156345	156359	156360	156360	he	2758	" Will you take a composing draught if I mix it for you ? "
156363	156378	156360	156360	he	2758	" It is harmless , and will give you a few hours ' sleep . "
156379	156388	156389	156389	I	0	" I would take poison from your hand ! "
156393	156421	156389	156389	I	0	" Why do n't you mix that for me ? - and then , ... then I should sleep indeed , - and forget this horrible night ! "
156422	156432	156433	156433	he	2758	" No , - unfortunately you would not forget ! "
156459	156560	156563	156563	he	2758	" That is the worst of what people call dying . I must instruct you in a little science by - and - by , to distract your thoughts . The scientific part of death , - the business that goes on behind the scenes you know - will interest you very much - it is highly instructive , particularly that section of it which I am entitled to call the regeneration of atoms . The brain - cells are atoms , and within these , are other atoms called memories , curiously vital and marvellously prolific ! Drink this , "
156572	156610	156563	156563	he	2758	" For temporary purposes it is much better than death - because it does numb and paralyse the conscious atoms for a little while , whereas death only liberates them to a larger and more obstinate vitality . "
156661	156672	156674	156674	he	2758	" Throw yourself on that bed and close your eyes , "
156681	156692	156674	156674	he	2758	" Till morning breaks I give you a respite , - "
156698	156734	156694	156694	he	2758	" both from dreams and memories ! Plunge into Oblivion , my friend ! - brief as it is and as it must ever be , it is sweet ! - even to a millionaire ! "
157592	157603	157605	157605	Lucio	124	" I am truly very much distressed about all this ; "
157614	157639	157605	157605	Lucio	124	" It seems to me that I am the adverse element in the affair . If Lady Sibyl had never seen me , - - "
157640	157651	157652	157652	I	0	" Why , then I should never have seen her ! "
157656	157666	157652	157652	I	0	" It was through you I met her first . "
157667	157670	157672	157672	he	124	" True ! "
157677	157710	157711	157711	He	124	" I am very unfortunately placed ! - it is almost as if I were to blame , though no - one could be more innocent or well - intentioned than myself ! "
157721	157765	157711	157711	He	124	" I really should avoid scandalous gossip if I were you , - I do not speak of my own involuntary share in the disaster , - what people say of me is quite immaterial ; but for the lady 's sake - - "
157766	157778	157779	157779	I	0	" For my own sake I shall try to avoid it ; "
157789	157818	157779	157779	I	0	" It is myself I have to consider most of all . I shall , as I hinted to you this morning , travel for a few years . "
157819	157833	157835	157835	he	124	" Yes , - go on a tiger - hunting expedition in India , "
157838	157869	157835	157835	he	124	" Or kill elephants in Africa . It is what a great many men do when their wives forget themselves . Several well - known husbands are abroad just now ! "
157924	157933	157935	157935	he	124	" Come and winter with me in Egypt , "
157938	157990	157935	157935	he	124	" Come in my yacht ' The Flame , ' - we will take her to Alexandria , - and then do the Nile in a dahabeah , and forget that such frivolous dolls as women exist except to be played with by us ' superior ' creatures and thrown aside . "
157991	157998	157999	157999	I	0	" Egypt - - the Nile ! "
158009	158017	157999	157999	I	0	" Yes , - - why not ? "
158018	158023	158024	158024	he	124	" Why not indeed ! "
158027	158081	158024	158024	he	124	" The proposal is agreeable to you I am sure . Come and see the land of the old gods , - the land where my princess used to live and torture the souls of men ! - perhaps we may discover the remains of her last victim , - - who knows ! "
158467	158470	158464	158465	Mavis Clare	200	" Differences . "

158608	158641	158595	158595	he	124	" Considering the effect a perfectly innocent woman has on the mind of even an evil man , it 's strange , is n't it that there are so few of them ! "
158647	158653	158654	158654	he	124	" In the present day , "
158658	158857	158654	158654	he	124	" there are a number of females clamouring like unnatural hens in a barn - yard about their ' rights ' and ' wrongs . ' Their greatest right , their highest privilege , is to guide and guard the souls of men . This , they for the most part , throw away as worthless . Aristocratic women , royal women even , hand over the care of their children to hired attendants and inferiors , and then are surprised and injured if those children turn out to be either fools or blackguards . If I were controller of the State , I would make it a law that every mother should be bound to nurse and guard her children herself as nature intended , unless prevented by ill - health , in which case she would have to get a couple of doctor 's certificates to certify the fact . Otherwise , any woman refusing to comply with the law should be sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour . This would bring them to their senses . The idleness , wickedness , extravagance and selfishness of women , make men the boors and egotists they are . "
158862	158871	158873	158873	I	0	" The devil is in the whole business ; "
158877	158929	158873	158873	I	0	" If women were good , men would have nothing to do with them . Look round you at what is called ' society ' ! How many men there are who deliberately choose tainted women for their wives , and leave the innocent uncared for ! Take Mavis Clare - - "
158930	158943	158944	158944	he	2810	" Oh , you were thinking of Mavis Clare , were you ? "
158954	158992	158944	158944	he	2810	" But she would be a difficult prize for any man to win . She does not seek to be married , - and she is not uncared for , since the whole world cares for her . "
158993	159002	159004	159004	I	0	" That is a sort of impersonal love ; "
159007	159025	159004	159004	I	0	" It does not give her the protection such a woman needs , and ought to obtain . "
159026	159035	159036	159036	he	2810	" Do you want to become her lover ? "
159043	159052	159036	159036	he	2810	" I 'm afraid you 've no chance ! "
159053	159062	159063	159063	I	0	" I ! Her lover ! Good God ! "
159078	159084	159063	159063	I	0	" What a profane idea ! "
159085	159095	159097	159097	he	2810	" You are right , - it is profane ; "
159103	159166	159097	159097	he	2810	" It is as though I should propose your stealing the sacramental cup from a church , with just this difference , - you might succeed in running off with the cup because it is only the church 's property , but you would never succeed in winning Mavis Clare , inasmuch as she belongs to God . You know what Milton says :
159268	159278	159280	159280	he	2810	" That is what you see in Mavis Clare , "
159283	159321	159280	159280	he	2810	" that ' beam on the outward shape ' which ' turns it by degrees to the soul 's essence , ' - and which makes her beautiful , without what is called beauty by lustful men . "
159348	159358	159360	159360	Lucio	124	" Beauty , according to man 's ordinary standard , "
159362	159536	159360	159360	Lucio	124	" means simply good flesh , - nothing more . Flesh , arranged prettily and roundly on the always ugly skeleton beneath , - flesh , daintily coloured and soft to the touch , without scar or blemish . Plenty of it too , disposed in the proper places . It is the most perishable sort of commodity , - an illness spoils it , - a trying climate ruins it , - age wrinkles it , - death destroys it , - but it is all the majority of men look for in their bargains with the fair sex . The most utter roué of sixty that ever trotted jauntily down Piccadilly pretending to be thirty , expects like Shylock his ' pound ' or several pounds of youthful flesh . The desire is neither refined nor intellectual , but there it is , - and it is solely on this account that the ' ladies ' of the music - hall become the tainted members and future mothers of the aristocracy . "
159537	159555	159556	159556	I	0	" It does not need the ladies of the music - hall to taint the already tainted ! "
159559	159562	159564	159564	he	2810	" True ! "
159572	159587	159564	159564	he	2810	" Let us put the whole mischief down to the ' new ' fiction ! "
159691	159696	159698	159698	he	2821	" We will avoid society "
159701	159784	159698	159698	he	2821	" The well - bred , well - educated ' swagger ' people who throw champagne - bottles at the Sphinx , and think a donkey - race ' ripping fun ' shall not have the honour of our company . Cairo is full of such dancing dolls , so we will not stay there . Old Nile has many attractions ; and lazy luxury on a dahabeah will soothe your overwrought nerves . I suggest our leaving England within a week . "

160050	160071	160047	160047	he	124	" Of course you must go . You can catch the four - forty train if you take a hansom . "

160090	160131	160047	160047	he	124	" I 'll stay at the Grand , and wait for news . Do n't delay a moment , - Miss Clare would not have taken it upon herself to send this message , unless there had been serious cause . "

160157	160176	160184	160184	he	124	" I think nothing - I suppose nothing . I only urge you to start immediately . Come ! "
160466	160473	160474	160474	she	200	" It is you at last ! "
160482	160489	160474	160474	she	200	" Thank God you have come ! "

160602	160739	160597	160597	she	200	" Her rooms are locked , and we can not make her hear . Her maid got alarmed , and ran over to my house to ask me what was best to be done , - I came at once , and knocked and called , but could get no response . You know the windows are too high to reach from the ground , - there is no ladder on the premises long enough for the purpose , - and no one can climb up that side of the building . I begged some of the servants to break open the door by force , - but they would not , - they were all afraid ; and I did not like to act on my own responsibility , so I telegraphed for you - - "
160782	160785	160786	160786	I	0	" Sibyl ! "

Bring a strong hammer , - or a crowbar , - anything that will break it open , - if you had had sense you would have obeyed Miss Clare , and done this a couple of hours ago . "
161076	161079	161080	161081	No one	337	" Sibyl ! "

I tell you , go ! "

162269	162356	162264	162264	I	0	" Tell the servants they may count upon expensive mourning , - for all that money can do shall be done in homage to King Death !

I believe in an unknown Force that encompasses me and hunts me down to the grave , but nothing more . She thought as I do , - and with reason , - for what has God done for her ?

163815	165108	165672	165672	she	166	" I have made up my mind to die . Not out of passion or petulance , - but from deliberate choice , and as I think , necessity . My brain is tired of problems , - my body is tired of life ; it is best to make an end . The idea of death , - which means annihilation , - is very sweet to me . I am glad to feel that by my own will and act I can silence this uneasy throbbing of my heart , this turmoil and heat of my blood , - this tortured aching of my nerves . Young as I am , I have no delight now in existence , - I see nothing but my love 's luminous eyes , his god - like features , his enthralling smile , - and these are lost to me . For a brief while he has been my world , life and time , - he has gone , - and without him there is no universe . How could I endure the slow , wretched passing of hours , days , weeks , months and years alone ? - though it is better to be alone than in the dull companionship of the self - satisfied , complacent and arrogant fool who is my husband . He has left me for ever , so he says in a letter the maid brought to me an hour ago . It is quite what I expected of him , - what man of his type could find pardon for a blow to his own amour propre ! If he had studied my nature , entered into my emotions , or striven in the least to guide and sustain me , - if he had shown me any sign of a great , true love such as one sometimes dreams of and seldom finds , - I think I should be sorry for him now , - I should even ask his forgiveness for having married him . But he has treated me precisely as he might treat a paid mistress , - that is , he has fed me , clothed me , and provided me with money and jewels in return for making me the toy of his passions , - but he has not given me one touch of sympathy , - one proof of self - denial or humane forbearance . Therefore , I owe him nothing . And now he , and my love who will not be my lover , have gone away together ; I am free to do as I will with this small pulse within me called life , which is after all , only a thread , easily broken . There is no one to say me nay , or to hold my hand back from giving myself the final quietus . It is well I have no friends ; it is good for me that I have probed the hypocrisy and social sham of the world , and that I have mastered the following hard truths of life , - that there is no love without lust , - no friendship without self - interest , - no religion without avarice , - and no so - called virtue without its accompanying stronger vice . Who , knowing these things , would care to take part in them ! On the verge of the grave I look back along the short vista of my years , and I see myself a child in this very place , this wooded Willowsmere ; I can note how that life began to which I am about to put an end . Pampered , petted and spoilt , told that I must ' look pretty ' and take pleasure in my clothes , I was even at the age of ten , capable of a certain amount of coquetry . Old roués , smelling of wine and tobacco , were eager to take me on their knees and pinch my soft flesh ; - they would press my innocent lips with their withered ones , - withered and contaminated by the kisses of cocottes and ' soiled doves ' of the town ! - I have often wondered how it is these men can dare to touch a young child 's mouth , knowing in themselves what beasts they are ! I see my nurse , - a trained liar and time - server , giving herself more airs than a queen , and forbidding me to speak to this child or that child , because they were ' beneath ' me ; - then came my governess , full of a prurient prudery , as bad a woman in morals as ever lived , yet ' highly recommended ' and with excellent references , and wearing an assumption of the strictest virtue , like many equally hypocritical clergymen 's wives I have known . I soon found her out , - for even as a child I was painfully observant , - and the stories she and my mother 's French maid used to tell , in lowered voices now and then broken by coarse laughter , were sufficient to enlighten me as to her true character . Yet , beyond having a supreme contempt for the woman who practised religious austerity outwardly , and was at heart a rake , I gave small consideration to the difficult problem such a nature suggested . I lived , - how strange it seems that I should be writing now of myself , as past and done with ! - yes , I lived in a dreamy , more or less idyllic state of mind , thinking without being conscious of thought , full of fancies concerning the flowers , trees and birds , - wishing for things of which I knew nothing , - imagining myself a queen at times , and again , a peasant . I was an omnivorous reader , - and I was specially fond of poetry . I used to pore over the mystic verse of Shelley , and judged him then as a sort of demi - god ; - and never , even when I knew all about his life , could I realize him as a man with a thin , shrieking falsetto voice and ' loose ' notions concerning women . But I am quite sure it was good for his fame that he was drowned in early youth with so many melancholy and dramatic surroundings , - it saved him , I consider , from a possibly vicious and repulsive old age . I adored Keats till I knew he had wasted his passion on a Fanny Brawn , - and then the glamour of him vanished . I can offer no reason for this , - I merely set down the fact . I made a hero of Lord Byron , - in fact he has always formed for me the only heroical type of poet . Strong in himself and pitiless in his love for women , he treated them for the most part as they merited , considering the singular and unworthy specimens of the sex it was his misfortune to encounter . I used to wonder , when reading these men 's amorous lines , whether love would ever come my way , and what beatific state of emotion I should then enjoy . Then came the rough awakening from all my dreams , - childhood melted into womanhood , - and at sixteen I was taken up to town with my parents to "
165119	165662	165672	165672	she	166	" before finally ' coming out . ' Oh , those ways and manners ! I learnt them to perfection ! Astonished at first , then bewildered , and allowed no time to form any judgment on what I saw , I was hurried through a general vague ' impression ' of things such as I had never imagined or dreamed of . While I was yet lost in wonderment , and kept constantly in companionship with young girls of my own rank and age , who nevertheless seemed much more advanced in knowledge of the world than I , my father suddenly informed me that Willowsmere was lost to us , - that he could not afford to keep it up , - and that we should return there no more . Ah , what tears I shed ! - what a fury of grief consumed me ! - I did not then comprehend the difficult entanglements of either wealth or poverty ; - all I could realize was that the doors of my dear old home were closed upon me for ever . After that , I think I grew cold and hard in disposition ; I had never loved my mother very dearly , - in fact I had seen very little of her , as she was always away visiting , if not entertaining visitors , and she seldom had me with her , - so that when she was suddenly struck down by a first shock of paralysis , it affected me but little . She had her doctors and nurses , - I had my governess still with me ; and my mother 's sister , Aunt Charlotte , came to keep house for us , - so I began to analyse society for myself , without giving any expression of my opinions on what I observed . I was not yet ' out , ' but I went everywhere where girls of my age were invited , and perceived things without showing that I had any faculty of perception . I cultivated a passionless and cold exterior , - a listless , uninterested and frigid demeanor , - for I discovered that this was accepted by many people as dullness or stupidity , and that by assuming such a character , certain otherwise crafty persons would talk more readily before me , and betray themselves and their vices unawares . Thus my ' social education ' began in grim earnest ; - women of title and renown would ask me to their ' quiet teas , ' because I was what they were pleased to call a ' harmless girl - ' ' rather pretty , but dull , ' - and allow me to assist them in entertaining the lovers who called upon them while their husbands were out . I remember that on one occasion , a great lady famous for two things , her diamonds and her intimacy with the Queen , kissed her ' cavaliere servente , ' a noted sporting earl , with considerable abandon in my presence . He muttered something about me , - I heard it ; - but his amorous mistress merely answered in a whisper - "
165676	165695	165672	165672	she	166	" Afterwards however , when he had gone , she turned to me with a grin and remarked - "
165717	165871	165710	165710	he	225	" I made no reply , - I only smiled vaguely ; and the next day she sent me a valuable diamond ring , which I at once returned to her with a prim little note , stating that I was much obliged , but that my father considered me too young as yet to wear diamonds . Why do I think of these trifles now I wonder ! - now when I am about to take my leave of life and all its lies ! ... There is a little bird singing outside my bedroom window , - such a pretty creature ! I suppose it is happy ? - it should be , as it is not human ... The tears are in my eyes as I listen to its sweet warbling , and think that it will be living and singing still to - day at sunset when I am dead !

I do not remember now what I said to him when I heard this , - I know that my long suppressed feelings broke out in a storm of fury , and that for the moment he was completely taken aback by the force of my indignation . An American boarder in our house ! - it seemed to me as outrageous and undignified as the conduct of a person I once heard of , who , favoured by the Queen 's patronage with ' free ' apartments in Kensington Palace , took from time to time on the sly , an American or Colonial ' paying - guest , ' who adopted forthwith the address of Her Majesty 's birthplace as her own , thus lowering the whole prestige of that historic habitation . My wrath however was useless ; - the bargain was arranged , - my father , regardless of his proud lineage and the social dignity of his position , had degraded himself , in my opinion , to the level of a sort of superior lodging - house keeper , - and from that time I lost all my former respect for him . Of course it can be argued that I was wrong , - that I ought to have honoured him for turning his name to monetary account by loaning it out as a protective shield and panoply for an American woman without anything but the dollars of a vulgar ' railway - king ' to back her up in society , - but I could not see it in that light . I retreated into myself more than ever , - and became more than pleasantly known for my coldness , reserve and hauteur . Miss Chesney came , and strove hard to be my friend , - but she soon found that impossible . She is a good - hearted creature I believe , - but she is badly bred and badly trained as all her compatriots are , more or less , despite their smattering of an European education ; I disliked her from the first , and have spared no pains to show it . Yet I know she will be Countess of Elton as soon as it is decently possible , - say , after the year 's ceremonious mourning for my mother has expired , and perhaps three months ' hypocritical wearing of black for me , - my father believes himself to be still young and passably good - looking , and he is quite incapable of resisting the fortune she will bring him .

170624	171070	170617	170617	Sibyl	166	" I abandoned myself to love and the desire of love . I had heard of him before from my father who had as I learned to my shame been indebted to him for monetary assistance . On the very night we met , my father told me quite plainly that now was my chance to get ' settled ' in life . ' Marry Rimânez or Tempest , whichever you can most easily catch , ' he said - ' The prince is fabulously wealthy - but he keeps up a mystery about himself and no one knows where he actually comes from , - besides which he dislikes women ; - now Tempest has five millions and seems an easy - going fool , - I should say you had better go for Tempest . ' I made no answer and gave no promise either way . I soon found out however that Lucio did not intend to marry , - and I concluded that he preferred to be the lover of many women , instead of the husband of one . I did not love him any the less for this , - I only resolved that I would at least be one of those who were happy enough to share his passion . I married the man Tempest , feeling that like many women I knew , I should when safely wedded , have greater liberty of action , - I was aware that most modern men prefer an amour with a married woman to any other kind of liaison , - and I thought Lucio would have readily yielded to the plan I had pre - conceived . But I was mistaken , - and out of this mistake comes all my perplexity , pain and bewilderment I can not understand why my love , - beloved beyond all word or thought , - should scorn me and repulse me with such bitter loathing ! It is such a common thing now - a - days for a married woman to have her own lover , apart from her husband de convenance ! The writers of books advise it , - I have seen the custom not only excused but advocated over and over again in long and scientific articles that are openly published in leading magazines . Why then should I be blamed or my desires considered criminal ? As long as no public scandal is made , what harm is done ? I can not see it , - it is not as if there were a God to care , - the scientists say there is no God !

The flash of the jewelled serpent round her waist caught my eyes anew as I did this , and I stared for a moment at its green glitter , dumbly fascinated , - then , moving stealthily , with the cold sweat pouring down my back and every pulse in me rendered feeble by sheer horror , I turned to leave the room . As I reached the portiére and lifted it , some instinct made me look back at the dread picture of the leading ' society "

To be missed at all when you die , some one must love you very deeply and unselfishly ; and deep unselfish love is rarer to find among mortals than a pearl in a dust - bin .

180533	180561	180529	180529	I	0	" or a devil ? Which would you say she is ? - you , who sometimes declare that you believe in Heaven , - and Hell ? "
180576	180581	180582	180582	I	0	" Come , speak ! "
180586	180604	180582	180582	I	0	" You can be frank with me , you know , - angel or devil - which ? "
180605	180610	180611	180611	he	124	" My dear Geoffrey ! "
180618	180632	180611	180611	he	124	" A woman is always an angel , - both here and hereafter ! "
180637	180651	180633	180633	I	0	" If that is part of your faith I am sorry for you ! "
180652	180661	180663	180663	he	124	" I have not spoken of my faith , "
180678	180700	180663	180663	he	124	" I am not a Salvationist , that I should bray forth a creed to the sound of trump and drum . "
180701	180711	180713	180713	I	0	" All the same , you have a creed ; "
180716	180740	180713	180713	I	0	" And I fancy it must be a strange one ! If you remember , you promised to explain it to me - - "
180741	180751	180752	180752	he	124	" Are you ready to receive such an explanation ? "
180760	180874	180752	180752	he	124	" No , my dear friend ! - permit me to say you are not ready - not yet ! My beliefs are too positive to be brought even into contact with your contradictions , - too frightfully real to submit to your doubts for a moment . You would at once begin to revert to the puny , used - up old arguments of Voltaire , Schopenhauer and Huxley , - little atomic theories like grains of dust in the whirlwind of My knowledge ! I can tell you I believe in God as a very Actual and Positive Being , - and that is presumably the first of the Church articles . "
180875	180881	180882	180882	I	0	" You believe in God ! "
180960	180982	180951	180951	she	3256	" I hate people who believe in God , do n't you ? The idea of a God makes me sick ! "
180983	180989	180990	180990	I	0	" You believe in God ! "
180995	180998	180999	180999	he	124	" Look ! "
181009	181031	181033	181033	he	124	" There a few drifting clouds cover millions of worlds , impenetrable , mysterious , yet actual ; - down there - "
181039	181157	181033	181033	he	124	" lurk a thousand things of which , though the ocean is a part of earth , human beings have not yet learned the nature . Between these upper and lower spaces of the Incomprehensible yet Absolute , you , a finite atom of limited capabilities stand , uncertain how long the frail thread of your life shall last , yet arrogantly balancing the question with your own poor brain , as to whether you , - you in your utter littleness and incompetency shall condescend to accept a God or not ! I confess , that of all astonishing things in the Universe , this particular attitude of modern mankind is the most astonishing to me ! "
181158	181166	181244	181244	He	124	" Your own attitude is ? - - "
181167	181182	181183	181183	he	124	" The reluctant acceptance of such terrific knowledge as is forced upon me , - "
181190	181217	181183	181183	he	124	" I do not say I have been an apt or a willing pupil , - I have had to suffer in learning what I know ! "
181218	181225	181226	181226	I	0	" Do you believe in hell ? "
181231	181243	181226	181226	I	0	" And in Satan , the Arch - Enemy of mankind ? "
181309	181403	181288	181288	he	124	" Most assuredly I believe in hell ! How can I do otherwise if I believe in heaven ? If there is an Up there must be a Down ; if there is Light , there must also be Darkness ! And , ... concerning the Arch - Enemy of mankind , - if half the stories reported of him be true , he must be the most piteous and pitiable figure in the Universe ! What would be the sorrows of a thousand million worlds , compared to the sorrows of Satan ! "
181404	181407	181408	181408	I	0	" Sorrows ! "
181411	181423	181408	181408	I	0	" He is supposed to rejoice in the working of evil ! "
181424	181433	181435	181435	he	124	" Neither angel nor devil can do that , "
181439	181476	181435	181435	he	124	" To rejoice in the working of evil is a temporary mania which affects man only . For actual joy to come out of evil , Chaos must come again , and God must extinguish Himself . "
181499	181691	181694	181694	he	3260	" And so I again say - the sorrows of Satan ! Sorrows immeasurable as eternity itself , - imagine them ! To be shut out of Heaven ! - to hear all through the unending æons , the far - off voices of angels whom once he knew and loved ! - to be a wanderer among deserts of darkness , and to pine for the light celestial that was formerly as air and food to his being , - and to know that Man 's folly , Man 's utter selfishness , Man 's cruelty , keep him thus exiled , an outcast from pardon and peace ! Man 's nobleness may lift the Lost Spirit almost within reach of his lost joys , - but Man 's vileness drags him down again , - easy was the torture of Sisyphus compared with the torture of Satan ! No wonder that he loathes Mankind ! - small blame to him if he seeks to destroy the puny tribe eternally , - little marvel that he grudges them their share of immortality ! Think of it as a legend merely , "
181706	181729	181694	181694	he	3260	" Christ redeemed Man , - and by his teaching , showed how it was possible for Man to redeem the Devil ! "
181730	181737	181738	181738	I	0	" I do not understand you - "
181753	181891	181738	181738	I	0	" Do you not ? Yet my meaning is scarcely obscure ! If men were true to their immortal instincts and to the God that made them , - if they were generous , honest , fearless , faithful , reverent , unselfish , ... if women were pure , brave , tender and loving , - can you not imagine that in the strong force and fairness of such a world , ' Lucifer , son of the Morning ' would be moved to love instead of hate ? - that the closed doors of Paradise would be unbarred - and that he , lifted towards his Creator on the prayers of pure lives , would wear again his Angel 's crown ? Can you not realize this , even by way of a legendary story ? "
181892	181905	181907	181907	I	0	" Why yes , as a legendary story the idea is beautiful , "
181910	181954	181907	181907	I	0	" And to me , as I told you once before , quite new . Still , as men are never likely to be honest or women pure , I 'm afraid the poor devil stands a bad chance of ever getting redeemed ! "
181955	181961	181963	181963	he	3261	" I fear so too ! "
181971	182001	182002	182002	He	3261	" I very much fear so ! And his chances being so slight , I rather respect him for being the Arch - Enemy of such a worthless race ! "
182010	182078	182002	182002	He	3261	" I wonder how we have managed to get on such an absurd subject of conversation ? It is dull and uninteresting as all ' spiritual ' themes invariably are . My object in bringing you out on this voyage is not to indulge in psychological argument , but to make you forget your troubles as much as possible , and enjoy the present while it lasts . "
182116	182121	182123	182123	I	0	" Truly I have suffered "
182126	182132	182123	182123	I	0	" More than most men ! "
182133	182143	182145	182145	Lucio	124	" More even than most millionaires deserve to suffer ! "
182161	182242	182145	182145	Lucio	124	" Money is supposed to make amends to a man for everything , - and even the wealthy wife of a certain Irish ' patriot ' has not found it incompatible with affection to hold her moneybags close to herself while her husband has been declared a bankrupt . How she has ' idolized ' him , let others say ! Now , considering your cash - abundance , it must be owned the fates have treated you somewhat unkindly ! "
182740	182796	182737	182737	I	0	" If one could only see these ancient cities as they once existed , what strange revelations might be made ! Our modern marvels of civilization and progress might seem small trifles after all , - for I believe in our days we are only re - discovering what the peoples of old time knew . "
182822	182832	182833	182833	he	124	" Would you like to see a city resuscitated ? "
182836	182938	182833	182833	he	124	" Here , in this very spot , some six thousand years ago , a king reigned , with a woman not his queen but his favourite , quite a lawful arrangement in those days who was as famous for her beauty and virtue , as this river is for its fructifying tide . Here civilization had progressed enormously , - with the one exception that it had not outgrown faith . Modern France and England have beaten the ancients in their scorn of God and creed , their contempt for divine things , their unnameable lasciviousness and blasphemy . This city "
182969	183086	182942	182942	he	124	" was governed by the strong pure faith of its people more than anything , - and the ruler of social things in it was a woman . The king 's favourite was something like Mavis Clare in that she possessed genius , - she had also the qualities of justice , intelligence , love , truth and a most noble unselfishness , - she made this place happy . It was a paradise on earth while she lived , - when she died , its glory ended . So much can a woman do if she chooses , - so much does she not do , in her usual cow - like way of living ! "
183087	183099	183100	183100	I	0	" How do you know all this you tell me of ? "
183104	183110	183112	183112	he	3277	" By study of past records "
183115	183224	183112	183112	he	3277	" I read what modern men declare they have no time to read . You are right in the idea that all ' new ' things are only old things re - invented or re - discovered , - if you had gone a step further and said that some of men 's present lives are only the continuation of their past , you would not have been wrong . Now , if you like , I can by my science , show you the city that stood here long ago , - the ' City Beautiful ' as its name is , translated from the ancient tongue . "
183244	183252	183253	183253	I	0	" You can show it to me ! "
183256	183266	183253	183253	I	0	" How can you do such an impossible thing ? "
183267	183274	183276	183276	he	3277	" Permit me to hypnotize you , "
183281	183333	183276	183276	he	3277	" My system of hypnotism is , very fortunately , not yet discovered by meddlesome inquirers into occult matters , - but it never fails of its effect , - and I promise you , you shall , under my influence , see not only the place , but the people . "
183365	183371	183372	183372	I	0	" I am perfectly willing ! "
183375	183402	183372	183372	I	0	" All the same , I do n't think you can hypnotize me , - I have much too strong a will of my own - - "
183420	183428	183417	183417	his	3278	" But you can make the attempt . "
183443	183450	183451	183451	he	3278	" Stop the dahabeah , Azimah , "
183454	183463	183451	183451	he	3278	" We will rest here for the night . "
184373	184388	184389	184389	I	0	" Lift , oh lift the shrouding veil , Spirit of the City Beautiful ! "
184393	184408	184389	184389	I	0	" For I feel I shall read in your eyes the secret of happiness ! "
184550	184555	184556	184556	I	0	" Where is she ? "
184559	184564	184556	184556	I	0	" Who is she ? "
184590	184596	184597	184597	I	0	" I saw it all ! "
184600	184628	184597	184597	I	0	" The city - the priests , - the people - the King ! - - all but Her face ! Why was that hidden from me ! "
184646	184676	184677	184677	he	124	" What a ' find ' you would be to a first - class ' spiritual ' impostor playing his tricks in cultured and easily - gulled London society ! "
184680	184691	184677	184677	he	124	" You seem most powerfully impressed by a passing vision ! "
184692	184700	184701	184701	I	0	" Do you mean to tell me , "
184704	184722	184639	184639	Lucio	124	" that what I saw just now was the mere thought of your brain conveyed to mine ? "
184723	184726	184727	184727	he	124	" Precisely ! "
184730	184790	184727	184727	he	124	" I know what the ' City Beautiful ' was like , and I was able to draw it for you on the canvas of my memory and present it as a complete picture to your inward sight . For you have an inward sight , - though like most people , you live unconscious of that neglected faculty . "
184791	184798	184799	184799	I	0	" But - who was She ? "
184803	184871	184727	184727	he	124	" ' She ' was , I presume , the King 's favourite . If she kept her face hidden from you as you complain , I am sorry ! - but I assure you it was not my fault ! Get to bed , Geoffrey , - you look dazed . You take visions badly , - yet they are better than realities , believe me ! "
185312	185322	185323	185323	he	124	" A dancer at the court of Queen Amenartes ; "
185341	185424	185426	185426	he	124	" Who because of her many sins , and secret guilt which made her life unbearable , and her days full of corruption , died of poison administered by her own hand , according to the King 's command , and in presence of the executioners of law . Such is the lady 's story , - condensed ; - there are a good many other details of course . She appears to have been only in her twentieth year . Well ! "
185438	185480	185426	185426	he	124	" We may congratulate ourselves on having progressed since the days of these over - strict ancient Egyptians ! The sins of dancers are not , with us , taken au grand serieux ! Shall we see what she is like ? "
185713	185724	185725	185725	he	3340	" The sun is too strong for you I fear ? "
185729	185737	185725	185725	he	3340	" This climate does not suit everybody . "
185797	185810	185812	185812	he	124	" This , I imagine must be the fair dancer 's portrait , "
185829	185861	185812	185812	he	124	" Quite a treasure - trove ! An admirable piece of ancient workmanship , besides being the picture of a very lovely woman . Do you not think so , Geoffrey ? "

185959	186003	185955	185955	he	124	" Yes , - I noticed it at once . But that should not affect you . History repeats itself , - why should not lovely women repeat themselves ? Beauty always has its double somewhere , either in the past or future . "

190252	190424	190249	190249	he	3406	" And never let them dare to say they are not free to choose ! From the uttermost reaches of high Heaven the Spirit of God descended to them as Man , - from the uttermost depths of lowest Hell , I , the Spirit of Rebellion , come , - equally as Man ! But the God - in - Man was rejected and slain , - I , the Devil - in - Man live on , forever accepted and adored ! Man 's choice this is - not God 's or mine ! Were this self - seeking human race once to reject me utterly , I should exist no more as I am , - nor would they exist who are with me . Listen , while I trace your career ! - it is a copy of the lives of many men ; - and judge how little the powers of Heaven can have to do with you ! - how much the powers of Hell ! "
190443	190750	190943	190943	he	3408	" You , Geoffrey Tempest , are a man in whom a Thought of God was once implanted , - that subtle fire or note of music out of heaven called Genius . So great a gift is rarely bestowed on any mortal , - and woe betide him , who having received it , holds it as of mere personal value , to be used for Self and not for God ! Divine laws moved you gently in the right path of study , - the path of suffering , of disappointment , of self - denial and poverty , - for only by these things is humanity made noble and trained in the ways of perfection . Through pain and enduring labour the soul is armed for battle , and strengthened for conquest . For it is more difficult to bear a victory well , than to endure many buffetings of war ! But you , - you resented Heaven 's good - will towards you , - the Valley of Humiliation suited you not at all . Poverty maddened you , - starvation sickened you . Yet poverty is better than arrogant wealth , - and starvation is healthier than self - indulgence ! You could not wait , - your own troubles seemed to you enormous , - your own efforts laudable and marvellous , - the troubles and efforts of others were nothing to you ; - you were ready to curse God and die . Compassionating yourself , admiring yourself and none other , with a heart full of bitterness , and a mouth full of cursing , you were eager to make quick havoc of both your genius and your soul . For this cause , your millions of money came - - and , - so did I ! "
190780	190925	190943	190943	he	3408	" O fool ! - in my very coming I warned you ! - on the very day we met I told you I was not what I seemed ! God 's elements crashed a menace when we made our compact of friendship ! And I , - when I saw the faint last struggle of the not quite torpid soul in you to resist and distrust me , did I not urge you to let that better instinct have its way ? You , - jester with the Supernatural ! - you , - base scoffer at Christ ! A thousand hints have been given you , - a thousand chances of doing such good as must have forced me to leave you , - as would have brought me a welcome respite from sorrow , - a moment 's cessation of torture ! "
190946	191058	190943	190943	he	3408	" Now learn from me the weaving of the web you so willingly became entangled in ! Your millions of money were Mine ! - the man that left you heir to them , was a wretched miser , evil to the soul 's core ! By virtue of his own deeds he and his dross were Mine ! and maddened by the sheer accumulation of world 's wealth , he slew himself in a fit of frenzy . He lives again in a new and much more realistic phase of existence , and knows the actual value of mankind 's cash - payments ! This you have yet to learn ! "
191074	191764	191059	191059	He	3408	" Wealth is like Genius , - bestowed not for personal gratification , but for the benefit of those who lack it . What have you done for your fellow - men ? The very book you wrote and launched upon the tide of bribery and corruption was published with the intention to secure applause for Yourself , not to give help or comfort to others . Your marriage was prompted by Lust and Ambition , and in the fair Sensuality you wedded , you got your deserts ! No love was in the union , - it was sanctified by the blessing of Fashion , but not the blessing of God . You have done without God ; so you think ! Every act of your existence has been for the pleasure and advancement of Yourself , - and this is why I have chosen you out to hear and see what few mortals ever hear or see till they have passed the dividing - line between this life and the next . I have chosen you because you are a type of the apparently respected and unblamable man ; - you are not what the world calls a criminal , - you have murdered no - one , - you have stolen no neighbour 's goods - , your unchastities and adulteries are those of every ' fashionable ' vice - monger , - and your blasphemies against the Divine are no worse than those of the most approved modern magazine - contributors . You are guilty nevertheless of the chief crime of the age - Sensual Egotism - the blackest sin known to either angels or devils , because hopeless . The murderer may repent , and save a hundred lives to make up for the one he snatched , - the thief may atone with honest labour , - the adulterer may scourge his flesh and do grim penance for late pardon , - the blasphemer may retrieve his blasphemies , - but for the Egoist there is no chance of wholesome penitence , since to himself he is perfect , and counts his Creator as somewhat inferior . This present time of the world breathes Egotism , - the taint of Self , the hideous worship of money , corrodes all life , all thought , all feeling . For vulgar cash , the fairest and noblest scenes of Nature are wantonly destroyed without public protest , 5 - the earth , created in beauty , is made hideous , - parents and children , wives and husbands are ready to slay each other for a little gold , - Heaven is barred out , - God is denied , - and Destruction darkens over this planet , known to all angels as the Sorrowful Star ! Be no longer blind , millionaire whose millions have ministered to Self without relieving sorrow ! - - for when the world is totally corrupt , - when Self is dominant , - when cunning supersedes honesty , - when gold is man 's chief ambition , - when purity is condemned , - when poets teach lewdness , and scientists blasphemy , - when love is mocked , and God forgotten , - the End is near ! I take My part in that end ! - for the souls of mankind are not done with when they leave their fleshly tenements ! When this planet is destroyed as a bubble broken in the air , the souls of men and women live on , - as the soul of the woman you loved lives on , - as the soul of the mother who bore her , lives on , - aye ! - as all My worshippers live on through a myriad worlds , a myriad phases , till they learn to shape their destinies for Heaven ! And I , with them live on , in many shapes , in many ways ! - when they return to God cleansed and perfect , so shall I return ! - but not till then ! "
191786	191789	191765	191765	He	3409	" Ahrimanes ! "
191839	191845	191846	191846	he	3409	" You thought me friend ! "
191849	191963	191846	191846	he	3409	" You should have known me Foe ! For everyone who flatters a man for his virtues , or humours him in his vices is that man 's worst enemy , whether demon or angel ! But you judged me a fitting comrade , - hence I was bound to serve you , - I and my followers with me . You had no perception to realize this , - you , supreme scorner of the Supernatural ! Little did you think of the terrifying agencies that worked the wonders of your betrothal feast at Willowsmere ! Little did you dream that fiends prepared the costly banquet and poured out the luscious wine ! "
191995	191998	191999	191999	he	3410	" Aye ! "
192002	192073	191999	191999	he	3410	" The festival was fitted to the time of the world to - day ! - Society , gorging itself blind and senseless , and attended by a retinue from Hell ! My servants looked like men ! - for truly there is little difference ' twixt man and devil ! ' Twas a brave gathering ! - England has never seen so strange a one in all her annals ! "
192120	192132	192133	192133	he	3410	" What a grotesque creation you men have made of Me ! "
192136	192422	192133	192133	he	3410	" As grotesque as your conception of God ! With what trifling human attributes you have endowed me ! Know you not that the changeless , yet ever - changing Essence of Immortal Life can take a million million shapes and yet remain unalterably the same ? Were I as hideous as your Churches figure me , - could the eternal beauty with which all angels are endowed , ever change to such loathsomeness as haunts mankind 's distorted imaginations , perchance it would be well , - for none would make of me their comrade , and none would cherish me as friend ! As fits each separate human nature , so seems my image , - for thus is my fate and punishment commanded . Yet even in this mask of man I wear , men own me their superior , - think you not that when the Supreme Spirit of God wore that same mask on earth , men did not know Him for their Master ? Yea , they did know ! - and knowing , murdered Him , - as they ever strive to murder all divine things as soon as their divinity is recognised . Face to face I stood with Him upon the mountain - top , and there fulfilled my vow of temptation . Worlds and kingdoms , supremacies and powers ! - - what were they to the Ruler of them all ! ' Get thee hence , Satan ! ' said the golden - sounding Voice ; - ah ! - glorious behest ! - happy respite ! - for I reached the very gate of Heaven that night , and heard the angels sing ! "
192432	192445	192446	192446	he	3411	" What have your teachers done with me and my eternal sorrows ? "
192450	192650	192446	192446	he	3411	" Have not they , and the unthinking churches , proclaimed a lie against me , saying that I rejoice in evil ? O man to whom , by God 's will and because the world 's end draws nigh , I unveil a portion of the mystery of my doom , learn now once and for all , that there is no possible joy in evil ! - it is the despair and the discord of the Universe , - it is Man 's creation , - My torment , - God 's sorrow ! Every sin of every human being adds weight to my torture , and length to my doom , - yet my oath against the world must be kept ! I have sworn to tempt , - to do my uttermost to destroy mankind , - but man has not sworn to yield to my tempting . He is free ! - let him resist and I depart ; - let him accept me , I remain ! Eternal Justice has spoken , - Humanity , through the teaching of God made human , must work out its own redemption , - and Mine ! "
192672	192678	192679	192679	he	3412	" Come with me now ! "
192693	192761	192679	192679	he	3412	" Come ! - for the veil is down for you to - night ! You shall understand with WHOM you have dwelt so long in your shifting cloud - castle of life ! - and in What company you have sailed perilous seas ! - one , who proud and rebellious , like you , errs less , in that he owns GOD as his Master ! "

193466	193483	193460	193463	the great sad Voice	3434	" Onward where never man hath trod , - steer on to the world 's end ! "
194545	194552	194554	194556	the commanding Voice	3471	" Lo , here we pause ! "
194558	194689	194554	194556	the commanding Voice	3471	" Here , where the distorted shape of Man hath never cast a shadow ! - here , - where the arrogant mind of Man hath never conceived a sin ! - here , where the godless greed of Man hath never defaced a beauty , or slain a woodland thing ! - here , the last spot on earth left untainted by Man 's presence ! Here is the world 's end ! - when this land is found , and these shores profaned , - when Mammon plants its foot upon this soil , - then dawns the Judgment - Day ! But , until then , ... here , where only God doth work perfection , angels may look down undismayed , and even fiends find rest ! "
194757	194764	194765	194765	he	3473	" Man , deceive not thyself ! "
194768	195084	194765	194765	he	3473	" Think not the terrors of this night are the delusion of a dream or the snare of a vision ! Thou art awake , - not sleeping , - thou art flesh as well as spirit ! This place is neither hell nor heaven nor any space between , - it is a corner of thine own world on which thou livest . Wherefore know from henceforth that the Supernatural Universe in and around the Natural is no lie , - but the chief Reality , inasmuch as God surroundeth all ! Fate strikes thine hour , - and in this hour ' tis given thee to choose thy Master . Now , by the will of God , thou seest me as Angel ; - but take heed thou forget not that among men I am as Man ! In human form I move with all humanity through endless ages , - to kings and counsellors , to priests and scientists , to thinkers and teachers , to old and young , I come in the shape their pride or vice demands , and am as one with all . Self finds in me another Ego ; - but from the pure in heart , the high in faith , the perfect in intention , I do retreat with joy , offering naught save reverence , demanding naught save prayer ! So am I , - so must I ever be , - till Man of his own will releases and redeems me . Mistake me not , but know me ! - and choose thy Future for truth 's sake and not out of fear ! Choose and change not in any time hereafter , - this hour , this moment is thy last probation , - choose , I say ! Wilt thou serve Self and Me ? or God only ? "
