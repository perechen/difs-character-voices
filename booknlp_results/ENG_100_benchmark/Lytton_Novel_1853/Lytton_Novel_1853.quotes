205	207	200	201	Mr. Squills	412	" Times "
226	234	223	223	his	412	" the state of the money market , "
277	294	273	273	his	412	" how to buy in at the cheapest in order to sell out at the dearest . "
301	327	295	297	MR . CAXTON	409	" It must have been a monstrous long journey . It would be somewhere hereabouts , I take it , that they would split off . "
351	359	339	339	she	1473	" Who split off , my dear ? "
360	366	368	369	my father	1479	" Bless me , Kitty , "
375	451	368	369	my father	1479	" you ask just the question which it is most difficult to answer . An ingenious speculator on races contends that the Danes , whose descendants make the chief part of our northern population and indeed , if his hypothesis could be correct , we must suppose all the ancient worshippers of Odin , are of the same origin as the Etrurians . And why , Kitty , - I just ask you , why ? "
471	476	478	479	my father	1479	" Because , forsooth , "
484	523	478	479	my father	1479	" because the Etrurians called their gods the ' AEsar , ' and the Scandinavians called theirs the ' AEsir , ' or ' Aser ' ! And where do you think this adventurous scholar puts their cradle ? "
524	527	529	530	my mother	1473	" Cradle ! "
534	542	529	530	my mother	1473	" it must be in the nursery . "
548	563	565	566	my father	1479	" Exactly , - in the nursery of the human race , just here , "
572	739	565	566	my father	1479	" bounded , you see , by the river Halys , and in that region which , taking its name from Ees , or As a word designating light or fire , has been immemorially called Asia . Now , Kitty , from Ees , or As , our ethnological speculator would derive not only Asia , the land , but AEsar , or Aser , its primitive inhabitants . Hence he supposes the origin of the Etrurians and the Scandinavians . But if we give him so much , we must give him more , and deduce from the same origin the Es of the Celt and the Ized of the Persian , and - what will be of more use to him , I dare say , poor man , than all the rest put together - the AEs of the Romans , - that is , the God of Copper - money - a very powerful household god he is to this day ! "
761	765	767	768	my father	1479	" So perhaps , "
770	833	835	836	Mr. Caxton	409	" and not unconformably with sacred records , from one great parent horde came all those various tribes , carrying with them the name of their beloved Asia ; and whether they wandered north , south , or west , exalting their own emphatic designation of ' Children of the Land of Light ' into the title of gods . And to think "
853	898	835	836	Mr. Caxton	409	" to think how little they changed for the better when they got to the Don , or entangled their rafts amidst the icebergs of the Baltic , - so comfortably off as they were here , if they could but have stayed quiet . "
899	908	910	911	Mr. Squills	412	" And why the deuce could not they ? "
913	928	930	931	my father	1479	" Pressure of population , and not enough to live upon , I suppose , "
937	950	933	933	PISISTRATUS	420	" More probably they did away with the Corn Laws , sir . "
951	954	956	957	my father	1479	" Papae ! "
959	969	956	957	my father	1479	" that throws a new light on the subject . "
989	1070	956	957	my father	1479	" I know that if we are to lose L500 every year on a farm which we hold rent - free , and which the best judges allow to be a perfect model for the whole country , we had better make haste and turn AEsir , or Aser , or whatever you call them , and fix a settlement on the property of other nations , otherwise , I suspect , our probable settlement will be on the parish . "
1088	1101	1082	1086	an enthusiastic Free - trader	1489	" You have only got to put more capital on the land . "
1105	1137	1102	1102	PISISTRATUS	420	" Well , Mr. Squills , as you think so well of that investment , put your capital on it . I promise that you shall have every shilling of profit . "
1145	1147	1140	1140	SQUILLS	412	" Times "
1149	1175	1138	1139	MR .	1490	" I do n't think the Great Western can fall any lower , though it is hazardous ; I can but venture a few hundreds - "
1179	1190	1176	1176	PISISTRATUS	420	" On our land , Squills ? - Thank you . "
1196	1211	1191	1193	MR . SQUILLS	412	" No , no , - anything but that ; on the Great Western . "
1237	1323	1232	1234	MR . CAXTON	409	" There are two golden rules of life ; one relates to the mind , and the other to the pockets . The first is , If our thoughts get into a low , nervous , aguish condition , we should make them change the air ; the second is comprised in the proverb , ' It is good to have two strings to one 's bow . ' Therefore , Pisistratus , I tell you what you must do , - Write a book ! "
1327	1365	1324	1324	PISISTRATUS	420	" Write a book ! Against the abolition of the Corn Laws ? Faith , sir , the mischief 's done ! It takes a much better pen than mine to write down an act of parliament . "
1371	1394	1366	1368	MR . CAXTON	409	" I only said , ' Write a book . ' All the rest is the addition of your own headlong imagination . "
1408	1423	1395	1395	PISISTRATUS	420	" Indeed , sir , I should think that that would just finish us ! "
1435	1596	1424	1426	MR . CAXTON	409	" A book that will sell ; a book that will prop up the fall of prices ; a book that will distract your mind from its dismal apprehensions , and restore your affection to your species and your hopes in the ultimate triumph of sound principles - by the sight of a favourable balance at the end of the yearly accounts . It is astonishing what a difference that little circumstance makes in our views of things in general . I remember when the bank in which Squills had incautiously left L1000 broke , one remarkably healthy year , that he became a great alarmist , and said that the country was on the verge of ruin ; whereas you see now , when , thanks to a long succession of sickly seasons , he has a surplus capital to risk in the Great Western , he is firmly persuaded that England was never in so prosperous a condition . "
1604	1609	1597	1599	MR . SQUILLS	412	" Pooh , pooh . "
1615	1652	1610	1612	MR . CAXTON	409	" Write a book , my son , - write a book . Need I tell you that Money or Moneta , according to Hyginus , was the mother of the Muses ? Write a book . "
1662	1680	1653	1653	BLANCHE	411	" O yes , Sisty , a book ! a book ! you must write a book . "
1681	1686	1690	1690	Roland	408	" I am sure , "
1701	1760	1690	1690	Roland	408	" he could write a devilish deal better book than this ; and how I come to read such trash night after night is more than I could possibly explain to the satisfaction of any intelligent jury , if I were put into a witness - box , and examined in the mildest manner by my own counsel . "
1766	1783	1761	1763	MR . CAXTON	409	" You see that Roland tells us exactly what sort of a book it shall be . "
1787	1792	1784	1784	PISISTRATUS	420	" Trash , sir ? "
1798	1843	1793	1795	MR . CAXTON	409	" No , - that is , not necessarily trash ; but a book of that class which , whether trash or not , people ca n't help reading . Novels have become a necessity of the age . You must write a novel . "
1849	1921	1844	1844	PISISTRATUS	420	.-"A novel ! But every subject on which novels can be written is preoccupied . There are novels of low life , novels of high life , military novels , naval novels , novels philosophical , novels religious , novels historical , novels descriptive of India , the Colonies , Ancient Rome , and the Egyptian Pyramids . From what bird , wild eagle , or barn - door fowl , can I
1922	1934	1844	1844	PISISTRATUS	420	" ' Pluck one unwearied plume from Fancy 's wing ? ' "
1944	2242	1935	1937	MR . CAXTON	409	" You remember the story which Trevanion I beg his pardon , Lord Ulswater told us the other night ? That gives you something of the romance of real life for your plot , puts you chiefly among scenes with which you are familiar , and furnishes you with characters which have been very sparingly dealt with since the time of Fielding . You can give us the country Squire , as you remember him in your youth ; it is a specimen of a race worth preserving , the old idiosyncrasies of which are rapidly dying off , as the railways bring Norfolk and Yorkshire within easy reach of the manners of London . You can give us the old - fashioned Parson , as in all essentials he may yet be found - but before you had to drag him out of the great Tractarian bog ; and , for the rest , I really think that while , as I am told , many popular writers are doing their best , especially in France , and perhaps a little in England , to set class against class , and pick up every stone in the kennel to shy at a gentleman with a good coat on his back , something useful might be done by a few good - humoured sketches of those innocent criminals a little better off than their neighbours , whom , however we dislike them , I take it for granted we shall have to endure , in one shape or another , as long as civilization exists ; and they seem , on the whole , as good in their present shape as we are likely to get , shake the dice - box of society how we will . "
2246	2272	2534	2536	MRS . CAXTON	440	" Very well said , sir ; but this rural country gentleman life is not so new as you think . There 's Washington Irving - "
2278	2304	2273	2275	MR . CAXTON	409	" Charming ; but rather the manners of the last century than this . You may as well cite Addison and Sir Roger de Coverley . "
2308	2318	2305	2305	PISISTRATUS	420	" ' Tremaine ' and ' De Vere . ' "
2324	2379	2319	2321	MR . CAXTON	409	" Nothing can be more graceful , nor more unlike what I mean . The Pales and Terminus I wish you to put up in the fields are familiar images , that you may cut out of an oak tree , - not beautiful marble statues , on porphyry pedestals , twenty feet high . "
2383	2412	2319	2321	MR . CAXTON	409	" Miss Austen ; Mrs. Gore , in her masterpiece of ' Mrs. Armytage ; ' Mrs. Marsh , too ; and then for Scottish manners Miss Ferrier ! "
2420	2461	2413	2415	MR . CAXTON	409	" Oh , if you can not treat on bucolics but what you must hear some Virgil or other cry ' Stop thief , ' you deserve to be tossed by one of your own ' short - horns . ' "
2466	2533	2413	2415	MR . CAXTON	409	" I am sure I do n't know why we spend so much money on sending our sons to school to learn Latin , when that Anachronism of yours , Mrs. Caxton , ca n't even construe a line and a half of Phaedrus , - Phaedrus , Mrs. Caxton , a book which is in Latin what Goody Two - Shoes is in the vernacular ! "
2542	2557	2534	2536	MRS . CAXTON	440	" Fie ! Austin I I am sure you can construe Phaedrus , dear ! "
2568	2573	2563	2565	MR . CAXTON	409	" I 'll try him -
2574	2585	2534	2536	MRS . CAXTON	440	" ' Sua cuique quum sit animi cogitatio Colurque proprius . '
2586	2592	2563	2565	MR . CAXTON	409	" What does that mean ? "
2596	2614	2593	2593	PISISTRATITS	442	" That every man has some colouring matter within him , to give his own tinge to - "
2615	2620	2622	2623	my father	1479	" His own novel , "
2625	2629	2622	2623	my father	1479	" Contentus peragis ! "
2682	2685	2673	2673	her	1473	" Hush ! "
2744	2761	2763	2764	Parson Dale	445	" There has never been occasion to use them since I 've been in the parish , "
2766	2772	2774	2775	the squire	1498	" What does that prove ? "
2788	2791	2793	2794	Mr. Dale	446	" Prove ! "
2807	2813	2793	2794	Mr. Dale	446	" what does experience prove ? "
2814	2833	2774	2775	the squire	1498	" That your forefathers were great blockheads , and that their descendant is not a whit the wiser . "
2834	2837	2839	2840	the parson	1499	" Squire , "
2842	2894	2839	2840	the parson	1499	" although that is a melancholy conclusion , yet if you mean it to apply universally , and not to the family of the Dales in particular ; it is not one which my candour as a reasoner , and my humility as a mortal , will permit me to challenge . "
2895	2900	2902	2903	Mr. Hazeldean	449	" I defy you , "
2907	2967	2902	2903	Mr. Hazeldean	449	" But to stick to the subject which it is monstrous hard to do when one talks with a parson , I only just ask you to look yonder , and tell me on your conscience - I do n't even say as a parson , but as a parishioner - whether you ever saw a more disreputable spectacle ? "
3018	3022	3024	3025	the parson	1499	" I confess , "
3027	3120	3024	3025	the parson	1499	" that , regarded by the eye of the senses , it is a thing that in its best day had small pretensions to beauty , and is not elevated into the picturesque even by neglect and decay . But , my friend , regarded by the eye of the inner man , - of the rural philosopher and parochial legislator , - I say it is by neglect and decay that it is rendered a very pleasing feature in what I may call ' the moral topography of a parish . ' "
3345	3349	3385	3386	the squire	1498	" a clog , "
3451	3459	3422	3422	itself	1512	" Gather your rosebuds while you may , "
3526	3534	3536	3537	the parson	1499	" Bless me , is it gone ? "
3549	3555	3557	3558	the squire	1498	" Zounds and the devil ! "
3570	3573	3575	3576	the parson	1499	" Hush ! "
3580	3586	3575	3576	the parson	1499	" What a horrible oath ! "
3587	3598	3600	3601	the squire	1498	" Horrible oath ! If you had my nankeens on , "
3607	3629	3600	3601	the squire	1498	" and had fallen into a thicket of thistles , with a donkey 's teeth within an inch of your ear - "
3630	3638	3640	3641	the parson	1499	" It is not gone , then ? "
3643	3654	3656	3657	the squire	1498	" No , - that is , I think not , "
3672	3680	3662	3662	he	1498	" No ! it is not gone ! "
3681	3685	3687	3689	the good clergyman	1525	" Thank Heaven ! "
3693	3696	3698	3699	the squire	1498	" Hum , "
3711	3741	3698	3699	the squire	1498	" Thank Heaven indeed , when I am as full of thorns as a porcupine ! I should just like to know what use thistles are in the world . "
3742	3756	3758	3759	the parson	1499	" For donkeys to eat , if you will let them , Squire , "
3761	3767	3769	3770	Mr. Hazeldean	449	" Ugh , you beast ! "
3816	3822	3823	3823	he	449	" Ugh , you beast ! "
3875	3879	3881	3882	the parson	1499	" Poor thing ! "
3886	3907	3881	3882	the parson	1499	" See , it has a raw place on the shoulder , and the flies have found out the sore . "
3908	3917	3919	3920	the squire	1498	" I am devilish glad to hear it , "
3924	3929	3881	3882	the parson	1499	" Fie , fie ! "
3930	3963	3881	3882	the parson	1499	" It is very well to say ' Fie , fie . ' It was not you who fell among the thistles . What 's the man about now , I wonder ? "
4029	4036	4038	4039	the parson	1499	" I would bet a shilling , "
4043	4070	4038	4039	the parson	1499	" that this is the first act of kindness thou hast met with this many a day . And slight enough it is , Heaven knows . "
4140	4154	4156	4157	the parson	1499	" Nay , in common justice , Lenny Fairfield should have the preference , "
4174	4194	4245	4246	the parson	1499	" But Lenny Fairfield would be as much pleased with twopence ; and what could twopence do to thee ? "
4204	4214	4216	4217	the parson	1499	" Take it , in the name of Charity , "
4219	4228	4230	4231	the ass	1518	" Justice is accustomed to be served last ; "
4236	4243	4245	4246	the parson	1499	" How had you the heart ! "
4267	4280	4255	4256	The ass	1518	" Pooh ! eat on ; he 'll not beat thee now . "
4281	4284	4286	4287	the squire	1498	" No , "
4291	4338	4286	4287	the squire	1498	" But after all , he is not an ass of the parish ; he is a vagrant , and he ought to be pounded . But the pound is in as bad a state as the stocks , thanks to your new - fashioned doctrines . "
4339	4344	4346	4347	the parson	1499	" New - fashioned ! "
4362	4403	4405	4406	the parson	1499	" They are as old as Christianity ; nay , as old as Paradise , which you will observe is derived from a Greek , or rather a Persian word , and means something more than ' garden , ' corresponding "
4410	4441	4405	4406	the parson	1499	" with the Latin - vivarium , - namely , grove or park full of innocent dumb creatures . Depend on it , donkeys were allowed to eat thistles there . "
4442	4446	4448	4449	the squire	1498	" Very possibly , "
4453	4503	4448	4449	the squire	1498	" But Hazeldeau , though a very pretty village , is not Paradise . The stocks shall be mended to - morrow , - ay , and the pound too , and the next donkey found trespassing shall go into it , as sure as my name 's Hazeldean . "
4504	4507	4509	4510	the parson	1499	" Then , "
4514	4540	4509	4510	the parson	1499	" I can only hope that the next parish may not follow your example ; or that you and I may never be caught straying . "
5157	5166	5122	5122	she	452	" of sorrows , but of sorrows past ; "
5213	5217	5230	5231	the parson	1499	" within - doors "
5223	5228	5230	5231	the parson	1499	" Never mind me , "
5246	5274	5234	5235	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" if you are going into the hayfield , I will go with you ; I have something to say to Lenny , - an excellent boy . "
5278	5297	5275	5275	WIDOW	453	" Well , sir , and you are kind to say it , - but so he is . "
5301	5363	5298	5298	PARSON	445	" He reads uncommonly well , he writes tolerably ; he is the best lad in the whole school at his Catechism and in the Bible lessons ; and I assure you , when I see his face at church , looking up so attentively , I fancy that I shall read my sermon all the better for such a listener ! "
5376	5481	5364	5364	WIDOW	453	" ' Deed , sir , when my poor Mark died , I never thought I could have lived on as I have done . But that boy is so kind and good , that when I look at him sitting there in dear Mark 's chair , and remember how Mark loved him , and all he used to say to me about him , I feel somehow or other as if my good man smiled on me , and would rather I was not with him yet , till the lad had grown up , and did not want me any more . "
5492	5504	5482	5482	PARSON	445	" You never hear anything of the old folks at Lansmere ? "
5505	5527	5529	5530	the widow	1592	" ' Deed , sir , sin ' poor Mark died , they han't noticed me nor the boy ; but , "
5539	5565	5529	5530	the widow	1592	" it is n't that I wants their money ; only it 's hard to feel strange like to one 's own father and mother ! "
5569	5621	5566	5566	PARSON	445	" You must excuse them . Your father , Mr. Avenel , was never quite the same man after that sad event which - but you are weeping , my friend , pardon me ; your mother is a little proud ; but so are you , though in another way . "
5625	5658	5622	5622	WIDOW	453	" I proud ! Lord love ye , sir , I have not a bit o ' pride in me ! and that 's the reason they always looked down on me . "
5662	5703	5659	5659	PARSON	445	" Your parents must be well off ; and I shall apply to them in a year or two on behalf of Lenny , for they promised me to provide for him when he grew up , as they ought . "
5710	5749	5704	5704	WIDOW	453	" I am sure , sir , I hope you will do no such thing ; for I would not have Lenny beholden to them as has never given him a kind word sin ' he was born ! "
5822	5844	5813	5813	He	1499	" Well , time enough to think of Lenny 's future prospects ; meanwhile we are forgetting the haymakers . Come . "
5866	5905	5863	5863	PARSON	445	" You have a pleasant place here ; and I see that my friend Lenny should be in no want of apples . I had brought him one , but I have given it away on the road . "
5909	5954	5906	5906	WIDOW	453	" Oh , sir , it is not the deed , - it is the will ; as I felt when the squire , God bless him ! took two pounds off the rent the year he - that is , Mark - died . "
5958	5986	5955	5955	PARSON	445	" If Lenny continues to be such a help to you , it will not be long before the squire may put the two pounds on again . "
5987	5992	5994	5995	the widow	1592	" Yes , sir , "
5999	6005	5994	5995	the widow	1592	" I hope he will . "
6006	6010	6012	6013	the parson	1499	" Silly woman ! "
6015	6045	6012	6013	the parson	1499	" That 's not exactly what the schoolmistress would have said . You do n't read nor write , Mrs. Fairfield ; yet you express yourself with great propriety . "
6046	6086	5994	5995	the widow	1592	" You know Mark was a schollard , sir , like my poor , poor sister ; and though I was a sad stupid girl afore I married , I tried to take after him when we came together . "
6313	6344	6310	6310	PARSON	445	" Come hither , Lenny . You know the benefit of school , I see : it can teach you nothing better than to be a support to your mother . "
6360	6373	6345	6345	LENNY	450	" Please , sir , that may come one of these days . "
6377	6402	6374	6374	PARSON	445	" That 's right , Lenny . Let me see ! why , you must be nearly a man . How old are you ? "
6414	6433	6411	6411	PARSON	445	" You ought to know , Lenny : speak for yourself . Hold your tongue , Mrs. Fairfield . "
6445	6467	6434	6434	LENNY	450	" Well , and there is Flop , neighbour Dutton 's old sheep - dog . He be very old now . "
6471	6484	6468	6468	PARSON	445	" I am not asking Flop 's age , but your own . "
6488	6514	6485	6485	LENNY	450	" ' Deed , sir , I have heard say as how Flop and I were pups together . That is , I - I - "
6570	6590	6561	6561	PARSON	445	" Never mind ; it is not so badly answered , after all . And how old is Flop ? "
6594	6605	6591	6591	LENNY	450	" Why , he must be fifteen year and more .. "
6609	6618	6606	6606	PARSON	445	" How old , then , are you ? "
6630	6636	6619	6619	LENNY	450	" Fifteen year and more . "
6644	6656	6658	6659	the parson	1499	" That 's what we call putting two and two together , "
6661	6668	6671	6671	he	1499	" Or , in other words , "
6680	6709	6671	6671	he	1499	" in other words , thanks to his love for his book , simple as he stands here , Lenny Fairfield has shown himself capable of INDUCTIVE RATIOCINATION . "
6756	6767	6749	6749	Lenny	450	" You are very fond of Flop , I suppose ? "
6768	6774	6776	6777	the widow	1592	" ' Deed he is , "
6779	6787	6776	6777	the widow	1592	" and of all poor dumb creatures . "
6788	6824	6749	6749	Lenny	450	" Very good . Suppose , my lad , that you had a fine apple , and that you met a friend who wanted it more than you , what would you do with it ? "
6825	6839	6776	6777	the widow	1592	" Please you , sir , I would give him half of it . "
6846	6853	6840	6841	The parson	1499	" Not the whole , Lenny ? "
6857	6876	6854	6854	Lenny	450	" If he was a friend , sir , he would not like me to give him all . "
6877	6956	6776	6777	the widow	1592	" Upon my word , Master Leonard , you speak so well that I must e'en tell the truth . I brought you an apple , as a prize for good conduct in school . But I met by the way a poor donkey , and some one beat him for eating a thistle , so I thought I would make it up by giving him the apple . Ought I only to have given him the half ? "
6970	6979	6965	6965	his	450	" And did the donkey like the apple ? "
6980	6984	6986	6987	the parson	1499	" Very much , "
7040	7061	7062	7063	The parson	1499	" There , my man , that will pay for the half apple which you would have kept for yourself . "
7085	7089	7091	7092	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Good - day "
7143	7162	7131	7131	LENNY	450	" Indeed , sir , I would rather not . I would have given all to the Neddy . "
7166	7184	7163	7163	PARSON	445	" Why , then , my man , you have a still greater right to the sixpence . "
7188	7250	7185	7185	LENNY	450	" No , sir ; 'cause you only gave it to make up for the half apple . And if I had given the whole , as I ought to have done , why , I should have had no right to the sixpence . Please , sir , do n't be offended ; do take it back , will you ? "
7280	7284	7286	7287	Parson Dale	445	" I see , "
7291	7315	7286	7287	Parson Dale	445	" that if one do n't give Justice the first place at the table , all the other Virtues eat up her share . "
7466	7476	7461	7461	Lenny	450	" Buon giorno , Good - day to you , "
7831	7839	7841	7842	Mr. Dale	446	" Upon my word , Dr. Riccabocca , "
7846	7861	7841	7842	Mr. Dale	446	" you come in good time to solve a very nice question in casuistry ; "
7875	7889	7864	7865	the parson	1499	" Ought Lenny Fairfield to have the sixpence , or ought he not ? "
7890	7893	7895	7896	the doctor	1651	" Cospetto ! "
7898	7918	7895	7896	the doctor	1651	" if the hen would but hold her tongue , nobody would know that she had laid an egg . "
7921	7924	7926	7927	the parson	1499	" Granted , "
7929	7947	7926	7927	the parson	1499	" but what follows ? The saying is good , but I do n't see the application . "
7948	7953	7955	7956	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" A thousand pardons ! "
7966	8014	7955	7956	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" but it seems to me that if you had given the sixpence to the fanciullo , that is , to this good little boy , without telling him the story about the donkey , you would never have put him and yourself into this awkward dilemma . "
8015	8022	8024	8025	the parson	1499	" But , my dear sir , "
8040	8057	8030	8030	he	1499	" I should then have lost the opportunity of inculcating a moral lesson - you understand ? "
8118	8128	8130	8131	the parson	1499	" Still you have not given us your decision , "
8143	8146	8148	8148	he	1651	" Cospetto ! "
8151	8164	8148	8148	he	1651	" he who scrubs the head of an ass wastes his soap . "
8165	8180	8182	8183	the parson	1499	" If you scrubbed mine fifty times over with those enigmatical proverbs of yours , "
8187	8197	8182	8183	the parson	1499	" you would not make it any the wiser . "
8198	8203	8205	8206	the doctor	1651	" My good sir , "
8217	8296	8205	8206	the doctor	1651	" I never presumed to say that there were more asses than one in the story ; but I thought that I could not better explain my meaning , which is simply this , - you scrubbed the ass 's head , and therefore you must lose the soap . Let the fanciullo have the sixpence ; and a great sum it is , too , for a little boy , who may spend it all as pocketmoney ! "
8297	8305	8307	8308	the parson	1499	" There , Lenny , you hear ? "
8332	8338	8340	8340	he	450	" Please , Master Dale , "
8344	8349	8340	8340	he	450	" I 'd rather not .
8350	8361	8363	8364	the parson	1499	" It is a matter of feeling , you see , "
8371	8380	8363	8364	the parson	1499	" and I believe the boy is right . "
8381	8390	8392	8393	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" If it be a matter of feeling , "
8395	8427	8392	8393	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" there is no more to be said on it . When Feeling comes in at the door , Reason has nothing to do but to jump out of the window . "
8428	8435	8437	8438	the parson	1499	" Go , my good boy , "
8444	8466	8437	8438	the parson	1499	" but , stop ! give me your hand first . There - I understand you ; - good - by ! "
8773	8776	8778	8779	Mr. Dale	446	" Verily , "
8783	8793	8778	8779	Mr. Dale	446	" my lot has fallen on a goodly heritage . "
8862	8866	8868	8868	he	463	" Per Bacco ! "
8870	8932	8868	8868	he	463	" in every country I observe that the rooks settle where the trees are the finest . I am sure that , when Noah first landed on Ararat , he must have found some gentleman in black already settled in the pleasantest part of the mountain , and waiting for his tenth of the cattle as they came out of the Ark. "
9109	9116	9065	9065	he	1701	" Yours is a droll country , "
9121	9141	9118	9119	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" in mine , it is not the ass that walks first in the procession that gets the blows . "
9162	9167	9169	9169	he	1499	" Gently , gently , "
9171	9198	9169	9169	he	1499	" the sound of the stick spoils the singing ! Oh , Mr. Sprott , Mr. Sprott ! a good man is merciful to his beast . "
9235	9263	9224	9225	The tinker	1701	" Lord bless your reverence ! he does not mind it , - he likes it . I vould not hurt thee ; would I , Neddy ? "
9289	9303	9305	9306	the parson	1499	" I am sure you did not mean to hurt him , Sprott , "
9365	9396	9423	9424	the tinker	1701	" I am sure you did not mean to hurt him ; but he has already got a sore on his shoulder as big as my hand , poor thing ! "
9397	9421	9423	9424	the tinker	1701	" Lord love ' un ! yes ; that was done a playing with the manger the day I gave ' un oats ! "
9504	9513	9515	9515	he	1499	" Say a good word for the donkey ! "
9517	9520	9522	9523	the doctor	1651	" Sir , "
9534	9558	9526	9527	Mr. Sprott	468	" there 's a great kettle at my house - the Casino - which wants soldering : can you recommend me a tinker ? "
9559	9569	9571	9571	Sprott	468	" Why , that 's all in my line , "
9573	9594	9571	9571	Sprott	468	" and there ben't a tinker in the county that I vould recommend like myself , tho'f I say it . "
9595	9602	9604	9605	the doctor	1651	" You jest , good sir , "
9610	9634	9604	9605	the doctor	1651	" A man who ca n't mend a hole in his own donkey can never demean himself by patching up my great kettle . "
9635	9640	9642	9643	the tinker	1701	" Lord , sir ! "
9647	9678	9642	9643	the tinker	1701	" if I had known that poor Neddy had had two sitch friends in court , I 'd have seen he vas a gintleman , and treated him as sitch . "
9679	9684	9686	9687	the doctor	1651	" Corpo di Bacco ! "
9689	9708	9686	9687	the doctor	1651	" though that jest 's not new , I think the tinker comes very well out of it . "
9709	9716	9718	9719	the parson	1499	" True ; but the donkey ! "
9721	9731	9718	9719	the parson	1499	" I 've a great mind to buy it . "
9732	9743	9745	9746	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" Permit me to tell you an anecdote in point , "
9748	9751	9753	9754	the parson	1499	" Well ? "
9758	9764	9766	9766	Riccabocca	463	" Once on a time , "
9768	9986	9766	9766	Riccabocca	463	" the Emperor Adrian , going to the public baths , saw an old soldier , who had served under him , rubbing his back against the marble wall . The emperor , who was a wise , and therefore a curious , inquisitive man , sent for the soldier , and asked him why he resorted to that sort of friction . ' Because , ' answered the veteran , ' I am too poor to have slaves to rub me down . ' The emperor was touched , and gave him slaves and money . The next day , when Adrian went to the baths , all the old men in the city were to be seen rubbing themselves against the marble as hard as they could . The emperor sent for them , and asked them the same question which he had put to the soldier ; the cunning old rogues , of course , made the same answer . ' Friends , ' said Adrian , ' since there are so many of you , you will just rub one another ! ' Mr. Dale , if you do n't want to have all the donkeys in the county with holes in their shoulders , you had better not buy the tinker 's ! "
9987	10004	10010	10010	he	1499	" It is the hardest thing in the world to do the least bit of good , "
10052	10058	10047	10047	he	1518	" Et tu , Brute ! "
10073	10077	10079	10080	the tinker	1701	" Gee hup , "
10111	10118	10120	10121	the tinker	1701	" Never fear , your reverence , "
10125	10133	10120	10121	the tinker	1701	" I 'll not spite ' un . "
10137	10142	10144	10145	the parson	1499	" Four , o'clock , "
10152	10198	10144	10145	the parson	1499	" half an hour after dinner - time , and Mrs. Dale particularly begged me to be punctual , because of the fine trout the squire sent us . Will you venture on what our homely language calls ' pot - luck , ' Doctor ? "
10252	10257	10241	10242	Mrs. Dale	470	" her little tempers . "
10267	10270	10261	10264	well - bred ladies	1739	" little tempers "
10483	10531	10477	10477	thou	1751	" A pretty way to conciliate ' little tempers ' indeed , to add to the offence of spoiling the fish the crime of bringing an unexpected friend to eat it . Pot - luck , quotha , when the pot 's boiled over this half hour ! "
10925	10934	10936	10937	the parson	1499	" Dr. Riccabocca consents to dine with us , "
10941	10946	10948	10949	the Italian	1688	" If Madame permit ? "
10977	10990	10992	10993	Mrs. Dale	470	" I am only sorry that the trout must be quite spoiled , "
10997	11013	11015	11017	the infamous dissimulator	1779	" It is not the trout one thinks of when one dines with Mrs. Dale , "
11019	11032	11034	11035	the parson	1499	" But I see James coming to say that dinner is ready , "
11037	11052	11054	11055	Mrs. Dale	470	" He said that three - quarters of an hour ago , Charles dear , "
11092	11096	11099	11100	Mrs. Dale	470	" Charles dear , "

11291	11309	11330	11330	Arch	476	" Nay , I am very glad you amused yourself so much without me , Charles dear . "
11310	11327	11330	11330	Arch	476	" Not quite so loud ! If you had but my poor head , Charles dear , "
11332	11349	11330	11330	Arch	476	" If you could spill the ink anywhere but on the best tablecloth , Charles dear ! "
11350	11372	11330	11330	Arch	476	" But though you must always have your own way , you are not quite faultless , own , Charles dear , "
11397	11415	11330	11330	Arch	476	" Really , I must say , Charles dear , that you are the most fidgety person , "
11418	11448	11330	11330	Arch	476	" And if the house bills were so high last week , Charles dear , I should just like to know whose fault it was - that 's all . "
11449	11469	11330	11330	Arch	476	" But you know , Charles dear , that you care no more for me and the children than - "

11666	11706	11568	11572	the head of the family	1791	" My dear Jane , I do n't know if it is your intention to ruin me ; but I only wish you would do as all other women do who care three straws for their husband 's property , "

12086	12089	12091	12092	the parson	1499	" Um , "
12094	12107	12091	12092	the parson	1499	" I doubt if he values the married state as he ought . "
12108	12129	12032	12033	Mrs. Dale	470	" What do you mean , Charles ? I never saw a man more polite to ladies in my life . "
12130	12135	12091	12092	the parson	1499	" Yes , but - "
12136	12149	12032	12033	Mrs. Dale	470	" But what ? You are always so mysterious , Charles dear . "
12150	12171	12091	12092	the parson	1499	" Mysterious ! No , Carry ; but if you could hear what the doctor says of the ladies sometimes . "
12172	12210	12032	12033	Mrs. Dale	470	" Ay , when you men get together , my dear . I know what that means - pretty things you say of us ! But you are all alike ; you know you are , love ! "

28554	28568	28521	28521	she	470	" do n't say he , - ' t is a lady dog ! "
28569	28572	28574	28575	Mrs. Dale	470	" Oh , "
28600	28627	28574	28575	Mrs. Dale	470	" oh , then , you carry your aversion to the gentlemen even to lap - dogs , - that is being consistent indeed , Jemima ! "
28632	28735	28628	28629	MISS JEMIMA	528	" I had a gentleman dog once , - a pug ! - pugs are getting very scarce now . I thought he was so fond of me - he snapped at every one else ; the battles I fought for him ! Well , will you believe - I had been staying with my friend Miss Smilecox at Cheltenham . Knowing that William is so hasty , and his boots are so thick , I trembled to think what a kick might do . So , on coming here I left Bluff - that was his name - with Miss Smilecox . "
28747	28753	28739	28741	MRS . DALE	470	" Well , my love ? "
28758	28844	28754	28755	MISS JEMIMA	528	" Will you believe it , I say , when I returned to Cheltenham , only three months afterwards , Miss Smilecox had seduced his affections from me , and the ungrateful creature did not even know me again ? A pug , too - yet people say pugs are faithful ! I am sure they ought to be , nasty things ! I have never had a gentleman dog since , - they are all alike , believe me , heartless , selfish creatures . "
28850	28859	28845	28847	MRS . DALE	470	" Pugs ? I dare say they are ! "
28864	28876	28860	28861	MISS JEMIMA	528	.-"MEN ! - I told you it was a gentleman dog ! "
28883	28898	28877	28879	MRS . DALE	470	" True , my love , but the whole thing was so mixed up ! "
28903	28957	28899	28900	MISS JEMIMA	528	" You saw that cold - blooded case of Breach of Promise of Marriage in the papers , - an old wretch , too , of sixty - four . No age makes them a bit better . And when one thinks that the end of all flesh is approaching , and that - "
28989	29025	29029	29030	Mrs. Dale	470	" Yes , my love , we 'll avoid that subject , if you please . Mr. Dale has his own opinions , and it becomes me , you know , as a parson 's wife "
29055	29068	29050	29051	Miss Jemima	528	" to agree with him , - that is , in theology . "
29074	29089	29069	29070	MISS JEMIMA	528	" But the thing is so clear , if you will but look into - "
29104	29136	29092	29092	DALE	470	" Not a word more . Pray , what do you think of the squire 's tenant at the Casino , Signor Riccabocca ? An interesting creature , is he not ? "
29141	29155	29137	29138	MISS JEMIMA	528	" Interesting ! not to me . Interesting ? Why is he interesting ? "
29189	29215	29180	29181	MISS JEMIMA	528	" Why is he interesting ? I scarcely ever looked at him ; they say he smokes , and never eats . Ugly , too ! "
29221	29242	29216	29218	MRS . DALE	470	" Ugly , - no . A fine bead , - very like Dante 's ; but what is beauty ? "
29247	29284	29243	29244	MISS JEMIMA	528	" Very true : what is it indeed ? Yes , as you say , I think there is something interesting about him ; he looks melancholy , but that may be because he is poor . "
29290	29316	29285	29287	MRS . DALE	470	" It is astonishing how little one feels poverty when one loves . Charles and I were very poor once , - before the squire - "
29341	29344	29345	29345	she	470	" Yes , "
29352	29374	29345	29345	she	470	" we were very poor , but we were happy even then , - more thanks to Charles than to me ; "
29416	29449	29412	29413	MISS JEMIMA	528	" It is only those horrid men who think of money as a source of happiness . I should be the last person to esteem a gentleman less because he was poor . "
29455	29476	29450	29452	MRS . DALE	470	" I wonder the squire does not ask Signor Riccabocca here more often . Such an acquisition we find him ! "
29488	29500	29477	29478	The squire	1498	" Whom ought I to ask more often , Mrs. Dale ? "
29508	29527	29501	29501	Parson	445	" Come , come , come , squire : play to my queen of diamonds , - do ! "

29748	29762	29717	29717	SQUIRE	447	" First time I ever heard the hospitality of Hazeldean called in question ! "
29768	29787	29763	29765	MRS . DALE	470	" My dear sir , I beg a thousand pardons , but listeners - you know the proverb . "
29795	29817	29788	29788	SQUIRE	447	" I hear nothing but proverbs ever since we had that Mounseer among us . Please to speak plainly , ma'am . "
29832	29850	29818	29819	Mrs. DALE	470	" It was of Mounseer , as you call him , that I spoke , Mr. Hazeldean . "
29854	29859	29851	29851	SQUIRE	447	" What ! Rickeybockey ? "

30095	30141	30081	30081	SQUIRE	447	" Mrs. Dale , it is not my fault . I have asked Rickeybockey , - time out of mind . But I suppose I am not fine enough for those foreign chaps . He 'll not come , - that 's all I know . "
30203	30232	30233	30233	SQUIRE	447	" Really , Squire , we had better give up playing if you put out my partner in this extraordinary way , - jabber , jabber , jabber ! "
30236	30259	30233	30233	SQUIRE	447	" Well , we must be good children , Harry . What ! - trumps , Barney ? Thank ye for that ! "
30386	30420	30363	30363	PARSON	445	" That , I suppose , is the new - fashioned London play ! In my time the rule was , ' First save the game , then try to win it . ' "
30424	30432	30421	30421	CAPTAIN	2659	" Could not save it , sir . "
30436	30465	30433	30433	PARSON	445	" Not save it ! - two ruffs in my own hand , - two tricks certain till you took them out ! Monstrous ! The rashest trump . "

30658	30691	30631	30632	The squire	1498	" Write to Rickeybockey to - morrow yourself , Harry , and ask him to come and spend two or three days here . There , Mrs. Dale , you hear me ? "
30692	30695	30697	30698	Mrs. Dale	470	" Yes , "

31006	31017	31003	31004	the squire	1498	" Mrs. H. , he has got my County History ! "
31018	31034	30986	30989	the vulgar , Higginbotham	529	" Well , Hazeldean , it is time he should know something about the county . "
31035	31042	31044	31045	Mrs. Dale	470	" Ay , and history too , "
31063	31086	31060	31060	FRANK	449	" I 'll not hurt it , I assure you , sir . But I 'm very much interested just at present . "
31097	31114	31087	31088	THE CAPTAIN	2114	" You 've got hold of that passage about Botham Hall , page 706 , eh ? "
31118	31146	31115	31115	FRANK	449	" No ; I was trying to make out how far it is to Mr. Leslie 's place , Rood Hall . Do you know , Mother ? "
31152	31179	31147	31149	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" I ca n't say I do . The Leslies do n't mix with the county ; and Rood lies very much out of the way . "
31183	31193	31180	31180	FRANK	449	" Why do n't they mix with the county ? "
31199	31220	31194	31196	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" I believe they are poor , and therefore I suppose they are proud ; they are an old family . "

31303	31315	31298	31298	FRANK	449	" Because Randal Leslie is there for the holidays , sir . "
31319	31365	31316	31316	PARSON	563	" Your wife has cut for you , Mr. Hazeldean . I do n't think it was quite fair ; and my partner has turned up a deuce , - deuce of hearts . Please to come and play , if you mean to play . "
31431	31462	31428	31428	SQUIRE	447	" There , Parson , I hope you 'll be in a better humour . You win enough out of us to set up a coach - and - four . "
31463	31466	31468	31469	the parson	1499	" Tut ! "
31471	31490	31468	31469	the parson	1499	" at the end of the year , I 'm not a penny the richer for it all . "
31693	31696	31698	31699	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" Frank , "
31701	31710	31698	31699	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" I never saw you so studious before . "
31740	31753	31730	31730	SQUIRE	447	" Pray , Frank , what do you know of Randal Leslie ? "
31754	31764	31698	31699	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" Why , sir , he is at Eton . "
31765	31774	31776	31777	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" What sort of a boy is he ? "
31790	31807	31779	31779	Frank	449	" They say he is the cleverest boy in the school . But then he saps . "
31808	31813	31815	31816	Mr. Dale	446	" In other words , "
31823	31872	31815	31816	Mr. Dale	446	" he understands that he was sent to school to learn his lessons , and he learns them . You call that sapping ? call it doing his duty . But pray , who and what is this Randal Leslie , that you look so discomposed , Squire ? "
31873	31880	31882	31883	the squire	1498	" Who and what is he ? "
31890	31919	31921	31922	the squire	1498	" Why , you know Mr. Audley Egerton married Miss Leslie , the great heiress ; and this boy is a relation of hers . I may say , "
31924	32012	31921	31922	the squire	1498	" that he is a near relation of mine , for his grandmother was a Hazeldean ; but all I know about the Leslies is , that Mr. Egerton , as I am told , having no children of his own , took up young Randal when his wife died , poor woman , pays for his schooling , and has , I suppose , adopted the boy as his heir . Quite welcome . Frank and I want nothing from Mr. Audley Egerton , thank Heaven ! "
32013	32029	32031	32032	the parson	1499	" I can well believe in your brother 's generosity to his wife 's kindred , "
32036	32050	32031	32032	the parson	1499	" for I am sure Mr. Egerton is a man of strong feeling . "
32051	32075	32194	32194	his	1499	" What the deuce do you know about Mr. Egerton ? I do n't suppose you could ever have even spoken to him . "
32076	32079	32081	32082	the parson	1499	" Yes , "
32091	32100	32108	32108	he	1499	" I had some conversation with him once ; "
32111	32134	32108	32108	he	1499	" when I was curate at Lansmere , and about a painful business connected with the family of one of my parishioners . "
32135	32182	32108	32108	he	1499	" Oh , one of your parishioners at Lansmere , - one of the constituents Mr. Audley Egerton threw over , after all the pains I had taken to get him his seat . Rather odd you should never have mentioned this before , Mr. Dale ! "
32183	32188	32190	32191	the parson	1499	" My dear sir , "
32206	32221	32190	32191	the parson	1499	" you are so irritable whenever Mr. Egerton 's name is mentioned at all . "
32222	32225	32108	32108	he	1499	" Irritable ! "
32244	32435	32439	32440	the squire	1498	" irritable , sir ! I should think so : a man for whom I stood godfather at the hustings , Mr. Dale ! a man for whose sake I was called a ' prize ox , ' Mr. Dale ! a man for whom I was hissed in a market - place , Mr. Dale ! a man for whom I was shot at , in cold blood , by an officer in His Majesty 's service , who lodged a ball in my right shoulder , Mr. Dale ! a man who had the ingratitude , after all this , to turn his back on the landed interest , - to deny that there was any agricultural distress in a year which broke three of the best farmers I ever had , Mr. Dale ! - a man , sir , who made a speech on the Currency which was complimented by Ricardo , a Jew ! Good heavens ! a pretty parson you are , to stand up for a fellow complimented by a Jew ! Nice ideas you must have of Christianity ! Irritable , sir ! "
32472	32521	32552	32552	he	1499	" Sir , if that man had not been my own half - brother , I 'd have called him out . I have stood my ground before now . I have had a ball in my right shoulder . Sir , I 'd have called him out . "
32522	32535	32537	32538	the parson	1499	" Mr. Hazeldean ! Mr. Hazeldean ! I 'm shocked at you , "
32559	32585	32552	32552	he	1499	" What an example to your son ! You 'll have him fighting duels one of these days , and nobody to blame but yourself . "
32595	32605	32606	32606	he	1499	" Why the deuce did you set me off ? "
32636	32709	32624	32625	The parson	1499	" And now that you may have it in your power to show civility and kindness to a boy whom Mr. Egerton has taken up , out of respect to his wife 's memory , - a kinsman , you say , of your own , and who has never offended you , - a boy whose diligence in his studies proves him to be an excellent companion to your son - Frank "
32717	32739	32714	32714	his	1499	" I suppose you would like to call on young Leslie , as you were studying the county map so attentively . "
32740	32745	32747	32747	Frank	449	" Yes , yes , "
32752	32788	32747	32747	Frank	449	" if my father does not object to it . Leslie has been very kind tome , though he is in the sixth form , and , indeed , almost the head of the school . "
32789	32792	32794	32795	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" Ah ! "
32797	32826	32794	32795	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" one studious boy has a fellow feeling for another ; and though you enjoy your holidays , Frank , I am sure you read hard at school . "
32850	32855	32857	32857	she	497	" Yes , Carry , "
32863	32906	32857	32857	she	497	" though you may not think Frank clever , his masters find him so . He got a prize last half . That beautiful book , Frank - hold up your head , my love - what did you get it for ? "
32911	32916	32907	32907	FRANK	449	" Verses , ma'am . "
32924	32934	32917	32919	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" Verses ! - there , Carry , verses ! "
32942	32952	32935	32935	FRANK	449	" Yes , but Leslie wrote them for me . "
32959	32976	32953	32955	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" O Frank ! a prize for what another did for you - that was mean . "
32981	33001	32977	32977	FRANK	449	" You ca n't be more ashamed , Mother , than I was when they gave me the prize . "
33024	33048	33002	33004	MRS . DALE	470	" I beg your pardon , Frank . Your mother must be as proud of that shame as she was of the prize . "
33088	33091	33078	33079	Miss Jemima	528	" aside , "
33092	33137	33078	33079	Miss Jemima	528	" But we are forgetting poor Mr. Riccabocca . Mrs. Hazeldean , though the dearest creature in the world , has such a blunt way of inviting people - do n't you think if you were to say a word to him , Carry ? "
33152	33169	33144	33144	she	470	" Suppose you write the note yourself ? Meanwhile I shall see him , no doubt . "
33181	33214	33170	33170	PARSON	563	" You forgive my impertinence , my kind friend . We parsons , you know , are apt to take strange liberties , when we honour and love folks as I do . "

33323	33331	33333	33333	he	446	" The cruellest trump , Captain Higginbotham ! "

33396	33411	33388	33388	PARSON	563	" Have you , Carry ? - it will be a very pretty handkerchief . "
33417	33448	33412	33414	MRS . DALE	470	" Handkerchief ? - nonsense , dear . Do n't you think it would be a very happy thing for both if Jemima and Signor Riccabocca could be brought together ? "
33452	33456	33449	33449	PARSON	563	" Brought together ! "
33462	33484	33457	33459	MRS . DALE	470	" You do snap up one so , my dear ; I mean if I could make a match of it . "
33488	33508	33485	33485	PARSON	563	" I think Riccabocca is a match already , not only for Jemima , but yourself into the bargain . "
33516	33531	33509	33511	MRS . DALE	470	" Well , we shall see . Was not Jemima 's fortune about L4000 ? "
33546	33555	33536	33536	he	2722	" Ay - ay - I dare say . "
33561	33596	33556	33558	MRS . DALE	470	" And she must have saved ! I dare say it is nearly L6000 by this time ; eh ! Charles dear , you really are so - good gracious , what 's that ! "
33619	33624	33616	33616	PARSON	563	" What 's what ? "
33636	33644	33625	33627	MRS . DALE	470	" That thing - there - there . "
33648	33681	33645	33645	PARSON	563	" Only the new stocks , Carry ; I do n't wonder they frighten you , for you are a very sensible woman . I only wish they would frighten the squire . "
33967	33972	33974	33975	Miss Jemima	528	" No , Frank , "
33977	34000	33974	33975	Miss Jemima	528	" you ca n't have George ; your father wants him to go on a message , - you can take Mat . "

34189	34210	34179	34180	The squire	1498	" And what do you want a groom at all for ? Are you afraid of tumbling off the pony ? "
34214	34237	34211	34211	FRANK	449	" No , Sir ; but I like to go as a gentleman , when I pay a visit to a gentleman ! "
34244	34319	34238	34238	SQUIRE	447	" You precious puppy ! I think I 'm as good a gentleman as you any day , and I should like to know when you ever saw me ride to call on a neighbour with a fellow jingling at my heels , like that upstart Ned Spankie , whose father kept a cotton mill . First time I ever heard of a Hazeldean thinking a livery coat was necessary to prove his gentility ! "
34333	34354	34320	34322	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" Hush , Frank , never answer your father , - and you are going to call on Mr. Leslie ? "
34355	34373	34375	34375	Frank	449	" Yes , ma'am , and I am very much obliged to my father for letting me , "
34383	34390	34392	34393	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" Well , but , Frank , "
34395	34407	34392	34393	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" I think you heard that the Leslies were very poor . "
34411	34416	34408	34408	FRANK	449	" Eh , Mother ? "
34422	34452	34417	34419	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" And would you run the chance of wounding the pride of a gentleman as well born as yourself by affecting any show of being richer than he is ? "
34459	34471	34453	34453	SQUIRE	447	" Harry , I 'd give L10 to have said that ! "
34485	34499	34472	34472	FRANK	449	" You 're quite right , Mother ; nothing could be more snobbish ! "
34502	34525	34500	34500	SQUIRE	447	" Give us your fist , too , sir ; you 'll be a chip of the old block , after all . "
34544	34556	34540	34541	Miss Jemima	528	" Is that the note you were to write for me ? "
34561	34586	34557	34558	MISS JEMIMA	528	" Yes ; I supposed you did not care about seeing it , so I have sealed it , and given it to George . "
34592	34621	34587	34589	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" But Frank will pass close by the Casino on his way to the Leslies ' . It may be more civil if he leaves the note himself . "
34627	34633	34622	34623	MISS JEMIMA	528	" Do you think so ? "
34639	34676	34634	34636	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" Yes , certainly . Frank , Frank , as you pass by the Casino , call on Mr. Riccabocca , give this note , and say we shall be heartily glad if he will come . "
34680	34685	34687	34688	the squire	1498	" Stop a bit , "
34690	34754	34687	34688	the squire	1498	" If Rickeybockey is at home , ' t is ten to one if he do n't ask you to take a glass of wine ! If he does , mind , ' t is worse than asking you to take a turn on the rack . Faugh ! you remember , Harry ? - I thought it was all up with me . "
34755	34758	34760	34761	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" Yes , "
34763	34776	34760	34761	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" for Heaven 's sake not a drop . Wine , indeed ! "
34777	34784	34786	34787	the squire	1498	" Do n't talk of it , "
34794	34802	34804	34804	Frank	449	" I 'll take care , Sir ! "
34900	34908	34910	34911	my father	1479	" There ca n't be a doubt , "
34913	34942	34910	34911	my father	1479	" that to each of the main divisions of your work - whether you call them Books or Parts - you should prefix an Initial or Introductory Chapter . "
34946	34958	34910	34911	my father	1479	" Ca n't be a doubt , sir ? Why so ? "
34964	34995	34959	34961	MR . CAXTON	409	" Fielding lays it down as an indispensable rule , which he supports by his example ; and Fielding was an artistical writer , and knew what he was about . "
34999	35010	34996	34996	PISISTRATUS	420	" Do you remember any of his reasons , sir ? "
35016	35185	35011	35013	MR . CAXTON	409	" Why , indeed , Fielding says , very justly , that he is not bound to assign any reason ; but he does assign a good many , here and there , - to find which I refer you to ' Tom Jones . ' I will only observe , that one of his reasons , which is unanswerable , runs to the effect that thus , in every Part or Book , the reader has the advantage of beginning at the fourth or fifth page instead of the first , - ' a matter by no means of trivial consequence , ' saith Fielding , ' to persons who read books with no other view than to say they have read them , - a more general motive to reading than is commonly imagined ; and from which not only law books and good books , but the pages of Homer and Virgil , Swift and Cervantes , have been often turned Over . ' There , "
35192	35208	35011	35013	MR . CAXTON	409	" I will lay a shilling to twopence that I have quoted the very words . "
35214	35242	35209	35211	MRS . CANTON	591	" Dear me , that only means skipping ; I do n't see any great advantage in writing a chapter , merely for people to skip it . "
35246	35251	35243	35243	PISISTRATUS	420	" Neither do I ! "
35258	35293	35295	35296	my father	1479	" It is the repose in the picture , - Fielding calls it ' contrast . ' - Still more dogmatically . - I say there ca n't be a doubt about it . Besides "
35302	35443	35295	35296	my father	1479	" besides , this usage gives you opportunities to explain what has gone before , or to prepare for what 's coming ; or , since Fielding contends , with great truth , that some learning is necessary for this kind of historical composition , it allows you , naturally and easily , the introduction of light and pleasant ornaments of that nature . At each flight in the terrace you may give the eye the relief of an urn or a statue . Moreover , when so inclined , you create proper pausing - places for reflection ; and complete by a separate , yet harmonious ethical department , the design of a work , which is but a mere Mother Goose 's tale if it does not embrace a general view of the thoughts and actions of mankind . "
35447	35486	35444	35444	PISISTRATUS	420	" But then , in these initial chapters , the author thrusts himself forward ; and just when you want to get on with the dramatis personae , you find yourself face to face with the poet himself . "
35492	35531	35487	35489	MR . CANTON	592	" Pooh ! you can contrive to prevent that ! Imitate the chorus of the Greek stage , who fill up the intervals between the action by saying what the author would otherwise say in his own person . "
35536	35562	35532	35532	PISISTRATUS	420	" That 's a good idea , sir , - and I have a chorus , and a choregus too , already in my eye . "
35569	35649	35563	35565	MR . CANTON	592	" Aha ! you are not so dull a fellow as you would make yourself out to be ; and , even if an author did thrust himself forward , what objection is there to that ? It is a mere affectation to suppose that a book can come into the world without an author . Every child has a father , - one father at least , - as the great Conde says very well in his poem . "
35653	35666	35650	35650	PISISTRATUS	420	" The great Conde a poet ! I never heard that before . "
35672	35762	35667	35669	MR . CANTON	592	" I do n't say he was a poet , but he sent a poem to Madame de Montansier . Envious critics think that he must have paid somebody else to write it ; but there is no reason why a great captain should not write a poem , - I do n't say a good poem , but a poem . I wonder , Roland , if the duke ever tried his hand at ' Stanzas to Mary , ' or ' Lines to a Sleeping Babe . ' "
35767	35819	35763	35764	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" Austin , I 'm ashamed of you . Of course the duke could write poetry if he pleased , - something , I dare say , in the way of the great Conde ; that is , something warlike and heroic , I 'll be bound . Let 's hear ! "
35826	35853	35763	35764	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" Telle est du Ciel la loi severe Qu'il faut qu'un enfant ait un pere ; On dit meme quelquefois Tel enfant en a jusqu'a trois . "
35854	35879	35763	35764	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" That each child has a father Is Nature 's decree ; But , to judge by a rumour , Some children have three . "
35886	35899	35880	35881	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" Conde write such stuff ! - I do n't believe it . "
35903	35926	35900	35900	PISISTRATUS	420	" I do , and accept the quotations ; you and Roland shall be joint fathers to my child as well as myself .
35927	35937	35763	35764	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" ' Tel enfant en a jusqu'a trois . ' "
35944	35979	35938	35940	MR . CAXTON	409	" I refuse the proffered paternity ; but so far as administering a little wholesome castigation now and then , I have no objection to join in the discharge of a father 's duty . "
35983	35996	35980	35980	PISISTRATUS	420	" Agreed . Have you anything to say against the infant hitherto ? "
36002	36019	35997	35999	MR . CAXTON	409	" He is in long clothes at present ; let us wait till he can walk . "
36023	36041	36020	36020	BLANCHE	411	" But pray whom do you mean for a hero ? And is Miss Jemima your heroine ? "
36046	36054	36042	36043	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" There is some mystery about the - "
36057	36088	36055	36055	PISISTRATUS	420	.-"Hush , Uncle : no letting the cat out of the bag yet . Listen , all of you ! I left Frank Hazeldean on his way to the Casino . "
36092	36100	36102	36102	Frank	449	" It is a sweet pretty place , "
36128	36170	36102	36102	Frank	449	" I wonder , though , that my father , who is so particular in general , suffers the carriage - road to be so full of holes and weeds . Mounseer does not receive many visits , I take it . "
36364	36367	36372	36372	himself	463	" Diavolo ! "

36514	36533	36502	36503	the Italian	1688	" pardon the negligence of my people ; I am too happy to receive your commands in person . "

36563	36598	36540	36540	Frank	449	" I - I have a note from the Hall . Mamma - that is , my mother - and aunt Jemima beg their best compliments , and hope you will come , sir . "

37348	37353	37355	37355	Frank	449	" Oh , yes , "
37395	37399	37401	37401	he	1688	" Mrs. Hazeldean , "
37406	37431	37401	37401	he	1688	" does me very great honour . I hardly recognize her handwriting , or I should have been more impatient to open the letter . "
37466	37472	37474	37474	Frank	449	" Cousin Jemima 's hand , "
37492	37501	37488	37489	The Italian	1688	" Mr. Hazeldean has company staying with him ? "
37502	37525	37527	37527	Frank	449	" No ; that is , only Barney , - the captain . There 's seldom much company before the shooting season , "
37534	37561	37527	37527	Frank	449	" and then , you know , the holidays are over . For my part , I think we ought to break up a month later . "
37687	37727	37684	37684	he	1651	" For your sake , young gentleman , I regret that your holidays are so early ; for mine , I must rejoice , since I accept the kind invitation you have rendered doubly gratifying by bringing it yourself . "
37728	37747	37749	37750	English Frank	449	" Deuce take the fellow and his fine speeches ! One do n't know which way to look , "
37785	37797	37761	37761	he	1688	" You do n't care much for compliments , young gentleman ? "
37798	37806	37808	37808	Frank	449	" No , I do n't indeed , "
37812	37843	37761	37761	he	1688	" So much the better for you , since your way in the world is made : it would be so much the worse if you had to make it ! "
37863	37869	37871	37871	he	449	" Those are very funny , "
37873	37883	37871	37871	he	449	" they seem capitally done . Who did 'em ? "
37884	37897	37844	37844	Frank	449	" Signoriuo Hazeldean , you are giving me what you refused yourself . "
37898	37901	37903	37903	Frank	449	" Eh ? "
37907	37910	37844	37844	Frank	449	" Compliments ! "
37911	37930	37844	37844	Frank	449	" Oh - I - no ; but they are well done : are n't they , sir ? "
37932	37942	37844	37844	Frank	449	" Not particularly : you speak to the artist . "
37943	37950	37844	37844	Frank	449	" What ! you painted them ? "
37951	37954	37844	37844	Frank	449	" Yes . "
37955	37963	37844	37844	Frank	449	" And the pictures in the hall ? "
37964	37968	37844	37844	Frank	449	" Those too . "
37969	37976	37844	37844	Frank	449	" Taken from nature , eh ? "
37977	37980	37982	37983	the Italian	1688	" Nature , "
37990	37998	37982	37983	the Italian	1688	" lets nothing be taken from her . "
37999	38002	38004	38004	Frank	449	" Oh ! "
38009	38029	38004	38004	Frank	449	" Well , I must wish you good morning , sir ; I am very glad you are coming . "
38030	38034	37844	37844	Frank	449	" Without compliment ? "
38035	38039	38004	38004	Frank	449	" Without compliment . "
38040	38058	38060	38060	Frank	449	" A rivedersi - good - by for the present , my young signorino . This way , "
38069	38089	38060	38060	Frank	449	" Can I offer you a glass of wine ? - it is pure , of our own making . "
38090	38100	38102	38102	Frank	449	" No , thank you , indeed , sir , "
38111	38129	38102	38102	Frank	449	" Good - by , do n't trouble yourself , sir ; I know any way now . "
38224	38230	38232	38232	he	1651	" The wiser we grow , "
38236	38281	38232	38232	he	1651	" the more we regret the age of our follies : it is better to gallop with a light heart up the stony hill than sit in the summer - house and cry ' How true ! ' to the stony truths of Machiavelli ! "
38587	38595	38597	38597	Frank	449	" Is this the village of Rood ? "
38631	38642	38628	38628	his	14948	" And where 's the Hall - Mr. Leslie 's ? "
38658	38664	38643	38644	The man	14948	" Be you going there ? "
38665	38677	38699	38700	the man	14948	" Yes , if I can find out where it is . "
38678	38685	38687	38688	the boor	2854	" I 'll show your honour , "
38766	38781	38783	38783	he	449	" You do n't seem very well off in this village , my man ? "
38787	38821	38745	38745	he	449	" Noa ; there be a deal of distress here in the winter time , and summer too , for that matter ; and the parish ben't much help to a single man . "
38822	38835	38745	38745	he	449	" But surely the farmers want work here as well as elsewhere ? "
38836	38860	38745	38745	he	449	" ' Deed , and there ben't much farming work here , - most o ' the parish be all wild ground loike . "
38861	38873	38875	38875	Frank	449	" The poor have a right of common , I suppose , "
38887	38954	38956	38957	the peasant	1571	" Yes ; neighbour Timmins keeps his geese on the common , and some has a cow , and them be neighbour Jowlas 's pigs . I do n't know if there 's a right , loike ; but the folks at the Hall does all they can to help us , and that ben't much : they ben't as rich as some folks ; but , "
38961	38973	38956	38957	the peasant	1571	" they be as good blood as any in the shire . "
38974	38989	38745	38745	he	449	" I ' m glad to see you like them , at all events . "
38990	39012	38956	38957	the peasant	1571	" Oh , yes , I likes them well eno ' ; mayhap you are at school with the young gentleman ? "
39013	39016	39018	39018	Frank	449	" Yes , "
39020	39070	38956	38957	the peasant	1571	" Ah , I heard the clergyman say as how Master Randal was a mighty clever lad , and would get rich some day . I ' se sure I wish he would , for a poor squire makes a poor parish . There 's the Hall , sir . "
39481	39643	39477	39477	his	570	" to which he regularly retires every morning after breakfast , rarely reappearing till one o'clock , which is his unfashionable hour for dinner . In what mysterious occupations Mr. Leslie passes those hours no one ever formed a conjecture . At the present moment he is seated before a little rickety bureau , one leg of which being shorter than the other is propped up by sundry old letters and scraps of newspapers ; and the bureau is open , and reveals a great number of pigeonholes and divisions , filled with various odds and ends , the collection of many years . In some of these compartments are bundles of letters , very yellow , and tied in packets with faded tape ; in another , all by itself , is a fragment of plum - pudding stone , which Mr. Leslie has picked up in his walks , and considered a rare mineral . It is neatly labelled , "
39661	39986	39655	39657	Maunder Slugge Leslie	609	" The next division holds several bits of iron in the shape of nails , fragments of horse - shoes , etc . , which Mr. Leslie has also met with in his rambles , and , according to a harmless popular superstition , deemed it highly unlucky not to pick up , and , once picked up , no less unlucky to throw away . Item , in the adjoining pigeon - hole , a goodly collection of pebbles with holes in them , preserved for the same reason , in company with a crooked sixpence ; item , neatly arranged in fanciful mosaics , several periwinkles , Blackamoor 's teeth I mean the shell so called , and other specimens of the conchiferous ingenuity of Nature , partly inherited from some ancestral spinster , partly amassed by Mr. Leslie himself in a youthful excursion to the seaside . There were the farm - bailiff 's accounts , several files of bills , an old stirrup , three sets of knee and shoe buckles which had belonged to Mr. Leslie 's father , a few seals tied together by a shoe - string , a shagreen toothpick case , a tortoise shell magnifying - glass to read with , his eldest son 's first copybooks , his second son 's ditto , his daughter 's ditto , and a lock of his wife 's hair arranged in a true lover 's knot , framed and glazed . There were also a small mousetrap ; a patent corkscrew too good to be used in common ; fragments of a silver teaspoon , that had , by natural decay , arrived at a dissolution of its parts ; a small brown holland bag , containing halfpence of various dates , as far back as Queen Anne , accompanied by two French sous and a German silber gros , - the which miscellany Mr. Leslie magniloquently called "
39990	40031	39655	39657	Maunder Slugge Leslie	609	" and had left in his will as a family heirloom . There were many other curiosities of congenial nature and equal value - quae nunc describere longum est . Mr. Leslie was engaged at this time in what is termed "
40037	40083	39655	39657	Maunder Slugge Leslie	609	" - an occupation he performed with exemplary care once a week . This was his day ; and he had just counted his coins , and was slowly tying them up again in the brown holland bag , when Frank 's knock reached his ears .

42001	42007	42094	42094	he	2949	" I am not sure . "
42008	42032	42034	42035	Mrs. Leslie	612	" Yes , you can go ; you have clothes like a gentleman ; you can go anywhere , not like those children ; "
42054	42083	42094	42094	he	2949	" What I have I owe at present to Mr. Egerton , and I should consult his wishes ; he is not on good terms with these Hazeldeans . "
42105	42132	42094	42094	he	2949	" What I may have hereafter , Oliver , I shall owe to myself ; and then if I rise , I will raise my family . "
42133	42137	42139	42140	Mrs. Leslie	612	" Dear Randal , "
42149	42157	42139	42140	Mrs. Leslie	612	" what a good heart you have ! "
42158	42188	42190	42190	Randal	628	" No , Mother ; my books do n't tell me that it is a good heart that gets on in the world : it is a hard head , "
42199	42214	42190	42190	Randal	628	" But I can read no more just now : come out , Oliver . "
42321	42324	42326	42326	Randal	628	" Oliver , "

42365	42373	42334	42334	his	628	" Read hard : knowledge is power ! "
42374	42383	42356	42356	He	628	" But you are so fond of reading . "
42384	42387	42389	42389	Randal	628	" I ! "
42391	42423	42389	42389	Randal	628	" Do you think , when Wolsey and Thomas - a - Becket became priests , they were fond of telling their beads and pattering Aves ? I fond of reading ! "
42435	42439	42441	42441	Randal	628	" You know , "
42443	42505	42441	42441	Randal	628	" that we Leslies were not always the beggarly poor gentlemen we are now . You know that there is a man who lives in Grosvenor Square , and is very rich , - very . His riches come to him from a Leslie ; that man is my patron , Oliver , and he - is very good to me . "
42515	42519	42520	42520	he	628	" Come on , "
42528	42532	42520	42520	he	628	" come on . "
42577	42587	42589	42589	Randal	628	" Will you pull down that bough , Oliver ? "
42632	42640	42642	42642	Oliver	612	" What are you about , Randal ? "
42646	42683	42623	42623	he	628	" We are on the other side of the brook now , and we shall not come back this way . We do n't want the stepping - stones any more ! - away with them ! "

46060	46089	46055	46056	this gentleman	3156	" By the way , can you dine with me next Saturday , to meet Lansmere ? He comes up to town to vote for us on Monday . "
46090	46101	46103	46103	Egerton	500	" I had asked some people to dine with me , "
46105	46133	46103	46103	Egerton	500	" but I will put them off . I see Lord Lansmere too seldom to miss any occasion to meet a man whom I respect so much . "
46134	46171	46055	46056	this gentleman	3156	" So seldom ! True , he is very little in town ; but why do n't you go and see him in the country ? Good shooting , - pleasant , old - fashioned house . "
46172	46199	46103	46103	Egerton	500	" My dear Westbourne , his house is ' nimium vicina Cremonae , ' close to a borough in which I have been burned in effigy . "
46200	46233	46055	46056	this gentleman	3156	" Ha ! ha ! yes , I remember you first came into parliament for that snug little place ; but Lansmere himself never found fault with your votes , did he ? "
46234	46264	46103	46103	Egerton	500	" He behaved very handsomely , and said he had not presumed to consider me his mouthpiece ; and then , too , I am so intimate with L'Estrange . "
46265	46276	46055	46056	this gentleman	3156	" Is that queer fellow ever coming back to England ? "
46277	46306	46103	46103	Egerton	500	" He comes , generally , every year , for a few days , just to see his father and mother , and then returns to the Continent . "
46307	46313	46055	46056	this gentleman	3156	" I never meet him . "
46314	46344	46103	46103	Egerton	500	" He comes in September or October , when you , of course , are not in town , and it is in town that the Lansmeres meet him . "
46345	46354	46055	46056	this gentleman	3156	" Why does he not go to them ? "
46355	46382	46103	46103	Egerton	500	" A man in England but once a year , and for a few days , has so much to do in London , I suppose . "
46383	46391	46392	46392	Egerton	500	" Is he as amusing as ever ? "
46395	46403	46405	46406	Lord Westbourne	639	" So distinguished as he might be ! "
46408	46415	46417	46417	Egerton	500	" So distinguished as he is ! "
46421	46455	46417	46417	Egerton	500	" an officer selected for praise , even in such fields as Quatre Bras and Waterloo ; a scholar , too , of the finest taste ; and as an accomplished gentleman matchless ! "
46456	46474	46476	46477	Lord Westbourne	639	" I like to hear one man praise another so warmly in these ill - natured days , "
46479	46503	46476	46477	Lord Westbourne	639	" But still , though L'Estrange is doubtless all you say , do n't you think he rather wastes his life living abroad ? "
46504	46545	46417	46417	Egerton	500	" And trying to be happy , Westbourne ? Are you sure it is not we who waste our lives ? But I ca n't stay to hear your answer . Here we are at the door of my prison . "
46546	46552	46476	46477	Lord Westbourne	639	" On Saturday , then ? "
46553	46560	46417	46417	Egerton	500	" On Saturday . Good day . "

47723	47740	47711	47711	himself	641	" I forgot something I had to say to Mr. Egerton ; wait below for me . "
47741	47747	47749	47749	Audley	500	" Well , Mr. Mayor , "
47756	47763	47749	47749	Audley	500	" what else would you suggest ? "
47800	47814	47789	47789	his	641	" I think I speak to a man of the world , sir ? "
47844	47886	47839	47841	MR . MAYOR	641	" You observe , sir , that I did not ask the members whom we return to parliament to accompany us . Do better without 'em . You know they are both in Opposition , - out - and - outers . "
47892	47921	47887	47889	MR . EGERTON	500	" It is a misfortune which the Government can not remember when the question is whether the trade of the town itself is to be served or injured . "
47927	47955	47922	47924	MR . MAYOR	641	" Well , I guess you speak handsome , sir . But you 'd be glad to have two members to support ministers after the next election . "
47962	47968	47956	47958	MR . EGERTON	500	" Unquestionably , Mr. Mayor . "
47974	48105	47969	47971	MR . MAYOR	3220	" And I can do it , Mr. Egerton . I may say I have the town in my pocket ; so I ought , - I spend a great deal of money in it . Now , you see , Mr. Egerton , I have passed a part of my life in a land of liberty - the United States - and I come to the point when I speak to a man of the world . I 'm a man of the world myself , sir . And so , if the Government will do something for me , why , I 'll do something for the Government . Two votes for a free and independent town like ours , - that 's something , is n't it ? "
48114	48119	48106	48108	MR . EGERTON	500	" Really , I - "
48135	48258	48120	48122	MR . MAYOR	641	" No nonsense , you see , on one side or the other . The fact is , that I 've taken it into my head that I should like to be knighted . You may well look surprised , Mr. Egerton , - trumpery thing enough , I dare say ; still , every man has his weakness , and I should like to be Sir Richard . Well , if you can get me made Sir Richard , you may just name your two members for the next election , - that is , if they belong to your own set , enlightened men , up to the times . That 's speaking fair and manful , is n't it ? "
48267	48289	48259	48261	MR . EGERTON	500	" I am at a loss to guess why you should select me , sir , for this very extraordinary proposition . "
48299	48350	48290	48292	MR . MAYOR	641	" Why , you see , I do n't go along with the Government ; you 're the best of the bunch . And may be you 'd like to strengthen your own party . This is quite between you and me , you understand ; honour 's a jewel ! "
48359	48391	48351	48353	MR . EGERTON	500	" Sir , I am obliged by your good opinion ; but I agree with my colleagues in all the great questions that affect the government of the country , and - "
48399	48465	48392	48394	MR . MAYOR	641	" Ah , of course , you must say so ; very right . But I guess things would go differently if you were Prime Minister . However , I have another reason for speaking to you about my little job . You see you were member for Lansmere once , and I think you only came in by a majority of two , eh ? "
48471	48487	48466	48468	MR . EGERTON	500	" I know nothing of the particulars of that election ; I was not present . "
48493	48545	48488	48490	MR . MAYOR	641	" No ; but luckily for you , two relations of mine were , and they voted for you . Two votes , and you came in by two . Since then , you have got into very snug quarters here , and I think we have a claim on you - "
48551	48590	48546	48548	MR . EGERTON	500	" Sir , I acknowledge no such claim ; I was and am a stranger to Lansmere ; and if the electors did me the honour to return me to parliament , it was in compliment rather to - "
48600	48671	48591	48593	MR . MAYOR	641	" Rather to Lord Lansmere , you were going to say ; unconstitutional doctrine that , I fancy . Peer of the realm . But never mind , I know the world ; and I 'd ask Lord Lansmere to do my affair for me , only he is a pompous sort of man ; might be qualmish : antiquated notions . Not up to snuff like you and me . "
48687	48724	48672	48674	MR . EGERTON	500	" Sir , it is not in my department to recommend to his Majesty candidates for the honour of knighthood , and it is still less in my department to make bargains for seats in parliament . "
48730	48891	48893	48894	the mayor	3218	" Oh , if that 's the case , you 'll excuse me ; I do n't know much of the etiquette in these matters . But I thought that if I put two seats in your hands for your own friends , you might contrive to take the affair into your department , whatever it was . But since you say you agree with your colleagues , perhaps it comes to the same thing . Now , you must not suppose I want to sell the town , and that I can change and chop my politics for my own purpose . No such thing ! I do n't like the sitting members ; I 'm all for progressing , but they go too much ahead for me ; and since the Government is disposed to move a little , why , I 'd as lief support them as not . But , in common gratitude , you see , "
48898	48919	48893	48894	the mayor	3218	" I ought to be knighted ! I can keep up the dignity , and do credit to his Majesty . "
48931	48945	48920	48922	MR . EGERTON	500	" I can only refer you , sir , to the proper quarter . "
48952	48996	48946	48948	MR . MAYOR	3220	" Proper quarter ! Well , since there is so much humbug in this old country of ours , that one must go through all the forms and get at the job regularly , just tell me whom I ought to go to . "
49010	49057	48997	48999	MR . EGERTON	500	" If you want a knighthood , Mr. Mayor , you must ask the Prime Minister ; if you want to give the Government information relative to seats in parliament , you must introduce yourself to Mr. - - - , the Secretary of the Treasury . "
49063	49081	49058	49060	MR . MAYOR	641	" And if I go to the last chap , what do you think he 'll say ? "
49093	49190	49082	49084	MR . EGERTON	500	" He will say , I suppose , that you must not put the thing in the light in which you have put it to me ; that the Government will be very proud to have the confidence of yourself and your brother electors ; and that a gentleman like you , in the proud position of mayor , may well hope to be knighted on some fitting occasion ; but that you must not talk about the knighthood just at present , and must confine yourself to converting the unfortunate political opinions of the town . "
49196	49242	49191	49193	MR . MAYOR	641	" Well , I guess that chap there would want to do me ! Not quite so green , Mr. Egerton . Perhaps I 'd better go at once to the fountain - head . How d ' ye think the Premier would take it ? "
49254	49264	49243	49245	MR . EGERTON	500	" Probably just as I am about to do . "
49275	49283	49285	49286	the minister	2115	" Show Mr. Mayor the way out , "
49341	49363	49318	49318	he	3218	" Some day or other I will make you smart for this , as sure as my name 's Dick Avenel ! "
49364	49367	49369	49369	Egerton	500	" Avenel ! "
49374	49377	49369	49369	Egerton	500	" Avenel ! "
49440	49453	49431	49431	He	500	" A man has just left me , who calls himself Aven - "

49474	49484	49486	49486	he	500	" what folly to reopen the old wounds there ! "

49713	49716	49718	49720	the wise man	3241	" Then , "
49722	49729	49718	49720	the wise man	3241	" everything shall go into it . "
49878	49896	49839	49839	he	1499	" Please , sir , I 'd rather not ; I 'd rather stay along with Mother , "
50057	50068	50070	50070	Riccabocca	463	" There will be no one there but the family , "
50072	50113	50070	50070	Riccabocca	463	" Poor Giacomo , a little chat in the servants ' hall will do you good ; and the squire 's beef is more nourishing , after all , than the sticklebacks and minnows . It will lengthen your life . "
50114	50119	50121	50121	Jackeymo	485	" The padrone jests , "
50125	50136	50121	50121	Jackeymo	485	" as if any one could starve in his service . "
50137	50140	50142	50142	Riccabocca	463	" Um , "
50144	50164	50166	50166	he	463	" At least , faithful friend , you have tried that experiment as far as human nature will permit ; "
50205	50208	50210	50211	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" Cospetto ! "
50213	50269	50210	50211	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" a thousand mock pearls do not make up the cost of a single true one ! The tears of women - we know their worth ; but the tears of an honest man - Fie , Giacomo ! - at least I can never repay you this ! Go and see to our wardrobe . "
50587	50600	50542	50543	The doctor	1651	" Giacomo , thou wantest clothes ; fit thyself out of mine ! "
50841	50865	50828	50828	Jackeymo	485	" This coat the padrone wore on such an occasion . I remember the very evening the padrone last put on those pantaloons ! "
50950	50954	50945	50945	his	463	" Patriae Exul . "
50955	50958	50960	50960	he	463	" Giacomo , "
50962	51026	50960	50960	he	463	" I have been thinking that thou hast never done what I told thee , and fitted thyself out from my superfluities . But we are going now into the great world : visiting once begun , Heaven knows where it may stop . Go to the nearest town and get thyself clothes . Things are dear in England . Will this suffice ? "
51078	51084	51085	51085	he	485	" The padrone is mad ! "
51088	51146	51085	51085	he	485	" he would fling away his whole fortune if I would let him . Five pounds English , or a hundred and twenty - six pounds Milanese ! Santa Maria ! unnatural father ! And what is to become of the poor signorina ? Is this the way you are to marry her in the foreign land ? "
51147	51150	51152	51152	Riccabocca	463	" Giacomo , "
51161	51193	51152	51152	Riccabocca	463	" the signorina to - morrow ; to - day the honour of the House . Thy small - clothes , Giacomo , - miserable man , thy small - clothes ! "

51210	51262	51201	51201	Jackeymo	485	" and the padrone does right to blame me , but not in so cruel a way . It is just , - the padrone lodges and boards me , and gives me handsome wages , and he has a right to expect that I should not go in this figure . "
51263	51273	51275	51275	Riccabocca	463	" For the board and the lodgment , good , "
51277	51291	51275	51275	Riccabocca	463	" For the handsome wages , they are the visions of thy fancy ! "
51292	51299	51301	51301	Jackeymo	485	" They are no such thing , "
51303	51394	51301	51301	Jackeymo	485	" they are only in arrear . As if the padrone could not pay them some day or other ; as if I was demeaning myself by serving a master who did not intend to pay his servants ! And ca n't I wait ? Have I not my savings too ? But be cheered , be cheered ; you shall be contented with me . I have two beautiful suits still . I was arranging them when you rang for me . You shall see , you shall see . "

53182	53189	53179	53180	Miss Jemima	528	" but too - too flattering . "

53201	53234	53196	53197	Mrs. Dale	470	" do you think , love , that you could put off the end of the world a little longer , or must we make haste in order to be in time ? "

53377	53401	53371	53371	RICCABOCCA	463	" So winning , that it is strange she is not won . That gray mare in the foreground stands out very boldly ! "

54666	54679	54681	54682	Mr. Stirn	542	" I never knowed such a thing in this here parish afore , "
54684	54703	54681	54682	Mr. Stirn	542	" and I can only ' count for it by s'posing that them foreign Papishers have been semminating - "
54704	54708	54653	54654	Mr. Stirn	542	" Been what ? "
54709	54712	54681	54682	Mr. Stirn	542	" Semminating - "
54713	54723	54653	54654	Mr. Stirn	542	" Disseminating , you blockhead , - disseminating what ? "
54724	54729	54731	54732	Mr. Stirn	542	" Damn the stocks , "
54754	54758	54760	54761	the squire	1498	" Mr. Stirn ! "
54765	54785	54760	54761	the squire	1498	" did you say , ' Damn the stocks ' ? - damn my new handsome pair of stocks ! "
54786	54829	54830	54831	The squire	1498	" Lord forbid , sir ; that 's what they say : that 's what they have digged on it with knives and daggers , and they have stuffed mud in its four holes , and broken the capital of the elewation . "
54869	54916	54845	54845	he	1498	" Compose yourself , Stirn ; you have a deposition to make , touching an assault upon - can I trust my senses ? - upon my new stocks . Compose yourself ; be calm . Now ! What the devil is come to the parish ? "
54917	54925	54927	54928	Mr. Stirn	542	" Ah , sir , what indeed ? "
54950	55005	55006	55006	Stirn	542	" And whom do you suspect ? Be calm now ; do n't speak in a passion . You are a witness , sir , - a dispassionate , unprejudiced witness . Zounds and fury ! this is the most insolent , unprovoked , diabolical - but whom do you suspect , I say ? "
55025	55041	55016	55016	his	542	" I hear as how the two Papishers slept at your honour 's last night . "
55042	55068	55006	55006	Stirn	542	" What , dolt ! do you suppose Dr. Rickeybockey got out of his warm bed to bung up the holes in my new stocks ? "
55069	55134	55016	55016	his	542	" Noa ; he 's too cunning to do it himself , but he may have been semminating . He 's mighty thick with Parson Dale , and your honour knows as how the parson set his face agin the stocks . Wait a bit , sir , - do n't fly at me yet . There be a boy in this here parish - "
55135	55167	55006	55006	Stirn	542	" A boy ! ah , fool , now you are nearer the mark . The parson write ' Damn the stocks , ' indeed ! What boy do you mean ? "
55168	55242	55016	55016	his	542	" And that boy be cockered up much by Mr. Dale ; and the Papisher went and sat with him and his mother a whole hour t ' other day ; and that boy is as deep as a well ; and I seed him lurking about the place , and hiding hisself under the tree the day the stocks was put up , - and that ' ere boy is Lenny Fairfield . "
55243	55246	55248	55249	the squire	1498	" Whew , "
55253	55464	55466	55467	the squire	1498	" you have not your usual senses about you to - day , man . Lenny Fairfield , - pattern boy of the village . Hold your tongue . I dare say it is not done by any one in the parish , after all : some good - for - nothing vagrant - that cursed tinker , who goes about with a very vicious donkey , - a donkey that I caught picking thistles out of the very eyes of the old stocks ! Shows how the tinker brings up his donkeys ! Well , keep a sharp look - out . To - day is Sunday ; worst day of the week , I 'm sorry and ashamed to say , for rows and depredations . Between the services , and after evening church , there are always idle fellows from all the neighbouring country about , as you know too well . Depend on it , the real culprits will be found gathering round the stocks , and will betray themselves ; have your eyes , ears , and wits about you , and I 've no doubt we shall come to the rights of the matter before the day 's out . And if we do , "
55469	55479	55466	55467	the squire	1498	" we 'll make an example of the ruffian ! "
55480	55484	55486	55486	Stirn	542	" In course , "
55488	55535	55486	55486	Stirn	542	" and if we do n't find him we must make an example all the same . That 's what it is , sir . That 's why the stocks ben't respected ; they has not had an example yet , - we wants an example . "
55536	55572	55466	55467	the squire	1498	" On my word I believe that 's very true ; and we 'll clap in the first idle fellow you catch in anything wrong , and keep him there for two hours at least . "
55573	55589	55486	55486	Stirn	542	" With the biggest pleasure , your honour , - that 's what it is . "
55624	55627	55629	55630	Mrs. Leslie	612	" Randal , "
55637	55650	55629	55630	Mrs. Leslie	612	" Randal , do you think of going to Mr. Hazeldean 's ? "
55651	55656	55658	55658	Randal	570	" Yes , ma'am , "
55660	55705	55658	55658	Randal	570	" Mr. Egerton does not object to it ; and as I do not return to Eton , I may have no other opportunity of seeing Frank for some time . I ought not to fail in respect to Mr. Egerton 's natural heir . "
55706	55710	55712	55713	Mrs. Leslie	612	" Gracious me ! "
55744	55756	55736	55736	she	612	" gracious me ! natural heir to the old Leslie property ! "
55757	55767	55769	55769	Randal	570	" He is Mr. Egerton 's nephew , and , "
55777	55788	55769	55769	Randal	570	" I am no relation to Mr. Egerton at all . "
55789	55792	55795	55796	Mrs. Leslie	612	" But , "
55804	55844	55795	55796	Mrs. Leslie	612	" it would be a shame in the man , after paying your schooling and sending you to Oxford , and having you to stay with him in the holidays , if he did not mean anything by it . "
55845	55886	55769	55769	Randal	570	" Anything , Mother , yes , - but not the thing you suppose . No matter . It is enough that he has armed me for life , and I shall use the weapons as seems to me best . "
55907	55922	55924	55925	Mrs. Leslie	612	" It ca n't be time for church ! No , it ca n't , "
55935	55940	55942	55943	Mr. Leslie	570	" Last bell ringing , "
56720	56758	56706	56706	his	570	" But I shall live to see you on a handsomer beastis than that little pony , Master Randal ; and sure I ought , for you be as good a gentleman as any in the land . "
56759	56763	56765	56765	Randal	570	" Thank you , "
56767	56784	56765	56765	Randal	570	" But I like walking better than riding , - I am more used to it . "
56785	56827	56706	56706	his	570	" Well , and you walk bra'ly , - there ben't a better walker in the county . And very pleasant it is walking ; and ' t is a pretty country afore you , all the way to the Hall . "
56855	56872	56874	56874	he	570	" I think I can find my way now . Many thanks to you , Tom ; "
57082	57089	57091	57092	the driver	3441	" You seem tired , sir , "
57120	57137	57106	57106	he	3441	" Perhaps we are going the same way , and I can give you a lift ? "
57167	57174	57176	57177	the latter	1552	" A nice day , sir , "
57186	57192	57176	57177	the latter	1552	" Have you come far ? "
57193	57198	57210	57211	the farmer	2192	" From Rood Hall . "
57199	57208	57210	57211	the farmer	2192	" Oh , you be young Squire Leslie , "
57221	57235	57210	57211	the farmer	2192	" Yes , my name is Leslie . You know Rood , then ? "
57236	57257	57210	57211	the farmer	2192	" I was brought up on your father 's land , sir . You may have heard of Farmer Bruce ? "
57261	57310	57258	57258	RANDAL	570	" I remember , when I was a little boy , a Mr. Bruce who rented , I believe , the best part of our land , and who used to bring us cakes when he called to see my father . He is a relation of yours ? "
57315	57329	57311	57312	FARMER BRUCE	660	" He was my uncle . He is dead now , poor man . "
57330	57359	57210	57211	the farmer	2192	RANDAL.-"Dead ! I am grieved to hear it . He was very kind to us children . But it is long since he left my father 's farm . "
57365	57387	57360	57361	FARMER BRUCE	660	" I am sure he was very sorry to go . But , you see , he had an unexpected legacy - "
57391	57397	57388	57388	RANDAL	570	" And retired from business ? "
57402	57424	57398	57399	FARMER BRUCE	660	" No . But , having capital , he could afford to pay a good rent for a real good farm . "
57429	57448	57425	57425	RANDAL	570	" All capital seems to fly from the lands of Rood . And whose farm did he take ? "
57453	57489	57449	57450	FARMER BRUCE	660	" He took Hawleigh , under Squire Hazeldean . I rent it now . We 've laid out a power o ' money on it . But I do n't complain . It pays well . "
57493	57508	57490	57490	RANDAL	570	" Would the money have paid as well sunk on my father 's land ? "
57513	57568	57509	57510	FARMER BRUCE	660	" Perhaps it might , in the long run . But then , sir , we wanted new premises , - barns and cattlesheds , and a deal more , - which the landlord should do ; but it is not every landlord as can afford that . Squire Hazeldean 's a rich man . "
57572	57575	57569	57569	RANDAL	570	" Ay ! "
57594	57623	57584	57585	the farmer	2192	" But which way be you going , sir ? I do n't care for a few miles more or less , if I can be of service . "
57624	57631	57633	57633	Randal	570	" I am going to Hazeldean , "
57641	57653	57636	57636	himself	570	" Do n't let me take you out of your way . "
57654	57677	57678	57679	The farmer	2192	" O , Hawleigh Farm is on the other side of the village , so it be quite my way , sir . "
57809	57815	57804	57805	the boy	14972	" Whose house is that ? "
57816	57848	57910	57911	The farmer	2192	" Oh , it belongs to Squire Hazeldean , but it is let or lent to a foreign mounseer . They say he is quite the gentleman , but uncommonly poor . "
57849	57852	57854	57854	Randal	570	" Poor , "
57891	57909	57910	57911	The farmer	2192	" poor ? The place seems well kept . What do you call poor , Mr. Bruce ? "
57914	57948	57910	57911	The farmer	2192	" Well , that 's a home question , sir . But I believe the mounseer is as poor as a man can be who makes no debts and does not actually starve . "
57949	57956	57958	57958	Randal	570	" As poor as my father ? "
57964	57980	57981	57981	Randal	570	" Lord , sir ! your father be a very rich man compared to him . "
58382	58550	58369	58369	his	3490	" The heir to this property is little better than a dunce ; and they tell me I have talents and learning , and I have taken to my heart the maxim , ' Knowledge is power . ' And yet , with all my struggles , will knowledge ever place me on the same level as that on which this dunce is born ? I do n't wonder that the poor should hate the rich . But of all the poor , who should hate the rich like the pauper gentleman ? I suppose Audley Egerton means me to come into parliament , and be a Tory like himself ? What ! keep things as they are ! No ; for me not even Democracy , unless there first come Revolution . I understand the cry of a Marat , - ' More blood ! ' Marat had lived as a poor man , and cultivated science - in the sight of a prince 's palace . "
58610	58613	58614	58614	he	3491	" But , "
58620	58810	58614	58614	he	3491	" but of revolution there is no chance . Yet the same wit and will that would thrive in revolutions should thrive in this commonplace life . Knowledge is power . Well , then , shall I have no power to oust this blockhead ? Oust him - what from ? His father 's halls ? Well , but if he were dead , who would be the heir of Hazeldean ? Have I not heard my mother say that I am as near in blood to this squire as any one , if he had no children ? Oh , but the boy 's life is worth ten of mine ! Oust him from what ? At least from the thoughts of his Uncle Egerton , - an uncle who has never even seen him ! That , at least , is more feasible . ' Make my way in life , ' sayest thou , Audley Egerton ? Ay , - and to the fortune thou hast robbed from my ancestors . Simulation ! simulation ! Lord Bacon allows simulation . Lord Bacon practised it , and - "

59617	59622	59624	59625	the squire	1498	" days in which , "
59632	59677	59627	59627	his	1498	" as I have never in my life met a worse devil than a devil of a temper , I 'll not carry mine into the family pew . He sha'n't be growling out hypocritical responses from my poor grandmother 's prayer - book . "

60181	60566	60166	60166	he	445	" He preferred the evening for that salutary discipline , not only because the congregation was more numerous , but also because , being a shrewd man in his own innocent way , he knew that people bear better to be preached at after dinner than before ; that you arrive more insinuatingly at the heart when the stomach is at peace . There was a genial kindness in Parson Dale 's way of preaching at you . It was done in so imperceptible , fatherly , a manner that you never felt offended . He did it , too , with so much art that nobody but your own guilty self knew that you were the sinner he was exhorting . Yet he did not spare rich nor poor : he preached at the squire , and that great fat farmer , Mr. Bullock , the churchwarden , as boldly as at Hodge the ploughman and Scrub the hedger . As for Mr. Stirn , he had preached at him more often than at any one in the parish ; but Stirn , though he had the sense to know it , never had the grace to reform . There was , too , in Parson Dale 's sermons something of that boldness of illustration which would have been scholarly if he had not made it familiar , and which is found in the discourses of our elder divines . Like them , he did not scruple now and then to introduce an anecdote from history , or borrow an allusion from some non - scriptural author , in order to enliven the attention of his audience , or render an argument more plain . And the good man had an object in this , a little distinct from , though wholly subordinate to , the main purpose of his discourse . He was a friend to knowledge , - but to knowledge accompanied by religion ; and sometimes his references to sources not within the ordinary reading of his congregation would spirit up some farmer 's son , with an evening 's leisure on his hands , to ask the parson for further explanation , and so to be lured on to a little solid or graceful instruction , under a safe guide .
60738	61526	64275	64276	The parson	1499	" BRETHREN ! every man has his burden . If God designed our lives to end at the grave , may we not believe that He would have freed an existence so brief from the cares and sorrows to which , since the beginning of the world , mankind has been subjected ? Suppose that I am a kind father , and have a child whom I dearly love , but I know by a divine revelation that he will die at the age of eight years , surely I should not vex his infancy by needless preparations for the duties of life ? If I am a rich man , I should not send him from the caresses of his mother to the stern discipline of school . If I am a poor man , I should not take him with me to hedge and dig , to scorch in the sun , to freeze in the winter 's cold : why inflict hardships on his childhood for the purpose of fitting him for manhood , when I know that he is doomed not to grow into man ? But if , on the other hand , I believe my child is reserved for a more durable existence , then should I not , out of the very love I bear to him , prepare his childhood for the struggle of life , according to that station in which he is born , giving many a toil , many a pain , to the infant , in order to rear and strengthen him for his duties as man ? So it is with our Father that is in heaven . Viewing this life as our infancy and the next as our spiritual maturity , where ' in the ages to come He may show the exceeding riches of His grace , ' it is in His tenderness , as in His wisdom ; to permit the toil and the pain which , in tasking the powers and developing the virtue of the soul , prepare it for ' the earnest of our inheritance . ' Hence it is that every man has his burden . Brethren , if you believe that God is good , yea , but as tender as a human father , you will know that your troubles in life are a proof that you are reared for an eternity . But each man thinks his own burden the hardest to bear : the poor - man groans under his poverty , the rich man under the cares that multiply with wealth . For so far from wealth freeing us from trouble , all the wise men who have written in all ages have repeated , with one voice , the words of the wisest , ' When goods increase , they are increased that eat them : and what good is there to the owners thereof , saving the beholding of them with their eyes ? ' And this is literally true , my brethren : for , let a man be as rich as was the great King Solomon himself , unless he lock up all his gold in a chest , it must go abroad to be divided amongst others ; yea , though , like Solomon , he make him great works , - though he build houses and plant vineyards , and make him gardens and orchards , - still the gold that he spends feeds but the mouths he employs ; and Solomon himself could not eat with a better relish than the poorest mason who builded the house , or the humblest labourer who planted the vineyard . Therefore ' when goods increase , they are increased that eat them . ' And this , my brethren , may teach us toleration and compassion for the rich . We share their riches , whether they will or not ; we do not share their cares . The profane history of our own country tells us that a princess , destined to be the greatest queen that ever sat on this throne , envied the milk - maid singing ; and a profane poet , whose wisdom was only less than that of the inspired writers , represents the man who , by force - and wit , had risen to be a king sighing for the sleep vouchsafed to the meanest of his subjects , - all bearing out the words of the son of David , ' The sleep of the labouring man is sweet , whether he eat little or much ; but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep . '
61527	62138	64275	64276	The parson	1499	" Amongst my brethren now present there is , doubtless , some one who has been poor , and by honest industry has made himself comparatively rich . Let his heart answer me while I speak : are not the chief cares that now disturb him to be found in the goods he hath acquired ? Has he not both vexations to his spirit and trials to his virtue , which he knew not when he went forth to his labour , and took no heed of the morrow ? But it is right , my brethren , that to every station there should be its care , to every man his burden ; for if the poor did not sometimes so far feel poverty to be a burden as to desire to better their condition , and to use the language of the world ' seek to rise in life , ' their most valuable energies would never be aroused ; and we should not witness that spectacle , which is so common in the land we live in , - namely , the successful struggle of manly labour against adverse fortune , - a struggle in which the triumph of one gives hope to thousands . It is said that necessity is the mother of invention ; and the social blessings which are now as common to us as air and sunshine have come from that law of our nature which makes us aspire towards indefinite improvement , enriches each successive generation by the labours of the last , and in free countries often lifts the child of the labourer to a place amongst the rulers of the land . Nay , if necessity is the mother of invention , poverty is the creator of the arts . If there had been no poverty , and no sense of poverty , where would have been that which we call the wealth of a country ? Subtract from civilization all that has been produced by the poor , and what remains ? - the state of the savage . Where you now see labourer and prince , you would see equality indeed , - the equality of wild men . No ; not even equality there ! for there brute force becomes lordship , and woe to the weak ! Where you now see some in frieze , some in purple , you would see nakedness in all . Where stands the palace and the cot , you would behold but mud huts and caves . As far as the peasant excels the king among savages , so far does the society exalted and enriched by the struggles of labour excel the state in which Poverty feels no disparity , and Toil sighs for no ease . On the other hand , if the rich were perfectly contented with their wealth , their hearts would become hardened in the sensual enjoyments it procures . It is that feeling , by Divine Wisdom implanted in the soul , that there is vanity and vexation of spirit in the things of Mammon , which still leaves the rich man sensitive to the instincts of Heaven , and teaches him to seek for happiness in those beneficent virtues which distribute his wealth to the profit of others . If you could exclude the air from the rays of the fire , the fire itself would soon languish and die in the midst of its fuel ; and so a man 's joy in his wealth is kept alive by the air which it warms ; and if pent within itself , is extinguished .
62139	62633	64275	64276	The parson	1499	" And this , my brethren , leads me to another view of the vast subject opened to us by the words of the apostle , ' Every man shall bear his own burden . ' The worldly conditions of life are unequal . Why are they unequal ? O my brethren , do you not perceive ? Think you that , if it had been better for our spiritual probation that there should be neither great nor lowly , rich nor poor , Providence would not so have ordered the dispensations of the world , and so , by its mysterious but merciful agencies , have influenced the framework and foundations of society ? But if from the remotest period of human annals , and in all the numberless experiments of government which the wit of man has devised , still this inequality is ever found to exist , may we not suspect that there is something in the very principles of our nature to which that inequality is necessary and essential ? Ask why this inequality ? Why ? - as well ask why life is the sphere of duty and the nursery of virtues ! For if all men were equal , if there were no suffering and no ease , no poverty and no wealth , would you not sweep with one blow the half , at least , of human virtues from the world ? If there were no penury and no pain , what would become of fortitude ; what of patience ; what of resignation ? If there were no greatness and no wealth , what would become of benevolence , of charity , of the blessed human pity , of temperance in the midst of luxury , of justice in the exercise of power ? Carry the question further ; grant all conditions the same , - no reverse , no rise , and no fall , nothing to hope for , nothing to fear , - what a moral death you would at once inflict upon all the energies of the soul , and what a link between the Heart of Man and the Providence of God would be snapped asunder ! If we could annihilate evil , we should annihilate hope ; and hope , my brethren , is the avenue to faith . If there be ' a time to weep and a time to laugh , ' it is that he who mourns may turn to eternity for comfort , and he who rejoices may bless God for the happy hour . Ah , my brethren , were it possible to annihilate the inequalities of human life , it would be the banishment of our worthiest virtues , the torpor of our spiritual nature , the palsy of our mental faculties . The moral world , like the world without us , derives its health and its beauty from diversity and contrast .
62634	62830	64275	64276	The parson	1499	" ' Every man shall bear his own burden . ' True ; but now turn to an earlier verse in the same chapter , - ' Bear ye one another 's burdens , and so fulfil the law of Christ . ' Yes , while Heaven ordains to each his peculiar suffering , it connects the family of man into one household , by that feeling which , more perhaps than any other , distinguishes us from the brute creation , - I mean the feeling to which we give the name of sympathy , - the feeling for each other ! The herd of deer shun the stag that is marked by the gunner ; the flock heedeth not the sheep that creeps into the shade to die ; but man has sorrow and joy not in himself alone , but in the joy and sorrow of those around him . He who feels only for himself abjures his very nature as man ; for do we not say of one who has no tenderness for mankind that he is inhuman ; and do we not call him who sorrows with the sorrowful humane ?
62831	63071	64275	64276	The parson	1499	" Now , brethren , that which especially marked the divine mission of our Lord is the direct appeal to this sympathy which distinguishes us from the brute . He seizes , not upon some faculty of genii given but to few , but upon that ready impulse of heart which is given to us all ; and in saying , ' Love one another , ' ' Bear ye one another 's burdens , ' he elevates the most delightful of our emotions into the most sacred of His laws . The lawyer asks our Lord , ' Who is my neighbour ? ' Our Lord replies by the parable of the good Samaritan . The priest and the Levite saw the wounded man that fell among the thieves and passed by on the other side . That priest might have been austere in his doctrine , that Levite might have been learned in the law ; but neither to the learning of the Levite nor to the doctrine of the priest does our Saviour even deign to allude . He cites but the action of the Samaritan , and saith to the lawyer , ' Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ? And he said , He that showed mercy unto him . Then said Jesus unto him , Go , and do thou likewise . '
63072	63184	64275	64276	The parson	1499	" O shallowness of human judgments ! It was enough to be born a Samaritan in order to be rejected by the priest , and despised by the Levite . Yet now , what to us the priest and the Levite , of God 's chosen race though they were ? They passed from the hearts of men when they passed the sufferer by the wayside ; while this loathed Samaritan , half thrust from the pale of the Hebrew , becomes of our family , of our kindred ; a brother amongst the brotherhood of Love , so long as Mercy and Affliction shall meet in the common thoroughfare of Life !
63185	63398	64275	64276	The parson	1499	" ' Bear ye one another 's burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ . ' Think not , O my brethren , that this applies only to almsgiving , to that relief of distress which is commonly called charity , to the obvious duty of devoting from our superfluities something that we scarcely miss to the wants of a starving brother . No . I appeal to the poorest amongst ye , if the worst burdens are those of the body , - if the kind word and the tender thought have not often lightened your hearts more than bread bestowed with a grudge , and charity that humbles you by a frown . Sympathy is a beneficence at the command of us all , - yea , of the pauper as of the king ; and sympathy is Christ 's wealth . Sympathy is brotherhood . The rich are told to have charity for the poor , and the poor are enjoined to respect their superiors . Good : I say not to the contrary . But I say also to the poor , ' In your turn have charity for the rich ; ' and I say to the rich , ' In your turn respect the poor . '
63399	63561	64275	64276	The parson	1499	" ' Bear ye one another 's burdens , and so fulfil the law of Christ . ' Thou , O poor man , envy not nor grudge thy brother his larger portion of worldly goods . Believe that he hath his sorrows and crosses like thyself , and perhaps , as more delicately nurtured , he feels them more ; nay , hath he not temptations so great that our Lord hath exclaimed , ' How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of heaven ' ? And what are temptations but trials ; what are trials but perils and sorrows ? Think not that you can bestow no charity on the rich man , even while you take your sustenance from his hands . A heathen writer , often cited by the earliest preachers of the gospel , hath truly said , ' Wherever there is room for a man there is place for a benefit . '
63562	63959	64275	64276	The parson	1499	" And I ask any rich brother amongst you , when he hath gone forth to survey his barns and his granaries , his gardens and orchards , if suddenly in the vain pride of his heart , he sees the scowl on the brow of the labourer , - if he deems himself hated in the midst of his wealth , if he feels that his least faults are treasured up against him with the hardness of malice , and his plainest benefits received with the ingratitude of envy , - I ask , I say , any rich man , whether straightway all pleasure in his worldly possessions does not fade from his heart , and whether he does not feel what a wealth of gladness it is in the power of the poor man to bestow ! For all these things of Mammon pass away ; but there is in the smile of him whom we have served a something that we may take with us into heaven . If , then , ye bear one another 's burdens , they who are poor will have mercy on the errors and compassion for the griefs of the rich . To all men it was said - yes , to Lazarus as to Dives - ' Judge not , that ye be not judged . ' But think not , O rich man , that we preach only to the poor . If it be their duty not to grudge thee thy substance , it is thine to do all that may sweeten their labour . Remember that when our Lord said , ' How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of heaven , ' He replied also to them who asked , ' Who then can be saved ? ' ' The things which are impossible with men are possible with God , ' that is , man left to his own temptations would fail ; but , strengthened by God , he shall be saved . If thy riches are the tests of thy trial , so may they also be the instruments of thy virtues . Prove by thy riches that thou art compassionate and tender , temperate and benign , and thy riches themselves may become the evidence at once of thy faith and of thy works .
63960	64274	64275	64276	The parson	1499	" We have constantly on our lips the simple precept , ' Do unto others as you would be done by . ' Why do we fail so often in the practice ? Because we neglect to cultivate that SYMPATHY which nature implants as an instinct , and the Saviour exalts as a command . If thou wouldst do unto thy neighbour as thou wouldst be done by , ponder well how thy neighbour will regard the action thou art about to do to him . Put thyself into his place . If thou art strong and he is weak , descend from thy strength and enter into his weakness ; lay aside thy burden for the while , and buckle on his own ; let thy sight see as through his eyes , thy heart beat as in his bosom . Do this , and thou wilt often confess that what had seemed just to thy power will seem harsh to his weakness . For ' as a zealous man hath not done his duty when he calls his brother drunkard and beast , ' even so an administrator of the law mistakes his object if he writes on the grand column of society only warnings that irritate the bold and terrify the timid ; and a man will be no more in love with law than with virtue , ' if he be forced to it with rudeness and incivilities . ' If , then , ye would bear the burden of the lowly , O ye great , feel not only for them , but with ! Watch that your pride does not chafe them , your power does not wantonly gall . Your worldly inferior is of the class from which the Apostles were chosen , amidst which the Lord of Creation descended from a throne above the seraphs . "
64326	64329	64331	64332	the parson	1499	" But , "
64354	64491	64331	64332	the parson	1499	" but he who has cultivated sympathy commits not these errors , or , if committing them , hastens to retract . So natural is sympathy to the good man that he obeys it mechanically when he suffers his heart to be the monitor of his conscience . In this sympathy , behold the bond between rich and poor ! By this sympathy , whatever our varying worldly lots , they become what they were meant to be , - exercises for the virtues more peculiar to each ; and thus , if in the body each man bear his own burden , yet in the fellowship of the soul all have common relief in bearing the burdens of each other . This is the law of Christ , - fulfil it , O my flock ! "

64919	64984	64914	64916	MR . SQUILLS	412	" Certainly ; there is not a catchpenny in the world but what goes down , if the title be apt and seductive . Witness ' Old Parr 's Life Pills . ' Sell by the thousand , Sir , when my ' Pills for Weak Stomachs , ' which I believe to be just the same compound , never paid for the advertising . "
64990	65040	64985	64987	MR . CAXTON	409	" Parr 's Life Pills ! a fine stroke of genius . It is not every one who has a weak stomach , or time to attend to it if he have . But who would not swallow a pill to live to a hundred and fifty - two ? "

65084	65281	65065	65067	MR . CAXTON	409	" From a remote period , the choice of a title has perplexed the scribbling portion of mankind . We may guess how their invention has been racked by the strange contortions it has produced . To begin with the Hebrews . ' The Lips of the Sleeping ' Labia Dormientium - what book did you suppose that title to designate ? - A Catalogue of Rabbinical Writers ! Again , imagine some young lady of old captivated by the sentimental title of ' The Pomegranate with its Flower , ' and opening on a Treatise on the Jewish Ceremonials ! Let us turn to the Romans . Aulus Gellius commences his pleasant gossipping ' Noctes ' with a list of the titles in fashion in his day . For instance , ' The Muses ' and ' The Veil , ' ' The Cornucopia , ' ' The Beehive , ' and ' The Meadow . ' Some titles , indeed , were more truculent , and promised food to those who love to sup upon horrors , - such as ' The Torch , ' ' The Poniard , ' ' The Stiletto ' - "
65286	65298	65282	65282	PISISTRATUS	420	" Yes , sir , but to come to My Novel . "
65307	65344	65299	65301	MR . CAXTON	409	" You see you have a fine choice here , and of a nature pleasing , and not unfamiliar , to a classical reader ; or you may borrow a hint from the early dramatic writers . "
65350	65374	65345	65345	PISISTRATUS	420	" Ay , there is something in the Drama akin to the Novel . Now , perhaps , I may catch an idea . "
65380	65435	65375	65377	MR . CAXTON	409	" For instance , the author of the ' Curiosities of Literature ' from whom , by the way , I am plagiarizing much of the information I bestow upon you tells us of a Spanish gentleman who wrote a Comedy , by which he intended to serve what he took for Moral Philosophy .

65440	65445	65436	65436	PISISTRATUS	420	" Well , sir ? "

65484	65567	65479	65481	MR . CAXTON	409	" Grave things were then called Comedies , as old things are now called Novels .

CAXTON	409	" Camarina , Mr. Squills , was a lake , apt to be low , and then liable to be muddy ; and ' Do n't disturb Camarina ' was a Greek proverb derived from an oracle of Apollo ; and from that Greek proverb , no doubt , comes the origin of the injunction , ' Quieta non movere , ' which became the favourite maxim of Sir Robert Walpole and Parson Dale . The Greek line , Mr. Squills "
66240	66250	66237	66237	Virgil	588	" ' Et cui non licitum fatis Camarina moveri . '
66251	66284	66286	66287	my father	1479	" Parson Dale , as a clergyman and a scholar , had , no doubt , these authorities at his fingers ' end . And I wonder he did not quote them , "
66289	66451	66286	66287	my father	1479	" but to be sure he is represented as a mild man , and so might not wish to humble the squire over - much in the presence of his family .

Blanche , come away from the screen , get me my slippers , and leave Pisistratus to himself . Greek line - do n't disturb Camarina . You see , my dear , "
66476	66527	66466	66466	he	1479	" you see , my dear , every house has its Camarina . Alan , who is a lazy animal , is quite content to let it alone ; but woman , being the more active , bustling , curious creature , is always for giving it a sly stir . "

66676	66721	66660	66662	MR . CAXTON	409	" I hear him , child ; I hear him . I retract my vindication of man . Oracles warn in vain : so long as there is a woman on the other side of the screen , it is all up with Camarina . "
67063	67083	67084	67084	his	542	" that he would shut up the park , and fill it illegally with mantraps and spring - guns , "

67456	67467	67469	67469	he	542	" If I had sum ' un to watch here , "
67471	67555	67469	67469	he	542	" while I takes a turn by the water - side , p'r'aps summat might come out ; p'r'aps them as did it ben't gone to church , but will come sneaking round to look on their willany ! as they says murderers are always led back to the place where they ha ' left the body . But in this here willage there ben't a man , woman , or child as has any consarn for squire or parish , barring myself . "
67594	67601	67603	67603	he	3632	" Hollo , you , sir , "
67612	67621	67603	67603	he	3632	" where be you going at that rate ? "
67622	67633	67580	67581	The superintendent	3632	" Please , sir , I be going to church . "
67634	67684	67603	67603	he	3632	" Stop , sir , - stop , Master Lenny . Going to church ! - why , the bell 's done ; and you knows the parson is very angry at them as comes in late , disturbing the congregation . You ca n't go to church now ! "
67685	67690	67580	67581	The superintendent	3632	" Please , sir - "
67691	67783	67603	67603	he	3632	" I says you ca n't go to church now . You must learn to think a little of others , lad . You sees how I sweats to serve the squire ! and you must serve him too . Why , your mother 's got the house and premishes almost rent - free ; you ought to have a grateful heart , Leonard Fairfield , and feel for his honour ! Poor man ! his heart is well - nigh bruk , I am sure , with the goings on . "
67799	67808	67810	67810	Stirn	542	" Look at that ' ere dumb cretur , "
67820	67850	67810	67810	Stirn	542	" look at it . If it could speak , what would it say , Leonard Fairfield ? Answer me that ! ' Damn the stocks , ' indeed ! "
67851	67864	67866	67866	Lenny	450	" It was very bad in them to write such naughty words , "
67870	67883	67866	67866	Lenny	450	" Mother was quite shocked when she heard of it this morning . "
67889	67904	67884	67886	MR . STIRN	542	" I dare say she was , considering what she pays for the premishes ; "
67906	67920	67884	67886	MR . STIRN	542	" you does not know who did it , - eh , Lenny ? "
67924	67934	67921	67921	LENNY	450	" No , sir ; indeed I does not ! "
67940	67993	67935	67937	MR . STIRN	542	" Well , you see , you ca n't go to church , - prayers half over by this time . You recollex that I put them stocks under your ' sponsibility , ' and see the way you 's done your duty by 'em ! I 've half a mind to - "
68006	68011	68013	68013	Lenny	450	" Please , sir , "
68019	68149	67997	67997	his	542	" No , I wo n't please ; it ben't pleasing at all . But I forgives you this time , only keep a sharp lookout , lad , in future . Now you must stay here - no , there - under the hedge , and you watches if any persons comes to loiter about , or looks at the stocks , or laughs to hisself , while I go my rounds . I shall be back either afore church is over or just arter ; so you stay till I comes , and give me your report . Be sharp , boy , or it will be worse for you and your mother ; I can let the premishes for L4 a year more to - morrow . "
68507	68510	68512	68513	poor Leonard	450	" So , "
68557	68625	68555	68555	Mother	571	" Then he began to consider that , however ungraciously Mr. Stirn had bestowed on him the appointment , still it was a compliment to him , - showed trust and confidence in him , picked him out from his contemporaries as the sober , moral , pattern boy ; and Lenny had a great deal of pride in him , especially in matters of repute and character .
69541	69566	69522	69522	he	450	" Ben't you ashamed of yourself ? Sitting on the squire 's new stocks ! Do get up , and go along with you ! "
69658	69666	69653	69653	Randal	570	" You are an insolent young blackguard . "
70000	70006	70018	70019	Lenny Fairfield	450	" a fist of it . "
70057	70064	70066	70066	Lenny	450	" You get off them stocks , "
70272	70275	70270	70270	we	3737	" honour . "
70395	70401	70402	70402	he	450	" It was not fair , "
70405	70416	70402	70402	he	450	" to fight one whom he could beat so easily . "
70436	70454	70432	70432	he	450	" There , let 's have no more of it ; but go home and be good . "
70570	70601	70539	70539	he	570	" You have struck me - and you shall not stir from this ground till I have made you repent it . Put up your hands , - defend yourself . "
70980	70990	70964	70971	not one who , by impulse and nature	3754	" Never hit a foe when he is down ; "
71246	71249	71251	71252	Mr. Stirn	542	" Hollo , "
71254	71270	71251	71252	Mr. Stirn	542	" what is all this ? What 's the matter , Lenny , you blockhead ? "
71271	71277	71279	71279	Lenny	450	" He will sit there , "
71285	71305	71307	71308	the villager	3666	" and he has beat me because I would not let him ; but I does n't mind that , "
71317	71330	71307	71308	the villager	3666	" and I am ready again for him - that I am . "
71331	71344	71307	71308	the villager	3666	" And what do you do lollopoping there on them blessed stocks ? "
71345	71358	71307	71308	the villager	3666	" Looking at the landscape ; out of my light , man ! "
71395	71404	71406	71406	Stirn	542	" And may I ask who you be ? "
71418	71431	71406	71406	Stirn	542	" What Is your name , pray ? What 's your bizness ? "
71432	71470	71499	71499	Lenny	450	" My name is Randal Leslie , and my business was to visit your master 's family , - that is , if you are , as I guess from your manner , Mr. Hazeldean 's ploughman ! "
71501	71527	71530	71530	he	570	" Let that pay you for your bruises , and remember another time how you speak to a gentleman . As for you , fellow , "
71560	71603	71530	71530	he	570	" as for you , give my compliments to Mr. Hazeldean , and say that when he does us the honour to visit us at Rood Hall , I trust that the manners of our villagers will make him ashamed of Hazeldean . "
72227	72234	72217	72217	he	542	" buzzom was a burstin ' , "
72279	72282	72266	72266	He	542	" buzzom . "
72283	72369	72266	72266	He	542	" You young willain ! you howdaeious wiper ! and so all this blessed Sabbath afternoon , when you ought to have been in church on your marrow - bones , a praying for your betters , you has been a fitting with a young gentleman , and a wisiter to your master , on the wery place of the parridge hinstitution that you was to guard and pertect ; and a bloodying it all over , I declares , with your blaggard little nose ! "
72501	72539	72637	72637	Eureka	702	" I wonder at you , Master Stirn , - if Mother could hear you ! You know it was you who would not let me go to church ; it was you who told me to - "
72540	72551	72553	72554	Mr. Stirn	542	" Fit a young gentleman , and break the Sabbath , "
72563	72606	72553	72554	Mr. Stirn	542	" Oh , yes ! I told you to disgrace his honour the squire , and me , and the parridge , and bring us all into trouble . But the squire told me to make an example , and I will ! "
72640	72642	72648	72648	he	542	" example "
73558	73575	73537	73538	the squire	1498	" A sad disgrace , Lenny , - you 'll never be in such a quandary . "

73610	73622	73624	73625	the tinker	1701	" Kettles and frying - pans ! what has us here ? "
73686	73717	73719	73720	the tinker	1701	" You in the wood , my baby ! Well , that 's the last sight I should ha ' thought to see . But we all lives to larn , "
73724	73738	73719	73720	the tinker	1701	" Who gave you them leggins ? Ca n't you speak , lad ? "
73739	73743	73835	73836	the tinker	1701	" Nick Stirn . "
73744	73764	73719	73720	the tinker	1701	" Nick Stirn ! Ay , I 'd ha ' ta'en my davy on that : and cos vy ? "
73765	73819	73820	73820	Lenny	450	" 'Cause I did as he told me , and fought a boy as was trespassing on these very stocks ; and he beat me - but I do n't care for that ; and that boy was a young gentleman , and going to visit the squire ; and so Nick Stirn - "
73830	73833	73835	73836	the tinker	1701	" Augh , "
73840	73903	73835	73836	the tinker	1701	" you fit with a young gentleman , did you ? Sorry to hear you confess that , my lad ! Sit there and be thankful you ha ' got off so cheap . ' T is salt and battery to fit with your betters , and a Lunnon justice o ' peace would have given you two months o ' the treadmill .
73904	73929	73719	73720	the tinker	1701	" But vy should you fit cos he trespassed on the stocks ? It ben't your natural side for fitting , I takes it . "
73948	73956	73958	73959	the tinker	1701	" Oh , I sees , Lenny , "
73968	74149	73958	73959	the tinker	1701	" you be one of those who would rayther ' unt with the ' ounds than run with the ' are ! You be 's the good pattern boy , and would peach agin your own border to curry favour with the grand folks . Fie , lad ! you be sarved right ; stick by your border , then you 'll be ' spected when you gets into trouble , and not be ' varsally ' spised , - as you 'll be arter church - time ! Vell , I ca n't be seen ' sorting with you , now you are in this d'rogotary fix ; it might hurt my c'r'acter , both with them as built the stocks and them as wants to pull 'em down . Old kettles to mend ! Vy , you makes me forgit the Sabbath ! Sarvent , my lad , and wish you well out of it ; ' specks to your mother , and say we can deal for the pan and shovel all the same for your misfortin . "

74475	74512	74433	74433	Riccabocca	463	" what is this , my poor boy ? You have been bleeding , and I see that those tears which you try to check come from a deep well . Tell me , povero fanciullo mio "
74531	74562	74630	74630	Lenny	450	" tell me , my child , how all this happened . Perhaps I can help you ; we have all erred , - we should all help each other . "

Did not the son of that celebrated Frenchman , surnamed Bras de Fer , write a book not only to prove that adversities are more necessary than prosperities , but that among all adversities a prison is the most pleasant and profitable ? But is not this condition of mine , voluntarily and experimentally incurred , a type of my life ? Is it the first time that I have thrust myself into a hobble ? And if in a hobble of mine own choosing , why should I blame the gods ? "

' And the good widow too ; and poor Mark , who almost died in my arms ! Stirn , you have a heart of stone ! You confounded , lawless , merciless miscreant , who the deuce gave you the right to imprison man or boy in my parish of Hazeldean without trial , sentence , or warrant ? Run and let the boy out before any one sees him : run , or I shall - "

I can bear a great deal from you , sir , as I ought to do ; but to ask my whole congregation , the moment after divine service , to go up and guzzle ale at the Hall , and drink my health , as if a clergyman 's sermon had been a speech at a cattle - fair ! I am ashamed of you , and of the parish ! What on earth has come to you all ? "
79038	79052	79054	79055	the squire	1498	" That 's the very question I wish to Heaven I could answer , "
79063	79076	79054	79055	the squire	1498	" What on earth has come to us all ? Ask Stirn : "

79334	79362	79329	79330	the squire	1498	" Well , this beats cock - fighting ! The man 's as mad as a March hare , and has taken Dr. Rickeybockey for Little Lenny ! "

79394	79422	79368	79369	the doctor	1651	" perhaps , if it be quite the same to you , before you proceed to explanations , you will just help me out of the stocks . "
79455	79466	79468	79469	Mr. Stirn	542	" Lord love your reverence , you 'd better not ! "
79471	79499	79468	79469	Mr. Stirn	542	" Do n't be tempted , - he only wants to get you into is claws . I would not go a near him for all the - "

79594	79631	79583	79584	the Italian	1688	" It is certainly a great honour ; but you will know better one of these days , when the gentleman in question admits you to a personal interview in another - and a hotter world . "
79635	79648	79650	79651	the squire	1498	" But how on earth did you get into my new stocks ? "
79657	79673	79739	79740	the squire	1498	" My dear sir , Pliny the elder got into the crater of Mount Etna . "
79674	79682	79739	79740	the squire	1498	" Did he , and what for ? "
79683	79694	79696	79696	Riccabocca	463	" To try what it was like , I suppose , "
79705	79737	79739	79740	the squire	1498	" And so you got into the stocks to try what it was like . Well , I ca n't wonder , - it is a very handsome pair of stocks , "
79753	79772	79739	79740	the squire	1498	" Nobody need be ashamed of being seen in those stocks , - I'should not mind it myself . "
79773	79780	79782	79783	the parson	1499	" We had better move on , "
79787	79871	79782	79783	the parson	1499	" or we shall have the whole village here presently , gazing on the lord of the manor in the same predicament as that from which we have just extricated the doctor . Now , pray , what is the matter with Lenny Fairfield ? I ca n't understand a word of what has passed . You do n't mean to say that good Lenny Fairfield who was absent from church , by the by can have done anything to get into disgrace ? "
79872	79879	79881	79882	the squire	1498	" Yes , he has though , "
79884	79892	79881	79882	the squire	1498	" Stirn , I say , Stirn ! "
79990	79999	80000	80000	he	1499	" Ah , Mr. Hazeldean , forgive me , "
80004	80062	80000	80000	he	1499	" I ought to have known at once that it was only some ebullition of your heart that could stifle your sense of decorum . But this is a sad story about Lenny brawling and fighting on the Sabbath - day . So unlike him , too . I do n't know what to make of it . "
80063	80068	80070	80071	the squire	1498	" Like or unlike , "
80073	80111	80070	80071	the squire	1498	" it has been a gross insult to young Leslie , and looks all the worse because I and Audley are not just the best friends in the world . I ca n't think what it is , "
80118	80238	80240	80241	the squire	1498	" but it seems that there must be always some association of fighting connected with that prim half - brother of mine . There was I , son of his own mother , - who might have been shot through the lungs , only the ball lodged in the shoulder ! and now his wife 's kinsman - my kinsman , too - grandmother a Hazeldean , - a hard - reading , sober lad , as I am given to understand , ca n't set his foot into the quietest parish in the three kingdoms , but what the mildest boy that ever was seen makes a rush at him like a mad bull . It is FATALITY ! "
80245	80257	80259	80259	Riccabocca	463	" Ancient legend records similar instances of fatality in certain houses , "
80261	80279	80259	80259	Riccabocca	463	" There was the House of Pelops , and Polynices and Eteocles , the sons of OEdipus . "
80280	80283	80285	80286	the parson	1499	" Pshaw ! "
80288	80296	80285	80286	the parson	1499	" but what 's to be done ? "
80297	80300	80302	80303	the squire	1498	" Done ? "
80305	80351	80302	80303	the squire	1498	" why , reparation must be made to young Leslie . And though I wished to spare Lenny , the young ruffian , a public disgrace - for your sake , Parson Dale , and Mrs. Fairfield 's - yet a good caning in private - "
80352	80357	80359	80359	Riccabocca	463	" Stop , sir ! "
80363	80368	80359	80359	Riccabocca	463	" and hear me . "
80417	80423	80425	80426	the squire	1498	" That alters the matter , "
80430	80450	80425	80426	the squire	1498	" and all that is necessary now will be for him to make a proper apology to my kinsman . "
80451	80458	80460	80461	the parson	1499	" Yes , that is just , "
80463	80478	80460	80461	the parson	1499	" but I still do n't learn how he got out of the stocks . "
80511	80518	80520	80521	the Athenians	4030	" Let us march against Philip ! "
80527	80538	80540	80541	the parson	1499	" Let us go at once and comfort the child ! "
80716	80723	80725	80726	the parson	1499	" No harm , my boy , "
80730	80744	80725	80726	the parson	1499	" you have nothing to fear , - all is explained and forgiven . "
80759	80762	80764	80764	he	450	" Sir , "
80768	80804	80764	80764	he	450	" I do n't want to be forgiven , - I ai n't done no wrong . And - I 've been disgraced - and I wo n't go to school , never no more . "
80805	80810	80812	80813	the parson	1499	" Hush , Carry ! "
80833	80864	80824	80824	her	1782	" Good - night , Mrs. Fairfield . I shall come and talk to you to - morrow , Lenny ; by that time you will think better of it . "
80913	80916	80918	80919	the squire	1498	" Well , "
80921	80951	80918	80919	the squire	1498	" let him go the first thing in the morning to Rood Hall , to ask Master Leslie 's pardon , and all will be right and smooth again . "

80969	81010	80959	80959	Frank	449	" to strike a gentleman and an Etonian , who had just been to call on me ! But I wonder Randal let him off so well , - any other boy in the sixth form would have killed him ! "
81011	81014	81016	81017	the parson	1499	" Frank , "
81021	81062	81016	81017	the parson	1499	" if we all had our deserts , what should be done to him who not only lets the sun go down on his own wrath , but strives with uncharitable breath to fan the dying embers of another 's ? "
81224	81227	81229	81230	the doctor	1651	" Ma'am , "
81250	81286	81229	81230	the doctor	1651	" ma'am , it is very hard that you should make one remember the end of the world , since , in conversing with you , one 's natural temptation is to forget its existence . "
81345	81352	81354	81355	Miss Jemima	528	" He is about to propose , "
81357	81360	81365	81365	he	463	" Giacomo , "
81381	81394	81365	81365	he	463	" I think we shall get that boy for the garden now ! "
81850	81861	81842	81842	he	450	" Who was put into the stocks ? - baa ! "
81862	81878	81842	81842	he	450	" Who got a bloody nob for playing spy to Nick Stirn ? - baa ! "
81950	81955	81957	81957	he	450	" Please , sir , "
81982	82033	81959	81960	the doctor	1651	" please , sir , if you 'll be good enough to take me now , and give me any hole to sleep in , I 'll work for your honour night and day ; and as for wages , Mother says , ' just suit yourself , sir . ' "
82034	82038	82040	82041	the doctor	1651	" My child , "
82061	82089	82040	82041	the doctor	1651	" I knew you would come ! and Giacomo is already prepared for you ! As to wages , we 'll talk of them by and by . "
82228	82228	82237	82241	the good - natured steward	4110	"
82229	82235	82237	82241	the good - natured steward	4110	" You 're a fool , "
82243	82282	82237	82241	the good - natured steward	4110	" and I 'm very glad you did not speak to that fellow Stirn instead of to me . You 've been doing extremely well here , and have the place , I may say , for nothing . "
82283	82300	82302	82303	the widow	1592	" Nothin' as to rent , sir , but a great deal as to feelin ' , "
82305	82328	82302	82303	the widow	1592	" And now Lenny has gone to work with the foreign gentleman , I should like to go and live near him . "
82329	82377	82237	82241	the good - natured steward	4110	" Ah , yes , I heard Lenny had taken himself off to the Casino , more fool he ; but , bless your heart , ' t is no distance , - two miles or so . Ca n't he come home every night after work ? "
82378	82383	82385	82386	the widow	1592	" No , sir , "
82391	82635	82385	82386	the widow	1592	" he sha'n't come home here , to be called bad names and jeered at ! - he whom my dead good man was so fond and proud of . No , sir ; we poor folks have our feelings , as I said to Mrs. Dale , and as I will say to the squire hisself . Not that I do n't thank him for all favours , - he be a good gentleman if let alone ; but he says he wo n't come near us till Lenny goes and axes pardin . Pardin for what , I should like to know ? Poor lamb ! I wish you could ha ' seen his nose , sir , - as big as your two fists . Ax pardin ! if the squire had had such a nose as that , I do n't think it 's pardin he 'd been ha ' axing . But I let the passion get the better of me , - I humbly beg you 'll excuse it , sir . I 'm no schollard , as poor Mark was , and Lenny would have been , if the Lord had not visited us otherways . Therefore just get the squire to let me go as soon as may be ; and as for the bit o ' hay and what 's on the grounds and orchard , the new comer will no doubt settle that . "
82735	82738	82732	82732	he	1889	" Harry . "
83194	83207	83190	83190	she	452	" would soon die away if no notice was taken of it . "
83346	83349	83351	83352	the squire	1498	" Parson ! "
83381	83428	83363	83363	he	1498	" this is all your fault . Why did you not go and talk to that brute of a boy and that dolt of a woman ? You 've got ' soft sawder enough , ' as Frank calls it in his new - fashioned slang . "
83429	83441	83443	83444	the parson	1499	" As if I had not talked myself hoarse to both ! "
83456	83483	83443	83444	the parson	1499	" But it was in vain ! O Squire , if you had taken my advice about the stocks , - ' quieta non movere ' ! "
83484	83487	83489	83490	the squire	1498	" Bother ! "
83492	83793	83795	83796	the squire	1498	" I suppose I am to be held up as a tyrant , a Nero , a Richard the Third , or a Grand Inquisitor , merely for having things smart and tidy ! Stocks indeed ! Your friend Rickeybockey said he was never more comfortable in his life , - quite enjoyed sitting there . And what did not hurt Rickeybockey 's dignity a very gentlemanlike man he is , when he pleases ought to be no such great matter to Master Leonard Fairfield . But ' t is no use talking ! What 's to be done now ? The woman must not starve ; and I 'm sure she ca n't live out of Rickeybockey 's wages to Lenny , - by the way , I hope he do n't board the boy upon his and Jackeymo 's leavings : I hear they dine upon newts and sticklebacks , faugh ! I 'll tell you what , Parson , now I think of it , at the back of the cottage which she has taken there are some fields of capital land just vacant . Rickeybockey wants to have 'em , and sounded me as to the rent when he was at the Hall . I only half promised him the refusal . And he must give up four or five acres of the best land round the cottage to the widow - just enough for her to manage - and she can keep a dairy . If she want capital , I 'll lend her some in your name , - only do n't tell Stirn ; and as for the rent - we 'll talk of that when we see how she gets on , thankless , obstinate jade that she is ! You see , "
83821	83923	83800	83800	he	1498	" her husband was a faithful servant , and so - I wish you would not stand there staring me out of countenance , but go down to the woman at once , or Stirn will have let the land to Rickeybockey , as sure as a gun . And hark ye , Dale , perhaps you can contrive , if the woman is so cursedly stiffbacked , not to say the land is mine , or that it is any favour I want to do her - or , in short , manage it as you can for the best . "
83950	84040	83931	83932	The widow	1592	" She thanked him humbly for that and all favours ; but she could not afford to buy cows , and she did not wish to be beholden to any one for her living . And Lenny was well off at Mr. Rickeybockey 's , and coming on wonderfully in the garden way , and she did not doubt she could get some washing ; at all events , her haystack would bring in a good bit of money , and she should do nicely , thank their honours .

88021	88031	87993	87993	Riccabocca	463	" I would talk to thee of my child . "
88035	88050	87993	87993	Riccabocca	463	" The letter , then , relates to the signorina . She is well ? "
88051	88066	88067	88067	Jackeymo	485	" Yes , she is well now . She is in our native Italy . "
88094	88104	88106	88106	he	485	" Those are sweet even here , with care , "
88113	88125	88106	88106	he	485	" I think I have said that before to the padrone . "
88150	88157	88159	88159	he	463	" My aunt is no more ! "
88165	88173	88175	88175	Jackeymo	485	" We will pray for her soul ! "
88179	88218	88175	88175	Jackeymo	485	" But she was very old , and had been a long time ailing . Let it not grieve the padrone too keenly : at that age , and with those infirmities , death comes as a friend . "
88219	88226	88228	88229	the Italian	1688	" Peace be to her dust ! "
88231	88290	88228	88229	the Italian	1688	" If she had her faults , be they now forgotten forever ; and in the hour of my danger and distress she sheltered my infant ! That shelter is destroyed . This letter is from the priest , her confessor . And the home of which my child is bereaved falls to the inheritance of my enemy . "
88291	88294	88296	88296	Jackeymo	485	" Traitor ! "
88321	88325	88327	88327	Riccabocca	463	" The priest , "
88331	88353	88327	88327	Riccabocca	463	" has rightly judged in removing my child as a guest from the house in which that traitor enters as lord . "
88354	88361	88327	88327	Riccabocca	463	" And where is the signorina ? "
88362	88398	88327	88327	Riccabocca	463	" With the poor priest . See , Giacomo , here , here - this is her handwriting at the end of the letter , - the first lines she ever yet traced to me . "
88472	88479	88469	88469	Riccabocca	463	" The priest recommends a convent . "
88480	88488	88490	88491	the servant	3272	" To the devil with the priest ! "
88501	88531	88498	88498	he	3272	" I did not mean that , Monsignore San Giacomo , - forgive me ! But your Excellency does not think of making a nun of his only child ! "
88558	88564	88566	88566	Riccabocca	463	" And yet why not ? "
88570	88599	88566	88566	Riccabocca	463	" what can I give her in the world ? Is the land of the stranger a better refuge than the home of peace in her native clime ? "
88600	88613	88498	88498	he	3272	" In the land of the stranger beats her father 's heart ! "
88614	88673	88566	88566	Riccabocca	463	" And if that beat were stilled , what then ? Ill fares the life that a single death can bereave of all . In a convent at least and the priest 's influence can obtain her that asylum amongst her equals and amidst her sex she is safe from trial and from penury - to her grave ! "
88674	88692	88498	88498	he	3272	" Penury ! Just see how rich we shall be when we take those fields at Michaelmas . "
88693	88696	88701	88701	Riccabocca	463	" Pazzie ! "
88705	88746	88748	88749	the father	2917	" Are these suns more serene than ours , or the soil more fertile ? Yet in our own Italy , saith the proverb , ' He who sows land reaps more care than corn . ' It were different , "
88762	88855	88748	88749	the father	2917	" if I had some independence , however small , to count on , - nay , if among all my tribe of dainty relatives there were but one female who would accompany Violante to the exile 's hearth , - Ishmael had his Hagar . But how can we two rough - bearded men provide for all the nameless wants and cares of a frail female child ? And she has been so delicately reared , - the woman - child needs the fostering hand and tender eye of a woman . "
88856	88862	88864	88864	Jackeymo	485	" And with a word , "
88868	89029	88864	88864	Jackeymo	485	" the padrone might secure to his child all that he needs to save her from the sepulchre of a convent ; and ere the autumn leaves fall , she might be sitting on his knee . Padrone , do not think that you can conceal from me the truth , that you love your child better than all things in the world , - now the Patria is as dead to you as the dust of your fathers , - and your heart - strings would crack with the effort to tear her from them , and consign her to a convent . Padrone , never again to hear her voice , never again to see her face ! Those little arms that twined round your neck that dark night , when we fled fast for life and freedom , and you said , as you felt their clasp , ' Friend , all is not yet lost . ' "
89030	89033	89035	89036	the father	2917	" Giacomo ! "
89083	89168	89080	89080	he	463	" Yes , Heaven is my witness that I could have borne reverse and banishment without a murmur , had I permitted myself that young partner in exile and privation . Heaven is my witness that , if I hesitate now , it is because I would not listen to my own selfish heart . Yet never , never to see her again , - my child ! And it was but as the infant that I beheld her ! O friend , friend ! "
89190	89218	89180	89180	he	463	" thou knowest what I have endured and suffered at my hearth , as in my country ; the wrong , the perfidy , the - the - "
89239	89254	89256	89256	Giacomo	487	" But your child , the innocent one - think now only of her ! "
89264	89271	89273	89274	the exile	1962	" True , only of her , "
89280	89392	89273	89274	the exile	1962	" only of her . Put aside thy thoughts for thyself , friend , - counsel me . If I were to send for Violante , and if , transplanted to these keen airs , she drooped and died - Look , look , the priest says that she needs such tender care ; or if I myself were summoned from the world , to leave her in it alone , friendless , homeless , breadless perhaps , at the age of woman 's sharpest trial against temptation , would she not live to mourn the cruel egotism that closed on her infant innocence the gates of the House of God ? "
89477	89483	89485	89485	Jackeymo	485	" But again I say , "
89496	89509	89485	89485	Jackeymo	485	" if the padrone would make up his mind - to marry ! "
89585	89591	89593	89594	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" Give me the pipe , "

89724	89759	89893	89893	Riccabocca	463	" Never mind : lay the book there . I wish to speak with you . You look well , my child : this air agrees with you as well as that of Hazeldean ? "
89760	89767	89704	89706	the young peasant	4375	" Oh , yes , Sir ! "
89768	89779	89893	89893	Riccabocca	463	" Yet it is higher ground , - more exposed ? "
89780	89788	89790	89790	Lenny	450	" That can hardly be , sir , "
89792	89825	89790	89790	Lenny	450	" there are many plants grow here which do n't flourish at the squire 's . The hill yonder keeps off the east wind , and the place lays to the south . "
89826	89843	89893	89893	Riccabocca	463	" Lies , not lays , Lenny . What are the principal complaints in these parts ? "
89844	89849	89790	89790	Lenny	450	" Eh , sir ? "
89850	89859	89893	89893	Riccabocca	463	" I mean what maladies , what diseases ? "
89860	89874	89790	89790	Lenny	450	" I never heard tell of any , sir , except the rheumatism . "

89884	89892	89790	89790	Lenny	450	" Never heard of them , sir . "
89903	89914	89893	89893	Riccabocca	463	" That seems a very kind family at the Hall . "
89915	89924	89926	89926	Lenny	450	" I have nothing to say against it , "
89930	89966	89926	89926	Lenny	450	" I have not been treated justly . But as that book says , sir , ' It is not every one who comes into the world with a silver spoon in his mouth . ' "
90005	90023	89982	89982	He	1651	" Yes ; a kind , English domestic family . Did you see much of Miss Hazeldean ? "
90024	90033	89969	89970	the doctor	1651	" Not so much as of the Lady . "
90034	90045	89982	89982	He	1651	" Is she liked in the village , think you ? "
90046	90097	90099	90099	Lenny	450	" Miss Jemima ? Yes . She never did harm . Her little dog bit me once , - she did not ask me to beg its pardon , she asked mine ! She 's a very nice young lady ; the girls say she is very affable ; and , "
90105	90121	90099	90099	Lenny	450	" there are always more weddings going on when she is down at the Hall . "
90122	90125	90127	90127	Riccabocca	463	" Oh ! "
90136	90158	90127	90127	Riccabocca	463	" Did you ever see her play with the little children ? Is she fond of children , do you think ? "
90159	90182	89982	89982	He	1651	" Lord , sir , you guess everything ! She 's never so pleased as when she 's playing with the babies . "
90183	90186	90188	90188	Riccabocca	463	" Humph ! "
90190	90218	90188	90188	Riccabocca	463	" Babies ! well , that 's woman - like . I do n't mean exactly babies , but when they 're older , - little girls ? "
90219	90230	90232	90232	Lenny	450	" Indeed , Sir , I dare say ; but , "
90236	90248	90232	90232	Lenny	450	" I never as yet kept company with the little girls . "
90249	90287	89982	89982	He	1651	" Quite right , Lenny ; be equally discreet all your life . Mrs. Dale is very intimate with Miss Hazeldean , - more than with the squire 's lady . Why is that , think you ? "
90288	90293	90295	90295	Leonard	450	" Well , sir , "
90299	90352	90295	90295	Leonard	450	" Mrs. Dale has her little tempers , though she 's a very good lady ; and Madame Hazeldean is rather high , and has a spirit . But Miss Jemima is so soft : any one could live with Miss Jemima , as Joe and the servants say at the Hall . "
90353	90383	89982	89982	He	1651	" Indeed ! get my hat out of the parlour , and - just bring a clothes - brush , Lenny . A fine sunny day for a walk . "

91778	91781	91766	91767	Mrs. Dale	470	" dear . "
91787	91814	91782	91784	DR . RICCABOCCA	755	" Nay , before speaking to Miss Hazeldean , it would surely be proper to know how far my addresses would be acceptable to the family . "
91820	91823	91815	91817	MRS . DALE	470	" Ah ! "
91829	91841	91824	91826	DR . RICCAROCCA	755	" The squire is of course the head of the family . "
91850	91862	91842	91844	MRS . DALE	470	" The squire - yes , very true - quite proper . "
91871	91979	91980	91982	DR . RICCASOCCA	755	" Can you believe me ? I never thought of the squire . And he is such an odd man , and has so many English prejudices , that really - dear me , how vexatious that it should never once have occurred to me that Mr. Hazeldean had a voice in the matter ! Indeed , the relationship is so distant , it is not like being her father ; and Jemima is of age , and can do as she pleases ; and - but , as you say , it is quite proper that he should be consulted as the head of the family . "
91985	92055	91980	91982	DR . RICCASOCCA	755	" And you think that the Squire of Hazeldean might reject my alliance ! Pshaw ! that 's a grand word indeed , - I mean , that he might object very reasonably to his cousin 's marriage with a foreigner , of whom he can know nothing , except that which in all countries is disreputable , and is said in this to be criminal , - poverty . "
92061	92114	92056	92058	MRS . DALE	470	" You misjudge us poor English people , and you wrong the squire , Heaven bless him ! for we were poor enough when he singled out my husband from a hundred for the minister of his parish , for his neighbour and his friend . I will speak to him fearlessly - "
92120	92186	92115	92117	DR . RICCABOCCA	755	" And frankly . And now I have used that word , let me go on with the confession which your kindly readiness , my fair friend , somewhat interrupted . I said that if I might presume to think my addresses would be acceptable to Miss Hazeldean and her family , I was too sensible of her amiable qualities not to - not to - "
92195	92214	92187	92189	MRS . DALE	470	" Not to be the happiest of men , - that 's the customary English phrase , Doctor . "
92219	92229	92231	92231	he	463	" There can not be a better . But , "
92235	92251	92231	92231	he	463	" I wish it first to be understood that I have - been married before ! "
92258	92262	92252	92254	MRS . DALE	470	" Married before ! "
92266	92353	92263	92263	RICCABOCCA	463	" And that I have an only child , dear to me , - inexpressibly dear . That child , a daughter , has hitherto lived abroad ; circumstances now render it desirable that she should make her home with me ; and I own fairly that nothing has so attached me to Miss Hazeldean , nor so induced my desire for our matrimonial connection , as my belief that she has the heart and the temper to become a kind mother to my little one . "
92363	92370	92354	92356	MRS . DALE	470	" You judge her rightly there . "
92374	92410	92371	92371	RICCABOCCA	463	" Now , in pecuniary matters , as you may conjecture from my mode of life , I have nothing to offer to Miss Hazeldean correspondent with her own fortune , whatever that may be ! "
92416	92437	92411	92413	MRS . DALE	470	" That difficulty is obviated by settling Miss Hazeldean 's fortune on herself , which is customary in such cases . "
92444	92451	92453	92453	he	463	" And my child , then ? "
92490	92507	92475	92476	Mrs. Dale	470	" But that child is not Jemima 's , and you may have children by her . "
92516	92554	92508	92508	She	470	" But from what you and Jemima may jointly possess you can save something annually , - you can insure your life for your child . We did so when our poor child whom we lost was born "
92564	92585	92559	92560	Mrs. Dale	470	" and I fear that Charles still insures his life for my sake , though Heaven knows that - that - "
92741	92745	92747	92747	she	470	" You see , "
92751	92785	92747	92747	she	470	" though the squire might be glad to see Jemima married to some Englishman , yet if he asks who and what is this Dr. Riccabocca , how am I to answer him ? "
92786	92795	92797	92798	Mr. Dale	446	" You should have thought of that before , "
92804	92844	92846	92847	the parson	1499	" and , indeed , if I had ever believed anything serious could come out of what seemed to me so absurd , I should long since have requested you not to interfere in such matters . Good heavens ! "
92852	92894	92846	92847	the parson	1499	" if we should have assisted , underhand as it were , to introduce into the family of a man to whom we owe so much a connection that he would dislike , how base we should be , how ungrateful ! "
93143	93249	93130	93131	Mr. Dale	446	" Well , do n't vex yourself , - and I was to blame quite as much as you . But , indeed , I should have thought it easier for the squire to have transplanted one of his tall cedars into his kitchen - garden than for you to inveigle Dr. Riccabocca into matrimonial intentions . But a man who could voluntarily put himself into the parish stocks for the sake of experiment must be capable of anything ! However , I think it better that I , rather than yourself , should speak to the squire , and I will go at once . "

93778	93819	93774	93775	the squire	1498	" that he did not see why he should be always putting himself out of his way to show kindness to those who made such a return . There ought to be a difference between the good and the bad . "

94447	94452	94461	94461	he	449	" Well , Parson , "
94477	94497	94461	94461	he	449	" I wish you joy of your flock , - you see they have just hanged me in effigy ! "
94535	94541	94888	94889	the parson	1499	" It is very bad , "
94545	94573	94888	94889	the parson	1499	" but not so bad as all that , Squire ; that 's not the shape of your bat . It is evidently meant for Mr. Stirn . "
94574	94580	94582	94583	the squire	1498	" Do you think so ? "
94587	94601	94582	94583	the squire	1498	" Yet the top - boots - Stirn never wears top - boots . "
94602	94689	94888	94889	the parson	1499	" No more do you , except in the hunting - field . If you look again , those are not tops , they are leggings , - Stirn wears leggings . Besides , that flourish , which is meant for a nose , is a kind of hook , like Stirn 's ; whereas your nose - though by no means a snub - rather turns up than not , as the Apollo 's does , according to the plaster cast in Riccabocca 's parlour . "
94690	94694	94696	94697	the squire	1498	" Poor Stirn ! "
94711	94783	94696	94697	the squire	1498	" that 's what a man gets in this world by being a faithful servant , and doing his duty with zeal for his employer . But you see things have come to a strange pass , and the question now is , what course to pursue . The miscreants hitherto have defied all vigilance , and Stirn recommends the employment of a regular nightwatch , with a lanthorn and bludgeon . "
94784	94806	94888	94889	the parson	1499	" That may protect the stocks certainly ; but will it keep those detestable tracts out of the beer - house ? "
94807	94820	94696	94697	the squire	1498	" We shall shut the beer - house up the next sessions . "
94821	94837	94888	94889	the parson	1499	" The tracts will break out elsewhere , - the humour 's in the blood ! "
94838	94873	94696	94697	the squire	1498	" I 've half a mind to run off to Brighton or Leamingtongood hunting at Leamington - for a year , just to let the rogues see how they can get on without me ! "
94880	94886	94888	94889	the parson	1499	" My dear Mr. Hazeldean , "
94897	94981	94888	94889	the parson	1499	" I do n't want to parade my superior wisdom ; but , if you had taken my advice , ' quieta non movere ! ' Was there ever a parish so peaceable as this , or a country gentleman so beloved as you were , before you undertook the task which has dethroned kings and ruined States , - that of wantonly meddling with antiquity , whether for the purpose of uncalled - for repairs , or the revival of obsolete uses . "
95003	95078	94998	94998	he	1498	" If it were to do again , faith , I would leave the parish to the enjoyment of the shabbiest pair of stocks that ever disgraced a village . Certainly I meant it for the best , - an ornament to the green ; however , now the stocks is rebuilt , the stocks must be supported . Will Hazeldean is not the man to give way to a set of thankless rapscallions . "
95079	95083	95085	95086	the parson	1499	" I think , "
95088	95136	95085	95086	the parson	1499	" that you will allow that the House of Tudor , whatever its faults , was a determined , resolute dynasty enough , - high - hearted and strong - headed . A Tudor would never have fallen into the same calamities as the poor Stuart did ! "
95137	95153	94998	94998	he	1498	" What the plague has the House of Tudor got to do with my stocks ? "
95154	95214	95085	95086	the parson	1499	" A great deal . Henry VIII . found a subsidy so unpopular that he gave it up ; and the people , in return , allowed him to cut off as many heads as he pleased , besides those in his own family . Good Queen Bess , who , I know , is your idol in history - "
95215	95229	94998	94998	he	1498	" To be sure ! - she knighted my ancestor at Tilbury Fort . "
95230	95268	95085	95086	the parson	1499	" Good Queen Bess struggled hard to maintain a certain monopoly ; she saw it would not do , and she surrendered it with that frank heartiness which becomes a sovereign , and makes surrender a grace . "
95269	95282	94998	94998	he	1498	" Ha ! and you would have me give up the stocks ? "
95283	95366	95085	95086	the parson	1499	" I would much rather the stocks had remained as it was before you touched it ; but , as it is , if you could find a good plausible pretext - and there is an excellent one at hand , - the sternest kings open prisons , and grant favours , upon joyful occasions . Now a marriage in the royal family is of course a joyful occasion ! and so it should be in that of the King of Hazeldean . "
95400	95416	95085	95086	the parson	1499	" A marriage , - yes ; but Frank has only just got into coattails ! "
95417	95431	95435	95436	The squire	1498	" I did not allude to Frank , but to your cousin Jemima ! "
95540	95561	95535	95535	his	1498	" Them as a cut out the mon a hanging , as a put it in the squire 's head ! "
95562	95566	95568	95571	his grand - daughter	4528	" Put what ? "
95573	95577	95579	95579	Solomons	540	" The gallus ! "
95582	95643	95579	95579	Solomons	540	" he be a going to have it hung from the great elfin - tree . And the parson , good mon , is a quoting Scripter agin it ; you see he 's a taking off his gloves , and a putting his two han 's together , as he do when he pray for the sick , Jeany . "
95816	95837	95810	95811	the parson	1499	" That this was a delicacy which could not be expected from every English pretender to the lady 's hand . "
96055	96061	96062	96062	they	4552	" assurance of a husband , "
96109	96208	96210	96211	the squire	1498	" That Mr. Rickeybockey had behaved very much like a gentleman , and that he was very much obliged to him ; that he the squire had no right to interfere in the matter , further than with his advice ; that Jemima was old enough to choose for herself , and that , as the parson had implied , after all she might go farther and fare worse , - indeed , the farther she went that is , the longer she waited the worse she was likely to fare . I own , for my part , "
96213	96306	96210	96211	the squire	1498	" that though I like Rickeybockey very much , I never suspected that Jemima was caught with his long face ; but there 's no accounting for tastes . My Harry , indeed , was more shrewd , and gave me many a hint , for which I only laughed at her . Still I ought to have thought it looked queer when Mounseer took to disguising himself by leaving off his glasses , ha , ha ! I wonder what Harry will say ; let 's go and talk to her . "
96424	96429	96439	96439	she	497	" Fie , William ! "
96444	96455	96439	96439	she	497	" Well , who 's going to be married now ? "
96456	96472	96474	96475	the squire	1498	" Lord ! was there ever such a woman ? - she 's guessed it ! "
96481	96490	96474	96475	the squire	1498	" Tell her all about it , Parson . "
96544	96833	96515	96515	she	497	" Signor Riccabocca had behaved very handsomely ; and though a daughter of the Hazeldeans of Hazeldean might expect a much better marriage in a worldly point of view , yet as the lady in question had deferred finding one so long , it would be equally idle and impertinent now to quarrel with her choice , - if indeed she should decide on accepting Signor Riccabocca . As for fortune , that was a consideration for the two contracting parties . Still , it ought , to be pointed out to Miss Jemima that the interest of her fortune would afford but a very small income . That Dr. Riccabocca was a widower was another matter for deliberation ; and it seemed rather suspicious that he should have been hitherto so close upon all matters connected with his former life . Certainly his manners were in his favour , and as long as he was merely an acquaintance , and at most a tenant , no one had a right to institute inquiries of a strictly private nature ; but that , when he was about to marry a Hazeldean of Hazeldean , it became the squire at least to know a little more about him , - who and what he was . Why did he leave his own country ? English people went abroad to save : no foreigner would choose England as a country in which to save money ! She supposed that a foreign doctor was no very great things ; probably he had been a professor in some Italian university . At all events , if the squire interfered at all , it was on such points that he should request information . "
96834	96839	96841	96842	the parson	1499	" My clear madam , "
96844	97029	96841	96842	the parson	1499	" what you say is extremely just . As to the causes which have induced our friend to expatriate himself , I think we need not look far for them . He is evidently one of the many Italian refugees whom political disturbances have driven to a land of which it is the boast to receive all exiles of whatever party . For his respectability of birth and family he certainly ought to obtain some vouchers . And if that be the only objection , I trust we may soon congratulate Miss Hazeldean on a marriage with a man who , though certainly very poor , has borne privations without a murmur ; has preferred all hardship to debt ; has scorned to attempt betraying the young lady into any clandestine connection ; who , in short , has shown himself so upright and honest , that I hope my dear Mr. Hazeldean will forgive him if he is only a doctor - probably of Laws - and not , as most foreigners pretend to be , a marquis or a baron at least . "
97030	97035	97037	97038	the squire	1498	" As to that , "
97040	97232	97037	97038	the squire	1498	" It is the best thing I know about Rickeybockey that he do n't attempt to humbug us by any such foreign trumpery . Thank Heaven , the Hazeldeans of Hazeldean were never tuft - hunters and title - mongers ; and if I never ran after an English lord , I should certainly be devilishly ashamed of a brother - in - law whom I was forced to call markee or count ! I should feel sure he was a courier , or runaway valley - de - sham . Turn up your nose at a doctor , indeed , Harry ! - pshaw , good English style that ! Doctor ! my aunt married a Doctor of Divinity - excellent man - wore a wig and was made a dean ! So long as Rickeybockey is not a doctor of physic , I do n't care a button . If he 's that , indeed , it would be suspicious ; because , you see , those foreign doctors of physic are quacks , and tell fortunes , and go about on a stage with a Merry - Andrew . "
97233	97248	97250	97250	Harry	1064	" Lord ! Hazeldean , where on earth did you pick up that idea ? "
97254	97364	97037	97038	the squire	1498	" Pick it up ! - why , I saw a fellow myself at the cattle fair last year - when I was buying short - horns - with a red waistcoat and a cocked hat , a little like the parson 's shovel . He called himself Dr. Phoscophornio , and sold pills . The Merry - Andrew was the funniest creature , in salmon - coloured tights , turned head over heels , and said he came from Timbuctoo . No , no : if Rickeybockey 's a physic Doctor , we shall have Jemima in a pink tinsel dress tramping about the country in a caravan ! "
97665	97672	97646	97647	The parson	1499	" Who was besotted with titles . "
97717	97721	97723	97723	he	1498	" And though , "
97727	97840	97723	97723	he	1498	" the squire is a warm politician in his own country , and would never see his sister again , I fear , if she married some convicted enemy of our happy constitution , yet for foreign politics he does not care a straw ; so that if , as I suspect , your exile arises from some quarrel with your government , - which , being foreign , he takes for granted must be insupportable , - he would but consider you as he would a Saxon who fled from the iron hand of William the Conqueror , or a Lancastrian expelled by the Yorkists in our Wars of the Roses . "
97845	97852	97854	97854	he	1688	" Mr. Hazeldean shall be satisfied , "
97858	97936	97854	97854	he	1688	" I see , by the squire 's newspaper , that an English gentleman who knew me in my own country has just arrived in London . I will write to him for a testimonial , at least to my probity and character . Probably he may be known to you by name , - nay , he must be , for he was a distinguished officer in the late war . I allude to Lord L'Estrange . "
97941	97956	97937	97938	The parson	1499	" You know Lord L'Estrange ? - profligate , bad man , I fear . "
97957	97962	97964	97964	Riccabocca	463	" Profligate ! bad ! "
97966	98022	97964	97964	Riccabocca	463	" Well , calumnious as the world is , I should never have thought that such expressions would be applied to one who , though I knew him but little , - knew him chiefly by the service he once rendered to me , - first taught me to love and revere the English name ! "

98060	98090	98058	98058	he	446	" it is many years ago ; and in short the opinion I then formed of the nobleman you named was based upon circumstances which I can not communicate . "
98118	98150	98115	98115	he	446	" Whatever your impression respecting Lord L'Estrange , there is nothing , I suppose , which would lead you to doubt his honour , or reject his testimonial in my favour ? "
98151	98157	98159	98160	Mr. Dale	446	" According to fashionable morality , "
98165	98209	98159	98160	Mr. Dale	446	" I know of nothing that could induce me to suppose that Lord L'Estrange would not , in this instance , speak the truth . And he has unquestionably a high reputation as a soldier , and a considerable position in the world . "

98683	98922	98680	98680	Riccabocca	463	" In much of what you have urged so ably , and so suddenly , I am inclined to agree . But base is the man who formally forswears the creed he has inherited from his fathers , and professed since the cradle up to years of maturity , when the change presents itself in the guise of a bribe ; when , for such is human nature , he can hardly distinguish or disentangle the appeal to his reason from the lure to his interests , - here a text , and there a dowry ! - here Protestantism , there Jemima ! Own , my friend , that the soberest casuist would see double under the inebriating effects produced by so mixing his polemical liquors . Appeal , my good Mr. Dale , from Philip drunken to Philip sober ! - from Riccabocca intoxicated with the assurance of your excellent lady , that he is about to be ' the happiest of men , ' to Riccabocca accustomed to his happiness , and carrying it off with the seasoned equability of one grown familiar with stimulants , - in a word , appeal from Riccabocca the wooer to Riccabocca the spouse . I may be convertible , but conversion is a slow progress ; courtship should be a quick one , - ask Miss Jemima . Finalmente , marry me first , and convert me afterwards ! "
98923	98930	98932	98933	the parson	1499	" You take this too jestingly , "
98935	98960	98932	98933	the parson	1499	" and I do n't see why , with your excellent understanding , truths so plain and obvious should not strike you at once . "
98961	98964	98966	98966	Riccabocca	463	" Truths , "
98970	99045	99047	99047	he	463	" are the slowest growing things in the world ! It took fifteen hundred years from the date of the Christian era to produce your own Luther , and then he flung his Bible at Satan I have seen the mark made by the book on the wall of his prison in Germany , besides running off with a nun , which no Protestant clergyman would think it proper and right to do nowadays . "
99053	99179	99047	99047	he	463	" Look you , my dear sir , I should lose my own esteem if I were even to listen to you now with becoming attention , - now , I say , when you hint that the creed I have professed may be in the way of my advantage . If so , I must keep the creed and resign the advantage . But if , as I trust not only as a Christian but a man of honour , you will defer this discussion , I will promise to listen to you hereafter ; and though , to say truth , I believe that you will not convert me , I will promise you faithfully never to interfere with my wife 's religion . "
99180	99188	99047	99047	he	463	" And any children you may have ? "
99189	99192	99194	99195	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" Children ! "
99199	99293	99194	99195	Dr. Riccabocca	463	" you are not contented with firing your pocket - pistol right in my face ! you must also pepper me all over with small shot . Children ! well , if they are girls , let them follow the faith of their mother ; and if boys , while in childhood , let them be contented with learning to be Christians ; and when they grow into men , let them choose for themselves which is the best form for the practice of the great principles which all sects have in common . "
99294	99297	99299	99300	Mr. Dale	446	" But , "
99448	99491	99444	99444	he	1498	" Well , it is certainly a great pity that Rickeybockey is not of the Church of England ; though , I take it , that would be unreasonable to expect in a man born and bred under the nose of the Inquisition "

It 's all your fault for not thinking of it before ; and I 've now just made up my mind as to the course to pursue respecting the d - -d stocks ! "

And he did this the more confidently , inasmuch as he could not but be aware of Miss Jemima 's SECRET feelings towards him , while he was proud and happy to say , that his dear and distinguished cousin , Mr. Sharpe Currie , had honoured him with a warmth of regard which justified the most brilliant EXPECTATIONS , - likely to be soon realized , as his eminent relative had contracted a very bad liver complaint in the service of his country , and could not last long !

102180	102346	102348	102349	the squire	1498	" nay , we are all human , and every man has his hobby ; sometimes he breaks in the hobby , and sometimes the hobby , if it is very hard in the mouth , breaks in him . One man 's hobby has an ill habit of always stopping at the public house ! Laughter . Another man 's hobby refuses to stir a peg beyond the door where some buxom lass patted its neck the week before , - a hobby I rode pretty often when I went courting my good wife here ! Much laughter and applause . Others have a lazy hobby that there 's no getting on ; others , a runaway hobby that there 's no stopping : but to cut the matter short , my favourite hobby , as you well know , is always trotted out to any place on my property which seems to want the eye and hand of the master . I hate , "
102353	102717	102348	102349	the squire	1498	" to see things neglected and decayed , and going to the dogs ! This land we live in is a good mother to us , and we ca n't do too much for her . It is very true , neighbours , that I owe her a good many acres , and ought to speak well of her ; but what then ? I live amongst you , and what I take from the rent with one hand , I divide amongst you with the other . Low but assenting murmurs . Now the more I improve my property , the more mouths it feeds . My great - grandfather kept a Field - book in which were entered not only the names of all the farmers and the quantity of land they held , but the average number of the labourers each employed . My grandfather and father followed his example : I have done the same . I find , neighbours , that our rents have doubled since my great - grandfather began to make the book . Ay , - but there are more than four times the number of labourers employed on the estate , and at much better wages too ! Well , my men , that says a great deal in favour of improving property , and not letting it go to the dogs . Applause . And therefore , neighbours , you will kindly excuse my bobby : it carries grist to your mill . Reiterated applause . Well , but you will say , ' What 's the squire driving at ? ' Why this , my friends : There was only one worn - out , dilapidated , tumble - down thing in the parish of Hazeldean , and it became an eyesore to me ; so I saddled my hobby , and rode at it . Oh , ho ! you know what I mean now ! Yes , but , neighbours , you need not have taken it so to heart . That was a scurvy trick of some of you to hang me in effigy , as they call it . "

102818	103125	102814	102814	he	1498	" more shame for you . It showed some pluck to hang the master ; but to hang the poor servant , who only thought to do his duty , careless of what ill - will it brought upon him , was a shabby trick , - so little like the lads of Hazeldean , that I suspect the man who taught it to them was never born in the parish . But let bygones be bygones . One thing is clear , - you do n't take kindly to my new pair of stocks ! The stocks has been a stumbling - block and a grievance , and there 's no denying that we went on very pleasantly without it . I may also say that , in spite of it , we have been coming together again lately . And I ca n't tell you what good it did me to see your children playing again on the green , and your honest faces , in spite of the stocks , and those diabolical tracts you 've been reading lately , lighted up at the thought that something pleasant was going on at the Hall . Do you know , neighbours , you put me in mind of an old story which , besides applying to the parish , all who are married , and all who intend to marry , will do well to recollect . A worthy couple , named John and Joan , had lived happily together many a long year , till one unlucky day they bought a new bolster . Joan said the bolster was too hard , and John that it was too soft . So , of course , they quarrelled . After sulking all day , they agreed to put the bolster between them at night . "

But mind me , lads , if ever you make the parish regret the loss of the stocks , and the overseers come to me with long faces , and say , ' The stocks must be rebuilded , ' why - "

103613	103624	103626	103627	my father	1479	" It was no bad idea of yours , Pisistratus , "
103631	103658	103626	103627	my father	1479	" to depict the heightened affections and the serious intention of Signor Riccabocca by a single stroke , - He left of his spectacles ! Good . "
103659	103662	103664	103665	my uncle	1493	" Yet , "
103667	103721	103664	103665	my uncle	1493	" I think Shakspeare represents a lover as falling into slovenly habits , neglecting his person , and suffering his hose to be ungartered , rather than paying that attention to his outer man which induces Signor Riccabocca to leave off his spectacles , and look as handsome as nature will permit him . "
103722	103734	103736	103737	my father	1479	" There are different degrees and many phases of the passion , "
103739	103804	103736	103737	my father	1479	" Shakspeare is speaking of an ill - treated , pining , woe - begone lover , much aggrieved by the cruelty of his mistress , - a lover who has found it of no avail to smarten himself up , and has fallen despondently into the opposite extreme . Whereas Signor Riccabocca has nothing to complain of in the barbarity of Miss Jemima . "
103805	103811	103813	103813	Blanche	411	" Indeed he has not ! "

103843	103867	103876	103876	she	1473	" I am decidedly of opinion that , in that respect , Pisistratus has lowered the dignity of the sex . Not intentionally , "
103883	103897	103876	103876	she	1473	" but it is very hard for a man to describe us women . "
103917	103921	103923	103923	he	1479	" To continue , "
103925	104006	103923	103923	he	1479	" Riccabocca has no reason to despair of success in his suit , nor any object in moving his mistress to compassion . He may , therefore , very properly tie up his garters and leave off his spectacles . What do you say , Mr. Squills ? - for , after all , since love - making can not fail to be a great constitutional derangement , the experience of a medical man must be the best to consult . "
104007	104011	104013	104013	Squills	412	" Mr. Caxton , "
104018	104162	104013	104013	Squills	412	" you are quite right : when a man makes love , the organs of self - esteem and desire of applause are greatly stimulated , and therefore , of course , he sets himself off to the best advantage . It is only , as you observe , when , like Shakspeare 's lover , he has given up making love as a bad job , and has received that severe hit on the ganglions which the cruelty of a mistress inflicts , that he neglects his personal appearance : he neglects it , not because he is in love , but because his nervous system is depressed . That was the cause , if you remember , with poor Major Prim . He wore his wig all awry when Susan Smart jilted him ; but I set it right for him . "
104163	104178	104180	104181	my uncle	1493	" By shaming Miss Smart into repentance , or getting him a new sweetheart ? "
104183	104186	104188	104188	Squills	412	" Pooh ! "
104190	104197	104188	104188	Squills	412	" by quinine and cold bathing . "
104198	104204	104206	104207	my father	1479	" We may therefore grant , "
104209	104384	104386	104387	my father	1479	" that , as a general rule , the process of courtship tends to the spruceness , and even foppery , of the individual engaged in the experiment , as Voltaire has very prettily proved somewhere . Nay , the Mexicans , indeed , were of opinion that the lady at least ought to continue those cares of her person even after marriage . There is extant , in Sahagun 's ' History of New Spain , ' the advice of an Aztec or Mexican mother to her daughter , in which she says , ' That your husband may not take you in dislike , adorn yourself , wash yourself , and let your garments be clean . ' It is true that the good lady adds , ' Do it in moderation ; since if every day you are washing yourself and your clothes , the world will say that you are over - delicate ; and particular people will call you - TAPETZON TINEMAXOCH ! ' What those words precisely mean , "
104391	104421	104386	104387	my father	1479	" I can not say , since I never had the opportunity to acquire the ancient Aztec language , - but something very opprobrious and horrible , no doubt . "
104422	104432	104434	104435	my uncle	1493	" I dare say a philosopher like Signor Riccabocca , "
104437	104471	104434	104435	my uncle	1493	" was not himself very tapetzon tine - what d ' ye call it ? - and a good healthy English wife , that poor affectionate Jemima , was thrown away upon him . "
104472	104475	104477	104478	my father	1479	" Roland , "
104480	104535	104477	104478	my father	1479	" you do n't like foreigners ; a respectable prejudice , and quite natural in a man who has been trying his best to hew them in pieces and blow them up into splinters . But you do n't like philosophers either , - and for that dislike you have no equally good reason . "
104536	104551	104553	104554	my uncle	1493	" I only implied that they are not much addicted to soap and water , "
104556	104665	104434	104435	my uncle	1493	" A notable mistake . Many great philosophers have been very great beaux . Aristotle was a notorious fop . Buffon put on his best laced ruffles when he sat down to write , which implies that he washed his hands first . Pythagoras insists greatly on the holiness of frequent ablutions ; and Horace - who , in his own way , was as good a philosopher as any the Romans produced - takes care to let us know what a neat , well - dressed , dapper little gentleman he was . But I do n't think you ever read the ' Apology ' of Apuleius ? "
104666	104675	104677	104678	the captain	2114	" Not I ; what is it about ? "
104680	104888	104889	104889	My	0	" About a great many things . It is that Sage 's vindication from several malignant charges , - amongst others , and principally indeed , that of being much too refined and effeminate for a philosopher . Nothing can exceed the rhetorical skill with which he excuses himself for using - tooth - powder . ' Ought a philosopher , ' he exclaims , ' to allow anything unclean about him , especially in the mouth , - the mouth , which is the vestibule of the soul , the gate of discourse , the portico of thought ! Ah , but AEmilianus the accuser of Apuleius never opens his mouth but for slander and calumny , - tooth - powder would indeed be unbecoming to him ! Or , if he use any , it will not be my good Arabian tooth powder , but charcoal and cinders . Ay , his teeth should be as foul as his language ! And yet even the crocodile likes to have his teeth cleaned ; insects get into them , and , horrible reptile though he be , he opens his jaws inoffensively to a faithful dentistical bird , who volunteers his beak for a toothpick .

104913	104917	104918	104918	he	1479	" And observe , "
104922	105153	104918	104918	he	1479	" observe with what gravity this eminent Platonist pleads guilty to the charge of having a mirror . ' Why , what , ' he exclaims , ' more worthy of the regards of a human creature than his own image ' nihil respectabilius homini quam formam suam ! Is not that one of our children the most dear to us who is called ' the picture of his father ' ? But take what pains you will with a picture , it can never be so like you as the face in your mirror ! Think it discreditable to look with proper attention on one 's self in the glass ! Did not Socrates recommend such attention to his disciples , - did he not make a great moral agent of the speculum ? The handsome , in admiring their beauty therein , were admonished that handsome is who handsome does ; and the more the ugly stared at themselves , the more they became naturally anxious to hide the disgrace of their features in the loveliness of their merits . Was not Demosthenes always at his speculum ? Did he not rehearse his causes before it as before a master in the art ? He learned his eloquence from Plato , his dialectics from Eubulides ; but as for his delivery - there , he came to the mirror !
105154	105157	105159	105160	Mr. Caxton	409	" Therefore , "
105169	105222	105159	105160	Mr. Caxton	409	" therefore , it is no reason to suppose that Dr. Riccabocca is averse to cleanliness and decent care of the person because he is a philosopher ; and , all things considered , he never showed himself more a philosopher than when he left off his spectacles and looked his best . "
105223	105226	105228	105229	my mother	1473	" Well , "
105233	105262	105228	105229	my mother	1473	" I only hope it may turn out happily . But I should have been better pleased if Pisistratus had not made Dr. Riccabocca so reluctant a wooer . "
105263	105267	105269	105270	the captain	2114	" Very true , "
105272	105298	105269	105270	the captain	2114	" the Italian does not shine as a lover . Throw a little more fire into him , Pisistratus , - something gallant and chivalrous . "
105299	105306	105308	105309	my father	1479	" Fire ! gallantry ! chivalry ! "
105320	105486	105308	105309	my father	1479	" why , do n't you see that the man is described as a philosopher ? - and I should like to know when a philosopher ever plunged into matrimony without considerable misgivings and cold shivers ! Indeed , it seems that - perhaps before he was a philosopher - Riccabocca had tried the experiment , and knew what it was . Why , even that plain - speaking , sensible , practical man , Metellus Numidicus , who was not even a philosopher , but only a Roman censor , thus expressed himself in an exhortation to the people to perpetrate matrimony : ' If , O Quirites , we could do without wives , we should all dispense with that subject of care ea molestia careremus ; but since nature has so managed it that we can not live with women comfortably , nor without them at all , let us rather provide for the human race than our own temporary felicity . ' "
105539	105546	105548	105548	he	1479	" Do not think , ladies , "
105550	105828	105548	105548	he	1479	" that you were without advocates at that day : there were many Romans gallant enough to blame the censor for a mode of expressing himself which they held to be equally impolite and injudicious . ' Surely , ' said they , with some plausibility , if Numidicus wished men to marry , he need not have referred so peremptorily to the disquietudes of the connection , and thus have made them more inclined to turn away from matrimony than give them a relish for it . ' But against these critics one honest man whose name of Titus Castricius should not be forgotten by posterity maintained that Metellus Numidicus could not have spoken more properly ; ' For remark , ' said he , ' that Metellus was a censor , not a rhetorician . It becomes rhetoricians to adorn and disguise and make the best of things ; but Metellus , sanctus vir , - a holy and blameless man , grave and sincere to wit , and addressing the Roman people in the solemn capacity of Censor , - was bound to speak the plain truth , especially as he was treating of a subject on which the observation of every day , and the experience of every life , could not leave the least doubt upon the mind of his audience . ' Still , Riccabocca , having decided to marry , has no doubt prepared himself to bear all the concomitant evils - as becomes a professed sage ; and I own I admire the art with which Pisistratus has drawn the kind of woman most likely to suit a philosopher - "
105856	105905	105848	105850	MR . CAXTON	409	" Not only as regards mildness of temper and other household qualifications , but as regards the very person of the object of his choice . For you evidently remember , Pisistratus , the reply of Bias , when asked his opinion on marriage : Long sentence in Greek "
105930	106217	105925	105927	MR . CAXTON	409	" That is , my dears , ' The woman you would marry is either handsome or ugly : if handsome , she is koine , - namely , you do n't have her to yourself ; if ugly , she is poine , - that is , a fury . ' But , as it is observed in Aulus Gellius whence I borrow this citation , there is a wide interval between handsome and ugly . And thus Ennius , in his tragedy of ' Menalippus , ' uses an admirable expression to designate women of the proper degree of matrimonial comeliness , such as a philosopher would select . He calls this degree stata forma , - a rational , mediocre sort of beauty , which is not liable to be either koine or poine . And Favorinus , who was a remarkably sensible man , and came from Provence - the male inhabitants of which district have always valued themselves on their knowledge of love and ladies - calls this said stata forma the beauty of wives , - the uxorial beauty . Ennius says that women of a stata forma are almost always safe and modest . Now , Jemima , you observe , is described as possessing this stata forma ; and it is the nicety of your observation in this respect , which I like the most in the whole of your description of a philosopher 's matrimonial courtship , Pisistratus excepting only the stroke of the spectacles , for it shows that you had properly considered the opinion of Bias , and mastered all the counter logic suggested in Book v. , chapter xi . , of Aulus Gellius .

I have shared in such an attempt . And , "
114045	114158	114040	114041	the Italian	743	" recalling now all the evil passions it arouses , all the ties it dissolves , all the blood that it commands to flow , all the healthful industry it arrests , all the madmen that it arms , all the victims that it dupes , I question whether one man really honest , pure , and humane , who has once gone through such an ordeal , would ever hazard it again , unless he was assured that the victory was certain , - ay , and the object for which he fights not to be wrested from his hands amidst the uproar of the elements that the battle has released . "
114187	114472	114183	114183	he	1688	" Revolutions that have no definite objects made clear by the positive experience of history ; revolutions , in a word , that aim less at substituting one law or one dynasty for another , than at changing the whole scheme of society , have been little attempted by real statesmen . Even Lycurgus is proved to be a myth who never existed . Such organic changes are but in the day - dreams of philosophers who lived apart from the actual world , and whose opinions though generally they were very benevolent , good sort of men , and wrote in an elegant poetical style one would no more take on a plain matter of life , than one would look upon Virgil 's Eclogues as a faithful picture of the ordinary pains and pleasures of the peasants who tend our sheep . Read them as you would read poets , and they are delightful . But attempt to shape the world according to the poetry , and fit yourself for a madhouse . The farther off the age is from the realization of such projects , the more these poor philosophers have indulged them . Thus , it was amidst the saddest corruption of court manners that it became the fashion in Paris to sit for one 's picture with a crook in one 's hand , as Alexis or Daphne . Just as liberty was fast dying out of Greece , and the successors of Alexander were founding their monarchies , and Rome was growing up to crush in its iron grasp all States save its own , Plato withdraws his eyes from the world , to open them in his dreamy "

Very pretty reading all this to a man like me , Lenny , who can admire and smile at it . But to you , to the man who has to work for his living , to the man who thinks it would be so much more pleasant to live at his ease in a phalanstere than to work eight or ten hours a day ; to the man of talent and action and industry , whose future is invested in that tranquillity and order of a State in which talent and action and industry are a certain capital , - why , Messrs. Coutts , the great bankers , had better encourage a theory to upset the system of banking ! Whatever disturbs society , yea , even by a causeless panic , much more by an actual struggle , falls first upon the market of labour , and thence affects prejudicially every department of intelligence . In such times the arts are arrested ; literature is neglected ; people are too busy to read anything save appeals to their passions . And capital , shaken in its sense of security , no longer ventures boldly through the land , calling forth all the energies of toil and enterprise , and extending to every workman his reward . Now , Lenny , take this piece of advice . You are young , clever , and aspiring : men rarely succeed in changing the world ; but a man seldom fails of success if he lets the world alone , and resolves to make the best of it . You are in the midst of the great crisis of your life ; it is the struggle between the new desires knowledge excites , and that sense of poverty which those desires convert either into hope and emulation , or into envy and despair . I grant that it is an up - hill work that lies before you ; but do n't you think it is always easier to climb a mountain than it is to level it ? These books call on you to level the mountain ; and that mountain is the property of other people , subdivided amongst a great many proprietors , and protected by law . At the first stroke of the pickaxe , it is ten to one but what you are taken up for a trespass . But the path up the mountain is a right of way uncontested . You may be safe at the summit , before even if the owners are fools enough to let you you could have levelled a yard . Cospetto ! "

116344	116381	116336	116336	her	452	" you 'll just never talk to me about her ; I ca n't bear it , it breaks my heart . I can bear better to talk of Mark ; come downstairs , - come . "
116382	116396	116336	116336	her	452	" May I not keep these verses , Mother ? Do let me . "
116397	116434	116336	116336	her	452	" Well , well , those bits o ' paper be all she left behind her , - yes , keep them , but put back Mark 's . Are they all here , - sure ? "
116489	116492	116494	116494	Leonard	450	" But , "
116511	116524	116494	116494	Leonard	450	" but you called her Nora - I see she signs herself L. "
116525	116549	116494	116494	Leonard	450	" Leonora was her name . I said she was my Lady 's god - child . We call her Nora for short - "
116550	116567	116494	116494	Leonard	450	" Leonora - and I am Leonard - is that how I came by the name ? "
116568	116580	116494	116494	Leonard	450	" Yes , yes ; do hold your tongue , boy , "
117049	117054	117046	117046	him	450	" the numbers came . "
117693	117700	117689	117691	this mysterious kinswoman	5127	" a voice , and nothing more "
118296	118306	118322	118322	he	446	" Oi , oi ; give her her head . "
118307	118313	118315	118316	Mr. Dale	446	" Give her her head ! "
118347	118353	118322	118322	he	446	" give her her head ! "
118354	118380	118322	118322	he	446	" Oi , oi ; and do n't jerk her up like that , or she 'll fall a doincing on her hind - legs . "
118407	118412	118413	118413	he	1499	" more last words , "
118703	118709	118656	118656	he	1688	" - looked askance at Riccabocca .
118710	118717	118719	118720	the parson	1499	" Do n't stir , please , "
118722	118747	118719	118720	the parson	1499	" or I fear you 'll alarm the creature ; it seems a nervous , timid thing ; - soho , gently , gently . "
118836	118844	118808	118808	she	470	" I wish you would get off , "
118851	118854	118856	118856	Riccabocca	463	" Well , "
118908	118908	118914	118915	the parson	1499	"
118909	118912	118914	118915	the parson	1499	" Tut , "
118938	118983	118914	118915	the parson	1499	" it is true that I have not ridden much of late years , and the squire 's horses are very high - fed and spirited ; but there is no more harm in them than their master when one once knows their ways . "
118984	119000	118914	118915	the parson	1499	" ' Chi va piano va sano , E chi va sano va lontano , ' "
119011	119035	119002	119002	Riccabocca	463	" You go slowly , therefore safely ; and he who goes safely may go far . You seem prepared for a journey ? "
119036	119040	119042	119043	the parson	1499	" I am , "
119045	119056	119042	119043	the parson	1499	" and on a matter that concerns you a little . "
119057	119060	119062	119062	Riccabocca	463	" Me ! "
119065	119069	119062	119062	Riccabocca	463	" concerns me ! "
119070	119092	118914	118915	the parson	1499	" Yes , so far as the chance of depriving you of a servant whom you like and esteem affects you . "
119093	119096	119098	119098	Riccabocca	463	" Oh , "
119100	119127	119098	119098	Riccabocca	463	" I understand : you have hinted to me very often that I or Knowledge , or both together , have unfitted Leonard Fairfield for service . "
119128	119200	118914	118915	the parson	1499	" I did not say that exactly ; I said that you have fitted him for something higher than service . But do not repeat this to him . And I can not yet say more to you , for I am very doubtful as to the success of my mission ; and it will not do to unsettle poor Leonard until we are sure that we can improve his condition . "
119201	119210	119098	119098	Riccabocca	463	" Of that you can never be sure , "
119220	119256	119258	119258	Riccabocca	463	" and I ca n't say that I am unselfish enough not to bear you a grudge for seeking to decoy away from me an invaluable servant , - faithful , steady , intelligent , and "
119267	119293	119262	119262	he	463	" exceedingly cheap ! Nevertheless go , and Heaven speed you . I am not an Alexander , to stand between man and the sun . "
119294	119320	119321	119322	The parson	1499	" You are a noble , great - hearted creature , Signor Riccabocca , in spite of your cold - blooded proverbs and villanous books . "
119439	119442	119448	119448	he	445	" Certainly , "
119470	119515	119448	119448	he	445	" certainly it is true ' that the noblest conquest ever made by man was that of the horse : ' a fine creature it is , - a very fine creature , - and uncommonly difficult to sit on , especially without stirrups . "
119656	119669	119640	119640	himself	1499	" It is just , - thou shalt have corn and water ! "
119965	119982	119959	119960	Mr. Dale	446	" Those chairs are very treacherous , sir . I 'm afraid you 'll be down . "
119983	119986	119988	119989	the traveller	5203	" Eh , "
119996	120010	119988	119989	the traveller	5203	" Eh , down ? - oh , you 're satirical , sir . "
120011	120022	120024	120025	the parson	1499	" Satirical , sir ? upon my word , no ! "
120029	120048	120050	120051	the traveller	5203	" I think every freeborn man has a right to sit as he pleases in his own house , "
120056	120081	120050	120051	the traveller	5203	" and an inn is his own house , I guess , so long as he pays his score . Betty , my dear . "
120092	120104	120083	120084	the chambermaid	5212	" I han't Betty , sir ; do you want she ? "
120105	120119	120161	120162	The traveller	5203	" No , Sally ; cold brandy and water - and a biscuit . "
120120	120127	120129	120130	the chambermaid	5212	" I han't Sally , either , "
120212	120223	120225	120226	the traveller	5203	" You 're a clergyman , I reckon , sir , "
120256	120276	120225	120226	the traveller	5203	" No offence , sir , but I am a clergyman , and I 'm not ashamed of it . "
120277	120281	120283	120284	the traveller	5203	" Going far ? "
120289	120293	120286	120286	PARSON	445	" Not very . "
120297	120317	120294	120294	TRAVELLER	831	" In a chaise or fly ? If so , and we are going the same way , halves . "
120321	120324	120318	120318	PARSON	445	" Halves ? "
120328	120341	120325	120325	TRAVELLER	5219	" Yes , I 'll pay half the damage , pikes inclusive . "
120345	120354	120342	120342	PARSON	445	" You are very good , sir . But "
120358	120364	120365	120365	TRAVELLER	5219	" I am on horseback . "
120368	120396	120365	120365	TRAVELLER	5219	" On horseback ! Well , I should not have guessed that ! You do n't look like it . Where did you say you were going ? "
120397	120409	120411	120412	the parson	1499	" I did not say where I was going , sir , "
120433	120441	120417	120417	he	1499	" he did not look like it . "
120442	120445	120447	120448	the traveller	5203	" Close ! "
120452	120460	120447	120448	the traveller	5203	" an old traveller , I reckon . "
120629	120635	120615	120616	Mr. Dale	446	" How 's the leather ? "
120636	120639	120641	120642	the parson	1499	" Leather ! "
120650	120673	120641	120642	the parson	1499	" what does he mean by that ? Leather ! a very vulgar man . But I got rid of him cleverly . "
120758	120766	120750	120750	he	446	" Is my Lord at the Park ? "
120775	120794	120767	120767	LANDLORD	833	" No , sir , his Lordship and my Lady have gone to town to meet Lord L'Estrange ! "
120795	120806	120767	120767	LANDLORD	833	" Lord L'Estrange ! He is in England , then ? "
120807	120814	120816	120817	the landlord	1579	" Why , so I heard , "
120819	120931	120933	120934	the landlord	1579	" but we never see him here now . I remember him a very pretty young man . Every one was fond of him and proud of him . But what pranks be did play when he was a lad ! We hoped he would come in for our boro ' some of these days , but he has taken to foren parts , - more 's the pity . I am a reg'lar Blue , sir , as I ought to be . The Blue candidate always does me the honour to come to the Lansmere Arms . ' T is only the low party puts up with the Boar , "
120943	120953	120933	120934	the landlord	1579	" I hope you like the wine , sir ? "
120954	120962	120767	120767	LANDLORD	833	" Very good , and seems old . "
120963	121036	120933	120934	the landlord	1579	" Bottled these eighteen years , sir . I had in the cask for the great election of Dashmore and Egerton . I have little left of it , and I never give it but to old friends like , - for , I think , Sir , though you be grown stout , and look more grand , I may say that I 've had the pleasure of seeing you before . "
121037	121057	120767	120767	LANDLORD	833	" That 's true , I dare say , though I fear I was never a very good customer . "
121058	121157	120933	120934	the landlord	1579	" Ah , it is Mr. Dale , then ! I thought so when you came into the hall . I hope your lady is quite well , and the squire too ; fine pleasant - spoken gentleman ; no fault of his if Mr. Egerton went wrong . Well , we have never seen him - I mean Mr. Egerton - since that time . I do n't wonder he stays away ; but my Lord 's son , who was brought up here , it an't nat'ral like that he should turn his back on us ! "
121186	121207	121173	121182	the parson , pouring out another glass of the port	5236	" There must be great changes in the parish . Is Mr. Morgan , the medical man , still here ? "
121208	121265	120767	120767	LANDLORD	833	" No , indeed ! he took out his ' ploma after you left , and became a real doctor ; and a pretty practice he had too , when he took , all of a sudden , to some new - fangled way of physicking , - I think they calls it homy - something . "
121266	121269	121173	121182	the parson , pouring out another glass of the port	5236	" Homoeopathy ? "
121270	121301	120767	120767	LANDLORD	833	" That 's it ; something against all reason : and so he lost his practice here and went up to Lunnun . I 've not heard of him since . "
121302	121313	121173	121182	the parson , pouring out another glass of the port	5236	" Do the Avenels still reside in their old house ? "
121314	121368	120767	120767	LANDLORD	833	" Oh , yes ! - and are pretty well off , I hear say . John is always poorly , though he still goes now and then to the Odd Fellows , and takes his glass ; but his wife comes and fetches him away before he can do himself any harm . "
121369	121378	121173	121182	the parson , pouring out another glass of the port	5236	" Mrs. Avenel is the same as ever ? "
121379	121389	121391	121392	the landlord	1579	" She holds her head higher , I think , "
121396	121412	121391	121392	the landlord	1579	" She was always - not exactly proud like , but what I calls Bumptious . "
121413	121421	121423	121424	the parson	1499	" I never heard that word before , "
121433	121462	121428	121428	his	1499	" Bumptious indeed , though I believe it is not in the dictionary , has crept into familiar parlance , especially amongst young folks at school and college . "
121463	121473	121475	121476	the landlord	1579	" Bumptious is bumptious , and gumptious is Bumptious , "
121484	121498	121475	121476	the landlord	1579	" Now the town beadle is bumptious , and Mrs. Avenel is Bumptious . "
121499	121507	121509	121510	Mr. Dale	446	" She is a very respectable woman , "
121515	121540	121475	121476	the landlord	1579	" In course , sir , all gumptious folks are ; they value themselves on their respectability , and looks down on their neighbours . "
121547	121579	121541	121541	PARSON	445	" Gumptious - gumptious . I think I remember the substantive at school , - not that my master taught it to me . ' Gumption ' - it means cleverness . "
121584	121634	121580	121580	LANDLORD	833	" There 's gumption and Bumptious ! Gumption is knowing ; but when I say that sum ' un is gumptious , I mean - though that 's more vulgar like - sum ' un who does not think small beer of hisself . You take me , sir ? "
121635	121641	121643	121644	the parson	1499	" I think I do , "
121649	121680	121643	121644	the parson	1499	" I believe the Avenels have only two of their children alive still , - their daughter who married Mark Fairfield , and a son who went off to America ? "
121681	121695	121580	121580	LANDLORD	833	" Ah , but he made his fortune there and has come back . "
121696	121713	121643	121644	the parson	1499	" Indeed ! I 'm very glad to hear it . He has settled at Lansmere ? "
121714	121777	121580	121580	LANDLORD	833	" No , Sir . I hear as he 's bought a property a long way off . But he comes to see his parents pretty often - so John tells me - but I ca n't say that I ever see him . I fancy Dick does n't like to be seen by folks who remember him playing in the kennel . "
121778	121782	121784	121785	the parson	1499	" Not unnatural , "
121789	121807	121784	121785	the parson	1499	" but he visits his parents ; he is a good son at all events , then ? "
121808	121878	121580	121580	LANDLORD	833	" I 've nothing to say against him . Dick was a wild chap before he took himself off . I never thought he would make his fortune ; but the Avenels are a clever set . Do you remember poor Nora - the Rose of Lansmere , as they called her ? Ah , no , I think she went up to Lunnun afore your time , sir . "
121879	121882	121884	121885	the parson	1499	" Humph ! "
121889	121917	121884	121885	the parson	1499	" Well , I think you may take away now . It will be dark soon , and I 'll just stroll out and look about me . "
121918	121928	121580	121580	LANDLORD	833	" There 's a nice tart coming , sir . "
121929	121937	121884	121885	the parson	1499	" Thank you , I 've dined . "
122299	122326	122273	122284	A very prim , neat , middle - aged maid - servant	5268	" I want to see Mr. or Mrs. Avenel . Say that I have come many miles to see them ; and take in this card . "
122350	122363	122327	122330	The maid - servant	5270	" Missis says it 's late , sir ; but walk in . "
122453	122475	122405	122406	Mrs. Avenel	838	" You do the like of us great honour , Mr. Dale ; take a chair . You call upon business ? "
122476	122486	122405	122406	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Of which I apprised Mr. Avenel by letter . "
122487	122494	122405	122406	Mrs. Avenel	838	" My husband is very poorly . "
122495	122500	122502	122502	John	520	" A poor creature ! "
122514	122538	122502	122502	John	520	" I ca n't get about as I used to do . But it ben't near election time , be it , sir ? "
122539	122544	122546	122547	Mrs. Avenel	838	" No , John , "
122558	122573	122546	122547	Mrs. Avenel	838	" You must lie down a bit , while I talk to the gentleman . "
122574	122582	122585	122585	John	520	" I 'm a real good Blue , "
122587	122598	122606	122606	he	1815	" but I ai n't quite the man I was ; "
122624	122631	122606	122606	he	1815	" Anything to oblige , sir ! "
122680	122686	122688	122689	the parson	1499	" Last scene of all , "
122691	122717	122688	122689	the parson	1499	" and oh , well , turning from the poet , may we cry with the disbelieving philosopher , ' Poor , poor humanity ! ' "
122764	122769	122760	122760	she	838	" Now , sir . "
122771	122776	122760	122760	she	838	" Now , sir , "
122813	122825	122796	122796	He	5283	" Yes , now then , and as friend to friend . "
122872	122985	122868	122868	he	446	" I grieve to think , Mrs. Avenel , that you should have so hardened your heart - yes , you must pardon me , - it is my vocation to speak stern truths . You can not say that I have not kept faith with you , but I must now invite you to remember that I specially reserved to myself the right of exercising a discretion to act as I judged best for the child 's interest on any future occasion ; and it was upon this understanding that you gave me the promise , which you would now evade , of providing for him when he came to manhood . "
122986	123049	122868	122868	he	446	" I say I will provide for him . I say that you may ' prentice him in any distant town , and by and by we will stock a shop for him . What would you have more , sir , from folks like us , who have kept shop ourselves ? It ai n't reasonable what you ask , sir . "
123050	123055	123057	123058	the parson	1499	" My dear friend , "
123060	123130	123057	123058	the parson	1499	" what I ask of you at present is but to see him , to receive him kindly , to listen to his conversation , to judge for yourselves . We can have but a common object , - that your grandson should succeed in life , and do you credit . Now , I doubt very much whether we can effect this by making him a small shopkeeper . "
123131	123151	123153	123154	Mrs. Avenel	838	" And has Jane Fairfield , who married a common carpenter , brought him up to despise small shopkeepers ? "
123158	123222	123288	123289	the parson	1499	" Heaven forbid ! Some of the first men in England have been the sons of small shopkeepers . But is it a crime in them , or in their parents , if their talents have lifted them into such rank or renown as the haughtiest duke might envy ? England were not England if a man must rest where his father began . "
123223	123226	123288	123289	the parson	1499	" Good ! "
123247	123252	123254	123255	Mrs. Avenel	838	" All very fine , "
123259	123279	123254	123255	Mrs. Avenel	838	" But to send a boy like that to the University - where 's the money to come from ? "
123280	123286	123288	123289	the parson	1499	" My dear Mrs. Avenel , "
123293	123336	123288	123289	the parson	1499	" the cost need not be great at a small college at Cambridge ; and if you will pay half the expense , I will pay the other half . I have no children of my own , and can afford it . "
123337	123347	123349	123350	Mrs. Avenel	838	" That 's very handsome in you , sir , "
123360	123370	123349	123350	Mrs. Avenel	838	" But the money is not the only point . "
123371	123376	123378	123379	Mr. Dale	446	" Once at Cambridge , "
123384	123498	123378	123379	Mr. Dale	446	" at Cambridge , where the studies are mathematical , - that is , of a nature for which he has shown so great an aptitude , - and I have no doubt he will distinguish himself ; if he does , he will obtain , on leaving , what is called a fellowship , - that is , a collegiate dignity accompanied by an income on which he could maintain himself until he made his way in life . Come , Mrs. Avenel , you are well off ; you have no relations nearer to you in want of your aid . Your son , I hear , has been very fortunate . "
123499	123502	123505	123506	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Sir , "
123512	123583	123505	123506	Mrs. Avenel	838	" it is not because my son Richard is an honour to us , and is a good son , and has made his fortin , that we are to rob him of what we have to leave , and give it to a boy whom we know nothing about , and who , in spite of what you say , ca n't bring upon us any credit at all . "
123584	123593	123349	123350	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Why ? I do n't see that . "
123594	123597	123599	123600	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Why ! "
123605	123738	123599	123600	Mrs. Avenel	838	" why ! you , know why . No , I do n't want him to rise in life : I do n't want folks to be speiring and asking about him . I think it is a very wicked thing to have put fine notions in his head , and I am sure my daughter Fairfield could not have done it herself . And now , to ask me to rob Richard , and bring out a great boy - who 's been a gardener or ploughman , or suchlike - to disgrace a gentleman who keeps his carriage , as my son Richard does - I would have you to know , sir . No ! I wo n't do it , and there 's an end of the matter . "
123752	123754	123349	123350	Mrs. Avenel	838	" good "
123818	123842	123812	123813	Mr. Dale	446	" No ! that 's not the end of the matter . You say the boy 's a ' cute , clever lad ? "
123843	123851	123853	123854	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Richard , have you been listening ? "
123856	123870	123812	123813	Mr. Dale	446	" Well , I guess , yes , - the last few minutes . "
123871	123878	123812	123813	Mr. Dale	446	" And what have you heard ? "
123879	123928	123812	123813	Mr. Dale	446	" Why , that this reverend gentleman thinks so highly of my sister Fairfield 's boy that he offers to pay half of his keep at college . Sir , I 'm very much obliged to you , and there 's my hand if you 'll take it . "
123953	123956	123958	123959	the latter	1552	" Now , "
123961	123998	123958	123959	the latter	1552	" just put on your hat , sir , and take a stroll with me , and we 'll discuss the thing businesslike . Women do n't understand business : never talk to women on business . "
124037	124053	124029	124030	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Sir , you 'll be on your guard with Richard . Remember your promise . "
124054	124063	124029	124030	Mrs. Avenel	838	" He does not know all , then ? "
124064	124098	124029	124030	Mrs. Avenel	838	" He ? No ! And you see he did not overhear more than what he says . I 'm sure you 're a gentleman , and wo n't go against your word . "
124099	124140	124029	124030	Mrs. Avenel	838	" My word was conditional ; but I will promise you never to break the silence without more reason than I think there is here for it . Indeed , Mr. Richard Avenel seems to save all necessity for that . "
124141	124148	124150	124150	Richard	455	" Are you coming , sir ? "
124186	124191	124193	124194	Mr. Richard	455	" So , then , "
124198	124239	124193	124194	Mr. Richard	455	" poor Jane , who was always the drudge of the family , has contrived to bring up her son well ; and the boy is really what you say , eh , - could make a figure at college ? "
124240	124247	124249	124250	the parson	1499	" I am sure of it , "
124263	124271	124273	124273	Richard	455	" I should like to see him , "
124275	124291	124273	124273	Richard	455	" Has he any manner ? Is he genteel , or a mere country lout ? "
124292	124327	124193	124194	Mr. Richard	455	" Indeed , he speaks with so much propriety , and has so much modest dignity about him , that there 's many a rich gentleman who would be proud of such a son . "
124328	124333	124335	124335	Richard	455	" It is odd , "
124337	124465	124335	124335	Richard	455	" what a difference there is in families . There 's Jane , now , who ca n't read nor write , and was just fit to be a workman 's wife , had not a thought above her station ; and when I think of my poor sister Nora - you would not believe it , sir , but she was the most elegant creature in the world , - yes , even as a child she was but a child when I went off to America . And often , as I was getting on in life , often I used to say to myself , ' My little Nora shall be a lady after all . ' Poor thing - but she died young . "
124491	124527	124472	124473	The parson	1499	" Nothing refines us like education , sir . I believe your sister Nora had received much instruction , and had the talents to profit by it : it is the same with your nephew . "
124528	124534	124536	124536	Richard	455	" I 'll see him , "
124546	124576	124536	124536	Richard	455	" and if I like him , I 'll be as good as a father to him . Look you , Mr. - what 's your name , sir ? "
124577	124580	124472	124473	The parson	1499	" Dale . "
124581	124805	124536	124536	Richard	455	" Mr. Dale , look you , I 'm a single man . Perhaps I may marry some day ; perhaps I sha ' n't . I 'm not going to throw myself away . If I can get a lady of quality , why - but that 's neither here nor there ; meanwhile I should be glad of a nephew whom I need not be ashamed of . You see , sir , I am a new man , the builder of my own fortunes ; and though I have picked up a little education - I do n't well know how , - as I scramble on still , now I come back to the old country , I 'm well aware that I ' m not exactly a match for those d - -d aristocrats ; do n't show so well in a drawing - room as I could wish . I could be a parliament man if I liked , but I might make a goose of myself ; so , all things considered , if I can get a sort of junior partner to do the polite work , and show off the goods , I think the house of Avenel Co. might become a pretty considerable honour to the Britishers . You understand me , sir ? "
124806	124812	124814	124815	Mr. Dale	446	" Oh , very well , "
124823	124826	124828	124830	the New Man	5303	" Now , "
124832	125044	124828	124830	the New Man	5303	" I 'm not ashamed to have risen in life by my own merits ; and I do n't disguise what I 've been . And , when I 'm in my own grand house , I 'm fond of saying , ' I landed at New York with L10 in my purse , and here I am ! ' But it would not do to have the old folks with me . People take you with all your faults if you 're rich ; but they wo n't swallow your family into the bargain . So if I do n't have at my house my own father and mother , whom I love dearly , and should like to see sitting at table , with my servants behind their chairs , I could still less have sister Jane . I recollect her very well , but she ca n't have got genteeler as she 's grown older . Therefore I beg you 'll not set her on coming after me ! it would not do by any manner of means . Do n't say a word about me to her . But send the boy down here to his grandfather , and I 'll see him quietly , you understand . "
125045	125060	124536	124536	Richard	455	" Yes , but it will be hard to separate her from the boy . "
125061	125455	124828	124830	the New Man	5303	" Stuff ! all boys are separated from their parents when they go into the world . So that 's settled . Now , just tell me . I know the old folks always snubbed Jane , - that is , Mother did . My poor dear father never snubbed any of us . Perhaps Mother has not behaved altogether well to Jane . But we must not blame her for that ; you see this is how it happened . There were a good many of us , while Father and Mother kept shop in the High Street , so we were all to be provided for anyhow ; and Jane , being very useful and handy at work , got a place when she was a little girl , and had no time for learning . Afterwards my father made a lucky hit , in getting my Lord Lansmere 's custom after an election , in which he did a great deal for the Blues for he was a famous electioneerer , my poor father . My Lady stood godmother to Nora ; and then all my brothers , and two of my sisters , died off , and Father retired from business ; and when he took Jane from service , she was so common - like that Mother could not help contrasting her with Nora . You see Jane was their child when they were poor little shop - people , with their heads scarce above water ; and Nora was their child when they were well off , and had retired from trade , and lived genteel : so that makes a great difference . And Mother did not quite look on her as on her own child . But it was Jane 's own fault : for Mother would have made it up with her if she had married the son of our neighbour the great linen - draper , as she might have done ; but she would take Mark Fairfield , a common carpenter . Parents like best those of their children who succeed best in life . Natural . Why , they did not care for me till I came back the man I am . But to return to Jane : I 'm afraid they 've neglected her . How is she off ? "
125456	125469	124536	124536	Richard	455	" She earns her livelihood , and is poor , but contented . "
125470	125481	125483	125483	Richard	455	" Ah , just be good enough to give her this "
125497	125528	124536	124536	Richard	455	" You can say the old folks sent it to her ; or that it is a present from Dick , without telling her he has come back from America . "
125529	125534	125536	125537	the parson	1499	" My dear sir , "
125539	125634	125536	125537	the parson	1499	" I am more and more thankful to have made your acquaintance . This is a very liberal gift of yours ; but your best plan will be to send it through your mother . For , though I do n't want to betray any confidence you place in me , I should not know what to answer if Mrs. Fairfield began to question me about her brother . I never had but one secret to keep , and I hope I shall never have another . A secret is very like a lie ! "
125635	125642	125644	125644	Richard	455	" You had a secret then ? "
125676	125683	125670	125670	He	455	" Pray , what was it ? "
125684	125697	125699	125700	the parson	1499	" Why , what it would not be if I told you , "
125708	125712	125699	125700	the parson	1499	" a secret ! "
125713	125822	125670	125670	He	455	" Well , I guess we 're in a land of liberty . Do as you like . Now , I dare say you think me a very odd fellow to come out of my shell to you in this off - hand way ; but I liked the look of you , even when we were at the inn together . And just now I was uncommonly pleased to find that , though you are a parson , you do n't want to keep a man 's nose down to a shopboard , if he has anything in him . You 're not one of the aristocrats - "
125823	125826	125828	125829	the parson	1499	" Indeed , "
125835	125889	125828	125829	the parson	1499	" it is not the character of the aristocracy of this country to keep people down . They make way amongst themselves for any man , whatever his birth , who has the talent and energy to aspire to their level . That 's the especial boast of the British constitution , sir ! "
125890	125900	125902	125903	Mr. Richard	455	" Oh , you think so , do you ? "
125911	125940	125902	125903	Mr. Richard	455	" I dare say those are the opinions in which you have brought up the lad . Just keep him yourself and let the aristocracy provide for him ! "
126026	126096	126022	126022	he	455	" Indeed , sir , you are mistaken ; I have never attempted to influence your nephew 's political opinions . On the contrary , if , at his age , he can be said to have formed any opinions , I am greatly afraid - that is , I think his opinions are by no means sound - that is , constitutional . I mean , I mean - "
126141	126290	126122	126123	Mr. Avenel	455	" Well , I calculate he 's a Radical . Natural enough , if he has not got a sixpence to lose - all come right by and by . I 'm not a Radical , - at least not a Destructive - much too clever a man for that , I hope . But I wish to see things very different from what they are . Do n't fancy that I want the common people , who 've got nothing , to pretend to dictate to their betters , because I hate to see a parcel of fellows who are called lords and squires trying to rule the roast . I think , sir , that it is men like me who ought to be at the top of the tree ! and that 's the long and the short of it . What do you say ? "
126291	126299	126301	126303	the crestfallen parson	5313	" I 've not the least objection , "
126609	126613	126603	126605	The neighbouring farmers	5328	" Mr. Fairfield , "
126641	126647	126624	126625	Mr. Stirn	542	" he bore no malice . "
126940	126944	126910	126910	he	1499	" Ave Maria ! "
127094	127099	127101	127102	Mr. Dale	446	" Good - evening , "
127127	127142	127104	127104	Violante	800	" Talk to Papa , do , - and cheerfully ; he is sad . "
127180	127191	127199	127199	he	1499	" How fares it with you , my dear friend ? "
127209	127223	127199	127199	he	1499	" You must not let him get out of spirits , Mrs. Riccabocca . "
127224	127237	127245	127245	his	1688	" I am very ungrateful to her if I ever am so , "
127267	127272	127245	127245	his	1688	" out of spirits , "
127311	127361	127294	127295	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" You see I am so stupid , Mr. Dale ; I never knew I was so stupid till I married . But I am very glad you are come . You can get on some learned subject together , and then he will not miss so much his - "
127362	127366	127368	127368	Riccabocca	742	" His what ? "
127372	127388	127294	127295	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" His country . Do you think that I can not sometimes read your thoughts ? "
127389	127449	127491	127492	the parson	1499	" Very often . But you did not read them just then . The tongue touches where the tooth aches , but the best dentist can not guess at the tooth unless one open one 's mouth . - Basta ! Can we offer you some wine of our own making , Mr. Dale ? - it is pure . "
127450	127458	127460	127461	the parson	1499	" I 'd rather have some tea , "
127502	127530	127491	127492	the parson	1499	" But you are dejected then ? Fie ! If there 's a virtue in the world at which we should always aim , it is cheerfulness . "
127531	127538	127540	127540	Riccabocca	742	" I do n't dispute it , "
127547	127596	127540	127540	Riccabocca	742	" But though it is said by some Greek , who , I think , is quoted by your favourite Seneca , that a wise man carries his country with him at the soles of his feet , he ca n't carry also the sunshine over his head . "
127597	127605	127607	127608	the parson	1499	" I tell you what it is , "
127612	127631	127607	127608	the parson	1499	" you would have a much keener sense of happiness if you had much less esteem for philosophy . "
127632	127635	127637	127638	the doctor	1651	" Cospetto ! "
127643	127650	127637	127638	the doctor	1651	" Just explain , will you ? "
127651	127704	127540	127540	Riccabocca	742	" Does not the search after wisdom induce desires not satisfied in this small circle to which your life is confined ? It is not so much your country for which you yearn , as it is for space to your intellect , employment for your thoughts , career for your aspirations . "
127705	127715	127717	127717	Riccabocca	742	" You have guessed at the tooth which aches , "
127722	127728	127730	127731	the parson	1499	" Easy to do that , "
127733	127775	127730	127731	the parson	1499	" Our wisdom teeth come last and give us the most pain ; and if you would just starve the mind a little , and nourish the heart more , you would be less of a philosopher and more of a - "
127781	127783	127788	127788	his	1499	" Christian "
127813	127821	127791	127791	he	1499	" and more of a happy man ! "
127822	127832	127834	127835	the doctor	1651	" I do all I can with my heart , "
127837	127931	127834	127835	the doctor	1651	" Not you ! For a man with such a heart as yours should never feel the want of the sunshine . My friend , we live in an age of over mental cultivation . We neglect too much the simple healthful outer life , in which there is so much positive joy . In turning to the world within us , we grow blind to this beautiful world without ; in studying ourselves as men , we almost forget to look up to heaven , and warm to the smile of God . "
127972	128009	127967	127967	he	1694	" There is some truth in what you say . I own that we live too much as if we were all brain . Knowledge has its penalties and pains , as well as its prizes . "
128010	128023	127967	127967	he	1694	" That is just what I want you to say to Leonard . "
128024	128035	127967	127967	he	1694	" How have you settled the object of your journey ? "
128036	128062	127967	127967	he	1694	" I will tell you as we walk down to him after tea . At present , I am rather too much occupied with you . "
128063	128079	127967	127967	he	1694	" Me ? The tree is formed - try only to bend the young twig ! "
128080	128089	128091	128092	the parson	1499	" Trees are trees , and twigs twigs , "
128096	128127	128091	128092	the parson	1499	" but man is always growing till he falls into the grave . I think I have heard you say that you once had a narrow escape of a prison ? "
128128	128132	127967	127967	he	1694	" Very narrow . "
128133	128272	128091	128092	the parson	1499	" Just suppose that you were now in that prison , and that a fairy conjured up the prospect of this quiet home in a safe land ; that you saw the orange - trees in flower , felt the evening breeze on your cheek ; beheld your child gay or sad , as you smiled or knit your brow ; that within this phantom home was a woman , not , indeed , all your young romance might have dreamed of , but faithful and true , every beat of her heart all your own , - would you not cry from the depth of your dungeon , ' O fairy ! such a change were a paradise ! ' Ungrateful man ! you want interchange for your mind , and your heart should suffice for all ! "
128279	128286	128288	128289	Mr. Dale	446	" Come hither , my child , "
128312	128316	128317	128317	he	446	" Come hither , "
128337	128410	128324	128324	Violante	800	" Tell me , Violante , when you are alone in the fields or the garden , and have left your father looking pleased and serene , so that you have no care for him at your heart , - tell me , Violante , though you are all alone , with the flowers below , and the birds singing overhead , do you feel that life itself is happiness or sorrow ? "
128411	128414	128416	128416	Violante	800	" Happiness ! "
128429	128440	128324	128324	Violante	800	" Can you explain what kind of happiness it is ? "
128441	128484	128324	128324	Violante	800	" Oh , no , impossible ! and it is never the same . Sometimes it is so still - so still , and sometimes so joyous , that I long for wings to fly up to God , and thank Him ! "
128485	128489	128491	128492	the parson	1499	" O friend , "
128494	128563	128491	128492	the parson	1499	" this is the true sympathy between life and nature , and thus we should feel ever , did we take more care to preserve the health and innocence of a child . We are told that we must become as children to enter into the kingdom of Heaven ; methinks we should also become as children to know what delight there is in our heritage of earth ! "
128929	128932	128917	128918	the parson	1499	" Peace , "
128968	128990	128961	128962	Mr. Dale	446	" But we shall be too late for Leonard . Come , naughty little girl , get your father his hat . "
128991	128995	128997	128997	Riccabocca	742	" And umbrella ! "
129008	129014	129016	129017	the parson	1499	" Umbrella against the stars ? "
129021	129030	129032	129032	Riccabocca	742	" The stars are no friends of mine , "
129034	129043	129032	129032	Riccabocca	742	" and one never knows what may happen ! "
129053	129060	129062	129062	Riccabocca	742	" You have done me good , "
129064	129106	129062	129062	Riccabocca	742	" but I hope I am not always so unreasonably melancholic as you seem to suspect . The evenings will sometimes appear long , and dull too , to a man whose thoughts on the past are almost his sole companions . "
129107	129115	129044	129045	The philosopher	1694	" Sole companions ? - your child ? "
129116	129122	129062	129062	Riccabocca	742	" She is so young . "
129123	129127	129044	129045	The philosopher	1694	" Your wife ? "
129128	129133	129062	129062	Riccabocca	742	" She is so - "
129170	129170	129044	129045	The philosopher	1694	"
129171	129242	129044	129045	The philosopher	1694	" I own nothing of the sort . You have your house and your interests , your happiness and your lives , in common . We men are so exacting , we expect to find ideal nymphs and goddesses when we condescend to marry a mortal ; and if we did , our chickens would be boiled to rags , and our mutton come up as cold as a stone . "
129243	129252	129254	129254	Riccabocca	742	" Per Bacco , you are an oracle , "
129258	129298	129254	129254	Riccabocca	742	" But I am not so sceptical as you are . I honour the fair sex too much . There are a great many women who realize the ideal of men , to be found in - the poets ! "
129299	129307	129309	129310	the parson	1499	" There 's my dear Mrs. Dale , "
129335	129366	129323	129323	his	1499	" there 's my dear Mrs. Dale , the best woman in the world , - an angel I would say , if the word were not profane ; BUT - "
129367	129373	129375	129376	the doctor	1651	" What 's the BUT ? "
129380	129542	129544	129545	the parson	1499	" BUT I too might say that ' she and I have not much in common , ' if I were only to compare mind to mind , and when my poor Carry says something less profound than Madame de Stael might have said , smile on her in contempt from the elevation of logic and Latin . Yet when I remember all the little sorrows and joys that we have shared together , and feel how solitary I should have been without her - oh , then , I am instantly aware that there is between us in common something infinitely closer and better than if the same course of study had given us the same equality of ideas ; and I was forced to brace myself for a combat of intellect , as I am when I fall in with a tiresome sage like yourself . I do n't pretend to say that Mrs. Riccabocca is a Mrs. Dale , "
129552	129591	129544	129545	the parson	1499	" there is but one Mrs. Dale in the world ; but still , you have drawn a prize in the wheel matrimonial ! Think of Socrates , and yet he was content even with his - Xantippe ! "
129600	129604	129597	129598	Mrs. Dale	470	" little tempers , "
129639	129694	129631	129631	he	463	" Socrates was a man beyond all imitation ! - Yet I believe that even he spent very few of his evenings at home . But revenons a nos moutons , we are nearly at Mrs. Fairfield 's cottage , and you have not yet told me what you have settled as to Leonard . "
129746	129756	129758	129759	the parson	1499	" The great thing , in the mean while , "
129761	129777	129758	129759	the parson	1499	" would be to enlighten him a little as to what he calls - enlightenment . "
129778	129781	129783	129783	Riccabocca	463	" Ah ! "
129792	129806	129783	129783	Riccabocca	463	" I shall listen with interest to what you say on that subject . "
129807	129895	129758	129759	the parson	1499	" And must aid me : for the first step in this modern march of enlightenment is to leave the poor parson behind ; and if one calls out ' Hold ! and look at the sign - post , ' the traveller hurries on the faster , saying to himself , ' Pooh , pooh ! - that is only the cry of the parson ! ' But my gentleman , when he doubts me , will listen to you , - you 're a philosopher ! "
129896	129911	129783	129783	Riccabocca	463	" We philosophers are of some use now and then , even to parsons ! "
129912	129934	129936	129937	the parson	1499	" If you were not so conceited a set of deluded poor creatures already , I would say ' Yes , ' "
130272	130283	130285	130286	Mr. Dale	446	" We are come to talk to you , Leonard , "
130288	130298	130285	130286	Mr. Dale	446	" but I fear we shall disturb Mrs. Fairfield . "
130299	130319	130254	130255	the parson	1499	" Oh , no , sir ! the door to the staircase is shut , and she sleeps soundly . "
130320	130336	130338	130338	Riccabocca	463	" Why , this is a French book ! Do you read French , Leonard ? "
130340	130370	130254	130255	the parson	1499	" I have not found French difficult , sir . Once over the grammar , and the language is so clear ; it seems the very language for reasoning . "
130371	130387	130389	130389	Riccabocca	463	" True . Voltaire said justly , ' Whatever is obscure is not French , ' "
130391	130402	130404	130405	the parson	1499	" I wish I could say the same of English , "
130407	130420	130254	130255	the parson	1499	" But what is this , - Latin too ? - Virgil ? "
130421	130445	130447	130447	Leonard	450	" Yes , sir . But I find I make little way there without a master . I fear I must give it up "
130688	130691	130693	130693	Fletcher	854	" Aminta , "
130704	130720	130722	130723	the parson	1499	" You must draw a chair here , and sit down between us , Leonard , "
130725	130730	130732	130732	Riccabocca	463	" If any one , "
130734	130771	130732	130732	Riccabocca	463	" has a right to sit , it is the one who is to hear the sermon ; and if any one ought to stand , it is the one who is about to preach it . "
130772	130780	130782	130783	the parson	1499	" Do n't be frightened , Leonard , "
130787	130798	130800	130800	he	1499	" it is only a criticism , not a sermon ; "
130814	130832	130811	130811	PARSON	445	" You take for your motto this aphorism , ' Knowledge is Power . ' - BACON . "
130836	130859	130833	130833	RICCABOCCA	463	" Bacon make such an aphorism ! The last man in the world to have said anything so pert and so shallow ! "
130864	130907	130860	130860	LEONARD	450	" Do you mean to say , sir , that that aphorism is not in Lord Bacon ? Why , I have seen it quoted as his in almost every newspaper , and in almost every speech in favour of popular education . "
130911	130934	130908	130908	RICCABOCCA	463	" Then that should be a warning to you never again to fall into the error of the would - be scholar , -
131053	131063	131040	131040	he	665	" Adeo signanter Deus opera potentix et sapientive discriminavit . "
131204	131204	131192	131192	Bacon	665	"
131209	131238	131192	131192	Bacon	665	" Well , I supposed it was Lord Bacon 's , and I am very glad to hear that the aphorism has not the sanction of his authority . "
131245	131250	131239	131239	LEONARD	450	" But why so ? "
131254	131272	131251	131251	PARSON	445	" Because it either says a great deal too much , or just - nothing at all . "
131276	131288	131273	131273	LEONARD	450	" At least , sir , it seems to me undeniable . "
131292	131318	131289	131289	PARSON	445	" Well , grant that it is undeniable . Does it prove much in favour of knowledge ? Pray , is not ignorance power too ? "
131322	131339	131319	131319	RICCABOCCA	463	" And a power that has had much the best end of the quarter - staff . "
131343	131359	131340	131340	PARSON	445	" All evil is power , and does its power make it anything the better ? "
131363	131409	131360	131360	RICCABOCCA	463	" Fanaticism is power , - and a power that has often swept away knowledge like a whirlwind . The Mussulman burns the library of a world , and forces the Koran and the sword from the schools of Byzantium to the colleges of Hindostan . "
131421	131465	131410	131410	PARSON	445	" Hunger is power . The barbarians , starved out of their forests by their own swarming population , swept into Italy and annihilated letters . The Romans , however degraded , had more knowledge at least than the Gaul and the Visigoth . "
131473	131505	131466	131466	RICCABOCCA	463	" And even in Greece , when Greek met Greek , the Athenians - our masters in all knowledge - were beat by the Spartans , who held learning in contempt . "
131509	131576	131506	131506	PARSON	445	" Wherefore you see , Leonard , that though knowledge be power , it is only one of the powers of the world ; that there are others as strong , and often much stronger ; and the assertion either means but a barren truism , not worth so frequent a repetition , or it means something that you would find it very difficult to prove . "
131580	131614	131577	131577	LEONARD	450	" One nation may be beaten by another that has more physical strength and more military discipline ; which last , permit me to say , sir , is a species of knowledge - "
131618	131676	131615	131615	RICCABOCCA	463	" Yes ; but your knowledge - mongers at present call upon us to discard military discipline , and the qualities that produce it , from the list of the useful arts . And in your own Essay , you insist upon knowledge as the great disbander of armies , and the foe of all military discipline ! "
131680	131703	131677	131677	PARSON	445	" Let the young man proceed . Nations , you say , may be beaten by other nations less learned and civilized ? "
131707	131734	131704	131704	LEONARD	450	" But knowledge elevates a class . I invite the members of my own humble order to knowledge , because knowledge will lift them into power . "
131738	131749	131735	131735	RICCABOCCA	463	" What do you say to that , Mr. Dale ? "
131753	131815	131750	131750	PARSON	445	" In the first place , is it true that the class which has the most knowledge gets the most power ? I suppose philosophers , like my friend Dr. Riccabocca , think they have the most knowledge . And pray , in what age have philosophers governed the world ? Are they not always grumbling that nobody attends to them ? "
131819	131843	131816	131816	RICCABOCCA	463	" Per Bacco , if people had attended to us , it would have been a droll sort of world by this time ! "
131847	131970	131844	131844	PARSON	445	" Very likely . But , as a general rule , those have the most knowledge who give themselves up to it the most . Let us put out of the question philosophers who are often but ingenious lunatics , and speak only of erudite scholars , men of letters and practical science , professors , tutors , and fellows of colleges . I fancy any member of parliament would tell us that there is no class of men which has less actual influence on public affairs . These scholars have more knowledge than manufacturers and shipowners , squires and farmers ; but do you find that they have more power over the Government and the votes of the House of Parliament ? "
131971	131977	131979	131979	Leonard	450	" They ought to have , "
131981	131985	131987	131988	the parson	1499	" Ought they ? "
131990	132343	131987	131988	the parson	1499	" we 'll consider that later . Meanwhile , you must not escape from your own proposition , which is , that knowledge is power , - not that it ought to be . Now , even granting your corollary , that the power of a class is therefore proportioned to its knowledge , pray , do you suppose that while your order , the operatives , are instructing themselves , all the rest of the community are to be at a standstill ? Diffuse knowledge as you may , you will never produce equality of knowledge . Those who have most leisure , application , and aptitude for learning will still know the most . Nay , by a very natural law , the more general the appetite for knowledge , the more the increased competition will favour those most adapted to excel by circumstance and nature . At this day , there is a vast increase of knowledge spread over all society , compared with that in the Middle Ages ; but is there not a still greater distinction between the highly educated gentleman and the intelligent mechanic , than there was then between the baron who could not sign his name and the churl at the plough ; between the accomplished statesman , versed in all historical lore , and the voter whose politics are formed by his newspaper , than there was between the legislator who passed laws against witches and the burgher who defended his guild from some feudal aggression ; between the enlightened scholar and the dunce of to - day , than there was between the monkish alchemist and the blockhead of yesterday ? Peasant , voter , and dunce of this century are no doubt wiser than the churl , burgher , and blockhead of the twelfth . But the gentleman , statesman , and scholar of the present age are at least quite as favourable a contrast to the alchemist , witch - burner , and baron of old . As the progress of enlightenment has done hitherto , so will it ever do .
132344	132439	132534	132534	LEONARD	450	" Knowledge is like capital : the more there is in a country , the greater the disparities in wealth between one man and another . Therefore , if the working class increase in knowledge , so do the other classes ; and if the working class rise peaceably and legitimately into power , it is not in proportion to their own knowledge alone , but rather according as it seems to the knowledge of the other orders of the community , that such augmentation of proportional power is just and safe and wise . "
132476	132501	132464	132464	he	450	" Then , according to you , the reign of knowledge would be no great advance in the aggregate freedom and welfare of man ? "
132505	132533	132464	132464	he	450	" Let us define . By knowledge , do you mean intellectual cultivation ; by the reign of knowledge , the ascendency of the most cultivated minds ? "
132540	132543	132464	132464	he	450	" Yes . "
132547	132576	132544	132544	RICCABOCCA	463	" Oh , indiscreet young man ! that is an unfortunate concession of yours ; for the ascendency of the most cultivated minds would be a terrible oligarchy ! "
132580	132879	132577	132577	PARSON	445	" Perfectly true ; and we now reply to your assertion that men who , by profession , have most learning , ought to have more influence than squires and merchants , farmers and mechanics . Observe , all the knowledge that we mortals can acquire is not knowledge positive and perfect , but knowledge comparative , and subject to the errors and passions of humanity . And suppose that you could establish , as the sole regulators of affairs , those who had the most mental cultivation , do you think they would not like that power well enough to take all means which their superior intelligence could devise to keep it to themselves ? The experiment was tried of old by the priests of Egypt ; and in the empire of China , at this day , the aristocracy are elected from those who have most distinguished themselves in learned colleges . If I may call myself a member of that body , ' the people , ' I would rather be an Englishman , however much displeased with dull ministers and blundering parliaments , than I would be a Chinese under the rule of the picked sages of the Celestial Empire . Happily , therefore , my dear Leonard , nations are governed by many things besides what is commonly called knowledge ; and the greatest practical ministers , who , like Themistocles , have made small States great , and the most dominant races , who , like the Romans , have stretched their rule from a village half over the universe , have been distinguished by various qualities which a philosopher would sneer at , and a knowledge - monger would call ' sad prejudices ' and ' lamentable errors of reason . ' "
132884	132898	132880	132880	LEONARD	450	" Sir , you make use of knowledge itself to argue against knowledge . "
132902	133148	132899	132899	PARSON	445	" I make use of the little I know to prove the foolishness of idolatry . I do not argue against knowledge ; I argue against knowledge - worship . For here , I see in your Essay , that you are not contented with raising human knowledge into something like divine omnipotence , - you must also confound her with virtue . According to you , it is but to diffuse the intelligence of the few among the many , and all at which we preachers aim is accomplished . Nay , more ; for , whereas we humble preachers have never presumed to say , with the heathen Stoic , that even virtue is sure of happiness below though it be the best road to it , you tell us plainly that this knowledge of yours gives not only the virtue of a saint , but bestows the bliss of a god . Before the steps of your idol , the evils of life disappear . To hear you , one has but ' to know , ' in order to be exempt from the sins and sorrows of the ignorant . Has it ever been so ? Grant that you diffuse amongst the many all the knowledge ever attained by the few . Have the wise few been so unerring and so happy ? You supposed that your motto was accurately cited from Bacon . What was Bacon himself ? The poet tells you
133149	133160	132899	132899	PARSON	445	" ' The wisest , brightest , meanest of mankind ! '
133161	133272	132899	132899	PARSON	445	" Can you hope to bestow upon the vast mass of your order the luminous intelligence of this ' Lord Chancellor of Nature ' ? Grant that you do so , and what guarantee have you for the virtue and the happiness which you assume as the concomitants of the gift ? See Bacon himself : what black ingratitude ! what miserable self - seeking ! what truckling servility ! what abject and pitiful spirit ! So far from intellectual knowledge , in its highest form and type , insuring virtue and bliss , it is by no means uncommon to find great mental cultivation combined with great moral corruption . "
133278	133285	132899	132899	PARSON	445	" Push on , will you ? "
133289	133355	133286	133286	RICCASOCCA	859	" A combination remarkable in eras as in individuals . Petronius shows us a state of morals at which a commonplace devil would blush , in the midst of a society more intellectually cultivated than certainly was that which produced Regulus or the Horatii . And the most learned eras in modern Italy were precisely those which brought the vices into the most ghastly refinement . "
133368	133441	133356	133356	LEONARD	450	" I can not contend with you , who produce against information so slender and crude as mine the stores which have been locked from my reach ; but I feel that there must be another side to this shield , - a shield that you will not even allow to be silver . And , oh , if you thus speak of knowledge , why have you encouraged me to know ? "
133445	133451	133453	133454	the parson	1499	" Ah , my son ! "
133456	133521	133453	133454	the parson	1499	" if I wished to prove the value of religion , would you think I served it much if I took as my motto , ' Religion is power ' ? Would not that be a base and sordid view of its advantages ? And would you not say , He who regards religion as a power intends to abuse it as a priestcraft ? "
133522	133526	133528	133528	Riccabocca	463	" Well put ! "
133530	133546	133548	133548	Leonard	450	" Wait a moment - let me think ! Ah , I see , Sir ! "
133553	133611	133550	133550	PARSON	445	" If the cause be holy , do not weigh it in the scales of the market ; if its objects be peaceful , do not seek to arm it with the weapons of strife ; if it is to be the cement of society , do not vaunt it as the triumph of class against class . "
133616	133641	133612	133612	LEONARD	450	" You correct me nobly , sir . Knowledge is power , but not in the sense in which I have interpreted the saying . "
133645	133724	133642	133642	PARSON	445	" Knowledge is one of the powers in the moral world , but one that , in its immediate result , is not always of the most worldly advantage to the possessor . It is one of the slowest , because one of the most durable , of agencies . It may take a thousand years for a thought to come into power ; and the thinker who originated it might have died in rags or in chains . "
133728	133750	133725	133725	RICCABOCCA	463	" Our Italian proverb saith that ' the teacher is like the candle , which lights others in consuming itself . ' "
133754	133835	133751	133751	PARSON	445	" Therefore he who has the true ambition of knowledge should entertain it for the power of his idea , not for the power it may bestow on himself : it should be lodged in the conscience , and , like the conscience , look for no certain reward on this side the grave . And since knowledge is compatible with good and with evil , would not it be better to say , ' Knowledge is a trust ' ? "
133836	133843	133845	133845	Leonard	450	" You are right , sir , "
133849	133853	133845	133845	Leonard	450	" pray proceed . "
133857	134114	134115	134115	Leonard	450	" You ask me why we encourage you to KNOW . First , because as you say yourself in your Essay knowledge , irrespective of gain , is in itself a delight , and ought to be something far more . Like liberty , like religion , it may be abused ; but I have no more right to say that the poor shall be ignorant than I have to say that the rich only shall be free , and that the clergy alone shall learn the truths of redemption . You truly observe in your treatise that knowledge opens to us other excitements than those of the senses , and another life than that of the moment . The difference between us is this , - that you forget that the same refinement which brings us new pleasures exposes us to new pains ; the horny hand of the peasant feels not the nettles which sting the fine skin of the scholar . You forget also , that whatever widens the sphere of the desires opens to them also new temptations . Vanity , the desire of applause , pride , the sense of superiority , gnawing discontent where that superiority is not recognized , morbid susceptibility , which comes with all new feelings , the underrating of simple pleasures apart from the intellectual , the chase of the imagination , often unduly stimulated , for things unattainable below , - all these are surely amongst the first temptations that beset the entrance into knowledge . "
134123	134126	134128	134129	the parson	1499	" Hence , "
134134	134319	134128	134129	the parson	1499	" hence , so far from considering that we do all that is needful to accomplish ourselves as men , when we cultivate only the intellect , we should remember that we thereby continually increase the range of our desires , and therefore of our temptations ; and we should endeavour , simultaneously , to cultivate both those affections of the heart which prove the ignorant to be God 's children no less than the wise , and those moral qualities which have made men great and good when reading and writing were scarcely known : to wit , - patience and fortitude under poverty and distress ; humility and beneficence amidst grandeur and wealth , and , in counteraction to that egotism which all superiority , mental or worldly , is apt to inspire , Justice , the father of all the more solid virtues , softened by Charity , which is their loving mother . Thus accompanied , knowledge indeed becomes the magnificent crown of humanity , - not the imperious despot , but the checked and tempered sovereign of the soul . "
134348	134441	134443	134444	the sage	3893	" And if , Leonard , you are not satisfied with our parson 's excellent definitions , you have only to read what Lord Bacon himself has said upon the true ends of knowledge to comprehend at once how angry the poor great man , whom Mr. Dale treats so harshly , would have been with those who have stinted his elaborate distinctions and provident cautions into that coxcombical little aphorism , and then misconstrued all he designed to prove in favour of the commandment , and authority of learning . For , "
134459	134537	134443	134444	the sage	3893	" I think it is thus that after saying the greatest error of all is the mistaking or misplacing the end of knowledge , and denouncing the various objects for which it is vulgarly sought , - I think it is thus that Lord Bacon proceeds : ' Knowledge is not a shop for profit or sale , but a rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator , and the relief of men 's estate . ' "
134538	134617	134443	134444	the sage	3893	" But the greatest error of all the rest is the mistaking or misplacing of the last or farthest end of knowledge : for men have entered into a desire of learning and knowledge , sometimes upon a natural curiosity and inquisitive appetite ; sometimes to entertain their minds with variety and delight ; sometimes for ornament and reputation ; and sometimes to enable them to victory of wit and contradiction ; and most times for lucre and profession "
134638	134642	134443	134444	the sage	3893	" Knowledge is power "
134644	134758	134443	134444	the sage	3893	" and seldom sincerely to give a true account of these gifts of reason to the benefit and use of men , as if there were sought in knowledge a couch whereupon to rest a searching and restless spirit ; or a terrace for a wandering and variable mind to walk up and down , with a fair prospect ; or a tower of state for a proud mind to raise itself upon ; or a fort or commanding ground for strife and contention ; or a shop for profit or sale , - and not a rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator , and the relief of men 's estate . "
134770	134837	134764	134766	Book I. PARSON	864	" Are those Lord Bacon 's words ? I am very sorry I spoke so uncharitably of his life . I must examine it again . I may find excuses for it now that I could not when I first formed my judgment . I was then a raw lad at Oxford . But I see , Leonard , there is still something on your mind . "
134841	134887	134838	134838	LEONARD	450	" It is true , sir : I would but ask whether it is not by knowledge that we arrive at the qualities and virtues you so well describe , but which you seem to consider as coming to us through channels apart from knowledge ? "
134891	134959	134888	134888	PARSON	864	" If you mean by the word ' knowledge ' something very different from what you express in your Essay - and which those contending for mental instruction , irrespective of religion and ethics , appear also to convey by the word - you are right ; but , remember , we have already agreed that by the word ' knowledge ' we mean culture purely intellectual . "
134963	134974	134960	134960	LEONARD	450	" That is true , - we so understood it . "
134978	135280	134975	134975	PARSON	15187	" Thus , when this great Lord Bacon erred , you may say that he erred from want of knowledge , - the knowledge which moralists and preachers would convey . But Lord Bacon had read all that moralists and preachers could say on such matters ; and he certainly did not err from want of intellectual cultivation . Let me here , my child , invite you to observe , that He who knew most of our human hearts and our immortal destinies did not insist on this intellectual culture as essential to the virtues that form our well - being here , and conduce to our salvation hereafter . Had it been essential , the All - wise One would not have selected humble fishermen for the teachers of His doctrine , instead of culling His disciples from Roman portico or Athenian academe . And this , which distinguishes so remarkably the Gospel from the ethics of heathen philosophy , wherein knowledge is declared to be necessary to virtue , is a proof how slight was the heathen sage 's insight into the nature of mankind , when compared with the Saviour 's ; for hard indeed would it be to men , whether high or low , rich or poor , if science and learning , or contemplative philosophy , were the sole avenues to peace and redemption ; since , in this state of ordeal requiring active duties , very few in any age , whether they be high or low , rich or poor , ever are or can be devoted to pursuits merely mental . Christ does not represent Heaven as a college for the learned . Therefore the rules of the Celestial Legislator are rendered clear to the simplest understanding as to the deepest . "
135284	135369	135281	135281	RICCABOCCA	463	" And that which Plato and Zeno , Pythagoras and Socrates could not do , was done by men whose ignorance would have been a by - word in the schools of the Greek . The gods of the vulgar were dethroned ; the face of the world was changed ! This thought may make us allow , indeed , that there are agencies more powerful than mere knowledge , and ask , after all , what is the mission which knowledge should achieve ? "
135373	135783	135370	135370	PARSON	864	" The Sacred Book tells us even that ; for after establishing the truth that , for the multitude , knowledge is not essential to happiness and good , it accords still to knowledge its sublime part in the revelation prepared and announced . When an instrument of more than ordinary intelligence was required for a purpose divine ; when the Gospel , recorded by the simple , was to be explained by the acute , enforced by the energetic , carried home to the doubts of the Gentile , the Supreme Will joined to the zeal of the earlier apostles the learning and genius of Saint Paul , - not holier than the others , calling himself the least , yet labouring more abundantly than they all , making himself all things unto all men , so that some might be saved . The ignorant may be saved no less surely than the wise ; but here comes the wise man who helps to save . And how the fulness and animation of this grand Presence , of this indomitable Energy , seem to vivify the toil , and to speed the work ! ' In journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils of mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils amongst false brethren . ' Behold , my son ! does not Heaven here seem to reveal the true type of Knowledge , - a sleepless activity , a pervading agency , a dauntless heroism , an all - supporting faith ? - a power , a power indeed ; a power apart from the aggrandizement of self ; a power that brings to him who owns and transmits it but ' weariness and painfulness ; in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness , ' - but a power distinct from the mere circumstance of the man , rushing from him as rays from the sun ; borne through the air , and clothing it with light , piercing under earth , and calling forth the harvest . Worship not knowledge , worship not the sun , O my child ! Let the sun but proclaim the Creator ; let the knowledge but illumine the worship ! "
136185	136189	136191	136192	the student	5059	" I think , "
136208	136238	136191	136192	the student	5059	" I think it was then , as I stood alone , yet surrounded by worlds so numberless , that I first felt the distinction between mind and soul . "
136239	136243	136248	136248	he	463	" Tell me , "
136255	136287	136248	136248	he	463	" whether you would have given to Frank Hazeldean , on entering life , the same lecture on the limits and ends of knowledge which you have bestowed on Leonard Fairfield ? "
136288	136292	136191	136192	the student	5059	" My friend , "
136304	136333	136191	136192	the student	5059	" I have ridden on horseback , and I know that some horses should be guided by the bridle , and some should be urged by the spur . "
136334	136337	136339	136339	Riccabocca	463	" Cospetto ! "
136341	136389	136339	136339	Riccabocca	463	" you contrive to put every experience of yours to some use , - even your journey on Mr. Hazeldean 's pad . And I now see why , in this little world of a village , you have picked up so general an acquaintance with life . "
136390	136404	136191	136192	the student	5059	" Did you ever read White 's ' Natural History of Selborne ' ? "
136405	136408	136339	136339	Riccabocca	463	" No . "
136409	136461	136191	136192	the student	5059	" Do so , and you will find that you need not go far to learn the habits of birds , and know the difference between a swallow and a swift . Learn the difference in a village , and you know the difference wherever swallows and swifts skim the air . "
136462	136473	136339	136339	Riccabocca	463	" Swallows and swifts ! - true ; but men - "
136474	136496	136191	136192	the student	5059	" Are with us all the year round , - which is more than we can say of swallows and swifts . "
136497	136501	136503	136503	Riccabocca	463	" Mr. Dale , "
136513	136534	136503	136503	Riccabocca	463	" if ever again I find myself in a dilemma , I will come to you instead of to Machiavelli . "
136535	136538	136540	136541	the parson	1499	" Ah ! "
136543	136564	136540	136541	the parson	1499	" if I could but have a calm hour 's talk with you on the errors of the Papal relig - "
136649	136672	136642	136643	Mr. Dale	446	" Your parents are old , your father infirm ; their least wish should be as binding to you as their command , "
136683	136735	136676	136676	her	1592	" God bless them , sir , I was very sinful ' Honour your father and mother . ' I 'm no schollard , but I know the Commandments . Let Lenny go . But he 'll soon forget me , and mayhap he 'll learn to be ashamed of me . "
136736	136743	136749	136749	he	1499	" There I will trust him , "
136798	136813	136776	136778	Mr. Richard Avenel	455	" This is for you , and it contains an inclosure of some value . "
136814	136832	136854	136855	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Will you read it , sir ? As I said before , I 'm no schollard . "
136833	136846	136776	136778	Mr. Richard Avenel	455	" But Leonard is , and he will read it to you . "
136963	136973	136975	136976	the widow	1592	" Dear brother Dick , how good in him ! "
136978	137022	136975	136976	the widow	1592	" When I saw there was money , I thought it must be him . How I should like to see Dick again ! But I s'pose he 's still in Amerikay . Well , well , this will buy clothes for you . "
137023	137042	137063	137063	she	452	" No ; you must keep it all , Mother , and put it in the Savings Bank . "
137043	137054	137056	137057	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" I ' m not quite so silly as that , "
137072	137091	137063	137063	she	452	" It must not stay there when I ' m gone . You may be robbed , Mother . "
137092	137156	137063	137063	she	452	" Dear me , dear me , that 's true . What shall I do with it ? What do I want with it , too ? Dear me ! I wish they had n't sent it . I sha ' n't sleep in peace . You must e'en put it in your own pouch , and button it up tight , boy . "
137284	137294	137427	137428	The girl	5469	" You , Leonard - and you are going ! "
137316	137321	137323	137324	the child	16356	" Do not cry , "
137333	137381	137323	137324	the child	16356	" You are going , but Papa says it would be selfish in us to grieve , for it is for your good ; and we should be glad . But I am selfish , Leonard , and I do grieve . I shall miss you sadly . "
137382	137393	137427	137428	The girl	5469	" You , young lady , - you miss me ? "
137394	137426	137323	137324	the child	16356	" Yes ; but I do not cry , Leonard , for I envy you , and I wish I were a boy : I wish I could do as you . "
137446	137459	137427	137428	The girl	5469	" Do as me , and part from all those you love ! "
137460	137519	137543	137543	Violante	800	" But to serve those you love . One day you will come back to your mother 's cottage , and say , ' I have conquered fortune . ' Oh that I could go forth and return , as you will ! But my father has no country , and his only child is a useless girl . "
137538	137541	137543	137543	Violante	800	" Oh , "
137551	137580	137547	137547	her	800	" what it is to be a man ! A woman sighs , ' I wish , ' but a man should say , ' I will . ' "
137667	137674	137675	137675	he	450	" May I remember these words ! "
137727	137758	137724	137724	she	5469	" And if you do , then , girl and child as I am , I shall think I have aided a brave heart in the great strife for honour ! "
137952	138092	137938	137938	Riccabocca	463	" It is not much we can do for you , Leonard , and money is the worst gift in the world for a keepsake ; but my wife and I have put our heads together to furnish you with a little outfit . Giacomo , who was in our secret , assures us that the clothes will fit ; and stole , I fancy , a coat of yours , to have the right measure . Put them on when you go to your relations : it is astonishing what a difference it makes in the ideas people form of us , according as our coats are cut one way or another . I should not be presentable in London thus ; and nothing is more true than that a tailor is often the making of a man . "
138093	138104	138106	138107	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" The shirts , too , are very good holland , "
138115	138123	138125	138127	the wise man	3241	" Never mind details , my dear , "
138208	138208	138202	138202	I	0	"
138314	138321	138323	138324	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" It is old - fashioned , "
138326	138351	138323	138324	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" but it goes better than any clock in the county . I really think it will last to the end of the world . "
138352	138356	138358	138359	the doctor	1651	" Carissima mia ! "
138361	138381	138358	138359	the doctor	1651	" I thought I had convinced you that the world is by no means come to its last legs . "
138382	138393	138395	138396	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" Oh , I did not mean anything , Alphonso , "
138400	138420	138422	138423	the doctor	1651	" And that is all we do mean when we talk about that of which we can know nothing , "
138436	138441	138422	138423	the doctor	1651	" old - fashioned , "
138526	138537	138539	138540	the sage	3893	" There is a depth in that boy 's heart , "
138542	138549	138539	138540	the sage	3893	" which might float an argosy . "
138550	138570	138572	138574	good Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" Poor dear boy ! I think we have put everything into the knapsack that he can possibly want , "
138585	138597	138578	138579	THE DOCTOR	1651	" They are strong , but they are not immediately apparent . "
138605	138615	138598	138600	MRS . RICCABOCCA	742	" They are at the bottom of the knapsack . "
138620	138629	138616	138617	THE DOCTOR	1651	" They will stand long wear and tear . "
138635	138649	138630	138632	MRS . RICCABOCCA	5499	" A year , at least , with proper care at the wash . "
138655	138671	138650	138651	THE DOCTOR	1651	" Care at the wash ! What on earth are you talking of , ma'am ? "
138678	138692	138672	138674	MRS . RICCABOCCA	742	" The shirts , to be sure , my love ! And you ? "
138701	138707	138693	138694	THE DOCTOR	1651	" The feelings , ma'am ! "
138721	138739	138715	138715	his	1651	" But you did quite right to think of the shirts : Mr. Dale said very truly - "
138745	138748	138740	138742	MRS . RICCABOCCA	5503	" What ? "
138753	138779	138749	138750	THE DOCTOR	1651	" That there was a great deal in common between us - even when I think of feelings , and you but of - shirts ! "
138800	138804	138792	138793	Mr. Richard	455	" Yankee Doodle . "
138805	138819	138821	138821	Richard	455	" The parson writes word that the lad will come to - day , "
138825	138914	138821	138821	Richard	455	" let me see the letter , - ay , to - day . If he took the coach as far as - - - - , he might walk the rest of the way in two or three hours . He should be pretty nearly here . I have a great mind to go and meet him : it will save his asking questions , and hearing about me . I can clear the town by the back way , and get out at the high road . "
138915	138926	138928	138929	Mrs. Avenel	838	" You 'll not know him from any one else , "
138931	138962	138928	138929	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Well , that is a good one ! Not know an Avenel ! We 've all the same cut of the jib , - have we not , Father ? "
138976	138986	138988	138988	John	873	" We were always a well - favoured fam'ly , "
138993	139034	138991	138991	himself	873	" There was Luke , but he 's gone ; and Harry , but he 's dead too ; and Dick , but he 's in Amerikay - no , he 's here ; and my darling Nora , but - "
139035	139038	139040	139041	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Hush ! "
139043	139048	139040	139041	Mrs. Avenel	838	" hush , John ! "
139066	139073	139075	139075	he	5507	" And Nora 's gone too ! "
139137	139143	139145	139145	he	455	" I ' m going , "
139149	139191	139145	139145	he	455	" Now mind , Mother , not a word about uncle Richard yet ; we must first see how we like each other , and - in a whisper you 'll try and get that into my poor father 's head ? "
139192	139197	139199	139200	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Ay , Richard , "
139365	139375	139377	139378	Richard Avenel	455	" You have been walking far , young man ? "
139380	139398	139443	139443	he	450	" No , sir , not very . That is Lansmere before me , is it not ? "
139399	139413	139443	139443	he	450	" Yes , it is Lansmere ; you stop there , I guess ? "
139447	139470	139443	139443	he	450	" If you know the town , sir , perhaps you will have the goodness to tell me whereabouts Mr. Avenel lives ? "
139471	139493	139443	139443	he	450	" I can put you into a straight cut across the fields , that will bring you just behind the house . "
139494	139510	139443	139443	he	450	" You are very kind , but it will take you out of your way . "
139511	139535	139443	139443	he	450	" No , it is in my way . So you are going to Mr. Avenel 's ? - a good old gentleman . "
139536	139547	139443	139443	he	450	" I 've always heard so ; and Mrs. Avenel - "
139548	139554	139556	139556	Richard	455	" A particular superior woman , "
139558	139573	139556	139556	Richard	455	" Any one else to ask after ? - I know the family well . "
139574	139582	139443	139443	he	450	" No , thank you , sir . "
139583	139602	139556	139556	Richard	455	" They have a son , I believe ; but he 's in America , is he not ? "
139603	139611	139443	139443	he	450	" I believe he is , sir . "
139612	139625	139556	139556	Richard	455	" I see the parson has kept faith with me muttered Richard . "
139626	139636	139638	139638	Leonard	450	" If you can tell me anything about HIM , "
139640	139647	139638	139638	Leonard	450	" I should be very glad . "
139648	139663	139556	139556	Richard	455	" Why so , young man ? Perhaps he is hanged by this time . "
139664	139667	139638	139638	Leonard	450	" Hanged ! "
139668	139679	139556	139556	Richard	455	" He was a sad dog , I am told . "
139680	139689	139691	139691	Leonard	450	" Then you have been told very falsely , "
139695	139736	139556	139556	Richard	455	" A sad wild dog ; his parents were so glad when he cut and run , - went off to the States . They say he made money ; but , if so , he neglected his relations shamefully . "
139737	139740	139742	139742	Leonard	450	" Sir , "
139744	139778	139742	139742	Leonard	450	" you are wholly misinformed . He has been most generous to a relation who had little claim on him : and I never heard his name mentioned but with love and praise . "
139784	139788	139556	139556	Richard	455	" Yankee Doodle , "
139944	139961	139963	139963	he	450	" I should have thought grass - land would have answered better so near a town , "
139965	139971	139973	139973	Richard	455	" No doubt it would , "
139975	140032	139973	139973	Richard	455	" but they are sadly behind - hand in these parts . You see the great park yonder , on the other side of the road ? That would answer better for rye than grass ; but then , what would become of my Lord 's deer ? The aristocracy eat us up , young man . "
140033	140048	140050	140050	Leonard	450	" But the aristocracy did not sow this piece with rye , I suppose ? "
140054	140063	139973	139973	Richard	455	" And what do you conclude from that ? "
140064	140074	140076	140076	Leonard	450	" Let every man look to his own ground , "
140088	140095	140097	140097	Richard	455	" ' Cute lad you are , "
140099	140111	140097	140097	Richard	455	" and we 'll talk more of these matters another time . "
140123	140141	140143	140143	Richard	455	" You can get through the gap in the hedge , by the old pollard - oak , "
140145	140166	140143	140143	Richard	455	" and come round by the front of the house . Why , you 're not afraid , are you ? "
140167	140173	140143	140143	Richard	455	" I am a stranger . "
140174	140190	140143	140143	Richard	455	" Shall I introduce you ? I told you that I knew the old couple . "
140191	140205	140143	140143	Richard	455	" Oh , no , sir ! I would rather meet them alone . "
140206	140238	140143	140143	Richard	455	" Go ; and - wait a bit - hark ye , young man , Mrs. Avenel is a cold - mannered woman ; but do n't be abashed by that . "
140328	140333	140335	140336	Mrs. Avenel	838	" You are welcome ! "
140343	140350	140352	140353	poor John	873	" The gentleman is heartily welcome , "
140355	140364	140366	140367	Mrs. Avenel	838	" It is your grandson , Leonard Fairfield , "
140394	140411	140370	140370	John	874	" Nora 's eyes ! - he has a blink in his eye like Nora 's . "
140428	140435	140436	140436	she	838	" He is a poor creature , "
140441	140456	140436	140436	she	838	" you excite him . Come away , I will show you your room . "
140527	140542	140518	140518	Leonard	874	" I fear that I have put you out sadly , my dear grandmother . "
140581	140589	140576	140576	she	838	" God bless you , my grandson , "
140722	140726	140720	140720	Spenser	875	" Faerie Queene , "
140756	140759	140760	140760	He	874	" Leonora . "
140958	140976	140942	140943	Mrs. Avenel	838	" You must be tired , - you know your own room now . Good - night . "
141022	141027	141011	141013	The old man	5507	" That 's Nora . "
141052	141057	141059	141059	he	455	" Well , Mother ? "
141061	141071	141040	141041	Richard Avenel	455	" Well , Richard , you have seen him ? "
141072	141096	141059	141059	he	455	" And like him . Do you know he has a great look of poor Nora ? - more like her than Jane . "
141097	141130	141040	141041	Richard Avenel	455	" Yes ; he is handsomer than Jane ever was , but more like your father than any one . John was so comely . You take to the boy , then ? "
141131	141198	141059	141059	he	455	" Ay , that I do . Just tell him in the morning that he is to go with a gentleman who will be his friend , and do n't say more . The chaise shall be at the door after breakfast . Let him get into it : I shall wait for him out of the town . What 's the room you gave him ? "
141199	141207	141040	141041	Richard Avenel	455	" The room you would not take . "
141208	141260	141059	141059	he	455	" The room in which Nora slept ? Oh , no ! I could not have slept a wink there . What a charm there was in that girl ! how we all loved her ! But she was too beautiful and good for us , - too good to live ! "
141261	141269	141271	141272	Mrs. Avenel	838	" None of us are too good , "
141278	141302	141271	141272	Mrs. Avenel	838	" and I beg you will not talk in that way . Goodnight , - I must get your poor father to bed . "
141375	141378	141379	141379	he	874	" Ah ! "
141462	141473	141475	141475	she	838	" It is time for you to rise , Leonard , "
141477	141518	141475	141475	she	838	" You will leave us to - day . A gentleman has promised to take charge of you , and do for you more than we can . A chaise will be at the door soon , - make haste . "
141559	141575	141553	141553	pair	5561	" You must not keep the chaise waiting , - the gentleman is very punctual . "
141576	141583	141553	141553	pair	5561	" But he is not come . "
141584	141605	141553	141553	pair	5561	" No ; he has walked on before , and will get in after you are out of the town . "
141606	141622	141553	141553	pair	5561	" What is his name , and why should he care for me , Grandmother ? "
141623	141633	141553	141553	pair	5561	" He will tell you himself . Be quick . "
141634	141649	141553	141553	pair	5561	" But you will bless me again , Grandmother ? I love you already . "
141650	141656	141658	141659	Mrs. Avenel	838	" I do bless you , "
141663	141677	141678	141678	She	838	" Be honest and good , and beware of the first false step . "
141781	141787	141789	141790	my father	1479	" I hope , Pisistratus , "
141792	141802	141789	141790	my father	1479	" that you do not intend to be dull ? "
141803	141831	141789	141790	my father	1479	" Heaven forbid , sir ! What could make you ask such a question ? Intend ! No ! if I am dull it is from innocence . "
141832	141840	141842	141843	my father	1479	" A very long discourse upon knowledge ! "
141845	141855	141842	141843	my father	1479	" very long ! I should cut it out . "
141872	141877	141856	141856	I	0	" Cut it out ! "
141878	141885	141887	141888	my father	1479	" Stops the action , sir ! "
141892	141903	141887	141888	my father	1479	" Action ! But a novel is not a drama . "
141904	141924	141926	141927	Mr. Caxton	409	" No ; it is a great deal longer , - twenty times as long , I dare say , "
141933	141994	141887	141888	my father	1479	" Well , sir , well ! I think my Discourse upon Knowledge has much to do with the subject , is vitally essential to the subject ; does not stop the action , - only explains and elucidates the action . And I am astonished , sir , that you , a scholar , and a cultivator of knowledge - "
141995	142000	142002	142003	my father	1479	" There , there ! "
142007	142057	142002	142003	my father	1479	" I yield , I yield ! What better could I expect when I set up for a critic ? What author ever lived that did not fly into a passion , even with his own father , if his father presumed to say , ' Cut out ' ! "
142063	142089	142058	142060	MRS . CAXTON	440	" My dear Austin , I am sure Pisistratus did not mean to offend you , and I have no doubt he will take your - "
142094	142110	142090	142090	PISISTRATUS	420	" Advice for the future , certainly . I will quicken the action , and - "
142111	142118	142120	142120	Roland	444	" Go on with the Novel , "
142131	142140	142120	142120	Roland	444	" We have lost L200 by our barley ! "
142155	142159	142142	142142	I	0	" Fair Shadowland . "
142163	142191	142120	142120	Roland	444	" HALT , cried a voice ; and not a little surprised was Leonard when the stranger who had accosted him the preceding evening got into the chaise .
142192	142195	142197	142197	Richard	455	" Well , "
142199	142218	142197	142197	Richard	455	" I am not the sort of man you expected , eh ? Take time to recover yourself . "
142709	142717	142719	142719	Richard	455	" Dull stuff ! theory ! claptrap ! "
142729	142736	142722	142722	himself	455	" it ca n't interest you . "
142737	142746	142748	142748	Leonard	874	" All books interest me , I think , "
142750	142770	142748	142748	Leonard	874	" and this especially ; for it relates to the working class , and I am one of them . "
142771	142785	142787	142787	Richard	455	" You were yesterday , but you may n't be to - morrow , "
142800	142915	142917	142917	Richard	455	" You see , my lad , that it is the middle class which ought to govern the country . What the book says about the ignorance of country magistrates is very good ; but the man writes pretty considerable trash when he wants to regulate the number of hours a free - born boy should work at a factory , - only ten hours a day - pooh ! and so lose two hours to the nation ! Labour is wealth ; and if we could get men to work twenty - four hours a day , we should be just twice as rich . If the march of civilization is to proceed , "
142921	142941	142917	142917	Richard	455	" men , and boys too , must not lie a bed doing nothing , all night , sir . "
142949	142981	142917	142917	Richard	455	" We shall get to the twenty - four hours at last ; and , by gad , we must , or we sha'n't flog the Europeans as we do now . "
143051	143062	143064	143064	he	455	" Slow country this in spite of all its brag , "
143067	143119	143064	143064	he	455	" very slow . Time is money - they know that in the States ; for why ? they are all men of business there . Always slow in a country where a parcel of lazy , idle lords and dukes and baronets seem to think ' time is pleasure . ' "
143291	143294	143296	143299	the post - boy	5604	" Hollo ! "
143333	143343	143345	143345	Dick	643	" Hang those brats ! they are actually playing , "
143347	143363	143345	143345	Dick	643	" As I live , the jade has been washing again ! Stop , boy ! "
143443	143454	143456	143456	Dick	643	" Did I tell you , or did I not , "
143458	143478	143456	143456	Dick	643	" that I would not have those horrid , disreputable cubs of yours playing just before my lodge gates ? "
143479	143484	143609	143609	his	874	" Please , sir - "
143485	143527	143456	143456	Dick	643	" Do n't answer me . And did I tell you , or did I not , that the next time I saw you making a drying - ground of my lilacs , you should go out , neck and crop - "
143528	143535	143609	143609	his	874	" Oh , please , sir - "
143536	143563	143565	143565	Richard	455	" You leave my lodge next Saturday ! drive on , boy . The ingratitude and insolence of those common people are disgraceful to human nature , "
143948	143953	143955	143956	the villager	3666	" This IS farming ! "
143958	143966	143968	143968	Richard	455	" Well , I guess it is , "
143977	144010	143968	143968	Richard	455	" You should have seen the land when I bought it . But we new men , as they call us damn their impertinence ! are the new blood of this country . "
144090	144102	144104	144105	Mr. Richard	455	" I almost think they are going to keep me waiting , "
144164	144178	144180	144180	Richard	455	" Where 's George ? Why does he not come to the door ? "
144224	144234	144236	144236	Richard	455	" See to the things , both of you , "
144258	144270	144272	144272	Richard	455	" Handsome elevation - classical , I take it , eh ? "
144277	144285	144272	144272	Richard	455	" But you should see the offices . "
144524	144540	144514	144518	a very pretty single gentleman	5656	" This is your den . And now , can you guess who I am ? "
144541	144553	144555	144555	Leonard	874	" No one but my uncle Richard could be so kind , "
144598	144601	144603	144603	he	455	" Fish ! "
144631	144631	144637	144637	he	455	"
144656	144687	144632	144632	Leonard	874	" I judge you by your heart , sir , and your likeness to my grandfather , - otherwise I should never have presumed to fancy we could be relations . "
144688	144691	144693	144693	Richard	455	" Hum ! "
144695	144731	144693	144693	Richard	455	" You can just wash your hands , and then come down to dinner ; you will hear the gong in ten ininutes . There 's the bell , - ring for what you want . "
144855	144858	144860	144860	he	455	" Jarvis , "
144864	144877	144860	144860	he	455	" Jarvis , put me in mind to have these inexpressibles altered . "
145025	145031	145011	145011	he	455	" lock up his turnip . "
145664	145667	145656	145665	those men whom Richard justly pronounced to be " humbugs	17873	" humbugs , "
145891	145895	145861	145861	he	500	" Sir Richard . "
146191	146204	146181	146183	all these exclusives	5744	" idem nolle idem velle de republica , ea firma amicitia est ; "
146403	146407	146396	146396	he	455	" My Lady ; "
146433	146437	146426	146428	stiff Colonel Pompley	887	" Sir Richard . "
146551	146555	146548	146548	he	455	" new blood ; "
146688	146706	146708	146709	Richard Avenel	455	" There was not a plate - glass window in the town when I came into it , "
146711	146720	146708	146709	Richard Avenel	455	" and now look down the High Street ! "
147159	147171	147155	147157	the solitary spectator	5797	" Follow us , - thou art one of our set . "
147215	147223	147225	147226	the solitary	5801	" By the tomb of my fathers ! "
147230	147255	147225	147226	the solitary	5801	" I know now what a dead man might feel if he came to life again , and took a peep at the living . "
147296	147305	147307	147307	he	5803	" There 's oxygen in the atmosphere now , "
147312	147399	147307	147307	he	5803	" and I can walk without breathing in the gaseous fumes of the multitude . Oh , those chemists - what dolts they are ! They tell us that crowds taint the air , but they never guess why ! Pah , it is not the lungs that poison the element , - it is the reek of bad hearts . When a periwigpated fellow breathes on me , I swallow a mouthful of care . Allons ! my friend Nero ; now for a stroll . "
147451	147457	147459	147459	he	5803	" Half - past eight ! "
147466	147478	147459	147459	he	5803	" one may smoke one 's cigar without shocking the world . "
147518	147532	147534	147534	he	5803	" It is the most barefaced lie in the world , my Nero , "
147540	147747	147534	147534	he	5803	" this boasted liberty of man ! Now , here am I , a free - born Englishman , a citizen of the world , caring - I often say to myself - caring not a jot for Kaiser or Mob ; and yet I no more dare smoke this cigar in the Park at half - past six , when all the world is abroad , than I dare pick my Lord Chancellor 's pocket , or hit the Archbishop of Canterbury a thump on the nose . Yet no law in England forbids me my cigar , Nero ! What is law at half - past eight was not crime at six and a half ! Britannia says , ' Man , thou art free , and she lies like a commonplace woman . O Nero , Nero ! you enviable dog ! you serve but from liking . No thought of the world costs you one wag of the tail . Your big heart and true instinct suffice you for reason and law . You would want nothing to your felicity , if in these moments of ennui you would but smoke a cigar . Try it , Nero ! - try it ! "
147868	147875	147877	147878	the child	16356	" Pray rest here , Papa , "
147958	147969	147939	147939	his	14948	" Forgive me if I intrude on you , sir . "

148100	148107	148108	148108	he	3273	" You need not fear him , "
148137	148146	148118	148119	the girl	5469	" He has fainted ! Father ! Father ! "
148196	148209	148211	148212	the stranger	1691	" This face seems not unfamiliar to me , though sadly changed , "
148240	148251	148237	148237	he	1691	" My child , what is your father 's name ? "
148277	148280	148282	148283	the child	16356	" Digby , "
148337	148368	148319	148320	the last	2085	" Is it possible that I see once more an old brother in arms ? Algernon Digby , I do not forget you ; but it seems England has forgotten . "
148391	148428	148380	148380	he	14948	" My name is Digby , it is true , sir ; but I do not think we have met before . Come , Helen , I am well now , - we will go home . "
148429	148441	148443	148444	the stranger	1691	" Try and play with that great dog , my child , "
148447	148456	148443	148444	the stranger	1691	" I want to talk with your father . "

148492	148508	148489	148490	the stranger	1691	" You were in the same regiment with myself , and my name is L'Estrange . "
148509	148513	148515	148516	the soldier	15059	" My Lord , "
148520	148525	148515	148516	the soldier	15059	" forgive me that - "
148526	148563	148489	148490	the stranger	1691	" I do n't think that it was the fashion to call me ' my lord ' at the mess - table . Come , what has happened to you ? - on half - pay ? "
148571	148583	148585	148586	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Digby , old fellow , can you lend me L100 ? "
148625	148642	148643	148644	Mr. Digby	895	" No ! Well , that 's lucky , for I can lend it to you . "
148665	148753	148649	148650	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Perhaps you do n't know that , besides being heir to a father who is not only very rich , but very liberal , I inherited , on coming of age , from a maternal relation , a fortune so large that it would bore me to death if I were obliged to live up to it . But in the days of our old acquaintance , I fear we were both sad extravagant fellows , and I dare say I borrowed of you pretty freely . "
148754	148762	148853	148853	he	895	" Me ! Oh , Lord L'Estrange ! "
148763	148786	148649	148650	Lord L'Estrange	502	" You have married since then , and reformed , I suppose . Tell me , old friend , all about it . "
148821	148852	148853	148853	he	895	" My Lord , it is idle to talk of me , - useless to help me . I am fast dying . But my child there , my only child "
148864	148938	148853	148853	he	895	" I have relations in a distant county , if I could but get to them ; I think they would , at least , provide for her . This has been for weeks my hope , my dream , my prayer . I can not afford the journey except by your help . I have begged without shame for myself ; shall I be ashamed , then , to beg for her ? "
148939	148942	148944	148944	L'Estrange	502	" Digby , "
148953	149067	148944	148944	L'Estrange	502	" talk neither of dying nor begging . You were nearer death when the balls whistled round you at Waterloo . If soldier meets soldier and says ' Friend , thy purse , ' it is not begging , but brotherhood . Ashamed ! By the soul of Belisarius ! if I needed money , I would stand at a crossing with my Waterloo medal over my breast , and say to each sleek citizen I had helped to save from the sword of the Frenchman , ' It is your shame if I starve . ' Now , lean upon me ; I see you should be at home : which way ? "
149085	149108	148853	148853	he	895	" And when you return from your relations , you will call on me ? What - hesitate ? Come , promise . "
149109	149113	148853	148853	he	895	" I will . "
149114	149119	148853	148853	he	895	" On your honour . "
149120	149129	148853	148853	he	895	" If I live , on my honour . "
149130	149172	148853	148853	he	895	" I am staying at present at Knightsbridge , with my father ; but you will always hear of my address at No . - , Grosvenor Square , Mr. Egerton 's . So you have a long journey before you ? "
149173	149177	148853	148853	he	895	" Very long . "
149178	149211	148853	148853	he	895	" Do not fatigue yourself , - travel slowly . Ho , you foolish child ! I see you are jealous of me . Your father has another arm to spare you . "
149425	149436	149438	149438	L'Estrange	502	" Does the nation take a nap to - night ? "
149440	149468	149438	149438	L'Estrange	502	" Poor old lady ! She hears so much of her affairs , that she may well boast of her constitution : it must be of iron . "
149469	149476	149478	149478	Audley	500	" The House is still sitting , "
149492	149534	149478	149478	Audley	500	" But it is not a Government motion , and the division will be late , so I came home ; and if I had not found you here , I should have gone into the Park to look for you . "
149535	149571	149438	149438	L'Estrange	502	" Yes ; one always knows where to find me at this hour , nine o'clock P.M. , cigar , Hyde Park . There is not a man in England so regular in his habits . "
149601	149613	149615	149615	he	5876	" But it is the strangest whim of yours , Harley , "
149617	149620	149478	149478	Audley	500	" What ? "
149621	149630	149478	149478	Audley	500	" To affect detestation of ground - floors . "
149631	149681	149478	149478	Audley	500	" Affect ! O sophisticated man , of the earth , earthy ! Affect ! - nothing less natural to the human soul than a ground - floor . We are quite far enough from Heaven , mount as many stairs as we will , without grovelling by preference . "
149682	149692	149694	149694	Audley	500	" According to that symbolical view of the case , "
149696	149704	149694	149694	Audley	500	" you should lodge in an attic . "
149705	149725	149478	149478	Audley	500	" So I would , but that I abhor new slippers . As for hairbrushes , I am indifferent . "
149726	149739	149694	149694	Audley	500	" What have slippers and hair - brushes to do with attics ? "
149740	149764	149478	149478	Audley	500	" Try ! Make your bed in an attic , and the next morning you will have neither slippers nor hair - brushes ! "
149765	149774	149694	149694	Audley	500	" What shall I have done with them ? "
149775	149782	149478	149478	Audley	500	" Shied them at the cats ! "
149783	149792	149694	149694	Audley	500	" What odd things you say , Harley ! "
149793	149876	149478	149478	Audley	500	" Odd ! By Apollo and his nine spinsters ! there is no human being who has so little imagination as a distinguished member of parliament . Answer me this , thou solemn Right Honourable , - Hast thou climbed to the heights of august contemplation ? Hast thou gazed on the stars with the rapt eye of song ? Hast thou dreamed of a love known to the angels , or sought to seize in the Infinite the mystery of life ? "
149877	149886	149694	149694	Audley	500	" Not I indeed , my poor Harley . "
149887	149957	149478	149478	Audley	500	" Then no wonder , poor Audley , that you can not conjecture why he who makes his bed in an attic , disturbed by base catterwauls , shies his slippers at cats . Bring a chair into the balcony . Nero spoiled my cigar to - night . I am going to smoke now . You never smoke . You can look on the shrubs in the square . "
150004	150014	149694	149694	Audley	500	" Audley Egerton , I want something from Government . "
150015	150023	149694	149694	Audley	500	" I am delighted to hear it . "
150024	150059	149694	149694	Audley	500	" There was a cornet in my regiment , who would have done better not to have come into it . We were , for the most part of us , puppies and fops . "
150060	150068	149694	149694	Audley	500	" You all fought well , however . "
150069	150360	149694	149694	Audley	500	" Puppies and fops do fight well . Vanity and valour generally go together . CAesar , who scratched his head with due care of his scanty curls , and even in dying thought of the folds in his toga ; Walter Raleigh , who could not walk twenty yards because of the gems in his shoes ; Alcibiades , who lounged into the Agora with doves in his bosom , and an apple in his hand ; Murat , bedizened in gold lace and furs ; and Demetrius , the City - Taker , who made himself up like a French marquise , were all pretty good fellows at fighting . A slovenly hero like Cromwell is a paradox in nature , and a marvel in history . But to return to my cornet . We were rich ; he was poor . When the pot of clay swims down the stream with the brass - pots , it is sure of a smash . Men said Digby was stingy ; I saw he was extravagant . But every one , I fear , would be rather thought stingy than poor . Bref - I left the army , and saw him no more till to - night . There was never shabby poor gentleman on the stage more awfully shabby , more pathetically gentleman . But , look ye , this man has fought for England . It was no child 's play at Waterloo , let me tell you , Mr. Egerton ; and , but for such men , you would be at best a sous prefet , and your parliament a Provincial Assembly . You must do something for Digby . What shall it be ? "
150361	150381	149694	149694	Audley	500	" Why , really , my dear Harley , this man was no great friend of yours , eh ? "
150382	150409	149694	149694	Audley	500	" If he were , he would not want the Government to help him , - he would not be ashamed of taking money from me . "
150410	150464	149694	149694	Audley	500	" That is all very fine , Harley ; but there are so many poor officers , and so little to give . It is the most difficult thing in the world that which you ask me . Indeed , I know nothing can be done : he has his half - pay ? "
150465	150500	149694	149694	Audley	500	" I think not ; or , if he has it , no doubt it all goes on his debts . That 's nothing to us : the man and his child are starving . "
150501	150517	149694	149694	Audley	500	" But if it is his own fault , - if he has been imprudent ? "
150518	150531	149694	149694	Audley	500	" Ah , well , well ; where the devil is Nero ? "
150532	150549	149694	149694	Audley	500	" I am so sorry I ca n't oblige you . If it were anything else - "
150550	150587	149694	149694	Audley	500	" There is something else . My valet - I ca n't turn him adrift - excellent fellow , but gets drunk now and then . Will you find him a place in the Stamp Office ? "
150588	150592	149694	149694	Audley	500	" With pleasure . "
150593	150675	149694	149694	Audley	500	" No , now I think of it , the man knows my ways : I must keep him . But my old wine - merchant - civil man , never dunned - is a bankrupt . I am under great obligations to him , and he has a very pretty daughter . Do you think you could thrust him into some small place in the Colonies , or make him a King 's Messenger , or something of the sort ? "
150676	150689	149694	149694	Audley	500	" If you very much wish it , no doubt I can . "
150690	150712	149694	149694	Audley	500	" My dear Audley , I am but feeling my way : the fact is , I want something for myself . "
150713	150722	150724	150724	Egerton	500	" Ah , that indeed gives me pleasure ! "
150729	150774	149694	149694	Audley	500	" The mission to Florence will soon be vacant , - I know it privately . The place would quite suit me . Pleasant city ; the best figs in Italy ; very little to do . You could sound Lord on the subject . "
150775	150809	150810	150811	Harley L'Estrange	503	" I will answer beforehand . Lord - would be enchanted to secure to the public service a man so accomplished as yourself , and the son of a peer like Lord Lansmere . "
150836	150842	150844	150845	Harley L'Estrange	503	" Infamous and bloodless official ! "
150923	150923	150935	150935	his	5876	"
150924	150927	150929	150932	the member of parliament	5876	" Harley , "
150941	151046	150935	150935	his	5876	" this would be a very good claptrap at a small theatre ; but there is nothing in which parliament demands such rigid economy as the military branch of the public service ; and no man for whom it is so hard to effect what we must plainly call a job as a subaltern officer who has done nothing more than his duty , - and all military men do that . Still , as you take it so earnestly , I will use what interest I can at the War Office , and get him , perhaps , the mastership of a barrack . "
151047	151086	151159	151160	Lord L'Estrange	502	" You had better ; for , if you do not , I swear I will turn Radical , and come down to your own city to oppose you , with Hunt and Cobbett to canvass for me . "
151087	151110	151112	151112	Audley	500	" I should be very glad to see you come into parliament , even as a Radical , and at my expense , "
151118	151155	151112	151112	Audley	500	" but the air is growing cold , and you are not accustomed to our climate . Nay , if you are too poetic for catarrhs and rheums , I 'm not , - come in . "
151478	151481	151459	151481	not one of those men whom author or reader wish to view at a distance , and remember as " my Lord "	18027	" my Lord "
151508	151520	151521	151522	Harley L'Estrange	503	" He is so natural that every one calls him affected . "
151553	151558	151551	151551	he	502	" a beautiful countenance , "
151716	151726	151728	151728	Audley	500	" You were only , then , in jest , "
151735	151756	151728	151728	Audley	500	" when you spoke of this mission to Florence . You have still no idea of entering into public life ? "
151757	151760	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" None . "
151761	151824	151728	151728	Audley	500	" I had hoped better things when I got your promise to pass one season in London ; but , indeed , you have kept your promise to the ear to break it to the spirit . I could not presuppose that you would shun all society , and be as much of a hermit here as under the vines of Como . "
151825	151894	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" I have sat in the Strangers ' Gallery , and heard your great speakers ; I have been in the pit of the opera , and seen your fine ladies ; I have walked your streets ; I have lounged in your parks , and I say that I ca n't fall in love with a faded dowager , because she fills up her wrinkles with rouge . "
151895	151903	151911	151911	Audley	500	" Of what dowager do you speak ? "
151913	151964	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" She has a great many titles . Some people call her Fashion , you busy men , Politics : it is all one , - tricked out and artificial . I mean London Life . No , I ca n't fall in love with her , fawning old harridan ! "
151965	151976	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" I wish you could fall in love with something . "
151977	151988	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" I wish I could , with all my heart . "
151989	151996	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" But you are so blaze . "
151997	152018	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" On the contrary , I am so fresh . Look out of the window - what do you see ? "
152019	152022	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" Nothing ! "
152023	152026	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" Nothing ? "
152027	152051	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" Nothing but houses and dusty lilacs , my coachman dozing on his box , and two women in pattens crossing the kennel . "
152052	152119	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" I see not those where I lie on the sofa . I see but the stars . And I feel for them as I did when I was a schoolboy at Eton . It is you who are blaze , not I. Enough of this . You do not forget my commission with respect to the exile who has married into your brother 's family ? "
152120	152143	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" No ; but here you set me a task more difficult than that of saddling your cornet on the War Office . "
152144	152189	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" I know it is difficult , for the counter influence is vigilant and strong ; but , on the other hand , the enemy is so damnable a traitor that one must have the Fates and the household gods on one 's side . "
152190	152193	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" Nevertheless , "
152207	152224	152195	152197	the practical Audley	500	" I think that the best plan would be to attempt a compromise with the traitor . "
152225	152233	152235	152235	Harley	503	" To judge of others by myself , "
152240	152287	152235	152235	Harley	503	" it were less bitter to put up with wrong than to palter with it for compensation . And such wrong ! Compromise with the open foe - that maybe done with honour ; but with the perjured friend - that were to forgive the perjury ! "
152288	152294	152296	152296	Egerton	500	" You are too vindictive , "
152298	152311	152296	152296	Egerton	500	" there may be excuses for the friend , which palliate even - "
152312	152363	152235	152235	Harley	503	" Hush ! Audley , hush ! or I shall think the world has indeed corrupted you . Excuse for the friend who deceives , who betrays ! No , such is the true outlaw of Humanity ; and the Furies surround him even while he sleeps in the temple . "
152402	152412	152392	152392	his	2990	" It is time you should marry , Harley . "
152413	152416	152418	152418	L'Estrange	502	" No , "
152431	152613	152418	152418	L'Estrange	502	" not time yet ; for my chief objection to that change in life is , that the women nowadays are too old for me , or I am too young for them . A few , indeed , are so infantine that one is ashamed to be their toy ; but most are so knowing that one is afraid to be their dupe . The first , if they condescend to love you , love you as the biggest doll they have yet dandled , and for a doll 's good qualities , - your pretty blue eyes and your exquisite millinery . The last , if they prudently accept you , do so on algebraical principles ; you are but the X or the Y that represents a certain aggregate of goods matrimonial , - pedigree , title , rent - roll , diamonds , pin - money , opera - box . They cast you up with the help of mamma , and you wake some morning to find that plus wife minus affection equals - the Devil ! "
152614	152617	152619	152619	Audley	500	" Nonsense , "
152628	152678	152619	152619	Audley	500	" I grant that it is often the misfortune of a man in your station to be married rather for what he has than for what he is ; but you are tolerably penetrating , and not likely to be deceived in the character of the woman you court . "
152679	152871	152418	152418	L'Estrange	502	" Of the woman I court ? - No ! But of the woman I marry , very likely indeed ! Woman is a changeable thing , as our Virgil informed us at school ; but her change par excellence is from the fairy you woo to the brownie you we d. It is not that she has been a hypocrite , - it is that she is a transmigration . You marry a girl for her accomplishments . She paints charmingly , or plays like Saint Cecilia . Clap a ring on her finger , and she never draws again , - except perhaps your caricature on the back of a letter , - and never opens a piano after the honeymoon . You marry her for her sweet temper ; and next year , her nerves are so shattered that you ca n't contradict her but you are whirled into a storm of hysterics . You marry her because she declares she hates balls and likes quiet ; and ten to one but what she becomes a patroness at Almack 's , or a lady - in - waiting . "
152872	152885	152619	152619	Audley	500	" Yet most men marry , and most men survive the operation . "
152886	153014	152418	152418	L'Estrange	502	" If it were only necessary to live , that would be a consolatory and encouraging reflection . But to live with peace , to live with dignity , to live with freedom , to live in harmony with your thoughts , your habits , your aspirations - and this in the perpetual companionship of a person to whom you have given the power to wound your peace , to assail your dignity , to cripple your freedom , to jar on each thought and each habit , and bring you down to the meanest details of earth , when you invite her , poor soul , to soar to the spheres - that makes the To Be or Not To Be , which is the question . "
153015	153055	152619	152619	Audley	500	" If I were you , Harley , I would do as I have heard the author of ' Sandford and Merton ' did , - choose out a child and educate her yourself , after your own heart . "
153056	153062	153064	153064	Harley	503	" You have hit it , "
153068	153101	153064	153064	Harley	503	" That has long been my idea , - a very vague one , I confess . But I fear I shall be an old man before I find even the child . "
153102	153105	153106	153106	he	503	" Ah ! "
153125	153240	153241	153241	He	503	" ah , if indeed I could discover what I seek , - one who , with the heart of a child , has the mind of a woman ; one who beholds in nature the variety , the charm , the never feverish , ever healthful excitement that others vainly seek in the bastard sentimentalities of a life false with artificial forms ; one who can comprehend , as by intuition , the rich poetry with which creation is clothed , - poetry so clear to the child when enraptured with the flower , or when wondering at the star ! If on me such exquisite companionship were bestowed - why , then - "
153263	153312	153241	153241	He	503	" But once - but once only , did such vision of the Beautiful made Human rise before me , - rise amidst ' golden exhalations of the dawn . ' It beggared my life in vanishing . You know only - you only - how - how - "
153328	153333	153335	153335	Audley	500	" So long ago ! "
153343	153361	153335	153335	Audley	500	" Years so long and so weary , yet still thus tenacious of a mere boyish memory ! "
153362	153369	153371	153371	Harley	503	" Away with it , then ! "
153386	153402	153371	153371	Harley	503	" Your carriage still waits : set me home before you go to the House . "
153417	153565	153414	153414	he	503	" Is it for you , Audley Egerton , to speak sneeringly of boyish memories ? What else is it that binds us together ? What else warms my heart when I meet you ? What else draws your thoughts from blue - books and beer - bills to waste them on a vagrant like me ? Shake hands . Oh , friend of my boyhood ! recollect the oars that we plied and the bats that we wielded in the old time , or the murmured talk on the moss - grown bank , as we sat together , building in the summer air castles mightier than Windsor . Ah , they are strong ties , those boyish memories believe me ! I remember , as if it were yesterday , my translation of that lovely passage in Persius , beginning - let me see - ah !
153566	153577	153612	153612	I	0	" ' Quum primum pavido custos mihi purpura cernet , ' -
153619	153633	153612	153612	I	0	" ' Nescio quod , certe est quod me tibi temperet astrum . ' "
153634	153655	153612	153612	I	0	" What was the star I know not , but certainly some star it was that attuned me unto thee . "
153723	153728	153740	153741	Audley Egerton	500	" Question , question ! "
153729	153734	153740	153741	Audley Egerton	500	" Divide , divide ! "
153991	153995	153981	153981	he	17982	" How affected ! "
153997	154001	153981	153981	he	17982	" How romantic ! "

Suppose we do n't , you will only have raised expectations in your mother which must end in bitter disappointment ; and suppose we do , it will be time enough to write when something definite is settled .

154395	154404	154463	154463	Richard	455	" But my mother will be so anxious - "
154405	154452	154334	154334	he	450	" Make your mind easy on that score . I will write regularly to Mr. Dale , and he can tell her that you are well and thriving . No more words , my man , - when I say a thing , I say it . "

155991	156016	155917	155918	Mrs. Pompley	916	" The colonel was trying this very day to guess what he is worth ; but he says it is impossible to guess it . "

157942	157960	157938	157938	he	895	" The climate would have killed my child , and it is two years since I returned . "
157961	157983	158043	158044	The colonel	5966	" You ought to have found a very good place in England to make it worth your while to leave Canada . "
157984	158002	157938	157938	he	895	" She could not have lived through another winter in Canada , - the doctor said so . "

158018	158042	158011	158012	Mr. Digby	895	" I would not come to you , Colonel Pompley , while you could think that I came as a beggar for myself . "
158049	158058	158043	158044	The colonel	5966	" A very honourable sentiment , Mr. Digby . "

158108	158192	158103	158104	The colonel	5966	" Do n't talk so , Digby , - I do n't like it . You are younger than I am - nothing more disagreeable than these gloomy views of things . You have got enough to live upon , you say , - at least so I understand you . I am very glad to hear it ; and , indeed , I could not assist you - so many claims on me . So it is all very well , Digby . "

158213	158312	158201	158202	the soldier	15059	" I am a suppliant , not for myself , but my child ! I have but one , - only one , a girl . She has been so good to me ! She will cost you little . Take her when I die ; promise her a shelter , a home . I ask no more . You are my nearest relative . I have no other to look to . You have no children of your own . She will be a blessing to you , as she has been all upon earth to me ! "

158463	158486	158458	158459	Mr. Digby	895	" Oh , Colonel , let me see your wife . Her heart I can touch , - she is a woman . "
158631	158892	158627	158628	The colonel	5966	" Sir , I wonder at your impudence . See Mrs. Pompley ! Hush , sir , hush ! - hold your tongue . I have disowned your connection . I will not have my wife - a woman , sir , of the first family - disgraced by it . Yes ; you need not fire up . John Pompley is not a man to be bullied in his own house . I say disgraced . Did not you run into debt , and spend your fortune ? Did not you marry a low creature , - a vulgarian , a tradesman 's daughter ? - and your poor father such a respectable man , - a benefited clergyman ! Did not you sell your commission ? Heaven knows what became of the money ! Did not you turn I shudder to say it a common stage - player , sir ? And then , when you were on your last legs , did I not give you L200 out of my own purse to go to Canada ? And now here you are again , - and ask me , with a coolness that - that takes away my breath - takes away - my breath , sir - to provide for the child you have thought proper to have , - a child whose connections on the mother 's side are of the most abject and discreditable condition . Leave my house , leave it ! good heavens , sir , not that way ! - this . "
158907	158923	158894	158895	the colonel	5966	" I will let you out this way . If Mrs. Pompley should see you ! "
159117	159120	159122	159122	he	5966	" There , "
159124	159166	159122	159122	he	5966	" that is all I can do for you . Do leave the town as quick as you can , and do n't mention your name to any one . Your father was such a respectable man , - beneficed clergyman ! "
159167	159205	159109	159110	the colonel	5966	" And paid for your commission , Mr. Pompley . My name ! I am not ashamed of it . But do not fear I shall claim your relationship . No ; I am ashamed of you ! "

160547	160556	160536	160536	he	895	" Cott ! let us breathe and live . "
160597	160605	160607	160607	he	16471	" It is cold , my dear , "
160630	160677	160614	160615	The passenger	6185	" Cold - ugh ! I do believe the English are the stuffiest people ! Look at their four - post beds - all the curtains drawn , shutters closed , board before the chimney - not a house with a ventilator ! Cold - ugh ! "

160798	160806	160808	160809	Mr. Digby	895	" Sir , I did not speak , "
160813	160819	160749	160749	he	895	" But Miss here did . "
160820	160825	160827	160827	Helen	894	" Ah , sir ! "

160850	160863	160865	160866	Mr. Digby	895	" No , my dear ; the gentleman is in his right , "
160879	160895	160876	160876	he	895	" Excuse her , sir . She thinks a great deal too much of me . "
160923	160926	160928	160928	he	16471	" Well , "

162110	162136	162144	162144	he	6235	" Well , send for the doctor to be here at seven . That leaves us at least some hours free from allopathy and murder , "

162377	162405	162373	162373	Helen	894	" But do not fear ; I can nurse Papa . I think he has been worse before , - that is , he has complained more . "

163457	163484	163451	163453	DR . MORGAN	943	" Of course you do n't . There are no poisons with us . That 's just the difference between you and me , Dr. Dosewell . "
163502	163527	163485	163487	DR . DOSEWELL	755	" Indeed , I have always said that if you can do no good , you can do no harm , with your infinitesimals . "

164060	164069	164055	164057	DR . DOSEWELL	755	" My excellent friend , good - by . "
164078	164101	164070	164072	DR . MORGAN	943	" I forgot . I do n't think our poor patient is very rich . I confide him to your disinterested benevolence . "

164170	164188	164160	164161	Mr. Digby	895	" But you are in the hands of a - of a - gentleman in the profession . "

164268	164281	164265	164266	a man	15003	" Who knew his rights ; and , knowing , dared maintain . "
164386	164402	164404	164404	he	942	" Answer me , my dear , frankly , - is your papa rich ? - "
164420	164425	164427	164427	Helen	894	" Alas , no ! "
164433	164440	164427	164427	Helen	894	" Is that all you have ? "
164441	164444	164378	164378	He	942	" All . "
164445	164455	164457	164458	Mr. Digby	895	" I am ashamed to offer you two guineas , "
164466	164559	164378	164378	He	942	" And I should be still more ashamed to take them . Good by , sir . Come here , my child . Keep your money , and do n't waste it on the other doctor more than you can help . His medicines can do your father no good . But I suppose you must have some . He 's no physician , therefore there 's no fee . He 'll send a bill , - it ca n't be much . You understand . And now , God bless you . "
164579	164660	164575	164575	he	942	" The poor people upstairs can pay you , but not that doctor , - and he 's of no use . Be kind to the little girl , and get the doctor to tell his patient quietly of course to write to his friends - soon - you understand . Somebody must take charge of the poor child . And stop - hold your hand ; take care - these globules for the little girl when her father dies , "
164669	164694	164663	164664	the doctor	1651	" grief , - aconite , and if she cries too much afterwards , these - do n't mistake . Tears , - caustic ! "
164695	164700	164702	164703	the coachman	6285	" Come , sir , "
164705	164713	164729	164729	he	6213	" Coming ; tears , - caustic , "
164816	164826	164805	164805	She	918	" Why do n't you give a Dejeune dansant ? "
164901	164906	164908	164908	he	450	" My dear uncle , "
164912	164915	164917	164918	Mr. Avenel	455	" Ha ! "
164924	164932	164917	164918	Mr. Avenel	455	" Ha - well , what now ? "
164933	164995	165018	165018	he	455	" I have just received a letter from Mr. Dale . He tells me that my poor mother is very restless and uneasy , because he can not assure her that he has heard from me ; and his letter requires an answer . Indeed I shall seem very ungrateful to him - to all - if I do not write . "
165006	165009	165002	165002	He	455	" Pish ! "
165047	165052	165054	165054	he	455	" Well , Leonard , "
165060	165129	165054	165054	he	455	" it is time that I should give you some idea of my plans with regard to you . You have seen my manner of living - some difference from what you ever saw before , I calculate ! Now I have given you , what no one gave me , a lift in the world ; and where I place you , there you must help yourself . "
165130	165139	165141	165141	Leonard	450	" Such is my duty and my desire , "
165145	165273	165141	165141	Leonard	450	" Good . You are a clever lad , and a genteel lad , and will do me credit . I have had doubts of what is best for you . At one time I thought of sending you to college . That , I know ; is Mr. Dale 's wish ; perhaps it is your own . But I have given up that idea ; I have something better for you . You have a clear head for business , and are a capital arithmetician . I think of bringing you up to superintend my business ; by and by I will admit you into partnership ; and before you are thirty you will be a rich man . Come , does that suit you ? "
165274	165279	165281	165281	Leonard	450	" My dear uncle , "
165292	165380	165281	165281	Leonard	450	" it is not for me to have a choice . I should have preferred going to college , because there I might gain independence for myself and cease to be a burden on you . Moreover , my heart moves me to studies more congenial with the college than the counting - house . But all this is nothing compared with my wish to be of use to you , and to prove in any way , however feebly , my gratitude for all your kindness . "
165381	165392	165394	165394	Richard	455	" You 're a good , grateful , sensible lad , "
165398	165622	165394	165394	Richard	455	" and believe me , though I 'm a rough diamond , I have your true interest at heart . You can be of use to me , and in being so you will best serve yourself . To tell you the truth , I have some idea of changing my condition . There 's a lady of fashion and quality who , I think , may condescend to become Mrs. Avenel ; and if so , I shall probably reside a great part of the year in London . I do n't want to give up my business . No other investment will yield the same interest . But you can soon learn to superintend it for me , as some day or other I may retire , and then you can step in . Once a member of our great commercial class , and with your talents you may be anything , - member of parliament , and after that , minister of State , for what I know . And my wife - hem ! that is to be - has great connections , and you shall marry well ; and - oh , the Avenels will hold their heads with the highest , after all ! Damn the aristocracy ! we clever fellows will be the aristocrats , eh ? "
166052	166068	166048	166048	he	450	" You here , Mr. Sprott ! What could bring you so far from home ? "
166069	166073	166075	166076	the tinker	1701	" ' Ome ! "
166078	166144	166075	166076	the tinker	1701	" I ' as no ' ome ! or rather , d ' ye see , Muster Fairfilt , I makes myself at ' ome verever I goes ! Lor ' love ye ! I ben't settled on no parridge . I wanders here and I vanders there , and that 's my ' ome verever I can mend my kettles and sell my tracks ! "
166180	166187	166193	166193	he	468	" But , dash my wig , "
166199	166219	166193	166193	he	468	" vy , you bees a rale gentleman , now , surely ! Vot 's the dodge , eh ? "
166220	166223	166225	166225	Leonard	450	" Dodge ! "
166229	166236	166225	166225	Leonard	450	" I do n't understand you . "
166296	166322	166323	166323	he	450	" You must excuse me for leaving you - I have business in the town ; and do me the favour to accept this trifle , "
166351	166366	166348	166348	himself	1701	" Ho , ' ush - money ! No go , my swell cove . "

166685	166689	166690	166690	he	455	" A tinker ! "
166694	166740	166690	166690	he	455	" that 's a vagrant ; and I 'm a magistrate , and I 've a great mind to send you to the treadmill , - that I have . What do you do here , I say ? You have not answered my question . "
166741	166749	166751	166752	Mr. Sprott	468	" What does I do ' ere ? "
166754	166779	166751	166752	Mr. Sprott	468	" Vy , you had better ax my crakter of the young gent I saw you talking with just now ; he knows me . "
166780	166788	166690	166690	he	455	" What ! my nephew knows you ? "
166789	166794	166796	166797	the tinker	1701	" W - hew , "

167703	167713	167715	167717	Mr. Richard Avenel	455	" In for a penny in for a pound , "
167719	167728	167715	167717	Mr. Richard Avenel	455	" I wonder what Mrs. M'Catchley will say ? "
167810	167817	167819	167820	Mr. Avenel	455	" Please the pigs , then , "
167824	167831	167819	167820	Mr. Avenel	455	" I shall pop the question ! "

169530	169553	169594	169594	he	455	" Excuse me . I 'll just go and see what is the matter ; pray , stay till I come back . "
169586	169593	169629	169630	Richard Avenel	455	" But what 's the matter ? "
169621	169627	169736	169738	Mr. Richard Avenel	455	" God bless my soul ! "
169728	169734	169762	169762	herself	16413	" God bless my soul ! "

169961	170012	170130	170131	Richard Avenel	455	" I do n't see what there is to laugh at ! A brother and sister meet after many years ' separation , and the sister cries , poor thing . For my part I think it very natural that she should cry ; but not that you should laugh ! "
170137	170147	170183	170184	Jane Fairfield	842	" You impudent , ungrateful , audacious - drab ! "

170230	170308	170207	170207	You	6475	" You nasty , dirty , dusty dowdy ! How dare you come here to disgrace me in my own house and premises , after my sending you L50 ! To take the very time , too , when - when Richard gasped for breath ; and the laugh of his guests rang in his ears , and got into his chest , and choked him . Jane Fairfield drew herself up , and her tears were dried .
170309	170327	170333	170333	Richard	455	" I did not come to disgrace you ! I came to see my boy , and - "
170328	170331	170333	170333	Richard	455	" Ha ! "
170335	170340	170341	170341	He	455	" to see him . "

170367	170373	170396	170397	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" I believe you lie . "
170374	170394	170396	170397	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" He does not lie ; and he is as good as yourself , and better , Richard Avenel , "
170399	170486	170577	170578	Mr. Avenel	455	" and I wo n't stand here and hear him insulted , - that 's what I wo n't . And as for your L50 , there are forty - five of it ; and I 'll work my fingers to the bone till I pay back the other five . And do n't be afeard I shall disgrace you , for I 'll never look on your face agin ; and you 're a wicked , bad man , - that 's what you are ! "

170590	170627	170648	170649	Richard Avenel	455	" There - sit down - and do n't stir till I come back again , and can talk to you calmly . Leonard , follow me , and help to explain things to our guests . "
170638	170646	170648	170649	Richard Avenel	455	" What do you mean , sir ? "
170657	170677	170693	170693	he	450	" Shaking your head at me ? Do you intend to disobey me ? You had better take care ! "
170696	170756	170764	170766	poor Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Sir , you have been kind to me , and generous , and that thought alone silenced my indignation when I heard you address such language to my mother ; for I felt that , if I spoke , I should say too much . Now I speak , and it is to say , shortly , that - "
170757	170762	170764	170766	poor Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Hush , boy , "
170770	170793	170806	170806	Leonard	450	" do n't mind me . I did not come to make mischief , and ruin your prospex . I 'll go ! "
170794	170804	170905	170905	he	450	" Will you ask her pardon , Mr. Avenel ? "
170897	170903	170905	170905	he	450	" Come a step nearer , "
170911	170919	170986	170986	Leonard	450	" and I 'll knock you down . "
170974	170984	170986	170986	Leonard	450	" You can not strike me , Mr. Avenel , "
170988	171020	170961	170962	the Freeman	959	" for you are aware that I could not strike again my mother 's brother . As her son , I once more say to you , - ask her pardon . "
171021	171157	171173	171173	Leonard	450	" Ten thousand devils ! Are you mad ? - or do you want to drive me mad ? You insolent beggar , fed and clothed by my charity ! Ask her pardon ! - what for ? That she has made me the object of jeer and ridicule with that d - -d cotton gown and those double - d - -d thick shoes - I vow and protest they 've got nails in them ! Hark ye , sir , I 've been insulted by her , but I 'm not to be bullied by you . Come with me instantly , or I discard you ; not a shilling of mine shall you have as long as I live . Take your choice : be a peasant , a labourer , or - "
171158	171171	171173	171173	Leonard	450	" A base renegade to natural affection , a degraded beggar indeed ! "
171186	171212	171251	171251	Richard	455	" Mother , Mother , come away . Never fear , - I have strength and youth , and we will work together as before . "
171244	171249	171251	171251	Richard	455	" Confound you both ! "
171253	171296	171612	171613	the colonel	5966	" You ca n't be seen creeping out of my house now . Keep her here , you young viper , you ; keep her till I come back ; and then , if you choose to go , go and be - "

171670	171678	171725	171726	the colonel	5966	" allow me three words with you . "
171719	171723	171739	171740	Mrs. Pompley	916	" Monstrous impudent ! "
171728	171737	171743	171743	she	918	" Let Mrs. M'Catchley alone , my dear , "
171753	171753	171759	171759	Richard	455	"
171754	171757	171759	171759	Richard	455	" Madam , "
171773	171784	171743	171743	she	918	" I rely on you to do me a favour . "
171785	171789	171822	171822	Richard	455	" On me ? "
171790	171820	171822	171822	Richard	455	" On you , and you alone . You have influence with all those people , and a word from you will effect what I desire . Mrs. M'Catchley , "
171832	171870	171881	171882	Mrs. M'Catchley	918	" I flatter myself that you have some friendship for me , which is more than I can say of any other soul in these grounds ; will you do me this favour , ay or no ? "
171871	171879	171881	171882	Mrs. M'Catchley	918	" What is it , Mr. Avenel ? "
171910	171945	171959	171960	the widow	1592	" Get all your friends - all the company , in short - to come back into the tent for refreshments , for anything . I want to say a few words to them . "
171946	171957	171959	171960	the widow	1592	" Bless me ! Mr. Avenel - a few words ! "
171962	171997	172009	172009	Air	961	" but that 's just what they 're all afraid of . You must pardon me , but you really ca n't ask people to a dejeune dansant , and then - scold 'em ! "
171998	172007	172076	172076	He	455	" I 'm not going to scold them , "
172017	172075	172228	172228	he	455	" upon my honour , I 'm not . I 'm going to make all right , and I even hope afterwards that the dancing may go on - and that you will honour me again with your hand . I leave you to your task ; and believe me , I 'm not an ungrateful man . "
172221	172226	172228	172228	he	455	" Ladies and Gentlemen , "
172230	172268	172208	172209	Mr. Avenel	455	" I have taken the liberty to invite you once more into this tent , in order to ask you to sympathize with me upon an occasion which took us all a little by surprise to - day .
172269	172290	172320	172321	Mr. Avenel	455	" Of course , you all know I am a new man , - the maker of my own fortunes . "
172313	172318	172320	172321	Mr. Avenel	455	" Probably , too , "
172323	172550	172559	172559	he	455	" you may know that I am the son of very honest tradespeople . I say honest , and they are not ashamed of me ; I say tradespeople , and I 'm not ashamed of them . My sister married and settled at a distance . I took her son to educate and bring up . But I did not tell her where he was , nor even that I had returned from America ; I wished to choose my own time for that , when I could give her the surprise , not only of a rich brother , but of a son whom I intended to make a gentleman , so far as manners and education can make one . Well , the poor dear woman has found me out sooner than I expected , and turned the tables on me by giving me a surprise of her own invention . Pray , forgive the confusion this little family - scene has created ; and though I own it was very laughable at the moment , and I was wrong to say otherwise , yet I am sure I do n't judge ill of your good hearts , when I ask you to think what brother and sister must feel who parted from each other when they were boy and girl . To me "
172577	172636	172805	172805	his	962	" to me this has been a very happy occasion ! I 'm a plain man : no one can take ill what I 've said . And wishing that you may be all as happy in your family as I am in mine - humble though it be - I beg to drink your very good healths ! "
172820	172825	172918	172919	Sir Compton	962	" Ladies and Gentlemen , "
172831	172916	172934	172937	the dean 's lady	6034	" I am sure that I express the feelings of all present when I say that we have heard with great delight and admiration the words addressed to us by our excellent host . Applause . And if any of us , in what - Mr. Avenel describes justly as the surprise of the moment , were betrayed into an unseemly merriment at - at - the dean 's lady whispered ' some of the ' - some of the - some of the - "
172928	172932	172934	172937	the dean 's lady	6034	" holiest sentiments , "
172939	172983	172985	172986	Sir Compton	962	" ay , some of the holiest sentiments in our nature , I beg him to accept our sincerest apologies . I can only say , for my part , that I am proud to rank Mr. Avenel amongst the gentlemen of the county "
172995	173031	172985	172986	Sir Compton	962	" and to thank him for one of the most brilliant entertainments it has ever been my lot to witness . If he won his fortune honestly , he knows how to spend it nobly . "
173040	173098	173133	173134	Richard Avenel	455	" I am not accustomed to public speaking , but I could not repress my sentiments . And I 've now only to propose to you the health of our host . Richard Avenel , Esquire ; and to couple with that the health of his - very interesting sister , and long life to them both . "
173124	173131	173137	173137	he	455	" I 'm a cursed humbug , "
173142	173151	173278	173278	he	455	" but the world is such a humbug ! "
173270	173276	173295	173297	Sir Compton Delaval	962	" Now for another dance ! "
173310	173345	173667	173667	he	455	" You have not yet danced with my eldest daughter ; so if you 'll not ask her , why , I must offer her to you as your partner . Here , Sarah . "
173673	173687	173693	173694	Mrs. M'Catchley	918	" How shall I thank you for the favour you have done me ? "
173688	173691	173711	173711	She	918	" Oh ! "
173698	173710	173667	173667	he	455	" It was no favour , and I am so glad - "
173714	173731	173667	173667	he	455	" You 're not ashamed of me , then , in spite of what has happened ? "
173732	173751	173667	173667	he	455	" Ashamed of you ! Why , I should be so proud of you , if I were - "
173752	173878	173909	173910	the widow	1592	" Finish the sentence and say - ' your wife ! ' - there , it is out . My dear madam , I am rich , as you know ; I love you very heartily . With your help , I think I can make a figure in a larger world than this : and that , whatever my father , my grandson at least will be - but it is time enough to speak of him . What say you ? - you - turn away . I 'll not tease you , - it is not my way . I said before , ay or no ; and your kindness so emboldens me that I say it again , ay or no ? "
173879	173907	173926	173926	Richard	455	" But you take me so unawares - so - so - Lord ! my dear Mr. Avenel ; you are so hasty - I - I - "
173919	173924	173953	173954	the suitor	6549	" Those horrid Pompleys ! "
173944	173951	173953	173954	the suitor	6549	" I press for your answer , "
173960	173977	174024	174025	Colonel Pompley	887	" I shall leave this place to - morrow , if you will not give it . "
173978	173986	173953	173954	the suitor	6549	" Leave this place - leave me ? "
173987	173994	174003	174004	the widow	1592	" Then you will be mine ? "
173995	174001	174003	174004	the widow	1592	" Ah , Mr. Avenel ! "
174015	174021	174027	174027	Richard	455	" who can resist you ? "
174032	174050	174098	174099	the Pompleys	915	" No hurry for that now , Colonel , - Mrs. M'Catchley feels already at home here . "
174083	174096	174143	174144	the colonel	5966	" He is a very clever man and a very good fellow , "
174131	174141	174158	174159	the colonel	5966	" He will stand for our city - Vulgarian ! "
174146	174156	174170	174170	she	6561	" And his wife will walk out before me , "
174164	174168	174344	174345	Richard Avenel	455	" nasty woman ! "
174334	174342	174344	174345	Richard Avenel	455	" That must be the first step , "
174347	174358	174417	174419	Air . Avenel	961	" and I suppose they have come to their senses . "
174407	174415	174417	174419	Air . Avenel	961	" Did they go through the keyhole ? "
174421	174432	174460	174460	he	455	" Ha ! I see ! the window is open ! "
174455	174458	174460	174460	he	455	" Well , "
174470	174492	174680	174680	Richard	455	" I suppose I shall soon hear from them : they 'll be wanting my money fast enough , I fancy . "
174670	174678	174680	174680	Richard	455	" Of all people in the world , "
174689	174711	174735	174735	his	1479	" there are none so disagreeable , insolent , and ungrateful as poor relations . I wash my hands of them ! "
174726	174729	174735	174735	his	1479	" Life , "
174740	174865	174879	174880	Captain Roland	444	" is a certain quantity in time , which may be regarded in two ways , - First , as life integral ; Second , as life fractional . Life integral is that complete whole expressive of a certain value , large or small , which each man possesses in himself . Life fractional is that same whole seized upon and invaded by other people , and subdivided amongst them . They who get a large slice of it say , ' A very valuable life this ! ' Those who get but a small handful say , ' So , so ; nothing very great ! ' Those who get none of it in the scramble exclaim , ' Good for nothing ! ' "
174866	174877	174882	174883	My father	1479	" I do n't understand a word you are saying , "
174890	175217	175223	175224	my father	1479	" I will make it all clear , even to your understanding . When I sit down by myself in my study , having carefully locked the door on all of you , alone with my books and thoughts , I am in full possession of my integral life . I am totus , teres , atque rotundus , - a whole human being , equivalent in value , we will say , for the sake of illustration , to a fixed round sum , L100 for example . But when I go forth into the common apartment , each of those to whom I am of any worth whatsoever puts his finger into the bag that contains me , and takes out of me what he wants . Kitty requires me to pay a bill ; Pisistratus to save him the time and trouble of looking into a score or two of books ; the children to tell them stories , or play at hide - and - seek ; and so on throughout the circle to which I have incautiously given myself up for plunder and subdivision . The L100 which I represented in my study is now parcelled out ; I am worth L40 or L50 to Kitty , L20 to Pisistratus , and perhaps 30s . to the children . This is life fractional . And I cease to be an integral till once more returning to my study , and again closing the door on all existence but my own . Meanwhile , it is perfectly clear that to those who , whether I am in the study or whether I am in the common sitting - room , get nothing at all out of me , I am not worth a farthing . It must be wholly indifferent to a native of Kamschatka whether Austin Caxton be or be not razed out of the great account - book of human beings .
175218	175221	175223	175224	my father	1479	" Hence , "
175227	175371	174882	174883	My father	1479	" hence it follows that the more fractional a life be - that is , the greater the number of persons among whom it can be subdivided - why , the more there are to say , ' A very valuable life that ! ' Thus the leader of a political party , a conqueror , a king , an author , who is amusing hundreds or thousands or millions , has a greater number of persons whom his worth interests and affects than a Saint Simeon Stylites could have when he perched himself at the top of a column ; although , regarded each in himself , Saint Simeon , in his grand mortification of flesh , in the idea that he thereby pleased his Divine Benefactor , might represent a larger sum of moral value per se than Bonaparte or Voltaire . "
175375	175397	175398	175400	MR . CAXTON	409	" Perfectly clear , sir ; but I do n't see what it has to do with ' My Novel . ' "
175403	176323	176324	176324	BLANCHE	411	" Everything . Your novel , if it is to be a full and comprehensive survey of the ' Quicquid agunt homines ' which it ought to be , considering the length and breadth to which I foresee , from the slow development of your story , you meditate extending and expanding it , will embrace the two views of existence , - the integral and the fractional . You have shown us the former in Leonard , when he is sitting in his mother 's cottage , or resting from his work by the little fount in Riccabocca 's garden . And in harmony with that view of his life , you have surrounded him with comparative integrals , only subdivided by the tender hands of their immediate families and neighbours , - your squires and parsons , your Italian exile and his Jemima . With all these , life is , more or less , the life natural , and this is always , more or less , the life integral . Then comes the life artificial , which is always , more or less , the life fractional . In the life natural , wherein we are swayed but by our own native impulses and desires , subservient only to the great silent law of Virtue which has pervaded the universe since it swung out of chaos , a man is of worth from what he is in himself , - Newton was as worthy before the apple fell from the tree as when all Europe applauded the discoverer of the Principle of Gravity . But in the life artificial we are only of worth inasmuch as we affect others ; and , relative to that life , Newton rose in value more than a million per cent when down fell the apple from which ultimately sprang up his discovery . In order to keep civilization going and spread over the world the light of human intellect , we have certain desires within us , ever swelling beyond the ease and independence which belongs to us as integrals . Cold man as Newton might be he once took a lady 's hand in his own , Kitty , and used her forefinger for his tobacco - stopper , - great philosopher ! , cold as he might be , he was yet moved into giving his discoveries to the world , and that from motives very little differing in their quality from the motives that make Dr. Squills communicate articles to the ' Phrenological Journal ' upon the skulls of Bushmen and wombats . For it is the property of light to travel . When a man has light in him , forth it must go . But the first passage of genius from its integral state in which it has been reposing on its own wealth into the fractional is usually through a hard and vulgar pathway . It leaves behind it the reveries of solitude , - that self - contemplating rest which may be called the Visionary , - and enters suddenly into the state that may be called the Positive and Actual . There it sees the operations of money on the outer life ; sees all the ruder and commoner springs of action ; sees ambition without nobleness , love without romance ; is bustled about and ordered and trampled and cowed , - in short , it passes an apprenticeship with some Richard Avenel , and does not detect what good and what grandeur , what addition even to the true poetry of the social universe , fractional existences like Richard Avenel 's bestow ; for the pillars that support society are like those of the Court of the Hebrew Tabernacle , - they are of brass , it is true , but they are filleted with silver . From such intermediate state Genius is expelled and driven on its way , and would have been so in this case had Mrs. Fairfield who is but the representative of the homely natural affections , strongest ever in true genius , - for light is warm never crushed Mr. Avenel 's moss rose on her sisterly bosom . Now , forth from this passage and defile of transition into the larger world , must Genius go on , working out its natural destiny amidst things and forms the most artificial . Passions that move and influence the world are at work around it . Often lost sight of itself , its very absence is a silent contrast to the agencies present . Merged and vanished for a while amidst the Practical World , yet we ourselves feel all the while that it is there ; is at work amidst the workings around it . This practical world that effaces it rose out of some genius that has gone before ; and so each man of genius , though we never come across him , as his operations proceed in places remote from our thoroughfares , is yet influencing the practical world that ignores him , for ever and ever . That is GENIUS ! We ca n't describe it in books ; we can only hint and suggest it by the accessories which we artfully heap about it . The entrance of a true Probationer into the terrible ordeal of Practical Life is like that into the miraculous cavern , by which , legend informs us , Saint Patrick converted Ireland . "
176327	176339	176340	176342	MR . CAXTON	409	" What is that legend ? I never heard of it . "
176345	176632	176634	176635	my father	1479	" My dear , you will find it in a thin folio at the right on entering my study , written by Thomas Messingham , and called ' Florilegium Insulae Sanctorum , ' etc . The account therein is confirmed by the relation of an honest soldier , one Louis Ennius , who had actually entered the cavern . In short , the truth of the legend is undeniable , unless you mean to say , which I ca n't for a moment suppose , that Louis Ennius was a liar . Thus it runs : Saint Patrick , finding that the Irish pagans were incredulous as to his pathetic assurances of the pains and torments destined to those who did not expiate their sins in this world , prayed for a miracle to convince them . His prayer was heard ; and a certain cavern , so small that a man could not stand up therein at his ease , was suddenly converted into a Purgatory , comprehending tortures sufficient to convince the most incredulous . One unacquainted with human nature might conjecture that few would be disposed to venture voluntarily into such a place ; on the contrary , pilgrims came in crowds . Now , all who entered from vain curiosity or with souls unprepared perished miserably ; but those who entered with deep and earnest faith , conscious of their faults , and if bold , yet humble , not only came out safe and sound , but purified , as if from the waters of a second baptism . See Savage and Johnson at night in Fleet Street , - and who shall doubt the truth of Saint Patrick 's Purgatory ! "

But ah , Lenny , when I saw thee , looking so handsome , and when thee turned and cried ' Mother , ' my heart was just ready to leap out o ' my mouth , and so I could not help hugging thee , if I had died for it . And thou wert so kind , that I forgot all Mr. Sprott had said about Dick 's pride , or thought he had just told a fib about that , as he had wanted me to believe a fib about thee . Then Dick came up - and I had not seen him for so many years - and we come o ' the same father and mother ; and so - and so - "

After all , I ca n't have too little of relations till I have fairly secured Mrs. M'Catchley . An Honourable ! I wonder if that makes me an Honourable too ? This cursed Debrett contains no practical information on those points . "
178393	178400	178421	178421	Leonard	450	" I hope he will starve ! "
178410	178419	178440	178440	he	450	" Listen to me , my dear mother , "
178447	178601	178434	178435	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" I do assure you from my heart that I do not regret the loss of favours which I see plainly would have crushed out of me the very sense of independence . But do not fear for me ; I have education and energy , - I shall do well for myself , trust me . - No , I can not , it is true , go back to our cottage ; I can not be a gardener again . Do n't ask me , - I should be discontented , miserable . But I will go up to London ! That 's the place to make a fortune and a name : I will make both . Oh , yes , trust me , I will . You shall soon be proud of your Leonard ; and then we will always live together , - always ! Do n't cry . "
178602	178619	178440	178440	he	450	" But what can you do in Lunnon , - such a big place , Lenny ? "
178620	178681	178434	178435	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" What ! Every year does not some lad leave our village , and go and seek his fortune , taking with him but health and strong hands ? I have these , and I have more : I have brains and thoughts and hopes , that - again I say , No , no ; never fear for me ! "
178702	178738	178434	178435	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Well . But you will write to Mr. Dale or to me ? I will get Mr. Dale or the good mounseer now I know they were not agin me to read your letters . "
178739	178745	178780	178780	she	6652	" I will , indeed ! "
178746	178778	178434	178435	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" And , boy , you have nothing in your pockets . We have paid Dick ; these , at least , are my own , after paying the coach fare . "
178804	178831	178927	178927	he	450	" And there 's a sixpence with a hole in it . Do n't part with that , Lenny ; it will bring thee good luck . "
178940	178950	178916	178916	she	452	" It was so selfish in me , Lenny . "
178951	178966	178976	178977	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Pooh , pooh ! Has not a mother a right to her child ? "
178967	178974	178976	178977	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Ay , ay , ay ! "
178979	179022	179031	179031	Leonard	450	" I do love you as a child , - my own child . But if I was not your mother , after all , Lenny , and cost you all this - oh , what would you say of me then ? "
179023	179029	179031	179031	Leonard	450	" Not my own mother ! "
179039	179086	179093	179094	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Well , I do n't know what I should say then differently from what I say now , - that you , who brought me up and nursed and cherished me , had a right to my home and my heart , wherever I was . "

180545	180554	180564	180565	the landlady	6222	" Can I have accommodation for the night ? "
180555	180562	180564	180565	the landlady	6222	" Why , indeed , sir , "
180569	180632	180695	180696	The landlady	6222	" I can give you a bedroom , but I do n't know where to put you meanwhile . The two parlours and the tap - room and the kitchen are all choke - full . There has been a great cattle - fair in the neighbourhood , and I suppose we have as many as fifty farmers and drovers stopping here . "
180633	180694	180745	180745	Leonard	450	" As to that , ma'am , I can sit in the bedroom you are kind enough to give me ; and if it does not cause you much trouble to let me have some tea there , I should be glad ; but I can wait your leisure . Do not put yourself out of the way for me . "
180714	180744	180814	180815	the hostess	6000	" You speak very handsome , sir , and we will do our best to serve you , if you will excuse all faults . This way , sir . "
180802	180812	180814	180815	the hostess	6000	" It is small , sir , and high , "
180819	180851	180869	180869	Leonard	450	" But there be four gentlemen farmers that have come a great distance , and all the first floor is engaged ; you will be more out of the noise here . "
180852	180867	180869	180869	Leonard	450	" Nothing can suit me better . But , stay , - pardon me ; "
180886	180925	180933	180934	the landlady	6222	" A little girl whom I saw in the churchyard yonder , weeping very bitterly - is she a relation of yours ? Poor child ! she seems to have deeper feelings than are common at her age . "
180926	180931	180933	180934	the landlady	6222	" Ah , sir , "
180946	181036	181136	181137	the hostess	6000	" it is a very sad story . I do n't know what to do . Her father was taken ill on his way to Lunnon , and stopped here , and has been buried four days . And the poor little girl seems to have no relations - and where is she to go ? Laryer Jones says we must pass her to Marybone parish , where her father lived last ; and what 's to become of her then ? My heart bleeds to think on it . "
181121	181125	181161	181161	he	450	" Open - Sesame "
181155	181159	181183	181183	he	16471	" No relatives ? "
181190	181190	181161	181161	he	450	"
181191	181310	181183	181183	he	16471	" Yes , sir ; he was quite reasonable like to the last . And I asked him if he had not anything on his mind , and he said , ' I have . ' And I said , ' Your little girl , sir ? ' And he answered me , ' Yes , ma'am ; ' and laying his head on his pillow , he wept very quietly . I could not say more myself , for it set me off to see him cry so meekly ; but my husband is harder nor I , and he said , ' Cheer up , Mr. Digby ; had not you better write to your friends ? '
181311	181484	181491	181491	Leonard	450	" ' Friends ! ' said the gentleman , in such a voice ! ' Friends I have but one , and I am going to Him ! I can not take her there ! ' Then he seemed suddenly to recollect himself , and called for his clothes , and rummaged in the pockets as if looking for some address , and could not find it . He seemed a forgetful kind of gentleman , and his hands were what I call helpless hands , sir ! And then he gasped out , ' Stop , stop ! I never had the address . Write to Lord Les - ' , something like Lord Lester , but we could not make out the name . Indeed he did not finish it , for there was a rush of blood to his lips ; and though he seemed sensible when he recovered and knew us and his little girl too , till he went off smiling , he never spoke word more . "
181485	181489	181491	181491	Leonard	450	" Poor man , "
181497	181512	181183	181183	he	16471	" But his little girl surely remembers the name that he did not finish ? "
181513	181678	181491	181491	Leonard	450	" No . She says he must have meant a gentleman whom they had met in the Park not long ago , who was very kind to her father , and was Lord something ; but she do n't remember the name , for she never saw him before or since , and her father talked very little about any one lately , but thought he should find some kind friends at Screwstown , and travelled down there with her from Lunnon . But she supposes he was disappointed , for he went out , came back , and merely told her to put up the things , as they must go back to Lunnon . And on his way there he - died . Hush , what 's that ? I hope she did not overhear us . No , we were talking low . She has the next room to your'n , sir . I thought I heard her sobbing . Hush ! "
181679	181714	181183	181183	he	16471	" In the next room ? I hear nothing . Well , with your leave , I will speak to her before I quit you . And had her father no money with him ? "
181715	181788	181491	181491	Leonard	450	" Yes , a few sovereigns , sir ; they paid for his funeral , and there is a little left still , - enough to take her to town ; for my husband said , says he , ' Hannah , the widow gave her mite , and we must not take the orphan 's ; ' and my husband is a hard man , too , sir - bless him ! "
181789	181803	181183	181183	he	16471	" Let me take your hand , ma'am . God reward you both . "
181804	181878	181491	181491	Leonard	450	" La , sir ! why , even Dr. Dosewell said , rather grumpily though , ' Never mind my bill ; but do n't call me up at six o'clock in the morning again , without knowing a little more about people . ' And I never afore knew Dr. Dosewell go without his bill being paid . He said it was a trick o ' the other doctor to spite him . "
181879	181884	181183	181183	he	16471	" What other doctor ? "
181885	181934	181940	181940	Leonard	450	" Oh , a very good gentleman , who got out with Mr. Digby when he was taken ill , and stayed till the next morning ; and our doctor says his name is Morgan , and he lives in Lunnou , and is a homy - something . "
181935	181938	181183	181183	he	16471	" Homicide , "
181944	181996	181183	181183	he	16471	" Ah , homicide ; something like that , only a deal longer and worse . But he left some of the tiniest little balls you ever see , sir , to give the child ; but , bless you , they did her no good , - how should they ? "
181997	182028	181183	181183	he	16471	" Tiny balls , oh - homoeopathist - I understand . And the doctor was kind to her ; perhaps he may help her . Have you written to him ? "
182029	182047	181183	181183	he	16471	" But we do n't know his address , and Lunnon is a vast place , sir . "
182048	182060	181183	181183	he	16471	" I am going to London and will find it out . "
182061	182104	182111	182111	Leonard	450	" Ah , sir , you seem very kind ; and sin ' she must go to Lunnon for what can we do with her here ? - she 's too genteel for service , I wish she was going with you . "
182105	182109	182111	182111	Leonard	450	" With me ! "
182116	182125	182201	182203	the land lady	6765	" with me ! Well , why not ? "
182126	182199	182201	182203	the land lady	6765	" I am sure she comes of good blood , sir . You would have known her father was quite the gentleman , only to see him die , sir . He went off so kind and civil like , as if he was ashamed to give so much trouble , - quite a gentleman , if ever there was one . And so are you , sir , I 'm sure , "
182207	182271	183108	183108	He	14972	" I know what gentlefolk be . I 've been a housekeeper in the first of families in this very shire , sir , though I ca n't say I 've served in Lunnon ; and so , as gentlefolks know each other , I ' ve no doubt you could find out her relations . Dear , dear ! Coming , coming ! "
183124	183135	183901	183901	She	6000	" Father , Father , do you hear me now ? "
183916	183922	183940	183940	he	450	" Do not desert me . "
183949	183982	184400	184400	she	894	" Orphan , will you go with me ? We have one Father yet to both of us , and He will guide us on earth . I am fatherless like you . "
184403	184406	184948	184948	Leonard	450	" No . "
184935	184946	185334	185334	he	450	" Shall we be as happy when we are great ? "
185326	185332	185339	185339	himself	450	" Sit here , sister , "
185360	185360	185432	185432	he	450	"
185418	185431	185441	185441	Helen	894	" And so this London is really very vast , - VERY ? "
185436	185439	185499	185499	she	894	" Very , "
185463	185497	185499	185499	she	894	" See how the flowers are carried down the stream ! They are lost now . London is to us what the river is to the flowers , very vast , very strong ; "
185506	185510	185535	185535	he	450	" very cruel ! "
185511	185534	185738	185738	she	894	" Cruel ! Ah , it has been so to you ; but now - now I will take care of you ! "
185611	185626	185634	185634	Helen	894	" And it is not a very handsome city , either , you say ? "
185627	185632	185634	185634	Helen	894	" Very ugly indeed , "
185640	185650	185738	185738	she	894	" at least all I have seen of it . "
185651	185683	185692	185692	Helen	894	" But there must be parts that are prettier than others ? You say there are parks : why should not we lodge near them and look upon the green trees ? "
185684	185690	185692	185692	Helen	894	" That would be nice , "
185697	185700	185692	185692	Helen	894	" but - "
185708	185721	185738	185738	she	894	" there are no lodgings for us except in courts and alleys . "
185722	185725	185738	185738	she	894	" Why ? "
185726	185729	185738	185738	she	894	" Why ? "
185744	185821	185826	185826	Helen	894	" Pooh ! always that horrid purse ; as if , too , we were not going to fill it ! Did not I tell you the story of Fortunio ? Well , at all events , we will go first to the neighbourhood where you last lived , and learn there all we can ; and then the day after to - morrow I will see this Dr. Morgan , and find out the lord . "
185831	185843	185738	185738	she	894	" You want to get rid of me soon , brother . "
185844	185902	185915	185915	Helen	894	" I ! Ah , I feel so happy to have you with me it seems to me as if I had pined for you all my life , and you had come at last ; for I never had brother nor sister nor any one to love , that was not older than myself , except - "
185903	185913	185946	185946	Leonard	450	" Except the young lady you told me of , "
185928	185944	185946	185946	Leonard	450	" Yes , I loved her , love her still . But that was different , "
185948	185994	186084	186084	he	6891	" I could never have talked to her as to you : to you I open my whole heart ; you are my little Muse , Helen : I confess to you my wild whims and fancies as frankly as if I were writing poetry . "
186077	186082	186096	186096	Leonard	450	" Curse that perch ! "
186088	186094	186111	186112	The angler	6892	" Take care , sir , "
186115	186136	186174	186175	the stranger	1691	" What 's the matter ? Hist ! you have frightened my perch . Keep still , ca n't you ? "
186162	186172	186174	186175	the stranger	1691	" It is the most extraordinary perch , that ! "
186179	186227	186252	186252	he	450	" It has the devil 's own luck . It must have been born with a silver spoon in its mouth , that damned perch ! I shall never catch it , - never ! Ha ! no , only a weed . I give it up . "
186257	186270	186276	186276	Leonard	450	" Humph ! are you intimately acquainted with this stream , sir ? "
186271	186274	186276	186276	Leonard	450	" No , "
186278	186285	186286	186286	ANGLER	6898	" I never saw it before . "
186291	186329	186330	186330	LEONARD	450	" Then , young man , take my advice , and do not give way to its fascinations . Sir , I am a martyr to this stream ; it has been the Delilah of my existence . "
186342	186351	186428	186429	the angler	6892	" The Delilah ! sir , the Delilah ! "
186355	186426	186428	186429	the angler	6892	" The Delilah . Young man , listen , and be warned by example . When I was about your age , I first came to this stream to fish . Sir , on that fatal day , about three p.m. , I hooked up a fish , - such a big one , it must have weighed a pound and a half . Sir , it was that length ; "
186435	186650	186651	186651	LEONARD	450	" And just when I had got it nearly ashore , by the very place where you are sitting , on that shelving bank , young man , the line broke , and the perch twisted himself among those roots , and - cacodaemon that he was - ran off , hook and all . Well , that fish haunted me ; never before had I seen such a fish . Minnows I had caught in the Thames and elsewhere , also gudgeons , and occasionally a dace . But a fish like that - a PERCH , all his fins up , like the sails of a man - of - war - a monster perch , - a whale of a perch ! No , never till then had I known what leviathans lie hid within the deeps . I could not sleep till I had returned ; and again , sir , - I caught that perch . And this time I pulled him fairly out of the water . He escaped ; and how did he escape ? Sir , he left his eye behind him on the hook . Years , long years , have passed since then ; but never shall I forget the agony of that moment . "
186654	186661	186662	186662	ANGLER	989	" To the perch , sir ? "
186665	186838	186839	186839	LEONARD	450	" Perch ! agony to him ! He enjoyed it . Agony to me ! I gazed on that eye , and the eye looked as sly and as wicked as if it were laughing in my face . Well , sir , I had heard that there is no better bait for a perch than a perch 's eye . I adjusted that eye on the hook , and dropped in the line gently . The water was unusually clear ; in two minutes I saw that perch return . He approached the hook ; he recognized his eye , frisked his tail , made a plunge , and , as I live , carried off the eye , safe and sound ; and I saw him digesting it by the side of that water - lily . The mocking fiend ! Seven times since that day , in the course of a varied and eventful life , have I caught that perch , and seven times has that perch escaped . "
186843	186882	186883	186883	ANGLER	989	" It ca n't be the same perch ; perches are very tender fish . A hook inside of it , and an eye hooked out of it - no perch could withstand such havoc in its constitution . "
186891	187109	187255	187255	he	6892	" It does seem supernatural . But it is that perch ; for hark ye , sir , there is ONLY ONE perch in the whole brook ! All the years I have fished here , I have never caught another perch ; and this solitary inmate of the watery element I know by sight better than I knew my own lost father . For each time that I have raised it out of the water , its profile has been turned to me , and I have seen with a shudder that it has had only - One Eye ! It is a most mysterious and a most diabolical phenomenon , that perch ! It has been the ruin of my prospects in life . I was offered a situation in Jamaica : I could not go with that perch left here in triumph . I might afterwards have had an appointinent in India , but I could not put the ocean between myself and that perch : thus have I frittered away my existence in the fatal metropolis of my native land . And once a week from February to December I come hither . Good heavens ! if I should catch the perch at last , the occupation of my existence will be gone . "
187239	187244	187255	187255	he	6892	" Such is Life ! "
187264	187323	187326	187327	the angler	6892	" If a man knew what it was to fish all one 's life in a stream that has only one perch , to catch that one perch nine times in all , and nine times to see it fall back into the water , plump , - if a man knew what it was , why , then "
187336	187358	187384	187384	Leonard	450	" why then , young sir , he would know what human life is to vain ambition . Good - evening . "
187376	187382	187400	187400	Helen	894	" What a strange person ! "
187388	187398	188057	188057	He	6933	" I think he is a very wise one , "
188032	188056	188083	188083	Randal	570	" Do n't be afraid ; the horse sha'n't hurt any of you . A thousand pardons - so ho ! so ho ! "
188088	188092	188057	188057	He	6933	" Frank Hazeldean ! "
188093	188102	188057	188057	He	6933	" Ah , is it indeed Randal Leslie ? "
188131	188176	188083	188083	Randal	570	" My dear fellow , how glad I am to see you . How lucky it was that I should turn in here . Not like me either , for I do n't much care for a ducking . Staying in town , Randal ? "
188177	188193	188057	188057	He	6933	" Yes ; at your uncle 's , Mr. Egerton . I have left Oxford . "
188194	188198	188083	188083	Randal	570	" For good ? "
188199	188203	188057	188057	He	6933	" For good . "
188204	188247	188083	188083	Randal	570	" But you have not taken your degree , I think ? We Etonians all considered you booked for a double - first . Oh , we have been so proud of your fame , - you carried off all the prizes . "
188248	188321	188057	188057	He	6933	" Not all ; but some , certainly . Mr. Egerton offered me my choice , - to stay for my degree , or to enter at once into the Foreign Office . I preferred the end to the means . For , after all , what good are academical honours but as the entrance to life ? To enter now is to save a step in a long way , Frank . "
188322	188342	188358	188358	Leonard	450	" Ah , you were always ambitious , and you will make a great figure , I am sure . "
188343	188357	188367	188367	Randal	570	" Perhaps so - if I work for it . Knowledge is power . "
188361	188365	188375	188377	his old schoolfellow	6940	" And you ! "
188379	188396	188406	188406	Frank	449	" You never came to Oxford . I did hear you were going into the army . "
188397	188404	188416	188416	he	449	" I am in the Guards , "
188421	188479	188375	188377	his old schoolfellow	6940	" The governor pished a little , and would rather I had come to live with him in the old Hall , and take to farming . Time enough for that , eh ? By Jove , Randal , how pleasant a thing is life in London ! Do you go to Almack 's to - night ? "
188480	188525	188534	188536	the young gentleman	15519	" No ; Wednesday is a holiday in the House . There is a great parliamentary dinner at Mr. Egerton 's . He is in the Cabinet now , you know ; but you do n't see much of your uncle , I think . "
188526	188532	188534	188536	the young gentleman	15519	" Our sets are different , "
188547	188609	188375	188377	his old schoolfellow	6940	" All those parliamentary fellows are devilish dull . The rain 's over . I do n't know whether the governor would like me to call at Grosvenor Square ; but pray come and see me . Here 's my card to remind you ; you must dine at our mess . Such capital fellows ! What day will you fix ? "
188610	188716	188722	188724	the young man	5338	" I will call and let you know . Do n't you find it rather expensive in the Guards ? I remember that you thought the governor , as you call him , used to chafe a little when you wrote for more pocket - money ; and the only time I ever saw you with tears in your eyes was when Mr. Hazeldean , in sending you L5 , reminded you that his estates were not entailed , - were at his own disposal , and they should never go to an extravagant spendthrift . It was not a pleasant threat that , Frank . "
188717	188720	188722	188724	the young man	5338	" Oh ! "
188729	188815	189124	189125	CHAPTER X.	655	" It was not the threat that pained me ; it was that my father could think so meanly of me as to fancy that - Well , well , but those were schoolboy days . And my father was always more generous than I deserved . We must see a great deal of each other , Randal . How good - natured you were at Eton , making my longs and shorts for me ; I shall never forget it . Do call soon . "
189126	189174	189234	189234	Harley	655	" But do come ; change your dress , return and dine with me ; you will have just time , Harley . You will meet the most eminent men of our party ; surely they are worth your study , philosopher that you affect to be . "
189229	189233	189455	189455	AUDLEY	500	" inglorious ease ; "
189304	189344	189455	189455	AUDLEY	500	" Nay , my dear Audley , forgive me . But your eminent men are all men of one idea , and that not a diverting one , politics ! politics ! politics ! The storm in the saucer . "
189345	189361	189455	189455	AUDLEY	500	" But what is your life , Harley ? - the saucer without the storm ? "
189362	189415	189423	189423	Audley	500	" Do you know , that 's very well said , Audley ? I did not think you had so much liveliness of repartee . Life ! life ! it is insipid , it is shallow , - no launching Argosies in the saucer . Audley , I have the oddest fancy - "
189416	189421	189423	189423	Audley	500	" That of course , "
189427	189440	189441	189441	HARLEY	655	" you never had any other . What is the new one ? "
189447	189454	189455	189455	AUDLEY	500	" Do you believe in Mesmerism ? "
189458	189462	189463	189463	HARLEY	655	" Certainly not . "
189466	189691	189767	189767	AUDLEY	500	" If it were in the power of an animal magnetizer to get me out of my own skin into somebody 's else ! That 's my fancy ! I am so tired of myself , - so tired ! I have run through all my ideas , - know every one of them by heart . When some pretentious impostor of an idea perks itself up and says , ' Look at me , - I ' m a new acquaintance , ' I just give it a nod , and say ' Not at all , you have only got a new coat on ; you are the same old wretch that has bored me these last twenty years ; get away . ' But if one could be in a new skin , if I could be for half - an - hour your tall porter , or one of your eminent matter - of - fact men , I should then really travel into a new world . ' Every man 's brain must be a world in itself , eh ? If I could but make a parochial settlement even in yours , Audley , - run over all your thoughts and sensations . Upon my life , I 'll go and talk to that French mesmerizer about it . "
189794	189809	189917	189917	himself	655	" Pooh , pooh , pooh ! Do talk like a man of sense . "
189813	189913	189917	189917	himself	655	" Man of sense ! Where shall I find a model ? I do n't know a man of sense ! - never met such a creature . Do n't believe it ever existed . At one time I thought Socrates must have been a man of sense : a delusion ; he would stand gazing into the air , and talking to his Genius from sunrise to sunset . Is that like a man of sense ? Poor Audley ! how puzzled he looks ! Well , I 'll try and talk sense to oblige you . And first "
189923	189950	189968	189968	Audley	500	" first , is it true , as I have heard vaguely , that you are paying court to the sister of that infamous Italian traitor ? "
189951	189966	189968	189968	Audley	500	" Madame di Negra ? No : I am not paying court to her , "
189975	190060	189917	189917	himself	655	" But she is very handsome ; she is very clever ; she is useful to me , - I need not say how or why ; that belongs to my metier as a politician . But I think , if you will take my advice , or get your friend to take it , I could obtain from her brother , through my influence with her , some liberal concessions to your exile . She is very anxious to know where he is . "
190061	190068	189968	189968	Audley	500	" You have not told her ? "
190069	190081	189917	189917	himself	655	" No ; I promised you I would keep that secret . "
190082	190120	189968	189968	Audley	500	" Be sure you do ; it is only for some mischief , some snare , that she could desire such information . Concessions ! pooh ! This is no question of concessions , but of rights . "
190121	190134	189917	189917	himself	655	" I think you should leave your friend to judge of that . "
190135	190171	190177	190177	Audley	500	" Well , I will write to him . Meanwhile , beware of this woman . I have heard much of her abroad , and she has the character of her brother for duplicity and - "
190172	190175	190177	190177	Audley	500	" Beauty , "
190186	190239	189917	189917	himself	655	" I am told that the count is one of the handsomest men in Europe , much handsomer than his sister still , though nearly twice her age . Tut , tut , Harley ; fear not for me . I am proof against all feminine attractions . This heart is dead . "
190240	190313	190322	190322	Audley	500	" Nay , nay ; it is not for you to speak thus , - leave that to me . But even I will not say it . The heart never dies . And you ; what have you lost ? - a wife ; true : an excellent , noble - hearted woman . But was it love that you felt for her ? Enviable man , have you ever loved ? "
190314	190320	190322	190322	Audley	500	" Perhaps not , Harley , "
190333	190368	190388	190388	Audley	500	" very few men ever have loved , at least as you mean by the word . But there are other passions than love that kill the heart , and reduce us to mechanism . "
190396	190423	190426	190426	himself	655	" Speaking of my lost wife , I am sorry that you do not approve what I have done for her young kinsman , Randal Leslie . "
190432	190451	190452	190452	AUDLEV	996	" Is it true kindness to bid him exchange manly independence for the protection of an official patron ? "
190455	190481	190482	190482	HARLEY	655	" I did not bid him . I gave him his choice . At his age , I should have chosen as he has done . "
190485	190521	190522	190522	AUDLEY	500	" I trust not ; I think better of you . But answer me one question frankly , and then I will ask another . Do you mean to make this young man your heir ? "
190529	190554	190555	190555	HARLEY	655	" Heir , pooh ! I am young still . I may live as long as he - time enough to think of that . "
190558	190586	190587	190587	AUDLEY	500	" Then now to my second question . Have you told this youth plainly that he may look to you for influence , but not for wealth ? "
190591	190605	190606	190606	HARLEY	655	" I think I have ; but I shall repeat it more emphatically . "
190609	190791	190877	190877	RANDAL	570	" Then I am satisfied as to your conduct , but not as to his . For he has too acute an intellect not to know what it is to forfeit independence ; and , depend on it , he has made his calculations , and would throw you into the bargain in any balance that he could strike in his favour . You go by your experience in judging men ; I by my instincts . Nature warns us as it does the inferior animals , - only we are too conceited , we bipeds , to heed her . My instincts of soldier and gentleman recoil from that old young man . He has the soul of the Jesuit . I see it in his eye , I hear it in the tread of his foot ; volto sciolto he has not ; i pensieri stretti he has . Hist ! I hear now his step in the hall . I should know it from a thousand . That 's his very touch on the handle of the door . "
190880	190937	190938	190938	AUDLEY	500	" I have fulfilled your commissions , Mr. Egerton . I went first to Maida Hill , and saw Mr. Burley . I gave him the check , but he said it was too much , and he should return half to the banker ; he will write the article as you suggested . I then - "
190941	190968	190969	190969	HARLEY	655	" Enough , Randal ! we will not fatigue Lord L'Estrange with these little details of a life that displeases him , - the life political . "
190972	190997	191012	191012	He	570	" But these details do not displease me ; they reconcile me to my own life . Go on , pray , Mr. Leslie . "
191024	191061	191207	191208	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Do you think , Lord L'Estrange , that the contemplation of the mode of life pursued by others can reconcile a man to his own , if he had before thought it needed a reconciler ? "
191088	191206	191257	191257	he	502	" Recollect your Lucretius , Mr. Leslie , the Suave mare , etc . , ' pleasant from the cliff to see the mariners tossed on the ocean . ' Faith , I think that sight reconciles one to the cliff , though , before , one might have been teased by the splash from the spray , and deafened by the scream of the sea - gulls . But I leave you , Audley . Strange that I have heard no more of my soldier ! Remember I have your promise when I come to claim it . Good - by , Mr. Leslie , I hope that Burley 's article will be worth the check . "
191245	191255	191257	191257	he	502	" Alas , I am found out , then , "
191261	191276	191373	191373	Egerton	500	" That terrible Duchess of Knaresborough , too - I must fly my country . "
191367	191371	191373	191373	Egerton	500	" Mr. Leslie , "
191382	191406	191503	191503	Egerton	500	" you did not act with your usual discretion in touching upon matters connected with politics in the presence of a third party . "
191407	191431	191373	191373	Egerton	500	" I feel that already , sir ; my excuse is , that I held Lord L'Estrange to be your most intimate friend . "
191432	191465	191503	191503	Egerton	500	" A public man , Mr. Leslie , would ill serve his country if he were not especially reserved towards his private friends - when they do not belong to his party . "
191466	191502	191522	191522	He	500	" But pardon me my ignorance . Lord Lansmere is so well known to be one of your supporters , that I fancied his son must share his sentiments , and be in your confidence . "
191530	191594	191614	191614	Egerton	500	" At the entrance into political life , Mr. Leslie , there is nothing in which a young man of your talents should be more on his guard than thinking for himself ; he will nearly always think wrong . And I believe that is one reason why young men of talent disappoint their friends , and remain so long out of office . "
191628	191726	191735	191735	Randal	570	" Look at Lord L'Estrange himself . What young man could come into life with brighter auspices ? Rank , wealth , high animal spirits a great advantage those same spirits , Mr. Leslie , courage , self - possession , scholarship as brilliant perhaps as your own ; and now see how his life is wasted ! Why ? He always thought fit to think for himself . He could never be broken into harness , and never will be . The state coach , Mr. Leslie , requires that all the horses should pull together . "
191727	191733	191735	191735	Randal	570	" With submission , sir , "
191737	191774	191783	191783	Egerton	500	" I should think that there were other reasons why Lord L'Estrange , whatever be his talents - and of these you must be indeed an adequate judge - would never do anything in public life . "
191775	191781	191792	191792	Randal	570	" Ay , and what ? "
191787	191790	191792	191792	Randal	570	" First , "
191796	191868	191878	191878	Audley	500	" private life has done too much for him . What could public life give to one who needs nothing ? Born at the top of the social ladder , why should he put himself voluntarily at the last step , for the sake of climbing up again ? And secondly , Lord L'Estrange seems to me a man in whose organization sentiment usurps too large a share for practical existence . "
191869	191876	191878	191878	Audley	500	" You have a keen eye , "
191885	191895	191906	191906	He	500	" keen for one so young . Poor Harley ! "
191910	192060	191906	191906	He	500	" There is something on my mind , my young friend . Let us be frank with each other . I placed before you fairly the advantages and disadvantages of the choice I gave you . To take your degree with such honours as no doubt you would have won , to obtain your fellowship , to go to the Bar , with those credentials in favour of your talents , - this was one career . To come at once into public life , to profit by my experience , avail yourself of my interest , to take the chances of rise or fall with a party , - this was another . You chose the last . But in so doing , there was a consideration which might weigh with you , and on which , in stating your reasons for your option , you were silent . "
192061	192068	191906	191906	He	500	" What is that , sir ? "
192069	192118	192129	192129	Randal	570	" You might have counted on my fortune , should the chances of party fail you : speak , and without shame if so ; it would be natural in a young man , who comes from the elder branch of the House whose heiress was my wife . "
192119	192127	192204	192204	Egerton	500	" You wound me , Mr. Egerton , "
192208	192377	192461	192461	he	570	" Once for all , then , distinctly and emphatically , I say , never count upon that ; count upon all else that I can do for you , and forgive me when I advise harshly or censure coldly ; ascribe this to my interest in your career . Moreover , before decision becomes irrevocable , I wish you to know practically all that is disagreeable or even humiliating in the first subordinate steps of him who , without wealth or station , would rise in public life . I will not consider your choice settled till the end of a year at least , - your name will be kept on the college books till then ; if on experience you should prefer to return to Oxford , and pursue the slower but surer path to independence and distinction , you can . And now give me your hand , Mr. Leslie , in sign that you forgive my bluntness : it is time to dress . "
192456	192459	192461	192461	he	570	" Sir , "
192463	192499	192505	192505	Egerton	500	" I forgot to say , that on returning from Maida Hill , I took shelter from the rain under a covered passage , and there I met unexpectedly with your nephew , Frank Hazeldean . "
192500	192503	192505	192505	Egerton	500	" Ah ! "
192509	192557	192449	192449	he	570	" a fine young man ; in the Guards . It is a pity that my brother has such antiquated political notions ; he should put his son into parliament , and under my guidance ; I could push him . Well , and what said Frank ? "
192558	192591	192505	192505	Egerton	500	" He invited me to call on him . I remember that you once rather cautioned me against too intimate an acquaintance with those who have not got their fortunes to make . "
192592	192617	192449	192449	he	570	" Because they are idle , and idleness is contagious . Right , - better not to be too intimate with a young Guardsman . "
192618	192653	192659	192659	Egerton	500	" Then you would not have me call on him , sir ? We were rather friends at Eton ; and if I wholly reject his overtures , might he not think that you - "
192654	192657	192659	192659	Egerton	500	" I ! "
192661	192697	192711	192712	his valet	4176	" Ah , true ; my brother might think I bore him a grudge ; absurd . Call then , and ask the young man here . Yet still , I do not advise intimacy . "
192706	192709	192711	192712	his valet	4176	" Sir , "
192719	192742	192754	192754	Egerton	500	" Mr. Levy is here , - he says by appointment ; and Mr. Grinders is also just come from the country . "
192743	192752	192757	192757	himself	500	" Tell Mr. Grinders to come in first , "
192759	192782	193100	193100	Egerton	500	" You need not wait ; I can dress without you . Tell Mr. Levy I will see him in five minutes . "
192916	192933	193100	193100	Egerton	500	" My dear lord , let me introduce to you a kinsman of my late wife 's "
192939	193064	193185	193185	Egerton	500	" the heir to the elder branch of her family . Stanmore , this is Mr. Leslie , of whom I spoke to you . You , who were so distinguished at Oxford , will not like him the worse for the prizes he gained there . Duke , let me present to you Mr. Leslie . The duchess is angry with me for deserting her balls ; I shall hope to make my peace , by providing myself with a younger and livelier substitute . Ah , Mr. Howard , here is a young gentleman just fresh from Oxford , who will tell us all about the new sect springing up there . He has not wasted his time on billiards and horses . "
193174	193183	193185	193185	Egerton	500	" We are in time for Almack 's , "
193192	193203	193215	193215	Egerton	500	" and I have a voucher for you ; come . "
193220	193339	193466	193468	Lady Frederick Coniers	1005	" I shall introduce you to the principal leaders of society ; know them and study them : I do not advise you to attempt to do more , - that is , to attempt to become the fashion . It is a very expensive ambition : some men it helps , most men it ruins . On the whole , you have better cards in your hands . Dance or not as it pleases you ; do n't flirt . If you flirt people will inquire into your fortune , - an inquiry that will do you little good ; and flirting entangles a young man into marrying . That would never do . Here we are . "
193470	193484	193466	193468	Lady Frederick Coniers	1005	" It is your first ball at Almack 's then , Mr. Leslie ? "
193485	193489	193466	193468	Lady Frederick Coniers	1005	" My first . "
193490	193516	193466	193468	Lady Frederick Coniers	1005	" And you have not secured a partner ? Shall I find you one ? What do you think of that pretty girl in pink ? "
193517	193530	193466	193468	Lady Frederick Coniers	1005	" I see her - but I can not think of her . "
193531	193557	193466	193468	Lady Frederick Coniers	1005	" You are rather , perhaps , like a diplomatist in a new court , and your first object is to know who is who . "
193558	193584	193466	193468	Lady Frederick Coniers	1005	" I confess that on beginning to study the history of my own day I should like to distinguish the portraits that illustrate the memoir . "
193585	193634	193643	193643	Randal	570	" Give me your arm , then , and we will come into the next room . We shall see the different notabilites enter one by one , and observe without being observed . This is the least I can do for a friend of Mr. Egerton 's . "
193635	193641	193643	193643	Randal	570	" Mr. Egerton , then , "
193663	193683	193466	193468	Lady Frederick Coniers	1005	" Mr. Egerton has had the good fortune to win your esteem even for his friends , however obscure ? "
193684	193731	193739	193739	Randal	570	" Why , to say truth , I think no one whom Mr. Egerton calls his friend need long remain obscure , if he has the ambition to be otherwise ; for Mr. Egerton holds it a maxim never to forget a friend nor a service . "
193732	193737	193749	193750	Lady Frederick	1005	" Ah , indeed ! "
193743	193747	193749	193750	Lady Frederick	1005	" And therefore , "
193752	193782	193788	193789	Mr. Leslie	570	" as he passes through life , friends gather round him . He will rise even higher yet . Gratitude , Mr. Leslie , is a very good policy . "
193783	193786	193913	193914	Lady Frederick	1005	" Hem , "
193905	193911	193913	193914	Lady Frederick	1005	" The last new Guardsman , "
193916	193935	193936	193936	RANDAL	570	" very handsome , and not yet quite spoiled . But he has got into a dangerous set . "
193939	193952	193953	193954	LADY FREDERICK	1005	" The young lady with him is handsome enough to be dangerous . "
193958	194076	193953	193954	LADY FREDERICK	1005	" No danger for him there , - as yet at least . Lady Mary the Duke of Knaresborough 's daughter is only in her second year . The first year , nothing under an earl ; the second , nothing under a baron . It will be full four years before she comes down to a commoner . Mr. Hazeldean 's danger is of another kind . He lives much with men who are not exactly mauvais ton , but certainly not of the best taste . Yet he is very young ; he may extricate himself , - leaving half his fortune behind him . What , he nods to you ! You know him ? "
194077	194088	193953	193954	LADY FREDERICK	1005	" Very well ; he is nephew to Mr. Egerton . "
194089	194130	193953	193954	LADY FREDERICK	1005	" Indeed ! I did not know that . Hazeldean is a new name in London . I heard his father was a plain country gentleman , of good fortune , but not that he was related to Mr. Egerton . "
194131	194136	193953	193954	LADY FREDERICK	1005	" Half - brother . "
194137	194154	194155	194155	RANDAL	570	" Will Mr. Egerton pay the young gentleman 's debts ? He has no sons himself . "
194158	194182	194429	194429	Randal	570	" Mr. Egerton 's fortune comes from his wife , from my family , - from a Leslie , not from a Hazeldean . "
194419	194427	194442	194445	one of the Etonians	7016	" Who is that very handsome woman ? "
194431	194440	194463	194464	a widow	1560	" An Italian , - a Marchesa something , "
194447	194451	194466	194467	her husband	1815	" Di Negra , "
194484	194484	194629	194631	The female voice	7031	"
194576	194594	194606	194608	a female voice	7030	" Oh , Madame di Negra is resolved to settle amongst us , and marry an Englishman . "
194595	194604	194606	194608	a female voice	7030	" If she can find one sufficiently courageous , "
194610	194628	194629	194631	The female voice	7031	" Well , she 's trying hard for Egerton , and he has courage enough for anything . "
194638	194656	194629	194631	The female voice	7031	" Mr Egerton knows the world too well , and has resisted too many temptations to be - "
194657	194664	194759	194759	Randal	570	" Hush ! there he is . "
194739	194757	194759	194759	Randal	570	" Is this the reason why Mr. Egerton so insultingly warns me against counting on his fortune ? "
194761	194769	194791	194791	his	500	" Does he mean to marry again ? "
194796	194857	194876	194877	the Italian	1688	" Nay , dear madam , do not ascribe to my frank admiration more gallantry than it merits . Your conversation charms me , your beauty delights me ; your society is as a holiday that I look forward to in the fatigues of my life . But I have done with love , and I shall never marry again . "
194858	194874	194895	194895	Audley	500	" You almost pique me into trying to win , in order to reject you , "
194887	194893	194898	194898	his	500	" I defy even you , "
194903	195035	195039	195039	he	500	" But to return to the point . You have more influence , at least , over this subtle ambassador ; and the secret we speak of I rely on you to obtain me . Ah , Madam , let us rest friends . You see I have conquered the unjust prejudices against you ; you are received and feted everywhere , as becomes your birth and your attractions . Rely on me ever , as I on you . But I shall excite too much envy if I stay here longer , and am vain enough to think that I may injure you if I provoke the gossip of the ill - natured . As the avowed friend , I can serve you ; as the supposed lover , No - "
195053	195076	195181	195182	the Italian	1688	" - propos , the sum you do me the honour to borrow will be paid to your bankers to - morrow . "
195077	195090	195091	195091	Audley	500	" A thousand thanks ! my brother will hasten to repay you . "
195094	195115	195039	195039	he	500	" Your brother , I hope , will repay me in person , not before . When does he come ? "
195116	195167	195091	195091	Audley	500	" Oh , he has again postponed his visit to London ; he is so much needed in Vienna . But while we are talking of him , allow me to ask if your friend , Lord L'Estrange , is indeed still so bitter against that poor brother of mine ? "
195168	195173	195181	195182	the Italian	1688	" Still the same . "
195174	195179	195181	195182	the Italian	1688	" It is shameful ! "
195187	195209	195091	195091	Audley	500	" what has my brother ever done to him that he should actually intrigue against the count in his own court ? "
195210	195238	195181	195182	the Italian	1688	" Intrigue ! I think you wrong Lord L'Estrange ; he but represented what he believed to be the truth , in defence of a ruined exile . "
195239	195258	195300	195300	Audley	500	" And you will not tell me where that exile is , or if his daughter still lives ? "
195259	195299	195315	195315	he	500	" My dear marchesa , I have called you friend , therefore I will not aid L'Estrange to injure you or yours . But I call L'Estrange a friend also ; and I can not violate the trust that - "
195309	195314	195375	195375	she	7028	" You understand me , "
195356	195367	195609	195610	the chemist	7060	" That young man has the eye of an Italian , "

195800	195836	195855	195855	he	450	" My time 's short , sir , - going abroad : and now that I am going , patients flock to me . Too late . London will repent its apathy . Let it ! "
195859	195885	195855	195855	he	450	" I am going abroad , sir , but I will make a synopsis of your case , and leave it to my successor . Hum !
195886	195915	195921	195921	Leonard	450	" Hair chestnut ; eyes - what colour ? Look this way , - blue , dark blue . Hem ! Constitution nervous . What are the symptoms ? "
195916	195919	195921	195921	Leonard	450	" Sir , "
195923	195928	195929	195931	DR . MORGAN	943	" a little girl - "
195935	195958	195959	195959	LEONARD	450	" Little girl ; never mind the history of your sufferings ; stick to the symptoms , - stick to the symptoms . "
195962	195981	195982	195984	DR . MORGAN	943	" YOU mistake me , Doctor , I have nothing the matter with me . A little girl - "
195987	196055	196056	196056	LEONARD	450	" Girl again ! I understand ! it is she who is ill . Shall I go to her ? She must describe her own symptoms , - I ca n't judge from your talk . You 'll be telling me she has consumption , or dyspepsia , or some such disease that do n't exist : mere allopathic inventions , - symptoms , sir , symptoms . "
196062	196094	196095	196097	DR . MORGAN	943	" You attended her poor father , Captain Digby , when he was taken ill in the coach with you . He is dead , and his child is an orphan . "
196107	196123	196199	196199	he	450	" Orphan ! nothing for orphans , especially if inconsolable , like aconite and chamomilla . "
196192	196197	196199	196199	he	450	" But , really , "
196205	196297	196186	196187	The doctor	1651	" I do n't see how I can help the poor child . I know nothing of her relations . This Lord Les - whatever his name is - I know of no lords in London . I knew lords , and physicked them too , when I was a blundering allopathist . There was the Earl of Lansmere , - has had many a blue pill from me , sinner that I was . His son was wiser ; never would take physic . Very clever boy was Lord L'Estrange - "
196298	196308	196199	196199	he	450	" Lord L'Estrange ! that name begins with Les - "
196309	196430	196438	196438	Leonard	450	" Stuff ! He 's always abroad , - shows his sense . I 'm going abroad too . No development for science in this horrid city , - full of prejudices , sir , and given up to the most barbarous allopathical and phlebotomical propensities . I am going to the land of Hahnemann , sir , - sold my good - will , lease , and furniture , and have bought in on the Rhine . Natural life there , sir , - homeeopathy needs nature : dine at one o'clock , get up at four , tea little known , and science appreciated . But I forget . Cott ! what can I do for the orphan ? "
196431	196436	196438	196438	Leonard	450	" Well , sir , "
196442	196452	196468	196468	he	1651	" Heaven will give me strength to support her . "
196462	196466	196468	196468	he	1651	" And yet , "
196475	196545	196546	196546	LEONARD	450	" you , young man , are , by your account , a perfect stranger to her , or were so when you undertook to bring her to London . You have a good heart , always keep it . Very healthy thing , sir , a good heart , - that is , when not carried to excess . But you have friends of your own in town ? "
196549	196561	196562	196562	DOCTOR	15078	" Not yet , sir ; I hope to make them . "
196565	196581	196589	196589	He	450	" Pless me , you do ? How ? - I ca n't make any . "
196594	196611	196628	196629	The doctor	1651	" Authors find friends in their readers , - I am going to be an author . "
196640	196656	196657	196657	LEONARD	450	" You say you walked up to London : was that from choice or economy ? "
196660	196665	196666	196666	DOCTOR	15078	" Both , sir . "
196669	196716	196788	196788	Leonard	450	" Sit down again , and let us talk . I can give you a quarter of an hour , and I 'll see if I can help either of you , provided you tell me all the symptoms , - I mean all the particulars . "
196797	196826	196764	196765	the doctor	1651	" Leonard Fairfield , grandson of my old friend , John Avenel of Lansmere ! I must shake you by the hand . Brought up by Mrs. Fairfield ! -
196827	196841	196857	196857	he	1651	" Ah , now I look , strong family likeness , - very strong "
196851	196855	196764	196765	the doctor	1651	" Poor Nora ! "
196859	196868	196926	196926	he	1651	" Nora ! Did you know my aunt ? "
196869	196905	196963	196964	the doctor	1651	" Your aunt ! Ah ! ah ! yes , yes ! Poor Nora ! she died almost in these arms , - so young , so beautiful . I remember it as if yesterday . "
196952	196961	196963	196964	the doctor	1651	" Ha ! that 's my great patient , "
196973	197083	197152	197155	two or three lords	7093	" must see him . A chronic case , excellent patient , - tic , sir , tic . Puzzling and interesting . If I could take that tic with me , I should ask nothing more from Heaven . Call again on Monday ; I may have something to tell you then as to yourself . The little girl ca n't stay with you , - wrong and nonsensical ! I will see after her . Leave me your address , - write it here . I think I know a lady who will take charge of her . Good - by . Monday next , ten o'clock . "

197580	197583	197585	197585	Leonard	450	" Ah , "
197589	197595	197678	197678	he	450	" how could I forget ? "
197681	197715	197718	197718	Helen	894	" No , no , you shall not go . This must succeed , - and we shall live together in some pretty cottage , where we can see more than one tree , "
197728	197736	197756	197756	she	894	" No , I will not go . "
197766	197788	198129	198129	he	3156	" Guard me against my own selfish heart ; may I never be a burden to him who has shielded me . "
198137	198246	198254	198254	Leonard	450	" If I publish this poem for you , speaking as a trader , I shall be a considerable loser . Did I publish all I admire , out of sympathy with the author , I should be a ruined man . But suppose that , impressed as I really am with the evidence of no common poetic gifts in this manuscript , I publish it , not as a trader , but a lover of literature , I shall in reality , I fear , render you a great disservice , and perhaps unfit your whole life for the exertions on which you must rely for independence .

198247	198252	198270	198270	he	450	" How , sir ? "
198256	198269	198277	198277	his	450	" Not that I would ask you to injure yourself for me , "
198280	198560	198570	198570	Leonard	450	" How , my young friend ? I will explain . There is enough talent in these verses to induce very flattering reviews in some of the literary journals . You will read these , find yourself proclaimed a poet , will cry ' I am on the road to fame . ' You will come to me , ' And my poem , how does it sell ? ' I shall point to some groaning shelf , and say , ' Not twenty copies ! The journals may praise , but the public will not buy it . ' ' But you will have got a name , ' you say . Yes , a name as a poet just sufficiently known to make every man in practical business disinclined to give fair trial to your talents in a single department of positive life ; none like to employ poets ; - a name that will not put a penny in your purse , - worse still , that will operate as a barrier against every escape into the ways whereby men get to fortune . But having once tasted praise , you will continue to sigh for it : you will perhaps never again get a publisher to bring forth a poem , but you will hanker round the purlieus of the Muses , scribble for periodicals , fall at last into a bookseller 's drudge . Profits will be so precarious and uncertain , that to avoid debt may be impossible ; then , you who now seem so ingenuous and so proud , will sink deeper still into the literary mendicant , begging , borrowing - "
198561	198568	198589	198590	the publisher	7134	" Never ! never ! never ! "
198579	198587	198589	198590	the publisher	7134	" Such would have been my career , "
198592	198642	198277	198277	his	450	" but I luckily had a rich relative , a trader , whose calling I despised as a boy , who kindly forgave my folly , bound me as an apprentice , and here I am ; and now I can afford to write books as well as sell them .
198643	198679	198589	198590	the publisher	7134	" Young man , you must have respectable relations , - go by their advice and counsel ; cling fast to some positive calling . Be anything in this city rather than poet by profession . "
198680	198697	198277	198277	his	450	" And how , sir , have there ever been poets ? Had they other callings ? "
198698	198709	198718	198718	his	450	" Read their biography , and then - envy them ! "
198726	198751	198762	198763	the bookseller	7135	" I have read their biography . True , their lot was poverty , - perhaps hunger . Sir , I - envy them ! "
198752	198760	198762	198763	the bookseller	7135	" Poverty and hunger are small evils , "
198772	198786	198718	198718	his	450	" There are worse , - debt and degradation , and - despair . "
198787	198807	198873	198874	the publisher	7134	" No , sir , no , you exaggerate ; these last are not the lot of all poets . "
198808	198871	198910	198910	he	450	" Right , for most of our greatest poets had some private means of their own . And for others - why , all who have put into a lottery have not drawn blanks . But who could advise another man to set his whole hope of fortune on the chance of a prize in a lottery ? And such a lottery ! "
198906	198909	198946	198946	his	450	" Yes , "
198925	198944	199037	199037	he	7140	" yes , you were right : London is very vast , very strong , and very cruel ; "
199046	199069	199141	199142	the homoeopathist	6213	" Well , you will call on me on Monday , and we will see . Meanwhile , borrow these of me ! "
199132	199139	199141	199142	the homoeopathist	6213	" You are an obstinate mule , "
199150	199168	199174	199174	Leonard	450	" Will you work at something practical and prosy , and let the poetry rest a while ? "
199169	199172	199174	199174	Leonard	450	" Yes , "
199178	199183	199141	199142	the homoeopathist	6213	" I will work . "
199184	199224	199238	199238	He	450	" Very well , then . I know an honest bookseller , and he shall give you some employment ; and meanwhile , at all events , you will be among books , and that will be some comfort . "
199230	199237	199257	199258	the doctor	1651	" A great comfort , sir . "
199252	199255	199257	199258	the doctor	1651	" But , "
199262	199273	199238	199238	He	450	" you really feel a strong predisposition to make verses ? "
199274	199280	199314	199314	he	450	" I did , sir . "
199281	199310	199314	199314	he	450	" Very bad symptom indeed , and must be stopped before a relapse ! Here , I have cured three prophets and ten poets with this novel specific . "
199324	199352	199365	199365	Helen	894	" Agaricus muscarius dissolved in a tumbler of distilled water , - teaspoonful whenever the fit comes on . Sir , it would have cured Milton himself . "
199353	199362	199365	199365	Helen	894	" And now for you , my child , "
199367	199428	199433	199433	Helen	894	" I have found a lady who will be very kind to you . Not a menial situation . She wants some one to read to her and tend on her ; she is old and has no children . She wants a companion , and prefers a girl of your age to one older . Will this suit you ? "
199445	199461	199467	199468	the doctor	1651	" No , I can not leave him now , - he is so sad . "
199462	199465	199467	199468	the doctor	1651	" Cott ! "
199470	199524	199541	199542	the doctor	1651	" you two must have been reading ' Paul and Virginia . ' If I could but stay in England , I would try what ignatia would do in this case , - interesting experiment ! Listen to me , little girl , and go out of the room , you , sir . "
199551	199562	199541	199542	the doctor	1651	" What 's your Christian name ? - I forget . "
199563	199566	199541	199542	the doctor	1651	" Helen . "
199567	199680	199695	199695	she	7150	" Helen , listen . In a year or two you will be a young woman , and it would be very wrong then to live alone with that young man . Meanwhile you have no right to cripple all his energies . He must not have you leaning on his right arm , - you would weigh it down . I am going away , and when I am gone there will be no one to help you , if you reject the friend I offer you . Do as I tell you , for a little girl so peculiarly susceptible a thorough pulsatilla constitution can not be obstinate and egotistical . "
199681	199693	199695	199695	she	7150	" Let me see him cared for and happy , sir , "
199699	199708	199541	199542	the doctor	1651	" and I will go where you wish . "
199709	199755	199767	199767	she	894	" He shall be so ; and to - morrow , while he is out , I will come and fetch you . Nothing so painful as leave - taking , shakes the nervous system , and is a mere waste of the animal economy . "
199770	199817	199832	199833	the doctor	1651	" But he may know where I am ? We may see each other sometimes ? Ah , sir , it was at my father 's grave that we first met , and I think Heaven sent him to me . Do not part us forever . "
199818	199830	199832	199833	the doctor	1651	" I should have a heart of stone if I did , "
199837	199886	199893	199894	the doctor	1651	" and Miss Starke shall let him come and visit you once a week . I 'll give her something to make her . She is naturally indifferent to others . I will alter her whole constitution , and melt her into sympathy - with rhododendron and arsenic ! "
199899	199907	199893	199894	the doctor	1651	" Mr. Prickett , Bookseller , Holborn , "
199921	199952	200300	200301	the doctor	1651	" I will call on Prickett myself tonight and prepare him for your visit . But I hope and trust you will only have to stay there a few days . "
200290	200298	200300	200301	the doctor	1651	" It will not be for long , "
200303	200351	200734	200734	he	1016	" his relations are respectable and well off . I will write to his grandparents , and in a few days I hope to relieve you of the charge . Of course , if you do n't want him , I will repay what he costs meanwhile . "
200719	200732	200734	200734	he	1016	" Oh , give up poetry , and stick to a shop , "
200736	200791	200874	200874	I	0	" and to cure you forever of the mad whim to be author , I 'll just lend you the ' Life and Works of Chatterton . ' You may take it home with you and read before you go to bed . You 'll come back quite a new man to - morrow . "
200903	200905	201017	201018	the bookseller	7135	" forget "
201013	201015	201479	201479	he	450	" Chatterton "
201516	201520	201726	201727	No man	2116	" mighty line . "
201743	201747	201726	201727	No man	2116	" Richard the Third "
201749	201752	201898	201898	he	450	" Othello . "
201885	201896	201898	201898	he	450	" Oh , that she had been by my side ! "
201900	202043	202157	202158	the boy	14972	" Oh , that I could have felt the touch of her confiding hand ; that , looking up from the scathed and dreary ruin of this life , that had sublimely lifted itself from the plain , and sought to tower aloft from a deluge , her mild look had spoken to me of innocent , humble , unaspiring childhood ! Ah ! If indeed I were still necessary to her , - still the sole guardian and protector , - then could I say to myself ; ' Thou must not despair and die ! Thou hast her to live and to strive for . ' But no , no ! Only this vast and terrible London , - the solitude of the dreary garret , and those lustrous eyes , glaring alike through the throng and through the solitude . "
202149	202155	202191	202191	he	14948	" I call by appointment , "
202173	202189	202268	202268	himself	450	" Master is just gone out to a patient : please to wait , sir ; "
202282	202343	202469	202469	Leonard	450	" Why did he tell me to come ? What new can he think of for me ? And if a favour , should I take it ? He has given me the means of bread by work : that is all I have a right to ask from him , from any man , - all I should accept . "
202447	202468	202471	202471	his	450	" How dare you come into my room , and pe reading my letters ? Er - r - r ! "
202488	202520	202550	202550	his	1651	" This letter relates to me , belongs to me , crushes me . I have seen enough to know that . I demand to read all , - learn all . "
202553	202564	202580	202580	Leonard	450	" What have you read ? Tell me the truth . "
202565	202579	202671	202671	he	1651	" Two lines only , and I am called - I am called - "
202646	202669	202756	202757	the physician	6242	" Sit down , sit down ; calm yourself ; you shall know all , - read all ; drink this water ; "
202748	202754	202756	202757	the physician	6242	" Wait a few moments , "
202761	202853	202861	202861	Leonard	450	" and hear me meanwhile . It is very unfortunate you should have seen a letter never meant for your eye , and containing allusions to a secret you were never to have known . But if I tell you more , will you promise me , on your word of honour , that you will hold the confidence sacred from Mrs. Fairfield , the Avenels , - from all ? I myself am pledged to conceal a secret , which I can only share with you on the same condition . "
202854	202859	202861	202861	Leonard	450	" There is nothing , "
202875	202901	202946	202946	he	450	" nothing , it seems , that I should be proud to boast of . Yes , I promise ; the letter , the letter ! "
202941	202945	202946	202946	he	450	" Pulse decreasing , "
202949	202955	203581	203581	he	450	" wonderful thing , aconite ! "
203585	203589	203604	203604	he	1651	" Thank Heaven ! "
203607	203611	203639	203639	He	450	" For what ? "
203612	203638	203604	203604	he	1651	" I have nothing to pity or excuse in the woman I knew and honoured as a mother . I am not her son - her- "
203643	203660	203661	203661	Leonard	450	" No : but do n't be hard on your true mother , - poor Nora ! "
203674	203734	203805	203805	he	450	" Oh , my own mother ! my dead mother ! Thou for whom I felt so mysterious a love , - thou from whom I took this poet soul ! pardon me , pardon me ! Hard on thee ! Would that thou wert living yet , that I might comfort thee ! What thou must have suffered ! "
203800	203804	203805	203805	he	450	" Tell her , "
203814	203885	203938	203939	Dr. Morgan	942	" tell Mrs. Avenel that she is obeyed ; that I will never seek her roof , never cross her path , never disgrace her wealthy son . But tell her , also , that I will choose my own way in life , - that I will not take from her a bribe for concealment . Tell her that I am nameless , and will yet make a name . "
203925	203936	203938	203939	Dr. Morgan	942	" I do not doubt it , my prave poy , "
203948	203959	204021	204021	he	942	" and perhaps you may find a father , who - "
203960	204001	204021	204021	he	942	" Father ! who is he , what is he ? He lives , then ! But he has deserted me , - he must have betrayed her ! I need him not . The law gives me no father . "
204024	204043	204059	204059	he	942	" But I should know who he is - as another one whose path I may not cross . "
204054	204057	204059	204059	he	942	" Nay , "
204064	204081	204238	204239	Dr. Morgan	942	" as you know so much , it is surely best that you should know all . "
204226	204236	204238	204239	Dr. Morgan	942	" And never , therefore , named your father , "
204241	204249	204256	204256	Leonard	450	" We knew not who he was . "
204250	204254	204256	204256	Leonard	450	" And how , "
204261	204289	204238	204239	Dr. Morgan	942	" how have they dared to slander this dead mother ? How knew they that I - was - was - was not the child of wedlock ? "
204290	204375	204386	204386	Leonard	450	" There was no wedding - ring on Nora 's finger , never any rumour of her marriage ; her strange and sudden appearance at her father 's house ; her emotions on entrance , so unlike those natural to a wife returning to a parent 's home , - these are all the evidence against her . But Mrs. Avenel deemed them strong , and so did I. You have a right to think we judged too harshly , - perhaps we did . "
204376	204384	204386	204386	Leonard	450	" And no inquiries were ever made ? "
204397	204411	204442	204443	the Welshman	7293	" no inquiries to learn who was the father of the motherless child ? "
204412	204440	204497	204498	Mark Fairfield	521	" Inquiries ! Mrs. Avenel would have died first . Your grandmother 's nature is very rigid . Had she come from princes , from Cadwallader himself , "
204516	204637	204654	204654	Leonard	450	" Mrs. Fairfield was nursing her own infant two or three months old ; she took charge of you ; Nora was buried and the secret kept . None out of the family knew of it but myself and the curate of the town , - Mr. Dale . The day after your birth , Mrs. Fairfield , to prevent discovery , moved to a village at some distance . There her child died ; and when she returned to Hazeldean , where her husband was settled , you passed as the son she had lost . Mark , I know , was as a father to you , for he had loved Nora : they had been children together . "
204638	204652	204654	204654	Leonard	450	" And she came to London , - London is strong and cruel , "
204656	204748	204749	204752	The man - servant	1931	" She was friendless and deceived . I see all , - I desire to know no more . This father - he must in deed have been like those whom I have read of in books . To love , to wrong her , - that I can conceive ; but then to leave , to abandon ; no visit to her grave , no remorse , no search for his own child . Well , well ; Mrs. Avenel was right . Let us think of him no more . "
204765	204781	204787	204787	Leonard	450	" Sir , the ladies are getting very impatient , and say they 'll go . "
204782	204785	204787	204787	Leonard	450	" Sir , "
204800	204896	205445	205446	the doctor	1651	" I ask your pardon for taking up your time so long . I go now . I will never mention to my moth - I mean to Mrs. Fairfield - what I have learned , nor to any one . I will work my way somehow . If Mr. Prickett will keep me , I will stay with him at present ; but I repeat , I can not take Mrs. Avenel 's money and be bound apprentice . Sir , you have been good and patient with me , - Heaven reward you . "
205435	205443	205753	205754	the customer	4189	" Sovereign against rage and sombre thoughts , "
205744	205751	205753	205754	the customer	4189	" Mr. Prickett , Mr. Prickett ! "
205756	205781	205782	205783	Mr. Prickett	1016	" I am ashamed of you . You presume to put upon this work , in two volumes , the sum of eight shillings . "
205797	205819	205849	205849	Leonard	450	" What ! Mr. Burley , is that you ? But for your voice , I should not have known you . "
205820	205848	205908	205910	MR . BURLEY	998	" Man is like a book , Mr. Prickett ; the commonalty only look to his binding . I am better bound , it is very true . "
205914	205936	205937	205939	MR . PRICKETT	1016	" But the ' Art of Thinking ' ! - you charge eight shillings for the ' Art of Thinking . ' "
205942	205954	205955	205957	MR . BURLEY	998	" Cheap enough , Mr. Burley . A very clean copy . "
205960	205994	205995	205997	MR . PRICKETT	1016	" Usurer ! I sold it to you for three shillings . It is more than one hundred and fifty per cent you propose to gain from my ' Art of Thinking . ' "
206004	206040	206041	206043	MR . BURLEY	998	" You sold it to me ! Ah , now I remember . But it was more than three shillings I gave . You forget , - two glasses of brandy - and - water . "
206046	206129	206214	206214	he	450	" Hospitality , sir , is not to be priced . If you sell your hospitality , you are not worthy to possess my ' Art of Thinking . ' I resume it . There are three shillings , and a shilling more for interest . No ; on second thoughts , instead of that shilling , I will return your hospitality : and the first time you come my way you shall have two glasses of brandy - and - water . "
206206	206213	206218	206219	Mr. Prickett	1016	" Hem ! who is that ? "
206221	206232	206233	206234	Mr. Burley	998	" A young assistant of mine , and very clever . "
206242	206269	206277	206277	Leonard	450	" We have met before , sir . But you look as if you had returned to the Brent , and been fishing for my perch . "
206270	206275	206277	206277	Leonard	450	" Possibly , sir , "
206279	206308	206328	206329	Mr. Burley	998	" But my line is tough , and is not yet broken , though the fish drags it amongst the weeds , and buries itself in the mud . "
206321	206326	206328	206329	Mr. Burley	998	" He is clever , "
206334	206339	206340	206342	MR . PRICKETT	1016	" he understands allegory . "
206345	206369	206370	206372	MR . BURLEY	998	" Poor youth ! He came to town with the idea of turning author : you know what that is , Mr. Burley . "
206381	206517	206518	206519	Mr. Prickett	1016	" Bibliopole , yes ! An author is a being between gods and men , who ought to be lodged in a palace , and entertained at the public charge upon ortolans and Tokay . He should be kept lapped in down , and curtained with silken awnings from the cares of life , have nothing to do but to write books upon tables of cedar , and fish for perch from a gilded galley . And that 's what will come to pass when the ages lose their barbarism and know their benefactors . Meanwhile , sir , I invite you to my rooms , and will regale you upon brandy - and - water as long as I can pay for it ; and when I can not - you shall regale me . "
206522	206529	206666	206667	Mr. Burley	998	" A very bad bargain indeed , "
206672	206719	206935	206935	Leonard	450	" Excuse me , sir , but you understand perch - fishing ; and since we find ourselves on the same road , I should like to be better acquainted with you . I hear you once wished to be an author . I am one . "
206925	206933	206935	206935	Leonard	450	" You are an author , sir , "
206937	206980	206981	206983	MR . BURLEY	998	" Well ; and what is your report of the calling ? Yonder column props an urn . The column is tall , and the urn is graceful . But it looks out of place by the roadside : what say you ? "
206986	206995	206996	206996	LEONARD	450	" It would look better in the churchyard . "
206999	207011	207012	207014	MR . BURLEY	998	" So I was thinking . And you are an author ! "
207017	207102	207130	207131	Mr. Burley	998	" Ah , I said you had a quick sense of allegory . And so you think an author looks better in a churchyard , when you see him but as a muffled urn under the moonshine , than standing beneath the gas - lamp in a white hat , and with a red tip to his nose . Abstractedly , you are right . But , with your leave , the author would rather be where he is . Let us walk on . "
207121	207128	207130	207131	Mr. Burley	998	" To return to the urn , "
207134	207214	207239	207239	Leonard	450	" you think of fame and churchyards . Natural enough , before illusion dies ; but I think of the moment , of existence , - and I laugh at fame . Fame , sir - not worth a glass of cold - without ! And as for a glass of warm , with sugar - and five shillings in one 's pocket to spend as one pleases - what is there in Westminster Abbey to compare with it ? "
207215	207238	207387	207387	he	1026	" Talk on , sir , - I should like to hear you talk . Let me listen and hold my tongue . "
207362	207385	207387	207387	he	1026	" What do I care what men without are to say and think of the words that gush forth on my page ? "
207389	207486	207325	207325	he	1026	" If you think of the public , of urns , and laurels , while you write , you are no genius ; you are not fit to be an author . I write because it rejoices me , because it is my nature . Written , I care no more what becomes of it than the lark for the effect that the song has on the peasant it wakes to the plough . The poet , like the lark , sings ' from his watch - tower in the skies . ' Is this true ? "
207487	207493	207387	207387	he	1026	" Yes , very true ! "
207494	207589	207325	207325	he	1026	" What can rob us of this joy ? The bookseller will not buy ; the public will not read . Let them sleep at the foot of the ladder of the angels , - we climb it all the same . And then one settles down into such good - tempered Lucianic contempt for men . One wants so little from them , when one knows what one 's self is worth , and what they are . They are just worth the coin one can extract from them , in order to live .
207590	207784	207387	207387	he	1026	" Our life - that is worth so much to us . And then their joys , so vulgar to them , we can make them golden and kingly . Do you suppose Burns drinking at the alehouse , with his boors around him , was drinking , like them , only beer and whiskey ? No , he was drinking nectar ; he was imbibing his own ambrosial thoughts , - shaking with the laughter of the gods . The coarse human liquid was just needed to unlock his spirit from the clay , - take it from jerkin and corduroys , and wrap it in the ' singing robes ' that floated wide in the skies : the beer or the whiskey needed but for that , and then it changed at once into the drink of Hebe . But come , you have not known this life , - you have not seen it . Come , give me this night . I have moneys about me , - I will fling them abroad as liberally as Alexander himself , when he left to his share but hope . Come ! "
207785	207788	207325	207325	he	1026	" Whither ? "
207789	207861	207869	207869	Leonard	450	" To my throne . On that throne last sat Edmund Kean , mighty mime ! I am his successor . We will see whether in truth these wild sons of genius , who are cited but ' to point a moral and adorn a tale , ' were objects of compassion . Sober - suited tits to lament over a Savage or a Morland , a Porson and a Burns ! "
207862	207867	207325	207325	he	1026	" Or a Chatterton , "
207873	207909	208012	208012	Woodward	1032	" Chatterton was an impostor in all things ; he feigned excesses that he never knew . He a bacchanalian , a royster ! HE ! No . We will talk of him . Come ! "

208166	208402	208791	208792	John Burley	1026	" verily there is something in the sight that moves an inner sense within ourselves , - for all of us have an inner sense of some existence , apart from the one that wears away our days : an existence that , afar from St. James 's and St. Giles 's , the Law Courts and Exchange , goes its way in terror or mirth , in smiles or in tears , through a vague magic - land of the poets . There , see those actors - they are the men who lived it - to whom our world was the false one , to whom the Imaginary was the Actual ! And did Shakspeare himself , in his life , ever hearken to such applause as thundered round the personators of his airy images ? Vague children of the most transient of the arts , fleet shadows on running waters , though thrown down from the steadfast stars , were ye not happier than we who live in the Real ? How strange you must feel in the great circuit that ye now take through eternity ! No prompt - books , no lamps , no acting Congreve and Shakspeare there ! For what parts in the skies have your studies on the earth fitted you ? Your ultimate destinies are very puzzling . Hail to your effigies , and pass we on !

209312	209324	209745	209745	Leonard	450	" He is but of man 's common standard after all ! "
209738	209743	209745	209745	Leonard	450	" Nature , Nature ! "
209747	209790	210198	210198	Leonard	450	" I hear thy voice now . This stills , this strengthens . But the struggle is very dread . Here , despair of life , - there , faith in life . Nature thinks of neither , and lives serenely on . "
210183	210196	211118	211118	he	1026	" And what is Mr. Burley , and what has he written ? "
211056	211064	211118	211118	he	1026	" My crust of bread and liberty ! "
211108	211117	212455	212457	the young man	5338	" He could not do task - work , "
212432	212454	212455	212457	the young man	5338	" Well , I should think Burley would cure you of the desire to be an author even more than Chatterton , "
212461	212464	212720	212720	She	894	" Perhaps , "
212714	212719	212709	212709	She	894	" You are changed . "
212723	212732	212787	212787	Helen	894	" Why , why did I leave you ? "
212738	212766	212842	212842	she	894	" Never mind me , Helen . I am man , and rudely born ; speak of yourself . This lady is kind to you , then ? "
212767	212786	212787	212787	Helen	894	" Does she not let me see you ? Oh , very kind , - and look here . "
212799	212805	212922	212922	he	7567	" A feast , brother . "
212967	212988	212922	212922	he	7567	" Oh , brother , do not go there again , - do not see more of this bad man . "
212989	213019	212922	212922	he	7567	" Bad ! - no ! Hopeless and unhappy , he has stooped to stimulants and oblivion - but you can not understand these things , my pretty preacher . "
213020	213051	213160	213160	he	450	" Yes , I do , Leonard . What is the difference between being good and bad ? The good do not yield to temptations , and the bad do . "
213081	213124	213182	213182	he	450	" I have often murmured to myself since I lost you , ' Helen was my good angel ; ' - say on . For my heart is dark to myself , and while you speak light seems to dawn on it . "
213178	213181	213182	213182	he	450	" Well , "
213191	213220	213230	213230	Helen	894	" how can I hope , when this mighty genius laboured and despaired ? What did he want , save birth and fortune and friends and human justice ? "
213221	213228	213270	213270	Helen	894	" Did he pray to God ? "
213280	213289	213308	213309	the child	16356	" Why do you ask that , Helen ? "
213290	213306	213308	213309	the child	16356	" Because , when we pray often , we grow so very , very patient , "
213311	213350	213484	213484	Leonard	450	" Perhaps , had he been patient a few months more , all would have been won by him , as it will be by you , brother , for you pray , and you will be patient . "
213477	213482	213487	213487	his	450	" Oh , Helen ! "
213497	213507	213587	213587	he	450	" why , indeed , did you leave me ? "
213605	213642	213677	213677	Leonard	450	" No ; let it be sent to you . Take care of it . I should like to know that something of mine is with you ; and perhaps I may not stay here long . "
213643	213675	213677	213677	Leonard	450	" Not stay here ? That you must , my dear Helen , - at least as long as Miss Starke will keep you , and is kind . By and by "
213686	213743	213682	213682	his	450	" I may yet make my way , and we shall have our cottage to ourselves . But - oh , Helen ! - I forgot - you wounded me ; you left your money with me . I only found it in my drawers the other day . Fie ! I have brought it back . "
213744	213776	213799	213802	a tall female figure	7578	" It was not mine , - it is yours . We were to share together , - you paid all ; and how can I want it here , too ? "
213825	213835	213844	213844	Helen	894	" Young man , it is time to go . "
213839	213842	213876	213876	he	450	" Already ? "
213864	213874	213876	213876	he	450	" I am very grateful to you , madam , "
213889	213906	213999	213999	Helen	894	" for allowing me to see Miss Helen . Do not let me abuse your kindness . "
213987	213997	213999	213999	Helen	894	" May I go with him to the gate ? "
214010	214041	214042	214042	Helen	894	" You may , child ; but do not loiter . And then come back , and lock up the cakes and cherries , or Patty will get at them . "
214047	214081	214102	214102	Leonard	450	" Write to me , brother , - write to me ; and do not , do not be friends with this man , who took you to that wicked , wicked place . "
214082	214100	214168	214170	the young man	5338	" Oh , Helen , I go from you strong enough to brave worse dangers than that , "
214161	214166	214172	214172	He	450	" Nature ever restores , "
214180	214189	214292	214292	Roland	444	" Is it that Nature is very patient ? "
214283	214288	214326	214326	he	444	" What is courage ? "
214320	214325	214326	214326	he	444	" What is courage ? "
214331	214365	214379	214380	Mr. Caxton	409	" Is it insensibility to fear ? That may be the mere accident of constitution ; and if so , there is no more merit in being courageous than in being this table . "
214366	214377	214379	214380	Mr. Caxton	409	" I am very glad to hear you speak thus , "
214382	214409	214423	214424	my mother	1473	" for I should not like to consider myself a coward ; yet I am very sensible to fear in all dangers , bodily and moral . "
214410	214421	214423	214424	my mother	1473	" La , Austin , how can you say so ? "
214429	214451	214474	214476	MR . CAXTON	409	" was it not only last week that you faced the great bull that was rushing after Blanche and the children ? "
214484	214504	214505	214505	ROLAND	444	" I do n't deny that I faced the bull , but I assert that I was horribly frightened . "
214508	214539	214540	214542	MR . CAXTON	409	" The sense of honour which conquers fear is the true courage of chivalry : you could not run away when others were looking on , - no gentleman could . "
214545	214605	214606	214606	BLANCHE	411	" Fiddledee ! It was not on my gentility that I stood , Captain . I should have run fast enough , if it had done any good . I stood upon my understanding . As the bull could run faster than I could , the only chance of escape was to make the brute as frightened as myself . "
214609	214630	214790	214791	Mr. Caxton	409	" Ah , you did not think of that ; your only thought was to save me and the children . "
214636	214788	214790	214791	Mr. Caxton	409	" Possibly , my dear , very possibly , I might have been afraid for you too ; but I was very much afraid for myself . However , luckily I had the umbrella , and I sprang it up and spread it forth in the animal 's stupid eyes , hurling at him simultaneously the biggest lines I could think of in the First Chorus of the ' Seven against Thebes . ' I began with ELEDEMNAS PEDIOPLOKTUPOS ; and when I came to the grand howl of A line in Greek , the beast stood appalled as at the roar of a lion . I shall never forget his amazed snort at the Greek . Then he kicked up his hind legs , and went bolt through the gap in the hedge . Thus , armed with AEschylus and the umbrella , I remained master of the field ; but "
214793	214807	214815	214816	the captain	2114	" I should not like to go through that half - minute again . "
214808	214813	214815	214816	the captain	2114	" No man would , "
214820	214858	214859	214861	MR . CAXTON	409	" I should be very sorry to face a bull myself , even with a bigger umbrella than yours , and even though I had AEschylus , and Homer to boot , at my fingers ' ends . "
214864	214883	214899	214899	he	2114	" You would not have minded if it had been a Frenchman with a sword in his hand ? "
214887	214898	214903	214905	MR . CAXTON	409	" Of course not . Rather liked it than otherwise , "
214908	215028	215090	215091	my uncle	1493	" Yet many a Spanish matador , who does n't care a button for a bull , would take to his heels at the first lunge en carte from a Frenchman . Therefore , in fact , if courage be a matter of constitution , it is also a matter of custom . We face calmly the dangers we are habituated to , and recoil from those of which we have no familiar experience . I doubt if Marshal Turenue himself would have been quite at his ease on the tight - rope ; and a rope - dancer , who seems disposed to scale the heavens with Titanic temerity , might possibly object to charge on a cannon . "
215033	215088	215090	215091	my uncle	1493	" Still , either this is not the courage I mean , or it is another kind of it . I mean by courage that which is the especial force and dignity of the human character , without which there is no reliance on principle , no constancy in virtue , - a something , "
215104	215204	215213	215214	my father	1479	" which your sex shares with our own . When the lover , for instance , clasps the hand of his betrothed , and says , ' Wilt thou be true to me , in spite of absence and time , in spite of hazard and fortune , though my foes malign me , though thy friends may dissuade thee , and our lot in life may be rough and rude ? ' and when the betrothed answers , ' I will be true , ' does not the lover trust to her courage as well as her love ? "
215205	215211	215213	215214	my father	1479	" Admirably put , Roland , "
215216	215232	215233	215234	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" But a propos of what do you puzzle us with these queries on courage ? "
215241	215383	215384	215386	MR . CAXTON	409	" I was led to the inquiry though perhaps it may be frivolous to take so much thought of what , no doubt , costs Pisistratus so little by the last chapters in my nephew 's story . I see this poor boy Leonard , alone with his fallen hopes though very irrational they were and his sense of shame . And I read his heart , I dare say , better than Pisistratus does , for I could feel like that boy if I had been in the same position ; and conjecturing what he and thousands like him must go through , I asked myself , ' What can save him and them ? ' I answered , as a soldier would answer , ' Courage . ' Very well . But pray ; Austin , what is courage ? "
215395	215421	215422	215422	Blanche	411	" Papae ! ' Brother , since you have just complimented the ladies on that quality , you had better address your question to them . "
215449	215530	215531	215531	PISISTRATUS	420	" Do you not think , sir , that little Helen has already suggested , if not what is courage , what at least is the real essence of all courage that endures and conquers , that ennobles and hallows and redeems ? Is it not PATIENCE , Father ? And that is why we women have a courage of our own . Patience does not affect to be superior to fear , but at least it never admits despair . "
215534	215558	215559	215561	MR . CAXTON	409	" Kiss me , my Blanche , for you have come near to the truth which perplexed the soldier and puzzled the sage . "
215565	215605	215559	215561	MR . CAXTON	409	" If you mean me by the sage , I was not puzzled at all . Heaven knows you do right to inculcate patience , - it is a virtue very much required - in your readers . Nevertheless , "
215619	215806	215807	215808	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" nevertheless Blanche and Helen are quite right . Patience is the courage of the conqueror ; it is the virtue , par excellence , of Man against Destiny , - of the One against the World , and of the Soul against Matter . Therefore this is the courage of the Gospel ; and its importance in a social view - its importance to races and institutions - can not be too earnestly inculcated . What is it that distinguishes the Anglo - Saxon from all other branches of the human family , - peoples deserts with his children and consigns to them the heritage of rising worlds ? What but his faculty to brave , to suffer , to endure , - the patience that resists firmly and innovates slowly ? Compare him with the Frenchman . The Frenchman has plenty of valour , - that there is no denying ; but as for fortitude , he has not enough to cover the point of a pin . He is ready to rush out of the world if he is bitten by a flea . "
215811	215870	215871	215873	MR . CAXTON	409	" There was a case in the papers the other day , Austin , of a Frenchman who actually did destroy himself because he was so teased by the little creatures you speak of . He left a paper on his table , saying that ' life was not worth having at the price of such torments . ' "
215877	216054	215871	215873	MR . CAXTON	409	" Sir , their whole political history , since the great meeting of the Tiers Etat , has been the history of men who would rather go to the devil than be bitten by a flea . It is the record of human impatience that seeks to force time , and expects to grow forests from the spawn of a mushroom . Wherefore , running through all extremes of constitutional experiment , when they are nearest to democracy they are next door to a despot ; and all they have really done is to destroy whatever constitutes the foundation of every tolerable government . A constitutional monarchy can not exist without aristocracy , nor a healthful republic endure with corruption of manners . The cry of equality is incompatible with civilization , which , of necessity , contrasts poverty with wealth ; and , in short , whether it be an emperor or a mob I that is to rule , Force is the sole hope of order , and the government is but an army . "
216071	216187	216825	216827	a strange person	18768	" Impress , O Pisistratus ! impress the value of patience as regards man and men . You touch there on the kernel of the social system , - the secret that fortifies the individual and disciplines the million . I care not , for my part , if you are tedious so long as you are earnest . Be minute and detailed . Let the real Human Life , in its war with Circumstance , stand out . Never mind if one can read you but slowly , - better chance of being less quickly forgotten . Patience , patience ! By the soul of Epictetus , your readers shall set you an example . "
216856	216878	216882	216891	a very grave - looking man , with lank hair	7633	" Young man , Mr. Prickett senior is gone to his long home , but Mr. Richard Prickett will see you . "
216913	216933	216882	216891	a very grave - looking man , with lank hair	7633	" Come in , sir ; you are my late uncle 's assistant , Mr. Fairfield , I suppose ? "
216934	216958	216882	216891	a very grave - looking man , with lank hair	7633	" Your late uncle ! Heavens , sir , do I understand aright , can Mr. Prickett be dead since I left London ? "
216959	217013	217208	217208	Leonard	450	" Died , sir , suddenly , last night . It was an affection of the heart . The doctor thinks the rheumatism attacked that organ . He had small time to provide for his departure , and his account - books seem in sad disorder : I am his nephew and executor . "
217108	217207	217431	217432	the gentlemen	2178	" You were engaged but by the week , I find , young man , on reference to my late uncle 's papers . He gave you L1 a week , - a monstrous sum ! I shall not require your services any further . I shall move these books to my own house . You will be good enough to send me a list of those you bought at the sale , and your account of travelling expenses , etc . What may be due to you shall be sent to your address . Good - evening . "
217424	217427	217431	217432	the gentlemen	2178	" Look , "
217437	217479	217487	217488	the other	3531	" I have discovered here what I have searched for in vain the last ten years , - the Horace of 1580 , the Horace of the Forty Commentators , a perfect treasury of learning , and marked only fourteen shillings ! "
217480	217485	217503	217503	he	3531	" Hush , Norreys , "
217490	217501	217552	217553	Mr. Norreys	1064	" and observe what is yet more worth your study ; "
217541	217550	217555	217556	His companion	3429	" What is the book , my lord ? "
217565	217575	217606	217606	he	1064	" What is the man who reads the book ? "
217591	217605	217637	217639	a fourth passenger	7670	" Preston 's translation of Boethius 's ' The Consolations of Philosophy , ' "
217615	217633	217653	217653	his	7670	" He looks as if he wanted all the consolations Philosophy can give him , poor boy . "
217662	217736	217653	217653	his	7670	" Aha , young sir , we meet again . So poor Prickett is dead . But you are still haunted by associations . Books , books , - magnets to which all iron minds move insensibly . What is this ? Boethius ! Ah , a book written in prison , but a little time before the advent of the only philosopher who solves to the simplest understanding every mystery of life - "
217737	217742	217749	217750	Mr. Burley	998	" And that philosopher ? "
217743	217747	217749	217750	Mr. Burley	998	" Is death ! "
217752	217859	217865	217866	Mr. Norreys	1064	" How can you be dull enough to ask ? Poor Boethius , rich , nobly born , a consul , his sons consuls , the world one smile to the Last Philosopher of Rome . Then suddenly , against this type of the old world 's departing WISDOM stands frowning the new world 's grim genius , FORCE , - Theodoric the Ostrogoth condemning Boethius the schoolman ; and Boethius in his Pavian dungeon holding a dialogue with the shade of Athenian Philosophy . It is the finest picture upon which lingers the glimmering of the Western golden day , before night rushes over time . "
217860	217863	217865	217866	Mr. Norreys	1064	" And , "
217870	217937	218023	218024	Mr. Burley	998	" Boethius comes back to us with the faint gleam of returning light , translated by Alfred the Great ; and , again , as the sun of knowledge bursts forth in all its splendour by Queen Elizabeth . Boethius influences us as we stand in this passage ; and that is the best of all the Consolations of Philosophy , - eh , Mr. Burley ? "
218018	218021	218023	218024	Mr. Burley	998	" If , "
218026	218160	218185	218186	Harley L'Estrange	503	" a poor devil like me may argue with a gentleman who may command his own price with the booksellers , I should say it is no consolation at all , Mr. Norreys . And I should like to see any man of sense accept the condition of Boethius in his prison , with some strangler or headsman waiting behind the door , upon the promised proviso that he should be translated , centuries afterwards , by kings and queens , and help indirectly to influence the minds of Northern barbarians , babbling about him in an alley , jostled by passers - by who never heard the name of Boethius , and who do n't care a fig for philosophy . Your servant , sir , young man , come and talk . "
218176	218183	218185	218186	Harley L'Estrange	503	" That is a clever man , "
218188	218256	218305	218306	The shopman	7676	" But I am sorry to see yon young student , with his bright earnest eyes , and his lip that has the quiver of passion and enthusiasm , leaning on the arm of a guide who seems disenchanted of all that gives purpose to learning , and links philosophy with use to the world . Who and what is this clever man whom you call Burley ? "
218257	218304	218346	218346	he	7676	" A man who might have been famous , if he had condescended to be respectable ! The boy listening to us both so attentively interested me too , - I should like to have the making of him . But I must buy this Horace . "
218357	218392	218400	218401	Mr. Norreys	1064	" Only by sight . He has come here every day the last week , and spends hours at the stall . When once he fastens on a book , he reads it through . "
218393	218398	218408	218409	the shopman	7676	" And never buys ? "
218403	218406	218408	218409	the shopman	7676	" Sir , "
218418	218452	218467	218468	Mr. Norreys	1064	" they who buy seldom read . The poor boy pays me twopence a day to read as long as he pleases . I would not take it , but he is proud . "
218453	218465	218467	218468	Mr. Norreys	1064	" I have known men amass great learning in that way , "
218470	218507	218709	218709	Leonard	450	" Yes , I should like to have that boy in my hands . And now , my lord , I am at your service , and we will go to the studio of your artist . "
218713	218743	218689	218689	Burley	998	" Write what you please , in prose , five sheets of letter - paper , twenty - two lines to a page , - neither more nor less . "
218744	218751	218709	218709	Leonard	450	" I can not write so . "
218752	218761	218776	218776	he	14972	" Tut , ' t is for bread . "
218768	218774	218795	218795	Burley	998	" I must forget that , "
218778	218793	218795	218795	Burley	998	" There is an arbour in the garden , under a weeping - ash , "
218797	218807	219085	219085	he	998	" Go there , and fancy yourself in Arcadia . "
219078	219083	219085	219085	he	998	" You will do ! "
219093	219106	219166	219166	his	998	" Perhaps some day you will catch my one - eyed perch . "
219148	219156	219509	219512	An author for bread	7715	" Office of the ' Beehive , ' "
219500	219508	219509	219512	An author for bread	7715	" A fig for immortality and laurels ! "

219581	219584	219670	219671	John Burley	1026	" Beehive . "
219661	219668	219670	219671	John Burley	1026	" What more would you have ? "
219673	219689	219698	219698	Leonard	450	" Did not stern old Sam Johnson say he could never write but from want ? "
219690	219696	219742	219743	the boy	14972	" He might say it , "
219700	219740	219742	219743	the boy	14972	" but he never meant posterity to believe him . And he would have died of want , I suspect , rather than have written ' Rasselas ' for the ' Beehive ' ! Want is a grand thing , "
219748	219803	219924	219924	his	1026	" a parent of grand things . Necessity is strong , and should give us its own strength ; but Want should shatter asunder , with its very writhings , the walls of our prison - house , and not sit contented with the allowance the jail gives us in exchange for our work . "
219804	219853	219879	219880	the boy	14972	" There is no prison - house to a man who calls upon Bacchus ; stay , I will translate to you Schiller 's Dithyramb . ' Then see I Bacchus ; then up come Cupid and Phoebus , and all the Celestials are filling my dwelling . ' "
219873	219877	219879	219880	the boy	14972	" O materialist ! "
219888	219913	219921	219921	Burley	1026	" Schiller calls on the gods to take him to their heaven with them ; and you would debase the gods to a ginpalace . "
219914	219919	219924	219924	his	1026	" Ho , ho ! "
219928	219938	220019	220019	Burley	1026	" Drink , and you will understand the Dithyramb . "
220033	220060	220086	220086	Burley	1026	" Unless I am not mistaken , sir , we have met before . If you remember me , I hope all boyish quarrels are forgotten ? "
220075	220084	220101	220101	Randal	570	" Where could you two ever have met ? "
220088	220099	220137	220137	he	1026	" In a village green , and in single combat , "
220132	220135	220137	220137	he	1026	" But , "
220145	220176	220182	220182	Randal	570	" my young friend had better have remained guardian of the village stocks than come to London in search of such fortune as lies at the bottom of an inkhorn . "
220177	220180	220182	220182	Randal	570	" Ah , "
220205	220236	220250	220250	Leonard	450	" ah , you make literature your calling , sir ? At what school did you conceive a taste for letters ? Not very common at our great public schools . "
220237	220248	220263	220263	Burley	1026	" I am at school now for the first time , "
220254	220261	220263	220263	Burley	1026	" Experience is the best schoolmistress , "
220265	220285	220387	220387	Randal	570	" and that was the maxim of Goethe , who had book - learning enough , in all conscience . "
220376	220385	220387	220387	Randal	570	" I ca n't quite agree with you , "
220393	220412	220418	220418	Burley	1026	" but you must allow me to call again , - will the same hour tomorrow suit you ? "
220413	220416	220625	220625	he	570	" Yes , "
220631	220640	220697	220698	the boy	14972	" Mr. Burley , you have convinced me , "
220711	220719	220726	220726	Burley	998	" True ; knowledge is not power . "
220720	220724	220726	220726	Burley	998	" Certainly not , "
220731	220739	220747	220748	Randal Leslie	570	" the weakest thing in the world . "
220740	220745	220813	220813	Burley	998	" Knowledge is power , "
220824	220840	220878	220878	Leonard	450	" My own thoughts ! my very words ! Who the devil is this pamphleteer ? "
220869	220876	220878	220878	Leonard	450	" Can you doubt the author ? "
220887	220903	220910	220910	Burley	998	" The young man who came to steal your brains , and turn your knowledge - "
220904	220908	220910	220910	Burley	998	" Into power , "
220925	220942	220952	220952	Leonard	450	" Well , this was very mean ; I shall tell him so when he comes . "
220943	220950	220961	220961	he	570	" He will come no more , "
220985	220997	221940	221940	Leonard	450	" had profited much by Mr. Burley 's hints and remarks . "
221944	221956	222276	222276	she	894	" Ah , Helen , why did you ever leave me ? "
222279	222328	222376	222376	Helen	894	" I am sent away , brother , and I have come to you to take care of me . Do not let us part again . But you must be very cheerful and very happy , or I shall think that I am sadly in your way . "
222380	222396	222448	222448	Helen	894	" Impossible , - do not ask it , and do not go near her . "
222436	222446	222457	222457	Leonard	450	" Shall I keep the purse again , Leonard ? "
222452	222455	222457	222457	Leonard	450	" Alas ! "
222459	222465	222477	222477	Helen	894	" the purse is empty . "
222466	222475	222477	222477	Helen	894	" That is very naughty in the purse , "
222488	222488	222457	222457	Leonard	450	"
222489	222506	222477	222477	Helen	894	" Did not you say that you made , at least , a guinea a week ? "
222507	222543	222564	222564	herself	6222	" Yes ; but Burley takes the money ; and then , poor fellow ! as I owe all to him , I have not the heart to prevent him spending it as he likes . "
222544	222557	222575	222575	Leonard	450	" Please , I wish you could settle the month 's rent , "
222578	222587	222619	222619	Helen	894	" It shall be paid to - day . "
222606	222617	222619	222619	Helen	894	" Speak to me in future , kind Mrs. Smedley , "
222628	222641	222658	222658	She	6222	" He is always in study , and must not be disturbed . "
222671	222703	222727	222727	Helen	894	" I am so glad you are come back ; and perhaps now the young man will not keep such late hours . I meant to give him warning , but - "
222704	222725	222841	222841	she	894	" But he will be a great man one of these days , and you must bear with him now . "
222836	222840	223512	223512	he	1026	" Dear Leonard ! "
223498	223510	223516	223516	he	1026	" So you are the Pentheus in petticoats who defies Bacchus , "
223532	223538	223546	223547	Mr. Douce	1077	" For shame , Burley ! "
223539	223544	223546	223547	Mr. Douce	1077	" He 's drunk , "
223553	223607	223894	223894	he	1026	" very drunk ; do n't mind him . I say , sir , I hope we do n't intrude . Sit still , Burley , sit still , and talk , do , - that 's a good man . You should hear him - ta - ta - talk , sir . "
223889	223892	223894	223894	he	1026	" Helen , "
223899	223999	224197	224197	BURLEY	1026	" you can not continue here . I must find out some proper home for you . This man has served me when all London was friendless , and he tells me that he has nowhere else to go , - that the bailiffs are after him . He has now fallen asleep . I will go and find you some lodging close at hand , for I can not expel him who has protected me ; and yet you can not be under the same roof with him . My own good angel , I must lose you . "
224208	224311	224312	224312	HELEN	894	" Come hither , my dear . So you are the little girl whom I saw with Leonard on the banks of the Brent , and you have come back to live with him , - and I have come to live with him too . You shall be our little housekeeper , and I will tell you the story of Prince Pettyman , and a great many others not to be found in ' Mother Goose . ' Meanwhile , my dear little girl , here 's sixpence , - just run out and change this for its worth in rum . "
224329	224377	224378	224378	BURLEY	998	" Ah , sir , Leonard says you have a kind heart , and that you have served him ; he can not ask you to leave the house ; and so I , who have never served him , am to go hence and live alone . "
224382	224400	224401	224401	HELEN	894	" You go , my little lady ; and why ? Can we not all live together ? "
224404	224444	224445	224445	BURLEY	998	" No , sir . I left everything to come to Leonard , for we had met first at my father 's grave ; but you rob me of him , and I have no other friend on earth . "
224449	224462	224479	224479	BURLEY	998	" Explain yourself . Why must you leave him because I come ? "
224485	224499	224505	224505	Burley	998	" Is it because he thinks I am not fit company for you ? "
224516	224521	224545	224545	she	894	" He is right . "
224539	224544	224545	224545	she	894	" Ah , sir , "
224548	224706	224737	224737	he	998	" before he knew you he was so different ; then he was cheerful , then , even when his first disappointment came , I grieved and wept but I felt he would conquer still , for his heart was so good and pure . Oh , sir , do n't think I reproach you ; but what is to become of him if - if - No , it is not for myself I speak . I know that if I was here , that if he had me to care for , he would come home early , and work patiently , and - and - that I might save him . But now when I am gone , and you live with him , - you to whom he is grateful , you whom he would follow against his own conscience you must see that , sir , what is to become of him ? "
224730	224736	224737	224737	he	998	" I am a demon , "
224740	224760	224784	224784	Helen	894	" I never saw it before ; but it is true , I should be this boy 's ruin . "
224799	224813	224886	224886	he	998	" Oh , sir , forgive me , - I have pained you ; "
224868	224885	224886	224886	he	998	" If I had had a sister , - a child like you , little one , "
224889	224902	224838	224838	Burley	998	" perhaps I too might have been saved in time . Now - "
224903	224921	224998	224998	He	998	" Ah , now you may stay , sir ; I do n't fear you any more . "
224922	224997	225093	225093	he	450	" No , no ; you would fear me again ere night - time , and I might not be always in the right mood to listen to a voice like yours , child . Your Leonard has a noble heart and rare gifts . He should rise yet , and he shall . I will not drag him into the mire . Good - by , - you will see me no more . "
225112	225114	225175	225175	she	1075	" Beehive "
225162	225173	225175	225175	she	1075	" Please , sir , suit yourself with another lodging , "
225177	225209	225411	225411	she	7833	" I can have no such singings and shoutings going on at night in my house . And that poor little girl , too ! you should be ashamed of yourself . "
225403	225409	225411	225411	she	7833	" Ah , Master John , "
225418	225458	225472	225472	Burley	998	" well , the fields be pleasant now ; I hope you are come to stay a bit ? Do ; it will freshen you ; you lose all the fine colour you had once , in Lunnon town . "
225459	225470	225472	225472	Burley	998	" I will stay with you , my kind friend , "
225478	225488	225548	225550	the old woman	2774	" I can have the old room , then ? "
225489	225539	225635	225636	the hostess	6000	" Oh , yes , come and look at it . I never let it now to any one but you , - never have let it since the dear beautiful lady with the angel 's face went away . Poor thing , what could have become of her ? "
225627	225633	225689	225689	Burley	998	" You have not breakfasted ? "
225640	225643	225689	225689	Burley	998	" No . "
225644	225688	225689	225689	Burley	998	" Well , the eggs are fresh laid , and you would like a rasher of bacon , Master John ? And if you will have brandy in your tea , I have some that you left long ago in your own bottle . "
225694	225715	225729	225729	she	1080	" No brandy , Mrs. Goodyer ; only fresh milk . I will see whether I can yet coax Nature . "
225732	225739	225830	225830	He	998	" Pray do , Master John , "
225835	225846	225936	225937	John Burley	1026	" Tell your husband to come and sit and talk . "
225924	225933	225936	225937	John Burley	1026	" Have you no books , Mrs. Goodyer ? "
225939	225968	225936	225937	John Burley	1026	" Oh , yes , some that the dear lady left behind her ; and perhaps you would like to look at some papers in her own writing ? "
225969	225993	226040	226040	he	998	" No , not the papers , - all women scribble , and all scribble the same things . Get me the books . "
226034	226039	226040	226040	he	998	" Nature , Nature ! "
226057	226122	226254	226255	John Burley	1026	" you are not to be coaxed by me ! I have jilted you shamefully , I own it ; you are a female , and unforgiving . I do n't complain . You may be very pretty , but you are the stupidest and most tire some companion that ever I met with . Thank Heaven , I am not married to you ! "

226308	226313	226315	226316	John Burley	1026	" At whose suit ? "
226320	226329	226254	226255	John Burley	1026	" Mr. Cox , the wine - merchant . "
226330	226349	226315	226316	John Burley	1026	" Cox ! A man to whom I gave a check on my bankers not three months ago ! "
226350	226357	226254	226255	John Burley	1026	" But it war n't cashed . "
226358	226394	226315	226316	John Burley	1026	" What does that signify ? - the intention was the same . A good heart takes the will for the deed . Cox is a monster of ingratitude , and I withdraw my custom . "
226395	226407	226421	226422	John Burley	1026	" Sarve him right . Would your honour like a jarvey ? "
226408	226419	226421	226422	John Burley	1026	" I would rather spend the money on something else , "
226424	226449	227010	227010	she	1015	" Give me your arm , I am not proud . After all , thank Heaven , I shall not sleep in the country . "

228103	228132	228238	228238	He	450	" It has come back then to this , - brute physical force after all ! O Mind , despair ! O Peasant , be a machine again ! "
228250	228271	228303	228303	Leonard	450	" Helen , put on your shawl and bonnet , and walk out , - I have much to say . "
228307	228314	228303	228303	Leonard	450	" Helen , we must part ! "
228315	228323	228303	228303	Leonard	450	" Part ? - Oh , brother ! "
228324	228517	228518	228518	Helen	894	" Listen . All work that depends on mind is over for me , nothing remains but the labour of thews and sinews . I can not go back to my village and say to all , ' My hopes were self - conceit , and my intellect a delusion ! ' I can not . Neither in this sordid city can I turn menial or porter . I might be born to that drudgery , but my mind has , it may be unhappily , raised me above my birth . What , then , shall I do ? I know not yet , - serve as a soldier , or push my way to some wilderness afar , as an emigrant , perhaps . But whatever my choice , I must henceforth be alone ; I have a home no more . But there is a home for you , Helen , a very humble one for you too , so well born , but very safe , - the roof of - of - my peasant mother . She will love you for my sake , and - and - "
228528	228581	228303	228303	Leonard	450	" Anything , anything you will . But I can work ; I can make money , Leonard . I do , indeed , make money , - you do not know how much , but enough for us both till better times come to you . Do not let us part . "
228582	228614	228619	228619	she	894	" And I - a man , and born to labour - to be maintained by the work of an infant ! No , Helen , do not so degrade me . "
228634	228637	228643	228643	Helen	894	" Pardon . "
228638	228641	228643	228643	Helen	894	" Ah , "
228649	228671	228627	228627	her	894	" if now we could but find my poor father 's friend ! I never so much cared for it before . "
228672	228682	228689	228689	Helen	894	" Yes , he would surely provide for you . "
228683	228687	228627	228627	her	894	" For me ! "
228711	228727	228627	228627	her	894	" You are sure you would remember him , if we met him by chance ? "
228728	228807	228627	228627	her	894	" Oh , yes . He was so different from all we see in this terrible city , and his eyes were like yonder stars , so clear and so bright ; yet the light seemed to come from afar off , as the light does in yours , when your thoughts are away from all things round you . And then , too , his dog , whom he called Nero - I could not forget that . "
228808	228819	228627	228627	her	894	" But his dog may not be always with him . "
228820	228845	229048	229048	He	450	" But the bright clear eyes are ! Ah , now you look up to heaven , and yours seem to dream like his . "
228991	229012	229223	229223	Helen	894	" Struggle no more against the tides on the surface , - all is calm and rest within the deep . "
229216	229221	229223	229223	Helen	894	" And , oh ! "
229225	229241	229247	229248	the boy	14972	" if life be thus happy there , return with me , return ! return ! "
229242	229245	229247	229248	the boy	14972	" Alas ! "
229250	229293	229516	229516	he	450	" if the hammer once strike the spark from the anvil , the spark must fly upward ; it can not fall back to earth until light has left it . Upward still , Helen , - let me go upward still ! "
229525	229545	229830	229830	you	7964	" Give me my work ; I am strong enough for that now , - it would amuse me . "
229835	229849	229899	229899	Violante	800	" This , which he thinks is degradation , - this is heroism . "

230148	230162	230164	230165	a member	7981	" How are you , Randal Leslie ? coming to hear the debate ? "
230174	230221	230365	230366	The member	7983	" Yes ; Mr. Egerton promised to get me under the gallery . He is to speak himself to - night , and I have never heard him . As you are going into the House , will you remind him of his promise to me ? "
230222	230269	230278	230278	Randal	570	" I ca n't now , for he is speaking already , - and well too . I hurried from the Athenaeum , where I was dining , on purpose to be in time , as I heard that his speech was making a great effect . "
230270	230276	230278	230278	Randal	570	" This is very unlucky , "
230280	230291	230365	230366	The member	7983	" I had no idea he would speak so early . "
230292	230364	230378	230379	a bystander	7984	" C - - - brought him up by a direct personal attack . But follow me ; perhaps I can get you into the House ; and a man like you , Leslie , from whom we expect great things some day , I can tell you , should not miss any such opportunity of knowing what this House of ours is on a field - night . Come on ! "
230382	230399	230407	230407	another	15587	" That is the young man who wrote the famous pamphlet , - Egerton 's relation . "
230400	230405	230407	230407	another	15587	" Oh , indeed ! "
230409	230422	230378	230379	a bystander	7984	" Clever man , Egerton , - I am waiting for him . "
230423	230427	230407	230407	another	15587	" So am I. "
230428	230441	230378	230379	a bystander	7984	" Why , you are not a constituent , as I am . "
230442	230474	230407	230407	another	15587	" No ; but he has been very kind to my nephew , and I must thank him . You are a constituent - he is an honour to your town . "
230475	230483	230378	230379	a bystander	7984	" So he is : enlightened man ! "
230484	230489	230407	230407	another	15587	" And so generous ! "
230490	230497	230510	230511	the uncle	18124	" Brings forward really good measures , "
230502	230508	230748	230748	he	500	" And clever young men , "

230752	230778	230822	230823	the statesman	3214	" he is always punctual ; and now that I have spoken , I can give him an hour or so . That is well . "
230814	230820	230840	230842	the young man	5338	" Do you want me ? "
230834	230838	230840	230842	the young man	5338	" Mr. Egerton , "
230857	230958	231100	231100	He	500	" you have a great name , and great power ; I stand here in these streets of London without a friend , and without employment . I believe that I have it in me to do some nobler work than that of bodily labour , had I but one friend , - one opening for my thoughts . And now I have said this , I scarcely know how , or why , but from despair , and the sudden impulse which that despair took from the praise that follows your success , I have nothing more to add . "
231009	231016	231100	231100	He	500	" Are you a native of ? "
231025	231030	231100	231100	He	500	" No , sir . "
231031	231099	231202	231203	the minister	2115	" Well , young man , I am very sorry for you ; but the good sense you must possess for I judge of that by the education you have evidently received must tell you that a public man , whatever be his patronage , has it too fully absorbed by claimants who have a right to demand it , to be able to listen to strangers . "
231125	231199	231237	231237	he	500	" You say you are friendless , - poor fellow ! In early life that happens to many of us , who find friends enough before the close . Be honest , and well - conducted : lean on yourself , not on strangers ; work with the body if you ca n't with the mind ; and , believe me , that advice is all I can give you , unless this trifle "
231232	231235	231237	231237	he	500	" Pooh ! "
231241	231325	231486	231486	he	6684	" there must be thousands in the same state in these streets of London . I can not redress the necessities of civilization . Well educated ! It is not from ignorance henceforth that society will suffer , - it is from over - educating the hungry thousands who , thus unfitted for manual toil , and with no career for mental , will some day or other stand like that boy in our streets , and puzzle wiser ministers than I am . "
231475	231484	231556	231556	he	6684	" Le jeu vaut - il la chandelle ? "
231547	231554	232735	232735	You	14942	" Life is a dark riddle , "
232718	232734	233267	233267	you	8075	" One does not know when one is well off till one has known misfortune . "
233277	233323	233637	233637	Harley	503	" I will escape from this prison - house of memory ; I will form new ties , like other men , and before it be too late ; I will marry . Ay , but I must love , - there is the difficulty . "
233629	233635	233646	233646	he	503	" Is he really happy ? "
233656	233705	233848	233850	A true physiologist	8096	" This life in a village , this wife in a lady who puts down her work to talk about villagers - what a contrast to Audley 's full existence ! And I can not envy nor comprehend either ! yet my own existence - what is it ? "
233857	233891	233897	233898	the lady	2294	" There are intellect and pride in that hand , which seems to fix a hold where it rests ; and lying so lightly , yet will not be as lightly shaken off . "
233892	233895	233915	233915	she	2294	" Harley , "
233904	233914	233915	233915	she	2294	" you do not deceive me by that smile , "
233919	233928	233848	233850	A true physiologist	8096	" you were not smiling when I entered . "
233929	233960	233967	233968	Lady Lansmere	822	" It is rarely that we smile to ourselves , my dear mother ; and I have done nothing lately so foolish as to cause me to smile at myself . "
233961	233965	233967	233968	Lady Lansmere	822	" My son , "
233978	234029	234035	234036	the soldier	15059	" you come from a line of illustrious ancestors ; and methinks they ask from their tombs why the last of their race has no aim and no object , no interest , no home , in the land which they served , and which rewarded them with its honours . "
234030	234033	234035	234036	the soldier	15059	" Mother , "
234040	234067	233967	233968	Lady Lansmere	822	" when the land was in danger I served it as my forefathers served , - and my answer would be the scars on my breast . "
234068	234127	234035	234036	the soldier	15059	" Is it only in danger that a country is served , only in war that duty is fulfilled ? Do you think that your father , in his plain , manly life of country gentleman , does not fulfil , though perhaps too obscurely , the objects for which aristocracy is created , and wealth is bestowed ? "
234128	234145	233967	233968	Lady Lansmere	822	" Doubtless he does , ma'am , - and better than his vagrant son ever can . "
234146	234176	234182	234182	Harley	503	" Yet his vagrant son has received such gifts from nature , his youth was so rich in promise , his boyhood so glowed at the dream of glory ! "
234177	234180	234182	234182	Harley	503	" Ay , "
234187	234203	234426	234426	she	822	" it is possible , - and all to be buried in a single grave ! "
234420	234425	234426	234426	she	822	" A single grave , "
234434	234484	234491	234491	Harley	503	" And you were then but a boy , Harley ! Can such a memory influence you even to this day ? It is scarcely possible : it does not seem to me within the realities of man 's life , - though it might be of woman 's . "
234485	234489	234539	234539	he	503	" I believe , "
234496	234538	234539	234539	he	503	" that I have a great deal of the woman in me . Perhaps men who live much alone , and care not for men 's objects , do grow tenacious of impressions , as your sex does . But oh , "
234552	234688	234701	234702	the countess	8099	" oh , the hardest and the coldest man would have felt as I do , had he known HER , had he loved HER . She was like no other woman I have ever met . Bright and glorious creature of another sphere ! She descended on this earth and darkened it when she passed away . It is no use striving . Mother , I have as much courage as our steel - clad fathers ever had . I have dared in battle and in deserts , against man and the wild beast , against the storm and the ocean , against the rude powers of Nature , - dangers as dread as ever pilgrim or Crusader rejoiced to brave . But courage against that one memory ! no , I have none ! "
234689	234699	234721	234721	his	2078	" Harley , Harley , you break my heart ! "
234708	234713	234721	234721	his	2078	" It is astonishing , "
234735	234837	235026	235026	his	504	" Yea , verily , it is astonishing , that considering the thousands of women I have seen and spoken with , I never see a face like hers , - never hear a voice so sweet . And all this universe of life can not afford me one look and one tone that can restore me to man 's privilege , - love . Well , well , well , life has other things yet ; Poetry and Art live still ; still smiles the heaven and still wave the trees . Leave me to happiness in my own way . "
235011	235020	235026	235026	his	504	" Ho , ho ! my dear Harley , "
235035	235047	235026	235026	his	504	" I have just been paying a visit to the duchess . "
235048	235056	235026	235026	his	504	" What duchess , my dear father ? "
235057	235100	235117	235117	Harley	503	" Why , your mother 's first cousin , to be sure , - the Duchess of Knaresborough , whom , to oblige me , you condescended to call upon ; and delighted I am to hear that you admire Lady Mary - "
235101	235115	235133	235133	he	503	" She is very high bred , and rather - high - nosed , "
235137	235142	235150	235151	the earl	2072	" But handsome certainly . "
235143	235148	235150	235151	the earl	2072	" Well , Harley , "
235156	235220	235241	235242	Lady Lansmere	822	" the duchess , taking advantage of our connection to speak freely , has intimated to me that Lady Mary has been no less struck with yourself ; and to come to the point , since you allow that it is time you should think of marrying , I do not know a more desirable alliance . What do you say , Katherine ? "
235221	235239	235241	235242	Lady Lansmere	822	" The duke is of a family that ranks in history before the Wars of the Roses , "
235253	235301	235314	235315	the earl	2072	" and there has never been one scandal in its annals , nor one blot on its scutcheon . But I am sure my dear Lord must think that the duchess should not have made the first overture , - even to a friend and a kinsman ? "
235302	235312	235314	235315	the earl	2072	" Why , we are old - fashioned people , "
235320	235331	235339	235340	the countess	8099	" and the duchess is a woman of the world . "
235332	235337	235339	235340	the countess	8099	" Let us hope , "
235344	235351	235375	235376	Lord L'Estrange	502	" that her daughter is not . "
235352	235373	235388	235389	the earl	2072	" I would not marry Lady Mary , if all the rest of the female sex were turned into apes , "
235382	235386	235388	235389	the earl	2072	" Good heavens ! "
235391	235404	235405	235405	HARLEY	503	" what extraordinary language is this ? And pray why , sir ? "
235408	235436	235437	235438	LORD LANSMERE	504	" I ca n't say ; there is no why in these cases . But , my dear father , you are not keeping faith with me . "
235441	235444	235445	235445	HARLEY	503	" HOW ? "
235448	235608	235609	235610	LADY LANSMERE	822	" You and my Lady , here , entreat me to marry ; I promise to do my best to obey you , but on one condition , that I choose for myself , and take my time about it . Agreed on both sides . Whereon , off goes your Lordship - actually before noon , at an hour when no lady , without a shudder , could think of cold blonde and damp orange flowers - off goes your Lordship , I say , and commits poor Lady Mary and your unworthy son to a mutual admiration , - which neither of us ever felt . Pardon me , my father , but this is grave . Again let me claim your promise , - full choice for myself , and no reference to the Wars of the Roses . What War of the Roses like that between Modesty and Love upon the cheek of the virgin ! "
235613	235641	235642	235643	THE EARL	2072	" Full choice for yourself , Harley : so be it . But we , too , named a condition , - did we not , Lansmere ? "
235647	235657	235658	235658	HARLEY	503	" Eh , did we ? Certainly we did . "
235661	235666	235667	235668	LADY LANSMERE	822	" What was it ? "
235671	235686	235687	235688	THE EARL	2072	" The son of Lord Lansmere can only marry the daughter of a gentleman . "
235691	235698	235744	235744	he	503	" Of course , of course . "
235737	235742	235816	235816	his	503	" You were cruel , "
235821	236036	236046	236047	Lady Lansmere	822	" You have ever been most gracious to me , and most forbearing ; it is but just that I should sacrifice the habits of an egotist , to gratify a wish which you so warmly entertain . I agree with you , too , that our race should not close in me , - Noblesse oblige . But you know I was ever romantic ; and I must love where I marry ; or , if not love , I must feel that my wife is worthy of all the love I could once have bestowed . Now , as to the vague word ' gentleman ' that my mother employs - word that means so differently on different lips - I confess that I have a prejudice against young ladies brought up in the ' excellent foppery of the world , ' as the daughters of gentlemen of our rank mostly are . I crave , therefore , the most liberal interpretation of this word ' gentleman . ' And so long as there be nothing mean or sordid in the birth , habits , and education of the father of this bride to be , I trust you will both agree to demand nothing more , - neither titles nor pedigree . "
236037	236044	236046	236047	Lady Lansmere	822	" Titles , no , assuredly , "
236049	236056	236063	236064	the earl	2072	" they do not make gentlemen . "
236057	236061	236063	236064	the earl	2072	" Certainly not , "
236066	236075	236083	236084	Lady Lansmere	822	" many of our best families are untitled . "
236076	236081	236083	236084	Lady Lansmere	822	" Titles - no , "
236086	236091	236100	236100	Harley	503	" but ancestors yes . "
236092	236098	236100	236100	Harley	503	" Ah , my mother , "
236110	236170	236197	236198	the countess	8099	" it is fated that we shall never agree . The first of our race is ever the one we are most proud of ; and pray , what ancestors had he ? Beauty , virtue , modesty , intellect , - if these are not nobility enough for a man , he is a slave to the dead . "
236185	236195	236197	236198	the countess	8099	" You said yourself , ' Noblesse oblige , ' "
236206	236214	236257	236258	the earl	2072	" we have nothing more to add . "
236246	236255	236257	236258	the earl	2072	" Does he really go abroad next week ? "
236260	236265	236280	236281	Lord Lansmere	504	" So he says . "
236266	236278	236309	236311	the proud mother	8134	" I am afraid there is no chance for Lady Mary , "
236290	236307	236321	236322	the earl	2072	" She has not intellect enough to charm him . She is not worthy of Harley , "
236313	236319	236321	236322	the earl	2072	" Between you and me , "
236327	236380	236475	236476	The countess	8099	" I do n't see what good his intellect does him . He could not be more unsettled and useless if he were the merest dunce in the three kingdoms . And so ambitious as he was when a boy ! Katherine , I sometimes fancy that you know what changed him . "
236381	236440	236454	236455	the earl	2072	" I ! Nay , my dear Lord , it is a common change enough with the young , when of such fortunes , who find , when they enter life , that there is really little left for them to strive for . Had Harley been a poor man 's son , it might have been different . "
236441	236452	236454	236455	the earl	2072	" I was born to the same fortunes as Harley , "
236459	236474	236673	236674	Harley L'Estrange	503	" and yet I flatter myself I am of some use to old England . "
236710	236714	236833	236833	he	503	" Silent Way , "
236824	236831	236833	236833	he	503	" If I were a sculptor , "
236837	236853	236922	236922	Harley	503	" I should remember that image whenever I wished to convey the idea of Despondency ! "
236915	236920	236922	236922	Harley	503	" And looking yonder , "
236926	236947	236959	236959	Egerton	500	" I should remember that form , when I wished to hew out from the granite the idea of Endurance . "
236948	236957	236968	236968	HARLEY	503	" So you are come , and punctually , "
236970	236999	237000	237000	EGERTON	500	" Punctually , of course , for I respect your time , and I will not detain you long . I presume you will speak to - night ? "
237003	237008	237009	237009	HARLEY	503	" I have spoken . "
237014	237021	237022	237022	EGERTON	500	" And well , I hope ? "
237025	237047	237048	237048	HARLEY	503	" With effect , I suppose , for I have been loudly cheered , which does not always happen to me . "
237051	237058	237059	237059	EGERTON	500	" And that gave you pleasure ? "
237067	237074	237075	237075	HARLEY	503	" No , not the least . "
237078	237129	237130	237130	EGERTON	500	" What , then , attaches you so much to this life , - constant drudgery , constant warfare , the more pleasurable faculties dormant , all the harsher ones aroused , if even its rewards and I take the best of those to be applause do not please you ? "
237133	237138	237139	237139	HARLEY	503	" What ? Custom . "
237142	237145	237146	237146	EGERTON	500	" Martyr . "
237149	237171	237172	237172	HARLEY	503	" You say it : but turn to yourself ; you have decided , then , to leave England next week ? "
237176	237255	237256	237256	EGERTON	500	" Yes . This life in a capital , where all are so active , myself so objectless , preys on me like a low fever . Nothing here amuses me , nothing interests , nothing comforts and consoles . But I am resolved , before it be too late , to make one great struggle out of the Past , and into the natural world of men . In a word , I have resolved to marry . "
237259	237262	237263	237263	HARLEY	503	" Whom ? "
237267	237313	237314	237314	EGERTON	500	" Upon my life , my dear fellow , you are a great philosopher . You have hit the exact question . You see I can not marry a dream ; and where , out of dreams , shall I find this ' whom ' ? "
237317	237325	237326	237326	HARLEY	503	" You do not search for her . "
237328	237414	237415	237415	EGERTON	500	" Do we ever search for love ? Does it not flash upon us when we least expect it ? Is it not like the inspiration to the muse ? What poet sits down and says , ' I will write a poem ' ? What man looks out and says , ' I will fall in love ' ? No ! Happiness , as the great German tells us , ' falls suddenly from the bosom of the gods ; ' so does love . "
237418	237446	237447	237447	HARLEV	1097	" You remember the old line in Horace : ' The tide flows away while the boor sits on the margin and waits for the ford . ' "
237450	237531	237532	237532	EGERTON	500	" An idea which incidentally dropped from you some weeks ago , and which I have before half - meditated , has since haunted me . If I could but find some child with sweet dispositions and fair intellect not yet formed , and train her up according to my ideal . I am still young enough to wait a few years . And meanwhile I shall have gained what I so sadly want , - an object in life . "
237535	237547	237563	237563	Audley	500	" You are ever the child of romance . But what - "
237578	237617	237622	237623	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Sir , the Opposition are taking advantage of the thinness of the House to call for a division . Mr. - - - is put up to speak for time , but they wo n't hear him . "
237625	237655	237664	237664	Harley	503	" You see , you must excuse me now . To - morrow I must go to Windsor for two days : but we shall meet on my return . "
237656	237662	237688	237688	Harley	503	" It does not matter , "
237666	237686	237688	237688	Harley	503	" I stand out of the pale of your advice , O practical man of sense . And if , "
237697	237732	237836	237836	Harley	503	" if I weary you with complaints which you can not understand , it is only because of old schoolboy habits . I can have no trouble that I do not confide to you . "
237826	237834	237836	237836	Harley	503	" Nero , sir , come here , "
237838	237841	237964	237964	L'Estrange	502	" Nero , "
237953	237962	237981	237981	Leonard	450	" The dog is quite harmless , sir , "
237970	237979	238016	238016	Harley	503	" And you call him ' Nero ' ? "
237997	238015	238024	238024	Leonard	450	" Nero , sir ; but he is free from the sanguinary propensities of his Roman namesake . "
238028	238056	238065	238065	he	503	" Pardon me , but can it be possible that you are one whom I have sought in vain on behalf of the child of Captain Digby ? "
238061	238064	238065	238065	he	503	" Digby ! "
238068	238086	238096	238096	Leonard	450	" where is he ? He should have found me easily . I gave him an address . "
238087	238094	238110	238110	he	503	" Ah , Heaven be thanked ! "
238098	238108	238166	238166	him	503	" Helen is saved - she will not die , "
238173	238185	238188	238188	Helen	894	" Comfort , comfort ; your father yet lives in me . "
238196	238219	238237	238237	Leonard	450	" But Leonard is my brother - more than brother - and he needs a father 's care more than I do . "
238220	238235	238472	238472	He	503	" Hush , hush , Helen . I need no one , nothing now ! "
238460	238471	238490	238490	He	503	" the something afar from the sphere of our sorrow . "
238506	238529	238545	238545	Leonard	450	" And these are the labours by which you supported the soldier 's orphan ? - soldier yourself in a hard battle ! "
238530	238543	238490	238490	He	503	" The battle was lost , - I could not support her , "
238549	238570	238578	238578	Leonard	450	" But you did not desert her . When Pandora 's box was opened , they say Hope lingered last - "
238571	238576	238578	238578	Leonard	450	" False , false , "
238580	238602	238612	238612	Harley	503	" a heathen 's notion . There are deities that linger behind Hope , - Gratitude , Love , and Duty . "
238603	238610	238612	238612	Harley	503	" Yours is no common nature , "
238616	238704	238751	238751	he	450	" but I must sound it more deeply hereafter : at present I hasten for the physician ; I shall return with him . We must move that poor child from this low close air as soon as possible . Meanwhile , let me qualify your rejection of the old fable . Wherever Gratitude , Love , and Duty remain to man , believe me that Hope is there too , though she may be often invisible , hidden behind the sheltering wings of the nobler deities . "
238754	238806	238851	238851	his	450	" O Thou , the All - seeing and All - merciful ! how it comforts me now to think that , though my dreams of knowledge may have sometimes obscured the heavens , I never doubted that Thou wert there ! as luminous and everlasting , though behind the cloud ! "
238871	238887	238955	238955	he	450	" I need not disgrace my calling , - I need not be the mendicant now "
238958	238986	239126	239126	he	503	" No mendicant ! - the life that I was sworn to guard is saved . I can raise against Fate the front of Man once more . "
239148	239185	239201	239201	Harley	503	" Now , my Lord , that Helen is safe , and now that she will need me no more , I can no longer be a pensioner on your bounty . I return to London . "
239186	239199	239201	239201	Harley	503	" You are my visitor , not my pensioner , foolish boy , "
239215	239225	239253	239254	Lord L'Estrange	502	" come into the garden and let us talk . "
239248	239251	239253	239254	Lord L'Estrange	502	" So , "
239256	239267	239253	239254	Lord L'Estrange	502	" you would return to London ? What to do ? "
239268	239273	239253	239254	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Fulfil my fate . "
239274	239278	239253	239254	Lord L'Estrange	502	" And that ? "
239279	239297	239309	239309	Harley	503	" I can not guess . Fate is the Isis whose veil no mortal can ever raise . "
239298	239307	239309	239309	Harley	503	" You should be born for great things , "
239313	239397	239691	239691	he	503	" I am sure that you write well . I have seen that you study with passion . Better than writing and better than study , you have a noble heart , and the proud desire of independence . Let me see your manuscripts , or any copies of what you have already printed . Do not hesitate , - I ask but to be a reader . I do n't pretend to be a patron : it is a word I hate . "
239666	239671	239724	239724	he	450	" melancholy , slow , "
239716	239723	239724	239724	he	450	" I have read your papers , "
239727	239743	239744	239744	Leonard	450	" and recognize in them two men , belonging to two worlds , essentially distinct . "
239750	239755	239762	239762	Harley	503	" True , true ! "
239756	239760	239762	239762	Harley	503	" I apprehend , "
239764	239866	239902	239902	Harley	503	" that one of these men must either destroy the other , or that the two must become fused and harmonized into a single existence . Get your hat , mount my groom 's horse , and come with me to London ; we will converse by the way . Look you , I believe you and I agree in this , - that the first object of every noble spirit is independence . It is towards this independence that I alone presume to assist you , and this is a service which the proudest man can receive without a blush . "
239892	239900	239902	239902	Harley	503	" I am not one of those , "
239911	240109	240131	240131	his	450	" who think that because a young man writes poetry he is fit for nothing else , and that he must be a poet or a pauper . I have said that in you there seems to me to be two men , - the man of the Actual world , the man of the Ideal . To each of these men I can offer a separate career . The first is perhaps the more tempting . It is the interest of the State to draw into its service all the talent and industry it can obtain ; and under his native State every citizen of a free country should be proud to take service . I have a friend who is a minister , and who is known to encourage talent , - Audley Egerton . I have but to say to him , ' There is a young man who will repay the government whatever the government bestows on him ; ' and you will rise to - morrow independent in means , and with fair occasions to attain to fortune and distinction . This is one offer , - what say you to it ? "
240137	240181	240378	240378	he	450	" Oh , my Lord , how have I deserved such kindness ? Do with me what you will ; but if I have the option , I would rather follow my own calling . This is not the ambition that inflames me . "
240182	240353	240363	240363	Leonard	450	" Hear , then , the other offer . I have a friend with whom I am less intimate than Egerton , and who has nothing in his gift to bestow . I speak of a man of letters , - Henry Norreys , - of whom you have doubtless heard , who , I should say , conceived an interest in you when he observed you reading at the bookstall . I have often heard him say that literature as a profession is misunderstood , and that rightly followed , with the same pains and the same prudence which are brought to bear on other professions , a competence at least can be always ultimately obtained . But the way may be long and tedious , and it leads to no power but over thought ; it rarely attains to wealth ; and though reputation may be certain , fame , such as poets dream of , is the lot of few . What say you to this course ? "
240354	240361	240378	240378	he	450	" My Lord , I decide , "
240381	240492	240498	240498	Harley	503	" Yes , if , as you say , there be two men within me , I feel that were I condemned wholly to the mechanical and practical world , one would indeed destroy the other . And the conqueror would be the ruder and the coarser . Let me pursue those ideas that , though they have but flitted across me , vague and formless , have ever soared towards the sunlight . No matter whether or not they lead to fortune or to fame , - at least they will lead me upward ! Knowledge for itself I desire ; what care I if it be not power ! "
240493	240496	240498	240498	Harley	503	" Enough , "
240511	240543	240551	240551	his	14972	" As you decide so shall it be settled . And now permit me , if not impertinent , to ask you a few questions . Your name is Leonard Fairfield ? "
240558	240610	240617	240617	Leonard	450	" Helen says you are self - taught ; for the rest she refers me to you , - thinking , perhaps , that I should esteem you less - rather than yet more highly - if she said you were , as I presume to conjecture , of humble birth . "
240611	240615	240617	240617	Leonard	450	" My birth , "
240621	240629	240661	240661	Harley	503	" is very - very - humble . "
240630	240659	240664	240664	his	503	" The name of Fairfield is not unknown to me . There was one of that name who married into a family in Lansmere , married an Avenel , "
240668	240684	240690	240690	Leonard	450	" You change countenance . Oh , could your mother 's name have been Avenel ? "
240685	240688	240697	240697	Harley	503	" Yes , "
240707	240738	240751	240751	Harley	503	" Then , indeed , I have a claim on you ; then , indeed , we are friends . I have a right to serve any of that family . "
240746	240749	240776	240776	He	503	" For , "
240756	240775	240896	240896	Harley	503	" they always served my family ; and my recollections of Lansmere , though boyish , are indelible . "
240887	240894	240913	240914	the man	14948	" Is Mr. Norreys at home ? "
240898	240911	240966	240967	The man	14948	" He is at home - to his friends , my Lord , "
240941	240965	241051	241051	Harley	503	" Stay ; show this gentleman into another room . I will go first into the library ; wait for me , Leonard . "
241060	241066	241051	241051	Harley	503	" History of the World , "
241070	241078	241086	241086	Norreys	1064	" I have brought you a treasure ! "
241079	241084	241086	241086	Norreys	1064	" What is it ? "
241098	241102	241109	241109	Norreys	1064	" A mind ! "
241103	241107	241086	241086	Norreys	1064	" A mind ! "
241113	241117	241235	241235	Harley	503	" Your own ? "
241118	241234	241235	241235	Harley	503	" Pooh ! I have none , - I have only a heart and a fancy . Listen . You remember the boy we saw reading at the book stall . I have caught him for you , and you shall train him into a man . I have the warmest interest in his future , for I know some of his family , and one of that family was very dear to me . As for money , he has not a shilling , and not a shilling would he accept gratis from you or me either . But he comes with bold heart to work , - and work you must find him . "
241256	241287	241379	241379	he	5338	" This promises very well ; for letters a man must have a strong vocation , as he should have for law . I will do all that you wish . "
241374	241377	241379	241379	he	5338	" Sir , "
241381	241565	241368	241368	he	5338	" Lord L'Estrange tells me that you wish to enter literature as a calling , and no doubt to study it as an art . I may help you in this , and you meanwhile can help me . I want an amanuensis , - I offer you that place . The salary will be proportioned to the services you will render me . I have a room in my house at your disposal . When I first came up to London , I made the same choice that I hear you have done . I have no cause , even in a worldly point of view , to repent my choice . It gave me an income larger than my wants . I trace my success to these maxims , which are applicable to all professions : 1st , Never to trust to genius for what can be obtained by labour ; 2dly , Never to profess to teach what we have not studied to understand ; 3dly , Never to engage our word to what we do not our best to execute .
241566	241624	241631	241631	Harley	503	" With these rules , literature - provided a man does not mistake his vocation for it , and will , under good advice , go through the preliminary discipline of natural powers , which all vocations require - is as good a calling as any other . Without them , a shoeblack 's is infinitely better . "
241625	241629	241631	241631	Harley	503	" Possibly enough , "
241633	241647	241676	241676	Harley	503	" but there have been great writers who observed none of your maxims . "
241648	241675	242935	242936	the squire	1498	" Great writers , probably , but very unenviable men . My Lord , my Lord , do n't corrupt the pupil you bring to me . "
242944	242978	243243	243243	he	570	" What was to become of the estate if it fell into the hands of a spendthrift ? No man should make ducks and drakes of Hazeldean ; let Frank beware of that , "
243282	243286	243381	243381	Randal	570	" great expectations . "
243384	243412	243421	243421	Egerton	500	" Ahem , sir , I have a note from Frank Hazeldean , who wants much to see me ; his father has arrived in town unexpectedly . "
243413	243419	243421	243421	Egerton	500	" What brings him here ? "
243426	243455	243521	243521	he	500	" Why , it seems that he has heard some vague reports of poor Frank 's extravagance , and Frank is rather afraid or ashamed to meet him . "
243456	243517	243577	243577	his	500	" Ay , a very great fault , extravagance in the young ! - destroys independence ; ruins or enslaves the future . Great fault , - very ! And what does youth want that it should be extravagant ? Has it not everything in itself , merely because it is ? Youth is youth - what needs it more ? "
243580	243599	243690	243690	L'Estrange	502	" If you have done with the ' Times , ' have the goodness to place it here . "
243685	243688	243690	243690	L'Estrange	502	" Audley , "
243692	243717	243690	243690	L'Estrange	502	" I have had an adventure since I saw you , - an adventure that reopened the Past , and may influence my future . "
243718	243721	243690	243690	L'Estrange	502	" How ? "
243722	243741	243690	243690	L'Estrange	502	" In the first place , I have met with a relation of - of - the Avenels . "
243742	243751	243690	243690	L'Estrange	502	" Indeed ! Whom , - Richard Avenel ? "
243752	243785	243690	243690	L'Estrange	502	" Richard - Richard - who is he ? Oh , I remember , the wild lad who went off to America ; but that was when I was a mere child . "
243786	243826	243839	243839	Harley	503	" That Richard Avenel is now a rich , thriving trader , and his marriage is in this newspaper , - married to an Honourable Mrs. M'Catchley . Well , in this country who should plume himself on birth ? "
243827	243837	243690	243690	L'Estrange	502	" You did not say so always , Egerton , "
243848	243877	243690	243690	L'Estrange	502	" And I say so now pertinently to a Mrs. M'Catchley , not to the heir of the L'Estranges . But no more of these - these Avenels . "
243878	243902	243911	243911	Egerton	500	" Yes , more of them . I tell you I have met a relation of theirs - a nephew of - of - "
243903	243909	243926	243926	he	500	" Of Richard Avenel 's ? "
243935	243953	243690	243690	L'Estrange	502	" Richard Avenel the trader ! I saw him once , - a presuming and intolerable man ! "
243954	243988	243995	243995	Harley	503	" The nephew has not those sins . He is full of promise , of modesty , yet of pride . And his countenance - oh , Egerton , he has her eyes . "
243998	244017	244028	244028	Egerton	500	" I had thought of placing him under your care . I knew you would provide for him . "
244018	244026	244050	244050	Harley	503	" I will . Bring him hither , "
244032	244049	243995	243995	Harley	503	" All that I can do to prove my - regard for a wish of yours . "
244058	244111	243995	243995	Harley	503	" I thank you from my heart ; the Audley of my boyhood speaks now . But the young man has decided otherwise ; and I do not blame him . Nay , I rejoice that he chooses a career in which , if he find hardship , he may escape dependence . "
244112	244118	243995	243995	Harley	503	" And that career is - "
244119	244122	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" Letters . "
244123	244128	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" Letters ! Literature ! "
244133	244148	243995	243995	Harley	503	" Beggary ! No , no , Harley , this is your absurd romance . "
244149	244197	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" It will not be beggary , and it is not my romance : it is the boy 's . Leave him alone , he is my care and my charge henceforth . He is of her blood , and I said that he had HER eyes . "
244198	244218	243995	243995	Harley	503	" But you are going abroad ; let me know where he is ; I will watch over him . "
244219	244251	244252	244252	Audley	500	" And unsettle a right ambition for a wrong one ? No , you shall know nothing of him till he can proclaim himself . I think that day will come . "
244261	244295	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" Well , perhaps you are right . After all , as you say , independence is a great blessing , and my ambition has not rendered myself the better or the happier . "
244296	244310	244322	244322	Egerton	500	" Yet , my poor Audley , you ask me to be ambitious . "
244311	244320	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" I only wish you to be consoled , "
244327	244382	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" I will try to be so ; and by the help of a milder remedy than yours . I said that my adventure might influence my future ; it brought me acquainted not only with the young man I speak of , but the most winning , affectionate child , - a girl . "
244383	244391	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" Is this child an Avenel too ? "
244392	244467	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" No , she is of gentle blood , - a soldier 's daughter ; the daughter of that Captain Digby on whose behalf I was a petitioner to your patronage . He is dead , and in dying , my name was on his lips . He meant me , doubtless , to be the guardian to his orphan . I shall be so . I have at last an object in life . "
244468	244482	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" But can you seriously mean to take this child with you abroad ? "
244483	244489	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" Seriously , I do . "
244490	244499	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" And lodge her in your own house ? "
244500	244527	244130	244131	the statesman	3214	" For a year or so , while she is yet a child . Then , as she approaches youth , I shall place her elsewhere . "
244528	244559	244643	244643	Harley	503	" You may grow to love her . Is it clear that she will love you , - not mistake gratitude for love ? It is a very hazardous experiment . "
244560	244641	244643	244643	Harley	503	" So was William the Norman 's , - still he was William the Conqueror . Thou biddest me move on from the Past , and be consoled , yet thou wouldst make me as inapt to progress as the mule in Slawkenbergius 's tale , with thy cursed interlocutions , ' Stumbling , by Saint Nicholas , every step . Why , at this rate , we shall be all night in getting into ' - HAPPINESS ! Listen , "
244659	244816	244973	244973	he	500	" One of the sons of the prophets in Israel felling wood near the river Jordan , his hatchet forsook the helve , and fell to the bottom of the river ; so he prayed to have it again it was but a small request , mark you ; and having a strong faith , he did not throw the hatchet after the helve , but the helve after the hatchet . Presently two great miracles were seen . Up springs the hatchet from the bottom of the water , and fixes itself to its old acquaintance , the helve . Now , had he wished to coach it up to heaven in a fiery chariot like Elias , be as rich as Job , strong as Samson , and beautiful as Absalom , would he have obtained the wish , do you think ? In truth , my friend , I question it very much . "
244817	244832	244643	244643	Harley	503	" I ca n't comprehend what you mean . Sad stuff you are talking . "
244833	244957	244965	244966	Audley Egerton	500	" I can not help that ; ' Rabelais is to be blamed for it . I am quoting him , and it is to be found in his Prologue to the Chapters on the ' Moderation of Wishes . ' And a propos of ' moderate wishes in point of hatchet , ' I want you to understand that I ask but little from Heaven . I fling but the helve after the hatchet that has sunk into the silent stream . I want the other half of the weapon that is buried fathom deep , and for want of which the thick woods darken round me by the Sacred River , and I can catch not a glimpse of the stars . "
244958	244963	244973	244973	he	500	" In plain English , "
244968	244972	244643	244643	Harley	503	" you want - "
244979	245038	245092	245093	the waiter	6629	" I want my purpose and my will , and my old character , and the nature God gave me . I want the half of my soul which has fallen from me . I want such love as may replace to me the vanished affections . Reason not , - I throw the helve after the hatchet . "
245114	245116	245173	245173	he	570	" Times "
245169	245172	245173	245173	he	570	" Vexatious ! "
245176	245194	245269	245269	he	1498	" there is no knowledge which has power more useful than that of the secrets of men . "
245264	245267	245269	245269	he	1498	" Well , "
245273	245288	245257	245257	he	1498	" I thought your old schoolfellow , Frank , might have been with you . "
245289	245299	245269	245269	he	1498	" Have you not seen him yet , sir ? "
245300	245371	245456	245456	RANDAL	570	" No , I came to town this morning ; travelled outside the mail ; sent to his barracks , but the young gentleman does not sleep there , has an apartment of his own ; he never told me that . We are a plain family , the Hazeldeans , young sir ; and I hate being kept in the dark , - by my own son , too . "
245424	245455	245456	245456	RANDAL	570	" I am very glad to make your acquaintance at last , Mr. Leslie . You know , I hope , that you have good Hazeldean blood in your veins ? "
245460	245477	245478	245478	SQUIRE	732	" I am not likely to forget that ; it is the boast of our pedigree . "
245482	245599	245600	245600	RANDAL	570	" Shake hands again on it , my boy . You do n't want a friend , since my grandee of a half - brother has taken you up ; but if ever you should , Hazeldean is not very far from Rood . Ca n't get on with your father at all , my lad , - more 's the pity , for I think I could have given him a hint or two as to the improvement of his property . If he would plant those ugly commons - larch and fir soon come into profit , sir ; and there are some low lands about Rood that would take mighty kindly to draining . "
245603	245632	245633	245633	SQUIRE	15284	" My poor father lives a life so retired - and you can not wonder at it . Fallen trees lie still , and so do fallen families . "
245636	245650	245651	245651	RANDAL	570	" Fallen families can get up again , which fallen trees ca n't . "
245654	245677	245679	245679	his	15284	" Ah , sir , it often takes the energy of generations to repair the thriftlessness and extravagance of a single owner . "
245684	245732	245733	245733	RANDAL	570	" That 's very true . Frank is d - -d extravagant ; treats me very coolly , too - not coming ; near three o'clock . By the by , I suppose he told you where I was , otherwise how did you find me out ? "
245737	245759	245760	245760	SQUIRE	732	" Sir , he did ; and to speak frankly , I am not surprised that he has not yet appeared . "
245763	245766	245767	245767	RANDAL	570	" Eh ! "
245770	245777	245846	245847	the father	2917	" We have grown very intimate . "
245781	245844	245846	245847	the father	2917	" So he writes me word , - and I am glad of it . Our member , Sir John , tells me you are a very clever fellow , and a very steady one . And Frank says that he wishes he had your prudence , if he ca n't have your talent . He has a good heart , Frank , "
245851	245873	245881	245881	Randal	570	" But zounds , sir , you say you are not surprised he has not come to welcome his own father ! "
245874	245879	245881	245881	Randal	570	" My dear sir , "
245883	245917	245846	245847	the father	2917	" you wrote word to Frank that you had heard from Sir John and others of his goings - on , and that you were not satisfied with his replies to your letters . "
245918	245921	245881	245881	Randal	570	" Well . "
245922	245932	245846	245847	the father	2917	" And then you suddenly come up to town . "
245933	245936	245881	245881	Randal	570	" Well . "
245937	246025	246031	246032	the squire	1498	" Well . And Frank is ashamed to meet you . For , as you say , he has been extravagant , and he has exceeded his allowance ; and knowing my respect for you and my great affection for himself , he has asked me to prepare you to receive his confession and forgive him . I know I am taking a great liberty . I have no right to interfere between father and son ; but pray - pray think I mean for the best . "
246026	246029	246035	246035	himself	1498	" Humph ! "
246044	246131	246140	246140	Randal	570	" I knew already that Frank had spent more than he ought ; but I think he should not have employed a third person to prepare me to forgive him . Excuse me , - no offence . And if he wanted a third person , was not there his own mother ? What the devil ! firing up am I a tyrant , a bashaw , that my own son is afraid to speak to me ? ' Gad , I 'll give it him ! "
246132	246138	246140	246140	Randal	570	" Pardon me , sir , "
246159	246287	246327	246327	he	570	" but I strongly advise you not to express any anger at Frank 's confidence in me . At present I have influence over him . Whatever you may think of his extravagance , I have saved him from many an indiscretion , and many a debt , - a young man will listen to one of his own age so much more readily than even to the kindest friend of graver years . Indeed , sir , I speak for your sake as well as for Frank 's . Let me keep this influence over him ; and do n't reproach him for the confidence placed in me . Nay , let him rather think that I have softened any displeasure you might otherwise have felt . "
246317	246325	246327	246327	he	570	" You are a fine young fellow , "
246329	246397	246405	246405	Randal	570	" and I am very much obliged to you . Well , I suppose there is no putting old heads upon young shoulders ; and I promise you I 'll not say an angry word to Frank . I dare say , poor boy , he is very much afflicted , and I long to shake hands with him . So , set his mind at ease . "
246398	246403	246405	246405	Randal	570	" Ah , sir , "
246412	246443	246455	246456	the squire	1498	" your son may well love you : and it seems to be a hard matter for so kind a heart as yours to preserve the proper firmness with him . "
246444	246453	246455	246456	the squire	1498	" Oh , I can be firm enough , "
246459	246485	246455	246456	the squire	1498	" especially when I do n't see him , - handsome dog that he is : very like his mother - do n't you think so ?
246486	246495	246455	246456	the squire	1498	" I never saw his mother , sir . "
246496	246530	246455	246456	the squire	1498	" ' Gad ! Not seen my Harry ? No more you have ; you must come and pay us a visit . I suppose my half - brother will let you come ? "
246531	246550	246455	246456	the squire	1498	" To be sure , sir . Will you not call on him while you are in town ? "
246551	246630	246640	246640	Randal	570	" Not I. He would think I expected to get something from the Government . Tell him the ministers must go on a little better , if they want my vote for their member . But go , I see you are impatient to tell Frank that all 's forgot and forgiven . Come and dine with him here at six , and let him bring his bills in his pocket . Oh , I sha'n't scold him . "
246631	246638	246640	246640	Randal	570	" Why , as to that , "
246644	246732	246455	246456	the squire	1498	" I think forgive me still that you should not take it too easily ; just as I think that you had better not blame him for his very natural and praiseworthy shame in approaching you , so I think , also , that you should do nothing that would tend to diminish that shame , - it is such a check on him . And therefore , if you can contrive to affect to be angry with him for his extravagance , it will do good . "
246733	246747	246640	246640	Randal	570	" You speak like a book , and I 'll try my best . "
246748	246779	246455	246456	the squire	1498	" If you threaten , for instance , to take him out of the army , and settle him in the country , it would have a very good effect . "
246780	246800	246640	246640	Randal	570	" What ! would he think it so great a punishment to come home and live with his parents ? "
246801	246831	246837	246838	the squire	1498	" I do n't say that ; but he is naturally so fond of London . At his age , and with his large inheritance , that is natural . "
246832	246835	246837	246838	the squire	1498	" Inheritance ! "
246843	246918	247005	247005	Randal	570	" inheritance ! he is not thinking of that , I trust ? Zounds , sir , I have as good a life as his own . Inheritance ! - to be sure the Casino property is entailed on him ; but as for the rest , sir , I am no tenant for life . I could leave the Hazeldean lands to my ploughman , if I chose it . Inheritance ; indeed ! "
246919	247003	247005	247005	Randal	570	" My dear sir , I did not mean to imply that Frank would entertain the unnatural and monstrous idea of calculating on your death ; and all we have to do is to get him to sow his wild oats as soon as possible , - marry and settle down into the country . For it would be a thousand pities if his town habits and tastes grew permanent , - a bad thing for the Hazeldean property , that ! And , "
247009	247046	247057	247058	the squire	1498	" I feel an interest in the old place , since my grandmother comes of the stock . So , just force yourself to seem angry , and grumble a little when you pay the bills . "
247047	247055	247057	247058	the squire	1498	" Ah , ah , trust me , "
247069	247084	247122	247122	he	570	" I am much obliged to you for these hints , my young kinsman . "
247115	247120	247122	247122	he	570	" My dear fellow , "
247128	247175	247184	247184	Frank	449	" it is very fortunate that I persuaded you to let me break matters to your father . You might well say he was rather passionate ; but I have contrived to soothe him . You need not fear that he will not pay your debts . "
247176	247182	247184	247184	Frank	449	" I never feared that , "
247189	247239	247122	247122	he	570	" I only feared his anger . But , indeed , I fear his kindness still more . What a reckless hound I have been ! However , it shall be a lesson to me . And my debts once paid , I will turn as economical as yourself . "
247240	247277	247184	247184	Frank	449	" Quite right , Frank . And , indeed , I am a little afraid that , when your father knows the total , he may execute a threat that would be very unpleasant to you . "
247278	247283	247122	247122	he	570	" What 's that ? "
247284	247295	247302	247302	Frank	449	" Make you sell out , and give up London . "
247296	247300	247302	247302	Frank	449	" The devil ! "
247308	247318	247122	247122	he	570	" that would be treating me like a child . "
247319	247357	247367	247367	Frank	449	" Why , it would make you seem rather ridiculous to your set , which is not a very rural one . And you , who like London so much , and are so much the fashion ! "
247358	247365	247122	247122	he	570	" Do n't talk of it , "
247379	247428	247122	247122	he	570	" Perhaps , on the whole , it might be well not to say all you owe , at once . If you named half the sum , your father would let you off with a lecture ; and really I tremble at the effect of the total . "
247429	247439	247122	247122	he	570	" But how shall I pay the other half ? "
247440	247464	247122	247122	he	570	" Oh , you must save from your allowance ; it is a very liberal one ; and the tradesmen are not pressing . "
247465	247475	247122	247122	he	570	" No ; but the cursed bill - brokers - "
247476	247505	247526	247526	Frank	449	" Always renew to a young man of your expectations . And if I get into an office , I can always help you , my dear Frank . "
247506	247524	247526	247526	Frank	449	" Ah , Randal , I am not so bad as to take advantage of your friendship , "
247530	247582	247122	247122	he	570	" But it seems to me mean after all , and a sort of a lie , indeed , disguising the real state of my affairs . I should not have listened to the idea from any one else ; but you are such a sensible , kind , honourable fellow . "
247583	247697	247526	247526	Frank	449	" After epithets so flattering , I shrink from the responsibility of advice . But apart from your own interests , I should be glad to save your father the pain he would feel at knowing the whole extent of the scrape you have got into . And if it entailed on you the necessity to lay by - and give up hazard , and not be security for other men - why , it would be the best thing that could happen . Really , too , it seems hard upon Mr. Hazeldean that he should be the only sufferer , and quite just that you should bear half your own burdens . "
247698	247740	247122	247122	he	570	" So it is , Randal ; that did not strike me before . I will take your counsel ; and now I will go at once to Limmer 's . My dear father ! I hope he is looking well ? "
247741	247896	248007	248008	the squire	1498	" Oh , very . Such a contrast to the sallow Londoners ! But I think you had better not go till dinner . He has asked me to meet you at six . I will call for you a little before , and we can go together . This will prevent a good deal of gene and constraint . Good - by till then . Ha ! by the way , I think if I were you , I would not take the matter too seriously and penitentially . You see the best of fathers like to keep their sons under their thumb , as the saying is . And if you want at your age to preserve your independence , and not be hurried off and buried in the country , like a schoolboy in disgrace , a little manliness of bearing would not be amiss . You can think over it . "
247987	247996	248155	248155	he	570	" not to take the thing too seriously , "
248175	248231	248232	248232	Frank	449	" that it was all very well once in a way to exceed his allowance ; but if Frank did not , in future , show more sense than to be led away by a set of London sharks and coxcombs , he must cut the army , come home , and take to farming . "
248236	248264	248270	248271	the squire	1498	" Oh , sir , I have no taste for farming . And after London , at my age , the country would be so horribly dull . "
248265	248268	248277	248277	he	1498	" Aha ! "
248305	248363	248277	248277	he	1498	" The country is terribly dull , is it ? Money goes there not upon follies and vices , but upon employing honest labourers , and increasing the wealth of the nation . It does not please you to spend money in that way : it is a pity you should ever be plagued with such duties . "
248364	248369	248277	248277	he	1498	" My dear father - "
248370	248445	248454	248454	Randal	570	" Hold your tongue , you puppy . Oh , I dare say , if you were in my shoes , you would cut down the oaks , and mortgage the property ; sell it , for what I know , - all go on a cast of the dice ! Aha , sir - very well , very well - the country is horribly dull , is it ? Pray stay in town . "
248446	248452	248454	248454	Randal	570	" My dear Mr. Hazeldean , "
248476	248575	248589	248590	the squire	1498	" you must not interpret a hasty expression so literally . Why , you would make Frank as bad as Lord A - - - , who wrote word to his steward to cut down more timber ; and when the steward replied , ' There are only three sign - posts left on the whole estate , ' wrote back , ' They 've done growing at all events , - down with them ! ' You ought to know Lord A - - - , sir ; so witty ; and - Frank 's particular friend . "
248576	248587	248621	248621	Randal	570	" Your particular friend , Master Frank ? Pretty friends ! "
248610	248619	248621	248621	Randal	570	" But I 'm his friend , too , "
248625	248638	248759	248759	he	1498	" and I preach to him properly , I can tell you . "
248750	248757	248759	248759	he	1498	" But , to be sure , "
248769	248786	248794	248794	Randal	570	" you have good Hazeldean blood in you , and know a bean from a turnip . "
248787	248792	248794	248794	Randal	570	" Why , sir , "
248798	248825	248759	248759	he	1498	" I am training myself for public life ; and what is a public man worth if he do not study the agriculture of his country ? "
248826	248868	248794	248794	Randal	570	" Right - what is he worth ? Put that question , with my compliments , to my half - brother . What stuff he did talk , the other night , on the malt - tax , to be sure ! "
248869	248926	248938	248940	the poor squire	8349	" Mr. Egerton has had so many other things to think of , that we must excuse his want of information upon one topic , however important . With his strong sense he must acquire that information , sooner or later ; for he is fond of power ; and , sir , knowledge is power ! "
248927	248936	248973	248973	Randal	570	" Very true , - very fine saying , "
248968	248971	248982	248982	he	570	" Yes , "
248975	248980	249080	249080	he	1498	" knowledge is power ; "
249054	249068	249108	249108	he	1498	" Speak to poor Frank , - kindly now , sir - do ; "
249101	249106	249108	249108	he	1498	" My dear boy , "
249110	249134	249167	249167	His	449	" there , do n't fret - pshaw ! - it was but a trifle after all . Think no more of it . "
249152	249166	249218	249218	he	1498	" Oh , sir , you are too good , - too good . "
249211	249216	249218	249218	he	1498	" My dear Frank , "
249223	249282	249288	249288	Frank	449	" it is not the money ; but , you see , it so vexes your poor mother ; you must be careful in future ; and , zounds , boy , it will be all yours one day ; only do n't calculate on it ; I could not bear that , I could not , indeed . "
249283	249286	249288	249288	Frank	449	" Calculate ! "
249290	249300	249322	249322	Randal	570	" Oh , sir , can you think it ? "
249301	249320	249322	249322	Randal	570	" I am so delighted that I had some slight hand in your complete reconciliation with Mr. Hazeldean , "
249333	249351	249288	249288	Frank	449	" I saw that you were disheartened , and I told him to speak to you kindly . "
249352	249365	249377	249377	Randal	570	" Did you ? Ah - I am sorry he needed telling . "
249366	249375	249377	249377	Randal	570	" I know his character so well already , "
249379	249402	249413	249413	Frank	449	" that I flatter myself I can always keep things between you as they ought to be . What an excellent man ! "
249403	249411	249421	249421	his	449	" The best man in the world , "
249425	249441	249377	249377	Randal	570	" yet I have deceived him . I have a great mind to go back - "
249442	249508	249421	249421	his	449	" And tell him to give you twice as much money as you had asked for ? He would think you had only seemed so affectionate in order to take him in . No , no , Frank ! save , lay by , economize ; and then tell him that you have paid half your own debts . Something high - minded in that . "
249509	249525	249377	249377	Randal	570	" So there is . Your heart is as good as your head . Goodnight . "
249526	249539	249421	249421	his	449	" Are you going home so early ? Have you no engagements ! "
249540	249547	249377	249377	Randal	570	" None that I shall keep . "
249548	249555	249648	249649	the statesman	3214	" Good - night , then . "
249636	249646	249648	249649	the statesman	3214	" Never let the dandies call you a prig , "
249651	249703	249713	249713	Randal	570	" Many a clever fellow fails through life , because the silly fellows , whom half a word well spoken could make his claqueurs , turn him into ridicule . Whatever you are , avoid the fault of most reading men : in a word , do n't be a prig ! "
249704	249711	249713	249713	Randal	570	" I have just left Hazeldean , "
249715	249723	249729	249732	the Honourable George Borrowell	8367	" What a good fellow he is ! "
249724	249727	249729	249732	the Honourable George Borrowell	8367	" Capital ! "
249734	249739	249713	249713	Randal	570	" Where is he ? "
249740	249800	249729	249732	the Honourable George Borrowell	8367	" Why , he is gone to his rooms . He has had a little scene with his father , a thorough , rough country squire . It would be an act of charity if you would go and keep him company , or take him with you to some place a little more lively than his own lodgings . "
249801	249833	249841	249841	Randal	570	" What ! the old gentleman has been teasing him ! - a horrid shame ! Why , Frank is not extravagant , and he will be very rich , eh ? "
249834	249839	249856	249856	he	570	" An immense property , "
249843	249855	249899	249899	Randal	570	" and not a mortgage on it : an only son , "
249889	249897	249899	249899	Randal	570	" The wedge is in the tree , "
249903	249917	249979	249979	he	503	" and there is a gap already between the bark and the wood . "
249974	249978	250038	250038	her	894	" And thus , "
250015	250015	250022	250022	Helen	894	"
250016	250020	250069	250069	he	503	" Leave him ! "
250058	250067	250069	250069	he	503	" It is hard on you , Helen , "
250071	250209	250290	250290	her	16356	" to be separated from one who has been to you as a brother . Do not hate me for doing so . But I consider myself your guardian , and your home as yet must be mine . We are going from this land of cloud and mist , going as into the world of summer . Well , that does not content you . You weep , my child ; you mourn your own friend , but do not forget your father 's . I am alone , and often sad , Helen ; will you not comfort me ? You press my hand , but you must learn to smile on me also . You are born to be the comforter . Comforters are not egotists ; they are always cheerful when they console . "
250299	250317	250348	250348	he	503	" I am going from you , brother ; do not grieve , do not miss me . "
250342	250346	250348	250348	he	503	" This heart , "
250350	250357	250358	250358	He	503	" will be worth the winning ! "
250366	250388	250411	250411	L'Estrange	503	" Soothe , but encourage and support her . I leave you together ; come to me in the garden later . "
250399	250409	250358	250358	He	503	" She was not weeping when you left her ? "
250413	250443	250444	250444	Harley	503	" No ; she has more fortitude than we might suppose . Heaven knows how that fortitude has supported mine . I have promised to write to her often . "
250462	250487	250444	250444	Harley	503	" Keep your promise , and write often for the first year . I would then ask you to let the correspondence drop gradually . "
250488	250496	250444	250444	Harley	503	" Drop ! Ah , my Lord ! "
250497	250594	250607	250607	Leonard	450	" Look you , my young friend , I wish to lead this fair mind wholly from the sorrows of the past . I wish Helen to enter , not abruptly , but step by step , into a new life . You love each other now , as do two children , - as brother and sister . But later , if encouraged , would the love be the same ? And is it not better for both of you that youth should open upon the world with youth 's natural affections free and unforestalled ? "
250595	250605	250444	250444	Harley	503	" True ! And she is so above me , "
250611	250633	250644	250644	Harley	503	" No one is above him who succeeds in your ambition , Leonard . It is not that , believe me . "
250639	250642	250644	250644	Harley	503	" Perhaps , "
250650	250719	250802	250802	he	450	" I rather feel that you are above me . For what vantage - ground is so high as youth ? Perhaps I may become jealous of you . It is well that she should learn to like one who is to be henceforth her guardian and protector . Yet how can she like me as she ought , if her heart is to be full of you ? "
250807	250835	251424	251424	one	14938	" Strange , strange , so mere a child ! this can not be love ! Still , what else to love is there left to me ? "
251393	251395	251424	251424	one	14938	" Huzza "
251398	251403	251419	251419	one	14938	" March of Enlightenment , "
251431	251467	251511	251511	himself	8413	" Gently , gently ; LIGHT is noiseless : how comes ' Enlightenment ' to make such a clatter ? Meanwhile , if it be not impertinent , pray , where is Enlightenment marching to ? "
251512	251516	251544	251544	Another	15587	" a slave , "
251531	251543	252140	252140	we	8451	" Enlightenment is marching towards the seven points of the Charter . "
252146	252151	252607	252607	I	0	" Heaven defend us ! "
252610	252632	253190	253192	the defeated candidate	8498	" Bon jour , mon ange ! I see not the starry upward wings , but the grovelling cloven - hoof . "
253164	253188	253738	253740	Beatrice di Negra	1130	" But who can stand against such wealth as Egerton 's , - no doubt backed , too , by the Treasury purse ? "
253731	253736	253738	253740	Beatrice di Negra	1130	" But , Giulio , "
253746	253779	253790	253791	Giulio Franzini	1087	" even granting that you discover this girl , can you suppose that her father will ever consent to your alliance ? Surely you know too well the nature of your kinsman ? "
253780	253788	253790	253791	Giulio Franzini	1087	" Tu to trompes , ma soeur , "
253803	253855	253738	253740	Beatrice di Negra	1130	" tu to trompes ; I knew it before he had gone through exile and penury . How can I know it now ? But comfort yourself , my too anxious Beatrice , I shall not care for his consent , till I ' ve made sure of his daughter 's . "
253856	253867	253875	253876	the count	18827	" But how win that in despite of the father ? "
253868	253873	253909	253909	he	18827	" Eh , mordieu ! "
253883	253908	253909	253909	he	18827	" what would become of all the comedies ever written , if marriages were not made in despite of the father ? Look you , "
253931	254033	253738	253740	Beatrice di Negra	1130	" look you , this is no question of ifs and buts ! it is a question of must and shall , - a question of existence to you and to me . When Danton was condemned to the guillotine , he said , flinging a pellet of bread at the nose of his respectable judge , ' Mon individu sera bientot dans le neant . ' My patrimony is there already ! I am loaded with debts . I see before me , on the one side , ruin or suicide ; on the other side , wedlock and wealth . "
254034	254067	254074	254075	the count	18827	" But from those vast possessions which you have been permitted to enjoy so long , have you really saved nothing against the time when they might be reclaimed at your hands ? "
254068	254072	254074	254075	the count	18827	" My sister , "
254077	254381	254388	254388	Beatrice	1130	" do I look like a man who saved ? Besides , when the Austrian Emperor , unwilling to raze from his Lombard domains a name and a House so illustrious as our kinsman 's , and desirous , while punishing that kinsman 's rebellion , to reward my adherence , forbore the peremptory confiscation of those vast possessions at which my mouth waters while we speak , but , annexing them to the crown during pleasure , allowed me , as the next of male kin , to retain the revenues of one half for the same very indefinite period , - had I not every reason to suppose that before long I could so influence his Imperial Majesty , or his minister , as to obtain a decree that might transfer the whole , unconditionally and absolutely , to myself ? And methinks I should have done so , but for this accursed , intermeddling English Milord , who has never ceased to besiege the court or the minister with alleged extenuations of our cousin 's rebellion , and proofless assertions that I shared it in order to entangle my kinsman , and betrayed it in order to profit by his spoils . So that , at last , in return for all my services , and in answer to all my claims , I received from the minister himself this cold reply , Count of Peschiera , your aid was important , and your reward has been large . That reward it would not be for your honour to extend , and justify the ill opinion of your Italian countrymen by formally appropriating to yourself all that was forfeited by the treason you denounced . A name so noble as yours should be dearer to you than fortune itself . ' "
254382	254386	254388	254388	Beatrice	1130	" Ah Giulio , "
254401	254421	254432	254432	he	18827	" those were words that might make the demon that tempts to avarice fly from your breast in shame . "
254442	254476	254516	254516	she	473	" Nobody else hears you , my dear Beatrice ; talk commonsense . Heroics sound well in mixed society ; but there is nothing less suited to the tone of a family conversation . "
254511	254515	254516	254516	she	473	" But still , "
254520	254540	254432	254432	he	18827	" you enjoy one half of those ample revenues : why talk , then , of suicide and ruin ? "
254541	254574	254516	254516	she	473	" I enjoy them at the pleasure of the crown ; and what if it be the pleasure of the crown to recall our cousin , and reinstate him in his possessions ? "
254575	254603	254432	254432	he	18827	" There is a probability , then , of that pardon ? When you first employed me in your researches you only thought there was a possibility . "
254604	254903	254516	254516	she	473	" There is a great probability of it , and therefore I am here . I learned some little time since that the question of such recall had been suggested by the emperor , and discussed in Council . The danger to the State , which might arise from our cousin 's wealth , his alleged abilities , - abilities ! bah ! and his popular name , deferred any decision on the point ; and , indeed , the difficulty of dealing with myself must have embarrassed the minister . But it is a mere question of time . He can not long remain excluded from the general amnesty already extended to the other refugees . The person who gave me this information is high in power , and friendly to myself ; and he added a piece of advice on which I acted . ' It was intimated , ' said he , ' by one of the partisans of your kinsman , that the exile could give a hostage for his loyalty in the person of his daughter and heiress ; that she had arrived at marriageable age ; that if she were to we d , with the emperor 's consent , some one whose attachment to the Austrian crown was unquestionable , there would be a guarantee both for the faith of the father , and for the transmission of so important a heritage to safe and loyal hands . Why not ' continued my friend ' apply to the emperor for his consent to that alliance for yourself , - you , on whom he can depend ; you who , if the daughter should die , would be the legal heir to those lands ? ' On that hint I spoke . "
254904	254910	254432	254432	he	18827	" You saw the emperor ? "
254911	254962	254969	254970	the marchesa	7028	" And after combating the unjust prepossessions against me , I stated that so far from my cousin having any fair cause of resentment against me , when all was duly explained to him , I did not doubt that he would willingly give me the hand of his child . "
254963	254967	254979	254980	the count	18827	" You did ! "
254974	254977	254985	254985	he	18827	" And , "
255001	255057	254985	254985	he	18827	" and that I should thus have the happiness of becoming myself the guarantee of my kinsman 's loyalty , the agent for the restoration of his honours , while , in the eyes of the envious and malignant , I should clear up my own name from all suspicion that I had wronged him . "
255058	255064	254985	254985	he	18827	" And the emperor consented ? "
255065	255164	255232	255232	he	18827	" Pardieu , my dear sister , what else could his Majesty do ? My proposition smoothed every obstacle , and reconciled policy with mercy . It remains , therefore , only to find out what has hitherto baffled all our researches , the retreat of our dear kinsfolk , and to make myself a welcome lover to the demoiselle . There is some disparity of years , I own ; but - unless your sex and my glass flatter me overmuch - I am still a match for many a gallant of five - and - twenty . "
255242	255524	255530	255530	Beatrice	1130	" And now , my sister , for some gentle but deserved reproach . Have you not sadly failed me in the task I imposed on your regard for my interests ? Is it not some years since you first came to England on the mission of discovering these worthy relations of ours ? Did I not entreat you to seduce into your toils the man whom I new to be my enemy , and who was indubitably acquainted with our cousin 's retreat , - a secret he has hitherto locked within his bosom ? Did you not tell me , that though he was then in England , you could find no occasion even to meet him , but that you had obtained the friendship of the statesman to whom I directed your attention , as his most intimate associate ? And yet you , whose charms are usually so irresistible , learn nothing from the statesman , as you see nothing of Milord . Nay , baffled and misled , you actually suppose that the quarry has taken refuge in France . You go thither , you pretend to search the capital , the provinces , Switzerland , que sais je ? All in vain , - though - foi de gentilhomme - your police cost me dearly . You return to England ; the same chase , and the same result . Palsambleu , ma soeur , I do too much credit to your talents not to question your zeal . In a word , have you been in earnest , - or have you not had some womanly pleasure in amusing yourself and abusing my trust ? "
255525	255528	255530	255530	Beatrice	1130	" Giulio , "
255534	255590	255599	255600	the count	18827	" you know the influence you have exercised over my character and my fate . Your reproaches are not just . I made such inquiries as were in my power , and I have now cause to believe that I know one who is possessed of this secret , and can guide us to it . "
255591	255597	255232	255232	he	18827	" Ah , you do ! "
255613	255752	255770	255771	the count	18827	" But grant that my heart shrunk from the task you imposed on me , would it not have been natural ? When I first came to England , you informed me that your object in discovering the exiles was one which I could honestly aid . You naturally wished first to know if the daughter lived ; if not , you were the heir . If she did , you assured me you desired to effect , through my mediation , some liberal compromise with Alphonso , by which you would have sought to obtain his restoration , provided he would leave you for life in possession of the grant you hold from the crown . While these were your objects , I did my best , ineffectual as it was , to obtain the information required . "
255753	255768	255964	255965	the marchesa	7028	" And what made me lose so important , though so ineffectual an ally ? "
255788	255901	255924	255924	he	18827	" What ! when you bade me receive and co - operate with the miserable spies - the false Italians - whom you sent over , and seek to entangle this poor exile , when found , in some rash correspondence to be revealed to the court ; when you sought to seduce the daughter of the Count of Peschiera , the descendant of those who had ruled in Italy , into the informer , the corrupter , and the traitress , - no , Giulio , then I recoiled ; and then , fearful of your own sway over me , I retreated into France . I have answered you frankly . "
255918	255922	255924	255924	he	18827	" And this , "
255926	255958	255964	255965	the marchesa	7028	" is your wisdom , and this your gratitude ! You , whose fortunes are bound up in mine ; you , who subsist on my bounty ; you , who - "
255959	255962	255964	255965	the marchesa	7028	" Hold , "
255994	256084	256105	256106	the count	18827	" hold ! Gratitude ! bounty ! Brother , brother ! what , indeed , do I owe to you ? The shame and the misery of a life . While yet a child , you condemned me to marry against my will , against my heart , against my prayers , - and laughed at my tears when I knelt to you for mercy . I was pure then , Giulio , - pure and innocent as the flowers in my virgin crown . And now - now - "
256097	256103	256105	256106	the count	18827	" Now you upbraid me , "
256114	256128	256201	256201	his	18827	" because I gave you in marriage to a man young and noble ? "
256129	256184	256193	256194	the count	18827	" Old in vices , and mean of soul ! The marriage I forgave you . You had the right , according to the customs of our country , to dispose of my hand . But I forgave you not the consolations that you whispered in the ear of a wretched and insulted wife . "
256185	256191	256236	256237	the count	18827	" Pardon me the remark , "
256204	256234	256236	256237	the count	18827	" but those consolations were also conformable to the customs of our country , and I was not aware till now that you had wholly disdained them . And , "
256239	256273	256201	256201	his	18827	" you were not so long a wife that the gall of the chain should smart still . You were soon left a widow , - free , childless , young , beautiful . "
256274	256278	256236	256237	the count	18827	" And penniless . "
256279	256315	256201	256201	his	18827	" True , Di Negra was a gambler , and very unlucky ; no fault of mine . I could neither keep the cards from his hands , nor advise him how to play them . "
256316	256368	256236	256237	the count	18827	" And my own portion ? O Giulio , I knew but at his death why you had condemned me to that renegade Genoese . He owed you money , and , against honour , and I believe against law , you had accepted my fortune in discharge of the debt . "
256369	256405	256201	256201	his	18827	" He had no other way to discharge it ; a debt of honour must be paid , - old stories these . What matters ? Since then my purse has been open to you . "
256406	256434	256236	256237	the count	18827	" Yes , not as your sister , but your instrument , your spy ! Yes , your purse has been open - with a niggard hand . "
256435	256460	256201	256201	his	18827	" Un peu de conscience , ma chere , - you are so extravagant . But come , be plain . What would you ? "
256461	256469	256236	256237	the count	18827	" I would be free from you . "
256470	256496	256525	256525	Beatrice	1130	" That is , you would form some second marriage with one of these rich island lords . Ma foi , I respect your ambition . "
256497	256523	256525	256525	Beatrice	1130	" It is not so high . I aim but to escape from slavery , - to be placed beyond dishonourable temptation . I desire , "
256532	256544	256551	256552	the count	18827	" I desire to re - enter the life of woman . "
256545	256549	256551	256552	the count	18827	" Eno ' ! "
256559	256897	256900	256901	the count	18827	" is there anything in the attainment of your object that should render you indifferent to mine ? You desire to marry , if I comprehend you right . And to marry as becomes you , you should bring to your husband not debts , but a dowry . Be it so . I will restore the portion that I saved from the spendthrift clutch of the Genoese , - the moment that it is mine to bestow , the moment that I am husband to my kinsman 's heiress . And now , Beatrice , you imply that my former notions revolted your conscience ; my present plan should content it , for by this marriage shall our kinsman regain his country , and repossess , at least , half his lands . And if I am not an excellent husband to the demoiselle , it will be her own fault . I have sown my wild oats . Je suis bon prince , when I have things a little my own way . It is my hope and my intention , and certainly it will be my interest , to become digne epoux et irreprochable pere de famille . I speak lightly , - ' t is my way . I mean seriously . The little girl will be very happy with me , and I shall succeed in soothing all resentment her father may retain . Will you aid me then , yes or no ? Aid me , and you shall indeed be free . The magician will release the fair spirit he has bound to his will . Aid me not , ma chere , and mark , I do not threaten - I do but warn - aid me not ; grant that I become a beggar , and ask yourself what is to become of you , - still young , still beautiful , and still penniless ? Nay , worse than penniless ; you have done me the honour , "
256922	256937	256947	256948	the marchesa	7028	" you have done me the honour to consult me as to your debts . "
256938	256945	256947	256948	the marchesa	7028	" You will restore my fortune ? "
256964	256976	256947	256948	the marchesa	7028	" When my own , with your aid , is secured . "
256977	256989	256995	256996	the count	18827	" But do you not overrate the value of my aid ? "
256990	256993	257080	257081	the count	18827	" Possibly , "
257011	257078	257233	257233	Beatrice	1130	" Possibly ; but , by my honour , I wish to repair to you any wrong , real or supposed , I may have done you in past times . I wish to find again my own dear sister . I may over - value your aid , but not the affection from which it comes . Let us be friends , cara Beatrice mia , "
257226	257231	257233	257233	Beatrice	1130	" Ah , Giulio , "
257248	257282	257295	257295	he	18827	" when you speak to me thus , you know you can do with me what you will . Fatherless and motherless , whom had my childhood to love and obey but you ? "
257283	257287	257305	257305	he	18827	" Dear Beatrice , "
257301	257304	257341	257341	you	1130	" So , "
257369	257369	257338	257338	You	1130	"
257370	257400	257341	257341	you	1130	" I think so . You remind me that I have an appointment with him this day : it is near the hour , - I must leave you . "
257401	257431	257338	257338	You	1130	" To learn the secret ? - Quick , quick . I have no fear of your success , if it is by his heart that you lead him ! "
257432	257506	257341	257341	you	1130	" You mistake ; on his heart I have no hold . But he has a friend who loves me , and honourably , and whose cause he pleads . I think here that I have some means to control or persuade him . If not - ah , he is of a character that perplexes me in all but his worldly ambition ; and how can we foreigners influence him through THAT ? "
257507	257517	257338	257338	You	1130	" Is he poor , or is he extravagant ? "
257518	257530	257539	257540	the count	18827	" Not extravagant , and not positively poor , but dependent . "
257531	257537	257539	257540	the count	18827	" Then we have him , "
257544	257588	258051	258051	Apuleius	685	" If his assistance be worth buying , we can bid high for it . Sur mon ame , I never yet knew money fail with any man who was both worldly and dependent . I put him and myself in your hands . "
258045	258049	258051	258051	Apuleius	685	" A gentleman , "
258053	258064	258314	258315	Randal Leslie	570	" ought to wear his whole mind on his forehead . "
258305	258312	258314	258315	Randal Leslie	570	" yet it is always useful , "
258317	258350	258518	258518	his	570	" to know the foibles , the small social and private springs , by which the great are moved . Critical occasions may arise in which such a knowledge may be power . "
258533	258743	258752	258753	the marchesa	7028	" But since you have deigned to confide in me , since when happily for me , and with a generosity of which no coquette could have been capable you , in good time , repressed into friendship feelings that might else have ripened into those you are formed to inspire and disdain to return , you told me with your charming smile , ' Let no one speak to me of love who does not offer me his hand , and with it the means to supply tastes that I fear are terribly extravagant , ' - since thus you allowed me to divine your natural objects , and upon that understanding our intimacy has been founded , you will pardon me for saying that the admiration you excite amongst these grands seigneurs I have named only serves to defeat your own purpose , and scare away admirers less brilliant , but more in earnest . Most of these gentlemen are unfortunately married ; and they who are not belong to those members of our aristocracy who , in marriage , seek more than beauty and wit , - namely , connections to strengthen their political station , or wealth to redeem a mortgage and sustain a title . "
258744	258750	258844	258844	Beatrice	1130	" My dear Mr. Leslie , "
258777	258842	258872	258873	Randal Leslie	570	" I have lived long enough in the real world to appreciate the baseness and the falsehood of most of those sentiments which take the noblest names . I see through the hearts of the admirers you parade before me , and know that not one of them would shelter with his ermine the woman to whom he talks of his heart . Ah , "
258877	259000	259011	259011	Randal	570	" ah , I am less ambitious than you suppose . I have dreamed of a friend , a companion , a protector , with feelings still fresh , undebased by the low round of vulgar dissipation and mean pleasures , - of a heart so new , that it might restore my own to what it was in its happy spring . I have seen in your country some marriages , the mere contemplation of which has filled my eyes with delicious tears . I have learned in England to know the value of home . And with such a heart as I describe , and such a home , I could forget that I ever knew a less pure ambition . "
259001	259009	259011	259011	Randal	570	" This language does not surprise me , "
259013	259026	259033	259033	Beatrice	1130	" yet it does not harmonize with your former answer to me . "
259027	259031	259097	259097	she	1130	" To you , "
259043	259095	259097	259097	she	1130	" to you , - true . But I never had the vanity to think that your affection for me could bear the sacrifices it would cost you in marriage ; that you , with your ambition , could bound your dreams of happiness to home . And then , too , "
259114	259224	259230	259230	Randal	570	" and then , I could not have consented to share my fate with one whom my poverty would cripple . I could not listen to my heart , if it had beat for a lover without fortune , for to him I could then have brought but a burden , and betrayed him into a union with poverty and debt . Now , it may be different . Now I may have the dowry that befits my birth . And now I may be free to choose according to my heart as woman , not according to my necessities , as one poor , harassed , and despairing . "
259225	259228	259230	259230	Randal	570	" Ah , "
259244	259267	259343	259343	Beatrice	1130	" ah , I congratulate you sincerely ; you have cause , then , to think that you shall be - rich ? "
259346	259367	259375	259375	Randal	570	" Not rich for an Englishwoman ; for an Italian , yes . My fortune should be half a million - "
259368	259373	259397	259398	the marchesa	7028	" Half a million ! "
259391	259395	259407	259407	Randal	570	" Of francs ! "
259400	259405	259446	259446	he	570	" Francs ! Ah , "
259423	259445	259491	259491	he	570	" about L20,000 ? eight hundred a year at four per cent . A very handsome portion , certainly Genteel poverty ! "
259451	259490	259491	259491	he	570	" What an escape I have had ! but I see - I see . This will smooth all difficulties in the way of my better and earlier project . I see , - a very handsome portion , "
259496	259648	259656	259657	the marchesa	7028	" not for a grand seigneur , indeed , but still for a gentleman of birth and expectations worthy of your choice , if ambition be not your first object . Ah , while you spoke with such endearing eloquence of feelings that were fresh , of a heart that was new , of the happy English home , you might guess that my thoughts ran to my friend who loves you so devotedly , and who so realizes your ideal . Proverbially , with us , happy marriages and happy homes are found not in the gay circles of London fashion , but at the hearths of our rural nobility , our untitled country gentlemen . And who , amongst all your adorers , can offer you a lot so really enviable as the one whom , I see by your blush , you already guess that I refer to ? "
259649	259654	259656	259657	the marchesa	7028	" Did I blush ? "
259664	259749	259759	259759	Randal	570	" Nay , I think that your zeal for your friend misled you . But I will own frankly , I have been touched by his honest ingenuous love , - so evident , yet rather looked than spoken . I have contrasted the love that honours me with the suitors that seek to degrade ; more I can not say . For though I grant that your friend is handsome , high - spirited , and generous , still he is not what - "
259750	259757	259759	259759	Randal	570	" You mistake , believe me , "
259761	259879	260300	260300	you	8623	" You shall not finish your sentence . He is all that you do not yet suppose him ; for his shyness , and his very love , his very respect for your superiority , do not allow his mind and his nature to appear to advantage . You , it is true , have a taste for letters and poetry rare among your countrywomen . He has not at present - few men have . But what Cimon would not be refined by so fair an Iphigenia ? Such frivolities as he now shows belong but to youth and inexperience of life . Happy the brother who could see his sister the wife of Frank Hazeldean . "
260306	260337	260483	260483	her	1130	" Knowledge is power ; and this man , if as able on a larger field of action , should play no mean part in the history of his time . "
260365	260433	260483	260483	her	1130	" Well , well , grant all you say ! at least before I can listen to so honourable a love , I must be relieved from the base and sordid pleasure that weighs on me . I can not say to the man who wooes me , ' Will you pay the debts of the daughter of Franzini , and the widow of Di Negra ? ' "
260434	260451	260469	260469	her	1130	" Nay , your debts , surely , make so slight a portion of your dowry . "
260452	260461	260483	260483	her	1130	" But the dowry has to be secured ; "
260496	260508	260483	260483	her	1130	" You are , then , truly and sincerely my friend ? "
260509	260515	260483	260483	her	1130	" Can you doubt it ? "
260516	260530	260483	260483	her	1130	" I prove that I do not , for I ask your assistance . "
260531	260536	260483	260483	her	1130	" Mine ? How ? "
260537	260547	260483	260483	her	1130	" Listen ; my brother has arrived in London - "
260548	260558	260483	260483	her	1130	" I see that arrival announced in the papers . "
260559	260636	260643	260643	Randal	570	" And he comes , empowered by the consent of the emperor , to ask the hand of a relation and countrywoman of his , - an alliance that will heal long family dissensions , and add to his own fortunes those of an heiress . My brother , like myself , has been extravagant . The dowry which by law he still owes me it would distress him to pay till this marriage be assured . "
260637	260641	260643	260643	Randal	570	" I understand , "
260645	260654	260483	260483	her	1130	" But how can I aid this marriage ? "
260655	260677	260643	260643	Randal	570	" By assisting us to discover the bride . She , with her father , sought refuge and concealment in England . "
260678	260696	260483	260483	her	1130	" The father had , then , taken part in some political disaffections , and was proscribed ? "
260697	260732	260643	260643	Randal	570	" Exactly ; and so well has he concealed himself , that he has baffled all our efforts to discover his retreat . My brother can obtain him his pardon in cementing this alliance - "
260733	260736	260483	260483	her	1130	" Proceed . "
260737	260784	260797	260797	Randal	570	" Ah , Randal , Randal , is this the frankness of friendship ? You know that I have before sought to obtain the secret of our relation 's retreat , - sought in vain to obtain it from Mr. Egerton , who assuredly knows it - "
260785	260795	260797	260797	Randal	570	" But who communicates no secrets to living man , "
260802	260821	260483	260483	her	1130	" who , close and compact as iron , is as little malleable to me as to you . "
260822	260867	260797	260797	Randal	570	" Pardon me . I know you so well that I believe you could attain to any secret you sought earnestly to acquire . Nay , more , I believe that you know already that secret which I ask you to share with me . "
260868	260877	260938	260939	the marchesa	7028	" What on earth makes you think so ? "
260878	260936	260938	260939	the marchesa	7028	" When , some weeks ago , you asked me to describe the personal appearance and manners of the exile , which I did partly from the recollections of my childhood , partly from the description given to me by others , I could not but notice your countenance , and remark its change ; in spite , "
260951	261034	261042	261042	Randal	570	" in spite of your habitual self - command . And when I pressed you to own that you had actually seen some one who tallied with that description , your denial did not deceive me . Still more , when returning recently , of your own accord , to the subject , you questioned me so shrewdly as to my motives in seeking the clew to our refugees , and I did not then answer you satisfactorily , I could detect - "
261035	261040	261168	261168	Randal	570	" Ha , ha , "
261071	261166	261168	261168	Randal	570	" ha , ha , you have the fault of all observers too minute and refined . But even granting that I may have seen some Italian exiles which is likely enough , what could be more natural than my seeking to compare your description with their appearance ; and granting that I might suspect some one amongst them to be the man you search for , what more natural also than that I should desire to know if you meant him harm or good in discovering his ' whereabout ' ? For ill , "
261177	261228	260938	260939	the marchesa	7028	" ill would it become me to betray , even to friendship , the retreat of one who would hide from persecution ; and even if I did so - for honour itself is a weak safeguard against your fascinations - such indiscretion might be fatal to my future career . "
261229	261232	261168	261168	Randal	570	" How ? "
261233	261346	261481	261481	Randal	570	" Do you not say that Egerton knows the secret , yet will not communicate ; and is he a man who would ever forgive in me an imprudence that committed himself ? My dear friend , I will tell you more . When Audley Egerton first noticed my growing intimacy with you , he said , with his usual dryness of counsel , ' Randal , I do not ask you to discontinue acquaintance with Madame di Negra , for an acquaintance with women like her forms the manners , and refines the intellect ; but charming women are dangerous , and Madame di Negra is - a charming woman . ' "
261356	261479	261481	261481	Randal	570	" ' Your fair acquaintance ' I am still quoting Egerton ' seeks to dis cover the home of a countryman of hers . She suspects that I know it . She may try to learn it through you . Accident may possibly give you the information she requires . Beware how you betray it . By one such weakness I should judge of your general character . He from whom a woman can extract a secret will never be fit for public life . ' Therefore , my dear marchesa , even supposing I possess this secret , you would be no true friend of mine to ask me to reveal what would imperil all my prospects . For as yet , "
261492	261512	261522	261524	Madame di Negra	473	" as yet , I do not stand alone and erect , - I lean , I am dependent . "
261513	261520	261522	261524	Madame di Negra	473	" There may be a way , "
261528	261683	261481	261481	Randal	570	" to communicate this intelligence without the possibility of Mr. Egerton 's tracing our discovery to yourself ; and , though I will not press you further , I add this , - You urge me to accept your friend 's hand ; you seem interested in the success of his suit , and you plead it with a warmth that shows how much you regard what you suppose is his happiness ; I will never accept his hand till I can do so without blush for my penury , - till my dowry is secured ; and that can only be by my brother 's union with the exile 's daughter . For your friend 's sake , therefore , think well how you can aid me in the first step to that alliance . The young lady once discovered , and my brother has no fear for the success of his suit . "
261684	261696	261708	261708	Beatrice	1130	" And you would marry Frank if the dower was secured ? "
261697	261706	261738	261738	he	570	" Your arguments in his favour seem irresistible , "
261741	261770	261738	261738	he	570	" Well , at least you so far reconcile my honour towards aiding your research , that you now inform me you mean no ill to the exile . "
261771	261786	261738	261738	he	570	" Ill ! - the restoration to fortune , honours , his native land ! "
261787	261868	261738	261738	he	570	" And you so far enlist my heart on your side , that you inspire me with the hope to contribute to the happiness of two friends whom I dearly love . I will , therefore , diligently try to ascertain if , among the refugees I have met with , lurk those whom you seek ; and if so , I will thoughtfully consider how to give you the clew . Meanwhile , not one incautious word to Egerton . "
261869	261882	261890	261890	He	570	" Trust me , - I am a woman of the world . "
261898	261927	261937	261938	the marchesa	7028	" This young lady must be heiress to great wealth , to induce a man of your brother 's rank to take so much pains to discover her . "
261928	261935	261937	261938	the marchesa	7028	" Her wealth will be vast , "
261940	261962	261970	261970	Randal	570	" and if anything from wealth or influence in a foreign State could be permitted to prove my brother 's gratitude - "
261963	261968	261979	261979	he	570	" Ah , fie ! "
261991	262001	262469	262469	Egerton	500	" This is reward enough to your preux chevalier . "
262463	262467	262469	262469	Egerton	500	" Why naturally ? "
262471	262492	262498	262498	Egerton	500	" Because you know that Mr. Hazeldean is a relation of mine , - that my grandmother was a Hazeldean . "
262493	262496	262498	262498	Egerton	500	" Ah ! "
262519	262547	262469	262469	Egerton	500	" I was either not aware of that circumstance , or had forgotten it . And your father thinks that the squire may leave you a legacy ? "
262548	262607	262613	262613	Egerton	500	" Oh , sir , my father is not so mercenary , - such an idea never entered his head . But the squire himself has indeed said , ' Why , if anything happened to Frank , you would be next heir to my lands , and therefore we ought to know each other . ' But - "
262608	262611	262613	262613	Egerton	500	" Enough , "
262615	262651	262469	262469	Egerton	500	" I am the last man to pretend to the right of standing between you and a single chance of fortune , or of aid to it . And whom did you meet at Hazeldean ? "
262652	262665	262613	262613	Egerton	500	" There was no one there , sir ; not even Frank . "
262666	262685	262469	262469	Egerton	500	" Hum . Is the squire not on good terms with his parson ? Any quarrel about tithes ? "
262686	262713	262613	262613	Egerton	500	" Oh , no quarrel . I forgot Mr. Dale ; I saw him pretty often . He admires and praises you very much , sir . "
262714	262727	262469	262469	Egerton	500	" Me - and why ? What did he say of me ? "
262728	262780	262613	262613	Egerton	500	" That your heart was as sound as your head ; that he had once seen you about some old parishioners of his , and that he had been much impressed with the depth of feeling he could not have anticipated in a man of the world , and a statesman . "
262781	262797	262469	262469	Egerton	500	" Oh , that was all ; some affair when I was member for Lansmere ? "
262798	262803	262613	262613	Egerton	500	" I suppose so . "
262843	262849	262865	262865	Egerton	500	" I have no objection . "
262876	262910	262920	262920	Randal	570	" Doubtless one of the political refugees ; take care not to set Madame di Negra on his track . Remember , she is suspected of being a spy of the Austrian government . "
262911	262918	262920	262920	Randal	570	" Rely on me , sir , "
262922	262940	262951	262951	Egerton	500	" but I should think this poor doctor can scarcely be the person she seeks to discover . "
262941	262949	262951	262951	Egerton	500	" That is no affair of ours , "
262953	262970	263042	263042	himself	570	" we are English gentlemen , and make not a step towards the secrets of another . "
263034	263038	263051	263051	he	570	" My cards , "
263056	263247	263249	263249	he	8650	" are become difficult to play . On the one hand , to entangle Frank into marriage with this foreigner , the squire could never forgive him . On the other hand , if she will not marry him without the dowry - and that depends on her brother 's wedding this countrywoman - and that countrywoman be , as I surmise , Violante , and Violante be this heiress , and to be won by me ! Tush , tush . Such delicate scruples in a woman so placed and so constituted as Beatrice di Negra must be easily talked away . Nay , the loss itself of this alliance to her brother , the loss of her own dowry , the very pressure of poverty and debt , would compel her into the sole escape left to her option . I will then follow up the old plan ; I will go down to Hazeldean , and see if there be any substance in the new one ; and then to reconcile both . Aha - the House of Leslie shall rise yet from its ruin - and - "
263267	263296	263304	263304	Randal	570	" Why , Randal , you are more absent than when you used to steal away from the cricket - ground , muttering Greek verses , at Eton . "
263297	263302	263304	263304	Randal	570	" My dear Frank , "
263306	263322	263338	263339	Frank Hazeldean	449	" you - you are so brusque , and I was just thinking of you . "
263323	263336	263361	263361	he	449	" Were you ? And kindly , then , I am sure , "
263355	263360	263361	263361	he	449	" and Heaven knows , "
263380	263393	263400	263400	Randal	570	" Heaven knows I want all the kindness you can give me ! "
263394	263398	263400	263400	Randal	570	" I thought , "
263402	263452	263453	263453	FRANK	449	" that your father 's last supply , of which I was fortunate enough to be the bearer , would clear off your more pressing debts . I do n't pretend to preach , but really , I must say once more , you should not be so extravagant . "
263457	263498	263525	263525	RANDAL	570	" I have done my best to reform . I have sold off my horses , and I have not touched dice nor card these six months ; I would not even put into the raffle for the last Derby . "
263528	263559	263560	263560	FRANK	449	" Is it possible ? But with such self - conquest , how is it that you can not contrive to live within the bounds of a very liberal allowance ? "
263564	263627	263525	263525	RANDAL	570	" Why , when a man once gets his head under water , it is so hard to float back again on the surface . You see , I attribute all my embarrassments to that first concealment of my debts from my father , when they could have been so easily met , and when he came up to town so kindly . "
263628	263642	263560	263560	FRANK	449	" I am sorry , then , that I gave you that advice . "
263643	263665	263525	263525	RANDAL	570	" Oh , you meant it so kindly , I do n't reproach you ; it was all my own fault . "
263666	263700	263826	263826	Frank	449	" Why , indeed , I did urge you to pay off that moiety of your debts left unpaid , with your allowance . Had you done so , all had been well . "
263701	263824	263826	263826	Frank	449	" Yes ; but poor Borrowell got into such a scrape at Goodwood , I could not resist him ; a debt of honour , - that must be paid ; so when I signed another bill for him , he could not pay it , poor fellow ! Really he would have shot himself , if I had not renewed it . And now it is swelled to such an amount with that cursed interest , that he never can pay it ; and one bill , of course , begets another , - and to be renewed every three months ; ' t is the devil and all ! So little as I ever got for all I have borrowed , "
263835	263858	263525	263525	RANDAL	570	" Not L1,500 ready money ; and the interest would cost me almost as much yearly , - if I had it . "
263859	263863	263826	263826	Frank	449	" Only L1,500 ! "
263864	263906	263525	263525	RANDAL	570	" Well ; besides seven large chests of the worst cigars you ever smoked , three pipes of wine that no one would drink , and a great bear that had been imported from Greenland for the sake of its grease . "
263907	263923	263934	263934	Frank	449	" That should , at least , have saved you a bill with your hairdresser . "
263924	263932	263976	263976	Frank	449	" I paid his bill with it , "
263936	263974	263976	263976	Frank	449	" and very good - natured he was to take the monster off my hands , - it had already hugged two soldiers and one groom into the shape of a flounder . I tell you what , "
263983	264000	264001	264001	RANDAL	570	" I have a great mind even now to tell my father honestly all my embarrassments . "
264005	264008	264009	264009	FRANK	449	" Hum ! "
264012	264048	264049	264049	RANDAL	570	" What ? do n't you think it would be the best way ? I never can save enough , - never can pay off what I owe ; and it rolls like a snowball . "
264052	264156	264173	264173	Frank	449	" Judging by the squire 's talk , I think that with the first sight of your affairs you would forfeit his favour forever ; and your mother would be so shocked , especially after supposing that the sum I brought you so lately sufficed to pay off every claim on you . If you had not assured her of that it might be different ; but she , who so hates an untruth , and who said to the squire , ' Frank says this will clear him ; and with all his faults , Frank never yet told a lie ! ' "
264157	264171	264173	264173	Frank	449	" Oh , my dear mother ! - I fancy I hear her ! "
264179	264201	264214	264214	Randal	570	" But I did not tell a lie , Randal ; I did not say that that sum would clear me . "
264202	264212	264214	264214	Randal	570	" You empowered and begged me to say so , "
264220	264231	264173	264173	Frank	449	" and do n't blame me if I believed you . "
264232	264248	264214	264214	Randal	570	" No , no ! I only said it would clear me for the moment . "
264249	264292	264313	264313	Frank	449	" I misunderstood you , then , sadly ; and such mistakes involve my own honour . Pardon me , Frank ; do n't ask my aid in future . You see , with the best intentions , I only compromise myself . "
264293	264311	264313	264313	Frank	449	" If you forsake me , I may as well go and throw myself into the river , "
264321	264355	264214	264214	Randal	570	" and sooner or later , my father must know my necessities . The Jews threaten to go to him already ; and the longer the delay , the more terrible the explanation . "
264356	264401	264407	264407	Frank	449	" I do n't see why your father should ever learn the state of your affairs ; and it seems to me that you could pay off these usurers , and get rid of these bills , by raising money on comparatively easy terms - "
264402	264405	264214	264214	Randal	570	" How ? "
264411	264441	264214	264214	Randal	570	" Why , the Casino property is entailed on you , and you might obtain a sum upon that , not to be paid till the property becomes yours . "
264442	264581	264214	264214	Randal	570	" At my poor father 's death ? Oh , no , no ! I can not bear the idea of this cold - blooded calculation on a father 's death . I know it is not uncommon ; I know other fellows who have done it , but they never had parents so kind as mine ; and even in them it shocked and revolted me . The contemplating a father 's death , and profiting by the contemplation it seems a kind of parricide : it is not natural , Randal . Besides , do n't you remember what the Governor said , - he actually wept while he said it , - ' Never calculate on my death ; I could not bear that . ' Oh , Randal , do n't speak of it ! "
264582	264650	264656	264656	Frank	449	" I respect your sentiments ; but still , all the post - orbits you could raise could not shorten Mr. Hazeldean 's life by a day . However , dismiss that idea ; we must think of some other device . Ha , Frank ! you are a handsome fellow , and your expectations are great - why do n't you marry some woman with money ? "
264651	264654	264656	264656	Frank	449	" Pooh ! "
264660	264731	264214	264214	Randal	570	" You know , Randal , that there is but one woman in the world I can ever think of ; and I love her so devotedly , that , though I was as gay as most men before , I really feel as if the rest of her sex had lost every charm . I was passing through the street now - merely to look up at her windows . "
264732	264772	264779	264779	Frank	449	" You speak of Madame di Negra ? I have just left her . Certainly , she is two or three years older than you ; but if you can get over that misfortune , why not marry her ? "
264773	264777	264786	264786	his	449	" Marry her ! "
264793	264801	264214	264214	Randal	570	" Marry her ! Are you serious ? "
264802	264806	264786	264786	his	449	" Why not ? "
264807	264875	264214	264214	Randal	570	" But even if she , who is so accomplished , so admired , even if she would accept me , she is , you know , poorer than myself . She has told me so frankly . That woman has such a noble heart , - and - and - my father would never consent , nor my mother either . I know they would not . "
264876	264883	264786	264786	his	449	" Because she is a foreigner ? "
264884	264889	264214	264214	Randal	570	" Yes - partly . "
264890	264902	264786	264786	his	449	" Yet the squire suffered his cousin to marry a foreigner . "
264903	264960	264214	264214	Randal	570	" That was different . He had no control over Jemima ; and a daughter - in - law is so different ; and my father is so English in his notions ; and Madame di Negra , you see , is altogether so foreign . Her very graces would be against her in his eyes . "
264961	265007	265010	265010	his	449	" I think you do both your parents injustice . A foreigner of low birth - an actress or singer , for instance - of course would be highly objectionable ; but a woman like Madame di Negra , of such high birth and connections - "
265013	265049	265010	265010	his	449	" I do n't think the Governor would care a straw about her connections , if she were a king 's daughter . He considers all foreigners pretty much alike . And then , you know "
265059	265089	265010	265010	his	449	" you know that one of the very reasons why she is so dear to me would be an insuperable objection to the old - fashioned folks at home . "
265090	265099	265109	265110	young Hazeldean	449	" I do n't understand you , Frank . "
265100	265107	265113	265113	his	449	" I love her the more , "
265136	265224	265238	265238	Randal	570	" I love her the more because the world has slandered her name , - because I believe her to be pure and wronged . But would they at the Hall , - they who do not see with a lover 's eyes , they who have all the stubborn English notions about the indecorum and license of Continental manners , and will so readily credit the worst ? Oh , no ! I love , I can not help it - but I have no hope . "
265225	265236	265238	265238	Randal	570	" It is very possible that you may be right , "
265253	265322	265331	265331	Frank	449	" very possible ; and certainly I think that the homely folks at the Hall would fret and fume at first , if they heard you were married to Madame di Negra . Yet still , when your father learned that you had done so , not from passion alone , but to save him from all pecuniary sacrifice , - to clear yourself of debt , to - "
265323	265329	265238	265238	Randal	570	" What do you mean ? "
265335	265487	265511	265511	he	449	" I have reason to know that Madame di Negra will have as large a portion as your father could reasonably expect you to receive with any English wife . And when this is properly stated to the squire , and the high position and rank of your wife fully established and brought home to him , - for I must think that these would tell , despite your exaggerated notions of his prejudices , - and then , when he really sees Madame di Negra , and can judge of her beauty and rare gifts , upon my word , I think , Frank , that there would be no cause for fear . After all , too , you are his only son . He will have no option but to forgive you ; and I know how anxiously both your parents wish to see you settled in life . "
265495	265509	265511	265511	he	449	" There is no one who understands the squire like you , certainly , "
265517	265536	265238	265238	Randal	570	" He has the highest opinion of your judgment . And you really believe you could smooth matters ? "
265537	265683	265708	265708	Frank	449	" I believe so ; but I should be sorry to induce you to run any risk ; and if , on cool consideration , you think that risk is incurred , I strongly advise you to avoid all occasion of seeing the poor marchesa . Ah , you wince ; but I say it for her sake as well as your own . First , you must be aware , that , unless you have serious thoughts of marriage , your attentions can but add to the very rumours that , equally groundless , you so feelingly resent ; and , secondly , because I do n't think any man has a right to win the affections of a woman - especially a woman who seems to me likely to love with her whole heart and soul - merely to gratify his own vanity . "
265684	265706	265708	265708	Frank	449	" Vanity ! Good heavens ! can you think so poorly of me ? But as to the marchesa 's affections , "
265715	265731	265745	265745	Randal	570	" do you really and honestly believe that they are to be won by me ? "
265732	265743	265745	265745	Randal	570	" I fear lest they may be half won already , "
265757	265797	265708	265708	Frank	449	" but she is too proud to let you see any effect you may produce on her , especially when , as I take it for granted , you have never hinted at the hope of obtaining her hand . "
265798	265835	265843	265843	Randal	570	" I never till now conceived such a hope . My dear Randal , all my cares have vanished ! I tread upon air ! I have a great mind to call on her at once . "
265836	265841	265843	265843	Randal	570	" Stay , stay , "
265845	265899	265905	265905	Frank	449	" Let me give you a caution . I have just informed you that Madame di Negra will have , what you suspected not before , a fortune suitable to her birth . Any abrupt change in your manner at present might induce her to believe that you were influenced by that intelligence . "
265900	265903	265945	265945	he	449	" Ah ! "
265917	265944	265945	265945	he	449	" And I feel guilty , - feel as if I was influenced by that intelligence . So I am , too , when I reflect , "
265956	265975	265843	265843	Randal	570	" but I hope she will not be very rich ; if so , I 'll not call . "
265976	266252	265945	265945	he	449	" Make your mind easy , it is but a portion of some twenty or thirty thousand pounds , that would just suffice to discharge all your debts , clear away all obstacle to your union , and in return for which you could secure a more than adequate jointure and settlement on the Casino property . Now I am on that head , I will be yet more communicative . Madame di Negra has a noble heart , as you say , and told me herself , that , until her brother on his arrival had assured her of this dowry , she would never have consented to marry you , never crippled with her own embarrassments the man she loves . Ah ! with what delight she will hail the thought of assisting you to win back your father 's heart ! But be guarded meanwhile . And now , Frank , what say you - would it not be well if I ran down to Hazeldean to sound your parents ? It is rather inconvenient to me , to be sure , to leave town just at present ; but I would do more than that to render you a smaller service . Yes , I 'll go to Rood Hall to - morrow , and thence to Hazeldean . I am sure your father will press me to stay , and I shall have ample opportunities to judge of the manner in which he would be likely to regard your marriage with Madame di Negra , - supposing always it were properly put to him . We can then act accordingly . "
266253	266284	266306	266306	Randal	570	" My dear , dear Randal , how can I thank you ? If ever a poor fellow like me can serve you in return - but that 's impossible . "
266285	266304	266306	266306	Randal	570	" Why , certainly , I will never ask you to be security to a bill of mine , "
266310	266318	266324	266324	Frank	449	" I practise the economy I preach . "
266319	266322	266324	266324	Frank	449	" Ah ! "
266330	266376	265945	265945	he	449	" that is because your mind is cultivated , - you have so many resources ; and all my faults have come from idleness . If I had had anything to do on a rainy day , I should never have got into these scrapes . "
266377	266435	266324	266324	Frank	449	" Oh , you will have enough to do some day managing your property . We who have no property must find one in knowledge . Adieu , my dear Frank , I must go home now . By the way , you have never , by chance , spoken of the Riccaboccas to Madame di Negra . "
266436	266501	266512	266512	Randal	570	" The Riccaboccas ? No . That 's well thought of . It may interest her to know that a relation of mine has married her countryman . Very odd that I never did mention it ; but , to say truth , I really do talk so little to her : she is so superior , and I feel positively shy with her . "
266502	266510	266523	266523	he	570	" Do me the favour , Frank , "
266538	266562	266324	266324	Frank	449	" never to allude to the Riccaboccas either to her or to her brother , to whom you are sure to be presented . "
266563	266570	266324	266324	Frank	449	" Why not allude to them ? "
266602	266636	266324	266324	Frank	449	" Why , I will tell you . The marchesa conceals nothing from her brother , and he is one of the few Italians who are in high favour with the Austrian court . "
266637	266640	266324	266324	Frank	449	" Well ! "
266641	266668	266680	266680	Frank	449	" And I suspect that poor Dr. Riccabocca fled his country from some mad experiment at revolution , and is still hiding from the Austrian police . "
266669	266678	266680	266680	Frank	449	" But they ca n't hurt him here , "
266697	266718	266324	266324	Frank	449	" I should like to see an Austrian pretend to dictate to us whom to receive and whom to reject . "
266719	266775	266791	266791	Frank	449	" Hum - that 's true and constitutional , no doubt ; but Riccabocca may have excellent reasons - and , to speak plainly , I know he has perhaps as affecting the safety of friends in Italy - for preserving his incognito , and we are bound to respect those reasons without inquiring further . "
266776	266789	266858	266858	Frank	449	" Still I can not think so meanly of Madame di Negra , "
266807	266856	266324	266324	Frank	449	" as to suppose that she would descend to be a spy , and injure a poor countryman of her own , who trusts to the same hospitality she receives herself at our English hands . Oh , if I thought that , I could not love her ! "
266863	266943	266858	266858	Frank	449	" Certainly you are right . But see in what a false position you would place both her brother and herself . If they knew Riccabocca 's secret , and proclaimed it to the Austrian Government , as you say , it would be cruel and mean ; but if they knew it and concealed it , it might involve them both in the most serious consequences . You know the Austrian policy is proverbially so jealous and tyrannical ? "
266944	266954	266324	266324	Frank	449	" Well , the newspapers say so , certainly . "
266955	266990	267006	267006	Frank	449	" And , in short , your discretion can do no harm , and your indiscretion may . Therefore , give me your word , Frank . I ca n't stay to argue now . "
266991	267004	266324	266324	Frank	449	" I 'll not allude to the Riccaboccas , upon my honour , "
267026	267026	267036	267036	Randal	570	"
267027	267034	267192	267192	Randal	570	" I rely on your honour , "
267187	267190	267192	267192	Randal	570	" Here , "
267200	267297	267652	267652	he	570	" here , how often , comparing the fertility of the lands passed away from the inheritance of my fathers , with the forlorn wilds that are left to their mouldering Hall , - here how often have I said to myself , ' I will rebuild the fortunes of my House . ' And straightway Toil lost its aspect of drudge , and grew kingly , and books became as living armies to serve my thought . Again - again O thou haughty Past , brace and strengthen me in the battle with the Future . "
267569	267651	267652	267652	he	570	" Then I aspired to be renowned and great ; now , how is it that , so advanced in my career , all that seemed lofty in the end has vanished from me , and the only means that I contemplate are those which my childhood would have called poor and vile ? Ah , is it that I then read but books , and now my knowledge has passed onward , and men contaminate more than books ? But , "
267666	267708	267957	267957	his	667	" if power is only so to be won , - and of what use is knowledge if it be not power - does not success in life justify all things ? And who prizes the wise man if he fails ? "
267969	267985	268003	268003	he	570	" Go to your mammy . That 's Noll Leslie all over . Butter shins ! "
267993	268002	268135	268135	he	667	" The jest of boors - a Leslie ! "
268118	268133	268153	268155	the elder brother	8692	" You are not angry that I was playing at hockey with our neighbours , "
268148	268151	268153	268155	the elder brother	8692	" No , "
268157	268205	268499	268500	Mr. Leslie	570	" but in associating with his inferiors , a gentleman still knows how to maintain his dignity . There is no harm in playing with inferiors , but it is necessary to a gentleman to play so that he is not the laughing - stock of clowns . "
268490	268497	268526	268526	he	8702	" Ha , Randal , boy , "
268506	268525	268526	268526	he	8702	" how d ' ye do ? Who could have expected you ? My dear , my dear , "
268541	268559	268614	268614	he	8702	" here 's Randal , and he 'll be wanting dinner , or supper , or something . "
268603	268612	268614	268614	he	8702	" You are growing very pretty , Juliet , "
268621	268648	268585	268585	he	8702	" why do yourself such injustice , - why not pay more attention to your appearance , as I have so often begged you to do ? "
268649	268675	268685	268685	Randal	570	" I did not expect you , dear Randal ; you always come so suddenly , and catch us en dish - a - bill . "
268676	268683	268685	268685	Randal	570	" Dish - a - bill ! "
268691	268702	268722	268724	the young lady	4386	" Dishabille ! you ought never to be so caught ! "
268703	268720	268748	268748	Randal	570	" No one else does so catch us , - nobody else ever comes . Heigho ! "
268729	268746	268858	268858	she	612	" Patience , patience ; my day is coming , and then yours , my sister , "
268847	268857	268858	268858	she	612	" La , how you do shake my nerves , "
268871	268918	268929	268929	Randal	570	" And you are hungry too , and nothing in the house but cold mutton ! Jenny , Jenny , I say , Jenny ! Juliet , have you seen Jenny ? Where 's Jenny ? Out with the odd man , I 'll be bound . "
268919	268927	268929	268929	Randal	570	" I am not hungry , Mother , "
268931	268939	268964	268964	She	623	" I wish for nothing but tea . "
268959	268963	268999	269000	Mr. Leslie	570	" tidy herself . "
268988	268997	269023	269024	The pigs	8717	" Take care they do n't come down , "
269006	269022	269041	269043	the young man	5338	" Oh , Sir , I am very light ; nothing comes down with me . "
269036	269039	269041	269043	the young man	5338	" Mother , "
269059	269084	269041	269043	the young man	5338	" Mother , you should not let Oliver associate with those village boors . It is time to think of a profession for him . "
269085	269120	269169	269171	the elder brother	8692	" Oh , he eats us out of house and home - such an appetite ! But as to a profession , what is he fit for ? He will never be a scholar . "
269161	269167	269169	269171	the elder brother	8692	" There is the army , "
269174	269203	269169	269171	the elder brother	8692	" a gentleman 's calling . How handsome Juliet ought to be - but - I left money for masters - and she pronounces French like a chambermaid . "
269204	269225	269169	269171	the elder brother	8692	" Yet she is fond of her book too . She 's always reading , and good for nothing else . "
269226	269233	269253	269254	Mrs. Leslie	612	" Reading ! those trashy novels ! "
269234	269251	269253	269254	Mrs. Leslie	612	" So like you , - you always come to scold , and make things unpleasant , "
269258	269289	269301	269301	Randal	570	" You are grown too fine for us , and I am sure we suffer affronts enough from others , not to want a little respect from our own children . "
269290	269299	269301	269301	Randal	570	" I did not mean to affront you , "
269305	269316	269559	269559	she	624	" Pardon me . But who else has done so ? "
269553	269558	269573	269573	his	1498	" Not at home , "
269582	269592	269642	269643	Mrs. Leslie	612	" in a state not fit to be seen . "
269632	269640	269735	269736	Mr. Leslie	570	" as if we were her cottagers ! "
269750	269765	269805	269805	Randal	570	" I wish we had a good sum of money , Randal , boy ! "
269815	269824	269919	269921	The poor gentleman	8746	" Do you , Sir ? - why ? "
269825	269918	269937	269937	Randal	570	" The manors of Rood and Dulmansberry , and all the lands therein , which my great - grandfather sold away , are to be sold again when Squire Thornhill 's eldest son comes of age , to cut off the entail . Sir John Spratt talks of buying them . I should like to have them back again ! ' T is a shame to see the Leslie estates hawked about , and bought by Spratts and people . I wish I had a great , great sum of ready money . "
269959	269968	269937	269937	Randal	570	" When does young Thornhill come of age ? "
269969	270024	270041	270041	Randal	570	" He was nineteen last August . I know it , because the day he was born I picked up my fossil of the sea - horse , just by Dulmansberry church , when the joy - bells were ringing . My fossil sea - horse ! It will be an heirloom , Randal - "
270025	270039	270123	270123	Randal	570	" Two years - nearly two years - yet - ah , ah ! "
270110	270121	270123	270123	Randal	570	" Be patient , patient still , my dear sister , "
270125	270136	270240	270240	she	612	" and keep your heart whole for two years longer . "
270266	270268	270240	270240	she	612	" riches "
270270	270272	270279	270279	he	570	" money "
270291	270322	270336	270336	Randal	570	" A Spratt should not have what belonged to my great - great - grandfather . If I had a good sum of ready money ! the old family estates ! "
270347	270350	270279	270279	he	570	" money , "
270351	270354	270336	270336	Randal	570	" Spratt , "
270355	270362	270336	270336	Randal	570	" great - great - grandfather , "
270363	270367	270279	270279	he	570	" rich wife , "
270368	270372	270715	270715	Riccabocca	463	" family estates ; "
270719	270743	270756	270756	her	800	" All here is so secure from evil ! - the waves of the fountain are never troubled like those of the river ! "
270762	270787	270791	270791	RANDAL	570	" But the fountain would be but a lifeless pool , oh my father , if the spray did not mount towards the skies ! "
270794	270811	270834	270834	he	8768	" I fear , Signor Riccabocca , that I am guilty of some want of ceremony . "
270812	270827	270875	270875	Randal	570	" To dispense with ceremony is the most delicate mode of conferring a compliment , "
270864	270873	270875	270875	Randal	570	" I am on my way to Hazeldean , "
270877	270892	270893	270893	RICCOBOCCA	1151	" and , seeing you in the garden , could not resist this intrusion . "
270896	270923	270924	270924	RANDAL	570	" YOU come from London ? Stirring times for you English , but I do not ask you the news . No news can affect us . "
270928	270932	270933	270933	RICCABOCCA	463	" Perhaps yes . "
270937	270940	270941	270941	VIOLANTE	800	" How ? "
270944	270963	270964	270964	RICCABOCCA	463	" Surely he speaks of Italy , and news from that country affects you still , my father . "
270967	271006	271028	271028	Riccabocca	463	" Nay , nay , nothing affects me like this country ; its east winds might affect a pyramid ! Draw your mantle round you , child , and go in ; the air has suddenly grown chill . "
271050	271074	271028	271028	Riccabocca	463	" So you think that you have news that might affect me ? Corpo di Bacco ! I am curious to learn what ? "
271075	271098	271122	271122	Randal	570	" I may be mistaken - that depends on your answer to one question . Do you know the Count of Peschiera ? "
271117	271120	271122	271122	Randal	570	" Enough , "
271124	271163	271172	271172	Riccabocca	463	" I see that I am right . Believe in my sincerity . I speak but to warn and to serve you . The count seeks to discover the retreat of a countryman and kinsman of his own . "
271164	271170	271211	271211	he	463	" And for what end ? "
271205	271210	271211	271211	he	463	" But - pooh ! "
271225	271261	271304	271304	he	570	" it matters not to me . I grant , sir , that I know the Count di Peschiera ; but what has Dr. Riccabocca to do with the kinsman of so grand a personage ? "
271262	271270	271304	271304	he	570	" Dr. Riccabocca - nothing . But - "
271307	271319	271333	271333	Randal	570	" Need I say that your secret is safe with me ? "
271336	271361	271362	271362	RICCABOCCA	463	" And I shall esteem it the highest honour you can bestow on me , to be permitted to assist you in forestalling danger . "
271366	271424	271442	271442	RANDAL	570	" Sir , I thank you ; you have my secret , and I feel assured it is safe , for I speak to an English gentleman . There may be family reasons why I should avoid the Count di Peschiera ; and , indeed , he is safest from shoals who steers clearest of his relations . "
271445	271484	271485	271485	RICCABOCCA	463	" I know little of the Count of Peschiera save from the current talk of the world . He is said to hold the estates of a kinsman who took part in a conspiracy against the Austrian power . "
271488	271527	271528	271528	RANDAL	570	" It is true . Let that content him ; what more does he desire ? You spoke of forestalling danger ; what danger ? I am on the soil of England , and protected by its laws . "
271531	271560	271561	271561	RICCABOCCA	463	" Allow me to inquire if , had the kinsman no child , the Count di Peschiera would be legitimate and natural heir to the estates he holds ? "
271564	271571	271572	271572	RANDAL	570	" He would - What then ? "
271575	271589	271590	271590	Riccabocca	463	" Does that thought suggest no danger to the child of the kinsman ? "
271597	271624	271685	271685	he	570	" The child ! You do not mean to imply that this man , infamous though he be , can contemplate the crime of an assassin ? "
271678	271683	271685	271685	he	570	" I did not , "
271690	271745	271752	271752	Riccabocca	463	" mean to insinuate so horrible a charge against a man whom I have never seen . He seeks you , - that is all I know . I imagine , from his general character , that in this search he consults his interest . Perhaps all matters might be conciliated by an interview ! "
271746	271750	271752	271752	Riccabocca	463	" An interview ! "
271754	271774	271685	271685	he	570	" there is but one way we should meet , - foot to foot , and hand to hand . "
271775	271812	271868	271868	he	3298	" Is it so ? Then you would not listen to the count if he proposed some amicable compromise , - if , for instance , he was a candidate for the hand of your daughter ? "
271863	271867	271868	271868	he	3298	" My daughter ! "
271871	271881	271895	271895	he	570	" Sir , your very question is an insult . "
271890	271894	271895	271895	he	570	" Forgive me , "
271899	272022	272033	272033	Riccabocca	463	" I will tell you frankly all that I know . I am acquainted with the count 's sister . I have some little influence over her . It was she who informed me that the count had come here , bent upon discovering your refuge , and resolved to we d your daughter . This is the danger of which I spoke . And when I asked your permission to aid in forestalling it , I only intended to suggest that it might be wise to find some securer home , and that I , if permitted to know that home , and to visit you , could apprise you from time to time of the count 's plans and movements . "
272023	272031	272033	272033	Riccabocca	463	" Sir , I thank you sincerely , "
272038	272046	271895	271895	he	570	" but am I not safe here ? "
272047	272099	272106	272106	Riccabocca	463	" I doubt it . Many people have visited the squire in the shooting season , who will have heard of you , - perhaps seen you , and who are likely to meet the count in London . And Frank Hazeldean , too , who knows the count 's sister - "
272100	272104	272106	272106	Riccabocca	463	" True , true "
272108	272149	272178	272180	the young traitor	8778	" I see , I see . I will consider , I will reflect . Meanwhile you are going to Hazel dean . Do not say a word to the squire . He knows not the secret you have discovered . "
272166	272176	272282	272282	Randal	570	" At all times command and rely on me , "
272271	272280	272282	272282	Randal	570	" It will be indeed in my favour , "
272289	272318	272331	272332	the squire	1498	" if I can get them into the neighbourhood of London , - all occasion there to woo , and if expedient , to win , the heiress . "
272322	272329	272401	272401	he	1498	" Br the Lord , Harry ! "
272362	272399	272401	272401	he	1498	" by the Lord , if that is not Randal Leslie trying to get into the park at the back gate ! Hollo , Randal ! you must come round by the lodge , my boy , "
272403	272415	272422	272422	Randal	570	" You see this gate is locked to keep out trespassers . "
272416	272420	272422	272422	Randal	570	" A pity , "
272424	272440	272449	272450	the squire	1498	" I like short cuts , and you have shut up a very short one . "
272441	272447	272449	272450	the squire	1498	" So the trespassers said , "
272452	272489	272513	272513	she	2403	" but Stirn insisted on it - valuable man , Stirn . But ride round to the lodge . Put up your horse , and you 'll join us before we can get to the house . "
272506	272511	272513	272513	she	2403	" Ah , William , "
272517	272531	272543	272544	the squire	1498	" though certainly Randal Leslie means well , I always dread his visits . "
272532	272541	272543	272544	the squire	1498	" So do I , in one sense , "
272546	272559	272572	272573	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" for he always carries away a bank - note for Frank . "
272560	272570	272572	272573	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" I hope he is really Frank 's friend , "
272575	272630	272638	272639	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" Who 's else can he be ? Not his own , poor fellow , for he will never accept a shilling from me , though his grandmother was as good a Hazeldean as I am . But , zounds , I like his pride , and his economy too . As for Frank - "
272631	272636	272822	272822	Randal	570	" Hush , William ! "
272817	272820	272822	272822	Randal	570	" For , "
272824	272847	272922	272923	the squire	1498	" knowing that you will excuse my morning dress , I venture to invite myself to dine and sleep at the Hall . "
272915	272920	272922	272923	the squire	1498	" Ha , ha , "
272927	272985	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" I long to see how you 'll astonish Stirn . Why , you 'll guess in a moment where we put the top - dressing ; and when you come to handle my short - horns , I dare swear you 'll know to a pound how much oil - cake has gone into their sides . "
272986	273027	273033	273034	the squire	1498	" Oh , you do me too much honour , - indeed you do . I only know the general principles of agriculture ; the details are eminently interesting , but I have not had the opportunity to acquire them . "
273028	273031	273033	273034	the squire	1498	" Stuff ! "
273036	273070	273088	273088	He	570	" How can a man know general principles unless he has first studied the details ? You are too modest , my boy . Ho ! there 's Stirn looking out for us ! "
273100	273118	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" Well , sir , perhaps Frank may soon gratify your wish , and turn farmer himself . "
273119	273122	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" Eh ! "
273131	273135	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" what now ? "
273136	273143	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" Suppose he were to marry ? "
273144	273271	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" I 'd give him the two best farms on the property rent free . Ha , ha ! Has he seen the girl yet ? I 'd leave him free to choose ; sir , I chose for myself , - every man should . Not but what Miss Stick - to - rights is an heiress , and , I hear , a very decent girl , and that would join the two properties , and put an end to that law - suit about the right of way , which began in the reign of King Charles the Second , and is likely otherwise to last till the day of judgment . But never mind her ; let Frank choose to please himself . "
273272	273301	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" I 'll not fail to tell him so , sir . I did fear you might have some prejudices . But here we are at the farmyard . "
273302	273334	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" Burn the farmyard ! How can I think of farmyards when you talk of Frank 's marriage ? Come on - this way . What were you saying about prejudices ? "
273335	273350	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" Why , you might wish him to marry an Englishwoman , for instance . "
273351	273367	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" English ! Good heavens , sir , does he mean to marry a Hindoo ? "
273368	273399	273411	273412	The squire	1498	" Nay , I do n't know that he means to marry at all ; I am only surmising ; but if he did fall in love with a foreigner - "
273400	273410	273424	273424	Randal	570	" A foreigner ! Ah , then Harry was - "
273416	273422	273424	273424	Randal	570	" Who might , perhaps , "
273437	273448	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" who might , perhaps , speak very little English ? "
273449	273455	273424	273424	Randal	570	" Lord ha ' mercy ! "
273456	273462	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" And a Roman Catholic - "
273463	273476	273424	273424	Randal	570	" Worshipping idols , and roasting people who do n't worship them . "
273477	273487	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" Signor Riccabocca is not so bad as that . "
273488	273602	273424	273424	Randal	570	" Rickeybockey ! Well , if it was his daughter ! But not speak English ! and not go to the parish church ! By George , if Frank thought of such a thing , I 'd cut him off with a shilling . Do n't talk to me , sir ; I would . I ' m a mild man , and an easy man ; but when I say a thing , I say it , Mr. Leslie . Oh , but it is a jest , - you are laughing at me . There 's no such painted good - for - nothing creature in Frank 's eye , eh ? "
273603	273650	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" Indeed , sir , if ever I find there is , I will give you notice in time . At present , I was only trying to ascertain what you wished for a daughter - in - law . You said you had no prejudice . "
273651	273664	273424	273424	Randal	570	" No more I have , - not a bit of it . "
273665	273676	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" You do n't like a foreigner and a Catholic ? "
273677	273683	273424	273424	Randal	570	" Who the devil would ? "
273684	273693	273124	273125	the squire	1498	" But if she had rank and title ? "
273694	273739	273424	273424	Randal	570	" Rank and title ! Bubble and squeak ! No , not half so good as bubble and squeak . English beef and good cabbage . But foreign rank and title ! - foreign cabbage and beef ! - foreign bubble and foreign squeak ! "
273756	273763	273424	273424	Randal	570	" You must have an Englishwoman ? "
273764	273768	273424	273424	Randal	570	" Of course . "
273769	273772	273424	273424	Randal	570	" Money ? "
273773	273797	273424	273424	Randal	570	" Do n't care , provided she is a tidy , sensible , active lass , with a good character for her dower . "
273798	273807	273424	273424	Randal	570	" Character - ah , that is indispensable ? "
273808	273841	274076	274076	Randal	570	" I should think so , indeed . A Mrs. Hazeldean of Hazeldean - You frighten me . He 's not going to run off with a divorced woman , or a - "
274064	274075	274120	274120	Jackeymo	485	" Sare , sare , let me speak vid you . "
274110	274118	274174	274174	Jackeymo	485	" Speak - a - you Italian ? "
274168	274171	274184	274184	himself	485	" Sir , "
274191	274259	274268	274268	Randal	570	" I am but a poor man ; my name is Giacomo . You have heard of me ; servant to the signore whom you saw to - day , - only a servant ; but he honours me with his confidence . We have known danger together ; and of all his friends and followers , I alone came with him to the stranger 's land . "
274260	274266	274286	274286	He	16200	" Good , faithful fellow , "
274297	274297	274343	274343	Jackeymo	485	"
274298	274341	274346	274346	himself	485	" He did . Ah , sir ; the padrone was too proud to ask you to explain more , - too proud to show fear of another . But he does fear , he ought to fear , he shall fear , "
274352	274408	274414	274414	Randal	570	" for the padrone has a daughter , and his enemy is a villain . Oh , sir , tell me all that you did not tell to the padrone . You hinted that this man might wish to marry the signora . Marry her ! - I could cut his throat at the altar ! "
274409	274412	274414	274414	Randal	570	" Indeed , "
274416	274425	274346	274346	himself	485	" I believe that such is his object . "
274426	274457	274414	274414	Randal	570	" But why ? He is rich , she is penniless , - no , not quite that , for we have saved - but penniless , compared to him . "
274458	274532	274543	274544	the servant	3272	" My good friend , I know not yet his motives ; but I can easily learn them . If , however , this count be your master 's enemy , it is surely well to guard against him , whatever his designs ; and to do so , you should move into London or its neighbourhood . I fear that , while we speak , the count may get upon his track . "
274533	274541	274414	274414	Randal	570	" He had better not come here ! "
274558	274588	274414	274414	Randal	570	" Beware of your own anger , Giacomo . One act of violence , and you would be transported from England , and your mast'r would lose a friend . "
274596	274629	274739	274739	Jackeymo	485	" And if the padrone were to meet him , do you think the padrone would meekly say , ' Come sta sa Signoria ' ? The padrone would strike him dead ! "
274630	274738	274739	274739	Jackeymo	485	" Hush ! hush ! You speak of what in England is called murder , and is punished by the gallows . If you really love your master , for Heaven 's sake get him from this place , get him from all chance of such passion and peril . I go to town to - morrow ; I will find him a house , that shall be safe from all spies , all discovery . And there , too , my friend . I can do what I can not at this distance , - watch over him , and keep watch also on his enemy . "
274770	274791	274739	274739	Jackeymo	485	" Signore , I think you have seen the padrone twice . Why do you take this interest in him ? "
274792	274811	274831	274831	Randal	570	" Is it so uncommon to take interest even in a stranger who is menaced by some peril ? "
274826	274829	274835	274835	himself	570	" Besides , "
274843	274875	274889	274889	Jackeymo	485	" besides , I am a friend and connection of Mr. Egerton ; and Mr. Egerton 's most intimate friend is Lord L'Estrange ; and I have heard that Lord L'Estrange - "
274876	274887	274892	274892	his	485	" The good lord ! Oh , now I understand , "
274896	274915	275013	275013	Randal	570	" Ah , if he were in England ! But you will let us know when he comes ? "
274916	274941	274892	274892	his	485	" Certainly . Now , tell me , Giacomo , is this count really unprincipled and dangerous ? Remember I know him not personally . "
274942	274950	274991	274991	himself	485	" He has neither heart nor conscience . "
274951	274988	275010	275010	Jackeymo	485	" That defect makes him dangerous to men ; perhaps not less so to women . Could it be possible , if he obtained any interview with the signora , that he could win her affections ? "
274998	275009	275013	275013	Randal	570	" I have heard that he is still very handsome . "
275016	275027	274892	274892	his	485	" Enough ; persuade the padrone to come to town . "
275028	275037	275013	275013	Randal	570	" But if the count is in town ? "
275038	275068	274892	274892	his	485	" That makes no difference ; the safest place is always the largest city . Everywhere else , a foreigner is in himself an object of attention and curiosity . "
275069	275072	275013	275013	Randal	570	" True . "
275073	275128	274892	274892	his	485	" Let your master , then , come to London , or rather , into its neighbourhood . He can reside in one of the suburbs most remote from the count 's haunts . In two days I will have found him a lodging and write to him . You trust to me now ? "
275129	275153	275013	275013	Randal	570	" I do indeed , - I do , Excellency . Ah , if the signorina were married , we would not care ! "
275154	275163	274892	274892	his	485	" Married ! But she looks so high ! "
275164	275173	275185	275185	he	485	" Alas ! not now ! not here ! "
275212	275257	275339	275339	Randal	570	" Find the house , Signore , write to the padrone . He shall come . I 'll talk to him . I can manage him . Holy San Giacomo , bestir thyself now , - ' t is long since I troubled thee ! "
275331	275337	275339	275339	Randal	570	" He is always well , "
275341	275350	275360	275361	the parson	1499	" I believe he is made of iron . "
275351	275358	275368	275368	Randal	570	" His heart is of gold , "
275363	275366	275368	275368	Randal	570	" Ah , "
275372	275398	275426	275427	Mr. Dale	446	" you told me you had come in contact with him once , respecting , I think , some of your old parishioners at Lansmere ? "
275411	275424	275339	275339	Randal	570	" Do you remember your battle by the stocks , Mr. Leslie ? "
275436	275467	275399	275400	The parson	1499	" Indeed , yes . By the way , now you speak of it , I met my old opponent in London the first year I went up to it . "
275468	275474	275339	275339	Randal	570	" You did ! where ? "
275475	275489	275399	275400	The parson	1499	" At a literary scamp 's , - a cleverish man called Burley . "
275490	275506	275339	275339	Randal	570	" Burley ! I have seen some burlesque verses in Greek by a Mr. Burley . "
275507	275541	275399	275400	The parson	1499	" No doubt the same person . He has disappeared , - gone to the dogs , I dare say . Burlesque Greek is not a knowledge very much in power at present . "
275542	275555	275339	275339	Randal	570	" Well , but Leonard Fairfield - you have seen him since ? "
275556	275559	275399	275400	The parson	1499	" No . "
275560	275566	275339	275339	Randal	570	" Nor heard of him ? "
275567	275573	275399	275400	The parson	1499	" No ; have you ? "
275574	275598	275339	275339	Randal	570	" Strange to say , not for a long time . But I have reason to believe that he must be doing well . "
275599	275606	275399	275400	The parson	1499	" You surprise me ! Why ? "
275607	275623	275339	275339	Randal	570	" Because two years ago he sent for his mother . She went to him . "
275624	275629	275399	275400	The parson	1499	" Is that all ? "
275630	275650	275679	275680	Mrs. Dale	470	" It is enough ; for he would not have sent for her if he could not maintain her . "
275722	275762	275763	275763	RANDAL	570	" A glass of wine , Mr. Leslie . You were saying , before dinner , that burlesque Greek is not a knowledge very much in power at present . Pray , Sir , what knowledge is in power ? "
275767	275771	275772	275772	PARSON	445	" Practical knowledge . "
275775	275779	275780	275780	RANDAL	570	" What of ? "
275783	275786	275787	275787	PARSON	445	" Men . "
275791	275822	275823	275823	RANDAL	570	" Well , I suppose that is the most available sort of knowledge , in a worldly point of view . How does one learn it ? Do books help ? "
275826	275838	275839	275839	PARSON	445	" According as they are read , they help or injure . "
275842	275853	275854	275854	RANDAL	570	" How should they be read in order to help ? "
275857	275869	275870	275870	PARSON	445	" Read specially to apply to purposes that lead to power . "
275883	275918	275926	275927	the squire	1498	" Upon my word , Sir , you express yourself very well . I must own that I began these questions in the hope of differing from you ; for I like an argument . "
275919	275924	275926	275927	the squire	1498	" That he does , "
275929	275935	275936	275936	PARSON	445	" the most contradictory creature ! "
275939	275967	275968	275968	Randal	570	" Argument is the salt of talk . But now I am afraid I must agree with you , which I was not at all prepared for . "
275973	275988	275989	275989	PARSON	445	" No two men of our education can dispute upon the application of knowledge . "
275996	276003	276004	276004	RANDAL	570	" Eh ? - what to ? "
276007	276013	276014	276014	PARSON	445	" Power , of course . "
276018	276038	276039	276039	RANDAL	570	" Power ! - the vulgarest application of it , or the loftiest ? But you mean the loftiest ? "
276048	276061	276062	276062	PARSON	445	" What do you call the loftiest , and what the vulgarest ? "
276065	276078	276079	276079	Randal	570	" The vulgarest , self - interest ; the loftiest , beneficence . "
276092	276135	276136	276136	SQUIRE	884	" You speak , Sir , as a clergyman should do . I admire your sentiment , and adopt it ; but I fear that the knowledge which aims only at beneficence very rarely in this world gets any power at all . "
276140	276174	276175	276175	PARSON	445	" That 's true ; I never get my own way when I want to do a kindness , and Stirn always gets his when he insists on something diabolically brutal and harsh . "
276178	276202	276203	276203	RANDAL	570	" Pray , Mr. Leslie , what does intellectual power refined to the utmost , but entirely stripped of beneficence , most resemble ? "
276206	276239	276240	276240	PARSON	445	" Resemble ? - I can hardly say . Some very great man - almost any very great man - who has baffled all his foes , and attained all his ends . "
276243	276310	276311	276311	RANDAL	570	" I doubt if any man has ever become very great who has not meant to be beneficent , though he might err in the means . Caesar was naturally beneficent , and so was Alexander . But intellectual power refined to the utmost , and wholly void of beneficence , resembles only one being , and that , sir , is the Principle of Evil . "
276315	276322	276323	276323	PARSON	445	" Do you mean the Devil ? "
276326	276361	276362	276364	MRS . DALE	470	" Yes , Sir , the Devil ; and even he , Sir , did not succeed ! Even he , Sir , is what your great men would call a most decided failure . "
276367	276374	276375	276375	PARSON	445	" My dear , my dear ! "
276378	276396	276712	276712	Randal	570	" Our religion proves it , my love ; he was an angel , and he fell . "
276701	276710	276730	276731	Mrs. Dale	470	" And what work interests you so much ? "
276719	276728	276750	276750	Randal	570	" One you have read , of course , "
276752	276763	276778	276778	he	570	" It has made a great sensation , I believe . "
276773	276776	276778	276778	he	570	" True , "
276780	276801	276802	276804	MRS . DALE	470	" I have heard much of it in London , but I have not yet had time to read it . "
276807	276837	276838	276838	PARSON	445	" I can lend it to you , if you like to look over it to - night , and you can leave it for me with Mrs. Hazeldean . "
276842	276865	276866	276866	RANDAL	570	" Oh , that book ! - yes , you must read it . I do not know a work more instructive . "
276869	276903	276904	276904	PARSON	445	" Instructive ! Certainly I will read it then . But I thought it was a mere work of amusement , - of fancy . It seems so as I look over it . "
276907	276923	276924	276924	RANDAL	570	" So is the ' Vicar of Wakefield ; ' yet what book more instructive ? "
276927	276960	276961	276961	PARSON	445	" I should not have said that of the ' Vicar of Wakefield . ' A pretty book enough , though the story is most improbable . But how is it instructive ? "
276964	277031	277039	277041	MRS . DALE	470	" By its results : it leaves us happier and better . What can any instruction do more ? Some works instruct through the head , some through the heart . The last reach the widest circle , and often produce the most genial influence on the character . This book belongs to the last . You will grant my proposition when you have read it . "
277044	277051	277052	277052	RANDAL	570	" Is the author known yet ? "
277055	277074	277075	277075	PARSON	445	" I have heard it ascribed to many writers , but I believe no one has claimed it . "
277078	277107	277108	277110	MRS . DALE	470	" I think it must have been written by my old college friend , Professor Moss , the naturalist , - its descriptions of scenery are so accurate . "
277113	277151	277152	277154	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" La , Charles dear ! that snuffy , tiresome , prosy professor ? How can you talk such nonsense ? I am sure the author must be young , there is so much freshness of feeling . "
277158	277165	277166	277166	PARSON	445	" Yes , certainly , young . "
277172	277244	277245	277247	MRS . DALE	470	" I should say just the contrary . Its tone is too serene , and its style too simple , for a young man . Besides , I do n't know any young man who would send me his book , and this book has been sent me , very handsomely bound , too , you see . Depend upon it Moss is the loan - quite his turn of mind . "
277250	277268	277269	277269	RANDAL	570	" You are too provoking , Charles dear ! Mr. Moss is so remarkably plain , too . "
277272	277279	277280	277280	PARSON	445	" Must an author be handsome ? "
277283	277296	277303	277303	SQUIRE	884	" Ha ! ha ! Answer that if you can , Carry . "
277309	277341	277342	277344	MRS . DALE	470	" Well , I do n't think there 's much in the book , whoever wrote it ; for I 've read it myself , and understand every word of it . "
277347	277377	277378	277380	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" I do n't see why you should suppose it was written by a man at all . For my part , I think it must be a woman . "
277383	277402	277403	277403	PARSON	445	" Yes , there 's a passage about maternal affection , which only a woman could have written . "
277406	277483	277484	277484	SQUIRE	884	" Pooh ! pooh ! I should like to see a woman who could have written that description of an August evening before a thunderstorm ; every wild - flower in the hedgerow exactly the flowers of August , every sign in the air exactly those of the month . Bless you ! a woman would have filled the hedge with violets and cowslips . Nobody else but my friend Moss could have written that description . "
277487	277519	277520	277522	MRS . DALE	470	" I do n't know ; there 's a simile about the waste of corn - seed in hand - sowing , which makes me think he must be a farmer ! "
277526	277544	277545	277547	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" A farmer ! In hobnailed shoes , I suppose ! I say it is a woman . "
277550	277558	277559	277559	PARSON	445	" A WOMAN , and A MOTHER ! "
277562	277573	277574	277574	SQUIRE	884	" A middle - aged man , and a naturalist . "
277577	277657	277658	277658	RANDAL	570	" No , no , Parson , certainly a young man ; for that love - scene puts me in mind of my own young days , when I would have given my ears to tell Harry how handsome I thought her ; and all I could say was , ' Fine weather for the crops , Miss. ' Yes , a young man and a farmer . I should not wonder if he had held the plough himself . "
277668	277705	277711	277712	the parson	1499	" This sketch of Night in London comes from a man who has lived the life of cities and looked at wealth with the eyes of poverty . Not bad ! I will read the book . "
277706	277709	277711	277712	the parson	1499	" Strange , "
277716	277804	277817	277817	Randal	570	" that this little work should so have entered into our minds , suggested to all of us different ideas , yet equally charmed all , - given a new and fresh current to our dull country life , animated us as with the sight of a world in our breasts we had never seen before save in dreams : a little work like this by a man we do n't know and never may ! Well , that knowledge is power , and a noble one ! "
277805	277815	278027	278027	he	570	" A sort of power , certainly , sir , "
278022	278025	278027	278027	he	570	" Tut ! "
278038	278093	278233	278234	the lady	2294	" it was not to sympathize with Hector , but to conquer with Achilles , that Alexander of Macedon kept Homer under his pillow . Such should be the true use of books to him who has the practical world to subdue ; let parsons and women construe it otherwise , as they may ! "
278228	278231	278233	278234	the lady	2294	" Pray , "
278249	278272	278273	278273	RANDAL	570	" what is all this you have been saying to my husband as to the possibility of Frank 's marrying a foreigner ? "
278276	278291	278292	278294	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" Would you be as averse to such a notion as Mr. Hazeldean is ? "
278297	278309	278472	278472	her	497	" You ask me a question , instead of answering mine . "
278481	278489	278472	278472	her	497	" Out with it , Mr. Leslie ! "
278490	278537	278543	278544	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" Out with what , my dear madam ? The squire has sadly exaggerated the importance of what was said mainly in jest . But I will own to you plainly , that Frank has appeared to me a little smitten with a certain fair Italian . "
278538	278541	278568	278568	she	497	" Italian ! "
278546	278566	278609	278610	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" Well , I said so from the first . Italian ! - that 's all , is it ? "
278603	278607	278609	278610	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" And perhaps , "
278620	278632	278640	278640	Randal	570	" you have noticed this in Frank since he was here ? "
278633	278638	278640	278640	Randal	570	" It is true , "
278642	278656	278663	278664	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" but I think his heart or his fancy was touched even before . "
278657	278661	278663	278664	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" Very natural , "
278666	278763	278769	278769	Randal	570	" how could he help it ? - such a beautiful creature ! Well , I must not ask you to tell Frank 's secrets ; but I guess the object of attraction ; and though she will have no fortune to speak of , and it is not such a match as he might form , still she is so amiable , and has been so well brought up , and is so little like one 's general notions of a Roman Catholic , that I think I could persuade Hazeldean into giving his consent . "
278764	278767	278786	278787	Mrs. Ilazeldean	1163	" Ah , "
278791	278824	278833	278834	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" I am very much relieved and rejoiced to hear this ; and I may venture to give Frank some hope , if I find him disheartened and desponding , poor fellow ? "
278825	278831	278833	278834	Mrs. Hazeldean	497	" I think you may , "
278839	278893	278894	278894	RANDAL	570	" But you should not have frightened poor William so , hinting that the lady knew very little English . She has an accent , to be sure ; but she speaks our tongue very prettily . I always forget that she 's not English born ! Ha , ha , poor William ! "
278897	278902	278903	278905	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" Ha , ha ! "
278908	278927	278928	278928	RANDAL	570	" We had once thought of another match for Frank , - a girl of good English family . "
278931	278935	278936	278938	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" Miss Sticktorights ? "
278941	279012	279013	279013	RANDAL	570	" No ; that 's an old whim of Hazeldean 's . But I doubt if the Sticktorights would ever merge their property in ours . Bless you ! it would be all off the moment they came to settlements , and had to give up the right of way . We thought of a very different match ; but there 's no dictating to young hearts , Mr. Leslie . "
279016	279077	279078	279080	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" Indeed no , Mrs. Hazeldean . But since we now understand each other so well , excuse me if I suggest that you had better leave things to themselves , and not write to Frank on the subject . Young hearts , you know , are often stimulated by apparent difficulties , and grow cool when the obstacle vanishes . "
279083	279185	279078	279080	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" Very possibly ; it was not so with Hazeldean and me . But I shall not write to Frank on the subject for a different reason - though I would consent to the match , and so would William ; yet we both would rather , after all , that Frank married an Englishwoman , and a Protestant . We will not , therefore , do anything to encourage the idea . But if Frank 's happiness becomes really at stake , then we will step in . In short , we would neither encourage nor oppose . You understand ? "
279186	279189	279078	279080	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" Perfectly . "
279190	279241	279078	279080	MRS . HAZELDEAN	497	" And in the mean while , it is quite right that Frank should see the world , and try to distract his mind , or at least to know it . And I dare say it has been some thought of that kind which has prevented his coming here . "
279257	279277	280532	280532	she	800	" Pardon me , but I must hurry over breakfast , and be back in time to catch the coach "
280516	280525	280532	280532	she	800	" I hear him sigh at this distance , "
280538	280570	280828	280838	the emissaries of a perfidious enemy , hot in the chase	8949	" and methinks this is a new grief , and not for his country . He spoke twice yesterday of that dear English friend , and wished that he were here . "
280846	280881	281142	281142	him	503	" You have your child to save ! Fly on ! Another league , and you are beyond the borders . We will delay the foes with parley ; they will not harm us . "
281147	281155	281249	281249	he	646	" So sad , yet so young ! "

281356	281376	281354	281354	himself	742	" I have resolved to leave for a time this retreat , and to seek the neighbourhood of London . "
281377	281426	281435	281435	Riccabocca	742	" Ah , dear father , that , then , was your thought ? But what can be your reason ? Do not turn away ; you know how care fully I have obeyed your command and kept your secret . Ah , you will confide in me . "
281427	281433	281435	281435	Riccabocca	742	" I do , indeed , "
281440	281485	281354	281354	himself	742	" I leave this place in the fear lest my enemies discover me . I shall say to others that you are of an age to require teachers not to be obtained here , but I should like none to know where we go . "
281507	281526	281493	281493	his	1688	" My mother - so Violante always called Jemima - my mother - you have spoken to her ? "
281527	281536	281550	281550	Violante	800	" Not yet . THERE is the difficulty . "
281537	281548	281550	281550	Violante	800	" No difficulty , for she loves you so well , "
281556	281573	281583	281583	Riccabocca	742	" Ah , why not also confide in her ? Who so true , so good ? "
281574	281581	281583	281583	Riccabocca	742	" Good - I grant it ! "
281585	281626	281583	281583	Riccabocca	742	" What then ? ' Da cattiva Donna guardati , ed alla buona non fidar niente . ' - From the bad woman , guard thyself ; to the good woman trust nothing . - And if you must trust , "
281632	281641	281647	281647	Violante	800	" trust her with anything but a secret ! "
281642	281645	281654	281654	she	800	" Fie , "
281670	281688	281757	281757	Riccabocca	742	" fie on your consistency , Padre Carissimo . Do you not trust your secret to me ? "
281689	281750	281781	281784	the pupil of Machiavelli	8979	" You ! A kitten is not a cat , and a girl is not a woman . Besides , the secret was already known to you , and I had no choice . Peace , Jemima will stay here for the present . See to what you wish to take with you ; we shall leave to - night . "
281775	281779	281821	281821	you	8981	" Anima mia , "
281826	281847	281772	281773	his wife	1782	" Anima mia , soul of my being , you have already seen that Violante mopes herself to death here . "
281848	281858	281821	281821	you	8981	" She , poor child ! Oh , no ! "
281859	281886	281772	281773	his wife	1782	" She does , core of my heart , - she does , and is as ignorant of music as I am of tent - stitch . "
281887	281892	281821	281821	you	8981	" She sings beautifully . "
281893	281947	281772	281773	his wife	1782	" Just as birds do , against all the rules , and in defiance of gamut . Therefore , to come to the point , O treasure of my soul ! I am going to take her with me for a short time , perhaps to Cheltenham or Brighton . We shall see . "
281948	281966	281821	281821	you	8981	" All places with you are the same to me , Alphonso . When shall we go ? "
281967	281988	281994	281995	the wife	2339	" We shall go to - night ; but terrible as it is to part from you , - you - "

282054	282090	282123	282123	she	742	" Carissima , do not grieve so ; we shall be back soon , and travelling is expensive ; rolling stones gather no moss , and there is so much to see to at home . "
282119	282122	282123	282123	she	742	" Alphonso , "
282127	282256	282262	282262	Riccabocca	742	" hear me ! What you think good , that shall ever be good to me . But do not think that I grieve solely because of our parting . No ; I grieve to think that , despite all these years in which I have been the partner of your hearth , and slept on your breast , - all these years in which I have had no thought but , however humbly , to do my duty to you and yours , and could have wished that you had read my heart , and seen there but yourself and your child , - I grieve to think that you still deem me as unworthy your trust as when you stood by my side at the altar . "
282257	282260	282291	282291	he	8987	" Trust ! "
282270	282290	282291	282291	he	8987	" why do you say ' trust ' ? In what have I distrusted you ? I am sure , "
282301	282360	282389	282389	she	742	" that I never doubted your fidelity , hook - nosed , long - visaged foreigner though I be ; never pryed into your letters ; never inquired into your solitary walks ; never heeded your flirtations with that good - looking Parson Dale ; never kept the money ; and never looked into the account - books ! "
282383	282388	282389	282389	she	742	" Can you think , "
282408	282557	282558	282559	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" can you think that I could have watched and thought and taxed my poor mind so constantly , to conjecture what might best soothe or please you , and not seen , long since , that you have secrets known to your daughter , your servant , not to me ? Fear not , - the secrets can not be evil , or you would not tell them to your innocent child . Besides , do I not know your nature ; and do I not love you because I know it ? - it is for something connected with those secrets that you leave your home . You think that I should be incautious , imprudent . You will not take me with you . Be it so . I go to prepare for your departure . Forgive me if I have displeased you , husband . "
282573	282618	282632	282632	Riccabocca	742	" O Father , can you resist this ? Trust her ! trust her ! - I am a woman like her ! I answer for her woman 's faith . Be yourself , - ever nobler than all others , my own father . "
282619	282630	282632	282632	Riccabocca	742	" Diavolo ! Never one door shuts but another opens , "
282634	282661	282706	282706	she	800	" Are you a fool , child ? Do n't you see that it was for your sake only I feared , and would be cautious ? "
282662	282701	282742	282755	the Italian , whose heart had been yearning to repay such tenderness and devotion	8990	" For mine ! Oh , then do not make me deem myself mean , and the cause of meanness . For mine ! Am I not your daughter , - the descendant of men who never feared ? "
282730	282740	282742	282755	the Italian , whose heart had been yearning to repay such tenderness and devotion	8990	" Jemima , wife mine ! pardon , pardon , "

283214	283249	283295	283296	the servant	3272	" because you are in Mr. Egerton 's confidence , and he may give you some verbal message besides a written reply . Egerton is often over cautious and brief in the litera scripta . "
283299	283321	283295	283296	the servant	3272	" Dr. F - - - is with him , sir ; and perhaps he may not like to be disturbed . "

283331	283358	283486	283486	he	500	" Not that I know of , sir . He never says he is ill . But he has looked poorly the last day or two . "
283476	283485	283500	283500	he	500	" Who 's that ? How dare you ? "
283512	283528	283486	283486	he	500	" I beg pardon for my abruptness ; what do you want , Mr. Leslie ? "
283529	283552	283561	283561	Egerton	500	" This letter from Lord - ; I was told to deliver it immediately into your own hands . I beg pardon - "

284621	284679	284616	284617	The baron	17518	" I hear , Mr. Leslie , that you have much influence over this same Hazeldean . His affairs are in a sad state . I should be very happy to be of use to him , as a relation of my friend Egerton 's ; but he understands business so well that he despises my advice . "
284680	284689	284616	284617	The baron	17518	" I am sure you do him injustice . "
284690	284793	284896	284897	the minister	2115	" Injustice ! I honour his caution . I say to every man , ' Do n't come to me : I can get you money on much easier terms than any one else ; and what 's the result ! You come so often that you ruin yourself ; whereas a regular usurer without conscience frightens you . ' Cent percent , ' you say ; ' oh , I must pull in . ' If you have influence over your friend , tell him to stick to his bill - brokers , and have nothing to do with Baron Levy . "
284891	284894	284896	284897	the minister	2115	" Leslie , "
284903	284925	284863	284864	The servant	3272	" take this back to Lord - - - , and say that I shall be with him in an hour . "
284926	284938	284896	284897	the minister	2115	" No other message ? - he seemed to expect one . "
284939	284982	284983	284983	Egerton	500	" I dare say he did . Well , my letter is official , my message is not : beg him to see Mr. - - - before we meet , - he will understand , - all rests upon that interview . "
284993	285039	284896	284897	the minister	2115	" Of course you will not mention to any one that Dr. F - - - was with me : the health of public men is not to be suspected . Hum , - were you in your own room or the ante - room ? "
285040	285048	285049	285049	Egerton	500	" The ante - room , sir . "
285055	285064	284896	284897	the minister	2115	" And Mr. Levy was there , eh ? "
285065	285071	285049	285049	Egerton	500	" Yes - the baron . "
285072	285096	285205	285213	the idler who , nodding languidly to his visitor	9103	" Baron ! true . Come to plague me about the Mexican loan , I suppose . I will keep you no longer . "
285217	285229	285205	285213	the idler who , nodding languidly to his visitor	9103	" Levy , what money can I have for a year ? "
285230	285260	285205	285213	the idler who , nodding languidly to his visitor	9103	" The estate will bear very little more . My dear fellow , that last election was the very devil . You can not go on thus much longer . "
285261	285266	285270	285271	Audley Egerton	500	" My dear fellow ! "
285273	285277	285311	285311	Egerton	500	" my dear fellow "
285297	285309	285311	285311	Egerton	500	" I shall not want to go on thus much longer , "
285325	285336	285414	285415	Baron Levy	1175	" The estate must , meanwhile , bear L5,000 more . "
285337	285350	285311	285311	Egerton	500	" A hard pull on it . You had really better sell . "
285351	285384	285414	285415	Baron Levy	1175	" I can not afford to sell at present . I can not afford men to say , ' Audley Egerton is done up , - his property is for sale . ' "
285385	285406	285311	285311	Egerton	500	" It is very sad when one thinks what a rich man you have been - and may be yet ! "
285407	285413	285414	285415	Baron Levy	1175	" Be yet ! How ? "
285436	285476	285482	285482	Egerton	500	" Why , you know that , with three words from you , I could produce an effect upon the stocks of three nations , that might give us each a hundred thousand pounds . We would go shares . "
285477	285480	285482	285482	Egerton	500	" Levy , "
285494	285535	285557	285557	he	9106	" you are a scoundrel ; that is your look - out . I interfere with no man 's tastes and conscience . I do n't intend to be a scoundrel myself . I have told you that long ago . "
285552	285555	285585	285585	Levy	1175	" Well , "
285559	285583	285585	285585	Levy	1175	" you are neither wise nor complimentary , but you shall have the money . But yet , would it not be better , "
285590	285602	285619	285619	he	500	" to borrow it without interest , of your friend L'Estrange ? "
285609	285618	285619	285619	he	500	" You mean to taunt me , sir ! "
285623	285635	285585	285585	Levy	1175	" I accept pecuniary favours from Lord L'Estrange ! - I ! "
285636	285662	285668	285668	Egerton	500	" Tut , my dear Egerton , I dare say my Lord would not think so ill now of that act in your life which - "
285663	285666	285668	285668	Egerton	500	" Hold ! "
285672	285675	285676	285676	He	500	" Hold ! "
285690	285701	285725	285725	he	500	" To blush before this man ! Chastisement , chastisement ! "
285717	285723	285725	285725	he	500	" Look you , Levy , "
285731	285742	285712	285713	The minister	2115	" you hate me - why , I know not . "
285743	285805	285725	285725	he	500	" Hate you ! How have I shown hatred ? Would you ever have lived in this palace , and ruled this country as one of the most influential of its ministers , but for my management , my whispers to the wealthy Miss Leslie ? Come , but for me what would you have been , - perhaps a beggar . "
285806	285882	285892	285892	Levy	1175	" What shall I be now , if I live ? And this fortune which my marriage brought to me - it has passed for the main part into your hands . Be patient , you will have it all ere long . But there is one man in the world who has loved me from a boy , and woe to you if ever he learn that he has the right to despise me ! "
285883	285890	285892	285892	Levy	1175	" Egerton , my good fellow , "
285898	285988	285725	285725	he	500	" you need not threaten me , for what interest can I possibly have in tale - telling to Lord L'Estrange ? Again , dismiss from your mind the absurd thought that I hate you . True , you snub me in private , you cut me in public , you refuse to come to my dinners , you 'll not ask me to your own ; still , there is no man I like better , nor would more willingly serve . When do you want the L5,000 ? "
285989	286009	285892	285892	Levy	1175	" Perhaps in one month , perhaps not for three or four . Let it be ready when required . "
286010	286023	285725	285725	he	500	" Enough ; depend on it . Have you any other commands ? "
286024	286027	285892	285892	Levy	1175	" None . "
286028	286055	285725	285725	he	500	" I will take my leave , then . By - the - by , what do you suppose the Hazeldean rental is worth - net ? "
286056	286073	285892	285892	Levy	1175	" I do n't know , nor care . You have no designs upon that too ? "
286074	286092	286187	286187	he	573	" Well , I like keeping up family connections . Mr. Frank seems a liberal young gentleman . "
286190	286205	286248	286248	he	573	" Thank Heaven , not for long , - it will not last long . "
286237	286246	286287	286291	a leader of the Opposition	9117	" So - I must shun all emotion ! "
286277	286285	286287	286291	a leader of the Opposition	9117	" That man is made of bronze , "
286302	286312	286515	286515	I	0	" What would I not give for his nerves ! "
286466	286471	286762	286762	his	9150	" ON PUBLIC LIFE , "
286766	286800	286811	286811	he	9150	" How grateful we ought to be for that fiery particle which is crackling and hissing under the boiler . It helps us on a fraction of an inch from Vauxhall to Putney ! "
286815	286832	287067	287067	I	0	" Not sixteen miles an hour ! What the deuce is the matter with the stoker ? "
287062	287066	287132	287132	thou	9158	" Public Life ; "
287136	287153	287556	287556	he	1688	" I have not lived in vain , - the Popkins Question is carried at last ! "
287549	287554	287898	287899	the doctor	1651	" Forewarned is forearmed , "
287853	287896	287925	287926	a Cornelia	894	" There is a man come over to England on purpose to woo and win you . For Heaven 's sake take care of him ; he is diabolically handsome ; he never fails where he sets his heart . - Cospetto ! "
287935	287966	288308	288308	he	570	" No , he resolved to say nothing to Violante of the count 's intention , only to keep guard , and make himself and Jackeymo all eyes and all ears .
288314	288332	288340	288341	the wife	2339	" Happy is the man who has no children ! Thrice happy he who has no girls ! "
288333	288338	288386	288386	Riccabocca	742	" My dear Alphonso ! "
288403	288427	288441	288442	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" One blunderbuss , four pistols , and a house - dog called Pompey , who would have made mincemeat of Julius Caesar ! "
288428	288439	288441	288442	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" He certainly eats a great deal , does Pompey ! "
288446	288454	288469	288469	Riccabocca	742	" But if he relieves your mind ! "
288455	288467	288469	288469	Riccabocca	742	" He does not relieve it in the least , ma'am , "
288471	288545	288594	288594	she	528	" and that is the point I am coming to . This is a most harassing life , and a most undignified life . And I who have only asked from Heaven dignity and repose ! But if Violante were once married , I should want neither blunderbuss , pistol , nor Pompey . And it is that which would relieve my mind , cara mia , - Pompey only relieves my larder . "
288610	288688	288716	288716	Riccabocca	742	" Indeed , my love , since you dread so much though I own that I must think unreasonably this wicked , dangerous man , it would be the happiest thing in the world to see dear Violante well married ; because , you see , if she is married to one person she can not be married to another ; and all fear of this count , as you say , would be at an end . "
288689	288714	288723	288724	the wife	2339	" You can not express yourself better . It is a great comfort to unbosom one's - self to a wife , after all , "
288718	288721	288723	288724	the wife	2339	" But , "
288732	288750	288760	288760	Riccabocca	742	" but where and how can we find a husband suitable to the rank of your daughter ? "
288751	288758	288760	288760	Riccabocca	742	" There ! there ! there ! "
288774	288806	288822	288823	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" that comes of unbosoming one's - self ! Out flies one secret ; it is opening the lid of Pandora 's box ; one is betrayed , ruined , undone ! "
288807	288820	288891	288892	The doctor	1651	" Why , there 's not a soul that can hear us ! "
288827	288890	288938	288938	Riccabocca	742	" ' That 's chance , ma'am ! If you once contract the habit of blabbing out a secret when nobody 's by , how on earth can you resist it when you have the pleasurable excitement of telling it to all the world ? Vanity , vanity , - woman 's vanity ! Woman never could withstand rank , - never ! "
288950	289052	288938	288938	Riccabocca	742	" I have done with all pomp and pretension . Besides , the young man is a born gentleman : he seems in good circumstances ; he has energy and latent ambition ; he is akin to L'Estrange 's intimate friend : he seems attached to Violante . I do n't think it probable that we could do better . Nay , if Peschiera fears that I shall be restored to my country , and I learn the wherefore , and the ground to take , through this young man - why , gratitude is the first virtue of the noble ! "
289053	289063	288938	288938	Riccabocca	742	" You speak , then , of Mr. Leslie ? "
289064	289073	289074	289075	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" To be sure - of whom else ? "
289084	289100	289125	289125	Riccabocca	742	" Now you have told me that , I will observe him with different eyes . "
289101	289123	289152	289152	Jemima	528	" Anima mia , I do n't see how the difference of your eyes will alter the object they look upon ! "
289135	289150	289152	289152	Jemima	528	" The object alters when we see it in a different point of view ! "
289156	289191	289203	289203	Riccabocca	742	" This thread does very well when I look at it in order to sew on a button , but I should say it would never do to tie up Pompey in his Kennel . "
289192	289201	289212	289212	Jemima	528	" Reasoning by illustration , upon my soul ! "
289207	289210	289212	289212	Jemima	528	" And , "
289214	289306	289367	289368	the sage	3893	" when I am to regard one who is to constitute the happiness of that dear child , and for life , can I regard him as I would the pleasant guest of an evening ? Ah , trust me , Alphonso ; I do n't pretend to be wise like you ; but when a woman considers what a man is likely to prove to woman , - his sincerity , his honour , his heart , - oh , trust me , she is wiser than the wisest man ! "
289361	289365	289449	289449	he	9224	" My dear , "
289370	289440	290500	290501	the squire	1498	" I vow and declare that Machiavelli was a fool to you . And I have been as dull as the chair I sit upon , to deny myself so many years the comfort and counsel of such a - But , corpo di Bacco ! forget all about rank ; and so now to bed . - One must not holloa till one 's out of the wood , "
290505	290511	290641	290645	the wily and able traitor	9278	" I do n't care . "
290636	290639	290641	290645	the wily and able traitor	9278	" For , "
290647	290741	290840	290840	he	570	" though we may be sure of Mrs. Hazeldean 's consent , and her power over your father , when the step is once taken , yet we can not count for certain on the squire , he is so choleric and hasty . He might hurry to town , see Madame di Negra , blurt out some passionate , rude expressions , which would wake her resentment , and cause her instant rejection . And it might be too late if he repented afterwards , as he would be sure to do . "
290830	290839	290840	290840	he	570	" the persons he had thought of were , "
290843	290850	291098	291098	each	6469	" quite different from her description ; "
291102	291117	291279	291280	the count	18827	" This is a very remarkable rascal ; am I a match for him ? "
291165	291277	291279	291280	the count	18827	" You have never been abroad , my dear sir ? You must contrive to visit me at Vienna . I grant the splendour of your London world ; but , honestly speaking , it wants the freedom of ours , - a freedom which unites gayety with polish . For as your society is mixed , there are pretension and effort with those who have no right to be in it , and artificial condescension and chilling arrogance with those who have to keep their inferiors at a certain distance . With us , all being of fixed rank and acknowledged birth , familiarity is at once established . Hence , "
291289	291310	291322	291322	Randal	570	" hence there is no place like Vienna for a young man , no place like Vienna for bonnes fortunes . "
291311	291320	291372	291372	he	18827	" Those make the paradise of the idle , "
291324	291370	291385	291386	the count	18827	" but the purgatory of the busy . I confess frankly to you , my dear count , that I have as little of the leisure which becomes the aspirer to bonnes fortunes as I have the personal graces which obtain them without an effort ; "
291380	291383	291385	291386	the count	18827	" So , "
291388	291399	291374	291374	his	18827	" woman is not his weak side . What is ? "
291400	291452	291460	291460	Randal	570	" Morbleu ! my dear Mr. Leslie , had I thought as you do some years since , I had saved myself from many a trouble . After all , Ambition is the best mistress to woo ; for with her there is always the hope , and never the possession . "
291453	291458	291460	291460	Randal	570	" Ambition , Count , "
291469	291484	291490	291491	the count	18827	" is the luxury of the rich , and the necessity of the poor . "
291485	291488	291490	291491	the count	18827	" Aha , "
291493	291510	291538	291539	the count	18827	" it comes , as I anticipated from the first , - comes to the bribe . "
291528	291536	291538	291539	the count	18827	" Sur mon ame , mon cher , "
291541	291639	291490	291491	the count	18827	" luxury is ever pleasanter than necessity ; and I am resolved at least to give Ambition a trial ; je vais me refugier dans le sein du bonheur domestique , - a married life and a settled home . Peste ! If it were not for ambition , one would die of ennui . A propos , my dear sir , I have to thank you for promising my sister your aid in finding a near and dear kinsman of mine , who has taken refuge in your country , and hides himself even from me . "
291640	291697	291538	291539	the count	18827	" I should be most happy to assist in your search . As yet , however , I have only to regret that all my good wishes are fruitless . I should have thought , however , that a man of such rank had been easily found , even through the medium of your own ambassador . "
291698	291735	291751	291751	Randal	570	" Our own ambassador is no very warm friend of mine ; and the rank would be no clew , for it is clear that my kinsman has never assumed it since he quitted his country . "
291736	291749	291751	291751	Randal	570	" He quitted it , I understand , not exactly from choice , "
291755	291827	291833	291834	the count	18827	" Pardon my freedom and curiosity , but will you explain to me a little more than I learn from English rumour which never accurately reports upon foreign matters still more notorious , how a person who had so much to lose , and so little to win , by revolution , could put himself into the same crazy boat with a crew of hair - brained adventurers and visionary professors . "
291828	291831	292061	292062	the count	18827	" Professors ! "
291836	292059	292061	292062	the count	18827	" I think you have hit on the very answer to your question ; not but what men of high birth were as mad as the canaille . I am the more willing to gratify your curiosity , since it will perhaps serve to guide your kind search in my favour . You must know , then , that my kinsman was not born the heir to the rank he obtained . He was but a distant relation to the head of the House which he afterwards represented . Brought up in an Italian university , he was distinguished for his learning and his eccentricities . There too , I suppose , brooding over old wives ' tales about freedom , and so forth , he contracted his carbonaro , chimerical notions for the independence of Italy . Suddenly , by three deaths , he was elevated , while yet young , to a station and honours which might have satisfied any man in his senses . Que diable ! what could the independence of Italy do for him ? He and I were cousins ; we had played together as boys ; but our lives had been separated till his succession to rank brought us necessarily together . We became exceedingly intimate . And you may judge how I loved him , "
292076	292099	292146	292146	his	18827	" when I add , that I forgave him for enjoying a heritage that , but for him , had been mine . "
292100	292108	292061	292062	the count	18827	" Ah , you were next heir ? "
292109	292131	292137	292137	Randal	570	" And it is a hard trial to be very near a great fortune , and yet just to miss it . "
292132	292135	292169	292170	the count	18827	" True , "
292161	292167	292169	292170	the count	18827	" Harder still , perhaps , "
292178	292198	292061	292062	the count	18827	" harder still might it have been to some men to forgive the rival as well as the heir . "
292199	292204	292169	292170	the count	18827	" Rival ! how ? "
292205	292238	292061	292062	the count	18827	" A lady , who had been destined by her parents to myself , though we had never , I own , been formally betrothed , became the wife of my kinsman . "
292239	292247	292169	292170	the count	18827	" Did he know of your pretensions ? "
292248	292346	292061	292062	the count	18827	" I do him the justice to say he did not . He saw and fell in love with the young lady I speak of . Her parents were dazzled . Her father sent for me . He apologized , he explained ; he set before me , mildly enough , certain youthful imprudences or errors of my own , as an excuse for his change of mind ; and he asked me not only to resign all hope of his daughter , but to conceal from her new suitor that I had ever ventured to hope . "
292347	292352	292169	292170	the count	18827	" And you consented ? "
292353	292357	292061	292062	the count	18827	" I consented . "
292358	292406	292412	292413	the count	18827	" That was generous . You must indeed have been much attached to your kinsman . As a lover , I can not comprehend it ; perhaps , my dear count , you may enable me to understand it better - as a man of the world . "
292407	292410	292412	292413	the count	18827	" Well , "
292421	292432	292440	292440	Randal	570	" I suppose we are both men of the world ? "
292433	292438	292473	292474	the count	18827	" Both ! certainly , "
292458	292471	292473	292474	the count	18827	" As a man of the world , then , I own , "
292484	292518	292440	292440	Randal	570	" that if I could not marry the lady myself and that seemed to me clear , it was very natural that I should wish to see her married to my wealthy kinsman . "
292519	292535	292547	292548	the count	18827	" Very natural ; it might bring your wealthy kinsman and yourself still closer together . "
292536	292545	292440	292440	Randal	570	" This is really a very clever fellow ! "
292557	292714	292440	292440	Randal	570	" Enfin , to cut short a long story , my cousin afterwards got entangled in attempts , the failure of which is historically known . His projects were detected , himself denounced . He fled , and the emperor , in sequestrating his estates , was pleased , with rare and singular clemency , to permit me , as his nearest kinsman , to enjoy the revenues of half those estates during the royal pleasure ; nor was the other half formally confiscated . It was no doubt his Majesty 's desire not to extinguish a great Italian name ; and if my cousin and his child died in exile , why , of that name , I , a loyal subject of Austria , - I , Franzini , Count di Peschiera , would become the representative . Such , in a similar case , has been sometimes the Russian policy towards Polish insurgents . "
292715	292757	292440	292440	Randal	570	" I comprehend perfectly ; and I can also conceive that you , in profiting so largely , though so justly , by the fall of your kinsman , may have been exposed to much unpopularity , even to painful suspicion . "
292758	292847	292440	292440	Randal	570	" Entre nous , mon cher , I care not a stiver for popularity ; and as to suspicion , who is he that can escape from the calumny of the envious ? But , unquestionably , it would be most desirable to unite the divided members of our house ; and this union I can now effect by the consent of the emperor to my marriage with my kinsman 's daughter . You see , therefore , why I have so great an interest in this research ? "
292848	292903	292440	292440	Randal	570	" By the marriage articles you could no doubt secure the retention of the half you hold ; and if you survive your kinsman , you would enjoy the whole . A most desirable marriage ; and , if made , I suppose that would suffice to obtain your cousin 's amnesty and grace ? "
292904	292909	292440	292440	Randal	570	" You say it . "
292910	292943	292954	292955	the count	18827	" But even without such marriage , since the emperor 's clemency has been extended to so many of the proscribed , it is perhaps probable that your cousin might be restored ? "
292944	292952	292954	292955	the count	18827	" It once seemed to me possible , "
292959	293047	292440	292440	Randal	570	" but since I have been in England , I think not . The recent revolution in France , the democratic spirit rising in Europe , tend to throw back the cause of a proscribed rebel . England swarms with revolutionists ; my cousin 's residence in this country is in itself suspicious . The suspicion is increased by his strange seclusion . There are many Italians here who would aver that they had met with him , and that he was still engaged in revolutionary projects . "
293048	293053	293118	293119	The count	18827	" Aver - untruly ? "
293054	293117	293241	293241	he	570	" Ma foi , it comes to the same thing ; ' les absents ont toujours tort . ' I speak to a man of the world . No ; without some such guarantee for his faith as his daughter 's marriage with myself would give , his recall is improbable . By the heaven above us , it shall be impossible ! "
293245	293284	293241	293241	he	570	" What if this guarantee can no longer be given ; what if , in despair of return , and in resignation to his altered fortunes , your cousin has already married his daughter to some English suitor ? "
293285	293311	293241	293241	he	570	" Ah , that would indeed be , next to my own marriage with her , the most fortunate thing that could happen to myself . "
293312	293320	293241	293241	he	570	" How ? I do n't understand ! "
293321	293548	293595	293596	the count	18827	" Why , if my cousin has so abjured his birthright , and forsworn his rank ; if this heritage , which is so dangerous from its grandeur , pass , in case of his pardon , to some obscure Englishman , - a foreigner , a native of a country that has no ties with ours , a country that is the very refuge of levellers and Carbonari - mort de ma vie ! do you think that such would not annihilate all chance of my cousin 's restoration , and be an excuse even in the eyes of Italy for formally conferring the sequestrated estates on an Italian ? No ; unless , indeed , the girl were to marry an Englishman of such name and birth and connection as would in themselves be a guarantee and how in poverty is this likely ? I should go back to Vienna with a light heart , if I could say , ' My kinswoman is an Englishman 's wife ; shall her children be the heirs to a house so renowned for its lineage , and so formidable for its wealth ? ' Parbleu ! if my cousin were but an adventurer , or merely a professor , he had been pardoned long ago . The great enjoy the honour not to be pardoned easily . "
293576	293593	293634	293634	he	570	" This man knows something ; this man is deliberating ; this man can help me , "
293626	293633	293634	293634	he	570	" And since , after all , "
293637	293662	293612	293612	he	570	" you mean so well to your cousin , it occurs to me that you might discover him by a very simple English process . "
293663	293666	293634	293634	he	570	" How ? "
293667	293689	293693	293693	his	18827	" Advertise that , if he will come to some place appointed , he will hear of something to his advantage . "
293696	293706	293612	293612	he	570	" He would suspect me , and not come . "
293707	293744	293693	293693	his	18827	" But he was intimate with you . He joined an insurrection ; you were more prudent . You did not injure him , though you may have benefited yourself . Why should he shun you ? "
293745	293767	293612	293612	he	570	" The conspirators forgive none who do not conspire ; besides , to speak frankly , he thought I injured him . "
293768	293784	293693	293693	his	18827	" Could you not conciliate him through his wife - whom you resigned to him ? "
293785	293798	293612	293612	he	570	" She is dead , - died before he left the country . "
293799	293831	293859	293859	she	1130	" Oh , that is unlucky ! Still I think an advertisement might do good . Allow me to reflect on that subject . Shall we now join Madame la Marquise ? "
293866	293885	293886	293886	Beatrice	1130	" What so interests you , ma seuur ? - the last novel by Balzac , no doubt ? "
293902	293926	293974	293974	Randal	570	" Oh , no ! no picture of miserable , vicious , Parisian life . This is beautiful ; there is soul here . "
293969	293972	293974	293974	Randal	570	" Hum , "
293976	293993	293933	293934	the marchesa	7028	" the parson was right . This is power , - a sort of a power . "
293994	294013	293974	293974	Randal	570	" How I should like to know the author ! Who can he be ? Can you guess ? "
294014	294023	293933	293934	the marchesa	7028	" Not I. Some old pedant in spectacles . "
294024	294049	294059	294060	the count	18827	" I think not , I am sure not . Here beats a heart I have ever sighed to find , and never found . "
294050	294057	294059	294060	the count	18827	" Oh , la naive enfant ! "
294062	294089	293933	293934	the marchesa	7028	" comme son imagination s'egare en reves enchantes . And to think that while you talk like an Arcadian , you are dressed like a princess . "
294090	294118	294059	294060	the count	18827	" Ah , I forgot - the Austrian ambassador 's . I shall not go to - night . This book unfits me for the artificial world . "
294119	294146	294158	294158	Randal	570	" Just as you will , my sister . I shall go . I dislike the man , and he me ; but ceremonies before men ! "
294147	294156	294158	294158	Randal	570	" You are going to the Austrian Embassy ? "
294160	294173	294190	294191	the count	18827	" I , too , shall be there . We shall meet . "
294180	294188	294190	294191	the count	18827	" I like your young friend prodigiously , "
294195	294232	294300	294300	Randal	570	" I am sure that he knows of the lost birds , and will stand to them like a pointer , if I can but make it his interest to do so . We shall see . "
294317	294350	294376	294377	the prince	9342	" By the way , Prince , there is now in London a countryman of yours , with whom you are , doubtless , familiarly acquainted , - the Count di Peschiera . "
294351	294374	294300	294300	Randal	570	" He is no countryman of mine . He is an Italian . I know him but by sight and by name , "
294381	294392	294300	294300	Randal	570	" He is of very ancient birth , I believe . "
294393	294401	294300	294300	Randal	570	" Unquestionably . His ancestors were gentlemen . "
294402	294407	294300	294300	Randal	570	" And very rich . "
294408	294428	294429	294431	A young attache	9343	" Indeed ! I have understood the contrary . He enjoys , it is true , a large revenue . "
294442	294460	294498	294498	Randal	570	" Oh , Peschiera ! poor fellow , he is too fond of play to be rich . "
294461	294496	294514	294515	the prince	9342	" And there is some chance that the kinsman whose revenue he holds may obtain his pardon , and re - enter into possession of his fortunes - so I hear , at least , "
294502	294512	294514	294515	the prince	9342	" I shall be glad if it be true , "
294520	294577	294429	294431	A young attache	9343	" and I speak the common sentiment at Vienna . That kinsman had a noble spirit , and was , I believe , equally duped and betrayed . Pardon me , sir ; but we Austrians are not so bad as we are painted . Have you ever met in England the kinsman you speak of ? "
294578	294600	294514	294515	the prince	9342	" Never , though he is supposed to reside here ; and the count tells me that he has a daughter . "
294601	294647	294429	294431	A young attache	9343	" The count - ha ! I heard something of a scheme , - a wager of that - that count 's . A daughter ! Poor girl ! I hope she will escape his pursuit ; for , no doubt , he pursues her . "
294648	294658	294666	294667	the prince	9342	" Possibly she may already have married an Englishman . "
294659	294664	294666	294667	the prince	9342	" I trust not , "
294671	294686	294429	294431	A young attache	9343	" that might at present be a serious obstacle to her father 's return . "
294687	294692	294704	294705	the attache	9347	" You think so ? "
294693	294702	294704	294705	the attache	9347	" There can be no doubt of it , "
294714	294730	294807	294808	The prince	9342	" unless , indeed , the Englishman were of a rank equal to her own . "
294833	294851	294815	294815	his	9342	" Can you tell me if a distinguished countryman of yours is in England , Lord L'Estrange ? "
294852	294865	294807	294808	The prince	9342	" No , Prince , he is not . You know him ? "
294866	294869	294815	294815	his	9342	" Well . "
294870	294895	294896	294897	The prince	9342	" He is acquainted with the count 's kinsman ; and perhaps from him you have learned to think so highly of that kinsman ? "
294907	294925	294931	294931	Randal	570	" When one man of high honour vouches for another , he commands the belief of all . "
294926	294929	294931	294931	Randal	570	" Certainly , "
294933	294985	294990	294993	a member of parliament	9351	" I must not be precipitate . I was very near falling into a terrible trap . If I were to marry the girl , and only , by so doing , settle away her inheritance on Peschiera ! - how hard it is to be sufficiently cautious in this world ! "
295000	295014	295020	295020	Randal	570	" Melancholy , Leslie ! I lay a wager I guess your thoughts . "
295015	295018	294990	294993	a member of parliament	9351	" Guess , "
295022	295036	294990	294993	a member of parliament	9351	" You were thinking of the place you are so soon to lose . "
295037	295042	294990	294993	a member of parliament	9351	" Soon to lose ! "
295043	295060	295061	295067	This ominous and horrid member of parliament	9352	" Why , if ministers go out , you could hardly keep it , I suppose . "
295092	295096	295141	295141	Randal	570	" large - acred "
295136	295139	295141	295141	Randal	570	" Hem ! "
295146	295161	295087	295087	officials	9355	" In the first place , Sir John , ministers are not going out . "
295162	295223	295141	295141	Randal	570	" Oh , yes , they will go . You know I vote with them generally , and would willingly keep them in ; but they are men of honour and spirit ; and if they ca n't carry their measures , they must resign ; otherwise , by Jove , I would turn round and vote them out myself ! "
295224	295281	295087	295087	officials	9355	" I have no doubt you would , Sir John ; you are quite capable of it ; that rests with you and your constituents . But even if ministers did go out , I am but a poor subaltern in a public office , - I am no minister . Why should I go out too ?
295282	295321	295141	295141	Randal	570	" Why ? Hang it , Leslie , you are laughing at me . A young fellow like you could never be mean enough to stay in , under the very men who drove out your friend Egerton ? "
295322	295341	295087	295087	officials	9355	" It is not usual for those in the public offices to retire with every change of government . "
295342	295447	295456	295456	Randal	570	" Certainly not ; but always those who are the relations of a retiring minister ; always those who have been regarded as politicians , and who mean to enter parliament , as of course you will do at the next election . But you know that as well as I do , - you who are so decided a politician , the writer of that admirable pamphlet ! I should not like to tell my friend Hazeldean , who has a sincere interest in you , that you ever doubted on a question of honour as plain as your A , B , C. "
295448	295454	295463	295463	he	570	" Indeed , Sir John , "
295474	295515	295516	295517	SIR JOHN	1112	" I am so new to these things that what you say never struck me before . No doubt you must be right ; at all events I can not have a better guide and adviser than Mr. Egerton himself . "
295520	295542	295543	295543	RANDAL	570	" No , certainly ; perfect gentleman , Egerton ! I wish we could make it up with him and Hazeldean . "
295547	295555	295556	295557	SIR JOHN	1112	" Ah , I wish we could ! "
295560	295585	295586	295586	RANDAL	570	" And some chance of it now ; for the time is coming when all true men of the old school must stick together . "
295589	295614	295695	295696	the minister	2115	" Wisely , admirably said , my dear Sir John . But , pardon me , I must pay my respects to the ambassador . "
295688	295693	295695	295696	the minister	2115	" Ah , Leslie , "
295704	295731	295763	295763	Egerton	500	" if you do n't think the night air too cold for you , let us walk home together . I have sent away the carriage . "
295771	296098	296118	296118	he	570	" My dear Mr. Leslie , it was my hope and belief that I had provided for you at least a competence ; and that I might open to you , later , a career yet more brilliant . Hush ! I do n't doubt your gratitude ; let me proceed . There is a possible chance , after certain decisions that the Government have come to , that we may be beaten in the House of Commons , and of course resign . I tell you this beforehand , for I wish you to have time to consider what , in that case , would be your best course . My power of serving you may then probably be over . It would , no doubt seeing our close connection , and my views with regard to your future being so well known , - no doubt , he expected that you should give up the place you hold , and follow my fortunes for good or ill . But as I have no personal enemies with the opposite party , and as I have sufficient position in the world to uphold and sanction your choice , whatever it may be , if you think it more prudent to retain your place , tell me so openly , and I think I can contrive that you may do it without loss of character and credit . In that case , confine your ambition merely to rising gradually in your office , without mixing in politics . If , on the other hand , you should prefer to take your chance of my return to office , and so resign your present place ; and , furthermore , should commit yourself to a policy that may then be not only in opposition but unpopular , I will do my best to introduce you into parliamentary life . I can not say that I advise the latter . "
296123	296144	296152	296153	the minister	2115	" Can you think , sir , that I should ever desert your fortunes , your party , your cause ? "
296145	296150	296152	296153	the minister	2115	" My dear Leslie , "
296155	296231	296118	296118	he	570	" you are too young to have committed yourself to any men or to any party , except , indeed , in that unlucky pamphlet . This must not be an affair of sentiment , but of sense and reflection . Let us say no more on the point now ; but by considering the pros and the cons , you can better judge what to do , should the time for option suddenly arrive . "
296232	296242	296255	296256	the minister	2115	" But I hope that time may not come . "
296243	296253	296276	296276	Pandal	1197	" I hope so too , and most sincerely , "
296264	296274	296276	296276	Pandal	1197	" What could be so bad for the country ? "
296278	296303	296118	296118	he	570	" It does not seem to me possible , in the nature of things , that you and your party should ever go out ! "
296304	296343	296811	296811	He	9390	" And when we are once out , there will be plenty of wiseacres to say it is out of the nature of things that we should ever come in again . Here we are at the door . "
296758	296776	297017	297018	the baron	17518	" Rises on the toe ; that spirit of his In aspiration lifts him from the earth . "
297024	297062	297074	297074	he	17518	" A young man in the first circles - you should book him for your fair lady 's parties . How d ' ye do , Mr. Leslie ? Let me introduce you to Mr. Richard Avenel . "
297077	297106	297118	297119	Mr. Avenel	455	" Man of first - rate talent , monstrous rich , has two or three parliamentary seats in his pocket , wife gives parties , - her foible . "
297107	297116	297118	297119	Mr. Avenel	455	" Proud to make your acquaintance , sir , "
297125	297129	297137	297137	Leslie	570	" Fine day . "
297130	297135	297180	297181	Mr. Avenel	455	" Rather cold too , "
297167	297178	297180	297181	Mr. Avenel	455	" So much the healthier , - braces the nerves , "
297183	297207	297253	297253	he	455	" but you young fellows relax the system by hot rooms and late hours . Fond of dancing , of course , sir ? "
297222	297251	297358	297359	the baron	17518	" Mrs. Avenel has a soiree dansante on Thursday , - shall be very happy to see you in Eaton Square . Stop , I have a card ; "
297345	297356	297358	297359	the baron	17518	" That young man will make a figure some day , "
297361	297388	297395	297396	Mr. Avenel	455	" I do n't know any one of his age with so few prejudices . He is a connection by marriage to Audley Egerton , who - "
297389	297393	297395	297396	Mr. Avenel	455	" Audley Egerton ! "
297398	297412	297358	297359	the baron	17518	" a d - -d haughty , aristocratic , disagreeable , ungrateful fellow ! "
297413	297423	297395	297396	Mr. Avenel	455	" Why , what do you know of him ? "
297424	297488	297358	297359	the baron	17518	" He owed his first seat in parliament to the votes of two near relations of mine , and when I called upon him some time ago , in his office , he absolutely ordered me out of the room . Hang his impertinence ; if ever I can pay him off , I guess I sha'n't fail for want of good will ! "
297489	297527	297395	297396	Mr. Avenel	455	" Ordered you out of the room ? That 's not like Egerton , who is civil , if formal , - at least to most men . You must have offended him in his weak point . "
297528	297548	297571	297571	Levy	1175	" A man whom the public pays so handsomely should have no weak point . What is Egerton 's ? "
297549	297569	297571	297571	Levy	1175	" Oh , he values himself on being a thorough gentleman , - a man of the nicest honour , "
297577	297590	297597	297598	Mr. Avenel	455	" You must have ruffled his plumes there . How was it ? "
297591	297595	297395	297396	Mr. Avenel	455	" I forget , "
297630	297667	297571	297571	Levy	1175	" No use bothering our heads now about the plumes of an arrogant popinjay . To return to the subject we were discussing : you must be sure to let me have this money next week . "
297668	297673	297395	297396	Mr. Avenel	455	" Rely on it . "
297674	297694	297571	297571	Levy	1175	" And you 'll not let my bills get into the market ; keep them under lock and key . "
297695	297700	297395	297396	Mr. Avenel	455	" So we agreed . "
297701	297736	297748	297749	the baron	17518	" It is but a temporary difficulty , - royal mourning , such nonsense ; panic in trade , lest these precious ministers go out . I shall soon float over the troubled waters . "
297737	297746	297877	297877	she	8099	" By the help of a paper boat , "
297880	297919	297925	297925	Egerton	500	" It is rarely indeed that we meet , Mr. Egerton , in spite of your intimacy with Lansmere and Harley . I go so little into your world , and you will not voluntarily come to me . "
297920	297923	297877	297877	she	8099	" Madam , "
297927	297965	297979	297979	Audley	500	" I might evade your kind reproach by stating that my hours are not at my disposal ; but I answer you with plain truth , - it must be painful to both of us to meet . "
297982	298003	298012	298013	the countess	8099	" And therefore , I presume that , in sending for me , you have something of moment to communicate ? "
298004	298010	298012	298013	the countess	8099	" It relates to Harley , "
298020	298028	297966	297967	The countess	8099	" and I would take your advice . "
298029	298040	298012	298013	the countess	8099	" To Harley ! Speak on , I beseech you . "
298041	298073	298084	298084	Egerton	500	" My son has probably told you that he has educated and reared a young girl , with the intention to make her Lady L'Estrange , and hereafter Countess of Lansmere . "
298074	298082	298084	298084	Egerton	500	" Harley has no secrets from me , "
298088	298104	298012	298013	the countess	8099	" This young lady has arrived in England , is here , in this house . "
298105	298110	298084	298084	Egerton	500	" And Harley too ? "
298111	298172	298191	298191	he	500	" No , she came over with Lady N - - - and her daughters . Harley was to follow shortly , and I expect him daily . Here is his letter . Observe , he has never yet communicated his intentions to this young person , now entrusted to my care , never spoken to her as the lover . "
298186	298189	298191	298191	he	500	" True , "
298199	298232	298290	298291	The countess	8099	" and before he does so he wishes you to see Miss Digby and to judge of her yourself , - wishes to know if you will approve and sanction his choice . "
298233	298289	298298	298298	EGERTON	500	" It is on this that I would consult you : a girl without rank ; the father , it is true , a gentleman , though almost equivocally one , but the mother , I know not what . And Harley , for whom I hoped an alliance with the first houses in England ! "
298301	298355	298356	298357	LADY LANSMERE	822	" He is no more a boy . His talents have been wasted , his life a wanderer 's . He presents to you a chance of resettling his mind , of re - arousing his native powers , of a home besides your own . Lady Lansmere , you can not hesitate ! "
298360	298381	298382	298382	EGERTON	500	" I do , I do ? After all that I have hoped after all that I did to prevent - "
298387	298408	298382	298382	EGERTON	500	" You owe him now an atonement ; that is in your power , - it is not in mine . "
298425	298485	298496	298496	Egerton	500	" It shall be so . I consent , I consent . I will silence , I will crush back this proud heart . Alas ! it well - nigh broke his own ! I am glad you speak thus . I like to think he owes my consent to you . In that there is atonement for both . "
298486	298494	298496	298496	Egerton	500	" You are too generous , madam , "
298512	298555	298382	298382	EGERTON	500	" And now may I see the young lady ? This conference pains me ; you see even my strong nerves quiver ; and at this time I have much to go through , - need of all my strength and firmness . "
298556	298588	298602	298602	Egerton	500	" I hear , indeed , that the Government will probably retire . But it is with honour : it will be soon called back by the voice of the nation . "
298589	298600	298767	298767	her	894	" Let me see the future wife of Harley L'Estrange , "
298757	298763	298833	298833	he	500	" What a lovely countenance ! "
298822	298831	299221	299221	He	500	" I am your guardian 's constant friend , "
299242	299279	299355	299355	he	500	" Adieu , my dear Miss Digby ; I fear I have wearied you , especially with my politics . Adieu , Lady Lansmere ; no doubt I shall see Harley as soon as he returns . "
299334	299353	299355	299355	he	500	" She is good , amiable , docile , - will make an excellent wife , no doubt , "
299359	299432	299587	299588	Lord Lansmere	504	" But does she love Harley as he has dreamed of love ? No ! Has she the power and energy to arouse his faculties , and restore to the world the Harley of old ? No ! Meant by Heaven to be the shadow of another 's sun - not herself the sun , - this child is not the one who can atone for the Past and illume the Future . "
299592	299604	299617	299618	the Patrician	9444	" Why , Harley , you love your country after all ? "
299605	299615	299708	299708	he	503	" The moment she seems in danger , yes ! "
299711	299716	299725	299726	Lady Lansmere	822	" And town gossip ? "
299717	299723	299743	299744	Lord Lansmere	504	" We never hear it , "
299728	299741	299708	299708	he	503	" There is a new plough much talked of at Boodle 's , "
299746	299765	299708	299708	he	503	" God speed it . But is not there a new man much talked of at White 's ? "
299766	299775	299708	299708	he	503	" I do n't belong to White 's . "
299776	299795	299801	299802	Lord Lansmere	504	" Nevertheless , you may have heard of him , - a foreigner , a Count di Peschiera . "
299796	299799	299801	299802	Lord Lansmere	504	" Yes , "
299804	299834	299847	299847	Harley	503	" he was pointed out to me in the Park , - a handsome man for a foreigner ; wears his hair properly cut ; looks gentlemanlike and English . "
299835	299845	299801	299802	Lord Lansmere	504	" Ah , ah ! He is here then ! "
299852	299865	299801	299802	Lord Lansmere	504	" Which road did you take ? Did you pass the Simplon ? "
299866	299875	299925	299925	he	503	" No ; I came straight from Vienna . "
299920	299923	299925	299925	he	503	" Well , "
299927	299942	299952	299953	the mother	1996	" I need not ask if you like Miss Digby ? Who would not ? "
299943	299950	299952	299953	the mother	1996	" Harley , my own son , "
299959	299976	300001	300001	Helen	894	" be happy your own way ; only be happy , that is all I ask . "
300006	300032	300045	300046	the mother	1996	" And of the chance of our happiness , - her happiness as well as mine , - what is your opinion ? Speak frankly . "
300033	300043	300045	300046	the mother	1996	" Of her happiness there can be no doubt , "
300050	300068	300001	300001	Helen	894	" Of yours , how can you ask me ? Have you not decided on that yourself ? "
300069	300100	300045	300046	the mother	1996	" But still it cheers and encourages one in any experiment , however well considered , to hear the approval of another . Helen has certainly a most gentle temper . "
300101	300111	300001	300001	Helen	894	" I should conjecture so . But her mind - "
300112	300118	300045	300046	the mother	1996	" Is very well stored . "
300119	300125	300001	300001	Helen	894	" She speaks so little - "
300126	300139	300145	300146	the countess	8099	" Yes . I wonder why ? She 's surely a woman ! "
300140	300143	300001	300001	Helen	894	" Pshaw , "
300154	300188	300001	300001	Helen	894	" But tell me more of the process of your experiment . You took her as a child , and resolved to train her according to your own ideal . Was that easy ? "
300189	300255	300001	300001	Helen	894	" It seemed so . I desired to instil habits of truth : she was already by nature truthful as the day ; a taste for Nature and all things natural : that seemed inborn ; perceptions of Art as the interpreter of Nature : those were more difficult to teach . I think they may come . You have heard her play and sing ? "
300256	300259	300306	300306	Harley	503	" NO . "
300260	300305	300325	300325	he	503	" She will surprise you . She has less talent for drawing ; still , all that teaching could do has been done , - in a word , she is accomplished . Temper , heart , mind , - these all are excellent . "
300314	300323	300346	300347	the countess	8099	" Certainly I ought to be very happy , "
300336	300344	300346	300347	the countess	8099	" Of course she must love you , "
300353	300359	300306	300306	Harley	503	" How could she fail ? "
300360	300379	300346	300347	the countess	8099	" Love me ! My dear mother , that is the very question I shall have to ask . "
300380	300397	300306	300306	Harley	503	" Ask ! Love is discovered by a glance ; it has no need of asking . "
300398	300459	300346	300347	the countess	8099	" I have never discovered it , then , I assure you . The fact is , that before her childhood was passed , I removed her , as you may suppose , from my roof . She resided with an Italian family near my usual abode . I visited her often , directed her studies , watched her improvement - "
300460	300468	300306	300306	Harley	503	" And fell in love with her ? "
300469	300634	300346	300347	the countess	8099	" Fall is such a very violent word . No ; I do n't remember to have had a fall . It was all a smooth inclined plane from the first step , until at last I said to myself , ' Harley L'Estrange , thy time has come . The bud has blossomed into flower . Take it to thy breast . ' And myself replied to myself , meekly , ' So be it . ' Then I found that Lady N - - - , with her daughters , was coming to England . I asked her Ladyship to take my ward to your house . I wrote to you , and prayed your assent ; and , that granted , I knew you would obtain my father 's . Iam here , - you give me the approval I sought for . I will speak to Helen to - morrow . Perhaps , after all , she may reject me . "
300635	300656	300662	300662	Harley	503	" Strange , strange ! you speak thus coldly , thus lightly , you , so capable of ardent love ! "
300657	300660	300662	300662	Harley	503	" Mother , "
300666	300754	300900	300901	soft Helen	894	" be satisfied ! I am ! Love as of old , I feel , alas ! too well , can visit me never more . But gentle companionship , tender friendship , the relief and the sunlight of woman 's smile , hereafter the voices of children , - music that , striking on the hearts of both parents , wakens the most lasting and the purest of all sympathies , - these are my hope . Is the hope so mean , my fond mother ? "
300913	300919	301874	301874	his	9506	" lord of wantonness and ease "
301877	301918	301919	301919	Helen	894	" I had so little of your conversation last evening , my dear ward , that I may well monopolize you now , even to the privation of Nero . And so you are once more in your native land ? "
301923	301941	301967	301967	Harley	503	" May I not hope that you return under fairer auspices than those which your childhood knew ? "
301978	302014	302088	302088	He	503	" Helen , your eyes thank me ; but hear me before your words do . I deserve no thanks . I am about to make to you a strange confession of egotism and selfishness . "
302015	302023	301967	301967	Harley	503	" You ! - oh , impossible ! "
302024	302087	302120	302120	her	894	" Judge yourself , and then decide which of us shall have cause to be grateful . Helen , when I was scarcely your age - a boy in years , but more , methinks , a man at heart , with man 's strong energies and sublime aspirings , than I have ever since been - I loved , and deeply - "
302128	302687	302821	302821	he	503	" Deeply , and for sorrow . It is a long tale , that may be told hereafter . The worldly would call my love a madness . I did not reason on it then , I can not reason on it now . Enough : death smote suddenly , terribly , and to me , mysteriously , her whom I loved . The love lived on . Fortunately , perhaps , for me , I had quick distraction , not to grief , but to its inert indulgence . I was a soldier ; I joined our armies . Men called me brave . Flattery ! I was a coward before the thought of life . I sought death : like sleep , it does not come at our call . Peace ensued . As when the winds fall the sails droop , so when excitement ceased , all seemed to me flat and objectless . Heavy , heavy was my heart . Perhaps grief had been less obstinate , but that I feared I had causes for self - reproach . Since then I have been a wanderer , a self - made exile . My boyhood had been ambitious , - all ambition ceased . Flames , when they reach the core of the heart , spread , and leave all in ashes . Let me be brief : I did not mean thus weakly to complain , - I to whom Heaven has given so many blessings ! I felt , as it were , separated from the common objects and joys of men . I grew startled to see how , year by year , wayward humours possessed me . I resolved again to attach myself to some living heart - it was my sole chance to rekindle my own . But the one I had loved remained as my type of woman , and she was different from all I saw . Therefore I said to myself , ' I will rear from childhood some young fresh life , to grow up into my ideal . ' As this thought began to haunt me , I chanced to discover you . Struck with the romance of your early life , touched by your courage , charmed by your affectionate nature , I said to myself , ' Here is what I seek . ' Helen , in assuming the guardianship of your ' Life , in all the culture which I have sought to bestow on your docile childhood , I repeat , that I have been but the egotist . And now , when you have reached that age when it becomes me to speak , and you to listen ; now , when you are under the sacred roof of my own mother ; now I ask you , can you accept this heart , such as wasted years , and griefs too fondly nursed , have left it ? Can you be , at least , my comforter ? Can you aid me to regard life as a duty , and recover those aspirations which once soared from the paltry and miserable confines of our frivolous daily being ? Helen , here I ask you , can you be all this , and under the name of - Wife ? "
302816	302820	302821	302821	he	503	" My Helen , "
302831	302896	302906	302906	Helen	894	" there is some disparity of years between us , and perhaps I may not hope henceforth for that love which youth gives to the young . Permit me simply to ask , what you will frankly answer , Can you have seen in our quiet life abroad , or under the roof of your Italian friends , any one you prefer to me ? "
302897	302904	302821	302821	he	503	" No , indeed , no ! "
302908	302918	302953	302953	she	894	" How could I ; who is like you ? "
302963	303022	302953	302953	she	894	" Oh , my dear guardian , noblest of all human beings , at least in my eyes , forgive , forgive me , if I seem ungrateful , hesitating ; but I can not , can not think of myself as worthy of you . I never so lifted my eyes . Your rank , your position - "
303023	303039	303049	303049	Helen	894	" Why should they be eternally my curse ? Forget them , and go on . "
303040	303047	303049	303049	Helen	894	" It is not only they , "
303054	303096	303108	303108	Harley	503	" though they are much ; but I your type , your ideal ! - I ? - impossible ! Oh , how can I ever be anything even of use , of aid , of comfort to one like you ! "
303097	303106	303108	303108	Harley	503	" You can , Helen - you can , "
303116	303124	303158	303159	Harley L'Estrange	503	" May I not keep this hand ? "
303152	303156	303158	303159	Harley L'Estrange	503	" My mother , "
303164	303173	303217	303226	a young man , walking quickly from the opposite direction	9514	" I present to you my future wife . "
303247	303272	303217	303226	a young man , walking quickly from the opposite direction	9514	" What ! you in England , Lord L'Estrange ! Accept my congratulations on your return . But you seem scarcely to remember me . "
303273	303315	303217	303226	a young man , walking quickly from the opposite direction	9514	" I beg your pardon , Mr. Leslie . I remember you now by your smile ; but you are of an age in which it is permitted me to say that you look older than when I saw you last . "
303316	303332	303431	303431	Leslie	570	" And yet , Lord L'Estrange , it seems to me that you look younger . "
303434	303463	303495	303495	L'Estrange	502	" Perhaps you are on your way to Mr. Egerton 's . If so , you will not find him at home ; he is at his office . "
303464	303480	303491	303491	Randal	570	" Thank you . Then to his office I must re - direct my steps . "
303481	303489	303527	303527	he	570	" I am going to him myself , "
303536	303544	303692	303692	L'Estrange	502	" Let us be companions so far . "
303580	303603	303692	303692	L'Estrange	502	" Egerton is always the same man , I suppose , - too busy for illness , and too firm for sorrow ? "
303604	303639	303692	303692	L'Estrange	502	" If he ever feel either , he will never stoop to complain . But , indeed , my dear lord , I should like much to know what you think of his health . "
303640	303647	303692	303692	L'Estrange	502	" How ! You alarm me ! "
303648	303685	303692	303692	L'Estrange	502	" Nay , I did not mean to do that ; and pray do not let him know that I went so far . But I have fancied that he looks a little worn and suffering . "
303686	303690	303692	303692	L'Estrange	502	" Poor Audley ! "
303701	303754	303841	303842	Lord L'Estrange	502	" I will sound him , and , be assured , without naming you ; for I know well how little he likes to be supposed capable of human infirmity . I am obliged to you for your hint , obliged to you for your interest in one so dear to me . "
303823	303839	303841	303842	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Loss of office could not , I think , affect a man like Audley , "
303844	303861	303870	303870	Randal	570	" He would be as great in opposition - perhaps greater ; and as to emoluments - "
303862	303868	303841	303842	Lord L'Estrange	502	" The emoluments are good , "
303878	303924	303943	303943	Randal	570	" Good enough , I suppose , to pay him back about a tenth of what his place costs our magnificent friend . No , I will say one thing for English statesmen , no man amongst them ever yet was the richer for place . "
303925	303941	303841	303842	Lord L'Estrange	502	" And Mr. Egerton 's private fortune must be large , I take for granted , "
303947	303962	303977	303977	Randal	570	" It ought to be , if he has time to look to it . "
303980	304004	304028	304028	he	570	" Will you excuse me for an instant ? As we are passing this hotel , I will just leave my card here . "
304019	304026	304037	304037	Randal	570	" For the Count di Peschiera , "
304045	304057	304037	304037	Randal	570	" So that Italian lodges here ; and you know him ? "
304058	304075	304037	304037	Randal	570	" I know him but slightly , as one knows any foreigner who makes a sensation . "
304076	304082	304037	304037	Randal	570	" He makes a sensation ? "
304083	304116	304037	304037	Randal	570	" Naturally ; for he is handsome , witty , and said to be very rich , - that is , as long as he receives the revenues of his exiled kinsman . "
304117	304140	304037	304037	Randal	570	" I see you are well informed , Mr. Leslie . And what is supposed to bring hither the Count di Peschiera ? "
304141	304218	304253	304253	L'Estrange	502	" I did hear something , which I did not quite understand , about a bet of his that he would marry his kinsman 's daughter , and so , I conclude , secure to himself all the inheritance ; and that he is therefore here to discover the kinsman and win the heiress . But probably you know the rights of the story , and can tell me what credit to give to such gossip . "
304219	304251	304037	304037	Randal	570	" I know this at least , that if he did lay such a wager , I would advise you to take any odds against him that his backers may give , "
304273	304296	304037	304037	Randal	570	" You think , then , that this poor kinsman will not need such an alliance in order to regain his estates ? "
304297	304328	304037	304037	Randal	570	" Yes ; for I never yet knew a rogue whom I would not bet against , when he backed his own luck as a rogue against Justice and Providence . "
304348	304370	304375	304375	Harley	503	" And indeed there is another vague rumour that the young lady in question is married already - to some Englishman . "
304379	304428	304037	304037	Randal	570	" Good heavens ! that can not be true , - that would undo all ! An Englishman just at this moment ! But some Englishman of correspondent rank I trust , or at least one known for opinions opposed to what an Austrian would call Revolutionary doctrines ? "
304429	304470	304480	304480	Harley	503	" I know nothing . But it was supposed merely a private gentleman of good family . Would not that suffice ? Can the Austrian Court dictate a marriage to the daughter as a condition for grace to the father ? "
304471	304478	304480	304480	Harley	503	" No , - not that ! "
304485	304692	305066	305067	the schemer	9515	" But put yourself in the position of any minister to one of the great European monarchies . Suppose a political insurgent , formidable for station and wealth , had been proscribed , much interest made on his behalf , a powerful party striving against it ; and just when the minister is disposed to relent , he hears that the heiress to this wealth and this station is married to the native of a country in which sentiments friendly to the very opinions for which the insurgent was proscribed are popularly entertained , and thus that the fortune to be restored may be so employed as to disturb the national security , the existing order of things , - this , too , at the very time when a popular revolution has just occurred in France , and its effects are felt most in the very land of the exile ; - suppose all this , and then say if anything could be more untoward for the hopes of the banished man , or furnish his adversaries with stronger arguments against the restoration of his fortune ? But pshaw ! this must be a chimera ! If true , I should have known of it . "
304738	304812	305066	305067	the schemer	9515	" I quite agree with your lordship , - there can be no truth in such a rumour . Some Englishman , hearing , perhaps , of the probable pardon of the exile , may have counted on an heiress , and spread the report in order to keep off other candidates . By your account , if successful in his suit , he might fail to find an heiress in the bride . "
304813	304894	304900	304900	Randal	570	" No doubt of that . Whatever might be arranged , I ca n't conceive that he would be allowed to get at the fortune , though it might be held in suspense for his children . But indeed it so rarely happens that an Italian girl of high name marries a foreigner that we must dismiss this notion with a smile at the long face of the hypothetical fortune - hunter . Heaven help him , if he exist ! "
304895	304898	305066	305067	the schemer	9515	" Amen ! "
304904	304923	305066	305067	the schemer	9515	" I hear that Peschiera , 's sister is returned to England . Do you know her too ? "
304924	304928	305039	305039	Harley	503	" A little . "
304929	305037	305066	305067	the schemer	9515	" My dear Mr. Leslie , pardon me if I take a liberty not warranted by our acquaintance . Against the lady I say nothing . Indeed , I have heard some things which appear to entitle her to compassion and respect . But as to Peschiera all who prize honour suspect him to be a knave , - I know him to be one . Now , I think that the longer we preserve that abhorrence for knavery which is the generous instinct of youth , why , the fairer will be our manhood , and the more reverend our age . You agree with me ? "
305059	305064	305169	305170	the speaker	5845	" To be sure , "
305123	305155	305177	305177	Harley	503	" My dear fellow , how are you ? I see you are engaged now ; but look into my rooms when you can , in the course of the day . "
305180	305222	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" No , do n't let me take you from your friend , Mr. Leslie . And you need not be in a hurry to see Egerton ; for I shall claim the privilege of older friendship for the first interview . "
305223	305233	305177	305177	Harley	503	" It is Mr. Egerton 's nephew Frank Hazeldan . "
305234	305262	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" Pray , call him back , and present me to him . He has a face that would have gone far to reconcile Timon to Athens . "
305298	305308	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" That Lord L'Estrange seems a very good fellow . "
305309	305343	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" So - so ; an effeminate humourist , - says the most absurd things , and fancies them wise . Never mind him . You wanted to speak to me , Frank ? "
305344	305369	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" Yes ; I am so obliged to you for introducing me to Levy . I must tell you how handsomely he has behaved . "
305370	305472	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" Stop ; allow me to remind you that I did not introduce you to Levy ; you had met him before at Borrowell 's , if I recollect right , and he dined with us at the Clarendon , - that is all I had to do with bringing you together . Indeed I rather cautioned you against him than not . Pray do n't think I introduced you to a man who , however pleasant and perhaps honest , is still a money - lender . Your father would be justly angry with me if I had done so . "
305473	305575	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" Oh , pooh ! you are prejudiced against poor Levy . But just hear : I was sitting very ruefully , thinking over those cursed bills , and how the deuce I should renew them , when Levy walked into my rooms ; and after telling me of his long friendship for my uncle Egerton and his admiration for yourself , and give me your hand , Randal saying how touched he felt by your kind sympathy in my troubles , he opened his pocket - book , and showed me the bills safe and sound in his own possession . "
305576	305579	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" How ? "
305580	305719	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" He had bought them up . ' It must be so disagreeable to me , ' he said , ' to have them flying about the London moneymarket , and those Jews would be sure sooner or later to apply to my father . And now , ' added Levy , ' I am in no immediate hurry for the money , and we must put the interest upon fairer terms . ' In short , nothing could be more liberal than his tone . And he says , he is thinking of a way to relieve me altogether , and will call about it in a few days , when his plan is matured . After all , I must owe this to you , Randal . I dare swear you put it into his head . "
305720	305768	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" Oh , no , indeed ! On the contrary , I still say , Be cautious in all your dealings with Levy . I do n't know , I ' m sure , what he means to propose . Have you heard from the Hall lately ? "
305769	305890	305896	305896	Randal	570	" Yes , to - day . Only think - the Riccaboccas have disappeared . My mother writes me word of it , - a very odd letter . She seems to suspect that I know where they are , and reproaches me for ' mystery ' - quite enigmatical . But there is one sentence in her letter - see , here it is in the postscript - which seems to refer to Beatrice : ' I do n't ask you to tell me your secrets , Frank , but Randal will no doubt have assured you that my first consideration will be for your own happiness , in any matter in which your heart is really engaged . ' "
305891	305894	305896	305896	Randal	570	" Yes , "
305900	305978	305296	305297	CHAPTER X.	655	" no doubt this refers to Beatrice ; but , as I told you , your mother will not interfere one way or the other , - such interference would weaken her influence with the squire . Besides , as she said , she ca n't wish , you to marry a foreigner ; though once married , she would - But how do you stand now with the marchesa ? Has she consented to accept you ? "
305979	306029	305896	305896	Randal	570	" Not quite ; indeed I have not actually proposed . Her manner , though much softened , has not so far emboldened me ; and , besides , before a positive declaration , I certainly must go down to the Hall and speak at least to my mother . "
306030	306081	306279	306283	some candid and youthful conjecturer	9536	" You must judge for yourself , but do n't do anything rash : talk first to me . Here we are at my office . Good - by ; and - and pray believe that , in whatever you do with Levy , I have no hand in it . "
306273	306277	306279	306283	some candid and youthful conjecturer	9536	" But perhaps , "
306286	306298	306797	306797	Giacomo	487	" perhaps Randal Leslie is in love with this fair creature ? "
306792	306795	306797	306797	Giacomo	487	" Padrone , "
306821	306856	306864	306864	Riccabocca	742	" Padrone , I see the young Englishman riding towards the house , and I hope , when he arrives , you will not forget the alarming information I gave to you this morning . "
306857	306862	306866	306866	his	5338	" Ah , ah ! "
306870	306878	306891	306891	Riccabocca	742	" If the signorina were but married ! "
306879	306889	306891	306891	Riccabocca	742	" My very thought , - my constant thought ! "
306893	306904	306916	306916	Giacomo	487	" And you really believe the young Englishman loves her ? "
306905	306914	306932	306932	Riccabocca	742	" Why else should he come , Excellency ? "
306922	306930	306932	306932	Riccabocca	742	" Very true ; why , indeed ? "
306934	306992	307005	307005	he	9551	" Jemima , I can not endure the terrors I suffer on that poor child 's account . I will open myself frankly to Randal Leslie . And now , too , that which might have been a serious consideration , in case I return to Italy , will no longer stand in our way , Jemima . "
307008	307063	307069	307069	Giacomo	487	" Nonsense , anima mia . I know it will be , - have not a doubt of it . I tell you it is as nine to four , according to the nicest calculations . I will speak at once to Randal . He is too young , too timid to speak himself . "
307064	307067	307069	307069	Giacomo	487	" Certainly , "
307071	307086	307100	307100	Riccabocca	742	" how could he dare to speak , let him love ever so well ? "
307092	307098	307100	307100	Riccabocca	742	" Oh , never fear , "
307106	307169	307317	307317	Riccabocca	742	" I will give him the trial . If he entertain but mercenary views , I shall soon detect them . I know human nature pretty well , I think , my love ; and , Giacomo , just get me my Machiavelli ; - that 's right . Now leave me , my dear ; I must reflect and prepare myself . "
307312	307315	307317	307317	Riccabocca	742	" Letters ! "
307321	307368	307406	307406	Riecabocca	481	" I never receive any ; or , at least , so rarely , that it was not worth while to take an event so little to be expected into consideration . No ; if any letters do reach the Casino , there they will wait . "
307369	307388	307317	307317	Riccabocca	742	" Then I can see no possibility of indiscretion ; no chance of a clew to your address . "
307389	307394	307491	307491	he	570	" Nor I either . "
307484	307489	307491	307491	he	570	" My young friend , "
307493	307508	307545	307545	he	570	" hear me attentively , and answer me frankly . I know human nature - "
307530	307544	307589	307591	the wise man	3241	" I know human nature , - at least I have studied it , "
307558	307587	307589	307591	the wise man	3241	" and I believe that when a perfect stranger to me exhibits an interest in my affairs , which occasions him no small trouble , - an interest , "
307601	307621	307629	307629	Randal	570	" which scarcely a son could exceed , he must be under the influence of some strong personal motive . "
307622	307627	307643	307643	Riccabocca	742	" Oh , sir ! "
307661	307779	307825	307830	the penetrating judge of human nature	9562	" In your case , what is that motive ? Not political ; for I conclude you share the opinions of your government , and those opinions have not favoured mine . Not that of pecuniary or ambitious calculations ; for how can such calculations enlist you on behalf of a ruined exile ? What remains ? Why , the motive which at your age is ever the most natural and the strongest . I do n't blame you . Machiavelli himself allows that such a motive has swayed the wisest minds , and overturned the most solid States . In a word , young man , you are in love , and with my daughter Violante . "
307817	307823	307825	307830	the penetrating judge of human nature	9562	" I do not doubt , "
307832	308014	308202	308202	Riccabocca	463	" that you would have been withheld by the laudable and generous scruples which characterize your happy age , from voluntarily disclosing to me the state of your heart . You might suppose that , proud of the position I once held , or sanguine in the hope of regaining my inheritance , I might be over - ambitious in my matrimonial views for Violante ; or that you , anticipating my restoration to honours and fortune , might seem actuated by the last motives which influence love and youth ; and , therefore , my dear young friend , I have departed from the ordinary custom in England , and adopted a very common one in my own country . With us , a suitor seldom presents himself till he is assured of the consent of a father . I have only to say this , - if I am right , and you love my daughter , my first object in life is to see her safe and secure ; and , in a word - you understand me . "
308195	308200	308202	308202	Riccabocca	463	" The poor youth ! "
308204	308216	308225	308225	Randal	570	" how unprepared he is for the happiness I give him ! "
308217	308223	308225	308225	Randal	570	" The cunning old Jesuit ! "
308227	308308	308395	308395	he	570	" he has certainly learned , since we met last , that he has no chance of regaining his patrimony , and so he wants to impose on me the hand of a girl without a shilling . What other motive can he possibly have ? Had his daughter the remotest probability of becoming the greatest heiress in Italy , would he dream of bestowing her on me in this off - hand way ? The thing stands to reason . "
308398	308522	308536	308536	Riccabocca	463	" Oh , too generous man ! pardon me if I have so long been unable to express my amaze , my gratitude ; but I can not - no , I can not , while your prospects remain thus uncertain , avail myself of your - of your inconsiderate magnanimity . Your rare conduct can only redouble my own scruples , if you , as I firmly hope and believe , are restored to your great possessions - you would naturally look so much higher than me . Should these hopes fail , then , indeed , it may be different ; yet even then , what position , what fortune , have I to offer to your daughter worthy of her ? "
308523	308534	308630	308630	Riccabocca	463	" You are well born ! all gentlemen are equals , "
308545	308628	308630	308630	Riccabocca	463	" You have youth , information , talent , - sources of certain wealth in this happy country , - powerful connections ; and , in fine , if you are satisfied with marrying for love , I shall be contented ; if not , speak openly . As to the restoration to my possessions , I can scarcely think that probable while my enemy lives . And even in that case , since I saw you last , something has occurred , "
308646	308711	308630	308630	Riccabocca	463	" that may remove all difficulties . Meanwhile , do not think me so extravagantly magnanimous ; do not underrate the satisfaction I must feel at knowing Violante safe from the designs of Peschiera , - safe , and forever , under a husband 's roof . I will tell you an Italian proverb , - it contains a truth full of wisdom and terror ,
308712	308731	308630	308630	Riccabocca	463	" ' Hai cinquanta Amici ? - non basta . Hai un Nemico ? - e troppo . ' "
308732	308755	308763	308763	Randal	570	" Have you fifty friends ? - it is not enough . Have you one enemy ? - it is too much . "
308756	308761	308808	308808	Riccabocca	463	" Something has occurred ! "
308791	308807	308808	308808	Riccabocca	463	" Something has occurred ! My dear friend , be plainer . What has occurred ? "
308812	308824	308844	308844	Randal	570	" Something that induces you to bestow your daughter on me ? "
308834	308842	308844	308844	Randal	570	" The very laugh of a fiend , "
308846	308864	308871	308872	the Italian	1688	" Something that makes her not worth bestowing . He betrays himself . Cunning people always do . "
308865	308869	308871	308872	the Italian	1688	" Pardon me , "
308877	308917	308940	308940	he	463	" if I do n't answer your question ; you will know later ; but at present this is a family secret . And now I must turn to another and more alarming cause for my frankness to you . "
308934	308939	308940	308940	he	463	" You must know , "
308947	308988	308944	308944	his	463	" that Giacomo has seen a strange person loitering about the house , and looking up at the windows ; and he has no doubt - nor have I - that this is some spy or emissary of Peschiera 's . "
308989	308998	308940	308940	he	463	" Impossible ; how could he discover you ? "
308999	309030	308944	308944	his	463	" I know not ; but no one else has any interest in doing so . The man kept at a distance , and Giacomo could not see his face . "
309031	309044	308940	308940	he	463	" It may be but a mere idler . Is this all ? "
309045	309070	308944	308944	his	463	" No ; the old woman who serves us said that she was asked at a shop ' if we were not Italians ' ? "
309071	309076	308940	308940	he	463	" And she answered ? "
309077	309095	308944	308944	his	463	" ' No ; ' but owned that ' we had a foreign servant , Giacomo . ' "
309096	309131	308940	308940	he	463	" I will see to this . Rely on it that if Peschiera has discovered you , I will learn it . Nay , I will hasten from you in order to commence inquiry . "
309132	309151	308944	308944	his	463	" I can not detain you . May I think that we have now an interest in common ? "
309152	309187	308940	308940	he	463	" Oh , indeed yes ; but - but - your daughter ! How can I dream that one so beautiful , so peerless , will confirm the hope you have extended to me ? "
309188	309212	308944	308944	his	463	" The daughter of an Italian is brought up to consider that it is a father 's right to dispose of her hand . "
309213	309218	309224	309225	the Italian	1688	" But the heart ? "
309219	309222	309224	309225	the Italian	1688	" Cospetto ! "
309237	309260	309299	309300	the sage	3893	" the heart of a girl is like a convent , - the holier the cloister , the more charitable the door . "
309288	309297	309299	309300	the sage	3893	" I like the young man very well , "
309303	309363	309271	309272	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" very well indeed . I find him just what I expected , from my general knowledge of human nature ; for as love ordinarily goes with youth , so modesty usually accompanies talent . He is young , ergo , he is in love ; he has talent , ergo , he is modest , modest and ingenuous . "
309364	309379	309444	309446	the poor exile	5037	" And you think not in any way swayed by interest in his affections ? "
309380	309442	309271	309272	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" Quite the contrary ; and to prove him the more , I have not said a word as to the worldly advantages which , in any case , would accrue to him from an alliance with my daughter . In any case : for if I regain my country , her fortune is assured ; and if not , I trust "
309456	309488	309271	309272	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" that I am too well aware of my child 's dignity , as well as my own , to ask any one to marry her to his own worldly injury . "
309489	309517	309525	309525	Riccabocca	463	" Eh ! I do n't quite understand you , Alphonso . To be sure , your dear life is insured for her marriage portion ; but - "
309518	309523	309525	309525	Riccabocca	463	" Pazzie - stuff ! "
309529	309722	309738	309738	Jemima	528	" her marriage portion would be as nothing to a young man of Randal 's birth and prospects . I think not of that . But listen : I have never consented to profit by Harley L'Estrange 's friendship for me ; my scruples would not extend to my son - in - law . This noble friend has not only high rank , but considerable influence , - influence with the government , influence with Randal 's patron , who , between ourselves , does not seem to push the young man as he might do ; I judge by what Randal says . I should write , therefore , before anything was settled , to L'Estrange , and I should say to him simply , ' I never asked you to save me from penury , but I do ask you to save a daughter of my House from humiliation . I can give to her no dowry ; can her husband owe to my friend that advance in an honourable career , that opening to energy and talent , which is more than a dowry to generous ambition ? ' "
309723	309736	309738	309738	Jemima	528	" Oh , it is in vain you would disguise your rank , "
309743	309757	309773	309773	he	1688	" it speaks in all you utter , when your passions are moved . "
309768	309771	309773	309773	he	1688	" Pish , "
309775	309783	310172	310172	you	9590	" there you are ! rank again ! "
310177	310182	310191	310196	the dandies who dined with him	9602	" What perfect taste ! "
310202	310214	310566	310570	A middle - aged man	20731	" He pretend to imitate D - - ! vulgar dog ! "
310582	310585	310780	310781	the man	14948	" about town "
310633	310653	310662	310664	The Company Present	9634	" a man whose wife gave horrid third - rate parties , that took up half a column in the "
310656	310661	310662	310664	The Company Present	9634	" with a list of "
310666	310764	310662	310664	The Company Present	9634	" in which a sprinkling of dowagers fading out of fashion , and a foreign title or two , made the darkness of the obscurer names doubly dark . Why this man should be asked to meet them , by Baron Levy , too - a decided tuft - hunter and would - be exclusive - called all their faculties into exercise . The wit , who , being the son of a small tradesman , but in the very best society , gave himself far greater airs than the young lords , impertinently solved the mystery . "
310769	310776	310818	310818	Levy	1175	" whispered he to Spendquick , - "
310824	310824	310833	310833	Spendquick	1174	"
310825	310831	310833	310833	Spendquick	1174	" ' Pon my soul , "
310838	310854	310862	310863	the wit	9639	" if that 's the case , one may as well be civil to him . "
310855	310860	310862	310863	the wit	9639	" You , certainly , "
310865	310900	311226	311226	he	643	" But I never have found an X. Y. who would advance me the L. s. ; and therefore I shall not be more respectful to X. Y. than to any other unknown quantity . "
311213	311224	311240	311240	Avenel	643	" Spare my friend and Mr. Leslie 's near connection , "
311235	311238	311240	311240	Avenel	643	" Oh , "
311242	311262	311272	311272	Spendquick	1174	" public men , whom we pay , are public property , - are n't they , my Lord ? "
311267	311270	311313	311313	he	1174	" Certainly , "
311279	311312	311313	311313	he	1174	" public property , or why should we pay them ? There must be a very strong motive to induce us to do that ! I hate paying people . In fact , "
311319	311324	311330	311331	Mr. Avenel	455	" I never do . "
311325	311328	311330	311331	Mr. Avenel	455	" However , "
311335	311375	311381	311382	the baron	17518	" I do n't want to hurt your feelings , Mr. Leslie . As to the feelings of our host , the baron , I calculate that they have got tolerably tough by the exercise they have gone through . "
311376	311379	311381	311382	the baron	17518	" Nevertheless , "
311402	311422	311623	311626	one , sotto voce	9669	" nevertheless , ' love me , love my dog , ' - love me , love my Egerton . "

311628	311640	311655	311656	a third	9671	" X. Y. does not seem such a very bad fellow , "
311644	311653	311623	311626	one , sotto voce	9669	" He looks rich , and talks rich , "
311658	311675	311682	311682	Spendquick	1174	" A decided , independent way of expressing his sentiments ; those moneyed men generally have . "
311676	311680	311688	311688	his	1174	" Good heavens ! "
311696	311733	311741	311741	another	15587	" do look ; X. Y. is actually taking out his pocket - book ; he is coming this way . Depend on it he has got our bills - mine is due to - morrow ! "
311734	311739	311741	311741	another	15587	" And mine too , "
311746	311757	311832	311835	the great Roman general	9677	" Why , it is a perfect guet - apens . "
311838	311847	311909	311910	Mr. Avenel	455	" flutter the dove - cots in Corioli , "
311904	311907	311928	311928	Spendquick	1174	" Hum , "
311916	311926	311942	311942	Dick	643	" I do n't like that hum at all , "
311930	311940	311969	311969	Dick	643	" Proud to have made your acquaintance , gentlemen , "
311955	311968	312013	312013	Avenel	643	" My friend the baron thought this not exactly the time to - "
312008	312011	312053	312053	he	643	" But , "
312020	312051	312053	312053	he	643	" I have made it a rule in life never to lose securing a good opportunity ; in short , to make the most of the present moment . And , "
312068	312093	312117	312117	Dick	643	" the rule has made me a very warm man ! Therefore , gentlemen , allow me to present you each with one of these "
312122	312128	312142	312142	Spendquick	1174	" a little soiree dansante , "
312136	312140	312142	312142	Spendquick	1174	" Most happy ! "
312144	312180	312220	312220	Avenel	643	" I do n't dance in general ; but to oblige X - I mean , to have a better acquaintance , sir , with you - I would dance on the tight - rope . "
312208	312218	312224	312232	the wit , who was plump and somewhat gouty	9685	" You do n't look like a dancing man , "
312248	312258	312264	312265	the wit	9639	" but we shall have supper at one o'clock . "
312269	312285	312324	312325	the baron	17518	" that every hour of his time was engaged for the rest of the season , "
312334	312344	312370	312370	Levy	1175	" Stay , I want to talk to you . "
312361	312368	312378	312378	he	1175	" Pleasant young men , those , "
312391	312502	312352	312352	his	17518	" And not at all proud ; but , to be sure , they are - under great obligations to me . Yes ; they owe me a great deal a propos , I have had a long talk with Frank Hazeldean , - fine young man , remarkable capacities for business . I can arrange his affairs for him . I find , on reference to the Will Office , that you were quite right ; the Casino property is entailed on Frank . He will have the fee simple . He can dispose of the reversion entirely . So that there will be no difficulty in our arrangements . "
312503	312524	312378	312378	he	1175	" But I told you also that Frank had scruples about borrowing on the event of his father 's death . "
312525	312592	312352	312352	his	17518	" Ay , you did so . Filial affection ! I never take that into account in matters of business . Such little scruples , though they are highly honourable to human nature , soon vanish before the prospect of the King 's Bench . And , too , as you so judiciously remarked , our clever young friend is in love with Madame di Negra . "
312593	312600	312378	312378	he	1175	" Did he tell you that ? "
312601	312610	312352	312352	his	17518	" No ; but Madame di Negra did ! "
312611	312616	312378	312378	he	1175	" You know her ? "
312617	312672	312352	312352	his	17518	" I know most people in good society , who now and then require a friend in the management of their affairs . And having made sure of the fact you stated , as to Hazeldean 's contingent property excuse my prudence , I have accommodated Madame di Negra and bought up her debts . "
312673	312681	312378	312378	he	1175	" You have - you surprise me ! "
312682	312716	312352	312352	his	17518	" The surprise will vanish on reflection . But you are very new to the world yet , my dear Leslie . By the way , I have had an interview with Peschiera - "
312717	312724	312378	312378	he	1175	" About his sister 's debts ? "
312725	312737	312854	312855	The baron	17518	" Partly . A man of the nicest honour is Peschiera . "
312800	312853	312854	312855	The baron	17518	" I think your father has some property in - - shire , and you probably can give me a little information as to certain estates of a Mr. Thornhill , estates which , on examination of the title - deeds , I find once , indeed , belonged to your family . "
312866	312911	313022	313022	Levy	1175	" The manors of Rood and Dulmansberry , with sundry farms thereon . Mr. Thornhill wants to sell them - an old client of mine , Thornhill . He has applied to me on the matter . Do you think it an improvable property ? "
313017	313020	313022	313022	Levy	1175	" Thornhill , "
313033	313100	313109	313109	Randal	570	" Thornhill tells me that that part of his property - the old Leslie lands - produces L2 , 000 a year , and that the rental could be raised . He would take L50,000 for it , L20,000 down , and suffer the remaining L30,000 to lie on mortgage at four per cent . It seems a very good purchase . What do you say ? "
313101	313107	313109	313109	Randal	570	" Do n't ask me , "
313116	313131	313022	313022	Levy	1175	" for I had hoped I might live to repossess myself of that property . "
313132	313188	313109	313109	Randal	570	" Ah , indeed ! It would be a very great addition to your consequence in the world , - not from the mere size of the estate , but from its hereditary associations . And if you have any idea of the purchase , believe me , I 'll not stand in your way . "
313189	313199	313022	313022	Levy	1175	" How can I have any idea of it ? "
313200	313209	313109	313109	Randal	570	" But I thought you said you had . "
313210	313238	313022	313022	Levy	1175	" I understood that these lands could not be sold till Mr. Thornhill 's son came of age , and joined in getting rid of the entail . "
313239	313383	313393	313393	Levy	1175	" Yes , so Thornhill himself supposed , till , on examining the title - deeds , I found he was under a mistake . These lands are not comprised in the settlement made by old Jasper Thornhill , which ties up the rest of the property . The title will be perfect . Thornhill wants to settle the matter at once , - losses on the turf , you understand ; an immediate purchaser would get still better terms . A Sir John Spratt would give the money ; but the addition of these lands would make the Spratt property of more consequence in the county than the Thornhill . So my client would rather take a few thousands less from a man who do n't set up to be his rival . Balance of power in counties as well as nations . "
313388	313391	313393	313393	Levy	1175	" Well , "
313401	313556	313718	313718	Levy	1175	" I see I pain you ; and though I am what my very pleasant guests would call a parvenu , I comprehend your natural feelings as a gentleman of ancient birth . Parvenu ! Ah , is it not strange , Leslie , that no wealth , no fashion , no fame can wipe out that blot ? They call me a parvenu , and borrow my money . They call our friend the wit a parvenu , and submit to all his insolence - if they condescend to regard his birth at all - provided they can but get him to dinner . They call the best debater in the parliament of England a parvenu , and will entreat him , some day or other , to be prime minister , and ask him for stars and garters . A droll world , and no wonder the parvenus want to upset it . "
313713	313716	313721	313721	himself	1175	" But , "
313727	313766	313721	313721	himself	1175	" a new order of things is commencing ; we shall see . Leslie , it is lucky for you that you did not enter parliament under the government ; it would be your political ruin for life . "
313767	313781	313721	313721	himself	1175	" You think , then , that the ministry really can not last ? "
313782	313866	313721	313721	himself	1175	" Of course I do ; and what is more , I think that a ministry of the same principles can not be restored . You are a young man of talent and spirit ; your birth is nothing compared to the rank of the reigning party ; it would tell , to a certain degree , in a democratic one . I say , you should be more civil to Avenel ; he could return you to parliament at the next election . "
313867	313884	313721	313721	himself	1175	" The next election ! In six years ! We have just had a general election . "
313885	313909	313721	313721	himself	1175	" There will be another before this year , or half of it , or perhaps a quarter of it , is out . "
313910	313917	313721	313721	himself	1175	" What makes you think so ? "
313918	313939	313721	313721	himself	1175	" Leslie , let there be confidence between us ; we can help each other . Shall we be friends ? "
313940	313959	313721	313721	himself	1175	" With all my heart . But though you may help me , how can I help you ? "
313960	314046	313721	313721	himself	1175	" You have helped me already to Frank Hazeldean and the Casino estate . All clever men can help me . Come , then , we are friends ; and what I say is secret . You ask me why I think there will be a general election so soon ? I will answer you frankly . Of all the public men I ever met with , there is no one who has so clear a vision of things immediately before him as Audley Egerton . "
314047	314067	313721	313721	himself	1175	" He has that character . Not far - seeing , but clear - sighted to a certain limit . "
314068	314088	313721	313721	himself	1175	" Exactly so . No one better , therefore , knows public opinion and its immediate ebb and flow . "
314089	314092	313721	313721	himself	1175	" Granted . "
314093	314117	313721	313721	himself	1175	" Egerton , then , counts on a general election within three months , and I have lent him the money for it . "
314118	314135	314141	314141	Levy	1175	" Lent him the money ! Egerton borrow money of you , the rich Audley Egerton ! "
314136	314139	313721	313721	himself	1175	" Rich ! "
314170	314175	314187	314188	the latter	1552	" which indicates profound contempt .
314191	314214	314225	314225	Levy	1175	" But if Egerton is really not rich ; if he lose office , and without the hope of return to it - "
314215	314223	314308	314308	Levy	1175	" If so , he is ruined ! "
314229	314306	314316	314317	The servant	3272	" and therefore , from regard to you , and feeling interest in your future fate , I say , Rest no hopes of fortune or career upon Audley Egerton . Keep your place for the present , but be prepared at the next election to stand upon popular principles . Avenel shall return you to parliament ; and the rest is with luck and energy . And now , I 'll not detain you longer , "
314320	314326	314316	314317	The servant	3272	" Is my carriage here ? "
314327	314332	314316	314317	The servant	3272	" Yes , Baron . "
314333	314341	314316	314317	The servant	3272	" Can I set you down anywhere ? "
314342	314352	314316	314317	The servant	3272	" No , thank you , I prefer walking . "
314353	314370	314316	314317	The servant	3272	" Adieu , then . And mind you remember the soiree dansante at Mrs. Avenel 's . "
314417	314433	314316	314317	The servant	3272	" But what can be the man 's motive in what he said to me ? "
314439	314449	314316	314317	The servant	3272	" Egerton ruined ! What am I , then ? "
314455	314485	314316	314317	The servant	3272	" And that fair remnant of the old Leslie property ! L20,000 down - how to get the sum ? Why should Levy have spoken to me of this ? "
314494	314503	314577	314578	the baron	17518	" The man 's motives ! His motives ! "
314571	314575	314577	314578	the baron	17518	" Mon cher , "
314608	314630	314577	314578	the baron	17518	" mon cher , give me one of your excellent cigars . I think I have put all matters in train . "
314631	314637	314648	314649	the baron	17518	" You have found out - "
314638	314646	314648	314649	the baron	17518	" No ; not so fast yet , "
314658	314695	314577	314578	the baron	17518	" But you said that you should be perfectly contented if it only cost you L20,000 to marry off your sister to whom that sum is legally due , and to marry yourself to the heiress . "
314696	314702	314648	314649	the baron	17518	" I did , indeed . "
314703	314751	314577	314578	the baron	17518	" Then I have no doubt I shall manage both objects for that sum , if Randal Leslie really knows where the young lady is , and can assist you . Most promising , able man is Randal Leslie - but innocent as a babe just born . "
314752	314762	314648	314649	the baron	17518	" Ha , ha ! Innocent ? Que diable ! "
314763	314784	315850	315852	the young man	5338	" Innocent as this cigar , mon cher , - strong certainly , but smoked very easily . Soyez tranquille ! "
315843	315848	315850	315852	the young man	5338	" He will come , "
315854	315880	315954	315954	he	18894	" come here , - to the home which I owe to him . I have not been unworthy of his friendship . And she - "
315893	315953	315954	315954	he	18894	" Oh , strange , strange , that I feel sad at the thought to see her again ! See her - Ah , no ! my own comforting Helen , my own Child - angel ! Her I can never see again ! The grown woman - that is not my Helen . And yet - and yet , "
315960	316073	316114	316114	he	18894	" if ever she read the pages in which thought flowed and trembled under her distant starry light , if ever she see how her image has rested with me , and feel that , while others believe that I invent , I have but remembered , will she not , for a moment , be my own Helen again ? Again , in heart and in fancy , stand by my side on the desolate bridge , hand in hand , orphans both , as we stood in the days so sorrowful , yet , as I recall them , so sweet ? Helen in England - it is a dream ! "
316107	316113	316114	316114	he	18894	" And in this house , "
316117	316160	316285	316287	The young man	5338	" I saw her last ! And there , where the fountain now throws its spray on high , - there her benefactor and mine told me that I was to lose her , that I might win - fame . Alas ! "
316302	316333	316285	316287	The young man	5338	" My dear mother , good day to you . Ah , you do well to make the room look its best . Happy news ! I expect a visitor ! "
316334	316348	316285	316287	The young man	5338	" Dear me , Leonard , will he want lunch - or what ? "
316349	316383	316285	316287	The young man	5338	" Nay , I think not , Mother . It is he to whom we owe all , - ' Haec otia fecit . ' Pardon my Latin ; it is Lord L'Estrange . "
316421	316434	316449	316450	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Do not be alarmed , Mother . He is the kindest - "
316435	316447	316449	316450	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Do n't talk so ; I ca n't bear it ! "
316452	316527	316580	316580	she	1592	" No wonder you are affected by the recollection of all his benefits . But when once you have seen him , you will find yourself ever after at your ease . And so , pray smile and look as good as you are ; for I am proud of your open honest look when you are pleased , Mother . And he must see your heart in your face , as I do . "
316603	316606	316675	316675	she	1592	" the house "
316700	316717	316726	316727	Mrs. Fairfield	452	so,-"How neatly all is kept here . What could Leonard do without you , Mrs. Fairfield ? "
316734	316759	316823	316823	You	9788	" ' Deed , sir , and thank you kindly , but ' t is my belief that the drawin'-room would be awful dusty . "
316837	316844	317102	317102	Harley	503	" Sorrow had passed by there . "
317037	317048	317102	317102	Harley	503	" In den heitern Regionen Wo die reinen Formen wohnen . "
317052	317063	317941	317941	he	1064	" In the serene regions Where dwell the pure forms . "
317936	317939	317941	317941	he	1064	" These , "
317943	317983	318078	318078	Norreys	1064	" are the living ideas of the present , out of which books for the future will be written : study them ; and here , as in the volumes of the past , diligently amass and deliberately compile . "
318083	318099	318225	318225	Norreys	1064	" I need a compiler no longer , - maintain yourself by your own creations . "
318216	318223	318225	318225	Norreys	1064	" Be fully successful this time , "
318227	318299	318353	318353	Leonard	450	" think not of models nor of style . Strike at once at the common human heart , - throw away the corks , swim out boldly . One word more , - never write a page till you have walked from your room to Temple Bar , and , mingling with men , and reading the human face , learn why great poets have mostly passed their lives in cities . "
318346	318351	318353	318353	Leonard	450	" And , indeed , "
318368	318601	318621	318622	the widow	1592	" indeed , there is some chance that I may obtain at once a sum that will leave me free for the rest of my life to select my own subjects , and write without care for remuneration . This is what I call the true and , perhaps , alas ! the rare independence of him who devotes himself to letters . Norreys , having seen my boyish plan for the improvement of certain machinery in the steam engine , insisted on my giving much time to mechanics . The study that once pleased me so greatly now seemed dull ; but I went into it with good heart ; and the result is , that I have improved so far on my original idea , that my scheme has met the approbation of one of our most scientific engineers : and I am assured that the patent for it will be purchased of me upon terms which I am ashamed to name to you , so disproportioned do they seem to the value of so simple a discovery . Meanwhile , I am already rich enough to have realized the two dreams of my heart , - to make a home in the cottage where I had last seen you and Helen - I mean Miss Digby ; and to invite to that home her who had sheltered my infancy . "
318602	318615	318686	318686	Leonard	450	" Your mother , where is she ? Let me see her . "
318677	318684	318686	318686	Leonard	450	" And so overpowered is she , "
318688	318723	318729	318729	Harley	503	" by the recollection of all that we owe to you , that she never hears your name without agitation or tears , and trembled like a leaf at the thought of seeing you . "
318724	318727	318742	318742	he	503	" Ha ! "
318735	318740	318757	318757	he	503	" Is it so ? "
318753	318756	318757	318757	he	503	" And , "
318769	318801	318876	318876	L'Estrange	502	" and you ascribe this fear of seeing me , this agitation at my name , solely to an exaggerated sense of - of the circumstances attending my acquaintance with yourself ? "
318802	318828	318836	318836	Harley	503	" And , perhaps , to a sort of shame that the mother of one you have made her proud of is but a peasant . "
318829	318834	318876	318876	L'Estrange	502	" That is all ? "
318856	318875	318938	318938	Harley	503	" Oh , my dear Lord , what else can it be ? Do not judge her harshly . "
318954	318966	318917	318917	Leonard	450	" And Helen - Miss Digby - is she much changed ? "
318967	318977	318983	318983	Leonard	450	" Changed , no - yes ; very much . "
318978	318982	318917	318917	Leonard	450	" Very much ! "
318986	318993	318999	318999	Harley	503	" I shall see her again ? "
318994	318997	318999	318999	Harley	503	" Certainly , "
319007	319048	319075	319075	Leonard	450	" How can you doubt it ? And I reserve to you the pleasure of saying that you are renowned . You blush ; well , I will say that for you . But you shall give her your books . "
319049	319073	319075	319075	Leonard	450	" She has not yet read them , then ? - not the last ? The first was not worthy of her attention , "
319079	319128	319148	319148	he	503	" She has only just arrived in England ; and , though your books reached me in Germany , she was not then with me . When I have settled some business that will take me from town , I shall present you to her and my mother . "
319151	319206	319148	319148	he	503	" But you have shown poetry even here . I could not have conceived that so much beauty could be drawn from what appeared to me the most commonplace of all suburban gardens . Why , surely , where that charming fountain now plays stood the rude bench in which I read your verses . "
319207	319299	319148	319148	he	503	" It is true ; I wished to unite all together my happiest associations . I think I told you , my Lord , in one of my letters , that I had owed a very happy , yet very struggling time in my boyhood to the singular kindness and generous instructions of a foreigner whom I served . This fountain is copied from one that I made in his garden , and by the margin of which many a summer day I have sat and dreamed of fame and knowledge . "
319300	319341	319148	319148	he	503	" True , you told me of that ; and your foreigner will be pleased to hear of your success , and no less so of your grateful recollections . By the way , you did not mention his name . "
319342	319345	319148	319148	he	503	" Riccabocca . "
319346	319391	319399	319399	Leonard	450	" Riccabocca ! My own dear and noble friend ! - is it possible ? One of my reasons for returning to England is connected with him . You shall go down with me and see him . I meant to start this evening . "
319392	319397	319399	319399	Leonard	450	" My dear Lord , "
319401	319633	319148	319148	he	503	" I think that you may spare yourself so long a journey . I have reason to suspect that Signor Riccabocca is my nearest neighbour . Two days ago I was in the garden , when suddenly lifting my eyes to yon hillock I perceived the form of a man seated amongst the brushwood ; and though I could not see his features , there was something in the very outline of his figure and his peculiar posture , that irresistibly reminded me of Riccabocca . I hastened out of the garden and ascended the hill , but he was gone . My suspicions were so strong that I caused inquiry to be made at the different shops scattered about , and learned that a family consisting of a gentleman , his wife , and daughter had lately come to live in a house that you must have passed in your way hither , standing a little back from the road , surrounded by high walls ; and though they were said to be English , yet from the description given to me of the gentleman 's person by one who had noticed it , by the fact of a foreign servant in their employ , and by the very name ' Richmouth , ' assigned to the newcomers , I can scarcely doubt that it is the family you seek . "
319634	319643	319399	319399	Leonard	450	" And you have not called to ascertain ? "
319644	319749	319148	319148	he	503	" Pardon me , but the family so evidently shunning observation no one but the master himself ever seen without the walls , the adoption of another name too , led me to infer that Signor Riccabocca has some strong motive for concealment ; and now , with my improved knowledge of life , and recalling all the past , I can not but suppose that Riccabocca was not what he appeared . Hence , I have hesitated on formally obtruding myself upon his secrets , whatever they be , and have rather watched for some chance occasion to meet him in his walks . "
319750	319783	319399	319399	Leonard	450	" You did right , my dear Leonard ; but my reasons for seeing my old friend forbid all scruples of delicacy , and I will go at once to his house . "
319784	319798	319148	319148	he	503	" You will tell me , my Lord , if I am right . "
319799	319851	319862	319862	Leonard	450	" I hope to be allowed to do so . Pray , stay at home till I return . And now , ere I go , one question more : You indulge conjectures as to Riccabocca , because he has changed his name , - why have you dropped your own ? "
319852	319860	319862	319862	Leonard	450	" I wished to have no name , "
319867	319876	319148	319148	he	503	" but that which I could make myself . "
319877	319901	319917	319917	he	450	" Proud poet , this I can comprehend . But from what reason did you assume the strange and fantastic name of Oran ? "
319911	319915	319917	319917	he	450	" My Lord , "
319924	319938	319148	319148	he	503	" it is a childish fancy of mine ; it is an anagram . "
319939	319942	319917	319917	he	450	" Ah ! "
319943	320024	320035	320035	his	502	" At a time when my cravings after knowledge were likely much to mislead , and perhaps undo me , I chanced on some poems that suddenly affected my whole mind , and led me up into purer air ; and I was told that these poems were written in youth by one who had beauty and genius , - one who was in her grave , - a relation of my own , and her familiar name was Nora - "
320025	320028	320052	320054	the young author	9829	" Ah , "
320043	320050	320052	320054	the young author	9829	" So , somehow or other , "
320058	320110	320280	320280	he	502	" I wished that if ever I won to a poet 's fame , it might be to my own heart , at least , associated with this name of Nora ; with her whom death had robbed of the fame that she might otherwise have won ; with her who - "
320275	320279	320280	320280	he	502	" Vain task , "
320283	320313	320358	320358	He	502	" to wean myself from the dead ! Yet I am now betrothed to another ; and she , with all her virtues , is not the one to - "
320323	320357	320461	320465	a voice in imperfect English	9843	" Too late to think of that ! Now , all that should remain to me is to insure the happiness of the life to which I have pledged my own . But - "
320471	320495	320518	320518	Giacomo	487	" Lord L'Estrange ; and if I am right as to the person I seek , that name will at once admit me . "
320511	320516	320567	320567	he	502	" Open , Sesame ; "
320530	320551	320592	320592	Harley	503	" The good Lord ! Holy San Giacomo ! thou hast heard me at last ! We are safe now . "
320585	320590	320567	320567	he	502	" And the padrone ? "
320601	320623	320567	320567	he	502	" Oh , he is just gone out ; but he will not be long . You will wait for him ? "
320624	320641	320567	320567	he	502	" Certainly . What lady is that I see at the far end of the garden ? "
320642	320661	320567	320567	he	502	" Bless her , it is our signorina . I will run and tell her you are come . "
320662	320678	320567	320567	he	502	" That I am come ; but she can not know me even by name . "
320679	320723	320762	320762	he	503	" Ah , Excellency , can you think so ? Many and many a time has she talked to me of you , and I have heard her pray to the holy Madonna to bless you , and in a voice so sweet - "
320724	320758	320941	320941	Harley	503	" Stay , I will present myself to her . Go into the house , and we will wait without for the padrone . Nay , I need the air , my friend . "
320930	320939	320941	320941	Harley	503	" Pardon my want of ceremony , Signorina , "
320946	320969	321023	321023	she	800	" but I am so old a friend of your father 's that I can not feel as a stranger to yourself . "
321016	321022	321023	321023	she	800	" My father 's friend , "
321027	321036	321044	321044	Harley	503	" and I never to have seen you ! "
321037	321042	321044	321044	Harley	503	" Ah , Signorina , "
321063	321084	321104	321104	her	800	" you are mistaken there ; you have seen me before , and you received me much more kindly then . "
321085	321088	321193	321193	he	503	" Signor ! "
321186	321191	321193	321193	he	503	" Indeed , Signorina , "
321197	321227	321234	321234	Violante	800	" you insisted then on placing one of those fair hands in mine ; the other forgive me the fidelity of my recollections was affectionately thrown around my neck . "
321228	321231	321330	321330	he	503	" Signor ! "
321334	321378	321330	321330	he	503	" Your flatterers will tell you , Signorina , that you are much improved since then , but I liked you better as you were ; not but what I hope to return some day what you then so generously pressed upon me . "
321379	321396	321330	321330	he	503	" Pressed upon you ! - I ? Signor , you are under some strange mistake . "
321397	321433	321330	321330	he	503	" Alas ! no ; but the female heart is so capricious and fickle ! You pressed it upon me , I assure you . I own that I was not loath to accept it . "
321434	321441	321451	321451	Harley	503	" Pressed it ! Pressed what ? "
321442	321449	321451	321451	Harley	503	" Your kiss , my child , "
321462	321537	321604	321604	she	800	" and I again say that I hope to return it some day , when I see you , by the side of father and of husband , in your native land , - the fairest bride on whom the skies of Italy ever smiled ! And now , pardon a hermit and a soldier for his rude jests , and give your hand , in token of that pardon , to Harley L'Estrange . "
321591	321603	321823	321823	she	800	" Harley L'Estrange ! the preserver of my father 's life ! "
321819	321822	321823	321823	she	800	" Father , "
321827	321839	321970	321972	the admirable Charron	9874	" it is he , - he is come at last . "
321975	322032	322397	322397	he	1237	" judgment and wisdom is not only the best , but the happiest portion God Almighty hath distributed amongst men ; for though this distribution be made with a very uneven hand , yet nobody thinks himself stinted or ill - dealt with , but he that hath never so little is contented in this respect . "
322400	322415	322679	322682	A friend of mine	9901	" See , my son , how little wisdom it requires to govern States , "
322642	322650	322690	322690	he	9902	" the desire for something have have not "
322708	322749	322757	322758	the millionaire	9903	" Pray , Mr - - , will you answer me one question : You are said to have two millions , and you spend L600 a year . In order to rest and enjoy , what will content you ? "
322750	322755	322757	322758	the millionaire	9903	" A little more , "
322761	322764	322781	322783	a Latin writer	9905	" little more "
322776	322779	322781	322783	a Latin writer	9905	" Philus , "
322785	322822	322781	322783	a Latin writer	9905	" was not so rich as Laelius ; Laelius was not so rich as Scipio ; Scipio was not so rich as Crassus ; and Crassus was not so rich - as he wished to be ! "
322840	322843	322960	322961	the parson	1499	" little more "
322965	322969	323785	323785	Riccabocca	471	" non quieta movere "
323094	323115	323785	323785	Riccabocca	471	" And why have you left your home in - - -shire , and why this new change of name ? "
323116	323122	323785	323785	Riccabocca	471	" Peschiera is in England . "
323123	323128	323785	323785	Riccabocca	471	" I know it . "
323129	323149	323785	323785	Riccabocca	471	" And bent on discovering me ; and , it is said , of stealing from me my child . "
323150	323656	323785	323785	Riccabocca	471	" He has had the assurance to lay wagers that he will win the hand of your heiress . I know that too ; and therefore I have come to England , - first to baffle his design - for I do not think your fears altogether exaggerated , - and next to learn from you how to follow up a clew which , unless I am too sanguine , may lead to his ruin , and your unconditional restoration . Listen to me . You are aware that , after the skirmish with Peschiera 's armed hirelings sent in search of you , I received a polite message from the Austrian government , requesting me to leave its Italian domains . Now , as I hold it the obvious duty of any foreigner admitted to the hospitality of a State , to refrain from all participation in its civil disturbances , so I thought my honour assailed at this intimation , and went at once to Vienna , to explain to the minister there to whom I was personally known , that though I had , as became man to man , aided to protect a refugee , who had taken shelter under my roof , from the infuriated soldiers at the command of his private foe , I had not only not shared in any attempt at revolt , but dissuaded , as far as I could , my Italian friends from their enterprise ; and that because , without discussing its merits , I believed , as a military man and a cool spectator , the enterprise could only terminate in fruitless bloodshed . I was enabled to establish my explanation by satisfactory proof ; and my acquaintance with the minister assumed something of the character of friendship . I was then in a position to advocate your cause , and to state your original reluctance to enter into the plots of the insurgents . I admitted freely that you had such natural desire for the independence of your native land , that , had the standard of Italy been boldly hoisted by its legitimate chiefs , or at the common uprising of its whole people , you would have been found in the van , amidst the ranks of your countrymen ; but I maintained that you would never have shared in a conspiracy frantic in itself , and defiled by the lawless schemes and sordid ambition of its main projectors , had you not been betrayed and decoyed into it by the misrepresentations and domestic treachery of your kinsman , - the very man who denounced you . Unfortunately , of this statement I had no proof but your own word . I made , however , so far an impression in your favour , and , it may be , against the traitor , that your property was not confiscated to the State , nor handed over , upon the plea of your civil death , to your kinsman . "
323657	323671	323785	323785	Riccabocca	471	" How ! - I do not understand . Peschiera has the property ? "
323672	323784	323785	323785	Riccabocca	471	" He holds the revenues but of one half upon pleasure , and they would be withdrawn , could I succeed in establishing the case that exists against him . I was forbidden before to mention this to you ; the minister , not inexcusably , submitted you to the probation of unconditional exile . Your grace might depend upon your own forbearance from further conspiracies - forgive the word . I need not say I was permitted to return to Lombardy . I found , on my arrival , that - that your unhappy wife had been to my house , and exhibited great despair at hearing of my departure . "
323795	323846	323852	323852	Riccabocca	471	" I did not judge it necessary to acquaint you with this circumstance , nor did it much affect me . I believed in her guilt - and what could now avail her remorse , if remorse she felt ? Shortly afterwards , I heard that she was no more . "
323847	323850	323875	323876	a friend	15010	" Yes , "
323886	323886	323898	323898	L'Estrange	503	"
323887	323896	323898	323898	L'Estrange	503	" I come at once to that reason , "
323902	324161	324198	324199	the Italian	1688	" This autumn I was roaming through Switzerland , and , in one of my pedestrian excursions amidst the mountains , I met with an accident , which confined me for some days to a sofa at a little inn in an obscure village . My hostess was an Italian ; and as I had left my servant at a town at some distance , I required her attention till I could write to him to come to me . I was thankful for her cares , and amused by her Italian babble . We became very good friends . She told me she had been servant to a lady of great rank , who had died in Switzerland ; and that , being enriched by the generosity of her mistress , she had married a Swiss innkeeper , and his people had become hers . My servant arrived , and my hostess learned my name , which she did not know before . She came into my room greatly agitated . In brief , this woman had been servant to your wife . She had accompanied her to my villa , and known of her anxiety to see me , as your friend . The Government had assigned to your wife your palace at Milan , with a competent income . She had refused to accept of either . Failing to see me , she had set off towards England , resolved upon seeing yourself ; for the journals had stated that to England you had escaped . "
324162	324196	324210	324210	Harley	503	" She dared ! shameless ! And see , but a moment before , I had forgotten all but her grave in a foreign soil , - and these tears had forgiven her , "
324201	324208	324210	324210	Harley	503	" Let them forgive her still , "
324222	324320	324330	324330	Riccabocca	471	" I resume . On entering Switzerland your wife 's health , which you know was always delicate , gave way . To fatigue and anxiety succeeded fever , and delirium ensued . She had taken with her but this one female attendant - the sole one she could trust - on leaving home . She suspected Peschiera to have bribed her household . In the presence of this woman she raved of her innocence , in accents of terror and aversion denounced your kinsman , and called on you to vindicate her name and your own . "
324321	324328	324601	324601	Riccabocca	471	" Ravings indeed ! Poor Paulina ! "
324339	324599	324718	324718	Harley	503	" But in her delirium there were lucid intervals . In one of these she rose , in spite of all her servants could do to restrain her , took from her desk several letters , and reading them over , exclaimed piteously , ' But how to get them to him ; whom to trust ? And his friend is gone ! ' Then an idea seemed suddenly to flash upon her , for she uttered a joyous exclamation , sat down , and wrote long and rapidly , enclosed what she wrote with all the letters , in one packet , which she sealed carefully , and bade her servant carry to the post , with many injunctions to take it with her own hand , and pay the charge on it . ' For oh ! ' said she I repeat the words as my informant told them to me , - ' for oh ! this is my sole chance to prove to my husband that , though I have erred , I am not the guilty thing he believes me ; the sole chance , too , to redeem my error , and restore , perhaps , to my husband his country , to my child her heritage . ' The servant took the letter to the post ; and when she returned , her lady was asleep , with a smile upon her face . But from that sleep she woke again delirious , and before the next morning her soul had fled . "
324709	324716	324718	324718	Harley	503	" Be this as it may , "
324720	325074	325442	325442	he	503	" there seems every reason to suppose that the letters enclosed were Peschiera 's correspondence , and that , if so , these would establish the proof of his influence over your wife , and of his perfidious machinations against yourself . I resolved , before coming hither , to go round by Vienna . There I heard , with dismay , that Peschiera had not only obtained the imperial sanction to demand your daughter 's hand , but had boasted to his profligate circle that he should succeed ; and he was actually on his road to England . I saw at once that could this design , by any fraud or artifice , be successful with Violante for of your consent , I need not say , I did not dream , the discovery of the packet , whatever its contents , would be useless ; Peschiera 's end would be secured . I saw also that his success would suffice forever to clear his name ; for his success must imply your consent it would be to disgrace your daughter , to assert that she had married without it , and your consent would be his acquittal . I saw , too , with alarm , that to all means for the accomplishment of his project he would be urged by despair ; for his debts are great , and his character nothing but new wealth can support . I knew that he was able , bold , determined , and that he had taken with him a large supply of money borrowed upon usury , - in a word , I trembled for you both . I have now seen your daughter , and I tremble no more . Accomplished seducer as Peschiera boasts himself , the first look upon her face so sweet , yet so noble , convinced me that she is proof against a legion of Peschieras . Now , then , return we to this all - important subject , - to this packet . It never reached you . Long years have passed since then .
325075	325088	324718	324718	Harley	503	" Does it exist still ? Into whose hands would it have fallen ?
325089	325195	325207	325207	his	471	" Try to summon up all your recollections . The servant could not remember the name of the person to whom it was addressed ; she only insisted that the name began with a B , that it was directed to England , and that to England she accordingly paid the postage . Whom then , with a name that begins with B , or in case the servant 's memory here mislead her whom did you or your wife know , during your visit to England , with sufficient intimacy to make it probable that she would select such a person for her confidant ? "
325196	325202	325207	325207	his	471	" I can not conceive , "
325210	325331	325337	325337	Harley	503	" We came to England shortly after our marriage . Paulina was affected by the climate . She spoke not a word of English , and indeed not even French , as might have been expected from her birth , for her father was poor , and thoroughly Italian . She refused all society . I went , it is true , somewhat into the London world , - enough to induce me to shrink from the contrast that my second visit as a beggared refugee would have made to the reception I met with on my first ; but I formed no intimate friendships . I recall no one whom she could have written to as intimate with me . "
325332	325335	325337	325337	Harley	503	" But , "
325339	325368	325442	325442	he	503	" think again . Was there no lady well acquainted with Italian , and with whom , perhaps , for that very reason , your wife became familiar ? "
325369	325404	325413	325413	Harley	503	" Ah , it is true . There was one old lady of retired habits , but who had been much in Italy . Lady - Lady - I remember - Lady Jane Horton . "
325405	325411	325413	325413	Harley	503	" Horton - Lady Jane ! "
325415	325432	325442	325442	he	503	" again ; thrice in one day ! - is this wound never to scar over ? "
325445	325502	325442	325442	he	503	" Excuse me , my friend ; I listen to you with renewed interest . Lady Jane was a distant relation of my own ; she judged me , perhaps , harshly - and I have some painful associations with her name ; but she was a woman of many virtues . Your wife knew her ? "
325503	325708	325442	325442	he	503	" Not , however , intimately ; still , better than any one else in London . But Paulina would not have written to her ; she knew that Lady Jane had died shortly after her own departure from England . I myself was summoned back to Italy on pressing business ; she was too unwell to journey with me as rapidly as I was obliged to travel ; indeed , illness detained her several weeks in England . In this interval she might have made acquaintances . Ah , now I see ; I guess . You say the name began with B. Paulina , in my absence , engaged a companion , - a Mrs. Bertram . This lady accompanied her abroad . Paulina became excessively attached to her , she knew Italian so well . Mrs. Bertram left her on the road , and returned to England , for some private affairs of her own . I forget why or wherefore ; if , indeed , I ever asked or learned . Paulina missed her sadly , often talked of her , wondered why she never heard from her . No doubt it was to this Mrs. Bertram that she wrote ! "
325709	325723	325442	325442	he	503	" And you do n't know the lady 's friends , or address ? "
325724	325727	325442	325442	he	503	" No . "
325728	325737	325442	325442	he	503	" Nor who recommended her to your wife ? "
325738	325741	325442	325442	he	503	" No . "
325742	325748	325442	325442	he	503	" Probably Lady Jane Horton ? "
325749	325754	325442	325442	he	503	" It may be so .
325755	325759	325442	325442	he	503	" Very likely . "
325760	325773	325442	325442	he	503	" I will follow up this track , slight as it is . "
325774	325812	325442	325442	he	503	" But if Mrs. Bertram received the communication , how comes it that it never reached myself - Oh , fool that I am , how should it ! I , who guarded so carefully my incognito ! "
325813	325882	325442	325442	he	503	" True . This your wife could not foresee ; she would naturally imagine that your residence in England would be easily discovered . But many years must have passed since your wife lost sight of this Mrs. Bertram , if their acquaintance was made so soon after your marriage ; and now it is a long time to retrace , - before even your Violante was born . "
325883	325908	325442	325442	he	503	" Alas ! yes . I lost two fair sons in the interval . Violante was born to me as the child of sorrow . "
325909	325921	325442	325442	he	503	" And to make sorrow lovely ! how beautiful she is ! "
325927	325946	325442	325442	he	503	" Where , in the loftiest houses of Europe , find a husband worthy of such a prize ? "
325947	326011	325442	325442	he	503	" You forget that I am still an exile , she still dowerless . You forget that I am pursued by Peschiera ; that I would rather see her a beggar 's wife - than - Pah , the very thought maddens me , it is so foul . Corpo di Bacco ! I have been glad to find her a husband already . "
326012	326022	325442	325442	he	503	" Already ! Then that young man spoke truly ? "
326023	326028	325442	325442	he	503	" What young man ? "
326029	326039	326082	326082	he	503	" Randal Leslie . How ! You know him ? "
326068	326080	325442	325442	he	503	" There is something very suspicious to me in all this , "
326084	326109	325442	325442	he	503	" Why should this young man have so sounded me as to Violante 's chance of losing fortune if she married , an Englishman ? "
326110	326150	325442	325442	he	503	" Did he ? Oh , pooh ! Excuse him . It was but his natural wish to seem ignorant of all about me . He did not know enough of my intimacy with you to betray my secret . "
326151	326188	325442	325442	he	503	" But he knew enough of it - must have known enough - to have made it right that he should tell you I was in England . He does not seem to have done so . "
326189	326227	326239	326239	Harley	503	" No ; that is strange - yet scarcely strange ; for , when we last met , his head was full of other things , - love and marriage . Basta ! youth will be youth . "
326228	326237	326239	326239	Harley	503	" He has no youth left in him ! "
326243	326341	325442	325442	he	503	" I doubt if he ever had any . He is one of those men who come into the world with the pulse of a centenarian . You and I never shall be as old as he was in long clothes . Ah , you may laugh ; but I am never wrong in my instincts . I disliked him at the first , - his eye , his smile , his voice , his very footstep . It is madness in you to countenance such a marriage ; it may destroy all chance of your restoration . "
326342	326352	326360	326360	Harley	503	" Better that than infringe my word once passed . "
326353	326358	326360	326360	Harley	503	" No , no , "
326362	326427	325442	325442	he	503	" your word is not passed , it shall not be passed . Nay , never look so piteously at me . At all events , pause till we know more of this young man . If he be worthy of her without a dower , why , then , let him lose you your heritage . I should have no more to say . "
326428	326456	326360	326360	Harley	503	" But why lose me my heritage ? There is no law in Austria which can dictate to a father what husband to choose for his daughter . "
326457	326559	326586	326586	he	711	" Certainly not . But you are out of the pale of law itself just at present ; and it would surely be a reason for State policy to withhold your pardon , and it would be to the loss of that favour with your own countrymen , which would now make that pardon so popular , if it were known that the representative of your name were debased by your daughter 's alliance with an English adventurer , - a clerk in a public office . Oh , sage in theory , why are you such a simpleton in action ? "
326580	326584	326586	326586	he	711	" My friend , "
326588	326600	325442	325442	he	503	" the representation of my name would pass to my son . "
326601	326608	326586	326586	he	711	" But you have no son . "
326609	326648	326658	326658	Harley	503	" Hush ! I am going to have one ; my Jemima informed me of it yesterday morning ; and it was upon that information that I resolved to speak to Leslie . Am I a simpleton now ? "
326649	326656	326658	326658	Harley	503	" Going to have a son , "
326664	326676	326684	326685	the sage	3893	" how do you know it is to be a son ? "
326677	326682	326684	326685	the sage	3893	" Physiologists are agreed , "
326689	326762	326586	326586	he	711	" that where the husband is much older than the wife , and there has been a long interval without children before she condescends to increase the population of the world , she that is , it is at least as nine to four - she brings into the world a male . I consider that point therefore as settled , according to the calculations of statisticians and the researches of naturalists . "
326777	326790	326796	326796	Riccabocca	471	" The same man as ever ; always the fool of philosophy . "
326791	326794	326796	326796	Riccabocca	471	" Cospetto ! "
326798	326820	326586	326586	he	711	" I am rather the philosopher of fools . And talking of that , shall I present you to my Jemima ? "
326821	326875	326796	326796	Riccabocca	471	" Yes ; but in turn I must present you to one who remembers with gratitude your kindness , and whom your philosophy , for a wonder , has not ruined . Some time or other you must explain that to me . Excuse me for a moment ; I will go for him .
326876	326894	326586	326586	he	711	" For him , - for whom ? In my position I must be cautious ; and - "
326895	326920	326796	326796	Riccabocca	471	" I will answer for his faith and discretion . Meanwhile order dinner , and let me and my friend stay to share it . "
326921	326942	326586	326586	he	711	" Dinner ? Corpo di Bacco ! - not that Bacchus can help us here . What will Jemima say ? "
326943	326960	327052	327052	Harley	503	" Henpecked man , settle that with your connubial tyrant . But dinner it must be . "
327055	327072	327436	327436	Harley	503	" You shall see her whom he speaks of before long , and question her yourself . "
327450	327464	327516	327516	Riccabocca	471	" I thank you for the happiest hours I have known for years . "
327505	327514	327561	327561	He	471	" And when shall I see you again ? "
327527	327560	327698	327698	he	487	" When ? Why , of course , to - morrow . Adieu ! my friend . No wonder you have borne your exile so patiently , - with such a child ! "
327691	327696	327698	327698	he	487	" I have heard , "
327700	327743	327755	327755	Riccabocca	471	" how a town in Italy - I think it was Bologna - was once taken and given to the sword , by incautiously admitting a wooden horse full of the troops of Barbarossa and all manner of bombs and Congreve rockets . "
327744	327753	327755	327755	Riccabocca	471	" The story is differently told in Virgil , "
327763	327777	327783	327783	Violante	800	" Nevertheless , the machine looks very large and suspicious ; unloose Pompey . "
327778	327781	327783	327783	Violante	800	" Father , "
327787	327801	327755	327755	Riccabocca	471	" it is your friend , Lord L'Estrange ; I hear his voice . "
327802	327807	327783	327783	Violante	800	" Are you sure ? "
327808	327817	327755	327755	Riccabocca	471	" Quite . How can I be mistaken ? "
327818	327841	327874	327874	Riccabocca	471	" Go , then , Giacomo ; but take Pompey with thee , - and give the alarm if we are deceived . "
327869	327872	327874	327874	Riccabocca	471	" Ah , "
327884	327909	328383	328383	himself	3893	" go , my child , and summon Jemima . Man to man ; but , for Heaven 's sake , woman to woman . "
328388	328395	328430	328430	she	510	" it was Woman to Woman . "
328425	328429	328430	328430	she	510	" My son , "
328441	328466	328502	328502	Harley	503	" my son in vain told me not to be surprised . This is the first time I have ever known reality exceed description ! "
328493	328500	328630	328630	Violante	800	" Miss Digby , my ward , "
328641	328652	328633	328635	the less shy	9983	" You are his ward , - Lord L'Estrange 's ? "
328653	328656	328630	328630	Violante	800	" Yes . "
328657	328666	328633	328635	the less shy	9983	" Perhaps you came with him from Italy ? "
328667	328683	328630	328630	Violante	800	" No , not exactly ; but I have been in Italy for some years . "
328684	328722	328633	328635	the less shy	9983	" Ah ! you regret - nay , I am foolish - you return to your native land . But the skies in Italy are so blue , - here it seems as if Nature wanted colours . "
328723	328751	328630	328630	Violante	800	" Lord L'Estrange says that you were very young when you left Italy ; you remember it well . He , too , prefers Italy to England . "
328752	328757	328767	328767	Harley	503	" He ! Impossible ! "
328758	328765	328801	328801	she	800	" Why impossible , fair sceptic ? "
328805	328818	328819	328819	Harley	503	" Because in England there is the noblest career for noble minds . "
328831	328870	328790	328790	she	800	" At your age I should have said as you do . But this England of ours is so crowded with noble minds that they only jostle each other , and the career is one cloud of dust . "
328871	328892	328819	328819	Harley	503	" So , I have read , seems a battle to a common soldier , but not to the chief . "
328893	328905	328906	328907	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" You have read good descriptions of battles , I see . "
328929	328949	328950	328950	HARLEY	503	" Her papa made her read the history of Italy , and I believe that is full of battles . "
328953	328973	328974	328974	VIOLANTE	800	" All history is , and all women are fond of war and of warriors . I wonder why ? "
328996	329007	329008	329008	HARLEY	503	" We can guess why , - can we not ? "
329027	329039	329040	329040	HELEN	894	" If you can guess , Helen , pray tell me . "
329056	329067	329068	329068	HARLEY	503	" But I am not fond of war and warriors . "
329073	329102	329103	329103	VIOLANTE	800	" Then I must appeal at once to you , self - convicted Bellona that you are . Is it from the cruelty natural to the female disposition ? "
329110	329120	329121	329121	HARLEY	503	" From two propensities still more natural to it . "
329124	329134	329135	329135	VIOLANTE	800	" YOU puzzle me : what can they be ? "
329138	329152	329180	329180	she	822	" Pity and admiration ; we pity the weak and admire the brave . "
329176	329179	329135	329135	VIOLANTE	800	" Charming ! "
329183	329215	329257	329257	He	503	" You have explained what has often perplexed me . Ah , Harley , I am glad to see that your satire is foiled : you have no reply to that . "
329216	329256	329257	329257	He	503	" No ; I willingly own myself defeated , too glad to claim the signorina 's pity , since my cavalry sword hangs on the wall , and I can have no longer a professional pretence to her admiration . "
329267	329304	329312	329312	Riccabocca	742	" But I see a more formidable disputant for my conqueror to encounter is coming into the field , - one whose profession it is to substitute some other romance for that of camp and siege . "
329305	329310	329315	329315	his	503	" Our friend Leonard , "
329322	329358	329440	329440	he	503	" True ; as Quevedo says , wittily , ' Ever since there has been so great a demand for type , there has been much less lead to spare for cannon - balls . ' "
329403	329424	329451	329451	he	503	" The friend of whom I spoke . Welcome him now for my sake , ever after for his own ; "
329446	329449	329517	329517	He	503	" Children , "
329466	329516	329517	329517	He	503	" go and seat yourselves yonder , and talk together of the past . Signorina , I invite you to renewed discussion upon the abstruse metaphysical subject you have started ; let us see if we can not find gentler sources for pity and admiration than war and warriors . "
329525	329615	329616	329616	VIOLANTE	800	" You remember that Leonard , in telling you his history last night , spoke , you thought , rather too briefly of the little girl who had been his companion in the rudest time of his trials . When you would have questioned more , I interrupted you , and said , ' You should see her shortly , and question her yourself . ' And now what think you of Helen Digby ? Hush , speak low . But her ears are not so sharp as mine . "
329619	329648	329649	329649	HARLEY	503	" Ah ! that is the fair creature whom Leonard called his child - angel ? What a lovely innocent face ! - the angel is there still . "
329663	329709	329819	329819	she	800	" You think so ; and you are right . Helen is not communicative . But fine natures are like fine poems , - a glance at the first two lines suffices for a guess into the beauty that waits you if you read on . "
329815	329818	329839	329839	She	800	" True , "
329825	329838	329819	329819	she	800	" there is more here to move pity and admiration than in - "
329845	329863	329864	329864	VIOLANTE	800	" Complete the sentence . Are you ashamed to retract ? Fie on your pride and obstinacy ! "
329867	329924	329940	329940	Harley	503	" No ; but even here there have been war and heroism , - the war of genius with adversity , and heroism in the comforter who shared it and consoled . Ah , wherever pity and admiration are both felt , something nobler than mere sorrow must have gone before : the heroic must exist . "
329925	329938	329940	329940	Harley	503	" Helen does not know what the word ' heroic ' means , "
329945	329951	329959	329959	he	503	" you must teach her . "
329952	329957	329993	329993	he	503	" Is it possible , "
329964	329992	330067	330067	you	800	" that a Randal Leslie could have charmed this grand creature ? No ' Heroic ' surely , in that sleek young placeman . - Your father , "
330071	330071	330078	330078	Violante	800	"
330072	330076	330078	330078	Violante	800	" Like him , "
330091	330097	330103	330103	Harley	503	" like him - yes . "
330098	330101	330103	330103	Harley	503	" Why ? "
330111	330126	330078	330078	Violante	800	" His visits seem to please my dear father . Certainly I like him . "
330127	330139	330144	330144	She	800	" Hum . He professes to like you , I suppose ? "
330152	330158	330186	330186	Harley	503	" Is that so strange ? "
330176	330184	330186	330186	Harley	503	" I am told he is clever , "
330188	330193	330160	330160	her	800	" Oh , certainly . "
330194	330209	330186	330186	Harley	503	" And he is rather handsome . But I like Leonard 's face better . "
330210	330249	330257	330257	Harley	503	" Better - that is not the word . Leonard 's face is as that of one who has gazed so often upon Heaven ; and Mr. Leslie 's - there is neither sunlight nor starlight reflected there . "
330250	330255	330301	330301	Helen	894	" My dear Violante ? "
330317	330337	330385	330386	the widow	1592	" Leonard 's mother is with him : he asks me to call and see her . May I ? "
330338	330369	330301	330301	Helen	894	" May you ! A pretty notion the signorina must form of your enslaved state of pupilage , when she hears you ask that question . Of course you may . "
330370	330377	330435	330435	he	503	" Will you come with us ? "
330427	330433	330490	330490	she	800	" Another time , then , "
330479	330488	330490	330490	she	800	" Can not I go with Miss Digby ? "
330492	330516	330524	330524	Harley	503	" and my mother will go too . We both know Mrs. Fairfield . We shall be so pleased to see her again . "
330517	330522	330524	330524	Harley	503	" So be it , "
330526	330580	330616	330617	the countess	8099	" I will wait here with your father till you come back . Oh , as to my mother , she will excuse the - excuse Madame Riccabocca , and you too . See how charmed she is with your father . I must stay to watch over the conjugal interests of mine . "
330622	330633	330639	330639	Harley	503	" But I will call myself , with Miss Digby . "
330634	330637	330639	330639	Harley	503	" No , "
330648	330661	330667	330668	the countess	8099	" No ; I would rather not . I will explain later . "
330662	330665	330667	330668	the countess	8099	" Then , "
330680	330710	330717	330717	Riccabocca	742	" I must insist on your performing this visit , my dear madam , and you , Signorina . In truth , I have something to say confidentially to - "
330711	330715	330717	330717	Riccabocca	742	" To me , "
330719	330761	330767	330768	Lady Lansmere	822	" Ah , Madame la Comtesse , you restore me to five - and - twenty . Go , quick , O jealous and injured wife ; go , both of you , quick ; and you , too , Harley . "
330762	330765	330767	330768	Lady Lansmere	822	" Nay , "
330775	330815	330959	330959	she	800	" Harley must stay , for my design is not at present upon destroying your matrimonial happiness , whatever it may be later . It is a design so innocent that my son will be a partner in it . "
330954	330958	330959	330959	she	800	" I wonder , "
330963	330987	330996	330998	the good Jemima	528	" how Miss Digby became Lord L'Estrange 's ward . I hope she is not very rich , nor very high - born . "
330988	330994	330996	330998	the good Jemima	528	" La , my love , "
331000	331017	331077	331077	she	800	" that is not like you ; you are not envious of her , poor girl ? "
331018	331066	331085	331085	she	800	" Envious ! Dear mamma , what a word ! But do n't you think Leonard and Miss Digby seem born for each other ? And then the recollections of their childhood - the thoughts of childhood are so deep , and its memories so strangely soft ! "
331080	331084	331085	331085	she	800	" And therefore , "
331093	331111	331122	331122	Jemima	528	" therefore I hoped that Miss Digby might not be very rich nor very high - born . "
331112	331120	331122	331122	Jemima	528	" I understand you now , Violante , "
331137	331215	331349	331349	she	894	" for as Leonard , however clever and distinguished , is still the son of Mark Fairfield the carpenter , it would spoil all if - Miss Digby was , as you say , rich and high - born . I agree with you , - a very pretty match , a very pretty match , indeed . I wish dear - Mrs. Dale were here now , - she is so clever in settling such matters . "
331316	331348	331349	331349	she	894	" And have you ever heard more of the good Dr. Morgan , who had powders against sorrow , and who meant to be so kind to us , - though , "
331354	331362	331375	331375	Leonard	1253	" we did not think so then ? "
331363	331373	331375	331375	Leonard	1253	" He took my child - angel from me , "
331381	331412	331349	331349	she	894	" and if she had not returned , where and what should I be now ? But I have forgiven him . No , I have never met him since . "
331413	331420	331375	331375	Leonard	1253	" And that terrible Mr. Burley ? "
331421	331487	331349	331349	she	894	" Poor , poor Burley ! He , too , is vanished out of my present life . I have made many inquiries after him ; all I can hear is that he went abroad , supposed as a correspondent to some journal . I should like so much to see him again , now that perhaps I could help him as he helped me . "
331488	331494	331375	331375	Leonard	1253	" Helped you - ah ! "
331532	331666	331775	331775	Helen	894	" Helped me much by his instructions ; more , perhaps , by his very faults . You can not guess , Helen , - I beg pardon , Miss Digby , but I forgot that we are no longer children , - you can not guess how much we men , and more than all , perhaps , we writers whose task it is to unravel the web of human actions , owe even to our own past errors ; and if we learned nothing by the errors of others , we should be dull indeed . We must know where the roads divide , and have marked where they lead to , before we can erect our sign - post ; and books are the sign - posts in human life . "
331667	331773	331775	331775	Helen	894	" Books ! and I have not yet read yours . And Lord L'Estrange tells me you are famous now . Yet you remember me still , - the poor orphan child , whom you first saw weeping at her father 's grave , and with whom you burdened your own young life , over - burdened already . No , still call me Helen - you must always be to me a brother ! Lord L'Estrange feels that ; he said so to me when he told me that we were to meet again . He is so generous , so noble . Brother ! "
331796	331824	331931	331931	his	1253	" brother , we will never forfeit his esteem ; we will both do our best to repay him ! Will we not ? - say so ! "
331881	331884	331931	331931	his	1253	" brother , "
331911	331912	331923	331923	he	1253	" ?
331913	331922	331965	331966	Mrs. Riccabocca	742	" She is above me now and evermore ! "
331992	332008	332019	332019	Leonard	1253	" But is that your house , Leonard ? I never saw anything so pretty . "
332009	332017	332019	332019	Leonard	1253	" You do not remember it then , "
332030	332108	332116	332116	Helen	894	" there where I saw you last ? I doubted whether to keep it exactly as it was , and I said , ' - No ! the association is not changed because we try to surround it with whatever beauty we can create ; the dearer the association , the more the Beautiful becomes to it natural . ' Perhaps you do n't understand this , - perhaps it is only we poor poets who do . "
332109	332114	332120	332120	She	894	" I understand it , "
332127	332172	332469	332469	she	894	" So changed ! I have so often pictured it to myself , never , never like this ; yet I loved it , commonplace as it was to my recollection ; and the garret , and the tree in the carpenter 's yard . "
332464	332468	332469	332469	she	894	" Poor Leonard , "
332474	332497	332505	332505	Leonard	695	" the rest of the house so neat , but no one to take care of his own room and of him ! "
332510	332536	332505	332505	Leonard	695	" It would be a cruel kindness to the spider , if the gentlest band in the world tried to set its cobweb to rights . "
332540	332552	332553	332553	LEONARD	695	" You were not quite so bad in the old days . "
332556	332601	332602	332602	HELEN	894	" Yet even then you were obliged to take care of the money . I have more books now , and more money . My present housekeeper lets me take care of the books , but she is less indulgent as to the money . "
332606	332614	332615	332615	LEONARD	695	" Are you as absent as ever ? "
332618	332634	332635	332635	HELEN	894	" Much more so , I fear . The habit is incorrigible , Miss Digby - "
332638	332649	332650	332650	LEONARD	695	" Not Miss Digby ; sister , if you like . "
332662	332729	332741	332741	she	894	" Helen , will you grant me a favour ? Your eyes and your smile say ' yes . ' Will you lay aside , for one minute , your shawl and bonnet ? What ! can you be surprised that I ask it ? Can you not understand that I wish for one minute to think that you are at home again under this roof ? "
332771	332774	332838	332838	his	695	" brother , "
332845	332862	332874	332874	her	894	" Ah , as now so could it be forever ! Is the home too mean ? "
332866	332868	332957	332957	she	894	" brother "
332945	332956	332969	332969	she	894	" But - we are keeping Lady Lansmere too long , "
332961	332967	333024	333024	she	894	" We must go now , "
333020	333023	333024	333024	she	894	" Nay , "
333027	333046	333052	333053	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" your son and I are such old friends , how could you stand on ceremony with me ? "
333047	333051	333081	333082	the widow	1592	" Old friends ! "
333071	333079	333081	333082	the widow	1592	" Pretty , nice - spoken thing , "
333084	333117	333173	333173	she	452	" as nice - spoken as Miss Violante , and humbler - looking like , - though , as to dress , I never see anything so elegant out of a picter . "
333166	333172	333212	333212	she	452	" ' Deed , boy , "
333181	333211	333212	333212	she	452	" but there 'd be no more fine books , if the Lord had not fixed your head on your shoulders . You would not think it , marm , "
333218	333244	333270	333270	Leonard	695	" but sin ' he has left you , he 's not the ' cute lad he was ; very helpless at times , marm ! "
333277	333292	333300	333300	Leonard	695	" But where before have you seen that pretty young lady ? Old friends ! "
333293	333298	333300	333300	Leonard	695	" Ah , Mother , "
333304	333323	333442	333442	she	822	" it is a long tale ; you have heard the beginning , who can guess the end ? "
333410	333426	333442	333442	she	822	" And what right hast thou to hope because thou lovest ? All love her . "
333477	333624	333634	333634	Riccabocca	742	" Harley , in bringing me to visit you , was forced to reveal to me your incognito , for I should have discovered it . You may not remember me , in spite of your gallantry ; but I mixed more in the world than I do now , during your first visit to England , and once sat next to you at dinner at Carlton House . Nay , no compliments , but listen to me . Harley tells me you have cause for some alarm respecting the designs of an audacious and unprincipled adventurer , I may call him ; for adventurers are of all ranks . Suffer your daughter to come to me on a visit , as long as you please . With me , at least , she will be safe ; and if you , too , and the - "
333625	333632	333634	333634	Riccabocca	742	" Stop , my dear madam , "
333640	333660	333666	333666	his	10055	" your kindness overpowers me . I thank you most gratefully for your invitation to my child ; but - "
333661	333664	333669	333669	Harley	503	" Nay , "
333671	333894	333954	333954	he	10056	" no buts . I was not aware of my mother 's intention when she entered this room . But since she whispered it to me , I have reflected on it , and am convinced that it is but a prudent precaution . Your retreat is known to Mr. Leslie , he is known to Peschiera . Grant that no indiscretion of Mr. Leslie 's betray the secret ; still I have reason to believe that the count guesses Randal 's acquaintance with you . Audley Egerton this morning told me he had gathered that , not from the young man himself , but from questions put to himself by Madame di Negra ; and Peschiera might and would set spies to track Leslie to every house that he visits , - might and would , still more naturally , set spies to track myself . Were this man an Englishman , I should laugh at his machinations ; but he is an Italian , and has been a conspirator . What he could do I know not ; but an assassin can penetrate into a camp , and a traitor can creep through closed walls to one 's hearth . With my mother , Violante must be safe ; that you can not oppose . And why not come yourself ? "
333947	333952	333954	333954	he	10056	" To say truth , "
333958	334289	334330	334330	Harley	503	" I made a secret vow , on re - entering England , that I would associate with none who knew the rank I had formerly held in my own land . I felt that all my philosophy was needed to reconcile and habituate myself to my altered circumstances . In order to find in my present existence , however humble , those blessings which make all life noble , - dignity and peace , - it was necessary for poor , weak human nature wholly to dismiss the past . It would unsettle me sadly , could I come to your house , renew awhile , in your kindness and respect - nay , in the very atmosphere of your society - the sense of what I have been ; and then should the more than doubtful chance of recall from my exile fail me to awake , and find myself for the rest of life what I am . And though , were I alone , I might trust myself perhaps to the danger , yet my wife : she is happy and contented now ; would she be so , if you had once spoiled her for the simple position of Dr. Riccabocca 's wife ? Should I not have to listen to regrets and hopes and fears that would prick sharp through my thin cloak of philosophy ? Even as it is , since in a moment of weakness I confided my secret to her , I have had ' my rank ' thrown at me , - with a careless hand , it is true , but it hits hard nevertheless . No stone hurts like one taken from the ruins of one 's own home ; and the grander the home , why , the heavier the stone ! Protect , dear madam , protect my daughter , since her father doubts his own power to do so . But - ask no more . "
334320	334328	334330	334330	Harley	503	" And now , one word more , "
334332	334550	334560	334560	Riccabocca	463	" Do not confide to Mr. Leslie these arrangements ; do not let him know where Violante is placed , - at least , until I authorize such confidence in him . It is sufficient excuse that it is no use to know unless he called to see her , and his movements , as I said before , may be watched . You can give the same reason to suspend his visits to yourself . Suffer me , meanwhile , to mature my judgment on this young man . In the meanwhile , also , I think that I shall have means of ascertaining the real nature of Peschiera 's schemes . His sister has sought to know me ; I will give her the occasion . I have heard some things of her in my last residence abroad , which make me believe that she can not be wholly the count 's tool in any schemes nakedly villanous ; that she has some finer qualities in her than I once supposed ; and that she can be won from his influence . It is a state of war ; we will carry it into the enemy 's camp . You will promise me , then , to refrain from all further confidence in Mr. Leslie ? "
334551	334558	334330	334330	Harley	503	" For the present , yes , "
334564	334614	334330	334330	Harley	503	" Do not even say that you have seen me , unless he first tell you that I am in England , and wish to learn your residence . I will give him full occasion to do so . Pish ! do n't hesitate ; you know your own proverb -
334615	334629	334330	334330	Harley	503	" ' Boccha chiusa , ed occhio aperto Non fece mai nissun deserto . '
334630	334642	334651	334652	the doctor	1651	" The closed mouth and the open eye , ' etc . "
334643	334649	334651	334652	the doctor	1651	" That 's very true , "
334657	334693	334727	334728	The countess	8099	" Very true . ' In boccha chiusa non c'entrano mosche . ' One ca n't swallow flies if one keeps one 's mouth shut . Corpo di Bacco ! that 's very true indeed . "
334741	334749	334973	334973	Harley	503	" Certainly , the sooner the better . "
334979	335011	335012	335012	HELEN	894	" You are not sorry that Violante is coming to us ? She will be just such a companion for you as I could desire ; of your own years too . "
335016	335030	335031	335031	HARLEY	503	" It is hard to think I am not younger than she is . "
335034	335041	335042	335042	HELEN	894	" Why , my dear Helen ? "
335045	335059	335060	335060	HARLEY	503	" She is so brilliant . She talks so beautifully . And I - "
335063	335082	335195	335195	Jackeymo	485	" And you want but the habit of talking , to do justice to your own beautiful thoughts . "
335188	335193	335195	335195	Jackeymo	485	" She is gone , "
335206	335217	335229	335229	Riccabocca	463	" But it is a load off one 's mind . "
335218	335227	335229	335229	Riccabocca	463	" And another load on one 's heart , "
335231	335286	335410	335410	his	500	" Do n't cry , Jemima ; it may be bad for you , and bad for him that is to come . It is astonishing how the humours of the mother may affect the unborn . I should not like to have a son who has a more than usual propensity to tears . "
335413	335456	335474	335474	He	503	" Excuse me , my dear Harley , I have only ten minutes to give you . I expect one of the royal dukes , and punctuality is the stern virtue of men of business , and the graceful courtesy of princes . "
335484	335501	335557	335557	he	503	" Before I speak of my business , tell me how you are , - better ? "
335502	335555	335905	335905	Harley	503	" Better , - nay , I am always well . Pooh ! I may look a little tired , - years of toil will tell on the countenance . But that matters little : the period of life has passed with me when one cares how one looks in the glass . "
335613	335622	335728	335728	Harley	503	" So now to your business , Harley . "
335623	335654	335905	335905	Harley	503	" In the first place , I want you to present me , at the earliest opportunity , to Madame di Negra . You say she wished to know me . "
335655	335660	335728	335728	Harley	503	" Are you serious ? "
335661	335664	335905	335905	Harley	503	" Yes . "
335665	335689	335728	335728	Harley	503	" Well , then , she receives this evening . I did not mean to go ; but when my party breaks up - "
335690	335702	335728	335728	Harley	503	" You can call for me at The Travellers . Do ! "
335703	335727	335732	335732	Egerton	500	" Next , you knew Lady Jane Horton better even than I did , at least in the last year of her life . "
335739	335760	335767	335767	Egerton	500	" Pray , did you ever see at her house , or hear her speak of , a Mrs. Bertram ? "
335761	335765	335728	335728	Harley	503	" Of whom ? "
335782	335803	335732	335732	Egerton	500	" A Mrs. Bertram ; but heavens ! my dear fellow , what is the matter ? Are you ill ? "
335804	335836	335728	335728	Harley	503	" A spasm at the heart , that is all ; do n't ring , I shall be better presently ; go on talking . Mrs. - why do you ask ? "
335837	335895	335732	335732	Egerton	500	" Why ? I have hardly time to explain ; but I am , as I told you , resolved on righting my old Italian friend , if Heaven will help me , as it ever does help the just when they bestir themselves ; and this Mrs. Bertram is mixed up in my friend 's affairs . "
335896	335904	335936	335936	he	500	" His ! How is that possible ? "
335939	335980	335728	335728	Harley	503	" I remember something of this Mrs. - Mrs. - Bertram . But your inquiries after her would be useless . I think I have heard that she is long since dead ; nay , I am sure of it . "
335981	336018	335936	335936	he	500	" Dead ! - that is most unfortunate . But do you know any of her relations or friends ? Can you suggest any mode of tracing this packet , if it came to her hands ? "
336019	336022	335728	335728	Harley	503	" No . "
336023	336100	336109	336109	Egerton	500	" And Lady Jane had scarcely any friend that I remember except my mother , and she knows nothing of this Mrs. Bertram . How unlucky ! I think I shall advertise . Yet , no . I could only distinguish this Mrs. Bertram from any other of the same name , by stating with whom she had gone abroad , and that would catch the attention of Peschiera , and set him to counterwork us . "
336101	336107	336124	336124	He	500	" And what avails it ? "
336111	336123	336124	336124	He	500	" She whom you seek is no more - no more ! "
336132	336161	336235	336235	he	500	" The packet did not arrive in England till years after her death , was no doubt returned to the post - office , is destroyed long ago . "
336238	336246	336235	336235	he	500	" Hark ! you must excuse me . "
336247	336267	336235	336235	he	500	" I leave you , my dear Audley . But I must again ask , Are you better now ? "
336268	336290	336535	336535	ladies	1764	" Much , much , - quite well : I will call for you , - probably between eleven and twelve . "
336562	336566	336902	336902	Randal	570	" charming women , "
336908	336938	336952	336952	Randal	570	" Pray , what age should you say L'Estrange was ? He must be devilish old , in spite of his looks . Why , he was at Waterloo ! "
336939	336950	337532	337532	she	1130	" He is young enough to be a terrible rival , "
337522	337530	337799	337799	Beatrice	1130	" It is long , my Lord , "
337587	337599	337799	337799	Beatrice	1130	" She took a book from the table as she spoke : "
337606	337606	337607	337607	Harley	503	"
337615	337628	337799	337799	Beatrice	1130	" To be sure I have , and I know the author . "
337629	337660	337607	337607	Harley	503	" I envy you that honour . I should so like also to know one who has discovered to me deeps in my own heart which I had never explored . "
337661	337722	337799	337799	Beatrice	1130	" Charming marchesa , if the book has done this , believe me that I have paid you no false compliment , - formed no overflattering estimate of your nature ; for the charm of the work is but in its simple appeal to good and generous emotions , and it can charm none in whom those emotions exist not ! "
337723	337739	337607	337607	Harley	503	" Nay , that can not be true , or why is it so popular ? "
337740	337763	337799	337799	Beatrice	1130	" Because good and generous emotions are more common to the human heart than we are aware of till the appeal comes . "
337764	337781	337607	337607	Harley	503	" Do n't ask me to think that ! I have found the world so base . "
337782	337798	337799	337799	Beatrice	1130	" Pardon me a rude question ; but what do you know of the world ? "
337816	337879	337607	337607	Harley	503	" As I thought ; you call this little room ' the world . ' Be it so . I will venture to say , that if the people in this room were suddenly converted into an audience before a stage , and you were as consummate in the actor 's art as you are in all others that please and command - "
337880	337883	337799	337799	Beatrice	1130	" Well ? "
337884	338008	337607	337607	Harley	503	" And were to deliver a speech full of sordid and base sentiments , you would be hissed . But let any other woman , with half your powers , arise and utter sentiments sweet and womanly , or honest and lofty , and applause would flow from every lip , and tears rush to many a worldly eye . The true proof of the inherent nobleness of our common nature is in the sympathy it betrays with what is noble wherever crowds are collected . Never believe the world is base ; if it were so , no society could hold together for a day . But you would know the author of this book ? I will bring him to you . "
338009	338012	338019	338019	Harley	503	" Do . "
338013	338017	338019	338019	Harley	503	" And now , "
338031	338041	337607	337607	Harley	503	" do you think we shall ever be friends ? "
338042	338063	338019	338019	Harley	503	" You have startled me so that I can scarcely answer . But why would you be friends with me ? "
338064	338075	338082	338082	Beatrice	1130	" Because you need a friend . You have none ? "
338076	338080	338105	338105	Harley	503	" Strange flatterer ! "
338100	338103	338105	338105	Harley	503	" Pooh ! "
338107	338166	338192	338192	Beatrice	1130	" you are too penetrating to believe that you inspire friendship there . Ah , do you suppose that ; all the while I have been conversing with you , I have not noticed the watchful gaze of Mr. Randal Leslie ? What tie can possibly connect you together I know not yet ; but I soon shall . "
338167	338190	338226	338226	L'Estrange	502	" Indeed ! you talk like one of the old Council of Venice . You try hard to make me fear you , "
338220	338224	338242	338242	He	503	" And I , "
338230	338241	338401	338401	he	503	" tell you already that I fear you no more . "
338390	338399	338401	338401	he	503	" You are like me , Mr. Hazeldean , "
338403	338418	338360	338360	Harley	503	" You think something of the heart should go with all courtesy that bespeaks friendship -
338419	338430	338432	338432	Harley	503	" ' The hand of Douglas is his own . ' "
338437	338474	338493	338493	Randal	570	" Mr. Leslie , a word with you . If I wished to know the retreat of Dr. Riccabocca , in order to render him a great service , would you confide to me that secret ? "
338475	338491	338502	338502	he	570	" That woman has let out her suspicions that I know the exile 's retreat , "
338507	338534	338432	338432	Harley	503	" My Lord , yonder stands a connection of Dr. Riccabocca 's . Mr. Hazeldean is surely the person to whom you should address this inquiry . "
338535	338609	338616	338616	Randal	570	" Not so , Mr. Leslie ; for I suspect that he can not answer it , and that you can . Well , I will ask something that it seems to me you may grant without hesitation . Should you see Dr. Riccabocca , tell him that I am in England , and so leave it to him to communicate with me or not ; but perhaps you have already done so ? "
338610	338614	338616	338616	Randal	570	" Lord L'Estrange , "
338625	338714	338769	338769	he	570	" excuse me if I decline either to disclaim or acquiesce in the knowledge you impute to me . If I am acquainted with any secret intrusted to me by Dr. Riccabocca , it is for me to use my own discretion how best to guard it . And for the rest , after the Scotch earl , whose words your Lordship has quoted , refused to touch the hand of Marmion , Douglas could scarcely have called Marmion back in order to give him - a message ! "
338779	338841	338881	338881	Frank	449	" I submit to your rebuke , Mr. Leslie , though I meant not the offence you would ascribe to me . I regret my unlucky quotation yet the more , since the wit of your retort has obliged you to identify yourself with Marmion , who , though a clever and brave fellow , was an uncommonly - tricky one . "
338871	338879	338881	338881	Frank	449	" What was L'Estrange saying to you ? "
338883	338892	338769	338769	he	570	" Something about Beatrice , I am sure . "
338893	338900	338881	338881	Frank	449	" No ; only quoting poetry . "
338901	338995	339016	339016	Randal	570	" Then what made you look so angry , my dear fellow ? I know it was your kind feeling for me . As you say , he is a formidable rival . But that ca n't be his own hair . Do you think he wears a toupet ? I am sure he was praising Beatrice . He is evidently very much smitten with her . But I do n't think she is a woman to be caught by mere rank and fortune ! Do you ? Why ca n't you speak ? "
338996	339014	339186	339187	the countess	8099	" If you do not get her consent soon , I think she is lost to you , "
339189	339195	339587	339588	Lady Lansmere	822	" can get on with , "
339604	339636	339647	339647	her	800	" But you are just the person Harley admires , - just the person to rouse him from melancholy dreams , of which his wild humours are now but the vain disguise "
339659	339666	339852	339852	she	8099	" He melancholy - and why ? "
339865	339971	339986	339986	herself	894	" I beg your pardon , Miss Digby , for my intrusion ; but my son has left it to me to prepare Lord Lansmere to learn the offer you have done Harley the honour to accept . I have not yet spoken to my Lord ; it may be days before I find a fitting occasion to do so ; meanwhile I feel assured that your sense of propriety will make you agree , with me that it is due to Lord L'Estrange 's father , that strangers should not learn arrangements of such moment in his family before his own consent be obtained . "
340003	340013	340024	340025	Lady Lansmere	822	" Certainly , madam , I never dreamed of - "
340014	340022	340024	340025	Lady Lansmere	822	" That is right , my dear , "
340036	340093	340108	340108	Helen	894	" I could not doubt your superiority to ordinary girls of your age , with whom these matters are never secret for a moment . Therefore , of course , you will not mention , at present , what has passed between you and Harley , to any of the friends with whom you may correspond . "
340094	340106	340024	340025	Lady Lansmere	822	" I have no correspondents , no friends , Lady Lansmere , "
340119	340218	340550	340550	his	503	" I am very glad to hear it , my dear ; young ladies never should have . Friends , especially friends who correspond , are the worst enemies they can have . Good - night , Miss Digby . I need not add , by the way , that though we are bound to show all kindness to this young Italian lady , still she is wholly unconnected with our family ; and you will be as prudent with her as you would have been with your correspondents , had you had the misfortune to have any . "
340543	340547	340792	340792	she	822	" Miss Digby , "
340787	340790	340792	340792	she	822	" Harley , "
340798	340868	340950	340951	Lady Lansmere	822	" what a charming companion you have introduced to us ! I never met with any that both pleased and delighted me like this dear Violante . Most girls who possess some power of conversation , and who have dared to think for themselves , are so pedantic , or so masculine ; but she is always so simple , and always still the girl . Ah , Harley ! "
340869	340878	340792	340792	she	822	" Why that sigh , my dear mother ? "
340879	340919	340928	340928	he	503	" I was thinking how exactly she would have suited you , - how proud I should have been of such a daughter - in - law , and how happy you would have been with such a wife . "
340923	340926	340928	340928	he	503	" Tut , "
340944	340944	340950	340951	Lady Lansmere	822	"
340945	340948	340950	340951	Lady Lansmere	822	" Why , "
340955	340964	340928	340928	he	503	" Helen is quite as young as Violante . "
340965	341076	341152	341153	Lady Lansmere	822	" In dates - yes . But Helen 's character is so staid ; what it is now it will be ever ; and Helen , from gratitude , respect , or pity , condescends to accept the ruins of my heart , while this bright Italian has the soul of a Juliet , and would expect in a husband all the passion of a Romeo . Nay , Mother , hush . Do you forget that I am engaged , - and of my own free will and choice ? Poor dear Helen ! A propos , have you spoken to my father , as you undertook to do ? "
341077	341096	340928	340928	he	503	" Not yet . I must seize the right moment . You know that my Lord requires management . "
341097	341151	341152	341153	Lady Lansmere	822	" My dear mother , that female notion of managing us men costs you ladies a great waste of time , and occasions us a great deal of sorrow . Men are easily managed by plain truth . We are brought up to respect it , strange as it may seem to you ! "
341170	341186	341262	341262	he	503	" Leave it to me , Harley , and rely on my Lord 's consent . "
341265	341289	341262	341262	he	503	" I resign myself to your promise and your diplomacy . Meanwhile , as you love me , be kind to my betrothed . "
341290	341296	341262	341262	he	503	" Am I not so ? "
341297	341317	341324	341325	Lady Lansmere	822	" Hem . Are you as kind as if she were the great heiress you believe Violante to be ? "
341318	341322	341324	341325	Lady Lansmere	822	" Is it , "
341331	341371	341440	341440	he	503	" is it because one is an heiress and the other is not that you make so marked a difference in your own manner to the two ; treating Violante as a spoilt child , and Miss Digby as - "
341372	341394	341440	341440	he	503	" The destined wife of Lord L'Estrange , and the daughter - in - law of Lady Lansmere , - yes . "
341444	341522	341440	341440	he	503	" I am going to leave you to - day . I have engaged apartments at the Clarendon . I intend to gratify your wish , so often expressed , that I should enjoy what are called the pleasures of my rank , and the privileges of single - blessedness , - celebrate my adieu to celibacy , and blaze once more , with the splendour of a setting sun , upon Hyde Park and May Fair . "
341523	341552	341572	341572	Harley	503	" You are a positive enigma . Leave our house , just when you are betrothed to its inmate ! Is that the natural conduct of a lover ? "
341553	341570	341572	341572	Harley	503	" How can your woman eyes be so dull , and your woman heart so obtuse ? "
341580	341718	341751	341752	Lady Lansmere	822	" Can you not guess that I wish that Helen and myself should both lose the association of mere ward and guardian ; that the very familiarity of our intercourse under the same roof almost forbids us to be lovers ; that we lose the joy to meet , and the pang to part . Do n't you remember the story of the Frenchman , who for twenty years loved a lady , and never missed passing his evenings at her house . She became a widow . ' I wish you joy , ' cried his friend ; ' you may now marry the woman you have so long adored . ' ' Alas ! ' said the poor Frenchman , profoundly dejected ; ' and if so , where shall I spend my evenings ? ' "
341735	341749	341751	341752	Lady Lansmere	822	" I do n't perceive the point of your witty , heartless anecdote , "
341756	341790	341791	341792	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Settle that , however , with Miss Digby . But to leave the very day after your friend 's daughter comes as a guest ! - what will she think of it ? "
341799	341824	341862	341862	she	1556	" Does it matter much what she thinks of me , - of a man engaged to another ; and old enough to be - "
341825	341859	341879	341879	her	1556	" I wish to heaven you would not talk of your age , Harley ; it is a reflection upon mine ; and I never saw you look so well nor so handsome . "
341883	341903	341938	341938	he	502	" If she knew that Lord L'Estrange had engaged rooms at the Clarendon ; and if she understood why ? "
341921	341936	341992	341992	VIOLANTE	800	" You will be very dull here , I fear , my poor child , "
341940	341961	341992	341992	VIOLANTE	800	" Dull ! But why will you call me child ? Am I so very - very child - like ? "
341962	341991	341992	341992	VIOLANTE	800	" Certainly , you are to me , - a mere infant . Have I not seen you one ; have I not held you in my arms ? "
341995	342004	342005	342005	HARLEY	503	" But that was a long time ago ! "
342008	342061	342062	342062	VIOLANTE	800	" True . But if years have not stood still for you , they have not been stationary for me . There is the same difference between us now that there was then . And , therefore , permit me still to call you child , and as child to treat you ! "
342065	342089	342090	342090	HARLEY	503	" I will do no such thing . Do you know that I always thought I was good - tempered till this morning . "
342093	342105	342112	342112	her	800	" And what undeceived you ? Did you break your doll ? "
342117	342130	342131	342131	HARLEY	503	" There ! - again ! - you delight in provoking me ! "
342134	342152	342181	342181	He	503	" It was the doll , then . Do n't cry ; I will get you another . "
342196	342248	342164	342165	the countess	8099	" I am trespassing sadly on your morning ; but I wait for a visitor whom I sent to before you were up . He is to be here at twelve . With your permission , I will dine with you tomorrow , and you will invite him to meet me . "
342249	342265	342272	342272	Violante	800	" Certainly . And who is your friend ? I guess - the young author ? "
342266	342270	342294	342295	Lady Lansmere	822	" Leonard Fairfield , "
342289	342292	342294	342295	Lady Lansmere	822	" Fairfield ! "
342297	342310	342349	342349	Harley	503	" I thought , Harley , you said the name was Oran . "
342311	342347	342363	342364	the countess	8099	" He has assumed the latter name . He is the son of Mark Fairfield , who married an Avenel . Did you recognize no family likeness ? - none in those eyes , Mother ? "
342358	342361	342368	342368	Harley	503	" No ; "
342396	342451	342460	342461	the countess	8099	" And his mother - Nora 's sister - shrank from seeing me ! That is the reason why I wished you not to call . She has not told the young man why she shrank from seeing me ; nor have I explained it to him as yet . Perhaps I never shall . "
342452	342458	342460	342461	the countess	8099	" Indeed , dearest Harley , "
342467	342523	342615	342615	she	8099	" I wish you too much to forget the folly - well , I will not say that word - the sorrows of your boyhood , not to hope that you will rather strive against such painful memories than renew them by unnecessary confidence to any one ; least of all to the relation of - "
342524	342582	342791	342792	the countess	8099	" Enough ! do n't name her ; the very name pains me . And as to confidence , there are but two persons in the world to whom I ever bare the old wounds , - yourself and Egerton . Let this pass . Ha ! - a ring at the bell - that is he ! "
342811	342899	342906	342906	Harley	503	" steals its way into the heart , so her interest in him was aroused by a certain subdued melancholy which is rarely without distinction , and never without charm . He and Helen exchanged but few words . There was but one occasion in which they could have spoken apart , and Helen herself contrived to elude it . His face brightened at Lady Lansmere 's cordial invitation , and he glanced at Helen as he accepted it ; but her eye did not meet his own .
342900	342904	342910	342910	Nero	890	" And now , "
342919	342952	342995	342995	Harley	503	" I must take Leonard away . Adieu ! all of you , till to - morrow at dinner . Miss Violante , is the doll to have blue eyes or black ? "
342984	342993	342995	342995	Harley	503	" Let the carriage go to the Clarendon , "
343000	343032	343051	343051	Violante	800	" I and Mr. Oran will walk to town . Leonard , I think you would rejoice at an occasion to serve your old friends , Dr. Riccabocca and his daughter ? "
343033	343041	343074	343079	the little dark - eyed girl	10239	" Serve them ! Oh , yes . "
343088	343096	343117	343117	Harley	503	" But to SERVE those you love ! "
343108	343115	343117	343117	Harley	503	" I said to our friend , "
343119	343160	343249	343249	Leonard	450	" that I would vouch for your honour as my own . I am about to prove my words , and to confide the secrets which your penetration has indeed divined , - our friend is not what he seems . "
343242	343247	343249	343249	Leonard	450	" A noble ambition ! "
343253	343279	343290	343290	Harley	503	" And pardon me , my Lord , I should not have thought that you would speak of it in a tone that implies blame . "
343280	343288	343603	343603	L'Estrange	503	" The ambition in itself was noble , "
343292	343601	343603	343603	L'Estrange	503	" but the cause to which it was devoted became defiled in its dark channel through Secret Societies . It is the misfortune of all miscellaneous political combinations , that with the purest motives of their more generous members are ever mixed the most sordid interests , and the fiercest passions of mean confederates . When those combinations act openly , and in daylight , under the eye of Public Opinion , the healthier elements usually prevail ; where they are shrouded in mystery , where they are subjected to no censor in the discussion of the impartial and dispassionate , where chiefs working in the dark exact blind obedience , and every man who is at war with law is at once admitted as a friend of freedom , the history of the world tells us that patriotism soon passes away . Where all is in public , public virtue , by the natural sympathies of the common mind , and by the wholesome control of shame , is likely to obtain ascendancy ; where all is in private , and shame is but for him who refuses the abnegation of his conscience , each man seeks the indulgence of his private vice . And hence in Secret Societies from which may yet proceed great danger to all Europe we find but foul and hateful Eleusinia , affording pretexts to the ambition of the great , to the license of the penniless , to the passions of the revengeful , to the anarchy of the ignorant . In a word , the societies of these Italian Carbonari did but engender schemes in which the abler chiefs disguised new forms of despotism , and in which the revolutionary many looked forward to the overthrow of all the institutions that stand between Law and Chaos . Naturally , therefore , "
343607	343649	343807	343807	Leonard	450	" when their schemes were detected , and the conspiracy foiled , it was for the silly , honest men entrapped into the league to suffer , the leaders turned king 's evidence , and the common mercenaries became - banditti . "
343788	343805	343807	343807	Leonard	450	" But these men can know nothing of England , of the safety of English laws , "
343811	343891	343901	343901	Harley	503	" We take it for granted that Riccabocca , if I am still so to call him , refuses his consent to the marriage between his daughter and his foe . Where , then , the danger ? This count , even if Violante were not under your mother 's roof , could not get an opportunity to see her . He could not attack the house and carry her off like a feudal baron in the middle ages . "
343892	343899	343901	343901	Harley	503	" All this is very true , "
343903	344464	344591	344591	Harley	503	" Yet I have found through life that we can not estimate danger by external circumstances , but by the character of those from whom it is threatened . This count is a man of singular audacity , of no mean natural talents , - talents practised in every art of duplicity and intrigue ; one of those men whose boast it is that they succeed in whatever they undertake ; and he is , here , urged on the one hand by all that can whet the avarice , and on the other , by all that can give invention to despair . Therefore , though I can not guess what plan he may possibly adopt , I never doubt that some plan , formed with cunning and pursued with daring , will be embraced the moment he discovers Violante 's retreat , - unless , indeed , we can forestall all peril by the restoration of her father , and the detection of the fraud and falsehood to which Peschiera owes the fortune he appropriates . Thus , while we must prosecute to the utmost our inquiries for the missing documents , so it should be our care to possess ourselves , if possible , of such knowledge of the count 's machinations as may enable us to defeat them . Now , it was with satisfaction that I learned in Germany that Peschiera 's sister was in London . I knew enough both of his disposition and of the intimacy between himself and this lady , to make me think it probable he will seek to make her his instrument and accomplice , should he require one . Peschiera as you may suppose by his audacious wager is not one of those secret villains who would cut off their right hand if it could betray the knowledge of what was done by the left , - rather one of those self - confident vaunting knaves of high animal spirits , and conscience so obtuse that it clouds their intellect , who must have some one to whom they can boast of their abilities and confide their projects . And Peschiera has done all he can to render this poor woman so wholly dependent on him as to be his slave and his tool . But I have learned certain traits in her character that show it to be impressionable to good , and with tendencies to honour . Peschiera had taken advantage of the admiration she excited , some years ago , in a rich young Englishman , to entice this admirer into gambling , and sought to make his sister both a decoy and an instrument in his designs of plunder . She did not encourage the addresses of our countryman , but she warned him of the snare laid for him , and entreated him to leave the place lest her brother should discover and punish her honesty . The Englishman told me this himself . In fine , my hope of detaching this lady from Peschiera 's interests , and inducing her to forewarn us of his purpose , consists but in the innocent , and , I hope , laudable artifice , of redeeming herself , - of appealing to , and calling into disused exercise , the better springs of her nature . "
344594	344698	344709	344709	Leonard	450	" After a conversation I had with the lady last night , it occurred to me that in this part of our diplomacy you could render us essential service . Madame di Negra - such is the sister 's name - has conceived an admiration for your genius , and a strong desire to know you personally . I have promised to present you to her ; and I shall do so after a preliminary caution . The lady is very handsome , and very fascinating . It is possible that your heart and your senses may not be proof against her attractions . "
344699	344707	344591	344591	Harley	503	" Oh , do not fear that ! "
344722	344826	344866	344866	I	0	" Forewarned is not always forearmed against the might of beauty , my dear Leonard ; so I can not at once accept your assurance . But listen to me ! Watch yourself narrowly , and if you find that you are likely to be captivated , promise , on your honour , to retreat at once from the field . I have no right , for the sake of another , to expose you to danger ; and Madame di Negra , whatever may be her good qualities , is the last person I should wish to see you in love with . "
344827	344835	344845	344845	Harley	503	" In love with her ! Impossible ! "
344836	344843	344914	344914	I	0	" Impossible is a strong word , "
344923	344923	344931	344931	Leonard	450	"
344924	344929	344931	344931	Leonard	450	" I give it , "
344935	344947	344953	344953	Harley	503	" But how can I serve Riccabocca ? How aid in - "
344948	344951	344953	344953	Harley	503	" Thus , "
344955	345233	344931	344931	Leonard	450	" the spell of your writings is , that , unconsciously to ourselves , they make us better and nobler . And your writings are but the impressions struck off from your mind . Your conversation , when you are roused , has the same effect . And as you grow more familiar with Madame di Negra , I wish you to speak of your boyhood , your youth . Describe the exile as you have seen him , - so touching amidst his foibles , so grand amidst the petty privations of his fallen fortunes , so benevolent while poring over his hateful Machiavelli , so stingless in his wisdom of the serpent , so playfully astute in his innocence of the dove - I leave the picture to your knowledge of humour and pathos . Describe Violante brooding over her Italian Poets , and filled with dreams of her fatherland ; describe her with all the flashes of her princely nature , shining forth through humble circumstance and obscure position ; waken in your listener compassion , respect , admiration for her kindred exiles , - and I think our work is done . She will recognize evidently those whom her brother seeks . She will question you closely where you met with them , where they now are . Protect that secret ; say at once that it is not your own . Against your descriptions and the feelings they excite , she will not be guarded as against mine . And there are other reasons why your influence over this woman of mixed nature may be more direct and effectual than my own . "
345234	345243	345256	345256	Harley	503	" Nay , I can not conceive that . "
345244	345254	345259	345259	he	503	" Believe it , without asking me to explain , "
345270	345348	345355	345355	Harley	503	" I am high - born and wealthy , you a peasant 's son , and living by your exertions . This woman is ambitious and distressed . She might have projects on me that would counteract mine on her . You she would but listen to , and receive , through the sentiments of good or of poetical that are in her ; you she would have no interest to subjugate , no motive to ensnare . "
345349	345353	345355	345355	Harley	503	" And now , "
345361	345440	345259	345259	he	503	" I have another object in view . This foolish sage friend of ours , in his bewilderment and fears , has sought to save Violante from one rogue by promising her hand to a man who , unless my instincts deceive me , I suspect much disposed to be another . Sacrifice such exuberance of life and spirit to that bloodless heart , to that cold and earthward intellect ! By Heaven , it shall not be ! "
345441	345472	345478	345478	Harley	503	" But whom can the exile possibly have seen of birth and fortunes to render him a fitting spouse for his daughter ? Whom , my Lord , except yourself ? "
345473	345476	345478	345478	Harley	503	" Me ! "
345486	345533	345259	345259	he	503	" I worthy of such a creature ? - I , with my habits ! I , silken egotist that I am ! And you , a poet , to form such an estimate of one who might be the queen of a poet 's dream ! "
345534	345717	345728	345728	Harley	503	" My Lord , when we sat the other night round Riccabocca 's hearth , when I heard her speak , and observed you listen , I said to myself , from such knowledge of human nature as comes , we know not how , to us poets , - I said , ' Harley L'Estrange has looked long and wistfully on the heavens , and he now hears the murmur of the wings that can waft him towards them . ' And then I sighed , for I thought how the world rules us all in spite of ourselves , and I said , ' What pity for both , that the exile 's daughter is not the worldly equal of the peer 's son ! ' And you too sighed , as I thus thought ; and I fancied that , while you listened to the music of the wing , you felt the iron of the chain . But the exile 's daughter is your equal in birth , and you are her equal in heart and in soul . "
345718	345726	345728	345728	Harley	503	" My poor Leonard , you rave , "
345732	345754	345765	345765	Leonard	450	" And if Violante is not to be some young prince 's bride , she should be some young poet 's . "
345755	345763	345765	345765	Leonard	450	" Poet 's ! Oh , no ! "
345772	345780	345801	345801	he	503	" Poets need repose where they love ! "
345795	345799	345801	345801	he	503	" I comprehend , "
345803	345934	345940	345940	Leonard	450	" it is a new light that dawns on me . What is needed by the man whose whole life is one strain after glory - whose soul sinks , in fatigue , to the companionship of earth - is not the love of a nature like his own . He is right , - it is repose ! While I ! - it is true ; boy that he is , his intuitions are wiser than all my experience ! It is excitement , energy , elevation , that Love should bestow on me . But I have chosen ; and , at least , with Helen my life will be calm , and my hearth sacred . Let the rest sleep in the same grave as my youth . "
345935	345938	345959	345959	he	450	" But , "
345968	345988	346054	346054	Harley	503	" but you have not yet told me the name of the signorina 's suitor . May I know ? "
345989	346013	346023	346023	Leonard	450	" Probably one you never heard of . Randal Leslie , - a placeman . You refused a place ; you were right . "
346014	346021	346054	346054	Harley	503	" Randal Leslie ? Heaven forbid ! "
346032	346042	346054	346054	Harley	503	" Amen ! But what do you know of him ?
346043	346053	346054	346054	Harley	503	" Leonard related the story of Burley 's pamphlet . "
346065	346109	346318	346319	Lord L'Estrange	502	" The paltry pretender ; - and yet I fancied that he might be formidable ! However , we must dismiss him for the present , - we are approaching Madame di Negra 's house . Prepare yourself , and remember your promise . "
346327	346333	346412	346412	Egerton	500	" on his native heath , "
346417	346642	346658	346660	the generous friend	10268	" My dear Harley , do n't try to set me against this young man . I wish to hear nothing in his disfavour . In the first place , it would not alter the line of conduct I mean to adopt with regard to him . He is my wife 's kinsman ; I charged myself with his career , as a wish of hers , and therefore as a duty to myself . In attaching him so young to my own fate , I drew him necessarily away from the professions in which his industry and talents for he has both in no common degree would have secured his fortunes ; therefore , be he bad , be he good , I shall try to provide for him as I best can ; and , moreover , cold as I am to him , and worldly though perhaps he be , I have somehow or other conceived an interest in him , a liking to him . He has been under my roof , he is dependent on me ; he has been docile and prudent , and I am a lone childless man ; therefore , spare him , since in so doing you spare me ; and ah , Harley , I have so many cares on me now that - "
346643	346656	346658	346660	the generous friend	10268	" Oh , say no more , my dear , dear Audley , "
346662	346669	346805	346806	the baron	17518	" how little people know you ! "
346814	346916	347003	347003	He	1815	" True , the tradesmen are always paid ; but the how is the question ! Randal , mon cher , you are too innocent . I have but two pieces of advice to suggest , in the shape of two proverbs , - ' Wise rats run from a falling house , ' and , ' Make hay while the sun shines . ' A propos , Mr. Avenel likes you greatly , and has been talking of the borough of Lansmere for you . He has contrived to get together a great interest there . Make much of him . "
347009	347012	347003	347003	He	1815	" and said "
347021	347070	347003	347003	He	1815	" which was the highest praise Dick Avenel ever accorded to any man . But Dick himself looked a little careworn ; and this was the first year in which he had murmured at the bills of his wife 's dressmaker , and said with an oath , that "
347082	347082	347338	347341	the pupil of Machiavelli	8979	"
347343	347348	347765	347765	he	1175	" throw him over , "
347780	347797	347805	347806	Baron Levy	1175	" This is a man who must make way in life ; he is worth helping . "
347801	347804	347805	347806	Baron Levy	1175	" worth helping "
347808	347821	348225	348225	he	570	" worth getting into my power , that he may help me . "
348243	348246	348620	348621	Mr. Egerton	500	" knowledge , "
348624	348634	348620	348621	Mr. Egerton	500	" the enlightened member of a great commercial constituency , "
348641	348677	348775	348776	the statesman	3214	" that Right Honourable gentleman , member for that great city , identified with the cause of the Burgher class , could be so far behind the spirit of the age as his official chief , "
348763	348765	348775	348776	the statesman	3214	" hears "
348770	348773	348775	348776	the statesman	3214	" Leslie , "
348780	348811	348775	348776	the statesman	3214	" I owe all my success in parliament to this rule , - I have never spoken against my convictions . I intend to abide by it to the last . "
348812	348830	348775	348776	the statesman	3214	" But if the question at issue comes before the House , you will vote against it ? "
348831	348868	348879	348879	Randal	570	" Certainly , I vote as a member of the Cabinet . But since I am not leader and mouthpiece of the party , I retain as an individual the privilege to speak or keep silence . "
348869	348877	348879	348879	Randal	570	" Ah , my dear Mr. Egerton , "
348881	348946	348955	348955	Egerton	500	" forgive me . But this question , right or wrong , has got such hold of the public mind . So little , if conceded in time , would give content ; and it is so clear if I may judge by the talk I hear everywhere I go that by refusing all concession , the Government must fall , that I wish - "
348947	348953	349015	349019	the discreet and reserved minister	10341	" So do I wish , "
349009	349009	349104	349104	Randal	570	"
349108	349133	349104	349104	Randal	570	" May I say what I have heard expressed with regard to you and your position - in the streets , in the clubs ? "
349134	349155	349104	349104	Randal	570	" Yes , it is in the streets and the clubs that statesmen should go to school . Say on . "
349156	349209	349104	349104	Randal	570	" Well , then , I have heard it made a matter of wonder why you , and one or two others I will not name , do not at once retire from the ministry , and on the avowed ground that you side with the public feeling on this irresistible question . "
349210	349213	349104	349104	Randal	570	" Eh ! "
349214	349294	349300	349300	Audley	500	" It is clear that in so doing you would become the most popular man in the country , - clear that you would be summoned back to power on the shoulders of the people . No new Cabinet could be formed without you , and your station in it would perhaps be higher , for life , than that which you may now retain but for a few weeks longer . Has not this ever occurred to you ? "
349295	349298	349311	349311	Randal	570	" Never , "
349314	349337	349104	349104	Randal	570	" Is it possible ! And yet , forgive me if I say I think you are ambitious , and love power . "
349338	349372	349311	349311	Randal	570	" No man more ambitious ; and if by power you mean office , it has grown the habit of my life , and I shall not know what to do without it . "
349373	349391	349104	349104	Randal	570	" And how , then , has what seems to me so obvious never occurred to you ? "
349392	349431	349311	349311	Randal	570	" Because you are young , and therefore I forgive you ; but not the gossips who could wonder why Audley Egerton refused to betray the friends of his whole career , and to profit by the treason . "
349432	349444	349104	349104	Randal	570	" But one should love one 's country before a party . "
349445	349466	349311	349311	Randal	570	" No doubt of that ; and the first interest of a country is the honour of its public men . "
349467	349477	349104	349104	Randal	570	" But men may leave their party without dishonour ! "
349478	349632	349645	349645	Randal	570	" Who doubts that ? Do you suppose that if I were an ordinary independent member of parliament , loaded with no obligations , charged with no trust , I could hesitate for a moment what course to pursue ? Oh , that I were but the member for - - - - - ! Oh , that I had the full right to be a free agent ! But if a member of a Cabinet , a chief in whom thousands confide , because he is outvoted in a council of his colleagues , suddenly retires , and by so doing breaks up the whole party whose confidence he has enjoyed , whose rewards he has reaped , to whom he owes the very position which he employs to their ruin , - own that though his choice may be honest , it is one which requires all the consolations of conscience . "
349633	349643	349645	349645	Randal	570	" But you will have those consolations . And , "
349649	349660	349673	349673	Egerton	500	" the gain to your career will be so immense ! "
349661	349671	349673	349673	Egerton	500	" That is precisely what it can not be , "
349677	349751	349905	349905	He	500	" I grant that I may , if I choose , resign office with the present Government , and so at once destroy that Government ; for my resignation on such ground would suffice to do it . I grant this ; but for that very reason I could not the next day take office with another administration . I could not accept wages for desertion . No gentleman could ! and therefore - "
349892	349904	350061	350062	the Speaker	5845	" Ce n'est pas moi qui parle , c'est Marc Aurele . "
350068	350073	350264	350268	a Lord of the Bedchamber	10370	" Strangers must withdraw ! "
350222	350234	350264	350268	a Lord of the Bedchamber	10370	" They say the Government will have a majority of ten . "
350235	350246	350264	350268	a Lord of the Bedchamber	10370	" No ; I hear they will certainly be beaten . "
350247	350254	350264	350268	a Lord of the Bedchamber	10370	" H - says by fifty . "
350255	350262	350264	350268	a Lord of the Bedchamber	10370	" I do n't believe it , "
350270	350285	350264	350268	a Lord of the Bedchamber	10370	" it is impossible . I left five Government members dining at The Travellers . "
350286	350297	350264	350268	a Lord of the Bedchamber	10370	" No one thought the division would be so early . "
350298	350307	350264	350268	a Lord of the Bedchamber	10370	" A trick of the Whigs - shameful ! "
350308	350348	350398	350401	a candid young placeman	10371	" Wonder some one was not set up to talk for time ; very odd P - did not speak ; however , he is so cursedly rich , he does not care whether he is out or in . "
350349	350396	350430	350431	the baron	17518	" Yes ; and Audley Egerton too , just such another : glad , no doubt , to be set free to look after his property ; very different tactics if we had men to whom office was as necessary as it is - to me ! "
350421	350428	350398	350401	a candid young placeman	10371	" Did I not tell you ? "
350438	350452	350419	350419	Levy	1175	" You are sure , then , that the Government will be outvoted ? "
350453	350493	350508	350511	the candid young placeman	10373	" I spent the morning in going over the list of members with a parliamentary client of mine , who knows them all as a shepherd does his sheep . Majority for the Opposition at least twenty - five . "
350494	350506	350508	350511	the candid young placeman	10373	" And in that case must the Government resign , sir ? "
350526	350534	350543	350544	the baron	17518	" his soul planted in his ears . "
350535	350541	350594	350594	Randal	570	" Of course , sir , "
350570	350593	350508	350511	the candid young placeman	10373	" You are a friend to the present ministers ? You could not wish them to be mean enough to stay in ? "
350600	350615	350629	350630	the baron	17518	" If Audley 's affairs are as you state , what can he do ? "
350616	350627	350629	350630	the baron	17518	" I shall ask him that question to - morrow , "
350639	350656	350508	350511	the candid young placeman	10373	" and I have come here just to see how he bears the prospect before him . "
350657	350692	350710	350711	the baron	17518	" You will not discover that in his face . And those absurd scruples of his ! If he had but gone out in time - to come in again with the New Men ! "
350693	350708	350722	350724	the breathless expectants	10379	" Oh , of course , our Right Honourable is too punctilious for that ! "
350726	350737	350745	350748	a member of Opposition	10380	" What are the numbers ? What is the division ? "
350738	350743	350745	350748	a member of Opposition	10380	" Majority against ministers , "
350754	350759	350818	350866	the baron of a young county member , who was talking to some non - parliamentary friend in the bench before Levy . The county member was one of the baron 's pet eldest sons , had dined often with Levy , was under " obligations " to him	10387	" twenty - nine . "
350804	350816	350841	350843	The county member	10389	" What ! has nothing been said as to the division ? "
350862	350864	350868	350870	The young legislator	10392	" obligations "
350888	350928	350982	350983	the baron	17518	" Oh , yes ; H - - - asked if , after such an expression of the House , it was the intention of ministers to retain their places , and carry on the business of the Government . "
350929	350950	350956	350958	the county member	10389	" Just like H - - - - ! Very inquisitive mind ! And what was the answer he got ? "
350951	350954	350982	350983	the baron	17518	" None , "
350975	350980	351212	351212	his	10405	" There comes Egerton , "
351140	351185	351192	351193	the baron	17518	" I shall not be a proud man if ever I live to have office ; but I shall be proud if ever I leave it with as little to be said against me as your bitterest opponents can say against you , Egerton . "
351186	351190	351223	351226	formal , indignant members	10412	" I wonder , "
351228	351243	351543	351543	himself	570	" Order in the strangers ' gallery I wonder what Lord L'Estrange will say ? "
351549	351556	351916	351916	Egerton	500	" Their country before their party ! "
351922	351935	351887	351889	the other two	10447	" Come in , Leslie ; I was just speaking about yourself . "
351936	351942	351916	351916	Egerton	500	" About me , sir ? "
351943	352002	352019	352019	Randal	570	" Yes ; about you and the place you hold . I had asked Sir - - pointing to a fellow minister whether I might not , with propriety , request your chief to leave some note of his opinion of your talents , which I know is high , and which might serve you with his successor . "
352003	352017	352032	352032	Audley	500	" Oh , sir , at such a time to think of me ! "
352027	352030	352035	352035	his	500	" But , "
352039	352082	352089	352089	Sir	14889	" Sir - - , to my surprise , thinks that it would better become you that you should resign . Unless his reasons , which he has not yet stated , are very strong , such would not be my advice . "
352083	352087	352089	352089	Sir	14889	" My reasons , "
352097	352157	352176	352176	Egerton	500	" are simply these : I have a nephew in a similar situation ; he will resign , as a matter of course . Every one in the public offices whose relations and near connections hold high appointments in the Government will do so . I do not think Mr. Leslie will like to feel himself a solitary exception . "
352158	352174	352089	352089	Sir	14889	" Mr. Leslie is no relation of mine , - not even a near connection , "
352178	352247	352353	352353	Egerton	500	" But his name is so associated with your own : he has resided so long in your house , is so well known in society and do n't think I compliment when I add , that we hope so well of him , that I ca n't think it worth his while to keep this paltry place , which incapacitates him too from a seat in parliament . "
352345	352351	352353	352353	Egerton	500	" You see , Leslie , "
352361	352396	352523	352523	he	10456	" that nothing can be said against your honour if you stay where you are ; it is a mere question of expediency ; I will judge that for you ; keep your place . "
352533	352610	352712	352712	He	503	" No ; the writer of this most able publication is no ordinary placeman . His opinions here are too vigorously stated ; this fine irony on the very person who in all probability will be the chief in his office has excited too lively an attention to allow him the sedet eternumque sedebit on an official stool . Ha , ha ! this is so good ! Read it , L'Estrange . What say you ? "
352720	352756	352766	352766	Sir	14889	" I am no politician ; but Egerton is so well known to be fastidious and over - scrupulous in all points of official etiquette , that Mr. Leslie can not follow a safer counsellor . "
352757	352764	352822	352822	he	500	" Read that yourself , Egerton , "
352839	352909	352910	352910	Egerton	500	" Mr. Leslie , I retract my advice . I believe Sir - - is right , - that the nobleman here so keenly satirized will be the chief in your office . I doubt whether he will not compel your dismissal ; at all events , he could scarcely be expected to promote your advancement . Under the circumstances , I fear you have no option as a - "
352930	352935	352975	352975	his	500	" as a gentleman . "
352954	352956	352975	352975	his	500	" gentleman "
352981	352988	353000	353000	Egerton	500	" You utter my own sentiment . "
352989	352998	353016	353016	Harley	503	" You think we are right , Harley ? "
353010	353014	353016	353016	Harley	503	" I think , "
353044	353093	353105	353105	Randal	570	" I think whoever has served Audley Egerton never yet has been a loser by it ; and if Mr. Leslie wrote this pamphlet , he must have well served Audley Egerton . If he undergoes the penalty , we may safely trust to Egerton for the compensation . "
353094	353103	353105	353105	Randal	570	" My compensation has long since been made , "
353110	353136	353146	353146	Egerton	500	" and that Mr. Egerton could thus have cared for my fortunes , at an hour so occupied , is a thought of pride which - "
353137	353144	353146	353146	Egerton	500	" Enough , Leslie ! enough ! "
353156	353165	353417	353417	he	500	" See me before you go to bed . "
353424	353584	353417	353417	he	500	" I know not , Randal Leslie , whether you thought me needlessly cautious , or wantonly unkind , when I told you never to expect from me more than such advance to your career as my then position could effect , - never to expect from my liberality in life , nor from my testament in death , an addition to your private fortunes . I see by your gesture what would be your reply , and I thank you for it . I now tell you , as yet in confidence , though before long it can be no secret to the world , that my pecuniary affairs have been so neglected by me in my devotion to those of the State , that I am somewhat like the man who portioned out his capital at so much a day , calculating to live just long enough to make it last . Unfortunately he lived too long . "
353610	353727	353851	353851	he	10476	" The prospects that face me I am prepared for ; they do not take me by surprise . I knew long since how this would end , if I survived the loss of office . I knew it before you came to me , and therefore I spoke to you as I did , judging it manful and right to guard you against hopes which you might otherwise have naturally entertained . On this head , I need say no more . It may excite your surprise , possibly your blame , that I , esteemed methodical and practical enough in the affairs of the State , should be so imprudent as to my own . "
353728	353740	353848	353848	Mechanically	1276	" Oh , sir ! you owe no account to me . "
353741	353847	353884	353884	he	10476	" To you , at least , as much as to any one . I am a solitary man ; my few relations need nothing from me . I had a right do spend what I possessed as I pleased ; and if I have spent it recklessly as regards myself , I have not spent it ill in its effect on others . It has been my object for many years to have no Private Life , - to dispense with its sorrows , joys , affections ; and as to its duties , they did not exist for me . I have said . "
353879	353883	353884	353884	he	10476	" But now , "
353887	353943	353955	353955	Randal	570	" I have failed to advance your career . True , I warned you that you drew into a lottery ; but you had more chance of a prize than a blank . A blank , however , it has turned out , and the question becomes grave , - What are you to do ? "
353959	353970	353977	353977	Audley	500	" Still , sir , to go by your advice . "
353971	353975	353977	353977	Audley	500	" My advice , "
353984	354120	354137	354137	Randal	570	" would perhaps be rude and unpalatable . I would rather place before you an option . On the one hand , recommence life again . I told you that I would keep your name on your college books . You can return , you can take your degree , after that , you can go to the Bar , - you have just the talents calculated to succeed in that profession . Success will be slow , it is true ; but , with perseverance , it will be sure . And , believe me , Leslie , Ambition is only sweet while it is but the loftier name for Hope . Who would care for a fox 's brush if it had not been rendered a prize by the excitement of the chase ? "
354121	354135	354137	354137	Randal	570	" Oxford - again ! It is a long step back in life , "
354151	354187	353977	353977	Audley	500	" A long step back - and to what ? To a profession in which one never begins to rise till one 's hair is gray . Besides , how live in the mean while ? "
354188	354225	354257	354257	himself	570	" Do not let that thought disturb you . The modest income that suffices for a student at the Bar , I trust , at least , to insure you from the wrecks of my fortune . "
354226	354252	354300	354300	he	500	" Ah , sir , I would not burden you further . What right have I to such kindness , save my name of Leslie ? "
354296	354299	354300	354300	he	500	" Certainly , "
354304	354345	354364	354364	Randal	570	" as a Leslie you are entitled to my consideration , and would have been entitled perhaps to more , had I not so explicitly warned you to the contrary . But the Bar does not seem to please you ? "
354346	354362	354505	354505	Egerton	500	" What is the alternative , sir ? Let me decide when I hear it , "
354509	354530	354541	354541	Randal	570	" The alternative is , to continue in the course you have begun , and still to rely on me . "
354531	354539	354545	354545	his	570	" Sir , my dear Mr. Egerton , "
354553	354566	354505	354505	Egerton	500	" rely on you ! But that is all I ask . Only "
354567	354592	354545	354545	his	570	" Only , you would say , I am going out of power , and you do n't see the chance of my return ? "
354593	354600	354505	354505	Egerton	500	" I did not mean that . "
354601	354896	354545	354545	his	570	" Permit me to suppose that you did : very true ; but the party I belong to is as sure of return as the pendulum of that clock is sure to obey the mechanism that moves it from left to right . Our successors profess to come in upon a popular question . All administrations who do that are necessarily short - lived . Either they do not go far enough to please present supporters , or they go so far as to arm new enemies in the rivals who outbid them with the people . ' T is the history of all revolutions , and of all reforms . Our own administration in reality is destroyed for having passed what was called a popular measure a year ago , which lost us half our friends , and refusing to propose another popular measure this year , in the which we are outstripped by the men who hallooed us on to the last . Therefore , whatever our successors do , we shall by the law of reaction , have another experiment of power afforded to ourselves . It is but a question of time ; you can wait for it , - whether I can is uncertain . But if I die before that day arrives , I have influence enough still left with those who will come in , to obtain a promise of a better provision for you than that which you have lost . The promises of public men are proverbially uncertain ; but I shall entrust your cause to a man who never failed a friend , and whose rank will enable him to see that justice is done to you , - I speak of Lord L'Estrange . "
354897	354915	354955	354955	Egerton	500	" Oh , not he ; he is unjust to me ; he dislikes me ; he - "
354916	354953	354955	354955	Egerton	500	" May dislike you he has his whims , but he loves me ; and though for no other human being but you would I ask Harley L'Estrange a favour , yet for you I will , "
354972	355088	355278	355279	petit maitre	10492	" for you , a Leslie , a kinsman , however remote , to the wife from whom I received my fortune ! And despite all my cautions , it is possible that in wasting that fortune I may have wronged you . Enough : you have now before you the two options , much as you had at first ; but you have at present more experience to aid you in your choice . You are a man , and with more brains than most men ; think over it well , and decide for yourself . Now to bed , and postpone thought till the morrow . Poor Randal , you look pale ! "
355244	355249	355336	355336	his	10497	" making ruin pompous , "
355330	355334	355430	355431	the baron	17518	" Mon cher , "
355417	355428	355430	355431	the baron	17518	" And this is all that he does for you ! "
355443	355499	355513	355513	Randal	570	" Had he but let you conclude your career at Oxford , I have heard enough of your scholarship to know that you would have taken high honours , been secure of a fellowship , have betaken yourself with content to a slow and laborious profession , and prepared yourself to die on the woolsack . "
355500	355511	355513	355513	Randal	570	" He proposes to me now to return to Oxford , "
355515	355522	355531	355532	the baron	17518	" It is not too late ! "
355523	355529	355531	355532	the baron	17518	" Yes , it is , "
355534	355560	355568	355568	Randal	570	" Neither individuals nor nations ever go back of their own accord . There must be an earthquake before a river recedes to its source . "
355561	355566	355568	355568	Randal	570	" You speak well , "
355570	355581	355531	355532	the baron	17518	" and I can not gainsay you . But now ! "
355582	355620	355568	355568	Randal	570	" Ah , the now is the grand question in life , the then is obsolete , gone by , - out of fashion ; and now , mon cher , you come to ask my advice ? "
355621	355633	355531	355532	the baron	17518	" No , Baron , I come to ask your explanation . "
355634	355638	355568	355568	Randal	570	" Of what ? "
355639	355701	355708	355709	the baron	17518	" I want to know why you spoke to me of Mr. Egerton 's ruin ; why you spoke to me of the lands to be sold by Mr. Thornhill ; and why you spoke to me of Count Peschiera . You touched on each of those points within ten minutes , you omitted to indicate what link can connect them . "
355702	355706	355718	355718	his	17518	" By Jove , "
355738	355783	355810	355810	he	570	" by Jove , Randal Leslie , but your shrewdness is wonderful . You really are the first young man of your day ; and I will ' help you , ' as I helped Audley Egerton . Perhaps you will be more grateful . "
355814	355826	355836	355837	the baron	17518	" Pray , proceed ; I listen to you with interest . "
355827	355834	355836	355837	the baron	17518	" As for politics , then , "
355839	355925	355932	355932	Randal	570	" we will discuss that topic later . I am waiting myself to see how these new men get on . The first consideration is for your private fortunes . You should buy this ancient Leslie property - Rood and Dulmansberry - only L20,000 down ; the rest may remain on mortgage forever - or at least till I find you a rich wife , - as in fact I did for Egerton . Thornhill wants the L20,000 now , - wants them very much . "
355926	355930	355932	355932	Randal	570	" And where , "
355939	355951	355810	355810	he	570	" are the L20,000 you ascribe to me to come from ? "
355952	356010	356021	356021	Randal	570	" Ten thousand shall come to you the day Count Peschiera marries the daughter of his kinsman with your help and aid ; the remaining ten thousand I will lend you . No scruple , I shall hazard nothing , the estates will bear that additional burden . What say you , - shall it be so ? "
356011	356019	356021	356021	Randal	570	" Ten thousand pounds from Count Peschiera ! "
356026	356064	356072	356072	Levy	1175	" You can not be serious ? Such a sum - for what ? - for a mere piece of information ? How otherwise can I aid him ? There must be trick and deception intended here . "
356065	356070	356072	356072	Levy	1175	" My dear fellow , "
356074	356149	356159	356159	Randal	570	" I will give you a hint . There is such a thing in life as being over - suspicious . If you have a fault , it is that . The information you allude to is , of course , the first assistance you are to give . Perhaps more may be needed , perhaps not . Of that you will judge yourself , since the L10,000 are contingent on the marriage aforesaid . "
356150	356157	356159	356159	Randal	570	" Over - suspicious or not , "
356161	356192	356072	356072	Levy	1175	" the amount of the sum is too improbable , and the security too bad , for me to listen to this proposition , even if I could descend to - "
356193	356213	356159	356159	Randal	570	" Stop , mon cher . Business first , scruples afterwards . The security too bad ; what security ? "
356214	356222	356072	356072	Levy	1175	" The word of Count di Peschiera . "
356223	356252	356285	356285	he	570	" He has nothing to do with it , he need know nothing about it . ' T is my word you doubt . I am your security . "
356262	356283	356314	356314	Levy	1175	" Abu Rafe says he will be witness for this fact , but who will be witness for Abu Rafe ? "
356305	356312	356314	356314	Levy	1175	" The fact is simply this , "
356316	356696	356812	356812	he	570	" Count di Peschiera has promised to pay his sister a dowry of L20,000 , in case he has the money to spare . He can only have it to spare by the marriage we are discussing . On my part , as I manage his affairs in England for him , I have promised that , for the said sum of L20,000 , I will guarantee the expenses in the way of that marriage , and settle with Madame di Negra . Now , though Peschiera is a very liberal , warm - hearted fellow , I do n't say that he would have named so large a sum for his sister 's dowry , if in strict truth he did not owe it to her . It is the amount of her own fortune , which by some arrangements with her late husband , not exactly legal , he possessed himself of . If Madame di Negra went to law with him for it , she could get it back . I have explained this to him ; and , in short , you now understand why the sum is thus assessed . But I have bought up Madame di Negra 's debts , I have bought up young Hazeldean 's for we must make a match between these two a part of our arrangements . I shall present to Peschiera , and to these excellent young persons , an account that will absorb the whole L20,000 . That sum will come into my hands . If I settle the claims against them for half the money , which , making myself the sole creditor , I have the right to do , the moiety will remain . And if I choose to give it to you in return for the services which provide Peschiera with a princely fortune , discharge the debts of his sister , and secure her a husband in my promising young client , Mr. Hazeldean , that is my lookout , - all parties are satisfied , and no one need ever be the wiser . The sum is large , no doubt ; it answers to me to give it to you ; does it answer to you to receive it ? "
356782	356786	356842	356842	himself	1175	" outwitting another , "
356844	356916	357065	357065	he	500	" Rood Manor - Dulmansberry , sold to the Thornhills by Sir Gilbert Leslie , knight of the shire ; estimated present net rental L2,250 7s . 0d . It is the greatest bargain I ever knew . And with this estate in hand , and your talents , Leslie , I do n't see why you should not rise higher than Audley Egerton . He was poorer than you once ! "
357057	357063	357065	357065	he	500	" I can not conceive , "
357069	357085	357116	357116	he	1175	" why you should tempt me thus , - what interest it is to you ! "
357109	357114	357116	357116	he	1175	" My dear boy , "
357124	357620	357621	357621	Levy	1175	" it is very natural that you should think a man would have a personal interest in whatever he does for another . I believe that view of human nature is called utilitarian philosophy , and is much in fashion at present . Let me try and explain to you . In this affair I sha'n't injure myself . True , you will say , if I settle claims which amount to L20,000 for L10,000 , I might put the surplus into my own pocket instead of yours . Agreed . But I shall not get the L20,000 , nor repay myself Madame di Negra 's debts whatever I may do as to Hazeldean 's , unless the count gets this heiress . You can help in this . I want you ; and I do n't think I could get you by a less offer than I make . I shall soon pay myself back the L10,000 if the count get hold of the lady and her fortune . Brief , I see my way here to my own interests . Do you want more reasons , - you shall have them . I am now a very rich man . How have I become so ? Through attaching myself from the first to persons of expectations , whether from fortune or talent . I have made connections in society , and society has enriched me . I have still a passion for making money . ' Que voulez - vous ? ' It is my profession , my hobby . It will be useful to me in a thousand ways to secure as a friend a young man who will have influence with other young men , heirs to something better than Rood Hall . You may succeed in public life . A man in public life may attain to the knowledge of State secrets that are very profitable to one who dabbles a little in the Funds . We can perhaps hereafter do business together that may put yourself in a way of clearing off all mortgages on these estates , - on the encumbered possession of which I shall soon congratulate you . You see I am frank ; ' t is the only way of coming to the point with so clever a fellow as you . And now , since the less we rake up the mud in a pond from which we have resolved to drink the better , let us dismiss all other thoughts but that of securing our end . Will you tell Peschiera where the young lady is , or shall I ? Better do it yourself ; reason enough for it , that he has confided to you his hope , and asked you to help him ; why should not you ? Not a word to him about our little arrangement ; he need never know it . You need never be troubled . "
357626	357632	357664	357664	Levy	1175	" Order my carriage round . "
357658	357663	357664	357664	Levy	1175	" The next point , "
357667	357685	357664	357664	Levy	1175	" is to hasten the match between Frank and the fair widow . How does that stand ? "
357686	357697	357664	357664	Levy	1175	" She will not see me , nor receive him . "
357698	357727	357664	357664	Levy	1175	" Oh , learn why ! And if you find on either side there is a hitch , just let me know ; I will soon remove it . "
357728	357738	357664	357664	Levy	1175	" Has Hazeldean consented to the post - obit ? "
357739	357758	357664	357664	Levy	1175	" Not yet ; I have not pressed it ; I wait the right moment , if necessary . "
357759	357765	357664	357664	Levy	1175	" It will be necessary . "
357766	357778	357779	357780	Randal Leslie	570	" Ah , you wish it . It shall be so . "
357803	357854	357863	357864	the baron	17518	" Look you , sir , I am poor and ambitious ; you have tempted me at the right moment , and with the right inducement . I succumb . But what guarantee have I that this money will be paid , these estates made mine upon the conditions stipulated ? "
357855	357861	357863	357864	the baron	17518	" Before anything is settled , "
357866	358021	358027	358027	Randal	570	" go and ask my character of any of our young friends , Borrowell , Spendquick - whom you please ; you will hear me abused , of course ; but they will all say this of me , that when I pass my word , I keep it . If I say , ' Mon cher , you shall have the money , ' a man has it ; if I say , ' I renew your bill for six months , ' it is renewed . ' T , is my way of doing business . In all cases any word is my bond . In this case , where no writing can pass between us , my only bond must be my word . Go , then , make your mind clear as to your security , and come here and dine at eight . We will call on Peschiera afterwards . "
358022	358025	358027	358027	Randal	570	" Yes , "
358029	358237	358255	358255	he	17518	" I will at all events take the day to consider . Meanwhile , I say this , I do not disguise from myself the nature of the proposed transaction , but what I have once resolved I go through with . My sole vindication to myself is , that if I play here with a false die , it will be for a stake so grand , as once won , the magnitude of the prize will cancel the ignominy of the play . It is not this sum of money for which I sell myself , - it is for what that sum will aid me to achieve . And in the marriage of young Hazeldean with the Italian woman , I have another , and it may be a larger interest . I have slept on it lately , - I wake to it now . Insure that marriage , obtain the post - obit . from Hazeldean , and whatever the issue of the more direct scheme for which you seek my services , rely on my gratitude , and believe that you will have put me in the way to render gratitude of avail . At eight I will be with you . "
358248	358253	358255	358255	he	17518	" It is true , "
358259	358482	358674	358679	many such young men about town	10532	" this young man is the next of kin to the Hazeldean estate , if Frank displease his father sufficiently to lose his inheritance ; that must be the clever boy 's design . Well , in the long - run , I should make as much , or more , out of him than out of the spendthrift Frank . Frank 's faults are those of youth . He will reform and retrench . But this man ! No , I shall have him for life . And should he fail in this project , and have but this encumbered property - a landed proprietor mortgaged up to his ears - why , he is my slave , and I can foreclose when I wish , or if he prove useless ; - no , I risk nothing . And if I did - if I lost L10,000 - what then ? I can afford it for revenge ! - afford it for the luxury of leaving Audley Egerton alone with penury and ruin , deserted , in his hour of need , by the pensioner of his bounty , as he will be by the last friend of his youth , when it so pleases me , - me whom he has called ' scoundrel ' ! and whom he - "
358656	358671	358779	358783	one of these experienced referees	10542	" They never said a foolish thing , And never did a wise one . "
358773	358777	358779	358783	one of these experienced referees	10542	" in short , "
358785	359011	359330	359331	Mrs. Avenel	838	" he is the best fellow going - for a money - lender ! You may always rely on what he promises , and he is generally very forbearing and indulgent to us of good society ; perhaps for the same reason that our tailors are , - to send one of us to prison would hurt his custom . His foible is to be thought a gentleman . I believe , much as I suppose he loves money , he would give up half his fortune rather than do anything for which we could cut him . He allows a pension of three hundred a year to Lord S - - - . True ; he was his man of business for twenty years , and before then S - - - was rather a prudent fellow , and had fifteen thousand a year . He has helped on , too , many a clever young man , - the best borough - monger you ever knew . He likes having friends in parliament . In fact , of course he is a rogue ; but if one wants a rogue , one ca n't find a pleasanter . I should like to see him on the French stage , - a prosperous Macaire ; Le Maitre could hit him off to the life . "

359820	359847	359871	359871	Avenel	643	" Things now were coming right , - a vile oligarchy was to be destroyed . British respectability and British talent were to have fair play . "
359863	359869	359871	359871	Avenel	643	" And what is more , "
359888	359934	359940	359941	Mrs. Avenel	838	" if there is to be a new parliament , we must have new men ; not worn - out old brooms that never sweep clean , but men who understand how to govern the country , Sir . I INTEND TO COME IN MYSELF ! "
359935	359938	359940	359941	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Yes , "
359950	360017	360091	360091	Dick	643	" I am sure , Mr. Leslie , you will think I did right . I persuaded Mr. Avenel that , with his talents and property , he ought , for the sake of his country , to make a sacrifice ; and then you know his opinions now are all the fashion , Mr. Leslie ; formerly they would have been called shocking and vulgar ! "
360086	360089	360091	360091	Dick	643	" Bother ! "
360093	360132	360174	360174	his	643	" What do women know about politics ? I wish you 'd mind the child , - it is crumpling up and playing almighty smash with that flim - flam book , which cost me one pound one . "
360180	360205	360258	360258	she	838	" Whe - e - ew , I ca n't stand this ; come and take a walk , Leslie : I want stretching ! "
360252	360256	360258	360258	she	838	" Poor Richard ! "
360260	360288	360314	360316	the young serpent	10591	" he is in one of his humours , - all men have them . Come and see me again soon . When does Almack 's open ? "
360289	360312	360258	360258	she	838	" Nay , I ought to ask you that question , - you who know everything that goes on in our set , "
360322	360326	360359	360359	Dick	643	" our set , "
360350	360357	360384	360384	Randal	570	" Are you coming , there ? "
360371	360382	360384	360384	Randal	570	" I have just been at our friend Levy 's , "
360396	360420	360426	360426	Dick	643	" He , like you , is full of politics ; pleasant man , - for the business he is said to do . "
360421	360424	360426	360426	Dick	643	" Well , "
360430	360447	360457	360457	Randal	570	" I suppose he is pleasant , but make the best of it - and still - "
360448	360456	360468	360470	MR . AVENEL	455	" Still what , my dear Avenel ? "
360473	360482	360485	360485	his	570	" Still the thing itself is not pleasant . "
360491	360503	360457	360457	Randal	570	" You mean borrowing money upon more than five per cent ? "
360504	360585	360485	360485	his	570	" Oh , curse the percentage . I agree with Bentham on the Usury Laws , - no shackles in trade for me , whether in money or anything else . That 's not it . But when one owes a fellow money even at two per cent , and ' t is not convenient to pay him , why , somehow or other , it makes one feel small ; it takes the British Liberty out of a man ! "
360586	360602	360679	360679	Randal	570	" I should have thought you more likely to lend money than to borrow it . "
360603	360678	360731	360732	the housemaid	10594	" Well , I guess you are right there , as a general rule . But I tell you what it is , sir ; there is too great a mania for competition getting up in this rotten old country of ours . I am as liberal as most men . I like competition to a certain extent , but there is too much of it , sir , - too much of it . "
360715	360725	360826	360826	he	455	" Of course heaven and earth are coming together , "
360821	360824	360826	360826	he	455	" Nothing , "
360828	360853	360955	360956	Mr. Avenel	455	" paid such an interest . Manchester was getting worn out , - time to show what Screwstown could do . Nothing like competition . "
360964	360973	361026	361026	Avenel	643	" The tongue touches where the tooth aches , "
361020	361024	361026	361026	Avenel	643	" But Levy , "
361030	361161	361026	361026	Avenel	643	" is a decentish chap in his way , - friendly too . Mrs. A. finds him useful ; brings some of your young highflyers to her soirees . To be sure , they do n't dance , - stand all in a row at the door , like mutes at a funeral . Not but what they have been uncommon civil to me lately , Spendquick particularly . By - the - by , I dine with him to - morrow . The aristocracy are behindhand , - not smart , sir , not up to the march ; but when a man knows how to take 'em , they beat the New Yorkers in good manners . I 'll say that for them . I have no prejudice . "
361162	361177	361026	361026	Avenel	643	" I never saw a man with less ; no prejudice even against Levy . "
361178	361407	361585	361585	Avenel	643	" No , not a bit of it ! Every one says he 's a Jew ; he says he 's not . I do n't care a button what he is . His money is English , - that 's enough for any man of a liberal turn of mind . His charges , too , are moderate . To be sure , he knows I shall pay them ; only what I do n't like in him is a sort of way he has of mon - cher - ing and my - good - fellow - ing one , to do things quite out of the natural way of that sort of business . He knows I have got parliamentary influence . I could return a couple of members for Screwstown , and one , or perhaps two , for Lansmere , where I have of late been cooking up an interest ; and he dictates to - no , not dictates - but tries to humbug me into putting in his own men . However , in one respect , we are likely to agree . He says you want to come into parliament . You seem a smart young fellow ; but you must throw over that stiff red - tapist of yours , and go with Public Opinion , and - Myself . "
361408	361477	361026	361026	Avenel	643	" You are very kind , Avenel ; perhaps when we come to compare opinions we may find that we agree entirely . Still , in Egerton 's present position , delicacy to him - However , we 'll not discuss that now . But you really think I might come in for Lansmere , - against the L'Estrange interest , too , which must be strong there ? "
361478	361493	361585	361585	Avenel	643	" It was very strong , but I 've smashed it , I calculate . "
361494	361503	361026	361026	Avenel	643	" Would a contest there cost very much ? "
361504	361551	361785	361785	his	643	" Well , I guess you must come down with the ready . But , as you say , time enough to discuss that when you have squared your account with ' delicacy ; ' come to me then , and we 'll go into it . "
361760	361774	361872	361873	Dick Avenel	643	" would shut up Mr. Avenel 's factory before the year was out . "
361867	361870	361878	361878	he	643	" If , "
361883	361964	362636	362636	he	570	" if a man like me , who has done so much for British industry and go - a - head principles , is to be catawampously champed up by a mercenary , selfish cormorant of a capitalist like that interloping blockhead in drab breeches , Tom Dyce , all I can say is , that the sooner this cursed old country goes to the dogs , the better pleased I shall be . I wash my hands of it . "
362645	362696	362801	362804	The lodge - keeper	10653	" And yet I entered on life with no patrimony save a ruined hall and a barren waste , - no patrimony but knowledge . I have but turned knowledge from books to men ; for books may give fame after death , but men give us power in life . "
362811	362829	362858	362861	the lodge - keeper	10653	" I have called to see the young lady staying here , - the foreign young lady . "
362866	362887	362894	362894	Randal	1264	" At home , I believe , sir . I rather think she is in the garden with my lady . "
362888	362892	362903	362903	Violante	1264	" I see , "
362908	362930	362938	362938	Randal	1264	" But , since she is walking , I will not disturb her at present . I will call another day . "
362944	362952	363156	363156	his	503	" To Curzon Street , - quick ! "
363159	363177	363665	363665	her	1130	" Good fellow enough , but the last man for that woman to fall in love with ! "
363643	363648	364247	364248	the woman	16413	" hack sights and sounds "
364252	364268	364684	364685	the baron	17518	" No matter how gratefully , how tenderly Leonard had replied , the reply was refusal .
364691	364694	364706	364706	Randal	570	" Well ! "
364695	364704	364706	364706	Randal	570	" As regards the property you spoke of , "
364708	364750	364756	364757	the baron	17518	" I am willing to purchase it on the terms you name . The only point that perplexes me is how to account to Audley Egerton , to my parents , to the world , for the power of purchasing it . "
364751	364754	364756	364757	the baron	17518	" True , "
364787	364855	364684	364685	the baron	17518	" true , we must think of that . If we could manage to conceal the real name of the purchaser for a year or so , it might be easy , - you may be supposed to have speculated in the Funds ; or Egerton may die , and people may believe that he had secured to you something handsome from the ruins of his fortune . "
364856	364864	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" Little chance of Egerton 's dying . "
364865	364868	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" Humph ! "
364873	364897	364684	364685	the baron	17518	" However , this is a mere detail , reserved for consideration . You can now tell us where the young lady is ? "
364898	364944	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" Certainly . I could not this morning , - I can now . I will go with you to the count . Meanwhile , I have seen Madame di Negra ; she will accept Frank Hazeldean if he will but offer himself at once . "
364945	364950	364684	364685	the baron	17518	" Will he not ? "
364951	365015	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" No ! I have been to him . He is overjoyed at my representations , but considers it his duty to ask the consent of his parents . Of course they will not give it ; and if there be delay , she will retract . She is under the influence of passions on the duration of which there is no reliance . "
365016	365022	365107	365109	the young philosopher	10712	" What passions ? Love ? "
365023	365105	365107	365109	the young philosopher	10712	" Love ; but not for Hazeldean . The passions that bring her to accept his hand are pique and jealousy . She believes , in a word , that one who seems to have gained the mastery over her affections with a strange suddenness , is but blind to her charms because dazzled by Violante 's . She is prepared to aid in all that can give her rival to Peschiera ; and yet , such is the inconsistency of woman "
365118	365140	365151	365152	the baron	17518	" that she is also prepared to lose all chance of securing him she loves , by bestowing herself on another ! "
365141	365149	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" Woman , indeed , all over ! "
365171	365233	365107	365109	the young philosopher	10712	" But who is the man whom the fair Beatrice has thus honoured ? Superb creature ! I had some idea of her myself when I bought up her debts ; but it might have embarrassed me , in more general plans , as regards the count . All for the best . Who 's the man ? Not Lord L'Estrange ? "
365234	365291	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" I do not think it is he ; but I have not yet ascertained . I have told you all I know . I found her in a state so excited , so unlike herself , that I had no little difficulty in soothing her into confidence so far . I could not venture more . "
365292	365299	365107	365109	the young philosopher	10712	" And she will accept Frank ? "
365300	365313	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" Had he offered to - day she would have accepted him ! "
365314	365351	365361	365361	Randal	1264	" It may be a great help to your fortunes , mon cher , if Frank Hazeldean marry this lady without his father 's consent . Perhaps he may be disinherited . You are next of kin .
365352	365359	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" How do you know that ? "
365365	365429	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" It is my business to know all about the chances and connections of any one with whom I do money matters . I do money matters with young Mr. Hazeldean ; so I know that the Hazeldean property is not entailed ; and , as the squire 's half - brother has no Hazeldean blood in him , you have excellent expectations . "
365430	365441	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" Did Frank tell you I was next of kin ? "
365442	365455	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" I rather think so ; but I am sure you did . "
365456	365461	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" I - when ? "
365462	365494	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" When you told me how important it was to you that Frank should marry Madame di Negra . Peste ! mon cher , do you think I am a blockhead ? "
365495	365524	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" Well , Baron , Frank is of age , and can marry to please himself . You implied to me that you could help him in this . "
365525	365545	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" I will try . See that he call at Madame di Negra 's tomorrow , at two precisely . "
365546	365583	364870	364871	the baron	17518	" I would rather keep clear of all apparent interference in this matter . Will you not arrange that he call on her ? And do not forget to entangle him in a post - obit . "
365584	365606	366145	366146	Baron Levy	1175	" Leave it to me . Any more wine ? No ? - then let us go to the count 's . "
366150	366160	366276	366279	Poor dear Frank Hazeldean	449	" the force of brightness could no further go . "
366261	366265	366601	366603	The Great Commoner	10749	" Morning Post , "
366612	366732	366839	366839	Frank	449	" for the money he had disdained and squandered . But for Frank Hazeldean 's mode of getting rid of the dross , when gone , what would be left to tell the tale ? Paltry prints in a bachelor 's lodging ; a collection of canes and cherry - sticks ; half - a - dozen letters in ill - spelt French from a figurante ; some long - legged horses , fit for nothing but to lose a race ; that damnable Betting - Book ; and - sic transit gloria - down sweeps some hawk of a Levy , on the wings of an I O U , and not a feather is left of the pigeon !
366830	366837	366839	366839	Frank	449	" I ca n't bear this , "
366849	366985	367165	367165	I	0	" This woman , I can not get her out of my head . I ought to go down to the governor 's ; but then if he gets into a passion , and refuses his consent , where am I ? And he will , too , I fear . I wish I could make out what Randal advises . He seems to recommend that I should marry Beatrice at once , and trust to my mother 's influence to make all right afterwards . But when I ask , ' Is that your advice ? ' he backs out of it . Well , I suppose he is right there . I can understand that he is unwilling , good fellow , to recommend anything that my father would disapprove . But still - "
367172	367191	367304	367304	he	1300	" Bestir thyself : a serious matter is before thee , ponder it well , think of it , "
367309	367312	367304	367304	he	1300	" But still "
367346	367352	367459	367460	Randal Leslie	570	" to think on it , "
367468	367496	367587	367589	a single man	15502	" as to her affection for you , Frank , there is no doubt of that ; she only begins to think you are trifling with her . "
367578	367584	367613	367613	Frank	449	" making up his mind , "
367602	367611	367616	367616	he	449	" One never has a moment for thinking , "
367623	367628	367658	367659	LORD SPENDQUICK	1174	" Not at home . "
367662	367672	367673	367673	FRANK	449	" I have a note for you , Hazeldean . "
367677	367681	367682	367683	LORD SPENDQUICK	1174	" From whom ? "
367686	367741	367742	367742	FRANK	449	" Levy . Just come from him , - never saw him in such a fidget . He was going into the city , - I suppose to see X. Y. Dashed off this note for you , and would have sent it by a servant , but I said I would bring it . "
367750	367772	367773	367773	SPENDQUICK	1174	" I hope he does not want his money yet . ' Private and confidential , ' - that looks bad . "
367776	367782	367783	367783	Frank	449	" Devilish bad , indeed . "
367794	367798	367799	367799	SPENDQUICK	1174	" Dear Hazeldean - "
367803	367835	368237	368237	Spendquick	1174	" Good sign ! He always Spendquicks me when he lends me money ; and ' t is ' My dear Lord ' when he wants it back . Capital sign ! "
368229	368235	368237	368237	Spendquick	1174	" Oh , damn it , "
368239	368289	368298	368298	Frank	449	" but that 's too bad , - employing you to get me to pay him ! Such horrid treachery . Make yourself easy , my dear Frank ; I could never suspect you of anything so unhandsome . I could as soon suspect myself of - paying him - "
368290	368296	368298	368298	Frank	449	" Curzon Street ! Count ! "
368307	368313	368395	368395	his	1174	" It must be so . "
368381	368387	368474	368480	an exceedingly cynical , sceptical old roue	10792	" What 's the matter ? "
368482	368506	368512	368513	the rout	10793	" Pray , do you think there is any truth in the stories about people in former times selling themselves to the devil ? "
368507	368510	368512	368513	the rout	10793	" Ugh , "
368523	368533	368474	368480	an exceedingly cynical , sceptical old roue	10792	" Have you any personal interest in the question ? "
368534	368596	368512	368513	the rout	10793	" I ! - no ; but a friend of mine has just received a letter from Levy , and he flew out of the room in the most ex - tra - ordi - na - ry manner , - just as people did in those days when their time was up ! And Levy , you know , is - "
368597	368646	368652	368652	Spendquick	1174	" Not quite as great a fool as the other dark gentleman to whom you would compare him ; for Levy never made such bad bargains for himself . Time up ! No doubt it is . I should not like to be in your friend 's shoes . "
368647	368650	368652	368652	Spendquick	1174	" Shoes ! "
368660	368716	368936	368936	Frank	449	" you never saw a neater fellow , nor one , to do him justice , who takes more time in dressing than he does in general . And talking of shoes , he rushed out with the right boot on the left foot , and the left boot on the right . Very mysterious ! "
368945	368954	368936	368936	Frank	449	" What is this ? - an execution ? "
368955	368960	368936	368936	Frank	449	" Yes , sir . "
368961	368966	368936	368936	Frank	449	" For what sum ? "
368967	368983	368936	368936	Frank	449	" Fifteen hundred and forty - seven pounds . We are the first in possession . "
368984	368991	368936	368936	Frank	449	" There are others , then ? "
368992	369030	369173	369173	he	449	" Or else , sir , we should never have taken this step . Most painful to our feelings , sir ; but these foreigners are here to day , and gone to - morrow . And - "
369162	369172	369256	369256	he	449	" Oh , Madame di Negra ! - Beatrice ! "
369191	369253	369256	369256	he	449	" forgive me , forgive me ! do n't see in me a mere acquaintance . By accident I learned , or , rather , guessed - this - this strange insult to which you are so unworthily exposed . I am here . Think of me - but as a friend , - the truest friend . Oh , Beatrice , "
369267	369322	369381	369381	she	743	" I never dared say so before , it seems presuming to say it now , but I can not help it . I love you , - I love you with my whole heart and soul ; to serve you - if only but to serve you ! - I ask nothing else . "
369375	369380	369381	369381	she	743	" Rise , rise , "
369385	369398	369497	369498	the count	18827	" I thank you gratefully . But do not suppose that I - "
369399	369420	369381	369381	she	743	" Hush ! hush ! - you must not refuse me . Hush ! do n't let your pride speak . "
369421	369488	369666	369667	the count	18827	" No , it is not my pride . You exaggerate what is occurring here . You forget that I have a brother . I have sent for him . He is the only one I can apply to . Ah , that is his knock ! But I shall never , never forget that I have found one generous noble heart in this hollow world . "
369659	369664	369666	369667	the count	18827	" Pr - rr ! "
369679	369711	369776	369776	his	18827	" Pr - rr - It seems to me that you must have passed a very unpleasant quarter of an hour . And now - Dieu me damne , quoi faire ! "
369791	369808	369815	369815	Beatrice	1130	" One whom my sister admits at such a moment must be a friend to me . "
369809	369813	369815	369815	Beatrice	1130	" Mr. Hazeldean , "
369820	369848	369854	369855	the count	18827	" would indeed have nobly pressed on me the offer of an aid which I need no more , since you , my brother , are here . "
369849	369852	369854	369855	the count	18827	" Certainly , "
369865	369894	369908	369908	Beatrice	1130	" I will go down and clear your house of this impertinent canaille . But I thought your affairs were with Baron Levy . He should be here . "
369895	369907	369970	369971	the latter	1552	" I expect him every moment . Adieu ! Mr. Hazeldean . "
369964	369968	369970	369971	the latter	1552	" Mr. Hazeldean , "
369978	369988	370025	370025	Peschiera	1132	" will you come into the drawing - room ? "
370018	370023	370025	370025	Peschiera	1132	" My dear sir , "
370027	370082	370119	370119	Levy	1175	" I am so unacquainted with your English laws , and your mode of settling embarrassments of this degrading nature , and you have evidently showed so kind a sympathy in my sister 's distress , that I venture to ask you to stay here , and aid me in consulting with Baron Levy . "
370114	370117	370132	370132	he	1175	" Ouf ! "
370143	370172	370183	370183	Peschiera	1132	" ouf ! this is a very sad business , - very ; and nothing , my dear count , nothing but ready money can save us here . "
370173	370181	370187	370187	his	1132	" You know my affairs , Levy , "
370190	370257	370132	370132	he	1175	" and that though in a few months , or it may be weeks , I could discharge with ease my sister 's debts , whatever their amount , yet at this moment , and in a strange land , I have not the power to do so . The money I brought with me is nearly exhausted . Can you not advance the requisite sum ? "
370258	370275	370283	370284	the count	18827	" Impossible ! - Mr. Hazeldean is aware of the distress under which I labour myself . "
370276	370281	370283	370284	the count	18827	" In that case , "
370286	370323	370329	370329	Levy	1175	" all we can do to - day is to remove my sister , and let the execution proceed . Meanwhile I will go among my friends , and see what I can borrow from them . "
370324	370327	370329	370329	Levy	1175	" Alas ! "
370339	370389	370406	370406	Peschiera	1132	" alas ! - we can not remove the marchesa , - the worst is to come . Look ! - you see those three men ; they have a writ against her person : the moment she sets her foot out of these doors she will be arrested . "
370401	370404	370430	370431	the baron	17518	" Arrested ! "
370413	370428	370430	370431	the baron	17518	" I have done my best to prevent this disgrace , but in vain , "
370437	370464	370470	370470	Frank	449	" You see these English tradespeople fancy they have no hold upon foreigners . But we can get bail ; she must not go to prison - "
370465	370468	370511	370512	the count	18827	" Prison ! "
370505	370509	370511	370512	the count	18827	" My sister ! "
370514	370526	370548	370548	Frank	449	" daughter to a Peschiera , widow to a Di Negra ! "
370540	370546	370511	370512	the count	18827	" What is the sum ? "
370580	370619	370511	370512	the count	18827	" We may settle all liabilities for L5,000 . Nothing to Peschiera , who is enormously rich . Entre nous , I doubt his assurance that he is without ready money . It may be so , but - "
370620	370633	370511	370512	the count	18827	" Five thousand pounds ! How can I raise such a sum ? "
370634	370682	370511	370512	the count	18827	" You , my dear Hazeldean ? What are you talking about ? To be sure you could raise twice as much with a stroke of your pen , and throw your own debts into the bargain . But - to be so generous to an acquaintance ! "
370683	370704	370511	370512	the count	18827	" Acquaintance ! - Madame di Negra ! the height of my ambition is to claim her as my wife ! "
370705	370714	370723	370723	Frank	449	" And these debts do n't startle you ? "
370715	370721	370744	370744	he	449	" If a man loves , "
370727	370743	370744	370744	he	449	" he feels it most when the woman he loves is in affliction . And , "
370751	370791	370511	370512	the count	18827	" though these debts are faults , kindness at this moment may give me the power to cure forever both her faults and my own . I can raise this money by a stroke of the pen ! How ? "
370792	370798	370799	370799	Frank	449	" On the Casino property . "
370803	370808	370744	370744	he	449	" No other way ? "
370809	370937	370939	370940	the count	18827	" Of course not . But I know your scruples ; let us see if they can be conciliated . You would marry Madame di Negra ; she will have L20,000 on her wedding - day . Why not arrange that , out of this sum , your anticipative charge on the Casino property be paid at once ? Thus , in truth , it will be but for a few weeks that the charge will exist . The bond will remain locked in my desk ; it can never come to your father 's know ledge , nor wound his feelings . And when you marry if you will but be prudent in the mean while , you will not owe a debt in the world . "
370945	371007	371013	371013	Frank	449	" Mr. Hazeldean , I asked you to stay and aid us by your counsel ; I see now that counsel is unavailing . This blow on our House must fall ! I thank you , Sir , - I thank you . Farewell . Levy , come with me to my poor sister , and prepare her for the worst . "
371008	371011	371013	371013	Frank	449	" Count , "
371015	371069	371077	371077	Peschiera	1132	" hear me . My acquaintance with you is but slight , but I have long known and - and esteemed your sister . Baron Levy has suggested a mode in which I can have the honour and the happiness of removing this temporary but painful embarrassment . I can advance the money . "
371070	371075	371077	371077	Peschiera	1132	" No , no ! "
371079	371130	371138	371138	Levy	1175	" How can you suppose that I will hear of such a proposition ? Your youth and benevolence mislead and blind you . Impossible , sir , - impossible ! Why , even if I had no pride , no delicacy of my own , my sister 's fair fame - "
371131	371136	371138	371138	Levy	1175	" Would suffer indeed , "
371140	371196	371077	371077	Peschiera	1132	" if she were under such obligation to any one but her affianced husband . Nor , whatever my regard for you , Count , could I suffer my client , Mr. Hazeldean , to make this advance upon any less valid security than that of the fortune to which Madame di Negra is entitled . "
371197	371219	371241	371242	gentleman Frank	449	" Ha ! - is this indeed so ? You are a suitor for my sister 's hand , Mr. Hazeldean ? "
371220	371239	371262	371263	the count	18827	" But not at this moment , - not to owe her hand to the compulsion of gratitude , "
371244	371261	371265	371265	himself	18827	" Gratitude ! And you do not know her heart , then ? Do not know - "
371274	371413	371419	371419	his	1175	" Mr. Hazeldean , I need not say that we rank among the first Houses in Europe . My pride led me formerly into the error of disposing of my sister 's hand to one whom she did not love , merely because in rank he was her equal . I will not again commit such an error , nor would Beatrice again obey me if I sought to constrain her . Where she marries , there she will love . If , indeed , she accepts you , as I believe she will , it will be from affection solely . If she does , I can not scruple to accept this loan , - a loan from a brother - inlaw - loan to me , and not charged against her fortune ! That , sir , "
371423	371475	371504	371504	Levy	1175	" you will take care to arrange . If she do not accept you , Mr. Hazeldean , the loan , I repeat , is not to be thought of . Pardon me , if I leave you . This , one way or other , must be decided at once . "
371499	371502	371504	371504	Levy	1175	" If , "
371516	371577	371693	371693	Peschiera	1132	" if the count pay the debts , and the lady 's fortune be only charged with your own , after all , it will not be a bad marriage in the world 's eye , nor ought it to be in a father 's . Trust me , we shall get Mr. Hazeldean 's consent , and cheerfully too . "
371685	371691	371693	371693	Peschiera	1132	" My dear young friend , "
371695	371825	371876	371877	the count	18827	" as I suspected , my sister 's heart is wholly yours . Stop ; hear me out . But , unluckily , I informed her of your generous proposal ; it was most unguarded , most ill - judged in me , and that has well - nigh spoiled all ; she has so much pride and spirit ; so great a fear that you may think yourself betrayed into an imprudence which you may hereafter regret , that I am sure she will tell you that she does not love you , she can not accept you , and so forth . Lovers like you are not easily deceived . Do n't go by her words ; but you shall see her yourself and judge . Come . "
371863	371874	371876	371877	the count	18827	" I have brought my friend to plead for himself , "
371882	371910	371965	371965	she	7028	" and take my advice , sister , and do not throw away all prospect of real and solid happiness for a vain scruple . Heed me ! "

Young , fair , noble as you are , I do not love you as you should be loved . Go ; leave this house ; you do not know my brother . Go , go - while I have still strength , still virtue enough to reject whatever may protect me from him ! whatever - may - Oh , go , go . "
372076	372083	372085	372085	Frank	449	" You do not love me ? "
372087	372166	372339	372339	Peschiera	1132	" Well , I do n't wonder at it ; you are so brilliant , so superior to me . I will abandon hope , - I will leave you , as you command me . But at least I will not part with my privilege to serve you . As for the rest , shame on me if I could be mean enough to boast of love , and enforce a suit , at such a moment . "

374867	374897	374911	374912	the squire	1498	" He dines with you at your hotel , Squire ? Well , you must be kind to him . We ca n't put old heads upon young shoulders . "

374914	374970	374979	374980	the parson	1499	" but I wish he had a little of Randal Leslie 's good sense in it . I see how it will end ; I must take him back to the country ; and if he wants occupation , why , he shall keep the hounds , and I 'll put him into Brooksby farm . "
374971	374977	375025	375026	Mr. Dale	446	" As for the hounds , "
374982	375023	375065	375066	the Athenians	4030	" hounds necessitate horses ; and I think more mischief comes to a young man of spirit from the stables than from any other place in the world . They ought to be exposed from the pulpit , those stables ! "

375082	375172	375202	375203	the parson	1499	" you need not go so far back for an example . It is enough for a Hazeldean that his father and his grandfather and his great - grandfather all farmed before him ; and a devilish deal better , I take it , than any of those musty old Athenians , no offence to them . But I 'll tell you one thing , Parson , a man to farm well , and live in the country , should have a wife ; it is half the battle . "
375173	375200	375202	375203	the parson	1499	" As to a battle , a man who is married is pretty sure of half , though not always the better half , of it , "
375212	375283	375292	375293	the squire	1498	" Ah , Squire , I wish I could think Mrs. Hazeldean right in her conjecture ! - you would have the prettiest daughter - in - law in the three kingdoms . And I do believe that , if I could have a good talk with the young lady apart from her father , we could remove the only objection I know to the marriage . Those Popish errors - "
375284	375290	375292	375293	the squire	1498	" Ah , very true ! "
375295	375370	375202	375203	the parson	1499	" that Pope sticks hard in my gizzard . I could excuse her being a foreigner , and not having , I suppose , a shilling in her pocket - bless her handsome face ! - but to be worshipping images in her room instead of going to the parish church , that will never do . But you think you could talk her out of the Pope , and into the family pew ? "
375371	375414	375421	375422	the squire	1498	" Why , I could have talked her father out of the Pope , only , when he had not a word to say for himself , he bolted out of the window . Youth is more ingenuous in confessing its errors . "
375415	375419	375421	375422	the squire	1498	" I own , "
375424	375615	375202	375203	the parson	1499	" that both Harry and I had a favourite notion of ours till this Italian girl got into our heads . Do you know we both took a great fancy to Randal 's little sister , - pretty , blushing , English - faced girl as ever you saw . And it went to Harry 's good heart to see her so neglected by that silly , fidgety mother of hers , her hair hanging about her ears ; and I thought it would be a fine way to bring Randal and Frank more together , and enable me to do something for Randal himself , - a good boy with Hazeldean blood in his veins . But Violante is so handsome , that I do n't wonder at the boy 's choice ; and then it is our fault , - we let them see so much of each other as children . However , I should be very angry if Rickeybockey had been playing sly , and running away from the Casino in order to give Frank an opportunity to carry on a clandestine intercourse with his daughter . "
375616	375666	375667	375667	SQUIRE	447	" I do n't think that would be like Riccabocca ; more like him to run away in order to deprive Frank of the best of all occasions to court Violante , if he so desired ; for where could he see more of her than at the Casino ? "
375670	375751	375752	375752	PARSON	445	" That 's well put . Considering he was only a foreign doctor , and , for aught we know , once went about in a caravan , he is a gentleman - like fellow , that Rickeybockey . I speak of people as I find them . But what is your notion about Frank ? I see you do n't think he is in love with Violante , after all . Out with it , man ; speak plain . "
375755	375787	375788	375788	SQUIRE	447	" Since you so urge me , I own I do not think him in love with her ; neither does my Carry , who is uncommonly shrewd in such matters . "
375791	375813	375814	375814	PARSON	445	" Your Carry , indeed ! - as if she were half as shrewd as my Harry . Carry - nonsense ! "
375818	375853	375854	375854	SQUIRE	447	" I do n't want to make invidious remarks ; but , Mr. Hazeldean , when you sneer at my Carry , I should not be a man if I did not say that - "
375858	375875	375913	375913	SQUIRE	447	" She is a good little woman enough ; but to compare her to my Harry ! "
375879	375912	375913	375913	SQUIRE	447	" I do n't compare her to your Harry ; I do n't compare her to any woman in England , Sir . But you are losing your temper , Mr. Hazeldean ! "
375916	375919	375920	375920	PARSON	445	" I ! "
375923	375991	375992	375992	SQUIRE	447	" And people are staring at you , Mr. Hazeldean . For decency 's sake , compose yourself , and change the subject . We are just at the Albany . I hope that we shall not find poor Captain Higginbotham as ill as he represents himself in his letter . Ah , is it possible ? No , it can not be . Look - look ! "
375995	376017	376018	376018	PARSON	445	" Where - what - where ? Do n't pinch so hard . Bless me , do you see a ghost ? "
376021	376029	376030	376030	SQUIRE	447	" There ! the gentleman in black ! "
376033	376046	376067	376067	himself	1499	" Gentleman in black ! What ! in broad daylight ! Nonsense ! "
376081	376138	376149	376150	the squire	1498	" Sir , pardon me ; but is not your name Fairfield ? Ah , it is Leonard , - it is - my dear , dear boy ! What joy ! So altered , so improved , but still the same honest face . Squire , come here - your old friend , Leonard Fairfield . "
376139	376147	376149	376150	the squire	1498	" And he wanted to persuade me , "
376159	376217	376226	376226	Leonard	450	" that you were the Gentleman in Black ; but , indeed , he has been in strange humours and tantrums all the morning . Well , Master Lenny ; why , you are grown quite a gentleman ! The world thrives with you , eh ? I suppose you are head - gardener to some grandee . "
376218	376224	376226	376226	Leonard	450	" Not that , sir , "
376230	376296	376297	376297	PARSON	445	" but the world has thriven with me at last , though not without some rough usage at starting . Ah , Mr. Dale , you can little guess how often I have thought of you and your discourse on Knowledge ; and , what is more , how I have lived to feel the truth of your words , and to bless the lesson . "
376304	376341	376342	376342	SQUIRE	447	" I expected nothing less from you , Leonard ; you were always a lad of great sense , and sound judgment . So you have thought of my little discourse on Knowledge , have you ? "
376345	376377	376378	376378	PARSON	445	" Hang knowledge ! I have reason to hate the word . It burned down three ricks of mine ; the finest ricks you ever set eyes on , Mr. Fairfield . "
376381	376393	376394	376394	SQUIRE	447	" That was not knowledge , Squire ; that was ignorance . "
376397	376437	376438	376438	LEONARD	450	" Ignorance ! The deuce it was . I 'll just appeal to you , Mr. Fairfield . We have been having sad riots in the shire , and the ringleader was just such another lad as you were ! "
376441	376457	376458	376458	SQUIRE	447	" I am very much obliged to you , Mr. Hazeldean . In what respect ? "
376461	376590	376591	376591	LEONARD	450	" Why , he was a village genius , and always reading some cursed little tract or other ; and got mighty discontented with King , Lords , and Commons , I suppose , and went about talking of the wrongs of the poor , and the crimes of the rich , till , by Jove , sir , the whole mob rose one day with pitchforks and sickles , and smash went Farmer Smart 's thrashing - machines ; and on the same night my ricks were on fire . We caught the rogues , and they were all tried ; but the poor deluded labourers were let off with a short imprisonment . The village genius , thank Heaven , is sent packing to Botany Bay . "
376594	376608	376609	376609	PARSON	445	" But did his books teach him to burn ricks and smash machines ? "
376612	376632	376633	376633	SQUIRE	447	" No ; he said quite the contrary , and declared that he had no hand in those misdoings . "
376636	376845	376846	376846	PARSON	15187	" But he was proved to have excited , with his wild talk , the boobies who had ! ' Gad , sir , there was a hypocritical Quaker once , who said to his enemy , ' I ca n't shed thy blood , friend , but I will hold thy head under water till thou art drowned . ' And so there is a set of demagogical fellows , who keep calling out , ' Farmer , this is an oppressor , and Squire , that is a vampire ! But no violence ! Do n't smash their machines , do n't burn their ricks ! Moral force , and a curse on all tyrants ! ' Well , and if poor Hodge thinks moral force is all my eye , and that the recommendation is to be read backwards , in the devil 's way of reading the Lord 's prayer , I should like to know which of the two ought to go to Botany Bay , - Hodge , who comes out like a man , if he thinks he is wronged , or t ' other sneaking chap , who makes use of his knowledge to keep himself out of the scrape ? "
376849	376988	376989	376989	LEONARD	450	" It may be very true ; but when I saw that poor fellow at the bar , with his intelligent face , and heard his bold clear defence , and thought of all his hard struggles for knowledge , and how they had ended , because he forgot that knowledge is like fire , and must not be thrown amongst flax , - why , I could have given my right hand to save him . And , oh , Squire , do you remember his poor mother 's shriek of despair when he was sentenced to transportation for life - I hear it now ! And what , Leonard - what do you think had misled him ? At the bottom of all the mischief was a tinker 's bag . You can not forget Sprott ? "
376992	376999	377000	377000	SQUIRE	447	" Tinker 's bag ! Sprott ! "
377003	377103	377104	377104	PARSON	445	" That rascal , sir , was the hardest follow to nab you could possibly conceive ; as full of quips and quirks as an Old Bailey lawyer . But we managed to bring it home to him . Lord ! his bag was choke - full of tracts against every man who had a good coat on his back ; and as if that was not enough , cheek by jowl with the tracts were lucifers , contrived on a new principle , for teaching my ricks the theory of spontaneous combustion . The labourers bought the lucifers - "
377107	377117	377118	377118	SQUIRE	447	" And the poor village genius bought the tracts . "
377121	377265	377266	377266	PARSON	445	" All headed with a motto , ' To teach the working classes that knowledge is power . ' So that I was right in saying that knowledge had burnt my ricks ; knowledge inflamed the village genius , the village genius inflamed fellows more ignorant than himself , and they inflamed my stackyard . However , lucifers , tracts , village genius , and Sprott are all off to Botany Bay ; and the shire has gone on much the better for it . So no more of your knowledge for me , begging your pardon , Mr. Fairfield . Such uncommonly fine ricks as mine were too ! I declare , Parson , you are looking as if you felt pity for Sprott ; and I saw you , indeed , whispering to him as he was taken out of court . "
377271	377292	377293	377293	SQUIRE	447	" Indeed , Squire , I was only asking him what had become of his donkey , an unoffending creature . "
377296	377328	377329	377329	PARSON	445	" Unoffending ! Upset me amidst a thistle - bed in my own village green ! I remember it . Well , what did he say had become of the donkey ? "
377332	377381	377382	377382	SQUIRE	447	" He said but one word ; but that showed all the vindictiveness of his disposition . He said it with a horrid wink , that made my blood run cold . ' What 's become of your poor donkey ? ' said I , and he answered - "
377385	377392	377393	377393	PARSON	445	" Go on . He answered - "
377396	377401	377402	377402	SQUIRE	447	" ' Sausages . ' "
377405	377439	377402	377402	SQUIRE	447	" Sausages ! Like enough ; and sold to the poor ; and that 's what the poor will come to if they listen to such revolutionizing villains . Sausages ! Donkey sausages ! "
377442	377455	377501	377502	the parson	1499	" ' T is bad as eating one another ; perfect cannibalism . "
377510	377578	377597	377598	the squire	1498	" No ; do n't leave me yet , Leonard , - I have so much to ask you , and to talk about . I shall be at leisure shortly . We are just now going to call on a relation of the squire 's , whom you must recollect , I am sure , - Captain Higginbotham - Barnabas Higginbotham . He is very poorly . "
377579	377595	377606	377606	LEONARD	450	" And I am sure he would take it kind in you to call too , "
377609	377622	377623	377623	SQUIRE	447	" Nay , sir , would not that be a great liberty ? "
377626	377691	377692	377692	LEONARD	450	" Liberty ! To ask a poor sick gentleman how he is ? Nonsense . And I say , Sir , perhaps , as no doubt you have been living in town , and know more of newfangled notions than I do , - perhaps you can tell us whether or not it is all humbug , - that new way of doctoring people . "
377695	377707	377708	377708	SQUIRE	15284	" What new way , sir . There are so many . "
377711	377752	377753	377753	PARSON	445	" Are there ? Folks in London do look uncommonly sickly . But my poor cousin he was never a Solomon has got hold , he says , of a homely - homely - What 's the word , Parson ? "
377755	377758	377759	377759	SQUIRE	15284	" Homoeopathist . "
377762	377912	377913	377913	PARSON	445	" That 's it . You see the captain went to live with one Sharpe Currie , a relation who had a great deal of money , and very little liver ; - made the one , and left much of the other in Ingee , you understand . The captain had expectations of the money . Very natural , I dare say ; but Lord , sir , what do you think has happened ? Sharpe Currie has done him . Would not die , Sir ; got back his liver , and the captain has lost his own . Strangest thing you ever heard . And then the ungrateful old Nabob has dismissed the captain , saying , ' He ca n't bear to have invalids about him ; ' and is going to marry , and I have no doubt will have children by the dozen ! "
377916	378025	378026	378026	LEONARD	450	" It was in Germany , at one of the Spas , that Mr. Currie recovered ; and as he had the selfish inhumanity to make the captain go through a course of waters simultaneously with himself , it has so chanced that the same waters that cured Mr. Currie 's liver have destroyed Captain Higginbotham 's . An English homoeopathic physician , then staying at the Spa , has attended the captain hither , and declares that he will restore him by infinitesimal doses of the same chemical properties that were found in the waters which diseased him . Can there be anything in such a theory ? "
378029	378079	378080	378080	SQUIRE	447	" I once knew a very able , though eccentric homoeopathist , and I am inclined to believe there may be something in the system . My friend went to Germany ; it may possibly be the same person who attends the captain . May I ask his name ? "
378083	378110	378080	378080	SQUIRE	447	" Cousin Barnabas does not mention it . You may ask it of himself , for here we are at his chambers . I say , Parson "
378114	378146	378147	378147	PARSON	445	" if a small dose of what hurt the captain is to cure him , do n't you think the proper thing would be a - legacy ? Ha ! ha ! "
378154	378176	378203	378204	the woman	16413	" Hush , Squire . Poor human nature ! We must be merciful to its infirmities . Come in , Leonard . "
378207	378216	378203	378204	the woman	16413	" did for the captain and his rooms , "
378263	378316	378334	378335	the squire	1498	" Very good in you to come to town to see me , - very good in you , cousin , and in you , too , Mr. Dale . How very well you are both looking ! I 'm a sad wreck . You might count every bone in my body . "
378317	378332	378334	378335	the squire	1498	" Hazeldean air and roast beef will soon set you up , my boy , "
378339	378359	378371	378372	the captain	2114	" You were a great goose to leave them , and these comfortable rooms of yours in the Albany . "
378360	378369	378371	378372	the captain	2114	" They are comfortable , though not showy , "
378380	378414	378423	378424	the captain	2114	" I had done my best to make them so . New carpets , this very chair - morocco ! , that Japan cat holds toast and muffins - just when - just when "
378428	378490	378500	378502	the compassionate squire	11005	" just when that ungrateful , bad - hearted man wrote me word ' he was - was dying and lone in the world ; ' and - and - to think what I 've gone through for him ; - and to treat me so ! Cousin William , he has grown as hale as yourself , and - and - "
378491	378498	378500	378502	the compassionate squire	11005	" Cheer up , cheer up ! "
378504	378525	378574	378574	me	0	" It is a very hard case , I allow . But you see , as the old proverb says , "
378576	378576	378583	378585	the poor captain	11010	"
378577	378581	378583	378585	the poor captain	11010	" Cousin William , "
378587	378664	378665	378665	PARSON	445	" I am sure I never calculated ; but still , if you had seen that deceitful man 's good - for - nothing face - as yellow as a guinea - and have gone through all I 've gone through , you would have felt cut to the heart , as I do . I ca n't bear ingratitude . I never could . But let it pass . Will that gentleman take a chair ? "
378668	378708	378709	378709	CAPTAIN	529	" Mr. Fairfield has kindly called with us , because he knows something of this system of homeeopathy which you have adopted , and may , perhaps , know the practitioner . What is the name of your doctor ? "
378716	378720	378709	378709	CAPTAIN	529	" That reminds me "
378725	378765	378782	378783	the squire	1498	" A great relief these little pills - after the physic I 've taken to please that malignant man . He always tried his doctor 's stuff upon me . But there 's another world , and a juster ! "
378777	378780	378786	378786	his	1498	" Touched , "
378792	378828	378971	378972	The parson	1499	" You seem to have a good - tidy sort of a nurse here , Cousin Barnabas . I hope she 's pleasant , and lively , and do n't let you take on so . "
378829	378946	378948	378953	the woman with " expectations "	22909	" Hist ! - do n't talk of her . All mercenary ; every bit of her fawning ! Would you believe it ? I give her ten shillings a week , besides all that goes down of my pats of butter and rolls , and I overheard the jade saying to the laundress that ' I could not last long ; and she 'd - EXPECTATIONS ! ' Ah , Mr. Dale , when one thinks of the sinfulness there is in this life ! But I 'll not think of it . No , I 'll not . Let us change the subject . You were asking my doctor 's name . It is - "

379007	379013	379089	379090	The squire	1498	" How go the symptoms ? "
379105	379126	379089	379090	The squire	1498	" Bless me ! Lord bless me ! What , more still ! Death would be a very happy release ! "
379174	379200	379225	379226	the squire	1498	" Capital , - nothing can be better . This powder must be dissolved in eight tablespoonfuls of water ; one spoonful every two hours . "
379201	379204	379089	379090	The squire	1498	" Tablespoonful ? "
379205	379208	379225	379226	the squire	1498	" Tablespoonful . "
379209	379223	379230	379230	his	1498	" ' Nothing can be better , ' did you say , sir ? "
379251	379257	379267	379268	Dr. Morgan	942	" nothing can be better ? "
379258	379265	379282	379283	the squire	1498	" For the diagnosis , sir ! "
379270	379280	379282	379283	the squire	1498	" For the dogs ' noses , very possibly , "
379285	379302	379312	379313	Dr. Morgan	942	" but for the inside of Cousin Higginbotham , I should think nothing could be worse . "
379303	379310	379312	379313	Dr. Morgan	942	" You are mistaken , sir , "
379315	379403	379282	379283	the squire	1498	" It is not the captain who speaks here , - it is his liver . Liver , sir , though a noble , is an imaginative organ , and indulges in the most extraordinary fictions . Seat of poetry and love and jealousy - the liver . Never believe what it says . You have no idea what a liar it is ! But - ahem - ahem . Cott - I think I 've seen you before , sir . Surely your name 's Hazeldean ? "
379404	379421	379312	379313	Dr. Morgan	942	" William Hazeldean , at your service , Doctor . But where have you seen me ? "
379422	379442	379449	379450	the squire	1498	" On the hustings at Lansmere . You were speaking on behalf of your distinguished brother , Mr. Egerton . "
379443	379447	379449	379450	the squire	1498	" Hang it ! "
379452	379494	379540	379540	his	6258	" I think it must have been my liver that spoke there ! for I promised the electors that that half - brother of mine would stick by the land , and I never told a bigger lie in my life ! "
379546	379568	379580	379581	the doctor	1651	" Doctor , another friend of mine , the Rev. Mr. Dale , and a gentleman who is acquainted with homoeopathy . "
379569	379578	379623	379624	the doctor	1651	" Dale ? What , more old friends ! "
379610	379621	379700	379701	Dr. Morgan	942	" We have met before on a very mournful occasion , "
379689	379698	379731	379731	he	942	" Cott ! and it is the poy ! "
379740	379749	379760	379761	the squire	1498	" Aconite , - good against nervous shocks ! "
379755	379758	379760	379761	the squire	1498	" Gad , "
379766	379788	379789	379790	The captain	2114	" ' t is the first doctor I ever saw swallow his own medicine ! There must be something in it . "
379812	379825	379832	379833	the doctor	1651	" And as to diet ? What shall I have for dinner ? "
379826	379830	379844	379845	the squire	1498	" A friend ! "
379839	379842	379844	379845	the squire	1498	" Zounds ! "
379849	379894	379900	379901	Dr. Morgan	942	" do you mean to say , that the British laws to be sure they are very much changed of late allow you to diet your patients upon their fellow - men ? Why , Parson , this is worse than the donkey sausages . "
379895	379898	379900	379901	Dr. Morgan	942	" Sir , "
379905	379995	379996	379997	The captain	2114	" I mean to say , that it matters little what we eat in comparison with care as to whom we eat with . It is better to exceed a little with a friend than to observe the strictest regimen , and eat alone . Talk and laughter help the digestion , and are indispensable in affections of the liver . I have no doubt , sir , that it was my patient 's agreeable society that tended to restore to health his dyspeptic relative , Mr. Sharpe Currie . "
380001	380029	380063	380064	the squire	1498	" And , therefore , if one of you gentlemen will stay and dine with Mr. Higginbotham , it will greatly assist the effects of his medicine . "
380047	380061	380063	380064	the squire	1498	" I ' m engaged to dine with my son - very sorry , "
380066	380072	380084	380085	the captain	2114	" But Dale , here - "
380073	380081	380084	380085	the captain	2114	" If he will be so kind , "
380087	380103	380340	380340	Morgan	942	" we might cheer the evening with a game at whist , - double dummy . "
380352	380375	380421	380422	the doctor	1651	" But I must have some talk with you ; and you have to tell me all about the little orphan girl . "
380404	380419	380593	380593	Leonard	450	" I am going in the country a few miles to see a patient , "
380592	380592	380656	380656	he	450	"
380647	380654	380656	380656	he	450	" I remember him very well , "
380658	380729	380804	380804	he	1651	" when I practised murder as an allopathist at Lansmere . But to think that wild boy , so full of whim and life and spirit , should become staid enough for a guardian to that dear little child , with her timid eyes and pulsatilla sensibilities . Well , wonders never cease ! And he has befriended you too , you say . Ah , he knew your family . "
380730	380752	380764	380765	the doctor	1651	" So he says . Do you think , sir , that he ever knew - ever saw - my mother ? "
380753	380762	380804	380804	he	1651	" Eh ! your mother ? - Nora ? "
380810	380833	380804	380804	he	1651	" No doubt he saw her ; she was brought up at Lady Lansmere 's . Did he not tell you so ? "
380834	380837	380931	380931	He	502	" No . "
380939	380956	380931	380931	He	502	" You told me you did not know by what name I should call my father . "
380957	380972	380931	380931	He	502	" And I told you the truth , to the best of my belief . "
380973	380980	380931	380931	He	502	" By your honour , sir ? "
380981	380992	381130	381131	The doctor	1651	" By my honour , I do not know it . "
381139	381191	381198	381198	Leonard	450	" I am going to see a very interesting patient , - coats to his stomach quite worn out , sir , - man of great learning , with a very inflamed cerebellum . I ca n't do him much good , and he does me a great deal of harm . "
381192	381196	381392	381393	the doctor	1651	" How harm ? "
381207	381391	381392	381393	the doctor	1651	" Hits me on the heart , and makes my eyes water ; very pathetic case , - grand creature , who has thrown himself away . Found him given over by the allopathists , and in a high state of delirium tremens , restored him for a time , took a great liking to him , - could not help it , - swallowed a great many globules to harden myself against him , would not do , brought him over to England with the other patients , who all pay me well except Captain Higginbotham . But this poor fellow pays me nothing , - costs me a great deal in time and turnpikes , and board and lodging . Thank Heaven , I 'm a single man , and can afford it ! My poy , I would let all the other patients go to the allopathists if I could but save this poor , big , penniless , princely fellow . But what can one do with a stomach that has not a rag of its coats left ? Stop "
381400	381416	381462	381462	he	450	" This is the stile . I get out here and go across the fields . "
381449	381460	381462	381462	he	450	" I will go with you , if you permit , "
381468	381492	381464	381466	the good doctor	7140	" And while you pay your visit , I will saunter by a little brook that I think must run by your way . "
381493	381573	381579	381579	Leonard	450	" The Brent - you know that brook ? Ah , you should hear my poor patient talk of it , and of the hours he has spent angling in it , - you would not know whether to laugh or cry . The first day he was brought down to the place , he wanted to go out and try once more , he said , for his old deluding demon , - a one - eyed perch . "
381574	381577	381579	381579	Leonard	450	" Heavens ! "
381581	381589	381464	381466	the good doctor	7140	" are you speaking of John Burley ? "
381590	381604	381579	381579	Leonard	450	" To be sure , that is his name , - John Burley . "
381605	381678	381688	381689	the doctor	1651	" Oh , has it come to this ? Cure him , save him , if it be in human power . For the last two years I have sought his trace everywhere , and in vain , the moment I had money of my own , a home of my own . Poor , erring , glorious Burley ! Take me to him . Did you say there was no hope ? "
381679	381686	381688	381689	the doctor	1651	" I did not say that , "
381691	381768	381805	381805	Leonard	450	" But art can only assist Nature ; and though Nature is ever at work to repair the injuries we do to her , yet , when the coats of a stomach are all gone , she gets puzzled , and so do I. You must tell me another time how you came to know Burley , for here we are at the house , and I see him at the window looking out for me . "
381830	381835	382524	382524	Levy	1175	" Alas , poor Yorick !
382497	382509	382613	382613	Levy	1175	" the costly effects of the Right Hon . Audley Egerton . "
382618	382623	382678	382681	the stern firm man	11141	" to be helped , "
382684	382720	382788	382788	Egerton	500	" If not , I ask but to die in my harness , and that men may not know that I am a pauper until all that I need from my country is a grave . "
382766	382786	382788	382788	Egerton	500	" Beg the baron to wait , unless he would prefer to name his own hour to call again , "
382798	382809	382826	382826	Harley	503	" You can say I am now with Lord L'Estrange . "
382810	382824	382826	382826	Harley	503	" I had hoped you had done forever with that deluder of youth , "
382839	382881	382882	382882	EGERTON	500	" I remember that you saw too much of him in the gay time , ere wild oats are sown ; but now surely you can never need a loan ; and if so is not Harley L'Estrange by your side ? "
382885	382912	382913	382913	HARLEY	503	" My dear Harley ! doubtless he but comes to talk to me of some borough . He has much to do with those delicate negotiations . "
382916	383019	383020	383020	EGERTON	500	" And I have come on the same business . I claim the priority . I not only hear in the world , but I see by the papers , that Josiah Jenkins , Esq . , known to fame as an orator who leaves out his h 's , and young Lord Willoughby Whiggolin , who is just made a Lord of the Admiralty , because his health is too delicate for the army , are certain to come in for the city which you and your present colleague will as certainly vacate . That is true , is it not ? "
383023	383048	383131	383131	HARLEY	503	" My old Committee now vote for Jenkins and Whiggolin ; and I suppose there will not be even a contest . Go on . "
383049	383077	383083	383083	Egerton	500	" So my father and I are agreed that you must condescend , for the sake of old friendship , to be once more member for Lansmere . "
383078	383081	383090	383090	he	500	" Harley , "
383102	383109	383122	383122	L'Estrauge	1325	" Harley , no , no ! "
383110	383120	383131	383131	HARLEY	503	" No ! But why ? Wherefore such emotion ? "
383134	383290	383297	383297	Egerton	500	" I suggested the idea to two or three of the late ministers ; they all concur in advising you to accede . In the first place , if declining to stand for the place which tempted you from Lansmere , what more natural than that you should fall back on that earlier representation ? In the second place , Lansmere is neither a rotten borough to be bought , nor a close borough , under one man 's nomination . It is a tolerably large constituency . My father , it is true , has considerable interest in it , but only what is called the legitimate influence of property . At all events , it is more secure than a contest for a larger town , more dignified than a seat for a smaller . Hesitating still ? Even my mother entreats me to say how she desires you to renew that connection . "
383291	383294	383344	383344	His	500	" Harley , "
383323	383343	383349	383349	he	500	" Harley , if you could but read my heart at this moment , you would - you would - "
383370	383395	383349	383349	he	500	" Oh , Harley , if I ever lose your love , your friendship , nothing else is left to me in the world . "
383396	383428	383440	383440	Egerton	500	" Audley , my dear , dear Audley , is it you who speak to me thus ? You , my school friend , my life 's confidant , - you ? "
383429	383438	383440	383440	Egerton	500	" I am grown very weak and foolish , "
383446	383487	383542	383542	Egerton	500	" I do not know myself . I , too , whom you have so often called ' Stoic , ' and likened to the Iron Man in the poem which you used to read by the riverside at Eton . "
383488	383541	383602	383602	Harley	503	" But even then , my Audley , I knew that a warm human heart do what you would to keep it down beat strong under the iron ribs . And I often marvel now , to think you have gone through life so free from the wilder passions . Happier so ! "
383594	383600	383602	383602	Harley	503	" With regard to Peschiera , "
383604	383843	383851	383851	Egerton	500	" I think we must have overrated the danger we apprehended , and that his wagers were but an idle boast . He has remained quiet enough , and seems devoted to play . His sister has shut her doors both on myself and my young associate during the last few days . I almost fear that in spite of very sage warnings of mine , she must have turned his poet 's head , and that either he has met with some scornful rebuff to incautious admiration or that , he himself has grown aware of peril , and declines to face it ; for he is very much embarrassed when I speak to him respecting her . But if the count is not formidable , why , his sister is not needed ; and I hope yet to get justice for my Italian friend through the ordinary channels . I have secured an ally in a young Austrian prince , who is now in London , and who has promised to back , with all his influence , a memorial I shall transmit to Vienna . - a propos , my dear Audley , now that you have a little breathing - time , you must fix an hour for me to present to you my young poet , the son of her sister . At moments the expression of his face is so like hers . "
383844	383849	383851	383851	Egerton	500	" Ay , ay , "
383855	383904	383602	383602	Harley	503	" I will see him as you wish , but later . I have not yet that breathing - time you speak of ; but you say he has prospered ; and , with your friendship , he is secure from fortune . I rejoice to think so . "
383905	383931	383851	383851	Egerton	500	" And your own protege , this Vandal Leslie , whom you forbid me to dislike - hard task ! - what has he decided ? "
383932	383975	383602	383602	Harley	503	" To adhere to my fate . Harley , if it please Heaven that I do not live to return to power , and provide adequately for that young man , do not forget that he clung to me in my fall . "
383976	384023	384029	384029	Audley	500	" If he still cling to you faithfully , I will never forget it . I will forget only all that now makes me doubt him . But you talk of not living , Audley ! Pooh ! your frame is that of a predestined octogenarian . "
384024	384027	384029	384029	Audley	500	" Nay , "
384031	384060	383602	383602	Harley	503	" I was but uttering one of those vague generalities which are common upon all mortal lips . And now farewell , - I must see this baron . "
384061	384121	384029	384029	Audley	500	" Not yet , until you have promised to consent to my proposal , and be once more member for Lansmere . Tut ! do n't shake your head . I can not be denied . I claim your promise in right of our friendship , and shall be seriously hurt if you even pause to reflect on it . "
384122	384192	383602	383602	Harley	503	" Well , well , I know not how to refuse you , Harley ; but you have not been to Lansmere yourself since - since that sad event . You must not revive the old wound , - you must not go ; and - and , I own it , Harley , the remembrance of it pains even me . I would rather not go to Lansmere . "
384193	384241	384256	384256	Egerton	500	" Ah , my friend , this is an excess of sympathy , and I can not listen to it . I begin even to blame my own weakness , and to feel that we have no right to make ourselves the soft slaves of the past . "
384242	384254	384256	384256	Egerton	500	" You do appear to me of late to have changed , "
384266	384298	384309	384309	L'Estrange	503	" Do tell me that you are happy in the contemplation of your new ties , - that I shall live to see you once more restored to your former self . "
384299	384307	384309	384309	L'Estrange	503	" All I can answer , Audley , "
384316	384359	384418	384418	He	500	" is , that you are right in one thing , - I am changed ; and I am struggling to gain strength for duty and for honour . Adieu ! I shall tell my father that you accede to our wishes . "
384394	384417	384496	384496	Egerton	500	" To go back to that place - there - there - where - Courage , courage ! what is another pang ? "
384482	384494	384520	384520	He	500	" Now to gain time , and to baffle the usurer , "
384529	384536	384520	384520	He	500	" Is Baron Levy still waiting ? "
384537	384542	384548	384548	Levy	1175	" Yes , sir . "
384543	384547	384561	384564	the ex - minister	11125	" Admit him . "
384551	384559	384561	384564	the ex - minister	11125	" I beg your pardon , Levy , "
384566	384581	384589	384590	the baron	17518	" for having so long detained you . I am now at your commands . "
384582	384587	384589	384590	the baron	17518	" My dear fellow , "
384592	384622	384623	384623	EGERTON	500	" no apologies between friends so old as we are ; and I fear that my business is not so agreeable as to make you impatient to discuss it . "
384629	384654	384655	384656	THE BARON	1175	" I am to conclude , then , that you wish to bring our accounts to a close . Whenever you will , Levy . "
384662	384691	384692	384692	EGERTON	500	" Peste ! mon cher , you take things coolly . But if our accounts are closed , I fear you will have but little to live upon . "
384695	384709	384710	384710	BARON	1175	" I can continue to live on the salary of a Cabinet Minister . "
384713	384725	384726	384726	EGERTON	500	" Possibly ; but you are no longer a Cabinet Minister . "
384729	384836	384837	384838	THE BARON	17518	" You have never found me deceived - in a political prediction . Within twelve months should life be spared to me I shall be in office again . If the same to you , I would rather wait till then formally and amicably to resign to you my lands and this house . If you grant that reprieve , our connection can thus close without the eclat and noise which may be invidious to you , as it would be disagreeable to me . But if that delay be inconvenient , I will appoint a lawyer to examine your accounts , and adjust my liabilities . "
384842	384857	384858	384858	EGERTON	500	" I do n't like this . A lawyer ! That may be awkward . "
384870	384880	384881	384882	THE BARON	1175	" Well , Levy , how shall it be ? "
384885	384993	384994	384994	EGERTON	500	" You know , my dear fellow , it is not my character to be hard on any one , least of all upon an old friend . And if you really think there is a chance of your return to office , which you apprehend that an esclandre as to your affairs at present might damage , why , let us see if we can conciliate matters . But , first , mon cher , in order to become a minister , you must at least have a seat in parliament ; and pardon me the question , how the deuce are you to find one ? "
384997	385002	385003	385004	THE BARON	17518	" It is found . "
385007	385018	385019	385019	EGERTON	500	" Ah , I forgot the L5,000 you last borrowed . "
385022	385033	385034	385035	THE BARON	1175	" NO ; I reserve that sum for another purpose . "
385042	385055	385056	385056	EGERTON	500	" Perhaps to defend yourself against the actions you apprehend from me ? "
385059	385197	385198	385199	THE BARON	1175	" You are mistaken . But to soothe your suspicions I will tell you plainly , that finding any sum I might have insured on my life would be liable to debts preincurred , and as you will be my sole creditor might thus at my death pass back to you ; and doubting whether , indeed , any office would accept my insurance , I appropriate that sum to the relief of my conscience . I intend to bestow it , while yet in life , upon my late wife 's kinsman , Randal Leslie . And it is solely the wish to do what I consider an act of justice , that has prevailed with me to accept a favour from the hands of Harley L'Estrange , and to become again the member for Lansmere . "
385202	385214	385215	385215	EGERTON	500	" Ha ! - Lansmere ! You will stand for Lansmere ? "
385219	385226	385227	385228	THE BARON	1175	" I propose to do so . "
385231	385253	385254	385254	EGERTON	500	" I believe you will be opposed , subjected to even a sharp contest . Perhaps you may lose your election . "
385257	385273	385274	385275	THE BARON	1175	" If so , I resign myself , and you can foreclose on my estates . "
385281	385298	385299	385299	EGERTON	500	" Look you , Egerton , I shall be too happy to do you a favour . "
385304	385394	385395	385396	THE BARON	17518	" Favour ! No , Baron Levy , I ask from you no favour . Dismiss all thought of rendering me one . It is but a consideration of business on both sides . If you think it better that we shall at once settle our accounts , my lawyer shall investigate them . If you agree to the delay I request , my lawyer shall give you no trouble ; and all that I have , except hope and character , pass to your hands without a struggle . "
385399	385461	385462	385462	EGERTON	500	" Inflexible and ungracious , favour or not - put it as you will - I accede , provided , first , that you allow me to draw up a fresh deed , which will accomplish your part of the compact ; and secondly , that we saddle the proposed delay with the condition that you do not lose your election . "
385465	385475	385476	385477	THE BARON	17518	" Agreed . Have you anything further to say ? "
385480	385499	385500	385500	EGERTON	500	" Nothing , except that , if you require more money , I am still at your service . "
385503	385561	385580	385581	the baron	17518	" I thank you . No ; I shall take the occasion of my retirement from office to reduce my establishment . I have calculated already , and provided for the expenditure I need , up to the date I have specified , and I shall have no occasion to touch the L5,000 that I still retain . "
385562	385578	385580	385581	the baron	17518	" Your young friend , Mr. Leslie , ought to be very grateful to you , "
385585	385613	385614	385614	EGERTON	500	" I have met him in the world , - a lad of much promise and talent . You should try and get him also into parliament . "
385618	385654	385655	385656	THE BARON	1175	" You are a good judge of the practical abilities and merits of men , as regards worldly success . Do you really think Randal Leslie calculated for public life - for a parliamentary career ? "
385659	385664	385665	385665	EGERTON	500	" Indeed I do . "
385674	385718	385719	385720	THE BARON	1175	" Parliament without fortune , - ' t is a sharp trial ; still he is prudent , abstemious , energetic , persevering ; and at the onset , under my auspices and advice , he might establish a position beyond his years . "
385722	385781	385782	385782	EGERTON	500	" It strikes me that we might possibly get him into the next parliament ; or , as that is not likely to last long , at all events , into the parliament to follow , - not for one of the boroughs which will be swept away , but for a permanent seat , and without expense . "
385785	385792	385793	385794	THE BARON	17518	" Ay , - and how ? "
385797	385839	386414	386414	VIOLANTE	1264	" Give me a few days to consider . An idea has occurred to me . I will call again if I find it practicable . Good - day to you , Egerton , and success to your election for Lansmere . "
386417	386439	386440	386440	HELEN	894	" But why will you not tell me more of that early time ? You are less communicative even than Leonard . "
386448	386476	386494	386494	VIOLANTE	1264	" Indeed there is nothing to tell you that you do not know ; and it is so long since , and things are so changed now . "
386499	386573	386574	386574	HELEN	894	" How I envy you that past which you treat so lightly ! To have been something , even in childhood , to the formation of a noble nature ; to have borne on those slight shoulders half the load of a man 's grand labour ; and now to see Genius moving calm in its clear career ; and to say inly , ' Of that genius I am a part ! ' "
386580	386597	386598	386598	VIOLANTE	1264	" A part ! Oh , no ! A part ? I do n't understand you . "
386601	386654	386673	386673	VIOLANTE	1264	" Take the child Beatrice from Dante 's life , and should we have a Dante ? What is a poet 's genius but the voice of its emotions ? All things in life and in Nature influence genius ; but what influences it the most are its own sorrows and affections . "
386677	386720	386721	386721	She	894	" Yes , Helen , yes , - I know by my own heart how to read yours . Such memories are ineffaceable . Few guess what strange self - weavers of our own destinies we women are in our veriest childhood ! "
386729	386753	386754	386754	HELEN	894	" How could Leonard fail to be dear to you , - dear as you to him , - dearer than all others ? "
386763	386805	386834	386834	VIOLANTE	1264	" Hush , hush ! you must not speak to me thus ; it is wicked , - I can not bear it . I would not have it be so ; it must not be , - it can not ! "
386844	386880	386881	386881	HELEN	894	" How have I wounded you , - how offended ? Forgive me , but why is this wicked ? Why must it not be ? Is it because he is below you in birth ? "
386884	387008	387016	387016	Violante	1264	" No , no , - I never thought of that . And what am I ? Do n't ask me , - I can not answer . You are wrong , quite wrong as to me . I can only look on Leonard as - as a brother . But - but , you can speak to him more freely than I can . I would not have him waste his heart on me , nor yet think me unkind and distant , as I seem . I know not what I say . But - but - break to him - indirectly - gently - that duty in both forbids us both to - to be more than friends - than - "
387009	387014	387016	387016	Violante	1264	" Helen , Helen ! "
387025	387070	387071	387071	HELEN	894	" your heart betrays you in every word you say . You weep ; lean on me , whisper to me ; why - why is this ? Do you fear that your guardian would not consent ? He not consent ? He who - "
387074	387081	387082	387082	VIOLANTE	1264	" Cease - cease - cease ! "
387085	387104	387105	387105	HELEN	894	" What ! You can fear Harley - Lord L'Estrange ? Fie ; you do not know him . "
387110	387121	387165	387165	She	894	" Violante , hold ; I am engaged to another . "
387179	387203	387222	387222	Helen	894	" Another ! Engaged to another ! One word , Helen , - not to him - not to - Harley - to - "
387204	387219	387490	387490	She	19649	" I can not say , - I must not . I have promised , "
387497	387514	387663	387663	we	11207	" He is identified with my love , my hopes , my home , my future . "
387668	387692	387663	387663	we	11207	" All is over ; no matter what else changes , that which I have made my all is gone evermore - evermore ! "
387703	387708	387782	387782	he	3526	" Evermore - evermore ! "
387777	387780	387782	387782	he	3526	" For , "
387784	387808	387782	387782	he	3526	" I come to suggest to the daughter the means by which she can restore to her father his country and his honours . "
387812	387814	387879	387879	She	19649	" father "
387863	387878	387936	387936	she	19649	" There , at least , is a love that has never deceived thee ! "
387931	387935	387936	387936	she	19649	" My father ! "
387945	387962	387963	387963	Peschiera	1132	" What of him ? And who are you , signor ? I know you not . "
387986	388000	388012	388012	he	11213	" Suffer me to explain , and listen to me while I speak . "
388022	388033	388012	388012	he	11213	" Doubtless you have heard of the Count di Peschiera ? "
388037	388095	388096	388096	PESCHTERA	1328	" I heard that name , as a child , when in Italy . And when she with whom I then dwelt my father 's aunt fell ill and died , I was told that my home in Italy was gone , that it had passed to the Count di Peschiera , - my father 's foe ! "
388099	388116	388117	388117	VIOLANTE	1264	" And your father , since then , has taught you to hate this fancied foe ? "
388120	388135	388136	388136	PESCHIERA	1132	" Nay , my father did but forbid me ever to breathe his name . "
388139	388287	388288	388288	VIOLANTE	1264	" Alas ! what years of suffering and exile might have been saved your father , had he but been more just to his early friend and kinsman , - nay , had he but less cruelly concealed the secret of his retreat . Fair child , I am that Giulio Franzini , that Count di Peschiera . I am the man you have been told to regard as your father 's foe . I am the man on whom the Austrian Emperor bestowed his lands . And now judge if I am , in truth , the foe . I have come hither to seek your father , in order to dispossess myself of my sovereign 's gift . I have come but with one desire , - to restore Alphonso to his native land , and to surrender the heritage that was forced upon me . "
388291	388345	388346	388346	PESCHIERA	1132	" My father , my dear father ! His grand heart will have room once more . Oh , this is noble enmity , true revenge ! I understand it , signor , and so will my father , for such would have been his revenge on you . You have seen him ? "
388349	388383	388384	388384	VIOLANTE	1264	" No , not yet . I would not see him till I had seen yourself ; for you , in truth , are the arbiter of his destinies , as of mine . "
388387	388405	388406	388406	PESCHIERA	1132	" I , Count ? I - arbiter of my father 's destinies ? Is it possible ? "
388424	388654	389037	389038	the count	18827	" How lovely is that innocent joy ! But do not indulge it yet . Perhaps it is a sacrifice which is asked from you , - a sacrifice too hard to bear . Do not interrupt me . Listen still , and you will see why I could not speak to your father until I had obtained an interview with yourself . See why a word from you may continue still to banish me from his presence . You know , doubtless , that your father was one of the chiefs of a party that sought to free Northern Italy from the Austrians . I myself was at the onset a warm participator in that scheme . In a sudden moment I discovered that some of its more active projectors had coupled with a patriotic enterprise plots of a dark nature , and that the conspiracy itself was about to be betrayed to the government . I wished to consult with your father ; but he was at a distance . I learned that his life was condemned . Not an hour was to be lost . I took a bold resolve , that has exposed me to his suspicions and to my country 's wrath . But my main idea was to save him , my early friend , from death , and my country from fruitless massacre .
388655	389035	389037	389038	the count	18827	" I withdrew from the intended revolt . I sought at once the head of the Austrian government in Italy , and made terms for the lives of Alphonso and of the other more illustrious chiefs , which otherwise would have been forfeited . I obtained permission to undertake myself the charge of securing my kinsman in order to place him in safety , and to conduct him to a foreign land , in an exile that would cease when the danger was dispelled . But unhappily he deemed that I only sought to destroy him . He fled from my friendly pursuit . The soldiers with me were attacked by an intermeddling Englishman ; your father escaped from Italy , concealing his retreat ; and the character of his flight counteracted my efforts to obtain his pardon . The government conferred on me half his revenues , holding the other half at its pleasure . I accepted the offer in order to save his whole heritage from confiscation . That I did not convey to him what I pined to do , - namely , the information that I held but in trust what was bestowed by the government , and the full explanation of what seemed blamable in my conduct , - was necessarily owing to the secrecy he maintained . I could not discover his refuge ; but I never ceased to plead for his recall . This year only I have partially succeeded . He can be restored to his heritage and rank , on one proviso , - a guarantee for his loyalty . That guarantee the government has named : it is the alliance of his only child with one whom the government can trust . It was the interest of all the Italian nobility that the representation of a House so great falling to a female should not pass away wholly from the direct line , - in a word , that you should ally yourself with a kinsman . But one kinsman , and he the next in blood , presented himself . In short , Alphonso regains all that he lost on the day in which his daughter gives her hand to Giulio Franzini , Count di Peschiera . Ah , "
389042	389171	389391	389391	she	11218	" you shriek , you recoil . He thus submitted to your choice is indeed unworthy of you . You are scarce in the spring of life , he is in its waning autumn . Youth loves youth . He does not aspire to your love . All that he can say is , love is not the only joy of the heart , - it is joy to raise from ruin a beloved father ; joy to restore , to a land poor in all but memories , a chief in whom it reverences a line of heroes . These are the joys I offer to you , - you , a daughter , and an Italian maid . Still silent ? Oh , speak to me ! "
389396	389419	389425	389425	Peschiera	1132	" If it be as you say , it is not for me to answer you ; it is for my father . "
389420	389423	389425	389425	Peschiera	1132	" Nay , "
389427	389652	389805	389805	he	18827	" Pardon , if I contradict you . Do you know so little of your father as to suppose that he will suffer his interest to dictate to his pride ? He would refuse , perhaps , even to receive my visit , to hear my explanations ; but certainly he would refuse to buy back his inheritance by the sacrifice of his daughter to one whom he has deemed his foe , and whom the mere disparity of years would incline the world to say he had made the barter of his personal ambition . But if I could go to him sanctioned by you ; if I could say , ' Your daughter overlooks what the father might deem an obstacle , - she has consented to accept my hand of her own free choice , she unites her happiness , and blends her prayers with mine , ' - then , indeed , I could not fail of success ; and Italy would pardon my errors , and bless your name . Ah , Signorina , do not think of me save as an instrument towards the fulfilment of duties so high and sacred ! think but of your ancestors , your father , your native land , and reject not the proud occasion to prove how you revere them all ! "
389796	389804	389805	389805	he	18827	" I must not be seen here , "
389808	389860	390005	390005	he	503	" but to - morrow , in these gardens , about this hour . I implore you , for the sake of your father , - his hopes , fortunes , his very life , - to guard the secret of this interview , - to meet me again . Adieu ! "
389994	390003	390005	390005	he	503	" Under what strange taboo am I placed ? "
390019	390074	390091	390091	Violante	800	" I inquire for Helen , - she is ill , and can not see me . I come to sun myself in your presence , and you fly me as if gods and men had set their mark on my brow . Child ! child ! what is this ? You are weeping ? "
390075	390089	390141	390141	Harley	503	" Do not stay me now , - do not speak to me , "
390110	390139	390198	390198	she	800	" Have you a grief , and under the shelter of my father 's roof , - a grief that you will not tell to me ? Cruel ! "
390204	390292	390336	390336	He	503	" Noble friend , forgive me . I have no grief , believe me , which - which I can tell to you . I was but thinking of my poor father when you came up ; alarming myself about him , it may be , with vain , superstitious fears ; and so - even a slight surprise - your abrupt appearance has sufficed to make me thus weak and foolish ; but I wish to see my father ! - to go home - home ! "
390293	390322	390198	390198	she	800	" Your father is well , believe me , and pleased that you are here . No danger threatens him ; and you , here , are safe . "
390323	390331	390369	390369	he	503	" I safe - and from what ? "
390364	390368	390369	390369	he	503	" Give me , "
390372	390433	390442	390442	Harley	503	" time to reflect , and to obtain permission to intrust you with a secret which , in my judgment , you should know . Meanwhile , this much I may say , that rather than you should incur the danger that I believe he exaggerates , your father would have given you a protector - even in Randal Leslie . "
390437	390440	390459	390459	himself	503	" But , "
390461	390506	390610	390610	he	11240	" but I trust you are reserved for a fairer fate , and a nobler spouse . I have vowed to live henceforth in the common workday world . But for you , bright child , for you , I am a dreamer still ! "
390603	390608	390610	390610	he	11240	" My dear Helen , "
390612	390660	390670	390670	Helen	894	" you have consented to be my wife , my life 's mild companion ; let it be soon - soon - for I need you . I need all the strength of that holy tie . Helen , let me press you to fix the time . "
390661	390668	390688	390688	she	894	" I owe you too much , "
390675	390687	390688	390688	she	894	" to have any will but yours . But your mother , "
390701	390708	390610	390610	he	11240	" your mother has not yet - "
390709	390752	390688	390688	she	894	" My mother - true . I will speak first to her . You shall receive from my family all honour due to your gentle virtues . Helen , by the way , have you mentioned to Violante the bond between us ? "
390753	390779	390610	390610	he	11240	" No ; that is , I fear I may have unguardedly betrayed it , against Lady Lansmere 's commands too - but - but - "
390780	390854	390918	390918	Levy	1175	" So , Lady Lansmere forbade you to name it to Violante ? This should not be . I will answer for her permission to revoke that interdict . It is due to Violante and to you . Tell your young friend all . Ah , Helen , if I am at times cold or wayward , bear with me - bear with me ; for you love me , do you not ? "
390913	390916	390918	390918	Levy	1175	" Therefore , "
390920	390937	390943	390943	Randal	1264	" I trust I may very soon congratulate you on the acquisition of your family estates . "
390938	390941	390965	390965	her	1130	" Strange ! "
390971	390984	390918	390918	Levy	1175	" He looked up at the clock as he spoke , and added ,
390985	390998	390965	390965	her	1130	" Frank by this time has told his father of his engagement . "
390999	391014	390918	390918	Levy	1175	" And you feel sure that the squire can not be coaxed into consent ? "
391015	391080	390965	390965	her	1130	" No ; but I feel sure that the squire will be so choleric at the first intelligence , that Frank will not have the self - control necessary for coaxing ; and , perhaps , before the squire can relent upon this point , he may , by some accident , learn his grievances on another , which would exasperate him still more . "
391081	391093	391104	391104	Levy	1175	" Ay , I understand , - the post - obit ? "
391097	391102	390918	390918	Levy	1175	" And what then ? "
391106	391121	391122	391123	The baron	17518	" The next of kin to the lands of Hazeldean may have his day . "
391126	391164	391225	391225	he	570	" You have good prospects in that direction , Leslie ; look now to another . I spoke to you of the borough of Lansmere . Your patron , Audley Egerton , intends to stand for it . "
391221	391224	391271	391271	himself	17982	" So , "
391274	391274	391280	391280	Levy	1175	"
391275	391278	391280	391280	Levy	1175	" No ! "
391282	391307	391271	391271	himself	17982	" not robs you ; we may prevent that . The Lansmere interest is not so strong in the borough as Dick Avenel 's . "
391308	391317	391280	391280	Levy	1175	" But I can not stand against Egerton . "
391318	391329	391271	391271	himself	17982	" Assuredly not , - you may stand with him . "
391330	391333	391280	391280	Levy	1175	" How ? "
391334	391368	391401	391401	he	570	" Dick Avenel will never suffer Egerton to come in ; and though he can not , perhaps , carry two of his own politics , he can split his votes upon you . "
391397	391400	391401	391401	he	570	" But , "
391404	391447	391369	391369	Randal	570	" Egerton has not spoken to me on such a subject ; nor can you expect that he would propose to me to stand with him , if he foresaw the chance of being ousted by the very candidate he himself introduced . "
391448	391475	391485	391485	Randal	570	" Neither he nor his party will anticipate that possibility . If he ask you , agree to stand , - leave the rest to me . "
391476	391483	391485	391485	Randal	570	" You must hate Egerton bitterly , "
391487	391507	391520	391520	Levy	1175	" for I am not vain enough to think that you thus scheme but from pure love to me . "
391508	391518	391520	391520	Levy	1175	" The motives of men are intricate and complicated , "
391526	391545	392081	392081	he	1498	" It suffices to the wise to profit by the actions , and leave the motives in shade . "
392072	392079	392081	392081	he	1498	" Oho ! Mr. young Leslie , "
392093	392116	392127	392128	the parson	1499	" I thought you were a friend , - I thought you were Frank 's adviser . Explain , sir ! explain ! "
392117	392125	392127	392128	the parson	1499	" Gently , my dear Mr. Hazeldean , "
392130	392150	392151	392151	SQUIRE	447	" You do but surprise and alarm Mr. Leslie . Tell him more distinctly what he has to explain . "
392154	392175	392176	392176	RANDAL	570	" Did you or did you not tell me or Mrs. Hazeldean that Frank was in love with Violante Rickeybockey ? "
392182	392276	392479	392479	he	11283	" I ! Never , sir ! I feared , on the contrary , that he was somewhat enamoured of a very different person . I hinted at that possibility . I could not do more , for I did not know how far Frank 's affections were seriously engaged . And indeed , sir , Mrs. Hazeldean , though not encouraging the idea that your son could marry a foreigner and a Roman Catholic , did not appear to consider such objections insuperable , if Frank 's happiness were really at stake . "
392520	392540	392557	392557	Randal	570	" Well , well , I wronged you ; beg your pardon . What now is to be done ? "
392541	392555	392557	392557	Randal	570	" Why , you can not consent to this marriage , - impossible ! "
392559	392576	392584	392585	the squire	1498	" and we must hope , therefore , to influence Frank by his sense of duty . "
392577	392582	392584	392585	the squire	1498	" That 's it , "
392587	392645	392651	392652	the parson	1499	" for I 'll not give way . Pretty pass things have come to , indeed ! A widow , too , I hear . Artful jade ! thought , no doubt , to catch a Hazeldean of Hazeldean . My estates go to an outlandish Papistical set of mongrel brats ! No , no , never ! "
392646	392649	392651	392652	the parson	1499	" But , "
392656	392685	392691	392691	Randal	570	" perhaps we may be unjustly prejudiced against this lady . We should have consented to Violante ; why not to her ? She is of good family ? "
392686	392689	392651	392652	the parson	1499	" Certainly , "
392693	392698	392723	392723	he	1498	" And good character ? "
392716	392721	392707	392708	The squire	1498	" Answer the parson ! "
392727	392798	392805	392806	the squire	1498	" Indeed , sir , I can not speak disrespectfully of the character of a woman , - who may , too , become Frank 's wife ; and the world is ill - natured and not to be believed . But you can judge for yourself , my dear Mr. Hazeldean . Ask your brother whether Madame di Negra is one whom he would advise his nephew to marry . "
392799	392803	392805	392806	the squire	1498	" My brother ! "
392810	392823	392836	392836	Randal	570	" Consult my distant brother on the affairs of my own son ? "
392824	392833	392847	392848	the parson	1499	" He is a man of the world , "
392838	392845	392847	392848	the parson	1499	" And of feeling and honour , "
392850	392881	392887	392887	Randal	570	" and , perhaps , through him , we may be enabled to enlighten Frank , and save him from what appears to be the snare of an artful woman . "
392882	392885	392887	392887	Randal	570	" Meanwhile , "
392889	392917	392926	392927	the parson	1499	" I will seek Frank , and do my best with him . Let me go now , - I will return in an hour or so . "
392918	392924	392926	392927	the parson	1499	" I will accompany you , "
392929	392959	392967	392968	the squire	1498	" Nay , pardon me , but I think we two young men can talk more openly without a third person , even so wise and kind as you . "
392960	392965	393029	393030	Mr. Hazeldean	449	" Let Randal go , "
393010	393027	393029	393030	Mr. Hazeldean	449	" I was too impatient to stay at home and listen to the parson 's prosing , "
393034	393065	393090	393090	he	570	" I have shaken Dale off . Tell me what has passed . Oh , do n't fear , - I 'm a man , and can bear the worst . "
393083	393088	393090	393090	he	570	" My dear sir , "
393094	393173	393183	393184	the squire	1498	" this is very confidential what I am about to say . I must repeat it to you , because , without such confidence , I see not how to advise you on the proper course to take . But if I betray Frank , it is for his good , and to his own father ; - only do not tell him . He would never forgive me ; it would forever destroy my influence over him . "
393174	393181	393190	393190	I	0	" Go on , go on , "
393205	393205	393211	393211	Randal	570	"
393206	393209	393211	393211	Randal	570	" Then , "
393213	393242	393190	393190	I	0	" the secret of his entanglement with Madame di Negra is simply this : he found her in debt - nay , on the point of being arrested - "
393243	393250	393211	393211	Randal	570	" Debt ! arrested ! Jezebel ! "
393251	393301	393326	393326	he	1498	" And in paying the debt himself , and saving her from arrest , he conferred on her the obligation which no woman of honour could accept save from an affianced husband . Poor Frank ! - if sadly taken in , still we must pity and forgive him ! "
393318	393325	393326	393326	he	1498	" I see , I see ! "
393333	393472	393532	393532	He	449	" I have it , I have it ! ' T is an affair of money ! I can buy her off . If she took money from him - the mercenary , painted baggage I - why , then , she 'll take it from me . I do n't care what if costs - half my fortune - all ! I 'd be content never to see Hazeldean Hall again , if I could save my son , my own son , from disgrace and misery ; for miserable he will be , when he knows he has broken my heart and his mother 's . And for a creature like that ! My boy , a thousand hearty thanks to you . Where does the wench live ? I 'll go to her at once . "
393543	393576	393588	393588	he	570	" Do n't waste your breath ! I 've settled it ; and if you do n't tell me where she lives , ' t is easily found out , I suppose . "
393582	393586	393588	393588	he	570	" After all , "
393590	393621	393703	393703	he	570	" why not ? He will be sure so to speak as to enlist her pride against himself , and to irritate Frank to the utmost . Let him go . "
393677	393702	393756	393756	Randal	570	" that he knew how to settle matters , without saying why or wherefore , as long as he opened his purse wide enough , "
393749	393754	393756	393756	Randal	570	" Excellent good man , "
393758	393779	393788	393789	the squire	1498	" but not with sufficient knowledge of the world for affairs of this kind , which you understand so well . "
393780	393786	393788	393789	the squire	1498	" I should think so , "
393800	393821	393874	393875	John Burley	1026	" And the parson is as soft as buttermilk . We must be firm here , - firm , sir . "
393866	393872	393874	393875	John Burley	1026	" Bring the light nearer , "
393878	393882	393916	393917	Horace Walpole	472	" nearer still . "
393920	393931	393967	393967	he	1026	" his stomach would survive all the rest of him . "
393957	393965	393946	393946	He	1026	" It lives ever in the air ! "
393969	393974	393984	393984	He	1026	" What lives ever ? "
393980	393983	394225	394225	He	450	" Light ! "
393996	394224	394312	394312	he	450	" In the fixed star , in the Will - o'-the - wisp , in the great sun that illumines half a world , or the farthing rushlight by which the ragged student strains his eyes , - still the same flower of the elements ! Light in the universe , thought in the soul - Ay , ay , go on with the simile . My head swims . Extinguish the light ! You can not ; fool , it vanishes from your eye , but it is still in the space . Worlds must perish , suns shrivel up , matter and spirit both fall into nothingness , before the combinations whose union makes that little flame which the breath of a babe can restore to darkness , shall lose the power to form themselves into light once more . Lose the power ! - no , the necessity : it is the one Must in creation . Ay , ay , very dark riddles grow clear now , - now when I could not cast up an addition sum in the baker 's bill ! What wise man denied that two and two made four ? Do they not make four ? I ca n't answer him . But I could answer a question that some wise men have contrived to make much knottier . "
394298	394311	394312	394312	he	450	" I feared I might have ruined you by my bad example , "
394327	394334	394324	394324	he	450	" That idea preyed on me . "
394335	394346	394358	394358	Burley	1026	" No , no ; you did me great good . "
394347	394356	394358	394358	Burley	1026	" Say that , - say it often , "
394362	394371	394659	394659	he	1026	" it makes my heart feel so light . "
394653	394658	394659	394659	he	1026	" I once beheld , "
394662	394746	394788	394788	he	1026	" a ship in a storm . It was a cloudy , fitful day , and I could see the ship with all its masts fighting bard for life and for death . Then came night , dark as pitch , and I could only guess that the ship fought on . Towards the dawn the stars grew visible , and once more I saw the ship : it was a wreck , - it went down just as the stars shone forth . "
394783	394786	394788	394788	he	1026	" Good , "
394793	394866	395094	395094	he	1026	" these hands were too large and rude for handling the delicate webs of my own mechanism , and these strong limbs ran away with me . If I had been a sickly , puny fellow , perhaps my mind would have had fair play . There was too much of brute body here ! Look at this hand now ! You can see the light through it ! Good , good ! "
395076	395092	395094	395094	he	1026	" I have been making a romance , to amuse myself , from their contents , "
395096	395332	395481	395481	he	1026	" They maybe of use to you , brother author . I have told Mrs. Goodyer to place them in your room . Amongst those papers is a sort of journal , - a woman 's journal ; it moved me greatly . A man gets into another world , strange to him as the orb of Sirius , if he can transport himself into the centre of a woman 's heart , and see the life there , so wholly unlike our own . Things of moment to us , to it so trivial ; things trifling to us , to it so vast . There was this journal , in its dates reminding me of stormy events in my own existence , and grand doings in the world 's . And those dates there , chronicling but the mysterious , unrevealed record of some obscure , loving heart ! And in that chronicle , O Sir Poet , there was as much genius , vigour of thought , vitality of being , poured and wasted , as ever kind friend will say was lavished on the rude outer world by big John Burley ! Genius , genius ! are we all alike , then , save when we leash ourselves to some matter - of - fact material , and float over the roaring seas on a wooden plank or a herring tub ? "
395472	395479	395521	395521	He	1026	" I do not need them , "
395488	395520	395569	395569	he	1026	" I am better now . I and that pleasant light understand one another , and I believe all it tells me . Pooh , pooh , I do not rave . "
395561	395567	395569	395569	he	1026	" Peace , old fool , "
395573	395673	395731	395731	he	1026	" You shall tell anglers hereafter how John Burley came to fish for the one - eyed perch which he never caught ; and how , when he gave it up at the last , his baits all gone , and the line broken amongst the weeds , you comforted the baffled man . There are many good fellows yet in the world who will like to know that poor Burley did not die on a dunghill . Kiss me . Come , boy , you too . Now , God bless you , I should like to sleep . "
395726	395730	395731	395731	he	1026	" Not that , "
395735	395741	395769	395769	Goethe	752	" light to the last ! "
395779	395783	395879	395889	a sufferer , who did not then seem in immediate danger	11346	" More Light ; "
395868	395874	395914	395914	he	1026	" that it is growing dark "
395918	395923	395991	395991	she	2774	" No worse sign . "
395982	395989	395991	395991	she	2774	" You are young , sir , "
395996	396016	396027	396027	Leonard	450	" and the young want sleep . Lie down a bit : I will call you when he wakes . "
396017	396025	396027	396027	Leonard	450	" No , I could not sleep , "
396029	396036	396041	396041	her	2774	" I will watch for you . "
396044	396078	396095	396095	Leonard	450	" I must see the last of him , sir ; but I know he will be angry when his eyes open on me , for he has grown very thoughtful of others . "
396079	396093	396143	396143	he	450	" Ah , if he had but been , as thoughtful of himself ! "
396136	396141	396147	396149	The old woman	2774	" What is that ? "
396159	396247	396352	396352	she	6000	" Ah , sir , he bade me place these papers here . He thought they might keep you from fretting about him , in case you would sit up and wake . And he had a thought of me , too ; for I have so pined to find out the poor young lady , who left them years ago . She was almost as dear to me as he is ; dearer perhaps until now - when - when I am about to lose him ! "
396277	396351	396272	396273	The hostess	6000	" Perhaps she is gone to heaven before him ; she did not look like one long for this world . She left us so suddenly . Many things of hers besides these papers are still , here ; but I keep them aired and dusted , and strew lavender over them , in case she ever come for them again . You never heard tell of her , did you , sir ? "
396365	396372	396272	396273	The hostess	6000	" Of her - of whom ? "
396373	396390	396410	396410	he	450	" Did not Mr. John tell you her name - dear , dear ; Mrs. Bertram . "
396406	396409	396410	396410	he	450	" Bertram ! "
396413	396418	396272	396273	The hostess	6000	" Are you sure ? "
396419	396504	396410	396410	he	450	" Oh , yes , sir ! And many years after she had left us , and we had heard no more of her , there came a packet addressed to her here , from over sea , sir . We took it in , and kept it , and John would break the seal , to know if it would tell us anything about her ; but it was all in a foreign language like , - we could not read a word . "
396505	396543	396592	396592	he	5338	" Have you the packet ? Pray show it to me . It may be of the greatest value . To - morrow will do - I can not think of that just now . Poor Burley ! "
396588	396591	396615	396615	He	5338	" Light , "
396595	396614	396694	396694	he	450	" How often ' Light ' is the last word of those round whom the shades are gathering ! "
396690	396693	396694	396694	he	450	" And , "
396698	396839	397560	397560	father	16807	" and does this large erring nature , marred by its genial faults , this soul which should have filled a land , as yon orb the room , with a light that linked earth to heaven - does it pass away into the dark , and leave not a ray behind ? Nay , if the elements of light are ever in the space , and when the flame goes out , return to the vital air , so thought once kindled lives forever around and about us , a part of our breathing atmosphere . Many a thinker , many a poet , may yet illumine the world , from the thoughts which yon genius , that will have no name , gave forth to wander through air , and recombine again in some new form of light . "
397575	397602	397613	397613	he	8282	" Come away this instant , sir ! Come with me , or before the day is over , I strike you out of my will ! "
397621	397629	397649	397650	the squire	1498	" Forgive him ; forgive us both - "
397630	397647	397613	397613	he	8282	" What ! you prefer that stranger to me , - to the inheritance of Hazeldean ! "
397656	397675	397914	397915	the squire	1498	" Leave your estates to whom you will ; all that I care for in life is here ! "
397905	397909	397972	397973	the squire	1498	" distant brother 's "
397965	397970	398009	398010	the squire	1498	" Ay , ay , "
397975	398007	398029	398030	William Hazeldean	498	" this is true relationship ! - my child prefers a stranger to me ; why should I complain that I am a stranger in a brother 's house ? Sir , "
398032	398032	398471	398471	he	500	"
398466	398469	398471	398471	he	500	" William , "
398479	398515	398560	398560	he	1498	" this is kind . You are come to see me , now that men say that I am fallen . The minister you censured is no more ; and you see again the brother . "
398563	398606	398560	398560	he	1498	" No , no , Audley ; I am more selfish than you think me . I have come - I have come to ask your advice , - no , not exactly that - your opinion . But you are busy ? "
398607	398644	398671	398671	himself	1498	" Sit down , William . Old days were coming over me when you entered ; days earlier still return now , - days , too , that leave no shadow when their suns are set . "
398679	398702	398667	398667	He	1498	" You would ask my opinion ? What on ? Some public matter - some parliamentary bill that may affect your property ? "
398703	398746	398671	398671	himself	1498	" Am I such a mean miser as that ? Property - property ? what does property matter , when a man is struck down at his own hearth ? Property , indeed ! But you have no child - happy brother ! "
398747	398780	398801	398803	the poor father	11445	" Ay , ay ; as you say , I am a happy man ; childless ! Has your son displeased you ? I have heard him well spoken of , too . "
398781	398799	398824	398824	he	11445	" Do n't talk of him . Whether his conduct be good or ill is my affair , "
398854	398998	399006	399006	Audley	500	" Randal Leslie tells me you are wise , - a consummate man of the world . No doubt you are so . And Parson Dale tells me that he is sure you have warm feelings , - which I take to be a strange thing for one who has lived so long in London , and has no wife and no child , a widower , and a member of parliament , - for a commercial city , too . Never smile ; it is no smiling matter with me . You know a foreign woman , called Negra or Negro ; not a blackymoor , though , by any means , - at least on the outside of her . Is she such a woman as a plain country gentleman would like his only son to marry - ay or no ? "
398999	399004	399006	399006	Audley	500	" No , indeed , "
399010	399044	399055	399056	the squire	1498	" and I trust your son will commit no action so rash . Shall I see him , or her ? Speak , my dear William . What would you have me do ? "
399045	399053	399083	399084	the statesman	3214	" Nothing ; you have said enough , "
399078	399081	399083	399084	the statesman	3214	" William , "
399086	399233	399234	399235	The squire	1498	" we have been long estranged ; but I do not forget that when we last met , at - at Lord Lansmere 's house , and when I took you aside , and said , ' William , if I lose this election , I must resign all chance of public life ; my affairs are embarrassed . I would not accept money from you , - I would seek a profession , and you can help me there , ' you divined my meaning , and said , ' Take orders ; the Hazeldean living is just vacant . I will get some one to hold it till you are ordained . ' I do not forget that . Would that I had thought earlier of so serene an escape from all that then tormented me ! My lot might have been far happier . "
399250	399301	399320	399320	he	500	" Happier ! Why , all things have prospered with you ; and you are rich enough now ; and - you shake your head . Brother , is it possible ! do you want money ? Pooh , not accept money from your mother 's son ! - stuff ! "
399315	399318	399320	399320	he	500	" Nay , "
399322	399392	399658	399658	his	500	" I have enough for myself ; but since you seek and speak with me thus affectionately , I will ask you one favour . Should I die before I can provide for my wife 's kinsman , Randal Leslie , as I could wish , will you see to his fortunes , so far as you can , without injury to others , - to your own son ? "
399393	399562	399320	399320	he	500	" My son ! He is provided for . He has the Casino estate - much good may it do him ! You have touched on the very matter that brought me here . This boy , Randal Leslie , seems a praiseworthy lad , and has Hazeldean blood in his veins . You have taken him up because he is connected with your late wife . Why should I not take him up , too , when his grandmother was a Hazeldean ? My main object in calling was to ask what you mean to do for him ; for if you do not mean to provide for him , why , I will , as in duty bound . So your request comes at the right time ; I think of altering my will . I can put him into the entail , besides a handsome legacy . You are sure he is a good lad , - and it will please you too , Audley ! "
399563	399600	399658	399658	his	500	" But not at the expense of your son . And stay , William : as to this foolish marriage with Madame di Negra , - who told you Frank meant to take such a step ? "
399601	399634	399656	399656	Audley	500	" He told me himself ; but it is no matter . Randal and I both did all we could to dissuade him ; and Randal advised me to come to you . "
399635	399654	399656	399656	Audley	500	" He has acted generously , then , our kinsman Randal - I am glad to hear it , "
399663	399702	399711	399712	the squire	1498	" I have no influence with this lady ; but , at least , I can counsel her . Do not consider the marriage fixed because a young man desires it . Youth is ever hot and rash . "
399703	399709	399658	399658	his	500	" Your youth never was , "
399716	399767	399773	399773	Egerton	500	" You married well enough , I 'm sure . I will say one thing for you : you have been , to my taste , a bad politician - beg pardon - but you were always a gentleman . You would never have disgraced your family and married a - "
399768	399771	399773	399773	Egerton	500	" Hush ! "
399777	399803	399809	399810	the squire	1498	" Do not make matters worse than they are . Madame di Negra is of high birth in her own country ; and if scandal - "
399804	399807	399809	399810	the squire	1498	" Scandal ! "
399818	400023	400031	400031	Audley	500	" Are you speaking of the wife of a Hazeldean ? At least she shall never sit by the hearth at which now sits his mother ; and whatever I may do for Frank , her children shall not succeed . No mongrel cross - breed shall kennel in English Hazeldean . Much obliged to you , Audley , for your good feeling ; glad to have seen you ; and hark ye , you startled me by that shake of your head , when I spoke of your wealth ; and from what you say about Randal 's prospects , I guess that you London gentlemen are not so thrifty as we are . You shall let me speak . I say again , that I have some thousands quite at your service . And though you are not a Hazeldean , still you are my mother 's son ; and now that I am about to alter my will , I can as well scratch in the name of Egerton as that of Leslie . Cheer up , cheer up : you are younger than I am , and you have no child ; so you will live longer than I shall . "
400024	400029	400031	400031	Audley	500	" My dear brother , "
400033	400077	400221	400222	the former	1553	" believe me , I shall never live to want your aid . And as to Leslie , add to the L5,000 I mean to give him an equal sum in your will , and I shall feel that he has received justice . "
400226	400245	400221	400222	the former	1553	" What , Mr. Hazeldean , have you just left your brother 's house ? Is it possible ? "
400246	400292	400302	400302	Randal	570	" Why , you advised me to go there , and I did . I scarcely knew what I was about . I am very glad I did go . Hang politics ! hang the landed interest ! what do I care for either now ? "
400293	400300	400318	400319	the squire	1498	" Foiled with Madame di Negra ? "
400309	400316	400420	400421	the squire	1498	" Never speak of her again ! "
400323	400418	400420	400421	the squire	1498	" And as to that ungrateful boy - but I do n't mean to behave harshly to him , - he shall have money enough to keep her if he likes , keep her from coming to me , keep him , too , from counting on my death , and borrowing post - obits on the Casino - for he 'll be doing that next - no , I hope I wrong him there ; I have been too good a father for him to count on my death already . After all , "
400427	400493	400518	400518	he	570	" as Audley says , the marriage is not yet made ; and if the woman has taken him in , he is young , and his heart is warm . Make yourself easy , my boy . I do n't forget how kindly you took his part ; and before I do anything rash , I 'll at least consult with his poor mother . "
400511	400516	400518	400518	he	570	" True , sir , "
400522	400598	400690	400691	the squire	1498	" true , you must not be rash . Indeed , I was thinking of you and poor dear Frank at the very moment I met you . It occurred to me whether we might not make Frank 's very embarrassments a reason to induce Madame di Negra to refuse him ; and I was on my way to Mr. Egerton , in order to ask his opinion , in company with the gentleman yonder . "
400599	400621	400518	400518	he	570	" Gentleman yonder . Why should he thrust his long nose into my family affairs ? Who the devil is he ? "
400622	400634	400690	400691	the squire	1498	" Do n't ask , sir . Pray let me act . "
400676	400688	400518	400518	he	570	" He looks very outlandish . Is he a foreigner too ? "
400695	400713	400690	400691	the squire	1498	" No , not exactly . However , he knows all about Frank 's embarrassments ; and - "
400714	400734	400743	400743	Randal	570	" Embarrassments ! what , the debt he paid for that woman ? How did he raise the money ? "
400735	400741	400743	400743	Randal	570	" I do n't know , "
400745	400774	400781	400782	the squire	1498	" and that is the reason I asked Baron Levy to accompany me to Egerton 's , that he might explain in private what I have no reason - "
400775	400779	400781	400782	the squire	1498	" Baron Levy ! "
400784	400829	400830	400830	Randal	570	" Levy , Levy - I have heard of a Levy who has nearly ruined my neighbour Thornhill , - a money - lender . Zounds ! is that the man who knows my son 's affairs ? I 'll soon learn , sir . "
400839	400937	400947	400948	the squire	1498	" Stop , stop ; if you really insist upon learning more about Frank 's debts , you must not appeal to Baron Levy directly , and as Frank 's father : he will not answer you . But if I present you to him as a mere acquaintance of mine , and turn the conversation , as if carelessly , upon Frank , why , since , in the London world , such matters are never kept secret , except from the parents of young men , I have no doubt he will talk out openly . "
400938	400945	400959	400959	Levy	1175	" Manage it as you will , "
400961	400972	400991	400991	Randal	570	" A friend of mine from the country , Baron . "
400984	400989	400991	400991	Randal	570	" By the by , "
401000	401055	401056	401056	BARON	1175	" my friend has come to town upon the somewhat unpleasant business of settling the debts of another , - a young man of fashion , - a relation of his own . No one , sir turning to the squire , could so ably assist you in such arrangements as could Baron Levy . "
401066	401119	401120	401120	RANDAL	570	" I have some experience in such matters , and I hold it a duty to assist the parents and relations of young men who , from want of reflection , often ruin themselves for life . I hope the young gentleman in question is not in the hands of the Jews ? "
401123	401141	401142	401142	BARON	9091	" Christians are as fond of good interest for their money as ever the Jews can be . "
401145	401164	401142	401142	BARON	9091	" Granted , but they have not always so much money to lend . The first thing , sir "
401170	401228	401229	401229	RANDAL	570	" the first thing for you to do is to buy up such of your relation 's bills and notes of hand as may be in the market . No doubt we can get them a bargain , unless the young man is heir to some property that may soon be his in the course of nature . "
401232	401253	401229	401229	RANDAL	570	" Not soon - Heaven forbid ! His father is still a young man , - a fine healthy man , "
401261	401269	401270	401270	BARON	1175	" and as to post - obits - "
401273	401294	401295	401295	RANDAL	570	" Post - obits on sound security cost more to buy up , however healthy the obstructing relative may be . "
401298	401323	401324	401324	BARON	1175	" I should hope that there are not many sons who can calculate , in cold blood , on the death of their fathers . "
401327	401344	401345	401345	RANDAL	570	" Ha , ha ! He is young , our friend Randal ; eh , sir ? "
401348	401498	401527	401527	Randal	570	" Well , I am not more scrupulous than others , I dare say ; and I have often been pinched hard for money , but I would go barefoot rather than give security upon a father 's grave ! I can imagine nothing more likely to destroy natural feeling , nor to instil ingratitude and treachery into the whole character , than to press the hand of a parent , and calculate when that hand may be dust ; than to sit down with strangers and reduce his life to the measure of an insurance - table ; than to feel difficulties gathering round one , and mutter in fashionable slang , ' But it will be all well if the governor would but die . ' And he who has accustomed himself to the relief of post - obits must gradually harden his mind to all this . "
401522	401525	401533	401533	his	570	" But , "
401536	401584	401614	401614	Randal	570	" I think that our young friend , of whom we were talking just now , Levy , before this gentleman joined us , has the same opinions as myself on this head . He may accept bills , but he would never sign post - obits . "
401618	401661	401662	401662	RANDAL	570	" Pooh ! the young fellow we are talking of ? Nonsense . He would not be so foolish as to give five times the percentage he otherwise might . Not sign post - obits ! Of course he has signed one . "
401665	401674	401675	401675	SQUIRE	447	" Hist ! you mistake , you mistake ! "
401686	401694	401695	401695	BARON	9091	" Were you speaking of Frank Hazeldean ? "
401698	401713	401714	401714	SQUIRE	447	" My dear sir , excuse me , I never mention names before strangers . "
401717	401734	401751	401751	BARON	9091	" Strangers again ! Man , I am the boy 's father Speak out , sir , "
401754	401800	401801	401801	RANDAL	570	" Gently ; you hurt me , sir : but I excuse your feelings . Randal , you are to blame for leading me into this indiscretion ; but I beg to assure Mr. Hazeldean , that though his son has been a little extravagant - "
401804	401815	401816	401816	BARON	9091	" Owing chiefly to the arts of an abandoned woman . "
401819	401886	401887	401887	SQUIRE	15284	" Of an abandoned woman ; - still he has shown more prudence than you would suppose ; and this very post - obit is a proof of it . A simple act of that kind has enabled him to pay off bills that were running on till they would have ruined even the Hazeldean estate ; whereas a charge on the reversion of the Casino - "
401890	401903	401904	401904	RANDAL	570	" He has done it then ? He has signed a postobit ? "
401907	401917	401918	401918	BARON	1175	" No , no , Levy must be wrong . "
401921	401999	402000	402000	SQUIRE	447	" My dear Leslie , a man of Mr. Hazeldean 's time of life can not have your romantic boyish notions . He must allow that Frank has acted in this like a lad of sense - very good head for business has my young friend Frank ! And the best thing Mr. Hazeldean can do is quietly to buy up the post - obit , and thus he will place his son henceforth in his power . "
402003	402014	402015	402015	BARON	9091	" Can I see the deed with my own eyes ? "
402018	402066	402067	402067	SQUIRE	15284	" Certainly , or how could you be induced to buy it up ? But on one condition ; you must not betray me to your son . And , indeed , take my advice , and do n't say a word to him on the matter . "
402070	402096	402097	402097	BARON	1175	" Let me see it , let me see it with my own eyes ! His mother else will never believe it - nor will I. "
402100	402109	402110	402110	SQUIRE	447	" I can call on you this evening . "
402113	402118	402119	402119	BARON	1175	" Now , now ! "
402122	402156	402157	402157	RANDAL	570	" You can spare me , Randal ; and you yourself can open to Mr. Egerton the other affair respecting Lansmere . No time should be lost , lest L'Estrange suggest a candidate . "
402161	402171	402157	402157	RANDAL	570	" Never mind me . This is more important . "
402174	402184	402157	402157	RANDAL	570	" Go with Mr. Hazeldean . My dear kind friend "
402189	402244	402252	402253	the squire	1498	" do not let this vex you so much . After all , it is what nine young men out of ten would do in the same circumstances . And it is best you should know it ; you may save Frank from further ruin , and prevent , perhaps , this very marriage . "
402245	402250	402252	402253	the squire	1498	" We will see , "
402257	402265	402302	402305	the ex - minister	11125	" Now , Mr. Levy , come . "
402290	402300	402302	402305	the ex - minister	11125	" I am glad to see you , Leslie , "
402307	402353	402354	402354	RANDAL	570	" What is it I have heard ? My nephew , Frank Hazeldean , proposes to marry Madame di Negra against his father 's consent ? How could you suffer him to entertain an idea so wild ? And how never confide it to me ? "
402357	402412	402413	402413	EGERTON	500	" My dear Mr. Egerton , it is only to - day that I was informed of Frank 's engagement . I have already seen him , and expostulated in vain ; till then , though I knew your nephew admired Madame di Negra , I could never suppose he harboured a serious intention . "
402416	402468	402469	402469	RANDAL	570	" I must believe you , Randal . I will myself see Madame di Negra , though I have no power , and no right , to dictate to her . I have but little time for all such private business . The dissolution of parliament is so close at hand . "
402474	402788	402807	402807	EGERTON	500	" It is on that subject that I wished to speak to you , sir . You think of standing for Lansmere . Well , Baron Levy has suggested to me an idea that I could not , of course , even countenance , till I had spoken to you . It seems that he has some acquaintance with the state of parties in that borough . He is informed that it is not only as easy to bring in two of our side as to carry one , but that it would make your election still more safe not to fight single - handed against two opponents ; that if canvassing for yourself alone , you could not carry a sufficient number of plumper votes ; that split votes would go from you to one or other of the two adversaries ; that , in a word , it is necessary to pair you with a colleague . If it really be so , you of course will learn best from your own Committee ; but should they concur in the opinion Baron Levy has formed , do I presume too much on your kindness to deem it possible that you might allow me to be the second candidate on your side ? I should not say this , but that Levy told me you had some wish to see me in parliament , amongst the supporters of your policy . And what other opportunity can occur ? Here the cost of carrying two would be scarcely more than that of carrying one . And Levy says the party would subscribe for my election ; you , of course , would refuse all such aid for your own ; and indeed , with your great name , and Lord Lansmere 's interest , there can be little beyond the strict legal expenses . "
402811	402879	402908	402908	he	500	" I will consider . You may safely leave in my hands any matter connected with your ambition and advancement . I have before told you I hold it a duty to do all in my power for the kinsman of my late wife , for one whose career I undertook to forward , for one whom honour has compelled to share in my own political reverses . "
402913	402942	402908	402908	he	500	" You seem intimate with Baron Levy ; I caution you against him , - a dangerous acquaintance , first to the purse , next to the honour . "
402946	402977	402978	402978	EGERTON	500	" I know it , sir ; and am surprised myself at the acquaintance that has grown up between us . Perhaps its cause is in his respect for yourself . "
402981	402984	402985	402985	RANDAL	570	" Tut . "
402988	403029	403030	403030	EGERTON	500	" Whatever it be , he contrives to obtain a singular hold over one 's mind , even where , as in my case , he has no evident interest to serve . How is this ? It puzzles me ! "
403033	403085	403086	403086	RANDAL	570	" For his interest , it is most secured where he suffers it to be least evident ; for his hold over the mind , it is easily accounted for . He ever appeals to two temptations , strong with all men , - Avarice and Ambition . Good - day . "
403089	403116	403117	403117	EGERTON	500	" Are you going to Madame di Negra 's ? Shall I not accompany you ? Perhaps I may be able to back your own remonstrances . "
403120	403129	403130	403130	RANDAL	570	" No , I shall not require you . "
403133	403156	403157	403157	Audley	500	" I trust I shall hear the result of your interview ? I feel so much interested in it . Poor Frank ! "
403160	403167	403197	403197	women	2983	" Of course , of course . "
403240	403245	403400	403400	I	0	" Ladies ' men . "
403394	403399	403400	403400	I	0	" My dear marchesa , "
403404	403500	403389	403389	himself	500	" are we then likely to be near connections ? And can you seriously contemplate marriage with my young nephew , Frank Hazeldean ? You turn away . Ah , my fair friend , there are but two inducements to a free woman to sign away her liberty at the altar . I say a free woman , for widows are free , and girls are not . These inducements are , first , worldly position ; secondly , love . Which of these motives can urge Madame di Negra to marry Mr. Frank Hazeldeani ? "
403501	403540	403763	403767	the man of the world	2990	" There are other motives than those you speak of , - the need of protection , the sense of solitude , the curse of dependence , gratitude for honourable affection . But you men never know women ! "
403541	403761	403763	403767	the man of the world	2990	" I grant that you are right there , - we never do ; neither do women ever know men . And yet each sex contrives to dupe and to fool the other ! Listen to me . I have little acquaintance with my nephew , but I allow he is a handsome young gentleman , with whom a handsome young lady in her teens might fall in love in a ball - room . But you , who have known the higher order of our species , you who have received the homage of men , whose thoughts and mind leave the small talk of drawing - room triflers so poor and bald , you can not look me in the face and say that it is any passion resembling love which you feel for my nephew . And as to position , it is right that I should inform you that if he marry you he will have none . He may risk his inheritance . You will receive no countenance from his parents . You will be poor , but not free . You will not gain the independence you seek for . The sight of a vacant , discontented face in that opposite chair will be worse than solitude . And as to grateful affection , "
403769	403779	403786	403786	Beatrice	1130	" it is a polite synonym for tranquil indifference . "
403780	403784	403786	403786	Beatrice	1130	" Mr. Egerton , "
403788	403807	403816	403817	the statesman	3214	" people say you are made of bronze . Did you ever feel the want of a home ? "
403808	403814	403816	403817	the statesman	3214	" I answer you frankly , "
403819	403883	403891	403891	Beatrice	1130	" if I had not felt it , do you think I should have been , and that I should be to the last , the joyless drudge of public life ? Bronze though you call my nature , it would have melted away long since like wax in the fire , if I had sat idly down and dreamed of a home ! "
403884	403889	403914	403914	she	1130	" But we women , "
403896	403913	403914	403914	she	1130	" have no public life , and we do idly sit down and dream . Oh , "
403929	403992	403998	403998	Audley	500	" you think me worldly , grasping , ambitious ; how different my fate had been had I known a home ! - known one whom I could love and venerate ; known one whose smiles would have developed the good that was once within me , and the fear of whose rebuking or sorrowful eye would have corrected what is evil . "
403993	403996	403998	403998	Audley	500	" Yet , "
404000	404124	404147	404147	he	500	" nearly all women in the great world have had that choice once in their lives , and nearly all have thrown it away . How few of your rank really think of home when they marry ! how few ask to venerate as well as to love ! and how many , of every rank , when the home has been really gained , have wilfully lost its shelter , - some in neglectful weariness , some from a momentary doubt , distrust , caprice , a wild fancy , a passionate fit , a trifle , a straw , a dream ! True , you women are ever dreamers . Commonsense , common earth , is above or below your comprehension . "
404141	404145	404147	404147	he	500	" We two , "
404157	404284	404306	404306	Audley	500	" we two must not longer waste time in talking sentiment . We know both too well what life , as it has been made for us by our faults or our misfortunes , truly is . And once again , I entreat you to pause before you yield to the foolish suit of my foolish nephew . Rely on it , you will either command a higher offer for your prudence to accept ; or , if you needs must sacrifice rank and fortune , you , with your beauty and your romantic heart , will see one who , at least for a fair holiday season if human love allows no more , can repay you for the sacrifice . Frank Hazeldean never can . "
404298	404304	404306	404306	Audley	500	" Think over this well , "
404317	404456	404463	404463	Beatrice	1130	" Do you remember that when you first came to England , I told you that neither wedlock nor love had any lures for me ? We grew friends upon that rude avowal , and therefore I now speak to you like some sage of old , wise because standing apart and aloof from all the affections and ties that mislead our wisdom . Nothing but real love - how rare it is ; has one human heart in a million ever known it ? - nothing but real love can repay us for the loss of freedom , the cares and fears of poverty , the cold pity of the world that we both despise and respect . And all these , and much more , follow the step you would inconsiderately take , an imprudent marriage . "
404457	404461	404463	404463	Beatrice	1130	" Audley Egerton , "
404472	404502	404573	404573	He	500	" you grant that real love does compensate for an imprudent marriage . You speak as if you had known such love - you ! Can it be possible ? "
404503	404546	404463	404463	Beatrice	1130	" Real love - I thought that I knew it once . Looking back with remorse , I should doubt it now but for one curse that only real love , when lost , has the power to leave evermore behind it . "
404547	404552	404560	404560	Egerton	500	" What is that ? "
404553	404558	404560	404560	Egerton	500	" A void here , "
404566	404572	404586	404586	Egerton	500	" Desolation ! - Adieu ! "
404580	404584	404589	404589	he	500	" Is it , "
404597	404644	406139	406142	her first village lover	11567	" is it that , as we approach death , all the first fair feelings of young life come back to us mysteriously ? Thus I have heard , or read , that in some country of old , children scattering flowers preceded a funeral bier . "
406147	406187	406355	406355	she	11580	" So she put M. 's hand into her sister 's , and said , ' You loved me through the fancy , love her with the heart , ' and left them comprehending each other , and betrothed . "
406350	406353	406594	406596	The first person	11526	" companion . "
406606	406608	406672	406673	this personage	9033	" I "
406678	406681	407597	407598	Lady Lansmere	822	" He , "
407587	407595	407597	407598	Lady Lansmere	822	" I have such confidence in you , "
407600	407640	407651	407652	young Harley	503	" that if you once know the girl , your advice will be sure to have weight with her . You will show her how wicked it would be to let Harley break our hearts and degrade his station . "
407641	407649	407651	407652	young Harley	503	" I have such confidence in you , "
407654	407721	407881	407881	Rochefoucauld	1342	" that if you once know my Nora , you will no longer side with my mother . You will recognize the nobility which nature only can create , you will own that Nora is worthy a rank more lofty than mine ; and my mother so believes in your wisdom , that , if you plead in my cause , you will convince even her . "
407885	407891	408362	408362	he	500	" mystery of the body , "
408352	408360	408362	408362	he	500	" I will go there no more , "
408369	408373	408362	408362	he	500	" But why ? "
408374	408389	409030	409030	himself	500	" The girl does not love you . Cease then to think of her . "
409032	409049	409195	409197	the elder friend	11679	" Right - or wrong , there is no looking back ; the deed is done , "
409182	409193	409195	409197	the elder friend	11679	" The dream of an hour , at his age , "
409199	409209	409996	409996	He	500	" but at mine the passion of a life ! "
410019	410030	410492	410492	Levy	1175	" Why , this , then , is real happiness ! "
410494	410505	410542	410542	Levy	1175	" that to borrow more would be but larger ruin , "
410522	410540	410542	410542	Levy	1175	" No place so good for frightening one 's creditors into compounding their claims ; but why , "
410548	410564	411088	411088	Levy	1175	" why not go to young L'Estrange , a boy made to be borrowed from ! "
411079	411086	411088	411088	Levy	1175	" By - the - by , "
411108	411127	411128	411128	EGERTON	499	" by - the - by , I shall be this evening in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Egerton . "
411131	411136	411137	411137	LEVY	1175	" Say Mrs. Bertram ! "
411140	411154	411155	411155	EGERTON	499	" Ay ; will she not be in want of some pecuniary supplies ? "
411157	411193	411194	411194	LEVY	1175	" My wife ! - Not yet . I must first be wholly ruined before she can want ; and if I were so , do you think I should not be by her side ? "
411197	411241	411242	411242	EGERTON	499	" I beg pardon , my dear fellow ; your pride of gentleman is so susceptible that it is hard for a lawyer not to wound it unawares . Your wife , then , does not know the exact state of your affairs ? "
411245	411271	411272	411272	LEVY	1175	" Of course not . Who would confide to a woman things in which she could do nothing , except to tease one the more ? "
411275	411326	411327	411327	EGERTON	499	" True , and a poetess too ! I have prevented your finishing your answer to Mrs. Bertram 's last letter . Can I take it - it may save a day 's delay - that is , if you do not object to my calling on her this evening . "
411336	411341	411342	411342	LEVY	1175	" Object ! no . "
411349	411360	411361	411361	EGEPTON	1343	" Be quick , or I shall lose the coach . "
411367	411419	411420	411420	LEVY	1175	" There . And I should be obliged to you if you would call ; and without alarming her as to my circumstances , you can just say that you know I am much harassed about important affairs at present , and so soothe the effects of my very short answers - "
411423	411438	411445	411445	Egerton	499	" To those doubly - crossed , very long letters , - I will . "
411439	411443	411500	411500	I	0	" Poor Nora , "
411507	411507	411508	411508	LEVY	1175	"
411511	411532	411545	411547	the strong man	9156	" You must have done so . I never thought it in you to sacrifice the world to a woman . "
411536	411543	411589	411589	LEVY	1175	" Nor I either ; but , "
411567	411588	411589	411589	LEVY	1175	" but I have not sacrificed the world yet . This right arm shall bear up her and myself too . "
411592	411648	411589	411589	LEVY	1175	" Well said ! but in the mean while , for heaven 's sake , do n't attempt to go to London , nor to leave this place ; for , in that case , I know you will be arrested , and then adieu to all hopes of parliament , - of a career . "
411685	411691	412114	412114	He	1175	" disgrace and a jail , "
412107	412113	412171	412171	he	1175	" to do her justice . "
412181	412223	412287	412287	he	1175	" that her marriage was not strictly legal ; that the forms required by the law had not been complied with , that Audley , unintentionally or purposely , had left himself free to disown the rite and desert the bride . "
412279	412285	412287	412287	he	1175	" These are your obstacles , "
412289	412308	412324	412324	She	821	" but I think I may induce him to repair the wrong , and right you at last . "
412334	412369	412376	412376	Nora	821	" But where was the honour when he betrayed his friend ? Did you not know that he was entrusted by Lord L'Estrange to plead for him . How did he fulfil the trust ? "
412370	412375	412421	412421	Levy	1175	" Plead for L'Estrange ! "
412440	412577	412587	412587	Nora	821	" In Egerton 's world , man holds it far more dishonour to betray a man than to dupe a woman ; and if Egerton could do the one , why doubt that he would do the other ? But do not look at me with those indignant eyes . Put himself to the test ; write to him to say that the suspicions amidst which you live have become intolerable , that they infect even yourself , despite your reason , that the secrecy of your nuptials , his prolonged absence , his brief refusal , on unsatisfactory grounds , to proclaim your tie , all distract you with a terrible doubt . Ask him , at least if he will not yet declare your marriage , to satisfy you that the rites were legal . "
412578	412585	412587	412587	Nora	821	" I will go to him , "
412591	412616	412652	412652	Levy	1175	" Go to him ! - in his own house ! What a scene , what a scandal ! Could he ever forgive you ? "
412617	412651	412798	412798	Levy	1175	" At least , then , I will implore him to come here . I can not write such horrible words ; I can not ! I can not ! Go , go ! "
412811	412848	412865	412865	he	1175	" Look under yon trees . Do you see those men ? They are bailiffs . This is the true reason why I come to you to - day . You can not leave this house . "
412852	412864	412979	412979	Audley	500	" And this frantic , foolish letter at such a time ! "
412969	412977	412979	412979	Audley	500	" She has before written to me , "
412990	413058	413064	413064	Levy	1175	" asking me when our marriage can be proclaimed , and I thought my replies would have satisfied any reasonable woman . But now , now this is worse , immeasurably worse , - she actually doubts my honour ! I , who have made such sacrifices , - actually doubts whether I , Audley Egerton , an English gentleman , could have been base enough to - "
413059	413062	413064	413064	Levy	1175	" What ? "
413066	413079	413085	413085	Egerton	500	" to deceive your friend L'Estrange ? Did not she know that ? "
413080	413083	412979	412979	Audley	500	" Sir ! "
413090	413133	413191	413191	Audley	500	" Do n't be angry , - all 's fair in love as in war ; and L'Estrange will live yet to thank you for saving him from such a misalliance . But you are seriously angry : pray , forgive me . "
413172	413189	413191	413191	Audley	500	" It is beneath me to answer , much less to satisfy , such a doubt , "
413193	413244	413141	413142	the usurer	9106	" I could have seen her , and a look of reproach would have sufficed ; but to put my hand to paper , and condescend to write , ' I am not a villain , and I will give you the proofs that I am not ' - never ! "
413245	413311	413191	413191	Audley	500	" You are quite right ; but let us see if we can not reconcile matters between your pride and her feelings . Write simply this : ' All that you ask me to say or to explain , I have instructed Levy , as my solicitor , to say and explain for me ; and you may believe him as you would myself . ' "
413312	413406	413141	413142	the usurer	9106	" Well , the poor fool , she deserves to be punished ; and I suppose that answer will punish her more than a lengthier rebuke . - My mind is so distracted , I can not judge of these trumpery woman - fears and whims ; there , I have written as you suggest . Give her all the proof she needs , and tell her that in six months at furthest , come what will , she shall bear the name of Egerton , as henceforth she must share his fate . "
413407	413413	413191	413191	Audley	500	" Why say six months ? "
413414	413452	413141	413142	the usurer	9106	" Parliament must be dissolved , and there must be a general election before then . I shall either obtain a seat , be secure from a jail , have won field for my energies , or - "
413453	413457	413191	413191	Audley	500	" Or what ? "
413458	413515	413141	413142	the usurer	9106	" I shall renounce ambition altogether , ask my brother to assist me towards whatever debts remain when all my property is fairly sold - they can not be much . He has a living in his gift ; the incumbent is old , and , I hear , very ill . I can take orders . "
413516	413523	413191	413191	Audley	500	" Sink into a country parson ! "
413524	413563	413999	413999	he	500	" And learn content . I have tasted it already . She was then by my side . Explain all to her . This letter , I fear , is too unkind - But to doubt me thus ! "
413990	413997	414006	414006	his	500	" Let her do her worst , "
414012	414036	414006	414006	his	500	" it will be but a nine days ' wonder to the world , a fiercer rush of my creditors on their hunted prey "
414037	414045	414053	414053	Egerton	500	" And a challenge from Lord L'Estrange . "
414046	414051	414006	414006	his	500	" So be it , "
414063	414073	414006	414006	his	500	" What is the matter ? Are you ill ? "
414074	414122	414551	414551	Audley	500	" A strange sensation here . My father died of a complaint of the heart , and I myself was once told to guard , through life , against excess of emotion . I smiled at such a warning then . Let us sit down to business . "
414556	414585	416191	416192	the artist	1640	" She you seek is another 's ; your love is razed out of your life ; and , for consolation , learn that your friend has betrayed you "
416197	416210	416649	416649	Her	821	" Why art thou here , and wherefore dost thou haunt us ? "
416638	416648	416923	416924	John Avenel	520	" Daughter , where and who is thy husband ? "
416915	416921	416923	416924	John Avenel	520	" Well , old woman , "
416926	417005	417170	417171	Mrs. Avenel	838	" I must be off presently to see to those three shaky voters in Fish Lane ; they will have done their work soon , and I shall catch 'em at home . They do say as how we may have an opposition ; and I know that old Smikes has gone to Lonnon in search of a candidate . We ca n't have the Lansmere Constitutional Blues beat by a Lonnoner ! Ha , ha , ha ! "
417006	417029	417035	417035	John	521	" But you will be home before Jane and her husband Mark come ? How ever she could marry a common carpenter ! "
417030	417033	417035	417035	John	521	" Yes , "
417037	417099	417170	417171	Mrs. Avenel	838	" he is a carpenter ; but he has a vote , and that strengthens the family interest . If Dick was not gone to Amerikay , there would be three on us . But Mark is a real good Blue ! A Lonnoner , indeed ! a Yellow from Lonnon beat my Lord and the Blues ! Ha , ha ! "
417100	417112	417035	417035	John	521	" But , John , this Mr. Egerton is a Lonnoner ! "
417113	417169	417170	417171	Mrs. Avenel	838	" You do n't understand things , talking such nonsense . Mr. Egerton is the Blue candidate , and the Blues are the Country Party ; therefore how can he be a Lonnoner ? An uncommon clever , well - grown , handsome young man , eh ! and my young Lord 's particular friend . "
417174	417185	417170	417171	Mrs. Avenel	838	" What are you sighing and shaking your head for ? "
417186	417199	417207	417207	John	521	" I was thinking of our poor , dear , dear Nora ! "
417200	417205	417170	417171	Mrs. Avenel	838	" God bless her ! "
417228	417247	417257	417258	Mrs. Avenel	838	" Ha , ha ! Hark ! I said that so loud that I have startled the ravens ! "
417248	417255	417257	417258	Mrs. Avenel	838	" How he did love her ! "
417262	417293	417170	417171	Mrs. Avenel	838	" I am sure he did ; and no wonder , for she looks every inch a lady ; and why should not she be my lady , after all ? "
417294	417337	417257	417258	Mrs. Avenel	838	" He ? Who ? Oh , that foolish fancy of yours about my young Lord ? A prudent woman like you ! - stuff ! I am glad my little beauty is gone to Lonnon , out of harm 's way . "
417338	417373	417387	417387	John	521	" John , John , John ! No harm could ever come to my Nora . She 's too pure and too good , and has too proper a pride in her , to - "
417374	417385	417393	417393	he	521	" To listen to any young lords , I hope , "
417389	417392	417451	417451	his	11904	" though , "
417466	417466	417451	417451	his	11904	"
417467	417477	417598	417599	the father	2917	" Well , John , well ; go on . "
417478	417596	417630	417631	Mrs. Avenel	838	" That is all . My Lady came up , and took me away to talk about the election ; and just as I was going , she whispered , ' Do n't let my wild boy talk to you about that sweet girl of yours . We must both see that she does not come to disgrace . ' ' Disgrace ! ' that word made me very angry for the moment . But my Lady has such a way with her that she soon put me right again . Yet , I do think Nora must have loved my young Lord , only she was too good to show it . What do you say ? "
417605	417628	417647	417647	John	521	" I hope she 'll never love any man till she 's married to him ; it is not proper , John , "
417640	417645	417647	417647	John	521	" Ha , ha ! "
417657	417684	417694	417696	the prim wife	11907	" you did not say that to me when I stole your first kiss under that very pollard - tree - no house near it then ! "
417685	417692	417707	417707	John	521	" Hush , John , hush ! "
417702	417705	417707	417707	John	521	" Pooh , "
417711	417791	417647	417647	John	521	" I do n't see why we plain folk should pretend to be more saintly and prudish - like than our betters . There 's that handsome Miss Leslie , who is to marry Mr. Egerton - easy enough to see how much she is in love with him , - could not keep her eyes off from him even in church , old girl ! Ha , ha ! What the deuce is the matter with the ravens ? "
417792	417820	417707	417707	John	521	" They 'll be a comely couple , John . And I hear tell she has a power of money . When is the marriage to be ? "
417821	417866	418044	418045	John Avenel	520	" Oh , they say as soon as the election is over . A fine wedding we shall have of it ! I dare say my young Lord will be bridesman . We 'll send for our little Nora to see the gay doings ! "
418035	418042	418044	418045	John Avenel	520	" Oh , wife , wife ! "
418053	418066	418195	418196	his wife	1782	" it is our child Nora ! Our child ! our child ! "
418211	418240	418195	418196	his wife	1782	" John , run for Mr. Morgan , - make haste . But mind - do n't speak to any one on the way . Quick , quick ! "
418241	418246	418264	418264	her	838	" Is she dying ? "
418247	418258	418264	418264	her	838	" I do n't know . Why not die before ? "
418267	418278	418287	418287	John	520	" but Mr. Morgan is a discreet , friendly man . "
418279	418284	418454	418454	she	11925	" A true Blue ! "
418435	418447	418489	418491	Mark the Poet	1351	" He 'll be good when we get in , Mark , "
418473	418487	418499	418500	the wife	2339	" Do n't forget the flowers that the squire 's gardener gave us , "
418518	418552	418587	418592	A gentleman dressed in clerical costume	11929	" Very odd ! they do n't seem to expect us , Mark . How still the house is ! Go and knock ; they ca n't ha ' gone to bed yet . "
418625	418646	418657	418658	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Are you not the young folks my friend John Avenel told me this morning he expected to visit him ? "
418647	418655	418657	418658	Mrs. Fairfield	452	" Yes , please , Mr. Dale , "
418664	418677	418687	418690	the curate of Lansmere	11931	" You remember me ! and this is my dear good man ! "
418678	418685	418687	418690	the curate of Lansmere	11931	" What ! Mark the Poet ? "
418696	418705	418713	418713	Mark	1351	" Come to write squibs for the election ? "
418706	418711	418724	418725	the curate	11932	" Squibs , sir ! "
418717	418722	418772	418773	the curate	11932	" Burns wrote squibs , "
418766	418770	418772	418773	the curate	11932	" Mr. Morgan ! "
418779	418787	418761	418761	himself	11933	" no illness here , I hope ? "
418788	418820	418826	418826	Mark	1351	" Cott ! it is you , Mr. Dale ! - Come in , come in ; I want a word with you . But who the teuce are these people ? "
418821	418824	418826	418826	Mark	1351	" Sir , "
418833	418848	418761	418761	himself	11933	" my name is Fairfield , and my wife is Mr. Avenel 's daughter ! "
418849	418883	419269	419271	the ambitious man	11739	" Oh , Jane - and her baby too ! - Cood ! cood ! Come in ; but be quiet , ca n't you ? Still , still - still as death ! "
419261	419267	419269	419271	the ambitious man	11739	" Peace , at least , "
419274	419280	419704	419704	her	821	" I shall have peace ! "
419709	419727	419733	419733	he	500	" Has it , then , been my fault that we parted ? Forgive , forgive me ! "
419736	419748	419882	419882	he	500	" Never part from me again , - never , never ! "
419876	419881	419911	419912	Lady Lansmere	822	" Who is there ? "
419893	419908	419993	419993	she	822	" Hush , it is I ; dress quick ; let me see you . "
420002	420070	419993	419993	she	822	" Oh , Mr. Egerton , you must serve me , and at once . Harley ! Harley ! save my Harley ! Go to him , prevent his coming back here , stay with him ; give up the election , - it is but a year or two lost in your life , you will have other opportunities ; make that sacrifice to your friend . "
420071	420089	419993	419993	she	822	" Speak - what is the matter ? I can make no sacrifice too great for Harley ! "
420090	420156	419993	419993	she	822	" Thanks , I was sure of it . Go then , I say , at once to Harley ; keep him away from Lansmere on any excuse you can invent , until you can break the sad news to him , - gently , gently . Oh , how will he bear it ; how recover the shock ? My boy , my boy ! "
420157	420171	419993	419993	she	822	" Calm yourself ! Explain ! Break what news ; recover what shock ? "
420172	420201	420237	420237	he	500	" True ; you do not know , you have not heard . Nora Avenel lies yonder , in her father 's house , - dead , dead ! "
420229	420236	420237	420237	he	500	" My bride , my wife ! "
420240	420248	420446	420447	Lady Lansmere	822	" Dead - it can not be ! "
420454	420524	420550	420550	his	11986	" Where are you going ? Ah , can I now ask you to save my son from the awful news , you yourself the sufferer ? And yet - yet - you know his haste , his vehemence , if he learned that you were his rival , her husband ; you whom he so trusted ! What , what would be the result ? - I tremble ! "
420525	420548	420550	420550	his	11986	" Tremble not , - I do not tremble ! Let me go ! I will be back soon , and then , "
420554	420562	420638	420638	He	11986	" then we will talk of Harley . "
420645	420668	420972	420972	he	500	" And is it the child of these persons that I , Audley Egerton , must announce to the world as wife ? "
420967	420970	420972	420972	he	500	" Now , "
420976	420991	421031	421032	Lady Lansmere	822	" I will go to Harley , and I will prevent his returning hither . "
420992	421009	420972	420972	he	500	" You have seen the parents . Good heavens ! do they know of your marriage ? "
421010	421025	421031	421032	Lady Lansmere	822	" No ; to Harley I must own it first . Meanwhile , silence ! "
421026	421029	421171	421178	the poor , punctilious Calvinistic trader 's wife	12018	" Silence ! "
421180	421187	421328	421328	herself	838	" Sorrow later , honour now ! "
421330	421354	421908	421909	The crowd	2478	" All difficulty would be over should there be only one ! Nora 's child could thus pass throughout life for Jane 's ! "
421893	421907	421941	421941	his	12061	" He is right ; better die of it than break his promise ! "
421946	421958	422247	422249	the noble Harley	503	" I ' m a true Blue , - Blue forever ! "
422242	422245	422247	422249	the noble Harley	503	" For , "
422251	422316	422324	422324	Egerton	500	" had it not been for my passion , my rash pursuit , would she ever have left her safe asylum , - ever even have left her native town ? And then - and then - the struggle between her sense of duty and her love to me ! I see it all - all ! But for me she were living still ! "
422317	422322	422247	422249	the noble Harley	503	" Oh , no ! "
422334	422372	422378	422378	Harley	503	" Believe me , she never loved you as you think . Nay , nay , hear me ! Rather suppose that she loved another , fled with him , was perhaps married to him , and - "
422373	422376	422378	422378	Harley	503	" Hold ! "
422388	422455	422513	422513	he	14972	" you kill her twice to me if you say that ! I can still feel that she lives - lives here , in my heart - while I dream that she loved me - or , at least , that no other lip ever knew the kiss that was denied to mine ! But if you tell me to doubt that - you - you - "
422508	422512	422513	422513	he	14972	" Tell me , "
422536	422562	422599	422601	the miserable friend	12071	" tell me , you did not mean that ! Tell me you have no cause to think she loved another - was another 's ! "
422563	422597	423216	423220	the man of the world	2990	" Hush , hush ! no cause - none - none ! I meant but to comfort you , as I thought , - fool that I was ! - that is all ! "
423209	423214	423216	423220	the man of the world	2990	" Inquire no further ! "
423222	423357	423216	423220	the man of the world	2990	" Respect Mrs. Avenel 's feelings and wishes , I entreat you ; they are the right ones . Leave the rest to me . In my position - I mean as a resident of London - I can quietly and easily ascertain more than you could , and provoke no scandal ! If I can right this - this - poor - his voice trembled - right the lost mother , or the living child , sooner or later you will hear from me ; if not , bury this secret where it now rests , in a grave which slander has not reached . But the child - give me the address where it is to be found - in case I succeed in finding the father , and touching his heart . "
423358	423379	423216	423220	the man of the world	2990	" Oh , Mr. Egerton , may I not say where you may find that father - who he is ? "
423380	423383	423216	423220	the man of the world	2990	" Sir ! "
423384	423452	423216	423220	the man of the world	2990	" Do not be angry ; and , after all , I can not ask you to betray any confidence which a friend may have placed in you . I know what you men of high honour are to each other , even in sin . No , no , I beg pardon ; I leave all in your hands . I shall hear from you then ? "
423453	423497	423518	423518	he	11932	" Or if not , why , then , believe that all search is hopeless . My friend ! if you mean Lord L'Estrange , he is innocent . I - I - I - the voice faltered - am convinced of it . "
423507	423516	424236	424236	Egerton	573	" Oh , ye men of the world ! "
424225	424232	424236	424236	Egerton	573	" Manage it as you will , "
424251	424251	424262	424262	he	573	"
424252	424261	424262	424262	he	573	" Propose for me , if you will , "
424269	424283	424348	424348	her	12149	" I can not woo , - I can not talk of love . "
424364	424376	424384	424384	Audley	500	" Nothing I could do has ever made you love me ! "
424377	424382	424389	424389	his	500	" It is true , "
424394	424419	425379	425380	the gentleman	1900	" Nature gave me but a small fund of what women like you call ' love , ' and I lavished it all away . "
425371	425377	425379	425380	the gentleman	1900	" Excuse me , sir , "
425389	425431	425439	425439	Leonard	450	" but unless these sharp eyes of mine are mistaken , which they seldom are , I see a nephew whom , perhaps , I behaved to rather too harshly , but who still has no right to forget Richard Avenel . "
425432	425437	425439	425439	Leonard	450	" My dear uncle , "
425441	425475	425379	425380	the gentleman	1900	" this is indeed a joyful surprise ; at a time , too , when I needed joy ! No ; I have never forgotten your kindness , and always regretted our estrangement . "
425476	425515	425439	425439	Leonard	450	" That is well said ; give us your fist again . Let me look at you - quite the gentleman , I declare - still so good - looking too . We Avenels always were a handsome family .
425516	425544	425550	425550	Levy	1175	" Good - by , Baron Levy . Need not wait for me ; I am not going to run away . I shall see you again . "
425545	425548	425550	425550	Levy	1175	" But , "
425572	425602	425550	425550	Levy	1175	" but it must be as I say with regard to the borough ; or to be plain you must cash the bills on the day they are due . "
425603	425641	425648	425649	the baron	17518	" Very well , sir , very well . So you think to put the screw upon me , as if I were a poor little householder . I understand , - my money or my borough ? "
425642	425646	425550	425550	Levy	1175	" Exactly so , "
425656	425663	425667	425667	Levy	1175	" You shall hear from me . "
425671	425678	425785	425785	Levy	1175	" D - -d tarnation rascal ! "
425774	425779	425807	425810	the " tarnation rascal	23746	" over - competition , "
425808	425811	425916	425916	Dick	643	" tarnation rascal "
425909	425914	425916	425916	Dick	643	" Well , well , "
425918	426118	426157	426159	that monster capitalist	12210	" another time for your history . I see you have thrived , and that is enough for the present . Very odd ; but just now I can only think of myself . I 'm in a regular fix , sir . Screwstown is not the respectable Screwstown that you remember it - all demoralized and turned topsy - turvy by a demoniacal monster capitalist , with steam - engines that might bring the falls of Niagara into your back parlour , sir ! And as if that was not enough to destroy and drive into almighty shivers a decent fair - play Britisher like myself , I hear he is just in treaty for some patent infernal invention that will make his engines do twice as much work with half as many hands ! That 's the way those unfeeling ruffians increase our poor - rates ! But I 'll get up a riot against him , I will ! Do n't talk to me of the law ! What the devil is the good of the law if it do n't protect a man 's industry , - a liberal man , too , like me ! "
426180	426208	426157	426159	that monster capitalist	12210	" Stop , uncle , stop ! Why , then , if this man were to buy the contrivance you speak of , it would injure you ? "
426209	426239	426157	426159	that monster capitalist	12210	" Injure me , sir ! I should be a bankrupt , - that is , if it succeeded ; but I dare say it is all a humbug . "
426240	426254	426157	426159	that monster capitalist	12210	" No , it will succeed , - I 'll answer for that ! "
426255	426263	426157	426159	that monster capitalist	12210	" You ! You have seen it ? "
426264	426271	426287	426287	he	643	" Why , I invented it ! "
426281	426286	426295	426295	you	450	" Serpent 's tooth ! "
426311	426311	426287	426287	he	643	"
426312	426341	426351	426352	Dick Avenel	643	" No ; but to save him ! Come into the City and look at my model . If you like it , the patent shall be yours ! "
426342	426349	426355	426357	a ' Ransom	12213	" Cab , cab , cab , "
426360	426392	426287	426287	he	643	" jump in , Leonard , - jump in . I 'll buy your patent , - that is , if it be worth a straw ; and as for payment - "
426393	426402	426412	426412	Dick	643	" Payment ! Do n't talk of that ! "
426403	426410	426412	426412	Dick	643	" Well , I wo n't , "
426416	426483	426652	426652	His	643	" for ' t is not the topic of conversation I should choose myself , just at present . And as for that black - whiskered alligator , the baron , let me first get out of those rambustious , unchristian , filbert - shaped claws of his , and then - but jump in ! jump in ! and tell the man where to drive ! "
426600	426651	426756	426756	Dick	643	" If I can just terrify and whop that infernal intruder on my own ground for a few months , he may offer , himself , to enter into partnership , - make the two concerns a joint - stock friendly combination , and then we shall flog the world . "
426682	426755	426780	426780	he	643	" Well , then , any friend of yours ; I 'm all for reform against those high and mighty right honourable borough - mongers ; and what with loans and mortgages on the small householders , and a long course of ' Free and Easies ' with the independent freemen , I carry one - seat certain , perhaps both seats of the town of Lansmere , in my breeches pocket . "
426790	426828	426846	426846	You	12221	" hurried off , to search amongst his friends in the City for some monster capitalist , who alight be induced to extricate him from the jaws of Levy and the engines of his rival at Screwstown . "
426841	426845	426926	426926	nephew	18949	" said Dick . "
426928	426928	427123	427123	he	503	"
427119	427122	427123	427123	he	503	" No , "
427127	427250	427292	427293	the prince	9342	" no ! I will think only of Helen ; I will think only of real life ! And what were I not engaged to another would that dark - eyed Italian girl be to me ? - What a mere fool 's fancy is this ! I love again , - I , who through all the fair spring of my life have clung with such faith to a memory and a grave ! Come , come , come , Harley L'Estrange , act thy part as man amongst men , at last ! Accept regard ; dream no more of passion . Abandon false ideals . Thou art no poet - why deem that life itself can be a poem ? "
427282	427290	427292	427293	the prince	9342	" Have you discovered those documents yet ? "
427295	427365	427371	427371	Harley	503	" I must now return to Vienna within a few days ; and unless you can arm me with some tangible proof of Peschiera 's ancient treachery , or some more unanswerable excuse for his noble kinsman , I fear that there is no other hope for the exile 's recall to his country than what lies in the hateful option of giving his daughter to his perfidious foe . "
427366	427369	427371	427371	Harley	503	" Alas ! "
427373	427460	427292	427293	the prince	9342	" as yet all researches have been in vain ; and I know not what other steps to take , without arousing Peschiera 's vigilance , and setting his crafty brains at work to counteract us . My poor friend , then , must rest contented with exile . To give Violante to the count were dishonour . But I shall soon be married ; soon have a home , not quite unworthy of their due rank , to offer both to father and to child . "
427461	427497	427503	427503	Harley	503	" Would the future Lady L'Estrange feel no jealousy of a guest so fair as you tell me this young signorina is ? And would you be in no danger yourself , my poor friend ? "
427498	427501	427503	427503	Harley	503	" Pooh ! "
427507	427532	427547	427547	Harley	503	" My fair guest would have two fathers ; that is all . Pray do not jest on a thing so grave as honour . "
427542	427545	427547	427547	Harley	503	" Welcome , "
427563	427601	427609	427609	Leonard	450	" welcome . This is the noble friend who shares our interest for Riccabocca , and who could serve him so well , if we could but discover the document of which I have spoken to you . "
427602	427607	427609	427609	Leonard	450	" It is here , "
427613	427622	427661	427661	he	503	" may it be all that you require ! "
427657	427660	427661	427661	he	503	" Hurrah ! "
427681	427768	427777	427778	the prince	9342	" Look , look , Prince , here are Peschiera 's own letters to his kinsman 's wife ; his avowal of what he calls his ' patriotic designs ; ' his entreaties to her to induce her husband to share them . Look , look , how he wields his influence over the woman he had once wooed ; look how artfully he combats her objections ; see how reluctant our friend was to stir , till wife and kinsman both united to urge him ! "
427769	427775	427805	427805	Harley	503	" It is enough,-quite enough , "
427795	427803	427808	427808	he	503	" No , it is not enough , "
427820	427926	427937	427938	the prince	9342	" More still ! O villain , doubly damned ! Here , after our friend 's flight , here is Peschiera 's avowal of guilty passion ; here , he swears that he had intrigued to ruin his benefactor , in order to pollute the home that had sheltered him . Ah , see how she answers ! thank Heaven her own eyes were opened at last , and she scorned him before she died ! She was innocent ! I said so . Violante 's mother was pure . Poor lady , this moves me ! Has your emperor the heart of a man ? "
427927	427935	427937	427938	the prince	9342	" I know enough of our emperor , "
427942	428012	428018	428018	Harley	503	" to know that , the moment these papers reach him , Peschiera is ruined , and your friend is restored to his honours . You will live to see the daughter , to whom you would have given a child 's place at your hearth , the wealthiest heiress of Italy , - the bride of some noble lover , with rank only below the supremacy of kings ! "
428013	428016	428077	428077	He	503	" Ah , "
428031	428076	428126	428126	He	450	" ah , I shall not see her that ! I shall never visit Italy again ! - never see her more , - never , after she has once quitted this climate of cold iron cares and formal duties ! never , never ! "
428094	428125	428145	428145	Leonard	450	" But you , O happy poet ! No Ideal can ever be lost to you . You are independent of real life . Would that I were a poet ! "
428130	428143	428145	428145	Leonard	450	" You would not say so , perhaps , my dear Lord , "
428151	428226	428227	428227	He	450	" if you knew how little what you call ' the Ideal ' replaces to a poet the loss of one affection in the genial human world . Independent of real life ! Alas ! no . And I have here the confessions of a true poet - soul , which I will entreat you to read at leisure ; and when you have read , say if you would still be a poet ! "
428237	428254	428227	428227	He	450	" Place them yonder , in my escritoire , Leonard ; I will read them later . "
428255	428292	428298	428298	Harley	503	" Do so , and with heed ; for to me there is much here that involves my own life , - much that is still a mystery , and which I think you can unravel ! "
428293	428296	428358	428358	Giacomo	487	" I ! "
428347	428356	428358	428358	Giacomo	487	" Oh , my Lord , my Lord ! "
428363	428372	428336	428336	Giacomo	487	" the signorina ! the signorina ! Violante ! "
428373	428390	428358	428358	Giacomo	487	" What of her ? Mother , Mother ! what of her ? Speak , speak ! "
428391	428401	428411	428411	Giacomo	487	" She has gone , - left our house ! "
428402	428409	428411	428411	Giacomo	487	" Left ! No , no ! "
428413	428445	428451	428451	Harley	503	" She must have been deceived or forced away . The count ! the count ! Oh , my good Lord , save her , as you once saved her father ! "
428446	428449	428451	428451	Harley	503	" Hold ! "
428453	428529	428547	428548	my father	1479	" Give me your arm , Mother . A second such blow in life is beyond the strength of man , - at least it is beyond mine . So , so ! I am better now ! Thank you , Mother . Stand back , all of you ! give me air . So the count has triumphed , and Violante has fled with him ! Explain all , - I can bear it ! "
428542	428545	428547	428548	my father	1479	" Again , "
428551	428649	428695	428696	my mother	1473	" again behold us ! We who greeted the commencement of your narrative , who absented ourselves in the midcourse when we could but obstruct the current of events , and jostle personages more important , - we now gather round the close . Still , as the chorus to the drama , we circle round the altar with the solemn but dubious chant which prepares the audience for the completion of the appointed destinies ; though still , ourselves , unaware how the skein is to be unravelled , and where the shears are to descend . "
428680	428693	428695	428696	my mother	1473	" Violante ca n't have voluntarily gone off with that horrid count , "
428698	428719	428725	428726	my father	1479	" but perhaps she was deceived , like Eugenia by Mr. Bellamy , in the novel of ' CAMILLA ' . "
428720	428723	428725	428726	my father	1479	" Ha ! "
428728	428780	428788	428789	Mrs. Caxton	440	" and in that case it is time yet to steal a hint from Clarissa Harlowe , and make Violante die less of a broken heart than a sullied honour . She is one of those girls who ought to be killed ! All things about her forebode an early tomb ! "
428781	428786	428788	428789	Mrs. Caxton	440	" Dear , dear ! "
428791	428796	428804	428805	the captain	2114	" I hope not ! "
428797	428802	428804	428805	the captain	2114	" Pooh , brother , "
428807	428852	428860	428861	my mother	1473	" we have had enough of the tomb in the history of poor Nora . The whole story grows out of a grave , and if to a grave it must return - if , Pisistratus , you must kill somebody - kill Levy . "
428853	428858	428874	428874	Squills	968	" Or the count , "
428867	428872	428874	428874	Squills	968	" Or Randal Leslie , "
428876	428899	428943	428943	his	420	" I should like to have a post - mortem cast of his head , - it would be an instructive study . "
428935	428938	428943	428943	his	420	" Silence ! "
428949	429053	429059	429059	Squills	968	" I can no more alter the fate allotted to each of the personages whom you honour with your interest than I can change your own ; like you , they must go where events lead there , urged on by their own characters and the agencies of others . Providence so pervadingly governs the universe , that you can not strike it even out of a book . The author may beget a character , but the moment the character comes into action , it escapes from his hands , - plays its own part , and fulfils its own inevitable doom . "
429054	429057	429059	429059	Squills	968	" Besides , "
429061	429235	429241	429242	my father	1479	" it is easy to see , from the phrenological development of the organs in those several heads which Pisistratus has allowed us to examine , that we have seen no creations of mere fiction , but living persons , whose true history has set in movement their various bumps of Amativeness , Constructiveness , Acquisitiveness , Idealty , Wonder , Comparison , etc . They must act , and they must end , according to the influences of their crania . Thus we find in Randal Leslie the predominant organs of Constructiveness , Secretiveness , Comparison , and Eventuality , while Benevolence , Conscientiousness , Adhesiveness , are utterly nil . Now , to divine how such a man must end , we must first see what is the general composition of the society in which he moves , in short , what other gases are brought into contact with his phlogiston . As to Leonard , and Harley , and Audley Egerton , surveying them phrenologically , I should say that - "
429236	429239	429241	429242	my father	1479	" Hush ! "
429244	429379	429388	429389	the captain	2114	" Pisistratus has dipped his pen in the ink , and it seems to me easier for the wisest man that ever lived to account for what others have done than to predict what they should do . Phrenologists discovered that Mr. Thurtell had a very fine organ of Conscientiousness ; yet , somehow or other , that erring personage contrived to knock the brains out of his friend 's organ of Individuality . Therefore I rise to propose a Resolution , - that this meeting be adjourned till Pisistratus has completed his narrative ; and we shall then have the satisfaction of knowing that it ought , according to every principle of nature , science , and art , to have been completed differently . Why should we deprive ourselves of that pleasure ? "
429380	429386	429388	429389	the captain	2114	" I second the motion , "
429391	429412	429422	429422	Blanche	411	" but if Levy be not hanged , I shall say that there is an end of all poetical justice . "
429413	429420	429422	429422	Blanche	411	" Take care of poor Helen , "
429426	429437	429459	429459	Blanche	411	" nor , that I would have you forget Violante . "
429438	429453	429657	429658	the reader	1785	" Pish ! and sit down , or they shall both die old maids . "
429575	429599	429657	429658	the reader	1785	" O testudinis aureae Dulcem quae strepitum , Pieri , temperas ! O mutis quoque piscibus Donatura cyeni , si libeat , sonum ! "
429600	429636	430112	430112	Randal	570	" O Muse , who dost temper the sweet sound of the golden shell of the tortoise , and couldst also give , were it needed , to silent fishes the song of the swan . "
430106	430110	430112	430112	Randal	570	" Your sister , "
430118	430172	430179	430180	the count	18827	" must be the active agent in the first and most difficult part of your enterprise . Violante can not be taken by force from Lord Lansmere 's , - she must be induced to leave it with her own consent . A female is needed here . Woman can best decoy woman . "
430173	430177	430179	430180	the count	18827	" Admirably said , "
430182	430265	430112	430112	Randal	570	" but Beatrice has grown restive , and though her dowry , and therefore her very marriage with that excellent young Hazeldean , depend on my own alliance with my fair kinswoman , she has grown so indifferent to my success that I dare not reckon on her aid . Between you and me , though she was once very eager to be married , she now seems to shrink from the notion ; and I have no other hold over her . "
430266	430284	430179	430180	the count	18827	" Has she not seen some one , and lately , whom she prefers to poor Frank ? "
430285	430305	430112	430112	Randal	570	" I suspect that she has ; but I know not whom , unless it be that detested L'Estrange . "
430306	430344	430353	430354	the count	18827	" Ah , well , well . Interfere with her no further yourself , but have all in readiness to quit England , as you had before proposed , as soon as Violante be in your power . "
430345	430351	430353	430354	the count	18827	" All is in readiness , "
430356	430466	430473	430473	Randal	570	" Levy has agreed to purchase a famous sailing - vessel of one of his clients . I have engaged a score or so of determined outcasts , accustomed to the sea , - Genoese , Corsicans , Sardinians , ex - Carbonari of the best sort , - no silly patriots , but liberal cosmopolitans , who have iron at the disposal of any man 's gold . I have a priest to perform the nuptial service , and deaf to any fair lady 's ' No . ' Once at sea , and wherever I land , Violante will lean on my arm as Countess of Peschiera . "
430467	430471	430486	430487	the count	18827	" But Violante , "
430495	430526	430537	430538	the count	18827	" but Violante can not be removed in broad daylight at once to such a vessel , nor from a quarter so populous as that in which your sister resides . "
430527	430535	430537	430538	the count	18827	" I have thought of that too , "
430540	430564	430576	430576	Randal	570	" my emissaries have found me a house close by the river , and safe for our purpose as the dungeons of Venice . "
430565	430574	430576	430576	Randal	570	" I wish not to know all this , "
430580	430689	430696	430700	the ci - devant solicitor	12288	" you will instruct Madame di Negra where to take Violante . - my task limits itself to the fair inventions that belong to intellect ; what belongs to force is not in my province . I will go at once to your sister , whom I think I can influence more effectually than you can ; though later I may give you a hint to guard against the chance of her remorse . Meanwhile as , the moment Violante disappears , suspicion would fall upon you , show yourself constantly in public surrounded by your friends . Be able to account for every hour of your time - "
430690	430694	430576	430576	Randal	570	" An alibi ? "
430702	430756	430787	430787	his	9106	" Exactly so , Baron . Complete the purchase of the vessel , and let the count man it as he proposes . I will communicate with you both as soon as I can put you into action . To - day I shall have much to do ; it will be done . "
430767	430781	430787	430787	his	9106	" What you propose to do will be well done , no doubt , "
430793	430843	430859	430859	Randal	570	" but take care that you do n't get yourself into a scrape , so as to damage your character . I have great hopes of you in public life ; and in public life character is necessary , - that is , so far as honour is concerned . "
430844	430857	430859	430859	Randal	570	" I damage my character ! - and for a Count Peschiera ! "
430865	430875	430894	430894	he	17518	" I ! What do you take me for ? "
430883	430892	431153	431153	he	570	" This boy ought to rise very high , "
431159	431192	431398	431398	Randal	570	" Violante is your rival . Violante removed , your beauty may find its natural effect ; if not , you are an Italian , and you will be at least avenged . "
431391	431396	431398	431398	Randal	570	" At the worst , "
431400	431421	431754	431754	Randal	570	" if it be not Harley , touch the chord of jealousy , and its vibration will direct me right . "
431758	431837	432367	432367	he	570	" If one whom you honour with a tender thought visits at Lord Lansmere 's house , you have , indeed , cause to fear for yourself , to hope for your brother 's success in the object which has brought him to England ; for a girl of surpassing beauty is a guest in Lord Lansmere 's house , and I will now tell you that that girl is she whom Count Peschiera would make his bride . "
432359	432365	432367	432367	he	570	" Alas ! I know , "
432369	432392	432329	432329	his	570	" that Peschiera has discovered your retreat , and surely she would be far less safe here than where she is now ! "
432393	432423	432367	432367	he	570	" But , diavolo ! you say the man has seen her where she is now , in spite of all Lady Lansmere 's promises and Harley 's precautions . "
432424	432633	432794	432794	he	1694	" True . Of this Peschiera boasted to me . He effected it not , of course , openly , but in some disguise . I am sufficiently , however , in his confidence - any man may be that with so audacious a braggart - to deter him from renewing his attempt for some days . Meanwhile , I or yourself will leave discovered some surer home than this , to which you can remove , and then will be the proper time to take back your daughter . And for the present , if you will send by me a letter to enjoin her to receive me as her future bridegroom , it will necessarily divert all thought at once from the count ; I shall be able to detect by the manner in which she receives me , how far the count has overstated the effect he pretends to have produced . You can give me also a letter to Lady Lansmere , to prevent your daughter coming hither . Oh , sir , do not reason with me . Have indulgence for my lover 's fears . Believe that I advise for the best . Have I not the keenest interest to do so ? "
432812	432833	432841	432841	Randal	570	" There , that will give us time ; and I will send to Lord L'Estrange and talk to him . "
432834	432839	432841	432841	Randal	570	" My noble friend , "
432845	432882	432794	432794	he	1694	" may I entreat you not to see Lord L'Estrange until at least I have pleaded my cause to your daughter , - until , indeed , she is no longer under his father 's roof ? "
432883	432887	432841	432841	Randal	570	" And why ? "
432888	432934	432794	432794	he	1694	" Because I presume that you are sincere when you deign to receive me as a son - in - law , and because I am sure that Lord L'Estrange would hear with distaste of your disposition in my favour . Am I not right ? "
432939	433038	432794	432794	he	1694	" And though his arguments would fail with a man of your honour and discernment , they might have more effect on the young mind of your child . Think , I beseech you , the more she is set against me , the more accessible she may be to the arts of Peschiera . Speak not , therefore , I implore you , to Lord L'Estrange till Violante has accepted my hand , or at least until she is again under your charge ; otherwise take back your letter , - it would be of no avail . "
433039	433073	432794	432794	he	1694	" Perhaps you are right . Certainly Lord L'Estrange is prejudiced against you ; or rather , he thinks too much of what I have been , too little of what I am . "
433074	433089	433412	433412	she	800	" Who can see you , and not do so ? I pardon him . "
433418	433459	433496	433496	she	800	" If she loved him , I could be consoled ; but she does not ! or how could she have spoken to me so calmly ! how could her very looks have been so sad ! Heartless ! heartless ! "
433488	433495	433496	433496	she	800	" Am I grown so mean ? "
433509	433521	433590	433590	Randal	570	" Can so short a time alter one thus ? Impossible ! "
433575	433588	433590	433590	Randal	570	" I have a letter to you from your father , Signorina , "
433592	433615	433645	433645	he	570	" but before I give it to your hands , some explanation is necessary . Condescend , then , to hear me . "
433658	433753	433773	433773	He	570	" I know that you were born to princely fortunes ; and the excuse for my addressing you now is , that your birthright is lost to you , at least unless you can consent to a union with the man who has despoiled you of your heritage , - a union which your father would deem dishonour to yourself and him . Signorina , I might have presumed to love you , but I should not have named that love , had your father not encouraged me by his assent to my suit . "
433797	433912	433977	433978	the girl	5469	" The man of whom I spoke is in pursuit of you . I have cause to believe that this person has already intruded himself upon you . Ah , your countenance owns it ; you have seen Peschiera ? This house is , then , less safe than your father deemed it . No house is safe for you but a husband 's . I offer to you my name , - it is a gentleman 's ; my fortune , which is small ; the participation in my hopes of the future , which are large . I place now your father 's letter in your hand , and await your answer . "
433984	434066	434100	434100	she	800	" My child , receive with favour Mr. Leslie . He has my consent to address you as a suitor . Circumstances of which it is needless now to inform you render it essential to my very peace and happiness that your marriage should be immediate . In a word , I have given my promise to Mr. Leslie , and I confidently leave it to the daughter of my House to redeem the pledge of her anxious and tender father . "
434091	434098	434109	434109	Randal	570	" I can not marry you , "
434104	434107	434109	434109	Randal	570	" Indeed ? "
434113	434123	434075	434075	Randal	570	" Is it because you can not love me ? "
434124	434127	434109	434109	Randal	570	" Yes . "
434128	434164	434075	434075	Randal	570	" I did not expect that you would as yet , and I still persist in my suit . I have promised to your father that I would not recede before your first unconsidered refusal . "
434165	434175	434109	434109	Randal	570	" I will go to my father at once . "
434176	434247	434075	434075	Randal	570	" Does he request you to do so in his letter ? Look again . Pardon me , but he foresaw your impetuosity ; and I have another note for Lady Lansmere , in which he begs her ladyship not to sanction your return to him should you so wish until he come or send for you himself . He will do so whenever your word has redeemed his own . "
434248	434266	434267	434267	Randal	570	" And do you dare to talk to me thus , and yet pretend to love me ? "
434271	434324	434109	434109	Randal	570	" I pretend but to we d you . Love is a subject on which I might have spoken formerly , or may speak hereafter . I give you some little time to consider . When I next call , let me hope that we may fix the day for our wedding . "
434325	434328	434267	434267	Randal	570	" Never ! "
434329	434370	434109	434109	Randal	570	" You will be , then , the first daughter of your House who disobeyed a father ; and you will have this additional crime ; that you disobeyed him in his sorrow , his exile , and his fall . "
434376	434385	434109	434109	Randal	570	" Is there no choice , no escape ? "
434386	434530	434109	434109	Randal	570	" I see none for either . Listen to me . I love you , it is true ; but it is not for my happiness to marry one who dislikes me , nor for my ambition to connect myself with one whose poverty is greater than my own . I marry but to keep my plighted faith with your father , and to save you from a villain you would hate more than myself , and from whom no walls are a barrier , no laws a defence . One person , indeed , might perhaps have preserved you from the misery you seem to anticipate with me ; that person might defeat the plans of your father 's foe , - effect , it might be , terms which could revoke his banishment and restore his honours ; that person is - "
434531	434535	434542	434542	Randal	570	" Lord L'Estrange ? "
434536	434540	434542	434542	Randal	570	" Lord L'Estrange ! "
434557	434572	434586	434586	she	800	" Lord L'Estrange ! What could he do ? Why did you name him ? "
434577	434584	434109	434109	Randal	570	" He saved my father once , "
434590	434705	434713	434713	Violante	800	" And has interfered , and trifled , and promised , Heaven knows what , ever since : yet to what end ? Pooh ! The person I speak of your father would not consent to see , would not believe if he saw her ; yet she is generous , noble , could sympathize with you both . She is the sister of your father 's enemy , the Marchesa di Negra . I am convinced that she has great influence with her brother , - that she has known enough of his secrets to awe him into renouncing all designs on yourself ; but it is idle now to speak of her . "
434706	434711	434713	434713	Violante	800	" No , no , "
434715	434727	434109	434109	Randal	570	" Tell me where she lives - I will see her . "
434728	434800	434883	434883	she	8099	" Pardon me , I can not obey you ; and , indeed , her own pride is now aroused by your father 's unfortunate prejudices against her . It is too late to count upon her aid . You turn from me , - my presence is unwelcome . I rid you of it now . But welcome or unwelcome , later you must endure it - and for life . "
434878	434881	434894	434894	Randal	570	" Strange ! "
434889	434892	434894	434894	Randal	570	" Strange ! "
434896	434916	434922	434923	the countess	8099	" that a man like your correspondent should fear one like the Count di Peschiera . Is that it ? "
434917	434920	434922	434923	the countess	8099	" Sir , "
434943	434943	434952	434952	Randal	570	"
434944	434950	434955	434955	his	570	" I do n't know , "
434960	434988	434994	434995	Lady Lansmere	822	" I fear many men , and I know many who ought to fear me ; yet at every turn of the street one meets a policeman ! "
434989	434992	434994	434995	Lady Lansmere	822	" Yes , "
434997	435034	435070	435072	Madame di Negra	473	" But to suppose that this profligate foreigner could carry away a girl like Violante against her will , - a man she has never seen , and whom she must have been taught to hate ! "
435035	435061	435098	435099	the squire	1498	" Be on your guard , nevertheless , I pray you , madam ; ' Where there 's a will there 's a way ' ! "
435093	435096	435116	435116	he	1498	" Randal , "
435126	435166	435226	435227	The squire	1498	" Randal , you have nothing now to do in London ; can you come and stay with me , and take to farming ? I remember that you showed a good deal of sound knowledge about thin sowing . "
435167	435186	435116	435116	he	1498	" My dear sir , I will come to you as soon as the general election is over . "
435187	435201	435226	435227	The squire	1498	" What the deuce have you got to do with the general election ? "
435202	435225	435226	435227	The squire	1498	" Mr. Egerton has some wish that I should enter parliament ; indeed , negotiations for that purpose are now on foot . "
435232	435244	435256	435256	Randal	570	" I do n't like my half - brother 's politics . "
435245	435254	435256	435256	Randal	570	" I shall be quite independent of them , "
435260	435271	435116	435116	he	1498	" that independence is the condition for which I stipulate . "
435272	435298	435309	435309	Randal	570	" Glad to hear it ; and if you do come into parliament , I hope you 'll not turn your back on the land ? "
435299	435307	435309	435309	Randal	570	" Turn my back on the land ! "
435315	435326	435116	435116	he	1498	" Oh , sir , I am not so unnatural ! "
435327	435337	435116	435116	he	1498	" That 's the right way to put it , "
435343	435366	435383	435383	Randal	570	" it is unnatural ! It is turning one 's back on one 's own mother . The land is a mother - "
435367	435381	435383	435383	Randal	570	" To those who live by her , certainly , - a mother , "
435387	435414	435422	435423	the squire	1498	" And though , indeed , my father starves by her rather than lives , and Rood Hall is not like Hazeldean , still - I - "
435415	435420	435422	435423	the squire	1498	" Hold your tongue , "
435425	435439	435383	435383	Randal	570	" I want to talk to you . Your grandmother was a Hazeldean . "
435440	435459	435465	435466	the squire	1498	" Her picture is in the drawing - room at Rood . People think me very like her . "
435460	435463	435465	435466	the squire	1498	" Indeed ! "
435468	435514	435465	435466	the squire	1498	" The Hazeldeans are generally inclined to be stout and rosy , which you are certainly not . But no fault of yours . We are all as Heaven made us . However , to the point . I am going to alter my will , "
435522	435535	435383	435383	Randal	570	" This is the rough draft for the lawyers to work upon . "
435536	435566	435465	435466	the squire	1498	" Pray , pray , sir , do not speak to me on such a subject . I can not bear to contemplate even the possibility of - of - "
435567	435609	435383	435383	Randal	570	" My death ? Ha , ha ! Nonsense . My own son calculated on the date of it by the insurance - tables . Ha , ha , ha ! A very fashionable son , eh ! Ha , ha ! "
435610	435646	435654	435655	the squire	1498	" Poor Frank ! do not let him suffer for a momentary forgetfulness of right feeling . When he comes to be married to that foreign lady , and be a father himself , he - "
435647	435651	435654	435655	the squire	1498	" Father himself ! "
435657	435703	435711	435711	Randal	570	" Father to a swarm of sallow - faced Popish tadpoles ! No foreign frogs shall hop about my grave in Hazeldean churchyard . No , no . But you need not look so reproachful , - I ' m not going to disinherit Frank . "
435704	435709	435383	435383	Randal	570	" Of course not , "
435734	435833	435842	435842	Randal	570	" No ; I shall leave him the life - interest in the greater part of the property ; but if he marry a foreigner , her children will not succeed , - you will stand after him in that case . But - now do n't interrupt me - but Frank looks as if he would live longer than you , so small thanks to me for my good intentions , you may say . I mean to do more for you than a mere barren place in the entail . What do you say to marrying ? "
435834	435840	435383	435383	Randal	570	" Just as you please , "
435846	435935	435954	435954	Randal	570	" Good . There 's Miss Sticktorights disengaged , - great heiress . Her lands run onto Rood . At one time I thought of her for that graceless puppy of mine . But I can manage more easily to make up the match for you . There 's a mortgage on the property ; old Sticktorights would be very glad to pay it off . I 'll pay it out of the Hazeldean estate , and give up the Right of Way into the bargain . You understand ?
435936	435953	436117	436118	the squire	1498	" So come down as soon as you can , and court the young lady yourself . "
436125	436137	436143	436144	the squire	1498	" Better say nothing about it either to Levy or Thornhill . "
436138	436141	436143	436144	the squire	1498	" Right , "
436146	436208	436263	436263	Egerton	500	" No proprietor likes to sell to another proprietor , in the same shire , as largely acred as himself : it spoils the balance of power . See to the business yourself ; and if I can help you with the purchase after that boy is married , - I can attend to nothing before , why , I will . "
436250	436261	436263	436263	Egerton	500	" I may go abroad if I lose my election , "
436277	436302	436313	436313	Randal	570	" and if I do not lose it , still , now I am out of office , I shall live much in private . "
436303	436311	436263	436263	Egerton	500	" Do I disturb you , sir ? "
436317	436325	436361	436363	The house steward	12387	" No ; I have just done . "
436381	436384	436448	436448	Egerton	500	" Times , "
436430	436446	436448	436448	Egerton	500	" I have settled with our committee ; and , with Lord Lansmere 's consent , "
436452	436551	436566	436566	Randal	570	" you will stand for the borough , as we proposed , in conjunction with myself . And should any accident happen to me , - that is , should I vacate this seat from any cause , - you may succeed to it , very shortly perhaps . Ingratiate yourself with the electors , and speak at the public - houses for both of us . I shall stand on my dignity , and leave the work of the election to you . No thanks , - you know how I hate thanks . Good - night . "
436552	436564	436566	436566	Randal	570	" I never stood so near to fortune and to power , "
436573	436597	436729	436729	she	800	" And I owe it but to knowledge , - knowledge of men , life , of all that books can teach us . "
436719	436728	436696	436697	Lady Lausmere	1366	" Do you know the Marchesa di Negra ? "
436737	436746	436755	436755	Violante	800	" A little . Why do you ask ? "
436747	436753	436755	436755	Violante	800	" That is my secret , "
436768	436785	436696	436697	Lady Lausmere	1366	" But , tell me , do you think better of her than of her brother ? "
436786	436806	436755	436755	Violante	800	" Certainly . I believe her heart to be good , and that she is not without generous qualities . "
436807	436827	436841	436841	Harley	503	" Can you not induce my father to see her ? Would you not counsel him to do so ? "
436828	436839	436841	436841	Harley	503	" Any wish of yours is a law to me , "
436845	436880	436755	436755	Violante	800	" You wish your father to see her ? I will try and persuade him to do so . Now , in return , confide to me your secret . What is your object ? "
436881	436931	437003	437003	Harley	503	" Leave to return to my Italy . I care not for honours , for rank ; and even my father has ceased to regret their loss . But the land , the native land - Oh , to see it once more ! Oh , to die there ! "
436932	437001	437063	437063	he	503	" Die ! You children have so lately left heaven , that ye talk as if ye could return there , without passing through the gates of sorrow , infirmity , and age ! But I thought you were content with England . Why so eager to leave it ? Violante , you are unkind to us , - to Helen , who already loves you so well . "
437052	437061	437043	437043	Harley	503	" Is she not changed - your friend ? "
437068	437091	437097	437097	Harley	503	" Yes , lately ; much changed . I fear there is something on her mind , - I know not what . "
437092	437095	437097	437097	Harley	503	" Ah , "
437099	437133	437147	437147	Harley	503	" it may be so ; but at your age and hers , nothing rests on the mind long . Observe , I say the mind , - the heart is more tenacious . "
437141	437145	437147	437147	Harley	503	" And therefore , "
437153	437219	437227	437227	Helen	894	" we can detect when something is on the mind , - some care , some fear , some trouble . But when the heart closes over its own more passionate sorrow , who can discover , who conjecture ? Yet you at least , my pure , candid Helen , - you might subject mind and heart alike to the fabled window of glass . "
437220	437225	437271	437271	He	503	" Oh , no ! "
437231	437270	437572	437572	Harley	503	" Oh , yes ! Do not let me think that you have one secret I may not know , or one sorrow I may not share . For , in our relationship , that would be deceit . "
437598	437600	437636	437638	a female figure	12406	" Beatrice "
437666	437689	437715	437715	she	800	" It is you ! I was truly told . Beautiful ! beautiful ! And oh ! what youth and what bloom ! "
437722	437748	437758	437758	Beatrice	1130	" You are , I presume , the Marchesa di Negra ? And I have heard of you enough to induce me to trust you . "
437749	437756	437715	437715	she	800	" Of me ! From whom ? "
437763	437772	437715	437715	she	800	" From Mr Leslie , and - and - "
437773	437780	437715	437715	she	800	" Go on ; why falter ? "
437781	437786	437715	437715	she	800	" From Lord L'Estrange . "
437787	437793	437715	437715	she	800	" From no one else ? "
437794	437800	437847	437847	Beatrice	1130	" Not that I remember . "
437838	437845	437847	437847	Beatrice	1130	" We can not talk here , "
437851	437903	437922	437922	her	1130	" and I have so much to say , so much to know . Trust me yet more ; it is for yourself I speak . My carriage waits yonder . Come home with me , - I will not detain you an hour ; and I will bring you back . "
437950	438039	438072	438072	Beatrice	1130	" I , too , would once have recoiled from one step beyond the formal line by which the world divides liberty from woman . Now see how bold I am . Child , child , do not trifle with your destiny . You may never again have the same occasion offered to you . It is not only to meet you that I am here ; I must know something of you , - something of your heart . Why shrink ? Is not the heart pure ? "
438061	438070	438072	438072	Beatrice	1130	" I may restore to Italy your father , "
438079	438082	438083	438083	Violante	800	" Come ! "
438090	438098	438046	438046	her	800	" Not by union with your brother ? "
438099	438107	438083	438083	Violante	800	" You dread that so much then ? "
438108	438146	438216	438216	Violante	800	" Dread it ? No . Why should I dread what is in my power to reject . But if you can really restore my father , and by nobler means , you may save me for - "
438157	438215	438247	438247	Violante	800	" Save you for - ah ! I can guess what you leave unsaid . But come , come ! more strangers , see ; you shall tell me all at my own house . And if you can make one sacrifice , why , I will save you all else . Come , or farewell forever ! "
438239	438245	438247	438247	Violante	800	" We are women both , "
438249	438277	438284	438284	Beatrice	1130	" we descend from the same noble House ; we have knelt alike to the same Virgin Mother ; why should I not believe and trust you ? "
438278	438282	438399	438399	she	800	" Why not ? "
438391	438397	438399	438399	she	800	" Are you in pain ? "
438408	438420	438402	438402	her	800	" or can I serve you as you would serve me ? "
438421	438460	438499	438499	Beatrice	1130	" Child , give me your hand , and be silent while I look at you . Was I ever so fair as this ? Never ! And what deeps - what deeps roll between her and me ! "
438504	438512	438531	438531	Violante	800	" No , it shall not be ! "
438523	438529	438556	438556	she	1130	" What shall not be ? "
438552	438555	438556	438556	she	1130	" Stay , "
438560	438660	438784	438784	she	1130	" As you say , we are both women of the same noble House ; you would reject the suit of my brother , yet you have seen him ; his the form to please the eye , his the arts that allure the fancy . He offers to you rank , wealth , your father 's pardon and recall . If I could remove the objections which your father entertains , prove that the count has less wronged him than he deems , would you still reject the rank and the wealth and the hand of Giulio Franzini ? "
438661	438675	438556	438556	she	1130	" Oh , yes , yes ; were his hand a king 's ! "
438676	438730	438784	438784	she	1130	" Still , then , as woman to woman - both , as you say , akin , and sprung from the same lineage - still , then , answer me , answer me , for you speak to one who has loved - Is it not that you love another ? Speak . "
438731	438764	438816	438816	Beatrice	1130	" I do not know . Nay , not love , - it was a romance ; it is a thing impossible . Do not question , - I can not answer . "
438810	438814	438816	438816	Beatrice	1130	" Drive on , "
438818	438824	438925	438925	she	800	" as you were directed . "
438917	438924	438925	438925	she	800	" Do you live so far ? "
438944	438962	438925	438925	she	800	" I shall be missed already . Oh , let us turn back , I beseech you ! "
438963	439029	439053	439053	she	800	" We are nearly there now . The driver has taken this road in order to avoid those streets in which we might have been seen together , - perhaps by my brother himself . Listen to me , and talk of - of the lover whom you rightly associate with a vain romance . ' Impossible , ' - yes , it is impossible ! "
439044	439051	439053	439053	she	800	" Why are you so cruel ? "
439055	439084	438925	438925	she	800	" This is not what you promised . How are you to serve my father , how restore him to his country ? This is what you promised ! "
439085	439103	439215	439215	she	1130	" If you consent to one sacrifice , I will fulfil that promise . We are arrived . "
439204	439213	439215	439215	she	1130	" Now , here we shall be secure , "
439217	439230	439257	439257	Beatrice	1130	" and here a few minutes may suffice to decide your fate . "
439260	439266	439286	439286	he	12443	" Let the carriage wait . "
439301	439316	439860	439861	Lady Lansmere	822	" Back to the count , and say , ' All is safe . ' "
439855	439858	439860	439861	Lady Lansmere	822	" Ah , "
439863	439887	439904	439904	he	12477	" Mr. Leslie may know something . He came to her yesterday with a note from her father . Pray let him enter . "
439894	439903	439904	439904	he	12477	" I will wait in the next room , "
439907	439923	439938	439938	Leonard	450	" You may want me if you have cause to suspect Peschiera in all this . "
439942	439981	439924	439925	Lady Lansmere	822	" Perhaps you , too , sir , may kindly aid us , if you would retire with the prince . Mr. Leslie may be disinclined to speak of affairs like these , except to Harley and myself . "
439982	439993	440088	440088	Harley	503	" True , madam , but beware of Mr. Leslie . "
440020	440087	440143	440143	Randal	570	" I have just been to your house , Lady Lansmere . I heard you were here ; pardon me if I have followed you . I have called at Knightsbridge to see Violante , learned that she had left you . I implore you to tell me how or wherefore . I have the right to ask : her father has promised me her hand . "
440148	440165	440126	440126	he	5338	" And has she not gone to her father 's ? Are you sure of that ? "
440166	440177	440208	440208	Randal	570	" Her father 's servant has just come from Norwood . "
440178	440207	440208	440208	Randal	570	" Oh , I am to blame for this ! It is my rash suit , her fear of it , her aversion ! I see it all ! "
440218	440283	440296	440297	Lady Lansmere	822	" To save her from Peschiera , her father insisted on her immediate marriage with myself . His orders were too abrupt , my own wooing too unwelcome . I knew her high spirit ; she has fled to escape from me . But whither , if not to Norwood , - oh , whither ? What other friends has she , what relations ? "
440284	440294	440296	440297	Lady Lansmere	822	" You throw a new light on this mystery , "
440299	440334	440208	440208	Randal	570	" perhaps she may have gone to her father 's after all , and the servant may have crossed , but missed her on the way . I will drive to Norwood at once . "
440335	440384	440400	440400	Harley	503	" Do so , - do ; but if she be not there , be careful not to alarm Riccabocca with the news of her disappearance . Caution Giacomo not to do so . He would only suspect Peschiera , and be hurried to some act of violence . "
440385	440398	440208	440208	Randal	570	" Do not you , then , suspect Peschiera , Mr. Leslie ? "
440404	440463	440482	440482	Harley	503	" Ha ! is it possible ? Yet , no . I called on him this morning with Frank Hazeldean , who is to marry his sister . I was with him till I went on to Knightsbridge , at the very time of Violante 's disappearance . He could not then have been a party to it . "
440464	440480	440506	440506	he	503	" You saw Violante yesterday . Did you speak to her of Madame di Negra ? "
440510	440548	440208	440208	Randal	570	" Of Madame di Negra ? I do not think so . Yet I might . Oh , yes , I remember now . She asked me the marchesa 's address ; I would not give it . "
440549	440566	440578	440578	Randal	570	" The address is easily found . Can she have gone to the marchesa 's house ? "
440567	440576	440578	440578	Randal	570	" I will run there , and see , "
440583	440653	440804	440804	Harley	503	" And I with you . Stay , my dear mother . Proceed , as you propose , to Norwood , and take Mr. Leslie 's advice . Spare our friend the news of his daughter 's loss - if lost she be - till she is restored to him . He can be of no use mean while . Let Giacomo rest here ; I may want him . "
440812	440824	440794	440794	Randal	570	" Now , Mr. Leslie , what do you advise next ? "
440825	440911	440804	440804	Harley	503	" I am at a loss . Ah , perhaps , afraid of her father , knowing how despotic is his belief in paternal rights , and how tenacious he is of his word once passed , as it has been to me , she may have resolved to take refuge in the country , perhaps at the Casino , or at Mrs. Dale 's , or Mrs. Hazeldean 's . I will hasten to inquire at the coach - office . Meanwhile , you - "
440912	440953	440794	440794	Randal	570	" Never mind me , Mr. Leslie . Do what you think best . But , if your surmises be just , you must have been a very rude wooer to the high - born lady you aspired to win . "
440954	440994	440804	440804	Harley	503	" Not so ; but perhaps an unwelcome one . If she has indeed fled from me , need I say that my suit will be withdrawn at once ? I am not a selfish lover , Lord L'Estrange . "
440995	441049	441063	441063	his	570	" Nor I a vindictive man . Yet , could I discover who has conspired against this lady , a guest under my father 's roof , I would crush him into the mire as easily as I set my foot upon this glove . Good - day to you , Mr. Leslie . "
441070	441087	441233	441233	Frank	449	" Insolent ! But does he love her ? If so , I am avenged already . "
441192	441232	441252	441252	Harley	503	" I may lose all if I show that I suspect him ; and yet I must insult and fight him rather than leave his movements free . Ah , is that young Hazeldean ? A thought strikes me ! "
441268	441292	441252	441252	Harley	503	" Mr. Hazeldean , your uncle Egerton is my dearest friend . Will you be a friend to me ? I want you . "
441293	441297	441252	441252	Harley	503	" My Lord - "
441298	441312	441436	441436	he	449	" Follow me . Do not let Count Peschiera see us talking together . "
441448	441555	441436	441436	he	449	" Believe me , Lord L'Estrange , if I can assist you in defeating a base and mercenary design against this poor young lady , you have but to show me how . One thing is clear , Peschicra was not personally engaged in this abduction , since I have been with him all day ; and - now I think of it - I begin to hope that you wrong him ; for he has invited a large party of us to make an excursion with him to Boulogne next week , in order to try his yacht , which he could scarcely do if - "
441556	441577	441436	441436	he	449	" Yacht , at this time of the year ! a man who habitually resides at Vienna - a yacht ! "
441578	441626	441436	441436	he	449	" Spendquick sells it a bargain , on account of the time of year and other reasons ; and the count proposes to spend next summer in cruising about the Ionian Isles . He has some property on those isles , which he has never yet visited . "
441627	441638	441436	441436	he	449	" How long is it since he bought this yacht ? "
441639	441679	441436	441436	he	449	" Why , I am not sure that it is already bought , - that is , paid for . Levy was to meet Spendquick this very morning to arrange the matter . Spendquick complains that Levy screws him . "
441680	441701	441436	441436	he	449	" My dear Mr. Hazeldean , you are guiding me through the maze . Where shall I find Lord Spendquick ? "
441702	441716	441436	441436	he	449	" At this hour , probably in bed . Here is his card . "
441717	441726	441436	441436	he	449	" Thanks . And where lies the vessel ? "
441727	441757	441436	441436	he	449	" It was off Blackwall the other day . I went to see it , ' The Flying Dutchman , ' - a fine vessel , and carries guns . "
441758	441849	441857	441857	Frank	449	" Enough . Now , heed me . There can be no immediate danger to Violante , so long as Peschiera does not meet her , so long as we know his movements . You are about to marry his sister . Avail yourself of that privilege to keep close by his side . Refuse to be shaken off . Make what excuses for the present your invention suggests . I will give you an excuse . Be anxious and uneasy to know where you can find Madame di Negra . "
441850	441855	441857	441857	Frank	449	" Madame di Negra ! "
441859	441871	441436	441436	he	449	" What of her ? Is she not in Curzon Street ? "
441872	442008	442014	442014	Frank	449	" No ; she has gone out in one of the count 's carriages . In all probability the driver of that carriage , or some servant in attendance on it , will come to the count in the course of the day ; and in order to get rid of you , the count will tell you to see this servant , and ascertain yourself that his sister is safe . Pretend to believe what the man says , but make him come to your lodgings on pretence of writing there a letter for the marchesa . Once at your lodgings , and he will be safe ; for I shall see that the officers of justice secure him . The moment he is there , send an express for me to my hotel . "
442009	442012	442014	442014	Frank	449	" But , "
442020	442035	441436	441436	he	449	" if I go to my lodgings , how can I watch the count ? "
442036	442062	442014	442014	Frank	449	" It will nor then be necessary . Only get him to accompany you to your lodgings , and part with him at the door . "
442063	442122	442179	442179	Frank	449	" Stop , stop ! you can not suspect Madame di Negra of connivance in a scheme so infamous . Pardon me , Lord L'Estrange ; I can not act in this matter , - can not even hear you except as your foe , if you insinuate a word against the honour of the woman I love . "
442123	442178	442250	442250	Leonard	450	" Brave gentleman , your hand . It is Madame di Negra I would save , as well as my friend 's young child . Think but of her , while you act as I entreat , and all will go well . I confide in you . Now , return to the count . "
442261	442291	442301	442301	Leonard	450	" Come with me , both of you . You , too , Giacomo . I must now see the police . We may then divide upon separate missions . "
442292	442299	442301	442301	Leonard	450	" Oh , my dear Lord , "
442303	442317	442250	442250	Leonard	450	" you must have had good news . You seem cheerful and sanguine . "
442318	442375	442692	442692	she	1130	" Seem ! Nay , I am so ! If I once paused to despond - even to doubt - I should go mad . A foe to baffle , and an angel to save ! Whose spirits would not rise high , whose wits would not move quick to the warm pulse of his heart ? "
442685	442691	442692	442692	she	1130	" I have deceived you ! "
442699	442813	443241	443241	he	17342	" but I will now save you at any cost . Had you been as I deemed , - the rival who had despoiled all the hopes of my future life , - I could without remorse have been the accomplice I am pledged to be . But now you - Oh , you , so good and so noble - you can never , be the bride of Peschiera . Nay , start not ; he shall renounce his designs forever , or I will go myself to our emperor , and expose the dark secrets of his life . Return with me quick to the home from which I ensnared you . "
443235	443239	443241	443241	he	17342	" Fair kinswoman , "
443252	443335	443233	443233	Violante	800	" there are things which no man can excuse , and no woman can pardon , unless that love , which is beyond all laws , suggests excuse for the one , and obtains pardon for the other . In a word , I have sworn to win you , and I have had no opportunities to woo . Fear not ; the worst that can befall you is to be my bride ! Stand aside , my sister , stand aside . "
443336	443365	443241	443241	he	17342	" Giulio Franzini , I stand between you and her ; you shall strike me to the earth before you can touch even the hem of her robe ! "
443366	443377	443233	443233	Violante	800	" What , my sister ! you turn against me ? "
443378	443397	443241	443241	he	17342	" And unless you instantly retire and leave her free , I will unmask you to the emperor . "
443398	443449	443504	443504	he	12543	" Too late , mon enfant ! You will sail with us . The effects you may need for the voyage are already on board . You will be witness to our marriage , and by a holy son of the Church . Then tell the emperor what you will . "
443496	443502	443504	443504	he	12543	" You scorn me now , "
443517	443556	443562	443562	Violante	800	" and I can not wonder at it . But , believe me , that until the scorn yield to a kinder sentiment , I will take no advantage of the power I have gained over your fate . "
443557	443560	443562	443562	Violante	800	" Power ! "
443566	443594	443504	443504	he	12543	" You have ensnared me into this house , you have gained the power of a day ; but the power over my fate , - no ! "
443595	443711	443720	443720	Beatrice	1130	" You mean that your friends have discovered your disappearance , and are on your track . Fair one , I provide against your friends , and I defy all the laws and police of England . The vessel that will bear you from these shores waits in the river hard by . Beatrice , I warn you , - be still , unhand me . In that vessel will be a priest who shall join our hands , but not before you will recognize the truth , that she who flies with Giulio Peschiera must become his wife or quit him as the disgrace of her House , and the scorn of her sex . "
443712	443718	443720	443720	Beatrice	1130	" O villain ! villain ! "
443722	443763	443870	443870	his	14948	" Peste , my sister , gentler words . You , too , would marry . I tell no tales of you . Signorina , I grieve to threaten force . Give me your hand ; we must be gone . "
443858	443861	443870	443870	his	14948	" Hist ! "
443875	443906	443981	443981	he	18827	" in this house you are in that ruffian 's power ; out of it , safe . Ah , I am by your side , - I , Violante ! "
443973	443980	443981	443981	he	18827	" Ha , that is well ! "
443990	444044	444740	444741	the man	14948	" Bear the lady after me , gently ; but if she attempt to cry out , why , force enough to silence her , not more . As for you , Beatrice , traitress that you are , I could strike you to the earth , but - No , this suffices . "
444733	444738	444740	444741	the man	14948	" Pardon , Excellency , "
444746	444766	444871	444878	the sailor who had stood by the plank	12614	" but the boat is crowded , and rocks so much that your aid would but disturb our footing . "
444866	444869	444871	444878	the sailor who had stood by the plank	12614	" Silence , "
444880	444913	445124	445125	the traitor	18052	" we obey orders . If you are not quiet , we shall upset the boat . We can swim ; Heaven and Monsignore San Giacomo pity you if you can not ! "
445116	445123	445194	445194	he	503	" Il traditore ! il traditore ! "
445187	445193	445194	445194	he	503	" What trick is this ? "
445202	445219	445229	445229	Harley	503	" I divine that it is you whom I can single out for explanation and atonement . "
445220	445227	445229	445229	Harley	503	" Pardieu , Monsieur le Comte , "
445250	445278	445285	445286	the count	18827	" let us distinguish . Explanation should come from me , I allow ; but atonement I have the honour to resign to yourself . This vessel - "
445279	445283	445285	445286	the count	18827	" Is mine ! "
445288	445302	445229	445229	Harley	503	" Those men , who insult me , should be in my pay . "
445303	445475	445285	445286	the count	18827	" The men in your pay , Monsieur le Comte , are on shore , drinking success to your voyage . But , anxious still to procure you the gratification of being amongst your own countrymen , those whom I have taken into my pay are still better Italians than the pirates whose place they supply ; perhaps not such good sailors ; but then I have taken the liberty to add to the equipment of a vessel which cost me too much to risk lightly , some stout English seamen , who are mariners more practised than even your pirates . Your grand mistake , Monsieur le Comte , is in thinking that the ' Flying Dutchman ' is yours . With many apologies for interfering with your intention to purchase it , I beg to inform you that Lord Spendquick has kindly sold it to me . Nevertheless , Monsieur le Comte , for the next few weeks I place it - men and all - at your service . "
445480	445573	445229	445229	Harley	503	" I thank your Lordship ; but since I presume that I shall no longer have the travelling companion who alone could make the voyage attractive , I shall return to shore , and will simply request you to inform me at what hour you can receive the friend whom I shall depute to discuss that part of the question yet untouched , and to arrange that the atonement , whether it be due from me or yourself , may be rendered as satisfactory as you have condescended to make the explanation . "
445574	445775	445786	445788	the Austrian prince	12477	" Let not that vex you , Monsieur le Comte ; the atonement is , in much , made already ; so anxious have I been to forestall all that your nice sense of honour would induce so complete a gentleman to desire . You have ensnared a young heiress , it is true ; but you see that it was only to restore her to the arms of her father . You have juggled an illustrious kinsman out of his heritage ; but you have voluntarily come on board this vessel , first , to enable his Highness the Prince Von - - - , of whose rank at the Austrian Court you are fully aware , to state to your emperor that he himself has been witness of the manner in which you interpreted his Imperial Majesty 's assent to your nuptials with a child of one of the first subjects in his Italian realm ; and , next , to commence by an excursion to the seas of the Baltic the sentence of banishment which I have no doubt will accompany the same act that restores to the chief of your House his lands and his honours . "
445780	445784	445786	445788	the Austrian prince	12477	" That restoration , "
445798	445897	445909	445909	Harley	503	" I already guarantee . Disgrace that you are , Giulio Franzini , to the nobles of the Empire , I will not leave my royal master till his hand strike your name from the roll . I have here your own letters , to prove that your kinsman was duped by yourself into the revolt which you would have headed as a Catiline , if it had not better suited your nature to betray it as a Judas . In ten days from this time , these letters will be laid before the emperor and his Council . "
445898	445907	445909	445909	Harley	503	" Are you satisfied , Monsieur le Comte , "
445911	445999	446040	446041	those Italians	12635	" with your atonement so far ? If not , I have procured you the occasion to render it yet more complete . Before you stands the kinsman you have wronged . He knows now , that though , for a while , you ruined his fortunes , you failed to sully his hearth . His heart can grant you pardon , and hereafter his hand may give you alms . Kneel then , Giulio Franzini , kneel at the feet of Alphonso , Duke of Serrano . "
446045	446064	446161	446161	he	12637	" Alphonso the Good ! Alphonso the Good ! Viva , viva , the good Duke of Serrano ! "
446155	446160	446161	446161	he	12637	" Thanks , thanks , "
446164	446184	446206	446209	the Duke of Serrano	12643	" thanks ! Some day or other , you will all perhaps return with me to the beloved land ! "
446200	446204	446206	446209	the Duke of Serrano	12643	" Giulio Franzini , "
446226	446280	446343	446343	he	15449	" had this last villanous design of yours been allowed by Providence , think you that there is one spot on earth on which the ravisher could have been saved from a father 's arm ? But now , Heaven has been more kind . In this hour let me imitate its mercy ; "
446351	446406	446603	446603	Harley	503	" Back , pedant ; back ; you have not triumphed yet . And you , prating German , tell your tales to our emperor . I shall be by his throne to answer , - if , indeed , you escape from the meeting to which I will force you by the way . "
446611	446695	446730	446730	L'Estrange	503	" Adieu , Monsieur le Comte , adieu ! The vessel which you have honoured me by entering is bound to Norway . The Italians who accompany you were sent by yourself into exile , and , in return , they now kindly promise to enliven you with their society , whenever you feel somewhat tired of your own . Conduct the count to his cabin . Gently there , gently . Adieu , Monsieur le Comte , adieu ! et bon voyage . "
446721	446728	446730	446730	L'Estrange	503	" A trick for the trickster , "
446736	446749	446730	446730	L'Estrange	503	" The revenge of a farce on the would - be tragedian . "
446750	446757	446730	446730	L'Estrange	503	" More than that,-he is ruined . "
446758	446762	446730	446730	L'Estrange	503	" And ridiculous , "
446766	446781	446881	446883	her young lover	10829	" I should like to see his look when they land him in Norway . "
446896	446939	446947	446947	Beatrice	1130	" No , no , do not think for a moment that we suspect you , Beatrice . I will answer for your honour with my life . Oh , why will you turn from me ; why will you not speak ? "
446940	446945	446959	446959	She	1130	" A moment later , "
446951	446958	447121	447121	she	1130	" Give me one moment yet . "
447116	447120	447121	447121	she	1130	" My Lord , "
447127	447256	447102	447103	Lord L'Estrange	502	" I can not accuse you of harshness to my sinful and unhappy brother . His offence might perhaps deserve a heavier punishment than that which you inflict with such playful scorn . But whatever his penance , contempt now or poverty later , I feel that his sister should be by his side to share it . I am not innocent if he be guilty ; and , wreck though he be , nothing else on this dark sea of life is now left to me to cling to . Hush , my Lord ! I shall not leave this vessel . All that I entreat of you is , to order your men to respect my brother , since a woman will be by his side . "
447257	447269	447289	447289	Frank	449	" But , Marchesa , this can not be ; and - "
447270	447287	447102	447103	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Beatrice , Beatrice - and me ! - our betrothal ? Do you forget me ? "
447295	447394	447412	447412	Frank	449	" No , young and too noble lover ; I shall remember you ever in my prayers . But listen . I have been deceived , hurried on , I might say , by others , but also , and far more , by my own mad and blinded heart , - deceived , hurried on , to wrong you and to belie myself . My shame burns into me when I think that I could have inflicted on you the just anger of your family , linked you to my own ruined fortunes , - my own - "
447395	447410	447102	447103	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Your own generous , loving heart ! - that is all I asked ! "
447414	447425	447102	447103	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Cease , cease ! that heart is mine still ! "
447434	447517	447528	447528	Frank	449	" Englishman , I never loved you ; this heart was dead to you , and it will be dead to all else forever . Farewell . You will forget me sooner than you think for , - sooner than I shall forget you , as a friend , as a brother - if brothers had natures as tender and as kind as yours ! Now , my Lord , will you give me your arm ? I would join the count . "
447518	447526	447547	447547	his	449	" Stay ; one word , Madame , "
447560	447643	447675	447675	she	1130	" one word . I may not be worthy of you in anything else , but an honest love , that never doubted , never suspected , that would have clung to you though all the world were against , - such a love makes the meanest man of worth . One word , frank and open . By all that you hold most sacred in your creed , did you speak the truth when you said that you never loved me ? "
447669	447674	447772	447772	She	1130	" Pardon , pardon , "
447735	447771	447772	447772	She	1130	" Yes , pardon ; for I spoke the truth , and I had no heart to give . It might have been as wax to another , - it was of granite to you . "
447779	447786	447889	447889	she	1130	" Granite , and - broken ! "
447875	447887	447922	447922	she	1130	" It is your arm that trembles now , Lord L'Estrange , "
447914	447921	447922	447922	she	1130	" You have pardoned me already , "
447936	447990	448110	448110	Harley	503	" and my last words shall not be of the past . I see your future spread bright before me under those steadfast stars . Love still ; hope and trust . These are the last words of her who will soon die to the world . Fair maid , they are prophetic ! "
448101	448108	448110	448110	Harley	503	" Courage , Leonard , courage ! "
448112	448196	448286	448287	the sage	3893	" You grieve , and nobly . But you have shunned the worst and most vulgar deceit in civilized life ; you have not simulated love . Better that yon poor lady should be , awhile , the sufferer from a harsh truth , than the eternal martyr of a flattering lie ! Alas , my Leonard ! with the love of the poet 's dream are linked only the Graces ; with the love of the human heart come the awful Fates ! "
448197	448242	448276	448276	Harley	503	" My Lord , poets do not dream when they love . You will learn how the feelings are deep in proportion as the fancies are vivid , when you read that confession of genius and woe which I have left in your hands . "
448267	448274	448330	448330	Harley	503	" The Fates , the Fates ! "
448321	448328	448286	448287	the sage	3893	" Indeed , my dear Duke , "
448331	448356	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Hush , hush ! Diavolo , do n't call me Duke yet ; I am at home here once more as Dr. Riccabocca . "
448357	448403	448286	448287	the sage	3893	" My dear doctor , then , allow me to assure you that you overrate my claim to your thanks . Your old friends , Leonard and Frank Hazeldean , must come in for their share . Nor is the faithful Giacomo to be forgotten . "
448404	448409	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Continue your explanation . "
448410	449216	449222	449222	Riccabocca	463	" In the first place , I learned , through Frank , that one Baron Levy , a certain fashionable money - lender , and general ministrant to the affairs of fine gentlemen , was just about to purchase a yacht from Lord Spendquick on behalf of the count . A short interview with Spendquick enabled me to outbid the usurer , and conclude a bargain by which the yacht became mine , - a promise to assist Spendquick in extricating himself from the claws of the money - lender which I trust to do by reconciling him with his father , who is a man of liberality and sense made Spendquick readily connive at my scheme for outwitting the enemy . He allowed Levy to suppose that the count might take possession of the vessel ; but affecting an engagement , and standing out for terms , postponed the final settlement of the purchase - money till the next day . I was thus master of the vessel , which I felt sure was destined to serve Peschiera 's infamous design . But it was my business not to alarm the count 's suspicions ; I therefore permitted the pirate crew he had got together to come on board . I knew I could get rid of them when necessary . Meanwhile , Frank undertook to keep close to the count until he could see and cage within his lodgings the servant whom Peschiera had commissioned to attend his sister . If I could but apprehend this servant , I had a sanguine hope that I could discover and free your daughter before Peschiera could even profane her with his presence . But Frank , alas ! was no pupil of Machiavelli . Perhaps the count detected his secret thoughts under his open countenance , perhaps merely wished to get rid of a companion very much in his way ; but , at all events , he contrived to elude our young friend as cleverly as you or I could have done , - told him that Beatrice herself was at Roehampton , had borrowed the count 's carriage to go there , volunteered to take Frank to the house , took him . Frank found himself in a drawing - room ; and after waiting a few minutes , while the count went out on pretence of seeing his sister , in pirouetted a certain distinguished opera - dancer ! Meanwhile the count was fast back on the road to London , and Frank had to return as he could . He then hunted for the count everywhere , and saw him no more . It was late in the day when Frank found me out with this news . I became seriously alarmed . Peschiera might perhaps learn my counter - scheme with the yacht , or he might postpone sailing until he had terrified or entangled Violante into some - In short , everything was to be dreaded from a man of the count 's temper . I had no clew to the place to which your daughter was taken , no excuse to arrest Peschiera , no means even of learning where he was . He had not returned to Mivart 's . The Police was at fault , and useless , except in one valuable piece of information . They told me where some of your countrymen , whom Peschiera 's perfidy had sent into exile , were to be found . I commissioned Giacomo to seek these men out , and induce them to man the vessel . It might be necessary , should Peschiera or his confidential servants come aboard , after we had expelled or drawn off the pirate crew , that they should find Italians whom they might well mistake for their own hirelings . To these foreigners I added some English sailors who had before served in the same vessel , and on whom Spendquick assured me I could rely . Still these precautions only availed in case Peschiera should resolve to sail , and defer till then all machinations against his captives . While , amidst my fears and uncertainties , I was struggling still to preserve presence of mind , and rapidly discussing with the Austrian prince if any other steps could be taken , or if our sole resource was to repair to the vessel and take the chance of what might ensue , Leonard suddenly and quietly entered my room . You know his countenance , in which joy or sadness is not betrayed so much by the evidence of the passions as by variations in the intellectual expression . It was but by the clearer brow and the steadier eye that I saw he had good tidings to impart . "
449217	449220	449222	449222	Riccabocca	463	" Ah , "
449241	449286	448330	448330	Harley	503	" ah , I early taught that young man the great lesson inculcated by Helvetius . ' All our errors arise from our ignorance or our passions . ' Without ignorance and without passions , we should be serene , all - penetrating intelligences . "
449287	449290	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Mopsticks , "
449294	449307	449313	449313	Riccabocca	463	" have neither ignorance nor passions ; but as for their intelligence - "
449308	449311	449313	449313	Riccabocca	463	" Pshaw ! "
449316	449319	448330	448330	Harley	503	" proceed . "
449320	449547	449555	449555	Riccabocca	463	" Leonard had parted from us some hours before . I had commissioned him to call at Madame di Negra 's , and , as he was familiarly known to her servants , seek to obtain quietly all the information he could collect , and , at all events , procure what in my haste I had failed to do the name and description of the man who had driven her out in the morning , and make what use he judged best of every hint he could gather or glean that might aid our researches . Leonard only succeeded in learning the name and description of the coachman , whom he recognized as one Beppo , to whom she had often given orders in his presence . None could say where he then could be found , if not at the count 's hotel . Leonard went next to that hotel . The man had not been there all the day . While revolving what next he should do , his eye caught sight of your intended son - in - law , gliding across the opposite side of the street . One of those luminous , inspiring conjectures , which never occur to you philosophers , had from the first guided Leonard to believe that Randal Leslie was mixed up in this villanous affair . "
449548	449553	449555	449555	Riccabocca	463	" Ha ! He ? "
449557	449567	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Impossible ! For what interest , what object ? "
449568	449652	449660	449660	Riccabocca	463	" I can not tell , neither could Leonard ; but we had both formed the same conjecture . Brief : Leonard resolved to follow Randal Leslie , and track all his movements . He did then follow him , unobserved , - and at a distance , first to Audley Egerton 's house , then to Eaton Square , thence to a house in Bruton Street , which Leonard ascertained to be Baron Levy 's . Suspicious that , my clear sage ? "
449653	449658	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Diavolo , yes ! "
449664	449740	449750	449750	Riccabocca	463	" At Levy 's , Randal stayed till dusk . He then came out , with his cat - like , stealthy step , and walked quickly into the neighbourhood of Leicester Square . Leonard saw him enter one of those small hotels which are appropriated to foreigners . Wild , outlandish fellows were loitering about the door and in the street . Leonard divined that the count or the count 's confidants were there . "
449741	449748	449750	449750	Riccabocca	463	" If that can be proved , "
449752	449784	448330	448330	Harley	503	" if Randal could have been thus in communication with Peschiera , could have connived at such perfidy , I am released from my promise . Oh , to prove it ! "
449785	449999	450006	450008	the innocent sage	12698	" Proof will come later , if we are on the right track . Let me go on . While waiting near the door of this hotel , Beppo himself , the very man Leonard was in search of , came forth , and , after speaking a few words to some of the loitering foreigners , walked briskly towards Piccadilly . Leonard here resigned all further heed of Leslie , and gave chase to Beppo , whom he recognized at a glance . Coming up to him , he said quietly , ' I have a letter for the Marchesa di Negra . She told me I was to send it to her by you . I have been searching for you the whole day . ' The man fell into the trap , and the more easily , because - as he since owned in excuse for a simplicity which , I dare say , weighed on his conscience more than any of the thousand - and - one crimes he may have committed in the course of his illustrious life - he had been employed by the marchesa as a spy upon Leonard , and , with an Italian 's acumen in affairs of the heart , detected her secret . "
450000	450004	448330	448330	Harley	503	" What secret ? "
450010	450087	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Her love for the handsome young poet . I betray that secret , in order to give her some slight excuse for becoming Peschiera 's tool . She believed Leonard to be in love with your daughter , and jealousy urged her to treason . Violante , no doubt , will explain this to you . Well , the man fell into the trap . ' Give me the letter , Signor , and quick . '
450088	450111	448330	448330	Harley	503	" ' It is at a hotel close by ; come there , and you will have a guinea for your trouble . '
450112	450893	448330	448330	Harley	503	" So Leonard walked our gentleman into my hotel ; and having taken him into my dressing - room , turned the key and there left him . On learning this capture , the prince and myself hastened to see our prisoner . He was at first sullen and silent ; but when the prince disclosed his rank and name you know the mysterious terror the meaner Italians feel for an Austrian magnate , his countenance changed , and his courage fell . What with threats and what with promises , we soon obtained all that we sought to know ; and an offered bribe , which I calculated at ten times the amount the rogue could ever expect to receive from his spendthrift master , finally bound him cheerfully to our service , soul and body . Thus we learned the dismal place to which your noble daughter had been so perfidiously ensnared . We learned also that the count had not yet visited her , hoping much from the effect that prolonged incarceration might have in weakening her spirit and inducing her submission . Peschiera was to go to the house at midnight , thence to transport her to the vessel . Beppo had received orders to bring the carriage to Leicester Square , where Peschiera would join him . The count as Leonard surmised had taken skulking refuge at the hotel in which Randal Leslie had disappeared . The prince , Leonard , Frank who was then in the hotel , and myself held a short council . Should we go at once to the house , and , by the help of the police , force an entrance , and rescue your daughter ? This was a very hazardous resource . The abode , which , at various times , had served for the hiding - place of men haunted by the law , abounded , according to our informant , in subterranean vaults and secret passages , and had more than one outlet on the river . At our first summons at the door , therefore , the ruffians within might not only escape themselves , but carry off their prisoner . The door was strong , and before our entrance could be forced , all trace of her we sought might be lost . Again , too , the prince was desirous of bringing Peschiera 's guilty design home to him , - anxious to be able to state to the emperor , and to the great minister his kinsman , that he himself had witnessed the count 's vile abuse of the emperor 's permission to we d your daughter . In short , while I only thought of Violante , the prince thought also of her father 's recall to his dukedom . Yet , still to leave Violante in that terrible house , even for an hour , a few minutes , subjected to the actual presence of Peschiera , unguarded save by the feeble and false woman who had betrayed and might still desert her - how contemplate that fearful risk ? What might not happen in the interval between Peschiera 's visit to the house and his appearance with his victim on the vessel ? An idea flashed on me : Beppo was to conduct the count to the house ; if I could accompany Beppo in disguise , enter the house , myself be present ? - I rushed back to our informant , now become our agent ; I found the plan still more feasible than I had at first supposed . Beppo had asked the count 's permission to bring with him a brother accustomed to the sea , and who wished to quit England . I might personate that brother . You know that the Italian language , in most of its dialects and varieties of patois - Genoese , Piedmontese , Venetian - is as familiar tome as Addison 's English ! Alas ! rather more so . Presto ! the thing was settled . I felt my heart , from that moment , as light as a feather , and my sense as keen as the dart which a feather wings . My plans now were formed in a breath , and explained in a sentence . It was right that you should be present on board the vessel , not only to witness your foe 's downfall , but to receive your child in a father 's arms . Leonard set out to Norwood for you , cautioned not to define too precisely for what object you were wanted , till on board .
450894	451059	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Frank , accompanied by Beppo for there was yet time for these preparations before midnight , repaired to the yacht , taking Giacomo by the way . There our new ally , familiar to most of that piratical crew , and sanctioned by the presence of Frank , as the count 's friend and prospective brother - in - law , told Peschiera 's hirelings that they were to quit the vessel , and wait on shore under Giacomo 's auspices till further orders ; and as soon as the decks were cleared of these ruffians save a few left to avoid suspicion , and who were afterwards safely stowed down in the hold , and as soon as Giacomo had lodged his convoy in a public house , where he quitted them drinking his health over unlimited rations of grog , your inestimable servant quietly shipped on board the Italians pressed into the service , and Frank took charge of the English sailors .
451060	451136	451162	451164	the prudent philosopher	12699	" The prince , promising to be on board in due time , then left me to make arrangements for his journey to Vienna by the dawn . I hastened to a masquerade warehouse , where , with the help of an ingenious stagewright artificer , I disguised myself into a most thorough - paced - looking cut - throat , and then waited the return of my friend Beppo with the most perfect confidence . "
451137	451160	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Yet , if that rascal had played false , all these precautions were lost . Cospetto ! you were not wise , "
451166	451192	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Very likely not . You would have been so wise , that by this time your daughter would have been lost to you forever . "
451193	451201	448330	448330	Harley	503	" But why not employ the police ? "
451202	451410	448330	448330	Harley	503	" First , Because I had already employed them to little purpose ; secondly , Because I no longer wanted them ; thirdly , Because to use them for my final catastrophe would be to drag your name , and your daughter 's perhaps , before a police court , - at all events , before the tribunal of public gossip ; and lastly , Because , having decided upon the proper punishment , it had too much of equity to be quite consistent with law ; and in forcibly seizing a man 's person , and shipping him off to Norway , my police would have been sadly in the way . Certainly my plan rather savours of Lope de Vega than of Blackstone . However , you see success atones for all irregularities . I resume : Beppo came back in time to narrate all the arrangements that had been made , and to inform me that a servant from the count had come on board just as our new crew were assembled there , to order the boat to be at the place where we found it . The servant it was deemed prudent to detain and secure . Giacomo undertook to manage the boat .
451411	451488	448330	448330	Harley	503	" I am nearly at the close of my story . Sure of my disguise , I got on the coach - box with Beppo . The count arrived at the spot appointed , and did not even honour myself with a question or glance . ' Your brother ? ' he said to Beppo ; ' one might guess that ; he has the family likeness . Not a handsome race yours ! Drive on . '
451489	451521	448330	448330	Harley	503	" We arrived at the house . I dismounted to open the carriage - door . The count gave me one look . ' Beppo says you have known the sea . '
451522	451533	448330	448330	Harley	503	" ' Excellency , yes . I am a Genoese . '
451534	451558	448330	448330	Harley	503	" ' Ha ! how is that ? Beppo is a Lombard . ' - Admire the readiness with which I redeemed my blunder .
451559	451624	448330	448330	Harley	503	" ' Excellency , it pleased Heaven that Beppo should be born in Lombardy , and then to remove my respected parents to Genoa , at which city they were so kindly treated that my mother , in common gratitude , was bound to increase its population . It was all she could do , poor woman . You see she did her best . '
451625	451651	448330	448330	Harley	503	" The count smiled , and said no more . The door opened , I followed him ; your daughter can tell you the rest . "
451652	451667	448330	448330	Harley	503	" And you risked your life in that den of miscreants ! Noble friend ! "
451668	451807	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Risked my life , - no ; but I risked the count 's . There was one moment when my hand was on my trigger , and my soul very near the sin of justifiable homicide . But my tale is done . The count is now on the river , and will soon be on the salt seas , though not bound to Norway , as I had first intended . I could not inflict that frigid voyage on his sister . So the men have orders to cruise about for six days , keeping aloof from shore , and they will then land the count and the marchesa , by boat , on the French coast . That delay will give time for the prince to arrive at Vienna before the count could follow him . "
451808	451815	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Would he have that audacity ? "
451816	451891	448330	448330	Harley	503	" Do him more justice ! Audacity , faith ! he does not want for that . But I dreaded not his appearance at Vienna with such evidence against him . I dreaded his encountering the prince on the road , and forcing a duel , before his character was so blasted that the prince could refuse it ; and the count is a dead shot of course , - all such men are ! "
451892	451900	448330	448330	Harley	503	" He will return , and you - "
451901	452103	452131	452131	Riccabocca	463	" I ! Oh , never fear ; he has had enough of me . And now , my dear friend , - now that Violante is safe once more under your own roof ; now that my honoured mother must long ere this have been satisfied by Leonard , who left us to go to her , that our success has been achieved without danger , and , what she will value almost as much , without scandal ; now that your foe is powerless as a reed floating on the water towards its own rot , and the Prince Von - - - -is perhaps about to enter his carriage on the road to Dover , charged with the mission of restoring to Italy her worthiest son , - let me dismiss you to your own happy slumbers , and allow me to wrap myself in my cloak , and snatch a short sleep on the sofa , till yonder gray dawn has mellowed into riper day . My eyes are heavy , and if you stay here three minutes longer , I shall be out of reach of hearing , in the land of dreams . Buona notte ! "
452104	452114	452197	452198	the sage	3893	" But there is a bed prepared for you . "
452190	452195	452197	452198	the sage	3893	" Not in bed ! "
452204	452236	452337	452337	he	2823	" Have you no feelings of compassion for my son that is to be ? Just , too , when there is a reasonable probability that we can afford a son ? "
452329	452336	452337	452337	he	2823	" These arms have clasped her , "
452340	452418	452468	452469	the servant	3272	" these lips have inhaled her breath ! I am under the same roof , and she is saved , - saved evermore from danger and from penury , and forever divided from me . Courage , courage ! Oh , honour , duty ; and thou , dark memory of the past , - thou that didst pledge love at least to a grave , - support , defend me ! Can I be so weak ! "
452461	452466	452468	452469	the servant	3272	" Good - day , "
452473	452522	452528	452528	Harley	503	" The dog has not been of much use , but I do n't think the padrone will henceforth grudge him a breakfast . I shall take him to Italy , and marry him there , in the hope of improving the breed of our native Lombard dogs . "
452523	452526	452528	452528	Harley	503	" Ah , "
452530	452546	452567	452567	Giacomo	487	" you will soon leave our cold shores . May sunshine settle on you all ! "
452559	452565	452567	452567	Giacomo	487	" The signorina sleeps there , "
452574	452584	452592	452592	Harley	503	" just over the room in which you slept . "
452585	452590	452592	452592	Harley	503	" I knew it , "
452594	452621	452832	452832	He	570	" An instinct told me of it . Open the gate ; I must go home . My excuses to your lord , and to all . "
452848	452862	452947	452948	a somnambulist	12718	" Have you discovered no trace , my Lord ? Speak , speak ! "
452863	452889	452897	452897	Randal	570	" Speak ! certainly . I am too happy to relieve your mind , Mr. Leslie . What fools we were ! Ha , ha ! "
452890	452895	452947	452948	a somnambulist	12718	" Fools - how ? "
452899	452916	452947	452948	a somnambulist	12718	" Of course ; the young lady was at her father 's house all the time . "
452917	452922	452947	452948	a somnambulist	12718	" Eh ? what ? "
452923	452929	452938	452938	Randal	570	" And is there now . "
452930	452936	452938	452938	Randal	570	" It is not possible ! "
452950	452964	452947	452948	a somnambulist	12718	" At her father 's house , at Norwood ! Are you sure ? "
452965	452968	452987	452987	he	570	" Sure . "
452981	452986	452987	452987	he	570	" Heaven be praised ! "
452990	453049	453138	453138	Harley	503	" And just as I had begun to suspect the count , the marchesa ; for I find that neither of them slept at home last night ; and Levy told me that the count had written to him , requesting the baron to discharge his bills , as he should be for some time absent from England . "
453050	453086	452987	452987	he	570	" Indeed ! Well , that is nothing to us , - very much to Baron Levy , if he executes his commission , and discharges the bills . What ! are you going already ? "
453087	453123	453138	453138	Harley	503	" Do you ask such a question ? How can I stay ? I must go to Norwood , - must see Violante with my own eyes ! Forgive my emotion - I - I - "
453145	453269	453277	453278	the waiter	6629	" I have no more doubt of his guilt than Leonard has . Violante at least shall not be the prize of that thin - lipped knave . What strange fascination can he possess , that he should thus bind to him the two men I value most , - Audley Egerton and Alphonso di Serrano ? Both so wise too ! - one in books , one in action . And both suspicious men ! While I , so imprudently trustful and frank - Ah , that is the reason ; our natures are antipathetic ; cunning , simulation , falsehood , I have no mercy , no pardon for these . Woe to all hypocrites if I were a grand Inquisitor ! "
453270	453275	453333	453333	he	503	" Mr. Richard Avenel , "
453328	453332	453333	453333	he	503	" Mr. Avenel ! "
453337	453347	453361	453361	Dick	643	" Did I hear your name aright ? Avenel ! "
453348	453359	453411	453411	Dick	643	" Richard Avenel , at your service , my Lord , "
453363	453409	453452	453452	he	502	" My family is not unknown to you ; and I am not ashamed of my family , though my parents were small Lansmere tradesfolks , and I am - ahem ! - a citizen of the world , and well - to - do ! "
453461	453483	453493	453493	Dick	643	" You are most welcome , sir ; and if there be anything I can do for one of your name - "
453484	453491	453493	453493	Dick	643	" Thank you , my Lord , "
453495	453577	453650	453650	he	503	" I want nothing of any man . A bold word to say ; but I say it . Nevertheless , I should not have presumed to call on your Lordship , unless , indeed , you had done me the honour to call first at my house , Eaton Square , No . - - I should not have presumed to call if it had not been on business , - public business , I may say - NATIONAL business ! "
453667	453707	453807	453807	his	503	" Business or not business , let us speak to each other as friends , - for the sake of a name that takes me back to Lansmere , to my youth . I listen to you with interest . "
453783	453805	453807	453807	his	503	" You are very good , Lord L'Estrange ; nothing can be handsomer . I feel it here , my Lord , "
453812	454051	454058	454058	Harley	503	" I do , ' pon my honour . But not to waste your time time 's money , I come to the point . It is about the borough of Lansmere . Your family interest is very strong in that borough ; but excuse me if I say that I do n't think you are aware that I too have cooked up a pretty considerable interest on the other side . No offence , - opinions are free . And the popular tide runs strong with us - I mean with me - at the impending crisis , - that is , at the next election . Now , I have a great respect for the earl your father , and so have those who brought me into the world - my father , John , was always a regular good Blue , - and my respect for yourself since I came into this room has gone up in the market a very great rise indeed , - considerable . So I should just like to see if we could set our heads together , and settle the borough between us two , in a snug private way , as public men ought to do when they get together , nobody else by , and no necessity for that sort of humbug , which is so common in this rotten old country . Eh , my Lord ? "
454052	454056	454063	454063	himself	503	" Mr. Avenel , "
454078	454121	454195	454195	he	643	" I fear I do not quite understand you ; but I have no other interest in the next election for the borough of Lansmere than as may serve one whom , whatever be your politics , you must acknowledge to be - "
454122	454126	454063	454063	himself	503	" A humbug ! "
454127	454160	454195	454195	he	643	" Mr. Avenel , you can not mean the person I mean . I speak of one of the first statesmen of our time , - of Mr. Audley Egerton , of - "
454161	454169	454063	454063	himself	503	" A stiff - necked , pompous - "
454170	454177	454195	454195	he	643	" My earliest and dearest friend . "
454206	454263	454274	454274	Dick	643	" I beg your pardon , my Lord , I am sure . Of course , I can say nothing disrespectful of your friend , - very sorry that he is your friend . In that case , I am almost afraid that nothing is to be done . But Mr. Audley Egerton has not a chance .
454264	454272	454195	454195	he	643	" Let me convince you of this . "
454286	454338	454429	454429	his	503	" Canvass book , my Lord . I am no aristocrat . I do n't pretend to carry a free and independent constituency in my breeches ' pocket . Heaven forbid ! But as a practical man of business , what I do is done properly . Just look at this book .
454339	454401	454413	454413	Harley	503	" Well kept , eh ? Names , promises , inclinations , public opinions , and private interests of every individual Lansmere elector ! Now , as one man of honour to another , I show you this book , and I think you will see that we have a clear majority of at least eighty votes as against Mr. Egerton . "
454402	454411	454429	454429	his	503	" That is your view of the question , "
454462	454488	454523	454523	Dick	643	" But surely there are persons here in whom you deceive yourself , - old friends of my family , stanch supporters of our party . "
454489	454521	454429	454429	his	503	" Exactly so . But this new question has turned all old things topsy - turvy . No relying on any friend of yours . No reliance except in this book ! "
454535	454572	454429	454429	his	503	" Now , what I want to propose is this : Do n't let the Lansmere interest be beaten ; it would vex the old earl , - go to his heart , I am sure . "
454576	454700	454741	454741	I	0	" And the Lansmere interest need not be beaten , if you 'll put up another man instead of this red - tapist . Beg pardon . You see I only want to get in one man , you want to get in another . Why not ? Now , there 's a smart youth , - connection of Mr. Egerton 's , - Randal Leslie . I have no objection to him , though he is of your colours . Withdraw Mr. Egerton , and I 'll withdraw my second man before it comes to the poll ; and so we shall halve the borough slick between us . That 's the way to do business , - eh , my Lord ? "
454701	454725	454731	454731	Dick	643	" Randal Leslie ! Oh , you wish to bring in Mr. Leslie ? But he stands with Egerton , not against him . "
454726	454729	454780	454781	the earl	2072	" Ah , "
454791	454791	454764	454764	yours	12729	"
454792	454800	454780	454781	the earl	2072	" Young Leslie has spoken to you ? "
454801	455205	454764	454764	yours	12729	" Not as to my coming here . Oh , no , that 's a secret , - private and confidential , my Lord . And now , to make matters still more smooth , I propose that my man shall be one to your Lordship 's own heart . I find you have been very kind to my nephew ; does you credit , my Lord , - a wonderful young man , though I say it . I never guessed there was so much in him . Yet all the time he was in my house , he had in his desk the very sketch of an invention that is now saving me from ruin , - from positive ruin , - Baron Levy , the King 's Bench , and almighty smash ! Now , such a young man ought to be in parliament . I like to bring forward a relation , - that is , when he does one credit ; ' t is human nature and sacred ties - one 's own flesh and blood ; and besides , one hand rubs the other , and one leg helps on the other , and relations get on best in the world when they pull together ; that is , supposing that they are the proper sort of relations , and pull one on , not down . I had once thought of standing for Lansmere myself , - thought of it very lately . The country wants men like me , I know that ; but I have an idea that I had better see to my own business . The country may , or may not , do without me , stupid old thing that she is ! But my mill and my new engines - there is no doubt that they can not do without me . In short , as we are quite alone , and , as I said before , there 's no kind of necessity for that sort of humbug which exists when other people are present , provide elsewhere for Mr. Egerton , whom I hate like poison , - I have a right to do that , I suppose , without offence to your Lordship , - and the two younkers , Leonard Fairfield and Randal Leslie , shall be members for the free and independent borough of Lansmere ! "
455206	455216	454780	454781	the earl	2072	" But does Leonard wish to come into parliament ? "
455217	455405	455411	455411	Harley	503	" No , he says not ; but that 's nonsense . If your Lordship will just signify your wish that he should not lose this noble opportunity to raise himself in life , and get something handsome out of the nation , I 'm sure he owes you too much to hesitate , - ' specially when ' t is to his own advantage . And besides , one of us Avenels ought to be in parliament ; and if I have not the time and learning , and so forth , and he has , why , it stands to reason that he should be the man . And if he can do something for me one day - not that I want anything - but still a baronetcy or so would be a compliment to British Industry , and be appreciated as such by myself and the public at large , - I say , if he could do something of that sort , it would keep up the whole family ; and if he ca n't , why , I 'll forgive him . "
455406	455409	455411	455411	Harley	503	" Avenel , "
455427	455521	455692	455692	Dick	643	" Avenel , if as a great personal favour to myself - to me your fellow - townsman I was born at Lansmere - if I asked you to forego your grudge against Audley Egerton , whatever that grudge be , and not oppose his election , while our party would not oppose your nephew 's , could you not oblige me ? Come , for the sake of dear Lansmere , and all the old kindly feelings between your family and mine , say ' yes , so shall it be . ' "
455594	455690	455692	455692	Dick	643	" No ; I swore that Audley Egerton should smart for his insolence to me , as sure as my name be Richard Avenel ; and all the soft soap in the world will not wash out that oath . So there is nothing for it but for you to withdraw that man , or for me to defeat him . And I would do so , ay , - and in the way that could most gall him , - if it cost me half my fortune . But it will not cost that , "
455696	455748	455907	455907	Dick	643	" nor anything like it ; for when the popular tide runs in one 's favour , ' t is astonishing how cheap an election may be . It will cost him enough though , and all for nothing , - worse than nothing . Think of it , my Lord . "
455749	455812	455826	455826	Dick	643	" I will , Mr. Avenel . And I say , in my turn , that my friendship is as strong as your hate ; and that if it costs me , not half , but my whole fortune , Audley Egerton shall come in without a shilling of expense to himself , should we once decide that he stand the contest . "
455813	455824	455826	455826	Dick	643	" Very well , my Lord , - very well , "
455837	455885	455907	455907	Dick	643	" we 'll see if the aristocracy is always to ride over the free choice of the people in this way . But the people are roused , my Lord . The March of Enlightenment is commenced , the Schoolmaster is abroad , and the British Lion - "
455886	455906	455907	455907	Dick	643	" Nobody here but ourselves , my dear Avenel . Is not this rather what you call - humbug ? "
455920	455945	455907	455907	Dick	643	" Give us your hand again , my Lord . You are a good fellow , that you are . And for your sake - "
455946	455953	455965	455965	Dick	643	" You 'll not oppose Egerton ? "
455954	455963	456116	456117	Audley Egerton	500	" Tooth and nail , tooth and nail ! "
456131	456154	456354	456354	Harley	503	" Thank Heaven ! I have not to present to the world that terrible man as my brother - in - law . "
456346	456352	456357	456357	himself	503	" I must not think , "
456362	456421	456821	456821	Randal	570	" either of past or present . Let me hurry on to some fancied future . ' Happiest are the marriages , ' said the French philosopher , and still says many a sage , ' in which man asks only the mild companion , and woman but the calm protector . ' I will go to Helen . "
456811	456819	456821	456821	Randal	570	" I , then , much alarmed , "
456823	456980	457282	457282	he	570	" hastened to Baron Levy , who informed me that the count had written him word that he should be for some time absent from England . Rushing thence , in despair , to your friend Lord L'Estrange , I heard that your daughter was safe with you . And though , as I have just proved , I would have risked my life against so notorious a duellist as the count , on the mere chance of preserving Violante from his supposed designs , I am rejoiced to think that she had no need of my unskilful arm . But how and why can the count have left England after accepting a challenge ? A man so sure of his weapon , too , - reputed to be as fearless of danger as he is blunt in conscience . Explain , - you who know mankind so well , - explain . I can not . "
457297	457300	457304	457310	the provident and far - calculating Randal	12782	" But , "
457312	457372	457380	457380	Riccabocca	463	" but your only child , your sole heiress ! Oh , might not your consent to such a marriage if known before your recall jeopardize your cause ? Your lands , your principalities , to devolve on the child of an humble Englishman ! I dare not believe it . Ah , would Violante were not your heiress ! "
457373	457378	457380	457380	Riccabocca	463	" A noble wish , "
457385	457404	457410	457410	Randal	570	" and one that the Fates will realize . Cheer up ; Violante will not be my heiress . "
457405	457408	457410	457410	Randal	570	" Ah , "
457417	457425	457380	457380	Riccabocca	463	" ah , what do I hear ? "
457426	457485	457496	457496	Randal	570	" Hist ! I shall soon a second time be a father . And , to judge by the unerring researches of writers upon that most interesting of all subjects , parturitive science , I shall be the father of a son . He will , of course , succeed to the titles of Serrano . And Violante - "
457486	457494	457380	457380	Riccabocca	463	" Will have nothing , I suppose ? "
457523	457584	457590	457590	Randal	570	" Nay , her portion by our laws - to say nothing of my affection - would far exceed the ordinary dower which the daughters of London merchants bring to the sons of British peers . Whoever marries Violante , provided I regain my estates , must submit to the cares which the poets assure us ever attend on wealth . "
457585	457588	457621	457621	Randal	570	" Oh ! "
457606	457618	457628	457628	Schiller	1072	" And now , let me present you to your betrothed . "
457631	457636	457879	457897	The philosopher , who was disposed to believe one kind of courtship to be much the same as another	12795	" gamut of feeling , "
457922	457929	457946	457946	Randal	570	" Pooh , pooh , pazzie ! "
457938	457944	457946	457946	Randal	570	" If knowledge be power , "
457948	458123	458133	458133	Pluto	1236	" ability is certainly good luck , as Miss Edgeworth shows in that story of Murad the Unlucky , which I read at Eton ; very clever story it is , too . So nothing comes amiss to me . Violante 's escape , which has cost me the count 's L10,000 , proves to be worth to me , I dare say , ten times as much . No doubt she 'll have a hundred thousand pounds at the least . And then , if her father have no other child , after all , or the child he expects die in infancy , why , once reconciled to his Government and restored to his estates , the law must take its usual course , and Violante will be the greatest heiress in Europe . As to the young lady herself , I confess she rather awes me ; I know I shall be henpecked . Well , all respectable husbands are . There is something scampish and ruffianly in not being henpecked . "
458135	458139	458165	458165	he	12797	" iron tears ; "
458157	458163	458165	458165	he	12797	" What am I about , "
458170	458229	458259	458259	Riccabocca	463	" chuckling to myself and wasting time , when I ought to be thinking gravely how to explain away my former cavalier courtship ? Such a masterpiece as I thought it then ! But who could foresee the turn things would take ? Let me think ; let me think . Plague on it , here she comes . "
458264	458296	458311	458311	he	570	" My dear Leslie , you must excuse my daughter to - day ; she is still suffering from the agitation she has gone through , and can not see you . "
458306	458309	458311	458311	he	570	" Cruel ! "
458313	458358	458259	458259	Riccabocca	463	" yet I would not for worlds force myself on her presence . I hope , Duke , that she will not find it too difficult to obey the commands which dispose of her hand , and intrust her happiness to my grateful charge . "
458359	458387	458311	458311	he	570	" To be plain with you , Randal , she does at present seem to find it more difficult than I foresaw . She even talks of - "
458388	458396	458259	458259	Riccabocca	463	" Another attachment - Oh , heavens ! "
458397	458484	458527	458527	Randal	570	" Attachment , pazzie ! Whom has she seen ? No , a convent ! But leave it to me . In a calmer hour she will comprehend that a child must know no lot more enviable and holy than that of redeeming a father 's honour . And now , if you are returning to London , may I ask you to convey to young Mr. Hazeldean my assurances of undying gratitude for his share in my daughter 's delivery from that poor baffled swindler . "
458522	458525	458527	458527	Randal	570	" True , "
458529	458605	458259	458259	Riccabocca	463	" you told me Frank had a share in Lord L'Estrange 's very clever and dramatic device . My Lord must be by nature a fine actor , - comic , with a touch of melodrame ! Poor Frank ! apparently he has lost the woman he adored , - Beatrice di Negra . You say she has accompanied the count . Is the marriage that was to be between her and Frank broken off ? "
458606	458650	458527	458527	Randal	570	" I did not know such a marriage was contemplated . I understood her to be attached to another . Not that that is any reason why she would not have married Mr. Hazeldean . Express to him my congratulations on his escape . "
458651	458712	458259	458259	Riccabocca	463	" Nay , he must not know that I have inadvertently betrayed his confidence ; but you now guess , what perhaps puzzled you before , - namely , how I came to be so well acquainted with the count and his movements . I was so intimate with my relation Frank , and Frank was affianced to the marchesa . "
458713	458761	458527	458527	Randal	570	" I am glad you give me that explanation ; it suffices . After all , the marchesa is not by nature a bad woman , - that is , not worse than women generally are , so Harley says , and Violante forgives and excuses her . "
458762	458818	458852	458852	Randal	570	" Generous Violante ! But it is true . So much did the marchesa appear to me possessed of fine , though ill - regulated qualities , that I always considered her disposed to aid in frustrating her brother 's criminal designs . So I even said , if I remember right , to Violante . "
458857	458884	459194	459194	you	12822	" But you want repose . I leave you the happiest , the most grateful of men . I will give your courteous message to Frank . "
459201	459207	459286	459286	Randal	570	" Caught , by Jove ! "
459277	459284	459291	459291	he	570	" But , my dear fellow , "
459309	459394	459407	459407	he	449	" I can not believe this . ' Never loved you ' ? What was her object , then , in deceiving not only you , but myself ? I suspect her declaration was but some heroical refinement of generosity . After her brother 's dejection and probable ruin , she might feel that she was no match for you . Then , too , the squire 's displeasure ! I see it all ; just like her , - noble , unhappy woman ! "
459400	459405	459407	459407	he	449	" There are moments , "
459431	459539	459407	459407	he	449	" moments when a woman can not feign , and there are tones in the voice of a woman which men can not misinterpret . She does not love me , - she never did love me ; I can see that her heart has been elsewhere . No matter , - all is over . I do n't deny that I am suffering an intense grief ; it gnaws like a kind of sullen hunger ; and I feel so broken , too , as if I had grown old , and there was nothing left worth living for . I do n't deny all that . "
459540	459553	459407	459407	he	449	" My poor , dear friend , if you would but believe - "
459554	459622	459407	459407	he	449	" I do n't want to believe anything , except that I have been a great fool . I do n't think I can ever commit such follies again . But I 'm a man . I shall get the better of this ; I should despise myself if I could not . And now let us talk of my dear father . Has he left town ? "
459623	459653	459407	459407	he	449	" Left last night by the mail . You can write and tell him you have given up the marchesa , and all will be well again between you . "
459654	459687	459407	459407	he	449	" Give her up ! Fie , Randal ! Do you think I should tell such a lie ? She gave me up ; I can claim no merit out of that . "
459688	459743	459407	459407	he	449	" Oh , yes ! I can make the squire see all to your advantage . Oh , if it were only the marchesa ! but , alas ! that cursed postobit ! How could Levy betray you ? Never trust to usurers again ; they can not resist the temptation of a speedy profit .
459744	459772	459407	459407	he	449	" They first buy the son , and then sell him to the father . And the squire has such strange notions on matters of this kind . "
459773	459821	459983	459984	Mrs. Hazeldean	558	" He is right to have them . There , just read this letter from my mother . It came to me this morning . I could hang myself if I were a dog ; but I 'm a man , and so I must bear it . "
459975	459981	459983	459984	Mrs. Hazeldean	558	" O Frank , Frank ! "
459986	460211	460388	460388	he	9515	" were it not for this , were it only for your unfortunate attachment to the Italian lady , only for your debts , only for the errors of hasty , extravagant youth , I should be with you now , my arms round your neck , kissing you , chiding you back to your father 's heart . But - but the thought that between you and his heart has been the sordid calculation of his death , - that is a wall between us . I can not come near you . I should not like to look on your face , and think how my William 's tears fell over it , when I placed you , new born , in his arms , and bade him welcome his heir . What ! you a mere boy still , your father yet in the prime of life , and the heir can not wait till nature leaves him fatherless . Frank ; Frank this is so unlike you . Can London have ruined already a disposition so honest and affectionate ? - No ; I can not believe it . There must be some mistake . Clear it up , I implore you ; or , though as a mother I pity you , as a wife I can not forgive . "
460383	460386	460388	460388	he	9515	" Frank , "
460398	460509	460610	460610	Frank	449	" go down at once to Hazeldean ; see your mother , and explain to her how this transaction really happened . The woman you loved , and wooed as wife , in danger of an arrest , your distraction of mind , Levy 's counsels , your hope to pay off the debt , so incurred to the usurer , from the fortune you would shortly receive with the marchesa . Speak to your mother , - she is a woman ; women have a common interest in forgiving all faults that arise from the source of their power over us men , - I mean love . Go ! "
460510	460609	460748	460748	Randal	570	" No , I can not go ; you see she would not like to look on my face . And I can not repeat what you say so glibly . Besides , somehow or other , as I am so dependent upon my father , - and he has said as much , - I feel as if it would be mean in me to make any excuses . I did the thing , and must suffer for it . But I 'm a in - an - no - I ' m not a man here . "
460738	460746	460748	460748	Randal	570	" Pooh , my - dear Frank , "
460750	460770	460788	460788	Frank	449	" I have given you my advice ; you reject it . Well , what then will you do ? "
460771	460786	460788	460788	Frank	449	" I shall ask for leave of absence , and run away some where , "
460794	460854	460748	460748	Randal	570	" I ca n't face London ; I ca n't mix with others . I want to be by myself , and wrestle with all that I feel here - in my heart . Then I shall write to my mother , say the plain truth , and leave her to judge as kindly of me as she can . "
460855	460889	460788	460788	Frank	449	" You are quite right . Yes , leave town ! Why not go abroad ? You have never been abroad . New scenes will distract your mind . Run over to Paris . "
460890	460934	460748	460748	Randal	570	" Not to Paris - I do n't want gayeties ; but I did intend to go abroad somewhere , - any dull dismal hole of a place . Good - by ! Do n't think of me any more for the present . "
460935	460952	461043	461043	Frank	449	" But let me know where you go ; and meanwhile I will see the squire . "
460953	461042	461075	461075	himself	570	" Say as little of me as you can to him . I know you mean most kindly , but oh , how I wish there never had been any third person between me and my father ! There : you may well snatch away your hand . What an ungrateful wretch to you I am . I do believe I am the wickedest fellow . What ! you shake hands with me still ! My dear Randal , you have the best heart - God bless you ! "
461055	461071	461075	461075	himself	570	" They must be reconciled now , sooner or later , - squire and son , "
461083	461279	461336	461338	MR . DALE	446	" I do n't see how I can prevent that , - the marchesa being withdrawn , - unless Frank does it for me . But it is well he should be abroad , - something maybe made out of that ; meanwhile I may yet do all that I could reasonably hope to do , - even if Frank had married Beatrice , - since he was not to be disinherited . Get the squire to advance the money for the Thornhill purchase , complete the affair ; this marriage with Violante will help ; Levy must know that ; secure the borough ; - well thought of . I will go to Avenel 's . By - the - by , by - the - by , the squire might as well keep me still in the entail after Frank , supposing Frank die childless . This love affair may keep him long from marrying . His hand was very hot , - a hectic colour ; those strong - looking fellows often go off in rapid decline , especially if anything preys on their minds , - their minds are so very small .
461280	461335	461336	461338	MR . DALE	446	" Ah , the Hazeldean parson , - and with Avenel ! That young man , too , who is he ? I have seen him before some where . - My dear Mr. Dale , this is a pleasant surprise . I thought you had returned to Hazeldean with our friend the squire ? "
461341	461355	461356	461356	RANDAL	570	" The squire ! Has he left town , and without telling me ? "
461363	461404	461405	461407	MR . DALE	446	" He was anxious to get back to Mrs. Hazeldean , who was naturally very uneasy about her son and this foolish marriage ; but I am happy to tell you that that marriage is effectually and permanently broken off . "
461410	461474	461475	461475	RANDAL	570	" How , how ? My poor friend told me he had wholly failed to make any impression on Frank , - forbade me to mention the subject . I was just going to see Frank myself . I always had some influence with him . But , Mr. Leslie , explain this very sudden and happy event . The marriage broken off ! "
461478	461647	461648	461650	MR . DALE	446	" It is a long story , and I dare not tell you my humble share in it . Nay , I must keep that secret . Frank might not forgive me . Suffice it that you have my word that the fair Italian has left England , and decidedly refused Frank 's addresses . But stay , take my advice , do n't go to him ; you see it was not only the marriage that has offended the squire , but some pecuniary transactions , - an unfortunate post - obit bond on the Casino property . Frank ought to be left to his own repentant reflections . They will be most salutary ; you know his temper , - he do n't bear reproof ; and yet it is better , on the other hand , not to let him treat too lightly what has passed . Let us leave him to himself for a few days He is in an excellent frame of mind . "
461658	461697	461712	461712	Avenel	455	" You speak admirably - a post - obit ! - so often as he has heard his father 's opinion on such transactions . No , I will not see him ; I should be too angry - "
461726	461749	461750	461752	MR . DALE	446	" You should not be so long away from your rectory , Mr. Dale . What will your parish do without you ? "
461755	461816	461817	461819	MR . AVENEL	455	" The old fable of the wheel and the fly . I am afraid the wheel rolls on the same . But if I am absent from my parish , I am still in the company of one who does me honour as an old parishioner . You remember Leonard Fairfield , your antagonist in the Battle of the Stocks ? "
461822	461834	461959	461959	Avenel	838	" My nephew , I am proud to say , sir . "
461861	461958	461983	461983	Randal	570	" You should be friends , you two youngsters . Who knows but you may run together in the same harness ? Ah , that reminds me , Leslie , I have a word or two to say to you . Your servant , Mr. Dale . Shall be happy to present you to Mrs. Avenel . My card , - Eaton Square , Number - . You will call on me to - morrow , Leonard . And mind , I shall be very angry if you persist in your refusal . Such an opening ! "
461973	461981	461959	461959	Avenel	838	" Any fresh hints as to Lansmere ? "
461985	462028	462034	462034	Randal	570	" Yes ; I have now decided on the plan of contest . You must fight two and two , - you and Egerton against me and if I can get him to stand , as I hope my nephew , Leonard . "
462029	462032	462034	462034	Randal	570	" What ! "
462038	462053	461959	461959	Avenel	838	" then , after all , I can hope for no support from you ? "
462054	462265	462034	462034	Randal	570	" I do n't say that ; but I have reason to think Lord L'Estrange will bestir himself actively in favour of Egerton . If so , it will be a very sharp contest ; and I must manage the whole election on our side , and unite all our shaky votes , which I can best do by standing myself in the first instance , reserving it to after consideration whether I shall throw up at the last ; for I do n't particularly want to come in , as I did a little time ago , before I had found out my nephew . Wonderful young man ! with such a head , - will do me credit in the rotten old House ; and I think I had best leave London , go to Screwstown , and look to my business . No , if Leonard stand , I roust first see to get him in ; and next , to keep Egerton out . It will probably , therefore , end in the return of one and one or either side , as we thought of before , - Leonard on our side ; and Egerton sha'n't be the man on the other . You understand ? "
462266	462358	461959	461959	Avenel	838	" I do , my dear Avenel . Of course , as I before said , I ca n't dictate to your party whom they should prefer , - Egerton or myself . And it will be obvious to the public that your party would rather defeat so eminent an adversary as Mr. Egerton than a tyro in politics like me . Of course I can not scheme for such a result ; it would be misconstrued , and damage my character . But I rely equally on your friendly promise . "
462359	462450	462465	462465	Randal	570	" Promise ! No , I do n't promise . I must first see how the cat jumps ; and I do n't know yet how our friends may like you , nor how they can be managed . All I can say is , that Audley Egerton sha'n't be M.P. for Lansmere . Meanwhile , you will take care not to commit yourself in speaking so that our party ca n't vote for you consistently ; they must count on having you - when you get into the House . "
462451	462463	462465	462465	Randal	570	" I am not a violent party - man at present , "
462469	462492	461959	461959	Avenel	838	" And if public opinion prove on your side , it is the duty of a statesman to go with the times . "
462493	462587	462465	462465	Randal	570	" Very sensibly said ; and I have a private bill or two , and some other little jobs , I want to get through the House , which we can discuss later , should it come to a frank understanding between us . We must arrange how to meet privately at Lansmere , if necessary . I 'll see to that . I shall go down this week . I think of taking a hint from the free and glorious land of America , and establishing secret caucuses . Nothing like 'em . "
462588	462591	461959	461959	Avenel	838	" Caucuses ? "
462592	462620	462465	462465	Randal	570	" Small sub - committees that spy on their men night and day , and do n't suffer them to be intimidated to vote the other way . "
462621	462647	461959	461959	Avenel	838	" You have an extraordinary head for public affairs , Avenel . You should come into parliament yourself ; your nephew is so very young . "
462648	462653	462465	462465	Randal	570	" So are you . "
462654	462666	461959	461959	Avenel	838	" Yes ; but I know the world . Does he ? "
462667	462687	462465	462465	Randal	570	" The world knows him , though not by name , and he has been the making of me . "
462688	462695	463195	463196	Mr. Dale	446	" How ? You surprise me . "
463185	463193	463195	463196	Mr. Dale	446	" I see no reason to despond , "
463198	463274	463376	463377	the parson	1499	" You fear that Miss Digby does not return your attachment ; you dwell upon her reserve , her distant , though kindly manner . Cheer up ! All young ladies are under the influence of what phrenologists call the organ of Secretiveness , when they are in the society of the object of their preference . Just as you describe Miss Digby 's manner to you , was my Carry 's manner to myself . "
463371	463374	463376	463377	the parson	1499	" Next , "
463379	463501	463510	463510	Leonard	450	" you choose to torment yourself by contrasting your own origin and fortunes with the altered circumstances of Miss Digby , - the ward of Lord L'Estrange , the guest of Lady Lansmere . You say that if Lord L'Estrange could have countenanced such a union , he would have adopted a different tone with you , - sounded your heart , encouraged your hopes , and so forth . I view things differently . I have reason to do so ; and from all you have told me of this nobleman 's interest in your fate , I venture to make you this promise , that if Miss Digby would accept your hand , Lord L'Estrange shall ratify her choice . "
463502	463508	463510	463510	Leonard	450	" My dear Mr. Dale , "
463514	463521	463629	463630	the parson	1499	" you make me that promise ? "
463522	463624	463774	463774	Leonard	450	" I do , - from what you have said , and from what I myself know of Lord L'Estrange . Go , then , at once to Knightsbridge , see Miss Digby , show her your heart , explain to her , if you will , your prospects , ask her permission to apply to Lord L'Estrange since he has constituted himself her guardian ; and if Lord L'Estrange hesitate , - which , if your happiness be set on this union , I think he will not , - let me know , and leave the rest to me . "
463761	463772	463774	463774	Leonard	450	" And to thee , perhaps , O my mother ! "
463780	463818	463976	463977	the parson	1499	" to thee , perhaps , even in thy grave , I shall owe the partner of my life , as to the mystic breath of thy genius I owe the first pure aspirations of my soul . "
463957	463974	463976	463977	the parson	1499	" Go in , my young friend ; I will wait without to know the issue , "
463981	464027	464113	464113	She	5469	" Go , and with gratitude to Heaven , learn how to bear the most precious joy that can befall mortal man ; or how to submit to youth 's sharpest sorrow , with the humble belief that even sorrow is but some mercy concealed . "
464124	464142	464241	464241	He	450	" that she believed Lady Lansmere was in her room , - she would go for her , "
464182	464240	464255	464255	his	450	" Oh , Miss Digby - oh , Helen - is it thus that you greet me , - rather thus that you shun me ? Could I have foreseen this when we two orphans stood by the mournful bridge , - so friendless , so desolate , and so clinging each to each ? Happy time ! "
464260	464287	464322	464322	He	450	" I must not hear you . Do not talk so , Leonard , you break my heart . Let me go , let me go ! "
464288	464321	464365	464365	she	5469	" Is it that I am grown hateful to you ; is it merely that you see my love and would discourage it ? Helen , speak to me , - speak ! "
464358	464364	464365	464365	she	5469	" You do not know , "
464375	464421	464441	464441	his	450	" you do not know the new claims on me , my altered position , how I am bound , or you would be the last to speak thus to me , the first to give me courage , and bid me - bid me - "
464422	464427	464437	464437	Helen	894	" Bid you what ? "
464428	464435	464461	464461	Leonard	450	" Feel nothing here but duty ! "
464455	464459	464477	464477	he	450	" Miss Digby , "
464485	464587	464683	464683	she	5469	" you speak of new claims on you , your altered position - I comprehend . You may retain some tender remembrance of the past ; but your duty now is to rebuke my presumption . It is as I thought and feared . This vain reputation which I have made is but a hollow sound , - it gives me no rank , assures me no fortune . I have no right to look for the Helen of old in the Helen of to - day . Be it so - forget what I have said , and forgive me . "
464679	464682	464683	464683	she	5469	" Brother ! "
464687	464690	464732	464732	his	450	" brother ! "
464736	464783	464683	464683	she	5469	" Too late to accept that tie , - too late even for friendship . Henceforth - for long years to come - henceforth , till this heart has ceased to beat at your name to thrill at your presence , we two - are strangers . "
464784	464990	464996	464996	Leonard	450	" Strangers ! Well - yes , it is right - it must be so ; we must not meet . Oh , Leonard Fairfield , who was it that in those days that you recall to me , who was it that found you destitute and obscure ; who , not degrading you by charity , placed you in your right career ; opened to you , amidst the labyrinth in which you were well - nigh lost , the broad road to knowledge , independence , fame ? Answer me , - answer ! Was it not the same who reared , sheltered your sister orphan ? If I could forget what I have owed to him , should I not remember what he has done for you ? Can I hear of your distinction , and not remember it ? Can I think how proud she may be who will one day lean on your arm , and bear the name you have already raised beyond all the titles of an hour , - can I think of this , and not remember our common friend , benefactor , guardian ? Would you forgive me , if I failed to do so ? "
464991	464994	464996	464996	Leonard	450	" But , "
465008	465033	464683	464683	she	5469	" but is it that Lord L'Estrange would not consent to our union ? Or of what do you speak ? You bewilder me . "
465065	465199	465348	465348	Helen	894	" He came to me , our noble friend . I never dreamed of it . He did not tell me that he loved me . He told me that he was unhappy , alone ; that in me , and only in me , he could find a comforter , a soother - He , he ! And I had just arrived in England , was under his mother 's roof , had not then once more seen you ; and - and - what could I answer ? Strengthen me , strengthen me , you whom I look up to and revere . Yes , yes , you are right . We must see each other no more . I am betrothed to another , - to him ! Strengthen me ! "
465216	465347	465792	465792	Leonard	450	" Oh , Helen - sister - Miss Digby , forgive me . You need no strength from me ; I borrow it from you . I comprehend you , I respect . Banish all thought of me . Repay our common benefactor . Be what he asks of you , - his comforter , his soother ; be more , - his pride and his joy . Happiness will come to you , as it comes to those who confer happiness and forget self . God comfort you in the passing struggle ; God bless you , in the long years to come . Sister , I accept the holy name now , and will claim it hereafter , when I too can think more of others than myself . "
465738	465747	465792	465792	Leonard	450	" Uncaeque manus , et pallida semper Ora . "
465748	465759	465855	465855	he	12912	" Hands armed with fangs , and lips forever pale . "
465848	465853	465855	465855	he	12912	" Hold , madam , "
465868	465987	465865	465865	his	12912	" I can not heed your questions , - I am filled with the question I must put to yourself . You opposed my boyish love for Leonora Avenel . I do not blame you , - all mothers of equal rank would have done the same . Yet , had you not frustrated all frank intercourse with her , I might have taken refusal from her own lips , - survived that grief , and now been a happy man . Years since then have rolled away , - rolled over her quiet slumbers , and my restless waking life . All this time were you aware that Audley Egerton had been the lover of Leonora Avenel ? "
465988	466013	466029	466029	Harley	503	" Harley , Harley ! do not speak to me in that cruel voice , do not look at me with those hard eyes ! "
466014	466027	466029	466029	Harley	503	" You knew it , then , - you , my mother ! "
466036	466076	465865	465865	his	12912	" and why did you never say , ' Son , you are wasting the bloom and uses of your life in sorrowful fidelity to a lie ! You are lavishing trust and friendship on a perfidious hypocrite . ' "
466077	466138	466029	466029	Harley	503	" How could I speak to you thus ; how could I dare to do so , seeing you still so cherished the memory of that unhappy girl , still believed that she had returned your affection ? Had I said to you what I knew but not till after her death , as to her relations with Audley Egerton - "
466139	466153	465865	465865	his	12912	" Well ? You falter ; go on ; had you done so ? "
466154	466263	466029	466029	Harley	503	" Would you have felt no desire for revenge ? Might there not have been strife between you , danger , bloodshed ? Harley , Harley ! Is not such silence pardonable in a mother ? And why deprive you too of the only friend you seemed to prize ; who alone had some influence over you ; who concurred with me in the prayer and hope , that some day you would find a living partner worthy to replace this lost delusion , arouse your faculties , - be the ornament your youth promised to your country ? For you wrong Audley , - indeed you do ! "
466264	466278	465865	465865	his	12912	" Wrong him ! Ah , let me not do that . Proceed . "
466279	466320	466029	466029	Harley	503	" I do not excuse him his rivalship , nor his first concealment of it . But believe me , since then , his genuine remorse , his anxious tenderness for your welfare , his dread of losing your friendship - "
466321	466356	465865	465865	his	12912	" Stop ! It was doubtless Audley Egerton who induced you yourself to conceal what you call his ' relations ' with her whom I can now so calmly name , - Leonora Avenel ? "
466357	466370	466029	466029	Harley	503	" It was so , in truth ; and from motives that - "
466371	466380	465865	465865	his	12912	" Enough ! let me hear no more . "
466381	466435	466029	466029	Harley	503	" But you will not think too sternly of what is past ? You are about to form new ties . You can not be wild and wicked enough to meditate what your brow seems to threaten . You can not dream of revenge , - risk Audley 's life or your own ? "
466436	466758	466790	466790	she	8099	" Tut , tut , tut ! What cause here for duels ? Single combats are out of date ; civilized men do not slay each other with sword and pistol . Tut ! revenge ! Does it look like revenge , that one object which brings me hither is to request my father 's permission to charge myself with the care of Audley Egerton 's election ? What he values most in the world is his political position ; and here his political existence is at stake . You know that I have had through life the character of a weak , easy , somewhat over - generous man . Such men are not revengeful . Hold ! You lay your hand on my arm , - I know the magic of that light touch , Mother ; but its power over me is gone . Countess of Lansmere , hear me ! Ever from infancy save in that frantic passion for which I now despise myself , I have obeyed you , I trust , as a duteous son . Now , our relative positions are somewhat altered . I have the right to exact - I will not say to command - the right which wrong and injury bestow upon all men . Madam , the injured man has prerogatives that rival those of kings . I now call upon you to question me no more ; not again to breathe the name of Leonora Avenel , unless I invite the subject ; and not to inform Audley Egerton by a hint , by a breath , that I have discovered - what shall I call it ? - his ' pardonable deceit . ' Promise me this , by your affection as mother , and on your faith as gentlewoman ; or I declare solemnly , that never in life will you look upon my face again . "
466777	466789	466790	466790	she	8099	" Is this my son , - this my gentle Harley ? "
466794	466815	466831	466831	he	503	" Oh , put your arms round my neck ; let me feel that I have not lost my child ! "
466850	466856	466831	466831	he	503	" Have I your promise ? "
466857	466885	466891	466891	Harley	503	" You have , you have ; but on condition that there pass no words between you and Audley that can end but in the strife which - "
466886	466889	466891	466891	Harley	503	" Strife ! "
466893	466951	466972	466972	he	503	" I repeat that the idea of challenge and duel between me and my friend from our school days , and on a quarrel that we could explain to no seconds , would be a burlesque upon all that is grave in the realities of life and feeling . I accept your promise and seal it thus - "
466968	466971	466972	466972	he	503	" Hush , "
466980	466988	467042	467043	The countess	8099	" I hear my father 's voice . "
467056	467120	467450	467451	the earl	2072	" I was occupied with my architect in designs for the new infirmary , of which I shall make a present to our county . I have only just heard that you were here , Harley . What is all this about our fair Italian guest ? Is she not coming back to us ? Your mother refers me to you for explanations . "
467121	467142	467042	467043	The countess	8099	" You shall have them later , my dear father ; at present I can think only of public affairs . "
467143	467221	467450	467451	the earl	2072	" Public affairs ! they are indeed alarming . I am rejoiced to hear you express yourself so worthily . An awful crisis , Harley ! And , gracious Heaven ! I have heard that a low man , who was born in Lansmere , but made a fortune in America , is about to contest the borough . They tell me he is one of the Avenels , - a born Blue ; is it possible ? "
467222	467289	467042	467043	The countess	8099	" I have come here on that business . As a peer you can not , of course , interfere ; but I propose , with your leave , to go down myself to Lansmere , and undertake the superintendence of , the election . It would be better , perhaps , if you were not present ; it would give us more liberty of action . "
467290	467325	467450	467451	the earl	2072	" My dear Harley , shake hands ; anything you please . You know how I have wished to see you come forward , and take that part in life which becomes your birth . "
467326	467339	467353	467354	the earl	2072	" Ah , you think I have sadly wasted my existence hitherto . "
467340	467351	467353	467354	the earl	2072	" To be frank with you , yes , Harley , "
467374	467431	467450	467451	the earl	2072	" The more we take from our country , the more we owe to her . From the moment you came into the world as the inheritor of lands and honours , you were charged with a trust for the benefit of others , that it degrades one of our order of gentleman not to discharge . "
467445	467448	467450	467451	the earl	2072	" Indeed , "
467453	467625	467371	467371	its	12939	" I would rather you were about to canvass for yourself than for your friend Egerton . But I grant he is an example that it is never too late to follow . Why , who that had seen you both as youths , notwithstanding Audley had the advantage of being some years your senior - who could have thought that he was the one to become distinguished and eminent , and you to degenerate into the luxurious idler , averse to all trouble and careless of all fame ? You , with such advantages , not only of higher fortunes , but , as every one said , of superior talents ; you , who had then so much ambition , so keen a desire for glory , sleeping with Plutarch 's Lives under your pillow , and only , my wild son , only too much energy . But you are a young man still ; it is not too late to redeem the years you have thrown away . "
467626	467711	467721	467722	the earl	2072	" The years are nothing , - mere dates in an almanac ; but the feelings , what can give me back those ? - the hope , the enthusiasm , the - No matter ! feelings do not , help men to rise in the world . Egerton 's feelings are not too lively . What I might have been , leave it to me to remember ; let us talk of the example you set before me , - of Audley Egerton . "
467712	467719	467721	467722	the earl	2072	" We must get him in , "
467731	467765	467371	467371	its	12939	" It is of more importance to him than I even thought for . But you know his secrets . Why did you not confide to me frankly the state of his affairs ? "
467766	467792	467721	467722	the earl	2072	" His affairs ? Do you mean that they are seriously embarrassed ? This interests me much . Pray speak ; what do you know ? "
467793	467922	467933	467933	Harley	503	" He has discharged the greater part of his establishment . That in itself is natural on quitting office ; but still it set people talking ; and it has got wind that his estates are not only mortgaged for more than they are worth , but that he has been living upon the discount of bills ; in short , he has been too intimate with a man whom we all know by sight , - a man who drives the finest horses in London , and they tell me but that I can not believe lives in the familiar society of the young puppies he snares to perdition . What 's the man 's name ? Levy , is it not ? - yes , Levy . "
467923	467931	467933	467933	Harley	503	" I have seen Levy with him , "
467945	467954	467967	467968	the earl	2072	" Levy - Levy - it is well . "
467955	467965	467967	467968	the earl	2072	" I hear but the gossip of the clubs , "
467970	468077	468085	468085	Harley	503	" but they do say that Levy makes little disguise of his power over our very distinguished friend , and rather parades it as a merit with our party and , indeed , with all men - for Egerton has personal friends in every party that he keeps sundry bills locked up in his desk until Egerton is once more safe in parliament . Nevertheless if , after all , our friend were to lose his election , and Levy were then to seize on his effects , and proclaim his ruin , it would seriously damage , perhaps altogether destroy , Audley 's political career . "
468078	468083	468085	468085	Harley	503	" So I conclude , "
468087	468160	467967	467968	the earl	2072	" A Charles Fox might be a gamester , and a William Pitt be a pauper . But Audley Egerton is not of their giant stature ; he stands so high because he stands upon heaps of respectable gold . Audley Egerton , needy and impoverished , out of parliament , and , as the vulgar slang has it , out at elbows , skulking from duns , perhaps in the Bench - "
468161	468177	468085	468085	Harley	503	" No , no ; our party would never allow that ; we would subscribe - "
468178	468236	468392	468393	the earl	2072	" Worse than all , living as the pensioner of the party he aspired to lead ! You say truly , his political prospects would be blasted . A man whose reputation lay in his outward respectability ! Why , people would say that Audley Egerton has been - a solemn lie ; eh , my father ? "
468237	468390	468392	468393	the earl	2072	" How can you talk with such coolness of your friend ? You need say nothing to interest me in his election - if you mean that . Once in parliament , he must soon again be in office , - and learn to live on his salary . You must get him to submit to me the schedule of his liabilities . I have a head for business , as you know . I will arrange his affairs for him . And I will yet bet five to one , though I hate wagers , that he will be prime minister in three years . He is not brilliant , it is true ; but just at this crisis we want a safe , moderate , judicious , conciliatory man ; and Audley has so much tact , such experience of the House , such knowledge of the world , and , "
468401	468409	468392	468393	the earl	2072	" he is so thorough a gentleman ! "
468410	468493	468553	468554	the earl	2072	" A thorough gentleman , as you say , - the soul of honour ! But , my dear father , it is your hour for riding ; let me not detain you . It is settled , then ; you do not come yourself to Lansmere . You put the house at my disposal , and allow me to invite Egerton , of course , and what other guests I may please ; in short , you leave all to me ? "
468494	468551	468702	468702	he	503	" Certainly ; and if you can not get in your friend , who can ? That borough , it is an awkward , ungrateful place , and has been the plague of my life . So much as I have spent there , too , - so much as I have done to its trade ! "
468691	468699	469422	469424	the dead Nora	12975	" the solemn plausibilities of the world . "
469434	469448	469604	469605	the visitor	2876	" Restore what thou hast taken from us , or pay the forfeit ! "
469590	469602	469604	469605	the visitor	2876	" It is so long since your Lordship has seen me , "
469611	469630	469636	469636	Harley	503	" that I can not wonder you do not recognize my person , and have forgotten my name . "
469631	469634	469693	469693	my	0	" Sir , "
469696	469696	469743	469743	HARLEY	503	"
469697	469742	469743	469743	HARLEY	503	" Yet pardon me if I still linger . My name is Dale . I was formerly curate at Lansmere ; and I would speak to your Lordship in the name and the memory of one once dear to you , - Leonora Avenel . "
469750	469799	469800	469802	MR . DALE	446	" Sir , I can not conjecture your business . But be seated . I remember you now , though years have altered both , and I have since heard much in your favour from Leonard Fairfield . Still let me pray , that you will be brief . "
469805	469863	469864	469864	HARLEY	503	" May I assume at once that you have divined the parentage of the young man you call Fairfield ? When I listened to his grateful praises of your beneficence , and marked with melancholy pleasure the reverence in which he holds you , my heart swelled within me . I acknowledged the mysterious force of nature . "
469867	469877	469878	469880	MR . DALE	446	" Force of nature ! You talk in riddles . "
469884	469914	469928	469928	he	503	" Oh , my Lord , how can you so disguise your better self ? Surely in Leonard Fairfield you have long since recognized the son of Nora Avenel ? "
469923	469926	469987	469987	he	450	" Ah , "
469992	469992	469993	469995	MR . DALE	446	"
470005	470030	470031	470031	HARLEY	503	" I honour your compunction , my Lord . Oh , let your heart and your conscience continue to speak to your worldly pride . "
470034	470049	470050	470052	MR . DALE	446	" My compunction , heart , conscience ! Mr. Dale , you insult me ! "
470056	470090	470115	470115	he	503	" Not so ; I am fulfilling my mission , which bids me rebuke the sinner . Leonora Avenel speaks in me , and commands the guilty father to acknowledge the innocent child ! "
470110	470113	470169	470169	you	12990	" Ha ! "
470180	470180	470191	470192	Mr. Dale	446	"
470181	470189	470323	470324	the parson	1499	" I ask from you his happiness , "
470309	470321	470323	470324	the parson	1499	" Anxious , as you may believe , for his success , "
470326	470560	470567	470567	Harley	503	" I waited without your gates till he came from Miss Digby 's presence . And oh , my Lord , had you but seen his face ! - such emotion and such despair ! I could not learn from him what had passed . He escaped from me and rushed away . All that I could gather was from a few broken words , and from those words I formed the conjecture it may be erroneous that the obstacle to his happiness was not in Helen 's heart , my Lord , but seemed to me as if it were in yourself . Therefore , when he had vanished from my sight , I took courage , and came at , once to you . If he be your son , and Helen Digby be your ward , - she herself an orphan , dependent on your bounty , - why should they be severed ? Equals in years , united by early circumstance , congenial , it seems , in simple habits and refined tastes , - what should hinder their union , unless it be the want of fortune ? And all men know your wealth , none ever questioned your generosity . My Lord , my Lord , your look freezes me . If I have offended , do not visit my offence on him , - on Leonard ! "
470561	470565	470642	470642	He	13003	" And so , "
470665	470665	470757	470759	the poor parson	5143	"
470666	470740	470747	470747	Harley	503	" Oh , my Lord , your affianced bride ! I never dreamed of this . I implore your pardon . The very thought is so terrible , so unnatural ! the son to woo the father 's ! Oh , what sin have I fallen into ! The sin was mine , - I urged and persuaded him to it . He was ignorant as myself . Forgive him , forgive him ! "
470741	470745	470761	470761	himself	5143	" Mr. Dale , "
470768	470817	470757	470759	the poor parson	5143	" Mr. Dale , you are a good man , - if , indeed , this universe of liars contains some man who does not cheat our judgment when we deem him honest . Allow me only to ask why you consider Leonard Fairfield to be my son . "
470818	470865	470761	470761	himself	5143	" Was not your youthful admiration for poor Nora evident to me ? Remember I was a frequent guest at Lansmere Park ; and it was so natural that you , with all your brilliant gifts , should captivate her refined fancy , her affectionate heart . "
470866	470877	470757	470759	the poor parson	5143	" Natural - you think so , - go on . "
470878	470979	470990	470991	the parson	1499	" Your mother , as became her , separated you . It was not unknown to me that you still cherished a passion which your rank forbade to be lawful . Poor girl ! she left the roof of her protectress , Lady Jane . Nothing was known of her till she came to her father 's house to give birth to a child , and die . And the same day that dawned on her corpse , you hurried from the place . Ah , no doubt your conscience smote you ; you have never returned to Lansmere since . "
470994	471011	470985	470985	he	503	" Whom could I suspect but you ? I made inquiries : they confirmed my suspicions . "
471012	471041	470990	470991	the parson	1499	" Perhaps you inquired of my friend , Mr. Egerton ? He was with me when - when - as you say , I hurried from the place . "
471042	471049	470985	470985	he	503	" I did , my Lord . "
471050	471054	470990	470991	the parson	1499	" And he ? "
471055	471087	471094	471094	Harley	503	" Denied your guilt ; but still , a man of honour so nice , of heart so feeling , could not feign readily . His denial did not deceive me . "
471088	471092	471097	471097	his	503	" Honest man ! "
471121	471132	470990	470991	the parson	1499	" He knew she had left a son , too ? "
471133	471148	471097	471097	his	503	" He did , my Lord ; of course , I told him that . "
471149	471210	470990	470991	the parson	1499	" The son whom I found starving in the streets of London ! Mr. Dale , as you see , your words move me very much . I can not deny that he who wronged , it may be with no common treachery , that young mother - for Nora Avenel was not one to be lightly seduced into error - "
471211	471216	471097	471097	his	503	" Indeed , no ! "
471217	471269	471282	471283	the parson	1499	" And who then thought no more of the offspring of her anguish and his own crime - I can not deny that that man deserves some chastisement , - should render some atonement . Am I not right here ? Answer with the plain speech which becomes your sacred calling . "
471270	471280	471282	471283	the parson	1499	" I can not say otherwise , my Lord , "
471293	471299	471305	471305	Harley	503	" But if he repent - "
471300	471303	471305	471305	Harley	503	" Enough , "
471307	471368	471305	471305	Harley	503	" I now invite you to visit me at Lansmere ; give me your address , and I will apprise you of the day on which I will request your presence . Leonard Fairfield shall find a father - I was about to say , worthy of himself . For the rest - stay ; reseat yourself . For the rest "
471383	471599	471628	471629	LORD L'ESTRANGE	502	" I will not yet say whether I can , or ought to , resign to a younger and fairer suitor the lady who has accepted my own hand . I have no reason yet to believe that she prefers him . But what think you , meanwhile , of this proposal ? Mr. Avenel wishes his nephew to contest the borough of Lansmere , has urged me to obtain the young man 's consent . True , that he may thus endanger the seat of Mr. Audley Egerton . What then ? Mr. Audley Egerton is a great man , and may find another seat ; that should not stand in the way . Let Leonard obey his uncle . If he win the election , why , he 'll be a more equal match , in the world 's eye , for Miss Digby , that is , should she prefer him to myself ; and if she do not , still , in public life , there is a cure for all private sorrow . That is a maxim of Mr. Audley Egerton 's ; and he , you know , is a man not only of the nicest honour , but the deepest worldly wisdom . Do you like my proposition ? "
471600	471611	471305	471305	Harley	503	" It seems to me most considerate , most generous . "
471612	471627	471953	471953	Harley	503	" Then you shall take to Leonard the lines I am about to write . "
471945	471951	471953	471953	Harley	503	" There , Mr. Dale , "
471969	472062	472074	472075	the parson	1499	" there , you shall deliver this note to your friend . But no ; upon second thoughts , since he does not yet know of your visit to me , it is best that he should be still in ignorance of it . For should Miss Digby resolve to abide by her present engagements , it were surely kind to save Leonard the pain of learning that you had communicated to me that rivalry he himself had concealed . Let all that has passed between us be kept in strict confidence . "
472063	472072	472181	472181	Harley	503	" I will obey you , my Lord , "
472170	472179	472181	472181	Harley	503	" It is well , - very well , "
472192	472234	472315	472317	the unhappy man	13026	" The viper and the viper 's brood ! So it was this man 's son that I led from the dire Slough of Despond ; and the son unconsciously imitates the father 's gratitude and honour - Ha , ha ! "
472310	472313	472315	472317	the unhappy man	13026	" Fool ! "
472325	472514	472553	472553	she	894	" fool ! what then ? Were I free , would it be to trust my fate again to falsehood ? If , in all the bloom and glory of my youth , I failed to win the heart of a village girl ; if , once more deluding myself , it is in vain that I have tended , reared , cherished , some germ of woman 's human affection in the orphan I saved from penury , - how look for love in the brilliant princess , whom all the sleek Lotharios of our gaudy world will surround with their homage when once she alights on their sphere ! If perfidy be my fate - what hell of hells , in the thought ! - that a wife might lay her head in my bosom , and - oh , horror ! horror ! No ! I would not accept her hand were it offered , nor believe in her love were it pledged to me . Stern soul of mine , wise at last , love never more , - never more believe in truth ! "
472545	472552	472553	472553	she	894	" May I speak with you ? "
472561	472570	472605	472605	he	503	" I have been listening for your footstep . "
472598	472603	472605	472605	he	503	" I , too , "
472607	472642	472658	472658	she	894	" meant to seek an interview with yourself - but later . You would speak to me , Helen , - say on . Ah , child , what mean you ? Why this ? "
472652	472657	472830	472830	Helen	894	" Let me kneel , "
472670	472828	472833	472833	her	894	" Let me kneel till I have explained all , and perhaps won your pardon . You said something the other evening . It has weighed on my heart and my conscience ever since . You said ' that I should have no secret from you ; for that , in our relation to each other , would be deceit . ' I have had a secret ; but oh , believe me ! it was long ere it was clearly visible to myself . You honoured me with a suit so far beyond my birth , my merits . You said that I might console and comfort you . At those words , what answer could I give , - I , who owe you so much more than a daughter 's duty ? And I thought that my affections were free , - that they would obey that duty . But - but - but - "
472845	473099	473107	473107	Harley	503	" I deceived myself . I again saw him who had been all in the world to me , when the world was so terrible , and then - and then - I trembled . I was terrified at my own memories , my own thoughts . Still I struggled to banish the past , resolutely , firmly . Oh , you believe me , do you not ? And I hoped to conquer . Yet ever since those words of yours , I felt that I ought to tell you even of the struggle . This is the first time we have met since you spoke them . And now - now - I have seen him again , and - and - though not by a word could she you had deigned to woo as your bride encourage hope in another ; though there - there where you now stand - he bade me farewell , and we parted as if forever , - yet - yet O Lord L'Estrange ! in return for your rank , wealth , your still nobler gifts of nature , what should I bring ? - Something more than gratitude , esteem ; reverence , - at least an undivided heart , filled with your image , and yours alone . And this I can not give . Pardon me , - not for what I say now , but for not saying it before . Pardon me , O my benefactor , pardon me ! "
473100	473105	473130	473130	he	503	" Rise , Helen , "
473125	473128	473130	473130	he	503	" Rise ! "
473142	473212	473222	473222	Helen	894	" Let me look at your face . There seems no guile here . These tears are surely honest . If I can not be loved , it is my fate , and not your crime . Now , listen to me . If you grant me nothing else , will you give me the obedience which the ward owes to the guardian , the child to the parent ? "
473213	473220	473130	473130	he	503	" Yes , oh , yes ! "
473224	473313	473130	473130	he	503	" Then while I release you from all troth to me , I claim the right to refuse , if I so please it , my assent to the suit of - of the person you prefer . I acquit you of deceit , but I reserve to myself the judgment I shall pass on him . Until I myself sanction that suit , will you promise not to recall in any way the rejection which , if I understand you rightly , you have given to it ? "
473314	473318	473130	473130	he	503	" I promise . "
473319	473338	473357	473357	Harley	503	" And if I say to you , ' Helen , this man is not worthy of you ' "
473339	473356	473357	473357	Harley	503	" No , no ! do not say that , - I could not believe you . "
473364	473398	473130	473130	he	503	" If , then , I say , ' Ask me not wherefore , but I forbid you to be the wife of Leonard Fairfield , I what would be your answer ? ' "
473399	473429	473438	473438	Harley	503	" Ah , my Lord , if you can but comfort him , do with me as you will ! but do not command me to break his heart . "
473430	473436	473438	473438	Harley	503	" Oh , silly child , "
473443	473523	473524	473524	He	503	" hearts are not found in the race from which that man sprang . But I take your promise , with its credulous condition . Helen , I pity you . I have been as weak as you , bearded man though I be . Some day or other , you and I may live to laugh at the follies at which you weep now . I can give you no other comfort , for I know of none . "
473536	473594	473616	473616	Harley	503	" I shall not see you again for some days , Helen . Perhaps I may request my mother to join me at Lansmere ; if so , I shall pray you to accompany her . For the present , let all believe that our position is unchanged . The time will soon come when I may - "
473603	473614	473616	473616	Harley	503	" I may release you from all duties to me , "
473624	473649	473733	473733	Randal	570	" or I may claim your promise in spite of the condition ; for your lover 's heart will not be broken . Adieu ! "
473727	473731	473733	473733	Randal	570	" Lord L'Estrange , "
473735	473801	474051	474051	Randal	570	" I must stop you . I have been to Norwood , and seen our noble friend . He has confided to me , of course , all that passed . How can I express my gratitude to you ! By what rare talent , with what signal courage , you have saved the happiness - perhaps even the honour - of my plighted bride ! "
473802	473826	473733	473733	Randal	570	" Your bride ! The duke , then , still holds to the promise you were fortunate enough to obtain from Dr. Riccabocca ? "
473827	473846	474051	474051	Randal	570	" He confirms that promise more solemnly than ever . You may well be surprised at his magnanimity . "
473847	473886	473733	473733	Randal	570	" No ; he is a philosopher , - nothing in him can surprise me . But he seemed to think , when I saw him , that there were circumstances you might find it hard to explain . "
473887	473924	474051	474051	Randal	570	" Hard ! Nothing so easy . Allow me to tender to you the same explanations which satisfied one whom philosophy itself has made as open to truth as he is clear - sighted to imposture . "
473925	473981	473990	473990	Randal	570	" Another time , Mr. Leslie . If your bride 's father be satisfied , what right have I to doubt ? By the way , you stand for Lansmere . Do me the favour to fix your quarters at the Park during the election . You will , of course , accompany Mr. Egerton . "
473982	473988	474046	474046	Harley	503	" You are most kind , "
473995	474045	474089	474089	himself	503	" You accept ? That is well . We shall then have ample opportunity for those explanations which you honour me by offering ; and , to make your visit still more agreeable , I may perhaps induce our friends at Norwood to meet you . Good - day . "
474074	474085	474089	474089	himself	503	" I am about to hold the balance of justice , "
474091	474192	474089	474089	himself	503	" I will cast the light - weight of that knave into the scale . Violante never can be mine ; but I did not save her from a Peschiera to leave her to a Randal Leslie . Ha , ha ! Audley Egerton has some human feeling , - tenderness for that youth whom he has selected from the world , in which he left Nora 's child to the jaws of Famine . Through that side I can reach at his heart , and prove him a fool like myself , where he esteemed and confided ! Good . "
474213	474249	474089	474089	himself	503	" My dear Lord L'Estrange , let me shake you by the hand ; for Heaven knows when I may see you again , and you have suffered me to assist in one good action . "
474250	474281	474089	474089	himself	503	" Frank Hazeldean , I am pleased indeed to meet you . Why do you indulge in that melancholy doubt as to the time when I may see you again ? "
474282	474312	474348	474348	he	13035	" I have just got leave of absence . I am not well , and I am rather hipped , so I shall go abroad for a few weeks . "
474340	474346	474375	474375	He	13035	" Another dupe to affection , "
474358	474374	474404	474404	he	13035	" of course , a dupe ; he is honest and artless - at present . "
474390	474402	474404	474404	he	13035	" I conceive how you now grieve , my young friend , "
474406	474423	474375	474375	He	13035	" but you will congratulate yourself hereafter on what this day seems to you an affliction . "
474424	474429	474404	474404	he	13035	" My dear Lord - "
474430	474452	474375	474375	He	13035	" I am much older than you , but not old enough for such formal ceremony . Pray call me L'Estrange . "
474453	474633	474404	474404	he	13035	" Thank you ; and I should indeed like to speak to you as a friend . There is a thought on my mind which haunts me . I dare say it is foolish enough , but I am sure you will not laugh at me . You heard what Madame di Negra said to me last night . I have been trifled with and misled , but I can not forget so soon how dear to me that woman was . I am not going to bore you with such nonsense ; but from what I can understand , her brother is likely to lose all his fortune ; and , even if not , he is a sad scoundrel . I can not bear the thought that she should be so dependent on him , that she may come to want . After all , there must be good in her , - good in her to refuse my hand if she did not love me . A mercenary woman so circumstanced would not have done that . "
474634	474697	474375	474375	He	13035	" You are quite right . But do not torment yourself with such generous fears . Madame di Negra shall not come to want , shall not be dependent on her infamous brother . The first act of the Duke of Serrano , on regaining his estates , will be a suitable provision for his kinswoman . I will answer for this . "
474698	474831	474404	474404	he	13035	" You take a load off my mind . I did mean to ask you to intercede with Riccabocca , - that is , the duke it is so hard to think he can be a duke ! - I , alas ! have nothing in my power to bestow upon Madame di Negra . I may , indeed , sell my commission ; but then I have a debt which I long to pay off , and the sale of the commission would not suffice even for that ; and perhaps my father might be still more angry if I do sell it . Well , good - by . I shall now go away happy , - that is , comparatively . One must bear things like - a man ! "
474832	474876	474375	474375	He	13035	" I should like , however , to see you again before you go abroad . I will call on you . Meanwhile , can you tell me the number of one Baron Levy ? He lives in this street , I know . "
474877	474929	474404	474404	he	13035	" Levy ! Oh , have no dealings with him , I advise , I entreat you ! He is the most plausible , dangerous rascal ; and , for Heaven 's sake ! pray be warned by me , and let nothing entangle you into - a POST - OBIT ! "
474930	474964	474375	474375	He	13035	" Be re - assured , I am more accustomed to lend money than borrow it ; and as to a post - obit , I have a foolish prejudice against such transactions . "
474965	475027	474404	474404	he	13035	" Do n't call it foolish , L'Estrange ; I honour you for it . How I wish I had known you earlier - so few men of the world are like you . Even Randal Leslie , who is so faultless in most things , and never gets into a scrape himself , called my own scruples foolish . However - "
475028	475055	474375	474375	He	13035	" Stay - Randal Leslie ! What ! He advised you to borrow on a post - obit , and probably shared the loan with you ? "
475056	475065	474404	474404	he	13035	" Oh , no ; not a shilling . "
475066	475110	475324	475324	Harley	503	" Tell me all about it , Frank . Perhaps , as I see that Levy is mixed up in the affair , your information may be useful to myself , and put me on my guard in dealing with that popular gentleman . "
475318	475322	475324	475324	Harley	503	" So then , "
475326	475345	475847	475848	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Mr. Leslie assured you of Madame di Negra 's affection , when you yourself doubted of it ? "
475346	475361	475324	475324	Harley	503	" Yes ; she took him in , even more than she did me . "
475362	475384	475847	475848	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Simple Mr. Leslie ! And the same kind friend ? - who is related to you , did you say ? "
475385	475392	475324	475324	Harley	503	" His grandmother was a Hazeldean . "
475393	475434	475847	475848	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Humph . The same kind relation led you to believe that you could pay off this bond with the marchesa 's portion , and that he could obtain the consent of your parents to your marriage with that lady ? "
475435	475455	475324	475324	Harley	503	" I ought to have known better ; my father 's prejudices against foreigners and Papists are so strong . "
475456	475498	475847	475848	Lord L'Estrange	502	" And now Mr. Leslie concurs with you , that it is best for you to go abroad , and trust to his intercession with your father . He has evidently , then , gained a great influence over Mr. Hazeldean . "
475499	475529	475324	475324	Harley	503	" My father naturally compares me with him , - he so clever , so promising , so regular in his habits , and I such a reckless scapegrace . "
475530	475548	475847	475848	Lord L'Estrange	502	" And the bulk of your father 's property is unentailed ; Mr. Hazeldean might disinherit you ? "
475549	475559	475324	475324	Harley	503	" I deserve it . I hope he will . "
475560	475589	475629	475629	Frank	449	" You have no brothers nor sisters , - no relation , perhaps , after your parents , nearer to you than your excellent friend Mr. Randal Leslie ? "
475590	475627	475324	475324	Harley	503	" No ; that is the reason he is so kind to me , otherwise I am the last person to suit him . You have no idea how well - informed and clever he is , "
475639	475654	475324	475324	Harley	503	" My dear Hazeldean , you will take my advice , will you not ? "
475655	475663	475324	475324	Harley	503	" Certainly . You are too good . "
475664	475744	475324	475324	Harley	503	" Let all your family , Mr. Leslie included , suppose you to be gone abroad ; but stay quietly in England , and within a day 's journey of Lansmere Park . I am obliged to go thither for the approaching election . I may ask you to come over . I think I see a way to serve you ; and if so , you will soon hear from me . Now , Baron Levy 's number ? "
475745	475776	475324	475324	Harley	503	" That is the house with the cabriolet at the door . How such a fellow can have such a horse ! - ' t is out of all keeping ! "
475777	475820	475324	475324	Harley	503	" Not at all ; horses are high - spirited , generous , unsuspicious animals . They never know if it is a rogue who drives them . I have your promise , then , and you will send me your address ? "
475821	475846	475924	475924	he	17518	" I will . Strange that I feel more confidence in you than I do even in Randal . Do take care of Levy . "
475916	475922	475936	475937	Lord L'Estrange	502	" This is an honour , "
475926	475934	475936	475937	Lord L'Estrange	502	" You have a charming abode here , "
475942	475966	475978	475978	Levy	1175	" Very fine bronzes , - excellent taste . Your reception - rooms above are , doubtless , a model to all decorators ? "
475967	475976	475936	475937	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Would your Lordship condescend to see them ? "
475985	475991	475997	475997	Levy	1175	" With the greatest pleasure . "
475992	475995	475997	475997	Levy	1175	" Lights ! "
476007	476021	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Lights in the drawing - rooms , - it is growing dark . "
476072	476094	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" You are a wise man : there is no advantage in being rich , unless one enjoys one 's riches . "
476095	476103	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" My own maxim , Lord L'Estrange . "
476104	476187	476194	476194	Levy	1175	" And it is something , too , to have a taste for good society . Small pride would you have , my dear baron , in these rooms , luxurious though they are , if filled with guests of vulgar exterior and plebeian manners . It is only in the world in which we move that we find persons who harmonize , as it were , with the porcelain of Sevres , and these sofas that might have come from Versailles . "
476188	476192	476194	476194	Levy	1175	" I own , "
476196	476236	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" that I have what some may call a weakness in a parvenu like myself . I have a love for the beau monde . It is indeed a pleasure to me when I receive men like your Lordship . "
476237	476316	476328	476328	Levy	1175	" But why call yourself a parvenu ? Though you are contented to honour the name of Levy , we , in society , all know that you are the son of a long - descended English peer . Child of love , it is true ; but the Graces smile on those over whose birth Venus presided . Pardon my old - fashioned mythological similes , - they go so well with these rooms - Louis Quinze . "
476317	476326	476328	476328	Levy	1175	" Since you have touched on my birth , "
476343	476365	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" I do n't deny that it has had some effect on my habits and tastes in life . In fact - "
476366	476537	476552	476552	Levy	1175	" In fact , own that you would be a miserable man , in spite of all your wealth , if the young dandies , who throng to your banquets , were to cut you dead in the streets ; if , when your high - stepping horse stopped at your club , the porter shut the door in your face ; if , when you lounged into the opera - pit , handsome dog that you are , each spendthrift rake in ' Fop 's Alley , ' who now waits but the scratch of your pen to endorse billets doux with the charm that can chain to himself for a month some nymph of the Ballet , spinning round in a whirlwind of tulle , would shrink from the touch of your condescending forefinger with more dread of its contact than a bailiff 's tap in the thick of Pall Mall could inspire ; if , reduced to the company of city clerks , parasite led - captains - "
476538	476550	476552	476552	Levy	1175	" Oh , do n't go on , my dear Lord , "
476557	476592	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Impossible though the picture be , it is really appalling . Cut me off from May Fair and St. James 's , and I should go into my strong closet and hang myself . "
476593	476637	476644	476644	Levy	1175	" And yet , my dear baron , all this may happen if I have the whim just to try ; all this will happen , unless , ere I leave your house , you concede the conditions I come here to impose . "
476638	476642	476644	476644	Levy	1175	" My Lord ! "
476659	476672	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" if you were not under my own roof , I would - "
476673	477089	477236	477236	he	1175	" Truce with mock heroics . Sit down , sir , sit down . I will briefly state my threat , more briefly my conditions . You will be scarcely more prolix in your reply . Your fortune I can not touch , your enjoyment of it I can destroy . Refuse my conditions , make me your enemy , - and war to the knife ! I will interrogate all the young dupes you have ruined . I will learn the history of all the transactions by which you have gained the wealth that it pleases you to spend in courting the society and sharing the vices of men who - go with these rooms , Louis Quinze . Not a roguery of yours shall escape me , down even to your last notable connivance with an Italian reprobate for the criminal abduction of an heiress . All these particulars I will proclaim in the clubs to which you have gained admittance , in every club in London which you yet hope to creep into ; all these I will impart to some such authority in the Press as Mr. Henry Norreys ; all these I will , upon the voucher of my own name , have so published in some journals of repute , that you must either tacitly submit to the revelations that blast you , or bring before a court of law actions that will convert accusations into evidence . It is but by sufferance that you are now in society ; you are excluded when one man like me comes forth to denounce you . You try in vain to sneer at my menace - your white lips show your terror . I have rarely in life drawn any advantage from my rank and position ; but I am thankful that they give me the power to make my voice respected and my exposure triumphant . Now , Baron Levy , will you go into your strong closet and hang yourself , or will you grant me my very moderate conditions ? You are silent . I will relieve you , and state those conditions . Until the general election , about to take place , is concluded , you will obey me to the letter in all that I enjoin , - no demur and no scruple . And the first proof of obedience I demand is , your candid disclosure of all Mr. Audley Egerton 's pecuniary affairs . "
477090	477107	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Has my client , Mr. Egerton , authorized you to request of me that disclosure ? "
477108	477125	477143	477144	the baron	17518	" On the contrary , all that passes between us you will conceal from your client . "
477126	477141	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" You would save him from ruin ? Your trusty friend , Mr. Egerton ! "
477151	477178	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Wrong again , Baron Levy . If I would save him from ruin , you are scarcely the man I should ask to assist me . "
477179	477191	476067	476068	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Ah , I guess . You have learned how he - "
477192	477210	477236	477236	he	1175	" Guess nothing , but obey in all things . Let us descend to your business room . "
477240	477269	477326	477328	his noble visitor	13059	" If , Lord L'Estrange , you seek but revenge on Audley Egerton , you need not have uttered those threats . I too - hate the man . "
477335	477387	477326	477328	his noble visitor	13059	" Then I shall see you at Lansmere with Mr. Egerton , to assist in conducting his election . It is a sacrifice of your time worthy of your friendship ; not a step farther , I beg . Baron , I have the honour to wish you good - evening . "
477416	477440	477441	477441	Randal	570	" Ha , Mr. Leslie ! - you too a client of Baron Levy 's , - a very useful , accommodating man . "
477446	477480	477506	477506	Randal	570	" I come in haste from the House of Commons on Mr. Egerton 's business . Do n't you hear the newspaper vendors crying out ' Great News , Dissolution of Parliament ' ? "
477481	477505	477551	477551	Randal	570	" We are prepared . Levy himself consents to give us the aid of his talents . Kindly , obliging , clever person ! "
477544	477549	477551	477551	Randal	570	" How is this ? "
477553	477612	477618	477618	Levy	1175	" I come to tell you first of Peschiera 's utter failure , the ridiculous coxcomb , and I meet at your door the last man I thought to find there , - the man who foiled us all , Lord L'Estrange . What brought him to you ? Ah , perhaps his interest in Egerton 's election ? "
477613	477616	477618	477618	Levy	1175	" Yes , "
477622	477646	477551	477551	Randal	570	" I know all about Peschiera . I can not talk to you now ; I must make arrangements for going to Lansmere . "
477647	477670	477618	477618	Levy	1175	" But do n't forget my purchase from Thornhill . I shall have the money shortly from a surer source than Peschiera . "
477671	477675	477551	477551	Randal	570	" The squire ? "
477676	477686	477618	477618	Levy	1175	" Or a rich father - in - law . "

There , where thy softer victim slunk to death from the deceit of thy love , shall deceit like thine own dig a grave for thy frigid ambition . I borrow thy quiver of fraud ; its still arrows shall strike thee ; and thou too shalt say , when the barb pierces home , ' This comes from the hand of a friend . ' Ay , at Lansmere , at Lansmere , shall the end crown the whole ! Go , and dot on the canvas the lines for a lengthened perspective , where my eyes note already the vanishing point of the picture .

"
481822	481829	481732	481733	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Ah , if you would ! "
481835	481963	481732	481733	Lord L'Estrange	502	" You must give me the power to do so . You were obliging enough to volunteer to me the same explanations which you gave to the duke , his satisfaction with which induced him to renew or confirm the promise of his daughter 's hand . Should those explanations content me , as they did him , I hold the duke bound to fulfil his engagement , and I am convinced that his daughter would , in that case , not be inflexible to your suit . But , till such explanations be given , my friendship for the father , and my interest in the child , do not allow me to assist a cause which , however , at present suffers little by delay . "
481964	481974	481732	481733	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Pray , listen at once to those explanations . "
481975	482053	482194	482195	that gentleman	2108	" Nay , Mr. Leslie , I can now only think of the election . As soon as that is over , rely on it you shall have the amplest opportunity to dispel any doubts which your intimacy with Count di Peschiera and Madame di Negra may have suggested . - a propos of the election , here is a list of voters you must see at once in Fish Lane . Do n't lose a moment . "

483704	483780	484020	484020	Harley	503	" But ah , that it had been Violante ! Then I might have felt assured that the Future would efface the Past , - and found the courage to tell him all . And when last night I spoke of what Harley ought to be to England , how like were Violante 's eyes and smile to Nora 's , when Nora listened in delighted sympathy to the hopes of my own young ambition . "
484024	484060	484061	484061	HELEN	894	" Helen , you know that Leonard is in the town , though I can not receive him at the Park , since he is standing in opposition to my guests , Egerton and Leslie . "
484064	484086	484087	484087	HARLEY	503	" But that seems to me so strange . How - how could Leonard do anything that seems hostile to you ? "
484090	484117	484118	484118	HELEN	894	" Would his hostility to me lower him in your opinion ? If he know that I am his rival , does not rivalry include hate ? "
484121	484149	484150	484150	HARLEY	503	" Oh , Lord L'Estrange , how can you speak thus ; how so wrong yourself ? Hate - hate to you ! and from Leonard Fairfield ! "
484153	484172	484173	484173	HELEN	894	" You evade my question . Would his hate or hostility to me affect your sentiments towards him ? "
484178	484189	484190	484190	HARLEY	503	" I could not force myself to believe in it . "
484193	484196	484197	484197	HELEN	894	" Why ? "
484200	484210	484211	484211	HARLEY	503	" Because it would be so unworthy of him . "
484214	484292	484293	484293	HELEN	894	" Poor child ! You have the delusion of your years . You deck a cloud in the hues of the rainbow , and will not believe that its glory is borrowed from the sun of your own fancy . But here , at least , you are not deceived . Leonard obeys but my wishes , and , I believe , against his own will . He has none of man 's noblest attribute , Ambition . "
484296	484300	484301	484301	HARLEY	503	" No ambition ! "
484304	484336	484348	484348	HARLEY	503	" It is vanity that stirs the poet to toil , - if toil the wayward chase of his own chimeras can be called . Ambition is a more masculine passion . "
484351	484966	484967	484967	HELEN	894	" If I utter a word that profanes one of your delusions , you shake your head and are incredulous . Pause : listen one moment to my counsels , - perhaps the last I may ever obtrude upon you . Lift your eyes ; look around . Far as your eye can reach , nay , far beyond the line which the horizon forms in the landscape , stretch the lands of my inheritance . Yonder you see the home in which my forefathers for many generations lived with honour , and died lamented . All these , in the course of nature , might one day have been your own , had you not rejected my proposals . I offered you , it is true , not what is commonly called Love ; I offered you sincere esteem , and affections the more durable for their calm . You have not been reared by the world in the low idolatry of rank and wealth ; but even romance can not despise the power of serving others , which rank and wealth bestow . For myself , hitherto indolence , and lately disdain , rob fortune of these nobler attributes . But she who will share my fortune may dispense it so as to atone for my sins of omission . On the other side , grant that there is no bar to your preference for Leonard Fairfield , what does your choice present to you ? Those of his kindred with whom you will associate are unrefined and mean . His sole income is derived from precarious labours ; the most vulgar of all anxieties - the fear of bread itself for the morrow - must mingle with all your romance , and soon steal from love all its poetry . You think his affection will console you for every sacrifice . Folly ! the love of poets is for a mist , a moonbeam , a denizen of air , a phantom that they call an Ideal . They suppose for a moment that they have found that Ideal in Chloe or Phyllis , Helen or a milkmaid . Bah ! the first time you come to the poet with the baker 's bill , where flies the Ideal ? I knew one more brilliant than Leonard , more exquisitely gifted by nature ; that one was a woman ; she saw a man hard and cold as that stone at your feet , - a false , hollow , sordid worldling ; she made him her idol , beheld in him all that history would not recognize in a Caesar , that mythology would scarcely grant to an Apollo : to him she was the plaything of an hour ; she died , and before the year was out he had married for money ! I knew another instance , - I speak of myself . I loved before I was your age . Had an angel warned me then , I would have been incredulous as you . How that ended , no matter : but had it not been for that dream of maudlin delirium , I had lived and acted as others of my kind and my sphere , - married from reason and judgment , been now a useful and happy man . Pause , then . Will you still reject me for Leonard Fairfield ? For the last time you have the option , - me and all the substance of waking life , Leonard Fairfield and the shadows of a fleeting dream . Speak ! You hesitate . Nay , take time to decide . "
484970	485032	485033	485033	HARLEY	503	" Ah , Lord L'Estrange , you who have felt what it is to love , how can you doubt my answer ; how think that I could be so base , so ungrateful as take from yourself what you call the substance of waking life , while my heart was far away , faithful to what you call a dream ? "
485036	485045	485046	485046	HELEN	894	" But can you not dispel the dream ? "
485054	485079	485080	485080	HARLEY	503	" It was wrong to call it dream ! It is the reality of life to me . All things else are as dreams . "
485091	485149	485150	485150	HELEN	894	" Helen , you have a noble heart , and I have tempted you in vain . I regret your choice , though I will no more oppose it . I regret it , though I shall never witness your disappointment . As the wife of that man , I shall see and know you no more . "
485153	485167	485168	485168	HARLEY	503	" Oh , no ! do not say that . Why ? Wherefore ? "
485174	485270	485705	485705	Riccabocca	463	" He is the child of fraud and of shame . His father is my foe , and my hate descends to the son . He , too , the son , filches from me - But complaints are idle . When the next few days are over , think of me but as one who abandons all right over your actions , and is a stranger to your future fate . Pooh ! dry your tears : so long as you love Leonard or esteem me , rejoice that our paths do not cross . "
485700	485703	485705	485705	Riccabocca	463	" Daughter , "
485717	485768	485800	485800	Riccabocca	463	" Daughter ! Mark how they who turn towards the south can still find the sunny side of the land scape ! In all the seasons of life , how much of chill or of warmth depends on our choice of the aspect ! Sit down : let us reason . "
485794	485798	485800	485800	Riccabocca	463	" You shrink , "
485802	485826	485845	485845	Riccabocca	463	" from even the courtship , even the presence of the suitor in whom my honour binds me to recognize your future bridegroom . "
485841	485843	485845	485845	Riccabocca	463	" But "
485850	485902	485845	485845	Riccabocca	463	" this is not listening to reason . I may object to Mr. Leslie , because he has not an adequate rank or fortune to pretend to a daughter of my house ; that would be what every one would allow to be reasonable in a father ; except , indeed , "
485924	486078	485845	485845	Riccabocca	463	" except , indeed , those wise enough to recollect that admonitory saying , ' Casa il figlio quando vuoi , e la figlia quando puoi , ' - Marry your son when you will , your daughter when you can . Seriously , if I overlook those objections to Mr. Leslie , it is not natural for a young girl to enforce them . What is reason in you is quite another thing from reason in me . Mr. Leslie is young , not ill - looking , has the air of a gentleman , is passionately enamoured of you , and has proved his affection by risking his life against that villanous Peschiera , - that is , he would have risked it had Peschiera not been shipped out of the way . If , then , you will listen to reason , pray what can reason say against Mr. Leslie ? "
486079	486086	486092	486092	Riccabocca	463	" Father , I detest him ! "
486087	486090	486232	486233	the sage	3893	" Cospetto ! "
486096	486230	486232	486233	the sage	3893	" you have no reason to detest him . If you had any reason , child , I am sure that I should be the last person to dispute it . How can you know your own mind in such a matter ? It is not as if you had seen anyone else you could prefer . Not another man of your own years do you even know , - except , indeed , Leonard Fairfield , whom , though I grant he is handsomer , and with more imagination and genius than Mr. Leslie , you still must remember as the boy who worked in my garden . Ah , to be sure , there is Frank Hazeldean ; fine lad , but his affections are pre - engaged . In short , "
486237	486372	486382	486382	Violante	800	" there is no one else you can , by any possible caprice , prefer to Mr. Leslie ; and for a girl who has no one else in her head to talk of detesting a well - looking , well - dressed , clever young man , is - a nonsense - ' Chi lascia il poco per haver l'assai ne l'uno , ne l'altro avera mai ' - which may be thus paraphrased , - The young lady who refuses a mortal in the hope of obtaining an angel , loses the one , and will never fall in with the other . So now , having thus shown that the darker side of the question is contrary to reason , let us look to the brighter . In the first place - "
486373	486380	486382	486382	Violante	800	" Oh , Father , Father ! "
486386	486436	486232	486233	the sage	3893	" you to whom I once came for comfort in every childish sorrow do not talk to me with this cutting levity . See , I lay my head upon your breast , I put my arms around you ; and now , can you reason me into misery ? "
486437	486743	486382	486382	Violante	800	" Child , child , do not be so wayward . Strive , at least , against a prejudice that you can not defend . My Violante , my darling , this is no trifle . Here I must cease to be the fond , foolish father , whom you can do what you will with . Here I am Alphonso , Duke di Serrano ; for here my honour as noble and my word as man are involved . I , then , but a helpless exile , no hope of fairer prospects before me , trembling like a coward at the wiles of my unscrupulous kinsman , grasping at all chances to save you from his snares , - self offered your hand to Randal Leslie , - offered , promised , pledged it ; and now that my fortunes seem assured , my rank in all likelihood restored , my foe crushed , my fears at rest , now , does it become me to retract what I myself have urged ? It is not the noble , it is the parvenu , who has only to grow rich , in order to forget those whom in poverty he hailed as his friends . Is it for me to make the poor excuse , never heard on the lips of an Italian prince , ' that I can not command the obedience of my child ; ' subject myself to the galling answer , ' Duke of Serrano , you could once command that obedience , when , in exile , penury , and terror you offered me a bride without a dower ' ? Child , Violante , daughter of ancestors on whose honour never slander set a stain , I call on you to redeem your father 's plighted word . "
486744	486819	486825	486825	Riccabocca	463	" Father , must it be so ? Is not even the convent open to me ? Nay , look not so coldly on me . If you could but read my heart ! And oh ! I feel so assured of your own repentance hereafter , - so assured that this man is not what you believe him . I so suspect that he has been playing throughout some secret and perfidious part . "
486820	486823	486825	486825	Riccabocca	463	" Ha ! "
486827	486837	486382	486382	Violante	800	" Harley has perhaps infected you with that notion . "
486838	486868	486922	486922	Riccabocca	463	" No , no ! But is not Harley , is not Lord L'Estrange one whose opinion you have cause to esteem ? And if he distrusts Mr. Leslie - "
486869	486920	486922	486922	Riccabocca	463	" Let him make good his distrust by such proof as will absolve my word , and I shall share your own joy . I have told him this . I have invited him to make good his suspicions , he puts me off . He can not do so , "
486929	487000	487058	487058	she	800	" Randal has already so well explained all that Harley deemed equivocal . Violante , my name and my honour rest in your hands . Cast them away if you will ; I can not constrain you , and I can not stoop to implore . Noblesse oblige ! With your birth you took its duties . Let them decide between your vain caprice and your father 's solemn remonstrance . "
487061	487116	487211	487214	the ex - minister	11125	" I never rebelled , Father ; I did but entreat . What you say is my law now , as it has ever been ; and come what may , never shall you hear complaint or murmur from me . Poor Father , you will suffer more than I shall . Kiss me ! "
487204	487209	487211	487214	the ex - minister	11125	" My dear Harley , "
487221	487262	487270	487271	his mother	1556	" you must not pass us by , now that you have a moment of leisure from the cares of the election . And , Harley , though we are under the same roof , I see you so little . "
487281	487295	487313	487313	Harley	503	" You leaning on Audley 's arm ! Have you kept your promise ? "
487306	487311	487313	487313	Harley	503	" It is true , "
487315	487352	487362	487363	Lady Lansmere	822	" but you , who know that , once engaged in public affairs , one has no heart left for the ties of private life , will excuse me . And this election is so important ! "
487353	487360	487362	487363	Lady Lansmere	822	" And you , Mr. Egerton , "
487365	487385	487397	487398	Lord L'Estrange	502	" whom the election most concerns , seem privileged to be the only one who appears indifferent to success . "
487386	487395	487422	487422	Harley	503	" Ay ; but you are not indifferent ? "
487402	487421	487422	487422	Harley	503	" No . How can I be so , when my whole future career may depend on it ? "
487427	487510	487511	487511	EGERTON	500	" There is one voter you ought at least to call upon and thank . He can not be made to comprehend that , for the sake of any relation , even for the sake of his own son , he is to vote against the Blues , - against you ; I mean , of course , Nora 's father , John Avenel . His vote and his son - in - law 's gained your majority at your first election . "
487514	487524	487525	487525	HARLEY	503	" Call on John Avenel ! Have you called ? "
487529	487615	487624	487624	He	13323	" Yes . Poor old man , his mind has been affected ever since Nora 's death . But your name as the candidate for the borough at that time , - the successful candidate for whose triumph the joy - bells chimed with her funeral knell , - your name brings up her memory ; and he talks in a breath of her and of you . Come , let us walk together to his house ; it is close by the Park Lodge . "
487641	487655	487624	487624	He	13323	" Harley , at last , then , you have forgotten the Past . "
487656	487781	487782	487782	EGERTON	500	" No ; but the Present is more imperious . All my efforts are needed to requite your friendship . You stand against her brother , - yet her father votes for you . And her mother says to her son , ' Let the old man alone . Conscience is all that is well alive in him ; and he thinks if he were to vote against the Blues , he would sin against honour . ' ' An electioneering prejudice , ' some sceptics would say . But you must be touched by this trait of human nature , - in her father , too , - you , Audley Egerton , who are the soul of honour . What ails you ? "
487785	487846	487847	487847	HARLEY	503	" Nothing ; a spasm at the heart ; my old complaint . Well , I will call on the poor man later , but not now , - not with you . Nay , nay , I will not , - I can not . Harley , just as you joined us , I was talking to your mother . "
487850	487857	487858	487858	EGERTON	500	" Ay , and what of ? "
487861	487905	487906	487906	HARLEY	503	" Yourself . I saw you from my windows walking with your betrothed . Afterwards I observed her coming home alone ; and by the glimpse I caught of her gentle countenance , it seemed sad . Harley , do you deceive us ? "
487909	487916	487917	487917	EGERTON	500	" Deceive ! I ! How ? "
487920	487949	487950	487950	HARLEY	503	" DO you really feel that your intended marriage will bestow on you the happiness , which is my prayer , as it must be your mother 's ? "
487953	487963	487964	487964	EGERTON	500	" Happiness , I hoped so . But perhaps - "
487967	487971	487972	487972	HARLEY	503	" Perhaps what ? "
487975	488104	488105	488105	EGERTON	500	" Perhaps the marriage may not take place . Perhaps I have a rival ; not an open one , - a secret , stealthy wooer , in one , too , whom I have loved , served , trusted . Question me not now . Such instances of treachery make one learn more how to prize a friendship honest , devoted , faithful as your own , Audley Egerton . But here comes your protege , released awhile from his canvass , and your confidential adviser , Baron Levy . He accompanied Randal through the town to - day . So anxious is he to see that that young man does not play false , and regard his own interest before yours ! Would that surprise you ? "
488108	488135	488136	488136	HARLEY	503	" You are too severe upon Randal Leslie . He is ambitious , worldly , has no surplus of affection at the command of his heart - "
488139	488147	488148	488148	EGERTON	500	" Is it Randal Leslie you describe ? "
488155	488269	488270	488270	Audley	500	" Yes , you see I do not flatter . But he is born and reared a gentleman ; as such he would scarcely do anything mean . And , after all , it is with me that he must rise or fall . His very intellect must tell him that . But again I ask , do not strive to prepossess me against him . I am a man who could have loved a son . I have none . Randal , such as he is , is a sort of son . He carries on my projects and my interest in the world of men beyond the goal of the tomb . "
488276	488287	488148	488148	EGERTON	500	" Well , Leslie , what report of the canvass ? "
488288	488313	488328	488328	Harley	503	" Levy has the book , sir . I think we have gained ten fresh votes for you , and perhaps seven for me . "
488314	488326	488403	488403	he	503	" Let me rid you of your book , Baron Levy , "
488430	488558	488604	488604	Audley	1415	" Ten thousand pardons to all three ! But I can not allow this waste of time , Mr. Leslie . You have yet an hour before it grows dark . There are three out - voters six miles off , influential farmers , whom you must canvass in person with my father 's steward . Hasten to the stables ; choose your own horse . To saddle , to saddle ! Baron Levy , go and order my Lord 's steward , Mr. Smart , to join Mr. Leslie at the stables ; then come back to me , - quick . What ! loitering still , Mr. Leslie ! You will make me throw up your whole cause in disgust at your indolence and apathy . "
488597	488602	488604	488604	Audley	1415	" Do you note , "
488608	488687	488688	488689	LADY LANSMERE	822	" how Harley sprang forward when the fair Italian came in sight ? Trust me , I was right . I know little of the young lady , but I have conversed with her . I have gazed on the changes in her face . If Harley ever love again , and if ever love influence and exalt his mind , wish with me that his choice may yet fall where I believe that his heart inclines it . "
488692	488733	488862	488862	Audley	1415	" Ah , that it were so ! Helen , I own , is charming ; but - but - Violante is equal in birth ! Are you not aware that she is engaged to your young friend Mr. Leslie ? "
488737	488860	488862	488862	Audley	1415	" Randal told me so ; but I can not believe it . In fact , I have taken occasion to sound that fair creature 's inclinations , and if I know aught of women , her heart is not with Randal . I can not believe her to be one whose affections are so weak as to be easily constrained ; nor can I suppose that her father could desire to enforce a marriage that is almost a misalliance . Randal must deceive himself ; and from something Harley just let fall , in our painful but brief conversation , I suspect that his engagement with Miss Digby is broken off . He promises to tell me more later . Yes , "
488866	488951	488983	488984	the sage	3893	" observe Violante 's countenance , with its ever - varying play ; listen to her voice , to which feeling seems to give the expressive music , and tell me whether you are not sometimes reminded of - of - In one word , there is one who , even without rank or fortune , would be worthy to replace the image of Leonora , and be to Harley - what Leonora could not ; for sure I am that Violante loves him . "
488994	489077	489144	489144	he	503	" She has consented to sacrifice herself to my sense of honour . But , O Harley ! if she be unhappy , it will break my heart . Either you must give me sufficient proof of Randal 's unworthiness , to absolve me from my promise , or I must again entreat , you to try and conciliate the poor child in his favour . All you say has weight with her ; she respects you as - a second father . "
489155	489179	489193	489194	the man	14948	" You have been quick ; I did not expect you so soon . You discovered the trace ? You gave my letter - "
489180	489191	489207	489207	Harley	503	" And have brought back the answer , my Lord , "
489228	489248	489263	489264	the duke	15449	" Good . Say not whence you came . Do not wait here ; return at once to London . "
489268	489277	489263	489264	the duke	15449	" A despatch from Vienna ? My recall ! "
489278	489363	489378	489378	he	13336	" From Vienna , my dear friend ! Not possible yet . I can not calculate on hearing from the prince till a day or two before the close of this election . But you wish me to speak to Violante . Join my mother yonder . What can she be saying to Mr. Egerton ? I will address a few words apart to your fair daughter , that may at least prove the interest in her fate taken by - her second father . "
489364	489369	489390	489390	Harley	503	" Kindest of friends ! "
489394	489438	489439	489439	VIOLANTE	800	" Do not go till you have thanked me ; for you are not the noble Violante for whom I take you , unless you acknowledge gratitude to any one who delivers you from the presence of an admirer in Mr. Randal Leslie . "
489442	489454	489455	489455	HARLEY	503	" Ought I to hear this of one whom - whom - "
489458	489611	489622	489622	He	503	" One whom your father obstinately persists in obtruding on your repugnance ? Yet , O dear child , you who , when almost an infant , ere yet you knew what snares and pitfalls , for all who trust to another , lie under the sward at our feet , even when decked the fairest with the flowers of spring ; you who put your small hands around my neck , and murmured in your musical voice , ' Save us , - save my father , ' - you at least I will not forsake , in a peril worse than that which menaced you then , - a peril which affrights you more than that which threatened you in the snares of Peschiera . Randal Leslie may thrive in his meaner objects of ambition ; those I fling to him in scorn : but you ! the presuming varlet ! "
489628	489729	490082	490082	he	570	" Trust to me , and fear not . I will rescue this hand from the profanation of Randal Leslie 's touch ; and then farewell , for life , to every soft emotion . Before me expands the welcome solitude . The innocent saved , the honest righted , the perfidious stricken by a just retribution , - and then - what then ? Why , at least I shall have studied Machiavelli with more effect than your wise father ; and I shall lay him aside , needing no philosophy to teach me never again to be deceived . "
490076	490080	490106	490107	the baron	17518	" Come in , "
490090	490104	490106	490107	the baron	17518	" I am come to talk over matters with you , mon cher , "
490115	490130	490150	490150	his	570	" And , first , I wish you joy of your prospects of success . "
490156	490172	490150	490150	his	570	" You think with me , that the chance of my success - is good ? "
490173	490243	490150	490150	his	570	" Chance ! Why , it is a rubber of whist , in which your partner gives you all the winnings , and in which the adversary is almost sure to revoke . Either Avenel or his nephew , it is true , must come in ; but not both . Two parvenus aspiring to make a family seat of an earl 's borough ! Bah ! too absurd ! "
490244	490281	490150	490150	his	570	" I hear from Riccabocca or rather the Duke di Serrano that this same young Fairfield is greatly indebted to the kindness of Lord L'Estrange . Very odd that he should stand against the Lansmere interest . "
490282	490315	490150	490150	his	570	" Ambition , mon cher . You yourself are under some obligations to Mr. Egerton . Yet , in reality , he has more to apprehend from you than from Mr. Fairfield . "
490316	490444	490150	490150	his	570	" I disown obligations to Mr. Egerton . And if the electors prefer me to him whom , by - the - by , they once burned in effigy , it is no fault of mine : the fault , if any , will rest with his own dearest friend , L'Estrange . I do not understand how a man of such clear sense as L'Estrange undoubtedly possesses , should be risking Egerton 's election in his zeal for mine . Nor do his formal courtesies to myself deceive me . He has even implied that he suspects me of connivance with Peschiera 's schemes on Violante . But those suspicions he can not support . For of course , Levy , you would not betray me - "
490445	490457	490469	490469	Randal	570	" I ! What possible interest could I serve in that ? "
490458	490467	490469	490469	Randal	570	" None that I can discover , certainly , "
490476	490535	490549	490550	the baron	17518	" And when I get into parliament , aided by the social position which my marriage will give me , I shall have so many ways to serve you . No , it is certainly your interest not to betray me ; and I shall count on you as a witness , if a witness can be required . "
490536	490547	490549	490550	the baron	17518	" Count on me , certainly , my dear fellow , "
490552	490625	490641	490641	Randal	570	" And I suppose there will be no witness the other way . Done for eternally is my poor dear friend Peschiera , whose cigars , by - the - by , were matchless ; - I wonder if there will be any for sale . And if he were not so done for , it is not you , it is L'Estrange , that he would be tempted to do for ! "
490626	490639	490641	490641	Randal	570	" We may blot Peschiera out of the map of the future , "
490643	490666	490673	490674	the baron	17518	" Men from whom henceforth we have nothing to hope or to fear are to us as the races before the deluge . "
490667	490671	490673	490674	the baron	17518	" Fine remark , "
490678	490719	490726	490726	Randal	570	" Peschiera , though not without brains , was a complete failure . And when the failure of one I have tried to serve is complete , the rule I have adopted through life is to give him up altogether . "
490720	490724	490734	490735	the baron	17518	" Of course , "
490728	490732	490734	490735	the baron	17518	" Of course , "
490737	490801	490673	490674	the baron	17518	" On the other hand , you know that I like pushing forward young men of mark and promise . You really are amazingly clever ; but how comes it you do n't speak better ? Do you know , I doubt whether you will do in the House of Commons all that I expected from your address and readiness in private life . "
490802	490883	490734	490735	the baron	17518	" Because I can not talk trash vulgar enough for a mob ? Pooh ! I shall succeed wherever knowledge is really power . Besides , you must allow for my infernal position . You know , after all , that Avenel , if he can only return himself or his nephew , still holds in his hands the choice of the candidate upon our side . I can not attack him ; I can not attack his insolent nephew - "
490884	491186	491204	491204	Randal	570	" Insolent ! - not that , but bitterly eloquent . He hits you hard . You are no match for him , Randal , before a popular audience ; though , en petit comite , the devil himself were hardly a match for you . But now to a somewhat more serious point . Your election you will win , your bride is promised to you ; but the old Leslie lands , in the present possession of Squire Thornhill , you have not gained , - and your chance of gaining them is in great jeopardy . I did not like to tell you this morning , - it would have spoiled your temper for canvassing ; but I have received a letter from Thornhill himself . He has had an offer for the property , which is only L1000 short of what he asks . A city alderman , called Jobson , is the bidder ; a man , it seems , of large means and few words . The alderman has fixed the date on which he must have a definite answer ; and that date falls on the - th , two days after that fixed for the poll at Lansmere . The brute declares he will close with another investment , if Thornhill does not then come in to his terms . Now , as Thornhill will accept these terms unless I can positively promise him better , and as those funds on which you calculated had the marriage of Peschiera with Violante , and Frank Hazeldean with Madame di Negra , taken place fail you , I see no hope for your being in time with the money , - and the old lands of the Leslies must yield their rents to a Jobson . "
491187	491202	491204	491204	Randal	570	" I care for nothing on earth like those old lands of my forefathers , "
491210	491247	490734	490735	the baron	17518	" I reverence so little amongst the living , and I do reverence the dead . And my marriage will take place so soon ; and the dower would so amply cover the paltry advance required . "
491248	491279	491285	491285	Randal	570	" Yes ; but the mere prospect of a marriage to the daughter of a man whose lands are still sequestered would be no security to a money - lender . "
491280	491283	491285	491285	Randal	570	" Surely , "
491287	491326	491336	491337	the baron	17518	" you , who once offered to assist me when my fortunes were more precarious , might now accommodate me with this loan , as a friend , and keep the title - deeds of the estate as - "
491327	491334	491336	491337	the baron	17518	" As a money - lender , "
491342	491447	491455	491455	Randal	570	" No , mon cher , I will still lend you half the sum required in advance , but the other half is more than I can afford as friend , or hazard as money - lender ; and it would damage my character , - be out of all rule , - if , the estates falling by your default of payment into my own hands , I should appear to be the real purchaser of the property of my own distressed client . But , now I think of it , did not Squire Hazeldean promise you his assistance in this matter ? "
491448	491453	491455	491455	Randal	570	" He did so , "
491457	491495	491336	491337	the baron	17518	" as soon as the marriage between Frank and Madame di Negra was off his mind . I meant to cross over to Hazeldean immediately after the election . How can I leave the place till then ? "
491496	491514	491455	491455	Randal	570	" If you do , your election is lost . But why not write to the squire ? "
491515	491575	491663	491665	MR . HAZELDEAN	449	" It is against my maxim to write where I can speak . However , there is no option ; I will write at once . Meanwhile , communicate with Thornhill ; keep up his hopes ; and be sure , at least , that he does not close with this greedy alderman before the day fixed for decision . "
491576	491631	492952	492957	the old broken - clown charger	13404	" I have done all that already , and my letter is gone . Now , do your part : and if you write as cleverly as you talk , you would coax the money out from a stonier heart than poor Mr. Hazeldean 's . I leave you now ; good - night . "
492945	492949	493033	493033	Dick	643	" Blue forever ! "
493036	493044	493052	493052	Dick	643	" very happy to oblige the gentleman . "
493045	493050	493052	493052	Dick	643	" Your own son ! "
493054	493062	493088	493090	the old man	5507	" and here is your own grandson . "
493063	493080	493115	493115	he	5507	" Very happy to serve you both ; but you see you are the wrong colour . "
493108	493114	493115	493115	he	5507	" Be thee my grandson ? "
493118	493154	493175	493175	she	1782	" Wife , wife , Nora had no son , had she ? My memory begins to fail me , sir ; pray excuse it ; but you have a look about the eyes that - "
493168	493174	493175	493175	she	1782	" Do n't come again , "
493186	493195	493276	493276	she	1782	" He 'll not sleep all night now . "
493216	493275	493276	493276	she	1782	" I am glad to see you well and thriving , and to hear that you have been of great service to my son Richard , who is a credit and an honour to the family , though poor John can not vote for him or for you against his conscience ; and he should not be asked , "
493282	493316	493365	493365	she	1782	" and it is a sin to ask it , and he so old , and no one to defend him but me . But defend him I will while I have life ! "
493372	493416	493424	493424	Dick	643	" I 'm not so unkind as I seem , boy ; but it is better for you , and for all , that you should not come to this house again , - better that you had not come into the town . "
493417	493422	493431	493431	his	450	" Fie , Mother ! "
493440	493454	493424	493424	Dick	643	" You should be prouder of your grandson than you are of me . "
493455	493466	493431	493431	his	450	" Prouder of him who may shame us all yet ? "
493467	493473	493494	493494	Dick	643	" What do you mean ? "
493483	493492	493576	493576	Leonard	450	" Never mind her , poor old soul , "
493575	493575	493705	493705	Harley	503	"
493719	493854	494782	494782	He	8282	" that it would require a long personal interview to discuss the subject referred to , and that such an interview , in the thick of the contest between himself and a candidate opposed to the Lansmere party , would be sure to get wind , be ascribed to political intrigues , be impossible otherwise to explain , and embarrass all the interests confided to their respective charge . That for the rest , he had not been unmindful of Leonard 's anxiety , which must now mainly be to see justice done to the dead parent , and learn the name , station , and character of the parent yet surviving . And in this Harley trusted to assist him as soon as the close of the poll would present a suitable occasion . "
494819	494847	495039	495039	Riccabocca	463	" It was the hope to regain the privilege bestowed on our childhood , that strengthened me to seek distinction when you and happiness forsook my youth . "
495043	495050	495293	495293	Dick	643	" the southern side of things , "
495286	495291	495293	495293	Dick	643	" If , therefore , "
495295	495358	495364	495364	Leonard	450	" two of us can not come in , and one must retire , leave it to me to arrange with the Committee that you shall be the one to persist . Oh , never fear but what all scruples of honour shall be satisfied . I would not for the sake of the Avenels have a word said against their representative . "
495359	495362	495364	495364	Leonard	450	" But , "
495366	495397	495293	495293	Dick	643	" if I grant this , I fear that you have some intention of suffering the votes that your resignation would release to favour Leslie at the expense of Egerton . "
495398	495407	495364	495364	Leonard	450	" What the deuce is Egerton to you ? "
495408	495421	495293	495293	Dick	643	" Nothing , except through my gratitude to his friend Lord L'Estrange . "
495422	495480	495364	495364	Leonard	450	" Pooh ! I will tell you a secret . Levy informs me privately that L'Estrange will be well satisfied if the choice of Lansmere fall upon Leslie instead of Egerton ; and I think I convinced my Lord - for I saw him in London - that Egerton would have no chance , though Leslie might . "
495481	495535	495293	495293	Dick	643	" I must think that Lord L'Estrange would resist to the utmost any attempt to prefer Leslie - whom he despises - to Egerton , whom he honours . And , so thinking , I too would resist it , as you may judge by the speeches which have so provoked your displeasure . "
495536	495580	495364	495364	Leonard	450	" Let us cut short a yarn of talk which , when it comes to likings and dislikings , might last to almighty crack : I 'll ask you to do nothing that Lord L'Estrange does not sanction . Will that satisfy you ? "
495581	495592	495918	495918	he	1175	" Certainly , provided I am assured of the sanction . "
495911	495916	495918	495918	he	1175	" From the squire ? "
495920	495942	495948	495948	Randal	570	" Ah , he has written at last ! What made him delay so long ? Hope he relieves your mind ? "
495943	495946	495948	495948	Randal	570	" Yes , "
495966	496048	495918	495918	he	1175	" yes , he does not write from Hazeldean , - not there when my letter arrived , in London , could not rest at the Hall , - the place reminded him too much of Frank ; - went again to town , on the receipt of my first letter concerning the rupture of the marriage , to see after his son , and take up some money to pay off his post - obit . Read what he says : -

Why should you be indebted at all to that Baron Levy ? Do n't have dealings with money- lenders . Your grandmother was a Hazeldean ; and from a Hazeldean you shall have the whole sum required in advance for those Rood lands , - good light soil some of them . As to repayment , we 'll talk of that later . If Frank and I come together again , as we did of old , why , my estates will be his some day , and he 'll not grudge the mortgage , so fond as he always was of you ; and if we do n't come together , what do I care for hundreds or thousands , either more or less ? So I shall be down at Lansmere the day after to - morrow , just in the thick of your polling . Beat the manufacturer , my boy , and stick up for the land . Tell Levy to have all ready . I shall bring the money down in good bank - notes , and a brace of pistols in my coat pocket to take care of them in ease robbers get scent of the notes and attack me on the road , as they did my grandfather sixty years ago , come next Michaelmas . A Lansmere election puts one in mind of pistols . I once fought a duel with an officer in his Majesty 's service , R.N. , and had a ball lodged in my right shoulder , on account of an election at Lansmere ; but I have forgiven Audley his share in that transaction . Remember me to him kindly . Do n't get into a duel yourself ; but I suppose manufacturers do n't fight , - not that I blame them for that - far from it . ' "
496435	496438	496440	496440	Levy	1175	" Well , "
496446	496465	496505	496505	Levy	1175	" you must have written as cleverly as you talk , or the squire is a booby indeed . "
496514	496534	496440	496440	Levy	1175	" Has not Mr. Leslie received from the squire an answer to that letter of which you informed me ? "
496535	496550	496505	496505	Levy	1175	" Yes , my Lord , the squire will be here to - morrow . "
496551	496568	496440	496440	Levy	1175	" To - morrow ? Thank you for apprising me ; his rooms shall be prepared . "
496569	496587	496505	496505	Levy	1175	" I suppose he will only stay to see Leslie and myself , and pay the money . "
496588	496601	496440	496440	Levy	1175	" Aha ! Pay the money . Is it so , then ? "
496602	496677	496505	496505	Levy	1175	" Twice the sum , and , it seems , as a gift , which Leslie only asked as a loan . Really , my Lord , Mr. Leslie is a very clever man ; and though I am at your commands , I should not like to injure him . With such matrimonial prospects , he could be a very powerful enemy ; and if he succeed in parliament , still more so . "
496678	496694	496835	496835	he	643	" Baron , these gentlemen are waiting for you . I will follow by myself . "

"
497389	497392	497386	497387	the Yellows	1409	" Shame ! "
497393	497639	497386	497387	the Yellows	1409	" As for the other candidate on the same side , he the maltster had nothing to say against him . - He was , no doubt , seduced into presumption by his uncle and his own inexperience . It was said that that candidate , Mr. Fairfield , was an author and a poet ; if so , he was unknown to fame , for no bookseller in the town had ever even heard of Mr. Fairfield 's works . Then it was replied Mr. Fairfield had written under another name . What would that prove ? Either that he was ashamed of his name , or that the works did him no credit . For his part , he the maltster was an Englishman ; he did not like anonymous scribblers ; there was something not right in whatever was concealed . A man should never be afraid to put his name to what he wrote . But grant that Mr. Fairfield was a great author and a great poet , what the borough of Lansinere wanted was , not a member who would pass his time in writing sonnets to Peggy or Moggy , but a practical man of business , - a statesman , - such a man as Mr. Audley Egerton , a gentleman of ancient birth , high standing , and princely fortune . The member for such a place as Lansmere should have a proper degree of wealth . "

"
501188	501325	501510	501510	he	570	" Would that the Right Honourable Gentleman had himself made that generous and affecting allusion to the services which he had deigned to remember , for , in that case , he Leonard was confident that Mr. Avenel would have lost all the bitterness which political contest was apt to engender in proportion to the earnestness with which political opinions were entertained . Happy it was when some such milder sentiment as that which Mr. Egerton had instructed Mr. Leslie to convey , preceded the sharp encounter , and reminded antagonists , as Mr. Leslie had so emphatically done , that every shield had two sides , and that it was possible to maintain the one side to be golden , without denying the truth of the champion who asserted the other side to be silver . "

501577	501655	501741	501741	Randal	570	" I am new to party warfare ; yet if I were not opposing Mr. Leslie as a candidate for your suffrages , if I were but an elector , - belonging , as I do , to the people by my condition and my labours , - I should feel that he is one of those politicians in whom the welfare , the honour , the moral elevation of the people , find no fitting representative . "

503000	503261	503280	503281	the English	1134	" My Right Honourable friend chides me for the years that I have wasted . True ; my years have been wasted , - no matter how nor wherefore ! But his ! how have they been spent ? In such devotion to the public that those who know him not as I do , have said that he had not one feeling left to spare to the obscurer duties and more limited affections , by which men of ordinary talents and humble minds rivet the links of that social order which it is the august destiny of statesmen - like him who now sits beside me - to cherish and defend . But , for my part , I think that there is no being so dangerous as the solemn hypocrite , who , because he drills his cold nature into serving mechanically some conventional abstraction , - whether he calls it ' the Constitution ' or ' the Public , ' - holds himself dispensed from whatever , in the warm blood of private life , wins attachment to goodness , and confidence to truth . Let others , then , praise my Right Honourable friend as the incorruptible politician . Pardon me if I draw his likeness as the loyal sincere man , who might say with the honest priest ' that he could not tell a lie to gain heaven by it ! ' - and with so fine a sense of honour , that he would hold it a lie merely to conceal the truth . "

503403	503664	503399	503401	the young man	5338	" Mr. Fairfield cheers this description of integrity , and its application ; let him imitate the model set before him , and he may live to hear praise as genuine as mine from some friend who has tested his worth as I have tested Mr. Egerton 's . Mr. Fairfield is a poet : his claim to that title was disputed by one of the speakers who preceded me ! - unjustly disputed ! Mr. Fairfield is every inch a poet . But , it has been asked , ' Are poets fit for the business of senates ? Will they not be writing sonnets to Peggy and Moggy , when you want them to concentrate their divine imagination on the details of a beer bill ? ' Do not let Mr. Fairfield 's friends be alarmed . At the risk of injury to the two candidates whose cause I espouse , truth compels me to say , that poets , when they stoop to action , are not less prosaic than the dullest amongst us ; they are swayed by the same selfish interests , they are moved by the same petty passions . It is a mistake to suppose that any detail in common life , whether in public or private , can be too mean to seduce the exquisite pliances of their fancy . Nay , in public life , we may trust them better than other men ; for vanity is a kind of second conscience , and , as a poet has himself said , -

Lord L'Estrange has just implied , in public , that I - I - who owe him so much , who have honoured him so truly , that even the just resentment I now feel half seems to me the ingratitude with which he charges me , has implied that - ah ! Miss Digby , I can scarcely command words to say what it so humiliates me to have heard . But you know how false is all accusation that either of us could deceive our common benefactor . Suffer me to repeat to your guardian what I presumed to say to you when we last met , what you answered , and state how I left your presence . "
504705	504729	504524	504524	he	450	" Oh , Leonard ! yes ; clear yourself in his eyes . Go ! Unjust that he is , ungenerous Lord L'Estrange ! "
504730	504734	504524	504524	he	450	" Helen Digby ! "
504743	504751	504842	504842	he	446	" Of whom do you speak thus ? "
504796	504815	504830	504830	he	446	" Is it you who thus speak of Lord L'Estrange ? You , Helen Digby , - you ! "
504824	504829	504842	504842	he	446	" Softly , children , "
504849	504864	504907	504907	Helen	894	" What is this ? Come hither to me , Leonard , and explain . "
504912	505190	505253	505253	Harley	503	" Enough ! Do not yet seek Lord L'Estrange yourself ; I am going to see him , - I am here at his request . His summons , indeed , was for to - morrow ; but the squire having written me a hurried line , requesting me to meet him at Lansmere tomorrow and proceed with him afterwards in search of poor Frank , I thought I might have little time for communications with Lord L'Estrange , unless I forestalled his invitation and came to - day . Well that I did so ! I only arrived an hour since , found he was gone to the town - hall , and joined the young ladies in the Park . Miss Digby , thinking it natural that I might wish to say something in private to my old young friend Violante , walked a few paces in advance . Thus , fortunately , I chanced to be here , to receive your account , and I trust to remove misunderstanding . Lord L'Estrange must now be returned . I will go back to the house . You , meanwhile , return to the town , I beseech you . I will come to you afterwards at your inn . Your very appearance in these grounds , even the brief words that have passed between Helen and you , might only widen the breach between yourself and your benefactor . I can not bear to anticipate this . Go back , I entreat you . I will explain all , and Lord L'Estrange shall right you ! That is , - that must be his intention ! "
505191	505207	505215	505217	the poor parson	5143	" IS - must be his intention - when he has just so wronged me ! "
505208	505213	505360	505360	he	446	" Yes , yes , "
505351	505358	505360	505360	he	446	" As to reparation or excuse , "
505364	505693	505863	505863	her	894	" it must rest with Lord L'Estrange . I ask it not . Tell him only this , - that if the instant I heard that she whom I loved and held sacred for so many years was affianced to him , I resigned even the very wish to call her mine - if that were desertion of man 's duties , I am guilty . If to have prayed night and day that she who would have blessed my lonely and toilsome life may give some charm to his , not bestowed by his wealth and his greatness - if that were ingratitude , I am ungrateful ; let him still condemn me . I pass out of his sphere , - a thing that has crossed it a moment , and is gone . But Helen he must not blame , suspect ; even by a thought . One word more . In this election , this strife for objects wholly foreign to all my habits , unsuited to my poverty , at war with aspirations so long devoted to fairer goals , though by obscurer paths , I obeyed but his will or whim , - at a moment too when my whole soul sickened for repose and solitude . I had forced myself at last to take interest in what I had before loathed . But in every hope for the future , every stimulant to ambition , Lord L'Estrange 's esteem still stood before me . Now , what do I here longer ? All of his conduct , save his contempt for myself , is an enigma . And sinless he repeat a wish , which I would fain still regard as a law , I retire from the contest he has embittered ; I renounce the ambition he has poisoned ; and , mindful of those humble duties which he implies that I disdain , I return to my own home .

506219	506254	506274	506275	the parson	1499	" You will see Lord L'Estrange . Be sure that you convince him of Leonard 's honour . A doubt of treachery so grieves his noble heart that perhaps it may disturb his judgment . "
506255	506272	506281	506281	Violante	800	" You seem to think very highly of the heart of this Lord L'Estrange , child ! "
506294	506408	506274	506275	the parson	1499	" Some words which he - that is , Lord L'Estrange - said to me very lately , make me so glad that you are here , - that you will see him ; for I know how good you are , and how wise , dear , dear Mr. Dale ! He spoke as one who had received some grievous wrong , which had abruptly soured all his views of life . He spoke of retirement , solitude , - he on whom his country has so many claims . I know not what he can mean , unless it be that his - his marriage with Helen Digby is broken off . "
506409	506417	506443	506444	The parson	1499	" Broken off ! Is that so ? "
506418	506442	506479	506479	himself	446	" I have it from herself . You may well be astonished that she could even think of another after having known him ! "
506494	506584	506597	506597	she	800	" I think it quite natural that Helen Digby should prefer Leonard Fairfield . A good girl , not misled by vanity and ambition , - temptations of which it behoves us all to beware ; nor least , perhaps , young ladies suddenly brought in contact with wealth and rank . As to this nobleman 's merits , I know not yet whether to allow or to deny them ; I reserve my judgment till after our interview . This is all you have to say to me ? "
506590	506596	506597	506597	she	800	" I can not think , "
506604	506672	506732	506733	the parson	1499	" I can not think that the change that has occurred in him , - for changed he is , - that his obscure hints as to injury received , and justice to be done , are caused merely by his disappointment with regard to Helen . But you can learn that ; learn if he be so very much disappointed . Nay , I think not ! "
506722	506730	506732	506733	the parson	1499	" I do n't half like this , "
506735	506744	506798	506798	he	1499	" I shall give Dr. Riccabocca a caution . "
506784	506796	506798	506798	he	1499	" So , so , by this time to - morrow , "
506800	506920	507044	507048	The groom of the chambers	11144	" Mr. Egerton will be tricked out of his election by Mr. Randal Leslie ! good ! By this time to - morrow his ambition will be blasted by the treachery of his friends ! good ! By this time to - morrow the bailiffs will seize his person , - ruined , beggared , pauper , and captive , - all because he has trusted and been deceived ! good ! And if he blame you , prudent Baron Levy , if he accuse smooth Mr. Randal Leslie , forget not to say , ' We were both but the blind agents of your friend Harley L'Estrange . Ask him why you are so miserable a dupe . ' "
506921	506935	506798	506798	he	1499	" And might I now ask your Lordship for one word of explanation ? "
506936	506972	506992	506992	He	17518	" No , sir ! - it is enough that I have spared you . But you were never my friend ; I have no revenge against a man whose hand I never even touched . "
506999	507024	506992	506992	He	17518	" And though Mr. Leslie is to be member for Lansmere , - thanks to you , - you still desire that I should - "
507025	507043	506992	506992	He	17518	" Do exactly as I have said . My plans now never vary a hair 's breadth . "
507051	507068	506992	506992	He	17518	" My Lord , the Reverend Mr. Dale wishes to know if you can receive him . "
507069	507136	507193	507201	the inflexible Hundred and Fifty " Waiters upon Providence	25788	" Mr. Dale ! he should have come to - morrow . Say that I did not expect him to - day ; that I am unfortunately engaged till dinner , which will be earlier than usual . Show him into his room ; he will have but little time to change his dress . By the way , Mr. Egerton dines in his own apartment . "
507198	507202	507318	507319	The squire	1498	" Waiters upon Providence "
507313	507317	507454	507454	his	570	" all right ! "
507458	507566	507592	507592	Randal	570	" Leslie , your election is in some jeopardy . I find , from the conversation of those near me at dinner , that Egerton has made such way amongst the Blues by his speech , and they are so afraid of losing a man who does them so much credit , that the Committee men not only talk of withholding from you their second votes and of plumping Egerton , but of subscribing privately amongst themselves to win over that coy body of a Hundred and Fifty , upon whom I know that Avenel counts in whatever votes he may be able to transfer to you . "
507567	507590	507592	507592	Randal	570	" It would be very unhandsome in the Committee , which pretends to act for both of us , to plump Egerton , "
507598	507644	507653	507653	Levy	1175	" but I do n't think they can get those Hundred and Fifty without the most open and exortant bribery , - an expense which Egerton will not pay , and which it would be very discreditable to Lord L'Estrange or his father to countenance . "
507645	507651	507741	507742	the baron	17518	" I told them flatly , "
507655	507739	507741	507742	the baron	17518	" that , as Mr. Egerton 's agent , I would allow no proceedings that might vitiate the election , but that I would undertake the management of these men myself ; and I am going into the town in order to do so . I have also persuaded the leading Committee men to reconsider their determination to plump Egerton ; they have decided to do as L'Estrange directs , and I know what he will say . You may rely on me , "
507757	507788	507592	507592	Randal	570	" to obtain for you the preference over Audley , if it be in my power to do so . Meanwhile , you should really see Avenel this very night . "
507789	507870	507741	507742	the baron	17518	" I have an appointment with him at ten o'clock ; and judging by his speech against Egerton , I can not doubt on his aid to me , if convinced by his poll - books that he is not able to return both himself and his impertinent nephew . My speech , however sarcastically treated by Mr. Fairfield , must at least have disposed the Yellow party to vote rather for me than for a determined opponent like Egerton . "
507871	508070	508073	508073	his	570	" I hope so ; for your speech and Fairfield 's answer have damaged you terribly with the Blues . However , your main hope rests on my power to keep those Hundred and Fifty rascals from splitting their votes on Egerton , and to induce them , by all means short of bringing myself before a Committee of the House of Commons for positive bribery , - which would hurt most seriously my present social position , - to give one vote to you . I shall tell them , as I have told the Committee , that Egerton is safe , and will pay nothing ; but that you want the votes , and that I - in short , if they can be bought upon tick , I will buy them . Avenel , however , can serve you best here ; for as they are all Yellows at heart , they make no scruple of hinting that they want twice as much for voting Blue as they will take for voting Yellow . And Avenel being a townsman , and knowing their ways , could contrive to gain them , and yet not bribe . "
508078	508082	508083	508083	LEVY	1175	" Not bribe ! "
508086	508098	508142	508142	Levy	1175	" Pooh ! Not bribe so as to be found out . "
508137	508140	508142	508142	Levy	1175	" Well , "
508150	508178	508200	508201	the statesman	3214	" I must go to Egerton , and the instant I leave him I shall repair to the town . Perhaps I may pass the night there . "
508195	508198	508200	508201	the statesman	3214	" Levy , "
508212	508227	508278	508278	his	11444	" have you betrayed my secret - my first marriage - to Lord L'Estrange ? "
508228	508243	508273	508275	the proud man	11444	" No , Egerton ; on my honour , I have not betrayed it . "
508244	508271	508287	508287	Levy	1175	" You heard his speech ! Did you not detect a fearful irony under his praises , or is it but - but - my conscience ? "
508282	508285	508287	508287	Levy	1175	" Really , "
508289	508317	508333	508333	Egerton	500	" Lord L'Estrange seemed to me to select for his praise precisely those points in your character which any other of your friends would select for panegyric . "
508318	508331	508342	508342	he	500	" Ay , any other of my friends ! - What friends ? "
508359	508430	508342	508342	he	500	" Your presence here in this house , Levy , surprised me , as I told you at the first ; I could not conceive its necessity . Harley urged you to come , - he with whom you are no favourite ! You and he both said that your acquaintance with Richard Avenel would enable you to conciliate his opposition . I can not congratulate you on your success . "
508431	508457	508458	508458	Audley	500	" My success remains to be proved . The vehemence of his attack may be but a feint to cover his alliance to - morrow . "
508467	508501	508342	508342	he	500	" There is a change in Harley , - to me and to all ; a change , perhaps , not perceptible to others - but I have known him from a boy . "
508502	508529	508458	508458	Audley	500	" He is occupied for the first time with the practical business of life . That would account for a much greater change than you remark . "
508530	508542	508342	508342	he	500	" Do you see him familiarly , converse with him often ? "
508543	508580	508458	508458	Audley	500	" No , and only on matters connected with the election . Occasionally , indeed , he consults me as to Randal Leslie , in whom , as your special protege , he takes considerable interest . "
508581	508644	508342	508342	he	500	" That , too , surprises me . Well , I am weary of perplexing myself . This place is hateful ; after to - morrow I shall leave it , and breathe in peace . You have seen the reports of the canvass ; I have had no heart to inspect them . Is the election as safe as they say ? "
508645	508666	508697	508697	Audley	500	" If Avenel withdraws his nephew , and the votes thus released split off to you , you are secure . "
508667	508696	508717	508718	the baron	17518	" And you think his nephew will be withdrawn ? Poor young man ! defeat at his age , and with such talents , is hard to bear . "
508700	508715	508717	508718	the baron	17518	" I must leave you now , if you have nothing important to say , "
508722	508749	508342	508342	he	500	" I have much to do , as the election is yet to be won , and - to you the loss of it would be - "
508750	508880	508717	508718	the baron	17518	" Ruin , I know . Well , Levy , it is , on the whole , to your advantage that I should not lose . There may be more to get from me yet . And , judging by the letters I received this morning , my position is rendered so safe by the absolute necessity of my party to keep me up , that the news of my pecuniary difficulties will not affect me so much as I once feared . Never was my career so free from obstacle , so clear towards the highest summit of ambition ; never , in my day of ostentatious magnificence , as it is now , when I am prepared to shrink into a lodging , with a single servant . "
508881	508918	508342	508342	he	500	" I am glad to hear it ; and I am the more anxious to secure your election , upon which this career must depend , because - nay , I hardly like to tell you - "
508919	508923	508717	508718	the baron	17518	" Speak on . "
508924	508971	508977	508977	Egerton	500	" I have been obliged , by a sudden rush on all my resources , to consign some of your bills and promissory notes to another , who , if your person should not be protected from arrest by parliamentary privilege , might be harsh and - "
508972	508975	509023	509023	Sir	14889	" Traitor ! "
509030	509030	509045	509046	the baron	17518	"
509031	509043	509045	509046	the baron	17518	" You will find that you have worse friends than myself , "
509053	509118	509195	509195	he	500	" and if you are defeated , if your prospects for life are destroyed , I am the last man you will think of blaming . But I forgive your anger , and trust that to - morrow you will receive those explanations of my conduct which you are now in no temper to bear . I go to take care of the election . "
509186	509194	509195	509195	he	500	" I can not bear this suspense , "
509201	509264	509270	509278	his valet , who was waiting in the anteroom	13831	" I will see Harley myself . Open as he is , the very sound of his voice will tell me at once if I am a bankrupt even of human friendship . If that friendship be secure , if Harley yet clasp my hand with the same cordial warmth , all other loss shall not wring from my fortitude one complaint . "
509282	509298	509299	509300	The servant	3272	" Go and see if Lord L'Estrange is engaged . I would speak with him . "
509309	509334	509270	509278	his valet , who was waiting in the anteroom	13831	" I find that my Lord is now particularly engaged , since he has given strict orders that he is not to be disturbed . "
509335	509344	509299	509300	The servant	3272	" Engaged ! on what , whom with ? "
509345	509381	509270	509278	his valet , who was waiting in the anteroom	13831	" He is in his own room , sir , with a clergyman , who arrived , and dined here , to - day . I am told that he was formerly curate of Lansmere . "
509382	509396	509299	509300	The servant	3272	" Lansmere ! curate ! His name , his name ! Not Dale ? "
509397	509413	509420	509420	Audley	500	" Yes , sir , that is the name , - the Reverend Mr. Dale . "
509414	509418	509420	509420	Audley	500	" Leave me , "
509427	509470	509691	509691	he	503	" Dale ! the man who suspected Harley , who called on me in London , spoke of a child , - my child , - and sent me to find but another grave ! He closeted with Harley , - he ! "
509686	509689	509825	509825	Harley	503	" Enough , "
509697	509823	509825	509825	Harley	503	" Mr. Fairfield for so we will yet call him shall see me to - night ; and if apology be due to him , I will make it . At the same time , it shall be decided whether he continue this contest or retire . And now , Mr. Dale , it was not to hear how this young man wooed , or shrunk from wooing , my affianced bride , that I availed myself of your promise to visit me at this house . We agreed that the seducer of Nora Avenel deserved chastisement , and I promised that Nora Avenel 's son should find a father . Both these assurances shall be fulfilled to - morrow . And you , sir , "
509840	509991	510050	510050	he	446	" who wear the garb appropriated to the holiest office of Christian charity ; you who have presumed to think that , before the beard had darkened my cheek , I could first betray the girl who had been reared under this roof , then abandon her , - sneak like a dastard from the place in which my victim came to die , leave my own son , by the woman thus wronged , without thought or care , through the perilous years of tempted youth , till I found him , by chance , an outcast in a desert more dread than Hagar 's , - you , sir , who have for long years thus judged of me , shall have the occasion to direct your holy anger towards the rightful head ; and in me , you who have condemned the culprit shall respect the judge . "
510044	510048	510050	510050	he	446	" My Lord , "
510052	510250	510263	510263	Harley	503	" first , with humility I bow to your rebuke , and entreat your pardon for my erring , and , as you say , my uncharitable opinions . We dwellers in a village and obscure pastors of a humble flock , we , mercifully removed from temptation , are too apt , perhaps , to exaggerate its power over those whose lots are cast in that great world which has so many gates ever open to evil . This is my sole excuse if I was misled by what appeared to me strong circumstantial evidence . But forgive me again if I warn you not to fall into an error perhaps little lighter than my own . Your passion , when you cleared yourself from reproach , became you . But ah , my Lord , when with that stern brow and those flashing eyes , you launched your menace upon another over whom you would constitute yourself the judge , forgetful of the divine precept , ' Judge not , ' I felt that I was listening no longer to honest self - vindication , - I felt that I was listening to fierce revenge ! "
510251	510261	510263	510263	Harley	503	" Call it revenge , or what you will , "
510269	510399	510050	510050	he	446	" but I have been stung too deeply not to sting . Frank with all , till the last few days , I have ever been . Frank to you , at least , even now , this much I tell you : I pretend to no virtue in what I still hold to be justice ; but no declamations nor homilies tending to prove that justice is sinful will move my resolves . As man I have been outraged , and as man I will retaliate . The way and the mode , the true criminal and his fitting sentence , you will soon learn , sir . I have much to do to - night ; forgive me if I adjourn for the present all further conference . "
510400	510486	510495	510496	Lord L'Estrange	502	" No , no ; do not dismiss me . There is something , in spite of your present language , which so commands my interest ; I see that there has been so much suffering where there is now so much wrath , - that I would save you from the suffering worse than all , - remorse . Oh , pause , my dear Lord , pause and answer me but two questions ; then I will leave your after course to yourself . "
510487	510493	510050	510050	he	446	" Say on , sir , "
510504	510553	510558	510559	Mr. Dale	446	" First ; then , analyze your own feelings . Is this anger merely to punish an offender and to right the living , - for who can pretend to right the dead ? Or is there not some private hate that stirs and animates and confuses all ? "
510562	510650	510662	510662	Harley	503	" You loved this poor girl . Your language even now reveals it . You speak of treachery : perhaps you had a rival who deceived you ; I know not , guess not , whom . But if you would strike the rival , must you not wound the innocent son ? And , in presenting Nora 's child to his father , as you pledge yourself to do , can you mean some cruel mockery that , under seeming kindness , implies some unnatural vengeance ? "
510651	510660	510662	510662	Harley	503	" You read well the heart of man , "
510664	510685	510558	510559	Mr. Dale	446	" and I have owned to you that I am but man . Pass on ; you have another question . "
510686	510857	510863	510863	Harley	503	" And one more solemn and important . In my world of a village , revenge is a common passion ; it is the sin of the uninstructed . The savage deems it noble ! but Christ 's religion , which is the sublime Civilizer , emphatically condemns it . Why ? Because religion ever seeks to ennoble a man ; and nothing so debases him as revenge . Look into your own heart , and tell me whether , since you have cherished this passion , you have not felt all sense of right and wrong confused , - have not felt that whatever would before have seemed to you mean and base , appears now but just means to your heated end . Revenge is ever a hypocrite : rage , at least , strikes with the naked sword ; but revenge , stealthy and patient , conceals the weapon of the assassin . My Lord , your colour changes . What is your answer to my question ? "
510858	510861	510926	510926	he	503	" Oh , "
510874	510925	510926	510926	he	503	" it is not since I have cherished the revenge that I am changed , that right and wrong grow dark to me , that hypocrisy seems the atmosphere fit for earth . No ; it is since the discovery that demands the vengeance . It is useless , sir , "
510931	511060	511292	511293	Mr. Dale	446	" useless to argue with me . Were I to sit down , patient and impotent , under the sense of the wrong which I have received , I should feel , indeed , that debasement which you ascribe to the gratification of what you term revenge . I should never regain the self - esteem which the sentiment of power now restores to me ; I should feel as if the whole world could perceive and jeer at my meek humiliation . I know not why I have said so much , - why I have betrayed to you so much of my secret mind , and stooped to vindicate my purpose . I never meant it . Again I say , we must close this conference . "
511073	511200	511292	511293	Mr. Dale	446	" One word more , Lord L'Estrange , - but one . You will not hear me . I am a comparative stranger , but you have a friend , a friend dear and intimate , now under the same roof . Will you consent , at least , to take counsel of Mr. Audley Egerton ? None can doubt his friendship for you ; none can doubt that whatever he advise will be that which best becomes your honour . What , my Lord , you hesitate , - you feel ashamed to confide to your dearest friend a purpose which his mind would condemn ? Then I will seek him , I will implore him to save you from what can but entail repentance . "
511201	511283	511292	511293	Mr. Dale	446	" Mr. Dale , I must forbid you to see Mr. Egerton . What has passed between us ought to be as sacred to you as a priest of Rome holds confession . This much , however , I will say to content you : I promise that I will do nothing that shall render me unworthy of Mr. Audley Egerton 's friendship , or which his fine sense of honour shall justify him in blaming . Let that satisfy you . "
511284	511290	511292	511293	Mr. Dale	446	" Ah , my Lord , "
511307	511343	511353	511353	Harley	503	" I should indeed be satisfied if you would submit yourself to higher counsel than mine , - than Mr. Egerton 's , than man 's . Have you never felt the efficacy of prayer ? "
511344	511351	511353	511353	Harley	503	" My life has been wasted , "
511355	511403	511481	511481	Harley	503	" and I dare not , therefore , boast that I have found prayer efficacious . But , so far back as I can remember , it has at least been my habit to pray to Heaven , night and morning , until at least - until - "
511426	511480	511532	511532	her	800	" Until you have cherished revenge ? You have not dared to pray since ? Oh , reflect what evil there is within us , when we dare not come before Heaven , - dare not pray for what we wish . You are moved . I leave you to your own thoughts . "
511543	511566	511614	511614	her	800	" I have been waiting for you , dear Mr. Dale ; and so long ! You have been with Lord L'Estrange ? "
511567	511570	511532	511532	her	800	" Well ! "
511571	511586	511614	511614	her	800	" Why do you not speak ? You have left him comforted , happier ? "
511587	511592	511598	511598	Violante	800	" Happier ! No . "
511593	511596	511614	511614	her	800	" What ! "
511618	511631	511671	511671	he	446	" What ! does he then so grieve that Helen prefers another ? "
511664	511669	511671	511671	he	446	" Child , child , "
511673	511747	511758	511758	Violante	800	" I am glad that Helen has escaped Lord L'Estrange . Beware , oh , beware how he excite any gentler interest in yourself . He is a dangerous man , - more dangerous for glimpses of a fine original nature . He may well move the heart of the innocent and inexperienced , for he has strangely crept into mine . But his heart is swollen with pride and ire and malice . "
511748	511756	511758	511758	Violante	800	" You mistake ; it is false ! "
511762	511846	511986	511987	Mr. Dale	446	" I can not believe one word that would asperse him who has saved my father from a prison , or from death . You have not treated him gently . He fancies he has been wronged by Leonard , received ingratitude from Helen . He has felt the sting in proportion to his own susceptible and generous heart , and you have chided where you should have soothed . Poor Lord L'Estrange ! And you have left him still indignant and unhappy ? "
511847	511985	512580	512580	Violante	800	" Foolish girl ! I have left him meditating sin ; I have left him afraid to pray ; I have left him on the brink of some design - I know not what - but which involves more than Leonard in projects of revenge ; I have left him so , that if his heart be really susceptible and generous , he will wake from wrath to be the victim of long and unavailing remorse . If your father has influence over him , tell Dr. Riccabocca what I say , and bid him seek , and in his turn save , the man who saved himself . He has not listened to religion , - he maybe more docile to philosophy . I can not stay here longer , - I must go to Leonard . "
512599	512606	512580	512580	Violante	800	" LORD L'ESTRANGE , noble friend ! "
512607	512642	512651	512651	Violante	800	" You ! - and here - Violante ? Is it I whom you seek ? For what ? Good heavens ! what has happened ? Why are you so pale ; why tremble ? "
512643	512649	512659	512659	her	800	" Have you forgiven Helen ? "
512666	512694	512651	512651	Violante	800	" Helen , the poor child ! I have nothing in her to forgive , much to thank her for . She has been frank and honest . "
512695	512711	512718	512718	Harley	503	" And Leonard - whom I remember in my childhood - you have forgiven him ? "
512712	512716	512718	512718	Harley	503	" Fair mediator , "
512725	512755	512651	512651	Violante	800	" happy is the man who deceives another ; all plead for him . And if the man deceived can not forgive , no one will sympathize or excuse . "
512756	512764	512718	512718	Harley	503	" But Leonard did not deceive you ? "
512765	512793	512813	512813	Violante	800	" Yes , from the first . It is a long tale , and not to be told to you ; but I can not forgive him . "
512794	512812	512876	512876	he	503	" Adieu ! my Lord . Helen must , then , still be very dear to you ! "
512866	512875	512876	512876	he	503	" Stay , but talk not of Helen ! "
512879	513527	514262	514262	Violante	800	" Ah , if Leonard 's sole offence had been what you appear to deem it , do you think I could feel resentment ? No ; I should have gratefully hailed the hand that severed a rash and ungenial tie . I would have given my ward to her lover with such a dower as it suits my wealth to bestow . But his offence dates from his very birth . To bless and to enrich the son of a man who - Violante , listen to me . We may soon part , and forever . Others may misconstrue my actions ; you , at least , shall know from what just principle they spring . There was a man whom I singled out of the world as more than a brother . In the romance of my boyhood I saw one who dazzled my fancy , captivated my heart . It was a dream of Beauty breathed into waking life . I loved , - I believed myself beloved . I confided all my heart to this friend , - this more than brother ; he undertook to befriend and to aid my suit . On that very pretext he first saw this ill - fated girl , saw , betrayed , destroyed her ; left me ignorant that her love , which I had thought mine , had been lavished so wildly on another ; left me to believe that my own suit she had fled , but in generous self - sacrifice , - for she was poor and humbly born ; that - oh , vain idiot that I was ! - the self - sacrifice had been too strong for a young human heart , which had broken in the struggle ; left me to corrode my spring of life in remorse ; clasped my hand in mocking comfort , smiled at my tears of agony - not one tear himself for his own poor victim ! And suddenly , not long since , I learned all this . And in the father of Leonard Fairfield , you behold the man who has poisoned all the well - spring of joy to me . You weep ! Oh , Violante ! the Past he has blighted and embittered , - that I could forgive ; but the Future is blasted too . For just ere this treason was revealed to me , I had begun to awake from the torpor of my dreary penance , to look with fortitude towards the duties I had slighted , to own that the pilgrimage before me was not barren . And then , oh then , I felt that all love was not buried in a grave . I felt that you , had fate so granted , might have been all to my manhood which youth only saw through the delusion of its golden mists . True , I was then bound to Helen ; true , that honour to her might forbid me all hope . But still , even to know that my heart was not all ashes , that I could love again , that that glorious power and privilege of our being was still mine , seemed to me so heavenly sweet . But then this revelation of falsehood burst on me , and all truth seemed blotted from the universe . I am freed from Helen ; ah , freed , forsooth , - because not even rank and wealth , and benefits and confiding tenderness , could bind to me one human heart ! Free from her ; but between me and your fresh nature stands Suspicion as an Upas tree . Not a hope that would pass through the tainted air and fly to you , but falls dead under the dismal boughs . I love !
513528	513847	513857	513857	Violante	800	" Ha , ha ! I - I , whom the past has taught the impossibility to be loved again . No : if those soft lips murmured ' Yes ' to the burning prayer that , had I been free but two short weeks ago , would have rushed from the frank deeps of my heart , I should but imagine that you deceived yourself , - a girl 's first fleeting delusive fancy , - nothing more ! Were you my bride , Violante , I should but debase your bright nature by my own curse of distrust . At each word of tenderness , my heart would say , ' How long will this last ; when will the deception come ? ' Your beauty , your gifts , would bring me but jealous terror , eternally I should fly from the Present to the Future , and say . ' These hairs will be gray , while flattering youth will surround her in the zenith of her charms . ' Why then do I hate and curse my foe ? Why do I resolve upon revenge ? I comprehend it now . I knew that there was something more imperious than the ghost of the Past that urged me on . Gazing on you , I feel that it was the dim sense of a mighty and priceless loss ; it is not the dead Nora , - it is the living Violante . Look not at me with those reproachful eyes : they can not reverse my purpose ; they can not banish suspicion from my sickened soul ; they can not create a sunshine in the midst of this ghastly twilight . Go , go ; leave me to the sole joy that bequeaths no disappointment , the sole feeling that unites me to social man ; leave me to my revenge . "
513848	513855	513857	513857	Violante	800	" Revenge ! Oh , cruel ! "
513866	513881	514262	514262	Violante	800	" And in revenge , it is your own life that you will risk ! "
513882	513965	513857	513857	Violante	800	" My life , simple child ! This is no contest of life against life . Could I bare to all the world my wrongs for their ribald laughter , I should only give to my foe the triumph to pity my frenzy , to shun the contest ; or grant it , if I could find a second - and then fire in the air . And all the world would say , ' Generous Egerton ! soul of honour ! ' "
513966	514025	514262	514262	Violante	800	" Egerton , Mr. Egerton ! He can not be this foe ? It is not on him you can design revenge , - you who spend all your hours in serving his cause , you to whom he trusts so fondly , you who leaned yesterday on his shoulder , and smiled so cheeringly in his face ? "
514026	514043	513857	513857	Violante	800	" Did I ? Hypocrisy against hypocrisy , snare against snare : that is my revenge . "
514044	514053	514262	514262	Violante	800	" Harley , Harley ! Cease , cease ! "
514062	514102	514262	514262	Violante	800	" I seem to promote his ambition but to crush it into the mire . I have delivered him from the gentler gripe of an usurer , so that he shall hold at my option alms or a prison - "
514103	514112	514262	514262	Violante	800	" Friend , friend ! Hush , hush ! "
514113	514250	514262	514262	Violante	800	" I have made the youth he has reared and fostered into treachery like his own your father 's precious choice , Randal Leslie mine instrument in the galling lesson how ingratitude can sting . His very son shall avenge the mother , and be led to his father 's breast as victor , with Randal Leslie , in the contest that deprives sire and benefactor of all that makes life dear to ambitious egotism . And if , in the breast of Audley Egerton , there can yet lurk one memory of what I was to him and to truth , not his least punishment will be the sense that his own perfidy has so changed the man whose very scorn of falsehood has taught him to find in fraud itself the power of retribution . "
514251	514260	514262	514262	Violante	800	" If this be not a terrible dream , "
514266	514299	514262	514262	Violante	800	" it is not your foe alone that you will deprive of all that makes life dear . Act thus - and what , in the future , is left to me ? "
514300	514467	514475	514475	Violante	800	" To you ? Oh , never fear . I may give Randal Leslie a triumph over his patron , but in the same hour I will unmask his villany , and sweep him forever from your path . What in the future is left to you ? - your birthright and your native land ; hope , joy , love , felicity . Could it be possible that in the soft but sunny fancy which plays round the heart of maiden youth , but still sends no warmth into its deeps , - could it be possible that you had Honoured me with a gentler thought , it will pass away , and you will be the pride and delight of one of your own years , to whom the vista of Time is haunted by no chilling spectres , one who can look upon that lovely face , and not turn away to mutter , ' Too fair , too fair for me ! ' "
514468	514473	514475	514475	Violante	800	" Oh , agony ! "
514481	514699	514705	514705	Harley	503	" In my turn hear me . If , as you promise , I am released from the dreadful thought that he , at whose touch I shudder , can claim this hand , my choice is irrevocably made . The altars which await me will not be those of a human love . But oh , I implore you - by all the memories of your own life , hitherto , if sorrowful , unsullied , by the generous interest you yet profess for me , whom you will have twice saved from a danger to which death were mercy - leave , oh , leave to me the right to regard your image as I have done from the first dawn of childhood . Leave me the right to honour and revere it . Let not an act accompanied with a meanness - oh that I should say the word ! - a meanness and a cruelty that give the lie to your whole life - make even a grateful remembrance of you an unworthy sin . When I kneel within the walls that divide me from the world , oh , let me think that I can pray for you as the noblest being that the world contains ! Hear me ! hear me ! "
514700	514703	514705	514705	Harley	503	" Violante ! "
514714	515006	515198	515198	she	800	" bear with me . Do not ask of me the sacrifice of what seems to me the cause of manhood itself , - to sit down , meek and patient , under a wrong that debases me , with the consciousness that all my life I have been the miserable dupe to affections I deemed so honest , to regrets that I believed so holy . Ah , I should feel more mean in my pardon than you can think me in revenge ! Were it an acknowledged enemy , I could open my arms to him at your bidding ; but the perfidious friend ! - ask it not . My cheek burns at the thought , as at the stain of a blow . Give me but to - morrow - one day - I demand no more - wholly to myself and to the past , and mould me for the future as you will . Pardon , pardon the ungenerous thoughts that extended distrust to you . I retract them ; they are gone , - dispelled before those touching words , those ingenuous eyes . At your feet , Violante , I repent and I implore ! Your father himself shall banish your sordid suitor . Before this hour to - morrow you will be free . Oh , then , then ! will you not give me this hand to guide me again into the paradise of my youth ? Violante , it is in vain to wrestle with myself , to doubt , to reason , to be wisely fearful ! I love , I love you ! I trust again in virtue and faith . I place my fate in your keeping . "
515194	515197	515198	515198	she	800	" Ah , "
515205	515278	515281	515281	her	800	" ah , if heaven vouchsafe me the proud and blissful privilege to be allied to your fate , to minister to your happiness , never should I know one fear of your distrust . No time , no change , no sorrow - not even the loss of your affection - could make me forfeit the right to remember that you had once confided to me a heart so noble . But "
515296	515380	515389	515389	Harley	503	" but , O Thou the Ever Present , hear and receive the solemn vow . If to me he refuse to sacrifice the sin that would debase him , that sin be the barrier between us evermore ; and may my life , devoted to Thy service , atone for the hour in which he belied the nature he received from Thee ! Harley , release me ! I have spoken : firm as yourself , I leave the choice to you . "
515381	515387	515389	515389	Harley	503	" You judge me harshly , "
515397	515425	515438	515438	Violante	800	" but at least I have not the meanness to sell what I hold as justice , though the bribe may include my last hope of happiness . "
515426	515436	515438	515438	Violante	800	" Meanness ! Oh , unhappy , beloved Harley ! "
515462	515590	515596	515596	Harley	503	" Meanness ! But it is that from which I implore you to save yourself . You can not judge , you can not see . You are dark , dark . Lost Christian that you are , what worse than heathen darkness to feign the friendship the better to betray ; to punish falsehood by becoming yourself so false ; to accept the confidence even of your bitterest foe , and then to sink below his own level in deceit ? And oh , worse than all - to threaten that a son - son of the woman you professed to love - should swell your vengeance against a father ! No ! it was not you that said this , - it was the Fiend ! "
515591	515594	515596	515596	Harley	503	" Enough ! "
515618	515630	515712	515712	her	13872	" Enough ! you insult the man you professed to honour . "
515631	515709	516057	516057	Egerton	500	" I honoured the prototype of gentleness and valour . I honoured one who seemed to me to clothe with life every grand and generous image that is born from the souls of poets . Destroy that ideal , and you destroy the Harley whom I honoured . He is dead to me forever . I will mourn for him as his widow , faithful to his memory , weeping over the thought of what he was . "
516048	516055	516057	516057	Egerton	500	" You have seen Mr. Dale ? "
516062	516066	516072	516072	Harley	503	" You know - "
516067	516070	516079	516079	Audley	500	" All ! "
516085	516113	516124	516124	Harley	503	" Be it so ; but no , Harley , you deceive yourself ; you can not know all , from any one living , save myself . "
516114	516122	516271	516271	Harley	503	" My knowledge comes from the dead , "
516264	516269	516271	516271	Harley	503	" Hold yet awhile , "
516273	516373	516381	516381	Audley	500	" I produce my charge , and then I leave you to dispute the only witness that I bring . Audley Egerton , you took from me the gravest trust one man can confide to another . You knew how I loved Leonora Avenel . I was forbidden to see and urge my suit ; you had the access to her presence which was denied to myself . I prayed you to remove scruples that I deemed too generous , and to woo her not to dishonour , but to be my wife . Was it so ? Answer . "
516374	516379	516381	516381	Audley	500	" It is true , "
516390	516417	516468	516470	The strong man	9156	" You saw her whom I thus loved , - her thus confided to your honour . You wooed her for yourself . Is it so ? "
516418	516467	516496	516496	he	503	" Harley , I deny it not . Cease here . I accept the penalty ; I resign your friendship ; I quit your roof ; I submit to your contempt ; I dare not implore your pardon . Cease ; let me go hence , and soon ! "
516491	516494	516496	516496	he	503	" Nay , "
516498	516546	516468	516470	The strong man	9156	" is that ALL ? You wooed her for yourself , - you won her . Account to me for that life which you wrenched from mine . You are silent . I will take on myself your task ; you took that life and destroyed it . "
516547	516554	516496	516496	he	503	" Spare me , spare me ! "
516555	516591	516468	516470	The strong man	9156	" What was the fate of her who seemed so fresh from heaven when these eyes beheld her last ? A broken heart , a dishonoured name , an early doom , a forgotten gravestone ! "
516592	516602	516496	516496	he	503	" No , no - forgotten , - no ! "
516603	516676	516689	516689	he	500	" Not forgotten ! Scarce a year passed , and you were married to another . I aided you to form those nuptials which secured your fortunes . You have had rank and power and fame . Peers call you the type of English gentlemen ; priests hold you as a model of Christian honour . Strip the mask , Audley Egerton ; let the world know you for what you are ! "
516697	516711	516689	516689	he	500	" I bear all from you ; it is just . Say on . "
516712	516766	516787	516787	Harley	503	" You took from me the heart of Nora Avenel . You abandoned her , you destroyed . And her memory cast no shadow over your daily sunshine ; while over my thoughts , over my life - oh , Egerton - Audley , Audley - how could you have deceived me thus ! "
516798	516850	516787	516787	Harley	503	" Deceived , - not for an hour , a day , but through blighted youth , through listless manhood , - you suffered me to nurse the remorse that should have been your own ; her life slain , mine wasted , - and shall neither of us have revenge ? "
516851	516863	516787	516787	Harley	503	" Revenge ! Ah , Harley , you have had it ! "
516864	516920	516787	516787	Harley	503	" No , but I await it ! Not in vain from the charnel have come to me the records I produce . And whom did fate select to discover the wrongs of the mother , whom appoint as her avenger ? Your son , - your own son ; your abandoned , nameless son ! "
516921	516926	516787	516787	Harley	503	" Son ! son ! "
516927	516982	516992	516992	Egerton	500	" Whom I delivered from famine , or from worse ; and who , in return , has given into my hands the evidence which proclaims in you the perjured friend of Harley L'Estrange , and the fraudulent seducer , under mock marriage forms - worse than all franker sin - of Leonora Avenel . "
516983	516990	516992	516992	Egerton	500	" It is false ! false ! "
517005	517030	517036	517036	Harley	503	" I forbid you to speak thus to me . I forbid you by one word to sully the memory of my lawful wife ! "
517031	517034	517036	517036	Harley	503	" Ah ! "
517040	517056	517207	517207	He	13889	" Ah ! false ? prove that , and revenge is over ! Thank Heaven ! "
517057	517206	517227	517227	Harley	503	" Prove it ! What so easy ? And wherefore have I delayed the proof ; wherefore concealed , but from tenderness to you , - dread , too - a selfish but human dread - to lose in you the sole esteem that I covet ; the only mourner who would have shed one tear over the stone inscribed with some lying epitaph , in which it will suit a party purpose to proclaim the gratitude of a nation . Vain hope . I resign it ! But you spoke of a son . Alas , alas ! you are again deceived . I heard that I had a son , - years , long years ago . I sought him , and found a grave . But bless you , Harley , if you succoured one whom you even erringly suspect to be Leonora 's child ! "
517216	517225	517227	517227	Harley	503	" Of your son we will speak later , "
517232	517257	517265	517265	Egerton	500	" But before I say more of him , let me ask you to explain ; let me hope that you can extenuate what - "
517258	517263	517265	517265	Egerton	500	" You are right , "
517271	517302	517448	517448	Harley	503	" You would know from my own lips at last the plain tale of my own offence against you . It is due to both . Patiently hear me out . "
517443	517446	517448	517448	Harley	503	" Egerton , "
517467	517538	517655	517655	He	500	" if , on reading those papers , you find that Leonora had more excuse for her suspicions and flight than you now deem , and discover perfidy in one to whom you trusted your secret , leave his punishment to Heaven . All that you say convinces me more and more that we can not even see through the cloud , much less guide the thunderbolt . But proceed . "
517632	517654	517664	517665	Mr. Dale	446	" that he would rather mourn Nora 's death , than take comfort from the thought that she had loved another . "
517675	517705	517812	517812	he	13902	" and , hearing that child and mother were alike gone , whom now could I right by acknowledging a bond that I feared would so wring your heart ? "
517785	517788	517884	517884	Egerton	500	" career ; "
517873	517882	517884	517884	Egerton	500	" Selfish in these attempts I might be , "
517886	518016	518145	518145	Egerton	500	" it was only if I saw you restored to happiness that I could believe you could calmly hear my explanation of the past , and on the floor of some happy home grant me your forgiveness . I longed to confess , and I dared not . Often have the words rushed to my lips , - as often some chance sentence from you repelled me . In a word , with you were so entwined all the thoughts and affections of my youth - even those that haunted the grave of Nora - that I could not bear to resign your friendship , and , surrounded by the esteem and honour of a world I cared not for , to meet the contempt of your reproachful eye . "
518149	518164	518170	518170	Harley	503	" And now , Harley , all is told . You spoke of revenge ? "
518165	518168	518181	518181	Egerton	500	" Revenge ! "
518174	518179	518181	518181	Egerton	500	" And believe me , "
518183	518269	518301	518301	Audley	500	" were revenge in your power , I should rejoice at it as an atonement . To receive an injury in return for that which , first from youthful passion , and afterwards from the infirmity of purpose that concealed the wrong , I have inflicted upon you - why , that would soothe my conscience , and raise my lost self - esteem . The sole revenge you can bestow takes the form which most humiliates me , - to revenge is to pardon . "
518310	518401	518409	518409	Harley	503	" And NOW , Harley , farewell . With the dawn I leave this house . I can not now accept your aid in this election . Levy shall announce my resignation . Randal Leslie , if you so please it , may be returned in my stead . He has abilities which , under safe guidance , may serve his country ; and I have no right to reject from vain pride whatever will promote the career of one whom I undertook , and have failed , to serve . "
518402	518407	518409	518409	Harley	503	" Ay , ay , "
518411	518424	518301	518301	Audley	500	" think not of Randal Leslie ; think but of your son . "
518425	518474	518608	518608	He	500	" My son ! But are you sure that he still lives ? You smile ; you - you - oh , Harley , I took from you the mother , - give to me the son ; break my heart with gratitude . Your revenge is found ! "
518539	518607	518615	518615	himself	503	" You think that I ask too much ; and yet all that I can give to the child of my love and the heir of my name is the worthless blessing of a ruined man . Harley , I say no more . I dare not add , ' You too loved his mother ! and with a deeper and a nobler love than mine . ' "
518620	518720	518736	518736	Egerton	500	" Me - me - pardon me , Audley ! Your offence has been slight to mine . You have told me your offence ; never can I name to you my own . Rejoice that we have both to exchange forgiveness , and in that exchange we are equal still , Audley , brothers still . Look up ! look up ! think that we are boys now as we were once , - boys who have had their wild quarrel , and who , the moment it is over , feel dearer to each other than before . "
518721	518734	518768	518768	he	500	" Oh , Harley , this is revenge ! It strikes home , "
518761	518767	518768	518768	he	500	" I have time yet , "
518771	518847	518859	518859	Dick	643	" Much to do and to undo . You are saved from the grasp of Levy ; your election will be won ; your fortunes in much may be restored ; you have before you honours not yet achieved ; your career as yet is scarce begun ; your son will embrace you to - morrow . Let me go - your hand again ! Ah , Audley , we shall be so happy yet ! "
518851	518857	518864	518864	Randal	570	" There is a hitch , "
518875	518882	518883	518883	RANDAL	570	" Life is full of hitches . "
518886	518906	518907	518907	DICK	643	" The art of life is to smooth them away . What hitch is this , my dear Avenel ? "
518910	518937	518938	518938	RANDAL	570	" Leonard has taken huff at certain expressions of Lord L'Estrange 's at the nomination to - day , and talks of retiring from the contest . "
518944	518972	518973	518973	DICK	643	" But his resignation would smooth a hitch , - not create one . The votes promised to him would thus be freed , and go to - "
518976	518984	518985	518985	RANDAL	570	" The Right Honourable Red - Tapist ! "
518988	518993	518994	518994	DICK	643	" Are you serious ? "
518997	519107	519108	519108	RANDAL	570	" As an undertaker ! The fact is , there are two parties among the Yellows as there are in the Church , - High Yellow and Low Yellow . Leonard has made great way with the High Yellows , and has more influence with them than I ; and the High Yellows infinitely preferred Egerton to yourself . They say , ' Politics apart , he would be an honour to the borough . ' Leonard is of the same opinion ; and if he retires , I do n't think I could coax either him or the Highflyers to make you any the better by his resignation . "
519111	519132	519133	519133	DICK	643	" But surely your nephew 's sense of gratitude to you would induce him not to go against your wishes ? "
519136	519232	519233	519233	RANDAL	570	" Unluckily , the gratitude is all the other way . It is I who am under obligations to him , - not he to me . As for Lord L'Estrange , I ca n't make head or tail of his real intentions ; and why he should have attacked Leonard in that way puzzles me more than all , for he wished Leonard to stand ; and Levy has privately informed me that , in spite of my Lord 's friendship for the Right Honourable , you are the man he desires to secure . "
519236	519248	519249	519249	DICK	643	" He has certainly shown that desire throughout the whole canvass . "
519252	519289	519290	519290	RANDAL	570	" I suspect that the borough - mongers have got a seat for Egerton elsewhere ; or , perhaps , should his party come in again , he is to be pitchforked into the Upper House . "
519294	519355	519356	519356	DICK	643	" Ah , Avenel , you are so shrewd ; you see through everything . I will also add that Egerton wants some short respite from public life , in order to nurse his health and attend to his affairs , otherwise I could not even contemplate the chance of the electors preferring me to him , without a pang . "
519359	519502	519503	519503	RANDAL	570	" Pang ! stuff - considerable . The oak - trees do n't hear us ! You want to come into parliament , and no mistake . If I am the man to retire , - as I always proposed , and had got Leonard to agree to , before this confounded speech of L'Estrange 's , - come into parliament you will , for the Low Yellows I can twist round my finger , provided the High Yellows will not interfere ; in short , I could transfer to you votes promised to me , but I ca n't answer for those promised to Leonard . Levy tells me you are to marry a rich girl , and will have lots of money ; so , of course , you will pay my expenses if you come in through my votes . "
519506	519515	519516	519516	DICK	643	" My dear Avenel , certainly I will . "
519519	519533	519534	519534	RANDAL	570	" And I have two private bills I want to smuggle through parliament . "
519537	519588	519589	519589	DICK	643	" They shall be smuggled , rely on it . Mr. Fairfield being on one side of the House , and I on the other , we two could prevent all unpleasant opposition . Private bills are easily managed , - with that tact which I flatter myself I possess . "
519592	519648	519589	519589	DICK	643	" And when the bills are through the House , and you have had time to look about you , I dare say you will see that no man can go against Public Opinion , unless he wants to knock his own head against a stone wall ; and that Public Opinion is decidedly Yellow . "
519654	519734	519735	519735	DICK	643	" I can not deny that Public Opinion is Yellow ; and at my age , it is natural that I should not commit myself to the policy of a former generation . Blue is fast wearing out . But , to return to Mr. Fairfield : you do not speak as if you had no hope of keeping him straight to what I understand to be his agreement with yourself . Surely his honour is engaged to it ? "
519738	519820	519821	519821	RANDAL	570	" I do n't know as to honour ; but he has now taken a fancy to public life , - at least so he said no later than this morning before we went into the hall ; and I trust that matters will come right . Indeed , I left him with Parson Dale , who promised me that he would use all his best exertions to reconcile Leonard and my Lord , and that Leonard should do nothing hastily . "
519824	519857	519858	519858	DICK	643	" But why should Mr. Fairfield retire because Lord L'Estrange wounds his feelings ? I am sure Mr. Fairfield has wounded mine , but that does not make me think of retiring . "
519861	520003	520004	520004	RANDAL	570	" Oh , Leonard is a poet , and poets are quite as crotchety as L'Estrange said they were . And Leonard is under obligations to Lord L'Estrange , and thought that Lord L'Estrange was pleased by his standing ; whereas , now - In short , it is all Greek to me , except that Leonard has mounted his high horse , and if that throws him , I am afraid it will throw you . But still I have great confidence in Parson Dale , - a good fellow who has much influence with Leonard . And though I thought it right to be above - board , and let you know where the danger lies , yet one thing I can promise , - if I resign , you shall come in ; so shake hands on it . "
520007	520019	520020	520020	DICK	643	" My dear Avenel ! And your wish is to resign ? "
520023	520068	520069	520069	RANDAL	570	" Certainly . I should do so a little time after noon , contriving to be below Leonard on the poll . You know Emanuel Trout , the captain of the Hundred and Fifty ' Waiters on Providence , ' as they are called ? "
520072	520079	520080	520080	DICK	643	" To be sure I do . "
520083	520121	520069	520069	RANDAL	570	" When Emanuel Trout comes into the booth , you will know how the election turns . As he votes , all the Hundred and Fifty will vote . Now I must go back . Good - night .
520122	520176	520177	520177	RANDAL	570	" You 'll not forget that my expenses are to be paid . Point of honour . Still , if they are not paid , the election can be upset , - petition for bribery and corruption ; and if they are paid , why , Lansmere may be your seat for life . "
520180	520206	520207	520207	DICK	643	" Your expenses shall be paid the moment my marriage gives me the means to pay them , - and that must be very soon . "
520210	520224	520225	520225	RANDAL	570	" So Levy says . And my little jobs - the private bills ? "
520228	520238	520239	520239	DICK	643	" Consider the bills passed and the jobs done . "
520242	520276	520277	520277	RANDAL	570	" And one must not forget one 's country . One must do the best one can for one 's principles . Egerton is infernally Blue . You allow Public Opinion - is - "
520280	520289	520290	520290	DICK	643	" Yellow . Not a doubt of it . "
520293	520306	520307	520307	RANDAL	570	" Good - night . Ha , ha ! humbug , eh ? "
520310	520336	520337	520337	DICK	643	" Humbug ! Between men like us , - oh , no . Good - night , my dear friend , I rely on you . "
520340	520356	520357	520357	RANDAL	570	" Yes ; but mind , I promise nothing if Leonard Fairfield does not stand . "
520360	520379	520380	520380	DICK	643	" He must stand ; keep him to it . Your affairs , your business , your mill - "
520383	520399	520417	520418	Lord L'Estrange	502	" Very true . He must stand . I have great faith in Parson Dale . "
520420	520565	520566	520567	LORD L'ESTRANGE	502	" I have just been privately into the town , my dear Lord , and heard a strange rumour , that Mr. Fairfield was so annoyed by some remarks in your Lordship 's admirable speech , that he talks of retiring from the contest . That would give a new feature to the election , and perplex all our calculations ; and I fear , in that case , there might be some secret coalition between Avenel 's friends and our Committee , whom , I am told , I displeased by the moderate speech which your Lordship so eloquently defended , - a coalition by which Avenel would come in with Mr. Egerton , whereas , if we all four stand , Mr. Egerton , I presume , will be quite safe , - and I certainly think I have an excellent chance . "
520570	520602	520603	520603	RANDAL	570	" SO Mr. Fairfield would retire in consequence of my remarks ! I am going into the town , and I intend to apologize for those remarks , and retract them . "
520607	520610	520642	520642	he	502	" Noble ! "
520626	520640	520712	520712	Harley	503	" Mr. Egerton has thought more of your success than of his own , "
520706	520710	520712	520712	Harley	503	" Skulking knave ! "
520714	520755	520818	520818	He	503	" At least there will be nothing to repent , if I can do justice on him . That is not revenge . Come , that must be a fair retribution . Besides , how else can I deliver Violante ? "
520826	520843	520856	520856	Dick	643	" Well met ! I was going to you . We have the election to settle . "
520844	520854	520880	520880	Harley	503	" On the terms I mentioned to your Lordship ? "
520860	520879	520913	520913	Avenel	643	" I will agree to return one of your candidates ; but it must not be Audley Egerton . "
520908	520911	520913	520913	Avenel	643	" Certainly , "
520921	521008	520913	520913	Avenel	643	" one would do a great deal to serve a family connection , - and a connection that does a man so much credit ; and how can one go against one 's own brother - in - law , - a gentleman of such high standing , pull up the whole family ! How pleased Mrs. Richard Avenel will be ! Why the devil did not I know it before ? And poor - dear - dear Nora . Ah , that she were living ! "
521014	521057	520913	520913	Avenel	643	" Her name will be righted ; and I will explain why it was my fault that Egerton did not before acknowledge his marriage , and claim you as a brother . Come , then , it is all fixed and settled . "
521058	521125	520913	520913	Avenel	643	" No , my Lord ; I am pledged the other way . I do n't see how I can get off my word - to Randal Leslie . I 'm not over nice , nor what is called Quixotic ; but still my word is given that if I retire from the election , I will do my best to return Leslie instead of Egerton . "
521126	521140	520913	520913	Avenel	643	" I know that through Baron Levy . But if your nephew retires ? "
521141	521176	520913	520913	Avenel	643	" Oh , that would solve all difficulties . But the poor boy has now a wish to come into parliament ; and he has done me a service in the hour of need . "
521177	521227	521262	521262	Dick	643	" Leave it to me . And as to Randal Leslie , he shall have an occasion himself to acquit you and redeem himself ; and happy , indeed , will it be for him if he has yet one spark of gratitude , or one particle of honour ! "
521274	521300	521318	521318	Dick	643	" My poor mother ! I understand now why she would never talk to me of Nora . When may I tell her the truth ? "
521301	521317	521318	521318	Dick	643	" To - morrow evening , after the election , Egerton shall embrace you all . "
521324	521341	521478	521478	He	503	" See Leonard as soon as you can , - there is no time to lose , "
521419	521477	521478	521478	He	503	" Leonard , I was coming to you . Give me your hand . Forget for the present the words that justly stung and offended you . I will do more than apologize , - I will repair the wrong . Excuse me , Mr. Dale , I have one word to say in private to Leonard . "
521483	521509	521478	521478	He	503	" Avenel tells me that if you were to retire from this contest , it would be a sacrifice of inclination . Is it so ? "
521510	521622	521478	521478	He	503	" My Lord , I have sorrows that I would fain forget ; and though I at first shrunk from the strife in which I have been since engaged , yet now a literary career seems to me to have lost its old charm ; and I find that , in public life , there is a distraction to the thoughts which embitter solitude , that books fail to bestow . Therefore , if you still wish me to continue this contest , though I know not your motive , it will not be as it was to begin it , - a reluctant and a painful obedience to your request . "
521623	521649	521478	521478	He	503	" I understand . It was a sacrifice of inclination to begin the contest ; it would be now a sacrifice of inclination to withdraw ? "
521650	521658	521478	521478	He	503	" Honestly , yes , my Lord . "
521659	521744	521754	521754	Leonard	450	" I rejoice to hear it , for I ask that sacrifice , - a sacrifice which you will recall hereafter with delight and pride ; a sacrifice sweeter , if I read your nature aright - oh , sweeter far , than all which commonplace ambition could bestow ! And when you learn why I make this demand , you will say , ' This , indeed , is reparation for the words that wounded my affections , and wronged my heart . ' "
521745	521752	521754	521754	Leonard	450	" My Lord , my Lord ! "
521756	521826	521866	521866	Harley	503	" the injury is repaired already . You give me back your esteem , when you so well anticipate my answer . Your esteem ! - life smiles again . I can return to my more legitimate career without a sigh . I have no need of distraction from thought now . You will believe that , whatever my past presumption , I can pray sincerely for your happiness . "
521827	521864	521866	521866	Harley	503	" Poet , you adorn your career ; you fulfil your mission , even at this moment ; you beautify the world ; you give to the harsh form of Duty the cestus of the Graces , "
521878	521981	522100	522100	PARSON	445	" But we must hasten back to the prose of existence . I accept your sacrifice . As for the time and mode I must select in order to insure its result , I will ask you to abide by such instructions as I shall have occasion to convey through your uncle . Till then , no word of your intentions , - not even to Mr. Dale . Forgive me if I would rather secure Mr. Egerton 's election than yours . Let that explanation suffice for the present . What think you , by the way , of Audley Egerton ? "
521982	522066	522074	522075	Mr. Dale	446	" I thought when I heard him speak and when he closed with those touching words , - implying that he left all of his life not devoted to his country ' to the charity of his friends , ' - how proudly , even as his opponent , I could have clasped his hand ; and if he had wronged me in private life , I should have thought it ingratitude to the country he had so served to remember the offence . "
522077	522099	522100	522100	PARSON	445	" Leave Leonard to go home by himself ; you see that I have healed whatever wounds I inflicted on him . "
522103	522128	522129	522129	HARLEY	503	" And , your better nature thus awakened , I trust , my dear Lord , that you have altogether abandoned the idea of - "
522132	522163	522164	522166	MR . DALE	446	" Revenge ? - no . And if you do not approve that revenge to - morrow , I will never rest till I have seen you - a bishop ! "
522171	522178	522179	522179	HARLEY	503	" My Lord , for shame ! "
522183	522211	522241	522241	Harley	503	" My levity is but lip - deep , my dear Mr. Dale . But sometimes the froth on the wave shows the change in the tide . "
522232	522239	522241	522241	Harley	503	" Return to the Park now , "
522245	522269	522339	522339	he	570	" and tell Violante , if it be not too late to see her , that she was even more eloquent than you . "
522342	522411	522419	522421	the unsuspecting parson	13925	" I was sorry to learn that Mr. Fairfield had been so hurt by Lord L'Estrange 's severe allusions . Pity that political differences should interfere with private friendships ; but I hear that you have been to Mr. Fairfield , - and , doubtless , as the peacemaker . Perhaps you met Lord L'Estrange by the way ? He promised me that he would apologize and retract . "
522412	522417	522419	522421	the unsuspecting parson	13925	" Good young man ! "
522423	522429	522339	522339	he	570	" he has done so . "
522430	522446	522419	522421	the unsuspecting parson	13925	" And Mr. Leonard Fairfield will , therefore , I presume , continue the contest ? "
522447	522482	522488	522488	Randal	570	" Contest - ah , this election ! I suppose so , of course . But I grieve that he should stand against you , who seem to be disposed towards him so kindly . "
522483	522486	522488	522488	Randal	570	" Oh , "
522495	522516	522672	522684	son , who were now joining in the chorus of " Blue forever	26144	" we have fought before , you know , and I beat him then . I may do so again ! "
522682	522686	522731	522732	the baron	17518	" Blue forever ! "
522719	522729	522812	522812	Levy	1175	" All the Hundred and Fifty are in there , "
522746	522810	522812	522812	Levy	1175	" I have seen them all privately , in tens at a time ; and I have been telling the ladies without that it will be best for the interest of their families to go home , and let us lock up the Hundred and Fifty safe from the Yellows , till we bring them to the poll . But I am afraid , "
522814	522872	522887	522887	Harley	503	" that the rascals are not to be relied upon unless I actually pay them beforehand ; and that would be disreputable , immoral , - and , what is more , it would upset the election . Besides , if they are paid beforehand , query , is it quite sure how they will vote afterwards ? "
522873	522885	522887	522887	Harley	503	" Mr. Avenel , I dare say , can manage them , "
522889	522912	522740	522740	his	17518	" Pray do nothing immoral , and nothing that will upset the election . I think you might as well go home . "
522913	522993	523006	523006	Harley	503	" Home ! No , pardon me , my Lord ; there must be some head to direct the Committee , and keep our captains at their posts upon the doubtful electors . A great deal of mischief may be done between this and the morrow ; and I would sit up all night - ay , six nights a week for the next three months - to prevent any awkward mistake by which Audley Egerton can be returned . "
522994	523004	522740	522740	his	17518	" His return would really grieve you so much ? "
523008	523026	523120	523120	Levy	1175	" You may judge of that by the zeal with which I enter into all your designs . "
523083	523092	523120	523120	Levy	1175	" Avenel forever ! Avenel and the Yellows ! "
523093	523118	523123	523123	he	1175	" Excuse me , my Lord , I must go back and watch over my black sheep , if I would have them blue ! "
523134	523138	523241	523242	the baron	17518	" Avenel forever ! "
523235	523239	523245	523245	he	17518	" After all , "
523262	523266	523245	523245	he	17518	" Rule Britannia , "
523268	523290	523300	523302	a fine lass	13960	" after all , Avenel hates Egerton as much as I do , and both sides work to the same end . "
523308	523316	524726	524726	he	500	" For Britons never will be slaves ! "
524731	524771	524792	524792	he	503	" So early ! Ah , I remember , it is the day for our great boat - race . We shall have the current against us ; but you and I together - when did we ever lose ? "
524804	524861	524872	524872	Egerton	500	" True , my Audley , - you and I together - when did we ever lose ? But will you rise ? I wish you would be at the polling - place to shake hands with your voters as they come up . By four o'clock you will be released , and the election won . "
524862	524870	524872	524872	Egerton	500	" The election ! How ! what ! "
524877	524925	525000	525000	All	6496	" I recollect now . Yes , - I accept this last kindness from you . I always said I would die in harness . Public life - I have no other . Ah , I dream again ! Oh , Harley my son , my son ! "
524926	524958	524964	524964	Egerton	500	" You shall see him after four o'clock . You will be proud of each other . But make haste and dress . Shall I ring the bell for your servant ? "
524959	524962	525200	525200	Harley	503	" Do , "
525194	525198	525200	525200	Harley	503	" Mr. Leslie , "
525217	525302	525321	525321	he	570	" you remember that you were good enough to volunteer to me the explanation of certain circumstances in connection with the Count di Peschiera , which you gave to the Duke di Serrano ; and I replied that my thoughts were at present engaged on the election , but as soon as that was over , I should be very willing to listen to any communications affecting yourself and my old friend the duke , with which you might be pleased to favour me . "
525325	525367	525598	525598	he	503	" Upon that , as upon any other matter that may influence the judgment you form of me , I shall be but too eager to remove a single doubt that , in your eyes , can rest upon my honour . "
525368	525502	525509	525509	Randal	570	" You speak exceedingly well , Mr. Leslie ; no man can express himself more handsomely ; and I will claim your promise with the less scruple because the duke is powerfully affected by the reluctance of his daughter to ratify the engagement that binds his honour , in case your own is indisputably cleared . I may boast of some influence over the young lady , since I assisted to save her from the infamous plot of Peschiera ; and the duke urges me to receive your explanation , in the belief that , if it satisfy me , as it has satisfied him , I may conciliate his child in favour of the addresses of a suitor who would have hazarded his very life against so redoubted a duellist as Peschiera . "
525503	525507	525509	525509	Randal	570	" Lord L'Estrange , "
525513	525577	525588	525588	Harley	503	" I shall indeed owe you much if you can remove that reluctance on the part of my betrothed bride , which alone clouds my happiness , and which would at once put an end to my suit , did I not ascribe it to an imperfect knowledge of myself , which I shall devote my life to improve into confidence and affection . "
525578	525586	525621	525621	L'Estrange	502	" No man can speak more handsomely , "
525609	525619	525621	525621	L'Estrange	502	" I am happy to inform you , too , "
525623	525638	525644	525644	Randal	570	" that if your marriage with the Duke of Serrano 's daughter take place - "
525639	525642	525621	525621	L'Estrange	502	" If ! "
525646	525799	525813	525813	Randal	570	" I beg pardon for making an hypothesis of what you claim the right to esteem a certainty , - I correct my expression : when your marriage with that young lady takes place , you will at least escape the rock on which many young men of ardent affections have split at the onset of the grand voyage . You will form no imprudent connection . In a word , I received yesterday a despatch from Vienna , which contains the full pardon and formal restoration of Alphonso , Duke di Serrano . And I may add , that the Austrian government sometimes misunderstood in this country is bound by the laws it administers , and can in no way dictate to the duke , once restored , as to the choice of his son - in - law , or as to the heritage that may devolve on his child . "
525800	525811	525621	525621	L'Estrange	502	" And does the duke yet know of his recall ? "
525823	525857	525858	525860	Audley 's servant	11790	" No . I reserve that good news , with other matters , till after the election is over . But Egerton keeps us waiting sadly . Ah , here comes his valet . "
525863	525903	526000	526000	Randal	570	" Mr. Egerton feels himself rather more poorly than usual , my Lord ; he begs you will excuse his going with you into the town at present . He will come later if his presence is absolutely necessary . "
525904	525954	526024	526025	The voters	13239	" No . Pray tell him to rest and nurse himself . I should have liked him to witness his own triumph , - that is all . Say I will represent him at the polling - place . Gentlemen , are you ready ? We will go on . "
526016	526023	526106	526106	Randal	570	" See the Conquering Hero comes . "
526056	526059	526157	526157	he	570	" management , "
526188	526191	526373	526373	Levy	1175	" explanations . "
526381	526452	526527	526527	he	502	" They begin to fear for Egerton . They want a compromise in order to secure him . They will propose to you to resign , if Avenel will withdraw Leonard . Do n't be entrapped . L'Estrange may put the question to you ; but - a word in your ear - he would be glad enough to throw over Egerton . Rely upon this , and stand firm . "
526522	526525	526527	526527	he	502	" Yes , "
526531	526594	526601	526601	L'Estrange	502	" I will give this young man the fair occasion to prove gratitude to his benefactor ; and if he here acquit himself , I will spare him , at least , public exposure of his deceit to others . So young , he must have some good in him , - at least towards the man to whom he owes all . "
526595	526599	526601	526601	L'Estrange	502	" Mr. Leslie , "
526605	526691	526705	526705	Levy	1175	" you see the state of the poll . Our Committee believe that , if you continue to stand , Egerton must be beaten . They fear that , Leonard Fairfield having little chance , the Yellows will not waste their second votes on him , but will transfer them to you , in order to keep out Egerton . If you retire , Egerton will be safe . There is reason to suppose that Leonard would , in that case , also be withdrawn . "
526692	526703	526705	526705	Levy	1175	" You can hope and fear nothing more from Egerton , "
526707	526732	526823	526829	a rich , blunt master - butcher	14045	" He is utterly ruined ; and , if he lose , will sleep in a prison . The bailiffs are waiting for him . "
526814	526821	526823	526829	a rich , blunt master - butcher	14045	" You see , young sir , "
526831	526892	526899	526899	Randal	570	" that it was an honourable understanding that Mr. Egerton was to be safe . You had no claim on us , except as fighting second to him . And we are all astonished that you do n't say at once , ' Save Egerton , of course . ' Excuse my freedom , sir . No time for palaver . "
526893	526897	526899	526899	Randal	570	" Lord L'Estrange , "
526907	526970	526823	526829	a rich , blunt master - butcher	14045	" do you , as the first here in rank and influence , and as Mr. Egerton 's especial friend , call upon me to sacrifice my election , and what appear to be the inclinations of the majority of the constituents , in order to obtain what is , after all , a doubtful chance of returning Mr. Egerton in my room ?
526971	527002	526899	526899	Randal	570	" I do not call upon you , Mr. Leslie . It is a matter of feeling or of honour , which a gentleman can very well decide for himself . "
527003	527029	526823	526829	a rich , blunt master - butcher	14045	" Was any such compact made between your Lordship and myself , when you first gave me your interest and canvassed for me in person ? "
527030	527047	526899	526899	Randal	570	" Certainly not . Gentlemen , be silent . No such compact was mentioned by me . "
527048	527133	527171	527171	Randal	570	" Neither was it by Mr. Egerton . Whatever might be the understanding spoken of by the respected elector who addressed me , I was no party to it . I am persuaded that Mr. Egerton is the last person who would wish to owe his election to a trick upon the electors in the midst of the polling , and to what the world would consider a very unhandsome treatment of myself , upon whom all the toil of the canvass has devolved . "
527166	527169	527171	527171	Randal	570	" Nevertheless , "
527173	527285	527326	527326	he	570	" I would at once retire were I not under the firm persuasion that I shall convince all present , who now seem to condemn me , that I act precisely according to Mr. Egerton 's own private inclinations . That gentleman , in fact , has never been amongst you , has not canvassed in person , has taken no trouble , beyond a speech , that was evidently meant to be but a general defence of his past political career . What does this mean ? Simply that his standing has been merely a form , to comply with the wish of his party , against his own desire . "
527337	527607	527614	527614	Levy	1175	" I will be plain with you , gentlemen . My character , my desire to stand well with you all , oblige me to be so . Mr. Egerton does not wish to come into parliament at present . His health is much broken ; his private affairs need all his time and attention . I am , I may say , as a son to him . He is most anxious for my success ; Lord L'Estrange told me but last night , very truly , ' more anxious for my success than his own . ' Nothing could please him more than to think I were serving in parliament , however humbly , those great interests which neither health nor leisure will , in this momentous crisis , allow himself to defend with his wonted energy . Later , indeed , no doubt , he will seek to return to an arena in which he is so distinguished ; and when the popular excitement , which produces the popular injustice of the day , is over , what constituency will not be proud to return such a man ? In support and proof of what I have thus said , I now appeal to Mr. Egerton 's own agent , - a gentleman who , in spite of his vast fortune and the rank he holds in society , has consented to act gratuitously on behalf of that great statesman . I ask you , then , respectfully , Baron Levy , Is not Mr. Egerton 's health much broken , and in need of rest ? "
527608	527612	527326	527326	he	570	" It is , "
527616	527629	527326	527326	he	570	" And do not his affairs necessitate his serious and undivided attention ? "
527630	527635	527637	527638	the baron	17518	" They do indeed , "
527640	527666	527676	527677	the butcher	2472	" Gentlemen , I have nothing to urge in behalf of my distinguished friend as against the statement of his adopted son , Mr. Leslie . "
527667	527674	527676	527677	the butcher	2472	" Then all I can say , "
527687	527714	527722	527722	Harley	503	" is , that Mr. Egerton has behaved d - -d unhandsome to us , and we shall be the laughing - stock of the borough . "
527715	527720	527722	527722	Harley	503	" Softly , softly , "
527724	527737	527676	527677	the butcher	2472	" There is a knock at the door behind . Excuse me . "
527760	527778	527722	527722	Harley	503	" Are we then to understand , Mr. Leslie , that your intention is not to resign ? "
527779	527826	527834	527834	Harley	503	" Unless your Lordship actually urge me to the contrary , I should say , Let the election go on , and all take our chance . That seems to me the fair , manly , ENGLISH great emphasis on the last adjective , honourable course . "
527827	527832	527834	527834	Harley	503	" Be it so , "
527836	527898	527920	527921	the baron	17518	" ' let all take their chance . ' Mr. Leslie , we will no longer detain you . Go back to the polling - place , - one of the candidates should be present ; and you , Baron Levy , be good enough to go also , and return thanks to those who may yet vote for Mr. Egerton . "
527913	527918	527920	527921	the baron	17518	" Capital , capital , "
527923	527930	527920	527921	the baron	17518	" You have a wonderful head . "
527931	528045	527920	527921	the baron	17518	" I did not like L'Estrange 's look , nevertheless . But he ca n't hurt me now ; the votes he got for me instead of for Egerton have already polled . The Committee , indeed , may refuse to vote for me ; but then there is Avenel 's body of reserve . Yes , the election is virtually over . When we get back , Hazeldean will have arrived with the money for the purchase of my ancestral property ; Dr. Riccabocca is already restored to the estates and titles of Serrano ; what do I care further for Lord L'Estrange ? Still , I do not like his look . "
528046	528110	528163	528163	his	502	" Pooh , you have done just what he wished . I am forbidden to say more . Here we are at the booth . A new placard since we left . How are the numbers ? Avenel forty ahead of you ; you thirty above Egerton ; and Leonard Fairfield still last on the poll . But where are Avenel and Fairfield ? "
528169	528376	528383	528391	all the assembly , as with a single voice	14057	" Gentlemen , it is in our hands to return one of our candidates , and to make our own choice between the two . You have heard Mr. Leslie and Baron Levy . To their statement I make but this reply , - Mr. Egerton is needed by the country ; and whatever his health or his affairs , he is ready to respond to that call . If he has not canvassed , if he does not appear before you at this moment , the services of more than twenty years plead for him in his stead . Which , then , of the two candidates do you choose as your member , - a renowned statesman , or a beardless boy ? Both have ambition and ability ; the one has identified those qualities with the history of a country , and as it is now alleged to his prejudice with a devotion that has broken a vigorous frame and injured a princely fortune . The other evinces his ambition by inviting you to prefer him to his benefactor , and proves his ability by the excuses he makes for ingratitude . Choose between the two , - an Egerton or a Leslie . "
528377	528381	528405	528411	a grave and prudent Committee - man	14058	" Egerton forever ! "
528400	528403	528405	528411	a grave and prudent Committee - man	14058	" But , "
528413	528435	528486	528486	himself	450	" have we really the choice ? Does not that rest with the Yellows ? Is not your Lordship too sanguine ? "
528436	528461	528486	528486	himself	450	" Open that door behind ; a deputation from our opponents waits in the room on the other side the passage . Admit them . "
528508	528537	528538	528538	LEONARD	450	" You have a proposition to make to us , Mr. Fairfield , on behalf of yourself and Mr. Avenel , and with the approval of your Committee ? "
528545	528617	528626	528628	the excited Blues	14063	" I have . We are convinced that neither party can carry both its candidates . Mr. Avenel is safe . The only question is , which of the two candidates on your side it best becomes the honour of this constituency to select . My resignation , which I am about to tender , will free sufficient votes to give the triumph either to Mr. Egerton or to Mr. Leslie . "
528618	528622	528638	528638	Leonard	450	" Egerton forever ! "
528630	528636	528638	528638	Leonard	450	" Yes , Egerton forever ! "
528647	528841	528851	528851	Leonard	450	" We may differ from his politics , but who can tell us those of Mr. Leslie ? We may differ from the politician , but who would not feel proud of the senator ? A great and incalculable advantage is bestowed on that constituency which returns to parliament a distinguished man . His distinction ennobles the place he represents , it sustains public spirit , it augments the manly interest in all that affects the nation . Every time his voice hushes the assembled parliament , it reminds us of our common country ; and even the discussion amongst his constituents which his voice provokes , clears their perceptions of the public interest , and enlightens themselves , from the intellect which commands their interests , and compels their attention . Egerton , then , forever ! If our party must subscribe to the return of one opponent , let all unite to select the worthiest . My Lord L'Estrange , when I quit this room , it will be to announce my resignation , and to solicit those who have promised me their votes to transfer them to Mr. Audley Egerton . "
528857	528888	528894	528894	Harley	503	" My Lord , I have obeyed your wishes , as conveyed to me by my uncle , who is engaged at this moment elsewhere in carrying them into effect . "
528889	528892	528894	528894	Harley	503	" Leonard , "
528901	528977	528986	528986	his	503	" you have insured to Audley Egerton what you alone could do , - the triumph over a perfidious dependent , the continuance of the sole career in which he has hitherto found the solace or the zest of life . He must thank you with his own lips . Come to the Park after the close of the poll . There and then shall the explanations yet needful to both be given and received . "
528989	529066	529189	529189	Levy	1175	" Gentlemen , yesterday , at the nomination of the candidates , I uttered remarks that have justly pained Mr. Fairfield . In your presence I wholly retract and frankly apologize for them . In your presence I entreat his forgiveness , and say , that if he will accord me his friendship , I will place him in my esteem and affection side by side with the statesman whom he has given to his country . "
529176	529187	529189	529189	Levy	1175	" Not two - thirds of the constituency will poll , "
529196	529273	529286	529286	Randal	570	" The thing is decided . Aha , Audley Egerton ! you who once tortured me with the unspeakable jealousy that bequeaths such implacable hate ; you who scorned my society , and called me ' scoundrel , ' disdainful of the very power your folly placed within my hands , - aha , your time is up ! and the spirit that administered to your own destruction strides within the circle to seize its prey ! "
529274	529284	529286	529286	Randal	570	" You shall have my first frank , Levy , "
529288	529319	529330	529330	Levy	1175	" to enclose your letter to Mr. Thornhill 's solicitor . This affair of the election is over ; we must now look to what else rests on our hands . "
529320	529328	529409	529409	Randal	570	" What the devil is that placard ? "
529400	529407	529427	529427	Levy	1175	" What infernal treachery is this ? "
529416	529425	529578	529578	Dick	643	" Wait a moment ; there is Avenel ! "
529571	529576	529578	529578	Dick	643	" Freemen and electors ! "
529586	529721	529725	529726	the mob	14086	" finding that the public opinion of this independent and enlightened constituency is so evenly divided , that only one Yellow candidate can be returned , and only one Blue has a chance , it was my intention last night to retire from the contest , and thus put an end to all bickerings and ill - blood Hold your tongues there , ca n't you ! . I say honestly , I should have preferred the return of my distinguished and talented young nephew - honourable relation - to my own ; but he would not hear of it , and talked all our Committee into the erroneous but high - minded notion , that the town would cry shame if the nephew rode into parliament by breaking the back of the uncle . "
529732	529739	529759	529759	Dick	643	" We 'll have you both ! "
529740	529757	529759	529759	Dick	643	" You 'll do no such thing , and you know it ; hold your jaw , "
529767	529876	529886	529887	the baron	17518	" Let me go on , ca n't you ? - time presses . In a word , my nephew resolved to retire , if , at two o'clock this day , there was no chance of returning both of us ; and there is none . Now , then , the next thing for the Yellows who have not yet voted , is to consider how they will give their second votes . If I had been the man to retire , why , for certain reasons , I should have recommended them to split with Leslie , - a clever chap , and pretty considerable sharp . "
529877	529884	529759	529759	Dick	643	" Hear , hear , hear ! "
529891	529941	529947	529948	the baron	17518	" But I 'm bound to say that my nephew has an opinion of his own , - as an independent Britisher , let him be twice your nephew , ought to have ; and his opinion goes the other way , and so does that of our Committee . "
529942	529945	529759	529759	Dick	643	" Sold ! "
529974	530066	530127	530127	Dick	643	" Sold ! Pretty fellow you with the nosegay in your buttonhole to talk of selling ! You who wanted to sell your own client , - and you know it . Levy recoiled . Why , gentlemen , that 's Levy the Jew , who talks of selling ! And if he asperses the character of this constituency , I stand here to defend it ! And there stands the parish pump , with a handle for the arm of Honesty , and a spout for the lips of Falsehood ! "

530134	530334	530101	530103	some frowning Yellows	14093	" SOLD ! the word rang through the place like the blast of a trumpet Sold ! No , believe me , not a man who votes for Egerton instead of Fairfield will , so far as I am concerned , be a penny the better - chilling silence - or with a scarce perceivable wink towards the anxious faces of the Hundred and Fifty who filled the background - or a penny the worse . Loud cheers from the Hundred and Fifty , and cries of ' Noble ! ' I do n't like the politics of Mr. Egerton . But I am not only a politician , - I am a MAN ! The arguments of our respected Committee - persons in business , tender husbands , and devoted fathers - have weight with me . I myself am a husband and a father . If a needless contest be prolonged to the last , with all the irritations it engenders , who suffer ? - why , the tradesman and the operative . Partiality , loss of custom , tyrannical demands for house rent , notices to quit , - in a word , the screw ! "
530335	530340	530101	530103	some frowning Yellows	14093	" Hear , hear ! "
530342	530348	530101	530103	some frowning Yellows	14093	" Give us the Ballot ! "
530349	530565	530101	530103	some frowning Yellows	14093	" The Ballot - with all my heart , if I had it about me ! And if we had the Ballot , I should like to see a man dare to vote Blue . Loud cheers from the Yellows . But , as we have not got it , we must think of our families . And I may add , that though Mr. Egerton may come again into office , yet added Dick solemnly I will do my best , as his colleague , to keep him straight ; and your own enlightenment for the schoolmaster is abroad will show him that no minister can brave public opinion , nor quarrel with his own bread and butter . Much cheering . In these times the aristocracy must endear themselves to the middle and working class ; and a member in office has much to give away in the Stamps and Excise , in the Customs , the Post Office , and other State departments in this rotten old - I mean this magnificent empire , by which he can benefit his constituents , and reconcile the prerogatives of aristocracy with the claims of the people , - more especially in this case , the people of the borough of Lausmere . Hear , hear !

Not that I presume to dictate , or express a wish one way or the other ; only , as a Family Man , I say to you , Electors and Freemen , having served your country in returning me , you have nobly won the right to think of the little ones at home .

531830	531844	532275	532275	Randal	570	" That Richard Avenel , whom I trusted , could so deceive me ! "
532282	532287	532591	532591	his	500	" repayment of expenses . "
532601	532604	532791	532791	Levy	1175	" ingratitude , "
532783	532789	532791	532791	Levy	1175	" I ca n't account , "
532793	532866	532778	532779	the baron	17518	" for what has gone so cross in this confounded election . It is L'Estrange that puzzles me ; but I know that he hates Egerton . I know that he will prove that hate by one mode of revenge , if he has lost it in another . But it is well , Randal , that you are secure of Hazeldean 's money and the rich heiress 's hand ; otherwise - "
532867	532872	532791	532791	Levy	1175	" Otherwise , what ? "
532873	532988	533034	533035	the servant	3272	" I should wash my hands of you , mon cher ; for , in spite of all your cleverness , and all I have tried to do for you , somehow or other I begin to suspect that your talents will never secure your fortune . A carpenter 's son beats you in public speaking , and a vulgar mill - owner tricks you in private negotiation . Decidedly , as yet , Randal Leslie , you are - a failure . And , as you so admirably said , ' a man from whom we have nothing to hope or fear we must blot out of the map of the future . ' "
533005	533029	533190	533190	himself	1498	" My Lord is in the saloon , and requests you and Mr. Leslie will do him the honour to join him there . "
533209	533318	533187	533188	the squire	1498	" Cheer up , my boy ; ' t is no shame to be beaten . Lord L'Estrange says you did your best to win , and man can do no more . And I 'm glad , Leslie , that we do n't meet for our little business till the election is over ; for , after annoyance , something pleasant is twice as acceptable . I 've the money in my pocket . Hush ! and I say , my dear , dear boy , I can not find out where Frank is , but it is really all off with that foreign woman , eh ? "
533319	533352	533369	533370	the squire	1498	" Yes , indeed , sir , I hope so . I 'll talk to you about it when we can be alone . We may slip away presently , I trust . "
533353	533367	533369	533370	the squire	1498	" I 'll tell you a secret scheme of mine and Harry 's , "
533378	533498	533369	533370	the squire	1498	" We , must drive that marchioness , or whatever she is , out of the boy 's head , and put a pretty English girl into it instead . That will settle him in life too . And I must try and swallow that bitter pill of the post - obit . Harry makes worse of it than I do , and is so hard on the poor fellow that I 've been obliged to take his part . I 've no idea of being under petticoat government , it is not the way with the Hazeldeans . Well , but to come back to the point : Whom do you think I mean by the pretty girl ? "
533499	533503	533369	533370	the squire	1498	" Miss Sticktorights ? "
533504	533585	533751	533751	his	12234	" Zounds , no ! - your own little sister , Randal . Sweet pretty face ! Harry liked her from the first , and then you 'll be Frank 's brother , and your sound head and good heart will keep him right . And as you are going to be married too you must tell me all about that later , why , we shall have two marriages , perhaps , in the family on the same day . "
533762	533793	533801	533802	the duke	15449	" Who could ever count on popular caprice ? The wise of all ages had despised it . In that respect , Horace and Machiavelli were of the same mind , "
533796	533799	533870	533871	the Italian	1688	" But , "
533807	533868	533870	533871	the Italian	1688	" perhaps your very misfortune here may serve you elsewhere . The female heart is prone to pity , and ever eager to comfort . Besides , if I am recalled to Italy , you will have leisure to come with us , and see the land where , of all others , ambition can be most readily forgotten , even "
533876	533883	533931	533931	his	1175	" even by her own sons ! "
533949	533976	533995	533996	The baron	17518	" Well , my Lord , do you comprehend this conduct on the part of Richard Avenel ? He secure Egerton 's return ! - he ! "
533977	533994	533931	533931	his	1175	" What so natural , Baron Levy , - his own brother - in - law ? "
534004	534021	533931	533931	his	1175	" But how did he know that ? I never told him . I meant indeed - "
534022	534103	534113	534114	Baron Levy	1175	" Meant , perhaps , to shame Egerton 's pride at the last by publicly declaring his marriage with a shopkeeper 's daughter . A very good revenge still left to you ; but revenge for what ? A word with you , now , Baron , that our acquaintance is about to close forever . You know why I have cause for resentment against Egerton . I do but suspect yours ; will you make it clear to me ? "
534104	534111	534113	534114	Baron Levy	1175	" My Lord , my Lord , "
534116	534191	534220	534220	himself	1175	" I , too , wooed Nora Avenel as my wife ; I , too , had a happier rival in the haughty worldling who did not appreciate his own felicity ; I too - in a word , some women inspire an affection that mingles with the entire being of a man , and is fused with all the currents of his life - blood . Nora Avenel was one of those women . "
534222	534266	534192	534192	Harley	503	" But our revenge is not baffled yet . Egerton , if not already in my power , is still in yours . His election may save him from arrest , but the law has other modes of public exposure and effectual ruin . "
534267	534324	534347	534347	Levy	1175	" For the knave , yes , - as I intimated to you in your own house , - you who boast of your love to Nora Avenel , and know in your heart that you were her destroyer ; you who witnessed her marriage , and yet dared to tell her that she was dishonoured ! "
534325	534345	534362	534362	Harley	503	" My Lord - I - how could you know - I mean , how think that - that - "
534351	534360	534362	534362	Harley	503	" Nora Avenel has spoken from her grave , "
534366	534381	534392	534392	Levy	1175	" Learn that , wherever man commits a crime , Heaven finds a witness ! "
534382	534390	534392	534392	Levy	1175	" It is on me , then , "
534403	534440	534362	534362	Harley	503	" on me that you now concentre your vengeance ; and I must meet it as I may . But I have fulfilled my part of our compact . I have obeyed you implicitly - and - "
534441	534459	534474	534475	the usurer	9106	" I will fulfil my part of our bond , and leave you undisturbed in your wealth . "
534460	534472	534515	534515	himself	503	" I knew I might trust to your Lordship 's honour , "
534481	534511	534521	534521	he	503	" And this vile creature nursed the same passions as myself ; and but yesterday we were partners in the same purpose , and influenced by the same thought ! "
534517	534520	534521	534521	he	503	" Yes , "
534525	534642	534662	534662	he	503	" I dare not , Baron Levy , constitute myself your judge . Pursue your own path , - all roads meet at last before the common tribunal . But you are not yet released from our compact ; you must do some good in spite of yourself . Look yonder , where Randal Leslie stands , smiling secure , between the two dangers he has raised up for himself . And as Randal Leslie himself has invited me to be his judge , and you are aware that he cited yourself this very day as his witness , here I must expose the guilty ; for here the innocent still live , and need defence . "
534655	534660	534662	534662	he	503	" I have wished , "
534668	534731	534732	534733	The squire	1498	" to connect with the triumph of my earliest and dearest friend the happiness of others in whose welfare I feel an interest . To you , Alphonso , Duke of Serrano , I now give this despatch , received last evening by a special messenger from the Prince Von - - - , announcing your restoration to your lands and honours . "
534739	534759	534814	534814	Harley	503	" Rickeybockey a duke ? Why , Jemima 's a duchess ! Bless me , she is actually crying ! "
534804	534812	534814	534814	Harley	503	" And you , Mr. Randal Leslie , "
534816	534932	534945	534945	Randal	570	" though you have lost your election , see before you at this moment such prospects of wealth and happiness , that I shall only have to offer you congratulations to which those that greet Mr. Audley Egerton may well appear lukewarm and insipid , provided you prove that you have not forfeited the right to claim that promise which the Duke di Serrano has accorded to the suitor of his daughter 's hand . Some doubts resting on my mind , you have volunteered to dispel them . I have the duke 's permission to address to you a few questions , and I now avail myself of your offer to reply to them . "
534933	534943	534945	534945	Randal	570	" Now , - and here , my Lord ? "
534962	535004	535088	535089	the squire	1498	" Now , - and here . Nor are those present so strange to your explanations as your question would imply . Mr. Hazeldean , it so happens that much of what I shall say to Mr. Leslie concerns your son . "
535017	535040	535069	535069	he	15449	" My son ! Frank ? Oh , then , of course , Randal will speak out . Speak , my boy ! "
535059	535067	535069	535069	he	15449	" Young man , can you hesitate ? "
535071	535081	535088	535089	the squire	1498	" A doubt is expressed which involves your honour . "
535082	535086	535088	535089	the squire	1498	" 's death ! "
535102	535109	535115	535115	Randal	570	" what are you afraid of ? "
535110	535113	535115	535115	Randal	570	" Afraid ! "
535127	535146	535088	535089	the squire	1498	" afraid ? - I ? What of ? I was only wondering what Lord L'Estrange could mean . "
535147	535221	535230	535231	the squire	1498	" I will dispel that wonder at once . Mr. Hazeldean , your son displeased you first by his proposals of marriage to the Marchesa di Negra against your consent ; secondly , by a post - obit bond granted to Baron Levy . Did you understand from Mr. Randal Leslie that he had opposed or favoured the said marriage , - that he had countenanced or blamed the said post - obit ? "
535222	535228	535230	535231	the squire	1498	" Why , of course , "
535233	535245	535088	535089	the squire	1498	" that he had opposed both the one and the other . "
535246	535254	535281	535281	He	1498	" Is it so , Mr. Leslie ? "
535255	535280	535283	535283	himself	1498	" My Lord - I - I - my affection for Frank , and my esteem for his respected father - I - I - "
535292	535322	535088	535089	the squire	1498	" Of course , I did all I could to dissuade Frank from the marriage ; and as to the post - obit , I know nothing about it . "
535323	535452	535522	535522	her	800	" So much at present for this matter . I pass on to the graver one , that affects your engagement with the Duke di Serrano 's daughter . I understand from you , Duke , that to save your daughter from the snares of Count di Peschiera , and in the belief that Mr. Leslie shared in your dread of the count 's designs , you , while in exile and in poverty , promised to that gentleman your daughter 's hand ? When the probabilities of restoration to your principalities seemed well - nigh certain , you confirmed that promise on learning from Mr. Leslie that he had , however ineffectively , struggled to preserve your heiress from a perfidious snare . Is it not so ? "
535453	535510	535567	535567	Harley	503	" Certainly . Had I succeeded to a throne , I could not recall the promise that I had given in penury and banishment ; I could not refuse to him who would have sacrificed worldly ambition in wedding a penniless bride , the reward of his own generosity . My daughter subscribes to my views . "
535557	535565	535567	535567	Harley	503	" Your answer becomes you , Duke , "
535569	535631	535644	535645	the duke	15449	" But should it be proved that Mr. Leslie , instead of wooing the princess for herself , actually calculated on the receipt of money for transferring her to Count Peschiera ; instead of saving her from the dangers you dreaded , actually suggested the snare from which she was delivered , - would you still deem your honour engaged to - "
535632	535642	535644	535645	the duke	15449	" Such a villain ? No , surely not ! "
535647	535659	535678	535678	Randal	570	" But this is a groundless hypothesis ! Speak , Randal . "
535660	535676	535644	535645	the duke	15449	" Lord L'Estrange can not insult me by deeming it otherwise than a groundless hypothesis ! "
535686	535702	535712	535712	Randal	570	" I understand then , Mr. Leslie , that you scornfully reject such a supposition ? "
535703	535710	535644	535645	the duke	15449	" Scornfully - yes . And , "
535760	535760	535776	535777	the squire	1498	"
535761	535774	535776	535777	the squire	1498	" That 's the first word you have spoken like a man , "
535779	535801	535810	535810	Harley	503	" I have stood my ground myself for a less cause . I have had a ball through my right shoulder . "
535802	535808	535810	535810	Harley	503	" Your demand is just , "
535814	535829	535995	535996	the count	18827	" I can not give the retractation , - I will produce the proof . "
535988	535993	535995	535996	the count	18827	" Duke di Serrano , "
536026	536087	536197	536198	The count	18827	" I returned to England on the receipt of a letter from my Lord L'Estrange , and with a view , it is true , of claiming at his hands the satisfaction which men of our birth accord to each other , where affront , from what cause soever , has been given or received . Nay , fair kinswoman , "
536112	536196	536230	536230	he	18827	" that intention is abandoned . If I have adopted too lightly the old courtly maxim , that ' all stratagems are fair in love , ' I am bound also to yield to my Lord L'Estrange 's arguments , that the counter - stratagems must be fair also . And , after all , it becomes me better to laugh at my own sorry figure in defeat , than to confess myself gravely mortified by an ingenuity more successful than my own . "
536225	536229	536230	536230	he	18827	" Ma foi ! "
536233	536305	536311	536312	the parson	1499	" it is permitted me to speak thus , since at least I have given proofs of my indifference to danger , and my good fortune when exposed to it . Within the last six years I have had the honour to fight nine duels , and the regret to wound five , and dismiss from the world four , as gallant and worthy gentlemen as ever the sun shone upon . "
536306	536309	536364	536365	the count	18827	" Monster ! "
536359	536362	536364	536365	the count	18827	" But , "
536375	536458	536466	536466	Harley	503	" I have to thank my Lord L'Estrange for reminding me that a man whose courage is above suspicion is privileged not only to apologize if he has injured another , but to accompany apology with atonement . Duke of Serrano , it is for that purpose that I am here . My Lord , you have signified your wish to ask me some questions of serious import as regards the duke and his daughter ; I will answer them without reserve . "
536459	536464	536466	536466	Harley	503	" Monsieur le Comte , "
536468	536495	536364	536365	the count	18827	" availing myself of your courtesy , I presume to inquire who informed you that this young lady was a guest under my father 's roof ? "
536496	536518	536526	536527	the baron	17518	" My informant stands yonder , - Mr. Randal Leslie ; and I call upon Baron Levy to confirm my statement . "
536519	536524	536364	536365	the count	18827	" It is true , "
536559	536579	536591	536592	The baron	17518	" And was Mr. Leslie acquainted with your project for securing the person and hand of your young kinswoman ? "
536580	536590	536591	536592	The baron	17518	" Certainly , - and Baron Levy knows it . "
536596	536677	536855	536855	he	570	" Permit me to add - for it is due to a lady nearly related to myself - that it was , as I have since learned , certain erroneous representations made to her by Mr. Leslie which alone induced that lady , after my own arguments had failed , to lend her aid to a project which otherwise she would have condemned as strongly as , Duke di Serrano , I now with unfeigned sincerity do myself condemn it . "
536863	536957	536980	536981	the duke	15449	" A charge so sudden may well - may well confound me . But - but - who can credit it ? Both the law and commonsense pre - suppose some motive for a criminal action ; what could be my motive here ? I - myself the suitor for the hand of the duke 's daughter - I betray her ! Absurd - absurd ! Duke , Duke , I put it to your own knowledge of mankind whoever goes thus against his own interest - and - and his own heart ? "
536973	536978	536980	536981	the duke	15449	" That is true , "
536989	536995	537001	537001	Harley	503	" I see no motive . "
536996	536999	537001	537001	Harley	503	" Perhaps , "
537003	537034	537050	537050	he	1175	" Baron Levy may here enlighten us . Do you know of any motive of self - interest that could have actuated Mr. Leslie in assisting the count 's schemes ? "
537045	537048	537050	537050	he	1175	" Pardieu ! "
537061	537138	537148	537149	the baron	17518	" pardieu ! I can have no doubt thrown on my assertion , least of all by those who know of its truth ; and I call upon you , Baron Levy , to state whether , in case of my marriage with the duke 's daughter , I had not agreed to present my sister with a sum , to which she alleged some ancient claim , and which would have passed through your hands ? "
537139	537146	537050	537050	he	1175	" Certainly , that is true , "
537151	537165	537177	537178	the count	18827	" And would Mr. Leslie have benefited by any portion of that sum ? "
537170	537175	537189	537190	the baron	17518	" Speak , sir , "
537182	537187	537189	537190	the baron	17518	" The fact is , "
537192	537248	537256	537257	the squire	1498	" that Mr. Leslie was anxious to complete a purchase of certain estates that had once belonged to his family , and that the count 's marriage with the signora , and his sister 's marriage with Mr. Hazeldean , would have enabled me to accommodate Mr. Leslie with a loan to effect that purchase . "
537249	537254	537270	537270	he	1498	" What ! what ! "
537279	537313	537326	537327	the count	18827	" my son 's marriage ! You lent yourself to that , too ? Do n't look so like a lashed hound ! Speak out like a man , if man you be ! "
537314	537324	537326	537327	the count	18827	" Lent himself to that , my good sir ! "
537329	537349	537360	537361	the squire	1498	" Do you suppose that the Marchesa di Negra could have condescended to an alliance with a Mr. Hazeldean - "
537350	537358	537377	537378	the count	18827	" Condescended ! a Hazeldean of Hazeldean ! "
537372	537375	537473	537474	Mr. Hazeldean	449	" Unless , "
537488	537488	537503	537503	his	1498	"
537489	537497	537514	537515	The baron	17518	" Mode ! the post - obit ! "
537520	537543	537590	537590	he	445	" Any friend of Mr. Frank Hazeldean 's would have recommended the same , as the most economical mode of raising money . "
537603	537623	537630	537630	Harley	503	" Look , look at that countenance ! - and one so young ! Spare him , spare him ! "
537624	537628	537630	537630	Harley	503	" Mr. Leslie , "
537636	537673	537679	537680	the count	18827	" believe me that nothing short of justice to the Duke di Serrano - justice even to my young friend Mr. Hazeldean - has compelled me to this painful duty . Here let all inquiry terminate . "
537674	537677	537762	537763	Mr. Leslie	570	" And , "
537767	537767	537781	537781	he	1499	"
537768	537773	538027	538028	the parson	1499	" Peace , homicide , "
538053	538090	538096	538097	the count	18827	" It is not a personal conflict with the Count di Peschiera that can vindicate my honour ; and I disdain to defend myself against the accusations of a usurer , and of a mam who - "
538091	538094	538110	538110	Randal	570	" Monsieur ! "
538103	538108	538113	538113	he	570	" A man who , "
538117	538153	538161	538162	the count	18827	" by his own confession , was himself guilty of all the schemes in which he would represent me as his accomplice , and who now , not clearing himself , would yet convict another - "
538154	538159	538161	538162	the count	18827	" Cher petit monsieur ! "
538171	538377	538383	538383	Randal	570	" when men like me make use of men like you , we reward them for a service if rendered , or discard them if the service be not done ; and if I condescend to confess and apologize for any act I have committed , surely Mr. Randal Leslie might do the same without disparagement to his dignity . But I should never , sir , have taken the trouble to appear against you , had you not , as I learn , pretended to the hand of the lady whom I had hoped , with less presumption , to call my bride ; and in this , how can I tell that you have not tricked and betrayed me ? Is there anything in our past acquaintance that warrants me to believe that , instead of serving me , you sought but to serve yourself ? Be that as it may , I had but one mode of repairing to the head of my house the wrongs I have done him , and that was by saving his daughter from a derogatory alliance with an impostor who had abetted my schemes for hire , and who now would filch for himself their fruit . "
538378	538381	538391	538391	Randal	570	" Duke ! "
538399	538415	538385	538386	The duke	15449	" Mr. Hazeldean - what ? you , too , condemn me , and unheard ? "
538416	538439	538458	538458	Randal	570	" Unheard ! - zounds , no ! If you have anything to say , speak truth , and shame the devil . "
538440	538456	538458	538458	Randal	570	" I abet Frank 's marriage ! I sanction the post - obit ! Oh ! "
538465	538473	538498	538498	Harley	503	" if Frank himself were but here ! "
538483	538497	538523	538524	the squire	1498	" You wish for the presence of Frank Hazeldean ? It is just . "
538514	538521	538614	538614	Levy	1175	" My son ! my son ! "
538627	538670	538715	538715	Levy	1175	" I could not help it , - you would have done the same by me . You see you have failed in everything ; and when a man fails completely , we both agreed that we must give him up altogether . "
538705	538713	538715	538715	Levy	1175	" But he was of some use , "
538717	538734	538735	538736	The count	18827	" His treachery and his exposure will gall the childless Egerton . Some little revenge still ! "
538745	538756	538735	538736	The count	18827	" J'ai bien joue mon role , n'est ce pas ? "
538769	538788	538735	538736	The count	18827	" Your part ! Ah , but , my dear count , I do not quite understand it . "
538789	538855	538735	538736	The count	18827	" Ma foi , you are passably dull . I had just been landed in France , when a letter from L'Estrange reached me . It was couched as an invitation , which I interpreted to - the duello . Such invitations I never refuse . I replied : I came hither , took my lodgings at an inn . My Lord seeks me last night .
538856	539046	539057	539057	Levy	1175	" I begin in the tone you may suppose . Pardieu ! he is clever , milord ! He shows me a letter from the Prince Von - - - , Alphonse 's recall , my own banishment . He places before me , but with admirable suavity , the option of beggary and ruin , or an honourable claim on Alphonso 's gratitude . And as for that petit monsieur , do you think I could quietly contemplate my own tool 's enjoyment of all I had lost myself ? Nay , more , if that young Harpagon were Alphonso 's son - inlaw , could the duke have a whisperer at his ear more fatal to my own interests ? To be brief , I saw at a glance my best course . I have adopted it . The difficulty was to extricate myself as became a man de sang et de jeu . If I have done so , congratulate me . Alphonso has taken my hand , and I now leave it to him to attend to my fortunes , and clear up my repute . "
539047	539055	539057	539057	Levy	1175	" If you are going to London , "
539059	539117	539126	539127	the count	18827	" my carriage , ere this , must be at the door , and I shall be proud to offer you a seat , and converse with you on your prospects . But , peste , mon cher , your fall has been from a great height , and any other man would have broken his bones . "
539118	539124	539126	539127	the count	18827	" Strength is ever light , "
539131	539144	539186	539186	he	503	" and it does not fall ; it leaps down and rebounds . "
539175	539184	539186	539186	he	503	" I have kept my promise to you , "
539195	539204	539210	539210	Violante	800	" Are you still so severe on me ? "
539205	539208	539210	539210	Violante	800	" Ah , "
539231	539277	539349	539350	the duke	15449	" I have heard from Mr. Dale that you have achieved a conquest over yourself , which makes me ashamed to think that I presumed to doubt how your heart would speak when a moment of wrath though of wrath so just had passed away . "
539278	539329	539210	539210	Violante	800	" No , Violante , do not acquit me yet ; witness my revenge for I have not foregone it , and then let my heart speak , and breathe its prayer that the angel voice , which it now beats to hear , may still be its guardian monitor . "
539330	539335	539365	539365	Harley	503	" What is this ? "
539371	539379	539349	539350	the duke	15449	" Am I to understand that you - "
539380	539398	539406	539407	the sage	3893	" Have freed you from one suitor for this dear hand , to become myself your petitioner ! "
539399	539404	539406	539407	the sage	3893	" Corpo di Bacco ! "
539413	539451	539499	539500	the duke	15449	" this , indeed , is joyful news . But I must not again make a rash pledge , - not again force my child 's inclinations . And Violante ; you see , is running away . "
539494	539497	539499	539500	the duke	15449	" There , "
539511	539564	539581	539581	Harley	503	" I do n't think I shall hear much more of the convent ; but anything of this sort I never suspected . If there be a language in the world for which there is no lexicon nor grammar , it is that which a woman thinks in , but never speaks . "
539565	539579	539499	539500	the duke	15449	" It is all that is left of the language spoken in paradise , "
539583	539596	539499	539500	the duke	15449	" In the dialogue between Eve and the serpent , - yes , "
539602	539613	539640	539640	Peschiera	1132	" But who comes here ? - our friend Leonard . "
539635	539638	539640	539640	Peschiera	1132	" Milord , "
539646	539757	539810	539810	He	18827	" I have fulfilled my promise , and I will now leave your roof . Baron Levy returns to London , and offers me a seat in his carriage , which is already , I believe , at your door . The duke and his daughter will readily forgive me if I do not ceremoniously bid them farewell . In our altered positions , it does not become me too intrusively to claim kindred ; it became me only to remove , as I trust I have done , a barrier against the claim . If you approve my conduct , you will state your own opinion to the duke . "
539786	539809	539832	539832	Levy	1175	" Remember only , my Lord , that I solicit nothing . I may allow myself to accept , - voilia tout . "
539844	539908	539915	539915	Harley	503	" Your Lordship will explain to Mr. Egerton how his adopted son deserved his esteem , and repaid his kindness . For the rest , though you have bought up the more pressing and immediate demands on Mr. Egerton , I fear that even your fortune will not enable you to clear those liabilities which will leave him , perhaps , a pauper ! "
539909	539913	539915	539915	Harley	503	" Baron Levy , "
539919	539947	540269	540270	The baron	17518	" if I have forgiven Mr. Egerton , can not you too forgive ? Me he has wronged ; you have wronged him , and more foully . "
539948	540268	540269	540270	The baron	17518	" No , my Lord , I can not forgive him . You he has never humiliated , you he has never employed for his wants , and scorned as his companion . You have never known what it is to start in life with one whose fortunes were equal to your own , whose talents were not superior . Look you , Lord L'Estrange , in spite of this difference between me and Egerton , that he has squandered the wealth that he gained without effort , while I have converted the follies of others into my own ample revenues , the spendthrift in his penury has the respect and position which millions can not bestow upon me . You would say that I am an usurer , and he is a statesman . But do you know what I should have been , had I not been born the natural son of a peer ? Can you guess what I should have been if Nora Avenel had been my wife ? The blot on my birth , and the blight on my youth , and the knowledge that he who was rising every year into the rank which entitled him to reject me as a guest at his table - he whom the world called the model of a gentleman - was a coward and a liar to the friend of his youth , - all this made me look on the world with contempt ; and , despising Audley Egerton , I yet hated him and envied . You , whom he wronged , stretch your hand as before to the great statesman ; from my touch you would shrink as pollution . My Lord , you may forgive him whom you love and pity ; I can not forgive him whom I scorn and envy . Pardon my prolixity . I now quit your house . "
540287	540331	540371	540371	Harley	503	" But you will tell Mr. Egerton how I helped to expose the son he adopted ! I thought of the childless man when your Lordship imagined I was but in fear of your threats . Ha ! ha ! that will sting . "
540364	540369	540405	540405	He	503	" Who can judge , "
540373	540404	540457	540457	he	503	" through what modes retribution comes home to the breast ? That man is chastised in his wealth , ever gnawed by desire for what his wealth can not buy ! "
540452	540455	540457	540457	he	503	" Leonard , "
540461	540469	540585	540585	He	500	" your hour is come at last . "
540606	540635	540966	540966	Harley	503	" Before the night you shall embrace your son . Do not join us below when I return . Keep calm , - we will come to you . "
540961	540964	540966	540966	Harley	503	" Friend , "
540968	541059	541067	541067	Egerton	500	" I give to you a son proved in adversity , and who has fought his own way to fame . Leonard , in the man to whom I prayed you to sacrifice your own ambition , of whom you have spoken with such worthy praise , whose career of honour you have promoted , and whose life , unsatisfied by those honours , you will soothe with your filial love , behold the husband of Nora Avenel ! Kneel to your father ! O Audley , embrace your son ! "
541060	541065	541101	541101	His	500	" Here , here ! "
541076	541100	541120	541120	Harley	503	" here to my heart ! Look at me with those eyes ! - kindly , forgivingly : they are your mother 's ! "
541111	541118	541120	541120	Harley	503	" But this is not enough , "
541133	541187	541188	541188	Leonard	450	" You must open your heart for more . Take into its folds my sweet ward and daughter . What is a home without the smile of woman ? They have loved each other from children . Audley , yours be the hand to join , - yours be the lips to bless . "
541192	541229	541237	541237	Harley	503	" Oh , sir ! - oh , my father ! - this generous sacrifice may not be ; for he - he who has saved me for this surpassing joy - he too loves her ! "
541230	541235	541237	541237	Harley	503	" Nay , Leonard , "
541241	541332	541347	541348	the parson	1499	" I am not so neglectful of myself . Another home woos you , Audley . He whom you long so vainly sought to reconcile to life , exchanging mournful dreams for happy duties , - he , too , presents you to his bride . Love her for my sake , - for your own . She it is , not I , who presides over this hallowed reunion . But for her , I should have been a blinded , vindictive , guilty , repentant man ; and - "
541342	541345	541347	541348	the parson	1499	" Thus , "
541354	541412	541859	541860	Augustine Caxton	1455	" man finds that the Saviour 's precepts , ' Let not the sun go down upon thy wrath , ' and ' Love one another , ' are clews that conduct us through the labyrinth of human life , when the schemes of fraud and hate snap asunder , and leave us lost amidst the maze . "
541850	541857	542338	542339	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" But you have not done ? "
541865	541871	541872	541874	MR . CAXTON	409	" What remains to do ? "
541877	541906	541859	541860	Augustine Caxton	1455	" What ! why , the Final Chapter ! - the last news you can give us of those whom you have introduced to our liking or dislike . "
541910	541992	541993	541995	MR . CAXTON	409	" Surely it is more dramatic to close the work with a scene that completes the main design of the plot , and leave it to the prophetic imagination of all whose flattering curiosity is still not wholly satisfied , to trace the streams of each several existence , when they branch off again from the lake in which their waters converge , and by which the sibyl has confirmed and made clear the decree that ' Conduct is Fate . ' "
541998	542076	542077	542078	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" More dramatic , I grant ; but you have not written a drama . A novelist should be a comfortable , garrulous , communicative , gossiping fortune - teller ; not a grim , laconical , oracular sibyl . I like a novel that adopts all the old - fashioned customs prescribed to its art by the rules of the Masters , - more especially a novel which you style ' My Novel ' par emphasis . "
542081	542109	542110	542112	MR . SQUILLS	412	" A most vague and impracticable title ' My Novel ' ! It must really be changed before the work goes in due form to the public . "
542115	542337	542338	542339	CAPTAIN ROLAND	444	" Certainly the present title can not be even pronounced by many without inflicting a shock upon their nervous system . Do you think , for instance , that my friend , Lady Priscilla Graves - who is a great novel - reader indeed , but holds all female writers unfeminine deserters to the standard of Man - could ever come out with , ' Pray , sir , have you had time to look at - MY Novel ? ' - She would rather die first . And yet to be silent altogether on the latest acquisition to the circulating libraries would bring on a functional derangement of her ladyship 's organs of speech . Or how could pretty Miss Dulcet - all sentiment , it is true , but all bashful timidity - appall Captain Smirke from proposing with , ' Did not you think the parson 's sermon a little too dry in - MY Novel ' ? It will require a face of brass , or at least a long course of citrate of iron , before a respectable lady or unassuming young gentleman , with a proper dread of being taken for scribblers , could electrify a social circle with ' The reviewers do n't do justice to the excellent things in - My Novel . ' "
542342	542478	542479	542481	MR . CAXTON	409	" Awful consequences , indeed , may arise from the mistakes such a title gives rise to . Counsellor Digwell , for instance , a lawyer of literary tastes , but whose career at the Bar was long delayed by an unjust suspicion amongst the attorneys that he had written a ' Philosophical Essay ' - imagine such a man excusing himself for being late at a dinner of bigwigs , with ' I could not get away from - My Novel ! ' It would be his professional ruin ! I am not fond of lawyers in general , but still I would not be a party to taking the bread out of the mouth of those with a family ; and Digwell has children , - the tenth an innocent baby in arms . "
542484	543041	543042	543044	MR . SQUILLS	412	" As to Digwell in particular , and lawyers in general , they are too accustomed to circumlocution to expose themselves to the danger your kind heart apprehends ; but I allow that a shy scholar like myself , or a grave college tutor , might be a little put to the blush , if he were to blurt forth inadvertently with , ' Do n't waste your time over trash like - MY Novel . ' And that thought presents to us another and more pleasing view of this critical question . The title you condemn places the work under universal protection . Lives there a man or a woman so dead to self - love as to say , ' What contemptible stuff is - MY Novel ' ? Would he or she not rather be impelled by that strong impulse of an honourable and virtuous heart , which moves us to stand as well as we can with our friends , to say , ' Allow that there is really a good thing now and then in - My Novel . ' Moreover , as a novel aspires to embrace most of the interests or the passions that agitate mankind , - to generalize , as it were , the details of life that come home to us all , - so , in reality , the title denotes that if it be such as the author may not unworthily call his Novel , it must also be such as the reader , whoever he be , may appropriate in part to himself , representing his own ideas , expressing his own experience , reflecting , if not in full , at least in profile , his own personal identity . Thus , when we glance at the looking - glass in another man 's room , our likeness for the moment appropriates the mirror ; and according to the humour in which we are , or the state of our spirits and health , we say to ourselves , ' Bilious and yellow ! - I might as well take care of my diet ! ' Or , ' Well , I ' ve half a mind to propose to dear Jane ; I 'm not such an ill - looking dog as I thought for ! ' Still , whatever result from that glance at the mirror , we never doubt that ' t is our likeness we see ; and each says to the phantom reflection , ' Thou art myself , ' though the mere article of furniture that gives the reflection belongs to another . It is my likeness if it be his glass . And a narrative that is true to the Varieties of Life is every Man 's Novel , no matter from what shores , by what rivers , by what bays , in what pits , were extracted the sands and the silex , the pearlash , the nitre , and quicksilver which form its materials ; no matter who the craftsman who fashioned its form ; no matter who the vendor that sold , or the customer who bought : still , if I but recognize some trait of myself , ' t is my likeness that makes it ' My Novel . ' "
543052	543079	543080	543082	MR . CAXTON	409	" Subtle , sir , - very subtle . Fine organ of Comparison in Mr. Caxton 's head , and much called into play this evening ! "
543086	543147	543148	543148	PISISTRATUS	420	" Finally , the author by this most admirable and much signifying title dispenses with all necessity of preface . He need insinuate no merits , he need extenuate no faults ; for , by calling his work thus curtly ' MY Novel , ' he doth delicately imply that it is no use wasting talk about faults or merits . "
543152	543159	543160	543162	MR . CAXTON	409	" How is that , sir ? "
543165	543368	543369	543369	SQUILLS	412	" What so clear ? You imply that , though a better novel may be written by others , you do not expect to write a novel to which , taken as a novel , you would more decisively and unblushingly prefix that voucher of personal authorship and identity conveyed in the monosyllable ' My . ' And if you have written your best , let it be ever so bad , what can any man of candour and integrity require more from you ? Perhaps you will say that , if you had lived two thousand years ago , you might have called it ' The Novel , ' or the ' Golden Novel , ' as Lucius called his story ' The Ass ; ' and Apuleius , to distinguish his own more elaborate Ass from all Asses preceding it , called his tale ' The Golden Ass . ' But living in the present day , such a designation - implying a merit in general , not the partial and limited merit corresponding only with your individual abilities - would be presumptuous and offensive . True , I here anticipate the observation I see Squills is about to make - "
543372	543377	543378	543380	MR . CAXTON	409	" I , Sir ? "
543383	543548	543570	543570	he	412	" You would say that , as Scarron called his work of fiction ' The Comic Novel , ' so Pisistratus might have called his ' The Serious Novel , ' or ' The Tragic Novel . ' But , Squills , that title would not have been inviting nor appropriate , and would have been exposed to comparison with Scarron , who being dead is inimitable . Wherefore - to put the question on the irrefragable basis of mathematics - wherefore as A B ' My Novel ' is not equal to B C ' The Golden Novel , ' nor to D E ' The Serious or Tragic Novel , ' it follows that A B ' My Novel ' is equal to P C ' Pisistratus Caxton , ' and P C ' Pisistratus Caxton ' must therefore be just equal , neither more nor less , to A B ' My Novel , ' - which was to be demonstrated . "
543574	543610	543616	543617	the captain	2114	" And so now , ' non quieta movere , ' proceed with the Final Chapter , and tell us first what became of that youthful Giles Overreach , who was himself his own Marrall ? "
543611	543614	543616	543617	the captain	2114	" Ay , "
543619	543632	543638	543639	my father	1479	" what became of Randal Leslie ? Did he repent and reform ? "
543633	543636	543638	543639	my father	1479	" Nay , "
543649	543819	543820	543822	MR . SQUILLS	412	" you can regulate the warm tide of wild passion , you can light into virtue the dark errors of ignorance ; but where the force of the brain does but clog the free action of the heart , where you have to deal , not with ignorance misled , but intelligence corrupted , small hope of reform ; for reform here will need re - organization . I have somewhere read perhaps in Hebrew tradition that of the two orders of fallen spirits , - the Angels of Love and the Angels of Knowledge , - the first missed the stars they had lost , and wandered back through the darkness , one by one , into heaven ; but the last , lighted on by their own lurid splendours , said , ' Wherever we go , there is heaven ! ' And deeper and lower descending , lost their shape and their nature , till , deformed and obscene , the bottomless pit closed around them . "
543825	543849	543850	543852	MR . CAXTON	409	" I should not have thought , Mr. Caxton , that a book - man like you would be thus severe upon Knowledge . "
543857	544017	544018	544019	Mr. Squills	412	" Severe upon knowledge ! Oh , Squills , Squills , Squills ! Knowledge perverted is knowledge no longer . Vinegar , which , exposed to the sun , breeds small serpents , or at best slimy eels , not comestible , once was wine . If I say to my grandchildren , ' Do n't drink that sour stuff , which the sun itself fills with reptiles , ' does that prove me a foe to sound sherry ? Squills , if you had but received a scholastic education , you would know the wise maxim that saith , ' All things the worst are corruptions from things originally designed as the best . ' Has not freedom bred anarchy , and religion fanaticism ? And if I blame Marat calling for blood , or Dominic racking a heretic , am I severe on the religion that canonized Francis de Sales , or the freedom that immortalized Thrasybulus ? "
544042	544051	544052	544054	MR . CAXTON	409	" Enough , sir ; I am convinced ! "
544057	544317	544318	544320	MRS . CAXTON	440	" Moreover , I have thought it a natural stroke of art in Pisistratus to keep Randal Leslie , in his progress towards the rot of the intellect unwholesomely refined , free from all the salutary influences that deter ambition from settling into egotism . Neither in his slovenly home , nor from his classic tutor at his preparatory school , does he seem to have learned any truths , religious or moral , that might give sap to fresh shoots , when the first rank growth was cut down by the knife ; and I especially noted , as illustrative of Egerton , no less than of Randal , that though the statesman 's occasional hints of advice to his protege are worldly wise in their way , and suggestive of honour as befitting the creed of a gentleman , they are not such as much influence a shrewd reasoner like Randal , whom the example of the playground at Eton had not served to correct of the arid self - seeking , which looked to knowledge for no object but power . A man tempted by passions like Audley , or seduced into fraud by a cold , subtle spirit like Leslie , will find poor defence in the elegant precept , ' Remember to act as a gentleman . ' Such moral embroidery adds a beautiful scarf to one 's armour ; but it is not the armour itself ! Ten o'clock , as I live ! Push on , Pisistratus ! and finish the chapter . "
544324	544356	545723	545723	Oliver	612	" Do n't hurry . Begin with that odious Randal Leslie , to oblige your father ; but there are others whom Blanche and I care much more to hear about . "
545698	545722	545813	545816	the ' shabby genteel	14437	" Do n't you know me , Oliver ? I am your brother Randal ! Call away your dog and let me in . "
545818	545912	545942	545942	he	570	" His mien was that of the skulking , timorous , famished vagabond . As he took off his greasy tattered hat , he exhibited , though still young in years , the signs of premature old age . His hair , once so fine and silken , was of a harsh iron - gray , bald in ragged patches ; his forehead and visage were ploughed into furrows ; intelligence was still in the aspect , but an intelligence that instinctively set you on your guard , - sinister , gloomy , menacing .
545937	545940	545942	545942	he	570	" Poole , "
545944	545956	546009	546009	he	570	" have you nothing that warms a man better than this ? "
546004	546007	546009	546009	he	570	" Ah , "
546016	546025	546149	546149	Randal	570	" this comforts ; now give me food . "
546138	546145	546149	546149	Randal	570	" You would know my history ? "
546153	546180	546229	546229	Randal	570	" It is short . I have tried for fortune and failed , I am without a penny and without a hope . You seem poor , -
546181	546216	546458	546458	he	1815	" I suppose you can not much help me . Let me at least stay with you for a time , - I know not where else to look for bread and for shelter . "
546466	546530	546537	546537	Randal	570	" You see , my wife brought me nearly all I possess , and you do n't condescend to make friends with her . Your residence here must be as painful to you as to me . But I wish to see you provided for ; and I could offer you something , only it seems , at first glance , so beneath - "
546531	546535	546537	546537	Randal	570	" Beneath what ? "
546541	546554	546458	546458	he	1815	" What I was - or what I am ? Speak out ! "
546555	546604	546623	546623	Randal	570	" To be sure you are a scholar ; and I have heard you say fine things about knowledge and so forth ; and you 'll have plenty of books at your disposal , no doubt ; and you are still young , and may rise - and - "
546605	546621	546634	546635	poor Oliver	612	" Hell and torments ! Be quick , - say the worst or the best ! "
546627	546632	546634	546635	poor Oliver	612	" Well , then , "
546645	546760	546799	546799	He	570	" you must know that our poor sister 's husband was nephew to Dr. Felpem , who keeps a very respectable school . He is not learned himself , and attends chiefly to arithmetic and book - keeping , and such matters ; but he wants an usher to teach the classics , for some of the boys go to college . And I have written to him , just to sound - I did not mention your name till I knew if you would like it ; but he will take my recommendation . Board , lodging , L50 a year ; in short , the place is yours if you like it . "
546775	546798	546799	546799	He	570	" Well , be it so ; I have come to that . Ha , ha ! yes , knowledge is power ! "
546805	546912	547644	547644	he	570	" So , the old Hall is razed to the ground , and you are a tradesman in a small country town , and my sister is dead , and I henceforth am - John Smith ! You say that you did not mention my name to the schoolmaster , - still keep it concealed ; forget that I once was a Leslie . Our tie of brotherhood ceases when I go from your hearth . Write , then , to your head - master , who attends to arithmetic , and secure the rank of his usher in Latin and Greek for - John Smith ! "
547647	547652	547644	547644	he	570	" But to what end ?
547653	547670	548190	548190	he	1175	" I can never now raise a name . Why give reputation to - John Smith ? "

That was not very likely , for a few crowns were all we could find on the Englishman 's person , and he had been obliged to leave his lodgings for debt . He is recovering , but there is fever still . "

Neither sounding titles , nor wide lands , nor fine abilities , will give you real joy , unless you hold yourself responsible for all to your God and to your country ; and when you are tempted to believe that the gifts you may inherit from both entail no duties , or that duties are at war with true pleasure , remember how I placed you in your father 's arms , and said , ' Let him be as proud of you some day as I at this hour am of him .
