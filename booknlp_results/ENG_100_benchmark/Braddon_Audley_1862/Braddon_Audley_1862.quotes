3246	3256	3258	3259	Mrs. Dawson	165	" Do you know , my dear Miss Graham , "
3261	3274	3258	3259	Mrs. Dawson	165	" I think you ought to consider yourself a remarkably lucky girl ? "
3334	3345	3346	3346	she	587	" What do you mean , my dear Mrs. Dawson ? "
3387	3414	3463	3464	the surgeon	517	" Why , I mean , my dear , that it only rests with yourself to become Lady Audley , and the mistress of Audley Court . "
3452	3461	3463	3464	the surgeon	517	" My dear , do n't agitate yourself , "
3470	3578	3463	3464	the surgeon	517	" you know that nobody asks you to marry Sir Michael unless you wish . Of course it would be a magnificent match ; he has a splendid income , and is one of the most generous of men . Your position would be very high , and you would be enabled to do a great deal of good ; but , as I said before , you must be entirely guided by your own feelings . Only one thing I must say , and that is that if Sir Michael 's attentions are not agreeable to you , it is really scarcely honorable to encourage him . "
3579	3585	3587	3587	Lucy	158	" His attentions encourage him ! "
3596	3628	3587	3587	Lucy	158	" Pray , pray do n't talk to me , Mrs. Dawson . I had no idea of this . It is the last thing that would have occurred to me . "
3749	3763	3764	3764	she	158	" I think some people are born to be unlucky , Mrs. Dawson , "
3773	3791	3764	3764	she	158	" it would be a great deal too much good fortune for me to become Lady Audley . "
3815	3822	3823	3823	she	584	" You unlucky , my dear ! "
3826	3878	3823	3823	she	584	" I think you are the last person who ought to talk like that you , such a bright , happy creature , that it does every one good to see you . I 'm sure I do n't know what we shall do if Sir Michael robs us of you . "
4098	4110	4111	4111	he	160	" I scarcely think there is a greater sin , Lucy , "
4116	4198	4199	4199	he	160	" than that of a woman who marries a man she does not love . You are so precious to me , my beloved , that deeply as my heart is set on this , and bitter as the mere thought of disappointment is to me , I would not have you commit such a sin for any happiness of mine . If my happiness could be achieved by such an act , which it could not which it never could , "
4203	4221	4199	4199	he	160	" nothing but misery can result from a marriage dictated by any motive but truth and love . "
4308	4315	4334	4334	she	158	" Lucy , you heard me ? "
4316	4319	4320	4320	she	158	" Yes , "
4341	4346	4334	4334	she	158	" And your answer ? "
4410	4419	4420	4420	he	474	" No , Lucy ; no , no ! "
4425	4432	4420	4420	he	474	" not here , not here ! "
4433	4440	4441	4441	she	158	" Yes , here , here , "
4464	4649	4441	4441	she	158	" here and nowhere else . How good you are how noble and how generous ! Love you ! Why , there are women a hundred times my superiors in beauty and in goodness who might love you dearly ; but you ask too much of me ! Remember what my life has been ; only remember that ! From my very babyhood I have never seen anything but poverty . My father was a gentleman : clever , accomplished , handsome but poor and what a pitiful wretch poverty made of him ! My mother But do not let me speak of her . Poverty poverty , trials , vexations , humiliations , deprivations . You can not tell ; you , who are among those for whom life is so smooth and easy , you can never guess what is endured by such as we . Do not ask too much of me , then . I can not be disinterested ; I can not be blind to the advantages of such an alliance . I can not , I can not ! "
4735	4744	4745	4745	she	610	" Do n't ask too much of me , "
4749	4758	4745	4745	she	610	" I have been selfish from my babyhood . "
4759	4771	4745	4745	she	610	" Lucy Lucy , speak plainly . Do you dislike me ? "
4772	4779	4745	4745	she	610	" Dislike you ? No no ! "
4780	4791	4745	4745	she	610	" But is there any one else whom you love ? "
4799	4810	4811	4811	she	610	" I do not love any one in the world , "
4850	4913	4833	4833	He	474	" Well , Lucy , I will not ask too much of you . I dare say I am a romantic old fool ; but if you do not dislike me , and if you do not love any one else , I see no reason why we should not make a very happy couple . Is it a bargain , Lucy ? "
4914	4917	4833	4833	He	474	" Yes . "
5111	5124	5125	5125	she	158	" No more dependence , no more drudgery , no more humiliations , "
5128	5150	5125	5125	she	158	" every trace of the old life melted away every clew to identity buried and forgotten except these , except these . "
5261	5267	5268	5268	he	474	" How wearisome they are , "
5271	5308	5268	5268	he	474	" blue and green , and opal ; opal , and blue , and green ; all very well in their way , of course , but three months of them are rather too much , especially "
5340	5351	5352	5352	he	474	" Poor little girl , how pleased she 'll be ! "
5366	5391	5352	5352	he	474	" how pleased and how surprised ? Poor little girl . After three years and a half , too ; she will be surprised . "
5826	5834	5814	5814	his	168	" Ah , yes , by Jove ! "
5836	5843	5814	5814	his	168	" To be sure , ah ! "
6173	6186	6187	6187	he	168	" I will go ashore in the first boat that hails us , "
6190	6216	6187	6187	he	168	" I will go ashore in a cockle - shell . By Jove , if it comes to that , I will swim to land . "
6378	6388	6389	6389	he	168	" Does my cigar annoy you , Miss Morley ? "
6399	6426	6389	6389	he	168	" Not at all ; pray do not leave off smoking . I only came up to look at the sunset . What a lovely evening ! "
6427	6436	6437	6437	he	168	" Yes , yes , I dare say , "
6442	6463	6437	6437	he	168	" yet so long , so long ! Ten more interminable days and ten more weary nights before we land . "
6464	6467	6469	6470	Miss Morley	173	" Yes , "
6474	6482	6469	6470	Miss Morley	173	" Do you wish the time shorter ? "
6483	6487	6489	6489	George	168	" Do I ? "
6491	6500	6489	6489	George	168	" Indeed I do . Do n't you ? "
6501	6504	6437	6437	he	168	" Scarcely . "
6505	6528	6489	6489	George	168	" But is there no one you love in England ? Is there no one you love looking out for your arrival ? "
6529	6534	6535	6535	she	173	" I hope so , "
6618	6621	6623	6623	George	168	" See ! "
6640	6647	6635	6636	Miss Morley	173	" there 's the new moon ! "
6665	6676	6648	6648	She	173	" This is the first time we have seen it . "
6677	6682	6684	6684	George	168	" We must wish ! "
6686	6693	6684	6684	George	168	" I know what I wish . "
6694	6697	6648	6648	She	173	" What ? "
6698	6706	6684	6684	George	168	" That we may get home quickly . "
6707	6722	6724	6725	the governess	587	" My wish is that we may find no disappointment when we get there , "
6729	6732	6684	6684	George	168	" Disappointment ! "
6752	6757	6758	6758	she	173	" I mean this , "
6774	6990	6991	6991	she	690	" I mean that as the end of the voyage draws near , hope sinks in my heart ; and a sick fear comes over me that at the last all may not be well . The person I go to meet may be changed in his feelings toward me ; or he may retain all the old feeling until the moment of seeing me , and then lose it in a breath at sight of my poor wan face , for I was called a pretty girl , Mr. Talboys , when I sailed for Sydney , fifteen years ago ; or he may be so changed by the world as to have grown selfish and mercenary , and he may welcome me for the sake of my fifteen years ' savings . Again , he may be dead . He may have been well , perhaps , up to within a week of our landing , and in that last week may have taken a fever , and died an hour before our vessel anchors in the Mersey . I think of all these things , Mr. Talboys , and act the scenes over in my mind , and feel the anguish of them twenty times a day . Twenty times a day , "
6994	7005	6991	6991	she	690	" why I do it a thousand times a day . "
7045	7049	7050	7050	she	690	" I wonder , "
7060	7159	7050	7050	she	690	" I wonder , looking back , to think how hopeful I was when the vessel sailed ; I never thought then of disappointment , but I pictured the joy of meeting , imagining the very words that would be said , the very tones , the very looks ; but for this last month of the voyage , day by day , and hour by hour my heart sinks and my hopeful fancies fade away , and I dread the end as much as if I knew that I was going to England to attend a funeral . "
7198	7203	7204	7204	he	677	" What a fool ! "
7218	7328	7204	7204	he	677	" what a fool I am to be frightened at this ? Why do you come and say these things to me ? Why do you come and terrify me out of my senses , when I am going straight home to the woman I love ; to a girl whose heart is as true as the light of Heaven ; and in whom I no more expect to find any change than I do to see another sun rise in to - morrow 's sky ? Why do you come and try to put such fancies in my head when I am going home to my darling wife ? "
7329	7333	7334	7334	she	694	" Your wife , "
7337	7481	7334	7334	she	694	" that is different . There is no reason that my terrors should terrify you . I am going to England to rejoin a man to whom I was engaged to be married fifteen years ago . He was too poor to marry then , and when I was offered a situation as governess in a rich Australian family , I persuaded him to let me accept it , so that I might leave him free and unfettered to win his way in the world , while I saved a little money to help us when we began life together . I never meant to stay away so long , but things have gone badly with him in England . That is my story , and you can understand my fears . They need not influence you . Mine is an exceptional case . "
7482	7487	7489	7489	George	168	" So is mine , "
7493	7589	7489	7489	George	168	" I tell you that mine is an exceptional case : although I swear to you that until this moment , I have never known a fear as to the result of my voyage home . But you are right ; your terrors have nothing to do with me . You have been away fifteen years ; all kinds of things may happen in fifteen years . Now it is only three years and a half this very month since I left England . What can have happened in such a short time as that ? "
7637	7659	7660	7660	he	168	" My pretty little wife ! My gentle , innocent , loving little wife ! Do you know , Miss Morley , "
7671	7706	7660	7660	he	168	" that I left my little girl asleep , with her baby in her arms , and with nothing but a few blotted lines to tell her why her faithful husband had deserted her ? "
7707	7711	7713	7714	the governess	587	" Deserted her ! "
7716	7998	7660	7660	he	168	" Yes . I was an ensign in a cavalry regiment when I first met my little darling . We were quartered at a stupid seaport town , where my pet lived with her shabby old father , a half - pay naval officer ; a regular old humbug , as poor as Job , and with an eye for nothing but the main chance . I saw through all his shallow tricks to catch one of us for his pretty daughter . I saw all the pitiable , contemptible , palpable traps he set for us big dragoons to walk into . I saw through his shabby - genteel dinners and public - house port ; his fine talk of the grandeur of his family ; his sham pride and independence , and the sham tears of his bleared old eyes when he talked of his only child . He was a drunken old hypocrite , and he was ready to sell my poor , little girl to the highest bidder . Luckily for me , I happened just then to be the highest bidder ; for my father , is a rich man , Miss Morley , and as it was love at first sight on both sides , my darling and I made a match of it . No sooner , however , did my father hear that I had married a penniless little girl , the daughter of a tipsy old half - pay lieutenant , than he wrote me a furious letter , telling me he would never again hold any communication with me , and that my yearly allowance would stop from my wedding - day .
7999	8667	7660	7660	he	168	" As there was no remaining in such a regiment as mine , with nothing but my pay to live on , and my pretty little wife to keep , I sold out , thinking that before the money was exhausted , I should be sure to drop into something . I took my darling to Italy , and we lived there in splendid style as long as my two thousand pounds lasted ; but when that began to dwindle down to a couple of hundred or so , we came back to England , and as my darling had a fancy for being near that tiresome old father of hers , we settled at the watering - place where he lived . Well , as soon as the old man heard that I had a couple of hundred pounds left , he expressed a wonderful degree of affection for us , and insisted on our boarding in his house . We consented , still to please my darling , who had just then a peculiar right to have every whim and fancy of her innocent heart indulged . We did board with him , and finally he fleeced us ; but when I spoke of it to my little wife , she only shrugged her shoulders , and said she did not like to be unkind to her ' poor papa . ' So poor papa made away with our little stock of money in no time ; and as I felt that it was now becoming necessary to look about for something , I ran up to London , and tried to get a situation as a clerk in a merchant 's office , or as accountant , or book - keeper , or something of that kind . But I suppose there was the stamp of a heavy dragoon about me , for do what I would I could n't get anybody to believe in my capacity ; and tired out , and down - hearted , I returned to my darling , to find her nursing a son and heir to his father 's poverty . Poor little girl , she was very low - spirited ; and when I told her that my London expedition had failed , she fairly broke down , and burst in to a storm of sobs and lamentations , telling me that I ought not to have married her if I could give her nothing but poverty and misery ; and that I had done her a cruel wrong in making her my wife . By heaven ! Miss Morley , her tears and reproaches drove me almost mad ; and I flew into a rage with her , myself , her father , the world , and everybody in it , and then rail out of the house . I walked about the streets all that day , half out of my mind , and with a strong inclination to throw myself into the sea , so as to leave my poor girl free to make a better match . ' If I drown myself , her father must support her , ' I thought ; ' the old hypocrite could never refuse her a shelter ; but while I live she has no claim on him . ' I went down to a rickety old wooden pier , meaning to wait there till it was dark , and then drop quietly over the end of it into the water ; but while I sat there smoking my pipe , and staring vacantly at the sea - gulls , two men came down , and one of them began to talk of the Australian gold - diggings , and the great things that were to be done there . It appeared that he was going to sail in a day or two , and he was trying to persuade his companion to join him in the expedition .
8668	9226	9523	9523	she	650	" I listened to these men for upward of an hour , following them up and down the pier , with my pipe in my mouth , and hearing all their talk . After this I fell into conversation with them myself , and ascertained that there was a vessel going to leave Liverpool in three days , by which vessel one of the men was going out . This man gave me all the information I required , and told me , moreover , that a stalwart young fellow , such as I was , could hardly fail to do well in the diggings . The thought flashed upon me so suddenly , that I grew hot and red in the face , and trembled in every limb with excitement . This was better than the water , at any rate . Suppose I stole away from my darling , leaving her safe under her father 's roof , and went and made a fortune in the new world , and came back in a twelvemonth to throw it into her lap ; for I was so sanguine in those days that I counted on making my fortune in a year or so . I thanked the man for his information , and late at night strolled homeward . It was bitter winter weather , but I had been too full of passion to feel cold , and I walked through the quiet streets , with the snow drifting in my face , and a desperate hopefulness in my heart . The old man was sitting drinking brandy - and - water in the little dining - room ; and my wife was up - stairs , sleeping peacefully , with the baby on her breast . I sat down and wrote a few brief lines , which told her that I never had loved her better than now , when I seemed to desert her ; that I was going to try my fortune in the new world , and that if I succeeded I should come back to bring her plenty and happiness ; but that if I failed I should never look upon her face again . I divided the remainder of our money something over forty pounds into two equal portions , leaving one for her , and putting the other in my pocket . I knelt down and prayed for my wife and child , with my head upon the white counterpane that covered them . I was n't much of a praying man at ordinary times , but God knows that was a heartfelt prayer . I kissed her once , and the baby once , and then crept out of the room . The dining - room door was open , and the old man was nodding over his paper . He looked up as he heard my step in the passage , and asked me where I was going . ' To have a smoke in the street , ' I answered ; and as this was a common habit of mine he believed me . Three nights after I was out at sea , bound for Melbourne a steerage passenger , with a digger 's tools for my baggage , and about seven shillings in my pocket . "
9227	9232	9234	9235	Miss Morley	173	" And you succeeded ? "
9237	9474	9523	9523	she	650	" Not till I had long despaired of success ; not until poverty and I had become such old companions and bed - fellows , that looking back at my past life , I wondered whether that dashing , reckless , extravagant , luxurious , champagne - drinking dragoon could have really been the same man who sat on the damp ground gnawing a moldy crust in the wilds of the new world . I clung to the memory of my darling , and the trust that I had in her love and truth was the one keystone that kept the fabric of my past life together the one star that lit the thick black darkness of the future . I was hail - fellow - well - met with bad men ; I was in the center of riot , drunkenness , and debauchery ; but the purifying influence of my love kept me safe from all . Thin and gaunt , the half - starved shadow of what I once had been , I saw myself one day in a broken bit of looking - glass , and was frightened by my own face . But I toiled on through all ; through disappointment and despair , rheumatism , fever , starvation ; at the very gates of death , I toiled on steadily to the end ; and in the end I conquered . "
9516	9522	9523	9523	she	650	" How brave you were ! "
9526	9529	9530	9530	he	696	" Brave ! "
9540	9757	9530	9530	he	696	" was n't I working for my darling ? Through all the dreary time of that probation , her pretty white hand seemed beckoning me onward to a happy future ! Why , I have seen her under my wretched canvas tent sitting by my side , with her boy in her arms , as plainly as I had ever seen her in the one happy year of our wedded life . At last , one dreary foggy morning , just three months ago , with a drizzling rain wetting me to the skin , up to my neck in clay and mire , half - starved , enfeebled by fever , stiff with rheumatism , a monster nugget turned up under my spade , and I was in one minute the richest man in Australia . I fell down on the wet clay , with my lump of gold in the bosom of my shirt , and , for the first time in my life , cried like a child . I traveled post - haste to Sydney , realized my price , which was worth upward of L20,000 , and a fortnight afterward took my passage for England in this vessel ; and in ten days in ten days I shall see my darling . "
9758	9772	9921	9923	Presently George Talboys	176	" But in all that time did you never write to your wife ? "
9773	9877	9530	9530	he	696	" Never , till the night before I left Sydney . I could not write when everything looked so black . I could not write and tell her that I was fighting hard with despair and death . I waited for better fortune , and when that came I wrote telling her that I should be in England almost as soon as my letter , and giving her an address at a coffee - house in London where she could write to me , telling me where to find her , though she is hardly likely to have left her father 's house . "
9938	9966	9932	9933	the governess	587	" Miss Morley , if , when I get to England , I hear that anything has happened to my wife , I shall fall down dead . "
9967	10030	9921	9923	Presently George Talboys	176	" My dear Mr. Talboys , why do you think of these things ? God is very good to us ; He will not afflict us beyond our power of endurance . I see all things , perhaps , in a melancholy light ; for the long monotony of my life has given me too much time to think over my troubles . "
10031	10108	9932	9933	the governess	587	" And my life has been all action , privation , toil , alternate hope and despair ; I have had no time to think upon the chances of anything happening to my darling . What a blind , reckless fool I have been ! Three years and a half and not one line one word from her , or from any mortal creature who knows her . Heaven above ! what may not have happened ? "
10137	10146	10147	10147	he	701	" I swear to you , Miss Morley , "
10150	10203	10147	10147	he	701	" that till you spoke to me to - night , I never felt one shadow of fear , and now I have that sick , sinking dread at my heart which you talked of an hour ago . Let me alone , please , to get over it my own way . "
10273	10279	10280	10280	he	168	" I have been praying , "
10282	10288	10280	10280	he	168	" praying for my darling . "
11021	11026	11028	11029	the man	644	" Why , Phoebe , "
11049	11108	11028	11029	the man	644	" you came upon me so still and sudden , that I thought you was an evil spirit . I 've come across through the fields , and come in here at the gate agen the moat , and I was taking a rest before I came up to the house to ask if you was come back . "
11109	11122	11123	11123	Phoebe	177	" I can see the well from my bedroom window , Luke , "
11137	11170	11123	11123	Phoebe	177	" I saw you sitting here , and came down to have a chat ; it 's better talking out here than in the house , where there 's always somebody listening . "
11308	11318	11319	11319	she	722	" Are you glad to see me , Luke ? "
11322	11331	11332	11332	he	644	" Of course I 'm glad , lass , "
11370	11382	11384	11385	the girl	722	" You do n't seem much as if you were glad , "
11387	11408	11384	11385	the girl	722	" you might look at me , Luke , and tell me if you think my journey has improved me . "
11409	11423	11424	11424	he	644	" It ai n't put any color into your cheeks , my girl , "
11437	11452	11424	11424	he	644	" you 're every bit as white as you was when you went away . "
11453	11519	11384	11385	the girl	722	" But they say traveling makes people genteel , Luke . I 've been on the Continent with my lady , through all manner of curious places ; and you know , when I was a child , Squire Horton 's daughters taught me to speak a little French , and I found it so nice to be able to talk to the people abroad . "
11520	11523	11525	11526	Luke Marks	178	" Genteel ! "
11533	11602	11525	11526	Luke Marks	178	" who wants you to be genteel , I wonder ? Not me , for one ; when you 're my wife you wo n't have overmuch time for gentility , my girl . French , too ! Dang me , Phoebe , I suppose when we 've saved money enough between us to buy a bit of a farm , you 'll be parleyvooing to the cows ? "
11675	11729	11662	11662	she	753	" What a fine thing it is for Miss Graham that was , to travel with her maid and her courier , and her chariot and four , and a husband that thinks there is n't one spot upon all the earth that 's good enough for her to set her foot upon ! "
11730	11747	11749	11749	Luke	178	" Ay , it is a fine thing , Phoebe , to have lots of money , "
11751	11775	11749	11749	Luke	178	" and I hope you 'll be warned by that , my lass , to save up your wages agin we get married . "
11776	11792	11794	11795	the girl	722	" Why , what was she in Mr. Dawson 's house only three months ago ? "
11808	11922	11799	11799	she	722	" What was she but a servant like me ? Taking wages and working for them as hard , or harder , than I did . You should have seen her shabby clothes , Luke worn and patched , and darned and turned and twisted , yet always looking nice upon her , somehow . She gives me more as lady's - maid here than ever she got from Mr. Dawson then . Why , I 've seen her come out of the parlor with a few sovereigns and a little silver in her hand , that master had just given her for her quarter 's salary ; and now look at her ! "
11923	11929	11931	11931	Luke	178	" Never you mind her , "
11933	11989	11931	11931	Luke	178	" take care of yourself , Phoebe ; that 's all you 've got to do . What should you say to a public - house for you and me , by - and - by , my girl ? There 's a deal of money to be made out of a public - house . "
12032	12044	12045	12045	she	722	" You should see the inside of the house , Luke , "
12048	12107	12045	12045	she	722	" it 's a tumbledown looking place enough outside ; but you should see my lady 's rooms all pictures and gilding , and great looking - glasses that stretch from the ceiling to the floor . Painted ceilings , too , that cost hundreds of pounds , the housekeeper told her , and all done for her . "
12108	12115	12117	12117	Luke	178	" She 's a lucky one , "
12123	12243	12045	12045	she	722	" You should have seen her while we were abroad , with a crowd of gentlemen hanging about her ; Sir Michael not jealous of them , only proud to see her so much admired . You should have heard her laugh and talk with them ; throwing all their compliments and fine speeches back at them , as it were , as if they had been pelting her with roses . She set everybody mad about her , wherever she went . Her singing , her playing , her painting , her dancing , her beautiful smile , and sunshiny ringlets ! She was always the talk of a place , as long as we stayed in it . "
12244	12253	12045	12045	she	722	" Is she at home to - night ? "
12254	12291	12045	12045	she	722	" No ; she has gone out with Sir Michael to a dinner party at the Beeches . They 've seven or eight miles to drive , and they wo n't be back till after eleven . "
12292	12323	12045	12045	she	722	" Then I 'll tell you what , Phoebe , if the inside of the house is so mighty fine , I should like to have a look at it . "
12324	12356	12045	12045	she	722	" You shall , then . Mrs. Barton , the housekeeper , knows you by sight , and she ca n't object to my showing you some of the best rooms . "
12511	12521	12522	12522	he	178	" It 's a mortal dull place , Phoebe , "
12542	12558	12522	12522	he	178	" I 've heard tell of a murder that was done here in old times . "
12559	12574	12576	12577	the girl	722	" There are murders enough in these times , as to that , Luke , "
12675	12683	12684	12684	he	677	" It 's a rare fine place , "
12687	12697	12684	12684	he	677	" and must have cost a heap of money . "
12698	12707	12709	12709	Phoebe	177	" Look at the pictures on the walls , "
12732	12759	12760	12760	She	177	" I 've heard that those alone are worth a fortune . This is the entrance to my lady 's apartments , Miss Graham that was . "
12823	12857	12858	12858	Her	177	" I 've got all these things to put away before my lady comes home , Luke ; you might sit down here while I do it , I sha n't be long . "
12897	12909	12911	12912	the girl	722	" I wish I could show you the jewels , Luke , "
12914	12939	12911	12912	the girl	722	" but I ca n't , for she always keeps the keys herself ; that 's the case on the dressing - table there . "
12940	12945	12947	12947	Luke	178	" What , that ? "
12961	12978	12947	12947	Luke	178	" Why , that 's big enough to hold every bit of clothes I 've got ! "
12979	12998	13000	13000	Phoebe	177	" And it 's as full as it can be of diamonds , rubies , pearls and emeralds , "
13053	13057	13058	13058	she	177	" I declare ! "
13061	13090	13058	13058	she	177	" my lady has left her keys in her pocket for once in a way ; I can show you the jewelry , if you like , Luke . "
13091	13107	13108	13108	he	795	" Well , I may as well have a look at it , my girl , "
13189	13220	13269	13269	his	795	" Why , one of those diamond things would set us up in life , Phoebe , he said , turning a bracelet over and over in his big red hands .
13221	13233	13235	13236	the girl	722	" Put it down , Luke ! Put it down directly ! "
13244	13253	13235	13236	the girl	722	" how can you speak about such things ? "
13275	13280	13281	13281	he	795	" What 's this ? "
13322	13327	13329	13329	Luke	178	" Look ye here ! "
13355	13364	13365	13365	she	177	" Why , I never saw this before , "
13368	13377	13365	13365	she	177	" I wonder what there is in it ? "
13435	13448	13449	13449	she	177	" So this is what my lady hides in the secret drawer , "
13452	13464	13466	13466	Luke	178	" It 's queer rubbish to keep in such a place , "
13481	13492	13493	13493	she	177	" You will bear me witness where I found this , "
13504	13523	13525	13527	the young man	677	" Why , Phoebe , you 're not going to be such a fool as to take that , "
13529	13546	13547	13547	she	177	" I 'd rather have this than the diamond bracelet you would have liked to take , "
13550	13560	13547	13547	she	177	" you shall have the public house , Luke . "
13569	13573	13547	13547	she	177	" THE TIMES . "
14480	14490	14491	14491	he	155	" I always said the old buffer would marry , "
14742	14757	14758	14758	Robert	155	" Be so good as to look where you 're going , my friend ! "
14768	14785	14758	14758	Robert	155	" you might give a man warning before you throw him down and trample upon him . "
14804	14807	14808	14808	he	155	" Bob ! "
14821	14843	14808	14808	he	155	" I only touched British ground after dark last night , and to think that I should meet you this morning . "
14844	14856	14858	14859	Mr. Audley	155	" I 've seen you somewhere before , my bearded friend , "
14870	14884	14858	14859	Mr. Audley	155	" but I 'll be hanged if I can remember when or where . "
14885	14888	14890	14891	the stranger	865	" What ! "
14895	14909	14890	14891	the stranger	865	" You do n't mean to say that you 've forgotten George Talboys ? "
14910	14916	14918	14918	Robert	155	" No I have not ! "
14956	14967	14941	14941	he	155	" and now , George tell us all about it . "
15038	15055	15057	15057	Robert	155	" If you 'll believe me , I 've only just left their counting - house , "
15059	15077	15057	15057	Robert	155	" I 'll go back with you , and we 'll settle that matter in five minutes . "
15245	15260	15261	15261	he	168	" I shall take a villa on the banks of the Thames , Bob , "
15264	15331	15333	15339	the young man , whose classic lore	882	" for the little wife and myself ; and we 'll have a yacht , Bob , old boy , and you shall lie on the deck and smoke , while my pretty one plays her guitar and sings songs to us . She 's for all the world like one of those what's - its - names , who got poor old Ulysses into trouble , "
15496	15499	15500	15500	he	889	" Talboys , "
15503	15536	15500	15500	he	889	" perhaps you did n't hear the name distinctly T , A , L , B , O , Y , S. Go and look again , there must be a letter . "
15774	15794	15762	15762	he	168	" On the 24th inst . , at Ventnor , Isle of Wight , Helen Talboys , aged 22 . "
15811	15818	15765	15765	his	168	" Helen Talboys , aged 22 . "
16180	16193	16194	16195	his friend	869	" You do n't mind the pipe , do you , George ? "
16200	16203	16194	16195	his friend	869	" No . "
16229	16247	16305	16305	he	155	" Do the birds annoy you , George ? Shall I take them out of the room ? "
16248	16258	16305	16305	he	155	" No ; I like to hear them sing . "
16294	16300	16301	16301	he	155	" Take this , George , "
16319	16327	16301	16301	he	155	" it will do your head good . "
16351	16354	16355	16355	he	155	" Bob , "
16358	16363	16355	16355	he	155	" where are we ? "
16364	16398	16399	16399	George	168	" In my chambers , dear boy , in the Temple . You have no lodgings of your own , so you may as well stay with me while you 're in town . "
16422	16434	16399	16399	George	168	" That newspaper this morning , Bob ; what was it ? "
16435	16448	16399	16399	George	168	" Never mind just now , old boy ; drink some tea . "
16449	16454	16456	16456	George	168	" Yes , yes , "
16474	16500	16456	16456	George	168	" I remember all about it . Helen ! my Helen ! my wife , my darling , my only love ! Dead , dead ! "
16501	16504	16510	16510	his	155	" George , "
16520	16549	16510	16510	his	155	" you must remember that the person whose name you saw in the paper may not be your wife . There may have been some other Helen Talboys . "
16550	16555	16556	16556	he	155	" No , no ! "
16559	16574	16556	16556	he	155	" the age corresponds with hers , and Talboys is such an uncommon name . "
16575	16584	16510	16510	his	155	" It may be a misprint for Talbot . "
16585	16597	16556	16556	he	155	" No , no , no ; my wife is dead ! "
16618	16624	16626	16627	his friend	869	" Where are you going ? "
16629	16638	16510	16510	his	155	" To Ventnor , to see her grave . "
16639	16666	16667	16667	Robert	155	" Not to - night , George , not to - night . I will go with you myself by the first train to - morrow . "
16831	16840	16841	16842	Robert Audley	155	" What are we to do , George ? "
16845	16859	16841	16842	Robert Audley	155	" We have no clew to finding the people you want to see . "
16916	16934	16935	16935	he	155	" Had we not better ask at one of the hotels about a Mrs. Talboys , George ? "
16938	16946	16947	16947	George	194	" Her father 's name was Maldon , "
16950	16962	16947	16947	George	194	" he could never have sent her here to die alone . "
17213	17216	17218	17218	George	194	" Look ! "
17380	17392	17393	17393	he	677	" Her portrait used to hang by the side of mine , "
17396	17406	17393	17393	he	677	" I wonder what they have done with it . "
17422	17441	17412	17412	he	677	" I should like to see the woman of the house ; I should like to ask her about "
17554	17564	17543	17543	she	950	" Yes , he is the lady 's husband . "
17565	17568	17569	17570	the woman	968	" What ! "
17573	17612	17569	17570	the woman	968	" him as deserted her so cruel , and left her with her pretty boy upon her poor old father 's hands , which Captain Maldon has told me often , with the tears in his poor eyes ? "
17613	17620	17621	17621	George	194	" I did not desert her , "
17638	17645	17646	17646	he	155	" Did she speak of me ? "
17649	17660	17646	17646	he	155	" did she speak of me at at the last ? "
17661	17745	17627	17627	he	155	" No , she went off as quiet as a lamb . She said very little from the first ; but the last day she knew nobody , not even her little boy , nor her poor old father , who took on awful . Once she went off wild - like , talking about her mother , and about the cruel shame it was to leave her to die in a strange place , till it was quite pitiful to hear her . "
17746	17757	17759	17759	George	194	" Her mother died when she was quite a child , "
17761	17780	17759	17759	George	194	" To think that she should remember her and speak of her , but never once of me . "
17870	17882	17883	17883	she	968	" I cut this off when she lay in her coffin , "
17886	17890	17883	17883	she	968	" poor dear ? "
17900	17903	17904	17904	he	970	" Yes , "
17907	17946	17904	17904	he	970	" this is the dear hair that I have kissed so often when her head lay upon my shoulder . But it always had a rippling wave in it then , and now it seems smooth and straight . "
17947	17953	17955	17956	the landlady	950	" It changes in illness , "
17958	17986	17955	17956	the landlady	950	" If you 'd like to see where they have laid her , Mr. Talboys , my little boy shall show you the way to the churchyard . "
18146	18165	18143	18144	GEORGE TALBOYS	168	" Who departed this life August 24th , 18 , aged 22 , Deeply regretted by her sorrowing Husband .
18294	18298	18299	18299	he	168	" Mr. Maldon , "
18395	18399	18401	18401	George	168	" Great Heaven ! "
18403	18410	18401	18401	George	168	" do n't you know me ? "
18435	18440	18441	18441	he	5066	" My dear boy , "
18444	18479	18480	18480	he	5066	" I did not ; for the first moment I did not . That beard makes such a difference . You find the beard makes a great difference , do you not , sir ? "
18487	18491	18493	18494	George Talboys	168	" Great heavens ! "
18496	18537	18493	18494	George Talboys	168	" is this the way you welcome me ? I come to England to find my wife dead within a week of my touching land , and you begin to chatter to me about my beard you , her father ! "
18538	18543	18545	18547	the old man	5066	" True ! true ! "
18554	18577	18545	18547	the old man	5066	" a sad shock , a sad shock , my dear George . If you 'd only been here a week earlier . "
18578	18583	18585	18585	George	168	" If I had , "
18595	18646	18585	18585	George	168	" I scarcely think that I would have let her die . I would have disputed for her with death . I would ! I would ! Oh God ! why did not the Argus go down with every soul on board her before I came to see this day ? "
18676	18694	18696	18696	Robert	155	" I 've a strong notion that that old man did n't treat his daughter too well , "
18707	18724	18699	18699	he	155	" He seems , for some reason or other , to be half afraid of George . "
18758	18767	18768	18768	he	995	" Come home , grandpa , come home , "
18771	18776	18768	18768	he	995	" I 'm tired . "
18808	18815	18817	18817	George	168	" My darling ! my darling ! "
18826	18845	18817	18817	George	168	" I am your father , come across the sea to find you . Will you love me ? "
18853	18860	18861	18861	he	168	" I do n't know you , "
18864	18874	18861	18861	he	168	" I love grandpa and Mrs. Monks at Southampton . "
18875	18886	18888	18890	the old man	5066	" Georgey has a temper of his own , sir , "
18892	18898	18888	18890	the old man	5066	" He has been spoiled . "
19029	19040	19042	19042	George	168	" The boy seems fond of you , Mr. Maldon , "
19048	19053	19055	19057	the old man	5066	" Yes , yes , "
19066	19077	19055	19057	the old man	5066	" yes . Georgey is very fond of his grandfather . "
19078	19158	19223	19225	The old man	5066	" Then he had better stop with you . The interest of my money will be about six hundred a year . You can draw a hundred of that for Georgey 's education , leaving the rest to accumulate till he is of age . My friend here will be trustee , and if he will undertake the charge , I will appoint him guardian to the boy , allowing him for the present to remain under your care . "
19159	19171	19173	19174	Robert Audley	155	" But why not take care of him yourself , George ? "
19176	19222	19223	19225	The old man	5066	" Because I shall sail in the very next vessel that leaves Liverpool for Australia . I shall be better in the diggings or the backwoods than ever I could be here . I 'm broken for a civilized life from this hour , Bob . "
19236	19247	19248	19248	he	5066	" My poor boy , I think you 're right , "
19251	19268	19248	19248	he	5066	" I really think you 're right . The change , the wild life , the the "
19281	19305	19306	19306	he	5066	" You 're in a great hurry to get rid of your son - in - law , I think , Mr. Maldon , "
19311	19344	19248	19248	he	5066	" Get rid of him , dear boy ! Oh , no , no ! But for his own sake , my dear sir , for his own sake , you know . "
19345	19365	19367	19367	Robert	155	" I think for his own sake he 'd much better stay in England and look after his son , "
19369	19378	19380	19380	George	168	" But I tell you I ca n't , "
19382	19458	19380	19380	George	168	" every inch of this accursed ground is hateful to me I want to run out of it as I would out of a graveyard . I 'll go back to town to - night , get that business about the money settled early to - morrow morning , and start for Liverpool without a moment 's delay . I shall be better when I 've put half the world between me and her grave . "
19459	19481	19538	19538	George	168	" Before he left the house he stole out to the landlady , and asked some more questions about his dead wife .
19482	19487	19488	19488	he	1022	" Were they poor ? "
19491	19502	19488	19488	he	1022	" were they pinched for money while she was ill ? "
19503	19508	19509	19510	the woman	968	" Oh , no ! "
19513	19537	19509	19510	the woman	968	" though the captain dresses shabby , he has always plenty of sovereigns in his purse . The poor lady wanted for nothing . "
19638	19658	19659	19659	he	5066	" You did not introduce me to your friend , by - the - bye , my dear boy , "
19712	19716	19718	19718	George	168	" To think , "
19720	19759	19718	19718	George	168	" that two nights ago , at this time , I was steaming into Liverpool , full of the hope of clasping her to my heart , and to - night I am going away from her grave ! "
19784	19791	19793	19793	Robert	155	" It 's a great responsibility , "
19795	19817	19793	19793	Robert	155	" I , guardian to anybody or anything ! I , who never in my life could take care of myself ! "
19818	19828	19830	19830	George	168	" I trust in your noble heart , Bob , "
19832	19880	19830	19830	George	168	" I know you will take care of my poor orphan boy , and see that he is well used by his grandfather . I shall only draw enough from Georgey 's fortune to take me back to Sydney , and then begin my old work again . "
20291	20469	20279	20279	Alicia	163	" MY DEAR ROBERT How cruel of you to run away to that horrid St. Petersburg before the hunting season ! I have heard that people lose their noses in that disagreeable climate , and as yours is rather a long one , I should advise you to return before the very severe weather sets in . What sort of person is this Mr. Talboys ? If he is very agreeable you may bring him to the Court as soon as you return from your travels . Lady Audley tells me to request you to secure her a set of sables . You are not to consider the price , but to be sure that they are the handsomest that can be obtained . Papa is perfectly absurd about his new wife , and she and I can not get on together at all ; not that she is , disagreeable to me , for , as far as that goes , she makes herself agreeable to every one ; but she is so irretrievably childish and silly .
20470	20479	20279	20279	Alicia	163	" Believe me to be , my dear Robert .
20480	20484	20279	20279	Alicia	163	" Your affectionate cousin ,
20485	20489	20279	20279	Alicia	163	" ALICIA AUDLEY . "
20693	20700	20701	20701	he	155	" Do you know , Bob , "
20704	20815	20701	20701	he	155	" that when some of our fellows were wounded in India , they came home , bringing bullets inside them . They did not talk of them , and they were stout and hearty , and looked as well , perhaps , as you or I ; but every change in the weather , however slight , every variation of the atmosphere , however trifling , brought back the old agony of their wounds as sharp as ever they had felt it on the battle - field . I 've had my wound , Bob ; I carry the bullet still , and I shall carry it into my coffin . "
20911	20917	20918	20918	he	168	" What can I do ? "
20921	21006	20918	20918	he	168	" If I take him away from his grandfather , I shall break his heart ; if I let him remain , he will grow up a stranger to me , and care more for that drunken old hypocrite than for his own father . But then , what could an ignorant , heavy dragoon like me do with such a child ? What could I teach him , except to smoke cigars and idle around all day with his hands in his pockets ? "
21147	21161	21162	21164	the young barrister	1073	" I shall write to my cousin Alicia to - day , George , "
21174	21212	21162	21164	the young barrister	1073	" Do you know that the day after to - morrow is the 1st of September ? I shall write and tell her that we will both run down to the Court for a week 's shooting . "
21213	21234	21162	21164	the young barrister	1073	" No , no , Bob ; go by yourself ; they do n't want me , and I 'd rather "
21235	21263	21162	21164	the young barrister	1073	" Bury yourself in Figtree Court , with no company but my dogs and canaries ! No , George , you shall do nothing of the kind . "
21264	21273	21162	21164	the young barrister	1073	" But I do n't care for shooting . "
21274	21284	21286	21286	Robert	155	" And do you suppose I care for it ? "
21292	21410	21286	21286	Robert	155	" Why , man , I do n't know a partridge from a pigeon , and it might be the 1st of April , instead of the 1st of September , for aught I care . I never hurt a bird in my life , but I have hurt my own shoulder with the weight of my gun . I only go down to Essex for the change of air , the good dinners , and the sight of my uncle 's honest , handsome face . Besides , this time I 've another inducement , as I want to see this fair - haired paragon my new aunt . You 'll go with me , George ? "
21411	21420	21162	21164	the young barrister	1073	" Yes , if you really wish it . "
21513	21522	21524	21526	the young lady	1080	" There are seventeen spare bed - rooms , "
21534	21621	21524	21526	the young lady	1080	" but for all that , my dear Robert , you ca n't come ; for my lady has taken it into her silly head that she is too ill to entertain visitors there is no more the matter with her than there is with me , and she can not have gentlemen great , rough men , she says in the house . Please apologize to your friend Mr. Talboys , and tell him that papa expects to see you both in the hunting season . "
21622	21640	21642	21642	Robert	155	" My lady 's airs and graces sha n't keep us out of Essex for all that , "
21659	21735	21645	21645	he	155	" I 'll tell you what we 'll do , George : there 's a glorious inn at Audley , and plenty of fishing in the neighborhood ; we 'll go there and have a week 's sport . Fishing is much better than shooting ; you 've only to lie on a bank and stare at your line ; I do n't find that you often catch anything , but it 's very pleasant . "
21775	21780	21781	21781	he	155	" Poor little Alicia ! "
21786	21802	21781	21781	he	155	" it 's rather hard to treat her letter so cavalierly I 'll keep it ; "
22674	22682	22684	22685	Robert Audley	155	" Put on your hat , George , "
22687	22714	22684	22685	Robert Audley	155	" they do n't dine at the Court till seven ; we shall have time to stroll down and see the old place and its inhabitants . "
22738	22747	22748	22748	he	1125	" I beg your pardon , Mr. Audley , "
22751	22816	22748	22748	he	1125	" but if you want to see your uncle , you 'll lose your time by going to the Court just now . Sir Michael and my lady and Miss Alicia have all gone to the races up at Chorley , and they wo n't be back till nigh upon eight o'clock , most likely . They must pass by here to go home . "
23169	23177	23179	23180	Robert Audley	155	" Why , it 's my uncle , "
23187	23197	23179	23180	Robert Audley	155	" I 'll run down and speak to him . "
23280	23285	23287	23288	Sir Michael	160	" Why , Robert , "
23298	23304	23287	23288	Sir Michael	160	" this is a surprise ! "
23305	23322	23324	23326	the young man	677	" I have not come to intrude upon you at the Court , my dear uncle , "
23342	23384	23324	23326	the young man	677	" Essex is my native county , you know , and about this time of year I generally have a touch of homesickness ; so George and I have come down to the inn for two or three day 's fishing . "
23385	23390	23329	23330	the baronet	474	" George George who ? "
23391	23395	23324	23326	the young man	677	" George Talboys . "
23396	23403	23405	23405	Alicia	163	" What , has he come ? "
23407	23424	23405	23405	Alicia	163	" I 'm so glad ; for I 'm dying to see this handsome young widower . "
23425	23431	23433	23434	her cousin	759	" Are you , Alicia ? "
23436	23455	23433	23434	her cousin	759	" Then egad , I 'll run and fetch him , and introduce you to him at once . "
23557	23566	23567	23567	he	478	" Never mind to - night , Bob , "
23570	23620	23567	23567	he	478	" My wife is a little tired after our long day 's pleasure . Bring your friend to dinner to - morrow , and then he and Alicia can make each other 's acquaintance . Come round and speak to Lady Audley , and then we 'll drive home . "
23647	23665	23666	23666	she	477	" You will come and dine with us to - morrow , and bring your interesting friend ? "
23701	23718	23723	23723	she	163	" It 's a wonder she did n't treat you to her never - ending laugh , "
23737	23763	23765	23767	the young lady	1080	" but I dare say she reserves that for your delectation to - morrow . I suppose you are fascinated as well as everybody else ? "
23772	23781	23783	23783	Robert	155	" She is a lovely creature , certainly , "
23789	23828	23765	23767	the young lady	1080	" Oh , of course ! Now , she is the first woman of whom I ever heard you say a civil word , Robert Audley . I 'm sorry to find you can only admire wax dolls . "
23875	23884	23886	23888	the young lady	1080	" As to his ever falling in love , "
23891	23938	23886	23888	the young lady	1080	" the idea is preposterous . If all the divinities on earth were ranged before him , waiting for his sultanship to throw the handkerchief , he would only lift his eyebrows to the middle of his forehead , and tell them to scramble for it . "
23952	23968	23969	23969	he	155	" She 's the prettiest little creature you ever saw in your life , George , "
23985	24047	23969	23969	he	155	" Such blue eyes , such ringlets , such a ravishing smile , such a fairy - like bonnet all of a - tremble with heart's - ease and dewy spangles , shining out of a cloud of gauze . George Talboys , I feel like the hero of a French novel : I am falling in love with my aunt . "
24436	24447	24448	24448	she	211	" I am tired to death , though , Phoebe , "
24457	24476	24448	24448	she	211	" I am afraid I must look a perfect fright , after a day in the hot sun . "
24525	24535	24537	24538	the girl	722	" You are a little pale , my lady , "
24540	24549	24537	24538	the girl	722	" but you look as pretty as ever . "
24550	24557	24558	24558	she	211	" That 's right , Phoebe , "
24593	24613	24573	24574	the maid	1199	" Do you know , Phoebe , I have heard some people say that you and I are alike ? "
24614	24627	24629	24630	the girl	722	" I have heard them say so , too , my lady , "
24633	24660	24629	24630	the girl	722	" but they must be very stupid to say it , for your ladyship is a beauty , and I am a poor , plain creature . "
24661	24668	24670	24672	the little lady	1201	" Not at all , Phoebe , "
24676	24792	24670	24672	the little lady	1201	" you are like me , and your features are very nice ; it is only color that you want . My hair is pale yellow shot with gold , and yours is drab ; my eyebrows and eyelashes are dark brown , and yours are almost I scarcely like to say it , but they 're almost white , my dear Phoebe . Your complexion is sallow , and mine is pink and rosy . Why , with a bottle of hair - dye , such as we see advertised in the papers , and a pot of rouge , you 'd be as good - looking as I , any day , Phoebe . "
24880	24889	24890	24891	Lady Audley	211	" Go on brushing my hair , Phoebe , "
24905	24914	24890	24891	Lady Audley	211	" I quite enjoy a chat with you . "
24932	24936	24937	24937	she	211	" Phoebe Marks , "
24940	24950	24926	24926	she	211	" I want you to do me a favor . "
24951	24957	24920	24920	she	211	" Yes , my lady . "
24958	25025	24926	24926	she	211	" I want you to go to London by the first train to - morrow morning to execute a little commission for me . You may take a day 's holiday afterward , as I know you have friends in town ; and I shall give you a five - pound note if you do what I want , and keep your own counsel about it . "
25026	25032	24920	24920	she	211	" Yes , my lady . "
25033	25053	24926	24926	she	211	" See that that door is securely shut , and come and sit on this stool at my feet . "
25085	25102	25058	25059	Lady Audley	211	" And now listen , Phoebe . What I want you to do is very simple . "
25157	25163	25164	25164	she	211	" Kiss me , Phoebe , "
25174	25228	25164	25164	she	211	" I hear Sir Michael 's step in the anteroom ; you will meet him as you go out , and you may as well tell him that you are going up by the first train to - morrow morning to get my dress from Madam Frederick for the dinner at Morton Abbey . "
25268	25273	25274	25274	she	211	" A telegraphic message ! "
25288	25295	25274	25274	she	211	" What can be the matter ? "
25342	25349	25350	25350	he	478	" Read it , my darling , "
25353	25368	25350	25350	he	478	" and do not be alarmed ; it may be nothing of any importance . "
25407	25420	25422	25422	Lucy	158	" Poor soul ! she always meant to leave me her money , "
25429	25451	25422	25422	Lucy	158	" She has never heard of the change in my fortunes . Dear Sir Michael , I must go to her . "
25452	25503	25390	25391	The lady	683	" To be sure you must , dearest . If she was kind to my poor girl in her adversity , she has a claim upon her prosperity that shall never be forgotten . Put on your bonnet , Lucy ; we shall be in time to catch the express . "
25504	25511	25422	25422	Lucy	158	" You will go with me ? "
25512	25529	25390	25391	The lady	683	" Of course , my darling . Do you suppose I would let you go alone ? "
25530	25540	25541	25541	she	1224	" I was sure you would go with me , "
25546	25554	25390	25391	The lady	683	" Does your friend send any address ? "
25555	25577	25390	25391	The lady	683	" No ; but she always lived at Crescent Villa , West Brompton ; and no doubt she lives there still . "
25914	25923	25895	25895	she	1235	" Robert , please will you marry me ? "
26290	26301	26303	26303	Robert	155	" Figtree Court is not gay in the long vacation , "
26307	26333	26334	26334	he	155	" but I think , upon the whole , it 's better than this ; at any rate , it 's near a tobacconist 's , "
26384	26395	26396	26396	he	168	" I shall be glad to get back , Bob , "
26399	26424	26396	26396	he	168	" for I want to take a run down to Southampton ; I have n't seen the little one for upward of a month . "
26432	26437	26425	26425	He	168	" the little one ; "
26491	26501	26502	26502	he	168	" I 'm not a romantic man , Bob , "
26507	26640	26502	26502	he	168	" and I never read a line of poetry in my life that was any more to me than so many words and so much jingle ; but a feeling has come over me , since my wife 's death , that I am like a man standing upon a long , low shore , with hideous cliffs frowning down upon him from behind , and the rising tide crawling slowly but surely about his feet . It seems to grow nearer and nearer every day , that black , pitiless tide ; not rushing upon me with a great noise and a mighty impetus , but crawling , creeping , stealing , gliding toward me , ready to close in above my head when I am least prepared for the end . "
26663	26726	26727	26727	he	155	" George Talboys , I could understand this if you had been eating heavy suppers . Cold pork , now , especially if underdone , might produce this sort of thing . You want change of air , my dear boy ; you want the refreshing breezes of Figtree Court , and the soothing air of Fleet street . Or , stay , "
26732	26753	26727	26727	he	155	" I have it ! You 've been smoking our friend the landlord 's cigars ; that accounts for everything . "
26810	26821	26822	26822	she	1080	" You are very soon tired of Audley , Robert , "
26827	26858	26822	26822	she	1080	" but of course you have no friends here , except your relations at the Court ; while in London , no doubt , you have the most delightful society and "
26859	26865	26867	26867	Robert	155	" I get good tobacco , "
26873	26896	26867	26867	Robert	155	" Audley is the dearest old place , but when a man has to smoke dried cabbage leaves , you know , Alicia "
26897	26908	26822	26822	she	1080	" Then you are really going to - morrow morning ? "
26909	26920	26867	26867	Robert	155	" Positively by the express train that leaves at 10.50 . "
26921	26948	26822	26822	she	1080	" Then Lady Audley will lose an introduction to Mr. Talboys , and Mr. Talboys will lose the chance of seeing the prettiest woman in Essex . "
26949	26951	26953	26953	George	168	" Really "
26955	26978	26980	26980	Robert	155	" The prettiest woman in Essex would have a poor chance of getting much admiration out of my friend , George Talboys , "
26982	27023	26980	26980	Robert	155	" His heart is at Southampton , where he has a curly - headed little urchin , about as high as his knee , who calls him ' the big gentleman , ' and asks him for sugar - plums . "
27024	27042	27044	27044	Alicia	163	" I am going to write to my step - mother by to - night 's post , "
27046	27078	27044	27044	Alicia	163	" She asked me particularly in her letter how long you were going to stop , and whether there was any chance of her being back in time to receive you . "
27113	27141	27093	27093	she	163	" She says in her postcript , ' Be sure you answer my question about Mr. Audley and his friend , you volatile , forgetful Alicia ! ' "
27142	27150	27152	27152	Robert	155	" What a pretty hand she writes ! "
27161	27178	27093	27093	she	163	" Yes , it is pretty , is it not ? Look at it , Robert . "
27217	27232	27198	27198	Alicia	163	" Presently , Atalanta , presently . Give me back my note , Bob . "
27233	27366	27198	27198	Alicia	163	" It is the prettiest , most coquettish little hand I ever saw . Do you know , Alicia , I have no great belief in those fellows who ask you for thirteen postage stamps , and offer to tell you what you have never been able to find out yourself ; but upon my word I think that if I had never seen your aunt , I should know what she was like by this slip of paper . Yes , here it all is the feathery , gold - shot , flaxen curls , the penciled eyebrows , the tiny , straight nose , the winning , childish smile ; all to be guessed in these few graceful up - strokes and down - strokes . George , look here ! "
27404	27407	27409	27411	the young lady	1080	" Nevermind , "
27430	27480	27416	27416	she	1080	" Give me the letter , and let me go ; it 's past eight , and I must answer it by to - night 's post . Come , Atalanta ! Good - by , Robert good - by , Mr. Talboys . A pleasant journey to town . "
27528	27538	27539	27539	she	163	" To have only one cousin in the world , "
27544	27568	27539	27539	she	163	" my nearest relation after papa , and for him to care about as much for me as he would for a dog ! "
27670	27680	27681	27681	he	155	" It 's nothing but the cigars , George , "
27686	27711	27681	27681	he	155	" Get me out of the place without my seeing the landlord ; for if that man and I meet there will be bloodshed . "
27810	27858	27788	27789	Mr. Audley	155	" It will kill a couple of hours , you know , George : and it seems a great pity to drag you away from Audley without having shown you the old place , which , I give you my honor , is very well worth seeing . "
28070	28081	28082	28082	he	168	" It ought to be an avenue in a churchyard , "
28085	28107	28082	28082	he	168	" How peacefully the dead might sleep under this somber shade ! I wish the churchyard at Ventnor was like this . "
28154	28168	28170	28170	Robert	155	" We want to see the house before it is dark , Alicia , "
28172	28179	28180	28180	she	163	" Then we must be quick . "
28183	28186	28180	28180	she	163	" Come . "
28255	28286	28247	28247	Alicia	163	" After we have been in the drawing - room , I should like to show these gentlemen Lady Audley 's rooms . Are they in good order , Phoebe ? "
28287	28314	28230	28230	her	1289	" Yes , miss ; but the door of the anteroom is locked , and I fancy that my lady has taken the key to London . "
28315	28322	28324	28324	Alicia	163	" Taken the key ! Impossible ! "
28326	28352	28230	28230	her	1289	" Indeed , miss , I think she has . I can not find it , and it always used to be in the door . "
28353	28357	28359	28359	Alicia	163	" I declare , "
28363	28439	28359	28359	Alicia	163	" that is not at all unlike my lady to have taken this silly freak into her head . I dare say she was afraid we should go into her rooms , and pry about among her pretty dresses , and meddle with her jewelry . It is very provoking , for the best pictures in the house are in that antechamber . There is her own portrait , too , unfinished but wonderfully like . "
28440	28444	28446	28447	Robert Audley	155	" Her portrait ! "
28449	28482	28446	28447	Robert Audley	155	" I would give anything to see it , for I have only an imperfect notion of her face . Is there no other way of getting into the room , Alicia ? "
28483	28487	28359	28359	Alicia	163	" Another way ? "
28488	28514	28446	28447	Robert Audley	155	" Yes ; is there any door , leading through some of the other rooms , by which we can contrive to get into hers ? "
28555	28575	28577	28578	Mr. Audley	155	" That fellow with the battle - ax looks as if he wanted to split George 's head open , "
28597	28606	28608	28610	the young man	677	" Come out of this room , Alicia , "
28614	28699	28608	28610	the young man	677	" I believe it 's damp , or else haunted . Indeed , I believe all ghosts to be the result of damp or dyspepsia . You sleep in a damp bed you awake suddenly in the dead of the night with a cold shiver , and see an old lady in the court costume of George the First 's time , sitting at the foot of the bed . The old lady 's indigestion , and the cold shiver is a damp sheet . "
28790	28817	28819	28819	Robert	155	" Is n't there a secret passage , or an old oak chest , or something of that kind , somewhere about the place , Alicia ? "
28821	28826	28828	28829	Miss Audley	163	" To be sure ! "
28839	28861	28828	28829	Miss Audley	163	" of course . Why did n't I think of it before ? How stupid of me , to be sure ! "
28862	28866	28819	28819	Robert	155	" Why stupid ? "
28867	28954	28828	28829	Miss Audley	163	" Because , if you do n't mind crawling upon your hands and knees , you can see my lady 's apartments , for that passage communicates with her dressing - room . She does n't know of it herself , I believe . How astonished she 'd be if some black - visored burglar , with a dark - lantern , were to rise through the floor some night as she sat before her looking - glass , having her hair dressed for a party ! "
28955	28965	28967	28968	Mr. Audley	155	" Shall we try the secret passage , George ? "
28970	28978	28979	28979	Alicia	163	" Yes , if you wish it . "
29040	29046	29048	29048	Alicia	163	" Now listen to me , "
29050	29156	29048	29048	Alicia	163	" You must let yourself down by the hands into the passage , which is about four feet high ; stoop your head , walk straight along it till you come to a sharp turn which will take you to the left , and at the extreme end of it you will find a short ladder below a trap - door like this , which you will have to unbolt ; that door opens into the flooring of my lady 's dressing - room , which is only covered with a square Persian carpet that you can easily manage to raise . You understand me ? "
29157	29160	29209	29209	her	1310	" Perfectly . "
29161	29206	29048	29048	Alicia	163	" Then take the light ; Mr. Talboys will follow you . I give you twenty minutes for your inspection of the paintings that is , about a minute apiece and at the end of that time I shall expect to see you return . "
29634	29644	29646	29646	Robert	155	" There are our friend 's eternal white horses , "
29653	29665	29646	29646	Robert	155	" Nicholas Poussin Salvator ha hum ! Now for the portrait . "
29681	29685	29686	29686	he	155	" George Talboys , "
29689	29770	29686	29686	he	155	" we have between us only one wax candle , a very inadequate light with which to look at a painting . Let me , therefore , request that you will suffer us to look at it one at a time ; if there is one thing more disagreeable than another , it is to have a person dodging behind your back and peering over your shoulder , when you 're trying to see what a picture 's made of . "
29861	29872	29873	29873	he	155	" Now , then , for your turn , Talboys , "
29876	29883	29873	29873	he	155	" It 's an extraordinary picture . "
30289	30302	30283	30283	Robert	155	" Why , George , I thought you had gone to sleep ! "
30303	30308	30370	30370	George	168	" I had almost . "
30309	30348	30283	30283	Robert	155	" You 've caught a cold from standing in that damp tapestried room . Mark my words , George Talboys , you 've caught a cold ; you 're as hoarse as a raven . But come along . "
30391	30394	30395	30395	she	163	" Well ? "
30400	30421	30381	30381	They	1348	" We managed it capitally . But I do n't like the portrait ; there 's something odd about it . "
30422	30426	30428	30428	Alicia	163	" There is , "
30430	30508	30428	30428	Alicia	163	" I 've a strange fancy on that point . I think that sometimes a painter is in a manner inspired , and is able to see , through the normal expression of the face , another expression that is equally a part of it , though not to be perceived by common eyes . We have never seen my lady look as she does in that picture ; but I think that she could look so . "
30509	30512	30514	30515	Robert Audley	155	" Alicia , "
30519	30525	30514	30515	Robert Audley	155	" do n't be German ! "
30526	30530	30381	30381	They	1348	" But , Robert "
30531	30576	30577	30577	He	155	" Do n't be German , Alicia , if you love me . The picture is the picture : and my lady is my lady . That 's my way of taking things , and I 'm not metaphysical ; do n't unsettle me . "
30702	30707	30708	30708	she	211	" Who is that ? "
30716	30722	30708	30708	she	211	" Is it the gardener ? "
30723	30730	30732	30732	Robert	155	" No , my dear aunt , "
30736	30744	30732	30732	Robert	155	" it is your most dutiful nephew . "
30774	30786	30788	30789	the baronet	474	" I think the storm will hold off to - night , "
30796	30805	30788	30789	the baronet	474	" but we shall certainly have it tomorrow . "
30970	30973	30975	30975	Robert	155	" George , "
30984	30992	30975	30975	Robert	155	" are you frightened of the lightning ? "
30993	30996	30997	30997	he	155	" No , "
31002	31042	30975	30975	Robert	155	" But , dear boy , some of the most courageous men have been frightened of it . It is scarcely to be called a fear : it is constitutional . I am sure you are frightened of it . "
31043	31050	30975	30975	Robert	155	" No , I am not . "
31051	31095	30975	30975	Robert	155	" But , George , if you could see yourself , white and haggard , with your great hollow eyes staring out at the sky as if they were fixed upon a ghost . I tell you I know that you are frightened . "
31096	31106	30975	30975	Robert	155	" And I tell you that I am not . "
31107	31140	30975	30975	Robert	155	" George Talboys , you are not only afraid of the lightning , but you are savage with yourself for being afraid , and with me for telling you of your fear . "
31141	31159	31161	31161	George	168	" Robert Audley , if you say another word to me , I shall knock you down , "
31322	31331	31427	31427	he	155	" Are you going to bed , George ? "
31332	31335	31302	31302	him	168	" Yes . "
31336	31343	31427	31427	he	155	" But you have no candle . "
31344	31351	31302	31302	him	168	" I do n't want one . "
31352	31385	31427	31427	he	155	" But look at your clothes , man ! Do you see the wet streaming down your coat - sleeves ? What on earth made you go out upon such a night ? "
31386	31402	31302	31302	him	168	" I am tired , and want to go to bed do n't bother me . "
31403	31417	31427	31427	he	155	" You 'll take some hot brandy - and - water , George ? "
31471	31488	31445	31445	George	168	" Let me alone , Robert Audley , and keep clear of me if you can . "
31530	31543	31545	31545	Robert	155	" He was irritated at my noticing his terror of the lightning , "
31780	31786	31787	31787	he	155	" Forgive me , Bob , "
31792	31827	31787	31787	he	155	" for my surly temper of last night . You were quite correct in your assertion ; the thunderstorm did upset me . It always had the same effect upon me in my youth . "
31828	31855	31857	31857	Robert	155	" Poor old boy ! Shall we go up by the express , or shall we stop here and dine with my uncle to - night ? "
31859	31912	31787	31787	he	155	" To tell the truth , Bob , I would rather do neither . It 's a glorious morning . Suppose we stroll about all day , take another turn with the rod and line , and go up to town by the train that leaves here at 6.15 in the evening ? "
32349	32354	32355	32355	he	474	" My pretty one , "
32358	32476	32355	32355	he	474	" my darling , what happiness to see you your own merry self again ! Do you know , Lucy , that once last night , when you looked out through the dark - green bed - curtains , with your poor , white face , and the purple rims round your hollow eyes , I had almost a difficulty to recognize my little wife in that terrified , agonized - looking creature , crying out about the storm . Thank God for the morning sun , which has brought back the rosy cheeks and bright smile ! I hope to Heaven , Lucy , I shall never again see you look as you did last night . "
32532	32547	32548	32548	she	1397	" Frightened of everything and everybody but my dear , noble , handsome husband , "
32599	32613	32614	32614	she	1397	" And they had the audacity to look at my picture , Alicia , "
32621	32643	32614	32614	she	1397	" I found the baize thrown on the ground , and a great man 's glove on the carpet . Look ! "
32644	32669	32614	32614	she	1397	" She held up a thick driving glove as she spoke . It was George 's , which he had dropped looking at the picture .
32670	32686	32687	32688	Sir Michael	160	" I shall go up to the Sun , and ask those boys to dinner , "
33379	33388	33389	33390	Lady Audley	211	" Send that horrid animal away , Alicia , "
33395	33464	33389	33390	Lady Audley	211	" The brute knows that I am frightened of him , and takes advantage of my terror . And yet they call the creatures generous and noble - hearted ! Bah , Caesar ! I hate you , and you hate me ; and if you met me in the dark in some narrow passage you would fly at my throat and strangle me , would n't you ? "
33490	33516	33477	33477	her	477	" Do you know , Lady Audley , that Mr. Talboys , the young widower , has been here asking for Sir Michael and you ? "
33524	33533	33534	33534	she	211	" I thought they were coming to dinner , "
33537	33547	33534	33534	she	211	" Surely we shall have enough of them then . "
33623	33629	33630	33630	she	211	" Take that litter away , "
33656	33666	33668	33669	my lady	477	" What have you been doing all this morning ? "
33671	33680	33668	33669	my lady	477	" Not wasting your time , I hope ? "
33681	33722	33730	33730	she	722	" No , my lady , I have been altering the blue dress . It is rather dark on this side of the house , so I took it up to my own room , and worked at the window . "
33766	33770	33776	33776	herself	477	" Phoebe Marks , "
33793	33824	33776	33776	herself	477	" you are a good , industrious girl , and while I live and am prosperous , you shall never want a firm friend or a twenty - pound note . "
34029	34043	34044	34044	he	1073	" Why , the selfish beggar must have gone home to his dinner ! "
34049	34072	34044	34044	he	1073	" and yet that is n't much like him , for he seldom remembers even his meals unless I jog his memory . "
34161	34166	34167	34167	he	155	" This is lively ! "
34170	34182	34167	34167	he	155	" A cold dinner , and nobody to eat it with ! "
34197	34229	34189	34189	himself	1460	" As fine a pair of ducks , Mr. Audley , as ever you clapped eyes on , but burnt up to a cinder , along of being kep ' hot . "
34230	34236	34237	34237	Robert	155	" Never mind the ducks , "
34241	34247	34237	34237	Robert	155	" where 's Mr. Talboys ? "
34248	34265	34189	34189	himself	1460	" He ai n't been in , sir , since you went out together this morning . "
34266	34269	34271	34271	Robert	155	" What ! "
34273	34289	34271	34271	Robert	155	" Why , in heaven 's name , what has the man done with himself ? "
34435	34454	34456	34458	Mr. Robert Audley	155	" Of all the extraordinary things that ever happened to me in the whole course of my life , "
34460	34467	34456	34458	Mr. Robert Audley	155	" this is the most miraculous ! "
34501	34510	34512	34512	Robert	155	" I shall go and look for him , "
34582	34626	34575	34576	the landlord	1125	" I forgot to tell you , Mr. Audley , as how your uncle called here five minutes after you was gone , and left a message , asking of you and the other gentleman to go down to dinner at the Court . "
34627	34634	34636	34636	Robert	155	" Then I should n't wonder , "
34638	34671	34636	34636	Robert	155	" if George Talboys has gone down to the Court to call upon my uncle . It is n't like him , but it 's just possible that he has done it . "
34727	34732	34709	34710	the servant	1435	" And not since ? "
34733	34739	34709	34710	the servant	1435	" No , not since . "
34788	34799	34801	34801	Robert	155	" Why , what can have become of the man ? "
34812	34826	34801	34801	Robert	155	" From two till six four good hours and no signs of him ! "
34900	34912	34913	34913	he	155	" I have n't walked fast since I was at Eton , "
34933	34954	34913	34913	he	155	" and the worst of it is , that I have n't the most remote idea where I am going . "
34993	34998	34999	34999	he	155	" I have it , "
35009	35014	34999	34999	he	155	" the railway station ! "
35074	35077	35049	35049	his	1500	" Private . "
35141	35157	35159	35159	Robert	155	" Do you remember the gentleman that came down to Audley with me , Smithers ? "
35161	35205	35102	35102	He	155	" Well , to tell you the real truth , Mr. Audley , I ca n't say that I do . You came by the four o'clock , if you remember , and there 's always a good many passengers by that train . "
35206	35215	35294	35295	the clerk	1500	" You do n't remember him , then ? "
35216	35224	35102	35102	He	155	" Not to my knowledge , sir . "
35225	35276	35294	35295	the clerk	1500	" That 's provoking ! I want to know , Smithers , whether he has taken a ticket for London since two o'clock to - day . He 's a tall , broad - chested young fellow , with a big brown beard . You could n't well mistake him . "
35277	35292	35294	35295	the clerk	1500	" There was four or five gentlemen as took tickets for the 3.30 up , "
35328	35347	35294	35295	the clerk	1500	" Four or five gentlemen ! But did either of them answer to the description of my friend ? "
35348	35362	35294	35295	the clerk	1500	" Well , I think one of them had a beard , sir . "
35363	35370	35294	35295	the clerk	1500	" A dark - brown beard ? "
35371	35386	35294	35295	the clerk	1500	" Well , I do n't know , but it was brownish - like . "
35387	35394	35294	35295	the clerk	1500	" Was he dressed in gray ? "
35395	35434	35294	35295	the clerk	1500	" I believe it was gray ; a great many gents wear gray . He asked for the ticket sharp and short - like , and when he 'd got it walked straight out onto the platform whistling . "
35435	35440	35442	35442	Robert	155	" That 's George , "
35444	35465	35466	35466	he	155	" Thank you , Smithers ; I need n't trouble you any more . It 's as clear as daylight , "
35475	35583	35466	35466	he	155	" he 's got one of his gloomy fits on him , and he 's gone back to London without saying a word about it . I 'll leave Audley myself to - morrow morning ; and for to - night why , I may as well go down to the Court and make the acquaintance of my uncle 's young wife . They do n't dine till seven ; if I get back across the fields I shall be in time . Bob otherwise Robert Audley this sort of thing will never do ; you are falling over head and ears in love with your aunt . "
35672	35681	35682	35682	she	477	" Thank you so much for the sables , "
35703	35723	35682	35682	she	477	" thank you for those beautiful sables . How good it was of you to get them for me . "
35761	35770	35771	35771	he	155	" Would you believe it , Sir Michael ? "
35774	35791	35771	35771	he	155	" That foolish chum of mine has gone back to London leaving me in the lurch . "
35792	35800	35806	35806	her	477	" Mr. George Talboys returned to town ? "
35809	35815	35817	35817	Alicia	163	" What a dreadful catastrophe ! "
35849	35849	35841	35841	Damon	215	"
35850	35858	35859	35859	Robert	155	" He 's a very good fellow , "
35864	35879	35859	35859	Robert	155	" and to tell the honest truth , I 'm rather uneasy about him . "
35880	35885	35886	35887	My lady	477	" Uneasy about him ! "
35901	35911	35913	35915	the young barrister	1073	" I 'll tell you why , Lady Audley , "
35917	35982	35913	35915	the young barrister	1073	" George had a bitter blow a year ago in the death of his wife . He has never got over that trouble . He takes life pretty quietly almost as quietly as I do but he often talks very strangely , and I sometimes think that one day this grief will get the better of him , and he will do something rash . "
36043	36047	36048	36048	she	211	" Dear me ! "
36051	36122	36048	36048	she	211	" this is very strange . I did not think men were capable of these deep and lasting affections . I thought that one pretty face was as good as another pretty face to them ; and that when number one with blue eyes and fair hair died , they had only to look out for number two , with dark eyes and black hair , by way of variety . "
36123	36145	36208	36208	she	477	" George Talboys is not one of those men . I firmly believe that his wife 's death broke his heart . "
36146	36150	36152	36153	Lady Audley	211	" How sad ! "
36155	36174	36152	36153	Lady Audley	211	" It seems almost cruel of Mrs. Talboys to die , and grieve her poor husband so much . "
36175	36184	36186	36186	Robert	155	" Alicia was right , she is childish , "
36229	36242	36243	36243	she	477	" I could carve a leg of mutton at Mr. Dawson 's , "
36248	36266	36243	36243	she	477	" but a leg of mutton is so easy , and then I used to stand up . "
36288	36307	36308	36308	he	160	" I am so glad to see my poor little woman in her usual good spirits once more , "
36311	36328	36308	36308	he	160	" She was very down - hearted yesterday at a disappointment she met with in London . "
36329	36333	36347	36347	my	0	" A disappointment ! "
36334	36345	36347	36348	my lady	477	" Yes , Mr. Audley , a very cruel one , "
36350	36554	36347	36348	my lady	477	" I received the other morning a telegraphic message from my dear old friend and school - mistress , telling me that she was dying , and that if I wanted to see her again , I must hasten to her immediately . The telegraphic dispatch contained no address , and of course , from that very circumstance , I imagined that she must be living in the house in which I left her three years ago . Sir Michael and I hurried up to town immediately , and drove straight to the old address . The house was occupied by strange people , who could give me no tidings of my friend . It is in a retired place , where there are very few tradespeople about . Sir Michael made inquiries at the few shops there are , but , after taking an immense deal of trouble , could discover nothing whatever likely to lead to the information we wanted . I have no friends in London , and had therefore no one to assist me except my dear , generous husband , who did all in his power , but in vain , to find my friend 's new residence . "
36555	36570	36572	36572	Robert	155	" It was very foolish not to send the address in the telegraphic message , "
36574	36591	36602	36602	her	477	" When people are dying it is not so easy to think of all these things , "
36689	36702	36703	36703	he	155	" I wish I 'd never felt any friendliness for the fellow , "
36706	36750	36703	36703	he	155	" I feel like a man who has an only son whose life has gone wrong with him . I wish to Heaven I could give him back his wife , and send him down to Ventnor to finish his days in peace . "
36879	36883	36884	36884	he	155	" George Talboys , "
36895	36900	36901	36901	she	211	" Upon my word , "
36904	36932	36901	36901	she	211	" you make me quite uncomfortable by the way in which you talk of Mr. Talboys . One would think that something extraordinary had happened to him . "
36933	36947	36967	36968	Robert Audley	155	" God forbid ! But I can not help feeling uneasy about him . "
37211	37221	37222	37222	he	155	" You have hurt your arm , Lady Audley ! "
37231	37236	37237	37237	she	477	" It is nothing , "
37240	37254	37237	37237	she	477	" I am unfortunate in having a skin which the slightest touch bruises . "
37282	37289	37290	37290	he	160	" What is it , Lucy ? "
37293	37300	37290	37290	he	160	" and how did it happen ? "
37301	37315	37317	37318	Lady Audley	211	" How foolish you all are to trouble yourselves about anything so absurd ! "
37322	37359	37317	37318	Lady Audley	211	" I am rather absent in mind , and amused myself a few days ago by tying a piece of ribbon around my arm so tightly , that it left a bruise when I removed it . "
37360	37363	37365	37365	Robert	155	" Hum ! "
37367	37400	37365	37365	Robert	155	" My lady tells little childish white lies ; the bruise is of a more recent date than a few days ago ; the skin has only just begun to change color . "
37412	37419	37420	37420	he	160	" Hold the candle , Robert , "
37423	37434	37420	37420	he	160	" and let us look at this poor little arm . "
37550	37561	37563	37563	Robert	155	" I am sure my lady must tell white lies , "
37565	37577	37563	37563	Robert	155	" for I ca n't believe the story of the ribbon . "
37614	37628	37629	37629	he	155	" If I do n't find him there I shall go to Southampton , "
37632	37641	37629	37629	he	155	" and if I do n't find him there "
37642	37646	37648	37649	my lady	477	" What then ? "
37651	37661	37629	37629	he	155	" I shall think that something strange has happened . "
37714	37718	37719	37719	he	155	" To think , "
37724	37779	37719	37719	he	155	" that it is possible to care so much for a fellow ! But come what may , I 'll go up to town after him the first thing to - morrow morning ; and , sooner than be balked in finding him , I 'll go to the very end of the world . "
38076	38093	38094	38094	he	155	" He may have slept here last night , and started for Southampton early this morning , "
38097	38114	38094	38094	he	155	" Mrs. Maloney has been here , very likely , to make everything tidy after him . "
38184	38195	38196	38196	she	1560	" Had anything happened to the poor , dear gentleman ? "
38651	38664	38665	38665	he	155	" I need scarcely ask the question that I come to ask , "
38668	38685	38665	38665	he	155	" I was in hopes I should have found your son - in - law here . "
38686	38698	38665	38665	he	155	" What ! you knew that he was coming to Southampton ? "
38699	38706	38708	38708	Robert	155	" Knew that he was coming ? "
38713	38720	38708	38708	Robert	155	" He is here , then ? "
38721	38736	38665	38665	he	155	" No , he is not here now ; but he has been here . "
38737	38740	38708	38708	Robert	155	" When ? "
38741	38752	38665	38665	he	155	" Late last night ; he came by the mail . "
38753	38759	38708	38708	Robert	155	" And left again immediately ? "
38760	38769	38665	38665	he	155	" He stayed little better than an hour . "
38770	38774	38776	38776	Robert	155	" Good Heaven ! "
38778	38797	38776	38776	Robert	155	" what useless anxiety that man has given me ! What can be the meaning of all this ? "
38798	38808	38665	38665	he	155	" You knew nothing of his intention , then ? "
38809	38814	38776	38776	Robert	155	" Of what intention ? "
38815	38826	38665	38665	he	155	" I mean of his determination to go to Australia . "
38827	38849	38776	38776	Robert	155	" I know that it was always in his mind more or less , but not more just now than usual . "
38850	38940	38665	38665	he	155	" He sails to - night from Liverpool . He came here at one o'clock this morning to have a look at the boy , he said , before he left England , perhaps never to return . He told me he was sick of the world , and that the rough life out there was the only thing to suit him . He stayed an hour , kissed the boy without awaking him , and left Southampton by the mail that starts at a quarter - past two . "
38941	38951	38953	38953	Robert	155	" What can be the meaning of all this ? "
38955	39001	38953	38953	Robert	155	" What could be his motive for leaving England in this manner , without a word to me , his most intimate friend without even a change of clothes ; for he has left everything at my chambers ? It is the most extraordinary proceeding ! "
39009	39017	39018	39018	he	5066	" Do you know , Mr. Audley , "
39026	39042	39018	39018	he	5066	" I sometimes fancy that Helen 's death had a strange effect upon poor George . "
39043	39046	39048	39048	Robert	155	" Pshaw ! "
39052	39071	39048	39048	Robert	155	" he felt the blow most cruelly , but his brain was as sound as yours or mine . "
39072	39082	39092	39092	He	1574	" Perhaps he will write to you from Liverpool , "
39110	39114	39116	39116	Robert	155	" He ought , "
39120	39150	39116	39116	Robert	155	" for we 've been good friends from the days when we were together at Eton . It is n't kind of George Talboys to treat me like this . "
39171	39178	39179	39179	he	155	" It is n't like him , "
39182	39190	39179	39179	he	155	" it is n't like George Talboys . "
39198	39204	39205	39205	he	155	" That 's my name , "
39208	39220	39205	39205	he	155	" and my papa 's name the big gentleman 's name . "
39221	39244	39278	39279	The child	997	" Yes , little Georgey , and your papa came last night and kissed you in your sleep . Do you remember ? "
39245	39248	39250	39251	the boy	1009	" No , "
39259	39277	39278	39279	The child	997	" You must have been very fast asleep , little Georgey , not to see poor papa . "
39299	39306	39295	39295	he	155	" Where 's the pretty lady ? "
39307	39312	39295	39295	he	155	" What pretty lady ? "
39313	39326	39295	39295	he	155	" The pretty lady that used to come a long while ago . "
39327	39334	39336	39338	the old man	5066	" He means his poor mamma , "
39340	39343	39345	39346	the boy	1009	" No , "
39349	39363	39345	39346	the boy	1009	" not mamma . Mamma was always crying . I did n't like mamma "
39364	39370	39295	39295	he	155	" Hush , little Georgey ! "
39371	39411	39345	39346	the boy	1009	" But I did n't , and she did n't like me . She was always crying . I mean the pretty lady ; the lady that was dressed so fine , and that gave me my gold watch . "
39412	39440	39295	39295	he	155	" He means the wife of my old captain an excellent creature , who took a great fancy to Georgey , and gave him some handsome presents . "
39441	39457	39459	39459	Georgey	201	" Where 's my gold watch ? Let me show the gentleman my gold watch , "
39461	39471	39473	39474	his grandfather	995	" It 's gone to be cleaned , Georgey , "
39476	39485	39487	39488	the boy	1009	" It 's always going to be cleaned , "
39490	39504	39506	39508	the old man	5066	" The watch is perfectly safe , I assure you , Mr. Audley , "
39537	39546	39534	39535	Captain Mortimer	221	" Watch , set with diamonds , L11 . "
39547	39561	39563	39565	the old man	5066	" I 'm often hard pressed for a few shillings , Mr. Audley , "
39567	39601	39602	39602	He	5066	" My son - in - law has been very liberal to me ; but there are others , there are others , Mr. Audley and and I 've not been treated well . "
39619	39652	39609	39609	he	5066	" Come , Georgey , it 's time the brave little man was in bed . Come along with grandpa . Excuse me for a quarter of an hour , Mr. Audley . "
39682	39720	39665	39667	the old man	5066	" This is a poor place for me to pass my declining years in , Mr. Audley . I 've made many sacrifices , and I make them still , but I 've not been treated well . "
39780	39794	39795	39795	he	155	" And to think that I should care so much for the fellow ! "
39808	39821	39822	39822	he	155	" The place smells of stale tobacco like a tap - room , "
39826	39839	39822	39822	he	155	" there can be no harm in my smoking a cigar here . "
40001	40030	39951	39951	He	155	" alboys came to last night , and left by the mail for London , on his way to Liverpool , whence he was to sail for Sydney . "
40081	40085	40086	40086	he	155	" My God ! "
40089	40111	40086	40086	he	155	" what is the meaning of this ? I shall go to Liverpool to - night , and make inquiries there ! "
40340	40352	40353	40353	he	1073	" I shall wait for to - morrow morning 's post , "
40356	40377	40353	40353	he	1073	" and if that brings no letter from George , I shall start for Liverpool without a moment 's delay . "
40878	40890	40891	40891	he	1073	" It 's that stupid Mrs. Maloney , I dare say , "
40894	40929	40891	40891	he	1073	" She may knock again for all I care . Why ca n't she use her duplicate key , instead of dragging a man out of bed when he 's half dead with fatigue . "
40961	40974	40976	40976	Robert	155	" She had her key with her all the time , then , "
40978	40989	40976	40976	Robert	155	" I 'm very glad I did n't get up . "
41027	41035	41036	41036	he	1073	" Is that you , Mrs. Maloney ? "
41039	41044	41009	41010	the laundress	1556	" Yes , sir , "
41045	41074	41009	41010	the laundress	1556	" Then why , in goodness ' name , did you make that row at the door , when you had a key with you all the time ? "
41075	41084	41009	41010	the laundress	1556	" A row at the door , sir ? "
41085	41092	41009	41010	the laundress	1556	" Yes ; that infernal knocking . "
41093	41109	41009	41010	the laundress	1556	" Sure I never knocked , Mister Audley , but walked straight in with my kay "
41110	41149	41009	41010	the laundress	1556	" Then who did knock ? There 's been some one kicking up a row at that door for a quarter of an hour , I should think ; you must have met him going down - stairs . "
41150	41182	41009	41010	the laundress	1556	" But I 'm rather late this morning , sir , for I 've been in Mr. Martin 's rooms first , and I 've come straight from the floor above . "
41183	41200	41009	41010	the laundress	1556	" Then you did n't see any one at the door , or on the stairs ? "
41201	41209	41009	41010	the laundress	1556	" Not a mortal soul , sir . "
41210	41217	41219	41219	Robert	155	" Was ever anything so provoking ? "
41221	41264	41219	41219	Robert	155	" To think that I should have let this person go away without ascertaining who he was , or what he wanted ! How do I know that it was not some one with a message or a letter from George Talboys ? "
41265	41278	41280	41281	Mrs. Maloney	217	" Sure if it was , sir , he 'll come again , "
41285	41302	41304	41304	Robert	155	" Yes , of course , if it was anything of consequence he 'll come again , "
42077	42088	42089	42089	he	1700	" Oh , by - the - by , sir , "
42092	42109	42089	42089	he	1700	" I remember one thing about this Mr. Thomas Brown his arm was in a sling . "
42216	42224	42225	42225	he	155	" George Talboys never sailed for Australia , "
42234	42262	42225	42225	he	155	" If he is alive , he is still in England ; and if he is dead , his body is hidden in some corner of England . "
42365	42394	42348	42348	he	155	" I shall draw up a record of all that has occurred between our going down to Essex and to - night , beginning at the very beginning . "
42417	42441	42395	42395	He	155	" Journal of Facts connected with the Disappearance of George Talboys , inclusive of Facts which have no apparent Relation to that Circumstance . "
42489	42494	42495	42495	he	155	" Upon my word , "
42498	42523	42495	42495	he	155	" I begin to think that I ought to have pursued my profession , instead of dawdling my life away as I have done . "
42545	42562	42524	42524	He	155	" 1 . I write to Alicia , proposing to take George down to the Court . "
42563	42581	42495	42495	he	155	" 2 . Alicia writes , objecting to the visit , on the part of Lady Audley . "
42582	42618	42524	42524	He	155	" 3 . We go to Essex in spite of that objection . I see my lady . My lady refuses to be introduced to George on that particular evening on the score of fatigue . "
42619	42635	42495	42495	he	155	" 4 . Sir Michael invites George and me to dinner for the following evening . "
42636	42654	42524	42524	He	155	" 5 . My lady receives a telegraphic dispatch the next morning which summons her to London . "
42655	42701	42495	42495	he	155	" 6 . Alicia shows me a letter from my lady , in which she requests to be told when I and my friend , Mr. Talboys , mean to leave Essex . To this letter is subjoined a postscript , reiterating the above request . "
42702	42725	42524	42524	He	155	" 7 . We call at the Court , and ask to see the house . My lady 's apartments are locked . "
42726	42762	42495	42495	he	155	" 8 . We get at the aforesaid apartments by means of a secret passage , the existence of which is unknown to my lady . In one of the rooms we find her portrait . "
42763	42785	42524	42524	He	155	" 9 . George is frightened at the storm . His conduct is exceedingly strange for the rest of the evening . "
42786	42811	42495	42495	he	155	" 10 . George quite himself again the following morning . I propose leaving Audley Court immediately ; he prefers remaining till the evening . "
42812	42829	42524	42524	He	155	" 11 . We go out fishing . George leaves me to go to the Court . "
42830	42871	42495	42495	he	155	" 12 . The last positive information I can obtain of him in Essex is at the Court , where the servant says he thinks Mr. Talboys told him he would go and look for my lady in the grounds . "
42872	42891	42524	42524	He	155	" 13 . I receive information about him at the station which may or may not be correct . "
42892	42927	42495	42495	he	155	" 14 . I hear of him positively once more at Southampton , where , according to his father - in - law , he had been for an hour on the previous night . "
42928	42935	42524	42524	He	155	" 15 . The telegraphic message . "
43075	43087	43088	43088	he	155	" It 's as dark as midnight from first to last , "
43091	43138	43088	43088	he	155	" and the clew to the mystery must be found either at Southampton or in Essex . Be it how it may , my mind is made up . I shall first go to Audley Court , and look for George Talboys in a narrow radius . "
43146	43189	43241	43242	the baronet	474	" Mr. George Talboys . Any person who has met this gentleman since the 7th inst . , or who possesses any information respecting him subsequent to that date , will be liberally rewarded on communicating with A.Z. , 14 Chancery Lane . "
43226	43239	43241	43242	the baronet	474	" Robert 's friend has not yet been heard of , then , "
43254	43259	43261	43262	my lady	477	" As for that , "
43264	43313	43261	43262	my lady	477	" I can not help wondering that any one can be silly enough to advertise for him . The young man was evidently of a restless , roving disposition a sort of Bamfyld Moore Carew of modern life , whom no attraction could ever keep in one spot . "
43387	43399	43401	43401	Alicia	163	" She is a vain , frivolous , heartless little coquette , "
43475	43475	43467	43467	I	0	"
43507	43521	43522	43523	the baronet	474	" The poor little woman is very sensitive , you know , Alicia , "
43528	43537	43522	43523	the baronet	474	" and she feels your conduct most acutely . "
43538	43549	43551	43551	Alicia	163	" I do n't believe it a bit , papa , "
43555	43624	43625	43625	she	163	" You think her sensitive because she has soft little white hands , and big blue eyes with long lashes , and all manner of affected , fantastical ways , which you stupid men call fascinating . Sensitive ! Why , I 've seen her do cruel things with those slender white fingers , and laugh at the pain she inflicted . I 'm very sorry , papa , "
43639	43757	43625	43625	she	163	" though she has come between us , and robbed poor Alicia of the love of that dear , generous heart , I wish I could like her for your sake ; but I ca n't , I ca n't , and no more can Caesar . She came up to him once with her red lips apart , and her little white teeth glistening between them , and stroked his great head with her soft hand ; but if I had not had hold of his collar , he would have flown at her throat and strangled her . She may bewitch every man in Essex , but she 'd never make friends with my dog . "
43758	43765	43767	43768	Sir Michael	160	" Your dog shall be shot , "
43771	43780	43767	43768	Sir Michael	160	" if his vicious temper ever endangers Lucy . "
43922	43982	43915	43915	she	477	" It seems very hard that you can not love me , Alicia , for I have never been used to make enemies ; but since it seems that it must be so , I can not help it . If we can not be friends , let us be neutral . You wo n't try to injure me ? "
43983	43987	43989	43989	Alicia	163	" Injure you ! "
43991	43998	43989	43989	Alicia	163	" how should I injure you ? "
43999	44013	43915	43915	she	477	" You 'll not try to deprive me of your father 's affection ? "
44014	44087	43989	43989	Alicia	163	" I may not be as amiable as you are , my lady , and I may not have the same sweet smiles and pretty words for every stranger I meet , but I am not capable of a contemptible meanness ; and even if I were , I think you are so secure of my father 's love , that nothing but your own act will ever deprive you of it . "
44088	44098	44100	44101	my lady	477	" What a severe creature you are , Alicia ! "
44108	44168	44100	44101	my lady	477	" I suppose you mean to infer by all that , that I 'm deceitful . Why , I ca n't help smiling at people , and speaking prettily to them . I know I 'm no better than the rest of the world ; but I ca n't help it if I 'm pleasantťr . It 's constitutional . "
44568	44576	44582	44582	she	477	" How I hate this desolate month ! "
44594	44676	44582	44582	she	477	" Every thing dropping to ruin and decay , and the cold flicker of the sun lighting up the ugliness of the earth , as the glare of gas - lamps lights the wrinkles of an old woman . Shall I ever grow old , Phoebe ? Will my hair ever drop off as the leaves are falling from those trees , and leave me wan and bare like them ? What is to become of me when I grow old ? "
44719	44726	44727	44727	she	477	" Do you remember , Phoebe , "
44736	45010	44727	44727	she	477	" do you remember that French story we read the story of a beautiful woman who had committed some crime I forget what in the zenith of her power and loveliness , when all Paris drank to her every night , and when the people ran away from the carriage of the king to flock about hers , and get a peep at her face ? Do you remember how she kept the secret of what she had done for nearly half a century , spending her old age in her family chateau , beloved and honored by all the province as an uncanonized saint and benefactress to the poor ; and how , when her hair was white , and her eyes almost blind with age , the secret was revealed through one of those strange accidents by which such secrets always are revealed in romances , and she was tried , found guilty , and condemned to be burned alive ? The king who had worn her colors was dead and gone ; the court of which she had been a star had passed away ; powerful functionaries and great magistrates , who might perhaps have helped her , were moldering in the graves ; brave young cavaliers , who would have died for her , had fallen upon distant battle - fields ; she had lived to see the age to which she had belonged fade like a dream ; and she went to the stake , followed by only a few ignorant country people , who forgot all her bounties , and hooted at her for a wicked sorceress . "
45011	45024	45026	45027	Phoebe Marks	177	" I do n't care for such dismal stories , my lady , "
45032	45050	45026	45027	Phoebe Marks	177	" One has no need to read books to give one the horrors in this dull place . "
45064	45073	45074	45074	she	211	" It is a dull place , Phoebe , "
45077	45152	45074	45074	she	211	" though it does n't do to say so to my dear old husband . Though I am the wife of one of the most influential men in the county , I do n't know that I was n't nearly as well off at Mr. Dawson 's ; and yet it 's something to wear sables that cost sixty guineas , and have a thousand pounds spent on the decoration of one 's apartments . "
45426	45444	45446	45447	my lady	477	" You surely are not in love with the awkward , ugly creature are you , Phoebe ? "
45507	45719	45490	45490	she	722	" I do n't think I can love him . We have been together from children , and I promised , when I was little better than fifteen , that I 'd be his wife . I dare n't break that promise now . There have been times when I 've made up the very sentence I meant to say to him , telling him that I could n't keep my faith with him ; but the words have died upon my lips , and I 've sat looking at him , with a choking sensation , in my throat that would n't let me speak . I dare n't refuse to marry him . I 've often watched and watched him , as he has sat slicing away at a hedge - stake with his great clasp - knife , till I have thought that it is just such men as he who have decoyed their sweethearts into lonely places , and murdered them for being false to their word . When he was a boy he was always violent and revengeful . I saw him once take up that very knife in a quarrel with his mother . I tell you , my lady , I must marry him . "
45720	45733	45735	45735	Lucy	211	" You silly girl , you shall do nothing of the kind ! "
45737	45857	45735	45735	Lucy	211	" You think he 'll murder you , do you ? Do you think , then , if murder is in him , you would be any safer as his wife ? If you thwarted him , or made him jealous ; if he wanted to marry another woman , or to get hold of some poor , pitiful bit of money of yours , could n't he murder you then ? I tell you you sha'n't marry him , Phoebe . In the first place I hate the man ; and , in the next place I ca n't afford to part with you . We 'll give him a few pounds and send him about his business . "
45873	45882	45883	45883	she	177	" My lady my good , kind mistress ! "
45888	45944	45883	45883	she	177	" do n't try to thwart me in this do n't ask me to thwart him . I tell you I must marry him . You do n't know what he is . It will be my ruin , and the ruin of others , if I break my word . I must marry him ! "
45945	45953	45955	45956	her mistress	1741	" Very well , then , Phoebe , "
45958	45977	45955	45956	her mistress	1741	" I ca n't oppose you . There must be some secret at the bottom of all this . "
45978	45985	45987	45988	the girl	722	" There is , my lady , "
45998	46036	45955	45956	her mistress	1741	" I shall be very sorry to lose you ; but I have promised to stand your friend in all things . What does your cousin mean to do for a living when , you are married ? "
46037	46047	45955	45956	her mistress	1741	" He would like to take a public house . "
46048	46123	45955	45956	her mistress	1741	" Then he shall take a public house , and the sooner he drinks himself to death the better . Sir Michael dines at a bachelor 's party at Major Margrave 's this evening , and my step - daughter is away with her friends at the Grange . You can bring your cousin into the drawing - room after dinner , and I 'll tell him what I mean to do for him . "
46124	46133	46134	46134	Phoebe	177	" You are very good , my lady , "
46304	46315	46316	46316	she	177	" Tell my lady how thankful you are , Luke , "
46319	46330	46332	46333	her lover	754	" But I 'm not so over and above thankful , "
46337	46358	46332	46333	her lover	754	" Fifty pound ai n't much to start a public . You 'll make it a hundred , my lady ? "
46359	46368	46370	46371	Lady Audley	211	" I shall do nothing of the kind , "
46381	46392	46373	46373	her	211	" and I wonder at your impertinence in asking it . "
46393	46403	46405	46405	Luke	178	" Oh , yes , you will , though , "
46416	46427	46405	46405	Luke	178	" You 'll make it a hundred , my lady . "
46476	46486	46458	46458	she	211	" Phoebe Marks , you have told this man ! "
46499	46508	46509	46509	she	211	" Oh , forgive me , forgive me ! "
46512	46528	46509	46509	she	211	" He forced it from me , or I would never , never have told ! "
46748	46753	46754	46768	A very dim and shadowy lady , vague of outline , and faint of coloring	1814	" quite the lady . "
47475	47484	47485	47485	he	1811	" What are you blubbering for , lass ? "
47490	47517	47485	47485	he	1811	" If you did n't want to marry me you should have told me so . I ai n't going to murder you , am I ? "
47539	47549	47551	47551	Luke	178	" You 're cold in all this here finery , "
47566	47594	47551	47551	Luke	178	" Why ca n't women dress according to their station ? You wo n't have no silk gownds out of my pocket , I can tell you . "
48451	48463	48465	48467	the young lady	1080	" You were always a poor , spiritless fellow , Bob , "
48508	48541	48495	48495	himself	155	" but this year I do n't know what has come to you . You are good for nothing but to hold a skein of silk or read Tennyson to Lady Audley . "
48542	48556	48558	48560	the young man	677	" My dear , hasty , impetuous Alicia , do n't be violent , "
48563	48628	48558	48560	the young man	677	" A conclusion is n't a five - barred gate ; and you need n't give your judgment its head , as you give your mare Atalanta hers , when you 're flying across country at the heels of an unfortunate fox . Lady Audley interests me , and my uncle 's county friends do not . Is that a sufficient answer , Alicia ? "
48639	48657	48658	48658	she	163	" It 's as good an answer as I shall ever get from , you , Bob , "
48663	48715	48658	48658	she	163	" but pray amuse yourself in your own way ; loll in an easy - chair all day , with those two absurd dogs asleep on your knees ; spoil my lady 's window - curtains with your cigars and annoy everybody in the house with your stupid , inanimate countenance . "
48800	48803	48804	48804	she	1080	" Yes , "
48807	48881	48804	48804	she	1080	" your stupid , inanimate countenance . Do you know , Robert Audley , that with all your mock amiability , you are brimful of conceit and superciliousness . You look down upon our amusements ; you lift up your eyebrows , and shrug your shoulders , and throw yourself back in your chair , and wash your hands of us and our pleasures . You are a selfish , cold - hearted Sybarite "
48882	48889	48804	48804	she	1080	" Alicia ! Good gracious me ! "
48908	49127	48900	48900	he	1930	" Yes , selfish , Robert Audley ! You take home half - starved dogs , because you like half - starved dogs . You stoop down , and pat the head of every good - for - nothing cur in the village street , because you like good - for - nothing curs . You notice little children , and give them halfpence , because it amuses you to do so . But you lift your eyebrows a quarter of a yard when poor Sir Harry Towers tells a stupid story , and stare the poor fellow out of countenance with your lazy insolence . As to your amiability , you would let a man hit you , and say ' Thank you ' for the blow , rather than take the trouble to hit him again ; but you would n't go half a mile out of your way to serve your dearest friend . Sir Harry is worth twenty of you , though he did write to ask if my m - a - i - r Atalanta had recovered from the sprain . He ca n't spell , or lift his eyebrows to the roots of his hair ; but he would go through fire and water for the girl he loves ; while you "
49184	49194	49169	49169	Robert	155	" Alicia , my darling , what is it ? "
49195	49213	49215	49216	his cousin	755	" It 's it 's it 's the feather of my hat that got into my eyes , "
49301	49305	49307	49307	Robert	155	" Good Heaven ! "
49324	49512	49307	49307	Robert	155	" What does all this mean ? How charmingly she sits her horse ! What a pretty figure , too , and a fine , candid , brown , rosy face : but to fly at a fellow like that , without the least provocation ! That 's the consequence of letting a girl follow the hounds . She learns to look at everything in life as she does at six feet of timber or a sunk fence ; she goes through the world as she goes across country straight ahead , and over everything . Such a nice girl as she might have been , too , if she 'd been brought up in Figtree Court ! If ever I marry , and have daughters which remote contingency may Heaven forefend ! they shall be educated in Paper Buildings , take their sole exercise in the Temple Gardens , and they shall never go beyond the gates till they are marriageable , when I will walk them straight across Fleet street to St. Dunstan 's church , and deliver them into the hands of their husbands . "
49609	49623	49571	49571	She	477	" You are sure my cigar does not annoy you , Lady Audley ? "
49624	49657	49675	49676	My lady	477	" Oh , no indeed ; I am quite used to the smell of tobacco . Mr. Dawson , the surgeon , smoked all the evening when I lived in his house . "
49658	49669	49670	49670	Robert	155	" Dawson is a good fellow , is n't he ? "
49685	49692	49693	49693	she	477	" The dearest of good creatures , "
49696	49831	49693	49693	she	477	" He paid me five - and - twenty pounds a year only fancy , five - and - twenty pounds ! That made six pounds five a quarter . How well I remember receiving the money six dingy old sovereigns , and a little heap of untidy , dirty silver , that came straight from the till in the surgery ! And then how glad I was to get it ! While now I ca n't help laughing while I think of it these colors I am using cost a guinea each at Winsor Newton 's the carmine and ultramarine thirty shillings . I gave Mrs. Dawson one of my silk dresses the other day , and the poor thing kissed me , and the surgeon carried the bundle home under his cloak . "
49917	49923	49924	49924	he	155	" It is a change , "
49945	49966	49924	49924	he	155	" it is a change ! Some women would do a great deal to accomplish such a change as that . "
50072	50091	50092	50092	he	155	" My friend at the corner of Chancery Lane has not given me such good Manillas as usual , "
50095	50128	50092	50092	he	155	" If ever you smoke , my dear aunt and I am told that many women take a quiet weed under the rose , be very careful how you choose your cigars . "
50149	50168	50138	50138	her	477	" What an eccentric creature you are , Mr. Audley I Do you know that you sometimes puzzle me "
50169	50180	50129	50129	My	0	" Not more than you puzzle me , dear aunt . "
50347	50352	50353	50353	she	211	" That Mr. George George "
50358	50361	50363	50363	Robert	155	" Talboys , "
50365	50404	50443	50444	my lady	477	" Yes , to be sure Mr. George Talboys . Rather a singular name , by - the - by , and certainly , by all accounts , a very singular person . Have you seen him lately ? "
50405	50436	50443	50444	my lady	477	" I have not seen him since the 7th of September last the day upon which he left me asleep in the meadows on the other side of the village . "
50437	50441	50443	50444	my lady	477	" Dear me ! "
50446	50467	50443	50444	my lady	477	" what a very strange young man this Mr. George Talboys must be ! Pray tell me all about it . "
50537	50547	50549	50550	my lady	477	" And what do you infer from all this ? "
50556	50566	50567	50567	he	677	" It is so great a mystery to me , "
50570	50603	50567	50567	he	677	" that I scarcely dare to draw any conclusion whatever ; but in the obscurity I think I can grope my way to two suppositions , which to me seem almost certainties . "
50604	50608	50549	50550	my lady	477	" And they are "
50609	50631	50567	50567	he	677	" First , that George Talboys never went beyond Southampton . Second , that he never went to Southampton at all . "
50632	50649	50549	50550	my lady	477	" But you traced him there . His father - in - law had seen him . "
50650	50665	50567	50567	he	677	" I have reason to doubt his father - in - law 's integrity . "
50666	50671	50673	50674	my lady	477	" Good gracious me ! "
50678	50687	50673	50674	my lady	477	" What do you mean by all this ? "
50688	50692	50694	50696	the young man	677	" Lady Audley , "
50700	50796	50694	50696	the young man	677	" I have never practiced as a barrister . I have enrolled myself in the ranks of a profession , the members of which hold solemn responsibilities and have sacred duties to perform ; and I have shrunk from those responsibilities and duties , as I have from all the fatigues of this troublesome life . But we are sometimes forced into the very position we have most avoided , and I have found myself lately compelled to think of these things . Lady Audley , did you ever study the theory of circumstantial evidence ? "
50797	50811	50813	50814	my lady	477	" How can you ask a poor little woman about such horrid things ? "
50816	50820	50822	50824	the young man	677	" Circumstantial evidence , "
50835	51019	50828	50828	he	677	" that wonderful fabric which is built out of straws collected at every point of the compass , and which is yet strong enough to hang a man . Upon what infinitesimal trifles may sometimes hang the whole secret of some wicked mystery , inexplicable heretofore to the wisest upon the earth ! A scrap of paper , a shred of some torn garment , the button off a coat , a word dropped incautiously from the overcautious lips of guilt , the fragment of a letter , the shutting or opening of a door , a shadow on a window - blind , the accuracy of a moment tested by one of Benson 's watches a thousand circumstances so slight as to be forgotten by the criminal , but links of iron in the wonderful chain forged by the science of the detective officer ; and lo ! the gallows is built up ; the solemn bell tolls through the dismal gray of the early morning , the drop creaks under the guilty feet , and the penalty of crime is paid . "
51098	51107	51109	51110	Robert Audley	155	" The radius grows narrower day by day , "
51112	51119	51109	51110	Robert Audley	155	" George Talboys never reached Southampton . "
51585	51639	51576	51577	Sir Michael	160	" Stay , my dear boy ; stay , my dear Bob , as long as ever you like . I have no son , and you stand to me in the place of one . Make yourself agreeable to Lucy , and make the Court your home as long as you live . "
51658	51664	51642	51642	Robert	155	" a jolly old prince . "
51689	51695	51685	51685	he	677	" a jolly old prince ; "
51886	51898	51899	51899	he	230	" What a fool I am to feel it like this ! "
51910	52020	51899	51899	he	230	" I always knew it would be so ; I always knew that she was a hundred times too good for me . God bless her ! How nobly and tenderly she spoke ; how beautiful she looked with the crimson blushes under her brown skin , and the tears in her big , gray eyes almost as handsome as the day she took the sunk fence , and let me put the brush in her hat as we rode home ! God bless her ! I can get over anything as long as she does n't care for that sneaking lawyer . But I could n't stand that . "
52101	52104	52105	52105	he	155	" Yes , "
52108	52135	52105	52105	he	155	" Norwich is in Norfolk , and that fool , young Vincent , said it was in Herefordshire . Ha , Alicia , is that you ? "
52152	52155	52157	52158	his cousin	755	" Yes , "
52166	52174	52157	52158	his cousin	755	" Alicia , you have been crying . "
52184	52218	52175	52177	The young lady	1080	" You have been crying , Alicia . Sir Harry Towers , of Towers Park , in the county of Herts , has been making you an offer of his hand , eh ? "
52219	52231	52157	52158	his cousin	755	" Have you been listening at the door , Mr. Audley ? "
52232	52290	52175	52177	The young lady	1080	" I have not , Miss Audley . On principle , I object to listen , and in practice I believe it to be a very troublesome proceeding ; but I am a barrister , Miss Alicia , and able to draw a conclusion by induction . Do you know what inductive evidence is , Miss Audley ? "
52291	52294	52296	52296	Alicia	163	" No , "
52314	52443	52296	52296	Alicia	163	" I thought not . I dare say Sir Harry would ask if it was a new kind of horse - ball . I knew by induction that the baronet was going to make you an offer ; first , because he came downstairs with his hair parted on the wrong side , and his face as pale as a tablecloth ; secondly , because he could n't eat any breakfast , and let his coffee go the wrong way ; and , thirdly , because he asked for an interview with you before he left the Court . Well , how 's it to be , Alicia ? Do we marry the baronet , and is poor Cousin Bob to be the best man at the wedding ? "
52444	52456	52458	52458	Alicia	163	" Sir Harry Towers is a noble - hearted young man , "
52467	52524	52296	52296	Alicia	163	" But do we accept him yes or no ? Are we to be Lady Towers , with a superb estate in Hertfordshire , summer quarters for our hunters , and a drag with outriders to drive us across to papa 's place in Essex ? Is it to be so , Alicia , or not ? "
52525	52536	52538	52538	Alicia	163	" What is that to you , Mr. Robert Audley ? "
52542	52632	52538	52538	Alicia	163	" What do you care what becomes of me , or whom I marry ? If I married a chimney - sweep you 'd only lift up your eyebrows and say , ' Bless my soul , she was always eccentric . ' I have refused Sir Harry Towers ; but when I think of his generous and unselfish affection , and compare it with the heartless , lazy , selfish , supercilious indifference of other men , I 've a good mind to run after him and tell him "
52633	52645	52666	52666	his	155	" That you 'll retract , and be my Lady Towers ? "
52646	52649	52538	52538	Alicia	163	" Yes . "
52650	52660	52662	52663	Robert Audley	155	" Then do n't , Alicia , do n't , "
52680	52727	52662	52663	Robert Audley	155	" Come into the drawing - room with me , Alicia , my poor little cousin ; my charming , impetuous , alarming little cousin . Sit down here in this mullioned window , and let us talk seriously and leave off quarreling if we can . "
52780	52786	52788	52788	Robert	155	" My poor little Alicia , "
52802	52958	52788	52788	Robert	155	" do you suppose that because people do n't wear vinegar tops , or part their hair on the wrong side , or conduct themselves altogether after the manner of well - meaning maniacs , by way of proving the vehemence of their passion do you suppose because of this , Alicia Audley , that they may not be just as sensible of the merits of a dear little warm - hearted and affectionate girl as ever their neighbors can be ? Life is such a very troublesome matter , when all is said and done , that it 's as well even to take its blessings quietly . I do n't make a great howling because I can get good cigars one door from the corner of Chancery Lane , and have a dear , good girl for my cousin ; but I am not the less grateful to Providence that it is so . "
53003	53016	53018	53019	Miss Audley	163	" Is this all you have to say to me , Robert ? "
53023	53032	53034	53035	her cousin	759	" Well , yes , I think so , "
53041	53120	53034	53035	her cousin	759	" I fancy that what I wanted to say was this do n't marry the fox - hunting baronet if you like anybody else better ; for if you 'll only be patient and take life easily , and try and reform yourself of banging doors , bouncing in and out rooms , talking of the stables , and riding across country , I 've no doubt the person you prefer will make you a very excellent husband . "
53121	53127	53129	53130	Miss Audley	163	" Thank you , cousin , "
53148	53174	53129	53130	Miss Audley	163	" but as you may not know the person I prefer , I think you had better not take upon yourself to answer for him . "
53186	53193	53194	53194	he	155	" No , to be sure , "
53201	53216	53194	53194	he	155	" Of course , if I do n't know him I thought I did . "
53217	53221	53223	53223	Alicia	163	" Did you ? "
53247	53257	53258	53258	Robert	155	" I only said I thought I knew him , "
53280	53294	53276	53276	he	155	" Such a nice girl , too , if she did n't bounce . "
53461	53481	53483	53485	the young baronet	2046	" What 's the good of being rich if one has no one to help spend one 's money ? "
53487	53533	53483	53485	the young baronet	2046	" One only grows a selfish beggar , and takes to drinking too much port . It 's a hard thing that a girl can refuse a true heart and such stables as we 've got at the park . It unsettles a man somehow . "
53689	53696	53685	53685	he	155	" Haw , to be sure ! "
53698	53703	53685	53685	he	155	" By Jove hum ! "
53767	53770	53771	53771	he	155	" Yes , "
53780	53884	53885	53886	the baronet	474	" I know I 'm a good match , and I know what makes the gals so civil . They 're very pretty , and they 're very friendly to a fellow ; but I do n't care about 'em . They 're all alike they can only drop their eyes and say , ' Lor ' , Sir Harry , why do you call that curly black dog a retriever ? ' or ' Oh Sir Harry , and did the poor mare really sprain her pastern shoulder - blade ? ' I have n't got much brains myself , I know , "
53891	53928	53885	53886	the baronet	474	" and I do n't want a strong - minded woman , who writes books and wears green spectacles ; but , hang it ! I like a gal who knows what she 's talking about . "
53933	53936	53931	53931	Alicia	163	" No , "
54007	54015	54016	54016	he	160	" I 'm very sorry , Towers , "
54019	54052	54016	54016	he	160	" You 're as good a fellow as ever breathed , and would have made my girl an excellent husband ; but you know there 's a cousin , and I think that "
54053	54062	54064	54067	the fox - hunter	2060	" Do n't say that , Sir Michael , "
54071	54168	54064	54067	the fox - hunter	2060	" I can get over anything but that . A fellow whose hand upon the curb weighs half a ton why , he pulled the Cavalier 's mouth to pieces , sir , the day you let him ride the horse ; a fellow who turns his collars down , and eats bread and marmalade ! No , no , Sir Michael ; it 's a queer world , but I ca n't think that of Miss Audley . There must be some one in the background , sir ; it ca n't be the cousin . "
54181	54189	54190	54190	he	160	" I do n't know about that , "
54193	54229	54190	54190	he	160	" Bob 's a good lad , and the girl might do worse ; but he hangs back as if he did n't care for her . There 's some mystery there 's some mystery ! "
54343	54361	54362	54362	she	2066	" So the last of our visitors is gone , dear , and we 're all alone , "
54365	54371	54362	54362	she	2066	" Is n't that nice ? "
54372	54377	54378	54378	he	2062	" Yes , darling , "
54387	54405	54362	54362	she	2066	" Except Mr. Robert Audley . How long is that nephew of yours going to stay here ? "
54406	54421	54423	54424	the baronet	474	" As long as he likes , my pet ; he 's always welcome , "
54439	54475	54434	54434	he	474	" But not unless his visit is agreeable to you , darling ; not if his lazy habits , or his smoking , or his dogs , or anything about him is displeasing to you . "
54490	54496	54497	54497	she	211	" It is n't that , "
54502	54538	54497	54497	she	211	" Mr. Audley is a very agreeable young man , and a very honorable young man ; but you know , Sir Michael , I 'm rather a young aunt for such a nephew , and "
54539	54545	54547	54548	the baronet	474	" And what , Lucy ? "
54552	54589	54497	54497	she	211	" Poor Alicia is rather jealous of any attention Mr. Audley pays me , and and I think it would be better for her happiness if your nephew were to bring his visit to a close . "
54590	54600	54602	54603	Sir Michael	160	" He shall go to - night , Lucy , "
54605	54665	54602	54603	Sir Michael	160	" I am a blind , neglectful fool not to have thought of this before . My lovely little darling , it was scarcely just to Bob to expose the poor lad to your fascinations . I know him to be as good and true - hearted a fellow as ever breathed , but but he shall go tonight . "
54666	54683	54497	54497	she	211	" But you wo n't be too abrupt , dear ? You wo n't be rude ? "
54684	54719	54602	54603	Sir Michael	160	" Rude ! No , Lucy . I left him smoking in the lime - walk . I 'll go and tell him that he must get out of the house in an hour . "
54804	54813	54814	54814	he	160	" I have been attentive to my lady , "
54817	54822	54814	54814	he	160	" She interests me ; "
54854	54899	54841	54841	he	160	" God forbid , my dear uncle , that I should ever bring trouble upon such a noble heart as yours ! God forbid that the slightest shadow of dishonor should ever fall upon your honored head least of all through agency of mine . "
55397	55403	55361	55362	Phoebe Marks	177	" You know Audley Court ? "
55404	55409	55361	55362	Phoebe Marks	177	" Yes , mum . "
55410	55443	55361	55362	Phoebe Marks	177	" If you 'll run there with this letter to - night , and see that it 's put safely in Lady Audley 's hands , I 'll give you a shilling . "
55444	55449	55361	55362	Phoebe Marks	177	" Yes , mum . "
55450	55492	55361	55362	Phoebe Marks	177	" You understand ? Ask to see my lady ; you can say you 've a message not a note , mind but a message from Phoebe Marks ; and when you see her , give this into her own hand . "
55493	55498	55361	55362	Phoebe Marks	177	" Yes , mum . "
55499	55505	55361	55362	Phoebe Marks	177	" You wo n't forget ? "
55506	55511	55361	55362	Phoebe Marks	177	" No , mum . "
55512	55519	55361	55362	Phoebe Marks	177	" Then be off with you . "
55573	55585	55586	55586	she	177	" If there 's any bad meaning in his coming here , "
55589	55603	55586	55586	she	177	" my lady will know of it in time , at any rate . "
55740	55743	55744	55744	he	155	" That , "
55747	55757	55744	55744	he	155	" is a woman who could keep a secret . "
55795	55808	55810	55810	Robert	155	" Will you pour out my tea for me , Mrs. Marks ? "
55840	55851	55856	55856	she	177	" You have come straight from the Court , sir ? "
55864	55877	55856	55856	she	177	" Yes ; I only left my uncle 's an hour ago . "
55878	55890	55856	55856	she	177	" And my lady , sir , was she quite well ? "
55891	55897	55856	55856	she	177	" Yes , quite well . "
55898	55910	55856	55856	she	177	" As gay and light - hearted as ever , sir ? "
55911	55921	55856	55856	she	177	" As gay and light - hearted as ever . "
55950	55966	55967	55967	he	155	" You knew Lady Audley when she was Miss Lucy Graham , did you not ? "
55970	55988	55856	55856	she	177	" Yes , sir . I lived at Mrs. Dawson 's when my lady was governess there . "
55989	56001	55946	55946	he	155	" Indeed ! Was she long in the surgeon 's family ? "
56002	56011	55856	55856	she	177	" A year and a half , sir . "
56012	56019	55946	55946	he	155	" And she came from London ? "
56020	56025	55856	55856	she	177	" Yes , sir . "
56026	56036	55946	55946	he	155	" And she was an orphan , I believe ? "
56037	56042	55856	55856	she	177	" Yes , sir . "
56043	56052	55946	55946	he	155	" Always as cheerful as she is now ? "
56053	56058	55856	55856	she	177	" Always , sir . "
56088	56100	56101	56101	he	155	" This woman would be good in a witness - box , "
56104	56120	56101	56101	he	155	" it would take a clever lawyer to bother her in a cross - examination . "
56178	56201	56203	56203	Robert	155	" There 's a triangular draught from those two windows and the door that scarcely adds to the comfort of this apartment , "
56205	56225	56203	56203	Robert	155	" and there certainly are pleasantťr sensations than that of standing up to one 's knees in cold water . "
56289	56292	56293	56293	he	155	" No , "
56298	56322	56293	56293	he	155	" that is a woman who can keep a secret . A counsel for the prosecution could get very little out of her . "
56421	56428	56430	56430	Robert	155	" The man is a fool , "
56439	56453	56430	56430	Robert	155	" I 'll go and talk to him by - and - by . "
56663	56680	56682	56682	Robert	155	" I have come in for a few minutes ' chat before I go to bed , "
56693	56715	56716	56716	he	155	" Would you object to a cigar , Mrs. Marks ? I mean , of course , to my smoking one , "
56721	56728	56716	56716	he	155	" Not at all , sir . "
56729	56748	56750	56751	Mr. Marks	178	" It would be a good ' un her objectin ' to a bit o ' ' bacca , "
56753	56763	56750	56751	Mr. Marks	178	" when me and the customers smokes all day . "
56796	56811	56812	56812	he	155	" I want you to tell me all about Mount Stanning , Mr. Marks , "
56817	56825	56827	56827	Luke	178	" Then that 's pretty soon told , "
56836	56911	56912	56912	he	155	" Of all the dull holes as ever a man set foot in , this is about the dullest . Not that the business do n't pay pretty tidy ; I do n't complain of that ; but I should ha ' liked a public at Chelmsford , or Brentwood , or Romford , or some place where there 's a bit of life in the streets ; and I might have had it , "
56917	56927	56912	56912	he	155	" if folks had n't been so precious stingy . "
56950	56961	56962	56962	she	177	" We forgot the brew - house door , Luke , "
56965	56979	56962	56962	she	177	" Will you come with me and help me put up the bar ? "
56980	56993	56995	56996	Mr. Marks	178	" The brew - house door can bide for to - night , "
56998	57017	56995	56996	Mr. Marks	178	" I ai n't agoin ' to move now . I 've seated myself for a comfortable smoke . "
57041	57056	57058	57059	his wife	563	" I do n't feel easy about that brew - house door , Luke , "
57061	57081	57058	57059	his wife	563	" there are always tramps about , and they can get in easily when the bar is n't up . "
57082	57097	57099	57100	Mr. Marks	178	" Go and put the bar up yourself , then , ca n't you ? "
57102	57112	57058	57059	his wife	563	" It 's too heavy for me to lift . "
57113	57208	57058	57059	his wife	563	" Then let it bide , if you 're too fine a lady to see to it yourself . You 're very anxious all of a sudden about this here brew - house door . I suppose you do n't want me to open my mouth to this here gent , that 's about it . Oh , you need n't frown at me to stop my speaking ! You 're always putting in your tongue and clipping off my words before I 've half said 'em ; but I wo n't stand it . "
57209	57220	57221	57222	Phoebe Marks	177	" Do you hear ? I wo n't stand it ! "
57260	57273	57275	57275	Robert	155	" Then you do n't particularly care to live at Mount Stanning ? "
57287	57294	57296	57296	Luke	178	" No , I do n't , "
57298	57372	57296	57296	Luke	178	" and I do n't care who knows it ; and , as I said before , if folks had n't been so precious stingy , I might have had a public in a thrivin ' market town , instead of this tumble - down old place , where a man has his hair blowed off his head on a windy day . What 's fifty pound , or what 's a hundred pound "
57373	57378	57443	57443	his	155	" Luke ! Luke ! "
57379	57399	57401	57402	Mr. Marks	178	" No , you 're not goin' to stop my mouth with all your ' Luke , Lukes ! ' "
57409	57420	57401	57402	Mr. Marks	178	" I say again , what 's a hundred pound ? "
57421	57424	57426	57427	Robert Audley	155	" No , "
57451	57484	57443	57443	his	155	" What , indeed , is a hundred pounds to a man possessed of the power which you hold , or rather which your wife holds , over the person in question . "
57526	57532	57534	57534	Robert	155	" A quarter to twelve , "
57541	57584	57508	57509	Robert Audley	155	" Late hours for such a quiet village as Mount Stanning . Good - night , my worthy host . Good - night , Mrs. Marks . You need n't send me my shaving water till nine o'clock to - morrow morning . "
57762	57765	57766	57766	he	155	" Lively , "
57769	57781	57766	57766	he	155	" for a man used to the fascinations of Temple Bar . "
57813	57835	57836	57836	he	155	" I wonder what unhappy wretch has too restless a spirit to stop at home on such a morning as this , "
57870	57881	57883	57883	Robert	155	" Lady Audley ! Pray beg her to come in , "
57905	57922	57900	57900	he	155	" A false move , my lady , and one I never looked for from you . "
58074	58082	58083	58083	she	477	" What a morning , Mr. Audley ! "
58086	58091	58083	58083	she	477	" what a morning ! "
58092	58106	58126	58126	my	0	" Yes , indeed ! Why did you come out in such weather ? "
58107	58116	58083	58083	she	477	" Because I wished to see you particularly . "
58117	58120	58126	58126	my	0	" Indeed ! "
58121	58124	58141	58141	her	477	" Yes , "
58152	58189	58083	58083	she	477	" yes , Mr. Audley , I felt that you had not been well treated ; that that you had , in short , reason to complain ; and that an apology was due to you . "
58190	58202	58083	58083	she	477	" I do not wish for any apology , Lady Audley . "
58203	58211	58213	58214	my lady	477	" But you are entitled to one , "
58218	58308	58213	58214	my lady	477	" Why , my dear Robert , should we be so ceremonious toward each other ? You were very comfortable at Audley ; we were very glad to have you there ; but , my dear , silly husband must needs take it into his foolish head that it is dangerous for his poor little wife 's peace of mind to have a nephew of eight or nine and twenty smoking his cigars in her boudoir , and , behold ! our pleasant little family circle is broken up . "
58336	58340	58341	58341	he	155	" Lady Audley , "
58344	58388	58341	58341	he	155	" Heaven forbid that either you or I should ever bring grief or dishonor upon my uncle 's generous heart ! Better , perhaps , that I should be out of the house better , perhaps , that I had never entered it ! "
58438	58450	58451	58451	he	155	" Oh , pray do not be alarmed , Lady Audley , "
58456	58543	58451	58451	he	155	" You have no sentimental nonsense , no silly infatuation , borrowed from Balzac or Dumas fils , to fear from me . The benchers of the Inner Temple will tell you that Robert Audley is troubled with none of the epidemics whose outward signs are turn - down collars and Byronic neckties . I say that I wish I had never entered my uncle 's house during the last year ; but I say it with a far more solemn meaning than any sentimental one . "
58550	58562	58563	58563	she	477	" If you insist on talking in enigmas , Mr. Audley , "
58566	58581	58547	58547	her	477	" you must forgive a poor little woman if she declines to answer them . "
58590	58595	58597	58598	my lady	477	" But tell me , "
58607	58621	58597	58598	my lady	477	" what could have induced you to come up to this dismal place ? "
58622	58625	58597	58598	my lady	477	" Curiosity . "
58626	58629	58597	58598	my lady	477	" Curiosity ? "
58630	58673	58597	58598	my lady	477	" Yes ; I felt an interest in that bull - necked man , with the dark - red hair and wicked gray eyes . A dangerous man , my lady a man in whose power I should not like to be . "
58710	58721	58722	58722	she	211	" What have I done to you , Robert Audley , "
58726	58740	58722	58722	she	211	" what have I done to you that you should hate me so ? "
58747	58780	58741	58741	He	2163	" I had a friend , Lady Audley , whom I loved very dearly , and since I have lost him I fear that my feelings toward other people are strangely embittered . "
58781	58792	58741	58741	He	2163	" You mean the Mr. Talboys who went to Australia ? "
58793	58817	58741	58741	He	2163	" Yes , I mean the Mr. Talboys who I was told set out for Liverpool with the idea of going to Australia . "
58818	58831	58741	58741	He	2163	" And you do not believe in his having sailed for Australia ? "
58832	58837	58741	58741	He	2163	" I do not . "
58838	58843	58741	58741	He	2163	" But why not ? "
58844	58859	58741	58741	He	2163	" Forgive me , Lady Audley , if I decline to answer that question . "
58860	58865	58866	58866	she	2164	" As you please , "
58871	58879	58881	58881	Robert	155	" A week after my friend disappeared , "
58883	58993	58881	58881	Robert	155	" I posted an advertisement to the Sydney and Melbourne papers , calling upon him if he was in either city when the advertisement appeared , to write and tell me of his whereabouts , and also calling on any one who had met him , either in the colonies or on the voyage out , to give me any information respecting him . George Talboys left Essex , or disappeared from Essex , on the 6th of September last . I ought to receive some answer to this advertisement by the end of this month . To - day is the 27th ; the time draws very near . "
58994	59002	59004	59005	Lady Audley	211	" And if you receive no answer ? "
59007	59033	58741	58741	He	2163	" If I receive no answer I shall think that my fears have been not unfounded , and I shall do my best to act . "
59034	59042	58741	58741	He	2163	" What do you mean by that ? "
59043	59250	58741	58741	He	2163	" Ah , Lady Audley , you remind me how very powerless I am in this matter . My friend might have been made away with in this very inn , and I might stay here for a twelvemonth , and go away at the last as ignorant of his fate as if I had never crossed the threshold . What do we know of the mysteries that may hang about the houses we enter ? If I were to go to - morrow into that commonplace , plebeian , eight - roomed house in which Maria Manning and her husband murdered their guest , I should have no awful prescience of that bygone horror . Foul deeds have been done under the most hospitable roofs ; terrible crimes have been committed amid the fairest scenes , and have left no trace upon the spot where they were done . I do not believe in mandrake , or in bloodstains that no time can efface . I believe rather that we may walk unconsciously in an atmosphere of crime , and breathe none the less freely . I believe that we may look into the smiling face of a murderer , and admire its tranquil beauty . "
59259	59273	59274	59274	she	477	" You seem to have quite a taste for discussing these horrible subjects , "
59280	59291	59274	59274	she	477	" you ought to have been a detective police officer . "
59292	59304	58741	58741	He	2163	" I sometimes think I should have been a good one . "
59305	59308	59274	59274	she	477	" Why ? "
59309	59315	58741	58741	He	2163	" Because I am patient . "
59316	59345	59274	59274	she	477	" But to return to Mr. George Talboys , whom we lost sight of in your eloquent discussion . What if you receive no answer to your advertisements ? "
59346	59360	58741	58741	He	2163	" I shall then consider myself justified in concluding my friend is dead . "
59361	59367	59274	59274	she	477	" Yes , and then ? "
59368	59380	58741	58741	He	2163	" I shall examine the effects he left at my chambers . "
59381	59403	59405	59406	Lady Audley	211	" Indeed ! and what are they ? Coats , waistcoats , varnished boots , and meerschaum pipes , I suppose , "
59410	59430	58741	58741	He	2163	" No ; letters letters from his friends , his old schoolfellows , his father , his brother officers . "
59431	59434	58741	58741	He	2163	" Yes ? "
59435	59444	58741	58741	He	2163	" Letters , too , from his wife . "
59460	59476	59477	59477	she	477	" Have you ever seen any of the letters written by the late Mrs. Talboys ? "
59481	59530	58741	58741	He	2163	" Never . Poor soul ! her letters are not likely to throw much light upon my friend 's fate . I dare say she wrote the usual womanly scrawl . There are very few who write so charming and uncommon a hand as yours , Lady Audley . "
59531	59542	59554	59554	My	0	" Ah , you know my hand , of course . "
59543	59553	58741	58741	He	2163	" Yes , I know it very well indeed . "
59584	59596	59597	59597	she	477	" You have refused to accept my apology , Mr. Audley , "
59600	59616	59597	59597	she	477	" but I trust you are not the less assured of my feelings toward you . "
59617	59624	59554	59554	My	0	" Perfectly assured , Lady Audley . "
59625	59659	59597	59597	she	477	" Then good - by , and let me recommend you not to stay long in this miserable draughty place , if you do not wish to take rheumatism back to Figtree Court . "
59660	59676	59554	59554	My	0	" I shall return to town to - morrow morning to see after my letters . "
59677	59685	59597	59597	she	477	" Then once more good - by . "
59812	59823	59824	59824	he	2168	" Have you taken Lady Audley back to the Court ? "
59843	59867	59824	59824	he	2168	" No , sir ; I 've just come from the Brentwood station . My lady started for London by the 12.40 train . "
59868	59872	59824	59824	he	2168	" For town ? "
59873	59878	59824	59824	he	2168	" Yes , sir . "
59879	59886	59888	59888	Robert	155	" My lady gone to London ! "
59900	59927	59888	59888	Robert	155	" Then I 'll follow her by the next train ; and if I 'm not very much mistaken , I know where to find her . "
60175	60274	60163	60164	the barrister	1039	" Perhaps , when that gentleman who is making such a noise about a pointer with liver - colored spots , has discovered the particular pointer and spots that he wants which happy combination of events scarcely seems likely to arrive they 'll give me my luggage and let me go . The designing wretches knew at a glance that I was born to be imposed upon ; and that if they were to trample the life out of me upon this very platform , I should never have the spirit to bring an action against the company . "
60410	60416	60417	60417	she	2192	" I beg your pardon , "
60446	60454	60443	60443	she	2192	" Robert , you in London already ? "
60455	60475	60443	60443	she	2192	" Yes , Lady Audley ; you were quite right ; the Castle Inn is a dismal place , and "
60476	60503	60443	60443	she	2192	" You got tired of it I knew you would . Please open the carriage door for me : the train will start in two minutes . "
60521	60527	60528	60528	he	155	" What does it mean ? "
60531	60582	60528	60528	he	155	" She is altogether a different being to the wretched , helpless creature who dropped her mask for a moment , and looked at me with her own pitiful face , in the little room at Mount Stanning , four hours ago . What has happened to cause the change ? "
60627	60640	60641	60641	she	1633	" Thank you very much ; how good you are to me , "
60649	60723	60641	60641	she	1633	" You will think me very foolish to travel upon such a day , without my dear darling 's knowledge too ; but I went up to town to settle a very terrific milliner 's bill , which I did not wish my best of husbands to see ; for , indulgent as he is , he might think me extravagant ; and I can not bear to suffer even in his thoughts . "
60724	60735	60736	60736	Robert	155	" Heaven forbid that you ever should , Lady Audley , "
60760	60767	60768	60768	she	2199	" Heaven forbid it , indeed , "
60771	60780	60768	60768	she	2199	" I do n't think I ever shall . "
60807	60819	60820	60820	he	155	" Whatever object brought her to London has been successfully accomplished , "
60823	60881	60820	60820	he	155	" Has she baffled me by some piece of womanly jugglery ? Am I never to get any nearer to the truth , but am I to be tormented all my life by vague doubts , and wretched suspicions , which may grow upon me till I become a monomaniac ? Why did she come to London ? "
61197	61201	61180	61180	She	2214	" the master , "
61207	61244	61180	61180	She	2214	" I only sent for you to ask if anybody has been here ; that is to say , if anybody has applied to you for the key of my rooms to - day any lady ? "
61245	61271	61180	61180	She	2214	" Lady ? No , indeed , yer honor ; there 's been no lady for the kay ; barrin ' it 's the blacksmith . "
61272	61276	61180	61180	She	2214	" The blacksmith ! "
61277	61291	61180	61180	She	2214	" Yes ; the blacksmith your honor ordered to come to - day . "
61292	61298	61300	61300	Robert	155	" I order a blacksmith ! "
61302	61314	61315	61315	he	155	" I left a bottle of French brandy in the cupboard , "
61318	61328	61315	61315	he	155	" and Mrs. M. has been evidently enjoying herself . "
61329	61344	61346	61347	Mrs. Maloney	217	" Sure , and the blacksmith your honor tould to see to the locks , "
61349	61366	61367	61367	she	217	" It 's him that lives down in one of the little streets by the bridge , "
61389	61402	61403	61403	he	155	" If you 'll sit down and compose yourself , Mrs. M. , "
61419	61441	61403	61403	he	155	" perhaps we shall be able by and by to understand each other . You say a blacksmith has been here ? "
61442	61450	61403	61403	he	155	" Sure and I did , sir . "
61451	61456	61403	61403	he	155	" To - day ? "
61457	61463	61403	61403	he	155	" Quite correct , sir . "
61579	61594	61595	61596	Mr. Audley	155	" But you were with him while he examined the locks , I suppose ? "
61599	61645	61595	61596	Mr. Audley	155	" Sure I was , sir , in and out , as you may say , all the time , for I 've been cleaning the stairs this afternoon , and I took the opportunity to begin my scouring while the man was at work . "
61646	61694	61552	61553	Mrs. Maloney	217	" Oh , you were in and out all the time . If you could conveniently give me a plain answer , Mrs. M. , I should be glad to know what was the longest time that you were out while the locksmith was in my chambers ? "
61753	61760	61763	61763	she	217	" thim stairs , your honor ; "
61797	61804	61805	61805	he	155	" Never mind , Mrs. M. , "
61808	61834	61805	61805	he	155	" the locksmith had plenty of time to do anything he wanted to do , I dare say , without your being any the wiser . "
61847	61871	61835	61836	Mrs. Maloney	217	" Sure , there was n't anything for him to stale , your honor , barrin ' the birds and the geran'ums , and "
61872	61903	61960	61961	The Irishwoman	2226	" No , no , I understand . There , that 'll do , Mrs. M. Tell me where the man lives , and I 'll go and see him . "
61904	61917	61835	61836	Mrs. Maloney	217	" But you 'll have a bit of dinner first , sir ? "
61918	61932	61933	61933	He	551	" I 'll go and see the locksmith before I have my dinner . "
61950	61959	61933	61933	He	551	" The man 's address , Mrs. M ? "
62059	62062	62057	62057	Robert	155	" Hulloa ! "
62284	62289	62290	62290	he	6092	" And with that , "
62304	62304	62290	62290	he	6092	"
62362	62372	62373	62373	Robert	155	" You called at my chambers to - day , "
62378	62388	62373	62373	Robert	155	" Do n't let me disturb you , ladies . "
62396	62410	62373	62373	Robert	155	" You called at my chambers to - day , Mr. White , and "
62416	62434	62435	62435	he	644	" I hope , sir , you will be so good as to look over the mistake , "
62438	62548	62435	62435	he	644	" I 'm sure , sir , I 'm very sorry it should have occurred . I was sent for to another gentleman 's chambers , Mr. Aulwin , in Garden Court ; and the name slipped my memory ; and havin' done odd jobs before for you , I thought it must be you as wanted me to - day ; and I called at Mrs. Maloney 's for the key accordin ' ; but directly I see the locks in your chambers , I says to myself , the gentleman 's locks ai n't out of order ; the gentleman do n't want all his locks repaired . "
62549	62557	62411	62412	The man	644	" But you stayed half an hour . "
62558	62631	62435	62435	he	644	" Yes , sir ; for there was one lock out of order the door nighest the staircase and I took it off and cleaned it and put it on again . I wo n't charge you nothin' for the job , and I hope as you 'll be as good as to look over the mistake as has occurred , which I 've been in business thirteen years come July , and "
62632	62644	62646	62646	Robert	155	" Nothing of this kind ever happened before , I suppose , "
62650	62716	62646	62646	Robert	155	" No , it 's altogether a singular kind of business , not likely to come about every day . You 've been enjoying yourself this evening I see , Mr. White . You 've done a good stroke of work to - day , I 'll wager made a lucky hit , and you 're what you call ' standing treat , ' eh ? "
62769	62773	62764	62764	Hamlet	246	" is common ; "
62804	62807	62794	62794	he	244	" missus , "
62869	62875	62876	62876	he	155	" Pray do n't apologize , "
62879	62900	62876	62876	he	155	" I like to see people enjoy themselves . Good - night , Mr. White good - night , ladies . "
62906	62910	62903	62903	his	155	" the missus , "
62935	62939	62940	62940	he	155	" And so , "
62952	63054	62940	62940	he	155	" ' with that she walked off as graceful as you please . 'Who was it that walked off ; and what was the story which the locksmith was telling when I interrupted him at that sentence ? Oh , George Talboys , George Talboys , am I ever to come any nearer to the secret of your fate ? Am I coming nearer to it now , slowly but surely ? Is the radius to grow narrower day by day until it draws a dark circle around the home of those I love ? How is it all to end ? "
63155	63181	63182	63182	he	155	" Her cutlets a la Maintenon made mutton seem more than mutton ; a sublimated meat that could scarcely have grown upon any mundane sheep , "
63186	63207	63182	63182	he	155	" and Mrs. Maloney 's chops are apt to be tough ; but such is life what does it matter ? "
63220	63237	63238	63238	he	155	" I have never eaten a good dinner at this table since I lost George Talboys , "
63241	63322	63238	63238	he	155	" The place seems as gloomy as if the poor fellow had died in the next room , and had never been taken away to be buried . How long ago that September afternoon appears as I look back at it that September afternoon upon which I parted with him alive and well ; and lost him as suddenly and unaccountably as if a trap - door had opened in the solid earth and let him through to the antipodes ! "
63404	63410	63411	63411	he	155	" Heaven help us all , "
63415	63433	63411	63411	he	155	" is this paper with which no attorney has had any hand to be my first brief ? "
63529	63547	63549	63549	Robert	155	" There 'd be no need for any one to break open such a lock as this , "
63909	63916	63917	63917	he	155	" I will keep these out , "
63920	63933	63917	63917	he	155	" there may be something to help me in one of them . "
64152	64156	64169	64170	Mrs. Maloney	217	" Cousine Bette . "
64243	64252	64253	64253	he	155	" Why do I go on with this , "
64256	64509	64253	64253	he	155	" when I know that it is leading me , step by step , day by day , hour by hour , nearer to that conclusion which , of all others , I should avoid ? Am I tied to a wheel , and must I go with its every revolution , let it take me where it will ? Or can I sit down here to - night and say I have done my duty to my missing friend , I have searched for him patiently , but I have searched in vain ? Should I be justified in doing this ? Should I be justified in letting the chain which I have slowly put together , link by link , drop at this point , or must I go on adding fresh links to that fatal chain until the last rivet drops into its place and the circle is complete ? I think , and I believe , that I shall never see my friend 's face again ; and that no exertion of mine can ever be of any benefit to him . In plainer , crueler words I believe him to be dead . Am I bound to discover how and where he died ? or being , as I think , on the road to that discovery , shall I do a wrong to the memory of George Talboys by turning back or stopping still ? What am I to do ? what am I to do ? "
64672	64679	64680	64680	he	2291	" Justice to the dead first , "
64683	64690	64680	64680	he	2291	" mercy to the living afterward . "
65429	65437	65439	65441	the young man	677	" I thought it would be so , "
65451	65490	65439	65441	the young man	677	" God knows I was prepared for the worst , and the worst has come . I can understand all now . My next visit must be to Southampton . I must place the boy in better hands . "
65876	65887	65888	65888	he	155	" I will run into Dorsetshire after I leave Southampton , "
65891	66002	65888	65888	he	155	" and see this man . If he is content to let his son 's fate rest a dark and cruel mystery to all who knew him if he is content to go down to his grave uncertain to the last of this poor fellow 's end why should I try to unravel the tangled skein , to fit the pieces of the terrible puzzle , and gather together the stray fragments which , when collected , may make such a hideous whole ? I will go to him and lay my darkest doubts freely before him . It will be for him to say what I am to do . "
66150	66166	66167	66167	he	1073	" Who would have thought that I could have grown so fond of the fellow , "
66170	66264	66167	66167	he	1073	" or feel so lonely without him ? I 've a comfortable little fortune in the three per cents . ; I 'm heir presumptive to my uncle 's title ; and I know of a certain dear little girl who , as I think , would do her best to make me happy ; but I declare that I would freely give up all , and stand penniless in the world to - morrow , if this mystery could be satisfactorily cleared away , and George Talboys could stand by my side . "
66647	66661	66662	66662	he	155	" The poor child shall not sleep another night in this wretched hovel , "
66677	66698	66666	66666	he	155	" He is the legacy of my best friend , and it shall be my business to secure his safety . "
67149	67159	67160	67160	she	968	" Mr. Maldon is not at home , sir , "
67167	67184	67160	67160	she	968	" but if it 's for the water - rate , he requested me to say that "
67213	67218	67219	67219	he	168	" I know you , "
67222	67266	67219	67219	he	168	" you came to Ventnor with the big gentleman , and you came here once , and you gave me some money , and I gave it to gran'pa to take care of , and gran'pa kept it , and he always does . "
67287	67293	67294	67294	he	155	" Stand there , Georgey , "
67297	67308	67294	67294	he	155	" I want to have a good look at you . "
67331	67354	67355	67355	he	155	" You are growing more like your father every day , Georgey ; and you 're growing quite a man , too , "
67358	67367	67355	67355	he	155	" would you like to go to school ? "
67368	67382	67383	67384	the boy	1009	" Oh , yes , please , I should like it very much , "
67389	67544	67383	67384	the boy	1009	" I went to school at Miss Pevins ' once day - school , you know round the corner in the next street ; but I caught the measles , and gran'pa would n't let me go any more , for fear I should catch the measles again ; and gran'pa wo n't let me play with the little boys in the street , because they 're rude boys ; he said blackguard boys ; but he said I must n't say blackguard boys , because it 's naughty . He says damn and devil , but he says he may because he 's old . I shall say damn and devil when I 'm old ; and I should like to go to school , please , and I can go to - day , if you like ; Mrs. Plowson will get my frocks ready , wo n't you , Mrs. Plowson ? "
67545	67557	67558	67559	the woman	968	" Certainly , Master Georgey , if your grandpapa wishes it , "
67570	67581	67583	67583	Robert	155	" What on earth is the matter with this woman , "
67616	67678	67607	67609	little George Talboys	168	" Does she still take me for a tax - collector with inimical intentions toward these wretched goods and chattels ; or can the cause of her fidgety manner lie deeper still . That 's scarcely likely , though ; for whatever secrets Lieutenant Maldon may have , it 's not very probable that this woman has any knowledge of them . "
67709	67720	67721	67721	he	155	" What are you going to do with the child ? "
67724	67746	67748	67749	the woman	968	" I was only going to take him away to wash his pretty face , sir , and smooth his hair , "
67767	67801	67748	67749	the woman	968	" You do n't see him to any advantage , sir , while his precious face is dirty . I wo n't be five minutes making him as neat as a new pin . "
67832	67845	67846	67846	he	155	" I 'd rather see him as he is , thank you , "
67849	67873	67846	67846	he	155	" My time in Southampton is n't very long , and I want to hear all that the little man can tell me . "
67892	67899	67900	67900	he	1039	" I like you very much , "
67903	67931	67900	67900	he	1039	" I was frightened of you when you came before , because I was shy . I am not shy now I am nearly six years old . "
67976	67991	67993	67993	Robert	155	" You 're rather fidgety about some one , ma'am , I 'm afraid , "
68013	68023	68024	68024	she	2403	" I was looking for Mr. Maldon , sir , "
68027	68040	68024	68024	she	2403	" he 'll be so disappointed if he does n't see you . "
68041	68050	68058	68059	The boy	1009	" You know who I am , then ? "
68051	68057	68024	68024	she	2403	" No , sir , but "
68077	68088	68089	68089	he	155	" This is the watch the pretty lady gave me , "
68092	68180	68089	68089	he	155	" I 've got it now but I have n't had it long , because the jeweler who cleans it is an idle man , gran'pa says , and always keeps it such a long time ; and gran'pa says it will have to be cleaned again , because of the taxes . He always takes it to be cleaned when there 's taxes but he says if he were to lose it the pretty lady would give me another . Do you know the pretty lady ? "
68181	68192	68202	68202	She	255	" No , Georgey , but tell me about her . "
68243	68253	68254	68254	he	155	" The boy will do very well , ma'am , "
68257	68292	68254	68254	he	155	" if you 'll be good enough to let him alone for five minutes . Now , Georgey , suppose you sit on my knee , and tell me all about the pretty lady . "
68321	68332	68333	68333	he	155	" I 'll tell you all about the pretty lady , "
68336	68392	68394	68395	the boy	1009	" because I like you very much . Gran'pa told me not to tell anybody , but I 'll tell you , you know , because I like you , and because you 're going to take me to school . The pretty lady came here one night long ago oh , so long ago , "
68415	68485	68486	68486	Georgey	201	" She came when I was not nearly so big as I am now and she came at night after I 'd gone to bed , and she came up into my room , and sat upon the bed , and cried and she left the watch under my pillow , and she Why do you make faces at me , Mrs. Plowson ? I may tell this gentleman , "
68520	68540	68542	68543	Robert Audley	155	" Suppose you wait till I say so , ma'am , before you stop the little fellow 's mouth , "
68547	68582	68542	68543	Robert Audley	155	" A suspicious person might think from your manner that Mr. Maldon and you had some conspiracy between you , and that you were afraid of what the boy 's talk may let slip . "
68650	68659	68660	68660	he	155	" Do n't be cross to Mrs. Plowson , "
68663	68696	68660	68660	he	155	" Mrs. Plowson is very kind to me . Mrs. Plowson is Matilda 's mother . You do n't know Matilda . Poor Matilda was always crying ; she was ill , she "
68785	68799	68800	68800	he	5066	" You 're a prett ' creature to call yoursel ' sensible woman ? "
68803	68870	68871	68873	the old man	5066	" Why do n't you take th ' chile ' way , er wash 's face ? D'yer want to ruin me ? D'yer want to ' stroy me ? Take th ' chile ' way ! Mr. Audley , sir , I 'm ver ' glad to see yer ; ver ' ' appy to ' ceive yer in m ' humbl ' ' bode , "
68897	68905	68907	68907	Robert	155	" Whatever this man 's secrets are , "
68921	68981	68910	68911	Mrs. Plowson	255	" that woman has no unimportant share of them . Whatever the mystery may be , it grows darker and thicker at every step ; but I try in vain to draw back or to stop short upon the road , for a stronger hand than my own is pointing the way to my lost friend 's unknown grave . "
68992	69007	69008	69008	Robert	155	" I am going to take your grandson away with me , Mr. Maldon , "
69101	69106	69107	69107	he	5066	" Yes , yes , "
69112	69128	69107	69107	he	5066	" take the boy away from his poor old grandfather ; I always thought so . "
69129	69140	69202	69202	he	2376	" You always thought that I should take him away ? "
69152	69162	69202	69202	he	2376	" Why did you think so , Mr. Maldon ? "
69185	69193	69180	69181	the lieutenant	2376	" Thought so 'cause I thought so . "
69213	69227	69202	69202	he	2376	" Because I thought you or his father would fetch ' m away . "
69228	69251	69202	69202	he	2376	" When I was last in this house , Mr. Maldon , you told me that George Talboys had sailed for Australia . "
69252	69262	69263	69265	the old man	5066	" Yes , yes I know , I know , "
69281	69316	69263	69265	the old man	5066	" I know ; but he might have come back might n't he ? He was restless , and and queer in his mind , perhaps , sometimes . He might have come back . "
69433	69437	69438	69438	he	5066	" Mr. Maldon , "
69452	69500	69438	69438	he	5066	" George Talboys never sailed for Australia that I know . More than this , he never came to Southampton ; and the lie you told me on the 8th of last September was dictated to you by the telegraphic message which you received on that day . "
69550	69611	69531	69531	he	5066	" The lie was dictated to you , and you repeated your lesson . But you no more saw George Talboys here on the 7th of September than I see him in this room now . You thought you had burnt the telegraphic message , but you had only burnt a part of it the remainder is in my possession . "
69619	69625	69626	69626	he	258	" What have I done ? "
69631	69642	69626	69626	he	258	" Oh , my God ! what have I done ? "
69643	69654	69612	69613	Lieutenant Maldon	258	" At two o'clock on the 7th of September last , "
69662	69676	69612	69613	Lieutenant Maldon	258	" George Talboys was seen alive and well at a house in Essex . "
69728	69736	69738	69739	Robert Audley	155	" At two o'clock on that day , "
69741	69824	69738	69739	Robert Audley	155	" my poor friend was seen alive and well at , at the house of which I speak . From that hour to this I have never been able to hear that he has been seen by any living creature . I have taken such steps as must have resulted in procuring the information of his whereabouts , were he alive . I have done this patiently and carefully at first , even hopefully . Now I know that he is dead . "
69870	69879	69881	69882	the lieutenant	2376	" No , no , no , no , "
69893	69954	69881	69882	the lieutenant	2376	" no , no ! For God 's sake , do n't say that ! Do n't think it do n't let me think it do n't let me dream of it ! Not dead anything but dead ! Hidden away , perhaps bribed to keep out of the way , perhaps ; but not dead not dead not dead ! "
70003	70007	70009	70009	Robert	155	" I believe , "
70019	70038	70009	70009	Robert	155	" that my friend left Essex ; and I believe he died on the 7th of September last . "
70069	70081	70082	70082	he	5066	" Oh ! no , no for God 's , no ! "
70086	70105	70082	70082	he	5066	" No ! you do n't know what you say you do n't know what your words mean ! "
70106	70131	70163	70163	he	2442	" I know their weight and value only too well as well as I see you do , Mr. Maldon . God help us ! "
70132	70145	70147	70149	the old man	5066	" Oh , what am I doing ? what am I doing ? "
70216	70261	70211	70211	he	2442	" You have no right to come here and terrify a man who has been drinking , and who is not quite himself . You have no right to do it , Mr. Audley . Even the the officer , sir , who who . "
70286	70303	70304	70304	He	2442	" The officer , I repeat , sir , who arrests a thief , or a . "
70327	70333	70334	70334	His	2442	" A thief or a murderer "
70362	70453	70359	70359	he	2442	" Gives him warning , sir , fair warning , that he may say nothing which shall commit himself or or other people . The the law , sir , has that amount of mercy for a a suspected criminal . But you , sir , you come to my house , and you come at a time when when contrary to my usual habits which , as people will tell you , are sober you take the opportunity to terrify me and it is not right , sir it is "
70573	70580	70581	70581	he	155	" If I had known this , "
70584	70604	70581	70581	he	155	" I might have spared him . It would have been better , perhaps , to have spared him . "
70744	70753	70754	70754	he	155	" Why do I go on with this ? "
70757	70800	70754	70754	he	155	" how pitiless I am , and how relentlessly I am carried on . It is not myself ; it is the hand which is beckoning me further and further upon the dark road , whose end I dare not dream of . "
70837	70841	70842	70843	Robert Audley	155	" Mr. Maldon , "
70850	70896	70897	70897	he	155	" I do not ask you to forgive me for what I have brought upon you , for the feeling is strong within me that it must have come to you sooner or later if not through me , through some one else . There are "
70935	71274	70842	70843	Robert Audley	155	" There are some things which , as people say , can not be hidden . I think there is truth in that common saying which had its origin in that old worldly wisdom which people gathered from experience and not from books . If if I were content to let my friend rest in his hidden grave , it is but likely that some stranger who had never heard the name of George Talboys , might fall by the remotest accident upon the secret of his death . To - morrow , perhaps ; or ten years hence , or in another generation , when the the hand that wronged him is as cold as his own . If I could let the matter rest ; if if I could leave England forever , and purposely fly from the possibility of ever coming across another clew to the secret , I would do it I would gladly , thankfully do it but I can not ! A hand which is stronger than my own beckons me on . I wish to take no base advantage of you , less than of all other people ; but I must go on ; I must go on . If there is any warning you would give to any one , give it . If the secret toward which I am traveling day by day , hour by hour , involves any one in whom you have an interest , let that person fly before I come to the end . Let them leave this country ; let them leave all who know them all whose peace their wickedness has endangered ; let them go away they shall not be pursued . But if they slight your warning if they try to hold their present position in defiance of what it will be in your power to tell them let them beware of me , for , when the hour comes , I swear that I will not spare them . "
71296	71308	71309	71309	he	5066	" I declare to you that I do not understand you , "
71312	71335	71309	71309	he	5066	" I solemnly declare to you that I can not understand ; and I do not believe that George Talboys is dead . "
71336	71353	71355	71355	Robert	155	" I would give ten years of my own life if I could see him alive , "
71359	71376	71355	71355	Robert	155	" I am sorry for you , Mr. Maldon I am sorry for all of us . "
71377	71392	71394	71395	the lieutenant	2376	" I do not believe that my son - in - law is dead , "
71397	71409	71394	71395	the lieutenant	2376	" I do not believe that the poor lad is dead . "
71477	71482	71484	71485	Mrs. Plowson	255	" Dear heart alive ! "
71487	71511	71484	71485	Mrs. Plowson	255	" what has the poor old gentleman been taking on about ? We could hear him in the passage , sobbin ' awful . "
71532	71539	71540	71540	he	2376	" Do n't cry , gran'pa , "
71543	71615	71617	71618	the boy	1009	" do n't cry . You shall have my watch to be cleaned , and the kind jeweler shall lend you the money to pay the taxman while he cleans the watch I do n't mind , gran'pa . Let 's go to the jeweler , the jeweler in High street , you know , with golden balls painted upon his door , to show that he comes from Lombar Lombardshire , "
71627	71632	71617	71618	the boy	1009	" Come , gran'pa . "
71666	71673	71674	71674	he	1012	" There are wolves at Southampton , "
71686	71714	71674	71674	he	1012	" My gran'pa says when he takes my watch that he does it to keep the wolf from the door . Are there wolves where you live ? "
71739	71753	71754	71754	he	1012	" Your grandpapa does not want the watch to - day , Georgey , "
71759	71767	71769	71769	Georgey	201	" Why is he sorry , then ? "
71773	71790	71791	71792	the boy	1009	" when he wants the watch he is always sorry , and beats his poor forehead so "
71800	71907	71791	71792	the boy	1009	" and says that she the pretty lady , I think he means uses him very hard , and that he ca n't keep the wolf from the door ; and then I say , ' Gran'pa , have the watch ; ' and then he takes me in his arms , and says , ' Oh , my blessed angel ! how can I rob my blessed angel ? ' and then he cries , but not like to - day not loud , you know ; only tears running down his poor cheeks , not so that you could hear him in the passage . "
71978	71984	71985	71985	she	255	" Poor dear old gentleman , "
71992	72001	71985	71985	she	255	" What has happened to upset him so ? "
72002	72012	72014	72015	Mr. Audley	155	" His son - in - law is dead , "
72027	72051	72021	72022	Mrs. Plowson	255	" He died , within a year and a half after the death of Helen Talboys , who lies burried in Ventnor churchyard . "
72096	72102	72103	72103	she	255	" Poor Mr. Talboys dead ! "
72106	72115	72103	72103	she	255	" that is bad news indeed , sir . "
72131	72136	72137	72137	he	262	" Who 's dead ? "
72140	72151	72137	72137	he	262	" George Talboys is my name . Who 's dead ? "
72152	72162	72116	72117	Little George	262	" Another person whose name is Talboys , Georgey . "
72163	72176	72137	72137	he	262	" Poor person ! Will he go to the pit - hole ? "
72213	72227	72228	72228	Georgey	201	" I should like to see him put in the pit - hole , "
72292	72308	72310	72311	Robert Audley	155	" You have no objection to my taking Georgey away with me , Mr. Maldon ? "
72355	72364	72326	72326	He	155	" You do not object , Mr. Maldon ? "
72365	72533	72326	72326	He	155	" No , sir no , sir ; you are his guardian , and you have a right to take him where you please . He has been a very great comfort to me in my lonely old age , but I have been prepared to lose him . I I may not have always done my duty to him , sir , in in the way of schooling , and and boots . The number of boots which boys of his age wear out , sir , is not easily realized by the mind of a young man like yourself ; he has been kept away from school , perhaps , sometimes , and occasionally worn shabby boots when our funds have got low ; but he has not been unkindly treated . No , sir ; if you were to question him for a week , I do n't think you 'd hear that his poor old grandfather ever said a harsh word to him . "
72562	72566	72568	72569	Robert Audley	155	" Mr. Maldon , "
72584	72675	72676	72676	he	2480	" when I looked at my position last night , I did not believe that I could ever come to think it more painful than I thought it then . I can only say God have mercy upon us all . I feel it my duty to take the child away , but I shall take him straight from your house to the best school in Southampton ; and I give you my honor that I will extort nothing from his innocent simplicity which can in any manner I mean , "
72683	72729	72676	72676	he	2480	" I mean this . I will not seek to come one step nearer the secret through him . I I am not a detective officer , and I do not think the most accomplished detective would like to get his information from a child . "
72760	72769	72770	72770	he	2480	" Take the boy away , Mrs. Plowson , "
72777	72794	72770	72770	he	2480	" take him away and put his things on . He is going with Mr. Audley . "
72795	72817	72818	72819	Mrs. Plowson	255	" Which I do say that it 's not kind of the gentleman to take his poor grandpa 's pet away , "
72828	72834	72835	72837	the old man	5066	" Hush , Mrs. Plowson , "
72842	72865	72835	72837	the old man	5066	" Mr. Audley is the best judge . I I have n't many years to live ; I sha'n't trouble anybody long . "
72889	72901	72902	72902	he	5066	" God knows , I never injured your friend , sir , "
72919	72996	72998	73000	the old man	5066	" nor even wished him any ill . He was a good son - in - law to me better than many a son . I never did him any wilful wrong , sir . I I spent his money , perhaps , but I am sorry for it I am very sorry for it now . But I do n't believe he is dead no , sir ; no , I do n't believe it ! "
73018	73035	72998	73000	the old man	5066	" I I do n't believe it , sir ! How how should he be dead ? "
73125	73135	73136	73136	he	5066	" Do n't be sorry for me , gran'pa , "
73139	73168	73169	73169	he	5066	" I am going to school to learn to be a clever man , and I shall come home to see you and Mrs. Plowson , sha'n't I ? "
73176	73188	73169	73169	he	5066	" Yes , my dear , by - and - by . "
73189	73199	73201	73202	Mr. Maldon	195	" Take him away , sir take him away , "
73204	73211	73201	73202	Mr. Maldon	195	" you are breaking my heart . "
73681	73700	73701	73701	he	264	" I 've a vague recollection of getting a good deal of bread and milk and boiled mutton , "
73704	73729	73701	73701	he	264	" and I 've another vague recollection of not liking them . I wonder if this boy likes bread and milk and boiled mutton . "
73752	73762	73763	73763	he	264	" I dare say you 're hungry , Georgey ? "
73794	73802	73803	73804	Mr. Audley	155	" Perhaps you 'd like some lunch ? "
73818	73821	73822	73822	he	1009	" Lunch ! "
73825	73839	73822	73822	he	1009	" Why , it 's afternoon , and I 've had my dinner . "
73866	73877	73878	73878	he	264	" You shall have some bread and milk , Georgey , "
73883	73896	73878	73878	he	264	" Waiter , bread and milk , and a pint of hock . "
73904	73912	73913	73913	he	264	" I never have bread and milk , "
73916	73981	73982	73982	he	264	" I do n't like it . I like what gran'pa calls something savory . I should like a veal cutlet . Gran'pa told me he dined here once , and the veal cutlets were lovely , gran'pa said . Please may I have a veal cutlet , with egg and bread - crumb , you know , and lemon - juice you know ? "
73988	74029	74031	74032	Master Georgey	201	" Gran'pa knows the cook here . The cook 's such a nice gentleman , and once gave me a shilling , when gran'pa brought me here . The cook wears better clothes than gran'pa better than yours , even , "
74076	74091	74092	74092	he	201	" I 'll tell you what I 'll do with you , little Georgey , "
74098	74106	74175	74175	you	889	" I 'll give you a dinner ! "
74112	74119	74120	74120	he	201	" Upon my word , sir , "
74125	74138	74120	74120	he	201	" I think the little gentleman will know how to eat it . "
74139	74149	74151	74151	Robert	155	" I 'll give you a dinner , Georgey , "
74182	74182	74175	74175	you	889	"
74183	74202	74204	74205	the waiter	889	" I do n't think the young gentleman will object to it when he sees it , sir , "
74207	74232	74204	74205	the waiter	889	" Eels , Julienne , cutlets , bird , pudding I 'll go and tell the cook , sir . What time , sir ? "
74233	74314	74175	74175	you	889	" Well , we 'll say six , and Master Georgey will get to his new school by bedtime . You can contrive to amuse the child for this afternoon , I dare say . I have some business to settle , and sha'n't be able to take him out . I shall sleep here to - night . Good - by , Georgey ; take care of yourself and try and get your appetite in order against six o'clock . "
74403	74413	74414	74414	he	155	" I shall start early to - morrow morning , "
74417	74455	74414	74414	he	155	" and see George 's father before nightfall . I will tell him all all but the interest which I take in in the suspected person , and he shall decide what is next to be done . "
74552	74564	74565	74565	he	155	" I 'm glad I 'm going to have new clothes , "
74576	74599	74565	74565	he	155	" for Mrs. Plowson has mended the old ones ever so many times . She can have them now , for Billy . "
74600	74605	74606	74606	Robert	155	" Who 's Billy ? "
74616	74640	74565	74565	he	155	" Billy is poor Matilda 's little boy . He 's a common boy , you know . Matilda was common , but she "
75452	75469	75470	75471	Mr. Talboys	256	" My son did me an unpardonable wrong by marrying the daughter of a drunken pauper , "
75488	75574	75475	75486	any one who had the temerity to speak to him about George	2569	" and from that hour I had no longer a son . I wish him no ill . He is simply dead to me . I am sorry for him , as I am sorry for his mother who died nineteen years ago . If you talk to me of him as you would talk of the dead , I shall be ready to hear you . If you speak of him as you would speak of the living , I must decline to listen . "
75651	75681	75682	75684	the young man	677	" If I write to him , he will fold my letter with the envelope inside , and indorse it with my name and the date of its arrival , "
75688	75754	75682	75684	the young man	677	" and call everybody in the house to witness that it had not moved him to one softening recollection or one pitiful thought . He will stick to his resolution to his dying day . I dare say , if the truth was known , he is glad that his only son has offended him and given him the opportunity of parading his Roman virtues . "
75776	75781	75782	75782	he	168	" No my darling , "
75788	75869	75782	75782	he	168	" It 's very hard , perhaps , to be poor , but we will bear it . We wo n't go with pitiful faces to the stern father , and ask him to give us food and shelter , only to be refused in long , Johnsonian sentences , and made a classical example for the benefit of the neighborhood . No , my pretty one ; it is easy to starve , but it is difficult to stoop . "
75969	75977	75978	75978	she	563	" I thought dragoons were always rich , "
75985	76047	75978	75978	she	563	" Girls always want to marry dragoons ; and tradespeople always want to serve dragoons ; and hotel - keepers to entertain dragoons ; and theatrical managers to be patronized by dragoons . Who could have ever expected that a dragoon would drink sixpenny ale , smoke horrid bird's - eye tobacco , and let his wife wear a shabby bonnet ? "
76663	76673	76674	76674	Robert	155	" If the man is anything like his house , "
76677	76689	76674	76674	Robert	155	" I do n't wonder that poor George and he parted . "
76969	76979	76980	76980	he	2623	" If you will step this way , sir , "
76983	77012	76980	76980	he	2623	" Mr. Talboys will see you , although he is at breakfast . He begged me to state that everybody in Dorsetshire was acquainted with his breakfast hour . "
77052	77060	77061	77061	he	2623	" I do n't belong to Dorsetshire , "
77064	77092	77061	77061	he	2623	" Mr. Talboys might have known that , if he 'd done me the honor to exercise his powers of ratiocination . Drive on , my friend . "
77454	77458	77459	77459	he	155	" His sister ! "
77487	77515	77459	77459	he	155	" His sister , no doubt . He was fond of her , I know . Surely , she is not utterly indifferent as to his fate ? "
77566	77572	77578	77579	Mr. Talboys	256	" Sit down , Clara , "
77643	77649	77650	77650	he	847	" Sit down , Clara , "
77653	77662	77650	77650	he	847	" and keep your cotton in your workbox . "
77725	77734	77735	77735	he	847	" Perhaps , Mr. , Mr. Robert Audley ! "
77751	77781	77735	77735	he	847	" perhaps when you have finished looking for reels of cotton , you will be good enough to tell me to what I owe the honor of this visit ? "
77860	77867	77869	77870	Mr. Talboys	256	" You may remain , Wilson , "
77880	77888	77869	77870	Mr. Talboys	256	" Mr. Audley would perhaps like coffee . "
77938	77948	77950	77954	the master of the house	2616	" Mr. Audley will not take coffee , Wilson , "
77956	77961	77950	77954	the master of the house	2616	" You may go . "
78141	78153	78154	78154	he	256	" I wrote to you some time since , Mr. Talboys , "
78237	78246	78247	78247	he	155	" I received your communication , Mr. Audley , "
78250	78263	78247	78247	he	155	" It is among other business letters : it was duly answered . "
78264	78271	78287	78287	Robert	155	" That letter concerned your son . "
78318	78336	78338	78339	Mr. Audley	155	" She 's as heartless as her father , I expect , though she is like George , "
78341	78358	78360	78361	Harcourt Talboys	256	" If your letter concerned the person who was once my son , perhaps , sir , "
78363	78378	78360	78361	Harcourt Talboys	256	" I must ask you to remember that I have no longer a son . "
78379	78393	78395	78395	Robert	155	" You have no reason to remind me of that , Mr. Talboys , "
78399	78432	78395	78395	Robert	155	" I remember it only too well . I have fatal reason to believe that you have no longer a son . I have bitter cause to think that he is dead . "
78467	78470	78471	78471	he	155	" No , "
78474	78483	78471	78471	he	155	" no , I assure you , no . "
78484	78497	78471	78471	he	155	" I believe that George Talboys died in the month of September . "
78564	78573	78575	78576	Mr. Talboys	256	" No , no , I assure you , "
78578	78586	78575	78576	Mr. Talboys	256	" you labor under a sad mistake . "
78587	78600	78602	78602	Robert	155	" You believe that I am mistaken in thinking your son dead ? "
78604	78608	78610	78611	Mr. Talboys	256	" Most certainly , "
78624	78777	78610	78611	Mr. Talboys	256	" Most certainly , my dear sir . The disappearance was a very clever trick , no doubt , but it was not sufficiently clever to deceive me . You must permit me to understand this matter a little better than you , Mr. Audley , and you must also permit me to assure you of three things . In the first place , your friend is not dead . In the second place , he is keeping out of the way for the purpose of alarming me , of trifling with my feelings as a as a man who was once his father , and of ultimately obtaining my forgiveness . In the third place , he will not obtain that forgiveness , however long he may please to keep out of the way ; and he would therefore act wisely by returning to his ordinary residence and avocations without delay . "
78778	78797	78602	78602	Robert	155	" Then you imagine him to purposely hide himself from all who know him , for the purpose of "
78798	78806	78808	78809	Mr. Talboys	256	" For the purpose of influencing me , "
78845	78941	78943	78944	Mr. Talboys	256	" For the purpose of influencing me . He knew the inflexibility of my character ; to a certain degree he was acquainted with me , and knew that all attempts at softening my decision , or moving me from the fixed purpose of my life , would fail . He therefore tried extraordinary means ; he has kept out of the way in order to alarm me , and when after due time he discovers that he has not alarmed me , he will return to his old haunts . When he does so , "
78950	79029	78943	78944	Mr. Talboys	256	" I will forgive him . Yes , sir , I will forgive him . I shall say to him : You have attempted to deceive me , and I have shown you that I am not to be deceived ; you have tried to frighten me , and I have convinced you that I am not to be frightened ; you did not believe in my generosity , I will show you that I can be generous . "
79061	79079	79080	79080	he	155	" Heaven grant that you may have an opportunity of saying this to your son , sir , "
79084	79141	79142	79142	he	155	" I am very glad to find that you are willing to forgive him , but I fear that you will never see him again upon this earth . I have a great deal to say to you upon this this sad subject , Mr. Talboys ; but I would rather say it to you alone , "
79153	79166	79168	79169	Harcourt Talboys	256	" My daughter knows my ideas upon this subject , Mr. Audley , "
79171	79195	79196	79196	he	155	" there is no reason why she should not hear all you have to say . Miss Clara Talboys , Mr. Robert Audley , "
79217	79223	79224	79224	he	155	" Let her hear it , "
79227	79254	79208	79208	her	1080	" If she has so little feeling as to show no emotion upon such a subject , let her hear the worst I have to tell . "
79287	79298	79299	79299	he	155	" I shall require all your attention , Mr. Talboys , "
79302	79387	79299	79299	he	155	" for that which I have to disclose to you is of a very painful nature . Your son was my very dear friend dear to me for many reasons . Perhaps most of all dear , because I had known him and been with him through the great trouble of his life ; and because he stood comparatively alone in the world cast off by you who should have been his best friend , bereft of the only woman he had ever loved . "
79388	79396	79397	79398	Mr. Talboys	256	" The daughter of a drunken pauper , "
79403	79418	79420	79421	Robert Audley	155	" Had he died in his bed , as I sometimes thought he would , "
79423	79517	79420	79421	Robert Audley	155	" of a broken heart , I should have mourned for him very sincerely , even though I had closed his eyes with my own hands , and had seen him laid in his quiet resting - place . I should have grieved for my old schoolfellow , and for the companion who had been dear to me . But this grief would have been a very small one compared to that which I feel now , believing , as I do only too firmly , that my poor friend has been murdered . "
79518	79521	79522	79523	The father	2308	" Murdered ! "
79563	79571	79573	79574	Harcourt Talboys	256	" Mr. Audley , you are mad ! "
79576	79620	79573	79574	Harcourt Talboys	256	" you are mad , or else you are commissioned by your friend to play upon my feelings . I protest against this proceeding as a conspiracy , and I I revoke my intended forgiveness of the person who was once my son ! "
79645	79659	79661	79661	Robert	155	" It is far from my wish to alarm you unnecessarily , sir , "
79663	79766	79661	79661	Robert	155	" Heaven grant that you may be right and I wrong . I pray for it , but I can not think it I can not even hope it . I come to you for advice . I will state to you plainly and dispassionately the circumstances which have aroused my suspicions . If you say those suspicions are foolish and unfounded I am ready to submit to your better judgment . I will leave England ; and I abandon my search for the evidence wanting to to confirm my fears . If you say go on , I will go on . "
79979	79984	79985	79985	he	155	" Now , sir , "
79995	80022	79985	79985	he	155	" I await your decision . You have heard my reasons for coming to this terrible conclusion . In what manner do these reasons influence you ? "
80023	80037	80039	80041	Mr. Harcourt Talboys	256	" They do n't in any way turn me from my previous opinion , "
80052	80088	80039	80041	Mr. Harcourt Talboys	256	" I still think , as I thought before , that my son is alive , and that his disappearance is a conspiracy against myself . I decline to become the victim of that conspiracy . "
80089	80097	80099	80099	Robert	155	" And you tell me to stop ? "
80103	80146	80039	80041	Mr. Harcourt Talboys	256	" I tell you only this : If you go on , you go on for your own satisfaction , not for mine . I see nothing in what you have told me to alarm me for the safety of your friend . "
80147	80154	80156	80156	Robert	155	" So be it , then ! "
80160	80186	80156	80156	Robert	155	" from this moment I wash my hands of this business . From this moment the purpose of my life shall be to forget it . "
80228	80235	80236	80236	he	155	" Good morning , Mr. Talboys , "
80241	80281	80236	80236	he	155	" God grant that you are right . God grant that I am wrong . But I fear a day will come when you will have reason to regret your apathy respecting the untimely fate of your only son . "
80371	80378	80384	80384	he	155	" She is like her father , "
80395	80419	80384	80384	he	155	" Poor George , you had need of one friend in this world , for you have had very few to love you . "
80840	80844	80846	80847	Robert Audley	155	" Thank God ! "
80849	80910	80846	80847	Robert Audley	155	" thank God ! it is over . My poor friend must rest in his unknown grave ; and I shall not be the means of bringing disgrace upon those I love . It will come , perhaps , sooner or later , but it will not come through me . The crisis is past , and I am free . "
81080	81089	81090	81090	he	155	" Is it me the flying female wants ? "
81096	81104	81105	81105	he	155	" You 'd better stop , perhaps , "
81112	81175	81105	81105	he	155	" It is an age of eccentricity , an abnormal era of the world 's history . She may want me . Very likely I left my pocket - handkerchief behind me , and Mr. Talboys has sent this person with it . Perhaps I 'd better get out and go and meet her . It 's civil to send my handkerchief . "
81223	81227	81228	81228	he	155	" Good Heaven ! "
81231	81237	81228	81228	he	155	" it 's Miss Talboys . "
81388	81392	81393	81393	he	155	" Miss Talboys , "
81396	81401	81393	81393	he	155	" what can I why "
81424	81433	81434	81434	she	2720	" Oh , let me speak to you , "
81436	81476	81415	81415	she	2720	" let me speak to you , or I shall go mad . I heard it all . I believe what you believe , and I shall go mad unless I can do something something toward avenging his death . "
81506	81514	81515	81515	he	155	" Take my arm , Miss Talboys , "
81518	81551	81515	81515	he	155	" Pray calm yourself . Let us walk a little way back toward the house , and talk quietly . I would not have spoken as I did before you had I known "
81552	81562	81563	81563	she	2720	" Had you known that I loved my brother ? "
81568	81779	81780	81780	she	2722	" How should you know that I loved him ? How should any one think that I loved him , when I have never had power to give him a welcome beneath that roof , or a kindly word from his father ? How should I dare to betray my love for him in that house when I knew that even a sister 's affection would be turned to his disadvantage ? You do not know my father , Mr. Audley . I do . I knew that to intercede for George would have been to ruin his cause . I knew that to leave matters in my father 's hands , and to trust to time , was my only chance of ever seeing that dear brother again . And I waited waited patiently , always hoping for the best ; for I knew that my father loved his only son . I see your contemptuous smile , Mr. Audley , and I dare say it is difficult for a stranger to believe that underneath his affected stoicism my father conceals some degree of affection for his children no very warm attachment perhaps , for he has always ruled his life by the strict law of duty . Stop , "
81802	81878	81780	81780	she	2722	" I ran out of the house by the back way . Papa must not see me talking to you , Mr. Audley , and he must not see the fly standing at the gate . Will you go into the high - road and tell the man to drive on a little way ? I will come out of the plantation by a little gate further on , and meet you in the road . "
81879	81889	81891	81891	Robert	155	" But you will catch cold , Miss Talboys , "
81906	81912	81902	81902	she	2722	" You are shivering now . "
81913	81918	81919	81919	she	2722	" Not with cold , "
81922	81970	81919	81919	she	2722	" I am thinking of my brother George . If you have any pity for the only sister of your lost friend , do what I ask you , Mr. Audley . I must speak to you I must speak to you calmly , if I can . "
82074	82084	82085	82085	she	2722	" Will you walk with me inside the plantation ? "
82088	82099	82085	82085	she	2722	" We might be observed on the high - road . "
82131	82141	82142	82142	he	155	" Pray , pray calm yourself , Miss Talboys , "
82145	82161	82142	82142	he	155	" I may have been deceived in the opinion which I have formed ; I may "
82162	82169	82170	82170	she	2722	" No , no , no , "
82173	82207	82170	82170	she	2722	" you are not deceived . My brother has been murdered . Tell me the name of that woman the woman whom you suspect of being concerned in his disappearance in his murder . "
82208	82215	82142	82142	he	155	" That I can not do until "
82216	82220	82170	82170	she	2722	" Until when ? "
82221	82230	82142	82142	he	155	" Until I know that she is guilty . "
82231	82310	82170	82170	she	2722	" You told my father that you would abandon all idea of discovering the truth that you would rest satisfied to leave my brother 's fate a horrible mystery never to be solved upon this earth ; but you will not do so , Mr. Audley you will not be false to the memory of your friend . You will see vengeance done upon those who have destroyed him . You will do this , will you not ? "
82339	82358	82330	82330	he	155	" A hand that is stronger than my own is beckoning me onward , upon the dark road . "
82415	82434	82435	82435	he	155	" If you knew what misery to me may be involved in discovering the truth , Miss Talboys , "
82438	82451	82435	82435	he	155	" you would scarcely ask me to pursue this business any farther ? "
82452	82459	82460	82460	she	2729	" But I do ask you , "
82466	82492	82460	82460	she	2729	" I do ask you . I ask you to avenge my brother 's untimely death . Will you do so ? Yes or no ? "
82493	82500	82460	82460	she	2729	" What if I answer no ? "
82501	82509	82510	82510	she	2729	" Then I will do it myself , "
82522	82653	82510	82510	she	2729	" I myself will follow up the clew to this mystery ; I will find this woman though you refuse to tell me in what part of England my brother disappeared . I will travel from one end of the world to the other to find the secret of his fate , if you refuse to find it for me . I am of age ; my own mistress ; rich , for I have money left me by one of my aunts ; I shall be able to employ those who will help me in my search , and I will make it to their interest to serve me well . Choose between the two alternatives , Mr. Audley . Shall you or I find my brother 's murderer ? "
82727	82738	82739	82739	she	2732	" I have grown up in an atmosphere of suppression , "
82744	82861	82862	82862	she	2734	" I have stifled and dwarfed the natural feelings of my heart , until they have become unnatural in their intensity ; I have been allowed neither friends nor lovers . My mother died when I was very young . My father has always been to me what you saw him to - day . I have had no one but my brother . All the love that my heart can hold has been centered upon him . Do you wonder , then , that when I hear that his young life has been ended by the hand of treachery , that I wish to see vengeance done upon the traitor ? Oh , my God , "
82879	82901	82862	82862	she	2734	" lead me to the murderer of my brother , and let mine be the hand to avenge his untimely death . "
83004	83008	83010	83010	Robert	155	" Miss Talboys , "
83016	83067	83010	83010	Robert	155	" your brother shall not be unavenged . He shall not be forgotten . I do not think that any professional aid which you could procure would lead you as surely to the secret of this mystery as I can lead you , if you are patient and trust me . "
83068	83074	83075	83075	she	2734	" I will trust you , "
83078	83088	83075	83075	she	2734	" for I see that you will help me . "
83089	83101	83102	83102	he	155	" I believe that it is my destiny to do so , "
83189	83202	83203	83203	he	155	" Have you any letters of your brother 's , Miss Talboys ? "
83206	83230	83169	83170	Clara Talboys	272	" Two . One written soon after his marriage , the other written at Liverpool , the night before he sailed for Australia . "
83231	83239	83166	83166	he	155	" Will you let me see them ? "
83240	83316	83169	83170	Clara Talboys	272	" Yes , I will send them to you if you will give me your address . You will write to me from time to time , will you not , to tell me whether you are approaching the truth . I shall be obliged to act secretly here , but I am going to leave home in two or three months , and I shall be perfectly free then to act as I please . "
83317	83326	83327	83327	Robert	155	" You are not going to leave England ? "
83330	83351	83169	83170	Clara Talboys	272	" Oh no ! I am only going to pay a long - promised visit to some friends in Essex . "
83382	83390	83391	83391	she	272	" My brother George disappeared in Essex , "
83400	83410	83411	83411	he	155	" I am sorry you have discovered so much , "
83414	83432	83411	83411	he	155	" My position becomes every day more complicated , every day more painful . Good - bye . "
83473	83484	83485	83485	he	155	" Pray lose no time in returning to the house , "
83489	83501	83485	83485	he	155	" I fear you will suffer from this morning 's work . "
83502	83505	83506	83506	she	272	" Suffer ! "
83511	83558	83559	83559	she	272	" You talk to me of suffering , when the only creature in this world who ever loved me has been taken from it in the bloom of youth . What can there be for me henceforth but suffering ? What is the cold to me ? "
83576	83621	83559	83559	she	272	" I would walk from here to London barefoot through the snow , and never stop by the way , if I could bring him back to life . What would I not do to bring him back ? What would I not do ? "
83729	83736	83737	83737	he	155	" Pray , pray be calm , "
83740	83758	83737	83737	he	155	" hope even against hope . We may both be deceived ; your brother may still live . "
83759	83767	83768	83768	she	272	" Oh ! if it were so , "
83773	83780	83768	83768	she	272	" if it could be so . "
83781	83793	83737	83737	he	155	" Let us try and hope that it may be so . "
83794	83797	83798	83798	she	272	" No , "
83808	83829	83798	83798	she	272	" let us hope for nothing but revenge . Good - by , Mr. Audley . Stop ; your address . "
83846	83855	83856	83856	she	272	" I will send you George 's letters , "
83859	83869	83856	83856	she	272	" they may help you . Good - by . "
83916	83928	83929	83929	he	155	" Heaven help those who stand between me and the secret , "
83932	83945	83929	83929	he	155	" for they will be sacrificed to the memory of George Talboys . "
84079	84087	84089	84090	the barrister	1039	" What a pleasant thing life is , "
84092	84355	84357	84357	Robert	155	" What an unspeakable boon what an overpowering blessing ! Let any man make a calculation of his existence , subtracting the hours in which he has been thoroughly happy really and entirely at his ease , without one arriere pensťe to mar his enjoyment without the most infinitesimal cloud to overshadow the brightness of his horizon . Let him do this , and surely he will laugh in utter bitterness of soul when he sets down the sum of his felicity , and discovers the pitiful smallness of the amount . He will have enjoyed himself for a week or ten days in thirty years , perhaps . In thirty years of dull December , and blustering March , and showery April , and dark November weather , there may have been seven or eight glorious August days , through which the sun has blazed in cloudless radiance , and the summer breezes have breathed perpetual balm . How fondly we recollect these solitary days of pleasure , and hope for their recurrence , and try to plan the circumstances that made them bright ; and arrange , and predestinate , and diplomatize with fate for a renewal of the remembered joy . As if any joy could ever be built up out of such and such constituent parts ! As if happiness were not essentially accidental a bright and wandering bird , utterly irregular in its migrations ; with us one summer 's day , and forever gone from us on the next ! Look at marriages , for instance , "
84395	84724	84381	84381	he	155	" Look at marriage ! Who is to say which shall be the one judicious selection out of nine hundred and ninety - nine mistakes ! Who shall decide from the first aspect of the slimy creature , which is to be the one eel out of the colossal bag of snakes ? That girl on the curbstone yonder , waiting to cross the street when my chariot shall have passed , may be the one woman out of every female creature in this vast universe who could make me a happy man . Yet I pass her by bespatter her with the mud from my wheels , in my helpless ignorance , in my blind submission to the awful hand of fatality . If that girl , Clara Talboys , had been five minutes later , I should have left Dorsetshire thinking her cold , hard , and unwomanly , and should have gone to my grave with that mistake part and parcel of my mind . I took her for a stately and heartless automaton ; I know her now to be a noble and beautiful woman . What an incalculable difference this may make in my life . When I left that house , I went out into the winter day with the determination of abandoning all further thought of the secret of George 's death . I see her , and she forces me onward upon the loathsome path the crooked by - way of watchfulness and suspicion . How can I say to this sister of my dead friend , ' I believe that your brother has been murdered ! I believe that I know by whom , but I will take no step to set my doubts at rest , or to confirm my fears ' ? I can not say this . This woman knows half my secret ; she will soon possess herself of the rest , and then and then "
85182	85185	85192	85194	The solicitous waiter	2774	" broiled sole "
85187	85191	85192	85194	The solicitous waiter	2774	" boiled mack'-rill . "
85357	85377	85378	85378	he	2779	" I accept the dominion of that pale girl , with the statuesque features and the calm brown eyes , "
85381	85502	85378	85378	he	2779	" I recognize the power of a mind superior to my own , and I yield to it , and bow down to it . I 've been acting for myself , and thinking for myself , for the last few months , and I 'm tired of the unnatural business . I 've been false to the leading principle of my life , and I 've suffered for the folly . I found two gray hairs in my head the week before last , and an impertinent crow has planted a delicate impression of his foot under my right eye . Yes , I 'm getting old upon the right side ; and why why should it be so ? "
85528	85539	85540	85540	he	2779	" What the devil am I doing in this galere ? "
85543	86117	85540	85540	he	2779	" But I am in it , and I ca n't get out of it ; so I better submit myself to the brown - eyed girl , and do what she tells me patiently and faithfully . What a wonderful solution to life 's enigma there is in petticoat government ! Man might lie in the sunshine , and eat lotuses , and fancy it ' always afternoon , ' if his wife would let him ! But she wo n't , bless her impulsive heart and active mind ! She knows better than that . Who ever heard of a woman taking life as it ought to be taken ? Instead of supporting it as an unavoidable nuisance , only redeemable by its brevity , she goes through it as if it were a pageant or a procession . She dresses for it , and simpers and grins , and gesticulates for it . She pushes her neighbors , and struggles for a good place in the dismal march ; she elbows , and writhes , and tramples , and prances to the one end of making the most of the misery . She gets up early and sits up late , and is loud , and restless , and noisy , and unpitying . She drags her husband on to the woolsack , or pushes him into Parliament . She drives him full butt at the dear , lazy machinery of government , and knocks and buffets him about the wheels , and cranks , and screws , and pulleys ; until somebody , for quiet 's sake , makes him something that she wanted him to be made . That 's why incompetent men sometimes sit in high places , and interpose their poor , muddled intellects between the things to be done and the people that can do them , making universal confusion in the helpless innocence of well - placed incapacity . The square men in the round holes are pushed into them by their wives . The Eastern potentate who declared that women were at the bottom of all mischief , should have gone a little further and seen why it is so . It is because women are never lazy . They do n't know what it is to be quiet . They are Semiramides , and Cleopatras , and Joans of Arc , Queen Elizabeths , and Catharines the Second , and they riot in battle , and murder , and clamor and desperation . If they ca n't agitate the universe and play at ball with hemispheres , they 'll make mountains of warfare and vexation out of domestic molehills , and social storms in household teacups . Forbid them to hold forth upon the freedom of nations and the wrongs of mankind , and they 'll quarrel with Mrs. Jones about the shape of a mantle or the character of a small maid - servant . To call them the weaker sex is to utter a hideous mockery . They are the stronger sex , the noisier , the more persevering , the most self - assertive sex . They want freedom of opinion , variety of occupation , do they ? Let them have it . Let them be lawyers , doctors , preachers , teachers , soldiers , legislators anything they like but let them be quiet if they can . "
86142	86147	86148	86148	he	155	" I hate women , "
86153	86293	86295	86296	Mr. Audley	155	" They 're bold , brazen , abominable creatures , invented for the annoyance and destruction of their superiors . Look at this business of poor George 's ! It 's all woman 's work from one end to the other . He marries a woman , and his father casts him off penniless and professionless . He hears of the woman 's death and he breaks his heart his good honest , manly heart , worth a million of the treacherous lumps of self - interest and mercenary calculation which beats in women 's breasts . He goes to a woman 's house and he is never seen alive again . And now I find myself driven into a corner by another woman , of whose existence I had never thought until this day . And and then , "
86301	86366	86295	86296	Mr. Audley	155	" there 's Alicia , too ; she 's another nuisance . She 'd like me to marry her I know ; and she 'll make me do it , I dare say , before she 's done with me . But I 'd much rather not ; though she is a dear , bouncing , generous thing , bless her poor little heart . "
86554	86617	86539	86539	He	1073	" It 's comfortable , but it seems so deuced lonely to - night . If poor George were sitting opposite to me , or or even George 's sister she 's very like him existence might be a little more endurable . But when a fellow 's lived by himself for eight or ten years he begins to be bad company . "
86630	86641	86642	86642	he	1073	" The idea of my thinking of George 's sister , "
86645	86653	86642	86642	he	1073	" what a preposterous idiot I am ! "
86770	86775	86776	86776	he	1073	" From Clara Talboys , "
86796	86834	86781	86781	he	1073	" Yes , from Clara Talboys , most decidedly ; I recognized a feminine resemblance to poor George 's hand ; neater than his , and more decided than his , but very like , very like . "
86853	86862	86863	86863	he	1073	" I wonder what she says to me ? "
86866	86922	86863	86863	he	1073	" It 's a long letter , I dare say ; she 's the kind of woman who would write a long letter a letter that will urge me on , drive me forward , wrench me out of myself , I 've no doubt . But that ca n't be helped so here goes ! "
86952	86964	86923	86923	He	1073	" I send the letters ; please preserve and return them C.T. "
87077	87096	87098	87100	the young barrister	1073	" If George could have known for what a purpose this description would serve when he wrote it , "
87124	87124	87104	87104	his	1073	"
87333	87346	87314	87314	They	2807	" lovely woman , with all her faults , God bless her , "
87453	87464	87465	87465	he	155	" If she would only take warning and run away , "
87471	87493	87465	87465	he	155	" Heaven knows , I have given her a fair chance . Why does n't she take it and run away ? "
87709	87715	87716	87716	Alicia	163	" Papa is very ill , "
87719	87793	87716	87716	Alicia	163	" not dangerously ill , thank God ; but confined to his room by an attack of low fever which has succeeded a violent cold . Come and see him , Robert , if you have any regard for your nearest relations . He has spoken about you several times ; and I know he will be glad to have you with him . Come at once , but say nothing about this letter .
87794	87802	87716	87716	Alicia	163	" From your affectionate cousin , ALICIA . "
87835	87841	87842	87842	he	155	" Have I done right ? "
87853	87912	87842	87842	he	155	" have I done right to tamper with justice ; and to keep the secret of my doubts in the hope that I was shielding those I love from sorrow and disgrace ? What shall I do if I find him ill , very ill , dying perhaps , dying upon her breast ! What shall I do ? "
88344	88358	88359	88359	he	155	" What would become of this place if my uncle were to die ? "
88384	88407	88363	88363	he	155	" Would other people live in the old house , and sit under the low oak ceilings in the homely familiar rooms ? "
88877	88895	88896	88896	he	2867	" Sir Michael will be cheered up a bit , sir , by the sight of you , "
88932	88950	88951	88952	the servant	1435	" Shall I bring you some dinner here , sir , before you go up - stairs ? "
88955	88984	88951	88952	the servant	1435	" My lady and Miss Audley have dined early during my master 's illness , but I can bring you anything you would please to take , sir . "
88985	88997	88998	88998	Robert	155	" I 'll take nothing until I have seen my uncle , "
89003	89029	89030	89030	he	155	" that is to say , if I can see him at once . He is not too ill to receive me , I suppose ? "
89035	89059	89060	89060	He	155	" Oh , no , sir not too ill ; only a little low , sir . This way , if you please . "
89546	89550	89551	89551	she	477	" Mr. Audley ! "
89561	89564	89566	89566	Alicia	163	" Hush ! "
89573	89588	89589	89589	she	477	" you will wake papa . How good of you to come , Robert , "
89673	89684	89685	89685	Robert	155	" He has not been very ill , has he ? "
89706	89715	89716	89716	she	477	" Oh , no , not dangerously ill , "
89729	89742	89716	89716	she	477	" but still we have been anxious , very , very anxious . "
89753	89760	89761	89761	he	155	" She shall look at me , "
89764	89796	89761	89761	he	155	" I will make her meet my eyes , and I will read her as I have read her before . She shall know how useless her artifices are with me . "
89846	89859	89860	89860	Robert	155	" I have no doubt you have been anxious , Lady Audley , "
89880	89914	89860	89860	Robert	155	" There is no one to whom my uncle 's life can be of more value than to you . Your happiness , your prosperity , your safety depend alike upon his existence . "
89957	89962	89963	89963	she	211	" I know that , "
89966	89976	89963	89963	she	211	" Those who strike me must strike through him . "
90126	90140	90141	90141	he	474	" It was very good of you to come to me , Bob , "
90144	90201	90141	90141	he	474	" I have been thinking of you a good deal since I have been ill . You and Lucy must be good friends , you know , Bob ; and you must learn to think of her as your aunt , sir ; though she is young and beautiful ; and and you understand , eh ? "
90217	90225	90226	90226	he	155	" I do understand you , sir , "
90231	90259	90226	90226	he	155	" and I give you my word of honor that I am steeled against my lady 's fascinations . She knows that as well as I do . "
90272	90279	90280	90280	she	211	" Bah , you silly Robert , "
90283	90318	90280	90280	she	211	" you take everything au serieux . If I thought you were rather too young for a nephew , it was only in my fear of other people 's foolish gossip ; not from any "
90405	90414	90415	90415	he	155	" I will light you to the staircase , "
90434	90448	90450	90451	the surgeon	517	" No , no , Mr. Audley , pray do not trouble yourself , "
90453	90462	90450	90451	the surgeon	517	" I know my way very well indeed . "
90493	90506	90507	90507	he	1039	" Will you see that the door is closed , Mr. Dawson ? "
90519	90533	90507	90507	he	1039	" I wish to have a few moments ' private conversation with you . "
90534	90539	90541	90542	the surgeon	517	" With much pleasure , "
90550	90599	90541	90542	the surgeon	517	" but if you are at all alarmed about your uncle , Mr. Audley , I can set your mind at rest . There is no occasion for the least uneasiness . Had his illness been at all serious I should have telegraphed immediately for the family physician . "
90600	90614	90616	90616	Robert	155	" I am sure that you would have done your duty , sir , "
90620	90645	90616	90616	Robert	155	" But I am not going to speak of my uncle . I wish to ask you two or three questions about another person . "
90646	90649	90541	90542	the surgeon	517	" Indeed . "
90650	90672	90616	90616	Robert	155	" The person who once lived in your family as Miss Lucy Graham ; the person who is now Lady Audley . "
90687	90694	90695	90695	he	164	" Pardon me , Mr. Audley , "
90698	90740	90741	90741	He	164	" you can scarcely expect me to answer any questions about your uncle 's wife without Sir Michael 's express permission . I can understand no motive which can prompt you to ask such questions no worthy motive , at least . "
90755	90799	90741	90741	He	164	" You have been falling in love with your uncle 's pretty wife , sir , and you want to make me a go - between in some treacherous flirtation ; but it wo n't do , sir , it wo n't do . "
90800	90812	90813	90813	he	677	" I always respected the lady as Miss Graham , sir , "
90816	90848	90813	90813	he	677	" and I esteem her doubly as Lady Audley not on account of her altered position , but because she is the wife of one of the noblest men in Christendom . "
90849	90867	90869	90869	Robert	155	" You can not respect my uncle or my uncle 's honor more sincerely than I do , "
90871	90892	90869	90869	Robert	155	" I have no unworthy motive for the questions I am about to ask ; and you must answer them . "
90893	90896	90898	90899	Mr. Dawson	164	" Must ! "
90903	90982	90869	90869	Robert	155	" Yes , you are my uncle 's friend . It was at your house he met the woman who is now his wife . She called herself an orphan , I believe , and enlisted his pity as well as his admiration in her behalf . She told him that she stood alone in the world , did she not ? without a friend or relative . This was all I could ever learn of her antecedents . "
90983	90994	90996	90997	the surgeon	517	" What reason have you to wish to know more ? "
90999	91005	91007	91008	Robert Audley	155	" A very terrible reason , "
91010	91219	91007	91008	Robert Audley	155	" For some months past I have struggled with doubts and suspicions which have embittered my life . They have grown stronger every day ; and they will not be set at rest by the commonplace sophistries and the shallow arguments with which men try to deceive themselves rather than believe that which of all things upon earth they most fear to believe . I do not think that the woman who bears my uncle 's name , is worthy to be his wife . I may wrong her . Heaven grant that it is so . But if I do , the fatal chain of circumstantial evidence never yet linked itself so closely about an innocent person . I wish to set my doubts at rest or or to confirm my fears . There is but one manner in which I can do this . I must trace the life of my uncle 's wife backward , minutely and carefully , from this night to a period of six years ago . This is the twenty - fourth of February , fifty - nine . I want to know every record of her life between to - night and the February of the year fifty - three . "
91220	91229	90869	90869	Robert	155	" And your motive is a worthy one ? "
91230	91244	91007	91008	Robert Audley	155	" Yes , I wish to clear her from a very dreadful suspicion . "
91245	91253	90869	90869	Robert	155	" Which exists only in your mind ? "
91254	91264	91007	91008	Robert Audley	155	" And in the mind of one other person . "
91265	91274	90869	90869	Robert	155	" May I ask who that person is ? "
91275	91281	91283	91283	Robert	155	" No , Mr. Dawson , "
91287	91394	91283	91283	Robert	155	" I can not reveal anything more than what I have already told you . I am a very irresolute , vacillating man in most things . In this matter I am compelled to be decided . I repeat once more that I must know the history of Lucy Graham 's life . If you refuse to help me to the small extent in your power , I will find others who will help me . Painful as it would become , I will ask my uncle for the information which you would withhold , rather than be baffled in the first step of my investigation . "
91403	91420	91421	91421	he	164	" I can not express how much you have astonished and alarmed me , Mr. Audley . "
91424	91519	91421	91421	he	164	" I can tell you so little about Lady Audley 's antecedents , that it would be mere obstinacy to withhold the small amount of information I possess . I have always considered your uncle 's wife one of the most amiable of women . I can not bring myself to think her otherwise . It would be an uprooting of one of the strongest convictions of my life were I compelled to think her otherwise . You wish to follow her life backward from the present hour to the year fifty - three ? "
91520	91524	90869	90869	Robert	155	" I do . "
91525	91577	91421	91421	he	164	" She was married to your uncle last June twelvemonth , in the midsummer of fifty - seven . She had lived in my house a little more than thirteen months . She became a member of my household upon the fourteenth of May , in the year fifty - six . "
91578	91584	90869	90869	Robert	155	" And she came to you "
91585	91630	91421	91421	he	164	" From a school at Brompton , a school kept by a lady of the name of Vincent . It was Mrs. Vincent 's strong recommendation that induced me to receive Miss Graham into my family without any more special knowledge of her antecedents . "
91631	91639	90869	90869	Robert	155	" Did you see this Mrs. Vincent ? "
91640	91810	91421	91421	he	164	" I did not . I advertised for a governess , and Miss Graham answered my advertisement . In her letter she referred me to Mrs. Vincent , the proprietress of a school in which she was then residing as junior teacher . My time is always so fully occupied , that I was glad to escape the necessity of a day 's loss in going from Audley to London to inquire about the young lady 's qualifications . I looked for Mrs. Vincent 's name in the directory , found it , and concluded that she was a responsible person , and wrote to her . Her reply was perfectly satisfactory ; Miss Lucy Graham was assiduous and conscientious ; as well as fully qualified for the situation I offered . I accepted this reference , and I had no cause to regret what may have been an indiscretion . And now , Mr. Audley , I have told you all that I have the power to tell . "
91811	91828	91830	91830	Robert	155	" Will you be so kind as to give me the address of this Mrs. Vincent ? "
91837	91853	91421	91421	he	164	" Certainly ; she was then living at No . 9 Crescent Villas , Brompton . "
91854	91861	91863	91864	Mr. Audley	155	" Ah , to be sure , "
91881	91938	91421	91421	he	164	" Crescent Villas yes , I have heard the address before from Lady Audley herself . This Mrs. Vincent telegraphed to my uncle 's wife early in last September . She was ill dying , I believe and sent for my lady ; but had removed from her old house and was not to be found . "
91939	91951	91421	91421	he	164	" Indeed ! I never heard Lady Audley mention the circumstance . "
91952	92026	91421	91421	he	164	" Perhaps not . It occurred while I was down here . Thank you , Mr. Dawson , for the information you have so kindly and honestly given me . It takes me back two and a - half years in the history of my lady 's life ; but I have still a blank of three years to fill up before I can exonerate her from my terrible suspicion . Good evening . "
92550	92564	92565	92565	she	477	" You 'll take a cup of tea with us , Mr. Audley ? "
92588	92593	92579	92579	Robert	155	" If you please . "
92594	92625	92565	92565	she	477	" But you have not dined , perhaps ? Shall I ring and tell them to bring you something a little more substantial than biscuits and transparent bread and butter ? "
92626	92656	92579	92579	Robert	155	" No , thank you , Lady Audley . I took some lunch before I left town . I 'll trouble you for nothing but a cup of tea . "
92730	92736	92737	92738	the barrister	1039	" Alicia , my dear , "
92750	92757	92737	92738	the barrister	1039	" you 're not looking well . "
92776	92780	92781	92781	she	163	" Perhaps not , "
92786	92818	92781	92781	she	163	" What does it matter ? I 'm growing a philosopher of your school , Robert Audley . What does it matter ? Who cares whether I am well or ill ? "
92819	92826	92828	92829	the barrister	1039	" What a spitfire she is , "
92845	92849	92841	92841	she	163	" Robert Audley . "
92850	92868	92869	92869	he	1039	" You need n't pitch into a fellow because he asks you a civil question , Alicia , "
92874	92890	92869	92869	he	1039	" As to nobody caring about your health , that 's nonsense . I care . "
92900	92906	92891	92892	Miss Audley	163	" Sir Harry Towers cares . "
92917	92926	92927	92927	Robert	155	" What are you reading there , Alicia ? "
92944	92949	92891	92892	Miss Audley	163	" Changes and Chances . "
92950	92954	92995	92996	Miss Audley	163	" A novel ? "
92955	92958	92891	92892	Miss Audley	163	" Yes . "
92959	92965	92995	92996	Miss Audley	163	" Who is it by ? "
92966	92974	92976	92976	Alicia	163	" The author of Follies and Faults , "
92989	92994	92995	92996	Miss Audley	163	" Is it interesting ? "
93006	93010	93011	93011	she	163	" Not particularly , "
93014	93036	93038	93039	Mr. Audley	155	" Then I think you might have better manners than to read it while your first cousin is sitting opposite you , "
93045	93068	93038	93039	Mr. Audley	155	" especially as he has only come to pay you a flying visit , and will be off to - morrow morning . "
93069	93075	93077	93078	my lady	477	" To - morrow morning ! "
93114	93117	93118	93118	he	155	" Yes , "
93121	93162	93118	93118	he	155	" I shall be obliged to run up to London to - morrow on business , but I shall return the next day , if you will allow me , Lady Audley , and stay here till my uncle recovers . "
93163	93176	93178	93179	my lady	477	" But you are not seriously alarmed about him , are you ? "
93183	93192	93118	93118	he	155	" You do not think him very ill ? "
93193	93196	93198	93198	Robert	155	" No , "
93200	93215	93198	93198	Robert	155	" Thank Heaven , I think there is not the slightest cause for apprehension . "
93247	93263	93264	93264	she	477	" But you were closeted such a long time with Mr. Dawson , just now , "
93272	93294	93264	93264	she	477	" I was quite alarmed at the length of your conversation . Were you talking of Sir Michael all the time ? "
93295	93303	93216	93217	My lady	477	" No ; not all the time ? "
93314	93334	93335	93335	she	477	" Why , what could you find to say to Mr. Dawson , or he to say to you ? "
93342	93351	93335	93335	she	477	" You are almost strangers to each other . "
93352	93365	93304	93305	My lady	477	" Suppose Mr. Dawson wished to consult me about some law business . "
93366	93371	93373	93374	Lady Audley	211	" Was it that ? "
93378	93395	93397	93397	Robert	155	" It would be rather unprofessional to tell you if it were so , my lady , "
93453	93468	93470	93470	Alicia	163	" Upon my word , Robert Audley , you are a very agreeable companion , "
93493	93581	93474	93474	her	163	" Perhaps the next time you come to the Court you will be good enough to bring your mind with you . By your present inanimate appearance , I should imagine that you had left your intellect , such as it is , somewhere in the Temple . You were never one of the liveliest of people , but latterly you have really grown almost unendurable . I suppose you are in love , Mr. Audley , and are thinking of the honored object of your affections . "
93636	93647	93619	93619	her	272	" Shall you or I find my brother 's murderer ? "
93861	93876	93877	93877	Robert	155	" Mrs. Vincent was in a dying state , according to the telegraphic message , "
93880	93900	93877	93877	Robert	155	" If I do find her , I shall at least succeed in discovering whether that message was genuine . "
94108	94125	94126	94126	he	155	" If I were a distinguished Q.C. , I could not do this sort of thing , "
94129	94180	94126	94126	he	155	" my time would be worth a guinea or so a minute , and I should be retained in the great case of Hoggs vs. Boggs , going forward this very day before a special jury at Westminster Hall . As it is , I can afford to be patient . "
94247	94256	94257	94258	the girl	722	" and missus has been here fifteen months , "
94262	94275	94276	94276	Robert	155	" But you can not tell where she went on leaving here ? "
94281	94314	94257	94258	the girl	722	" No , sir ; missus says she believes the lady failed , and that she left sudden like , and did n't want her address to be known in the neighborhood . "
94481	94488	94489	94489	Robert	155	" She must have bought bread , "
94501	94521	94489	94489	Robert	155	" and she is likely to have bought it at the handiest place . I 'll try the baker . "
94582	94609	94562	94562	he	155	" Can you tell me the address of a Mrs. Vincent , who lived at No . 9 Crescent Villas a year and a half ago ? "
94616	94623	94625	94626	the baker	2354	" No , I ca n't , "
94643	94697	94625	94626	the baker	2354	" and what 's more , I wish I could . That lady owes me upward of eleven pound for bread , and it 's rather more than I can afford to lose . If anybody can tell me where she lives , I shall be much obliged to 'em for so doing . "
94777	94792	94793	94793	he	155	" If the baker ca n't find her , how should I find her ? "
94798	94853	94793	94793	he	155	" If a resolute , sanguine , active and energetic creature , such as the baker , fail to achieve this business , how can a lymphatic wretch like me hope to accomplish it ? Where the baker has been defeated , what preposterous folly it would be for me to try to succeed . "
94939	94944	94945	94945	he	155	" Eh , what ? "
94950	94969	94945	94945	he	155	" Can I do anything for you , ma'am ? Does Mrs. Vincent owe you money , too ? "
94970	94975	94976	94977	the woman	968	" Yes , sir , "
94996	95029	94976	94977	the woman	968	" Mrs. Vincent is in my debt ; but it is n't that , sir . I I want to know , please , what your business may be with her because because "
95030	95055	94976	94977	the woman	968	" You can give me her address if you choose , ma'am . That 's what you mean to say , is n't it ? "
95068	95084	95085	95085	she	968	" You 're not connected with with the tally business , are you , sir ? "
95100	95106	95108	95110	the young barrister	1073	" The what , ma'am ? "
95118	95129	95131	95133	the little woman	3048	" I 'm sure I beg your pardon , sir , "
95144	95183	95131	95133	the little woman	3048	" I thought you might have been , you know . Some of the gentlemen who collect for the tally shops do dress so very handsome ; and I know Mrs. Vincent owes a good deal of money . "
95195	95200	95201	95201	he	155	" My dear madam , "
95204	95342	95201	95201	he	155	" I want to know nothing of Mrs. Vincent 's affairs . So far from being concerned in what you call the tally business , I have not the remotest idea what you mean by that expression . You may mean a political conspiracy ; you may mean some new species of taxes . Mrs. Vincent does not owe me any money , however badly she may stand with that awful - looking baker . I never saw her in my life ; but I wish to see her to - day for the simple purpose of asking her a few very plain questions about a young lady who once resided in her house . If you know where Mrs. Vincent lives and will give me her address , you will be doing me a great favor . "
95370	95384	95385	95385	she	968	" I 'm sure you look and speak like a gentleman , sir , "
95393	95508	95385	95385	she	968	" and I hope you will excuse me if I 've seemed mistrustful like ; but poor Mrs. Vincent has had dreadful difficulties , and I 'm the only person hereabouts that she 's trusted with her addresses . I 'm a dressmaker , sir , and I 've worked for her for upward of six years , and though she does n't pay me regular , you know , sir , she gives me a little money on account now and then , and I get on as well as I can . I may tell you where she lives , then , sir ? You have n't deceived me , have you ? "
95509	95516	95621	95621	He	155	" On my honor , no . "
95517	95523	95525	95526	the dressmaker	3052	" Well , then sir , "
95559	95578	95533	95533	she	3052	" it 's Acacia Cottage , Peckham Grove . I took a dress there yesterday for Mrs. Vincent . "
95579	95583	95585	95585	Robert	155	" Thank you , "
95594	95620	95585	95585	Robert	155	" I am very much obliged to you , and you may rely upon it , Mrs. Vincent shall not suffer any inconvenience through me . "
95639	95650	95651	95651	he	155	" I have beaten the baker , at any rate , "
95654	95670	95651	95651	he	155	" Now for the second stage , traveling backward , in my lady 's life . "
96031	96040	96027	96027	his	155	" a connection of the late Miss Graham . "
96569	96576	96577	96577	she	3090	" Mr. Audley , I presume , "
96599	96616	96577	96577	she	3090	" You will pardon me , I hope , for detaining you so long ; my duties "
96617	96629	96630	96630	Robert	155	" It is I who should apologize for intruding upon you , "
96635	96667	96630	96630	Robert	155	" but my motive for calling upon you is a very serious one , and must plead my excuse . You remember the lady whose name I wrote upon my card ? "
96668	96671	96577	96577	she	3090	" Perfectly . "
96672	96692	96630	96630	Robert	155	" May I ask how much you know of that lady 's history since her departure from your house ? "
96693	96749	96577	96577	she	3090	" Very little . In point of fact , scarcely anything at all . Miss Graham , I believe , obtained a situation in the family of a surgeon resident in Essex . Indeed , it was I who recommended her to that gentleman . I have never heard from her since she left me . "
96750	96758	96759	96759	Robert	155	" But you have communicated with her ? "
96764	96769	96577	96577	she	3090	" No , indeed . "
96790	96823	96787	96787	his	155	" May I ask if you sent a telegraphic dispatch to Miss Graham early in last September , stating that you were dangerously ill , and that you wished to see her ? "
96833	96844	96845	96845	she	205	" I had no occasion to send such a message , "
96848	96859	96845	96845	she	205	" I have never been seriously ill in my life . "
96882	96898	96899	96899	he	155	" If I ask you a few straightforward questions about Miss Lucy Graham , madam , "
96902	96921	96899	96899	he	155	" Will you do me the favor to answer them without asking my motive in making such inquiries ? "
96922	96926	96928	96929	Mrs. Vincent	205	" Most certainly , "
96931	96956	96928	96929	Mrs. Vincent	205	" I know nothing to Miss Graham 's disadvantage , and have no justification for making a mystery of the little I do know . "
96957	96974	96975	96976	Mrs. Vincent	205	" Then will you tell me at what date the young lady first came to you ? "
97022	97036	97037	97037	she	205	" It 's not the least use to ask me , Mr. Audley , "
97040	97148	97037	97037	she	205	" I 'm the most careless creature in the world ; I never did , and never could remember dates , though I do all in my power to impress upon my girls how important it is for their future welfare that they should know when William the Conqueror began to reign , and all that kind of thing . But I have n't the remotest idea when Miss Graham came to me , although I know it was ages ago , for it was the very summer I had my peach - colored silk . But we must consult Tonks Tonks is sure to be right . "
97194	97203	97204	97204	she	205	" Ask Miss Tonks to come to me , "
97207	97215	97204	97204	she	205	" I want to see her particularly . "
97303	97309	97311	97312	Mrs. Vincent	205	" Tonks , my dear , "
97317	97344	97311	97312	Mrs. Vincent	205	" this gentleman is a relative of Miss Graham 's . Do you remember how long it is since she came to us at Crescent Villas ? "
97345	97353	97355	97356	Miss Tonks	296	" She came in August , 1854 , "
97358	97389	97355	97356	Miss Tonks	296	" I think it was the eighteenth of August , but I 'm not quite sure that it was n't the seventeenth . I know it was on a Tuesday . "
97390	97403	97405	97406	Mrs. Vincent	205	" Thank you , Tonks ; you are a most invaluable darling , "
97472	97488	97490	97491	the schoolmistress	2987	" Is there anything else that Tonks or I can tell you , Mr. Audley ? "
97493	97504	97490	97491	the schoolmistress	2987	" Tonks has a far better memory than I have . "
97505	97521	97522	97522	Robert	155	" Can you tell me where Miss Graham came from when she entered your household ? "
97525	97530	97532	97533	Mrs. Vincent	205	" Not very precisely , "
97535	97580	97532	97533	Mrs. Vincent	205	" I have a vague notion that Miss Graham said something about coming from the seaside , but she did n't say where , or if she did I have forgotten it . Tonks , did Miss Graham tell you where she came from ? "
97581	97586	97588	97589	Miss Tonks	296	" Oh , no ! "
97598	97632	97633	97634	Miss Tonks	296	" Miss Graham told me nothing ; she was too clever for that . She knows how to keep her own secrets , in spite of her innocent ways and her curly hair , "
97639	97646	97647	97647	Robert	155	" You think she had secrets ? "
97653	97659	97661	97662	Miss Tonks	296	" I know she had , "
97668	97703	97661	97662	Miss Tonks	296	" all manner of secrets . I would n't have engaged such a person as junior teacher in a respectable school , without so much as one word of recommendation from any living creature . "
97704	97716	97718	97718	Robert	155	" You had no reference , then , from Miss Graham ? "
97724	97727	97728	97729	the lady	683	" No , "
97737	97878	97728	97729	the lady	683	" I waived that . Miss Graham waived the question of salary ; I could not do less than waive the question of reference . She quarreled with her papa , she told me , and she wanted to find a home away from all the people she had ever known . She wished to keep herself quite separate from these people . She had endured so much , she said , young as she was , and she wanted to escape from her troubles . How could I press her for a reference under these circumstances , especially when I saw that she was a perfect lady . You know that Lucy Graham was a perfect lady , Tonks , and it is very unkind for you to say such cruel things about my taking her without a reference . "
97879	97894	97895	97896	Miss Tonks	296	" When people make favorites , they are apt to be deceived in them , "
97915	97927	97928	97929	Mrs. Vincent	205	" I never made her a favorite , you jealous Tonks , "
97934	97953	97928	97929	Mrs. Vincent	205	" I never said she was as useful as you , dear . You know I never did . "
97954	97959	97961	97962	Miss Tonks	296	" Oh , no ! "
97969	98002	97961	97962	Miss Tonks	296	" you never said she was useful . She was only ornamental ; a person to be shown off to visitors , and to play fantasias on the drawing - room piano . "
98003	98018	98019	98019	Robert	155	" Then you can give me no clew to Miss Graham 's previous history ? "
98056	98073	98074	98074	he	155	" If this woman knows anything to my lady 's detriment , she will tell it , "
98077	98086	98074	98074	he	155	" She will tell it only too willingly . "
98165	98175	98176	98176	he	155	" I have only one more question to ask , "
98181	98214	98176	98176	he	155	" It is this : Did Miss Graham leave any books or knick - knacks , or any other kind of property whatever , behind her , when she left your establishment ? "
98215	98221	98222	98223	Mrs. Vincent	205	" Not to my knowledge , "
98226	98229	98231	98232	Miss Tonks	296	" Yes , "
98236	98273	98274	98274	she	296	" She did leave something . She left a box . It 's up - stairs in my room . I 've got an old bonnet in it . Would you like to see the box ? "
98280	98292	98293	98293	he	155	" If you will be so good as to allow me , "
98296	98306	98293	98293	he	155	" I should very much like to see it . "
98307	98314	98316	98317	Miss Tonks	296	" I 'll fetch it down , "
98319	98326	98316	98317	Miss Tonks	296	" It 's not very big . "
98344	98354	98355	98355	he	155	" How pitiless these women are to each other , "
98364	98444	98359	98360	the teacher	3098	" This one knows intuitively that there is some danger to the other lurking beneath my questions . She sniffs the coming trouble to her fellow female creature , and rejoices in it , and would take any pains to help me . What a world it is , and how these women take life out of her hands . Helen Maldon , Lady Audley , Clara Talboys , and now Miss Tonks all womankind from beginning to end . "
98555	98563	98564	98564	he	155	" The box has been to Italy , "
98567	98587	98564	98564	he	155	" Those are the first four letters of the word Turin , and the label is a foreign one . "
98634	98654	98655	98655	he	155	" Will you be so good as to let me have a little water and a piece of sponge ? "
98658	98680	98655	98655	he	155	" I want to get off this upper label . Believe me that I am justified in what I am doing . "
98700	98708	98709	98709	she	296	" Shall I take off the label ? "
98712	98718	98719	98719	Robert	155	" No , thank you , "
98724	98733	98719	98719	Robert	155	" I can do it very well myself . "
98829	98840	98841	98841	he	155	" I need intrude upon you no longer , ladies , "
98850	98875	98841	98841	he	155	" I am extremely obliged to you for having afforded me all the information in your power . I wish you good - morning . "
98938	98955	98956	98956	he	677	" If that which I have found to - day is no evidence for a jury , "
98959	98978	98956	98956	he	677	" it is surely enough to convince my uncle that he has married a designing and infamous woman . "
99021	99031	99032	99032	he	155	" I have that in my pocket - book , "
99035	99170	99032	99032	he	155	" which forms the connecting link between the woman whose death George Talboys read of in the Times newspaper and the woman who rules in my uncle 's house . The history of Lucy Graham ends abruptly on the threshold of Mrs. Vincent 's school . She entered that establishment in August , 1854 . The schoolmistress and her assistant can tell me this but they can not tell me whence she came . They can not give me one clew to the secrets of her life from the day of her birth until the day she entered that house . I can go no further in this backward investigation of my lady 's antecedents . What am I to do , then , if I mean to keep my promise to Clara Talboys ? "
99215	99222	99223	99223	he	3114	" My duty is clear enough , "
99225	99292	99223	99223	he	3114	" not the less clear because it leads me step by step , carrying ruin and desolation with me , to the home I love . I must begin at the other end I must begin at the other end , and discover the history of Helen Talboys from the hour of George 's departure until the day of the funeral in the churchyard at Ventnor . "
99339	99347	99348	99348	he	3114	" It will save me a day , "
100014	100036	100037	100037	he	155	" I wonder whether settlers in the backwoods of America feel as solitary and strange as I feel to - night ? "
100064	100076	100077	100077	he	155	" Will you carry that to the nearest hotel for me ? "
100079	100094	100077	100077	he	155	" that is to say , if I can get a good bed there . "
100104	100122	100123	100123	he	155	" You can get thirty beds , I dare say , sir , if you wanted 'em , "
100126	100146	100123	100123	he	155	" We ai n't over busy at Wildernsea at this time o ' year . This way , sir . "
100217	100226	100228	100229	the porter	2188	" This is the Victoria Hotel , sir , "
100231	100248	100228	100229	the porter	2188	" You would n't believe the crowds of company we have down here in the summer . "
100466	100476	100477	100478	the man	644	" If you would prefer a private room , sir "
100481	100487	100489	100489	Robert	155	" No , thank you , "
100493	100522	100489	100489	Robert	155	" this room seems quite private enough just now . If you will order me a mutton chop and a pint of sherry , I shall be obliged . "
100523	100528	100563	100564	the landlord	1125	" Certainly , sir . "
100529	100553	100489	100489	Robert	155	" And I shall be still more obliged if you will favor me with a few minutes ' conversation before you do so . "
100554	100562	100563	100564	the landlord	1125	" With very great pleasure , sir , "
100571	100616	100618	100619	the landlord	1125	" We see so very little company at this season of the year , that we are only too glad to oblige those gentlemen who do visit us . Any information which I can afford you respecting the neighborhood of Wildernsea and its attractions , "
100640	100647	100618	100619	the landlord	1125	" I shall be most happy to "
100648	100663	100665	100665	Robert	155	" But I do n't want to know anything about the neighborhood of Wildernsea , "
100677	100694	100665	100665	Robert	155	" I want to ask you a few questions about some people who once lived here . "
100730	100739	100740	100740	Robert	155	" How many years have you lived here ? "
100751	100767	100740	100740	Robert	155	" Will it annoy you if I make notes of your replies to my questions ? "
100768	100775	100777	100778	the landlord	1125	" Not at all , sir , "
100796	100811	100777	100778	the landlord	1125	" Any information which I can afford that is likely to be of ultimate value "
100812	100818	100819	100819	Robert	155	" Yes , thank you , "
100828	100833	100819	100819	Robert	155	" You have lived here "
100834	100840	100777	100778	the landlord	1125	" Six years , sir . "
100841	100849	100819	100819	Robert	155	" Since the year fifty - three ? "
100850	100887	100777	100778	the landlord	1125	" Since November , in the year fifty - two , sir . I was in business at Hull prior to that time . This house was only completed in the October before I entered it . "
100888	100913	100819	100819	Robert	155	" Do you remember a lieutenant in the navy , on half - pay , I believe , at that time , called Maldon ? "
100914	100920	100777	100778	the landlord	1125	" Captain Maldon , sir ? "
100921	100936	100819	100819	Robert	155	" Yes , commonly called Captain Maldon . I see you do remember him . "
100937	101071	100777	100778	the landlord	1125	" Yes , sir . Captain Maldon was one of our best customers . He used to spend his evenings in this very room , though the walls were damp at that time , and we were n't able to paper the place for nearly a twelvemonth afterward . His daughter married a young officer that came here with his regiment , at Christmas time in fifty - two . They were married here , sir , and they traveled on the Continent for six months , and came back here again . But the gentleman ran away to Australia , and left the lady , a week or two after her baby was born . The business made quite a sensation in Wildernsea , sir , and Mrs. Mrs. I forgot the name "
101072	101076	101078	101078	Robert	155	" Mrs. Talboys , "
101080	101132	100777	100778	the landlord	1125	" To be sure , sir , Mrs. Talboys . Mrs. Talboys was very much pitied by the Wildernsea folks , sir , I was going to say , for she was very pretty , and had such nice winning ways that she was a favorite with everybody who knew her . "
101133	101154	101155	101155	Robert	155	" Can you tell me how long Mr. Maldon and his daughter remained at Wildernsea after Mr. Talboys left them ? "
101158	101164	101166	101167	the landlord	1125	" Well no , sir , "
101176	101252	101254	101255	the landlord	1125	" I ca n't say exactly how long it was . I know Mr. Maldon used to sit here in this very parlor , and tell people how badly his daughter had been treated , and how he 'd been deceived by a young man he 'd put so much confidence in ; but I ca n't say how long it was before he left Wildernsea . But Mrs. Barkamb could tell you , sir , "
101259	101263	101254	101255	the landlord	1125	" Mrs. Barkamb . "
101264	101319	101254	101255	the landlord	1125	" Yes , Mrs. Barkamb is the person who owns No . 17 North Cottages , the house in which Mr. Maldon and his daughter lived . She 's a nice , civil spoken , motherly woman , sir , and I 'm sure she 'll tell you anything you may want to know . "
101320	101351	101254	101255	the landlord	1125	" Thank you , I will call upon Mrs. Barkamb to - morrow . Stay one more question . Should you recognize Mrs. Talboys if you were to see her ? "
101352	101369	101254	101255	the landlord	1125	" Certainly , sir . As sure as I should recognize one of my own daughters . "
102086	102095	102096	102096	he	155	" It is such a place as this , "
102099	102308	102096	102096	he	155	" that works a strong man 's ruin . He comes here , heart whole and happy , with no better experience of women than is to be learned at a flower - show or in a ball - room ; with no more familiar knowledge of the creature than he has of the far - away satellites or the remoter planets ; with a vague notion that she is a whirling teetotum in pink or blue gauze , or a graceful automaton for the display of milliners ' manufacture . He comes to some place of this kind , and the universe is suddenly narrowed into about half a dozen acres ; the mighty scheme of creation is crushed into a bandbox . The far - away creatures whom he had seen floating about him , beautiful and indistinct , are brought under his very nose ; and before he has time to recover his bewilderment , hey presto , the witchcraft has begun ; the magic circle is drawn around him ! the spells are at work , the whole formula of sorcery is in full play , and the victim is as powerless to escape as the marble - legged prince in the Eastern story . "
102441	102449	102450	102450	Robert	155	" I should like to live here , "
102453	102492	102450	102450	Robert	155	" and watch the gray sea slowly rolling over the gray sand under the still , gray sky . I should like to live here , and tell the beads upon my rosary , and repent and rest . "
102539	102561	102563	102564	Mrs. Barkamb	299	" You were wishing , I suppose , sir , to take one be quiet , Dash one of the cottages , "
102601	102610	102611	102611	he	155	" I come to ask one simple question , "
102617	102654	102611	102611	he	155	" I wish to discover the exact date of Mrs. Talboys ' departure from Wildernsea . The proprietor of the Victoria Hotel informed me that you were the most likely person to afford me that information . "
102662	102675	102676	102676	she	299	" I can give you the date of Captain Maldon 's departure , "
102679	102708	102676	102676	she	299	" for he left No . 17 considerably in my debt , and I have the whole business in black and white ; but with regard to Mrs. Talboys "
102719	102730	102731	102731	she	299	" You are aware that Mrs. Talboys left rather abruptly ? "
102734	102743	102709	102710	Mrs. Barkamb	299	" I was not aware of that fact . "
102744	102842	102709	102710	Mrs. Barkamb	299	" Indeed ! Yes , she left abruptly , poor little woman ! She tried to support herself after her husband 's desertion by giving music lessons ; she was a very brilliant pianist , and succeeded pretty well , I believe . But I suppose her father took her money from her , and spent it in public houses . However that might be , they had a very serious misunderstanding one night ; and the next morning Mrs. Talboys left Wildernsea , leaving her little boy , who was out at nurse in the neighborhood . "
102843	102856	102709	102710	Mrs. Barkamb	299	" But you can not tell me the date of her leaving ? "
102857	102863	102865	102866	Mrs. Barkamb	299	" I 'm afraid not , "
102868	102927	102865	102866	Mrs. Barkamb	299	" and yet , stay . Captain Maldon wrote to me upon the day his daughter left . He was in very great distress , poor old gentleman , and he always came to me in his troubles . If I could find that letter , it might be dated , you know might n't it , now ? "
103072	103079	103080	103080	she	299	" I 've got the letter , "
103083	103095	103080	103080	she	299	" and there 's a note inside it from Mrs. Talboys . "
103116	103141	103142	103142	he	155	" The persons who stole Helen Maldon 's love - letters from George 's trunk in my chambers might have saved themselves the trouble , "
103163	103168	103169	103170	the writer	2275	" My generous friend , "
103204	103273	103169	103170	the writer	2275	" I am in the depths of despair . My daughter has left me ! You may imagine my feelings ! We had a few words last night upon the subject of money matters , which subject has always been a disagreeable one between us , and on rising this morning I found I was deserted ! The enclosed from Helen was waiting for me on the parlor table .
103274	103280	103169	103170	the writer	2275	" Yours in distraction and despair ,
103281	103284	103169	103170	the writer	2275	" HENRY MALDON .
103285	103294	103169	103170	the writer	2275	" NORTH COTTAGES , August 16th , 1854 . "
103310	103396	103169	103170	the writer	2275	" I am weary of my life here , and wish , if I can , to find a new one . I go out into the world , dissevered from every link which binds me to the hateful past , to seek another home and another fortune . Forgive me if I have been fretful , capricious , changeable . You should forgive me , for you know why I have been so . You know the secret which is the key to my life .
103397	103401	103169	103170	the writer	2275	" HELEN TALBOYS . "
103442	103469	103169	103170	the writer	2275	" You should forgive me , for you know why I have been so . You know the secret which is the key to my life ? "
103621	103635	103636	103636	Robert	155	" Did Mr. Maldon hear from his daughter after she had left Wildernsea ? "
103639	103650	103651	103652	Mrs. Barkamb	299	" Well , I believe he did hear from her , "
103655	103747	103651	103652	Mrs. Barkamb	299	" but I did n't see much of the old gentleman after that August . I was obliged to sell him up in November , poor fellow , for he owed me fifteen months ' rent ; and it was only by selling his poor little bits of furniture that I could get him out of my place . We parted very good friends , in spite of my sending in the brokers ; and the old gentleman went to London with the child , who was scarcely a twelvemonth old . "
103854	103871	103872	103872	he	155	" I have traced the histories of Lucy Graham and Helen Talboys to a vanishing point , "
103875	103894	103872	103872	he	155	" my next business is to discover the history of the woman who lies buried in Ventnor churchyard . "
103925	103931	103932	103934	the young lady	1080	" Papa is much better , "
103937	103998	103932	103934	the young lady	1080	" and is very anxious to have you at the Court . For some inexplicable reason , my stepmother has taken it into her head that your presence is extremely desirable , and worries me with her frivolous questions about your movements . So pray come without delay , and set these people at rest . Your affectionate cousin , A.A. "
103999	104010	104012	104013	Robert Audley	155	" So my lady is anxious to know my movements , "
104026	104118	104016	104016	he	155	" She is anxious ; and she questions her step - daughter in that pretty , childlike manner which has such a bewitching air of innocent frivolity . Poor little creature ; poor unhappy little golden - haired sinner ; the battle between us seems terribly unfair . Why does n't she run away while there is still time ? I have given her fair warning , I have shown her my cards , and worked openly enough in this business , Heaven knows . Why does n't she run away ? "
104155	104262	104127	104127	he	155	" Why does n't she run away ? I would bring no needless shame upon that house , of all other houses upon this wide earth . I would only do my duty to my missing friend , and to that brave and generous man who has pledged his faith to a worthless woman . Heaven knows I have no wish to punish . Heaven knows I was never born to be the avenger of guilt or the persecutor of the guilty . I only wish to do my duty . I will give her one more warning , a full and fair one , and then "
104382	104390	104391	104391	he	3266	" Shall I go down to Southampton , "
104394	104549	104391	104391	he	3266	" and endeavor to discover the history of the woman who died at Ventnor ? Shall I work underground , bribing the paltry assistants in that foul conspiracy , until I find my way to the thrice guilty principal ? No ! not till I have tried other means of discovering the truth . Shall I go to that miserable old man , and charge him with his share in the shameful trick which I believe to have been played upon my poor friend ? No ; I will not torture that terror - stricken wretch as I tortured him a few weeks ago . I will go straight to that arch - conspirator , and will tear away the beautiful veil under which she hides her wickedness , and will wring from her the secret of my friend 's fate , and banish her forever from the house which her presence has polluted . "
104696	104709	104710	104710	Robert	155	" If I could forgive her the wrong done to my friend , "
104713	104735	104710	104710	Robert	155	" I should still abhor her for the misery her guilt must bring upon the man who has believed in her . "
104799	104807	104808	104808	he	155	" I will go into the churchyard , "
104811	104834	104808	104808	he	155	" and stare at the tombstones . There is nothing I can do that will make me more gloomy than I am . "
104903	104913	104914	104914	he	155	" Why did that unaccountable terror seize upon me , "
104917	105061	105062	105062	he	155	" Why was it that I saw some strange mystery in my friend 's disappearance ? Was it a monition , or a monomania ? What if I am wrong after all ? What if this chain of evidence which I have constructed link by link , is woven out of my own folly ? What if this edifice of horror and suspicion is a mere collection of crotchets the nervous fancies of a hypochondriacal bachelor ? Mr. Harcourt Talboys sees no meaning in the events out of which I have made myself a horrible mystery . I lay the separate links of the chain before him , and he can not recognize their fitness . He is unable to put them together . Oh , my God , if it should be in myself all this time that the misery lies ; if "
105071	105089	105090	105090	he	155	" I have the handwriting in my pocket - book which is the evidence of the conspiracy , "
105093	105109	105090	105090	he	155	" It remains for me to discover the darker half of my lady 's secret . "
105368	105382	105384	105384	Robert	155	" Who would have believed that Audley church could boast such an organ ? "
105386	105422	105384	105384	Robert	155	" When last I was here , the national schoolmaster used to accompany his children by a primitive performance of common chords . I did n't think the old organ had such music in it . "
105715	105768	105774	105774	he	155	" If my poor friend , George Talboys , had died in my arms , and I had buried him in this quiet church , in one corner of the vaults over which I tread to - day , how much anguish of mind , vacillation and torment I might have escaped , "
105785	105826	105774	105774	he	155	" I should have known his fate I should have known his fate ! Ah , how much there would have been in that . It is this miserable uncertainty , this horrible suspicion which has poisoned my very life . "
105833	105839	105840	105840	he	155	" Half - past one , "
105843	105930	105840	105840	he	155	" I shall have to wait four or five dreary hours before my lady comes home from her morning calls her pretty visits of ceremony or friendliness . Good Heaven ! what an actress this woman is . What an arch trickster what an all - accomplished deceiver . But she shall play her pretty comedy no longer under my uncle 's roof . I have diplomatized long enough . She has refused to accept an indirect warning . To - night I will speak plainly . "
105947	105958	105959	105959	he	155	" I 'll have a look at this new organist , "
105962	105988	105959	105959	he	155	" who can afford to bury his talents at Audley , and play Mendelssohn 's finest fugues for a stipend of sixteen pounds a year . "
106297	106324	106293	106293	he	155	" A hand that is stronger than my own is beckoning me onward on the dark road that leads to my lost friend 's unknown grave . "
106333	106345	106346	106346	she	272	" You are surprised to see me here , Mr. Audley , "
106349	106354	106325	106326	Clara Talboys	272	" Very much surprised . "
106355	106476	106325	106326	Clara Talboys	272	" I told you that I was coming to Essex . I left home day before yesterday . I was leaving home when I received your telegraphic message . The friend with whom I am staying is Mrs. Martyn , the wife of the new rector of Mount Stanning . I came down this morning to see the village and church , and as Mrs. Martyn had to pay a visit to the school with the curate and his wife , I stopped here and amused myself by trying the old organ . I was not aware till I came here that there was a village called Audley . The place takes its name from your family , I suppose ? "
106477	106482	106483	106483	Robert	155	" I believe so , "
106500	106569	106483	106483	Robert	155	" I have a vague recollection of hearing the story of some ancestor who was called Audley of Audley in the reign of Edward the Fourth . The tomb inside the rails near the altar belongs to one of the knights of Audley , but I have never taken the trouble to remember his achievements . Are you going to wait here for your friends , Miss Talboys ? "
106570	106587	106665	106665	she	272	" Yes ; they are to return here for me after they have finished their rounds . "
106588	106601	106483	106483	Robert	155	" And you go back to Mount Stanning with them this afternoon ? "
106602	106605	106665	106665	she	272	" Yes . "
106650	106664	106665	106665	she	272	" You have been ill since I saw you last , Mr. Audley , "
106690	106713	106665	106665	she	272	" No , I have not been ill ; I have been only harassed , wearied by a hundred doubts and perplexities . "
106723	106736	106714	106714	He	155	" How much does she guess ? How much does she suspect ? "
106811	106819	106820	106820	he	155	" What am I in her hands ? "
106823	106900	106799	106799	she	272	" What am I in the hands of this woman , who has my lost friend 's face and the manner of Pallas Athene . She reads my pitiful , vacillating soul , and plucks the thoughts out of my heart with the magic of her solemn brown eyes . How unequal the fight must be between us , and how can I ever hope to conquer against the strength of her beauty and her wisdom ? "
106954	106965	106966	106966	she	272	" You promised to write to me , Mr. Audley , "
106969	107007	106966	106966	she	272	" if you made any discovery which carried you nearer to the mystery of my brother 's disappearance . You have not written to me , and I imagine , therefore , that you have discovered nothing . "
107024	107046	107047	107047	he	155	" The chain of circumstantial evidence which unites the mystery of your brother 's fate with the person whom I suspect , "
107054	107080	107047	107047	he	155	" is formed of very slight links . I think that I have added another link to that chain since I saw you in Dorsetshire . "
107081	107096	107018	107018	he	155	" And you refuse to tell me what it is that you have discovered ? "
107097	107105	107047	107047	he	155	" Only until I have discovered more . "
107106	107119	107018	107018	he	155	" I thought from your message that you were going to Wildernsea . "
107120	107126	107047	107047	he	155	" I have been there . "
107127	107141	107018	107018	he	155	" Indeed ! It was there that you made some discovery , then ? "
107142	107146	107148	107148	Robert	155	" It was , "
107150	107303	107148	107148	Robert	155	" You must remember , Miss Talboys that the sole ground upon which my suspicions rest is the identity of two individuals who have no apparent connection the identity of a person who is supposed to be dead with one who is living . The conspiracy of which I believe your brother to have been the victim hinges upon this . If his wife , Helen Talboys , died when the papers recorded her death if the woman who lies buried in Ventnor churchyard was indeed the woman whose name is inscribed on the headstone of the grave I have no case , I have no clew to the mystery of your brother 's fate . I am about to put this to the test . I believe that I am now in a position to play a bold game , and I believe that I shall soon arrive at the truth . "
107354	107371	107372	107372	she	272	" You will not suffer my brother 's fate to remain a mystery , Mr. Audley , "
107377	107390	107372	107372	she	272	" I know that you will do your duty to your friend . "
107426	107442	107443	107443	he	155	" I am a lazy , good - for - nothing fellow , Miss Talboys , "
107446	107504	107443	107443	he	155	" but if I could restore your brother George to life and happiness , I should care very little for any sacrifice of my own feeling , fear that the most I can do is to fathom the secret of his fate and in doing that I must sacrifice those who are dearer to me than myself . "
107529	107548	107549	107549	she	302	" Who is that handsome young man I caught tete - a - tete with you , Clara ? "
107554	107569	107521	107522	Mrs. Martyn	302	" He is a Mr. Audley , a friend of my poor brother 's . "
107570	107585	107521	107522	Mrs. Martyn	302	" Indeed ! He is some relation of Sir Michael Audley , I suppose ? "
107586	107591	107521	107522	Mrs. Martyn	302	" Sir Michael Audley ! "
107592	107633	107521	107522	Mrs. Martyn	302	" Yes , my dear ; the most important personage in the parish of Audley . But we 'll call at the Court in a day or two , and you shall see the baronet and his pretty young wife . "
107634	107639	107641	107642	Clara Talboys	272	" His young wife ! "
107650	107660	107641	107642	Clara Talboys	272	" Has Sir Michael Audley lately married , then ? "
107661	107728	107521	107522	Mrs. Martyn	302	" Yes . He was a widower for sixteen years , and married a penniless young governess about a year and a half ago . The story is quite romantic , and Lady Audley is considered the belle of the county . But come , my dear Clara , the pony is tired of waiting for us , and we 've a long drive before dinner . "
107785	107798	107799	107800	Miss Talboys	272	" Will you tell me more about this Lady Audley , Fanny ? "
107808	107824	107799	107800	Miss Talboys	272	" I want to know all about her . Have you heard her maiden name ? "
107825	107834	107898	107898	She	272	" Yes ; she was a Miss Graham . "
107835	107842	107799	107800	Miss Talboys	272	" And she is very pretty ? "
107843	107881	107898	107898	She	272	" Yes , very , very pretty . Rather a childish beauty though , with large , clear blue eyes , and pale golden ringlets , that fall in a feathery shower over her throat and shoulders . "
107923	107990	107920	107920	he	3368	" My childish little wife is watching me as I write this Ah ! how I wish you could see her , Clara ! Her eyes are as blue and as clear as the skies on a bright summer 's day , and her hair falls about her face like the pale golden halo you see round the head of a Madonna in an Italian picture . "
108100	108111	108112	108112	she	477	" So you have come back to us , truant ? "
108117	108145	108112	108112	she	477	" And now that you have returned , we shall keep you prisoner . We wo n't let him run away again , will we , Alicia ? "
108164	108179	108180	108180	she	477	" I have nothing to do with the movements of so erratic an individual , "
108183	108216	108180	108180	she	477	" Since Robert Audley has taken it into his head to conduct himself like some ghost - haunted hero in a German story , I have given up attempting to understand him . "
108232	108239	108240	108240	he	155	" She 's a nice girl , "
108243	108270	108240	108240	he	155	" but she 's a nuisance . I do n't know how it is , but she seems more a nuisance than she used to be . "
108304	108311	108312	108312	he	155	" She 's a dear girl , "
108315	108329	108312	108312	he	155	" a generous - hearted , bouncing , noble English lassie ; and yet "
108378	108396	108402	108402	she	477	" And pray where have you been wandering during the last day or two , Mr. Audley ? "
108488	108495	108496	108496	he	677	" I have been in Yorkshire , "
108499	108519	108496	108496	he	677	" at the little watering place where my poor friend George Talboys lived at the time of his marriage . "
108557	108564	108565	108565	she	477	" I must dress for dinner , "
108568	108587	108565	108565	she	477	" I am going to a dinner - party , Mr. Audley ; please let me go in . "
108588	108603	108604	108604	Robert	155	" I must ask you to spare me half an hour , Lady Audley , "
108612	108625	108604	108604	Robert	155	" I came down to Essex on purpose to speak to you . "
108626	108630	108632	108633	my lady	477	" What about ? "
108687	108701	108702	108702	she	477	" What can you want to talk to me about , Mr. Audley ? "
108705	108715	108716	108716	Robert	155	" I will tell you when we are alone , "
108739	108755	108757	108757	Alicia	163	" He is in love with my step - mother 's wax - doll beauty , "
108759	108789	108757	108757	Alicia	163	" and it is for her sake he has become such a disconsolate object . He 's just the sort of person to fall in love with his aunt . "
108809	108824	108825	108825	she	163	" The absurd creature turned as white as a sheet when he saw her , "
108828	108907	108825	108825	she	163	" So he can be in love , after all . That slow lump of torpidity he calls his heart can beat , I suppose , once in a quarter of a century ; but it seems that nothing but a blue - eyed wax - doll can set it going . I should have given him up long ago if I 'd known that his idea of beauty was to be found in a toy - shop . "
108977	108990	108992	108992	Robert	155	" Will you come into the lime - walk , Lady Audley ? "
109001	109033	108992	108992	Robert	155	" I wish to talk to you without fear of interruption or observation . I think we could choose no safer place than that . Will you come there with me ? "
109034	109039	109041	109042	my lady	477	" If you please , "
109074	109082	109083	109083	he	155	" You are shivering , Lady Audley , "
109086	109151	109055	109055	she	477	" Yes , I am very cold . I would rather speak to you some other day , please . Let it be to - morrow , if you will . I have to dress for dinner , and I want to see Sir Michael ; I have not seen him since ten o'clock this morning . Please let it be to - morrow . "
109198	109208	109209	109209	he	155	" I must speak to you , Lady Audley , "
109212	109285	109209	109209	he	155	" If I am cruel , it is you who have made me cruel . You might have escaped this ordeal . You might have avoided me . I gave you fair warning . But you have chosen to defy me , and it is your own folly which is to blame if I no longer spare you . Come with me . I tell you again I must speak to you . "
109386	109405	109407	109408	my lady	477	" Why do you bring me to this horrible place to frighten me out of my poor wits ? "
109412	109422	109407	109408	my lady	477	" You ought to know how nervous I am . "
109423	109431	109694	109695	Robert Audley	155	" You are nervous , my lady ? "
109432	109477	109407	109408	my lady	477	" Yes , dreadfully nervous . I am worth a fortune to poor Mr. Dawson . He is always sending me camphor , and sal volatile , and red lavender , and all kinds of abominable mixtures , but he ca n't cure me . "
109478	109491	109493	109493	Robert	155	" Do you remember what Macbeth tells his physician , my lady ? "
109497	109526	109493	109493	Robert	155	" Mr. Dawson may be very much more clever than the Scottish leech , but I doubt if even he can minister to the mind that is diseased . "
109527	109536	109538	109539	Lady Audley	211	" Who said that my mind was diseased ? "
109541	109549	109551	109551	Robert	155	" I say so , my lady , "
109553	109653	109551	109551	Robert	155	" You tell me that you are nervous , and that all the medicines your doctor can prescribe are only so much physic that might as well be thrown to the dogs . Let me be the physician to strike to the root of your malady , Lady Audley . Heaven knows that I wish to be merciful that I would spare you as far as it is in my power to spare you in doing justice to others but justice must be done . Shall I tell you why you are nervous in this house , my lady ? "
109654	109659	109660	109660	she	3409	" If you can , "
109668	109677	109551	109551	Robert	155	" Because for you this house is haunted . "
109678	109681	109551	109551	Robert	155	" Haunted ? "
109682	109693	109551	109551	Robert	155	" Yes , haunted by the ghost of George Talboys . "
109737	109743	109744	109744	she	3409	" What do you mean ? "
109755	109820	109744	109744	she	3409	" Why do you torment me about this George Talboys , who happens to have taken it into his head to keep out of your way for a few months ? Are you going mad , Mr. Audley , and do you select me as the victim of your monomania ? What is George Talboys to me that you should worry me about him ? "
109821	109836	109886	109887	Lady Audley	211	" He was a stranger to you , my lady , was he not ? "
109837	109841	109843	109844	Lady Audley	211	" Of course ! "
109846	109855	109843	109844	Lady Audley	211	" What should he be but a stranger ? "
109856	109877	109879	109879	Robert	155	" Shall I tell you the story of my friend 's disappearance as I read that story , my lady ? "
109881	109884	109886	109887	Lady Audley	211	" No , "
109889	109962	109886	109887	Lady Audley	211	" I wish to know nothing of your friend . If he is dead , I am sorry for him . If he lives , I have no wish either to see him or to hear of him . Let me go in to see my husband , if you please , Mr. Audley , unless you wish to detain me in this gloomy place until I catch my death of cold . "
109963	109982	109984	109984	Robert	155	" I wish to detain you until you have heard what I have to say , Lady Audley , "
109988	110014	109984	109984	Robert	155	" I will detain you no longer than is necessary , and when you have heard me you shall take your own course of action . "
110015	110033	110035	110036	my lady	477	" Very well , then ; pray lose no time in saying what you have to say , "
110040	110049	110035	110036	my lady	477	" I promise you to attend very patiently . "
110050	110062	110063	110063	Robert	155	" When my friend , George Talboys , returned to England , "
110068	110084	110063	110063	Robert	155	" the thought which was uppermost in his mind was the thought of his wife . "
110085	110091	110093	110094	my lady	477	" Whom he had deserted , "
110098	110102	110103	110103	she	477	" At least , "
110109	110129	110103	110103	she	477	" I remember your telling us something to that effect when you first told us your friend 's story . "
110138	110154	110155	110155	he	155	" The thought that was uppermost in his mind was the thought of his wife , "
110158	110308	110155	110155	he	155	" His fairest hope in the future was the hope of making her happy , and lavishing upon her the pittance which he had won by the force of his own strong arm in the gold - fields of Australia . I saw him within a few hours of his reaching England , and I was a witness to the joyful pride with which he looked forward to his re - union with his wife . I was also a witness to the blow which struck him to the very heart which changed him from the man he had been to a creature as unlike that former self as one human being can be unlike another . The blow which made that cruel change was the announcement of his wife 's death in the Times newspaper . I now believe that that announcement was a black and bitter lie . "
110309	110312	110314	110315	my lady	477	" Indeed ! "
110317	110340	110314	110315	my lady	477	" and what reason could any one have for announcing the death of Mrs. Talboys , if Mrs. Talboys had been alive ? "
110341	110351	110352	110352	Robert	155	" The lady herself might have had a reason , "
110357	110361	110314	110315	my lady	477	" What reason ? "
110362	110401	110314	110315	my lady	477	" How if she had taken advantage of George 's absence to win a richer husband ? How if she had married again , and wished to throw my poor friend off the scent by this false announcement ? "
110408	110418	110419	110419	she	211	" Your suppositions are rather ridiculous , Mr. Audley , "
110422	110437	110419	110419	she	211	" it is to be hoped that you have some reasonable grounds for them . "
110438	110455	110457	110457	Robert	155	" I have examined a file of each of the newspapers published in Chelmsford and Colchester , "
110468	110611	110457	110457	Robert	155	" and I find in one of the Colchester papers , dated July the 2d , 1857 , a brief paragraph among numerous miscellaneous scraps of information copied from other newspapers , to the effect that a Mr. George Talboys , an English gentleman , had arrived at Sydney from the gold - fields , carrying with him nuggets and gold - dust to the amount of twenty thousand pounds , and that he had realized his property and sailed for Liverpool in the fast - sailing clipper Argus . This is a very small fact , of course , Lady Audley , but it is enough to prove that any person residing in Essex in the July of the year fifty - seven , was likely to become aware of George Talboys ' return from Australia . Do you follow me ? "
110612	110617	110619	110620	my lady	477	" Not very clearly , "
110622	110637	110619	110620	my lady	477	" What have the Essex papers to do with the death of Mrs. Talboys ? "
110638	110691	110419	110419	she	211	" We will come to that by - and - by , Lady Audley . I say that I believe the announcement in the Times to have been a false announcement , and a part of the conspiracy which was carried out by Helen Talboys and Lieutenant Maldon against my poor friend . "
110692	110696	110619	110620	my lady	477	" A conspiracy ! "
110697	110905	110419	110419	she	211	" Yes , a conspiracy concocted by an artful woman , who had speculated upon the chances of her husband 's death , and had secured a splendid position at the risk of committing a crime ; a bold woman , my lady , who thought to play her comedy out to the end without fear of detection ; a wicked woman , who did not care what misery she might inflict upon the honest heart of the man she betrayed ; but a foolish woman , who looked at life as a game of chance , in which the best player was likely to hold the winning cards , forgetting that there is a Providence above the pitiful speculators , and that wicked secrets are never permitted to remain long hidden . If this woman of whom I speak had never been guilty of any blacker sin than the publication of that lying announcement in the Times newspaper , I should still hold her as the most detestable and despicable of her sex the most pitiless and calculating of human creatures . That cruel lie was a base and cowardly blow in the dark ; it was the treacherous dagger - thrust of an infamous assassin . "
110906	110920	110922	110923	my lady	477	" But how do you know that the announcement was a false one ? "
110925	110959	110922	110923	my lady	477	" You told us that you had been to Ventnor with Mr. Talboys to see his wife 's grave . Who was it who died at Ventnor if it was not Mrs. Talboys ? "
110960	110966	110968	110968	Robert	155	" Ah , Lady Audley , "
110970	111173	110968	110968	Robert	155	" that is a question which only two or three people can answer , and one or other of those persons shall answer it to me before long . I tell you , my lady , that I am determined to unravel the mystery of George Talboy 's death . Do you think I am to be put off by feminine prevarication by womanly trickery ? No ! Link by link I have put together the chain of evidence , which wants but a link here and there to be complete in its terrible strength . Do you think I will suffer myself to be baffled ? Do you think I shall fail to discover those missing links ? No , Lady Audley , I shall not fail , for I know where to look for them ! There is a fair - haired woman at Southampton a woman called Plowson , who has some share in the secrets of the father of my friend 's wife . I have an idea that she can help me to discover the history of the woman who lies buried in Ventnor churchyard , and I will spare no trouble in making that discovery , unless "
111174	111178	111180	111181	my lady	477	" Unless what ? "
111185	111213	111214	111214	My	0	" Unless the woman I wish to save from degradation and punishment accepts the mercy I offer her , and takes warning while there is still time . "
111231	111251	111252	111252	she	477	" She would be a very foolish woman if she suffered herself to be influenced by any such absurdity , "
111255	111484	111489	111489	her	477	" You are hypochondriacal , Mr. Audley , and you must take camphor , or red lavender , or sal volatile . What can be more ridiculous than this idea which you have taken into your head ? You lose your friend George Talboys in rather a mysterious manner that is to say , that gentleman chooses to leave England without giving you due notice . What of that ? You confess that he became an altered man after his wife 's death . He grew eccentric and misanthropical ; he affected an utter indifference as to what became of him . What more likely , then , than that he grew tired of the monotony of civilized life , and ran away to those savage gold - fields to find a distraction for his grief ? It is rather a romantic story , but by no means an uncommon one . But you are not satisfied with this simple interpretation of your friend 's disappearance , and you build up some absurd theory of a conspiracy which has no existence except in your own overheated brain . Helen Talboys is dead . The Times newspaper declares she is dead . Her own father tells you that she is dead . The headstone of the grave in Ventnor churchyard bears record of her death . By what right , "
111507	111542	111489	111489	her	477	" by what right , Mr. Audley , do you come to me , and torment me about George Talboys by what right do you dare to say that his wife is still alive ? "
111543	111554	111556	111556	Robert	155	" By the right of circumstantial evidence , Lady Audley , "
111557	111601	111489	111489	her	477	" by the right of that circumstantial evidence which will sometimes fix the guilt of a man 's murder upon that person who , on the first hearing of the case , seems of all other men the most unlikely to be guilty . "
111602	111607	111556	111556	Robert	155	" What circumstantial evidence ? "
111608	111673	111489	111489	her	477	" The evidence of time and place . The evidence of handwriting . When Helen Talboys left her father 's at Wildernsea , she left a letter behind her a letter in which she declared that she was weary of her old life , and that she wished to seek a new home and a new fortune . That letter is in my possession . "
111674	111677	111556	111556	Robert	155	" Indeed . "
111678	111706	111489	111489	her	477	" Shall I tell you whose handwriting resembles that of Helen Talboys so closely , that the most dexterous expert could perceive no distinction between the two ? "
111707	111727	111729	111730	my lady	477	" A resemblance between the handwriting of two women is no very uncommon circumstance now - a - days , "
111733	111760	111729	111730	my lady	477	" I could show you the caligraphies of half - a - dozen female correspondents , and defy you to discover any great difference in them . "
111761	111786	111489	111489	her	477	" But what if the handwriting is a very uncommon one , presenting marked peculiarities by which it may be recognized among a hundred ? "
111787	111799	111801	111802	my lady	477	" Why , in that case the coincidence is rather curious , "
111804	111837	111801	111802	my lady	477	" but it is nothing more than a coincidence . You can not deny the fact of Helen Talboys death on the ground that her handwriting resembles that of some surviving person . "
111838	111853	111855	111855	Robert	155	" But if a series of such coincidences lead up to the same point , "
111857	111901	111855	111855	Robert	155	" Helen Talboys left her father 's house , according to the declaration in her own handwriting , because she was weary of her old life , and wished to begin a new one . Do you know what I infer from this ? "
111908	111916	111917	111917	she	477	" I have not the least idea , "
111920	111956	111917	111917	she	477	" and as you have detained me in this gloomy place nearly half - an - hour , I must beg that you will release me , and let me go and dress for dinner . "
111957	111963	111965	111965	Robert	155	" No , Lady Audley , "
111995	112001	112002	112002	he	155	" no , Lady Audley , "
112005	112055	112002	112002	he	155	" I have told you that womanly prevarication will not help you ; I tell you now that defiance will not serve you . I have dealt fairly with you , and have given you fair warning . I gave you indirect notice of your danger two months ago . "
112056	112062	112064	112065	my lady	477	" What do you mean ? "
112069	112082	112084	112084	Robert	155	" You did not choose to take that warning , Lady Audley , "
112086	112322	112084	112084	Robert	155	" and the time has come in which I must speak very plainly to you . Do you think the gifts which you have played against fortune are to hold you exempt from retribution ? No , my lady , your youth and beauty , your grace and refinement , only make the horrible secret of your life more horrible . I tell you that the evidence against you wants only one link to be strong enough for your condemnation , and that link shall be added . Helen Talboys never returned to her father 's house . When she deserted that poor old father , she went away from his humble shelter with the declared intention of washing her hands of that old life . What do people generally do when they wish to begin a new existence to start for a second time in the race of life , free from the incumbrances that had fettered their first journey . They change their names , Lady Audley . Helen Talboys deserted her infant son she went away from Wildernsea with the predetermination of sinking her identity . She disappeared as Helen Talboys upon the 16th of August , 1854 , and upon the 17th of that month she reappeared as Lucy Graham , the friendless girl who undertook a profitless duty in consideration of a home in which she was asked no questions . "
112323	112331	112333	112334	my lady	477	" You are mad , Mr. Audley ! "
112336	112381	112333	112334	my lady	477	" You are mad , and my husband shall protect me from your insolence . What if this Helen Talboys ran away from her home upon one day , and I entered my employer 's house upon the next , what does that prove ? "
112382	112389	112391	112392	Robert Audley	155	" By itself , very little , "
112394	112402	112391	112392	Robert Audley	155	" but with the help of other evidence "
112403	112407	112333	112334	my lady	477	" What evidence ? "
112408	112451	112391	112392	Robert Audley	155	" The evidence of two labels , pasted one over the other , upon a box left by you in possession of Mrs. Vincent , the upper label bearing the name of Miss Graham , the lower that of Mrs. George Talboys . "
112497	112507	112508	112508	he	155	" God help her , poor , wretched creature , "
112511	112589	112508	112508	he	155	" She knows now that she is lost . I wonder if the judges of the land feel as I do now when they put on the black cap and pass sentence of death upon some poor , shivering wretch , who has never done them any wrong . Do they feel a heroic fervor of virtuous indignation , or do they suffer this dull anguish which gnaws my vitals as I talk to this helpless woman ? "
112875	112887	112888	112888	he	155	" Those two labels are in my possession , Lady Audley , "
112891	113025	112888	112888	he	155	" I took them from the box left by you at Crescent Villas . I took them in the presence of Mrs. Vincent and Miss Tonks . Have you any proofs to offer against this evidence ? You say to me , ' I am Lucy Graham and I have nothing whatever to do with Helen Talboys . ' In that case you will produce witnesses who will declare your antecedents . Where had you been living prior to your appearance at Crescent Villas ? You must have friends , relations , connections , who can come forward to prove as much as this for you ? If you were the most desolate creature upon this earth , you would be able to point to someone who could identify you with the past . "
113026	113029	113031	113032	my lady	477	" Yes , "
113034	113187	113031	113032	my lady	477	" if I were placed in a criminal dock I could , no doubt , bring forward witnesses to refute your absurd accusation . But I am not in a criminal dock , Mr. Audley , and I do not choose to do anything but laugh at your ridiculous folly . I tell you that you are mad ! If you please to say that Helen Talboys is not dead , and that I am Helen Talboys , you may do so . If you choose to go wandering about in the places in which I have lived , and to the places in which this Mrs. Talboys has lived , you must follow the bent of your own inclination , but I would warn you that such fancies have sometimes conducted people , as apparently sane as yourself , to the life - long imprisonment of a private lunatic - asylum . "
113207	113227	113228	113228	he	155	" She would be capable of any new crime to shield her from the consequences of the old one , "
113231	113252	113228	113228	he	155	" She would be capable of using her influence with my uncle to place me in a mad - house . "
113319	113526	113536	113536	he	3448	" What if this woman 's hellish power of dissimulation should be stronger than the truth , and crush him ? She had not spared George Talboys when he stood in her way and menaced her with a certain peril ; would she spare him who threatened her with a far greater danger ? Are women merciful , or loving , or kind in proportion to their beauty and grace ? Was there not a certain Monsieur Mazers de Latude , who had the bad fortune to offend the all - accomplished Madam de Pompadour , who expiated his youthful indiscretion by a life - long imprisonment ; who twice escaped from prison , to be twice cast back into captivity ; who , trusting in the tardy generosity of his beautiful foe , betrayed himself to an implacable fiend ? Robert Audley looked at the pale face of the woman standing by his side ; that fair and beautiful face , illumined by starry - blue eyes , that had a strange and surely a dangerous light in them ; and remembering a hundred stories of womanly perfidy , shuddered as he thought how unequal the struggle might be between himself and his uncle 's wife .
113527	113535	113536	113536	he	3448	" I have shown her my cards , "
113539	113573	113536	113536	he	3448	" but she has kept hers hidden from me . The mask that she wears is not to be plucked away . My uncle would rather think me mad than believe her guilty . "
113601	113616	113617	113617	he	3448	" What a coward I am to think of myself or my own danger , "
113620	113652	113617	113617	he	3448	" The more I see of this woman the more reason I have to dread her influence upon others ; the more reason to wish her far away from this house . "
113687	113706	113707	113707	he	3448	" It was somewhere in this garden that she met George Talboys upon the day of his disappearance , "
113710	113738	113707	113707	he	3448	" I wonder where it was they met ; I wonder where it was that he looked into her cruel face and taxed her with her falsehood ? "
113780	113796	113798	113799	Robert Audley	155	" It is to be a duel to the death , then , my lady , "
113803	113850	113798	113799	Robert Audley	155	" You refuse to accept my warning . You refuse to run away and repent of your wickedness in some foreign place , far from the generous gentleman you have deceived and fooled by your false witcheries . You choose to remain here and defy me . "
113851	113855	113857	113858	Lady Audley	211	" I do , "
113871	113896	113861	113861	her	211	" It is no fault of mine if my husband 's nephew goes mad , and chooses me for the victim of his monomania . "
113897	113907	113909	113909	Robert	155	" So be it , then , my lady , "
113911	114033	113909	113909	Robert	155	" My friend George Talboys was last seen entering these gardens by the little iron gate by which we came in to - night . He was last heard inquiring for you . He was seen to enter these gardens , but he was never seen to leave them . I believe that he met his death within the boundary of these grounds ; and that his body lies hidden below some quiet water , or in some forgotten corner of this place . I will have such a search made as shall level that house to the earth and root up every tree in these gardens , rather than I will fail in finding the grave of my murdered friend . "
114101	114110	114111	114111	she	211	" You shall never live to do this , "
114114	114192	114111	114111	she	211	" I will kill you first . Why have you tormented me so ? Why could you not let me alone ? What harm had I ever done you that you should make yourself my persecutor , and dog my steps , and watch my looks , and play the spy upon me ? Do you want to drive me mad ? Do you know what it is to wrestle with a mad - woman ? No , "
114201	114210	114111	114111	she	211	" you do not , or you would never "
114252	114259	114260	114260	she	477	" Go away , Mr. Audley , "
114263	114276	114260	114260	she	477	" You are mad , I tell you , you are mad . "
114277	114285	114287	114287	Robert	155	" I am going , my lady , "
114291	114333	114287	114287	Robert	155	" I would have condoned your crimes out of pity to your wretcheness . You have refused to accept my mercy . I wished to have pity upon the living . I shall henceforth only remember my duty to the dead . "
114415	114426	114427	114427	she	203	" I have been looking for you everywhere , Robert , "
114430	114447	114427	114427	she	203	" Papa has come down to the library , and will be glad to see you . "
114463	114467	114468	114468	he	677	" Good Heaven ! "
114471	114522	114468	114468	he	677	" can these two women be of the same clay ? Can this frank , generous - hearted girl , who can not conceal any impulse of her innocent nature , be of the same flesh and blood as that wretched creature whose shadow falls upon the path beside me ! "
114550	114566	114568	114569	my lady	477	" I do n't know what has come to your cousin , my dear Alicia , "
114571	114588	114568	114569	my lady	477	" He is so absent - minded and eccentric as to be quite beyond my comprehension . "
114589	114592	114594	114595	Miss Audley	163	" Indeed , "
114597	114625	114594	114595	Miss Audley	163	" and yet I should imagine , from the length of your tete - a - tete , that you had made some effort to understand him . "
114626	114631	114633	114633	Robert	155	" Oh , yes , "
114637	114698	114633	114633	Robert	155	" my lady and I understand each other very well ; but as it is growing late I will wish you good - evening , ladies . I shall sleep to - night at Mount Stanning , as I have some business to attend to up there , and I will come down and see my uncle to - morrow . "
114699	114704	114706	114706	Alicia	163	" What , Robert , "
114708	114719	114706	114706	Alicia	163	" you surely wo n't go away without seeing papa ? "
114720	114726	114728	114730	the young man	677	" Yes , my dear , "
114732	114774	114728	114730	the young man	677	" I am a little disturbed by some disagreeable business in which I am very much concerned , and I would rather not see my uncle . Good - night , Alicia . I will come or write to - morrow . "
114822	114836	114838	114839	Miss Audley	163	" What in goodness ' name is the matter with my Cousin Robert ? "
114848	114905	114838	114839	Miss Audley	163	" What does he mean by these absurd goings - on ? Some disagreeable business that disturbs him , indeed ! I suppose the unhappy creature has had a brief forced upon him by some evil - starred attorney , and is sinking into a state of imbecility from a dim consciousness of his own incompetence . "
114906	114918	114920	114921	my lady	477	" Have you ever studied your cousin 's character , Alicia ? "
114930	114947	114949	114949	Alicia	163	" Studied his character ! No , Lady Audley . Why should I study his character ? "
114951	114984	114949	114949	Alicia	163	" There is very little study required to convince anybody that he is a lazy , selfish Sybarite , who cares for nothing in the world except his own ease and comfort . "
114985	114994	115051	115051	my	0	" But have you never thought him eccentric ? "
114995	114998	115000	115000	Alicia	163	" Eccentric ! "
115013	115035	115000	115000	Alicia	163	" Well , yes I believe that is the excuse generally made for such people . I suppose Bob is eccentric . "
115036	115049	115051	115052	my lady	477	" I have never heard you speak of his father and mother , "
115056	115062	115051	115052	my lady	477	" Do you remember them ? "
115063	115109	115000	115000	Alicia	163	" I never saw his mother . She was a Miss Dalrymple , a very dashing girl , who ran away with my uncle , and lost a very handsome fortune in consequence . She died at Nice when poor Bob was five years old . "
115110	115120	115051	115052	my lady	477	" Did you ever hear anything particular about her ? "
115121	115130	115132	115132	Alicia	163	" How do you mean ' particular ? ' "
115134	115150	115051	115052	my lady	477	" Did you ever hear that she was eccentric what people call ' odd ? ' "
115151	115156	115158	115158	Alicia	163	" Oh , no , "
115162	115207	115158	115158	Alicia	163	" My aunt was a very reasonable woman , I believe , though she did marry for love . But you must remember that she died before I was born , and I have not , therefore , felt very much curiosity about her . "
115208	115218	115051	115052	my lady	477	" But you recollect your uncle , I suppose . "
115219	115224	115226	115226	Alicia	163	" My Uncle Robert ? "
115228	115241	115226	115226	Alicia	163	" Oh , yes , I remember him very well , indeed . "
115242	115260	115051	115052	my lady	477	" Was he eccentric I mean to say , peculiar in his habits , like your cousin ? "
115261	115313	115226	115226	Alicia	163	" Yes , I believe Robert inherits all his absurdities from his father . My uncle expressed the same indifference for his fellow - creatures as my cousin , but as he was a good husband , an affectionate father , and a kind master , nobody ever challenged his opinions . "
115314	115320	115051	115052	my lady	477	" But he was eccentric ? "
115321	115334	115226	115226	Alicia	163	" Yes ; I suppose he was generally thought a little eccentric . "
115335	115338	115340	115341	my lady	477	" Ah , "
115345	115417	115340	115341	my lady	477	" I thought as much . Do you know , Alicia , that madness is more often transmitted from father to daughter , and from mother to daughter than from mother to son ? Your cousin , Robert Audley , is a very handsome young man , and I believe , a very good - hearted young man , but he must be watched , Alicia , for he is mad ! "
115418	115421	115423	115424	Miss Audley	163	" Mad ! "
115428	115445	115447	115449	the young lady	1080	" you are dreaming , my lady , or or you are trying to frighten me , "
115455	115468	115470	115471	my lady	477	" I only wish to put you on your guard , Alicia , "
115473	115525	115470	115471	my lady	477	" Mr. Audley may be as you say , merely eccentric ; but he has talked to me this evening in a manner that has filled me with absolute terror , and I believe that he is going mad . I shall speak very seriously to Sir Michael this very night . "
115526	115531	115533	115533	Alicia	163	" Speak to papa , "
115535	115548	115533	115533	Alicia	163	" you surely wo n't distress papa by suggesting such a possibility ! "
115549	115563	115470	115471	my lady	477	" I shall only put him on his guard , my dear Alicia . "
115564	115572	115574	115575	Miss Audley	163	" But he 'll never believe you , "
115577	115586	115574	115575	Miss Audley	163	" he will laugh at such an idea . "
115587	115601	115603	115604	my lady	477	" No , Alicia ; he will believe anything that I tell him , "
115861	115867	115868	115868	he	474	" Why , my darling ! "
115886	115913	115868	115868	he	474	" I have been thinking of you and waiting for you for an hour . Where have you been , and what have you been doing ? "
115936	115943	115944	115944	she	477	" I have been to Chelmsford , "
115951	115951	115944	115944	she	477	"
115970	115977	115979	115980	the baronet	474	" And what , my dear ? "
115981	116013	115952	115952	She	477	" what have you been doing since you came from Chelmsford ? I heard a carriage stop at the door an hour ago . It was yours , was it not ? "
116014	116024	116026	116027	my lady	477	" Yes , I came home an hour ago , "
116036	116048	116026	116027	my lady	477	" And what have you been doing since you came home ? "
116113	116127	116128	116128	he	160	" What have you been doing since you came home , my dear ? "
116131	116142	116128	116128	he	160	" What has kept you so long away from me ? "
116143	116153	116154	116154	She	1098	" I have been talking to Mr. Robert Audley . "
116177	116180	116182	116183	the baronet	474	" Robert ! "
116185	116190	116182	116183	the baronet	474	" is Robert here ? "
116191	116200	116154	116154	She	1098	" He was here a little while ago . "
116201	116210	116182	116183	the baronet	474	" And is here still , I suppose ? "
116211	116219	116154	116154	She	1098	" No , he has gone away . "
116220	116224	116226	116227	Sir Michael	160	" Gone away ! "
116229	116238	116226	116227	Sir Michael	160	" What do you mean , my darling ? "
116239	116301	116154	116154	She	1098	" I mean that your nephew came to the Court this afternoon . Alicia and I found him idling about the gardens . He stayed here till about a quarter of an hour ago talking to me , and then he hurried off without a word of explanation ; except , indeed , some ridiculous excuse about business at Mount Stanning . "
116302	116340	116226	116227	Sir Michael	160	" Business at Mount Stanning ! Why , what business can he possibly have in that out - of - the - way place ? He has gone to sleep at Mount Stanning , then , I suppose ?
116341	116353	116154	116154	She	1098	" Yes ; I think he said something to that effect . "
116354	116359	116361	116362	the baronet	474	" Upon my word , "
116364	116373	116361	116362	the baronet	474	" I think that boy is half mad . "
116423	116460	116412	116413	Lucy Audley	211	" It is coming it is coming ; I can twist him which way I like . I can put black before him , and if I say it is white , he will believe me . "
116981	116994	116996	116996	she	211	" I wanted to come to you , you know , dear , "
116997	117021	116975	116975	she	211	" I wanted to come to you directly I got home , but Mr. Audley insisted upon my stopping to talk to him . "
117022	117030	117032	117033	the baronet	474	" But what about , my love ? "
117035	117045	117032	117033	the baronet	474	" What could Robert have to say to you ? "
117114	117119	117121	117122	the baronet	474	" Lucy , Lucy ! "
117124	117148	117121	117122	the baronet	474	" what is the meaning of this ? My love , my love ! what has happened to distress you in this manner ? "
117628	117637	117617	117618	the father	2308	" My darlings , you are henceforth motherless . "
117667	117670	117671	117671	he	160	" Lucy , "
117674	117719	117671	117671	he	160	" Lucy , I insist upon your telling me what and who has distressed you . I insist upon it . Whoever has annoyed you shall answer to me for your grief . Come , my love , tell me directly what it is . "
117747	117757	117758	117758	he	160	" Tell me what it is , my dear , "
117820	117826	117827	117827	she	477	" I am very silly , "
117830	117840	117827	117827	she	477	" but really he has made me quite hysterical . "
117841	117849	117930	117931	Lady Audley	211	" Who who has made you hysterical ? "
117850	117857	117827	117827	she	477	" Your nephew Mr. Robert Audley . "
117858	117861	117863	117864	the baronet	474	" Robert , "
117866	117874	117863	117864	the baronet	474	" Lucy , what do you mean ? "
117875	117894	117896	117897	my lady	477	" I told you that Mr. Audley insisted upon my going into the lime - walk , dear , "
117899	117921	117896	117897	my lady	477	" He wanted to talk to me , he said , and I went , and he said such horrible things that "
117922	117929	117863	117864	the baronet	474	" What horrible things , Lucy ? "
117951	117959	117896	117897	my lady	477	" What did he say , Lucy ? "
117960	117973	117975	117976	my lady	477	" Oh , my dear love , how can I tell you ? "
117978	117995	117975	117976	my lady	477	" I know that I shall distress you or you will laugh at me , and then "
117996	118005	118006	118007	Lady Audley	211	" Laugh at you ? no , Lucy . "
118035	118039	118040	118040	she	211	" My dear , "
118062	118083	118040	118040	she	211	" have you ever I am so afraid of vexing you have you ever thought Mr. Audley a little a little "
118084	118092	118040	118040	she	211	" A little what , my darling ? "
118093	118101	118103	118104	Lady Audley	211	" A little out of his mind ? "
118106	118112	118114	118115	Sir Michael	160	" Out of his mind ! "
118117	118128	118114	118115	Sir Michael	160	" My dear girl , what are you thinking of ? "
118129	118145	118040	118040	she	211	" You said just now , dear , that you thought he was half mad . "
118146	118153	118155	118156	the baronet	474	" Did I , my love ? "
118160	118227	118155	118156	the baronet	474	" I do n't remember saying it , and it was a mere faÁon de parler , that meant nothing whatever . Robert may be a little eccentric a little stupid , perhaps he may n't be overburdened with wits , but I do n't think he has brains enough for madness . I believe it 's generally your great intellects that get out of order . "
118228	118235	118237	118238	my lady	477	" But madness is sometimes hereditary , "
118240	118246	118237	118238	my lady	477	" Mr. Audley may have inherited "
118247	118259	118261	118262	Sir Michael	160	" He has inherited no madness from his father 's family , "
118264	118278	118261	118262	Sir Michael	160	" The Audleys have never peopled private lunatic asylums or fed mad doctors . "
118279	118287	118155	118156	the baronet	474	" Nor from his mother 's family ? "
118288	118294	118261	118262	Sir Michael	160	" Not to my knowledge . "
118295	118304	118306	118307	my lady	477	" People generally keep these things a secret , "
118311	118327	118306	118307	my lady	477	" There may have been madness in your sister - in - law 's family . "
118328	118338	118340	118341	Sir Michael	160	" I do n't think so , my dear , "
118343	118365	118340	118341	Sir Michael	160	" But , Lucy , tell me what , in Heaven 's name , has put this idea into your head . "
118366	118414	118261	118262	Sir Michael	160	" I have been trying to account for your nephew 's conduct . I can account for it in no other manner . If you had heard the things he said to me to - night , Sir Michael , you too might have thought him mad . "
118415	118424	118340	118341	Sir Michael	160	" But what did he say , Lucy ? "
118425	118508	118261	118262	Sir Michael	160	" I can scarcely tell you . You can see how much he has stupefied and bewildered me . I believe he has lived too long alone in those solitary Temple chambers . Perhaps he reads too much , or smokes too much . You know that some physicians declare madness to be a mere illness of the brain an illness to which any one is subject , and which may be produced by given causes , and cured by given means . "
118571	118579	118581	118582	my lady	477	" Why should he not be mad ? "
118584	118717	118581	118582	my lady	477	" People are insane for years and years before their insanity is found out . They know that they are mad , but they know how to keep their secret ; and , perhaps , they may sometimes keep it till they die . Sometimes a paroxysm seizes them , and in an evil hour they betray themselves . They commit a crime , perhaps . The horrible temptation of opportunity assails them ; the knife is in their hand , and the unconscious victim by their side . They may conquer the restless demon and go away and die innocent of any violent deed ; but they may yield to the horrible temptation the frightful , passionate , hungry craving for violence and horror . They sometimes yield and are lost . "
118761	118767	118768	118768	she	211	" Robert Audley is mad , "
118773	119054	118768	118768	she	211	" What is one of the strangest diagnostics of madness what is the first appalling sign of mental aberration ? The mind becomes stationary ; the brain stagnates ; the even current of reflection is interrupted ; the thinking power of the brain resolves itself into a monotone . As the waters of a tideless pool putrefy by reason of their stagnation , the mind becomes turbid and corrupt through lack of action ; and the perpetual reflection upon one subject resolves itself into monomania . Robert Audley is a monomaniac . The disappearance of his friend , George Talboys , grieved and bewildered him . He dwelt upon this one idea until he lost the power of thinking of anything else . The one idea looked at perpetually became distorted to his mental vision . Repeat the commonest word in the English language twenty times , and before the twentieth repetition you will have begun to wonder whether the word which you repeat is really the word you mean to utter . Robert Audley has thought of his friend 's disappearance until the one idea has done its fatal and unhealthy work . He looks at a common event with a vision that is diseased , and he distorts it into a gloomy horror engendered of his own monomania . If you do not want to make me as mad as he is , you must never let me see him again . He declared to - night that George Talboys was murdered in this place , and that he will root up every tree in the garden , and pull down every brick in the house in search for "
119107	119113	119115	119116	the baronet	474	" Pull down this house ? "
119118	119133	119115	119116	the baronet	474	" George Talboys murdered at Audley Court ! Did Robert say this , Lucy ? "
119134	119148	119115	119116	the baronet	474	" He said something of that kind something that frightened me very much . "
119149	119156	119158	119159	Sir Michael	160	" Then he must be mad , "
119163	119187	119158	119159	Sir Michael	160	" I 'm bewildered by what you tell me . Did he really say this , Lucy , or did you misunderstand him ? "
119188	119197	119199	119200	my lady	477	" I I do n't think I did , "
119202	119231	119199	119200	my lady	477	" You saw how frightened I was when I first came in . I should not have been so much agitated if he had n't said something horrible . "
119250	119262	119264	119265	the baronet	474	" To be sure , my darling , to be sure , "
119267	119350	119264	119265	the baronet	474	" What could have put such a horrible fancy into the unhappy boy 's head . This Mr. Talboys a perfect stranger to all of us murdered at Audley Court ! I 'll go to Mount Stanning to - night , and see Robert . I have known him ever since he was a baby , and I can not be deceived in him . If there is really anything wrong , he will not be able to conceal it from me . "
119357	119365	119366	119366	she	477	" That is rather an open question , "
119369	119385	119366	119366	she	477	" It is generally a stranger who is the first to observe any psychological peculiarity . "
119419	119433	119434	119434	she	477	" But you must not go to Mount Stanning , my dear darling , "
119439	119469	119434	119434	she	477	" Remember that you are under strict orders to stay in doors until the weather is milder , and the sun shines upon this cruel ice - bound country . "
119485	119492	119493	119493	he	160	" That 's true , Lucy , "
119496	119515	119493	119493	he	160	" we must obey Mr. Dawson . I suppose Robert will come to see me to - morrow . "
119516	119528	119585	119586	Sir Michael	160	" Yes , dear . I think he said he would . "
119529	119564	119493	119493	he	160	" Then we must wait till to - morrow , my darling . I ca n't believe that there really is anything wrong with the poor boy I ca n't believe it , Lucy . "
119565	119580	119582	119583	my lady	477	" Then how do you account for this extraordinary delusion about this Mr. Talboys ? "
119591	119603	119604	119604	he	160	" I do n't know , Lucy I do n't know , "
119607	119733	119604	119604	he	160	" It is always so difficult to believe that any one of the calamities that continually befall our fellow - men will ever happen to us . I ca n't believe that my nephew 's mind is impaired I ca n't believe it . I I 'll get him to stop here , Lucy , and I 'll watch him closely . I tell you , my love , if there is anything wrong I am sure to find it out . I ca n't be mistaken in a young man who has always been the same to me as my own son . But , my darling , why were you so frightened by Robert 's wild talk ? It could not affect you . "
119739	119752	119753	119753	she	477	" You must think me very strong - minded , Sir Michael , "
119762	119789	119753	119753	she	477	" if you imagine I can hear of these sort of things indifferently . I know I shall never be able to see Mr. Audley again . "
119790	119802	119734	119735	My lady	477	" And you shall not , my dear you shall not . "
119803	119814	119816	119817	Lady Audley	211	" You said just now you would have him here , "
119819	119894	119734	119735	My lady	477	" But I will not , my darling girl , if his presence annoys you . Good Heaven ! Lucy , can you imagine for a moment that I have any higher wish than to promote your happiness ? I will consult some London physician about Robert , and let him discover if there is really anything the matter with my poor brother 's only son . You shall not be annoyed , Lucy . "
119895	119905	119907	119908	my lady	477	" You must think me very unkind , dear , "
119910	119941	119907	119908	my lady	477	" and I know I ought not to be annoyed by the poor fellow ; but he really seems to have taken some absurd notion into his head about me . "
119942	119948	119950	119951	Sir Michael	160	" About you , Lucy ! "
119953	119981	119734	119735	My lady	477	" Yes , dear . He seems to connect me in some vague manner which I can not quite understand with the disappearance of this Mr. Talboys . "
119982	119993	119734	119735	My lady	477	" Impossible , Lucy ! You must have misunderstood him . "
119994	120001	119734	119735	My lady	477	" I do n't think so . "
120002	120009	120011	120012	the baronet	474	" Then he must be mad , "
120013	120052	120011	120012	the baronet	474	" he must be mad . I will wait till he goes back to town , and then send some one to his chambers to talk to him . Good Heaven ! what a mysterious business this is . "
120053	120063	120065	120066	Lady Audley	211	" I fear I have distressed you , darling , "
120068	120120	120065	120066	Lady Audley	211	" Yes , my dear , I am very much distressed by what you have told me ; but you were quite right to talk to me frankly about this dreadful business . I must think it over , dearest , and try and decide what is best to be done . "
120173	120185	120186	120186	she	211	" How good you have always been to me , dear , "
120190	120207	120186	120186	she	211	" You would never let any one influence you against me , would you , dear ? "
120208	120214	120216	120217	the baronet	474	" Influence me against you ? "
120219	120225	120216	120217	the baronet	474	" No , my love . "
120226	120233	120235	120236	my lady	477	" Because you know , dear , "
120238	120268	120235	120236	my lady	477	" there are wicked people as well as mad people in the world , and there may be some persons to whose interest it would be to injure me . "
120269	120282	120284	120285	Sir Michael	160	" They had better not try it , then , my dear , "
120287	120301	120284	120285	Sir Michael	160	" they would find themselves in rather a dangerous position if they did . "
120324	120330	120331	120331	she	211	" My own dear darling , "
120334	120420	120331	120331	she	211	" I know you love me . And now I must run away , dear , for it 's past seven o'clock . I was engaged to dine at Mrs. Montford 's , but I must send a groom with a message of apology , for Mr. Audley has made me quite unfit for company . I shall stay at home and nurse you , dear . You 'll go to bed very early , wo n't you , and take great care of yourself ? "
120421	120426	120463	120463	she	477	" Yes , dear . "
120487	120499	120500	120500	she	477	" I have been afraid of you , Mr. Robert Audley , "
120503	120522	120500	120500	she	477	" but perhaps the time may come in which you will have cause to be afraid of me . "
121258	121275	121277	121278	Miss Audley	163	" If Bob was good for anything I could have told him how unhappy I am , "
121280	121301	121277	121278	Miss Audley	163	" but I may just as well tell Caesar my troubles for any consolation I should get from Cousin Robert . "
121487	121495	121496	121496	she	211	" I shall leave you , dear , "
121499	121546	121496	121496	she	211	" If you can sleep , so much the better . If you wish to read , the books and papers are close to you . I will leave the doors between the rooms open , and I shall hear your voice if you call me . "

122776	122794	122759	122768	the three demons of Vanity , Selfishness , and Ambition	3697	" This woman is our slave , let us see what she will become under our guidance . "
122951	122961	122962	122962	she	477	" I was not wicked when I was young , "
122973	122999	123000	123000	she	477	" I was only thoughtless . I never did any harm at least , wilfully . Have I ever been really wicked , I wonder ? "
123003	123073	123000	123000	she	477	" My worst wickednesses have been the result of wild impulses , and not of deeply - laid plots . I am not like the women I have read of , who have lain night after night in the horrible darkness and stillness , planning out treacherous deeds , and arranging every circumstance of an appointed crime . I wonder whether they suffered those women whether they ever suffered as "
123113	123122	123123	123123	she	477	" You are mad , Mr. Robert Audley , "
123126	123161	123123	123123	she	477	" you are mad , and your fancies are a madman 's fancies . I know what madness is . I know its signs and tokens , and I say that you are mad . "
123192	123198	123199	123199	she	477	" Dare I defy him ? "
123202	123259	123199	123199	she	477	" Dare I ? dare I ? Will he stop , now that he has once gone so far ? Will he stop for fear of me ? Will he stop for fear of me , when the thought of what his uncle must suffer has not stopped him ? Will anything stop him but death ? "
123298	123301	123302	123302	she	477	" death , "
123310	123318	123319	123319	she	477	" I ca n't plot horrible things , "
123324	123355	123319	123319	she	477	" my brain is n't strong enough , or I 'm not wicked enough , or brave enough . If I met Robert Audley in those lonely gardens , as I "
123500	123504	123510	123510	her	211	" Come in , "
123594	123607	123608	123608	she	177	" I beg pardon , my lady , for intruding without leave , "
123611	123627	123608	123608	she	177	" but I thought I might venture to come straight up without waiting for permission . "
123628	123658	123659	123660	Lady Audley	211	" Yes , yes , Phoebe , to be sure . Take off your bonnet , you wretched , cold - looking creature , and come sit down here . "
123710	123717	123718	123719	Lady Audley	211	" Sit down here , Phoebe , "
123751	123751	123742	123742	I	0	"
124037	124049	124050	124050	she	177	" Sir Michael is better , I hope , my lady , "
124053	124071	124073	124074	Lady Audley	211	" Yes , Phoebe , much better . He is asleep . You may close that door , "
124109	124119	124120	124121	my lady	477	" I am very , very unhappy , Phoebe , "
124126	124130	124120	124121	my lady	477	" wretchedly miserable . "
124131	124136	124138	124139	Mrs. Marks	238	" About the secret ? "
124206	124217	124218	124218	she	477	" I am cruelly persecuted and harassed , Phoebe Marks , "
124221	124255	124218	124218	she	477	" I am pursued and tormented by a man whom I never injured , whom I have never wished to injure . I am never suffered to rest by this relentless tormentor , and "
124339	124351	124353	124356	the innkeeper 's wife	3741	" I think I know whom you mean , my lady , "
124362	124377	124353	124356	the innkeeper 's wife	3741	" I think I know who it is who is so cruel to you . "
124378	124384	124386	124387	my lady	477	" Oh , of course , "
124391	124408	124386	124387	my lady	477	" my secrets are everybody 's secrets . You know all about it , no doubt . "
124409	124422	124353	124356	the innkeeper 's wife	3741	" The person is a gentleman is he not , my lady ? "
124423	124426	124386	124387	my lady	477	" Yes . "
124427	124444	124353	124356	the innkeeper 's wife	3741	" A gentleman who came to the Castle Inn two months ago , when I warned you "
124445	124450	124452	124453	my lady	477	" Yes , yes , "
124457	124476	124353	124356	the innkeeper 's wife	3741	" I thought so . The same gentleman is at our place to - night , my lady . "
124558	124564	124565	124565	she	211	" At the Castle Inn ? "
124568	124590	124591	124591	she	211	" I might have known as much . He has gone there to wring my secrets from your husband . Fool ! "
124605	124621	124591	124591	she	211	" do you want to destroy me that you have left those two men together ? "
124629	124644	124645	124645	she	211	" I did n't come away of my own free will , my lady , "
124648	124671	124645	124645	she	211	" no one could have been more unwilling to leave the house than I was this night . I was sent here . "
124672	124678	124591	124591	she	211	" Who sent you here ? "
124679	124702	124645	124645	she	211	" Luke , my lady . You ca n't tell how hard he can be upon me if I go against him . "
124703	124710	124591	124591	she	211	" Why did he send you ? "
124734	124740	124741	124741	she	3741	" Indeed , my lady , "
124744	124805	124741	124741	she	3741	" I did n't want to come . I told Luke that it was too bad for us to worry you , first asking this favor , and then asking that , and never leaving you alone for a month together ; but but he bore me down with his loud , blustering talk , and he made me come . "
124806	124811	124813	124814	Lady Audley	211	" Yes , yes , "
124818	124832	124813	124814	Lady Audley	211	" I know that . I want to know why you have come . "
124833	124842	124844	124844	Phoebe	177	" Why , you know , my lady , "
124849	124963	124844	124844	Phoebe	177	" Luke is very extravagant ; and all I can say to him , I ca n't get him to be careful or steady . He 's not sober ; and when he 's drinking with a lot of rough countrymen , and drinking , perhaps even more than they do , it is n't likely that his head can be very clear for accounts . If it had n't been for me we should have been ruined before this ; and hard as I 've tried , I have n't been able to keep the ruin off . You remember giving me the money for the brewer 's bill , my lady ? "
124964	124972	124974	124975	Lady Audley	211	" Yes , I remember very well , "
124982	124994	124974	124975	Lady Audley	211	" for I wanted that money to pay my own bills . "
124995	125102	124844	124844	Phoebe	177	" I know you did , my lady , and it was very , very hard for me to have to come and ask you for it , after all that we 'd received from you before . But that is n't the worst : when Luke sent me down here to beg the favor of that help he never told me that the Christmas rent was still owing ; but it was , my lady , and it 's owing now , and and there 's a bailiff in the house to - night , and we 're to be sold up to - morrow unless "
125103	125113	125115	125116	Lucy Audley	211	" Unless I pay your rent , I suppose , "
125118	125127	125115	125116	Lucy Audley	211	" I might have guessed what was coming . "
125128	125143	125145	125146	Phoebe Marks	177	" Indeed , indeed , my lady , I would n't have asked it , "
125148	125155	125145	125146	Phoebe Marks	177	" but he made me come . "
125156	125159	125161	125162	my lady	477	" Yes , "
125166	125367	125161	125162	my lady	477	" he made you come ; and he will make you come whenever he pleases , and whenever he wants money for the gratification of his low vices ; and you and he are my pensioners as long as I live , or as long as I have any money to give ; for I suppose when my purse is empty and my credit ruined , you and your husband will turn upon me and sell me to the highest bidder . Do you know , Phoebe Marks , that my jewel - case has been half emptied to meet your claims ? Do you know that my pin - money , which I thought such a princely allowance when my marriage settlement was made , and when I was a poor governess at Mr. Dawson 's , Heaven help me ! my pin - money has been overdrawn half a year to satisfy your demands ? What can I do to appease you ? Shall I sell my Marie Antoinette cabinet , or my pompadour china , Leroy 's and Benson 's ormolu clocks , or my Gobelin tapestried chairs and ottomans ? How shall I satisfy you next ? "
125368	125377	125379	125379	Phoebe	177	" Oh , my lady , my lady , "
125383	125409	125379	125379	Phoebe	177	" do n't be so cruel to me ; you know , you know that it is n't I who want to impose upon you . "
125410	125415	125417	125418	Lady Audley	211	" I know nothing , "
125420	125435	125436	125436	she	211	" except that I am the most miserable of women . Let me think , "
125449	125468	125436	125436	she	211	" Hold your tongue , girl , and let me think of this business , if I can . "
125501	125509	125510	125510	she	211	" Robert Audley is with your husband , "
125524	125592	125510	125510	she	211	" These two men are together , and there are bailiffs in the house , and your brutal husband is no doubt brutally drunk by this time , and brutally obstinate and ferocious in his drunkenness . If I refuse to pay this money his ferocity will be multiplied by a hundredfold . There 's little use in discussing that matter . The money must be paid . "
125593	125601	125603	125603	Phoebe	177	" But if you do pay it , "
125607	125633	125603	125603	Phoebe	177	" I hope you will impress upon Luke that it is the last money you will ever give him while he stops in that house . "
125634	125637	125639	125640	Lady Audley	211	" Why ? "
125657	125667	125603	125603	Phoebe	177	" Because I want Luke to leave the Castle . "
125668	125678	125603	125603	Phoebe	177	" But why do you want him to leave ? "
125679	125691	125693	125693	Phoebe	177	" Oh , for ever so many reasons , my lady , "
125695	125818	125693	125693	Phoebe	177	" He 's not fit to be the landlord of a public - house . I did n't know that when I married him , or I would have gone against the business , and tried to persuade him to take to the farming line . Not that I suppose he 'd have given up his own fancy , either ; for he 's obstinate enough , as you know , my lady . He 's not fit for his present business . He 's scarcely ever sober after dark ; and when he 's drunk he gets almost wild , and does n't seem to know what he does . We 've had two or three narrow escapes with him already . "
125819	125823	125825	125826	Lady Audley	211	" Narrow escapes ! "
125828	125834	125825	125826	Lady Audley	211	" What do you mean ? "
125835	125853	125693	125693	Phoebe	177	" Why , we 've run the risk of being burnt in our beds through his carelessness . "
125854	125869	125877	125877	She	477	" Burnt in your beds through his carelessness ! Why , how was that ? "
125908	126137	125877	125877	She	477	" You know what a queer old place the Castle is , my lady ; all tumble - down wood - work , and rotten rafters , and such like . The Chelmsford Insurance Company wo n't insure it ; for they say if the place did happen to catch fire of a windy night it would blaze away like so much tinder , and nothing in the world could save it . Well , Luke knows this ; and the landlord has warned him of it times and often , for he lives close against us , and he keeps a pretty sharp eye upon all my husband 's goings on ; but when Luke 's tipsy he does n't know what he 's about , and only a week ago he left a candle burning in one of the out - houses , and the flame caught one of the rafters of the sloping roof , and if it had n't been for me finding it out when I went round the house the last thing , we should have all been burnt to death , perhaps . And that 's the third time the same kind of thing has happened in the six months we 've had the place , and you ca n't wonder that I 'm frightened , can you , my lady ? "
126258	126264	126266	126268	the young lady	1080	" Burnt in your beds , "
126273	126302	126266	126268	the young lady	1080	" It would have been a good thing for me if that precious creature , your husband , had been burnt in his bed before to - night . "
126415	126428	126429	126430	my lady	477	" I 'll give you the money to send this bailiff away , "
126437	126468	126429	126430	my lady	477	" I must give you the last sovereign in my purse , but what of that ? you know as well as I do that I dare not refuse you . "
126483	126493	126494	126494	she	211	" The money is in my dressing - room , "
126497	126505	126494	126494	she	211	" I will go and fetch it . "
126506	126512	126514	126514	Phoebe	177	" Oh , my lady , "
126518	126538	126514	126514	Phoebe	177	" I forgot something ; I was in such a way about this business that I quite forgot it . "
126539	126544	126494	126494	she	211	" Quite forgot what ? "
126545	126566	126514	126514	Phoebe	177	" A letter that was given me to bring to you , my lady , just before I left home . "
126567	126571	126494	126494	she	211	" What letter ? "
126572	126600	126514	126514	Phoebe	177	" A letter from Mr. Audley . He heard my husband mention that I was coming down here , and he asked me to carry this letter . "
126641	126649	126650	126650	she	211	" Give it me give it me , "
126653	126664	126650	126650	she	211	" let me see what more he has to say . "
126718	126817	126676	126676	her	211	" Should Mrs. George Talboys really have survived the date of her supposed death , as recorded in the public prints , and upon the tombstone in Ventnor churchyard , and should she exist in the person of the lady suspected and accused by the writer of this , there can be no great difficulty in finding some one able and willing to identify her . Mrs. Barkamb , the owner of North Cottages , Wildernsea , would no doubt consent to throw some light upon this matter ; either to dispel a delusion or to confirm a suspicion .
126818	126821	126881	126881	she	477	" ROBERT AUDLEY .
126822	126827	126676	126676	her	211	" March 3 , 1859 .
126828	126836	126881	126881	she	477	" The Castle Inn , Mount Stanning . "
126866	126880	126881	126881	she	477	" If he stood before me now , and I could kill him , "
126890	126900	126881	126881	she	477	" I would do it I would do it ! "
127133	127146	127147	127147	she	211	" If they make him believe , how wretched he will be , "
127411	127417	127418	127418	she	211	" He will do it , "
127425	127444	127418	127418	she	211	" he will do it , unless I get him into a lunatic - asylum first ; or unless "
127486	127505	127445	127445	She	211	" He will do it , unless some strange calamity befalls him , and silences him for ever . "
128038	128042	128043	128043	she	477	" My lady , "
128046	128056	128043	128043	she	477	" you are not going out to - night ? "
128057	128065	128066	128067	Lady Audley	211	" Yes , I am , Phoebe , "
128073	128095	128066	128067	Lady Audley	211	" I am going to Mount Stanning with you to see this bailiff , and to pay and dismiss him myself . "
128096	128119	128043	128043	she	477	" But , my lady , you forget what the time is ; you ca n't go out at such an hour . "
128143	128159	128160	128160	she	211	" The stables are always locked , and the men in bed by ten o'clock , "
128163	128199	128160	128160	she	211	" when we are at home . It will make a terrible hubbub to get a carriage ready ; but yet I dare say one of the servants could manage the matter quietly for me . "
128200	128213	128215	128216	Phoebe Marks	177	" But why should you go to - night , my lady ? "
128218	128253	128215	128216	Phoebe Marks	177	" To - morrow will do quite as well . A week hence will do as well . Our landlord would take the man away if he had your promise to settle the debt . "
128304	128314	128315	128315	she	211	" Now , Phoebe Marks , listen to me , "
128346	128353	128354	128354	she	211	" Listen to me , Phoebe , "
128357	128483	128354	128354	she	211	" I am going to the Castle Inn to - night ; whether it is early or late is of very little consequence to me ; I have set my mind upon going , and I shall go . You have asked me why , and I have told you . I am going in order that I may pay this debt myself ; and that I may see for myself that the money I give is applied to the purpose for which I give it . There is nothing out of the common course of life in my doing this . I am going to do what other women in my position very often do . I am going to assist a favorite servant . "
128484	128497	128499	128499	Phoebe	177	" But it 's getting on for twelve o'clock , my lady , "
128509	128524	128525	128525	she	211	" If my going to your house to pay this man should be known , "
128537	128584	128525	128525	she	211	" I am ready to answer for my conduct ; but I would rather that the business should be kept quiet . I think that I can leave this house without being seen by any living creature , if you will do as I tell you . "
128585	128596	128598	128598	Phoebe	177	" I will do anything you wish , my lady , "
128602	128701	128530	128530	her	211	" Then you will wish me good - night presently , when my maid comes into the room , and you will suffer her to show you out of the house . You will cross the courtyard and wait for me in the avenue upon the other side of the archway . It may be half an hour before I am able to join you , for I must not leave my room till the servants have all gone to bed , but you may wait for me patiently , for come what may I will join you . "
128825	128838	128840	128841	my lady	477	" I did not know that it was so late , Martin , "
128859	128894	128840	128841	my lady	477	" I have been talking with Mrs. Marks and have let the time slip by me . I sha'n't want anything to - night , so you may go to bed when you please . "
128895	128902	128904	128905	the girl	722	" Thank you , my lady , "
128937	128953	128955	128956	the maid	1199	" I 'd better show Mrs. Marks out , my lady , had n't I ? "
128958	128965	128955	128956	the maid	1199	" before I go to bed ? "
128966	128995	129007	129007	she	211	" Oh , yes , to be sure ; you can let Phoebe out . All the other servants have gone to bed , then , I suppose ? "
128996	129002	128955	128956	the maid	1199	" Yes , my lady . "
129013	129024	129025	129025	she	211	" We have been terrible dissipated up here , Phoebe , "
129028	129045	129007	129007	she	211	" Good - night . You may tell your husband that his rent shall be paid . "
129046	129060	129062	129062	Phoebe	177	" Thank you very much , my lady , and good - night , "
129105	129115	129116	129116	she	211	" Martin sleeps at the top of the house , "
129119	129138	129116	129116	she	211	" half a mile away from this room . In ten minutes I may safely make my escape . "
129336	129343	129344	129344	she	211	" I will wait ten minutes , "
129347	129361	129344	129344	she	211	" not a moment beyond , before I enter on my new peril . "
129902	129914	129915	129915	she	477	" How glad she will be if any disgrace befalls me , "
129918	129932	129915	129915	she	477	" how she will rejoice if I am driven out of this house ! "
130010	130014	130015	130016	my lady	477	" No matter , "
130019	130052	130015	130016	my lady	477	" I could not have left it burning . I shall know how to find my way through the house when I come back . I have left all the doors ajar . "
130184	130194	130195	130195	she	211	" I feel as if I were running away , "
130198	130364	130195	130195	she	211	" I feel as if I were running away secretly in the dead of the night , to lose myself and be forgotten . Perhaps it would be wiser in me to run away , to take this man 's warning , and escape out of his power forever . If I were to run away and disappear as as George Talboys disappeared . But where could I go ? what would become of me ? I have no money ; my jewels are not worth a couple of hundred pounds , now that I have got rid of the best part of them . What could I do ? I must go back to the old life , the old , hard , cruel , wretched life the life of poverty , and humiliation , and vexation , and discontent . I should have to go back and wear myself out in that long struggle , and die as my mother died , perhaps ! "
130444	130451	130452	130452	she	477	" No ! Mr. Robert Audley , "
130464	130499	130452	130452	she	477	" I will not go back I will not go back . If the struggle between us is to be a duel to the death , you shall not find me drop my weapon . "
130584	130589	130590	130590	she	211	" Now , Phoebe , "
130593	130608	130590	130590	she	211	" it is three miles from here to Mount Stanning , is n't it ? "
130609	130615	130631	130632	Lady Audley	211	" Yes , my lady . "
130616	130630	130590	130590	she	211	" Then we can walk the distance in an hour and a half . "
130706	130721	130722	130722	she	211	" Your beautiful husband will sit up for you , I suppose , Phoebe ? "
130748	130775	130722	130722	she	211	" Oh , yes , my lady ; he 's sure to sit up . He 'll be drinking with the man , I dare say . "
130776	130783	130722	130722	she	211	" The man ! What man ? "
130784	130795	130722	130722	she	211	" The man that 's in possession , my lady . "
130796	130803	130805	130806	Lady Audley	211	" Ah , to be sure , "
130979	130989	130991	130992	my lady	477	" He has not gone to bed , Phoebe , "
130996	131018	130991	130992	my lady	477	" But there is no other light burning at the inn . I suppose Mr. Audley is in bed and asleep . "
131019	131029	130991	130992	my lady	477	" Yes , my lady , I suppose so . "
131030	131045	130991	130992	my lady	477	" You are sure he was going to stay at the Castle to night ? "
131046	131068	130991	130992	my lady	477	" Oh , yes , my lady . I helped the girl to get his room ready before I came away . "
131324	131336	131338	131338	Phoebe	177	" I 'll tell him you 're here , my lady , "
131344	131381	131338	131338	Phoebe	177	" I know he 'll be tipsy . You you wo n't be offended , my lady , if he should say anything rude ? You know it was n't my wish that you should come . "
131382	131387	131389	131390	Lady Audley	211	" Yes , yes , "
131394	131414	131389	131390	Lady Audley	211	" I know that . What should I care for his rudeness ! Let him say what he likes . "
131523	131536	131537	131537	he	178	" So you 've condescended to come home at last , ma'am , "
131540	131550	131537	131537	he	178	" I thought you was never coming no more . "
131650	131664	131665	131665	Phoebe	177	" I I 've been longer than I intended to be , Luke , "
131674	131699	131669	131669	her	177	" but I 've seen my lady , and she 's been very kind , and and she 'll settle this business for us . "
131700	131710	131712	131713	Mr. Marks	178	" She 's been very kind , has she ? "
131720	131751	131712	131713	Mr. Marks	178	" thank her for nothing . I know the vally of her kindness . She 'd be oncommon kind , I dessay , if she warn't obligated to be it . "
131842	131856	131857	131857	Phoebe	177	" My lady has promised to settle the business for us , Luke , "
131908	131915	131916	131916	she	177	" My lady will settle it , "
131919	131934	131935	131935	she	177	" and she 's come down here to see about it to - night , "
131957	131967	131968	131968	he	478	" My Lady Audley come here to - night ! "
131971	131976	131977	131977	My	0	" Yes , Luke . "
131990	131996	131997	131997	she	477	" Yes , Luke Marks , "
132000	132017	131997	131997	she	477	" I have come to pay this man , and to send him about his business . "
132075	132085	132086	132086	he	178	" You might have given the money to Phoebe , "
132089	132119	132086	132086	he	178	" as well as have brought it yourself . We do n't want no fine ladies up here , pryin ' and pokin ' their precious noses into everythink . "
132120	132125	132127	132127	Phoebe	177	" Luke , Luke ! "
132129	132138	132127	132127	Phoebe	177	" when my lady has been so kind ! "
132139	132146	132148	132149	Mr. Marks	178	" Oh , damn her kindness ! "
132151	132202	132148	132149	Mr. Marks	178	" it ai n't her kindness as we want , gal , it 's her money . She wo n't get no snivelin ' gratitood from me . Whatever she does for us she does because she is obliged ; and if she was n't obliged she would n't do it "
132296	132299	132300	132300	she	477	" Stop , "
132303	132327	132300	132300	she	477	" I did n't come up here in the dead of night to listen to your insolence . How much is this debt ? "
132328	132332	132347	132347	she	211	" Nine pound . "
132364	132376	132377	132377	she	211	" Let that man give me a receipt for the money , "
132380	132385	132377	132377	she	211	" before I go . "
132478	132489	132490	132490	she	211	" You must n't go home alone , my lady , "
132493	132502	132490	132490	she	211	" You 'll let me go with you ? "
132503	132515	132490	132490	she	211	" Yes , yes ; you shall go home with me . "
132632	132643	132644	132644	she	211	" I think I am going to faint , Phoebe , "
132647	132656	132644	132644	she	211	" where can I get some cold water ? "
132657	132682	132621	132621	She	211	" The pump is in the wash - house , my lady ; I 'll run and get you a glass of cold water . "
132683	132690	132692	132693	my lady	477	" No , no , no , "
132710	132744	132700	132700	she	211	" I 'll get it myself . I must dip my head in a basin of water if I want to save myself from fainting . In which room does Mr. Audley sleep ? "
132766	132787	132788	132788	she	177	" It was number three that I got ready , my lady the front room the room next to ours , "
132797	132803	132805	132806	my lady	477	" Give me a candle , "
132808	132844	132805	132806	my lady	477	" I 'll go into your room , and get some water for my head ; stay where you are , and see that that brute of a husband of yours does not follow me ! "
133559	133566	133567	133567	she	177	" The light , my lady , "
133570	133579	133567	133567	she	177	" you have left it up - stairs ! "
133580	133593	133594	133595	Lady Audley	211	" The wind blew it out as I was leaving your room , "
133600	133606	133594	133595	Lady Audley	211	" I left it there . "
133607	133615	133567	133567	she	177	" In my room , my lady ? "
133616	133619	133594	133595	Lady Audley	211	" Yes . "
133620	133627	133567	133567	she	177	" And it was quite out ? "
133628	133652	133653	133653	She	177	" Yes , I tell you ; why do you worry me about your candle ? It is past two o'clock . Come . "
134085	134092	134094	134094	Phoebe	177	" My lady , my lady ! "
134102	134107	134094	134094	Phoebe	177	" do you see ? "
134108	134116	134118	134119	Lady Audley	211	" Yes , child , I see , "
134131	134137	134118	134119	Lady Audley	211	" What 's the matter ? "
134138	134149	134094	134094	Phoebe	177	" It 's a fire a fire , my lady ! "
134150	134179	134118	134119	Lady Audley	211	" Yes , I am afraid it is a fire . At Brentwood , most likely . Let me go , Phoebe ; it 's nothing to us . "
134180	134202	134094	134094	Phoebe	177	" Yes , yes , my lady ; it 's nearer than Brentwood much nearer ; it 's at Mount Stanning . "
134242	134252	134254	134255	Phoebe Marks	177	" It 's at Mount Stanning , my lady ! "
134257	134325	134327	134328	the girl	722	" It 's the Castle that 's on fire I know it is , I know it is ! I thought of fire to - night , and I was fidgety and uneasy , for I knew this would happen some day . I would n't mind if it was only the wretched place , but there 'll be life lost , there 'll be life lost ! "
134332	134353	134327	134328	the girl	722	" There 's Luke , too tipsy to help himself , unless others help him ; there 's Mr. Audley asleep "
134384	134390	134391	134391	she	177	" Oh , my God ! "
134394	134425	134391	134391	she	177	" Say it 's not true , my lady , say it 's not true ! It 's too horrible , it 's too horrible , it 's too horrible ! "
134426	134432	134479	134481	the kneeling woman	3973	" What 's too horrible ? "
134433	134451	134391	134391	she	177	" The thought that 's in my mind ; the terrible thought that 's in my mind . "
134452	134460	134462	134463	my lady	477	" What do you mean , girl ? "
134467	134478	134479	134481	the kneeling woman	3973	" Oh , God forgive me if I 'm wrong ! "
134487	134610	134479	134481	the kneeling woman	3973	" and God grant I may be . Why did you go up to the Castle , my lady ? Why were you so set on going against all I could say you who are so bitter against Mr. Audley and against Luke , and who knew they were both under that roof ? Oh , tell me that I do you a cruel wrong , my lady ; tell me so tell me ! for as there is a Heaven above me I think that you went to that place to - night on purpose to set fire to it . Tell me that I 'm wrong , my lady ; tell me that I 'm doing you a wicked wrong . "
134611	134626	134628	134629	Lady Audley	211	" I will tell you nothing , except that you are a mad woman , "
134638	134801	134628	134629	Lady Audley	211	" Get up ; fool , idiot , coward ! Is your husband such a precious bargain that you should be groveling there , lamenting and groaning for him ? What is Robert Audley to you , that you behave like a maniac , because you think he is in danger ? How do you know the fire is at Mount Stanning ? You see a red patch in the sky , and you cry out directly that your own paltry hovel is in flames , as if there were no place in the world that could burn except that . The fire may be at Brentwood , or further away at Romford , or still further away , on the eastern side of London , perhaps . Get up , mad woman , and go back and look after your goods and chattels , and your husband and your lodger . Get up and go : I do n't want you . "
134802	134814	134816	134816	Phoebe	177	" Oh ! my lady , my lady , forgive me , "
134818	134861	134816	134816	Phoebe	177	" there 's nothing you can say to me that 's hard enough for having done you such a wrong , even in my thoughts . I do n't mind your cruel words I do n't mind anything if I 'm wrong . "
134862	134870	134872	134873	Lady Audley	211	" Go back and see for yourself , "
134877	134889	134872	134873	Lady Audley	211	" I tell you again , I do n't want you . "
135170	135177	135178	135178	she	163	" No riding to - day , "
135181	135205	135178	135178	she	163	" and no chance of any callers to enliven us , unless that ridiculous Bob comes crawling through the wet from Mount Stanning . "
135377	135391	135392	135394	the young lady	1080	" Yes , he will come down here in the wet , perhaps , "
135397	135511	135392	135394	the young lady	1080	" with his hat sleek and shining as if it had been brushed with a pat of fresh butter , and with white vapors steaming out of his clothes , and making him look like an awkward genie just let out of his bottle . He will come down here and print impressions of his muddy boots all over the carpet , and he 'll sit on your Gobelin tapestry , my lady , in his wet overcoat ; and he 'll abuse you if you remonstrate , and will ask why people have chairs that are not to be sat upon , and why you do n't live in Figtree Court , and "
135585	135602	135603	135604	Sir Michael	160	" What do you think Major Melville told me when he called here yesterday , Alicia ? "
135609	135617	135619	135619	Alicia	163	" I have n't the remotest idea , "
135624	135768	135619	135619	Alicia	163	" Perhaps he told you that we should have another war before long , by Ged , sir ; or perhaps he told you that we should have a new ministry , by Ged , sir , for that those fellows are getting themselves into a mess , sir ; or that those other fellows were reforming this , and cutting down that , and altering the other in the army , until , by Ged , sir , we shall have no army at all , by - and - by nothing but a pack of boys , sir , crammed up to the eyes with a lot of senseless schoolmasters ' rubbish , and dressed in shell - jackets and calico helmets . Yes , sir , they 're fighting in Oudh in calico helmets at this very day , sir . "
135769	135778	135780	135781	the baronet	474	" You 're an impertinent minx , miss , "
135783	135835	135780	135781	the baronet	474	" Major Melville told me nothing of the kind ; but he told me that a very devoted admirer of you , a certain Sir Harry Towers , has forsaken his place in Hertfordshire , and his hunting stable , and has gone on the continent for a twelvemonths ' tour . "
135855	135866	135867	135867	she	163	" He has gone on the continent , has he ? "
135871	135922	135867	135867	she	163	" He told me that he meant to do so if if he did n't have everything his own way . Poor fellow ! he 's a dear , good - hearted , stupid creature , and twenty times better than that peripatetic , patent refrigerator , Mr. Robert Audley . "
135923	135938	135939	135940	Sir Michael	160	" I wish , Alicia , you were not so fond of ridiculing Bob , "
135945	136014	135939	135940	Sir Michael	160	" Bob is a good fellow , and I 'm as fond of him as if he 'd been my own son ; and and I 've been very uncomfortable about him lately . He has changed very much within the last few days , and he has taken all sorts of absurd ideas into his head , and my lady has alarmed me about him . She thinks "
136028	136043	136044	136044	she	211	" It is better not to say too much about it as yet awhile , "
136047	136054	136044	136044	she	211	" Alicia knows what I think . "
136055	136058	136060	136061	Miss Audley	163	" Yes , "
136063	136159	136060	136061	Miss Audley	163	" my lady thinks that Bob is going mad , but I know better than that . He 's not at all the sort of person to go mad . How should such a sluggish ditch - pond of an intellect as his ever work itself into a tempest ? He may move about for the rest of his life , perhaps , in a tranquil state of semi - idiotcy , imperfectly comprehending who he is , and where he 's going , and what he 's doing but he 'll never go mad . "
137606	137615	137616	137616	he	677	" If the poor little girl loves me , "
137619	137708	137616	137616	he	677	" and if she thinks that I love her , and has been led to think so by any word or act of mine , I 'm in duty bound to let her think so to the end of time , and to fulfill any tacit promise which I may have unconsciously made . I thought once I meant once to to make her an offer by - and - by when this horrible mystery about George Talboys should have been cleared up and everything peacefully settled but now "
137800	137805	137806	137806	he	677	" Poor little girl ! "
137815	138013	137806	137806	he	677	" How good it is of her to love me , and how grateful ought I to be for her tenderness . How many fellows would think such a generous , loving heart the highest boon that earth could give them . There 's Sir Harry Towers stricken with despair at his rejection . He would give me half his estate , all his estate , twice his estate , if he had it , to be in the shoes which I am anxious to shake off my ungrateful feet . Why do n't I love her ? Why is it that although I know her to be pretty , and pure , and good , and truthful , I do n't love her ? Her image never haunts me , except reproachfully . I never see her in my dreams . I never wake up suddenly in the dead of the night with her eyes shining upon me and her warm breath upon my cheek , or with the fingers of her soft hand clinging to mine . No , I 'm not in love with her , I ca n't fall in love with her . "
138276	138280	138260	138260	she	477	" opium poison . "
138320	138325	138326	138326	she	477	" If I could ! "
138329	138344	138326	138326	she	477	" if I could only do it ! And yet why should I now ? "
138447	138454	138455	138455	she	477	" How slow the time is , "
138460	138488	138455	138455	she	477	" how slow , how slow ! Shall I grow old like this , I wonder , with every minute of my life seeming like an hour ? "
138683	138691	138692	138692	she	211	" My head aches terribly , Martin , "
138695	138716	138692	138692	she	211	" I shall go and lie down till dinner - time . You may come at five to dress me . "
139338	139350	139351	139352	my lady	477	" Perhaps I shall be always dreaming these sort of dreams , "
139355	139364	139351	139352	my lady	477	" until the terror of them kills me ! "
139582	139594	139595	139596	Lady Audley	211	" Will you take a walk with me in the quadrangle ? "
139621	139631	139632	139632	Alicia	163	" Yes , if you please , my lady , "
139638	139662	139632	139632	Alicia	163	" I have been yawning over a stupid novel all the morning , and shall be very glad of a little fresh air . "
140292	140301	140303	140303	Alicia	163	" What a long day it has been ! "
140317	140345	140346	140348	the young lady	1080	" nothing but drizzle and mist and wind ! And now that it 's too late for anybody to go out , it must needs be fine , "
140397	140408	140409	140409	she	211	" They have been afraid to come and tell him , "
140412	140456	140409	140409	she	211	" they have been afraid to break the news to Sir Michael . Who will come to tell it , at last , I wonder ? The rector of Mount Stanning , perhaps , or the doctor ; some important person at least . "
140679	140695	140696	140696	she	211	" Perhaps Robert might care for me , if I had inflammation of the lungs , "
140699	140721	140696	140696	she	211	" He could n't insult me by calling me a bouncer then . Bouncers do n't have inflammation of the lungs . "
140869	140874	140875	140875	she	211	" Good gracious me ! "
140889	140889	140875	140875	she	211	"
140907	140916	140917	140917	she	211	" I must go in , my lady , "
140920	140926	140917	140917	she	211	" Wo n't you come ? "
140927	140930	140932	140933	Lady Audley	211	" Presently , "
140935	140943	140932	140933	Lady Audley	211	" I 'm dressed , you see . "
141391	141395	141396	141397	The speaker	866	" My lady ! "
141419	141427	141428	141428	he	155	" What is the matter with you ? "
141438	141449	141428	141428	he	155	" Get up , and let me take you indoors . "
141519	141533	141539	141539	he	155	" Is there any room in which I can talk to you alone ? "
141692	141696	141697	141697	he	677	" Lady Audley , "
141716	141758	141697	141697	he	677	" I spoke to you last - night very plainly , but you refused to listen to me . To - night I must speak to you still more plainly , and you must no longer refuse to listen to me . "
141792	141806	141929	141929	He	4204	" There was a fire last night at Mount Stanning , Lady Audley , "
141812	141841	141929	141929	He	4204	" the Castle Inn , the house in which I slept , was burned to the ground . Do you know how I escaped perishing in that destruction ? "
141842	141845	141929	141929	He	4204	" No . "
141846	141928	141929	141929	He	4204	" I escaped by a most providential circumstance which seems a very simple one . I did not sleep in the room which had been prepared for me . The place seemed wretchedly damp and chilly , the chimney smoked abominably when an attempt was made at lighting a fire , and I persuaded the servant to make me up a bed on the sofa in the small ground - floor sitting - room which I had occupied during the evening . "
141958	141979	141929	141929	He	4204	" Shall I tell you by whose agency the destruction of the Castle Inn was brought about , my lady ? "
141985	141991	141929	141929	He	4204	" Shall I tell you ? "
141998	142003	142005	142005	Robert	155	" My Lady Audley , "
142009	142179	142005	142005	Robert	155	" you are the incendiary . It was you whose murderous hand kindled those flames . It was you who thought by that thrice - horrible deed to rid yourself of me , your enemy and denouncer . What was it to you that other lives might be sacrificed ? If by a second massacre of Saint Bartholomew you could have ridded yourself of me you would have sacrificed an army of victims . The day is past for tenderness and mercy . For you I can no longer know pity or compunction . So far as by sparing your shame I can spare others who must suffer by your shame , I will be merciful , but no further . If there were any secret tribunal before which you might be made to answer for your crimes , I would have little scruple in being your accuser , but I would spare that generous and high - born gentleman upon whose noble name your infamy would be reflected . "
142207	142651	142198	142198	he	4207	" No life was lost in the fire of last night . I slept lightly , my lady , for my mind was troubled , as it has been for a long time , by the misery which I knew was lowering upon this house . It was I who discovered the breaking out of the fire in time to give the alarm and to save the servant girl and the poor drunken wretch , who was very much burnt in spite of efforts , and who now lies in a precarious state at his mother 's cottage . It was from him and from his wife that I learned who had visited the Castle Inn in the dead of the night . The woman was almost distracted when she saw me , and from her I discovered the particulars of last night . Heaven knows what other secrets of yours she may hold , my lady , or how easily they might be extorted from her if I wanted her aid , which I do not . My path lies very straight before me . I have sworn to bring the murderer of George Talboys to justice , and I will keep my oath . I say that it was by your agency my friend met with his death . If I have wondered sometimes , as it was only natural I should , whether I was not the victim of some horrible hallucination , whether such an alternative was not more probable than that a young and lovely woman should be capable of so foul and treacherous a murder , all wonder is past . After last night 's deed of horror , there is no crime you could commit , however vast and unnatural , which could make me wonder . Henceforth you must seem to me no longer a woman , a guilty woman with a heart which in its worst wickedness has yet some latent power to suffer and feel ; I look upon you henceforth as the demoniac incarnation of some evil principle . But you shall no longer pollute this place by your presence . Unless you will confess what you are and who you are in the presence of the man you have deceived so long , and accept from him and from me such mercy as we may be inclined to extend to you , I will gather together the witnesses who shall swear to your identity , and at peril of any shame to myself and those I love , I will bring upon you the just and awful punishment of your crime . "
142677	142682	142683	142683	she	968	" Bring Sir Michael ! "
142686	142766	142683	142683	she	968	" bring him here , and I will confess anything everything . What do I care ? God knows I have struggled hard enough against you , and fought the battle patiently enough ; but you have conquered , Mr. Robert Audley . It is a great triumph , is it not a wonderful victory ? You have used your cool , calculating , frigid , luminous intellect to a noble purpose . You have conquered a MAD WOMAN ! "
142767	142772	142774	142775	Mr. Audley	155	" A mad woman ! "
142777	142913	142683	142683	she	968	" Yes , a mad woman . When you say that I killed George Talboys , you say the truth . When you say that I murdered him treacherously and foully , you lie . I killed him because I AM MAD ! because my intellect is a little way upon the wrong side of that narrow boundary - line between sanity and insanity ; because , when George Talboys goaded me , as you have goaded me , and reproached me , and threatened me , my mind , never properly balanced , utterly lost its balance , and I was mad ! Bring Sir Michael ; and bring him quickly . If he is to be told one thing let him be told everything ; let him hear the secret of my life ! "
143015	143022	143023	143023	He	155	" the secret of my life . "
143054	143077	143049	143049	He	155	" You should forgive me , for you know why I have been so . You know the secret of my life . "
143127	143223	143225	143227	the young man	677	" Lady Audley has a confession to make to you , sir a confession which I know will be a most cruel surprise , a most bitter grief . But it is necessary for your present honor , and for your future peace , that you should hear it . She has deceived you , I regret to say , most basely ; but it is only right that you should hear from her own lips any excuses which she may have to offer for her wickedness . May God soften this blow for you ! "
143233	143238	143225	143227	the young man	677	" I can not ! "
143282	143285	143286	143286	he	160	" Lucy ! "
143318	143343	143353	143353	he	160	" Lucy , tell me that this man is a madman ! tell me so , my love , or I shall kill him ! "
143420	143428	143430	143431	my lady	477	" He has told you the truth , "
143433	143549	143430	143431	my lady	477	" and he is not mad ! I have sent him for you that I may confess everything to you . I should be sorry for you if I could , for you have been very , very good to me , much better to me than I ever deserved ; but I ca n't , I ca n't I can feel nothing but my own misery . I told you long ago that I was selfish ; I am selfish still more selfish than ever in my misery . Happy , prosperous people may feel for others . I laugh at other people 's sufferings ; they seem so small compared to my own . "
143630	143685	143687	143688	my lady	477	" I must tell you the story of my life , in order to tell you why I have become the miserable wretch who has no better hope than to be allowed to run away and hide in some desolate corner of the earth . I must tell you the story of my life , "
143690	143918	143687	143688	my lady	477	" but you need not fear that I shall dwell long upon it . It has not been so pleasant to me that I should wish to remember it . When I was a very little child I remember asking a question which it was natural enough that I should ask , God help me ! I asked where my mother was . I had a faint remembrance of a face , like what my own is now , looking at me when I was very little better than a baby ; but I had missed the face suddenly , and had never seen it since . They told me that mother was away . I was not happy , for the woman who had charge of me was a disagreeable woman and the place in which we lived was a lonely place , a village upon the Hampshire coast , about seven miles from Portsmouth . My father , who was in the navy , only came now and then to see me ; and I was left almost entirely to the charge of this woman , who was irregularly paid , and who vented her rage upon me when my father was behindhand in remitting her money . So you see that at a very early age I found out what it was to be poor .
143919	144046	144405	144405	My	0	" Perhaps it was more from being discontented with my dreary life than from any wonderful impulse of affection , that I asked very often the same question about my mother . I always received the same answer she was away . When I asked where , I was told that that was a secret . When I grew old enough to understand the meaning of the word death , I asked if my mother was dead , and I was told ' No , she was not dead ; she was ill , and she was away . ' I asked how long she had been ill , and I was told that she had been so some years , ever since I was a baby .
144047	144176	143687	143688	my lady	477	" At last the secret came out . I worried my foster - mother with the old question one day when the remittances had fallen very much in arrear , and her temper had been unusually tried . She flew into a passion , and told me that my mother was a mad woman , and that she was in a madhouse forty miles away . She had scarcely said this when she repented , and told me that it was not the truth , and that I was not to believe it , or to say that she had told me such a thing . I discovered afterward that my father had made her promise most solemnly never to tell me the secret of my mother 's fate .
144177	144325	144405	144405	My	0	" I brooded horribly upon the thought of my mother 's madness . It haunted me by day and night . I was always picturing to myself this mad woman pacing up and down some prison cell , in a hideous garment that bound her tortured limbs . I had exaggerated ideas of the horror of her situation . I had no knowledge of the different degrees of madness , and the image that haunted me was that of a distraught and violent creature , who would fall upon me and kill me if I came within her reach . This idea grew upon me until I used to awake in the dead of night , screaming aloud in an agony of terror , from a dream in which I had felt my mother 's icy grasp upon my throat , and heard her ravings in my ear .
144326	144404	143687	143688	my lady	477	" When I was ten years old my father came to pay up the arrears due to my protectress , and to take me to school . He had left me in Hampshire longer than he had intended , from his inability to pay this money ; so there again I felt the bitterness of poverty , and ran the risk of growing up an ignorant creature among coarse rustic children , because my father was poor . "
144548	144680	144515	144515	She	477	" My father came at last , and I told him what I had discovered . He was very much affected when I spoke of my mother . He was not what the world generally calls a good man , but I learned afterward that he had loved his wife very dearly , and that he would have willingly sacrificed his life to her , and constituted himself her guardian , had he not been compelled to earn the daily bread of the mad woman and her child by the exercise of his profession . So here again I beheld what a bitter thing it is to be poor . My mother , who might have been tended by a devoted husband , was given over to the care of hired nurses .
144681	144780	144515	144515	She	477	" Before my father sent me to school at Torquay , he took me to see my mother . This visit served at least to dispel the idea which had so often terrified me . I saw no raving , straight - waist - coated maniac , guarded by zealous jailers , but a golden - haired , blue - eyed , girlish creature , who seemed as frivolous as a butterfly , and who skipped toward us with her yellow curls decorated with natural flowers , and saluted us with radiant smiles , and gay , ceaseless chatter .
144781	144869	144515	144515	She	477	" But she did n't know us . She would have spoken in the same manner to any stranger who had entered the gates of the garden about her prison - house . Her madness was an hereditary disease transmitted to her from her mother , who had died mad . She , my mother , had been , or had appeared sane up to the hour of my birth , but from that hour her intellect had decayed , and she had become what I saw her .
144870	144897	144515	144515	She	477	" I went away with the knowledge of this , and with the knowledge that the only inheritance I had to expect from my mother was insanity !
144898	144969	144515	144515	She	477	" I went away with this knowledge in my mind , and with something more a secret to keep . I was a child of ten years only , but I felt all the weight of that burden . I was to keep the secret of my mother 's madness ; for it was a secret that might affect me injuriously in after - life . I was to remember this .
144970	145116	144515	144515	She	477	" I did remember this ; and it was , perhaps , this that made me selfish and heartless , for I suppose I am heartless . As I grew older I was told that I was pretty beautiful lovely bewitching . I heard all these things at first indifferently , but by - and - by I listened to them greedily , and began to think that in spite of the secret of my life I might be more successful in the world 's great lottery than my companions . I had learnt that which in some indefinite manner or other every school - girl learns sooner or later I learned that my ultimate fate in life depended upon my marriage , and I concluded that if I was indeed prettier than my schoolfellows , I ought to marry better than any one of them .
145117	145177	144515	144515	She	477	" I left school before I was seventeen years of age , with this thought in my mind , and I went to live at the other extremity of England with my father , who had retired upon his half - pay , and had established himself at Wildernsea , with the idea that the place was cheap and select .
145178	145289	144515	144515	She	477	" The place was indeed select . I had not been there a month before I discovered that even the prettiest girl might wait a long time for a rich husband . I wish to hurry over this part of my life . I dare say I was very despicable . You and your nephew , Sir Michael , have been rich all your lives , and can very well afford to despise me ; but I knew how far poverty can affect a life , and I looked forward with a sickening dread to a life so affected . At last the rich suitor , the wandering prince came . "
145383	145389	145390	145390	she	4237	" The wandering prince came , "
145393	145400	145390	145390	she	4237	" he was called George Talboys . "
145463	145553	145559	145561	Sir Michael Audley	160	" Mr. George Talboys was a cornet in a dragoon regiment . He was the only son of a rich country gentleman . He fell in love with me , and married me three months after my seventeenth birthday . I think I loved him as much as it was in my power to love anybody ; not more than I have loved you , Sir Michael not so much , for when you married me you elevated me to a position that he could never have given me . "
145801	145806	145807	145808	my lady	477	" We were married , "
145811	146089	145807	145808	my lady	477	" and I loved him very well , quite well enough to be happy with him as long as his money lasted , and while we were on the Continent , traveling in the best style and always staying at the best hotels . But when we came back to Wildernsea and lived with papa , and all the money was gone , and George grew gloomy and wretched , and was always thinking of his troubles , and appeared to neglect me , I was very unhappy , and it seemed as if this fine marriage had only given me a twelvemonth 's gayety and extravagance after all . I begged George to appeal to his father , but he refused . I persuaded him to try and get employment , and he failed . My baby was born , and the crisis which had been fatal to my mother arose for me . I escaped , but I was more irritable perhaps after my recovery , less inclined to fight the hard battle of the world , more disposed to complain of poverty and neglect . I did complain one day , loudly and bitterly ; I upbraided George Talboys for his cruelty in having allied a helpless girl to poverty and misery , and he flew into a passion with me and ran out of the house . When I awoke the next morning , I found a letter lying on the table by my bed , telling me that he was going to the antipodes to seek his fortune , and that he would never see me again until he was a rich man .
146090	146346	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I looked upon this as a desertion , and I resented it bitterly resented it by hating the man who had left me with no protector but a weak , tipsy father , and with a child to support . I had to work hard for my living , and in every hour of labor and what labor is more wearisome than the dull slavery of a governess ? I recognized a separate wrong done me by George Talboys . His father was rich , his sister was living in luxury and respectability , and I , his wife , and the mother of his son , was a slave allied to beggary and obscurity . People pitied me , and I hated them for their pity . I did not love the child , for he had been left a burden upon my hands . The hereditary taint that was in my blood had never until this time showed itself by any one sign or token ; but at this time I became subject to fits of violence and despair . At this time I think my mind first lost its balance , and for the first time I crossed that invisible line which separates reason from madness . I have seen my father 's eyes fixed upon me in horror and alarm . I have known him soothe me as only mad people and children are soothed , and I have chafed against his petty devices , I have resented even his indulgence .
146347	146407	145807	145808	my lady	477	" At last these fits of desperation resolved themselves into a desperate purpose . I determined to run away from this wretched home which my slavery supported . I determined to desert this father who had more fear of me than love for me . I determined to go to London and lose myself in that great chaos of humanity .
146408	146504	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I had seen an advertisement in the Times while I was at Wildernsea , and I presented myself to Mrs. Vincent , the advertiser , under a feigned name . She accepted me , waiving all questions as to my antecedents . You know the rest . I came here , and you made me an offer , the acceptance of which would lift me at once into the sphere to which my ambition had pointed ever since I was a school - girl , and heard for the first time that I was pretty .
146505	146563	145807	145808	my lady	477	" Three years had passed , and I had received no token of my husband 's existence ; for , I argued , that if he had returned to England , he would have succeeded in finding me under any name and in any place . I knew the energy of his character well enough to know this .
146564	146707	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I said ' I have a right to think that he is dead , or that he wishes me to believe him dead , and his shadow shall not stand between me and prosperity . ' I said this , and I became your wife , Sir Michael , with every resolution to be as good a wife as it was in my nature to be . The common temptations that assail and shipwreck some women had no terror for me . I would have been your true and pure wife to the end of time , though I had been surrounded by a legion of tempters . The mad folly that the world calls love had never had any part in my madness , and here at least extremes met , and the vice of heartlessness became the virtue of constancy .
146708	146882	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I was very happy in the first triumph and grandeur of my new position , very grateful to the hand that had lifted me to it . In the sunshine of my own happiness I felt , for the first time in my life , for the miseries of others . I had been poor myself , and I was now rich , and could afford to pity and relieve the poverty of my neighbors . I took pleasure in acts of kindness and benevolence . I found out my father 's address and sent him large sums of money , anonymously , for I did not wish him to discover what had become of me . I availed myself to the full of the privilege your generosity afforded me . I dispensed happiness on every side . I saw myself loved as well as admired , and I think I might have been a good woman for the rest of my life , if fate would have allowed me to be so .
146883	146943	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I believe that at this time my mind regained its just balance . I had watched myself very closely since leaving Wildernsea ; I had held a check upon myself . I had often wondered while sitting in the surgeon 's quiet family circle whether any suspicion of that invisible , hereditary taint had ever occurred to Mr. Dawson .
146944	147013	145807	145808	my lady	477	" Fate would not suffer me to be good . My destiny compelled me to be a wretch . Within a month of my marriage , I read in one of the Essex papers of the return of a certain Mr. Talboys , a fortunate gold - seeker , from Australia . The ship had sailed at the time I read the paragraph . What was to be done ?
147014	147069	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I said just now that I knew the energy of George 's character . I knew that the man who had gone to the antipodes and won a fortune for his wife would leave no stone unturned in his efforts to find her . It was hopeless to think of hiding myself from him .
147070	147092	145807	145808	my lady	477	" Unless he could be induced to believe that I was dead , he would never cease in his search for me .
147093	147121	145807	145808	my lady	477	" My brain was dazed as I thought of my peril . Again the balance trembled , again the invisible boundary was passed , again I was mad .
147122	147188	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I went down to Southampton and found my father , who was living there with my child . You remember how Mrs. Vincent 's name was used as an excuse for this hurried journey , and how it was contrived I should go with no other escort than Phoebe Marks , whom I left at the hotel while I went to my father 's house .
147189	147254	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I confided to my father the whole secret of my peril . He was not very much shocked at what I had done , for poverty had perhaps blunted his sense of honor and principle . He was not very much shocked , but he was frightened , and he promised to do all in his power to assist me in my horrible emergency .
147255	147320	145807	145808	my lady	477	" He had received a letter addressed to me at Wildernsea , by George , and forwarded from there to my father . This letter had been written within a few days of the sailing of the Argus , and it announced the probable date of the ship 's arrival at Liverpool . This letter gave us , therefore , data upon which to act .
147321	147362	145807	145808	my lady	477	" We decided at once upon the first step . This was that on the date of the probable arrival of the Argus , or a few days later , an advertisement of my death should be inserted in the Times .
147363	147439	145807	145808	my lady	477	" But almost immediately after deciding upon this , we saw that there were fearful difficulties in the carrying out of such a simple plan . The date of the death , and the place in which I died , must be announced , as well as the death itself . George would immediately hurry to that place , however distant it might be , however comparatively inaccessible , and the shallow falsehood would be discovered .
147440	147492	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I knew enough of his sanguine temperament , his courage and determination , his readiness to hope against hope , to know that unless he saw the grave in which I was buried , and the register of my death , he would never believe that I was lost to him .
147493	147523	145807	145808	my lady	477	" My father was utterly dumfounded and helpless . He could only shed childish tears of despair and terror . He was of no use to me in this crisis .
147524	147570	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I was hopeless of any issue out of my difficulties . I began to think that I must trust to the chapter of accidents , and hope that among other obscure corners of the earth , Audley Court might be undreamt of by my husband .
147571	147650	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I sat with my father , drinking tea with him in his miserable hovel , and playing with the child , who was pleased with my dress and jewels , but quite unconscious that I was anything but a stranger to him . I had the boy in my arms , when a woman who attended him came to fetch him that she might make him more fit to be seen by the lady , as she said .
147651	147681	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I was anxious to know how the boy was treated , and I detained this woman in conversation with me while my father dozed over the tea - table .
147682	147812	145807	145808	my lady	477	" She was a pale - faced , sandy - haired woman of about five - and - forty and she seemed very glad to get the chance of talking to me as long as I pleased to allow her . She soon left off talking of the boy , however , to tell me of her own troubles . She was in very great trouble , she told me . Her eldest daughter had been obliged to leave her situation from ill - health ; in fact , the doctor said the girl was in a decline ; and it was a hard thing for a poor widow who had seen better days to have a sick daughter to support , as well as a family of young children .
147813	148023	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I let the woman run on for a long time in this manner , telling me the girl 's ailments , and the girl 's age , and the girl 's doctor 's stuff , and piety , and sufferings , and a great deal more . But I neither listened to her nor heeded her . I heard her , but only in a far - away manner , as I heard the traffic in the street , or the ripple of the stream at the bottom of it . What were this woman 's troubles to me ? I had miseries of my own , and worse miseries than her coarse nature could ever have to endure . These sort of people always had sick husbands or sick children , and expected to be helped in their illness by the rich . It was nothing out of the common . I was thinking this , and I was just going to dismiss the woman with a sovereign for her sick daughter , when an idea flashed upon me with such painful suddenness that it sent the blood surging up to my brain , and set my heart beating , as it only beats when I am mad .
148024	148146	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I asked the woman her name . She was a Mrs. Plowson , and she kept a small general shop , she said , and only ran in now and then to look after Georgey , and to see that the little maid - of - all - work took care of him . Her daughter 's name was Matilda . I asked her several questions about this girl Matilda , and I ascertained that she was four - and - twenty , that she had always been consumptive , and that she was now , as the doctor said , going off in a rapid decline . He had declared that she could not last much more than a fortnight .
148147	148167	145807	145808	my lady	477	" It was in three weeks that the ship that carried George Talboys was expected to anchor in the Mersey .
148168	148361	145807	145808	my lady	477	" I need not dwell upon this business . I visited the sick girl . She was fair and slender . Her description , carelessly given , might tally nearly enough with my own , though she bore no shadow of resemblance to me , except in these two particulars . I was received by the girl as a rich lady who wished to do her a service . I bought the mother , who was poor and greedy , and who for a gift of money , more money than she had ever before received , consented to submit to anything I wished . Upon the second day after my introduction to this Mrs. Plowson , my father went over to Ventnor , and hired lodgings for his invalid daughter and her little boy . Early the next morning he carried over the dying girl and Georgey , who had been bribed to call her ' mamma . ' She entered the house as Mrs. Talboys ; she was attended by a Ventnor medical man as Mrs. Talboys ; she died , and her death and burial were registered in that name .
148362	148402	145807	145808	my lady	477	" The advertisement was inserted in the Times , and upon the second day after its insertion George Talboys visited Ventnor , and ordered the tombstone which at this hour records the death of his wife , Helen Talboys . "
148432	148440	148441	148441	he	160	" I can not hear any more , "
148449	148572	148441	148441	he	160	" if there is anything more to be told I can not hear it . Robert , it is you who have brought about this discovery , as I understand . I want to know nothing more . Will you take upon yourself the duty of providing for the safety and comfort of this lady whom I have thought my wife ? I need not ask you to remember in all you do , that I have loved her very dearly and truly . I can not say farewell to her . I will not say it until I can think of her without bitterness until I can pity her , as I now pray that God may pity her this night . "
149081	149084	149086	149087	Robert Audley	155	" No , "
149089	149178	149086	149087	Robert Audley	155	" I will not intrude upon the anguish of this wounded heart . There is humiliation mingled with this bitter grief . It is better he should fight the battle alone . I have done what I believe to have been my solemn duty , yet I should scarcely wonder if I had rendered myself forever hateful to him . It is better he should fight the battle alone . I can do nothing to make the strife less terrible . Better that it should be fought alone . "
149267	149274	149276	149277	Miss Audley	163	" Is papa coming to dinner ? "
149279	149320	149322	149324	the young lady	1080	" I 'm so hungry ; and poor Tomlins has sent up three times to say the fish will be spoiled . It must be reduced to a species of isinglass soup , by this time , I should think , "
149365	149376	149377	149377	she	1080	" Oh , it 's you , Mr. Robert Audley . "
149382	149412	149377	149377	she	1080	" You dine with us of course . Pray go and find papa . It must be nearly eight o'clock , and we are supposed to dine at six . "
149456	149469	149470	149472	the young man	677	" Your papa has just endured a very great grief , Alicia , "
149506	149510	149511	149511	she	163	" A grief ? "
149514	149526	149511	149511	she	163	" papa grieved ! Oh ! Robert , what has happened ? "
149527	149537	149538	149538	Robert	155	" I can tell you nothing yet , Alicia , "
149576	149584	149585	149585	he	155	" Alicia , can I trust you ? "
149590	149597	149573	149573	he	155	" Trust me to do what ? "
149598	149616	149573	149573	he	155	" To be a comfort and a friend to your poor father under a very heavy affliction . "
149617	149620	149622	149622	Alicia	163	" Yes ! "
149626	149672	149622	149622	Alicia	163	" How can you ask me such a question ? Do you think there is anything I would not do to lighten any sorrow of my father 's ? Do you think there is anything I would not suffer if my suffering could lighten his ? "
149688	149720	149721	149721	she	163	" Oh , Robert ! Robert ! could you think so badly of me as to think I would not try to be a comfort to my father in his grief ? "
149726	149734	149736	149738	the young man	677	" No , no , my dear , "
149742	149761	149736	149738	the young man	677	" I never doubted your affection , I only doubted your discretion . May I rely upon that ? "
149762	149768	149770	149770	Alicia	163	" You may , Robert , "
149774	149847	149736	149738	the young man	677	" Very well , then , my dear girl , I will trust you . Your father is going to leave the Court , for a time at least . The grief which he has just endured a sudden and unlooked - for sorrow , remember has no doubt made this place hateful to him . He is going away ; but he must not go alone , must he , Alicia ? "
149848	149860	149736	149738	the young man	677	" Alone ? no ! no ! But I suppose my lady "
149861	149870	149872	149872	Robert	155	" Lady Audley will not go with him , "
149876	149886	149872	149872	Robert	155	" he is about to separate himself from her . "
149887	149892	149736	149738	the young man	677	" For a time ? "
149893	149898	149872	149872	Robert	155	" No , forever . "
149899	149906	149908	149908	Alicia	163	" Separate himself from her forever ! "
149910	149914	149908	149908	Alicia	163	" Then this grief "
149915	149933	149872	149872	Robert	155	" Is connected with Lady Audley . Lady Audley is the cause of your father 's sorrow . "
150027	150044	150045	150045	he	155	" You will offer to accompany your father wherever he may choose to go , Alicia , "
150048	150144	150045	150045	he	155	" You are his natural comforter at such a time as this , but you will best befriend him in this hour of trial by avoiding all intrusion upon his grief . Your very ignorance of the particulars of that grief will be a security for your discretion . Say nothing to your father that you might not have said to him two years ago , before he married a second wife . Try and be to him what you were before the woman in yonder room came between you and your father 's love . "
150145	150149	150151	150151	Alicia	163	" I will , "
150153	150157	150151	150151	Alicia	163	" I will . "
150158	150252	150045	150045	he	155	" You will naturally avoid all mention of Lady Audley 's name . If your father is often silent , be patient ; if it sometimes seems to you that the shadow of this great sorrow will never pass away from his life , be patient still ; and remember that there can be no better hope of a cure of his grief than the hope that his daughter 's devotion may lead him to remember there is one woman upon this earth who will love him truly and purely until the last . "
150253	150266	150151	150151	Alicia	163	" Yes yes , Robert , dear cousin , I will remember . "
150293	150298	150299	150299	he	155	" My dear Alicia , "
150302	150396	150299	150299	he	155	" do this and you will make me happy . I have been in some measure the means of bringing this sorrow upon your father . Let me hope that it is not an enduring one . Try and restore my uncle to happiness , Alicia , and I will love you more dearly than brother ever loved a noble - hearted sister ; and a brotherly affection may be worth having , perhaps , after all , my dear , though it is very different to poor Sir Harry 's enthusiastic worship . "
150446	150455	150456	150456	she	163	" You are a good fellow , Bob , "
150459	150474	150456	150456	she	163	" and I 've been very foolish and wicked to feel angry with you because "
150481	150488	150490	150491	Mr. Audley	155	" Because what , my dear ? "
150493	150502	150503	150503	Alicia	163	" Because I 'm silly , Cousin Robert , "
150508	150590	150503	150503	Alicia	163	" never mind that , Bob , I 'll do all you wish , and it shall not be my fault if my dearest father does n't forget his troubles before long . I 'd go to the end of the world with him , poor darling , if I thought there was any comfort to be found for him in the journey . I 'll go and get ready directly . Do you think papa will go to - night ? "
150591	150613	150503	150503	Alicia	163	" Yes , my dear ; I do n't think Sir Michael will rest another night under this roof yet awhile . "
150614	150624	150626	150626	Alicia	163	" The mail goes at twenty minutes past nine , "
150628	150656	150626	150626	Alicia	163	" we must leave the house in an hour if we are to travel by it . I shall see you again before we go , Robert ? "
150657	150662	150503	150503	Alicia	163	" Yes , dear . "
150939	150951	150952	150952	he	160	" Have you anything more to say to me , Robert ? "
150957	150981	150931	150932	Sir Michael	160	" I only came to ascertain if I could assist in any of your arrangements . You go to London by the mail ? "
150982	150985	150931	150932	Sir Michael	160	" Yes . "
150986	150997	150931	150932	Sir Michael	160	" Have you any idea of where you will stay . "
150998	151021	150931	150932	Sir Michael	160	" Yes , I shall stop at the Clarendon ; I am known there . Is that all you have to say ? "
151022	151032	150931	150932	Sir Michael	160	" Yes ; except that Alicia will accompany you ? "
151033	151036	150931	150932	Sir Michael	160	" Alicia ! "
151037	151063	150931	150932	Sir Michael	160	" She could not very well stay here , you know , just now . It would be best for her to leave the Court until "
151064	151072	151074	151075	the baronet	474	" Yes , yes , I understand , "
151077	151093	151074	151075	the baronet	474	" but is there nowhere else that she could go must she be with me ? "
151094	151112	150931	150932	Sir Michael	160	" She could go nowhere else so immediately , and she would not be happy anywhere else . "
151113	151120	151122	151123	Sir Michael	160	" Let her come , then , "
151125	151130	151122	151123	Sir Michael	160	" let her come . "
151194	151217	151250	151250	he	474	" Very well , my dear uncle , then all is arranged ; Alicia will be ready to start at nine o'clock . "
151218	151225	151227	151228	the baronet	474	" Very good , very good , "
151230	151245	151227	151228	the baronet	474	" let her come if she pleases , poor child , let her come . "
151290	151302	151304	151304	Robert	155	" I shall see you again before you go , sir , "
151306	151314	151304	151304	Robert	155	" I will leave you till then . "
151315	151318	151320	151321	Sir Michael	160	" Stay ! "
151325	151331	151320	151321	Sir Michael	160	" have you told Alicia ? "
151332	151352	151304	151304	Robert	155	" I have told her nothing , except that you are about to leave the Court for some time . "
151353	151367	151368	151369	the baronet	474	" You are very good , my boy , you are very good , "
151398	151410	151411	151411	he	1157	" Oh , sir ! how can I ever forgive myself ? "
151414	151431	151411	151411	he	1157	" how can I ever cease to hate myself for having brought this grief upon you ? "
151432	151468	151500	151502	Lucy Lady Audley	211	" No , no , Robert , you did right ; I wish that God had been so merciful to me as to take my miserable life before this night ; but you did right . "
151607	151614	151615	151615	he	155	" Lady Audley is very ill , "
151618	151662	151615	151615	he	155	" take her to her room and see that she does not leave it to - night . You will be good enough to remain near her , but do not either talk to her or suffer her to excite herself by talking . "
151719	151724	151725	151725	she	477	" Take me away , "
151728	151745	151725	151725	she	477	" and let me sleep ! Let me sleep , for my brain is on fire ! "
151763	151769	151770	151770	she	477	" Is Sir Michael gone ? "
151773	151782	151756	151756	she	477	" He will leave in half an hour . "
151783	151796	151756	151756	she	477	" There were no lives lost in the fire at Mount Stanning ? "
151797	151800	151756	151756	she	477	" None . "
151801	151808	151756	151756	she	477	" I am glad of that . "
151809	151840	151756	151756	she	477	" The landlord of the house , Marks , was very terribly burned , and lies in a precarious state at his mother 's cottage ; but he may recover . "
151841	151862	151756	151756	she	477	" I am glad of that I am glad no life was lost . Good - night , Mr. Audley . "
151863	151887	151756	151756	she	477	" I shall ask to see you for half an hour 's conversation in the course of to - morrow , my lady . "
151888	151896	151756	151756	she	477	" Whenever you please . Good night . "
151897	151901	151756	151756	she	477	" Good night . "
152071	152078	152080	152081	Miss Audley	163	" Good - by , Robert , "
152091	152111	152080	152081	Miss Audley	163	" good - by , and God bless you ! You may trust me to take care of papa . "
152112	152126	152133	152134	Robert Audley	155	" I am sure I may . God bless you , my dear . "
152249	152259	152260	152260	he	474	" I leave all in your hands , Robert , "
152278	152322	152260	152260	he	474	" I may not have heard the end , but I have heard enough . Heaven knows I have no need to hear more . I leave all to you , but you will not be cruel you will remember how much I loved "
152334	152344	152345	152347	the young man	677	" I will remember you in everything , sir , "
152350	152359	152345	152347	the young man	677	" I will do everything for the best . "
152435	152439	152440	152440	he	155	" Good Heaven ! "
152653	152653	152643	152644	the tocsin	4361	"
152728	152739	152740	152740	he	155	" Can I send a message from here to London ? "
152743	152756	152716	152716	his	155	" It can be sent from Brentwood , sir not from here . "
152765	152787	152833	152834	The man	644	" One of the men can ride over to Brentwood , sir , if you wish any message to be sent . "
152788	152806	152833	152834	The man	644	" I do wish to send a message ; will you manage it for me , Richards ? "
152807	152812	152833	152834	The man	644	" Certainly , sir . "
152813	152826	152833	152834	The man	644	" You can wait , then , while I write the message . "
152827	152832	152833	152834	The man	644	" Yes , sir . "
152884	152905	152955	152956	the man	644	" From Robert Audley , of Audley Court , Essex , to Francis Wilmington , of Paper - buildings , Temple .
152906	152940	152955	152956	the man	644	" DEAR WILMINGTON If you know any physician experienced in cases of mania , and to be trusted with a secret , be so good as to send me his address by telegraph . "
152962	152977	152978	152978	he	155	" You will see that this is given to a trustworthy person , Richards , "
152981	153007	152978	152978	he	155	" and let the man wait at the station for the return message . He ought to get it in an hour and a half . "
153537	153556	153591	153591	he	155	" DEAR AUDLEY Always glad to oblige . Alwyn Mosgrave , M.D. , 12 Saville Row . Safe . "
153569	153585	153591	153591	he	155	" I shall want another message taken to Brentwood to - morrow morning , Richards , "
153596	153622	153591	153591	he	155	" I should be glad if the man would ride over with it before breakfast . He shall have half a sovereign for his trouble . "
153627	153647	153648	153648	he	155	" Thank you , sir not necessary , sir ; but as you please , of course , sir , "
153651	153663	153648	153648	he	155	" At what hour might you wish the man to go ? "
153689	153700	153702	153702	Robert	155	" My room is ready , I suppose , Richards ? "
153704	153712	153702	153702	Robert	155	" Yes , sir your old room . "
153713	153747	153702	153702	Robert	155	" Very good . I shall go to bed at once . Bring me a glass of brandy and water as hot as you can make it , and wait for the telegram . "
154508	154520	154521	154521	he	155	" I will appeal to the experience of this Dr. Mosgrave , "
154524	154547	154521	154521	he	155	" physicians and lawyers are the confessors of this prosaic nineteenth century . Surely , he will be able to help me . "
154774	154784	154786	154787	Mr. Audley	155	" He is wondering whether I am the patient , "
154789	154802	154786	154787	Mr. Audley	155	" and is looking for the diagnoses of madness in my face . "
154814	154829	154830	154830	he	355	" Is it not about your own health that you wish to consult me ? "
154835	154840	154841	154842	Dr. Mosgrave	355	" Oh , no ! "
154875	154887	154888	154888	he	355	" I need not remind you that my time is precious , "
154891	154919	154888	154888	he	355	" your telegram informed me that my services were required in a case of danger as I apprehend , or I should not be here this morning . "
154949	154958	154959	154959	he	355	" You are very good , Dr. Mosgrave , "
154968	155044	154959	154959	he	355	" and I thank you very much for having responded to my summons . I am about to appeal to you upon a subject which is more painful to me than words can describe . I am about to implore your advice in a most difficult case , and I trust almost blindly to your experience to rescue me , and others who are very dear to me , from a cruel and complicated position . "
155068	155095	155096	155096	Robert	155	" The revelation made by the patient to the physician is , I believe , as sacred as the confession of a penitent to his priest ? "
155101	155106	155062	155062	he	355	" Quite as sacred . "
155107	155119	155062	155062	he	355	" A solemn confidence , to be violated under no circumstances ? "
155120	155124	155062	155062	he	355	" Most certainly . "
155154	155179	155136	155136	he	155	" I have been given to understand , Dr. Mosgrave , that you have devoted much of your attention to the treatment of insanity . "
155180	155195	155136	155136	he	155	" Yes , my practice is almost confined to the treatment of mental diseases . "
155196	155221	155136	155136	he	155	" Such being the case , I think I may venture to conclude that you sometimes receive strange , and even terrible , revelations . "
155264	155280	155282	155282	Robert	155	" The story which I am about to tell you is not my own story , "
155288	155329	155282	155282	Robert	155	" you will forgive me , therefore , if I once more remind you that I can only reveal it upon the understanding that under no circumstances , or upon no apparent justification , is that confidence to be betrayed . "
155344	155353	155354	155354	he	355	" I am all attention , Mr. Audley , "
155522	155531	155532	155532	he	155	" You have nothing further to tell me ? "
155535	155551	155552	155552	Robert	155	" No . I do not think there is anything more that need be told , "
155558	155580	155582	155583	the physician	7019	" You would wish to prove that this lady is mad , and therefore irresponsible for her actions , Mr. Audley ? "
155611	155636	155599	155599	he	155	" Yes , I would rather , if possible , think her mad ; I should be glad to find that excuse for her . "
155637	155654	155656	155657	Dr. Mosgrave	355	" And to save the esclandre of a Chancery suit , I suppose , Mr. Audley , "
155744	155758	155759	155760	the physician	7019	" I fear that I shall not be of any use to you , "
155765	155786	155759	155760	the physician	7019	" I will see the lady , if you please , but I do not believe that she is mad . "
155787	155791	155759	155760	the physician	7019	" Why not ? "
155792	155905	155759	155760	the physician	7019	" Because there is no evidence of madness in anything she has done . She ran away from her home , because her home was not a pleasant one , and she left in the hope of finding a better . There is no madness in that . She committed the crime of bigamy , because by that crime she obtained fortune and position . There is no madness there . When she found herself in a desperate position , she did not grow desperate . She employed intelligent means , and she carried out a conspiracy which required coolness and deliberation in its execution . There is no madness in that . "
155906	155913	155759	155760	the physician	7019	" But the traits of hereditary insanity "
155914	156025	155759	155760	the physician	7019	" May descend to the third generation , and appear in the lady 's children , if she have any . Madness is not necessarily transmitted from mother to daughter . I should be glad to help you , if I could , Mr. Audley , but I do not think there is any proof of insanity in the story you have told me . I do not think any jury in England would accept the plea of insanity in such a case as this . The best thing you can do with this lady is to send her back to her first husband ; if he will have her . "
156036	156043	156044	156044	he	155	" Her first husband is dead , "
156047	156069	156044	156044	he	155	" at least , he has been missing for some time and I have reason to believe that he is dead . "
156093	156102	156103	156103	he	355	" The lady 's first husband is missing , "
156113	156121	156103	156103	he	355	" you think that he is dead ? "
156140	156144	156145	156145	he	355	" Mr. Audley , "
156150	156168	156145	156145	he	355	" there must be no half - confidences between us . You have not told me all . "
156188	156204	156206	156207	Dr. Mosgrave	355	" I should be very poorly able to meet the contingencies of my professional experience , "
156209	156257	156206	156207	Dr. Mosgrave	355	" if I could not perceive where confidence ends and reservation begins . You have only told me half this lady 's story , Mr. Audley . You must tell me more before I can offer you any advice . What has become of the first husband ? "
156282	156298	156269	156269	he	355	" I have already told you , Dr. Mosgrave , that I do not know . "
156299	156302	156304	156305	the physician	7019	" Yes , "
156307	156329	156304	156305	the physician	7019	" but your face has told me what you have withheld from me ; it has told me that you suspect . "
156335	156354	156356	156357	the physician	7019	" If I am to be of use to you , you must trust me , Mr. Audley , "
156359	156378	156356	156357	the physician	7019	" The first husband disappeared how and when ? I want to know the history of his disappearance . "
156418	156427	156428	156428	he	155	" I will trust you , Dr. Mosgrave , "
156431	156475	156428	156428	he	155	" I will confide entirely in your honor and goodness . I do not ask you to do any wrong to society ; but I ask you to save our stainless name from degradation and shame , if you can do so conscientiously . "
156584	156593	156594	156594	he	155	" I can only spare you twenty minutes , "
156597	156617	156594	156594	he	155	" I will see the lady , if you please . You say her mother died in a madhouse ? "
156618	156629	156643	156646	my lady 's maid	4450	" She did . Will you see Lady Audley alone ? "
156630	156639	156594	156594	he	155	" Yes , alone , if you please . "
156693	156701	156702	156702	he	155	" I have talked to the lady , "
156707	156816	156702	156702	he	155	" and we understand each other very well . There is latent insanity ! Insanity which might never appear ; or which might appear only once or twice in a lifetime . It would be a dementia in its worst phase , perhaps ; acute mania ; but its duration would be very brief , and it would only arise under extreme mental pressure . The lady is not mad ; but she has the hereditary taint in her blood . She has the cunning of madness , with the prudence of intelligence . I will tell you what she is , Mr. Audley . She is dangerous ! "
156833	156850	156851	156851	he	355	" I will not discuss the probabilities of the suspicion which distresses you , Mr. Audley , "
156856	156937	156851	156851	he	355	" but I will tell you this much , I do not advise any esclandre . This Mr. George Talboys has disappeared , but you have no evidence of his death . If you could produce evidence of his death , you could produce no evidence against this lady , beyond the one fact that she had a powerful motive for getting rid of him . No jury in the United Kingdom would condemn her upon such evidence as that . "
156946	156955	156956	156956	he	155	" I assure you , my dear sir , "
156959	156973	156956	156956	he	155	" that my greatest fear is the necessity of any exposure any disgrace . "
156974	156980	156982	156983	the physician	7019	" Certainly , Mr. Audley , "
156987	157078	156982	156983	the physician	7019	" but you can not expect me to assist you to condone one of the worst offenses against society . If I saw adequate reason for believing that a murder had been committed by this woman , I should refuse to assist you in smuggling her away out of the reach of justice , although the honor of a hundred noble families might be saved by my doing so . But I do not see adequate reason for your suspicions ; and I will do my best to help you . "
157091	157105	157106	157106	he	155	" I will thank you when I am better able to do so , "
157112	157129	157106	157106	he	155	" I will thank you in my uncle 's name as well as in my own . "
157130	157146	157148	157149	Dr. Mosgrave	355	" I have only five minutes more , and I have a letter to write , "
157235	157238	157210	157210	He	155	" Monsieur Val ,
157239	157241	157210	157210	He	155	" Villebrumeuse ,
157242	157245	157210	157210	He	155	" Belgium . "
157284	157288	157289	157289	he	155	" That letter , "
157301	157371	157289	157289	he	155	" is written to my friend Monsieur Val , the proprietor and medical superintendent of a very excellent maison de santť in the town of Villebrumeuse . We have known each other for many years , and he will no doubt willingly receive Lady Audley into his establishment , and charge himself with the full responsibility of her future life ; it will not be a very eventful one ! "
157406	157418	157419	157419	he	355	" From the moment in which Lady Audley enters that house , "
157422	157580	157419	157419	he	355	" her life , so far as life is made up of action and variety , will be finished . Whatever secrets she may have will be secrets forever ! Whatever crimes she may have committed she will be able to commit no more . If you were to dig a grave for her in the nearest churchyard and bury her alive in it , you could not more safely shut her from the world and all worldly associations . But as a physiologist and as an honest man , I believe you could do no better service to society than by doing this ; for physiology is a lie if the woman I saw ten minutes ago is a woman to be trusted at large . If she could have sprung at my throat and strangled me with her little hands , as I sat talking to her just now , she would have done it . "
157581	157589	157685	157686	the physician	7019	" She suspected your purpose , then ! "
157590	157642	157643	157644	the physician	7019	" She knew it . ' You think I am mad like my mother , and you have come to question me , ' she said . ' You are watching for some sign of the dreadful taint in my blood . ' Good - day to you , Mr. Audley , "
157648	157670	157643	157644	the physician	7019	" my time was up ten minutes ago ; it is as much as I shall do to catch the train . "
158275	158278	158268	158269	chattering porters	4495	" baggages , "
158541	158550	158551	158551	she	477	" Where are you going to take me ? "
158557	158589	158551	158551	she	477	" I am tired of being treated like some naughty child , who is put into a dark cellar as a punishment for its offenses . Where are you taking me ? "
158590	158609	158610	158610	Robert	155	" To a place in which you will have ample leisure to repent the past , Mrs. Talboys , "
159033	159042	159043	159043	she	4544	" I know where you have brought me , "
159046	159054	159043	159043	she	4544	" This is a MAD - HOUSE . "
159194	159202	159217	159217	she	4557	" Madam finds herself very much fatigued ? "
159227	159229	159231	159231	her	4557	" Madam "
159254	159263	159264	159264	she	4557	" WHAT is this place , Robert Audley ? "
159268	159301	159264	159264	she	4557	" Do you think I am a baby , that you may juggle with and deceive me what is it ? It is what I said just now , is it not ? "
159302	159313	159314	159316	the young man	677	" It is a maison de santť , my lady , "
159321	159334	159314	159316	the young man	677	" I have no wish to juggle with or to deceive you . "
159348	159354	159355	159355	she	477	" A maison de santť , "
159358	159393	159394	159394	she	477	" Yes , they manage these things better in France . In England we should call it a madhouse . This a house for mad people , this , is it not , madam ? "
159413	159421	159422	159423	the woman	968	" Ah , but no , madam , "
159432	159448	159422	159423	the woman	968	" It is an establishment of the most agreeable , where one amuses one 's self "
159590	159593	159567	159567	he	355	" Madam Madam "
160258	160261	160252	160252	she	366	" mad . "
160484	160492	160493	160493	he	155	" Your name is Madam Taylor here , "
160496	160512	160493	160493	he	155	" I do not think you would wish to be known by your real name . "
160535	160547	160549	160550	Monsieur Val	360	" Madam will have an attendant entirely devoted to her service . "
160552	160571	160572	160572	monsieur	4611	" Madam will have all her wishes obeyed ; her reasonable wishes , but that goes without saying , "
160580	160658	160572	160572	monsieur	4611	" Every effort will be made to render madam 's sojourn at Villebrumeuse agreeable . The inmates dine together when it is wished . I dine with the inmates sometimes ; my subordinate , a clever and a worthy man always . I reside with my wife and children in a little pavilion in the grounds ; my subordinate resides in the establishment . Madam may rely upon our utmost efforts being exerted to insure her comfort . "
160709	160722	160723	160723	she	6712	" Leave me alone with the man who has brought me here . "
160731	160735	160723	160723	she	6712	" Leave me ! "
160818	160822	160803	160803	his	4594	" beautiful devil , "
160828	160832	160806	160806	he	4594	" the Mars . "
160874	160886	160887	160887	she	6712	" You have brought me to my grave , Mr. Audley , "
160890	160909	160887	160887	she	6712	" you have used your power basely and cruelly , and have brought me to a living grave . "
160910	160926	160927	160927	Robert	155	" I have done that which I thought just to others and merciful to you , "
160932	161126	160927	160927	Robert	155	" I should have been a traitor to society had I suffered you to remain at liberty after the disappearance of George Talboys and the fire at Castle Inn . I have brought you to a place in which you will be kindly treated by people who have no knowledge of your story no power to taunt or to reproach you . You will lead a quiet and peaceful life , my lady ; such a life as many a good and holy woman in this Catholic country freely takes upon herself , and happily endures until the end . The solitude of your existence in this place will be no greater than that of a king 's daughter , who , flying from the evil of the time , was glad to take shelter in a house as tranquil as this . Surely , it is a small atonement which I ask you to render for your sins , a light penance which I call upon you to perform . Live here and repent ; nobody will assail you , nobody will torment you . I only say to you , repent ! "
161127	161132	161148	161148	her	477	" I can not ! "
161155	161237	161152	161153	Robert Audley	155	" I can not ! Has my beauty brought me to this ? Have I plotted and schemed to shield myself and laid awake in the long deadly nights , trembling to think of my dangers , for this ? I had better have given up at once , since this was to be the end . I had better have yielded to the curse that was upon me , and given up when George Talboys first came back to England . "
161296	161310	161311	161311	she	477	" I would laugh at you and defy you , if I dared , "
161314	161365	161311	161311	she	477	" I would kill myself and defy you , if I dared . But I am a poor , pitiful coward , and have been so from the first . Afraid of my mother 's horrible inheritance ; afraid of poverty ; afraid of George Talboys ; afraid of you . "
161400	161410	161411	161411	she	477	" Do you know what I am thinking of ? "
161416	161451	161411	161411	she	477	" Do you know what I am thinking of , as I look at you in the dim light of this room ? I am thinking of the day upon which George Talboys disappeared . "
161481	161494	161496	161497	my lady	477	" He was standing opposite me , as you are standing now , "
161499	161563	161496	161497	my lady	477	" You said that you would raze the old house to the ground ; that you would root up every tree in the gardens to find your dead friend . You would have had no need to do so much : the body of George Talboys lies at the bottom of the old well , in the shrubbery beyond the lime - walk . "
161583	161589	161590	161590	he	155	" Oh , my God ! "
161598	161628	161590	161590	he	155	" have all the ghastly things that I have thought prepared me so little for the ghastly truth , that it should come upon me like this at last ? "
161629	161640	161656	161656	she	477	" He came to me in the lime - walk , "
161666	162117	161656	161656	she	477	" I knew that he would come , and I had prepared myself , as well as I could , to meet him . I was determined to bribe him , to cajole him , to defy him ; to do anything sooner than abandon the wealth and the position I had won , and go back to my old life . He came , and he reproached me for the conspiracy at Ventnor . He declared that so long as he lived he would never forgive me for the lie that had broken his heart . He told me that I had plucked his heart out of his breast and trampled upon it ; and that he had now no heart in which to feel one sentiment of mercy for me . That he would have forgiven me any wrong upon earth , but that one deliberate and passionless wrong that I had done him . He said this and a great deal more , and he told me that no power on earth should turn him from his purpose , which was to take me to the man I had deceived , and make me tell my wicked story . He did not know the hidden taint that I had sucked in with my mother 's milk . He did not know that it was possible to drive me mad . He goaded me as you have goaded me ; he was as merciless as you have been merciless . We were in the shrubbery at the end of the lime - walk . I was seated upon the broken masonry at the mouth of the well . George Talboys was leaning upon the disused windlass , in which the rusty iron spindle rattled loosely whenever he shifted his position . I rose at last , and turned upon him to defy him , as I had determined to defy him at the worst . I told him that if he denounced me to Sir Michael , I would declare him to be a madman or a liar , and I defied him to convince the man who loved me blindly , as I told him that he had any claim to me . I was going to leave him after having told him this , when he caught me by the wrist and detained me by force . You saw the bruises that his fingers made upon my wrist , and noticed them , and did not believe the account I gave of them . I could see that , Mr. Robert Audley , and I saw that you were a person I should have to fear . "
162142	162152	162153	162153	she	4624	" George Talboys treated me as you treated me , "
162158	162331	162153	162153	she	4624	" He swore that if there was but one witness of my identity , and that witness was removed from Audley Court by the width of the whole earth , he would bring him there to swear to my identity , and to denounce me . It was then that I was mad , it was then that I drew the loose iron spindle from the shrunken wood , and saw my first husband sink with one horrible cry into the black mouth of the well . There is a legend of its enormous depth . I do not know how deep it is . It is dry , I suppose , for I heard no splash , only a dull thud . I looked down and I saw nothing but black emptiness . I knelt down and listened , but the cry was not repeated , though I waited for nearly a quarter of an hour God knows how long it seemed to me ! by the mouth of the well . "
162391	162401	162402	162402	he	155	" Let me pass you , if you please , "
162410	162424	162426	162427	Helen Talboys	192	" You see I do not fear to make my confession to you , "
162429	162512	162426	162427	Helen Talboys	192	" for two reasons . The first is , that you dare not use it against me , because you know it would kill your uncle to see me in a criminal dock ; the second is , that the law could pronounce no worse sentence than this a life - long imprisonment in a mad - house . You see I do not thank you for your mercy , Mr. Robert Audley , for I know exactly what it is worth . "
162716	162723	162724	162724	he	155	" What shall I tell him ? "
162727	162786	162724	162724	he	155	" Shall I tell the truth the horrible , ghastly truth ? No ; that would be too cruel . His generous spirit would sink under the hideous revelation . Yet , in his ignorance of the extent of this wretched woman 's wickedness , he may think , perhaps , that I have been hard with her . "
163017	163021	163022	163022	Robert	155	" My God ! "
163037	163062	163022	163022	Robert	155	" is my friend to rest in this unhallowed burial - place because I have condoned the offenses of the woman who murdered him ? "
163261	163267	163268	163268	he	155	" I will see Alicia , "

163622	163632	163633	163633	he	1073	" What a wretched and unconscionable fool I am ! "
163636	163695	163633	163633	he	1073	" Have I laughed at the follies of weak men all my life , and am I to be more foolish than the weakest of them at last ? The beautiful brown - eyed creature ! Why did I ever see her ? Why did my relentless Nemesis ever point the way to that dreary house in Dorsetshire ? "
163992	164002	164003	164003	he	474	" You will require money , my dear Robert , "
164006	164150	164003	164003	he	474	" for such arrangements as you may think fit to make for the future comfort of the person I committed to your care . I need scarcely tell you that those arrangements can not be too liberal . But perhaps it is as well that I should tell you now , for the first and only time , that it is my earnest wish never again to hear that person 's name . I have no wish to be told the nature of the arrangements you may make for her . I am sure that you will act conscientiously and mercifully . I seek to know no more . Whenever you want money , you will draw upon me for any sums that you may require ; but you will have no occasion to tell me for whose use you want that money . "
164289	164374	164255	164255	he	155	" DEAR MR . AUDLEY The rector of this place has been twice to see Marks , the man you saved in the fire at the Castle Inn . He lies in a very precarious state at his mother 's cottage , near Audley Court , and is not expected to live many days . His wife is attending him , and both he and she have expressed a most earnest desire that you should see him before he dies . Pray come without delay .
164375	164379	164255	164255	he	155	" Yours very sincerely ,
164380	164383	164255	164255	he	155	" CLARA TALBOYS .
164384	164392	164255	164255	he	155	" Mount Stanning Rectory , March 6 . "
164458	164468	164470	164471	the barrister	1039	" What can that man Marks want with me , "
164473	164541	164470	164471	the barrister	1039	" He is afraid to die until he has made confession , perhaps . He wishes to tell me that which I know already the story of my lady 's crime . I knew that he was in the secret . I was sure of it even upon the night on which I first saw him . He knew the secret , and he traded on it . "
164671	164682	164683	164683	he	155	" Better that she should hope vainly to the last , "
164686	164742	164683	164683	he	155	" better that she should go through life seeking the clew to her lost brother 's fate , than that I should give that clew into her hands , and say , ' Our worst fears are realized . The brother you loved has been foully murdered in the early promise of his youth . ' "
165163	165173	165174	165174	Robert	155	" I must give my lost friend decent burial , "
165205	165271	165174	165174	Robert	155	" I must do it ; or I shall die of some panic like this which has seized upon me to - night . I must do it ; at any peril ; at any cost . Even at the price of that revelation which will bring the mad woman back from her safe hiding - place , and place her in a criminal dock . "
165336	165355	165356	165356	Robert	155	" It was Dawson who recommended that the poor creature should be taken to his mother 's cottage , "
165365	165394	165356	165356	Robert	155	" and , I dare say . Dawson has attended him ever since the fire . He 'll be able to tell me the way to the cottage . "
165495	165506	165507	165507	Robert	155	" I am sorry to disturb you , Mr. Dawson , "
165521	165558	165507	165507	Robert	155	" but I have come down to see Marks , who , I hear , is in a very bad way , and I want you to tell me the way to his mother 's cottage . "
165559	165570	165572	165573	the surgeon	517	" I 'll show you the way , Mr. Audley , "
165575	165583	165572	165573	the surgeon	517	" I am going there this minute . "
165584	165593	165507	165507	Robert	155	" The man is very bad , then ? "
165594	165624	165572	165573	the surgeon	517	" So bad that he can be no worse . The change that can happen is that change which will take him beyond the reach of any earthly suffering . "
165625	165628	165630	165630	Robert	155	" Strange ! "
165632	165642	165630	165630	Robert	155	" He did not appear to be much burned . "
165643	165718	165572	165573	the surgeon	517	" He was not much burnt . Had he been , I should never have recommended his being removed from Mount Stanning . It is the shock that has done the business . He has been in a raging fever for the last two days ; but to - night he is much calmer , and I 'm afraid , before to - morrow night , we shall have seen the last of him . "
165719	165731	165733	165734	Mr. Audley	155	" He has asked to see me , I am told , "
165736	165739	165741	165742	the surgeon	517	" Yes , "
165746	165794	165741	165742	the surgeon	517	" A sick man 's fancy , no doubt . You dragged him out of the house , and did your best to save his life . I dare say , rough and boorish as the poor fellow is , he thinks a good deal of that . "
166005	166014	166016	166017	Mr. Dawson	164	" Shall I tell him you are here ? "
166019	166071	166016	166017	Mr. Dawson	164	" Yes , yes , if you please . But be cautious how you tell him , if you think the news likely to agitate him . I am in no hurry . I can wait . You can call me when you think I can safely come up - stairs . "
166411	166429	166430	166430	she	4750	" Let me speak to you for a moment , sir , before you talk to Luke , "
166438	166447	166430	166430	she	4750	" Pray let me speak to you first . "
166448	166460	166462	166463	the invalid	3644	" What 's the gal a - sayin ' , there ? "
166510	166518	166519	166519	he	2898	" What 's she up to there ? "
166522	166584	166519	166519	he	2898	" I wo n't have no plottin ' and no hatchin ' agen me . I want to speak to Mr. Audley my own self ; and whatever I done I 'm goin' to answer for . If I done any mischief , I 'm a - goin' to try and undo it . What 's she a - sayin ' ? "
166585	166597	166599	166601	the old woman	533	" She ai n't a - sayin ' nothin' , lovey , "
166634	166653	166599	166601	the old woman	533	" She 's only a - tellin ' the gentleman how bad you 've been , my pretty . "
166654	166676	166678	166679	Mr. Mark	371	" What I 'm a - goin' to tell I 'm only a - goin' to tell to him , remember , "
166681	166706	166678	166679	Mr. Mark	371	" and ketch me a - tellin ' of it to him if it warn't for what he done for me the other night . "
166707	166715	166717	166719	the old woman	533	" To be sure not , lovey , "
166785	166799	166800	166800	Phoebe	177	" Oh , sir , I wanted to speak to you so badly , "
166805	166826	166800	166800	Phoebe	177	" you know what I told you when I found you safe and well upon the night of the fire ? "
166827	166832	167130	167130	Luke	178	" Yes , yes . "
166833	166846	166800	166800	Phoebe	177	" I told you what I suspected ; what I think still . "
166847	166853	167130	167130	Luke	178	" Yes , I remember . "
166854	167015	166800	166800	Phoebe	177	" But I never breathed a word of it to anybody but you , sir , and I think that Luke has forgotten all about that night ; I think that what went before the fire has gone clean out of his head altogether . He was tipsy , you know , when my la when she came to the Castle ; and I think he was so dazed and scared like by the fire that it all went out of his memory . He does n't suspect what I suspect , at any rate , or he 'd have spoken of it to anybody or everybody ; but he 's dreadful spiteful against my lady , for he says if she 'd have let him have a place at Brentwood or Chelmsford , this would n't have happened . So what I wanted to beg of you , sir , is not to let a word drop before Luke . "
167016	167029	167130	167130	Luke	178	" Yes , yes , I understand ; I will be careful . "
167030	167043	166800	166800	Phoebe	177	" My lady has left the Court , I hear , sir ? "
167044	167047	167130	167130	Luke	178	" Yes . "
167048	167056	166800	166800	Phoebe	177	" Never to come back , sir ? "
167057	167063	167130	167130	Luke	178	" Never to come back . "
167064	167085	166800	166800	Phoebe	177	" But she has not gone where she 'll be cruelly treated ; where she 'll be ill - used ? "
167086	167096	167130	167130	Luke	178	" No : she will be very kindly treated . "
167097	167129	166800	166800	Phoebe	177	" I 'm glad of that , sir ; I beg your pardon for troubling you with the question , sir , but my lady was a kind mistress to me . "
167154	167162	167165	167165	Phoebe	177	" that gal would have done jawing ; "
167184	167190	167192	167193	Mr. Marks	178	" I do n't want you "
167205	167287	167192	167193	Mr. Marks	178	" I do n't want you ; you 've no call to hear what I 've got to say I only want Mr. Audley , and I wants to speak to him all alone , with none o ' your sneakin ' listenin ' at doors , d'ye hear ? so you may go down - stairs and keep there till you 're wanted ; and you may take mother no , mother may stay , I shall want her presently . "
167307	167318	167319	167319	she	563	" I 've no wish to hear anything , Luke , "
167322	167342	167319	167319	she	563	" but I hope you wo n't say anything against those that have been good and generous to you . "
167343	167351	167353	167354	Mr. Marks	178	" I shall say what I like , "
167358	167390	167353	167354	Mr. Marks	178	" and I 'm not a - goin' to be ordered by you . You ai n't the parson , as I 've ever heerd of ; nor the lawyer neither . "
167504	167518	167519	167519	he	1848	" You made game of me in a general way , Mr. Audley , "
167524	167752	167519	167519	he	1848	" and you 've drawed me out , and you 've tumbled and tossed me about like in a gentlemanly way , till I was nothink or anythink in your hands ; and you 've looked me through and through , and turned me inside out till you thought you knowed as much as I knowed . I 'd no particular call to be grateful to you , not before the fire at the Castle t'other night . But I am grateful to you for that . I 'm not grateful to folks in a general way , p'r'aps , because the things as gentlefolks have give have a'most allus been the very things I did n't want . They 've give me soup , and tracks , and flannel , and coals ; but , Lord , they 've made such a precious noise about it that I 'd have been to send 'em all back to 'em . But when a gentleman goes and puts his own life in danger to save a drunken brute like me , the drunkenest brute as ever was feels grateful like to that gentleman , and wishes to say before he dies which he sees in the doctor 's face as he ai n't got long to live ' Thank ye , sir , I 'm obliged to you . "
167804	167813	167814	167814	he	677	" I need no thanks , Luke Marks , "
167817	167829	167814	167814	he	677	" I was very glad to be of service to you . "
167851	167870	167871	167871	he	677	" You was oncommon fond of that gent as disappeared at the Court , warn't you , sir ? "
167886	167903	167905	167905	Luke	178	" You was oncommon fond of that Mr. Talboys , I 've heard say , sir , "
167907	167912	167914	167914	Robert	155	" Yes , yes , "
167919	167927	167914	167914	Robert	155	" he was my very dear friend . "
167928	168010	167914	167914	Robert	155	" I 've heard the servants at the Court say how you took on when you could n't find him . I 've heered the landlord of the Sun Inn say how cut up you was when you first missed him . ' If the two gents had been brothers , ' the landlord said , ' our gent , ' meanin ' you , sir , ' could n't have been more cut up when he missed the other . ' "
168011	168022	168024	168024	Robert	155	" Yes , yes , I know , I know , "
168026	168048	168024	168024	Robert	155	" pray do not speak any more of this subject . I can not tell you how much it distresses me . "
168098	168105	168106	168106	he	155	" Listen to me , Marks , "
168111	168248	168106	168106	he	155	" believe me that I appreciate your grateful words , and that I am very glad to have been of service to you . But before you say anything more , let me make one most solemn request . If you have sent for me that you may tell me anything of the fate of my lost friend , I entreat you to spare yourself and to spare me that horrible story . You can tell me nothing which I do not already know . The worst you can tell me of the woman who was once in your power , has already been revealed to me by her own lips . Pray , then , be silent upon this subject ; I say again , you can tell me nothing which I do not know . "
168283	168295	168296	168296	he	178	" I ca n't tell you nothin' you do n't know ? "
168299	168302	168106	168106	he	155	" Nothing . "
168303	168315	168317	168318	the invalid	3644	" Then it ai n't no good for me to try , "
168322	168328	168329	168329	he	3644	" Did she tell you ? "
168336	168350	168351	168351	Robert	155	" I must beg , Marks , that you will drop the subject , "
168357	168411	168351	168351	Robert	155	" I have already told you that I do not wish to hear it spoken of . Whatever discoveries you made , you made your market out of them . Whatever guilty secrets you got possession of , you were paid for keeping silence . You had better keep silence to the end . "
168412	168416	168418	168419	Luke Marks	178	" Had I ? "
168426	168439	168418	168419	Luke Marks	178	" Had I really now better hold my tongue to the last ? "
168440	168478	168351	168351	Robert	155	" I think so , most decidedly . You traded on your secret , and you were paid to keep it . It would be more honest to hold to your bargain , and keep it still . "
168479	168489	168491	168491	Luke	178	" But , suppose I want to tell something , "
168551	168569	168545	168545	I	0	" He spoke these words between his set teeth , and scowled savagely as he uttered them . "
168657	168657	168646	168646	I	0	"
168658	168670	168672	168672	Robert	155	" Marks , Marks , for Heaven 's sake be calm , "
168676	168692	168672	168672	Robert	155	" What are you talking of ? What is it that you could have told ? "
168693	168703	168705	168705	Luke	178	" I 'm a - goin to tell you , "
168711	168719	168705	168705	Luke	178	" Give us a drink , mother . "
168769	168775	168776	168776	he	4754	" Stop where you are , "
168807	168817	168819	168819	Luke	178	" I 'll ask you another question , mother , "
168821	168868	168819	168819	Luke	178	" and I think it 'll be strange if you ca n't answer it . Do you remember when I was at work upon Atkinson 's farm ; before I was married you know , and when I was livin ' down here along of you ? "
168869	168874	168875	168876	Mrs. Marks	238	" Yes , yes , "
168882	168931	168875	168876	Mrs. Marks	238	" I remember that , my dear . It were last fall , just about as the apples was bein ' gathered in the orchard across our lane , and about the time as you had your new sprigged wesket . I remember , Luke , I remember . "
168968	168983	168985	168985	Luke	178	" If you remember that much , maybe you 'll remember more , mother , "
168987	169014	168985	168985	Luke	178	" Can you call to mind my bringing some one home here one night , while Atkinsons was stackin ' the last o ' their corn ? "
169059	169067	169068	169070	the old woman	533	" I rek'lect your bringing home Phoebe , "
169077	169107	169068	169070	the old woman	533	" I rek'lect your bringin ' Phoebe home to take a cup o ' tea , or a little snack o ' supper , a mort o ' times . "
169108	169112	169114	169115	Mr. Marks	178	" Bother Phoebe , "
169117	169327	169114	169115	Mr. Marks	178	" who 's a talkin ' of Phoebe ? What 's Phoebe , that anybody should go to put theirselves out about her ? Do you remember my bringin ' home a gentleman after ten o'clock , one September night ; a gentleman as was wet through to the skin , and was covered with mud and slush , and green slime and black muck , from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot , and had his arm broke , and his shoulder swelled up awful ; and was such a objeck that nobody would ha ' knowed him ; a gentleman as had to have his clothes cut off him in some places , and as sat by the kitchen fire , starin ' at the coals as if he had gone mad or stupid - like , and did n't know where he was , or who he was ; and as had to be cared for like a baby , and dressed , and dried , and washed , and fed with spoonfuls of brandy , that had to be forced between his locked teeth , before any life could be got into him ? Do you remember that , mother ? "
169379	169383	169384	169384	he	155	" My God ! "
169387	169401	169384	169384	he	155	" I think Thee for Thy wondrous mercies . George Talboys is alive ! "
169402	169407	169409	169410	Mr. Marks	178	" Wait a bit , "
169412	169441	169409	169410	Mr. Marks	178	" do n't you be too fast . Mother , give us down that tin box on the shelf over against the chest of drawers , will you ? "
169516	169530	169531	169531	he	178	" There ai n't no money in it , more 's the pity , "
169534	169595	169531	169531	he	178	" or if there had been it would n't have been let stop very long . But there 's summat in it that perhaps you 'll think quite as valliable as money , and that 's what I 'm goin' to give you as a proof that a drunken brute can feel thankful to them as is kind to him . "
169661	169669	169670	169670	Robert	155	" I do n't know this writing , "
169684	169701	169674	169674	he	155	" What has this to do with my friend ? Why do you show me these ? "
169702	169709	169711	169712	Mr. Marks	178	" Suppose you read 'em first , "
169714	169723	169711	169712	Mr. Marks	178	" and ask me questions about them afterwards . "
169752	169905	169674	169674	he	155	" MY DEAR FRIEND I write to you in such utter confusion of mind as perhaps no man ever before suffered . I can not tell you what has happened to me , I can only tell you that something has happened which will drive me from England a broken - hearted man , to seek some corner of the earth in which I may live and die unknown and forgotten . I can only ask you to forget me . If your friendship could have done me any good , I would have appealed to it . If your counsel could have been any help to me , I would have confided in you . But neither friendship nor counsel can help me ; and all I can say to you is this , God bless you for the past , and teach you to forget me in the future . G.T. "
169926	169997	170045	170046	Luke Marks	178	" HELEN May God pity and forgive you for that which you have done to - day , as truly as I do . Rest in peace . You shall never hear of me again ; to you and to the world I shall henceforth be that which you wished me to be to - day . You need fear no molestation from me . I leave England never to return .
169998	170000	170045	170046	Luke Marks	178	" G.T. "
170059	170068	170069	170069	he	155	" This was not written by George Talboys , "
170072	170076	170078	170079	Luke Marks	178	" It was , "
170081	170122	170078	170079	Luke Marks	178	" it was written by Mr. Talboys , every line of it . He wrote it with his own hand ; but it was his left hand , for he could n't use his right because of his broken arm . "
170140	170144	170145	170145	he	155	" I understand , "
170148	170168	170145	170145	he	155	" I understand . Tell me all ; tell me how it was that my poor friend was saved . "
170169	170183	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" I was at work up at Atkinson 's farm , last September , "
170188	170260	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" helping to stack the last of the corn , and as the nighest way from the farm to mother 's cottage was through the meadows at the back of the Court , I used to come that way , and Phoebe used to stand in the garden wall beyond the lime - walk sometimes , to have a chat with me , knowin ' my time o ' comin ' home .
170261	170422	170145	170145	he	155	" I do n't know what Phoebe was a - doin' upon the evenin ' of the seventh o ' September I rek'lect the date because Farmer Atkinson paid me my wages all of a lump on that day , and I 'd had to sign a bit of a receipt for the money he give me I do n't know what she was a - doin' , but she warn't at the gate agen the lime - walk , so I went round to the other side o ' the gardens and jumped across the dry ditch , for I wanted partic'ler to see her that night , as I was goin' away to work upon a farm beyond Chelmsford the next day . Audley church clock struck nine as I was crossin ' the meadows between Atkinson 's and the Court , and it must have been about a quarter past nine when I got into the kitchen garden .
170423	170712	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" I crossed the garden , and went into the lime - walk ; the nighest way to the servants ' hall took me through the shrubbery and past the dry well . It was a dark night , but I knew my way well enough about the old place , and the light in the window of the servants ' hall looked red and comfortable through the darkness . I was close against the mouth of the dry well when I heard a sound that made my blood creep . It was a groan a groan of a man in pain , as was lyin ' somewhere hid among the bushes . I warn't afraid of ghosts and I warn't afraid of anythink in a general way , but there was somethin in hearin ' this groan as chilled me to the very heart , and for a minute I was struck all of a heap , and did n't know what to do . But I heard the groan again , and then I began to search among the bushes . I found a man lyin ' hidden under a lot o ' laurels , and I thought at first he was up to no good , and I was a - goin' to collar him to take him to the house , when he caught me by the wrist without gettin ' up from the ground , but lookin ' at me very earnest , as I could see by the way his face was turned toward me in the darkness , and asked me who I was , and what I was , and what I had to do with the folks at the Court .
170713	170752	170145	170145	he	155	" There was somethin' in the way he spoke that told me he was a gentleman , though I did n't know him from Adam , and could n't see his face ; and I answered his questions civil .
170753	170816	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" ' I want to get away from this place , ' he said , ' without bein ' seen by any livin ' creetur , remember that . I 've been lyin ' here ever since four o'clock to - day , and I 'm half dead , but I want to get away without bein ' seen , mind that . '
170817	170864	170145	170145	he	155	" I told him that was easy enough , but I began to think my first thoughts of him might have been right enough , after all , and that he could n't have been up to no good to want to sneak away so precious quiet .
170865	170898	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" ' Can you take me to any place where I can get a change of dry clothes , ' he says , ' without half a dozen people knowin ' it ? '
170899	170933	170145	170145	he	155	" He 'd got up into a sittin ' attitude by this time , and I could see that his right arm hung close by his side , and that he was in pain .
170934	171010	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" I pointed to his arm , and asked him what was the matter with it ; but he only answered , very quiet like : ' Broken , my lad , broken . Not that that 's much , ' he says in another tone , speaking to himself like , more than to me . ' There 's broken hearts as well as broken limbs , and they 're not so easy mended . '
171011	171034	170145	170145	he	155	" I told him I could take him to mother 's cottage , and that he could dry his clothes there and welcome .
171035	171047	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" ' Can your mother keep a secret ? ' he asked .
171048	171111	170145	170145	he	155	" ' Well , she could keep one well enough if she could remember it , ' I told him ; ' but you might tell her all the secrets of the Freemasons , and Foresters , and Buffalers and Oddfellers as ever was , to - night : and she 'd have forgotten all about 'em to - morrow mornin ' . '
171112	171164	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" He seemed satisfied with this , and he got himself up by holdin ' on to me , for it seemed as if his limbs was cramped , the use of 'em was almost gone . I felt as he came agen me , that his clothes was wet and mucky .
171165	171187	170145	170145	he	155	" ' You have n't been and fell into the fish - pond , have you , sir ? ' I asked .
171188	171236	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" He made no answer to my question ; he did n't seem even to have heard it . I could see now he was standin ' upon his feet that he was a tall , fine - made man , a head and shoulders higher than me .
171237	171271	170145	170145	he	155	" ' Take me to your mother 's cottage , ' he said , ' and get me some dry clothes if you can ; I 'll pay you well for your trouble . '
171272	171443	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" I knew that the key was mostly left in the wooden gate in the garden wall , so I led him that way . He could scarcely walk at first , and it was only by leanin ' heavily upon my shoulder that he managed to get along . I got him through the gate , leavin ' it unlocked behind me , and trustin ' to the chance of that not bein ' noticed by the under - gardener , who had the care of the key , and was a careless chap enough . I took him across the meadows , and brought him up here , still keepin ' away from the village , and in the fields , where there was n't a creature to see us at that time o ' night ; and so I got him into the room down - stairs , where mother was a - sittin ' over the fire gettin ' my bit o ' supper ready for me .
171444	171660	170145	170145	he	155	" I put the strange chap in a chair agen the fire , and then for the first time I had a good look at him . I never see anybody in such a state before . He was all over green damp and muck , and his hands was scratched and cut to pieces . I got his clothes off him how I could , for he was like a child in my hands , and sat starin ' at the fire as helpless as any baby ; only givin ' a long heavy sigh now and then , as if his heart was a - goin' to bust . At last he dropped into a kind of a doze , a stupid sort of sleep , and began to nod over the fire , so I ran and got a blanket and wrapped him in it , and got him to lie down on the press bedstead in the room under this . I sent mother to bed , and I sat by the fire and watched him , and kep ' the fire up till it was just upon daybreak , when he ' woke up all of a sudden with a start , and said he must go , directly this minute .
171661	171880	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" I begged him not to think of such a thing and told him he warn't fit to move for ever so long ; but he said he must go , and he got up , and though he staggered like , and at first could hardly stand steady two minutes together , he would n't be beat , and he got me to dress him in his clothes as I 'd dried and cleaned as well as I could while he laid asleep . I did manage it at last , but the clothes was awful spoiled , and he looked a dreadful objeck , with his pale face and a great cut on his forehead that I 'd washed and tied up with a handkercher . He could only get his coat on by buttoning it on round his neck , for he could n't put a sleeve upon his broken arm . But he held out agen everything , though he groaned every now and then ; and what with the scratches and bruises on his hands , and the cut upon his forehead , and his stiff limbs and broken arm , he 'd plenty of call to groan ; and by the time it was broad daylight he was dressed and ready to go .
171881	171899	170145	170145	he	155	" ' What 's the nearest town to this upon the London road ? ' he asked me .
171900	171910	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" I told him as the nighest town was Brentwood .
171911	171959	170145	170145	he	155	" ' Very well , then , ' he says , ' if you 'll go with me to Brentwood , and take me to some surgeon as'll set my arm , I 'll give you a five pound note for that and all your other trouble . '
171960	172018	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" I told him that I was ready and willin ' to do anything as he wanted done ; and asked him if I should n't go and see if I could borrow a cart from some of the neighbors to drive him over in , for I told him it was a good six miles ' walk .
172019	172050	170145	170145	he	155	" He shook his head . No , no , no , he said , he did n't want anybody to know anything about him ; he 'd rather walk it .
172051	172233	170185	170186	Luke Marks	178	" He did walk it ; and he walked like a good ' un , too ; though I know as every step he took o ' them six miles he took in pain ; but he held out as he 'd held out before ; I never see such a chap to hold out in all my blessed life . He had to stop sometimes and lean agen a gateway to get his breath ; but he held out still , till at last we got into Brentwood , and then he says , ' Take me to the nighest surgeon 's , ' and I waited while he had his arm set in splints , which took a precious long time . The surgeon wanted him to stay in Brentwood till he was better , but he said it warn't to be heard on , he must get up to London without a minute 's loss of time ; so the surgeon made him as comfortable as he could , considering and tied up his arm in a sling . "
172312	172319	172321	172321	Luke	178	" When his arm was dressed , "
172323	172460	172321	172321	Luke	178	" he says to the surgeon , ' Can you give me a pencil to write something before I go away ? ' The surgeon smiles and shakes his head : ' You 'll never be able to write with that there hand to - day , ' he says , pointin ' to the arm as had just been dressed . ' P'raps not , ' the young chap answers , quiet enough , ' but I can write with the other , ' ' Ca n't I write it for you ? ' says the surgeon . ' No , thank you , ' answers the other ; ' what I 've got to write is private . If you can give me a couple of envelopes , I 'll be obliged to you . '
172461	172672	172949	172949	Luke	178	" With that the surgeon goes to fetch the envelopes , and the young chap takes a pocket - book out of his coat pocket with his left hand ; the cover was wet and dirty , but the inside was clean enough , and he tears out a couple of leaves and begins to write upon 'em as you see ; and he writes dreadful awk'ard with his left hand , and he writes slow , but he contrives to finish what you see , and then he puts the two bits o ' writin ' into the envelopes as the surgeon brings him , and he seals 'em up , and he puts a pencil cross upon one of 'em , and nothing on the other : and then he pays the surgeon for his trouble , and the surgeon says , ai n't there nothin' more he can do for him , and ca n't he persuade him to stay in Brentwood till his arm 's better ; but he says no , no , it ai n't possible ; and then he says to me , ' Come along o ' me to the railway station , and I 'll give you what I 've promised . '
172673	172948	172949	172949	Luke	178	" So I went to the station with him . We was in time to catch the train as stops at Brentwood at half after eight , and we had five minutes to spare . So he takes me into a corner of the platform , and he says , ' I wants you to deliver these here letters for me , ' which I told him I was willin ' . ' Very well , then , ' he says ; ' look here ; you know Audley Court ? ' ' Yes , ' I says , ' I ought to , for my sweetheart lives lady 's maid there . ' ' Whose lady 's maid ? ' he says . So I tells him , ' My lady 's , the new lady what was governess at Mr. Dawson 's . ' ' Very well , then , ' he says ; ' this here letter with the cross upon the envelope is for Lady Audley , but you 're to be sure to give it into her own hands ; and remember to take care as nobody sees you give it . ' I promises to do this , and he hands me the first letter . And then he says , ' Do you know Mr. Audley , as is nevy to Sir Michael ? ' and I said , ' Yes , I 've heerd tell on him , and I 've heerd as he was a reg'lar swell , but affable and free - spoken ' for I heerd 'em tell on you , you know , "
172954	173108	172949	172949	Luke	178	" ' Now look here , ' the young chap says , ' you 're to give this other letter to Mr. Robert Audley , whose a - stayin ' at the Sun Inn , in the village ; ' and I tells him it 's all right , as I 've know'd the Sun ever since I was a baby . So then he gives me the second letter , what 's got nothing wrote upon the envelope , and he gives me a five - pound note , accordin ' to promise ; and then he says , ' Good - day , and thank you for all your trouble,'and he gets into a second - class carriage ; and the last I sees of him is a face as white as a sheet of writin ' paper , and a great patch of stickin'-plaster criss - crossed upon his forehead . "
173109	173116	172949	172949	Luke	178	" Poor George ! poor George ! "
173117	173303	172949	172949	Luke	178	" I went back to Audley , and I went straight to the Sun Inn , and asked for you , meanin ' to deliver both letters faithful , so help me God ! then ; but the landlord told me as you 'd started off that mornin ' for London , and he did n't know when you 'd come back , and he did n't know the name o ' the place where you lived in London , though he said he thought it was in one o ' them law courts , such as Westminster Hall or Doctors ' Commons , or somethin' like that . So what was I to do ? I could n't send a letter by post , not knowin ' where to direct to , and I could n't give it into your own hands , and I 'd been told partickler not to let anybody else know of it ; so I 'd nothing to do but to wait and see if you come back , and bide my time for givin ' of it to you .
173304	173416	172949	172949	Luke	178	" I thought I 'd go over to the Court in the evenin ' and see Phoebe , and find out from her when there 'd be a chance of seein ' her lady , for I know'd she could manage it if she liked . So I did n't go to work that day , though I ought to ha ' done , and I lounged and idled about until it was nigh upon dusk , and then I goes down to the meadows behind the Court , and there I finds Phoebe sure enough , waitin ' agen the wooden door in the wall , on the lookout for me .
173417	173442	172949	172949	Luke	178	" I had n't been talkin ' to her long before I see there was somethink wrong with her and I told her as much .
173443	173476	172949	172949	Luke	178	" Well , ' she says , ' I ai n't quite myself this evenin ' , for I had a upset yesterday , and I ai n't got over it yet . '
173477	173498	172949	172949	Luke	178	" ' A upset , ' I says . ' You had a quarrel with your missus , I suppose . '
173499	173522	172949	172949	Luke	178	" She did n't answer me directly , but she smiled the queerest smile as ever I see , and presently she says :
173523	173607	172949	172949	Luke	178	" No , Luke , it were n't nothin' o ' that kind ; and what 's more , nobody could be friendlier toward me than my lady . I think she 'd do any think for me a'most ; and I think , whether it was a bit o ' farming stock and furniture or such like , or whether it was the good - will of a public - house , she would n't refuse me anythink as I asked her . '
173608	173652	172949	172949	Luke	178	" I could n't make out this , for it was only a few days before as she 'd told me her missus was selfish and extravagant , and we might wait a long time before we could get what we wanted from her .
173653	173709	172949	172949	Luke	178	" So I says to her , ' Why , this is rather sudden like , Phoebe ; ' and she says , ' Yes , it is sudden ; ' and she smiles again , just the same sort of smile as before . Upon that I turns round upon her sharp , and says :
173710	173779	172949	172949	Luke	178	" I 'll tell you what it is , my gal , you 're a - keepin ' somethink from me ; somethink you 've been told , or somethink you 've found out ; and if you think you 're a - goin' to try that game on with me , you 'll find you 're very much mistaken ; and so I give you warnin ' . "
173780	173806	172949	172949	Luke	178	" But she laughed it off like , and says , ' Lor ' Luke , what could have put such fancies into your head ? '
173807	173860	172949	172949	Luke	178	" ' Perhaps other people can keep secrets as well as you , ' I said , ' and perhaps other people can make friends as well as you . There was a gentleman came here to see your missus yesterday , warn't there a tall young gentleman with a brown beard ? '
173861	173905	172949	172949	Luke	178	" Instead of answering of me like a Christian , my Cousin Phoebe bursts out a - cryin ' , and wrings her hands , and goes on awful , until I 'm dashed if I can make out what she 's up to .
173906	174004	172949	172949	Luke	178	" But little by little I got it out of her , for I would n't stand no nonsense ; find she told me how she 'd been sittin ' at work at the window of her little room , which was at the top of the house , right up in one of the gables , and overlooked the lime - walk , and the shrubbery and the well , when she see my lady walking with a strange gentleman , and they walked together for a long time , until by - and - by they "
174005	174008	174010	174010	Robert	155	" Stop ! "
174012	174018	174010	174010	Robert	155	" I know the rest . "
174019	174089	172949	172949	Luke	178	" Well , Phoebe told me all about what she see , and she told me she 'd met her lady almost directly afterward , and somethin' had passed between 'em , not much , but enough to let her missus know that the servant what she looked down upon had found out that as would put her in that servant 's power to the last day of her life .
174090	174123	174010	174010	Robert	155	" ' And she is in my power , Luke , ' says Phoebe ; ' and she 'll do anythin ' in the world for us if we keep her secret . '
174124	174200	172949	172949	Luke	178	" So you see both my Lady Audley and her maid thought as the gentleman as I 'd seen safe off by the London train was lying dead at the bottom of the well . If I was to give the letter they 'd find out the contrary of this ; and if I was to give the letter , Phoebe and me would lose the chance of gettin ' started in life by her missus .
174201	174253	174010	174010	Robert	155	" So I kep ' the letter and kep ' my secret , and my lady kep ' hern . But I thought if she acted liberal by me , and gave me the money I wanted , free like , I 'd tell her everythink , and make her mind easy .
174254	174397	172949	172949	Luke	178	" But she did n't . Whatever she give me she throwed me as if I 'd been a dog . Whenever she spoke to me , she spoke as she might have spoken to a dog ; and a dog she could n't abide the sight of . There was no word in her mouth that was too bad for me ; there was no toss as she could give her head that was too proud and scornful for me ; and my blood b'iled agen her , and I kep ' my secret , and let her keep hern . I opened the two letters , and I read 'em , but I could n't make much sense out of 'em , and I hid 'em away ; and not a creature but me has seen 'em until this night . "
174573	174584	174567	174568	Clara Talboys	272	" Your brother still lives , and has been found . "
174681	174689	174690	174691	the man	644	" He went off rather sudden like , "
174694	174699	174690	174691	the man	644	" but very quiet . "
174762	174786	174787	174787	he	155	" It may be some comfort to her to hear that her husband did not perish in his youth by her wicked hand , "
174790	174806	174787	174787	he	155	" if her selfish soul can hold any sentiment of pity or sorrow for others . "
175316	175329	175330	175330	he	155	" It is not for me to blame you , Mr. Audley , "
175333	175385	175330	175330	he	155	" for having smuggled this guilty woman out of the reach of justice , and thus , as I may say , paltered with the laws of your country . I can only remark that , had the lady fallen into my hands , she would have been very differently treated . "
175961	175988	175989	175989	he	155	" Do you think I can read French novels and smoke mild Turkish until I am three - score - and - ten , Miss Talboys ? "
175992	176039	175989	175989	he	155	" Do you think there will not come a day in which my meerschaums will be foul , and the French novels more than usually stupid , and life altogether such a dismal monotony that I shall want to get rid of it somehow or other ? "
176229	176236	176237	176237	he	155	" I 'd do all that , "
176240	176304	176237	176237	he	155	" and do it earnestly , if I could be sure of a reward for my labor . If she would accept my reputation when it was won , and support me in the struggle by her beloved companionship . But what if she sends me away to fight the battle , and marries some hulking country squire while my back is turned ? "
176452	176464	176465	176465	he	168	" We have got on very well together , Mr. Audley , "
176468	176518	176465	176465	he	168	" and you have been pleased to appear sufficiently happy in the quiet routine of our orderly household ; nay , more , you have conformed to our little domestic regulations in a manner which I can not refrain from saying I take as an especial compliment to myself . "
176560	176573	176574	176575	Mr. Talboys	168	" I trust as we have got on so remarkably well together , "
176578	176629	176574	176575	Mr. Talboys	168	" you will do me the honor of repeating your visit to Dorsetshire whenever you feel inclined . You will find plenty of sport among my farms , and you will meet with every politeness and attention from my tenants , if you like to bring your gun with you . "
177029	177047	177048	177048	she	272	" I can not think how papa can be so resigned to my poor brother 's absence , "
177051	177120	177121	177121	she	272	" for he does love him , Mr. Audley ; even you must have seen lately that he does love him . But I can not think how he can so quietly submit to his absence . If I were a man , I would go to Australia , and find him , and bring him back ; if he was still to be found among the living , "
177173	177183	177184	177184	he	155	" Shall I go to look for your brother ? "
177187	177190	177191	177191	She	272	" You ! "
177205	177233	177193	177193	her	272	" You , Mr. Audley ! Do you think that I could ask you to make such a sacrifice for me , or for those I love ? "
177234	177348	177362	177362	him	4871	" And do you think , Clara , that I should think any sacrifice too great a one if it were made for you ? Do you think there is any voyage I would refuse to take , if I knew that you would welcome me when I came home , and thank me for having served you faithfully ? I will go from one end of the continent of Australia to the other to look for your brother , if you please , Clara ; and will never return alive unless I bring him with me , and will take my chance of what reward you shall give me for my labor . "
177364	177375	177376	177376	she	4870	" You are very good and generous , Mr. Audley , "
177382	177418	177376	177376	she	4870	" and I feel this offer too much to be able to thank you for it . But what you speak of could never be . By what right could I accept such a sacrifice ? "
177419	177450	177452	177453	Mr. Audley	155	" By the right which makes me your bounden slave forever and ever , whether you will or no . By right of the love I bear you , Clara , "
177491	177498	177499	177499	he	155	" I love you , Clara , "
177502	177555	177499	177499	he	155	" I love you . You may call for your father , and have me turned out of the house this moment , if you like ; but I shall go on loving you all the same ; and I shall love you forever and ever , whether you will or no . "
177588	177593	177594	177594	he	155	" Clara , Clara ! "
177616	177616	177594	177594	he	155	"
177659	177692	177693	177695	Mr. Harcourt Talboys	256	" Shall we both go , dearest ? Shall we go as man and wife ? Shall we go together , my dear love , and bring our brother back between us ? "
177919	177929	177935	177935	she	1556	" There 's lots of letters , yer honor , "
177953	177999	177935	177935	she	1556	" and there 's some parcels , and there 's a gentleman which has called ever so many times , and is waitin ' to - night , for I towld him you 'd written to me to say your rooms were to be aired . "
178194	178502	178165	178165	he	168	" God knows that from the moment in which I sunk into the black pit , knowing the treacherous hand that had sent me to what might have been my death , my chief thought was of the safety of the woman who had betrayed me . I fell upon my feet upon a mass of slush and mire , but my shoulder was bruised , and my arm broken against the side of the well . I was stunned and dazed for a few minutes , but I roused myself by an effort , for I felt that the atmosphere I breathed was deadly . I had my Australian experiences to help me in my peril ; I could climb like a cat . The stones of which the well was built were rugged and irregular , and I was able to work my way upward by planting my feet in the interstices of the stones , and resting my back at times against the opposite side of the well , helping myself as well as I could with my hands , though one arm was crippled . It was hard work , Bob , and it seems strange that a man who had long professed himself weary of his life , should take so much trouble to preserve it . I think I must have been working upward of half an hour before I got to the top ; I know the time seemed an eternity of pain and peril . It was impossible for me to leave the place until after dark without being observed , so I hid myself behind a clump of laurel - bushes , and lay down on the grass faint and exhausted to wait for nightfall . The man who found me there told you the rest . Robert . "
178503	178518	178519	178519	George	168	" Yes , my poor old friend . yes , he told me all . "
178587	178597	178598	178598	he	4901	" Jonathan was very kind to me , Bob , "
178601	178704	178598	178598	he	4901	" I had enough money to enable me to get on pretty well in my own quiet way and I meant to have started for the California gold fields to get more when that was gone . I might have made plenty of friends had I pleased , but I carried the old bullet in my breast ; and what sympathy could I have with men who knew nothing of my grief ? I yearned for the strong grasp of your hand , Bob ; the friendly touch of the hand which had guided me through the darkest passage of my life . "
179567	179579	179549	179549	he	4970	" the righteous forsaken , nor his seed begging their bread . "
