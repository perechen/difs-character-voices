95	105	107	112	a man in a frieze overcoat	493	" That Cheyne boy 's the biggest nuisance aboard , "
121	133	107	112	a man in a frieze overcoat	493	" He is n't wanted here . He 's too fresh . "
149	176	134	138	A white - haired German	494	" I know der breed . Ameriga is full of dot kind . I dell you you should imbort ropes ' ends free under your dariff . "
177	198	199	203	a man from New York	495	" Pshaw ! There is n't any real harm to him . He 's more to be pitied than anything , "
220	271	207	207	he	495	" They 've dragged him around from hotel to hotel ever since he was a kid . I was talking to his mother this morning . She 's a lovely lady , but she do n't pretend to manage him . He 's going to Europe to finish his education . "
272	279	282	283	a Philadelphian	496	" Education is n't begun yet . "
291	313	207	207	he	495	" That boy gets two hundred a month pocket - money , he told me . He is n't sixteen either . "
314	323	325	326	the German	497	" Railroads , his father , aind't it ? "
328	378	325	326	the German	497	" Yep . That and mines and lumber and shipping . Built one place at San Diego , the old man has ; another at Los Angeles ; owns half a dozen railroads , half the lumber on the Pacific slope , and lets his wife spend the money , "
385	462	379	380	the Philadelphian	498	" The West do n't suit her , she says . She just tracks around with the boy and her nerves , trying to find out what 'll amuse him , I guess . Florida , Adirondacks , Lakewood , Hot Springs , New York , and round again . He is n't much more than a second - hand hotel clerk now . When he 's finished in Europe he 'll be a holy terror . "
463	477	479	484	a voice from the frieze ulster	499	" What 's the matter with the old man attending to him personally ? "
486	538	479	484	a voice from the frieze ulster	499	" Old man 's piling up the rocks . ' Do n't want to be disturbed , I guess . He 'll find out his error a few years from now . ' Pity , because there 's a heap of good in the boy if you could get at it . "
539	552	554	555	the German	497	" Mit a rope 's end ; mit a rope 's end ! "
679	712	670	670	he	501	" Say , it 's thick outside . You can hear the fish - boats squawking all around us . Say , would n't it be great if we ran down one ? "
713	720	722	724	the New Yorker	251	" Shut the door , Harvey , "
726	740	722	724	the New Yorker	251	" Shut the door and stay outside . You 're not wanted here . "
741	747	748	748	he	501	" Who 'll stop me ? "
753	777	748	748	he	501	" Did you pay for my passage , Mister Martin ? ' Guess I 've as good right here as the next man . "
795	816	778	778	He	501	" Say , gen'elmen , this is deader'n mud . Ca n't we make a game of poker between us ? "
856	864	865	866	a man	504	" How 's your mamma this afternoon ? "
869	878	865	866	a man	504	" I did n't see her at lunch . "
879	952	843	843	he	501	" In her state - room , I guess . She 's ' most always sick on the ocean . I 'm going to give the stewardess fifteen dollars for looking after her . I do n't go down more ' n I can avoid . It makes me feel mysterious to pass that butler's - pantry place . Say , this is the first time I 've been on the ocean . "
953	962	843	843	he	501	" Oh , do n't apologize , Harvey . "
963	1001	1002	1002	He	505	" Who 's apologizing ? This is the first time I 've crossed the ocean , gen'elmen , and , except the first day , I have n't been sick one little bit . No , sir ! "
1023	1041	1042	1043	the Philadelphian	498	" Oh , you 're a high - grade machine , with the writing in plain sight , "
1046	1063	1042	1043	the Philadelphian	498	" You 'll blossom into a credit to your country if you do n't take care . "
1064	1120	1121	1123	The chief engineer	507	" I know it . I 'm an American - first , last , and all the time . I 'll show 'em that when I strike Europe . Piff ! My cig 's out . I ca n't smoke the truck the steward sells . Any gen'elman got a real Turkish cig on him ? "
1136	1141	1143	1143	Harvey	250	" Say , Mac , "
1146	1153	1143	1143	Harvey	250	" how are we hitting it ? "
1154	1162	1121	1123	The chief engineer	507	" Vara much in the ordinary way , "
1168	1192	1121	1123	The chief engineer	507	" The young are as polite as ever to their elders , an ' their elders are e'en tryin ' to appreciate it . "
1217	1230	1231	1231	he	497	" Dot is der broper apparatus to smoke , my young friendt , "
1234	1250	1231	1231	he	497	" You vill dry it ? Yes ? Den you vill be efer so happy . "
1271	1284	1285	1285	he	250	" It would take more ' n this to keel me over , "
1303	1310	1312	1313	the German	497	" Dot we shall bresently see , "
1315	1325	1312	1313	the German	497	" Where are we now , Mr. Mactonal ' ? "
1326	1335	1337	1338	the engineer	511	" Just there or thereabouts , Mr. Schaefer , "
1340	1401	1337	1338	the engineer	511	" We 'll be on the Grand Bank to - night ; but in a general way o ' speakin ' , we 're all among the fishing - fleet now . We 've shaved three dories an ' near scalped the boom off a Frenchman since noon , an ' that 's close sailing ' , ye may say . "
1402	1410	1411	1412	the German	497	" You like my cigar , eh ? "
1424	1430	1431	1431	he	250	" Fine , full flavor , "
1437	1461	1431	1431	he	250	" Guess we 've slowed down a little , have n't we ? I 'll skip out and see what the log says . "
1462	1470	1472	1473	the German	258	" I might if I vhas you , "
1576	1831	1958	1958	I	0	" joined with the surge and jar of the screw to sieve out his soul . His head swelled ; sparks of fire danced before his eyes ; his body seemed to lose weight , while his heels wavered in the breeze . He was fainting from seasickness , and a roll of the ship tilted him over the rail on to the smooth lip of the turtle - back . Then a low , gray mother - wave swung out of the fog , tucked Harvey under one arm , so to speak , and pulled him off and away to leeward ; the great green closed over him , and he went quietly to sleep . He was roused by the sound of a dinner - horn such as they used to blow at a summer - school he had once attended in the Adirondacks . Slowly he remembered that he was Harvey Cheyne , drowned and dead in mid - ocean , but was too weak to fit things together . A new smell filled his nostrils ; wet and clammy chills ran down his back , and he was helplessly full of salt water . When he opened his eyes , he perceived that he was still on the top of the sea , for it was running round him in silver - coloured hills , and he was lying on a pile of half - dead fish , looking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey . "
1837	1842	1958	1958	I	0	" thought the boy . "
1857	1882	1976	1976	I	0	" He groaned , and the figure turned its head , showing a pair of little gold rings half hidden in curly black hair . "
1892	1896	1976	1976	I	0	" it said . "
1905	1953	1976	1976	I	0	" With a swift jerk he sculled the flickering boat - head on to a foamless sea that lifted her twenty full feet , only to slide her into a glassy pit beyond . But this mountain - climbing did not interrupt blue - jersey 's talk . "
1992	1993	1994	1994	I	0	" "
1998	2011	1994	1994	I	0	" said Harvey ; ' sick , and could n't help it . "
2012	2079	1976	1976	I	0	" Just in time I blow my horn , and your boat she yaw a little . Then I see you come all down . Eh , wha - at ? I think you are cut into baits by the screw , but you dreeft - dreeft to me , and I make a big fish of you . So you shall not die this time . "
2080	2085	2087	2087	Harvey	250	" Where am I ? "
2102	2148	2087	2087	Harvey	250	" You are with me in the dory - Manuel my name , and I come from schooner ' We 're Here ' of Gloucester . I live to Gloucester . By - and - by we get supper . Eh , wha - at ? "
2621	2626	2628	2629	the boy	1817	" Feelin ' better ? "
2635	2640	2641	2641	He	1817	" Hev some coffee ? "
2653	2659	2661	2661	Harvey	250	" Is n't there milk ? "
2681	2686	2688	2689	the boy	1817	" Well , no , "
2691	2715	2688	2689	the boy	1817	" Ner there ai n't likely to be till ' baout mid - September . ' Tain't bad coffee . I made it . "
2741	2754	2756	2757	the boy	1817	" I 've dried your clothes . Guess they 've shrunk some , "
2759	2782	2756	2757	the boy	1817	" They ai n't our style much - none of 'em . Twist round an ' see if you 're hurt any . "
2797	2802	2803	2804	the boy	1817	" That 's good , "
2808	2900	2803	2804	the boy	1817	" Fix yerself an ' go on deck . Dad wants to see you . I 'm his son , - Dan , they call me , - an ' I 'm cook 's helper an ' everything else aboard that 's too dirty for the men . There ai n't no boy here ' cep ' me sence Otto went overboard - an ' he was only a Dutchy , an ' twenty year old at that . How 'd you come to fall off in a dead flat ca'am ? "
2901	2907	2909	2909	Harvey	250	" ' Twasn't a calm , "
2913	2933	2909	2909	Harvey	250	" It was a gale , and I was seasick . Guess I must have rolled over the rail . "
2934	2947	2949	2950	the boy	1817	" There was a little common swell yes'day an ' last night , "
2952	2964	2965	2965	He	250	" But ef thet 's your notion of a gale - - "
2968	2986	2965	2965	He	250	" You 'll know more ' fore you 're through . Hurry ! Dad 's waitin ' . "
3080	3114	3115	3115	Dan	260	" Your dad can come down here if he 's so anxious to talk to me . I want him to take me to New York right away . It 'll pay him . "
3131	3136	3137	3137	he	260	" Say , Dad ! "
3144	3167	3137	3137	he	260	" he says you kin slip down an ' see him ef you 're anxious that way . ' Hear , Dad ? "
3185	3198	3199	3199	Dan	260	" Quit foolin ' , Dan , and send him to me . "
3387	3389	3390	3390	they	555	" house "
3398	3421	3390	3390	they	555	" Mornin ' - Good afternoon , I should say . You 've nigh slep ' the clock round , young feller , "
3426	3430	3432	3432	Harvey	250	" Mornin ' , "
3440	3443	3434	3434	He	250	" young feller "
3475	3523	3524	3524	Harvey	250	" Naow let 's hear all abaout it . It 's quite providential , first an ' last , fer all concerned . What might be your name ? Where from we mistrust it 's Noo York , an ' where baound we mistrust it 's Europe ? "
3569	3572	3574	3576	the shaven man	563	" H'm , "
3588	3630	3574	3576	the shaven man	563	" I ca n't say we think special of any man , or boy even , that falls overboard from that kind o ' packet in a flat ca'am . Least of all when his excuse is that he 's seasick . "
3631	3634	3636	3636	Harvey	250	" Excuse ! "
3638	3653	3636	3636	Harvey	250	" D'you suppose I 'd fall overboard into your dirty little boat for fun ? "
3654	3754	3574	3576	the shaven man	563	" Not knowin ' what your notions o ' fun may be , I ca n't rightly say , young feller . But if I was you , I would n't call the boat which , under Providence , was the means o ' savin ' ye , names . In the first place , it 's blame irreligious . In the second , it 's annoyin ' to my feelin 's - an ' I 'm Disko Troop o ' the ' We 're Here ' o ' Gloucester , which you do n't seem rightly to know . "
3755	3766	3768	3768	Harvey	250	" I do n't know and I do n't care , "
3770	3808	3768	3768	Harvey	250	" I 'm grateful enough for being saved and all that , of course ! but I want you to understand that the sooner you take me back to New York the better it 'll pay you . "
3809	3815	3816	3816	Troop	263	" Meanin ' - haow ? "
3828	3833	3835	3835	Harvey	250	" Dollars and cents , "
3847	3853	3854	3854	He	250	" Cold dollars and cents . "
3878	3908	3872	3872	his	250	" You 've done the best day 's work you ever did in your life when you pulled me in . I 'm all the son Harvey Cheyne has . "
3909	3915	3917	3917	Disko	263	" He 's bin favoured , "
3921	3952	3917	3917	Disko	263	" And if you do n't know who Harvey Cheyne is , you do n't know much - that 's all . Now turn her around and let 's hurry . "
3975	4005	4006	4006	Harvey	250	" Mebbe I do , an ' mebbe I do n't . Take a reef in your stummick , young feller . It 's full o ' my vittles . "
4032	4040	4041	4041	he	260	" We 'll pay for that too , "
4044	4056	4041	4041	he	260	" When do you suppose we shall get to New York ? "
4057	4111	4011	4011	Dan	260	" I do n't use Noo York any . Ner Boston . We may see Eastern Point about September ; an ' your pa - I 'm real sorry I hain't heerd tell of him - may give me ten dollars efter all your talk . Then o ' course he may n't . "
4112	4123	4124	4124	Harvey	250	" Ten dollars ! Why , see here , I - "
4146	4169	4136	4136	he	250	" Not lawful currency ; an ' bad for the lungs . Heave 'em overboard , young feller , and try agin . "
4170	4176	4178	4178	Harvey	250	" It 's been stolen ! "
4182	4199	4178	4178	Harvey	250	" You 'll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me , then ? "
4200	4212	4214	4214	Harvey	250	" A hundred and thirty - four dollars - all stolen , "
4222	4227	4214	4214	Harvey	250	" Give them back . "
4239	4265	4214	4214	Harvey	250	" What might you have been doin' at your time o ' life with one hundred an ' thirty - four dollars , young feller ? "
4266	4280	4178	4178	Harvey	250	" It was part of my pocket - money - for a month . "
4298	4354	4356	4356	Troop	260	" Oh ! One hundred and thirty - four dollars is only part of his pocket - money - for one month only ! You do n't remember hittin ' anything when you fell over , do you ? Crack agin a stanchion , le 's say . Old man Hasken o ' the East Wind "
4364	4396	4356	4356	Troop	260	" he tripped on a hatch an ' butted the mainmast with his head - hardish . ' Baout three weeks afterwards , old man Hasken he would hev it that the "
4399	4475	4476	4476	Harvey	250	" was a commerce - destroyin ' man - o'-war , an ' so he declared war on Sable Island because it was Bridish , an ' the shoals run aout too far . They sewed him up in a bed - bag , his head an ' feet appearin ' , fer the rest o ' the trip , an ' now he 's to home in Essex playin ' with little rag dolls . "
4487	4519	4482	4482	Troop	260	" We 're sorry fer you . We 're very sorry fer you - an ' so young . We wo n't say no more abaout the money , I guess . "
4520	4531	4362	4362	himself	260	" ' Course you wo n't . You stole it . "
4532	4634	4362	4362	himself	260	" Suit yourself . We stole it ef it 's any comfort to you . Naow , abaout goin' back . Allowin ' we could do it , which we ca n't , you ai n't in no fit state to go back to your home , an ' we 've jest come on to the Banks , workin ' fer our bread . We do n't see the ha'af of a hundred dollars a month , let alone pocket - money ; an ' with good luck we 'll be ashore again somewheres abaout the first weeks o ' September . "
4635	4667	4482	4482	Troop	260	" But - but it 's May now , and I ca n't stay here doin' nothing just because you want to fish . I ca n't , I tell you ! "
4668	4760	4362	4362	himself	260	" Right an ' jest ; jest an ' right . No one asks you to do nothin' . There 's a heap as you can do , for Otto he went overboard on Le Have . I mistrust he lost his grip in a gale we f'und there . Anyways , he never come back to deny it . You 've turned up , plain , plumb providential for all concerned . I mistrust , though , there 's ruther few things you kin do . Ai n't thet so ? "
4761	4777	4779	4779	Harvey	250	" I can make it lively for you and your crowd when we get ashore , "
4790	4793	4779	4779	Harvey	250	" piracy , "
4804	4920	4796	4796	Troop	260	" Excep ' talk . I 'd forgot that . You ai n't asked to talk more'n you 've a mind to aboard the ' We 're Here ' . Keep your eyes open , an ' help Dan to do ez he 's bid , an ' sechlike , an ' I 'll give you - you ai n't wuth it , but I 'll give - ten an ' a ha'af a month ; say thirty - five at the end o ' the trip . A little work will ease up your head , and you kin tell us all abaout your dad an ' your ma an ' your money afterwards . "
4921	4928	4930	4930	Harvey	250	" She 's on the steamer , "
4938	4947	4930	4930	Harvey	250	" Take me to New York at once . "
4948	5016	4796	4796	Troop	260	" Poor woman - poor woman ! When she has you back she 'll forgit it all , though . There 's eight of us on the ' We 're Here ' , an ' ef we went back naow - it 's more'n a thousand mile - we 'd lose the season . The men they would n't hev it , allowin ' I was agreeable . "
5017	5027	4796	4796	Troop	260	" But my father would make it all right . "
5028	5041	5043	5043	Troop	260	" He 'd try . I do n't doubt he 'd try , "
5045	5113	5043	5043	Troop	260	" but a whole season 's catch is eight men 's bread ; an ' you 'll be better in your health when you see him in the fall . Go forward an ' help Dan . It 's ten an ' a ha'af a month , e I said , an ' o ' course , all f'und , same e the rest o ' us . "
5114	5128	5130	5130	Harvey	250	" Do you mean I 'm to clean pots and pans and things ? "
5132	5148	5130	5130	Harvey	250	" An ' other things . You 've no call to shout , young feller . "
5149	5168	5170	5170	Harvey	250	" I wo n't ! My father will give you enough to buy this dirty little fish - kettle "
5176	5206	5170	5170	Harvey	250	" ten times over , if you take me to New York safe ; and - and - you 're in a hundred and thirty by me , anyhow . "
5207	5210	5212	5212	Troop	260	" Haow ? "
5219	5242	5212	5212	Troop	260	" How ? You know how , well enough . On top of all that , you want me to do menial work "
5252	5267	5268	5268	Troop	260	" till the Fall . I tell you I will not . You hear ? "
5290	5293	5294	5294	he	260	" Hsh ! "
5299	5320	5294	5294	he	260	" I 'm figurin ' out my responsibilities in my own mind . It 's a matter o ' jedgment . "
5331	5343	5344	5344	he	260	" Do n't go to tamperin ' with Dad any more , "
5347	5374	5344	5344	he	260	" You 've called him a thief two or three times over , an ' he do n't take that from any livin ' bein ' . "
5375	5380	5381	5381	Harvey	250	" I wo n't ! "
5394	5399	5400	5400	he	260	" Seems kinder unneighbourly , "
5412	5486	5400	5400	he	260	" I - do n't blame you , not a mite , young feeler , nor you wo n't blame me when the bile 's out o ' your systim . Be sure you sense what I say ? Ten an ' a ha'af fer second boy on the schooner - an ' all found - fer to teach you an ' fer the sake o ' your health . Yes or no ? "
5487	5490	5492	5492	Harvey	250	" No ! "
5494	5507	5492	5492	Harvey	250	" Take me back to New York or I 'll see you - "
5538	5541	5542	5542	he	250	" Dan , "
5548	5662	5542	5542	he	250	" I was sot agin this young feeler when I first saw him on account o ' hasty jedgments . Never you be led astray by hasty jedgments , Dan . Naow I 'm sorry for him , because he 's clear distracted in his upper works . He ai n't responsible fer the names he 's give me , nor fer his other statements - nor fer jumpin ' overboard , which I 'm abaout ha'af convinced he did . You be gentle with him , Dan , ' r I 'll give you twice what I 've give him . Them hemmeridges clears the head . Let him sluice it off ! "
5692	5697	5699	5699	Dan	260	" I warned ye , "
5715	5739	5699	5699	Dan	260	" Dad ai n't noways hasty , but you fair earned it . Pshaw ! there 's no sense takin ' on so . "
5753	5788	5699	5699	Dan	260	" I know the feelin ' . First time Dad laid me out was the last - and that was my first trip . Makes ye feel sickish an ' lonesome . I know . "
5789	5793	5795	5795	Harvey	250	" It does , "
5797	5815	5795	5795	Harvey	250	" That man 's either crazy or drunk , and - and I ca n't do anything . "
5816	5824	5826	5826	Dan	260	" Do n't say that to Dad , "
5828	5864	5826	5826	Dan	260	" He 's set agin all liquor , an ' - well , he told me you was the madman . What in creation made you call him a thief ? He 's my dad . "
5884	5890	5891	5891	he	250	" I 'm not crazy , "
5895	5930	5891	5891	he	250	" Only - your father has never seen more than a five - dollar bill at a time , and my father could buy up this boat once a week and never miss it . "
5931	5976	5826	5826	Dan	260	" You do n't know what the ' We 're Here 's ' worth . Your dad must hev a pile o ' money . How did he git it ? Dad sez loonies ca n't shake out a straight yarn . Go ahead . "
5977	5986	5891	5891	he	250	" In gold mines and things , West . "
5987	6043	5891	5891	he	250	" I 've read o ' that kind o ' business . Out West , too ? Does he go around with a pistol on a trick - pony , same ez the circus ? They call that the Wild West , and I 've heard that their spurs an ' bridles was solid silver . "
6044	6050	6052	6052	Harvey	250	" You are a chump ! "
6060	6080	6052	6052	Harvey	250	" My father has n't any use for ponies . When he wants to ride he takes his car . "
6081	6088	5891	5891	he	250	" Haow ? Lobster - car ? "
6089	6112	5891	5891	he	250	" No . His own private car , of course . You 've seen a private car some time in your life ? "
6113	6120	6122	6122	Dan	260	" Slatin Beeman he hez one , "
6126	6145	6147	6147	Dan	260	" I saw her at the Union Depot in Boston , with three niggers hoggin ' her run . "
6153	6230	6147	6147	Dan	260	" But Slatin Beeman he owns ' baout every railroad on Long Island , they say , an ' they say he 's bought ' baout ha'af Noo Hampshire an ' run a line fence around her , an ' filled her up with lions an ' tigers an ' bears an ' buffalo an ' crocodiles an ' such all . Slatin Beeman he 's a millionaire . I 've seen his car . Yes ? "
6231	6274	5891	5891	he	250	" Well , my father 's what they call a multi - millionaire , and he has two private cars . One 's named for me , the ' Harvey ' , and one for my mother , the ' Constance ' . "
6275	6279	6281	6281	Dan	260	" Hold on , "
6283	6319	6281	6281	Dan	260	" Dad do n't ever let me swear , but I guess you can . ' Fore we go ahead , I want you to say hope you may die if you 're lyin ' . "
6320	6324	6326	6326	Harvey	250	" Of course , "
6328	6350	6326	6326	Harvey	250	" The ai n't ' niff . Say , ' Hope I may die if I ai n't speaking ' truth . "
6352	6360	6362	6362	Harvey	250	" Hope I may die right here , "
6364	6377	6362	6362	Harvey	250	" if every word I 've spoken is n't the cold truth . "
6378	6390	6392	6392	Dan	260	" Hundred an ' thirty - four dollars an ' all ? "
6394	6418	6392	6392	Dan	260	" I heard ye talkin ' to Dad , an ' I ha'af looked you 'd be swallered up , same 's Jonah . "
6491	6494	6496	6496	Dan	260	" Gosh ! "
6531	6549	6527	6527	his	250	" I believe you , Harvey . Dad 's made a mistake fer once in his life . "
6550	6556	6558	6558	Harvey	250	" He has , sure , "
6567	6585	6558	6558	Harvey	250	" He 'll be mad clear through . Dad jest hates to be mistook in his jedgments . "
6594	6610	6586	6586	Dan	260	" Oh , Harvey , do n't you spile the catch by lettin ' on . "
6611	6631	6527	6527	his	250	" I do n't want to be knocked down again . I 'll get even with him , though . "
6632	6671	6586	6586	Dan	260	" Never heard any man ever got even with dad . But he 'd knock ye down again sure . The more he was mistook the more he 'd do it . But gold - mines and pistols - "
6672	6681	6682	6682	Harvey	250	" I never said a word about pistols , "
6693	6758	6759	6759	He	250	" Thet 's so ; no more you did . Two private cars , then , one named fer you an ' one fer her ; an ' two hundred dollars a month pocket - money , all knocked into the scuppers fer not workin ' fer ten an ' a ha'af a month ! It 's the top haul o ' the season . "
6765	6771	6773	6773	Harvey	250	" Then I was right ? "
6783	6880	6777	6777	he	250	" You was wrong ; the wrongest kind o ' wrong ! You take right hold an ' pitch in ' longside o ' me , or you 'll catch it , an ' I 'll catch it fer backin ' you up . Dad always gives me double helps 'cause I 'm his son , an ' he hates favourin ' folk . ' Guess you 're kinder mad at dad . I 've been that way time an ' again . But dad 's a mighty jest man ; all the fleet says so . "
6881	6892	6893	6893	Harvey	250	" Looks like justice , this , do n't it ? "
6900	7113	6893	6893	Harvey	250	" Thet 's nothin' . Lets the shore blood outer you . Dad did it for yer health . Say , though , I ca n't have dealin 's with a man that thinks me or dad or any one on the ' We 're Here 's ' a thief . We ai n't any common wharf - end crowd by any manner o ' means . We 're fishermen , an ' we 've shipped together for six years an ' more . Do n't you make any mistake on that ! I told ye dad do n't let me swear . He calls 'em vain oaths , and pounds me ; but ef I could say what you said ' baout your pap an ' his fixin 's , I 'd say that ' baout your dollars . I dunno what was in your pockets when I dried your kit , fer I did n't look to see ; but I 'd say , using the very same words ez you used jest now , neither me nor dad - an ' we was the only two that teched you after you was brought aboard - knows anythin ' ' baout the money . Thet 's my say . Naow ? "
7137	7143	7144	7144	he	250	" That 's all right , "
7153	7177	7148	7148	he	250	" ' Seems to me that for a fellow just saved from drowning I have n't been over and above grateful , Dan . "
7178	7188	7190	7190	Dan	260	" Well , you was shook up and silly , "
7192	7214	7190	7190	Dan	260	" Anyway , there was only dad an ' me aboard to see it . The cook he do n't count . "
7215	7227	7228	7228	Harvey	250	" I might have thought about losing the bills that way , "
7235	7250	7228	7228	Harvey	250	" instead of calling everybody in sight a thief . Where 's your father ? "
7251	7266	7190	7190	Dan	260	" In the cabin . What d ' you want o ' him again ? "
7267	7272	7274	7274	Harvey	250	" You 'll see , "
7341	7349	7351	7351	Harvey	250	" I have n't acted quite right , "
7359	7365	7367	7368	the skipper	579	" What 's wrong naow ? "
7370	7378	7367	7368	the skipper	579	" Walked into Dan , hev ye ? "
7379	7387	7367	7368	the skipper	579	" No ; it 's about you . "
7388	7395	7367	7368	the skipper	579	" I 'm here to listen . "
7396	7409	7411	7411	Harvey	250	" Well , I - I 'm here to take things back , "
7415	7425	7426	7426	he	250	" When a man 's saved from drowning - - "
7429	7445	7426	7426	he	250	" Ey ? You 'll make a man yet ef you go on this way . "
7446	7456	7367	7368	the skipper	579	" He ought n't begin by calling people names . "
7457	7468	7470	7470	Troop	260	" Jest an ' right - right an ' jest , "
7480	7491	7470	7470	Troop	260	" So I 'm here to say I 'm sorry . "
7516	7540	7496	7496	Troop	260	" I mistrusted ' twould do you sights o ' good ; an ' this shows I were n't mistook in my jedgments . "
7550	7560	7496	7496	Troop	260	" I am very seldom mistook in my jedgments . "
7577	7636	7496	7496	Troop	260	" We 'll put a little more gristle to that ' fore we 've done with you , young feller ; an ' I do n't think any worse of ye fer anythin ' the 's gone by . You was n't fairly responsible . Go right abaout your business an ' you wo n't take no hurt . "
7637	7642	7644	7644	Dan	260	" You 're white , "
7660	7667	7669	7669	he	250	" I do n't feel it , "
7671	7788	7669	7669	he	250	" I did n't mean that way . I heard what Dad said . When Dad allows he do n't think the worse of any man , Dad 's give himself away . He hates to be mistook in his jedgments too . Ho ! ho ! Onct Dad has a jedgment , he 'd sooner dip his colours to the British than change it . I 'm glad it 's settled right eend up . Dad 's right when he says he ca n't take you back . It 's all the livin ' we make here - fishin ' . The men'll be back like sharks after a dead whale in ha'af an hour . "
7789	7793	7795	7795	Harvey	250	" What for ? "
7797	7818	7795	7795	Harvey	250	" Supper , o ' course . Do n't your stummick tell you ? You 've a heap to learn . "
7819	7824	7826	7826	Harvey	250	" Guess I have , "
7840	7846	7848	7848	Dan	260	" She 's a daisy , "
7856	7883	7884	7884	He	250	" Wait till our mainsail 's bent , an ' she walks home with all her salt wet . There 's some work first , though . "
7901	7912	7914	7914	Harvey	250	" What 's that for ? It 's all empty , "
7916	7932	7934	7934	Dan	260	" You an ' me an ' a few more hev got to fill it , "
7936	7944	7934	7934	Dan	260	" That 's where the fish goes . "
7945	7948	7950	7950	Harvey	250	" Alive ? "
7952	7997	7950	7950	Harvey	250	" Well , no . They 're so 's to be ruther dead - an ' flat - an ' salt . There 's a hundred hogshead o ' salt in the bins , an ' we hain't more'n covered our dunnage to now . "
7998	8006	7934	7934	Dan	260	" Where are the fish , though ? "
8007	8022	8024	8024	Dan	260	" ' In the sea they say , in the boats we pray , ' "
8032	8045	8046	8046	He	250	" You come in last night with ' baout forty of 'em . "
8063	8136	8046	8046	He	250	" You an ' me we 'll sluice that out when they 're through . ' Send we 'll hev full pens to - night ! I 've seen her down ha'af a foot with fish waitin ' to clean , an ' we stood to the tables till we was splittin ' ourselves instid o ' them , we was so sleepy . Yes , they 're comm ' in naow . "
8158	8170	8172	8172	Harvey	250	" I 've never seen the sea from so low down , "
8174	8179	8172	8172	Harvey	250	" It 's fine . "
8242	8249	8251	8251	Dan	260	" They 've struck on good , "
8260	8281	8251	8251	Dan	260	" Manuel hain't room fer another fish . Low ez a lily - pad in still water , Aeneid he ? "
8282	8304	8212	8215	Each schooner in sight	587	" Which is Manuel ? I do n't see how you can tell 'em ' way off , as you do . "
8305	8318	8320	8320	Dan	260	" Last boat to the south'ard . He fund you last night , "
8324	8484	8320	8320	Dan	260	" Manuel rows Portugoosey ; ye ca n't mistake him . East o ' him - he 's a heap better'n he rows - is Pennsylvania . Loaded with saleratus , by the looks of him . East o ' him - see how pretty they string out all along - with the humpy shoulders , is Long Jack . He 's a Galway man inhabitin ' South Boston , where they all live mostly , an ' mostly them Galway men are good in a boat . North , away yonder - you 'll hear him tune up in a minute is Tom Platt . Man - o'-war 's man he was on the old Ohio first of our navy , he says , to go araound the Horn . He never talks of much else , ' cept when he sings , but he has fair fishin ' luck . There ! What did I tell you ? "
8512	8542	8212	8215	Each schooner in sight	587	" Bring forth the chart , the doleful chart , See where them mountings meet ! The clouds are thick around their heads , The mists around their feet . "
8543	8547	8549	8549	Dan	260	" Full boat , "
8555	8570	8571	8572	The bellow	591	" If he give us ' O Captain ' it 's topping ' too ! "
8575	8601	8571	8572	The bellow	591	" And naow to thee , O Capting , Most earnestly I pray , That they shall never bury me In church or cloister gray . "
8602	8696	8571	8572	The bellow	591	" Double game for Tom Platt . He 'll tell you all about the old Ohio tomorrow . ' See that blue dory behind him ? He 's my uncle , - Dad 's own brother , - an ' ef there 's any bad luck loose on the Banks she 'll fetch up agin Uncle Salters , sure . Look how tender he 's rowin ' . I 'll lay my wage and share he 's the only man stung up to - day - an ' he 's stung up good . "
8697	8703	8705	8705	Harvey	250	" What 'll sting him ? "
8710	8800	8705	8705	Harvey	250	" Strawberries , mostly . Pumpkins , sometimes , an ' sometimes lemons an ' cucumbers . Yes , he 's stung up from his elbows down . That man 's luck 's perfectly paralyzin ' . Naow we 'll take a - holt o ' the tackles an ' hist 'em in . Is it true what you told me jest now , that you never done a hand 's turn o ' work in all your born life ? Must feel kinder awful , do n't it ? "
8801	8812	8813	8813	Harvey	250	" I 'm going to try to work , anyway , "
8817	8825	8813	8813	Harvey	250	" Only it 's all dead new . "
8826	8841	8842	8842	Harvey	250	" Lay a - holt o ' that tackle , then . Behind ye ! "
8873	8878	8870	8870	he	260	" topping - lift , "
8919	8927	8928	8928	he	250	" Two hundred and thirty - one , "
8931	8937	8939	8939	Dan	260	" Give him the hook , "
8983	8986	8988	8988	Dan	260	" Pull ! "
9003	9015	9016	9016	Dan	260	" Hold on , she do n't nest in the crosstrees ! "
9035	9039	9040	9040	Dan	260	" Lower away , "
9065	9093	9048	9048	Dan	260	" They do n't weigh nothin' empty . Thet was right smart fer a passenger . There 's more trick to it in a sea - way . "
9094	9098	9100	9100	Manuel	272	" Ah ha ! "
9108	9139	9100	9100	Manuel	272	" You are some pretty well now ? This time last night the fish they fish for you . Now you fish for fish . Eh , wha - at ? "
9140	9150	9151	9151	Harvey	250	" I 'm - I 'm ever so grateful , "
9203	9214	9216	9216	Manuel	272	" There is no to be thankful for to me ! "
9218	9247	9248	9248	He	272	" How shall I leave you dreeft , dreeft all around the Banks ? Now you are a fisherman eh , wha - at ? Ouh ! Auh ! "
9265	9292	9293	9293	Harvey	250	" I have not cleaned boat to - day . Too busy . They struck on queek . Danny , my son , clean for me . "
9340	9354	9356	9356	Dan	260	" Hike out the foot - boards ; they slide in them grooves , "
9358	9388	9356	9356	Dan	260	" Swab 'em an ' lay 'em down . Never let a foot - board jam . Ye may want her bad some day . Here 's Long Jack . "
9403	9435	9436	9436	Harvey	250	" Manuel , you take the tackle . I 'll fix the tables . Harvey , clear Manuel 's boat . Long Jack 's nestin ' on the top of her . "
9453	9466	9468	9468	Dan	260	" Jest like the Injian puzzle - boxes , ai n't they ? "
9479	9489	9491	9492	Long Jack	273	" Takes to ut like a duck to water , "
9533	9553	9555	9556	Long Jack	273	" Wan hunder an ' forty - nine an ' a half - bad luck to ye , Discobolus ! "
9558	9582	9555	9556	Long Jack	273	" I 'm murderin ' meself to fill your pockuts . Slate ut for a bad catch . The Portugee has bate me . "
9597	9610	9585	9586	another dory	603	" Two hundred and three . Let 's look at the passenger ! "
9680	9687	9689	9691	the scarred man	607	" He 's caught on good , "
9702	9735	9695	9696	Toni Platt	283	" There are two ways o ' doin' everything . One 's fisher - fashion - any end first an ' a slippery hitch over all - an ' the other 's - "
9736	9745	9746	9746	Dan	260	" What we did on the old Ohio ! "
9762	9780	9781	9781	He	260	" Get out o ' here , Tom Platt , an ' leave me fix the tables . "
9818	9834	9836	9837	Tom Platt	274	" An ' they did that on the Ohio , too , Danny . See ? "
9841	9891	9836	9837	Tom Platt	274	" Guess they was swivel - eyed , then , fer it did n't git home , and I know who 'll find his boots on the main - truck ef he do n't leave us alone . Haul ahead ! I 'm busy , ca n't ye see ? "
9892	9906	9908	9909	Long Jack	273	" Danny , ye lie on the cable an ' sleep all day , "
9911	9932	9908	9909	Long Jack	273	" You 're the hoight av impidence , an ' I 'm persuaded ye'll corrupt our supercargo in a week . "
9933	9939	9941	9941	Dan	260	" His name 's Harvey , "

10045	10059	10060	10062	the small voice	613	" Forty - two or forty - five . I 've lost count , "
10065	10084	10086	10086	Dan	260	" It 's Penn an ' Uncle Salters caountin ' catch . This beats the circus any day , "

10200	10225	10086	10086	Dan	260	" I am sorry , Mr. Salters . I came to sea on account of nervous dyspepsia . You advised me , I think . "
10226	10241	10243	10244	Uncle Salters	276	" You an ' your nervis dyspepsy be drowned in the Whale - hole , "
10253	10274	10243	10244	Uncle Salters	276	" You 're comin ' down on me agin . Did ye say forty - two or forty - five ? "
10275	10287	10086	10086	Dan	260	" I 've forgotten , Mr. Salters . Let 's count . "
10288	10306	10308	10309	Uncle Salters	276	" Do n't see as it could be forty - five . I 'm forty - five , "

He was a Moravian preacher once . Jacob Boiler wuz his name , Dad told me , an ' he lived with his wife an ' four children somewheres out Pennsylvania way . Well , Penn he took his folks along to a Moravian meetin ' - camp - meetin ' most like - an ' they stayed over jest one night in Johns - town . You 've heered talk o ' Johnstown ? "
16554	16576	16551	16551	Harvey	250	" Yes , I have . But I do n't know why . It sticks in my head same as Ashtabula . "
16577	16821	16408	16408	he	250	" Both was big accidents - thet 's why , Harve . Well , that one single night Penn and his folks was to the hotel Johnstown was wiped out . ' Dam bust an ' flooded her , an ' the houses struck adrift an ' bumped into each other an ' sunk . I 've seen the pictures , an ' they 're dretful . Penn he saw his folk drowned all'n a heap ' fore he rightly knew what was comin ' . His mind give out from that on . He mistrusted somethin' he d happened up to Johnstown , but for the poor life of him he could n't remember what , an ' he jest drifted araound smilin ' an ' wonderin ' . He did n't know what he was , nor yit what he he d bin , an ' thet way he run agin Uncle Salters , who was visitin ' ' n Allegheny City . Ha'af my mother 's folks they live scattered inside o ' Pennsylvania , an ' Uncle Salters he visits araound winters . Uncle Salters he kinder adopted Penn , well knowin ' what his trouble wuz ; an ' he brought him East , an ' he give him work on his farm . ' , Why , I heard him calling Penn a farmer last night when the boats bumped . Is your Uncle Salters a farmer ? "
16822	16825	16827	16827	Dan	260	" Farmer ! "
16829	17221	16827	16827	Dan	260	" There ai n't water enough ' tween here an ' Hatt'rus to wash the furrer - mold off'n his boots . He 's jest everlastin ' farmer . Why , Harve , I 've seen thet man hitch up a bucket , long towards sundown , an ' set twiddlin ' the spigot to the scuttle - butt same 's ef ' twas a cow 's bag . He 's thet much farmer . Well , Penn an ' he they ran the farm - up Exeter way ' twur . Uncle Salters he sold it this spring to a jay from Boston as wanted to build a summer - haouse , an ' he got a heap for it . Well , them two loonies scratched along till , one day , Penn 's church - he 'd belonged to the Moravians - found out where he wuz drifted an ' layin ' , an ' wrote to Uncle Salters . ' Never heerd what they said exactly ; but Uncle Salters was mad . He 's a ' piscopolian mostly - but he jest let 'em hev it both sides o ' the bow , 's if he was a Baptist ; an ' sez he warn't goin' to give up Penn to any blame Moravian connection in Pennsylvania or anywheres else . Then he come to Dad , towin ' Penn , - thet was two trips back , - an ' sez he an ' Penn must fish a trip fer their health . ' Guess he thought the Moravians would n't hunt the Banks fer Jacob Boiler . Dad was agreeable , fer Uncle Salters he 'd been fishin ' off an ' on fer thirty years , when he warn't inventin ' patent manures , an ' he took quarter - share in the ' We 're Here ' ; an ' the trip done Penn so much good , Dad made a habit o ' takin ' him . Some day , Dad sez , he 'll remember his wife an ' kids an ' Johnstown , an ' then , like as not , he 'll die , Dad sez . Do n't ye talk abaout Johnstown ner such things to Penn , ' r Uncle Salters he 'll heave ye overboard . "
17222	17226	17228	17228	Harvey	250	" Poor Penn ! "
17230	17249	17228	17228	Harvey	250	" I should n't ever have thought Uncle Salters cared for him by the look of 'em together . "
17250	17261	17263	17263	Dan	260	" I like Penn , though ; we all do , "
17265	17284	17263	17263	Dan	260	" We ought to ha ' give him a tow , but I wanted to tell ye first . "
17301	17313	17315	17315	Troop	260	" You need n't heave in the dories till after dinner , "
17320	17333	17315	17315	Troop	260	" We 'll dress daown right off . Fix table , boys ! "
17334	17341	17343	17343	Dan	260	" Deeper'n the Whale - deep , "
17358	17384	17350	17350	he	260	" Look at them boats that hev edged up sence mornin ' . They 're all waitin ' on Dad . See 'em , Harve ? "
17385	17393	17315	17315	Troop	260	" They are all alike to me . "
17411	17560	17350	17350	he	260	" They ai n't , though . That yaller , dirty packet with her bowsprit steeved that way , she 's the Hope of Prague . Nick Brady 's her skipper , the meanest man on the Banks . We 'll tell him so when we strike the Main Ledge . ' Way off yonder 's the Day 's Eye . The two Jeraulds own her . She 's from Harwich ; fastish , too , an ' hez good luck ; but Dad he 'd find fish in a graveyard . Them other three , side along , they 're the Margie Smith , Rose , and Edith S. Walen , all from home . ' Guess we 'll see the Abbie M. Deering to - morrer , Dad , wo n't we ? They 're all slippin ' over from the shaol o ' ' Oueereau . "
17561	17574	17602	17602	he	260	" You wo n't see many boats to - morrow , Danny . "
17593	17601	17602	17602	he	260	" Boys , we 're too crowded , "
17614	17627	17602	17602	he	260	" We 'll leave 'em to bait big an ' catch small . "
17666	17675	17676	17676	he	260	" I 'm waitin ' on the weather , "
17679	17698	17700	17701	Long Jack	273	" Ye'll have to make it yourself , Disko , for there 's no sign I can see , "

17940	17948	17935	17935	Troop	263	" That 's good , my son ! "
17949	17956	17958	17959	Tom Platt	274	" Never seen anchor weighed before ? "
17972	17980	17962	17962	Harvey	250	" No . Where are we going ? "
17981	18033	18053	18053	Troop	263	" Fish and make berth , as you 'll find out ' fore you 've been a week aboard . It 's all new to you , but we never know what may come to us . Now , take me - Tom Platt - I 'd never ha ' thought - "
18034	18051	18053	18053	Troop	263	" It 's better than fourteen dollars a month an ' a bullet in your belly , "
18059	18066	18053	18053	Troop	263	" Ease your jumbo a grind . "
18067	18074	18076	18081	the man - o'-war 's man	734	" Dollars an ' cents better , "
18097	18154	18076	18081	the man - o'-war 's man	734	" But we did n't think o ' that when we manned the windlass - brakes on the Miss Jim Buck , I outside Beau - fort Harbor , with Fort Macon heavin ' hot shot at our stern , an ' a livin ' gale atop of all . Where was you then , Disko ? "
18155	18162	18163	18163	Disko	263	" Jest here , or hereabouts , "

18282	18289	18291	18291	Disko	263	" Guess she 'd carry stays'l , "
18300	18320	18321	18324	the farmer - sailor	738	" Guess she would n't to any sorter profit . What 's the sense o ' wastin ' canvas ? "
18379	18389	18391	18391	Dan	260	" See Dad chase him all around the deck , "
18393	18429	18391	18391	Dan	260	" Uncle Salters he thinks his quarter share 's our canvas . Dad 's put this duckin ' act up on him two trips runnin ' . Hi ! That found him where he feeds . "
18461	18472	18474	18474	Disko	263	" Guess she 'd lie easier under stays'l , Salters , "
18483	18491	18493	18494	the victim	740	" Set your old kite , then , "
18501	18541	18493	18494	the victim	740	" only do n't lay it to me if anything happens . Penn , you go below right off an ' git your coffee . You ought to hev more sense than to bum araound on deck this weather . "
18542	18558	18560	18560	Dan	260	" Now they 'll swill coffee an ' play checkers till the cows come home , "
18573	18610	18563	18564	Uncle Salters	276	" ' Looks to me like 's if we 'd all be doin' so fer a spell . There 's nothin' in creation deader - limpsey - idler'n a Banker when she ai n't on fish . "

18635	18678	18622	18623	Long Jack	273	" I 'd dean forgot we 'd a passenger under that T - wharf hat . There 's no idleness for thim that do n't know their ropes . Pass him along , Tom Platt , an ' we 'll larn him . "

19203	19219	19097	19098	Tom Platt	274	" No , the boom . Then run that rope you showed me back there - "
19220	19226	19227	19228	Tom Platt	274	" That 's no way , "
19232	19254	19227	19228	Tom Platt	274	" Quiet ! He 's larnin ' , an ' has not the names good yet . Go on , Harve . "
19255	19282	19097	19098	Tom Platt	274	" Oh , it 's the reef - pennant . I 'd hook the tackle on to the reef - pennant , and then let down - "
19283	19292	19294	19295	Tom Platt	274	" Lower the sail , child ! Lower ! "
19302	19310	19311	19311	Harvey	250	" Lower the throat and peak halyards , "

19393	19502	19503	19503	He	748	" You 've forgot to pass the tack - earing , but wid time and help ye'll larn . There 's good and just reason for ivry rope aboard , or else ' twould be overboard .

20499	20506	20507	20507	Harvey	250	" Are they good to eat ? "
20520	20569	20507	20507	Harvey	250	" Sure . When they 're lousy it 's a sign they 've all been herdin ' together by the thousand , and when they take the bait that way they 're hungry . Never mind how the bait sets . They 'll bite on the bare hook . "
20570	20577	20578	20578	Harvey	250	" Say , this is great ! "
20601	20617	20597	20597	Dan	260	" Why ca n't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories ? "
20618	20689	20597	20597	Dan	260	" Allus can , till we begin to dress daown . Efter thet , the heads and offals ' u'd scare the fish to Fundy .

21443	21489	21435	21435	He	260	" I tell you , Harve , there ai n't money in Gloucester ' u'd hire me to ship on a reg'lar trawler . It may be progressive , but , barrin ' that , it 's the putterin'est , slimjammest business top of earth . "
21490	21505	21507	21507	Harvey	250	" I do n't know what this is , if ' tisn't regular trawling , "

There was a terr'ble gale on , an ' they was gettin ' the Betty home 's fast as they could craowd her . Well , Ireson he said there warn't any sense to reskin ' a boat in that sea ; the men they would n't hev it ; and he laid it before them to stay by the Active till the sea run daown a piece . They would n't hev that either , hangin ' araound the Cape in any sech weather , leak or no leak . They jest up stays'l an ' quit , nat'rally takin ' Ireson with 'em . Folks to Marblehead was mad at him not runnin ' the risk , and becaze nex ' day , when the sea was ca'am they never stopped to think o ' that , some of the Active 's folks was took off by a Truro man . They come into Marblehead with their own tale to tell , sayin ' how Ireson had shamed his town , an ' so forth an ' so on , an ' Ireson 's men they was scared , seein ' public feelin ' agin ' 'em , an ' they went back on Ireson , an ' swore he was respons'ble for the hull act .

Well , the facts come aout later , same 's they usually do , too late to be any ways useful to an honest man ; an ' Whittier he come along an ' picked up the slack eend of a lyin ' tale , an ' tarred and feathered Ben Ireson all over onct more after he was dead .

28087	28096	28097	28097	He	340	" said the cook , rolling his eyes . "
28106	28107	28100	28100	his	340	" "
28130	28134	28136	28136	you	921	" said Manuel . "
28152	28235	28146	28146	she	922	" He threw out his hands with an indescribable gesture , while Penn sat down on the house and sobbed at the sheer horror and pity of it all . Harvey could not realize that he had seen death on the open waters , but he felt very sick . Then Dan went up the cross - trees , and Disko steered them back to within sight of their own trawl - buoys just before the fog blanketed the sea once again . "
28246	28254	28146	28146	she	922	" was all he said to Harvey . "
28270	28271	28317	28317	Salters	276	" "
28305	28315	28317	28317	Salters	276	" Abishal has shorely took his luck with him , "
28319	28340	28317	28317	Salters	276	" The wind hain't backed ner riz ner nothin' . How abaout the trawl ? I despise superstition , anyway . "
28363	28383	28359	28360	the cook	628	" The luck iss in two pieces . You will find it so when you look . I know . "
28474	28483	28509	28510	Tom Platt	274	" And naow to thee , O Capting , "
28521	28531	28533	28534	Long Jack	273	" The luck 's cut square in two pieces , "
28560	28585	28542	28542	Harvey	250	" One half was jest punkins . Tom Platt wanted to haul her an ' ha ' done wid ut ; but I said , "
28633	28711	28712	28712	I	0	" The fish bit at the newly baited hooks from which their brethren had just been taken , and Tom Platt and Long Jack moved methodically up and down the length of the trawl , the boat 's nose surging under the wet line of hooks , stripping the sea - cucumbers that they called pumpkins , slatting off the fresh - caught cod against the gunwale , rebaiting , and loading Manuel 's dory till dusk . "
28718	28723	28712	28712	I	0	" said Disko then - "
28754	28794	28741	28741	Heave	937	" That was a mighty dressing - down , attended by three or four blowing grampuses . It lasted till nine o'clock , and Disko was thrice heard to chuckle as Harvey pitched the split fish into the hold . "
28805	28821	28797	28797	you	935	" said Dan , when they ground the knives after the men had turned in . "
28844	28845	28837	28837	you	935	" "
28849	28859	28837	28837	you	935	" Harvey replied , testing a blade 's edge . "
28873	28940	28866	28866	she	936	" The little schooner was gambolling all around her anchor among the silver - tipped waves . Backing with a start of affected surprise at the sight of the strained cable , she pounced on it like a kitten , while the spray of her descent burst through the hawse - holes with the report of a gun . Shaking her head , she would say : "
28960	28976	28955	28955	I	0	" and would sidle off , halting suddenly with a dramatic rattle of her rigging . "
28985	29072	29074	29074	her	941	" she would begin , as gravely as a drunken man addressing a lamp - post . The rest of the sentence she acted her words in dumb - show , of course was lost in a fit of the fidgets , when she behaved like a puppy chewing a string , a clumsy woman in a side - saddle , a hen with her head cut off , or a cow stung by a hornet , exactly as the whims of the sea took her . "
29086	29109	29080	29080	She	941	" said Dan . She swung sideways on a roller , and gesticulated with her jib - boom from port to starboard . "
29127	29166	29174	29174	she	941	" Wop ! She sat down in the moon - path on the water , courtesying with a flourish of pride impressive enough had not the wheel - gear sniggered mockingly in its box . Harvey laughed aloud . "
29178	29182	29183	29183	She	941	" he said . "
29199	29217	29183	29183	She	941	" said Dan enthusiastically , as he was slung across the deck in a batter of spray . "
29274	29275	29238	29238	she	941	" "
29283	29284	29285	29285	Them	944	" "
29426	29427	29421	29421	she	949	" "
29435	29436	29433	29433	Dan	260	" "
29464	29474	29459	29459	you	260	" Then to himself , half under his breath , "
29485	29547	29479	29479	her	949	" CHAPTER V That was the first of many talks with Dan , who told Harvey why he would transfer his dory 's name to the imaginary Burgess - modelled haddocker . Harvey heard a good deal about the real Hattie at Gloucester ; saw a lock of her hair - which Dan , finding fair words of no avail , had "
29549	29779	29449	29449	mebbe	2083	" as she sat in front of him at school that winter - and a photograph . Hattie was about fourteen years old , with an awful contempt for boys , and had been trampling on Dan 's heart through the winter . All this was revealed under oath of solemn secrecy on moonlit decks , in the dead dark , or in choking fog ; the whining wheel behind them , the climbing deck before , and without , the unresting , clamorous sea . Once , of course , as the boys came to know each other , there was a fight , which raged from bow to stern till Penn came up and separated them , but promised not to tell Disko , who thought fighting on watch rather worse than sleeping . Harvey was no match for Dan physically , but it says a great deal for his new training that he took his defeat and did not try to get even with his conqueror by underhand methods . That was after he had been cured of a string of boils between his elbows and wrists , where the wet jersey and oilskins cut into the flesh . The salt water stung them unpleasantly , but when they were ripe Dan treated them with Disko 's razor , and assured Harvey that now he was a "
29782	29980	29479	29479	her	949	" ; the affliction of gurry - sores being the mark of the caste that claimed him . Since he was a boy and very busy , he did not bother his head with too much thinking . He was exceedingly sorry for his mother , and often longed to see her and above all to tell her of this wonderful new life , and how brilliantly he was acquitting himself in it . Otherwise he preferred not to wonder too much how she was bearing the shock of his supposed death . But one day , as he stood on the foc'sle ladder , guying the cook , who had accused him and Dan of hooking fried pies , it occurred to him that this was a vast improvement on being snubbed by strangers in the smoking - room of a hired liner . He was a recognized part of the scheme of things on the We 're Here ; had his place at the table and among the bunks ; and could hold his own in the long talks on stormy days , when the others were always ready to listen to what they called his "
29984	30073	30074	30074	germans	951	" of his life ashore . It did not take him more than two days and a quarter to feel that if he spoke of his own life - it seemed very far away - no one except Dan and even Dan 's belief was sorely tried credited him . So he invented a friend , a boy he had heard of , who drove a miniature four - pony drag in Toledo , Ohio , and ordered five suits of clothes at a time and led things called "
30075	30133	29479	29479	her	949	" at parties where the oldest girl was not quite fifteen , but all the presents were solid silver . Salters protested that this kind of yarn was desperately wicked , if not indeed positively blasphemous , but he listened as greedily as the others ; and their criticisms at the end gave Harvey entirely new notions on "
30136	30178	29479	29479	her	949	" clothes , cigarettes with gold - leaf tips , rings , watches , scent , small dinner - parties , champagne , card - playing , and hotel accommodation . Little by little he changed his tone when speaking of his "
30181	30187	30188	30190	the Crazy Kid	350	" whom Long Jack had christened "
30192	30193	30188	30190	the Crazy Kid	350	" "
30200	30201	30194	30198	the Gilt - edged Baby	351	" "
30207	30239	30194	30198	the Gilt - edged Baby	351	" and other pet names ; and with his sea - booted feet cocked up on the table would even invent histories about silk pajamas and specially imported neckwear , to the "
30242	30281	30194	30198	the Gilt - edged Baby	351	" discredit . Harvey was a very adaptable person , with a keen eye and ear for every face and tone about him . Before long he knew where Disko kept the old greencrusted quadrant that they called the "
30285	30307	30308	30310	The Old Farmer	352	" - under the bed - bag in his bunk . When he took the sun , and with the help of "
30312	30421	30308	30310	The Old Farmer	352	" almanac found the latitude , Harvey would jump down into the cabin and scratch the reckoning and date with a nail on the rust of the stove - pipe . Now , the chief engineer of the liner could have done no more , and no engineer of thirty years ' service could have assumed one half of the ancient - mariner air with which Harvey , first careful to spit over the side , made public the schooner 's position for that day , and then and not till then relieved Disko of the quadrant . There is an etiquette in all these things . The said "
30426	30437	30308	30310	The Old Farmer	352	" an Eldridge chart , the farming almanac , Blunt 's "
30441	30445	30308	30310	The Old Farmer	352	" and Bowditch 's "
30447	30484	30308	30310	The Old Farmer	352	" were all the weapons Disko needed to guide him , except the deep - sea lead that was his spare eye . Harvey nearly slew Penn with it when Tom Platt taught him first how to "
30489	30530	30308	30310	The Old Farmer	352	" ; and , though his strength was not equal to continuous sounding in any sort of a sea , for calm weather with a seven - pound lead on shoal water Disko used him freely . As Dan said : "
30549	30917	30547	30547	Harve	250	" Harvey would tallow the cup at the end , and carefully bring the sand , shell , sludge , or whatever it might be , to Disko , who fingered and smelt it and gave judgment As has been said , when Disko thought of cod he thought as a cod ; and by some long - tested mixture of instinct and experience , moved the We 're Here from berth to berth , always with the fish , as a blindfolded chess - player moves on the unseen board . But Disko 's board was the Grand Bank - a triangle two hundred and fifty miles on each side - a waste of wallowing sea , cloaked with dank fog , vexed with gales , harried with drifting ice , scored by the tracks of the reckless liners , and dotted with the sails of the fishing - fleet . For days they worked in fog - Harvey at the bell - till , grown familiar with the thick airs , he went out with Tom Platt , his heart rather in his mouth . But the fog would not lift , and the fish were biting , and no one can stay helplessly afraid for six hours at a time . Harvey devoted himself to his lines and the gaff or gob - stick as Tom Platt called for them ; and they rowed back to the schooner guided by the bell and Tom 's instinct ; Manuel 's conch sounding thin and faint beside them . But it was an unearthly experience , and , for the first time in a month , Harvey dreamed of the shifting , smoking floors of water round the dory , the lines that strayed away into nothing , and the air above that melted on the sea below ten feet from his straining eyes . A few days later he was out with Manuel on what should have been forty - fathom bottom , but the whole length of the roding ran out , and still the anchor found nothing , and Harvey grew mortally afraid , for that his last touch with earth was lost . "
30922	30929	30547	30547	Harve	250	" said Manuel , hauling in . "
30939	31105	30547	30547	Harve	250	" and he rowed to the schooner to find Tom Platt and the others jeering at the skipper because , for once , he had led them to the edge of the barren Whale - deep , the blank hole of the Grand Bank . They made another berth through the fog , and that time the hair of Harvey 's head stood up when he went out in Manuel 's dory . A whiteness moved in the whiteness of the fog with a breath like the breath of the grave , and there was a roaring , a plunging , and spouting . It was his first introduction to the dread summer berg of the Banks , and he cowered in the bottom of the boat while Manuel laughed . There were days , though , clear and soft and warm , when it seemed a sin to do anything but loaf over the hand - lines and spank the drifting ' sun - scalds "
31382	31394	31396	31397	Long Jack	273	" ' Tis beautiful to see how he takes to ut , "
31411	31451	31400	31400	Harvey	250	" I 'll lay my wage an ' share ' tis more'n half play - actin ' to him , an ' he consates himself he 's a bowld mariner . Watch his little bit av a back now ! "
31452	31461	31463	31464	Tom Platt	274	" That 's the way we all begin , "
31466	31562	31563	31563	He	962	" The boys they make believe all the time till they 've cheated ' emselves into bein ' men , an ' so till they die - pretendin ' an ' pretendin ' . I done it on the old Ohio , I know . Stood my first watch - harbor - watch - feelin ' finer'n Farragut . Dan 's full o ' the same kind o ' notions . See 'em now , actin ' to be genewine moss - backs - very hair a rope - yarn an ' blood Stockholm tar . "
31570	31597	31563	31563	He	962	" Guess you 're mistook in your judgments fer once , Disko . What in Rome made ye tell us all here the kid was crazy ? "
31598	31602	31603	31603	Disko	263	" He wuz , "
31606	31631	31603	31603	Disko	263	" Crazy ez a loon when he come aboard ; but I 'll say he 's sobered up consid'ble sence . I cured him . "
31632	31637	31639	31640	Tom Platt	274	" He yarns good , "
31642	31711	31639	31640	Tom Platt	274	" T'other night he told us abaout a kid of his own size steerin ' a cunnin ' little rig an ' four ponies up an ' down Toledo , Ohio , I think ' twas , an ' givin ' suppers to a crowd o ' sim'lar kids . Cur'us kind o ' fairy - tale , but blame interestin ' . He knows scores of 'em . "
31712	31722	31723	31723	Disko	263	" Guess he strikes 'em outen his own head , "
31737	31774	31730	31730	he	263	" Stands to reason that sort is all made up . It do n't take in no one but Dan , an ' he laughs at it . I 've heard him , behind my back . "
31775	31815	31817	31818	Uncle Salters	276	" Yever hear what Sim'on Peter Ca'houn said when they whacked up a match ' twix ' his sister Hitty an ' Lorin ' Jerauld , an ' the boys put up that joke on him daown to Georges ? "
31871	31938	31862	31863	Uncle Salters	276	" Sim'on Peter Ca'houn he said , an ' he was jest right , abaout Lorin ' , ' Ha'af on the taown , ' he said , ' an ' t'other ha'af blame fool ; an ' they told me she 's married a ' ich man . ' Sim'on Peter Ca'houn he hedn't no roof to his mouth , an ' talked that way . "
31939	31948	31949	31950	Tom Platt	274	" He did n't talk any Pennsylvania Dutch , "
31953	31975	31949	31950	Tom Platt	274	" You 'd better leave a Cape man to tell that tale . The Ca'houns was gypsies frum ' way back . "
31976	31988	31989	31989	Salters	276	" Wal , I do n't profess to be any elocutionist , "
31992	32039	31989	31989	Salters	276	" I 'm comin ' to the moral o ' things . That 's jest abaout what aour Harve be ! Ha'af on the taown , an ' t'other ha'af blame fool ; an ' there 's some'll believe he 's a rich man . Yah ! "
32040	32060	32062	32063	Long Jack	273	" Did ye ever think how sweet ' twould be to sail wid a full crew o ' Salterses ? "
32065	32095	32062	32063	Long Jack	273	" Ha'af in the furrer an ' other ha'af in the muck - heap , as Ca'houn did not say , an ' makes out he 's a fisherman ! "
32145	32167	32119	32119	he	263	" July 17 . This day thick fog and few fish . Made berth to northward . So ends this day . "
32184	32211	32317	32317	hev	968	" July 19 . This day comes in with light breeze from N.E. and fine weather . Made a berth to eastward . Caught plenty fish . "
32241	32314	32315	32315	We	967	" They never worked on Sundays , but shaved , and washed themselves if it were fine , and Pennsylvania sang hymns . Once or twice he suggested that , if ft was not an impertinence , he thought he could preach a little . Uncle Salters nearly jumped down his throat at the mere notion , reminding him that he was not a preacher and must n't think of such things . "
32326	32330	32317	32317	hev	968	" Salters explained , "
32338	32350	32351	32351	Josephus	362	" so they compromised on his reading aloud from a book called "
32353	32445	32351	32351	Josephus	362	" It was an old leather - bound volume , smelling of a hundred voyages , very solid and very like the Bible , but enlivened with accounts of battles and sieges ; and they read it nearly from cover to cover . Otherwise Penn was a silent little body . He would not utter a word for three days on end sometimes , though he played checkers , listened to the songs , and laughed at the stories . When they tried to stir him up , he would answer : "
32477	32489	32470	32470	I	0	" He would turn to Uncle Salters with an expectant smile . "
32495	32499	32492	32493	Pennsylvania Pratt	363	" Salters would shout "
32506	32507	32500	32500	You	363	" "
32512	32522	32523	32524	Pennsylvania Pratt	363	" Penn would say , shutting his lips firmly . "
32529	32710	32523	32524	Pennsylvania Pratt	363	" he would repeat over and over . Sometimes it was Uncle Salters who forgot , and told him he was Haskins or Rich or McVitty ; but Penn was equally content - till next time . He was always very tender with Harvey , whom he pitied both as a lost child and as a lunatic ; and when Salters saw that Penn liked the boy , he relaxed , too . Salters was not an amiable person He esteemed it his business to keep the boys in order ; and the first time Harvey , in fear and trembling , on a still day , managed to shin up to the main - truck Dan was behind him ready to help , he esteemed it his duty to hang Salters 's big sea - boots up there - a sight of shame and derision to the nearest schooner . With Disko , Harvey took no liberties ; not even when the old man dropped direct orders , and treated him , like the rest of the crew , to "
32721	32723	32523	32524	Pennsylvania Pratt	363	" and "
32729	32816	32523	32524	Pennsylvania Pratt	363	" and so forth . There was something about the clean - shaven lips and the puckered corners of the eyes that was mightily sobering to young blood . Disko showed him the meaning of the thumbed and pricked chart , which , he said , laid over any government publication whatsoever ; led him , pencil in hand , from berth to berth over the whole string of banks - Le Have , Western , Banquereau , St. Pierre , Green , and Grand - talking "
32818	32831	32523	32524	Pennsylvania Pratt	363	" meantime . Taught him , too , the principle on which the "
32835	33132	32523	32524	Pennsylvania Pratt	363	" was worked . In this Harvey excelled Dan , for he had inherited a head for figures , and the notion of stealing information from one glimpse of the sullen Bank sun appealed to all his keen wits . For other sea - matters his age handicapped him . As Disko said , he should have begun when he was ten . Dan could bait up trawl or lay his hand on any rope in the dark ; and at a pinch , when Uncle Salters had a gurry - score on his palm , could dress down by sense of touch . He could steer in anything short of half a gale from the feel of the wind on his face , humouring the ' We 're Here ' just when she needed it . These things he did as automatically as he skipped about the rigging , or made his dory a part of his own will and body . But he could not communicate his knowledge to Harvey . Still there was a good deal of general information flying about the schooner on stormy days , when they lay up in the foc'sle or sat on the cabin lockers , while spare eye - bolts , leads , and rings rolled and rattled in the pauses of the talk . Disko spoke of whaling voyages in the Fifties ; of great she - whales slain beside their young ; of death agonies on the black tossing seas , and blood that spurted forty feet in the air ; of boats smashed to splinters ; of patent rockets that went off wrong - end - first and bombarded the trembling crews ; of cutting - in and boiling - down , and that terrible "
33134	33205	32523	32524	Pennsylvania Pratt	363	" of ' 71 , when twelve hundred men were made homeless on the ice in three days - wonderful tales , all true . But more wonderful still were his stories of the cod , and how they argued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down below the keel . Long Jack 's tastes ran more to the supernatural . He held them silent with ghastly stories of the "
33209	33705	33706	33706	Josephus	362	" on Monomoy Beach , that mock and terrify lonely clam - diggers ; of sand - walkers and dune - haunters who were never properly buried ; of hidden treasure on Fire Island guarded by the spirits of Kidd 's men ; of ships that sailed in the fog straight over Truro township ; of that harbor in Maine where no one but a stranger will lie at anchor twice in a certain place because of a dead crew who row alongside at midnight with the anchor in the bow of their old - fashioned boat , whistling - not calling , but whistling - for the soul of the man who broke their rest . Harvey had a notion that the east coast of his native land , from Mount Desert south , was populated chiefly by people who took their horses there in the summer and entertained in country - houses with hardwood floors and Vantine portires . He laughed at the ghost - tales , - not as much as he would have done a month before , - but ended by sitting still and shuddering . Tom Platt dealt with his interminable trip round the Horn on the old Ohio in flogging days , with a navy more extinct than the dodo - the navy that passed away in the great war . He told them how red - hot shot are dropped into a cannon , a wad of wet clay between them and the cartridge ; how they sizzle and reek when they strike wood , and how the little ship - boys of the Miss Jim Buck hove water over them and shouted to the fort to try again . And he told tales of blockade - long weeks of swaying at anchor , varied only by the departure and return of steamers that had used up their coal there was no chance for the sailing - ships ; of gales and cold that kept two hundred men , night and day , pounding and chopping at the ice on cable , blocks , and rigging , when the galley was as red - hot as the fort 's shot , and men drank cocoa by the bucket . Tom Platt had no use for steam . His service closed when that thing was comparatively new . He admitted that it was a specious invention in time of peace , but looked hopefully for the day when sails should come back again on ten - thousand - ton frigates with hundred - and - ninety - foot booms . Manuel 's talk was slow and gentle - all about pretty girls in Madeira washing clothes in the dry beds of streams , by moonlight , under waving bananas ; legends of saints , and tales of queer dances or fights away in the cold Newfoundland baiting - ports Salters was mainly agricultural ; for , though he read "
33707	33746	32523	32524	Pennsylvania Pratt	363	" and expounded it , his mission in life was to prove the value of green manures , and specially of clover , against every form of phosphate whatsoever . He grew libellous about phosphates ; he dragged greasy "
33749	34044	32523	32524	Pennsylvania Pratt	363	" books from his bunk and intoned them , wagging his finger at Harvey , to whom it was all Greek . Little Penn was so genuinely pained when Harvey made fun of Salters 's lectures that the boy gave it up , and suffered in polite silence . That was very good for Harvey . The cook naturally did not join in these conversations . As a rule , he spoke only when it was absolutely necessary ; but at times a queer gift of speech descended on him , and he held forth , half in Gaelic , half in broken English , an hour at a time . He was especially communicative with the boys , and he never withdrew his prophecy that one day Harvey would be Dan 's master , and that he would see it . He told them of mail - carrying in the winter up Cape Breton way , of the dog - train that goes to Coudray , and of the ram - steamer Arctic , that breaks the ice between the mainland and Prince Edward Island . Then he told them stories that his mother had told him , of life far to the southward , where water never froze ; and he said that when he died his soul would go to lie down on a warm white beach of sand with palm - trees waving above . That seemed to the boys a very odd idea for a man who had never seen a palm in his life . Then , too , regularly at each meal , he would ask Harvey , and Harvey alone , whether the cooking was to his taste ; and this always made the ' second half "
34166	34307	34309	34311	the two Jeraulds	370	" Dan called it - by his neighbours , but he had a very pretty knack of giving them the slip through the curdling , glidy fog - banks . Disko avoided company for two reasons . He wished to make his own experirnents , in the first place ; and in the second , he objected to the mixed gatherings of a fleet of all nations . The bulk of them were mainly Gloucester boats , with a scattering from Provincetown , Harwich , Chatham , and some of the Maine ports , but the crews drew from goodness knows where . Risk breeds recklessness , and when greed is added there are fine chances for every kind of accident in the crowded fleet , which , like a mob of sheep , is huddled round some unrecognized leader . "
34315	34319	34309	34311	the two Jeraulds	370	" said Disko . "
34362	34363	34309	34311	the two Jeraulds	370	" "
34368	34394	34309	34311	the two Jeraulds	370	" said Harvey , who was drawing water he had learned just how to wiggle the bucket , after an unusually long dressing - down . "
34408	34409	34309	34311	the two Jeraulds	370	" "
34429	34433	34436	34436	Dad	259	" said Dan . "
34532	34696	34528	34530	the Old Virgin	981	" Harvey understood from the Eldridge chart that the Old Virgin and a nest of curiously named shoals were the turning - point of the cruise , and that with good luck they would wet the balance of their salt there . But seeing the size of the Virgin it was one tiny dot , he wondered how even Disko with the hog - yoke and the lead could find her . He learned later that Disko was entirely equal to that and any other business and could even help others . A big four - by - five blackboard hung in the cabin , and Harvey never understood the need of it till , after some blinding thick days , they heard the unmelodious tooting of a foot - power fog - horn - a machine whose note is as that of a consumptive elephant . They were making a short berth , towing the anchor under their foot to save trouble . "
34706	34753	34754	34754	Frenchman	289	" said Long Jack . The dripping red head - sails of a bark glided out of the fog , and the ' We 're Here ' rang her bell thrice , using sea shorthand . The larger boat backed her topsail with shrieks and shoutings . "
34756	34763	34754	34754	Frenchman	289	" said Uncle Salters , scornfully . "
34770	34780	34754	34754	Frenchman	289	" The farmer had a weatherly sea - eye . "
34793	34794	34791	34791	Disko	263	" "
34798	34803	34791	34791	Disko	263	" said Tom Platt . "
34832	34833	34838	34839	Mucho bono	373	" "
34856	34872	34873	34873	Bord	375	" cried the other crowd , waving woollen caps and laughing . Then all together , "
34877	34878	34875	34875	Bord	375	" "
34924	34951	34915	34915	I	0	" Dan chalked the figures on the board , and they hung it in the main - rigging to a chorus of mercis from the bark . "
34963	34972	34915	34915	I	0	" Salters suggested , feeling in his pockets . "
34982	34986	34974	34974	ye	986	" said Disko . "
35021	35022	35023	35024	Harmon Rush	377	" "
35061	35062	35057	35057	you	1873	" "
35067	35076	35057	35057	you	1873	" said Harvey valiantly ; and he bawled : "
35092	35093	35057	35057	you	1873	" "
35100	35108	35057	35057	you	1873	" they cried , and laughed again . "
35122	35127	35128	35128	I	0	" said Tom Platt . "
35158	35383	35057	35057	you	1873	" The raffle and confusion when he and Harvey were hauled up the bark 's black side was indescribable . Her cabin was all stuck round with glaring coloured prints of the Virgin - the Virgin of Newfoundland , they called her . Harvey found his French of no recognized Bank brand , and his conversation was limited to nods and grins . But Tom Platt waved his arms and got along swimmingly . The captain gave him a drink of unspeakable gin , and the opera - comique crew , with their hairy throats , red caps , and long knives , greeted him as a brother . Then the trade began . They had tobacco , plenty of it - American , that had never paid duty to France . They wanted chocolate and crackers . Harvey rowed back to arrange with the cook and Disko , who owned the stores , and on his return the cocoa - tins and cracker - bags were counted out by the Frenchman 's wheel . It looked like a piratical division of loot ; but Tom Platt came out of it roped with black pigtail and stuffed with cakes of chewing and smoking tobacco . Then those jovial mariners swung off into the mist , and the last Harvey heard was a gay chorus : "
35427	35428	35057	35057	you	1873	" "
35445	35460	35439	35439	your	0	" Harvey demanded when the barter had been distributed among the We 're Heres . "
35465	35469	35439	35439	your	0	" Platt guffawed . "
35504	35505	35493	35496	chockfull o ' Freemasons	990	" "
35513	35514	35508	35509	a Freemason	991	" "
35523	35685	35508	35509	a Freemason	991	" said the man - o'-war 's man , stuffing his pipe ; and Harvey had another mystery of the deep sea to brood upon . CHAPTER VI The thing that struck him most was the exceedingly casual way in which some craft loafed about the broad Atlantic . Fishing - boats , as Dan said , were naturally dependent on the courtesy and wisdom of their neighbours ; but one expected better things of steamers . That was after another interesting interview , when they had been chased for three miles by a big lumbering old cattle - boat , all boarded over on the upper deck , that smelt like a thousand cattle - pens . A very excited officer yelled at them through a speaking - trumpet , and she lay and lollopped helplessly on the water while Disko ran the ' We 're Here ' under her lee and gave the skipper a piece of his mind . "
35740	35758	35759	35759	We	997	" At this the skipper danced on the bridge and said something about Disko 's own eyes . "
35777	35781	35786	35786	I	0	" he shouted . "
35789	35793	35786	35786	I	0	" Disko retorted . "
35817	35818	35812	35812	them	999	" "
35826	35847	35822	35822	ye	0	" said Uncle Salters with intense seriousness , for the smell of the pens woke all the farmer in him . "
35886	35887	35888	35888	Thunder	379	" "
35890	35907	35888	35888	Thunder	379	" said a cattle - man in a red jersey as he looked over the side . "
35918	35919	35911	35911	they	999	" "
35923	35935	35911	35911	they	999	" Salters began , standing up in the fore - rigging , "
35950	35964	35947	35947	I	0	" The officer on the bridge took off his cap with immense politeness . "
35968	35972	35947	35947	I	0	" he said , "
36014	36015	36017	36017	you	1873	" "
36028	36057	36017	36017	you	1873	" said Disko , angrily . He could not stand up to that particular sort of talk , and snapped out the latitude and longitude without more lectures . "
36071	36094	36062	36067	a boat - load of lunatics	1004	" said the skipper , as he rang up the engine - room and tossed a bundle of newspapers into the schooner . "
36121	36134	36135	36135	I	0	" said Disko as the ' We 're Here ' slid away . "
36174	36242	36168	36168	ye	1873	" Harvey , Dan , and the others stood back , winking one to the other and full of joy ; but Disko and Salters wrangled seriously till evening , Salters arguing that a cattle - boat was practically a barn on blue water , and Disko insisting that , even if this were the case , decency and fisher - pride demanded that he should have kept "
36246	36277	36168	36168	ye	1873	" Long Jack stood it in silence for a time , - an angry skipper makes an unhappy crew , - and then he spoke across the table after supper : "
36291	36295	36287	36287	they	1010	" said he . "
36310	36314	36296	36296	They	1010	" said Disko . "
36320	36321	36287	36287	they	1010	" "
36329	36348	36287	36287	they	1010	" said Salters , Impenitent , reading the farming reports from a week - old New York paper . "
36360	36366	36287	36287	they	1010	" the skipper went on . "
36374	36381	36424	36424	I	0	" said Long Jack , the peacemaker "
36478	36493	36553	36553	I	0	" Dan kicked Harvey under the table , and Harvey choked in his cup . "
36496	36510	36511	36511	I	0	" said Salters , who felt that his honour had been somewhat plastered , "
36531	36532	36528	36528	I	0	" "
36538	36549	36528	36528	I	0	" said Tom Platt , experienced in discipline and etiquette - "
36586	36587	36574	36574	your	263	" "
36594	36613	36574	36574	your	263	" said Disko , who saw his way to an honourable retreat from a fit of the dignities . "
36623	36627	36639	36639	hev	263	" said Salters , "
36671	36672	36679	36679	Harve	1017	" "
36715	36719	36699	36699	I	0	" Dan whispered . "
36731	36755	36699	36699	I	0	" said Disko , and the light of new argument lit in Salters 's eye as he crumbled cut plug into his pipe . "
36768	36779	36699	36699	I	0	" said Long Jack , intent on stilling the storm . "
36827	36828	36820	36820	Counahan	381	" "
36850	36861	36862	36862	He	381	" said Tom Platt , playing up to the lead . "
36914	36932	36890	36891	Sam Coy	383	" Counahan the Navigator ! Tck ! Tck ! Dead these fifteen year , ai n't he ? "
36933	37365	37366	37366	Nex	389	" Seventeen , I guess . He died the year the Caspar McVeagh was built ; but he could niver keep things sep'rate . Steyning tuk him fer the reason the thief tuk the hot stove - bekaze there was nothin' else that season . The men was all to the Banks , and Counahan he whacked up an iverlastin ' hard crowd fer crew . Rum ! Ye cud ha ' floated the Manila , insurance an ' all , in fwhat they stowed aboard her . They lef ' Boston Harbour for the great Grand Bank wid a roarin ' nor'wester behind 'em an ' all hands full to the bung . An ' the hivens looked after thim , for divil a watch did they set , an ' divil a rope did they lay hand to , till they 'd seen the bottom av a fifteen - gallon cask o ' bug - juice . That was about wan week , so far as Counahan remembered . If I cud only tell the tale as he told ut ! All that whoile the wind blew like ould glory , an ' the Marilla - ' twas summer , and they 'd give her a foretopmast - struck her gait and kept ut . Then Counahan tuk the hog - yoke an ' thrembled over it for a whoile , an ' made out , betwix ' that an ' the chart an ' the singin ' in his head , that they was to the south'ard o ' Sable Island , gettin ' along glorious , but speakin ' nothin' . Then they broached another keg , an ' quit speculatin ' about anythin ' fer another spell . The Marilla she lay down whin she dropped Boston Light , and she never lufted her lee - rail up to that time - hustlin ' on one an ' the same slant . But they saw no weed , nor gulls , nor schooners ; an ' prisintly they obsarved they 'd bin out a matter o ' fourteen days and they mis - trusted the Bank has suspinded payment . So they sounded , an ' got sixty fathom . ' That 's me , ' sez Counahan . ' That 's me iv'ry time ! I 've run her slat on the Bank fer you , an ' when we get thirty fathom we 'll turn in like little men . Counahan is the b'y , ' sez he . ' Counahan the Navigator ! ' "
37395	37464	37374	37374	Counahan	384	" They hauled ut up , bein ' just about in that state when ut seemed right an ' reasonable , and sat down on the deck countin ' the knots , an ' gettin ' her snarled up hijjus . The Marilla she 'd struck her gait , an ' she hild ut , an ' prisintly along came a tramp , an ' Counahan spoke her . "
37480	37498	37475	37475	he	384	" ' There 's lashin 's av them off the Irish coast , ' sez the tramp . "
37522	37536	37508	37508	Counahan	384	" ' Then fwhat are ye doin' here ? ' sez the tramp . "
37578	37607	37608	37608	Counahan	384	" ' Thirty - five mile west - sou'west o ' Cape Clear , ' sez the tramp , ' if that 's any consolation to you . ' "
37623	37701	37608	37608	Counahan	384	" ' Consolation ! ' sez he , bould as brass . ' D'ye take me fer a dialect ? Thirty - five mile from Cape Clear , an ' fourteen days from Boston Light . Sufferin ' Christianity , ' tis a record , an ' by the same token I 've a mother to Skibbereen ! ' Think av ut ! The gall av um ! But ye see he could niver keep things sep'rate . "
37809	37810	37795	37795	Counahan	384	" "
37818	37822	37814	37815	the firm	1038	" Harvey demanded . "
37905	37906	37899	37899	He	384	" "
37915	37924	37925	37925	They	1038	" said Manuel , in his gentle voice . "
38049	38050	38039	38039	they	1038	" "
38054	38069	38070	38070	Blanco	392	" said Disko , after a moment . Manuel shook his head , smiling . "
38072	38077	38070	38070	Blanco	392	" said Tom Platt . "
38115	38116	38135	38136	the Horn	38	" "
38128	38132	38135	38136	the Horn	38	" said Harvey . "
38152	38156	38159	38159	he	1910	" said Disko . "
38303	38304	38274	38274	they	1058	" "
38309	38317	38274	38274	they	1058	" said Salters , wagging his head . "
38363	38461	38326	38326	I	0	" Long Jack winked one tremendous wink that embraced all hands except Disko and Salters , and the incident was closed . Then they made berth after berth to the northward , the dories out almost every day , running along the east edge of the Grand Bank in thirty- to forty - fathom water , and fishing steadily . It was here Harvey first met the squid , who is one of the best cod - baits , but uncertain in his moods . They were waked out of their bunks one black night by yells of "
38465	38765	38766	38766	Dad	259	" from Salters , and for an hour and a half every soul aboard hung over his squid - jig - a piece of lead painted red and armed at the lower end with a circle of pins bent backward like half - opened umbrella ribs . The squid - for some unknown reason - likes , and wraps himself round , this thing , and is hauled up ere he can escape from the pins . But as he leaves his home he squirts first water and next ink into his captor 's face ; and it was curious to see the men weaving their heads from side to side to dodge the shot . They were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended ; but a pile of fresh squid lay on the deck , and the large cod thinks very well of a little shiny piece of squid tentacle at the tip of a clam - baited hook . Next day they caught many fish , and met the Carrie Pitman , to whom they shouted their luck , and she wanted to trade - seven cod for one fair - sized squid ; but Disko would not agree at the price , and the Carrie dropped sullenly to leeward and anchored half a mile away , in the hope of striking on to some for herself . Disco said nothing till after supper , when he sent Dan and Manuel out to buoy the ' We 're Here 's ' cable and announced his intention of turning in with the broad - axe . Dan naturally repeated these remarks to the dory from the Carrie , who wanted to know why they were buoying their cable , since they were not on rocky bottom . "
38781	38786	38768	38768	he	259	" Dan howled cheerfully . "
38801	38806	38808	38808	you	1065	" said the other . "
38846	38847	38848	38848	She	1067	" "
38857	38878	38848	38848	She	1067	" said the man angrily , for the Carrie Pitman had an unsavory reputation for breaking her ground - tackle . "
38885	38889	38848	38848	She	1067	" said Dan . "
38922	38928	38913	38913	you	1065	" That shot went home . "
38952	38957	38949	38950	Dan Troop	260	" was the answer . "
38970	38993	38949	38950	Dan Troop	260	" yelled Dan , who knew that one of the Carrie 's crew had worked in an overall factory the winter before . "
39005	39024	39002	39002	you	1065	" To call a Gloucester man a Nova Scotian is not well received . Dan answered in kind . "
39047	39061	39062	39062	I	0	" And the forces separated , but Chatharn had the worst of it . "
39069	39073	39062	39062	I	0	" said Disko . "
39138	39206	39134	39134	She	1075	" The wind , which had hauled round , rose at sundown and blew steadily . There was not enough sea , though , to disturb even a dory 's tackle , but the Carrie Pitman was a law unto herself . At the end of the boys ' watch they heard the crack - crack - crack of a huge muzzle - loading revolver aboard her . "
39213	39217	39134	39134	She	1075	" sung Dan . "
39242	39352	39236	39236	she	1075	" Had she been any other boat Disko would have taken his chances , but now he cut the cable as the Carrie Pitman , with all the North Atlantic to play in , lurched down directly upon them . The ' We 're Here ' , under jib and riding - sail , gave her no more room than was absolutely necessary , - Disko did not wish to spend a week hunting for his cable , - but scuttled up into the wind as the Carrie passed within easy hail , a silent and angry boat , at the mercy of a raking broadside of Bank chaff . "
39357	39367	39236	39236	she	1075	" said Disko , raising his head - gear , "
39376	39377	39236	39236	she	1075	" "
39387	39392	39393	39393	We	1079	" said Uncle Salters . "
39401	39402	39393	39393	We	1079	" "
39412	39417	39404	39404	I	0	" cried Long Jack . "
39429	39434	39393	39393	We	1079	" bawled Tom Platt . "
39437	39455	39393	39393	We	1079	" Dan 's voice rose shrill and high , as he stood on the wheel - box . "
39482	39483	39479	39479	ye	0	" "
39491	39495	39479	39479	ye	0	" cried Harvey , "
39503	39529	39530	39531	Johanna Morgan	397	" That was a salt - flavoured jest he had been put up to by Tom Platt . Manuel leaned over the stern and yelled : "
39538	39564	39530	39531	Johanna Morgan	397	" He flourished his broad thumb with a gesture of unspeakable contempt and derision , while little Penn covered himself with glory by piping up : "
39576	39739	39530	39531	Johanna Morgan	397	" They rode on their chain for the rest of the night , a short , snappy , uneasy motion , as Harvey found , and wasted half the forenoon recovering the cable . But the boys agreed the trouble was cheap at the price of triumph and glory , and they thought with grief over all the beautiful things that they might have said to the discomfited Carrie . CHAPTER VII Next day they fell in with more sails , all circling slowly from the east northerly towards the west . But just when they expected to make the shoals by the Virgin the fog shut down , and they anchored , surrounded by the tinklings of invisible bells . There was not much fishing , but occasionally dory met dory in the fog and exchanged news . That night , a little before dawn , Dan and Harvey , who had been sleeping most of the day , tumbled out to "
39741	39799	39801	39801	her	1086	" fried pies . There was no reason why they should not have taken them openly ; but they tasted better so , and it made the cook angry . The heat and smell below drove them on deck with their plunder , and they found Disko at the bell , which he handed over to Harvey . "
39804	39808	39809	39809	I	0	" said he . "
39833	39923	39824	39824	I	0	" It was a forlorn little jingle ; the thick air seemed to pinch it off , and in the pauses Harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liner 's siren , and he knew enough of the Banks to know what that meant . It came to him , with horrible distinctness , how a boy in a cherry - coloured jersey - he despised fancy blazers now with all a fisher - man 's contempt - how an ignorant , rowdy boy had once said it would be "
39925	40066	40069	40069	they	1087	" if a steamer ran down a fishing - boat . That boy had a stateroom with a hot and cold bath , and spent ten minutes each morning picking over a gilt - edged bill of fare . And that same boy - no , his very much older brother - was up at four of the dim dawn in streaming , crackling oilskins , hammering , literally for the dear life , on a bell smaller than the steward 's breakfast - bell , while somewhere close at hand a thirty - foot steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour ! The bitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry , upholstered cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat before breakfast . So Harvey rang the bell . "
40080	40091	40069	40069	they	1087	" said Dan , applying himself to Manuel 's conch , "
40122	40123	40117	40117	She	1089	" "
40130	40135	40117	40117	She	1089	" went the siren . "
40142	40147	40117	40117	She	1089	" went the bell . "
40152	40267	40117	40117	She	1089	" went the conch , while sea and sky were all mired up in milky fog . Then Harvey felt that he was near a moving body , and found himself looking up and up at the wet edge of a cliff - like bow , leaping , it seemed , directly over the schooner . A jaunty little feather of water curled in front of it , and as it lifted it showed a long ladder of Roman numerals - XV . , XVI . , XVII . , XVIII . , and so forth - on a salmon - coloured gleaming side . It tilted forward and downward with a heart - stilling "
40269	40383	40387	40387	You	1091	" ; the ladder disappeared ; a line of brass - rimmed port - holes flashed past ; a jet of steam puffed in Harvey 's helplessly uplifted hands ; a spout of hot water roared along the rail of the ' We 're Here ' , and the little schooner staggered and shook in a rush of screw - torn water , as a liner 's stern vanished in the fog . Harvey got ready to faint or be sick , or both , when he heard a crack like a trunk thrown on a sidewalk , and , all small in his ear , a far - away telephone voice drawling : "
40392	40393	40387	40387	You	1091	" "
40398	40402	40387	40387	You	1091	" he gasped . "
40417	40554	40555	40557	The Jennie Cushman	399	" said Dan , running out a dory . In half a minute all except Harvey , Penn , and the cook were overside and away . Presently a schooner 's stump - foremast , snapped clean across , drifted past the bows . Then an empty green dory came by , knocking on the ' We 're Here 's ' side , as though she wished to be taken in . Then followed something , face down , in a blue jersey , but - it was not the whole of a man . Penn changed colour and caught his breath with a click . Harvey pounded despairingly at the bell , for he feared they might be sunk at any minute , and he jumped at Dan 's hail as the crew came back . "
40559	40565	40555	40557	The Jennie Cushman	399	" said Dan , hysterically , "
40627	40648	40623	40623	I	0	" He dropped his head on his arms and sobbed while the others dragged a gray - headed man aboard . "
40657	40662	40651	40651	you	1095	" the stranger groaned . "
40673	40753	40667	40667	you	1095	" Disko dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder , for the man 's eyes were wild and his lips trembled as he stared at the silent crew . Then up and spoke Pennsylvania Pratt , who was also Haskins or Rich or McVitty when Uncle Salters forgot ; and his face was changed on him from the face of a fool to the countenance of an old , wise man , and he said in a strong voice : "
40789	40790	40797	40797	you	1101	" "
40799	40804	40797	40797	you	1101	" said the man . "
40871	40872	40864	40864	I	0	" "
40880	40884	40864	40864	I	0	" said Disko . "
40894	40927	40891	40892	Jason Olley	400	" When a man has lost his only son , his summer 's work , and his means of livelihood , in thirty counted seconds , it is hard to give consolation . "
40936	40949	40934	40934	they	1105	" said Tom Platt , fiddling helplessly with a dory - becket . "
40959	40970	40971	40971	I	0	" said Jason , wringing the wet from his beard . "
40984	40994	40934	40934	they	1105	" He rolled heavily to the rail , singing : "
41009	41010	41062	41062	Mebbe	1106	" "
41018	41044	41048	41048	you	0	" said Penn , as though he had a right to give orders . Their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute . "
41056	41061	41062	41062	Mebbe	1106	" said Jason submissively . "
41081	41094	41063	41063	I	0	" Penn led him into the cabin and slid the door behind . "
41100	41105	41106	41106	It	1107	" cried Uncle Salters . "
41144	41206	41140	41140	I	0	" They could hear Penn 's voice and Jason 's together . Then Penn 's went on alone , and Salters slipped off his hat , for Penn was praying . Presently the little man came up the steps , huge drops of sweat on his face , and looked at the crew . Dan was still sobbing by the wheel . "
41213	41217	41207	41207	He	297	" Salters groaned . "
41239	41252	41234	41234	he	297	" Penn spoke ; they could hear that it was to strangers . "
41257	41261	41253	41253	I	0	" said he . "
41331	41343	41314	41314	I	0	" Salters looked pleadingly at Penn to see if he remembered . "
41351	41361	41362	41362	Pshaw	249	" Penn asked suddenly . His mouth was twitching . "
41372	41375	41366	41366	You	284	" Salters began "
41382	41383	41384	41384	I	0	" "
41410	41411	41412	41412	I	0	" "
41424	41434	41418	41418	I	0	" cried Dan , and Harvey whimpered in sympathy . "
41439	41448	41418	41418	I	0	" said Disko , in a shaking voice . "
41470	41476	41477	41477	Ye	284	" Disko pointed to Salters . "
41483	41495	41477	41477	Ye	284	" cried the sea - farmer , twisting his hands together . "
41535	41536	41537	41537	You	284	" "
41552	41553	41554	41556	Mother av Mercy	401	" "
41558	41563	41554	41556	Mother av Mercy	401	" whispered Long Jack , "
41580	41597	41575	41575	He	515	" A schooner 's bell struck up alongside , and a voice hailed through the fog : "
41608	41609	41604	41606	the Jennie Cushman	399	" "
41616	41620	41610	41610	They	1128	" cried Penn . "
41632	41633	41610	41610	They	1128	" "
41639	41648	41635	41635	Jason	400	" Disko answered , but his voice quavered . "
41656	41657	41658	41658	We	1127	" "
41691	41692	41695	41695	he	400	" "
41697	41712	41695	41695	he	400	" The ' We 're Here 's ' heart - beats answered one another . "
41719	41755	41716	41717	young Olley	400	" the voice drawled . Penn raised his hands and said something in German . Harvey could have sworn that a bright sun was shining upon his lifted face ; but the drawl went on : "
41768	41769	41760	41760	You	1131	" "
41780	41784	41785	41785	I	0	" said Disko . "
41809	41836	41806	41807	young Olley	400	" It was the irrepressible Carrie Pitman , and a roar of unsteady laughter went up from the deck of the ' We 're Here ' . "
41898	41899	41891	41891	He	1812	" "
41909	41913	41900	41900	I	0	" said Troop . "
41949	41989	41944	41946	the old man	1812	" Penn waked him from his stupor of despair , and Tom Platt rowed him over . He went away without a word of thanks , not knowing what was to come ; and the fog closed over all . "
41993	42007	41944	41946	the old man	1812	" said Penn , drawing a deep breath as though about to preach . "
42010	42043	41944	41946	the old man	1812	" - the erect body sank like a sword driven home into the scabbard ; the light faded from the overbright eyes ; the voice returned to its usual pitiful little titter - "
42047	42052	41944	41946	the old man	1812	" said Pennsylvania Pratt , "
42070	42071	42054	42054	you	1131	" "
42086	42091	42084	42084	myself	0	" cried Salters promptly . "
42111	42122	42099	42099	ye	284	" The little fellow blushed and meekly followed Salters forward . "
42135	42147	42096	42096	Penn	284	" shouted Disko , and never was he more swiftly obeyed . "
42163	42185	42096	42096	Penn	284	" said Long Jack , when they were working through the fog once more , damp , dripping , and bewildered . "
42192	42200	42096	42096	Penn	284	" said Disko , at the wheel , "
42215	42216	42219	42219	he	1141	" "
42227	42231	42219	42219	he	1141	" sobbed Harvey . "
42335	42344	42331	42331	I	0	" They decided that Disko was entirely correct . "
42354	42359	42331	42331	I	0	" said Long Jack , "
42392	42393	42388	42388	ut	284	" "
42405	42412	42402	42403	a child	2225	" Salters replied , tiptoeing aft . "
42473	42474	42459	42459	I	0	" "
42482	42486	42459	42459	I	0	" said Disko . "
42491	42496	42497	42497	Penn	284	" Salters retorted quickly . "
42516	42696	42697	42697	He	1152	" They waited , those hungry men , three hours , till Penn reappeared with a smooth face and a blank mind . He said he believed that he had been dreaming . Then he wanted to know why they were so silent , and they could not tell him . Disko worked all hands mercilessly for the next three or four days ; and when they could not go out , turned them into the hold to stack the ship 's stores into smaller compass , to make more room for the fish . The packed mass ran from the cabin partition to the sliding door behind the foc'sle stove ; and Disko showed how there is great art in stowing cargo so as to bring a schooner to her best draft . The crew were thus kept lively till they recovered their spirits ; and Harvey was tickled with a rope 's end by Long Jack for being , as the Galway man said , ' sorrowful as a sick cat over fwhat could n't be helped . "
42815	42825	42809	42809	Disko	263	" Hurry , boys ! We 're in taown ! "
43044	43050	43052	43052	Harvey	250	" It 's a town , "
43054	43064	43052	43052	Harvey	250	" Disko was right . It IS a town ! "
43065	43071	43073	43073	Disko	263	" I 've seen smaller , "
43075	43091	43092	43092	He	263	" There 's about a thousand men here ; an ' yonder 's the Virgin . "
43163	43171	43173	43175	the Mary Chilton	403	" Jest in time fer the caplin , "
43177	43184	43186	43188	the King Philip	404	" ' Salt ' most wet ? "
43190	43204	43206	43208	the Henry Clay	405	" Hey , Tom Platt ! Come t ' supper to - night ? "
43598	43602	43604	43604	Dan	260	" Watch out ! "
43611	43638	43604	43604	Dan	260	" When I tell you dip , you dip . The caplin'll school any time from naow on . Where 'll we lay , Tom Platt ? "
43722	43727	43729	43730	twenty voices	1201	" Give her slack ! "
43732	43739	43729	43730	twenty voices	1201	" Let him shake it out . "
43740	43746	43748	43748	Harvey	250	" What 's the matter ? "
43759	43768	43748	43748	Harvey	250	" He 's anchored , is n't he ? "
43769	43784	43786	43786	Dan	260	" Anchored , sure enough , but his graound - tackle 's kinder shifty , "
43790	43806	43786	43786	Dan	260	" Whale 's fouled it . . . . Dip Harve ! Here they come ! "
44490	44500	44501	44503	Three hundred voices	1236	" Who 's the meanest man in the Fleet ? "
44507	44513	44501	44503	Three hundred voices	1236	" Nick Bra - ady . "
44521	44527	44501	44503	Three hundred voices	1236	" Who stole the lampwicks ? "
44534	44540	44557	44559	an unknown backbiter	1238	" Nick Bra - ady , "
44545	44554	44557	44559	an unknown backbiter	1238	" Who biled the salt bait fer soup ? "
44627	44642	44623	44625	a ' scrowger	1241	" they call it - in the Shoals . Naturally , he had been christened "
44645	44680	44681	44681	Jim	408	" ; and though he had hidden himself on the Georges ever since , he found his honours waiting for him full blown . They took it up in a sort of firecracker chorus : "
44694	44724	44692	44692	Jim	408	" That pleased everybody . And when a poetical Beverly man - he had been making it up all day , and talked about it for weeks - sang , "
44737	45095	45098	45098	ye	1242	" the dories felt that they were indeed fortunate . Then they had to ask that Beverly man how he was off for beans , because even poets must not have things all their own way . Every schooner and nearly every man got it in turn . Was there a careless or dirty cook anywhere ? The dories sang about him and his food . Was a schooner badly found ? The Fleet was told at full length . Had a man hooked tobacco from a mess - mate ? He was named in meeting ; the name tossed from roller to roller . Disko 's infallible judgments , Long Jack 's market - boat that he had sold years ago , Dan 's sweetheart oh , but Dan was an angry boy ! , Penn 's bad luck with dory - anchors , Salter 's views on manure , Manuel 's little slips from virtue ashore , and Harvey 's ladylike handling of the oar - all were laid before the public ; and as the fog fell around them in silvery sheets beneath the sun , the voices sounded like a bench of invisible judges pronouncing sentence . The dories roved and fished and squabbled till a swell underran the sea . Then they drew more apart to save their sides , and some one called that if the swell continued the Virgin would break . A reckless Galway man with his nephew denied this , hauled up anchor , and rowed over the very rock itself . Many voices called them to come away , while others dared them to hold on . As the smooth - backed rollers passed to the southward , they hove the dory high and high into the mist , and dropped her in ugly , sucking , dimpled water , where she spun round her anchor , within a foot or two of the hidden rock . It was playing with death for mere bravado ; and the boats looked on in uneasy silence till Long Jack rowed up behind his countrymen and quietly cut their roding . "
45104	45108	45098	45098	ye	1242	" he cried . "
45117	45197	45098	45098	ye	1242	" The men swore and tried to argue as the boat drifted ; but the next swell checked a little , like a man tripping on a carpet . There was a deep sob and a gathering roar , and the Virgin flung up a couple of acres of foaming water , white , furious , and ghastly over the shoal sea . Then all the boats greatly applauded Long Jack , and the Galway men held their tongue . "
45203	45215	45216	45216	She	1243	" said Dan , bobbing like a young seal at home . "
45248	45249	45245	45246	Tom Platt	274	" "
45285	45324	45277	45277	you	1242	" There came a sound of merriment where the fog lay thicker and the schooners were ringing their bells . A big bark nosed cautiously out of the mist , and was received with shouts and cries of , "
45331	45336	45337	45338	Another Frenchman	1245	" from the Irishry . "
45340	45344	45337	45338	Another Frenchman	1245	" said Harvey . "
45363	45367	45368	45368	We	1247	" said Dan . "
45395	45527	45528	45529	The Virgin	2533	" She was a black , buxom , eight - hundred - ton craft . Her mainsail was looped up , and her topsail flapped undecidedly in what little wind was moving . Now a bark is feminine beyond all other daughters of the sea , and this tall , hesitating creature , with her white and gilt figurehead , looked just like a bewildered woman half lifting her skirts to cross a muddy street under the jeers of bad little boys . That was very much her situation . She knew she was somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Virgin , had caught the roar of it , and was , therefore , asking her way . This is a small part of what she heard from the dancing dories : "
45556	45557	45561	45562	ye tarrapin	1254	" "
45575	45603	45569	45569	'em	1256	" Half a dozen voices together , in a most tuneful chorus , as her stern went down with a roll and a bubble into the troughs : "
45612	45613	45608	45608	she	2533	" "
45631	45632	45633	45633	Daown	410	" "
45642	45643	45633	45633	Daown	410	" "
45650	45651	45652	45652	Daown	410	" "
45659	45775	45652	45652	Daown	410	" Here the skipper lost his temper and said things . Instantly fishing was suspended to answer him , and he heard many curious facts about his boat and her next port of call . They asked him if he were insured ; and whence he had stolen his anchor , because , they said , it belonged to the Carrie Pitman ; they called his boat a mud - scow , and accused him of dumping garbage to frighten the fish ; they offered to tow him and charge it to his wife ; and one audacious youth slipped up almost under the counter , smacked it with his open palm , and yelled : "
45781	45819	45779	45779	Buck	309	" The cook emptied a pan of ashes on him , and he replied with cod - heads . The bark 's crew fired small coal from the galley , and the dories threatened to come aboard and "
45821	45997	45633	45633	Daown	410	" her . They would have warned her at once had she been in real peril ; but , seeing her well clear of the Virgin , they made the most of their chances . The fun was spoilt when the rock spoke again , a half - mile to windward , and the tormented bark set everything that would draw and went her ways ; but the dories felt that the honours lay with them . All that night the Virgin roared hoarsely ; and next morning , over an angry , white - headed sea , Harvey saw the Fleet with flickering masts waiting for a lead . Not a dory was hove out till ten o'clock , when the two Jeraulds of the Day 's Eye , imagining a lull which did not exist , set the example . In a minute half the boats were out and bobbing in the cockly swells , but Troop kept the ' We 're Heres ' at work dressing down . He saw no sense in "
45999	46073	46076	46076	dory	1258	" ; and as the storm grew that evening they had the pleasure of receiving wet strangers only too glad to make any refuge in the gale . The boys stood by the dory - tackles with lanterns , the men ready to haul , one eye cocked for the sweeping wave that would make them drop everything and hold on for dear life . Out of the dark would come a yell of "
46078	46439	46076	46076	dory	1258	" They would hook up and haul in a drenched man and a half - sunk boat , till their decks were littered down with nests of dories and the bunks were full . Five times in their watch did Harvey , with Dan , jump at the foregaff where it lay lashed on the boom , and cling with arms , legs , and teeth to rope and spar and sodden canvas as a big wave filled the decks . One dory was smashed to pieces , and the sea pitched the man head first on to the decks , cutting his forehead open ; and about dawn , when the racing seas glimmered white all along their cold edges , another man , blue and ghastly , crawled in with a broken hand , asking news of his brother . Seven extra mouths sat down to breakfast : A Swede ; a Chatham skipper ; a boy from Hancock , Maine ; one Duxbury , and three Provincetown men . There was a general sorting out among the Fleet next day ; and though no one said anything , all ate with better appetites when boat after boat reported full crews aboard . Only a couple of Portuguese and an old man from Gloucester were drowned , but many were cut or bruised ; and two schooners had parted their tackle and been blown to the southward , three days ' sail . A man died on a Frenchman - it was the same bark that had traded tobacco with the ' We 're Heres ' . She slipped away quite quietly one wet , white morning , moved to a patch of deep water , her sails all hanging anyhow , and Harvey saw the funeral through Disko 's spy - glass . It was only an oblong bundle slid overside . They did not seem to have any form of service , but in the night , at anchor , Harvey heard them across the star - powdered black water , singing something that sounded like a hymn . it went to a very slow tune . "
46470	46663	46076	46076	dory	1258	" Tom Platt visited her , because , he said , the dead man was his brother as a Freemason . It came out that a wave had doubled the poor fellow over the heel of the bowsprit and broken his back . The news spread like a flash , for , contrary to general custom , the Frenchman held an auction of the dead man 's kit , - he had no friends at St Malo or Miquelon , - and everything was spread out on the top of the house , from his red knitted cap to the leather belt with the sheath - knife at the back . Dan and Harvey were out on twenty - fathom water in the Hattie S. , and naturally rowed over to join the crowd . It was a long pull , and they stayed some little time while Dan bought the knife , which had a curious brass handle . When they dropped overside and pushed off into a drizzle of rain and a lop of sea , it occurred to them that they might get into trouble for neglecting the lines . "
46675	46707	46076	46076	dory	1258	" said Dan , shivering under his oilskins , and they rowed on into the heart of a white fog , which , as usual , dropped on them without warning . "
46721	46725	46731	46731	Harve	250	" he said . "
46772	46870	46763	46763	she	1263	" There was quite a little bubble at the bows , where some irresponsible Bank current held the dory full stretch on her rope ; but they could not see a boat 's length in any direction . Harvey turned up his collar and bunched himself over his reel with the air of a wearied navigator . Fog had no special terrors for him now . They fished a while in silence , and found the cod struck on well . Then Dan drew the sheath - knife and tested the edge of it on the gunwale . "
46876	46880	46763	46763	she	1263	" said Harvey . "
46889	46890	46883	46883	you	1264	" "
46900	46910	46911	46911	They	1265	" said Dan , jabbing with the bright blade . "
46939	46940	46930	46930	them	1265	" "
46957	46958	46959	46959	We	1268	" "
46993	46999	47002	47003	Double Thatcher	412	" And Dan began whistling : "
47032	47033	47020	47020	boys	2074	" "
47054	47055	47044	47044	He	1273	" "
47114	47115	47099	47101	the French captain	1276	" "
47125	47138	47120	47120	Heave	1279	" Harvey hauled in his fish , rebaited , and threw over . "
47156	47157	47148	47148	I	0	" "
47166	47173	47160	47160	I	0	" said Harvey , turning round . "
47198	47199	47191	47191	I	0	" "
47211	47217	47202	47202	D'you	1280	" said Dan , flushing . "
47283	47293	47252	47252	yours	0	" He held it out , belt and all . "
47306	47307	47301	47301	I	0	" "
47325	47331	47320	47320	you	0	" The temptation was irresistible . "
47340	47344	47332	47332	Dan	260	" said Harvey . "
47355	47356	47320	47320	you	0	" "
47363	47381	47320	47320	you	0	" said Dan , with a pleasant laugh ; and then , anxious to change the subject : "
47393	47394	47386	47386	your	0	" "
47400	47432	47433	47433	Concern	413	" said Harve , tugging . Before he pulled up he fastened the belt round him , and with deep delight heard the tip of the sheath click on the thwart . "
47437	47441	47442	47442	She	1284	" he cried . "
47463	47473	47442	47442	She	1284	" Dan reached over and gave a judgmatic tweak . "
47513	47534	47442	47442	She	1284	" They pulled together , making fast at each turn on the cleats , and the hidden weight rose sluggishly . "
47541	47646	47653	47653	him	1284	" shouted Dan , but the shout ended in a shrill , double shriek of horror , for out of the sea came the body of the dead Frenchman buried two days before ! The hook had caught him under the right armpit , and he swayed , erect and horrible , head and shoulders above water . His arms were tied to his side , and - he had no face . The boys fell over each other in a heap at the bottom of the dory , and there they lay while the thing bobbed alongside , held on the shortened line . "
47655	47672	47675	47675	Lord	1286	" said Harvey with quivering lips , as he fumbled at the clasp of the belt . "
47681	47685	47679	47679	Harve	250	" groaned Dan , "
47704	47705	47706	47706	I	0	" "
47718	47722	47723	47723	I	0	" cried Harvey . "
47732	47733	47723	47723	I	0	" "
47744	47765	47738	47738	He	1284	" Harvey sat up to unfasten the belt , facing the head that had no face under its streaming hair . "
47771	47816	47817	47817	He	1284	" he whispered to Dan , who slipped out his knife and cut the line , as Harvey flung the belt far overside . The body shot down with a plop , and Dan cautiously rose to his knees , whiter than the fog . "
47852	47853	47846	47846	he	1284	" "
47875	47876	47867	47867	he	1284	" "

48051	48055	48039	48039	you	250	" said Harvey . "
48064	48065	48066	48066	I	0	" "
48103	48115	48096	48096	I	0	" Dan said nothing , but threw his fish over again . "
48127	48133	48134	48134	I	0	" he murmured at last . "
48195	48196	48189	48189	He	1284	" "
48225	48226	48222	48223	Uncle Salters	276	" "
48242	48257	48222	48223	Uncle Salters	276	" Dan took the tin dinner - horn , but paused before he blew . "
48261	48265	48222	48223	Uncle Salters	276	" said Harvey . "
48275	48276	48281	48281	he	1284	" "
48373	48374	48375	48375	Dory	398	" "
48379	48401	48375	48375	Dory	398	" a muffled voice cried through the fog . They cowered again , and the horn dropped from Dan 's hand . "
48405	48409	48412	48413	the cook	628	" cried Harvey ; "
48415	48416	48412	48413	the cook	628	" "
48430	48434	48420	48420	me	0	" said Dan . "
48443	48444	48445	48445	Dan	260	" "
48461	48462	48459	48459	Haarveee	414	" "
48467	48493	48463	48463	We	1308	" sung both boys together . They heard oars , but could see nothing till the cook , shining and dripping , rowed into them . "
48498	48502	48503	48503	You	260	" said he . "
48510	48511	48503	48503	You	260	" "
48526	48530	48503	48503	You	260	" said Dan . "
48547	48562	48539	48539	We	1308	" As the cook passed them a line , Dan told him the tale . "
48571	48786	48565	48565	He	1310	" was all he said at the end . Never had the little rocking ' We 're Here ' looked so deliciously home - like as when the cook , born and bred in fogs , rowed them back to her . There was a warm glow of light from the cabin and a satisfying smell of food forward , and it was heavenly to hear Disko and the others , all quite alive and solid , leaning over the rail and promising them a first - class pounding . But the cook was a black ; master of strategy . He did not get the dories aboard till he had given the more striking points of the tale , explaining as he backed and bumped round the counter how Harvey was the mascot to destroy any possible bad luck . So the boys came override as rather uncanny heroes , and every one asked them questions instead of pounding them for making trouble . Little Penn delivered quite a speech on the folly of superstitions ; but public opinion was against him and in favour of Long Jack , who told the most excruciating ghost - stories , till nearly midnight . Under that influence no one except Salters and Penn said anything about "
48789	48873	48565	48565	He	1310	" when the cook put a lighted candle , a cake of flour and water , and a pinch of salt on a shingle , and floated them out astern to keep the Frenchman quiet in case he was still restless . Dan lit the candle because he had bought the belt , and the cook grunted and muttered charms as long as he could see the ducking point of flame . Said Harvey to Dan , as they turned in after watch : "
48881	48882	48565	48565	He	1310	" "
48953	49135	48944	48944	I	0	" Next morning all , except the cook , were rather ashamed of the ceremonies , and went to work double tides , speaking gruffly to one another . The ' We 're Here ' was racing neck and neck for her last few loads against the Parry Norman ; and so close was the struggle that the Fleet took side and betted tobacco . All hands worked at the lines or dressing - down till they fell asleep where they stood - beginning before dawn and ending when it was too dark to see . They even used the cook as pitcher , and turned Harvey into the hold to pass salt , while Dan helped to dress down . Luckily a Parry Norman man sprained his ankle falling down the foc'sle , and the ' We 're Heres ' gained . Harvey could not see how one more fish could be crammed into her , but Disko and Tom Platt stowed and stowed , and planked the mass down with big stones from the ballast , and there was always "
49142	49321	48944	48944	I	0	" Disko did not tell them when all the salt was wetted . He rolled to the lazarette aft the cabin and began hauling out the big mainsail . This was at ten in the morning . The riding - sail was down and the main- and topsail were up by noon , and dories came alongside with letters for home , envying their good fortune . At last she cleared decks , hoisted her flag , - as is the right of the first boat off the Banks , - up - anchored , and began to move . Disko pretended that he wished to accomodate folk who had not sent in their mail , and so worked her gracefully in and out among the schooners . In reality , that was his little triumphant procession , and for the fifth year running it showed what kind of mariner he was . Dan 's accordion and Tom Platt 's fiddle supplied the music of the magic verse you must not sing till all the salt is wet : "
49393	49509	49510	49510	boy	2073	" The last letters pitched on deck wrapped round pieces of coal , and the Gloucester men shouted messages to their wives and womenfolks and owners , while the ' We 're Here ' finished the musical ride through the Fleet , her headsails quivering like a man 's hand when he raises it to say good - by . Harvey very soon discovered that the ' We 're Here ' , with her riding - sail , strolling from berth to berth , and the ' We 're Here ' headed west by south under home canvas , were two very different boats . There was a bite and kick to the wheel even in "
49512	49707	49510	49510	boy	2073	" weather ; he could feel the dead weight in the hold flung forward mightily across the surges , and the streaming line of bubbles overside made his eyes dizzy . Disko kept them busy fiddling with the sails ; and when those were flattened like a racing yacht 's , Dan had to wait on the big topsail , which was put over by hand every time she went about . In spare moments they pumped , for the packed fish dripped brine , which does not improve a cargo . But since there was no fishing , Harvey had time to look at the sea from another point of view . The low - sided schooner was naturally on most intimate terms with her surroundings . They saw little of the horizon save when she topped a swell ; and usually she was elbowing , fidgeting , and coasting her steadfast way through gray , gray - blue , or black hollows laced across and across with streaks of shivering foam ; or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of some bigger water - hill . It was as if she said : "
49727	50125	50126	50126	Hattie	294	" Then she would slide away chuckling softly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle . The dullest of folk can not see this kind of thing hour after hour through long days without noticing it ; and Harvey , being anything but dull , began to comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wave - tops turning over with a sound of incessant tearing ; the hurry of the winds working across open spaces and herding the purple - blue cloud - shadows ; the splendid upheaval of the red sunrise ; the folding and packing away of the morning mists , wall after wall withdrawn across the white floors ; the salty glare and blaze of noon ; the kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead , flat square miles ; the chilly blackening of everything at the day 's end ; and the million wrinkles of the sea under the moonlight , when the jib - boom solemnly poked at the low stars , and Harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook . But the best fun was when the boys were put on the wheel together , Tom Platt within hail , and she cuddled her lee - rail down to the crashing blue , and kept a little home - made rainbow arching unbroken over her windlass . Then the jaws of the booms whined against the masts , and the sheets creaked , and the sails filled with roaring ; and when she slid into a hollow she trampled like a woman tripped in her own silk dress , and came out , her jib wet half - way up , yearning and peering for the tall twin - lights of Thatcher 's Island . They left the cold gray of the Bank sea , saw the lumber - ships making for Quebec by the Straits of St. Lawrence , with the Jersey salt - brigs from Spain and Sicily ; found a friendly northeaster off Artimon Bank that drove them within view of the East light of Sable Island , - a sight Disko did not linger over , - and stayed with them past Western and Le Have , to the northern fringe of George 's . From there they picked up the deeper water , and let her go merrily . "
50133	50139	50140	50140	Hattie	294	" Dan confided to Harvey . "
50190	50191	50180	50180	you	418	" "
50195	50208	50180	50180	you	418	" said Harvey . His eyebrows were all white with dried spray . "
50309	50428	50305	50305	Port	419	" The hesitating sails flapped and lurched in the close air as the deep smoothed out , blue and oily , round them . When they whistled for a wind only the rain came in spiky rods , bubbling and drumming , and behind the rain the thunder and the lightning of mid - August . They lay on the deck with bare feet and arms , telling one another what they would order at their first meal ashore ; for now the land was in plain sight . A Gloucester swordfish - boat drifted alongside , a man in the little pulpit on the bowsprit flourished his harpoon , his bare head plastered down with the wet . "
50434	50449	50450	50450	Wouverman	420	" he sang cheerily , as though he were watch on a big liner . "
50467	50619	50464	50465	the Fleet	2092	" Disko shouted it and passed on , while the wild summer storm pounded overhead and the lightning flickered along the capes from four different quarters at once . It gave the low circle of hills round Gloucester Harbor , Ten Pound Island , the fish - sheds , with the broken line of house - roofs , and each spar and buoy on the water , in blinding photographs that came and went a dozen times to the minute as the ' We 're Here ' crawled in on half - flood , and the whistling - buoy moaned and mourned behind her . Then the storm died out in long , separated , vicious dags of blue - white flame , followed by a single roar like the roar of a mortar - battery , and the shaken air tingled under the stars as it got back to silence . "
50626	50635	50464	50465	the Fleet	2092	" said Disko , suddenly , pointing upward . "
50640	50645	50646	50646	Otto	261	" said Long Jack . "
50659	50660	50651	50651	They	1330	" "
50675	50676	50673	50673	he	261	" "
50688	50689	50677	50677	Girl	1334	" "
50694	51157	50692	50692	her	1334	" said Long Jack , and lowered the little flag half - mast for the sake of Otto , swept overboard in a gale off Le Have three months before . Disko wiped the wet from his eyes and led the ' We 're Here ' to Wouverman 's wharf , giving his orders in whispers , while she swung round moored tugs and night - watchmen hailed her from the ends of inky - black piers . Over and above the darkness and the mystery of the procession , Harvey could feel the land close round him once more , with all its thousands of people asleep , and the smell of earth after rain , and the familiar noise of a switching - engine coughing to herself in a freight - yard ; and all those things made his heart beat and his throat dry up as he stood by the foresheet . They heard the anchor - watch snoring on a lighthouse - tug , nosed into a pocket of darkness where a lantern glimmered on either side ; somebody waked with a grunt , threw them a rope , and they made fast to a silent wharf flanked with great iron - roofed sheds fall of warm emptiness , and lay there without a sound . Then Harvey sat down by the wheel , and sobbed and sobbed as though his heart would break , and a tall woman who had been sitting on a weigh - scale dropped down into the schooner and kissed Dan once on the cheek ; for she was his mother , and she had seen the ' We 're Here ' by the lightning flashes . She took no notice of Harvey till he had recovered himself a little and Disko had told her his story . Then they went to Disko 's house together as the dawn was breaking ; and until the telegraph office was open and he could wire his folk , Harvey Cheyne was perhaps the loneliest boy in all America . But the curious thing was that Disko and Dan seemed to think none the worse of him for crying . Wouverman was not ready for Disko 's prices till Disko , sure that the ' We 're Here ' was at least a week ahead of any other Gloucester boat , had given him a few days to swallow them ; so all hands played about the streets , and Long Jack stopped the Rocky Neck trolley , on principle , as he said , till the conductor let him ride free . But Dan went about with his freckled nose in the air , bung - full of mystery and most haughty to his family . "
51173	51179	51168	51168	you	260	" said Troop , pensively . "
51195	51196	51187	51187	you	260	" "
51208	51223	51204	51204	he	1336	" said Uncle Salters , sourly . He and Penn boarded with the Troops . "
51226	51248	51249	51249	Dan	260	" said Dan , shuffling with the accordion round the backyard , ready to leap the fence if the enemy advanced . "
51364	51382	51383	51383	You	260	" Disko was smoking in all his shore dignity and a pair of beautiful carpet - slippers . "
51421	51425	51393	51393	You	260	" said he . "
51439	51443	51444	51444	You	260	" Dan replied . "
51450	51506	51444	51444	You	260	" He and Harvey went out on the trolley to East Gloucester , where they tramped through the bayberry bushes to the lighthouse , and lay down on the big red boulders and laughed themselves hungry . Harvey had shown Dan a telegram , and the two swore to keep silence till the shell burst . "
51511	51522	51509	51509	folk	1955	" said Dan , with an unruffled face after supper . "
51571	51572	51569	51569	Dad	1947	" "
51579	51583	51575	51575	I	0	" said Salters . "
51593	51764	51575	51575	I	0	" CHAPTER IX Whatever his private sorrows may be , a multimillionaire , like any other workingman , should keep abreast of his business . Harvey Cheyne , senior , had gone East late in June to meet a woman broken down , half mad , who dreamed day and night of her son drowning in the gray seas . He had surrounded her with doctors , trained nurses , massage - women , and even faith - cure companions , but they were useless . Mrs. Cheyne lay still and moaned , or talked of her boy by the hour together to any one who would listen . Hope she had none , and who could offer it ? All she needed was assurance that drowning did not hurt ; and her husband watched to guard lest she should make the experiment . Of his own sorrow he spoke little - hardly realized the depth of it till he caught himself asking the calendar on his writing - desk , "
51773	52306	51575	51575	I	0	" There had always lain a pleasant notion at the back of his head that , some day , when he had rounded off everything and the boy had left college , he would take his son to his heart and lead him into his possessions . Then that boy , he argued , as busy fathers do , would instantly become his companion , partner , and ally , and there would follow splendid years of great works carried out together - the old head backing the young fire . Now his boy was dead - lost at sea , as it might have been a Swede sailor from one of Cheyne 's big teaships ; the wife dying , or worse ; he himself was trodden down by platoons of women and doctors and maids and attendants ; worried almost beyond endurance by the shift and change of her poor restless whims ; hopeless , with no heart to meet his many enemies . He had taken the wife to his raw new palace in San Diego , where she and her people occupied a wing of great price , and Cheyne , in a veranda - room , between a secretary and a typewriter , who was also a telegraphist , toiled along wearily from day to day . There was a war of rates among four Western railroads in which he was supposed to be interested ; a devastating strike had developed in his lumber camps in Oregon , and the legislature of the State of California , which has no love for its makers , was preparing open war against him . Ordinarily he would have accepted battle ere it was offered , and have waged a pleasant and unscrupulous campaign . But now he sat limply , his soft black hat pushed forward on to his nose , his big body shrunk inside his loose clothes , staring at his boots or the Chinese junks in the bay , and assenting absently to the secretary 's questions as he opened the Saturday mail . Cheyne was wondering how much it would cost to drop everything and pull out . He carried huge insurances , could buy himself royal annuities , and between one of his places in Colorado and a little society that would do the wife good , say in Washington and the South Carolina islands , a man might forget plans that had come to nothing . On the other hand - The click of the typewriter stopped ; the girl was looking at the secretary , who had turned white . He passed Cheyne a telegram repeated from San Francisco : Picked up by fishing schooner ' We 're Here ' having fallen off boat great times on Banks fishing all well waiting Gloucester Mass care Disko Troop for money or orders wire what shall do and how is Mama Harvey N. Cheyne . The father let it fall , laid his head down on the roller - top of the shut desk , and breathed heavily . The secretary ran for Mrs. Cheyne 's doctor who found Cheyne pacing to and fro . "
52336	52340	52328	52328	I	0	" he cried . "
52344	52349	52328	52328	I	0	" said the doctor . "
52361	52387	52388	52388	You	1348	" He thought of the struggling New York practice he had dropped at Cheyne 's imperious bidding , and returned the telegram with a sigh . "
52401	52402	52452	52452	she	1349	" "
52408	52415	52416	52416	Detection	423	" said the doctor , coolly . "
52428	52449	52423	52424	the boy	1817	" Enter a French maid , impudently , as an indispensable one who is kept on only by large wages . "
52466	52500	52460	52460	She	1349	" The master of thirty millions bowed his head meekly and followed Suzanne ; and a thin , high voice on the upper landing of the great white - wood square staircase cried : "
52509	52535	52452	52452	she	1349	" No doors could keep out the shriek that rang through the echoing house a moment later , when her husband blurted out the news . "
52542	52553	52452	52452	she	1349	" said the doctor , serenely , to the typewriter . "
52576	52577	52573	52574	Miss Kinzey	425	" "
52591	52636	52585	52589	a heap to do first	1352	" Miss Kinzey was from Milwaukee , somewhat direct of speech ; and as her fancy leaned towards the secretary , she divined there was work in hand . He was looking earnestly at the vast roller - map of America on the wall . "
52657	52664	52665	52665	I	0	" shouted Cheyne down the staircase . "
52669	52756	52665	52665	I	0	" The secretary turned to the typewriter , and their eyes met out of that was born a story - nothing to do with this story . She looked inquiringly , doubtful of his resources . He signed to her to move to the Morse as a general brings brigades into action . Then he swept his hand musician - wise through his hair , regarded the ceiling , and set to work , while Miss Kinzey 's white fingers called up the Continent of America . "
52779	52780	52774	52774	she	268	" "
52783	52797	52774	52774	she	268	" Miss Kinzey nodded between clicks as the secretary looked at his watch . "
52835	52842	52774	52774	she	268	" Click - lick - lick ! "
52849	52850	52845	52845	you	1355	" "
52943	52954	52958	52958	Canniff	427	" Miss Kinzey nodded , and the secretary went on . "
53042	53043	53040	53040	Toucey	428	" "
53056	53064	53040	53040	Toucey	428	" with a toss of the head . "
53120	53121	53117	53118	the managers	1361	" "
53126	53148	53117	53118	the managers	1361	" said Miss Kinzey , with a look of admiration . This was the kind of man she understood and appreciated . "
53153	53159	53117	53118	the managers	1361	" said Milsom , modestly . "
53195	53196	53237	53237	Cheyne	262	" "
53218	53226	53209	53209	himself	431	" Miss Kinzey suggested , recovering herself . "
53244	53245	53237	53237	Cheyne	262	" "
53264	53265	53257	53257	You	1368	" "
53270	53313	53266	53266	I	0	" When he returned with the father 's message bidding Harvey meet them in Boston at an appointed hour , he found Miss Kinzey laughing over the keys . Then Milsom laughed too , for the frantic clicks from Los Angeles ran : "
53330	53343	53266	53266	I	0	" Ten minutes later Chicago appealed to Miss Kinzey in these words : "
53364	53384	53356	53356	We	1366	" This was capped by a message from Topeka and wherein Topeka was concerned even Milsom could not guess : "
53396	53414	53415	53415	They	1371	" Cheyne smiled grimly at the consternation of his enemies when the telegrams were laid before him . "
53477	53498	53434	53434	Milsom	426	" So the truth was told . Miss Kinzey clicked in the sentiment while the secretary added the memorable quotation , "
53504	53709	53434	53434	Milsom	426	" and in board rooms two thousand miles away the representatives of sixty - three million dollars ' worth of variously manipulated railroad interests breathed more freely . Cheyne was flying to meet the only son , so miraculously restored to him . The bear was seeking his cub , not the bulls . Hard men who had their knives drawn to fight for their financial lives put away the weapons and wished him God - speed , while half a dozen panic - smitten tin - pot toads perked up their heads and spoke of the wonderful things they would have done had not Cheyne buried the hatchet . It was a busy week - end among the wires ; for now that their anxiety was removed , men and cities hastened to accommodate . Los Angeles called to San Diego and Barstow that the Southern California engineers might know and be ready in their lonely roundhouses ; Barstow passed the word to the Atlantic and Pacific ; and Albuquerque flung it the whole length of the Atchinson , Topeka , and Santa Fe management , even into Chicago . An engine , combination - car with crew , and the great and gilded "
53711	53717	53434	53434	Milsom	426	" private car were to be "
53719	53803	53805	53806	the men	1868	" over those two thousand three hundred and fifty miles . The train would take precedence of one hundred and seventy - seven others meeting and passing ; despatchers and crews of every one of those said trains must be notified . Sixteen locomotives , sixteen engineers , and sixteen firemen would be needed - each and every one the best available . Two and one half minutes would be allowed for changing engines , three for watering , and two for coaling . "
53829	53834	53805	53806	the men	1868	" sang the wires . "
53878	53879	53805	53806	the men	1868	" "
53885	53902	53805	53806	the men	1868	" said Cheyne , as they rolled out of San Diego in the dawn of Sunday . "
53964	53965	53966	53966	I	0	" "
53995	53996	54012	54012	you	250	" "
54015	54016	54012	54012	you	250	" "
54029	54236	54237	54237	her	1380	" The six - foot drivers were hammering their way to San Bernardino and the Mohave wastes , but this was no grade for speed . That would come later . The heat of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they turned east to the Needles and the Colorado River . The car cracked in the utter drouth and glare , and they put crushed ice to Mrs. Cheyne 's neck , and toiled up the long , long grades , past Ash Fork , towards Flagstaff , where the forests and quarries are , under the dry , remote skies . The needle of the speed - indicator flicked and wagged to and fro ; the cinders rattled on the roof , and a whirl of dust sucked after the whirling wheels . The crew of the combination sat on their bunks , panting in their shirtsleeves , and Cheyne found himself among them shouting old , old stories of the railroad that every trainman knows , above the roar of the car . He told them about his son , and how the sea had given up its dead , and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him ; asked after "
54242	54252	54237	54237	her	1380	" and whether she could stand it if the engineer "
54259	54274	54237	54237	her	1380	" and Cheyne thought she could . Accordingly , the great fire - horse was "
54278	54329	54237	54237	her	1380	" from Flagstaff to Winslow , till a division superintendent protested . But Mrs. Cheyne , in the boudoir stateroom , where the French maid , sallow - white with fear , clung to the silver door - handle , only moaned a little and begged her husband to bid them "
54332	54799	54237	54237	her	1380	" And so they dropped the dry sands and moon - struck rocks of Arizona behind them , and grilled on till the crash of the couplings and the wheeze of the brake - hose told them they were at Coolidge by the Continental Divide . Three bold and experienced men - cool , confident , and dry when they began ; white , quivering , and wet when they finished their trick at those terrible wheels - swung her over the great lift from Albuquerque to Glorietta and beyond Springer , up and up to the Raton Tunnel on the State line , whence they dropped rocking into La Junta , had sight of the Arkansaw , and tore down the long slope to Dodge City , where Cheyne took comfort once again from setting his watch an hour ahead . There was very little talk in the car . The secretary and typewriter sat together on the stamped Spanish - leather cushions by the plate - glass observation - window at the rear end , watching the surge and ripple of the ties crowded back behind them , and , it is believed , making notes of the scenery . Cheyne moved nervously between his own extravagant gorgeousness and the naked necessity of the combination , an unlit cigar in his teeth , till the pitying crews forgot that he was their tribal enemy , and did their best to entertain him . At night the bunched electrics lit up that distressful palace of all the luxuries , and they fared sumptuously , swinging on through the emptiness of abject desolation . Now they heard the swish of a water - tank , and the guttural voice of a Chinaman , the click - clink of hammers that tested the Krupp steel wheels , and the oath of a tramp chased off the rear - platform ; now the solid crash of coal shot into the tender ; and now a beating back of noises as they flew past a waiting train . Now they looked out into great abysses , a trestle purring beneath their tread , or up to rocks that barred out half the stars . Now scour and ravine changed and rolled back to jagged mountains on the horizon 's edge , and now broke into hills lower and lower , till at last came the true plains . At Dodge City an unknown hand threw in a copy of a Kansas paper containing some sort of an interview with Harvey , who had evidently fallen in with an enterprising reporter , telegraphed on from Boston . The joyful journalese revealed that it was beyond question their boy , and it soothed Mrs. Cheyne for a while . Her one word "
54801	54852	54853	54853	I	0	" was conveyed by the crews to the engineers at Nickerson , Topeka , and Marceline , where the grades are easy , and they brushed the Continent behind them . Towns and villages were close together now , and a man could feel here that he moved among people . "
54871	54872	54876	54876	we	1381	" "
54899	54900	54901	54901	I	0	" "
54922	55108	54906	54906	I	0	" Cheyne sat down and read the dial for her there were some miles which stand for records to this day , but the seventy - foot car never changed its long steamer - like roll , moving through the heat with the hum of a giant bee . Yet the speed was not enough for Mrs. Cheyne ; and the heat , the remorseless August heat , was making her giddy ; the clock - hands would not move , and when , oh , when would they be in Chicago ? It is not true that , as they changed engines at Fort Madison , Cheyne passed over to the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers an endowment sufficient to enable them to fight him and his fellows on equal terms for evermore . He paid his obligations to engineers and firemen as he believed they deserved , and only his bank knows what he gave the crews who had sympathized with him . It is on record that the last crew took entire charge of switching operations at Sixteenth Street , because ' she "

55203	55206	55208	55209	the Atchinson	177	" Pshaw ! "
55222	55297	55208	55209	the Atchinson	177	" we were n't runnin ' for a record . Harvey Cheyne 's wife , she were sick back , an ' we did n't want to jounce her . ' Come to think of it , our runnin ' time from San Diego to Chicago was 57.54 . You can tell that to them Eastern way - trains . When we 're tryin ' for a record , we 'll let you know . "
55328	55330	55324	55325	The Limited	1391	" Constance "
55586	55593	55575	55630	an unsatisfied , dough - faced youth who took delight in " calling down the old man , " and reducing his mother to tears - such a person as adds to the gaiety of public rooms and hotel piazzas , where the ingenuous young of the wealthy play with or revile the bell - boys	1407	" calling down the old man , "
55699	55707	55709	55709	Cheyne	250	" Some one 's been coercing him , "
55711	55732	55709	55709	Cheyne	250	" Now Constance would never have allowed that . Do n't see as Europe could have done it any better . "
55733	55749	55750	55751	the mother	1416	" But why did n't you tell this man , Troop , who you were ? "
55764	55788	55750	55751	the mother	1416	" Disko Troop , dear . The best man that ever walked a deck . I do n't care who the next is . "
55789	55815	55709	55709	Cheyne	250	" Why did n't you tell him to put you ashore ? You know Papa would have made it up to him ten times over . "
55816	55847	55709	55709	Cheyne	250	" I know it ; but he thought I was crazy . I 'm afraid I called him a thief because I could n't find the bills in my pocket . "
55848	55861	55863	55864	Mrs. Cheyne	262	" A sailor found them by the flagstaff that - that night , "
55866	55914	55863	55864	Mrs. Cheyne	262	" That explains it , then . I do n't blame Troop any . I just said I would n't work - on a Banker , too - and of course he hit me on the nose , and oh ! I bled like a stuck hog . "
55915	55927	55709	55709	Cheyne	250	" My poor darling ! They must have abused you horribly . "
55928	55942	55943	55943	Cheyne	262	" Dunno quite . Well , after that , I saw a light . "
55976	56148	55963	55963	He	1417	" And the old man gave me ten and a half a month ; he 's paid me half now ; and I took hold with Dan and pitched right in . I ca n't do a man 's work yet . But I can handle a dory ' most as well as Dan , and I do n't get rattled in a fog - much ; and I can take my trick in light winds - that 's steering , dear - and I can ' most bait up a trawl , and I know my ropes , of course ; and I can pitch fish till the cows come home , and I 'm great on old Josephus , and I 'll show you how I can clear coffee with a piece of fish - skin , and - I think I 'll have another cup , please . Say , you 've no notion what a heap of work there is in ten and a half a month ! "
56149	56161	56163	56163	Cheyne	262	" I began with eight and a half , my son , "
56165	56176	55963	55963	He	1417	" That so ? You never told me , sir . "
56177	56204	55963	55963	He	1417	" You never asked , Harve . I 'll tell you about it some day , if you care to listen . Try a stuffed olive . "
56205	56324	55963	55963	He	1417	" Troop says the most interesting thing in the world is to find out how the next man gets his vittles . It 's great to have a trimmed - up meal again . We were well fed , though . But mug on the Banks . Disko fed us first - class . He 's a great man . And Dan - that 's his son - Dan 's my partner . And there 's Uncle Salters and his manures , an ' he reads Josephus . He 's sure I 'm crazy yet . And there 's poor little Penn , and he is crazy . You must n't talk to him about Johnstown , because - "
56379	56380	56366	56366	He	272	" "
56391	56396	56381	56381	I	0	" said Mrs. Cheyne . "
56421	56464	56465	56465	You	1419	" That was too much for Mrs. Cheyne , who began to think of her visions of a corpse rocking on the salty seas . She went to her stateroom , and Harvey curled up beside his father , explaining his indebtedness . "
56491	56492	56481	56481	They	2799	" "
56504	56508	56513	56513	he	263	" said Harvey . "
56640	56641	56635	56635	They	1428	" "
56655	56656	56657	56657	I	0	" "
56677	56695	56669	56669	I	0	" He looked at the greasy notebook with an air of importance that made his father choke . "
56716	56717	56669	56669	I	0	" "
56722	56733	56719	56720	a substitute	1430	" suggested Cheyne , to see what Harvey would say . "
56767	56768	56762	56765	a mighty just man	1437	" "
56790	56803	56786	56786	you	1835	" Harvey looked at the clock , which marked twenty past eleven . "
56831	56832	56818	56818	They	1440	" "
56864	56927	56928	56928	One	2031	" Harvey spread himself on the sofa , kicked off his boots , and was asleep before his father could shade the electrics . Cheyne sat watching the young face under the shadow of the arm thrown over the forehead , and among many things that occurred to him was the notion that he might perhaps have been neglectful as a father . "
56940	56944	56932	56932	one	2031	" he said . "
56993	57005	56986	56986	I	0	" Morning brought a fresh sea breeze through the windows , the "
57007	57027	57029	57029	he	1446	" was side - tracked among freight - cars at Gloucester , and Harvey had gone to his business . "
57038	57044	57045	57045	We	1447	" the mother said bitterly . "
57070	57075	57060	57060	You	1448	" said the father . "
57085	57086	57089	57093	the man that hired him	1450	" "
57103	57207	57096	57096	He	1446	" They went down between the stores full of fishermen 's oilskins to Wouverman 's wharf where the ' We 're Here ' rode high , her Bank flag still flying , all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light . Disko stood by the main hatch superintending Manuel , Penn , and Uncle Salters at the tackle . Dan was swinging the loaded baskets inboard as Long Jack and Tom Platt filled them , and Harvey , with a notebook , represented the skipper 's interests before the clerk of the scales on the salt - sprinkled wharf - edge . "
57210	57216	57096	57096	He	1446	" cried the voices below . "
57219	57223	57096	57096	He	1446	" cried Disko . "
57226	57230	57096	57096	He	1446	" said Manuel . "
57233	57292	57096	57096	He	1446	" said Dan , swinging the basket . Then they heard Harvey 's voice , clear and fresh , checking the weights . The last of the fish had been whipped out , and Harvey leaped from the string - piece six feet to a ratline , as the shortest way to hand Disko the tally , shouting , "
57303	57304	57310	57310	Harve	250	" "
57312	57316	57310	57310	Harve	250	" said Disko . "
57345	57346	57337	57337	I	0	" "
57382	57383	57367	57367	you	250	" "
57389	57410	57386	57387	that boy	1809	" said Cheyne to Dan , well used to all manner of questions from those idle imbeciles called summer boarders . "
57420	57425	57426	57426	We	1453	" was the answer . "
57462	57463	57450	57450	He	1809	" "
57470	57471	57472	57472	Ye	1460	" "

57534	57561	57522	57522	Mama	250	" The woman who could not lift her head a week ago scrambled down the ladder , and stood aghast amid the mess and tangle aft . "
57569	57573	57576	57576	ye	1460	" said Disko . "
57580	57581	57576	57576	ye	1460	" "
57679	57680	57663	57663	his	250	" "
57686	57702	57663	57663	his	250	" said Mrs. Cheyne , sitting on a yellow locker and surveying the disorderly bunks . "
57750	57751	57740	57740	I	0	" "
57760	57769	57770	57770	He	250	" said Uncle Salters , descending the steps . "
57810	57835	57836	57836	Tom	274	" Dan in the meantime , profiting by dark hints from Harvey early that morning , was executing a war - dance on deck . "
57840	57847	57838	57838	Tom	274	" he whispered down the hatch . "
57894	57895	57883	57883	Harve	250	" "
57899	57914	57915	57915	D'ye	1473	" said Long Jack , climbing out covered with salt and fish - skin . "
57933	57934	57935	57935	I	0	" "
57941	57945	57935	57935	I	0	" said Dan . "
57956	57969	57950	57950	Dad	259	" They came delightedly , just in time to hear Cheyne say : "
57986	58017	57981	57981	he	250	" Disko 's jaw fell , - Long Jack always vowed that he heard the click of it , - and he stared alternately at the man and the woman . "
58034	58035	58030	58030	we	1476	" "
58041	58045	58046	58046	He	250	" said Dan . "
58051	58052	58046	58046	He	250	" "
58061	58074	58079	58079	he	250	" Dan looked at his father with a hurricane of irreverent winks . "
58095	58100	58079	58079	he	250	" said Long Jack . "
58106	58107	58079	58079	he	250	" "
58111	58115	58079	58079	he	250	" said Cheyne . "
58121	58122	58119	58119	Mama	250	" "
58137	58146	58123	58123	He	250	" said the mother . Long Jack whistled . "
58151	58160	58161	58161	I	0	" said he , and that was all . "
58178	58193	58194	58194	I	0	" said Disko , as though the words were being windlassed out of him . "
58222	58223	58225	58225	he	250	" "
58229	58230	58225	58225	he	250	" "
58244	58255	58239	58239	I	0	" This with a somewhat anxious glance at Mrs. Cheyne . "
58260	58264	58239	58239	I	0	" Cheyne replied . "
58281	58282	58283	58283	I	0	" "

58326	58411	58323	58324	Mr. Troop	439	" Mrs. Cheyne had been looking at the faces - Disko 's ivory - yellow , hairless , iron countenance ; Uncle Salters 's , with its rim of agricultural hair ; Penn 's bewildered simplicity ; Manuel 's quiet smile ; Long Jack 's grin of delight , and Tom Platt 's scar . Rough , by her standards , they certainly were ; but she had a mother 's wits in her eyes , and she rose with out - stretched hands . "
58421	58428	58323	58324	Mr. Troop	439	" said she , half sobbing . "
58442	58443	58429	58429	I	0	" "
58453	58504	58429	58429	I	0	" said Long Jack . Disko introduced them all in due form . The captain of an old - time Chinaman could have done no better , and Mrs. Cheyne babbled incoherently . She nearly threw herself into Manuel 's arms when she understood that he had first found Harvey . "
58513	58518	58508	58508	I	0	" said poor Manuel . "
58555	58556	58558	58558	he	1487	" "
58566	58697	58558	58558	he	1487	" she cried . Dan was already sufficiently pink , but he turned a rich crimson when Mrs. Cheyne kissed him on both cheeks before the assembly . Then they led her forward to show her the foc'sle , at which she wept again , and must needs go down to see Harvey 's identical bunk , and there she found the nigger cook cleaning up the stove , and he nodded as though she were some one he had expected to meet for years . They tried , two at a time , to explain the boat 's daily life to her , and she sat by the pawl - post , her gloved hands on the greasy table , laughing with trembling lips and crying with dancing eyes . "
58713	58721	58726	58726	she	1493	" said Long Jack to Tom Platt . "
58735	58736	58726	58726	she	1493	" "
58739	58744	58726	58726	she	1493	" sneered Tom Platt . "

58818	58827	58813	58813	Harvey	250	" said Penn , slowly , to Cheyne . "
58835	58845	58833	58833	God	441	" the big millionaire replied , stooping down tenderly . "
58882	58883	58878	58878	God	441	" "
58886	58899	58900	58900	I	0	" cried Harvey , looking down upon them benignly from the wharf . "
58910	58921	58906	58906	I	0	" said Disko , swiftly , holding up a hand . "
58937	58938	58929	58929	Ye	250	" "
58948	58956	58940	58940	I	0	" said Dan , under his breath . "
58968	58969	58966	58966	ye	250	" "
58994	58995	58982	58982	you	250	" "
59004	59014	59015	59015	You	250	" ; and he counted out the remaining dollars . "
59041	59061	59035	59035	you	250	" Here Disko brought himself up . He did not quite see where the sentence was going to end . "
59068	59074	59026	59026	you	250	" suggested Dan , wickedly . "
59086	59129	59079	59079	I	0	" said Harvey . Cheyne stayed to talk with Disko , but the others made a procession to the depot , with Mrs. Cheyne at the head . The French maid shrieked at the invasion ; and Harvey laid the glories of the "
59131	59179	59180	59180	I	0	" before them without a word . They took them in in equal silence - stamped leather , silver door - handles and rails , cut velvet , plate - glass , nickel , bronze , hammered iron , and the rare woods of the continent inlaid . "
59184	59188	59189	59189	I	0	" said Harvey ; "
59193	59397	59189	59189	I	0	" This was his crowning revenge , and a most ample one . Mrs. Cheyne decreed a meal , and that nothing might be lacking to the tale Long Jack told afterwards in his boarding - house , she waited on them herself . Men who are accustomed to eat at tiny tables in howling gales have curiously neat and finished manners ; but Mrs. Cheyne , who did not know this , was surprised . She longed to have Manuel for a butler ; so silently and easily did he comport himself among the frail glassware and dainty silver . Tom Platt remembered the great days on the Ohio and the manners of foreign potentates who dined with the officers ; and Long Jack , being Irish , supplied the small talk till all were at their ease . In the ' We 're Here 's ' cabin the fathers took stock of each other behind their cigars . Cheyne knew well enough when he dealt with a man to whom he could not offer money ; equally well he knew that no money could pay for what Disko had done . He kept his own counsel and waited for an opening . "
59428	59432	59433	59433	He	1501	" said Disko . "

Why , Phil Airheart he went from this very town six year back - no , seven - an ' he 's mate on the San Jose - now - twenty - six days was her time out .

60122	60183	59626	59626	Harve	1513	" Airheart will attend to that . He 'll ship as boy for a voyage or two , and then we can put him in the way of doing better . Suppose you take him in hand this winter , and I 'll send for him early in the spring . I know the Pacific 's a long ways off - "
60184	60207	59626	59626	Harve	1513	" Pshaw ! We Troops , livin ' an ' dead , are all around the earth an ' the seas thereof . "

It was then that Harvey noticed and admired what had never struck him before - his father 's curious power of getting at the heart of new matters as learned from men in the street . "
62016	62031	61917	61917	we	1594	" demanded the son , as they came out of a rigger 's loft . "

62735	62819	62847	62848	a voter	1611	" Cheyne drew a cigar from his vest - pocket , bit off the end , and fell to smoking . Father and son were very much alike ; for the beard hid Cheyne 's mouth , and Harvey had his father 's slightly aquiline nose , close - set black eyes , and narrow , high cheek - bones . With a touch of brown paint he would have made up very picturesquely as a Red Indian of the story - books . "
62828	62834	62821	62821	you	0	" said Cheyne , slowly , "

Two young men in what they conceived to be sea costumes were playing cards by the saloon skylight ; and a couple of women with red and blue parasols looked on and laughed noisily . "
63057	63075	63076	63076	They	1623	" said Harvey , critically , as the yacht slowed to pick up her mooring - buoy . "

63352	63969	63347	63347	I	0	" Cheyne pulled his beard and smiled as he looked over the still water , and spoke away from Harvey , who presently began to be aware that his father was telling the story of his life . He talked in a low , even voice , without gesture and without expression ; and it was a history for which a dozen leading journals would cheerfully have paid many dollars - the story of forty years that was at the same time the story of the New West , whose story is yet to be written . It began with a kinless boy turned loose in Texas , and went on fantastically through a hundred changes and chops of life , the scenes shifting from State after Western State , from cities that sprang up in a month and - in a season utterly withered away , to wild ventures in wilder camps that are now laborious , paved municipalities . It covered the building of three railroads and the deliberate wreck of a fourth . It told of steamers , townships , forests , and mines , and the men of every nation under heaven , manning , creating , hewing , and digging these . It touched on chances of gigantic wealth flung before eyes that could not see , or missed by the merest accident of time and travel ; and through the mad shift of things , sometimes on horseback , more often afoot , now rich , now poor , in and out , and back and forth , deck - hand , train - hand , contractor , boarding - house keeper , journalist , engineer , drummer , real - estate agent , politician , dead - beat , rum - seller , mine - owner , speculator , cattle - man , or tramp , moved Harvey Cheyne , alert and quiet , seeking his own ends , and , so he said , the glory and advancement of his country . He told of the faith that never deserted him even when he hung on the ragged edge of despair - the faith that comes of knowing men and things . He enlarged , as though he were talking to himself , on his very great courage and resource at all times . The thing was so evident in the man 's mind that he never even changed his tone . He described how he had bested his enemies , or forgiven them , exactly as they had bested or forgiven him in those careless days ; how he had entreated , cajoled , and bullied towns , companies , and syndicates , all for their enduring good ; crawled round , through , or under mountains and ravines , dragging a string and hoop - iron railroad after him , and in the end , how he had sat still while promiscuous communities tore the last fragments of his character to shreds . The tale held Harvey almost breathless , his head a little cocked to one side , his eyes fixed on his father 's face , as the twilight deepened and the red cigar - end lit up the furrowed cheeks and heavy eyebrows . It seemed to him like watching a locomotive storming across country in the dark - a mile between each glare of the open fire - door : but this locomotive could talk , and the words shook and stirred the boy to the core of his soul . At last Cheyne pitched away the cigar - butt , and the two sat in the dark over the lapping water . "
63980	63988	63970	63970	I	0	" said the father . Harvey gasped . "
63999	64003	64007	64007	I	0	" said he . "
64102	64103	64104	64104	I	0	" "
64110	64117	64104	64104	I	0	" said the son , indignantly . "
64387	64388	64383	64383	You	1631	" "
64400	64404	64383	64383	You	1631	" said Harvey . "
64421	64422	64415	64416	the valet	1642	" "
64429	64433	64415	64416	the valet	1642	" Cheyne insisted . "
64488	64607	64481	64481	We	1640	" As this was a business talk , there was no need for Harvey to tell his mother about it ; and Cheyne naturally took the same point of view . But Mrs. Cheyne saw and feared , and was a little jealous . Her boy , who rode rough - shod over her , was gone , and in his stead reigned a keen - faced youth , abnormally silent , who addressed most of his conversation to his father . She understood it was business , and therefore a matter beyond her premises . If she had any doubts , they were resolved when Cheyne went to Boston and brought back a new diamond marquise ring . "
64616	64634	64610	64610	you	1640	" she said , with a weak little smile , as she turned it in the light . "
64649	64783	64647	64647	Harvey	250	" There was not . The boy had made a treaty on his own account . Railroads , he explained gravely , interested him as little as lumber , real estate , or mining . What his soul yearned after was control of his father 's newly purchased sailing - ship . If that could be promised him within what he conceived to be a reasonable time , he , for his part , guaranteed diligence and sobriety at college for four or five years . In vacation he was to be allowed full access to all details connected with the line - he had not asked more than two thousand questions about it , - from his father 's most private papers in the safe to the tug in San Francisco harbour . "
64789	64796	64647	64647	Harvey	250	" said Cheyne at the last . "
64854	64855	64852	64852	Harve	250	" "

65007	65011	65013	65013	Monday	456	" said Harvey ; "
65026	65027	64998	64998	We	1649	" "
65045	65063	65034	65034	They	1006	" said Cheyne weakly . He , too , was not anxious to spoil the golden days . "

65237	65258	65234	65234	I	0	" said Cheyne , with the brilliant and perfect comprehension of one born into and bred up to city pride . "

65344	65443	65336	65342	A Banker - full - blooded Banker	1666	" Harvey called back as he boarded a trolley , and Cheyne went on with his blissful dreams for the future . Disko had no use for public functions where appeals were made for charity , but Harvey pleaded that the glory of the day would be lost , so far as he was concerned , if the ' We 're Heres ' absented themselves . Then Disko made conditions . He had heard - it was astonishing how all the world knew all the world 's business along the water - front - he had heard that a "
65448	65465	65466	65467	Skipper Ireson	326	" was going to take part in the exercises ; and he mistrusted that she would deliver "
65471	65671	65672	65672	Mother	3182	" Personally , he had as little use for actresses as for summer boarders ; but justice was justice , and though he himself here Dan giggled had once slipped up on a matter of judgment , this thing must not be . So Harvey came back to East Gloucester , and spent half a day explaining to an amused actress with a royal reputation on two seaboards the inwardness of the mistake she contemplated ; and she admitted that it was justice , even as Disko had said . Cheyne knew by old experience what would happen ; but anything of the nature of a public palaver was meat and drink to the man 's soul . He saw the trolleys hurrying west , in the hot , hazy morning , full of women in light summer dresses , and white - faced straw - hatted men fresh from Boston desks ; the stack of bicycles outside the post office ; the come - and - go of busy officials , greeting one another ; the slow flick and swash of bunting in the heavy air ; and the important man with a hose sluicing the brick sidewalk . "
65674	65679	65672	65672	Mother	3182	" he said suddenly , "
65698	66004	65692	65692	they	1668	" Mrs. Cheyne nodded , and looked critically down the crooked street . Like her husband , she understood these gatherings , all the West over , and compared them one against another . The fishermen began to mingle with the crowd about the town - hall doors - blue - jowled Portuguese , their women bare - headed or shawled for the most part ; clear - eyed Nova Scotians , and men of the Maritime Provinces ; French , Italians , Swedes , and Danes , with outside crews of coasting schooners ; and everywhere women in black , who saluted one another with gloomy pride , for this was their day of great days . And there were ministers of many creeds , - pastors of great , gilt - edged congregations , at the seaside for a rest , with shepherds of the regular work , - from the priests of the Church on the Hill to bush - bearded ex - sailor Lutherans , hail - fellow with the men of a score of boats . There were owners of lines of schooners , large contributors to the societies , and small men , their few craft pawned to the mastheads , with bankers and marine - insurance agents , captains of tugs and water - boats , riggers , fitters , lumpers , salters , boat - builders , and coopers , and all the mixed population of the water - front . They drifted along the line of seats made gay with the dresses of the summer boarders , and one of the town officials patrolled and perspired till he shone all over with pure civic pride . Cheyne had met him for five minutes a few days before , and between the two there was entire understanding . "

66435	66458	66425	66426	Mr. Cheyne	438	" High , clear , and true , children 's voices bore down the last noise of those settling into their places . "
66480	66576	66469	66470	the Lord	1025	" The women throughout the hall leaned forward to look as the reiterated cadences filled the air . Mrs. Cheyne , with some others , began to breathe short ; she had hardly imagined there were so many widows in the world ; and instinctively searched for Harvey . He had found the ' We 're Heres ' at the back of the audience , and was standing , as by right , between Dan and Disko . Uncle Salters , returned the night before with Penn , from Pamlico Sound , received him suspiciously . "
66583	66587	66469	66470	the Lord	1025	" he grunted . "

Then he turned to the sea - wealth of the city , and spoke of the price that must be paid for the yearly harvest . They would hear later the names of their lost dead one hundred and seventeen of them . The widows stared a little , and looked at one another here . Gloucester could not boast any overwhelming mills or factories . Her sons worked for such wage as the sea gave ; and they all knew that neither Georges nor the Banks were cow - pastures . The utmost that folk ashore could accomplish was to help the widows and the orphans , and after a few general remarks he took this opportunity of thanking , in the name of the city , those who had so public - spiritedly consented to participate in the exercises of the occasion .
