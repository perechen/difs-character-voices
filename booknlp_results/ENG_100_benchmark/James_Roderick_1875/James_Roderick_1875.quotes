762	773	774	774	she	169	" What is it you mean to do in Europe ? "
808	818	819	819	he	170	" Why , very much what I do here , "
822	827	819	819	he	170	" No great harm . "
828	833	834	834	Cecilia	169	" Is it true , "
837	862	834	834	Cecilia	169	" that here you do no great harm ? Is not a man like you doing harm when he is not doing positive good ? "
863	869	871	871	Rowland	281	" Your compliment is ambiguous , "
873	876	878	879	the widow	368	" No , "
881	934	878	879	the widow	368	" you know what I think of you . You have a particular aptitude for beneficence . You have it in the first place in your character . You are a benevolent person . Ask Bessie if you do n't hold her more gently and comfortably than any of her other admirers . "
935	945	946	946	Bessie	171	" He holds me more comfortably than Mr. Hudson , "
974	1067	966	966	Cecilia	169	" Your circumstances , in the second place , suggest the idea of social usefulness . You are intelligent , you are well - informed , and your charity , if one may call it charity , would be discriminating . You are rich and unoccupied , so that it might be abundant . Therefore , I say , you are a person to do something on a large scale . Bestir yourself , dear Rowland , or we may be taught to think that virtue herself is setting a bad example . "
1068	1072	1074	1074	Rowland	281	" Heaven forbid , "
1076	1224	1074	1074	Rowland	281	" that I should set the examples of virtue ! I am quite willing to follow them , however , and if I do n't do something on the grand scale , it is that my genius is altogether imitative , and that I have not recently encountered any very striking models of grandeur . Pray , what shall I do ? Found an orphan asylum , or build a dormitory for Harvard College ? I am not rich enough to do either in an ideally handsome way , and I confess that , yet awhile , I feel too young to strike my grand coup . I am holding myself ready for inspiration . I am waiting till something takes my fancy irresistibly . If inspiration comes at forty , it will be a hundred pities to have tied up my money - bag at thirty . "
1225	1234	1236	1236	Cecilia	169	" Well , I give you till forty , "
1238	1270	1236	1236	Cecilia	169	" It 's only a word to the wise , a notification that you are expected not to run your course without having done something handsome for your fellow - men . "
1725	1731	1732	1732	he	370	" The only thing is , "
1735	2017	1732	1732	he	370	" that there I shall seem to be doing something . I shall be better entertained , and shall be therefore , I suppose , in a better humor with life . You may say that that is just the humor a useless man should keep out of . He should cultivate discontentment . I did a good many things when I was in Europe before , but I did not spend a winter in Rome . Every one assures me that this is a peculiar refinement of bliss ; most people talk about Rome in the same way . It is evidently only a sort of idealized form of loafing : a passive life in Rome , thanks to the number and the quality of one 's impressions , takes on a very respectable likeness to activity . It is still lotus - eating , only you sit down at table , and the lotuses are served up on rococo china . It 's all very well , but I have a distinct prevision of this - that if Roman life does n't do something substantial to make you happier , it increases tenfold your liability to moral misery . It seems to me a rash thing for a sensitive soul deliberately to cultivate its sensibilities by rambling too often among the ruins of the Palatine , or riding too often in the shadow of the aqueducts . In such recreations the chords of feeling grow tense , and after - life , to spare your intellectual nerves , must play upon them with a touch as dainty as the tread of Mignon when she danced her egg - dance . "
2018	2028	2030	2030	Cecilia	169	" I should have said , my dear Rowland , "
2036	2049	2030	2030	Cecilia	169	" that your nerves were tough , that your eggs were hard ! "
2050	2265	1732	1732	he	370	" That being stupid , you mean , I might be happy ? Upon my word I am not . I am clever enough to want more than I ' ve got . I am tired of myself , my own thoughts , my own affairs , my own eternal company . True happiness , we are told , consists in getting out of one 's self ; but the point is not only to get out - you must stay out ; and to stay out you must have some absorbing errand . Unfortunately , I ' ve got no errand , and nobody will trust me with one . I want to care for something , or for some one . And I want to care with a certain ardor ; even , if you can believe it , with a certain passion . I ca n't just now feel ardent and passionate about a hospital or a dormitory . Do you know I sometimes think that I ' m a man of genius , half finished ? The genius has been left out , the faculty of expression is wanting ; but the need for expression remains , and I spend my days groping for the latch of a closed door . "
2266	2274	2276	2276	Cecilia	169	" What an immense number of words , "
2281	2315	2276	2276	Cecilia	169	" to say you want to fall in love ! I ' ve no doubt you have as good a genius for that as any one , if you would only trust it . "
2316	2356	1732	1732	he	370	" Of course I ' ve thought of that , and I assure you I hold myself ready . But , evidently , I ' m not inflammable . Is there in Northampton some perfect epitome of the graces ? "
2357	2362	2364	2364	Cecilia	169	" Of the graces ? "
2384	2425	2364	2364	Cecilia	169	" The household virtues are better represented . There are some excellent girls , and there are two or three very pretty ones . I will have them here , one by one , to tea , if you like . "
2426	2467	1732	1732	he	370	" I should particularly like it ; especially as I should give you a chance to see , by the profundity of my attention , that if I am not happy , it 's not for want of taking pains . "
2477	2482	2483	2483	she	169	" On the whole , "
2486	2509	2483	2483	she	169	" I do n't think there are any worth asking . There are none so very pretty , none so very pleasing . "
2510	2516	2518	2520	the young man	347	" Are you very sure ? "
2531	2536	2538	2538	Cecilia	169	" Upon my word , "
2540	2586	2538	2538	Cecilia	169	" one would suppose I wished to keep you for myself . Of course I am sure ! But as the penalty of your insinuations , I shall invite the plainest and prosiest damsel that can be found , and leave you alone with her . "
2590	2595	2596	2596	he	347	" Even against her , "
2599	2615	2596	2596	he	347	" I should be sorry to conclude until I had given her my respectful attention . "
3155	3157	3178	3180	an irresponsible bachelor	416	" figure "
5048	5054	5055	5055	she	169	" And by the way , "
5063	5086	5055	5055	she	169	" if I refused last night to show you a pretty girl , I can at least show you a pretty boy . "
5160	5171	5172	5172	Rowland	281	" Who did it ? where did you get it ? "
5175	5178	5180	5180	Cecilia	169	" Oh , "
5186	5197	5180	5180	Cecilia	169	" it 's a little thing of Mr. Hudson 's . "
5198	5207	5209	5209	Rowland	281	" And who the deuce is Mr. Hudson ? "
5423	5434	5410	5410	he	347	" We ugly mortals , what beautiful creatures we are ! "
5449	5454	5455	5455	he	347	" Hudson - Hudson , "
5459	5464	5455	5455	he	347	" who is Hudson ? "
5465	5473	5475	5475	Cecilia	169	" A young man of this place , "
5477	5485	5455	5455	he	347	" A young man ? How old ? "
5486	5497	5455	5455	he	347	" I suppose he is three or four and twenty . "
5498	5511	5455	5455	he	347	" Of this place , you say - of Northampton , Massachusetts ? "
5512	5523	5455	5455	he	347	" He lives here , but he comes from Virginia . "
5524	5532	5455	5455	he	347	" Is he a sculptor by profession ? "
5533	5541	5455	5455	he	347	" He 's a law - student . "
5547	5568	5542	5542	Rowland	281	" He has found something in Blackstone that I never did . He makes statues then simply for his pleasure ? "
5583	5587	5580	5580	her	169	" For mine ! "
5588	5593	5595	5595	Rowland	281	" I congratulate you , "
5597	5611	5595	5595	Rowland	281	" I wonder whether he could be induced to do anything for me ? "
5612	5691	5580	5580	her	169	" This was a matter of friendship . I saw the figure when he had modeled it in clay , and of course greatly admired it . He said nothing at the time , but a week ago , on my birthday , he arrived in a buggy , with this . He had had it cast at the foundry at Chicopee ; I believe it 's a beautiful piece of bronze . He begged me to accept . "
5692	5697	5699	5699	Mallet	170	" Upon my word , "
5701	5707	5699	5699	Mallet	170	" he does things handsomely ! "
5717	5721	5723	5723	Cecilia	169	" So then , "
5725	5731	5723	5723	Cecilia	169	" it 's very remarkable ? "
5732	5739	5740	5740	Rowland	281	" Why , my dear cousin , "
5743	5754	5740	5740	Rowland	281	" Mr. Hudson , of Virginia , is an extraordinary - "
5759	5768	5769	5769	he	170	" Is he a great friend of yours ? "
5772	5777	5779	5779	Cecilia	169	" A great friend ? "
5782	5790	5779	5779	Cecilia	169	" I regard him as a child ! "
5791	5794	5796	5796	Rowland	281	" Well , "
5798	5819	5796	5796	Rowland	281	" he 's a very clever child . Tell me something about him : I should like to see him . "
6074	6081	6082	6082	he	347	" I ' m dripping wet ! "
6088	6094	6096	6096	Cecilia	169	" You walk too fast , "
6098	6105	6096	6096	Cecilia	169	" You do everything too fast . "
6106	6115	6116	6116	he	347	" I know it , I know it ! "
6137	6161	6116	6116	he	347	" I ca n't be slow if I try . There 's something inside of me that drives me . A restless fiend ! "
6239	6254	6256	6256	Rowland	281	" But I want to see the gentleman with the fiend inside of him , "
6258	6264	6265	6265	Bessie	171	" What is a fiend ? "
6268	6275	6265	6265	Bessie	171	" It 's only Mr. Hudson . "
6276	6286	6265	6265	Bessie	171	" Very well , I want to see him . "
6287	6294	6296	6296	Bessie	171	" Oh , never mind him ! "
6304	6315	6265	6265	Bessie	171	" You speak as if you did n't like him . "
6316	6321	6322	6322	Bessie	171	" I do n't ! "
6460	6470	6471	6471	Cecilia	169	" Wo n't you have a cup of tea ? "
6474	6482	6471	6471	Cecilia	169	" Perhaps that will restore your equanimity . "
6483	6493	6495	6495	Hudson	172	" Aye , by keeping me awake all night ! "
6497	6538	6495	6495	Hudson	172	" At the best , it 's hard enough to go down to the office . With my nerves set on edge by a sleepless night , I should perforce stay at home and be brutal to my poor mother . "
6539	6548	6471	6471	Cecilia	169	" Your mother is well , I hope . "
6549	6557	6495	6495	Hudson	172	" Oh , she 's as usual . "
6558	6563	6471	6471	Cecilia	169	" And Miss Garland ? "
6564	6590	6495	6495	Hudson	172	" She 's as usual , too . Every one , everything , is as usual . Nothing ever happens , in this benighted town . "
6591	6603	6605	6605	Cecilia	169	" I beg your pardon ; things do happen , sometimes , "
6607	6625	6605	6605	Cecilia	169	" Here is a dear cousin of mine arrived on purpose to congratulate you on your statuette . "
6686	6688	6775	6775	he	172	" compliment "
6696	6705	6706	6706	Rowland	281	" Your statuette seems to me very good , "
6710	6718	6706	6706	Rowland	281	" It has given me extreme pleasure . "
6719	6728	6730	6730	Cecilia	169	" And my cousin knows what is good , "
6732	6738	6730	6730	Cecilia	169	" He 's a connoisseur . "
6744	6748	6749	6749	he	172	" A connoisseur ? "
6754	6773	6775	6775	he	172	" He 's the first I ' ve ever seen ! Let me see what they look like ; "
6783	6800	6775	6775	he	172	" Have they all such good heads as that ? I should like to model yours . "
6801	6805	6807	6807	Cecilia	169	" Pray do , "
6809	6824	6807	6807	Cecilia	169	" It will keep him a while . He is running off to Europe . "
6825	6831	6832	6832	Hudson	172	" Ah , to Europe ! "
6844	6848	6832	6832	Hudson	172	" Happy man ! "
7535	7542	7543	7545	the young man	347	" What are you laughing at ? "
7549	7557	7543	7545	the young man	347	" Have I said anything so ridiculous ? "
7558	7565	7566	7566	Cecilia	169	" Go on , go on , "
7569	7587	7566	7566	Cecilia	169	" You are too delicious ! Show Mr. Mallet how Mr. Striker read the Declaration of Independence . "
7783	7788	7789	7789	he	172	" You really meant , "
7792	7812	7789	7789	he	172	" what you said a while ago about that thing of mine ? It is good - essentially good ? "
7813	7819	7821	7821	Rowland	281	" I really meant it , "
7831	7855	7821	7821	Rowland	281	" It is very good indeed . It is , as you say , essentially good . That is the beauty of it . "
7873	7882	7883	7883	he	172	" I have a notion you really know , "
7888	7901	7883	7883	he	172	" But if you do n't , it does n't much matter . "
7902	7911	7913	7913	Cecilia	169	" My cousin asked me to - day , "
7915	7927	7913	7913	Cecilia	169	" whether I supposed you knew yourself how good it is . "
7935	7939	7940	7940	he	172	" Perhaps not ! "
7943	7947	7949	7949	Mallet	170	" Very likely , "
7951	8003	7949	7949	Mallet	170	" I read in a book the other day that great talent in action - in fact the book said genius - is a kind of somnambulism . The artist performs great feats , in a dream . We must not wake him up , lest he should lose his balance . "
8004	8015	8016	8016	Hudson	172	" Oh , when he 's back in bed again ! "
8022	8037	8016	8016	Hudson	172	" Yes , call it a dream . It was a very happy one ! "
8038	8043	8045	8045	Rowland	281	" Tell me this , "
8047	8070	8045	8045	Rowland	281	" Did you mean anything by your young Water - drinker ? Does he represent an idea ? Is he a symbol ? "
8081	8116	8071	8071	Hudson	172	" Why , he 's youth , you know ; he 's innocence , he 's health , he 's strength , he 's curiosity . Yes , he 's a good many things . "
8117	8126	8156	8156	Hudson	172	" And is the cup also a symbol ? "
8127	8142	8071	8071	Hudson	172	" The cup is knowledge , pleasure , experience . Anything of that kind ! "
8143	8152	8154	8154	Rowland	281	" Well , he 's guzzling in earnest , "
8162	8172	8156	8156	Hudson	172	" Aye , poor fellow , he 's thirsty ! "
8188	8198	8200	8200	Cecilia	169	" Well , what do you make of him ? "
8221	8228	8230	8230	Rowland	281	" I confess I like him , "
8232	8246	8230	8230	Rowland	281	" He 's very immature , - but there 's stuff in him . "
8247	8254	8256	8256	Cecilia	169	" He 's a strange being , "
8260	8272	8273	8273	Rowland	281	" Who are his people ? what has been his education ? "
8276	8713	8230	8230	Rowland	281	" He has had no education , beyond what he has picked up , with little trouble , for himself . His mother is a widow , of a Massachusetts country family , a little timid , tremulous woman , who is always on pins and needles about her son . She had some property herself , and married a Virginian gentleman of good estates . He turned out , I believe , a very licentious personage , and made great havoc in their fortune . Everything , or almost everything , melted away , including Mr. Hudson himself . This is literally true , for he drank himself to death . Ten years ago his wife was left a widow , with scanty means and a couple of growing boys . She paid her husband 's debts as best she could , and came to establish herself here , where by the death of a charitable relative she had inherited an old - fashioned ruinous house . Roderick , our friend , was her pride and joy , but Stephen , the elder , was her comfort and support . I remember him , later ; he was an ugly , sturdy , practical lad , very different from his brother , and in his way , I imagine , a very fine fellow . When the war broke out he found that the New England blood ran thicker in his veins than the Virginian , and immediately obtained a commission . He fell in some Western battle and left his mother inconsolable . Roderick , however , has given her plenty to think about , and she has induced him , by some mysterious art , to abide , nominally at least , in a profession that he abhors , and for which he is about as fit , I should say , as I am to drive a locomotive . He grew up a la grace de Dieu , and was horribly spoiled . Three or four years ago he graduated at a small college in this neighborhood , where I am afraid he had given a good deal more attention to novels and billiards than to mathematics and Greek . Since then he has been reading law , at the rate of a page a day . If he is ever admitted to practice I ' m afraid my friendship wo n't avail to make me give him my business . Good , bad , or indifferent , the boy is essentially an artist - an artist to his fingers ' ends . "
8714	8719	8721	8721	Rowland	281	" Why , then , "
8723	8733	8721	8721	Rowland	281	" does n't he deliberately take up the chisel ? "
8734	8939	8230	8230	Rowland	281	" For several reasons . In the first place , I do n't think he more than half suspects his talent . The flame is smouldering , but it is never fanned by the breath of criticism . He sees nothing , hears nothing , to help him to self - knowledge . He 's hopelessly discontented , but he does n't know where to look for help . Then his mother , as she one day confessed to me , has a holy horror of a profession which consists exclusively , as she supposes , in making figures of people without their clothes on . Sculpture , to her mind , is an insidious form of immorality , and for a young man of a passionate disposition she considers the law a much safer investment . Her father was a judge , she has two brothers at the bar , and her elder son had made a very promising beginning in the same line . She wishes the tradition to be perpetuated . I ' m pretty sure the law wo n't make Roderick 's fortune , and I ' m afraid it will , in the long run , spoil his temper . "
8940	8949	8721	8721	Rowland	281	" What sort of a temper is it ? "
8950	9029	8230	8230	Rowland	281	" One to be trusted , on the whole . It is quick , but it is generous . I have known it to breathe flame and fury at ten o'clock in the evening , and soft , sweet music early on the morrow . It 's a very entertaining temper to observe . I , fortunately , can do so dispassionately , for I ' m the only person in the place he has not quarreled with . "
9030	9047	8721	8721	Rowland	281	" Has he then no society ? Who is Miss Garland , whom you asked about ? "
9048	9161	8230	8230	Rowland	281	" A young girl staying with his mother , a sort of far - away cousin ; a good plain girl , but not a person to delight a sculptor 's eye . Roderick has a goodly share of the old Southern arrogance ; he has the aristocratic temperament . He will have nothing to do with the small towns - people ; he says they 're ' ignoble . ' He can not endure his mother 's friends - the old ladies and the ministers and the tea - party people ; they bore him to death . So he comes and lounges here and rails at everything and every one . "
9406	9419	9421	9421	Cecilia	169	" Remember the day , and take care you rob no orchards , "
9747	9754	9755	9755	he	186	" It 's a wretched business , "
9758	9829	9755	9755	he	186	" this practical quarrel of ours with our own country , this everlasting impatience to get out of it . Is one 's only safety then in flight ? This is an American day , an American landscape , an American atmosphere . It certainly has its merits , and some day when I am shivering with ague in classic Italy , I shall accuse myself of having slighted them . "
9988	9992	9993	9993	he	186	" I declare , "
9996	10039	9993	9993	he	186	" there 's a career for a man , and I ' ve twenty minds to decide , on the spot , to embrace it - to be the consummate , typical , original , national American artist ! It 's inspiring ! "
10114	10120	10121	10121	he	186	" How would you like , "
10125	10131	10121	10121	he	186	" to go to Rome ? "
10159	10170	10171	10171	he	172	" And I should like , by the same token , "
10174	10205	10171	10171	he	172	" to go to Athens , to Constantinople , to Damascus , to the holy city of Benares , where there is a golden statue of Brahma twenty feet tall . "
10206	10209	10211	10211	Rowland	281	" Nay , "
10214	10245	10211	10211	Rowland	281	" if you were to go to Rome , you should settle down and work . Athens might help you , but for the present I should n't recommend Benares . "
10246	10260	10262	10262	Hudson	172	" It will be time to arrange details when I pack my trunk , "
10264	10281	10211	10211	Rowland	281	" If you mean to turn sculptor , the sooner you pack your trunk the better . "
10282	10313	10211	10211	Rowland	281	" Oh , but I ' m a practical man ! What is the smallest sum per annum , on which one can keep alive the sacred fire in Rome ? "
10314	10324	10211	10211	Rowland	281	" What is the largest sum at your disposal ? "
10343	10348	10325	10325	Roderick	186	" Three hundred dollars ! "
10349	10357	10359	10359	Rowland	281	" The money question could be arranged , "
10361	10369	10359	10359	Rowland	281	" There are ways of raising money . "
10370	10385	10211	10211	Rowland	281	" I should like to know a few ! I never yet discovered one . "
10386	10390	10392	10392	Rowland	281	" One consists , "
10394	10420	10392	10392	Rowland	281	" in having a friend with a good deal more than he wants , and not being too proud to accept a part of it . "
10430	10439	10426	10426	his	186	" Do you mean - do you mean ? "
10464	10543	10458	10458	Roderick	186	" In three words , if you are to be a sculptor , you ought to go to Rome and study the antique . To go to Rome you need money . I ' m fond of fine statues , but unfortunately I ca n't make them myself . I have to order them . I order a dozen from you , to be executed at your convenience . To help you , I pay you in advance . "
10560	10566	10567	10567	he	186	" You believe in me ! "
10572	10578	10580	10580	Rowland	281	" Allow me to explain , "
10582	10646	10580	10580	Rowland	281	" I believe in you , if you are prepared to work and to wait , and to struggle , and to exercise a great many virtues . And then , I ' m afraid to say it , lest I should disturb you more than I should help you . You must decide for yourself . I simply offer you an opportunity . "
10656	10665	10666	10666	he	172	" You have not seen my other things , "
10670	10677	10666	10666	he	172	" Come and look at them . "
10678	10681	10699	10699	his	172	" Now ? "
10682	10696	10666	10666	he	172	" Yes , we 'll walk home . We 'll settle the question . "
11283	11288	11290	11290	Hudson	187	" Upon my word , "
11294	11302	11290	11290	Hudson	187	" they seem to me very good . "
11435	11442	11428	11428	Rowland	281	" You have only to work ! "
11443	11452	11453	11453	Roderick	186	" I think I know what that means , "
11485	11490	11491	11491	he	186	" Work - work ? "
11499	11508	11491	11491	he	186	" ah , if I could only begin ! "
11549	11555	11556	11556	he	186	" I want to begin , "
11559	11578	11556	11556	he	186	" and I ca n't make a better beginning than this ! Good - by , Mr. Striker ! "
11734	11744	11730	11730	she	596	" Why , Roderick , what have you done ? "
11755	11769	11770	11770	he	186	" I ' ve driven the money - changers out of the temple ! "
11938	11949	11950	11950	he	186	" I had it out last night with my mother , "
11953	12071	12072	12072	he	601	" I dreaded the scene , for she takes things terribly hard . She does n't scold nor storm , and she does n't argue nor insist . She sits with her eyes full of tears that never fall , and looks at me , when I displease her , as if I were a perfect monster of depravity . And the trouble is that I was born to displease her . She does n't trust me ; she never has and she never will . I do n't know what I have done to set her against me , but ever since I can remember I have been looked at with tears . The trouble is , "
12083	12195	12072	12072	he	601	" I ' ve been too absurdly docile . I ' ve been sprawling all my days by the maternal fireside , and my dear mother has grown used to bullying me . I ' ve made myself cheap ! If I ' m not in my bed by eleven o'clock , the girl is sent out to explore with a lantern . When I think of it , I fairly despise my amiability . It 's rather a hard fate , to live like a saint and to pass for a sinner ! I should like for six months to lead Mrs. Hudson the life some fellows lead their mothers ! "
12196	12202	12204	12204	Rowland	281	" Allow me to believe , "
12206	12310	12204	12204	Rowland	281	" that you would like nothing of the sort . If you have been a good boy , do n't spoil it by pretending you do n't like it . You have been very happy , I suspect , in spite of your virtues , and there are worse fates in the world than being loved too well . I have not had the pleasure of seeing your mother , but I would lay you a wager that that is the trouble . She is passionately fond of you , and her hopes , like all intense hopes , keep trembling into fears . "
12345	12351	12352	12352	he	186	" I do her justice , "
12355	12363	12336	12336	Roderick	186	" May she never do me less ! "
12371	12380	12381	12381	he	602	" I 'll tell you the perfect truth , "
12385	12664	12381	12381	he	602	" I have to fill a double place . I have to be my brother as well as myself . It 's a good deal to ask of a man , especially when he has so little talent as I for being what he is not . When we were both young together I was the curled darling . I had the silver mug and the biggest piece of pudding , and I stayed in - doors to be kissed by the ladies while he made mud - pies in the garden and was never missed , of course . Really , he was worth fifty of me ! When he was brought home from Vicksburg with a piece of shell in his skull , my poor mother began to think she had n't loved him enough . I remember , as she hung round my neck sobbing , before his coffin , she told me that I must be to her everything that he would have been . I swore in tears and in perfect good faith that I would , but naturally I have not kept my promise . I have been utterly different . I have been idle , restless , egotistical , discontented . I have done no harm , I believe , but I have done no good . My brother , if he had lived , would have made fifty thousand dollars and put gas and water into the house . My mother , brooding night and day on her bereavement , has come to fix her ideal in offices of that sort . Judged by that standard I ' m nowhere ! "
12696	12707	12708	12708	he	605	" You must lose no time in making a masterpiece , "
12711	12725	12708	12708	he	605	" then with the proceeds you can give her gas from golden burners . "
12726	13039	12665	12665	Rowland	281	" So I have told her ; but she only half believes either in masterpiece or in proceeds . She can see no good in my making statues ; they seem to her a snare of the enemy . She would fain see me all my life tethered to the law , like a browsing goat to a stake . In that way I ' m in sight . ' It 's a more regular occupation ! ' that 's all I can get out of her . A more regular damnation ! Is it a fact that artists , in general , are such wicked men ? I never had the pleasure of knowing one , so I could n't confute her with an example . She had the advantage of me , because she formerly knew a portrait - painter at Richmond , who did her miniature in black lace mittens you may see it on the parlor table , who used to drink raw brandy and beat his wife . I promised her that , whatever I might do to my wife , I would never beat my mother , and that as for brandy , raw or diluted , I detested it . She sat silently crying for an hour , during which I expended treasures of eloquence . It 's a good thing to have to reckon up one 's intentions , and I assure you , as I pleaded my cause , I was most agreeably impressed with the elevated character of my own . I kissed her solemnly at last , and told her that I had said everything and that she must make the best of it . This morning she has dried her eyes , but I warrant you it is n't a cheerful house . I long to be out of it ! "
13040	13047	13049	13049	Rowland	281	" I ' m extremely sorry , "
13051	13080	13049	13049	Rowland	281	" to have been the prime cause of so much suffering . I owe your mother some amends ; will it be possible for me to see her ? "
13081	13263	12665	12665	Rowland	281	" If you 'll see her , it will smooth matters vastly ; though to tell the truth she 'll need all her courage to face you , for she considers you an agent of the foul fiend . She does n't see why you should have come here and set me by the ears : you are made to ruin ingenuous youths and desolate doting mothers . I leave it to you , personally , to answer these charges . You see , what she ca n't forgive - what she 'll not really ever forgive - is your taking me off to Rome . Rome is an evil word , in my mother 's vocabulary , to be said in a whisper , as you 'd say ' damnation . ' Northampton is in the centre of the earth and Rome far away in outlying dusk , into which it can do no Christian any good to penetrate . And there was I but yesterday a doomed habitue of that repository of every virtue , Mr. Striker 's office ! "
13264	13274	13276	13276	Rowland	281	" And does Mr. Striker know of your decision ? "
13278	13704	12665	12665	Rowland	281	" To a certainty ! Mr. Striker , you must know , is not simply a good - natured attorney , who lets me dog's - ear his law - books . He 's a particular friend and general adviser . He looks after my mother 's property and kindly consents to regard me as part of it . Our opinions have always been painfully divergent , but I freely forgive him his zealous attempts to unscrew my head - piece and set it on hind part before . He never understood me , and it was useless to try to make him . We speak a different language - we 're made of a different clay . I had a fit of rage yesterday when I smashed his bust , at the thought of all the bad blood he had stirred up in me ; it did me good , and it 's all over now . I do n't hate him any more ; I ' m rather sorry for him . See how you ' ve improved me ! I must have seemed to him wilfully , wickedly stupid , and I ' m sure he only tolerated me on account of his great regard for my mother . This morning I grasped the bull by the horns . I took an armful of law - books that have been gathering the dust in my room for the last year and a half , and presented myself at the office . ' Allow me to put these back in their places , ' I said . ' I shall never have need for them more - never more , never more , never more ! ' ' So you ' ve learned everything they contain ? ' asked Striker , leering over his spectacles . ' Better late than never . ' ' I ' ve learned nothing that you can teach me , ' I cried . ' But I shall tax your patience no longer . I ' m going to be a sculptor . I ' m going to Rome . I wo n't bid you good - by just yet ; I shall see you again . But I bid good - by here , with rapture , to these four detested walls - to this living tomb ! I did n't know till now how I hated it ! My compliments to Mr. Spooner , and my thanks for all you have not made of me ! ' "
13705	13720	13721	13721	Rowland	281	" I ' m glad to know you are to see Mr. Striker again , "
13731	13760	13761	13761	he	607	" You certainly owe him a respectful farewell , even if he has not understood you . I confess you rather puzzle me . There is another person , "
13765	13785	13761	13761	he	607	" whose opinion as to your new career I should like to know . What does Miss Garland think ? "
13804	13813	13814	13814	he	607	" What makes you suppose she thinks anything ? "
13817	13847	13786	13786	Hudson	187	" Because , though I saw her but for a moment yesterday , she struck me as a very intelligent person , and I am sure she has opinions . "
13861	13870	13871	13871	he	607	" Oh , she thinks what I think ! "
13896	13907	13908	13908	he	607	" I have launched you , as I may say , "
13911	13997	13908	13908	he	607	" and I feel as if I ought to see you into port . I am older than you and know the world better , and it seems well that we should voyage a while together . It 's on my conscience that I ought to take you to Rome , walk you through the Vatican , and then lock you up with a heap of clay . I sail on the fifth of September ; can you make your preparations to start with me ? "
14021	14029	14030	14030	he	186	" I have no preparations to make , "
14052	14064	14066	14066	he	186	" What I am to take with me I carry here ! "
14071	14075	14077	14077	Rowland	281	" Happy man ! "
14210	14221	14222	14222	he	186	" What would you have said , if I had ? "
14225	14280	14222	14222	he	186	" I would have said in the first place , ' Oh for pity 's sake do n't carry off the person in all Northampton who amuses me most ! ' I would have said in the second place , ' Nonsense ! the boy is doing very well . Let well alone ! ' "
14281	14296	14222	14222	he	186	" That in the first five minutes . What would you have said later ? "
14297	14315	14222	14222	he	186	" That for a man who is generally averse to meddling , you were suddenly rather officious . "
14342	14347	14348	14348	she	169	" Excuse my sharpness , "
14353	14446	14348	14348	she	169	" But I am literally in despair at losing Roderick Hudson . His visits in the evening , for the past year , have kept me alive . They have given a silver tip to leaden days . I do n't say he is of a more useful metal than other people , but he is of a different one . Of course , however , that I shall miss him sadly is not a reason for his not going to seek his fortune . Men must work and women must weep ! "
14447	14451	14453	14453	Rowland	281	" Decidedly not ! "
14742	14750	14751	14751	she	169	" I only desire to remind you , "
14754	14765	14751	14751	she	169	" that you are likely to have your hands full . "
14766	14953	14751	14751	she	169	" I ' ve thought of that , and I rather like the idea ; liking , as I do , the man . I told you the other day , you know , that I longed to have something on my hands . When it first occurred to me that I might start our young friend on the path of glory , I felt as if I had an unimpeachable inspiration . Then I remembered there were dangers and difficulties , and asked myself whether I had a right to step in between him and his obscurity . My sense of his really having the divine flame answered the question . He is made to do the things that humanity is the happier for ! I ca n't do such things myself , but when I see a young man of genius standing helpless and hopeless for want of capital , I feel - and it 's no affectation of humility , I assure you - as if it would give at least a reflected usefulness to my own life to offer him his opportunity . "
14954	14996	14751	14751	she	169	" In the name of humanity , I suppose , I ought to thank you . But I want , first of all , to be happy myself . You guarantee us at any rate , I hope , the masterpieces . "
14997	15003	15005	15005	Rowland	281	" A masterpiece a year , "
15008	15017	15005	15005	Rowland	281	" for the next quarter of a century . "
15018	15053	14751	14751	she	169	" It seems to me that we have a right to ask more : to demand that you guarantee us not only the development of the artist , but the security of the man . "
15059	15063	15054	15054	Rowland	281	" His security ? "
15064	15117	14751	14751	she	169	" His moral , his sentimental security . Here , you see , it 's perfect . We are all under a tacit compact to preserve it . Perhaps you believe in the necessary turbulence of genius , and you intend to enjoin upon your protege the importance of cultivating his passions . "
15118	15194	15195	15195	he	619	" On the contrary , I believe that a man of genius owes as much deference to his passions as any other man , but not a particle more , and I confess I have a strong conviction that the artist is better for leading a quiet life . That is what I shall preach to my protege , as you call him , by example as well as by precept . You evidently believe , "
15201	15210	15195	15195	he	619	" that he will lead me a dance . "
15211	15351	14751	14751	she	169	" Nay , I prophesy nothing . I only think that circumstances , with our young man , have a great influence ; as is proved by the fact that although he has been fuming and fretting here for the last five years , he has nevertheless managed to make the best of it , and found it easy , on the whole , to vegetate . Transplanted to Rome , I fancy he 'll put forth a denser leafage . I should like vastly to see the change . You must write me about it , from stage to stage . I hope with all my heart that the fruit will be proportionate to the foliage . Do n't think me a bird of ill omen ; only remember that you will be held to a strict account . "
15352	15370	15371	15371	Rowland	281	" A man should make the most of himself , and be helped if he needs help , "
15379	15433	15371	15371	Rowland	281	" Of course when a body begins to expand , there comes in the possibility of bursting ; but I nevertheless approve of a certain tension of one 's being . It 's what a man is meant for . And then I believe in the essential salubrity of genius - true genius . "
15434	15438	15440	15440	Cecilia	169	" Very good , "
15461	15478	15440	15440	Cecilia	169	" We 'll drink then to - day at dinner to the health of our friend . "
15813	15816	15818	15819	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Yes , "
15822	15849	15818	15819	Mrs. Hudson	191	" I know - my son has told me . I suppose it is better I should see you . Perhaps you will take a seat . "
15870	15875	15877	15881	a full , grave voice	630	" Not that one , "
15974	15985	15986	15986	he	620	" Oh , you should let me take the chair , "
15989	16000	15986	15986	he	620	" and have the pleasure of holding the skeins myself ! "
16032	16044	16023	16024	Mrs. Hudson	191	" You see he 's quite the insidious personage we feared . "
16704	16716	16717	16717	he	646	" I have become suddenly so very intimate with your son , "
16728	16739	16717	16717	he	646	" that it seems just I should make your acquaintance . "
16740	16744	16746	16748	the poor lady	651	" Very just , "
16779	16788	16789	16789	he	646	" I should like to take the liberty , "
16792	16816	16789	16789	he	646	" of addressing you a simple question . For how long a period of time have you been acquainted with our young friend ? "
16852	16865	16831	16831	his	646	" A very short time , I confess . Hardly three days . "
16866	16957	16959	16960	Mr. Striker	185	" And yet you call yourself intimate , eh ? I have been seeing Mr. Roderick daily these three years , and yet it was only this morning that I felt as if I had at last the right to say that I knew him . We had a few moments ' conversation in my office which supplied the missing links in the evidence . So that now I do venture to say I ' m acquainted with Mr. Roderick ! But wait three years , sir , like me ! "
17006	17016	17017	17017	he	185	" Oh , in three years , of course , "
17020	17036	17037	17037	he	185	" we shall know each other better . Before many years are over , madam , "
17040	17058	17037	17037	he	185	" I expect the world to know him . I expect him to be a great man ! "
17105	17108	17096	17096	she	191	" Really ? "
17120	17128	17129	17129	he	185	" Do I fully apprehend your expression ? "
17132	17143	17129	17129	he	185	" Our young friend is to become a great man ? "
17144	17152	17154	17154	Rowland	281	" A great artist , I hope , "
17156	17165	17167	17168	Mr. Striker	185	" This is a new and interesting view , "
17177	17250	17167	17168	Mr. Striker	185	" We have had hopes for Mr. Roderick , but I confess , if I have rightly understood them , they stopped short of greatness . We should n't have taken the responsibility of claiming it for him . What do you say , ladies ? We all feel about him here - his mother , Miss Garland , and myself - as if his merits were rather in the line of the "
17268	17274	17253	17254	Mr. Striker	185	" of the light ornamental ! "
17375	17384	17385	17385	Rowland	281	" I ' m afraid , Mrs. Hudson , "
17397	17433	17385	17385	Rowland	281	" that you do n't at all thank me for stirring up your son 's ambition on a line which leads him so far from home . I suspect I have made you my enemy . "
17462	17471	17437	17437	her	191	" My cousin is no one 's enemy , "
17498	17506	17507	17507	Rowland	281	" Does she leave that to you ? "
17516	17526	17528	17529	Mr. Striker	185	" We are inspired with none but Christian sentiments , "
17531	17542	17528	17529	Mr. Striker	185	" Miss Garland perhaps most of all . Miss Garland , "
17562	17582	17547	17547	his	185	" is the daughter of a minister , the granddaughter of a minister , the sister of a minister . "
17618	17667	17614	17615	Mr. Striker	185	" Mrs. Hudson , I see , is too deeply agitated to converse with you freely . She will allow me to address you a few questions . Would you kindly inform her , as exactly as possible , just what you propose to do with her son ? "
17758	17765	17767	17767	Rowland	281	" Do , my dear madam ? "
17769	17804	17767	17767	Rowland	281	" I do n't propose to do anything . He must do for himself . I simply offer him the chance . He 's to study , to work - hard , I hope . "
17805	17812	17814	17815	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Not too hard , please , "
17828	17848	17814	17815	Mrs. Hudson	191	" He 's not very strong , and I ' m afraid the climate of Europe is very relaxing . "
17849	17854	17856	17857	Mr. Striker	185	" Ah , study ? "
17859	17872	17856	17857	Mr. Striker	185	" To what line of study is he to direct his attention ? "
17887	17896	17883	17883	his	185	" How do you study sculpture , anyhow ? "
17897	17906	17814	17815	Mrs. Hudson	191	" By looking at models and imitating them . "
17907	17922	17883	17883	his	185	" At models , eh ? To what kind of models do you refer ? "
17923	17933	17814	17815	Mrs. Hudson	191	" To the antique , in the first place . "
17934	17940	17942	17943	Mr. Striker	185	" Ah , the antique , "
17950	17970	17942	17943	Mr. Striker	185	" Do you hear , madam ? Roderick is going off to Europe to learn to imitate the antique . "
17971	17979	17981	17982	Mrs. Hudson	191	" I suppose it 's all right , "
17993	18002	18003	18004	the lawyer	662	" An antique , as I understand it , "
18007	18040	18003	18004	the lawyer	662	" is an image of a pagan deity , with considerable dirt sticking to it , and no arms , no nose , and no clothing . A precious model , certainly ! "
18041	18051	18053	18053	Rowland	281	" That 's a very good description of many , "
18059	18064	18066	18067	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Mercy ! Truly ? "
18075	18092	18093	18094	Mr. Striker	185	" But a sculptor 's studies , you intimate , are not confined to the antique , "
18097	18112	18093	18094	Mr. Striker	185	" After he has been looking three or four years at the objects I describe "
18114	18121	18123	18123	Rowland	281	" He studies the living model , "
18125	18134	18136	18137	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Does it take three or four years ? "
18141	18160	18093	18094	Mr. Striker	185	" That depends upon the artist 's aptitude . After twenty years a real artist is still studying . "
18161	18168	18170	18171	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Oh , my poor boy ! "
18184	18193	18194	18195	Mr. Striker	185	" Now this study of the living model , "
18198	18205	18194	18195	Mr. Striker	185	" Inform Mrs. Hudson about that . "
18206	18212	18214	18215	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Oh dear , no ! "
18219	18223	18225	18225	Rowland	281	" That too , "
18227	18256	18225	18225	Rowland	281	" is one of the reasons for studying in Rome . It 's a handsome race , you know , and you find very well - made people . "
18257	18271	18273	18274	Mr. Striker	185	" I suppose they 're no better made than a good tough Yankee , "
18281	18288	18273	18274	Mr. Striker	185	" The same God made us . "
18289	18292	18294	18295	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Surely , "
18345	18353	18354	18354	she	182	" Are the Roman women very beautiful ? "
18374	18383	18384	18384	he	367	" On the whole , I prefer ours , "
18502	18513	18497	18497	he	367	" Yes , on the whole , I prefer ours . "
18514	18520	18522	18523	Mr. Striker	185	" Well , these models , "
18525	18536	18522	18523	Mr. Striker	185	" You put them into an attitude , I suppose . "
18537	18543	18497	18497	he	367	" An attitude , exactly . "
18544	18555	18522	18523	Mr. Striker	185	" And then you sit down and look at them . "
18556	18581	18497	18497	he	367	" You must not sit too long . You must go at your clay and try to build up something that looks like them . "
18582	18652	18522	18523	Mr. Striker	185	" Well , there you are with your model in an attitude on one side , yourself , in an attitude too , I suppose , on the other , and your pile of clay in the middle , building up , as you say . So you pass the morning . After that I hope you go out and take a walk , and rest from your exertions . "
18653	18679	18497	18497	he	367	" Unquestionably . But to a sculptor who loves his work there is no time lost . Everything he looks at teaches or suggests something . "
18680	18737	18522	18523	Mr. Striker	185	" That 's a tempting doctrine to young men with a taste for sitting by the hour with the page unturned , watching the flies buzz , or the frost melt on the window - pane . Our young friend , in this way , must have laid up stores of information which I never suspected ! "
18738	18742	18744	18744	Rowland	281	" Very likely , "
18751	18767	18744	18744	Rowland	281	" he will prove some day the completer artist for some of those lazy reveries . "
18824	18830	18831	18831	she	191	" My son , then , "
18836	18849	18831	18831	she	191	" my son has great - what you would call great powers ? "
18850	18859	18860	18862	Poor Mrs. Hudson	191	" To my sense , very great powers . "
18910	18916	18917	18917	she	191	" Do you really know ? "
18924	18947	18917	18917	she	191	" One can not know in such a matter save after proof , and proof takes time . But one can believe . "
18948	18953	18917	18917	she	191	" And you believe ? "
18954	18958	18917	18917	she	191	" I believe . "
18975	18980	18982	18983	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Well , well , "
18985	18997	18982	18983	Mrs. Hudson	191	" we must hope that it is all for the best . "
19080	19094	19095	19095	he	185	" Well , sir , Mr. Roderick 's powers are nothing to me , "
19098	19165	19095	19095	he	185	" nor no use he makes of them . Good or bad , he 's no son of mine . But , in a friendly way , I ' m glad to hear so fine an account of him . I ' m glad , madam , you 're so satisfied with the prospect . Affection , sir , you see , must have its guarantees ! "
19210	19221	19222	19222	he	185	" I suppose you 're a very brilliant young man , "
19226	19570	19222	19222	he	185	" very enlightened , very cultivated , quite up to the mark in the fine arts and all that sort of thing . I ' m a plain , practical old boy , content to follow an honorable profession in a free country . I did n't go off to the Old World to learn my business ; no one took me by the hand ; I had to grease my wheels myself , and , such as I am , I ' m a self - made man , every inch of me ! Well , if our young friend is booked for fame and fortune , I do n't suppose his going to Rome will stop him . But , mind you , it wo n't help him such a long way , either . If you have undertaken to put him through , there 's a thing or two you 'd better remember . The crop we gather depends upon the seed we sow . He may be the biggest genius of the age : his potatoes wo n't come up without his hoeing them . If he takes things so almighty easy as - well , as one or two young fellows of genius I ' ve had under my eye - his produce will never gain the prize . Take the word for it of a man who has made his way inch by inch , and does n't believe that we 'll wake up to find our work done because we ' ve lain all night a - dreaming of it ; anything worth doing is devilish hard to do ! If your young protajay finds things easy and has a good time and says he likes the life , it 's a sign that - as I may say - you had better step round to the office and look at the books . That 's all I desire to remark . No offense intended . I hope you 'll have a first - rate time . "
19831	19943	19819	19820	Mrs. Hudson	191	" He 's very lovable , sir , I assure you . When you come to know him you 'll find him very lovable . He 's a little spoiled , of course ; he has always done with me as he pleased ; but he 's a good boy , I ' m sure he 's a good boy . And every one thinks him very attractive : I ' m sure he 'd be noticed , anywhere . Do n't you think he 's very handsome , sir ? He features his poor father . I had another - perhaps you ' ve been told . He was killed . "
19958	20001	20010	20010	she	678	" He was a very fine boy , but very different from Roderick . Roderick is a little strange ; he has never been an easy boy . Sometimes I feel like the goose - was n't it a goose , dear ? "
20016	20113	20010	20010	she	678	" the goose , or the hen , who hatched a swan 's egg . I have never been able to give him what he needs . I have always thought that in more - in more brilliant circumstances he might find his place and be happy . But at the same time I was afraid of the world for him ; it was so large and dangerous and dreadful . No doubt I know very little about it . I never suspected , I confess , that it contained persons of such liberality as yours . "
20129	20132	20134	20135	Miss Garland	182	" No , "
20141	20151	20134	20135	Miss Garland	182	" it is like something in a fairy tale . "
20152	20157	20134	20135	Miss Garland	182	" What , pray ? "
20158	20181	20134	20135	Miss Garland	182	" Your coming here all unknown , so rich and so polite , and carrying off my cousin in a golden cloud . "
20249	20257	20258	20258	she	191	" He will really do great things , "
20261	20266	20258	20258	she	191	" the very greatest ? "
20267	20281	20319	20319	she	191	" I see no reason in his talent itself why he should not . "
20282	20296	20297	20297	she	191	" Well , we 'll think of that as we sit here alone , "
20300	20318	20319	20319	she	191	" Mary and I will sit here and talk about it . So I give him up , "
20328	20380	20319	20319	she	191	" I ' m sure you 'll be the best of friends to him , but if you should ever forget him , or grow tired of him , or lose your interest in him , and he should come to any harm or any trouble , please , sir , remember "
20391	20398	20383	20383	she	191	" Remember , my dear madam ? "
20399	20420	20383	20383	she	191	" That he is all I have - that he is everything - and that it would be very terrible . "
20421	20435	20438	20438	Rowland	281	" In so far as I can help him , he shall succeed , "
20491	20501	20502	20502	he	681	" Have you no charge to lay upon me ? "
20528	20535	20536	20536	she	182	" Make him do his best , "
20551	20561	20562	20562	he	681	" Do you take a great interest in him ? "
20565	20568	20539	20539	Rowland	281	" Certainly . "
20569	20590	20591	20591	She	182	" Then , if he will not do his best for you , he will not do it for me . "
20981	20995	20971	20971	He	186	" The splendor falls on castle walls And snowy summits old in story ! "
21679	21690	21691	21691	he	186	" It is to be a very long one now , "
21694	21709	21691	21691	he	186	" for it is settled that she is to remain while I am away . "
21807	21816	21817	21817	he	186	" I want to strike out , hard ! "
21820	21833	21817	21817	he	186	" I want to do something violent , to let off steam ! "
21834	21847	21849	21849	Cecilia	169	" I 'll tell you what to do , this lovely weather , "
21851	21886	21849	21849	Cecilia	169	" Give a picnic . It can be as violent as you please , and it will have the merit of leading off our emotion into a safe channel , as well as yours . "
21944	21954	21955	21955	he	186	" And we 'll have Mrs. Striker , too , "
21958	21985	21955	21955	he	186	" if she 'll come , to keep my mother in countenance ; and at any rate we 'll have Miss Striker - the divine Petronilla ! "
22242	22245	22237	22237	She	191	" accident , "
22492	22504	22506	22506	Rowland	281	" You can give your cousin your society at any time , "
22508	22520	22506	22506	Rowland	281	" But me , perhaps , you 'll never see again . "
22521	22539	22540	22540	she	182	" Why then should we wish to be friends , if nothing is to come of it ? "
22565	22576	22578	22578	Rowland	281	" Oh , one must take all one can get , "
22580	22597	22578	22578	Rowland	281	" If we can be friends for half an hour , it 's so much gained . "
22598	22610	22506	22506	Rowland	281	" Do you expect never to come back to Northampton again ? "
22611	22632	22578	22578	Rowland	281	" ' Never ' is a good deal to say . But I go to Europe for a long stay . "
22633	22645	22506	22506	Rowland	281	" Do you prefer it so much to your own country ? "
22646	22678	22578	22578	Rowland	281	" I will not say that . But I have the misfortune to be a rather idle man , and in Europe the burden of idleness is less heavy than here . "
22691	22703	22704	22704	she	182	" In that , then , we are better than Europe , "
22726	22733	22734	22734	she	182	" Would n't it be better , "
22737	22757	22734	22734	she	182	" to work to get reconciled to America , than to go to Europe to get reconciled to idleness ? "
22758	22770	22704	22704	she	182	" Doubtless ; but you know work is hard to find . "
22771	22784	22786	22787	Miss Garland	182	" I come from a little place where every one has plenty , "
22789	22803	22804	22804	she	182	" We all work ; every one I know works . And really , "
22808	22826	22804	22804	she	182	" I look at you with curiosity ; you are the first unoccupied man I ever saw . "
22827	22836	22838	22838	Rowland	281	" Do n't look at me too hard , "
22842	22859	22838	22838	Rowland	281	" I shall sink into the earth . What is the name of your little place ? "
22860	22864	22866	22867	Miss Garland	182	" West Nazareth , "
22874	22889	22866	22867	Miss Garland	182	" It is not so very little , though it 's smaller than Northampton . "
22890	22903	22904	22904	Rowland	281	" I wonder whether I could find any work at West Nazareth , "
22907	22914	22915	22916	Miss Garland	182	" You would not like it , "
22920	22939	22915	22916	Miss Garland	182	" Though there are far finer woods there than this . We have miles and miles of woods . "
22940	22947	22949	22949	Rowland	281	" I might chop down trees , "
22951	22960	22949	22949	Rowland	281	" That is , if you allow it . "
22961	22974	22984	22984	she	182	" Allow it ? Why , where should we get our firewood ? "
22999	23014	22984	22984	she	182	" Do n't you know how to do anything ? Have you no profession ? "
23020	23024	23015	23015	Rowland	281	" Absolutely none . "
23025	23033	22949	22949	Rowland	281	" What do you do all day ? "
23034	23083	23015	23015	Rowland	281	" Nothing worth relating . That 's why I am going to Europe . There , at least , if I do nothing , I shall see a great deal ; and if I ' m not a producer , I shall at any rate be an observer . "
23084	23091	22949	22949	Rowland	281	" Ca n't we observe everywhere ? "
23092	23115	23116	23116	he	735	" Certainly ; and I really think that in that way I make the most of my opportunities . Though I confess , "
23119	23152	23116	23116	he	735	" that I often remember there are things to be seen here to which I probably have n't done justice . I should like , for instance , to see West Nazareth . "
23267	23285	23264	23264	his	735	" Since you are free to do as you please , why do n't you go there ? "
23286	23322	23264	23264	his	735	" I am not free to do as I please now . I have offered your cousin to bear him company to Europe , he has accepted with enthusiasm , and I can not retract . "
23323	23334	23264	23264	his	735	" Are you going to Europe simply for his sake ? "
23340	23349	23335	23335	Rowland	281	" I think I may almost say so . "
23357	23369	23370	23370	she	182	" Do you mean to do a great deal for him ? "
23375	23396	23264	23264	his	735	" What I can . But my power of helping him is very small beside his power of helping himself . "
23405	23411	23412	23412	she	182	" You are very generous , "
23418	23443	23444	23444	he	738	" No , I am simply very shrewd . Roderick will repay me . It 's an investment . At first , I think , "
23449	23463	23444	23444	he	738	" you would not have paid me that compliment . You distrusted me . "
23472	23493	23464	23464	She	182	" I did n't see why you should wish to make Roderick discontented . I thought you were rather frivolous . "
23494	23509	23400	23400	she	182	" You did me injustice . I do n't think I ' m that . "
23510	23530	23464	23464	She	182	" It was because you are unlike other men - those , at least , whom I have seen . "
23531	23536	23400	23400	she	182	" In what way ? "
23537	23562	23464	23464	She	182	" Why , as you describe yourself . You have no duties , no profession , no home . You live for your pleasure . "
23563	23580	23400	23400	she	182	" That 's all very true . And yet I maintain I ' m not frivolous . "
23581	23586	23588	23589	Miss Garland	182	" I hope not , "
23751	23760	23761	23761	he	741	" I suppose that 's common , too , "
23764	23779	23761	23761	he	741	" but I have never seen it - or noticed it , at least . "
23837	23844	23845	23845	she	182	" It 's not especially useful , "
23848	23913	23845	23845	she	182	" but I like to know the names of plants as I do those of my acquaintances . When we walk in the woods at home - which we do so much - it seems as unnatural not to know what to call the flowers as it would be to see some one in the town with whom we were not on speaking terms . "
23914	23919	23920	23920	Rowland	281	" Apropos of frivolity , "
23923	23964	23920	23920	Rowland	281	" I ' m sure you have very little of it , unless at West Nazareth it is considered frivolous to walk in the woods and nod to the nodding flowers . Do kindly tell me a little about yourself . "
23972	23983	23984	23984	he	744	" I know you come of a race of theologians , "
23988	23991	23992	23992	she	182	" No , "
23997	24043	23992	23992	she	182	" they are not theologians , though they are ministers . We do n't take a very firm stand upon doctrine ; we are practical , rather . We write sermons and preach them , but we do a great deal of hard work beside . "
24044	24056	23920	23920	Rowland	281	" And of this hard work what has your share been ? "
24057	24065	23992	23992	she	182	" The hardest part : doing nothing . "
24066	24073	23920	23920	Rowland	281	" What do you call nothing ? "
24074	24114	23992	23992	she	182	" I taught school a while : I must make the most of that . But I confess I did n't like it . Otherwise , I have only done little things at home , as they turned up . "
24115	24121	23920	23920	Rowland	281	" What kind of things ? "
24122	24139	23992	23992	she	182	" Oh , every kind . If you had seen my home , you would understand . "
24176	24184	24185	24185	he	746	" To be happy , I imagine , "
24191	24208	24185	24185	he	746	" you need to be occupied . You need to have something to expend yourself upon . "
24209	24303	24146	24146	her	745	" That is not so true as it once was ; now that I am older , I am sure I am less impatient of leisure . Certainly , these two months that I have been with Mrs. Hudson , I have had a terrible amount of it . And yet I have liked it ! And now that I am probably to be with her all the while that her son is away , I look forward to more with a resignation that I do n't quite know what to make of . "
24304	24320	24185	24185	he	746	" It is settled , then , that you are to remain with your cousin ? "
24321	24345	24346	24346	she	748	" It depends upon their writing from home that I may stay . But that is probable . Only I must not forget , "
24351	24367	24346	24346	she	748	" that the ground for my doing so is that she be not left alone . "
24368	24375	24377	24377	Rowland	281	" I am glad to know , "
24379	24399	24377	24377	Rowland	281	" that I shall probably often hear about you . I assure you I shall often think about you ! "
24783	24788	24789	24789	he	749	" Do n't forget , "
24799	24813	24789	24789	he	749	" And do n't , in this company , repent of your bargain . "
24814	24821	24823	24824	Miss Garland	182	" I shall not let him , "
24832	24858	24823	24824	Miss Garland	182	" I shall see that he is punctual . He must go ! I owe you an apology for having doubted that he ought to . "
25021	25028	25029	25029	he	186	" I must tell you something , "
25034	25082	25029	25029	he	186	" I should like you to know it , and you will be so glad to know it . Besides , it 's only a question of time ; three months hence , probably , you would have guessed it . I am engaged to Mary Garland . "
25116	25129	25110	25110	he	186	" Engaged to Miss Garland ! I never supposed - I never imagined "
25131	25140	25141	25141	Roderick	186	" That I was in love with her ? "
25144	25410	25141	25141	Roderick	186	" Neither did I , until this last fortnight . But you came and put me into such ridiculous good - humor that I felt an extraordinary desire to tell some woman that I adored her . Miss Garland is a magnificent girl ; you know her too little to do her justice . I have been quietly learning to know her , these past three months , and have been falling in love with her without being conscious of it . It appeared , when I spoke to her , that she had a kindness for me . So the thing was settled . I must of course make some money before we can marry . It 's rather droll , certainly , to engage one 's self to a girl whom one is going to leave the next day , for years . We shall be condemned , for some time to come , to do a terrible deal of abstract thinking about each other . But I wanted her blessing on my career and I could not help asking for it . Unless a man is unnaturally selfish he needs to work for some one else than himself , and I am sure I shall run a smoother and swifter course for knowing that that fine creature is waiting , at Northampton , for news of my greatness . If ever I am a dull companion and over - addicted to moping , remember in justice to me that I am in love and that my sweetheart is five thousand miles away . "
25473	25476	25477	25477	he	764	" Yes , "
25489	25506	25477	25477	he	764	" you certainly ought to do better - with Miss Garland waiting for you at Northampton . "
25887	25891	25893	25893	Roderick	186	" Very likely , "
25902	26103	25893	25893	Roderick	186	" But I must let it pass . I have seen enough for the present ; I have reached the top of the hill . I have an indigestion of impressions ; I must work them off before I go in for any more . I do n't want to look at any more of other people 's works , for a month - not even at Nature 's own . I want to look at Roderick Hudson 's . The result of it all is that I ' m not afraid . I can but try , as well as the rest of them ! The fellow who did that gazing goddess yonder only made an experiment . The other day , when I was looking at Michael Angelo 's Moses , I was seized with a kind of defiance - a reaction against all this mere passive enjoyment of grandeur . It was a rousing great success , certainly , that rose there before me , but somehow it was not an inscrutable mystery , and it seemed to me , not perhaps that I should some day do as well , but that at least I might ! "
26104	26114	26116	26116	Rowland	281	" As you say , you can but try , "
26118	26125	26116	26116	Rowland	281	" Success is only passionate effort . "
26126	26168	25893	25893	Roderick	186	" Well , the passion is blazing ; we have been piling on fuel handsomely . It came over me just now that it is exactly three months to a day since I left Northampton . I ca n't believe it ! "
26169	26175	26116	26116	Rowland	281	" It certainly seems more . "
26176	26190	25893	25893	Roderick	186	" It seems like ten years . What an exquisite ass I was ! "
26191	26199	26116	26116	Rowland	281	" Do you feel so wise now ? "
26200	26232	25893	25893	Roderick	186	" Verily ! Do n't I look so ? Surely I have n't the same face . Have n't I a different eye , a different expression , a different voice ? "
26233	26270	26272	26272	Rowland	281	" I can hardly say , because I have seen the transition . But it 's very likely . You are , in the literal sense of the word , more civilized . I dare say , "
26274	26282	26272	26272	Rowland	281	" that Miss Garland would think so . "
26283	26300	25893	25893	Roderick	186	" That 's not what she would call it ; she would say I was corrupted . "
26321	26327	26328	26328	he	781	" Are you very sure ? "
26331	26355	26356	26356	Roderick	186	" Why , she 's a stern moralist , and she would infer from my appearance that I had become a cynical sybarite . "
26384	26393	26395	26395	Rowland	281	" Will you think I take a liberty , "
26397	26406	26395	26395	Rowland	281	" if I say you judge her superficially ? "
26407	26413	26415	26415	Roderick	186	" For heaven 's sake , "
26419	26449	26415	26415	Roderick	186	" do n't tell me she 's not a moralist ! It was for that I fell in love with her , and with rigid virtue in her person . "
26450	26552	26395	26395	Rowland	281	" She is a moralist , but not , as you imply , a narrow one . That 's more than a difference in degree ; it 's a difference in kind . I do n't know whether I ever mentioned it , but I admire her extremely . There is nothing narrow about her but her experience ; everything else is large . My impression of her is of a person of great capacity , as yet wholly unmeasured and untested . Some day or other , I ' m sure , she will judge fairly and wisely of everything . "
26553	26558	26560	26560	Roderick	186	" Stay a bit ! "
26562	26635	26636	26636	he	186	" you 're a better Catholic than the Pope . I shall be content if she judges fairly of me - of my merits , that is . The rest she must not judge at all . She 's a grimly devoted little creature ; may she always remain so ! Changed as I am , I adore her none the less . What becomes of all our emotions , our impressions , "
26645	26779	26636	26636	he	186	" all the material of thought that life pours into us at such a rate during such a memorable three months as these ? There are twenty moments a week - a day , for that matter , some days - that seem supreme , twenty impressions that seem ultimate , that appear to form an intellectual era . But others come treading on their heels and sweeping them along , and they all melt like water into water and settle the question of precedence among themselves . The curious thing is that the more the mind takes in , the more it has space for , and that all one 's ideas are like the Irish people at home who live in the different corners of a room , and take boarders . "
26780	26800	26802	26802	Rowland	281	" I fancy it is our peculiar good luck that we do n't see the limits of our minds , "
26804	26892	26802	26802	Rowland	281	" We are young , compared with what we may one day be . That belongs to youth ; it is perhaps the best part of it . They say that old people do find themselves at last face to face with a solid blank wall , and stand thumping against it in vain . It resounds , it seems to have something beyond it , but it wo n't move ! That 's only a reason for living with open doors as long as we can ! "
26893	26897	26899	26899	Roderick	186	" Open doors ? "
26901	26936	26937	26937	he	186	" Yes , let us close no doors that open upon Rome . For this , for the mind , is eternal summer ! But though my doors may stand open to - day , "
26941	26981	26937	26937	he	186	" I shall see no visitors . I want to pause and breathe ; I want to dream of a statue . I have been working hard for three months ; I have earned a right to a reverie . "
29198	29202	29204	29204	Roderick	186	" Immortal powers ! "
29206	29222	29223	29223	He	186	" what a vision ! In the name of transcendent perfection , who is she ? "
29240	29265	29223	29223	He	186	" What a movement , what a manner , what a poise of the head ! I wonder if she would sit to me . "
29266	29275	29277	29277	Rowland	281	" You had better go and ask her , "
29281	29288	29277	29277	Rowland	281	" She is certainly most beautiful . "
29289	29321	29223	29223	He	186	" Beautiful ? She 's beauty itself - she 's a revelation . I do n't believe she is living - she 's a phantasm , a vapor , an illusion ! "
29322	29326	29328	29328	Rowland	281	" The poodle , "
29330	29335	29328	29328	Rowland	281	" is certainly alive . "
29336	29354	29223	29223	He	186	" Nay , he too may be a grotesque phantom , like the black dog in Faust . "
29355	29375	29328	29328	Rowland	281	" I hope at least that the young lady has nothing in common with Mephistopheles . She looked dangerous . "
29376	29388	29390	29390	Roderick	186	" If beauty is immoral , as people think at Northampton , "
29422	29422	29390	29390	Roderick	186	"
29423	29433	29435	29435	Rowland	281	" The Prince and Princess Ludovisi and the principessina , "
29437	29444	29446	29446	Roderick	186	" There are no such people , "
29448	29460	29446	29446	Roderick	186	" Besides , the little old man is not the papa . "
29479	29523	29473	29475	the young sculptor	492	" The old man is a Roman , a hanger - on of the mamma , a useful personage who now and then gets asked to dinner . The ladies are foreigners , from some Northern country ; I wo n't say which . "
29524	29532	29534	29534	Rowland	281	" Perhaps from the State of Maine , "
29536	29599	29600	29600	He	864	" No , she 's not an American , I 'll lay a wager on that . She 's a daughter of this elder world . We shall see her again , I pray my stars ; but if we do n't , I shall have done something I never expected to - I shall have had a glimpse of ideal beauty . "
29684	29692	29694	29694	Roderick	186	" I have been wanting a subject , "
29696	29710	29694	29694	Roderick	186	" there 's one made to my hand ! And now for work ! "
30277	30280	30329	30329	Roderick	186	" antique . "
31441	31444	31438	31438	he	186	" Adam , "
31705	31708	31709	31709	They	608	" celebration . "
32215	32220	32213	32213	He	186	" flushed with triumph ; "
33465	33479	33450	33450	Singleton	214	" Well , sir , your statues are beautiful , all the same ! "
34102	34109	34094	34094	he	1030	" Remember to forget Mary Garland . "
34688	34716	34683	34683	She	1050	" I was not always so ugly as this ; as a young girl I had beautiful golden hair , very much the color of my wig . "
35035	35045	35047	35047	Gloriani	213	" As you have begun with Adam and Eve , "
35049	35060	35047	35047	Gloriani	213	" I suppose you are going straight through the Bible . "
35073	35080	35082	35082	Roderick	186	" I may make a David , "
35084	35185	35082	35082	Roderick	186	" but I shall not try any more of the Old Testament people . I do n't like the Jews ; I do n't like pendulous noses . David , the boy David , is rather an exception ; you can think of him and treat him as a young Greek . Standing forth there on the plain of battle between the contending armies , rushing forward to let fly his stone , he looks like a beautiful runner at the Olympic games . After that I shall skip to the New Testament . I mean to make a Christ . "
35186	35201	35203	35203	Gloriani	213	" You 'll put nothing of the Olympic games into him , I hope , "
35205	35223	35226	35226	Roderick	186	" Oh , I shall make him very different from the Christ of tradition ; more - more "
35245	35252	35254	35255	Miss Blanchard	216	" More rationalistic , I suppose , "
35257	35261	35263	35263	Roderick	186	" More idealistic ! "
35265	35281	35263	35263	Roderick	186	" The perfection of form , you know , to symbolize the perfection of spirit . "
35282	35288	35290	35291	Miss Blanchard	216	" For a companion piece , "
35293	35301	35290	35291	Miss Blanchard	216	" you ought to make a Judas . "
35302	35388	35263	35263	Roderick	186	" Never ! I mean never to make anything ugly . The Greeks never made anything ugly , and I ' m a Hellenist ; I ' m not a Hebraist ! I have been thinking lately of making a Cain , but I should never dream of making him ugly . He should be a very handsome fellow , and he should lift up the murderous club with the beautiful movement of the fighters in the Greek friezes who are chopping at their enemies . "
35389	35400	35402	35402	Gloriani	213	" There 's no use trying to be a Greek , "
35404	35518	35402	35402	Gloriani	213	" If Phidias were to come back , he would recommend you to give it up . I am half Italian and half French , and , as a whole , a Yankee . What sort of a Greek should I make ? I think the Judas is a capital idea for a statue . Much obliged to you , madame , for the suggestion . What an insidious little scoundrel one might make of him , sitting there nursing his money - bag and his treachery ! There can be a great deal of expression in a pendulous nose , my dear sir , especially when it is cast in green bronze . "
35519	35523	35525	35525	Roderick	186	" Very likely , "
35527	35832	35525	35525	Roderick	186	" But it is not the sort of expression I care for . I care only for perfect beauty . There it is , if you want to know it ! That 's as good a profession of faith as another . In future , so far as my things are not positively beautiful , you may set them down as failures . For me , it 's either that or nothing . It 's against the taste of the day , I know ; we have really lost the faculty to understand beauty in the large , ideal way . We stand like a race with shrunken muscles , staring helplessly at the weights our forefathers easily lifted . But I do n't hesitate to proclaim it - I mean to lift them again ! I mean to go in for big things ; that 's my notion of my art . I mean to do things that will be simple and vast and infinite . You 'll see if they wo n't be infinite ! Excuse me if I brag a little ; all those Italian fellows in the Renaissance used to brag . There was a sensation once common , I am sure , in the human breast - a kind of religious awe in the presence of a marble image newly created and expressing the human type in superhuman purity . When Phidias and Praxiteles had their statues of goddesses unveiled in the temples of the AEgean , do n't you suppose there was a passionate beating of hearts , a thrill of mysterious terror ? I mean to bring it back ; I mean to thrill the world again ! I mean to produce a Juno that will make you tremble , a Venus that will make you swoon ! "
35833	35843	35845	35846	Madame Grandoni	217	" So that when we come and see you , "
35848	35870	35845	35846	Madame Grandoni	217	" we must be sure and bring our smelling - bottles . And pray have a few soft sofas conveniently placed . "
35871	35876	35877	35878	Miss Blanchard	216	" Phidias and Praxiteles , "
35881	35938	35877	35878	Miss Blanchard	216	" had the advantage of believing in their goddesses . I insist on believing , for myself , that the pagan mythology is not a fiction , and that Venus and Juno and Apollo and Mercury used to come down in a cloud into this very city of Rome where we sit talking nineteenth century English . "
35939	35947	35949	35950	Madame Grandoni	217	" Nineteenth century nonsense , my dear ! "
35952	35991	35949	35950	Madame Grandoni	217	" Mr. Hudson may be a new Phidias , but Venus and Juno - that 's you and I - arrived to - day in a very dirty cab ; and were cheated by the driver , too . "
35992	35999	36001	36001	Gloriani	213	" But , my dear fellow , "
36003	36027	36001	36001	Gloriani	213	" you do n't mean to say you are going to make over in cold blood those poor old exploded Apollos and Hebes . "
36028	36038	36040	36040	Roderick	186	" It wo n't matter what you call them , "
36042	36083	36040	36040	Roderick	186	" They shall be simply divine forms . They shall be Beauty ; they shall be Wisdom ; they shall be Power ; they shall be Genius ; they shall be Daring . That 's all the Greek divinities were . "
36084	36093	36095	36096	Miss Blanchard	216	" That 's rather abstract , you know , "
36098	36103	36105	36105	Gloriani	213	" My dear fellow , "
36107	36113	36105	36105	Gloriani	213	" you 're delightfully young . "
36114	36124	36126	36126	Singleton	214	" I hope you 'll not grow any older , "
36139	36148	36126	36126	Singleton	214	" You can do it if you try . "
36149	36163	36164	36164	Roderick	186	" Then there are all the Forces and Mysteries and Elements of Nature , "
36168	36210	36164	36164	Roderick	186	" I mean to do the Morning ; I mean to do the Night ! I mean to do the Ocean and the Mountains ; the Moon and the West Wind . I mean to make a magnificent statue of America ! "
36211	36220	36222	36222	Gloriani	213	" America - the Mountains - the Moon ! "
36224	36245	36222	36222	Gloriani	213	" You 'll find it rather hard , I ' m afraid , to compress such subjects into classic forms . "
36246	36254	36256	36256	Roderick	186	" Oh , there 's a way , "
36258	36281	36256	36256	Roderick	186	" and I shall think it out . My figures shall make no contortions , but they shall mean a tremendous deal . "
36282	36295	36297	36298	Madame Grandoni	217	" I ' m sure there are contortions enough in Michael Angelo , "
36300	36309	36297	36298	Madame Grandoni	217	" Perhaps you do n't approve of him . "
36310	36319	36321	36321	Roderick	186	" Oh , Michael Angelo was not me ! "
36418	36422	36424	36424	Gloriani	213	" Bless me ! "
36426	36432	36424	36424	Gloriani	213	" did he do this ? "
36433	36437	36439	36439	Roderick	186	" Ages ago , "
36454	36460	36461	36461	he	186	" It 's deucedly pretty , "
36466	36481	36461	36461	he	186	" But , my dear young friend , you ca n't keep this up . "
36482	36488	36490	36490	Roderick	186	" I shall do better , "
36492	36579	36461	36461	he	186	" You will do worse ! You will become weak . You will have to take to violence , to contortions , to romanticism , in self - defense . This sort of thing is like a man trying to lift himself up by the seat of his trousers . He may stand on tiptoe , but he ca n't do more . Here you stand on tiptoe , very gracefully , I admit ; but you ca n't fly ; there 's no use trying . "
36580	36589	36591	36591	Roderick	186	" My ' America ' shall answer you ! "
36623	36630	36631	36631	he	214	" Was this done in America ? "
36634	36646	36647	36647	Roderick	186	" In a square white wooden house at Northampton , Massachusetts , "
36650	36657	36659	36660	Miss Blanchard	216	" Dear old white wooden houses ! "
36662	36673	36675	36675	Singleton	214	" If you could do as well as this there , "
36681	36697	36675	36675	Singleton	214	" one might say that really you had only to lose by coming to Rome . "
36698	36706	36708	36708	Roderick	186	" Mallet is to blame for that , "
36710	36720	36708	36708	Roderick	186	" But I am willing to risk the loss . "
36730	36735	36736	36736	she	217	" It reminds me , "
36739	37171	36736	36736	she	217	" of the things a young man used to do whom I knew years ago , when I first came to Rome . He was a German , a pupil of Overbeck and a votary of spiritual art . He used to wear a black velvet tunic and a very low shirt collar ; he had a neck like a sickly crane , and let his hair grow down to his shoulders . His name was Herr Schafgans . He never painted anything so profane as a man taking a drink , but his figures were all of the simple and slender and angular pattern , and nothing if not innocent - like this one of yours . He would not have agreed with Gloriani any more than you . He used to come and see me very often , and in those days I thought his tunic and his long neck infallible symptoms of genius . His talk was all of gilded aureoles and beatific visions ; he lived on weak wine and biscuits , and wore a lock of Saint Somebody 's hair in a little bag round his neck . If he was not a Beato Angelico , it was not his own fault . I hope with all my heart that Mr. Hudson will do the fine things he talks about , but he must bear in mind the history of dear Mr. Schafgans as a warning against high - flown pretensions . One fine day this poor young man fell in love with a Roman model , though she had never sat to him , I believe , for she was a buxom , bold - faced , high - colored creature , and he painted none but pale , sickly women . He offered to marry her , and she looked at him from head to foot , gave a shrug , and consented . But he was ashamed to set up his menage in Rome . They went to Naples , and there , a couple of years afterwards , I saw him . The poor fellow was ruined . His wife used to beat him , and he had taken to drinking . He wore a ragged black coat , and he had a blotchy , red face . Madame had turned washerwoman and used to make him go and fetch the dirty linen . His talent had gone heaven knows where ! He was getting his living by painting views of Vesuvius in eruption on the little boxes they sell at Sorrento . "
37172	37186	37188	37188	Roderick	186	" Moral : do n't fall in love with a buxom Roman model , "
37190	37215	37188	37188	Roderick	186	" I ' m much obliged to you for your story , but I do n't mean to fall in love with any one . "
37232	37241	37242	37242	he	186	" It 's a happy bit of youth , "
37245	37261	37242	37242	he	186	" But you ca n't keep it up - you ca n't keep it up ! "
37424	37430	37431	37432	Miss Blanchard	216	" You 're very generous , "
37770	37780	37781	37781	he	1071	" A pretty thing - a devilish pretty thing , "
37784	37826	37781	37781	he	1071	" It 's as fresh as the foam in the milk - pail . He can do it once , he can do it twice , he can do it at a stretch half a dozen times . But - but - "
37840	37849	37850	37850	he	1071	" Oh , he will keep it up , "
37855	37862	37850	37850	he	1071	" I will answer for him . "
37912	37927	37894	37894	he	186	" In a word , then , you prophesy that I am to fail ? "
37939	38048	37928	37928	Gloriani	213	" My dear fellow , passion burns out , inspiration runs to seed . Some fine day every artist finds himself sitting face to face with his lump of clay , with his empty canvas , with his sheet of blank paper , waiting in vain for the revelation to be made , for the Muse to descend . He must learn to do without the Muse ! When the fickle jade forgets the way to your studio , do n't waste any time in tearing your hair and meditating on suicide . Come round and see me , and I will show you how to console yourself . "
38049	38055	38057	38057	Roderick	186	" If I break down , "
38061	38084	38057	38057	Roderick	186	" I shall stay down . If the Muse deserts me , she shall at least have her infidelity on her conscience . "
38085	38091	38092	38092	Rowland	281	" You have no business , "
38097	38125	38127	38127	he	186	" to talk lightly of the Muse in this company . Mr. Singleton , too , has received pledges from her which place her constancy beyond suspicion . "
38175	38183	38184	38184	Gloriani	213	" Yes , these are fresh too , "
38187	38196	38184	38184	Gloriani	213	" extraordinarily fresh ! How old are you ? "
38197	38204	38206	38206	Singleton	214	" Twenty - six , sir , "
38208	38231	38184	38184	Gloriani	213	" For twenty - six they are famously fresh . They must have taken you a long time ; you work slowly . "
38232	38255	38184	38184	Gloriani	213	" Yes , unfortunately , I work very slowly . One of them took me six weeks , the other two months . "
38256	38268	38184	38184	Gloriani	213	" Upon my word ! The Muse pays you long visits . "
38300	38305	38307	38308	the sculptor	524	" Oh , you ! "
38310	38317	38307	38308	the sculptor	524	" you 'll keep it up ! "
38378	38384	38385	38385	he	186	" It 's no use , "
38388	38394	38385	38385	he	186	" I give it up ! "
38395	38400	38436	38436	Rowland	281	" What is it ? "
38401	38429	38385	38385	he	186	" I have struck a shallow ! I have been sailing bravely , but for the last day or two my keel has been crunching the bottom . "
38430	38435	38436	38436	Rowland	281	" A difficult place ? "
38452	38462	38463	38463	Roderick	186	" Oh , it 's not the poor clay ! "
38466	38473	38475	38475	he	186	" The difficult place is here ! "
38483	38516	38475	38475	he	186	" I do n't know what 's the matter with me . Nothing comes ; all of a sudden I hate things . My old things look ugly ; everything looks stupid . "
38605	38612	38613	38613	he	214	" Why , you 're tired ! "
38616	38630	38613	38613	he	214	" Of course you 're tired . You have a right to be ! "
38631	38642	38643	38643	Roderick	186	" Do you think I have a right to be ? "
38650	38659	38643	38643	Roderick	186	" Unquestionably , after all you have done . "
38660	38688	38613	38613	he	214	" Well , then , right or wrong , I am tired . I certainly have done a fair winter 's work . I want a change . "
38791	38803	38804	38804	he	186	" I have such unbounded faith in your good - will , "
38807	38819	38804	38804	he	186	" that I believe nothing I can say would offend you . "
38820	38824	38826	38826	Rowland	281	" Try it , "
38828	38978	38782	38782	Roderick	186	" Well , then , I think my journey will do me more good if I take it alone . I need n't say I prefer your society to that of any man living . For the last six months it has been everything to me . But I have a perpetual feeling that you are expecting something of me , that you are measuring my doings by a terrifically high standard . You are watching me ; I do n't want to be watched . I want to go my own way ; to work when I choose and to loaf when I choose . It is not that I do n't know what I owe you ; it is not that we are not friends . It is simply that I want a taste of absolutely unrestricted freedom . Therefore , I say , let us separate . "
38986	39038	38979	38979	Rowland	281	" Willingly . Do as you desire , I shall miss you , and I venture to believe you 'll pass some lonely hours . But I have only one request to make : that if you get into trouble of any kind whatever , you will immediately let me know . "
39227	39232	39233	39233	he	1090	" Say the word , "
39236	39243	39233	39233	he	1090	" and I will stop too . "
39247	39284	39244	39244	Roderick	186	" Ah , you do n't trust me ; you do n't think I ' m able to take care of myself . That proves that I was right in feeling as if I were watched ! "
39285	39292	39294	39294	Rowland	281	" Watched , my dear fellow ! "
39296	39332	39294	39294	Rowland	281	" I hope you may never have anything worse to complain of than being watched in the spirit in which I watch you . But I will spare you even that . Good - by ! "
39748	40363	40364	40365	Miss Garland	182	" Your letter was filled with an echo of that brilliant Roman world , which made me almost ill with envy . For a week after I got it I thought Northampton really unpardonably tame . But I am drifting back again to my old deeps of resignation , and I rush to the window , when any one passes , with all my old gratitude for small favors . So Roderick Hudson is already a great man , and you turn out to be a great prophet ? My compliments to both of you ; I never heard of anything working so smoothly . And he takes it all very quietly , and does n't lose his balance nor let it turn his head ? You judged him , then , in a day better than I had done in six months , for I really did not expect that he would settle down into such a jog - trot of prosperity . I believed he would do fine things , but I was sure he would intersperse them with a good many follies , and that his beautiful statues would spring up out of the midst of a straggling plantation of wild oats . But from what you tell me , Mr. Striker may now go hang himself ..... There is one thing , however , to say as a friend , in the way of warning . That candid soul can keep a secret , and he may have private designs on your equanimity which you do n't begin to suspect . What do you think of his being engaged to Miss Garland ? The two ladies had given no hint of it all winter , but a fortnight ago , when those big photographs of his statues arrived , they first pinned them up on the wall , and then trotted out into the town , made a dozen calls , and announced the news . Mrs. Hudson did , at least ; Miss Garland , I suppose , sat at home writing letters . To me , I confess , the thing was a perfect surprise . I had not a suspicion that all the while he was coming so regularly to make himself agreeable on my veranda , he was quietly preferring his cousin to any one else . Not , indeed , that he was ever at particular pains to make himself agreeable ! I suppose he has picked up a few graces in Rome . But he must not acquire too many : if he is too polite when he comes back , Miss Garland will count him as one of the lost . She will be a very good wife for a man of genius , and such a one as they are often shrewd enough to take . She 'll darn his stockings and keep his accounts , and sit at home and trim the lamp and keep up the fire while he studies the Beautiful in pretty neighbors at dinner - parties . The two ladies are evidently very happy , and , to do them justice , very humbly grateful to you . Mrs. Hudson never speaks of you without tears in her eyes , and I am sure she considers you a specially patented agent of Providence . Verily , it 's a good thing for a woman to be in love : Miss Garland has grown almost pretty . I met her the other night at a tea - party ; she had a white rose in her hair , and sang a sentimental ballad in a fine contralto voice . "
41079	41089	41090	41090	Roderick	186	" I know I have been a great brute , "
41093	41521	41090	41090	Roderick	186	" not to have sent you a word before ; but really I do n't know what has got into me . I have lately learned terribly well how to be idle . I am afraid to think how long it is since I wrote to my mother or to Mary . Heaven help them - poor , patient , trustful creatures ! I do n't know how to tell you what I am doing . It seems all amusing enough while I do it , but it would make a poor show in a narrative intended for your formidable eyes . I found Baxter in Switzerland , or rather he found me , and he grabbed me by the arm and brought me here . I was walking twenty miles a day in the Alps , drinking milk in lonely chalets , sleeping as you sleep , and thinking it was all very good fun ; but Baxter told me it would never do , that the Alps were 'd - - d rot , ' that Baden - Baden was the place , and that if I knew what was good for me I would come along with him . It is a wonderful place , certainly , though , thank the Lord , Baxter departed last week , blaspheming horribly at trente et quarante . But you know all about it and what one does - what one is liable to do . I have succumbed , in a measure , to the liabilities , and I wish I had some one here to give me a thundering good blowing up . Not you , dear friend ; you would draw it too mild ; you have too much of the milk of human kindness . I have fits of horrible homesickness for my studio , and I shall be devoutly grateful when the summer is over and I can go back and swing a chisel . I feel as if nothing but the chisel would satisfy me ; as if I could rush in a rage at a block of unshaped marble . There are a lot of the Roman people here , English and American ; I live in the midst of them and talk nonsense from morning till night . There is also some one else ; and to her I do n't talk sense , nor , thank heaven , mean what I say . I confess , I need a month 's work to recover my self - respect . "
41669	41674	41675	41675	Roderick	186	" In common charity , "
41678	41711	41675	41675	Roderick	186	" lend me a hundred pounds ! I have gambled away my last franc - I have made a mountain of debts . Send me the money first ; lecture me afterwards ! "
41922	41960	41904	41904	Roderick	186	" Send me another fifty pounds ! I have been back to the tables . I will leave as soon as the money comes , and meet you at Geneva . There I will tell you everything . "
42640	42646	42647	42647	he	243	" For heaven 's sake , "
42650	42685	42647	42647	he	243	" do n't play such dangerous games with your facility . If you have got facility , revere it , respect it , adore it , treasure it - do n't speculate on it . "
42910	42915	42916	42916	he	186	" By the wiser , "
42919	42930	42916	42916	he	186	" I mean the stronger in purpose , in will . "
42931	42940	42941	42941	Roderick	186	" Oh , do n't talk about will ! "
42980	43098	42973	42975	Jean - Jacques	249	" The will , I believe , is the mystery of mysteries . Who can answer for his will ? who can say beforehand that it 's strong ? There are all kinds of indefinable currents moving to and fro between one 's will and one 's inclinations . People talk as if the two things were essentially distinct ; on different sides of one 's organism , like the heart and the liver . Mine , I know , are much nearer together . It all depends upon circumstances . I believe there is a certain group of circumstances possible for every man , in which his will is destined to snap like a dry twig . "
43099	43104	43106	43106	Rowland	281	" My dear boy , "
43108	43135	43106	43106	Rowland	281	" do n't talk about the will being ' destined . ' The will is destiny itself . That 's the way to look at it . "
43136	43145	43146	43146	Roderick	186	" Look at it , my dear Rowland , "
43149	43167	43168	43168	he	186	" as you find most comfortable . One conviction I have gathered from my summer 's experience , "
43172	43201	43168	43168	he	186	" it 's as well to look it frankly in the face - is that I possess an almost unlimited susceptibility to the influence of a beautiful woman . "
43556	43566	43567	43567	he	186	" Who is it ? what does it mean ? "
43570	43575	43577	43577	Roderick	186	" Anything you please ! "
43584	43591	43577	43577	Roderick	186	" I call it A Reminiscence . "
43606	43918	43596	43600	one of the Baden ladies	1186	" and asked no more questions . This , after all , was a way of profiting by experience . A few days later he took his first ride of the season on the Campagna , and as , on his homeward way , he was passing across the long shadow of a ruined tower , he perceived a small figure at a short distance , bent over a sketch - book . As he drew near , he recognized his friend Singleton . The honest little painter 's face was scorched to flame - color by the light of southern suns , and borrowed an even deeper crimson from his gleeful greeting of his most appreciative patron . He was making a careful and charming little sketch . On Rowland 's asking him how he had spent his summer , he gave an account of his wanderings which made poor Mallet sigh with a sense of more contrasts than one . He had not been out of Italy , but he had been delving deep into the picturesque heart of the lovely land , and gathering a wonderful store of subjects . He had rambled about among the unvisited villages of the Apennines , pencil in hand and knapsack on back , sleeping on straw and eating black bread and beans , but feasting on local color , rioting , as it were , on chiaroscuro , and laying up a treasure of pictorial observations . He took a devout satisfaction in his hard - earned wisdom and his happy frugality . Rowland went the next day , by appointment , to look at his sketches , and spent a whole morning turning them over . Singleton talked more than he had ever done before , explained them all , and told some quaintly humorous anecdote about the production of each .
43919	43928	43929	43929	he	1188	" Dear me , how I have chattered ! "
43934	43977	43929	43929	he	1188	" I am afraid you had rather have looked at the things in peace and quiet . I did n't know I could talk so much . But somehow , I feel very happy ; I feel as if I had improved . "
43978	43983	43985	43985	Rowland	281	" That you have , "
43987	44010	43985	43985	Rowland	281	" I doubt whether an artist ever passed a more profitable three months . You must feel much more sure of yourself . "
44027	44030	44031	44031	he	214	" Yes , "
44041	44056	44031	44031	he	214	" I feel much more sure of myself . I have got more facility ! "
44077	44123	44058	44058	he	214	" I hardly like to say it , for fear I should after all be mistaken . But since it strikes you , perhaps it 's true . It 's a great happiness ; I would not exchange it for a great deal of money . "
44124	44135	44137	44137	Rowland	281	" Yes , I suppose it 's a great happiness , "
44139	44174	44137	44137	Rowland	281	" I shall really think of you as living here in a state of scandalous bliss . I do n't believe it 's good for an artist to be in such brutally high spirits . "
44212	44217	44218	44218	he	214	" And Mr. Hudson ? "
44226	44235	44218	44218	he	214	" I hope he is well and happy . "
44236	44242	44244	44244	Rowland	281	" He is very well , "
44246	44254	44244	44244	Rowland	281	" He is back at work again . "
44255	44263	44265	44265	Singleton	214	" Ah , there 's a man , "
44267	44318	44265	44265	Singleton	214	" who has taken his start once for all , and does n't need to stop and ask himself in fear and trembling every month or two whether he is advancing or not . When he stops , it 's to rest ! And where did he spend his summer ? "
44319	44330	44244	44244	Rowland	281	" The greater part of it at Baden - Baden . "
44331	44341	44343	44343	Singleton	214	" Ah , that 's in the Black Forest , "
44349	44361	44343	44343	Singleton	214	" They say you can make capital studies of trees there . "
44362	44366	44368	44368	Rowland	281	" No doubt , "
44387	44418	44419	44419	he	214	" Unfortunately trees are not Roderick 's line . Nevertheless , he tells me that at Baden he made some studies . Come when you can , by the way , "
44425	44443	44444	44444	Singleton	214	" to his studio , and tell me what you think of something he has lately begun . "
44639	44651	44652	44652	Gloriani	213	" Certainly ; I liked it as well as I said , "
44662	44730	44652	44652	Gloriani	213	" or rather I liked it a great deal better . I did n't say how much , for fear of making your friend angry . But one can leave him alone now , for he 's coming round . I told you he could n't keep up the transcendental style , and he has already broken down . Do n't you see it yourself , man ? "
44731	44741	44743	44743	Rowland	281	" I do n't particularly like this new statue , "
44745	44823	44652	44652	Gloriani	213	" That 's because you 're a purist . It 's deuced clever , it 's deuced knowing , it 's deuced pretty , but it is n't the topping high art of three months ago . He has taken his turn sooner than I supposed . What has happened to him ? Has he been disappointed in love ? But that 's none of my business . I congratulate him on having become a practical man . "
44883	44894	44896	44896	he	186	" Is this of necessity what a fellow must come to "
44932	45070	44908	44908	his	186	" this damnable uncertainty when he goes to bed at night as to whether he is going to wake up in a working humor or in a swearing humor ? Have we only a season , over before we know it , in which we can call our faculties our own ? Six months ago I could stand up to my work like a man , day after day , and never dream of asking myself whether I felt like it . But now , some mornings , it 's the very devil to get going . My statue looks so bad when I come into the studio that I have twenty minds to smash it on the spot , and I lose three or four hours in sitting there , moping and getting used to it . "
45117	45123	45125	45125	Roderick	186	" Gloriani 's an ass ! "
45324	45331	45332	45332	Rowland	281	" What do you think yourself ? "
45344	45352	45353	45353	Roderick	186	" I think it is curiously bad , "
45356	45399	45400	45400	he	186	" It was bad from the first ; it has fundamental vices . I have shuffled them in a measure out of sight , but I have not corrected them . I ca n't - I ca n't - I ca n't ! "
45404	45418	45400	45400	he	186	" They stare me in the face - they are all I see ! "
45481	45506	45507	45507	Roderick	186	" I wish to heaven some person in particular would buy it , and take it off my hands and out of my sight ! "
45510	45518	45519	45519	he	186	" What am I to do now ? "
45523	45558	45519	45519	he	186	" I have n't an idea . I think of subjects , but they remain mere lifeless names . They are mere words - they are not images . What am I to do ? "
45565	45570	45571	45571	he	186	" Be a man , "
45579	45596	45571	45571	he	186	" and do n't , for heaven 's sake , talk in that confoundedly querulous voice . "
45626	45632	45633	45633	he	186	" Talk of the devil , "
45636	45655	45633	45633	he	186	" and you see his horns ! If that 's not a customer , it ought to be . "
45886	45896	45898	45900	the elder lady	632	" I trust we are at liberty to enter , "
45905	45932	45898	45900	the elder lady	632	" We were told that Mr. Hudson had no fixed day , and that we might come at any time . Let us not disturb you . "
46006	46010	46011	46011	he	186	" By Jove ! "
46015	46025	46026	46026	Rowland	281	" it 's that goddess of the Villa Ludovisi ! "
46057	46066	46067	46067	he	186	" I have been in many a studio ! "
46082	46089	46091	46092	his companion	555	" We are going about everywhere , "
46094	46102	46091	46092	his companion	555	" I am passionately fond of art ! "
46309	46317	46318	46318	she	716	" Yes , he 's very handsome , "
46321	46337	46318	46318	she	716	" He 's a Florentine . The dogs in Florence are handsomer than the people . "
46345	46351	46352	46352	she	716	" His name is Stenterello , "
46355	46365	46352	46352	she	716	" Stenterello , give your hand to the gentleman . "
46373	46380	46352	46352	she	716	" Say buon giorno a lei . "
46406	46423	46424	46424	she	632	" My dear , my dear , remember where you are ! Excuse my foolish child , "
46435	46445	46424	46424	she	632	" She can think of nothing but her poodle . "
46446	46456	46457	46459	the young girl	659	" I am teaching him to talk for me , "
46468	46499	46457	46459	the young girl	659	" to say little things in society . It will save me a great deal of trouble . Stenterello , love , give a pretty smile and say tanti complimenti ! "
46533	46540	46542	46542	Rowland	281	" He is a wonderful beast , "
46544	46551	46553	46555	the young girl	659	" He is not a beast , "
46557	46572	46553	46555	the young girl	659	" A beast is something black and dirty - something you ca n't touch . "
46573	46581	46582	46584	the elder lady	632	" He is a very valuable dog , "
46587	46599	46582	46584	the elder lady	632	" He was presented to my daughter by a Florentine nobleman . "
46600	46623	46553	46555	the young girl	659	" It is not for that I care about him . It is for himself . He is better than the prince . "
46624	46631	46633	46634	the mother	1240	" My dear , my dear ! "
46969	46977	46978	46978	he	1264	" I have not done my duty , "
46981	46994	46978	46978	he	1264	" in not announcing these ladies . Mrs. Light , Miss Light ! "
47042	47060	47019	47019	He	186	" I do n't pretend to have anything of an exhibition - I am only a novice . "
47061	47076	47077	47078	Mrs. Light	253	" Indeed ? - a novice ! For a novice this is very well , "
47081	47092	47077	47078	Mrs. Light	253	" Cavaliere , we have seen nothing better than this . "
47098	47103	47104	47104	he	255	" It is stupendous ! "
47107	47117	47104	47104	he	255	" And we have been to all the studios . "
47118	47126	47128	47129	Mrs. Light	253	" Not to all - heaven forbid ! "
47131	47171	47172	47172	she	253	" But to a number that I have had pointed out by artistic friends . I delight in studios : they are the temples of the beautiful here below . And if you are a novice , Mr. Hudson , "
47176	47199	47172	47172	she	253	" you have already great admirers . Half a dozen people have told us that yours were among the things to see . "
47225	47250	47206	47206	Roderick	186	" Ah , he 's gone to look at my beautiful daughter ; he is not the first that has had his head turned , "
47280	47322	47256	47256	her	253	" The artists are all crazy about her . When she goes into a studio she is fatal to the pictures . And when she goes into a ball - room what do the other women say ? Eh , Cavaliere ? "
47323	47329	47330	47330	Rowland	281	" She is very beautiful , "
47442	47449	47450	47450	she	253	" Are you also an artist ? "
47471	47496	47463	47463	she	253	" Be so good as to assure me without delay that you are really the young man of substance and amiability that you appear . "
47510	47525	47498	47498	Rowland	281	" Dear me , no ; I am only a friend of Mr. Hudson . "
47626	47637	47638	47638	she	253	" Ah , you 're a patron of the arts , "
47641	47848	47638	47638	she	253	" That 's what I should like to be if I had a little money . I delight in beauty in every form . But all these people ask such monstrous prices . One must be a millionaire , to think of such things , eh ? Twenty years ago my husband had my portrait painted , here in Rome , by Papucci , who was the great man in those days . I was in a ball dress , with all my jewels , my neck and arms , and all that . The man got six hundred francs , and thought he was very well treated . Those were the days when a family could live like princes in Italy for five thousand scudi a year . The Cavaliere once upon a time was a great dandy - do n't blush , Cavaliere ; any one can see that , just as any one can see that I was once a pretty woman ! Get him to tell you what he made a figure upon . The railroads have brought in the vulgarians . That 's what I call it now - the invasion of the vulgarians ! What are poor we to do ? "
47873	47876	47866	47867	Miss Light	254	" Mamma ! "
47877	47882	47866	47867	Miss Light	254	" My own love ? "
47883	47897	47866	47867	Miss Light	254	" This gentleman wishes to model my bust . Please speak to him . "
47905	47908	47909	47909	he	255	" Already ? "
47978	47986	47987	47989	the young girl	659	" He saw me a year ago , "
47993	48004	47987	47989	the young girl	659	" and he has been thinking of me ever since . "
48033	48048	48050	48050	Roderick	186	" I must make your daughter 's bust - that 's all , madame ! "
48055	48065	48067	48069	the young girl	659	" I had rather you made the poodle 's , "
48071	48105	48067	48069	the young girl	659	" Is it very tiresome ? I have spent half my life sitting for my photograph , in every conceivable attitude and with every conceivable coiffure . I think I have posed enough . "
48106	48111	48113	48114	Mrs. Light	253	" My dear child , "
48116	48171	48113	48114	Mrs. Light	253	" it may be one 's duty to pose . But as to my daughter 's sitting to you , sir - to a young sculptor whom we do n't know - it is a matter that needs reflection . It is not a favor that 's to be had for the mere asking . "
48172	48182	48184	48184	Roderick	186	" If I do n't make her from life , "
48189	48217	48184	48184	Roderick	186	" I will make her from memory , and if the thing 's to be done , you had better have it done as well as possible . "
48218	48222	48224	48225	Miss Light	254	" Mamma hesitates , "
48227	48257	48224	48225	Miss Light	254	" because she does n't know whether you mean she shall pay you for the bust . I can assure you that she will not pay you a sou . "
48258	48266	48268	48269	Mrs. Light	253	" My darling , you forget yourself , "
48278	48282	48283	48283	she	253	" Of course , "
48296	48305	48283	48283	she	253	" the bust would be my own property . "
48306	48310	48312	48312	Roderick	186	" Of course ! "
48316	48320	48322	48324	the young girl	659	" Dearest mother , "
48326	48350	48322	48324	the young girl	659	" how can you carry a marble bust about the world with you ? Is it not enough to drag the poor original ? "
48351	48359	48361	48362	Mrs. Light	253	" My dear , you 're nonsensical ! "
48367	48374	48376	48378	the young girl	659	" You can always sell it , "
48400	48409	48390	48390	Rowland	281	" She is very wicked to - day ! "
48451	48458	48459	48459	he	1279	" You had better not refuse , "
48465	48491	48459	48459	he	1279	" until you have seen Mr. Hudson 's things in the marble . Your mother is to come and look at some that I possess . "
48492	48530	48462	48463	Miss Light	254	" Thank you ; I have no doubt you will see us . I dare say Mr. Hudson is very clever ; but I do n't care for modern sculpture . I ca n't look at it ! "
48531	48543	48545	48545	Roderick	186	" You shall care for my bust , I promise you ! "
48551	48557	48559	48560	the Cavaliere	1279	" To satisfy Miss Light , "
48562	48574	48559	48560	the Cavaliere	1279	" one of the old Greeks ought to come to life . "
48575	48583	48585	48585	Roderick	186	" It would be worth his while , "
48598	48631	48559	48560	the Cavaliere	1279	" I might sit to Phidias , if he would promise to be very amusing and make me laugh . What do you say , Stenterello ? would you sit to Phidias ? "
48632	48642	48644	48645	Mrs. Light	253	" We must talk of this some other time , "
48647	48665	48644	48645	Mrs. Light	253	" We are in Rome for the winter . Many thanks . Cavaliere , call the carriage . "
48702	48710	48712	48712	Roderick	186	" Immortal powers , what a head ! "
48719	48725	48712	48712	Roderick	186	" There 's my fortune ! "
48726	48733	48735	48735	Rowland	281	" She is certainly very beautiful , "
48737	48749	48735	48735	Rowland	281	" But I ' m sorry you have undertaken her bust . "
48750	48756	48712	48712	Roderick	186	" And why , pray ? "
48757	48767	48735	48735	Rowland	281	" I suspect it will bring trouble with it . "
48768	48774	48712	48712	Roderick	186	" What kind of trouble ? "
48775	48806	48735	48735	Rowland	281	" I hardly know . They are queer people . The mamma , I suspect , is the least bit of an adventuress . Heaven knows what the daughter is . "
48807	48813	48815	48815	Roderick	186	" She 's a goddess ! "
48817	48828	48735	48735	Rowland	281	" Just so . She is all the more dangerous . "
48829	48847	48735	48735	Rowland	281	" Dangerous ? What will she do to me ? She does n't bite , I imagine . "
48848	48898	48735	48735	Rowland	281	" It remains to be seen . There are two kinds of women - you ought to know it by this time - the safe and the unsafe . Miss Light , if I am not mistaken , is one of the unsafe . A word to the wise ! "
48899	48903	48905	48905	Roderick	186	" Much obliged ! "
48937	48941	48942	48942	Rowland	281	" queer people , "
49128	49138	49140	49142	this judicious critic	1311	" I have known the mamma for twenty years , "
49144	50097	49140	49142	this judicious critic	1311	" and if you ask any of the people who have been living here as long as I , you will find they remember her well . I have held the beautiful Christina on my knee when she was a little wizened baby with a very red face and no promise of beauty but those magnificent eyes . Ten years ago Mrs. Light disappeared , and has not since been seen in Rome , except for a few days last winter , when she passed through on her way to Naples . Then it was you met the trio in the Ludovisi gardens . When I first knew her she was the unmarried but very marriageable daughter of an old American painter of very bad landscapes , which people used to buy from charity and use for fire - boards . His name was Savage ; it used to make every one laugh , he was such a mild , melancholy , pitiful old gentleman . He had married a horrible wife , an Englishwoman who had been on the stage . It was said she used to beat poor Savage with his mahl - stick and when the domestic finances were low to lock him up in his studio and tell him he should n't come out until he had painted half a dozen of his daubs . She had a good deal of showy beauty . She would then go forth , and , her beauty helping , she would make certain people take the pictures . It helped her at last to make an English lord run away with her . At the time I speak of she had quite disappeared . Mrs. Light was then a very handsome girl , though by no means so handsome as her daughter has now become . Mr. Light was an American consul , newly appointed at one of the Adriatic ports . He was a mild , fair - whiskered young man , with some little property , and my impression is that he had got into bad company at home , and that his family procured him his place to keep him out of harm 's way . He came up to Rome on a holiday , fell in love with Miss Savage , and married her on the spot . He had not been married three years when he was drowned in the Adriatic , no one ever knew how . The young widow came back to Rome , to her father , and here shortly afterwards , in the shadow of Saint Peter 's , her little girl was born . It might have been supposed that Mrs. Light would marry again , and I know she had opportunities . But she overreached herself . She would take nothing less than a title and a fortune , and they were not forthcoming . She was admired and very fond of admiration ; very vain , very worldly , very silly . She remained a pretty widow , with a surprising variety of bonnets and a dozen men always in her train . Giacosa dates from this period . He calls himself a Roman , but I have an impression he came up from Ancona with her . He was l'ami de la maison . He used to hold her bouquets , clean her gloves I was told , run her errands , get her opera - boxes , and fight her battles with the shopkeepers . For this he needed courage , for she was smothered in debt . She at last left Rome to escape her creditors . Many of them must remember her still , but she seems now to have money to satisfy them . She left her poor old father here alone - helpless , infirm and unable to work . A subscription was shortly afterwards taken up among the foreigners , and he was sent back to America , where , as I afterwards heard , he died in some sort of asylum . From time to time , for several years , I heard vaguely of Mrs. Light as a wandering beauty at French and German watering - places . Once came a rumor that she was going to make a grand marriage in England ; then we heard that the gentleman had thought better of it and left her to keep afloat as she could . She was a terribly scatter - brained creature . She pretends to be a great lady , but I consider that old Filomena , my washer - woman , is in essentials a greater one . But certainly , after all , she has been fortunate . She embarked at last on a lawsuit about some property , with her husband 's family , and went to America to attend to it . She came back triumphant , with a long purse . She reappeared in Italy , and established herself for a while in Venice . Then she came to Florence , where she spent a couple of years and where I saw her . Last year she passed down to Naples , which I should have said was just the place for her , and this winter she has laid siege to Rome . She seems very prosperous . She has taken a floor in the Palazzo F - - , she keeps her carriage , and Christina and she , between them , must have a pretty milliner 's bill . Giacosa has turned up again , looking as if he had been kept on ice at Ancona , for her return . "
50098	50104	50105	50105	Rowland	281	" What sort of education , "
50108	50123	50105	50105	Rowland	281	" do you imagine the mother 's adventures to have been for the daughter ? "
50124	50603	49140	49142	this judicious critic	1311	" A strange school ! But Mrs. Light told me , in Florence , that she had given her child the education of a princess . In other words , I suppose , she speaks three or four languages , and has read several hundred French novels . Christina , I suspect , is very clever . When I saw her , I was amazed at her beauty , and , certainly , if there is any truth in faces , she ought to have the soul of an angel . Perhaps she has . I do n't judge her ; she 's an extraordinary young person . She has been told twenty times a day by her mother , since she was five years old , that she is a beauty of beauties , that her face is her fortune , and that , if she plays her cards , she may marry a duke . If she has not been fatally corrupted , she is a very superior girl . My own impression is that she is a mixture of good and bad , of ambition and indifference . Mrs. Light , having failed to make her own fortune in matrimony , has transferred her hopes to her daughter , and nursed them till they have become a kind of monomania . She has a hobby , which she rides in secret ; but some day she will let you see it . I ' m sure that if you go in some evening unannounced , you will find her scanning the tea - leaves in her cup , or telling her daughter 's fortune with a greasy pack of cards , preserved for the purpose . She promises her a prince - a reigning prince . But if Mrs. Light is silly , she is shrewd , too , and , lest considerations of state should deny her prince the luxury of a love - match , she keeps on hand a few common mortals . At the worst she would take a duke , an English lord , or even a young American with a proper number of millions . The poor woman must be rather uncomfortable . She is always building castles and knocking them down again - always casting her nets and pulling them in . If her daughter were less of a beauty , her transparent ambition would be very ridiculous ; but there is something in the girl , as one looks at her , that seems to make it very possible she is marked out for one of those wonderful romantic fortunes that history now and then relates . ' Who , after all , was the Empress of the French ? ' Mrs. Light is forever saying . ' And beside Christina the Empress is a dowdy ! ' "
50604	50611	50748	50749	Madame Grandoni	217	" And what does Christina say ? "
50612	50736	49140	49142	this judicious critic	1311	" She makes no scruple , as you know , of saying that her mother is a fool . What she thinks , heaven knows . I suspect that , practically , she does not commit herself . She is excessively proud , and thinks herself good enough to occupy the highest station in the world ; but she knows that her mother talks nonsense , and that even a beautiful girl may look awkward in making unsuccessful advances . So she remains superbly indifferent , and lets her mother take the risks . If the prince is secured , so much the better ; if he is not , she need never confess to herself that even a prince has slighted her . "
50737	50744	50745	50745	Rowland	281	" Your report is as solid , "
50754	50767	50745	50745	Rowland	281	" as if it had been prepared for the Academy of Sciences ; "
50845	50850	50851	50851	she	253	" Upon my word , "
50854	51012	50851	50851	she	253	" you men know how to make yourselves comfortable . If one of us poor women had half as many easy - chairs and knick - knacks , we should be famously abused . It 's really selfish to be living all alone in such a place as this . Cavaliere , how should you like this suite of rooms and a fortune to fill them with pictures and statues ? Christina , love , look at that mosaic table . Mr. Mallet , I could almost beg it from you . Yes , that Eve is certainly very fine . We need n't be ashamed of such a great - grandmother as that . If she was really such a beautiful woman , it accounts for the good looks of some of us . Where is Mr. What 's - his - name , the young sculptor ? Why is n't he here to be complimented ? "
51112	51119	51120	51120	she	192	" It 's an odd jumble , "
51124	51201	51202	51202	she	192	" Some things are very pretty - some are very ugly . But I like ugly things , when they have a certain look . Prettiness is terribly vulgar nowadays , and it is not every one that knows just the sort of ugliness that has chic . But chic is getting dreadfully common too . There 's a hint of it even in Madame Baldi 's bonnets . I like looking at people 's things , "
51218	51228	51202	51202	she	192	" It helps you to find out their characters . "
51229	51235	51237	51237	Rowland	281	" Am I to suppose , "
51241	51253	51237	51237	Rowland	281	" that you have arrived at any conclusions as to mine ? "
51254	51328	51202	51202	she	192	" I am rather muddled ; you have too many things ; one seems to contradict another . You are very artistic and yet you are very prosaic ; you have what is called a ' catholic ' taste and yet you are full of obstinate little prejudices and habits of thought , which , if I knew you , I should find very tiresome . I do n't think I like you . "
51329	51336	51338	51338	Rowland	281	" You make a great mistake , "
51340	51349	51338	51338	Rowland	281	" I assure you I am very amiable . "
51350	51392	51202	51202	she	192	" Yes , I am probably wrong , and if I knew you , I should find out I was wrong , and that would irritate me and make me dislike you more . So you see we are necessary enemies . "
51393	51402	51338	51338	Rowland	281	" No , I do n't dislike you . "
51403	51416	51202	51202	she	192	" Worse and worse ; for you certainly will not like me . "
51417	51423	51338	51338	Rowland	281	" You are very discouraging . "
51424	51449	51202	51202	she	192	" I am fond of facing the truth , though some day you will deny that . Where is that queer friend of yours ? "
51450	51464	51338	51338	Rowland	281	" You mean Mr. Hudson . He is represented by these beautiful works . "
51476	51479	51480	51480	she	254	" Yes , "
51483	51509	51480	51480	she	254	" they are not so silly as most of the things we have seen . They have no chic , and yet they are beautiful . "
51510	51516	51518	51518	Rowland	281	" You describe them perfectly , "
51520	51536	51518	51518	Rowland	281	" They are beautiful , and yet they have no chic . That 's it ! "
51537	51570	51630	51631	The Cavaliere	1279	" If he will promise to put none into my bust , I have a mind to let him make it . A request made in those terms deserves to be granted . "
51571	51576	51518	51518	Rowland	281	" In what terms ? "
51577	51629	51630	51631	The Cavaliere	1279	" Did n't you hear him ? ' Mademoiselle , you almost satisfy my conception of the beautiful . I must model your bust . ' That almost should be rewarded . He is like me ; he likes to face the truth . I think we should get on together . "
51645	51648	51518	51518	Rowland	281	" collection . "
51812	51820	51821	51821	he	1279	" You do me too much honor , "
51824	51836	51821	51821	he	1279	" If you will allow me - it is not impossible ! "
51847	51868	51869	51869	she	253	" If you are not afraid to come and see two quiet little women , we shall be most happy ! "
51872	51891	51869	51869	she	253	" We have no statues nor pictures - we have nothing but each other . Eh , darling ? "
51892	51898	51900	51900	Christina	192	" I beg your pardon , "
51902	51909	51911	51912	her mother	369	" Oh , and the Cavaliere , "
51914	51920	51922	51924	the young girl	659	" The poodle , please ! "
52051	52057	52058	52058	she	253	" I am keeping guard ! "
52652	52657	52705	52705	He	1279	" But afterwards ... ? "
52911	52926	52927	52927	he	186	" For a man of my temperament , Rome is the only possible place , "
52930	52954	52927	52927	he	186	" it 's better to recognize the fact early than late . So I shall never go home unless I am absolutely forced . "
52955	52965	52967	52967	Rowland	281	" What is your idea of ' force ' ? "
52971	52989	52967	52967	Rowland	281	" It seems to me you have an excellent reason for going home some day or other . "
52990	52998	52999	52999	Roderick	186	" Ah , you mean my engagement ? "
53005	53021	53023	53023	he	186	" Yes , I am distinctly engaged , in Northampton , and impatiently waited for ! "
53030	53077	53023	53023	he	186	" To reconcile Northampton and Rome is rather a problem . Mary had better come out here . Even at the worst I have no intention of giving up Rome within six or eight years , and an engagement of that duration would be rather absurd . "
53078	53087	53088	53088	Rowland	281	" Miss Garland could hardly leave your mother , "
53091	53161	53162	53162	he	186	" Oh , of course my mother should come . I think I will suggest it in my next letter . It will take her a year or two to make up her mind to it , but if she consents it will brighten her up . It 's too small a life , over there , even for a timid old lady . It is hard to imagine , "
53165	53214	53162	53162	he	186	" any change in Mary being a change for the better ; but I should like her to take a look at the world and have her notions stretched a little . One is never so good , I suppose , but that one can improve a little . "
53215	53227	53228	53228	Rowland	281	" If you wish your mother and Miss Garland to come , "
53231	53241	53228	53228	Rowland	281	" you had better go home and bring them . "
53242	53258	53259	53259	Roderick	186	" Oh , I ca n't think of leaving Europe , for many a day , "
53262	53303	53259	53259	Roderick	186	" At present it would quite break the charm . I am just beginning to profit , to get used to things and take them naturally . I am sure the sight of Northampton Main Street would permanently upset me . "
53319	53322	53310	53310	Roderick	186	" just beginning "
54264	54271	54272	54272	she	192	" Do it yourself , then ! "
54362	54368	54370	54370	Rowland	281	" Hudson 's a sculptor , "
54375	54384	54370	54370	Rowland	281	" But if I were only a painter ! "
54385	54392	54394	54394	Christina	192	" Thank Heaven you are not ! "
54396	54410	54394	54394	Christina	192	" I am having quite enough of this minute inspection of my charms . "
54411	54420	54422	54423	Mrs. Light	253	" My dear young man , hands off ! "
54434	54443	54422	54423	Mrs. Light	253	" Christina , love , I am surprised . "
54444	54449	54450	54450	Christina	192	" Is it indelicate ? "
54453	54461	54450	54450	Christina	192	" I beg Mr. Mallet 's pardon . "
54514	54516	54522	54522	he	1384	" points "
54534	54541	54543	54543	Christina	192	" Mamma 's not really shocked , "
54560	54586	54550	54550	she	192	" She is only afraid that Mr. Hudson might have injured my hair , and that , per consequenza , I should sell for less . "
54587	54592	54594	54594	mamma	257	" You unnatural child ! "
54596	54608	54594	54594	mamma	257	" You deserve that I should make a fright of you ! "
54638	54652	54653	54653	Rowland	281	" What does your mother do when she wants to do you justice ? "
54667	54694	54695	54696	Mrs. Light	253	" I do her justice when I say she says very improper things . What is one to do with such a thorn in the flesh ? "
54699	54710	54712	54712	Christina	192	" Think of it at your leisure , Mr. Mallet , "
54714	54926	54712	54712	Christina	192	" and when you ' ve discovered something , let us hear . But I must tell you that I shall not willingly believe in any remedy of yours , for you have something in your physiognomy that particularly provokes me to make the remarks that my mother so sincerely deplores . I noticed it the first time I saw you . I think it 's because your face is so broad . For some reason or other , broad faces exasperate me ; they fill me with a kind of rabbia . Last summer , at Carlsbad , there was an Austrian count , with enormous estates and some great office at court . He was very attentive - seriously so ; he was really very far gone . Cela ne tenait qu ' a moi ! But I could n't ; he was impossible ! He must have measured , from ear to ear , at least a yard and a half . And he was blond , too , which made it worse - as blond as Stenterello ; pure fleece ! So I said to him frankly , ' Many thanks , Herr Graf ; your uniform is magnificent , but your face is too fat . ' "
54927	54935	54937	54937	Rowland	281	" I am afraid that mine also , "
54954	54954	54937	54937	Rowland	281	"
54955	55063	54712	54712	Christina	192	" Oh , I take it you know very well that we are looking for a husband , and that none but tremendous swells need apply . Surely , before these gentlemen , mamma , I may speak freely ; they are disinterested . Mr. Mallet wo n't do , because , though he 's rich , he 's not rich enough . Mamma made that discovery the day after we went to see you , moved to it by the promising look of your furniture . I hope she was right , eh ? Unless you have millions , you know , you have no chance . "
55064	55071	55073	55073	Rowland	281	" I feel like a beggar , "
55075	55120	55121	55121	Roderick	186	" Oh , some better girl than I will decide some day , after mature reflection , that on the whole you have enough . Mr. Hudson , of course , is nowhere ; he has nothing but his genius and his beaux yeux . "
55164	55178	55179	55179	he	186	" Let me model you , and he who can may marry you ! "
55202	55213	55214	55214	she	253	" She is not so silly as you might suppose , "
55222	55240	55214	55214	she	253	" If you will give me your arm , we will go and look at the bust . "
55241	55249	55250	55250	Christina	192	" Does that represent a silly girl ? "
55272	55279	55280	55280	he	186	" It represents a young lady , "
55283	55295	55280	55280	he	186	" whom I should not pretend to judge off - hand . "
55296	55332	55250	55250	Christina	192	" She may be a fool , but you are not sure . Many thanks ! You have seen me half a dozen times . You are either very slow or I am very deep . "
55333	55339	55341	55341	Rowland	281	" I am certainly slow , "
55343	55359	55341	55341	Rowland	281	" I do n't expect to make up my mind about you within six months . "
55360	55389	55250	55250	Christina	192	" I give you six months if you will promise then a perfectly frank opinion . Mind , I shall not forget ; I shall insist upon it . "
55390	55403	55405	55405	Rowland	281	" Well , though I am slow , I am tolerably brave , "
55407	55412	55405	55405	Rowland	281	" We shall see . "
55422	55430	55431	55431	she	192	" I am afraid , after all , "
55434	55486	55431	55431	she	192	" that there 's very little wisdom in it save what the artist has put there . Mr. Hudson looked particularly wise while he was working ; he scowled and growled , but he never opened his mouth . It is very kind of him not to have represented me gaping . "
55487	55499	55501	55501	Roderick	186	" If I had talked a lot of stuff to you , "
55505	55517	55501	55501	Roderick	186	" the thing would not have been a tenth so good . "
55518	55541	55413	55413	Christina	192	" Is it good , after all ? Mr. Mallet is a famous connoisseur ; has he not come here to pronounce ? "
55668	55678	55680	55681	Mrs. Light	253	" Nay , how can you be so cruel ? "
55687	55695	55680	55681	Mrs. Light	253	" It is surely a wonderful thing ! "
55696	55705	55707	55707	Roderick	186	" Rowland knows it 's a wonderful thing , "
55711	55738	55707	55707	Roderick	186	" I can tell that by his face . The other day I finished something he thought bad , and he looked very differently from this . "
55739	55746	55748	55748	Christina	192	" How did Mr. Mallet look ? "
55750	55755	55757	55757	Roderick	186	" My dear Rowland , "
55759	55781	55757	55757	Roderick	186	" I am speaking of my seated woman . You looked as if you had on a pair of tight boots . "
55782	55794	55796	55797	Mrs. Light	253	" Ah , my child , you 'll not understand that ! "
55799	55811	55796	55797	Mrs. Light	253	" You never yet had a pair that were small enough . "
55812	55821	55823	55823	Christina	192	" It 's a pity , Mr. Hudson , "
55827	55852	55823	55823	Christina	192	" that you could not have introduced my feet into the bust . But we can hang a pair of slippers round the neck ! "
55853	55862	55863	55863	Rowland	281	" I nevertheless like your statues , Roderick , "
55866	55884	55863	55863	Rowland	281	" better than your jokes . This is admirable . Miss Light , you may be proud ! "
55885	55896	55898	55900	the young girl	659	" Thank you , Mr. Mallet , for the permission , "
55902	55921	55923	55924	Mrs. Light	253	" I am dying to see it in the marble , with a red velvet screen behind it , "
55926	55933	55934	55934	Christina	192	" Placed there under the Sassoferrato ! "
55938	55997	55934	55934	Christina	192	" I hope you keep well in mind , Mr. Hudson , that you have not a grain of property in your work , and that if mamma chooses , she may have it photographed and the copies sold in the Piazza di Spagna , at five francs apiece , without your having a sou of the profits . "
55998	56001	56003	56003	Roderick	186	" Amen ! "
56005	56019	56021	56021	he	186	" It was so nominated in the bond . My profits are here ! "
56026	56036	56038	56038	Christina	192	" It would be prettier if you said here ! "
56043	56054	56056	56057	Mrs. Light	253	" My precious child , how you do run on ! "
56059	56065	56066	56068	the young girl	659	" It is Mr. Mallet , "
56071	56099	56100	56100	she	253	" I ca n't talk a word of sense so long as he is in the room . I do n't say that to make you go , "
56103	56112	56100	56100	she	253	" I say it simply to justify myself . "
56212	56218	56220	56220	Rowland	281	" Sleeping at his post ! "
56226	56233	56235	56236	Mrs. Light	253	" That 's a punishable offense , "
56275	56282	56283	56283	he	255	" Excuse me , dear lady , "
56286	56297	56283	56283	he	255	" I was overcome by the - the great heat . "
56298	56303	56305	56306	the lady	845	" Nonsense , Cavaliere ! "
56308	56333	56305	56306	the lady	845	" you know we are perishing here with the cold ! You had better go and cool yourself in one of the other rooms . "
56334	56341	56343	56344	the Cavaliere	1279	" I obey , dear lady , "
56548	56556	56558	56558	Rowland	281	" You do n't keep your promise , "
56560	56584	56558	56558	Rowland	281	" to come and see me . Do n't forget it . I want you to tell me about Rome thirty years ago . "
56585	56643	56676	56677	the Cavaliere	1279	" Thirty years ago ? Ah , dear sir , Rome is Rome still ; a place where strange things happen ! But happy things too , since I have your renewed permission to call . You do me too much honor . Is it in the morning or in the evening that I should least intrude ? "
56644	56662	56664	56664	Rowland	281	" Take your own time , Cavaliere ; only come , sometime . I depend upon you , "
56779	56781	56783	56783	Christina	192	" attentive "
56950	56958	56959	56959	he	186	" I had no idea of it , "
56962	57041	56959	56959	he	186	" till I began to look at her with an eye to reproducing line for line and curve for curve . Her face is the most exquisite piece of modeling that ever came from creative hands . Not a line without meaning , not a hair 's breadth that is not admirably finished . And then her mouth ! It 's as if a pair of lips had been shaped to utter pure truth without doing it dishonor ! "
57072	57081	57082	57082	he	186	" I ' ve quite forgotten her beauty , "
57085	57118	57082	57082	he	186	" or rather I have ceased to perceive it as something distinct and defined , something independent of the rest of her . She is all one , and all consummately interesting ! "
57119	57135	57136	57136	Rowland	281	" What does she do - what does she say , that is so remarkable ? "
57140	57263	57082	57082	he	186	" Say ? Sometimes nothing - sometimes everything . She is never the same . Sometimes she walks in and takes her place without a word , without a smile , gravely , stiffly , as if it were an awful bore . She hardly looks at me , and she walks away without even glancing at my work . On other days she laughs and chatters and asks endless questions , and pours out the most irresistible nonsense . She is a creature of moods ; you ca n't count upon her ; she keeps observation on the stretch . And then , bless you , she has seen such a lot ! Her talk is full of the oddest allusions ! "
57264	57276	57278	57278	Rowland	281	" It is altogether a very singular type of young lady , "
57290	57381	57278	57278	Rowland	281	" It may be a charm , but it is certainly not the orthodox charm of marriageable maidenhood , the charm of shrinking innocence and soft docility . Our American girls are accused of being more knowing than any others , and Miss Light is nominally an American . But it has taken twenty years of Europe to make her what she is . The first time we saw her , I remember you called her a product of the old world , and certainly you were not far wrong . "
57382	57390	57392	57392	Roderick	186	" Ah , she has an atmosphere , "
57401	57406	57407	57407	Rowland	281	" Young unmarried women , "
57420	57420	57407	57407	Rowland	281	"
57421	57430	57432	57433	his companion	555	" Ah , you do n't forgive her , "
57435	57461	57432	57433	his companion	555	" for hitting you so hard ! A man ought to be flattered at such a girl as that taking so much notice of him . "
57462	57476	57407	57407	Rowland	281	" A man is never flattered at a woman 's not liking him . "
57477	57515	57432	57433	his companion	555	" Are you sure she does n't like you ? That 's to the credit of your humility . A fellow of more vanity might , on the evidence , persuade himself that he was in favor . "
57516	57522	57524	57524	Rowland	281	" He would have also , "
57528	57537	57524	57524	Rowland	281	" to be a fellow of remarkable ingenuity ! "
57758	57766	57767	57767	he	186	" Devilish pretty , through and through ! "
57776	57939	57767	57767	he	186	" Capital handling of the neck and throat ; lovely work on the nose . You 're a detestably lucky fellow , my boy ! But you ought not to have squandered such material on a simple bust ; you should have made a great imaginative figure . If I could only have got hold of her , I would have put her into a statue in spite of herself . What a pity she is not a ragged Trasteverine , whom we might have for a franc an hour ! I have been carrying about in my head for years a delicious design for a fantastic figure , but it has always stayed there for want of a tolerable model . I have seen intimations of the type , but Miss Light is the perfection of it . As soon as I saw her I said to myself , ' By Jove , there 's my statue in the flesh ! ' "
57940	57946	57948	57948	Roderick	186	" What is your subject ? "
57950	57957	57959	57959	Gloriani	213	" Do n't take it ill , "
57961	57980	57959	57959	Gloriani	213	" You know I ' m the very deuce for observation . She would make a magnificent Herodias ! "
58090	58099	58100	58100	Rowland	281	" Nay , do n't envy our friend , "
58132	58158	58122	58122	his	214	" You sail nearer the shore , but you sail in smoother waters . Be contented with what you are and paint me another picture . "
58159	58171	58172	58172	Singleton	214	" Oh , I do n't envy Hudson anything he possesses , "
58175	58284	58172	58172	Singleton	214	" because to take anything away would spoil his beautiful completeness . ' Complete , ' that 's what he is ; while we little clevernesses are like half - ripened plums , only good eating on the side that has had a glimpse of the sun . Nature has made him so , and fortune confesses to it ! He is the handsomest fellow in Rome , he has the most genius , and , as a matter of course , the most beautiful girl in the world comes and offers to be his model . If that is not completeness , where shall we find it ? "
58350	58364	58341	58341	He	492	" And is there any moral shut Within the bosom of the rose ? "
58365	58381	58382	58382	he	492	" In all Miss Blanchard 's roses you may be sure there is a moral , "
58386	58411	58382	58382	he	492	" You can see it sticking out its head , and , if you go to smell the flower , it scratches your nose . "
58624	58636	58637	58637	he	269	" You will find me eager to patronize our indigenous talent , "
58640	58750	58637	58637	he	269	" I am putting up a little shanty in my native town , and I propose to make a rather nice thing of it . It has been the will of Heaven to plunge me into mourning ; but art has consolations ! In a tasteful home , surrounded by the memorials of my wanderings , I hope to take more cheerful views . I ordered in Paris the complete appurtenances of a dining - room . Do you think you could do something for my library ? It is to be filled with well - selected authors , and I think a pure white image in this style , "
58798	58805	58849	58849	he	186	" asked Mr. Leavenworth , encouragingly , "
58813	58813	58793	58793	you	186	"
58814	58825	58827	58828	Miss Blanchard	216	" A most interesting subject for a truly serious mind , "
58840	58848	58849	58849	he	186	" The simplest thing I could do , "
58852	58884	58849	58849	he	186	" would be to make a full - length portrait of Miss Blanchard . I could give her a scroll in her hand , and that would do for the allegory . "
58937	58953	58954	58954	he	269	" If I were to be the happy possessor of a likeness of Miss Blanchard , "
58957	58969	58954	58954	he	269	" I should prefer to have it in no factitious disguise ! "
58994	59000	59001	59001	he	269	" Who is your friend ? "
59004	59027	59055	59056	Miss Blanchard	216	" A very worthy man . The architect of his own fortune - which is magnificent . One of nature 's gentlemen ! "
59079	59092	59093	59093	she	216	" She looks half like a Madonna and half like a ballerina , "
59125	59131	59132	59132	Roderick	186	" His conception be hanged ! "
59140	59181	59132	59132	Roderick	186	" His conception is sitting on a globe with a pen in her ear and a photographic album in her hand . I shall have to conceive , myself . For the money , I ought to be able to ! "
59195	59200	59201	59202	Madame Grandoni	217	" Heaven knows how ! "
59220	59369	59201	59202	Madame Grandoni	217	" In such a case there is nothing like audacity . A month ago she knew no one but her washerwoman , and now I am told that the cards of Roman princesses are to be seen on her table . She is evidently determined to play a great part , and she has the wit to perceive that , to make remunerative acquaintances , you must seem yourself to be worth knowing . You must have striking rooms and a confusing variety of dresses , and give good dinners , and so forth . She is spending a lot of money , and you 'll see that in two or three weeks she will take upon herself to open the season by giving a magnificent ball . Of course it is Christina 's beauty that floats her . People go to see her because they are curious . "
59370	59380	59382	59382	Rowland	281	" And they go again because they are charmed , "
59384	59394	59382	59382	Rowland	281	" Miss Christina is a very remarkable young lady . "
59395	59684	59201	59202	Madame Grandoni	217	" Oh , I know it well ; I had occasion to say so to myself the other day . She came to see me , of her own free will , and for an hour she was deeply interesting . I think she 's an actress , but she believes in her part while she is playing it . She took it into her head the other day to believe that she was very unhappy , and she sat there , where you are sitting , and told me a tale of her miseries which brought tears into my eyes . She cried , herself , profusely , and as naturally as possible . She said she was weary of life and that she knew no one but me she could speak frankly to . She must speak , or she would go mad . She sobbed as if her heart would break . I assure you it 's well for you susceptible young men that you do n't see her when she sobs . She said , in so many words , that her mother was an immoral woman . Heaven knows what she meant . She meant , I suppose , that she makes debts that she knows she ca n't pay . She said the life they led was horrible ; that it was monstrous a poor girl should be dragged about the world to be sold to the highest bidder . She was meant for better things ; she could be perfectly happy in poverty . It was not money she wanted . I might not believe her , but she really cared for serious things . Sometimes she thought of taking poison ! "
59685	59693	59382	59382	Rowland	281	" What did you say to that ? "
59694	59699	59701	59702	Madame Grandoni	217	" I recommended her , "
59704	59930	59701	59702	Madame Grandoni	217	" to come and see me instead . I would help her about as much , and I was , on the whole , less unpleasant . Of course I could help her only by letting her talk herself out and kissing her and patting her beautiful hands and telling her to be patient and she would be happy yet . About once in two months I expect her to reappear , on the same errand , and meanwhile to quite forget my existence . I believe I melted down to the point of telling her that I would find some good , quiet , affectionate husband for her ; but she declared , almost with fury , that she was sick unto death of husbands , and begged I would never again mention the word . And , in fact , it was a rash offer ; for I am sure that there is not a man of the kind that might really make a woman happy but would be afraid to marry mademoiselle . Looked at in that way she is certainly very much to be pitied , and indeed , altogether , though I do n't think she either means all she says or , by a great deal , says all that she means . I feel very sorry for her . "
60041	60055	60056	60056	observers	1461	" Where in the world has Miss Light been before she is twenty , "
60059	60068	60056	60056	observers	1461	" to have left all her illusions behind ? "
60104	60110	60102	60102	she	192	" not at all liked . "
60157	60159	60152	60152	he	186	" liked "
60429	60437	60438	60438	she	192	" Will you do me a favor ? "
60441	60445	60423	60423	she	192	" A thousand ! "
60446	60497	60509	60509	her	192	" Not now , but at your earliest convenience . Please remind Mr. Hudson that he is not in a New England village - that it is not the custom in Rome to address one 's conversation exclusively , night after night , to the same poor girl , and that "
60549	60557	60558	60558	he	186	" She 's a delightfully strange girl ! "
60561	60572	60558	60558	he	186	" She must do everything that comes into her head ! "
60573	60588	60538	60538	her	192	" Had she never asked you before not to talk to her so much ? "
60589	60666	60558	60558	he	186	" On the contrary , she has often said to me , ' Mind you now , I forbid you to leave me . Here comes that tiresome So - and - so . ' She cares as little about the custom as I do . What could be a better proof than her walking up to you , with five hundred people looking at her ? Is that the custom for young girls in Rome ? "
60667	60679	60538	60538	her	192	" Why , then , should she take such a step ? "
60680	60727	60558	60558	he	186	" Because , as she sat there , it came into her head . That 's reason enough for her . I have imagined she wishes me well , as they say here - though she has never distinguished me in such a way as that ! "
61144	61157	61158	61158	he	1487	" I am always on service with these ladies , you see , "
61161	61179	61158	61158	he	1487	" and that is a duty to which one would not willingly be faithless for an instant . "
61180	61183	61185	61185	Rowland	281	" Evidently , "
61187	61209	61185	61185	Rowland	281	" you are a very devoted friend . Mrs. Light , in her situation , is very happy in having you . "
61210	61216	61218	61219	the Cavaliere	1279	" We are old friends , "
61223	61270	61218	61219	the Cavaliere	1279	" Old friends . I knew the signora many years ago , when she was the prettiest woman in Rome - or rather in Ancona , which is even better . The beautiful Christina , now , is perhaps the most beautiful young girl in Europe ! "
61271	61275	61277	61277	Rowland	281	" Very likely , "
61279	61302	61309	61310	the Cavaliere	255	" Very well , sir , I taught her to read ; I guided her little hands to touch the piano keys . "
61334	61353	61320	61320	him	255	" And now - and now , sir , they treat me as you observed the other day ! "
61382	61399	61355	61356	the Cavaliere	1279	" Oh , I say nothing more . I am not so shallow as to complain ! "
61412	61419	61408	61408	Rowland	281	" You are a devoted friend . "
61420	61443	61470	61471	the Cavaliere	255	" That 's very true . I am a devoted friend . A man may do himself justice , after twenty years ! "
61465	61468	61470	61471	the Cavaliere	255	" Stupendous ! "
61475	61494	61470	61471	the Cavaliere	255	" It is a great day . We have four Roman princes , to say nothing of others . "
61510	61568	61496	61496	he	255	" And there she stands , the girl to whom I - I , Giuseppe Giacosa - taught her alphabet and her piano - scales ; there she stands in her incomparable beauty , and Roman princes come and bow to her . Here , in his corner , her old master permits himself to be proud . "
61569	61577	61579	61579	Rowland	281	" It is very friendly of him , "
61597	61622	61623	61623	he	255	" It is very natural , signore . The Christina is a good girl ; she remembers my little services . But here comes , "
61629	61648	61623	61623	he	255	" the young Prince of the Fine Arts . I am sure he has bowed lowest of all . "
61688	61694	61671	61671	He	186	" Have you seen her ? "
61695	61702	61704	61704	Rowland	281	" I have seen Miss Light , "
61706	61711	61704	61704	Rowland	281	" She 's magnificent . "
61712	61719	61721	61721	Roderick	186	" I ' m half crazy ! "
61750	61757	61758	61758	Rowland	281	" If you will go away , "
61762	61769	61758	61758	Rowland	281	" I will go with you . "
61770	61774	61776	61776	Roderick	186	" Go away ? "
61781	61789	61776	61776	Roderick	186	" I intend to dance with her ! "
61808	61817	61818	61818	he	1279	" Softly , softly , dear young man , "
61821	61831	61818	61818	he	1279	" Let me speak to you as a friend . "
61832	61847	61848	61848	Roderick	186	" Oh , speak even as an enemy and I shall not mind it , "
61853	61864	61848	61848	Roderick	186	" Be very reasonable , then , and go away . "
61865	61874	61848	61848	Roderick	186	" Why the deuce should I go away ? "
61875	61882	61884	61885	the Cavaliere	255	" Because you are in love , "
61887	61901	61848	61848	Roderick	186	" I might as well be in love here as in the streets . "
61902	61924	61848	61848	Roderick	186	" Carry your love as far as possible from Christina . She will not listen to you - she ca n't . "
61925	61932	61934	61934	Roderick	186	" She ' ca n't ' ? "
61936	61961	61934	61934	Roderick	186	" She is not a person of whom you may say that . She can if she will ; she does as she chooses . "
61962	62016	62044	62044	he	1279	" Up to a certain point . It would take too long to explain ; I only beg you to believe that if you continue to love Miss Light you will be very unhappy . Have you a princely title ? have you a princely fortune ? Otherwise you can never have her . "
62069	62081	62082	62082	he	186	" I ' m much obliged to you for the information , "
62085	62170	62082	62082	he	186	" Now that I have obtained it , let me tell you that I am no more in love with Miss Light than you are . Mr. Mallet knows that . I admire her - yes , profoundly . But that 's no one 's business but my own , and though I have , as you say , neither a princely title nor a princely fortune , I mean to suffer neither those advantages nor those who possess them to diminish my right . "
62171	62184	62186	62187	the Cavaliere	1279	" If you are not in love , my dear young man , "
62259	62259	62253	62253	Christina	192	"
62285	62296	62297	62297	he	186	" You speak as if she had made her choice ! "
62300	62317	62297	62297	he	186	" Without pretending to confidential information on the subject , I am sure she has not . "
62318	62328	62330	62331	the Cavaliere	255	" No , but she must make it soon , "
62346	62360	62338	62338	he	255	" She must choose a name and a fortune - and she will ! "
62361	62394	62338	62338	he	255	" She will do exactly as her inclination prompts ! She will marry the man who pleases her , if he has n't a dollar ! I know her better than you . "
62409	62503	62395	62396	The Cavaliere	255	" No , no , my dear young man , you do not know her better than I. You have not watched her , day by day , for twenty years . I too have admired her . She is a good girl ; she has never said an unkind word to me ; the blessed Virgin be thanked ! But she must have a brilliant destiny ; it has been marked out for her , and she will submit . You had better believe me ; it may save you much suffering . "
62504	62509	62511	62511	Roderick	186	" We shall see ! "
62518	62531	62532	62533	the Cavaliere	1279	" Certainly we shall see . But I retire from the discussion , "
62536	62560	62532	62533	the Cavaliere	1279	" I have no wish to provoke you to attempt to prove to me that I am wrong . You are already excited . "
62561	62585	62638	62639	The Cavaliere	1279	" No more than is natural to a man who in an hour or so is to dance the cotillon with Miss Light . "
62586	62594	62532	62533	the Cavaliere	1279	" The cotillon ? has she promised ? "
62604	62609	62595	62595	Roderick	186	" You 'll see ! "
62645	62653	62638	62639	The Cavaliere	1279	" You make a great many mourners ! "
62654	62661	62662	62662	Rowland	281	" He has made one already ! "
62900	62918	62919	62919	she	192	" Take me into the most out - of - the - way corner you can find , "
62923	62935	62919	62919	she	192	" and then go and get me a piece of bread . "
62936	62947	62919	62919	she	192	" Nothing more ? There seems to be everything conceivable . "
62948	62966	62919	62919	she	192	" A simple roll . Nothing more , on your peril . Only bring something for yourself . "
63061	63069	63071	63071	Christina	192	" Ah yes , I dislike you , "
63073	63122	63123	63123	she	192	" To tell the truth , I had forgotten it . There are so many people here whom I dislike more , that when I espied you just now , you seemed like an intimate friend . But I have not come into this corner to talk nonsense , "
63127	63138	63123	63123	she	192	" You must not think I always do , eh ? "
63139	63149	63151	63151	Rowland	281	" I have never heard you do anything else , "
63164	63402	63123	63123	she	192	" Very good . I like your frankness . It 's quite true . You see , I am a strange girl . To begin with , I am frightfully egotistical . Do n't flatter yourself you have said anything very clever if you ever take it into your head to tell me so . I know it much better than you . So it is , I ca n't help it . I am tired to death of myself ; I would give all I possess to get out of myself ; but somehow , at the end , I find myself so vastly more interesting than nine tenths of the people I meet . If a person wished to do me a favor I would say to him , ' I beg you , with tears in my eyes , to interest me . Be strong , be positive , be imperious , if you will ; only be something , - something that , in looking at , I can forget my detestable self ! ' Perhaps that is nonsense too . If it is , I ca n't help it . I can only apologize for the nonsense I know to be such and that I talk - oh , for more reasons than I can tell you ! I wonder whether , if I were to try , you would understand me . "
63403	63412	63414	63414	Rowland	281	" I am afraid I should never understand , "
63416	63425	63414	63414	Rowland	281	" why a person should willingly talk nonsense . "
63426	63487	63123	63123	she	192	" That proves how little you know about women . But I like your frankness . When I told you the other day that you displeased me , I had an idea you were more formal , - how do you say it ? - more guinde . I am very capricious . To - night I like you better . "
63488	63496	63498	63498	Rowland	281	" Oh , I am not guinde , "
63502	63551	63123	63123	she	192	" I beg your pardon , then , for thinking so . Now I have an idea that you would make a useful friend - an intimate friend - a friend to whom one could tell everything . For such a friend , what would n't I give ! "
63591	63604	63605	63605	he	1518	" I hesitate to recommend myself out and out for the office , "
63608	63635	63605	63605	he	1518	" but I believe that if you were to depend upon me for anything that a friend may do , I should not be found wanting . "
63636	63678	63123	63123	she	192	" Very good . One of the first things one asks of a friend is to judge one not by isolated acts , but by one 's whole conduct . I care for your opinion - I do n't know why . "
63679	63687	63689	63689	Rowland	281	" Nor do I , I confess , "
63694	63703	63704	63704	she	1517	" What do you think of this affair ? "
63712	63726	63123	63123	she	192	" Of your ball ? Why , it 's a very grand affair . "
63727	63837	63838	63838	she	1519	" It 's horrible - that 's what it is ! It 's a mere rabble ! There are people here whom I never saw before , people who were never asked . Mamma went about inviting every one , asking other people to invite any one they knew , doing anything to have a crowd . I hope she is satisfied ! It is not my doing . I feel weary , I feel angry , I feel like crying . I have twenty minds to escape into my room and lock the door and let mamma go through with it as she can . By the way , "
63852	63861	63838	63838	she	1519	" can you tell me something to read ? "
63872	63880	63881	63881	she	1519	" Can you recommend me some books ? "
63884	63948	63881	63881	she	1519	" I know you are a great reader . I have no one else to ask . We can buy no books . We can make debts for jewelry and bonnets and five - button gloves , but we ca n't spend a sou for ideas . And yet , though you may not believe it , I like ideas quite as well . "
63949	63961	63962	63962	Rowland	281	" I shall be most happy to lend you some books , "
63965	63980	63962	63962	Rowland	281	" I will pick some out to - morrow and send them to you . "
63981	64027	63881	63881	she	1519	" No novels , please ! I am tired of novels . I can imagine better stories for myself than any I read . Some good poetry , if there is such a thing nowadays , and some memoirs and histories and books of facts . "
64028	64041	63962	63962	Rowland	281	" You shall be served . Your taste agrees with my own . "
64055	64063	64064	64064	she	281	" Tell me something about Mr. Hudson , "
64067	64073	64064	64064	she	281	" You are great friends ! "
64074	64078	64080	64080	Rowland	281	" Oh yes , "
64082	64088	64080	64080	Rowland	281	" we are great friends . "
64089	64099	64064	64064	she	281	" Tell me about him . Come , begin ! "
64100	64112	64080	64080	Rowland	281	" Where shall I begin ? You know him for yourself . "
64113	64166	64064	64064	she	281	" No , I do n't know him ; I do n't find him so easy to know . Since he has finished my bust and begun to come here disinterestedly , he has become a great talker . He says very fine things ; but does he mean all he says ? "
64167	64174	64080	64080	Rowland	281	" Few of us do that . "
64175	64195	64196	64196	Rowland	281	" You do , I imagine . You ought to know , for he tells me you discovered him . "
64204	64212	64201	64201	Christina	192	" Do you consider him very clever ? "
64213	64216	64201	64201	Christina	192	" Unquestionably . "
64217	64229	64201	64201	Christina	192	" His talent is really something out of the common way ? "
64230	64237	64201	64201	Christina	192	" So it seems to me . "
64238	64249	64201	64201	Christina	192	" In short , he 's a man of genius ? "
64250	64257	64201	64201	Christina	192	" Yes , call it genius . "
64258	64283	64201	64201	Christina	192	" And you found him vegetating in a little village and took him by the hand and set him on his feet in Rome ? "
64284	64291	64293	64293	Rowland	281	" Is that the popular legend ? "
64295	64408	64201	64201	Christina	192	" Oh , you need n't be modest . There was no great merit in it ; there would have been none at least on my part in the same circumstances . Real geniuses are not so common , and if I had discovered one in the wilderness , I would have brought him out into the market - place to see how he would behave . It would be excessively amusing . You must find it so to watch Mr. Hudson , eh ? Tell me this : do you think he is going to be a great man - become famous , have his life written , and all that ? "
64409	64421	64201	64201	Christina	192	" I do n't prophesy , but I have good hopes . "
64490	64499	64500	64500	she	192	" So he 's a man of genius , "
64504	64696	64500	64500	she	192	" Do n't you think I ought to be extremely flattered to have a man of genius perpetually hanging about ? He is the first I ever saw , but I should have known he was not a common mortal . There is something strange about him . To begin with , he has no manners . You may say that it 's not for me to blame him , for I have none myself . That 's very true , but the difference is that I can have them when I wish to and very charming ones too ; I 'll show you some day ; whereas Mr. Hudson will never have them . And yet , somehow , one sees he 's a gentleman . He seems to have something urging , driving , pushing him , making him restless and defiant . You see it in his eyes . They are the finest , by the way , I ever saw . When a person has such eyes as that you can forgive him his bad manners . I suppose that is what they call the sacred fire . "
64725	64741	64718	64718	her	281	" Tell me how you found him . Where was he - how was he ? "
64742	64768	64718	64718	her	281	" He was in a place called Northampton . Did you ever hear of it ? He was studying law - but not learning it . "
64769	64779	64718	64718	her	281	" It appears it was something horrible , eh ? "
64780	64784	64718	64718	her	281	" Something horrible ? "
64785	64802	64718	64718	her	281	" This little village . No society , no pleasures , no beauty , no life . "
64803	64826	64718	64718	her	281	" You have received a false impression . Northampton is not as gay as Rome , but Roderick had some charming friends . "
64827	64837	64718	64718	her	281	" Tell me about them . Who were they ? "
64838	64857	64718	64718	her	281	" Well , there was my cousin , through whom I made his acquaintance : a delightful woman . "
64858	64863	64718	64718	her	281	" Young - pretty ? "
64864	64877	64718	64718	her	281	" Yes , a good deal of both . And very clever . "
64878	64886	64718	64718	her	281	" Did he make love to her ? "
64887	64893	64718	64718	her	281	" Not in the least . "
64894	64900	64718	64718	her	281	" Well , who else ? "
64901	64915	64718	64718	her	281	" He lived with his mother . She is the best of women . "
64916	64941	64718	64718	her	281	" Ah yes , I know all that one 's mother is . But she does not count as society . And who else ? "
65055	65062	65063	65063	Christina	192	" What are you frowning at ? "
65066	65072	65073	65073	he	1522	" There was another person , "
65076	65092	65073	65073	he	1522	" the most important of all : the young girl to whom he is engaged . "
65102	65110	65111	65111	she	192	" Ah , Mr. Hudson is engaged ? "
65117	65122	65111	65111	she	192	" Is she pretty ? "
65123	65131	65133	65133	Rowland	281	" She is not called a beauty , "
65149	65162	65146	65146	he	1522	" I have seen beauties , however , who pleased me less . "
65163	65178	65133	65133	Rowland	281	" Ah , she pleases you , too ? Why do n't they marry ? "
65179	65190	65146	65146	he	1522	" Roderick is waiting till he can afford to marry . "
65207	65214	65215	65215	she	192	" Ah , he 's engaged ? "
65222	65228	65215	65215	she	192	" He never told me . "
65268	65281	65282	65282	he	186	" I do n't claim that you have promised me the cotillon , "
65285	65306	65282	65282	he	186	" but I consider that you have given me hopes which warrant the confidence that you will dance with me . "
65314	65322	65323	65323	she	192	" Certainly I have made no promises , "
65326	65352	65323	65323	she	192	" It seemed to me that , as the daughter of the house , I should keep myself free and let it depend on circumstances . "
65353	65362	65364	65364	Roderick	186	" I beseech you to dance with me ! "
65376	65390	65369	65369	Christina	192	" You say that very well , but the Italians do it better . "
65427	65432	65433	65433	she	253	" My precious love , "
65436	65466	65433	65433	she	253	" what a place to hide in ! We have been looking for you for twenty minutes ; I have chosen a cavalier for you , and chosen well ! "
65490	65507	65467	65469	The young man	347	" May I venture to hope , dear signorina , for the honor of your hand ? "
65508	65514	65516	65517	Mrs. Light	253	" Of course you may ! "
65519	65526	65516	65517	Mrs. Light	253	" The honor is for us . "
65548	65565	65527	65527	Christina	192	" You are very kind , but you are too late . I have just accepted ! "
65566	65573	65579	65580	Mrs. Light	253	" Ah , my own darling ! "
65712	65715	65717	65718	the Cavaliere	1279	" Oh , "
65720	65733	65717	65718	the Cavaliere	1279	" he 's a pezzo grosso ! A Neapolitan . Prince Casamassima . "
65792	65817	65783	65783	Roderick	186	" I am gone to Frascati - for meditation . If I am not at home on Friday , you had better join me . "
65871	65873	65864	65864	He	186	" meditation "
65930	65941	65942	65942	he	186	" I do n't know whether you 'll thank me , "
65946	65966	65942	65942	he	186	" but it 's my duty to let you know it . Miss Light perhaps has already done so . "
65982	65990	65991	65991	he	186	" Why should n't I thank you ? "
65994	66003	65991	65991	he	186	" I am not ashamed of my engagement . "
66004	66027	66051	66051	his	186	" As you had not spoken of it yourself , I thought you might have a reason for not having it known . "
66028	66041	66042	66042	Roderick	186	" A man does n't gossip about such a matter with strangers , "
66054	66060	66062	66062	Rowland	281	" With strangers - no ! "
66082	66101	66068	66068	his	186	" If you supposed I had a reason for being silent , pray why should you have spoken ? "
66102	66147	66051	66051	his	186	" I did not speak idly , my dear Roderick . I weighed the matter before I spoke , and promised myself to let you know immediately afterwards . It seemed to me that Miss Light had better know that your affections are pledged . "
66148	66168	66068	66068	his	186	" The Cavaliere has put it into your head , then , that I am making love to her ? "
66169	66184	66051	66051	his	186	" No ; in that case I would not have spoken to her first . "
66185	66200	66068	66068	his	186	" Do you mean , then , that she is making love to me ? "
66201	66208	66210	66210	Rowland	281	" This is what I mean , "
66216	66270	66210	66210	Rowland	281	" That girl finds you interesting , and is pleased , even though she may play indifference , at your finding her so . I said to myself that it might save her some sentimental disappointment to know without delay that you are not at liberty to become indefinitely interested in other women . "
66271	66286	66288	66288	Roderick	186	" You seem to have taken the measure of my liberty with extraordinary minuteness ! "
66290	66329	66330	66330	Rowland	281	" You must do me justice . I am the cause of your separation from Miss Garland , the cause of your being exposed to temptations which she hardly even suspects . How could I ever face her , "
66339	66352	66330	66330	Rowland	281	" if at the end of it all she should be unhappy ? "
66353	66388	66210	66210	Rowland	281	" I had no idea that Miss Garland had made such an impression on you . You are too zealous ; I take it she did n't charge you to look after her interests . "
66389	66405	66330	66330	Rowland	281	" If anything happens to you , I am accountable . You must understand that . "
66406	66538	66210	66210	Rowland	281	" That 's a view of the situation I ca n't accept ; in your own interest , no less than in mine . It can only make us both very uncomfortable . I know all I owe you ; I feel it ; you know that ! But I am not a small boy nor an outer barbarian any longer , and , whatever I do , I do with my eyes open . When I do well , the merit 's mine ; if I do ill , the fault 's mine ! The idea that I make you nervous is detestable . Dedicate your nerves to some better cause , and believe that if Miss Garland and I have a quarrel , we shall settle it between ourselves . "
66664	66672	66673	66673	he	186	" Here is an uncommonly fine thing , "
66678	66708	66673	66673	he	186	" a nature unconsciously grateful , a man in whom friendship does the thing that love alone generally has the credit of - knocks the bottom out of pride ! "
66779	66794	66795	66795	he	1543	" I do n't at all like your telling me I am too zealous , "
66798	66816	66795	66795	he	1543	" If I had not been zealous , I should never have cared a fig for you . "
66834	66850	66817	66817	Roderick	186	" Say it outright ! You have been a great fool to believe in me . "
66851	66870	66872	66872	Rowland	281	" I desire to say nothing of the kind , and you do n't honestly believe I do ! "
66874	66893	66872	66872	Rowland	281	" It seems to me I am really very good - natured even to reply to such nonsense . "
67212	67226	67227	67227	he	186	" When you err , you say , the fault 's your own , "
67232	67247	67227	67227	he	186	" It is because your faults are your own that I care about them . "
67288	67298	67299	67299	he	186	" You are the best man in the world , "
67302	67312	67313	67313	he	186	" and I am a vile brute . Only , "
67319	67326	67313	67313	he	186	" you do n't understand me ! "
67378	67386	67374	67374	Rowland	281	" What is it now ? Explain . "
67387	67395	67397	67397	Roderick	186	" Oh , I ca n't explain ! "
67405	67421	67397	67397	Roderick	186	" I have only one way of expressing my deepest feelings - it 's this ! "
67448	67459	67428	67428	He	186	" And even this half the time plays me false ! "
67501	67512	67513	67513	he	186	" We must do what we can and be thankful , "
67516	67538	67513	67513	he	186	" And let me assure you of this - that it wo n't help you to become entangled with Miss Light . "
67573	67600	67541	67541	his	186	" No , no , it 's no use ; you do n't understand me ! But I do n't blame you . You ca n't ! "
67601	67611	67613	67613	Rowland	281	" You think it will help you , then ? "
67617	67895	67541	67541	his	186	" I think that when you expect a man to produce beautiful and wonderful works of art , you ought to allow him a certain freedom of action , you ought to give him a long rope , you ought to let him follow his fancy and look for his material wherever he thinks he may find it ! A mother ca n't nurse her child unless she follows a certain diet ; an artist ca n't bring his visions to maturity unless he has a certain experience . You demand of us to be imaginative , and you deny us that which feeds the imagination . In labor we must be as passionate as the inspired sibyl ; in life we must be mere machines . It wo n't do . When you have got an artist to deal with , you must take him as he is , good and bad together . I do n't say they are pleasant fellows to know or easy fellows to live with ; I do n't say they satisfy themselves any better than other people . I only say that if you want them to produce , you must let them conceive . If you want a bird to sing , you must not cover up its cage . Shoot them , the poor devils , drown them , exterminate them , if you will , in the interest of public morality ; it may be morality would gain - I dare say it would ! But if you suffer them to live , let them live on their own terms and according to their own inexorable needs ! "
67901	67916	67917	67917	he	1562	" I have no wish whatever either to shoot you or to drown you ! "
67920	68020	67917	67917	he	1562	" Why launch such a tirade against a warning offered you altogether in the interest of your freest development ? Do you really mean that you have an inexorable need of embarking on a flirtation with Miss Light ? - a flirtation as to the felicity of which there may be differences of opinion , but which can not at best , under the circumstances , be called innocent . Your last summer 's adventures were more so ! As for the terms on which you are to live , I had an idea you had arranged them otherwise ! "
68021	68087	68169	68169	he	1563	" I have arranged nothing - thank God ! I do n't pretend to arrange . I am young and ardent and inquisitive , and I admire Miss Light . That 's enough . I shall go as far as admiration leads me . I am not afraid . Your genuine artist may be sometimes half a madman , but he 's not a coward ! "
68088	68106	67917	67917	he	1562	" Suppose that in your speculation you should come to grief , not only sentimentally but artistically ? "
68107	68166	68169	68169	he	1563	" Come what come will ! If I ' m to fizzle out , the sooner I know it the better . Sometimes I half suspect it . But let me at least go out and reconnoitre for the enemy , and not sit here waiting for him , cudgeling my brains for ideas that wo n't come ! "
68246	68254	68256	68256	Roderick	186	" I ca n't work any more , "
68258	68273	68256	68256	Roderick	186	" You have upset me ! I 'll go and stroll on the Pincian . "
68330	68345	68346	68346	he	186	" You did , from your own point of view , an indiscreet thing , "
68349	68358	68346	68346	he	186	" to tell Miss Light of my engagement . "
68380	68389	68390	68390	Roderick	186	" If she 's the coquette you say , "
68393	68403	68390	68390	Roderick	186	" you have given her a reason the more . "
68404	68417	68419	68419	Rowland	281	" And that 's the girl you propose to devote yourself to ? "
68421	68463	68419	68419	Rowland	281	" Oh , I do n't say it , mind ! I only say that she 's the most interesting creature in the world ! The next time you mean to render me a service , pray give me notice beforehand ! "
68823	68833	68834	68834	he	186	" It is worse out here than in Rome , "
68837	68876	68834	68834	he	186	" for here I am face to face with the dead blank of my mind ! There I could n't think of anything either , but there I found things to make me forget that I needed to . "
69218	69232	69233	69233	he	186	" A sculptor should model as Dante writes - you 're right there , "
69236	69258	69259	69259	he	186	" But when his genius is in eclipse , Dante is a dreadfully smoky lamp . By what perversity of fate , "
69263	69317	69259	69259	he	186	" has it come about that I am a sculptor at all ? A sculptor is such a confoundedly special genius ; there are so few subjects he can treat , so few things in life that bear upon his work , so few moods in which he himself is inclined to it . "
69338	69666	69326	69326	him	186	" If I had only been a painter - a little quiet , docile , matter - of - fact painter , like our friend Singleton - I should only have to open my Ariosto here to find a subject , to find color and attitudes , stuffs and composition ; I should only have to look up from the page at that mouldy old fountain against the blue sky , at that cypress alley wandering away like a procession of priests in couples , at the crags and hollows of the Sabine hills , to find myself grasping my brush . Best of all would be to be Ariosto himself , or one of his brotherhood . Then everything in nature would give you a hint , and every form of beauty be part of your stock . You would n't have to look at things only to say , - with tears of rage half the time , - ' Oh , yes , it 's wonderfully pretty , but what the deuce can I do with it ? ' But a sculptor , now ! That 's a pretty trade for a fellow who has got his living to make and yet is so damnably constituted that he ca n't work to order , and considers that , aesthetically , clock ornaments do n't pay ! You ca n't model the serge - coated cypresses , nor those mouldering old Tritons and all the sunny sadness of that dried - up fountain ; you ca n't put the light into marble - the lovely , caressing , consenting Italian light that you get so much of for nothing . Say that a dozen times in his life a man has a complete sculpturesque vision - a vision in which the imagination recognizes a subject and the subject kindles the imagination . It is a remunerative rate of work , and the intervals are comfortable ! "
69716	69725	69726	69726	he	186	" What if the watch should run down , "
69729	69951	69952	69952	he	1589	" and you should lose the key ? What if you should wake up some morning and find it stopped , inexorably , appallingly stopped ? Such things have been , and the poor devils to whom they happened have had to grin and bear it . The whole matter of genius is a mystery . It bloweth where it listeth and we know nothing of its mechanism . If it gets out of order we ca n't mend it ; if it breaks down altogether we ca n't set it going again . We must let it choose its own pace , and hold our breath lest it should lose its balance . It 's dealt out in different doses , in big cups and little , and when you have consumed your portion it 's as naif to ask for more as it was for Oliver Twist to ask for more porridge . Lucky for you if you ' ve got one of the big cups ; we drink them down in the dark , and we ca n't tell their size until we tip them up and hear the last gurgle . Those of some men last for life ; those of others for a couple of years . Nay , what are you smiling at so damnably ? "
69956	70246	70248	70248	he	1590	" Nothing is more common than for an artist who has set out on his journey on a high - stepping horse to find himself all of a sudden dismounted and invited to go his way on foot . You can number them by the thousand - the people of two or three successes ; the poor fellows whose candle burnt out in a night . Some of them groped their way along without it , some of them gave themselves up for blind and sat down by the wayside to beg . Who shall say that I ' m not one of these ? Who shall assure me that my credit is for an unlimited sum ? Nothing proves it , and I never claimed it ; or if I did , I did so in the mere boyish joy of shaking off the dust of Northampton . If you believed so , my dear fellow , you did so at your own risk ! What am I , what are the best of us , but an experiment ? Do I succeed - do I fail ? It does n't depend on me . I ' m prepared for failure . It wo n't be a disappointment , simply because I sha n't survive it . The end of my work shall be the end of my life . When I have played my last card , I shall cease to care for the game . I ' m not making vulgar threats of suicide ; for destiny , I trust , wo n't add insult to injury by putting me to that abominable trouble . But I have a conviction that if the hour strikes here , "
70253	70312	70248	70248	he	1590	" I shall disappear , dissolve , be carried off in a cloud ! For the past ten days I have had the vision of some such fate perpetually swimming before my eyes . My mind is like a dead calm in the tropics , and my imagination as motionless as the phantom ship in the Ancient Mariner ! "
70595	70602	70603	70603	he	1590	" Do n't heed your mood , "
70606	70654	70603	70603	he	1590	" and do n't believe there is any calm so dead that your own lungs ca n't ruffle it with a breeze . If you have work to do , do n't wait to feel like it ; set to work and you will feel like it . "
70655	70663	70665	70665	Roderick	186	" Set to work and produce abortions ! "
70669	70739	70740	70740	he	1590	" Preach that to others . Production with me must be either pleasure or nothing . As I said just now , I must either stay in the saddle or not go at all . I wo n't do second - rate work ; I ca n't if I would . I have no cleverness , apart from inspiration . I am not a Gloriani ! You are right , "
70746	70777	70740	70740	he	1590	" this is unprofitable talk , and it makes my head ache . I shall take a nap and see if I can dream of a bright idea or two . "
71000	71005	71006	71006	she	254	" What delicious oblivion ! "
71009	71014	71017	71017	she	254	" Happy man ! Stenterello "
71023	71028	71017	71017	she	254	" wake him up ! "
71044	71047	71049	71049	Rowland	281	" Why , "
71051	71057	71049	71049	Rowland	281	" if he is happy ? "
71058	71077	71078	71078	Roderick	186	" Oh , I want companions in misery ! Besides , I want to show off my dog . "
71120	71136	71137	71137	Christina	192	" I should have liked to lie down on the grass and go to sleep , "
71140	71149	71137	71137	Christina	192	" But it would have been unheard of . "
71150	71156	71158	71159	the Prince	3484	" Oh , not quite , "
71171	71182	71158	71159	the Prince	3484	" There was already a Sleeping Beauty in the Wood ! "
71183	71186	71188	71189	Mrs. Light	253	" Charming ! "
71191	71200	71188	71189	Mrs. Light	253	" Do you hear that , my dear ? "
71201	71219	71221	71223	the young girl	659	" When the prince says a brilliant thing , it would be a pity to lose it , "
71225	71231	71221	71223	the young girl	659	" Your servant , sir ! "
71316	71329	71331	71331	Rowland	281	" Oh , I beg your pardon ; I was not sleeping , "
71333	71349	71351	71351	Christina	192	" Do n't you know that Mr. Mallet is Mr. Hudson 's sheep - dog ? "
71353	71364	71351	71351	Christina	192	" He was mounting guard to keep away the wolves . "
71365	71372	71374	71374	Rowland	281	" To indifferent purpose , madame ! "
71381	71391	71392	71392	Christina	192	" Is that the way you spend your time ? "
71397	71425	71395	71395	Roderick	186	" I never yet happened to learn what men were doing when they supposed women were not watching them but it was something vastly below their reputation . "
71426	71431	71433	71433	Roderick	186	" When , pray , "
71440	71447	71433	71433	Roderick	186	" are women not watching them ? "
71448	71495	71496	71496	Roderick	186	" We shall give you something better to do , at any rate . How long have you been here ? It 's an age since I have seen you . We consider you domiciled here , and expect you to play host and entertain us . "
71559	71564	71565	71565	he	3484	" This is nothing , "
71570	71585	71565	71565	he	3484	" My word of honor . Have you seen the terrace at San Gaetano ? "
71586	71592	71594	71595	Mrs. Light	253	" Ah , that terrace , "
71599	71606	71594	71595	Mrs. Light	253	" I suppose it is magnificent ! "
71607	71650	71565	71565	he	3484	" It is four hundred feet long , and paved with marble . And the view is a thousand times more beautiful than this . You see , far away , the blue , blue sea and the little smoke of Vesuvio ! "
71651	71656	71658	71659	Mrs. Light	253	" Christina , love , "
71662	71678	71658	71659	Mrs. Light	253	" the prince has a terrace four hundred feet long , all paved with marble ! "
71694	71697	71699	71699	Christina	192	" Stupendous ! "
71701	71720	71699	71699	Christina	192	" To go from one end to the other , the prince must have out his golden carriage . "
71739	71746	71748	71749	the prince	3484	" You always laugh at me , "
71751	71760	71748	71749	the prince	3484	" I know no more what to say ! "
71774	71825	71761	71761	She	192	" No , no , dear prince , I do n't laugh at you . Heaven forbid ! You are much too serious an affair . I assure you I feel your importance . What did you inform us was the value of the hereditary diamonds of the Princess Casamassima ? "
71826	71836	71838	71841	the poor young man	1619	" Ah , you are laughing at me yet ! "
71848	71854	71855	71855	Christina	192	" It does n't matter , "
71859	71878	71855	71855	Christina	192	" We have a note of it ; mamma writes all those things down in a little book ! "
71879	71896	71898	71899	Mrs. Light	253	" If you are laughed at , dear prince , at least it 's in company , "
71958	71964	71965	71965	Christina	192	" Is the villa inhabited ? "
71980	71984	71986	71986	Roderick	186	" Not privately , "
71988	72002	71986	71986	Roderick	186	" It is occupied by a Jesuits ' college , for little boys . "
72003	72009	72018	72018	Roderick	186	" Can women go in ? "
72010	72016	71986	71986	Roderick	186	" I am afraid not . "
72023	72042	72018	72018	Roderick	186	" Fancy the poor little devils looking up from their Latin declensions and seeing Miss Light standing there ! "
72043	72175	72018	72018	Roderick	186	" I should like to see the poor little devils , with their rosy cheeks and their long black gowns , and when they were pretty , I should n't scruple to kiss them . But if I ca n't have that amusement I must have some other . We must not stand planted on this enchanting terrace as if we were stakes driven into the earth . We must dance , we must feast , we must do something picturesque . Mamma has arranged , I believe , that we are to go back to Frascati to lunch at the inn . I decree that we lunch here and send the Cavaliere to the inn to get the provisions ! He can take the carriage , which is waiting below . "
72267	72274	72275	72275	she	254	" Bring the best they have , "
72278	72422	72275	72275	she	254	" no matter if it ruins us ! And if the best is very bad , it will be all the more amusing . I shall enjoy seeing Mr. Mallet try to swallow it for propriety 's sake ! Mr. Hudson will say out like a man that it 's horrible stuff , and that he 'll be choked first ! Be sure you bring a dish of maccaroni ; the prince must have the diet of the Neapolitan nobility . But I leave all that to you , my poor , dear Cavaliere ; you know what 's good ! Only be sure , above all , you bring a guitar . Mr. Mallet will play us a tune , I 'll dance with Mr. Hudson , and mamma will pair off with the prince , of whom she is so fond ! "
72458	72470	72447	72447	his	1630	" Did n't I tell you she was a good girl ! "
72957	72968	72970	72970	Rowland	281	" If history could always be taught in this fashion ! "
72972	72996	72970	72970	Rowland	281	" It 's the ideal - strolling up and down on the very spot commemorated , hearing sympathetic anecdotes from deeply indigenous lips . "
73203	73220	73221	73221	he	3484	" Why in the world does he not go after her and insist on being noticed ! "
73224	73232	73234	73235	the Cavaliere	1279	" Oh , he 's very proud ! "
73237	73262	73234	73235	the Cavaliere	1279	" That 's all very well , but a gentleman who cultivates a passion for that young lady must be prepared to make sacrifices . "
73263	73316	73346	73346	he	1279	" He thinks he has already made a great many . He comes of a very great family - a race of princes who for six hundred years have married none but the daughters of princes . But he is seriously in love , and he would marry her to - morrow . "
73317	73325	73234	73235	the Cavaliere	1279	" And she will not have him ? "
73326	73336	73346	73346	he	1279	" Ah , she is very proud , too ! "
73372	73444	73368	73368	he	1279	" It would be a great match , for she brings him neither a name nor a fortune - nothing but her beauty . But the signorina will receive no favors ; I know her well ! She would rather have her beauty blasted than seem to care about the marriage , and if she ever accepts the prince it will be only after he has implored her on his knees ! "
73445	73453	73455	73455	Rowland	281	" But she does care about it , "
73457	73493	73455	73455	Rowland	281	" and to bring him to his knees she is working upon his jealousy by pretending to be interested in my friend Hudson . If you said more , you would say that , eh ? "
73505	73577	73578	73578	he	255	" By no means . Miss Light is a singular girl ; she has many romantic ideas . She would be quite capable of interesting herself seriously in an interesting young man , like your friend , and doing her utmost to discourage a splendid suitor , like the prince . She would act sincerely and she would go very far . But it would be unfortunate for the young man , "
73585	73594	73578	73578	he	255	" for at the last she would retreat ! "
73595	73602	73494	73495	The Cavaliere	255	" A singular girl , indeed ! "
73603	73618	73578	73578	he	255	" She would accept the more brilliant parti . I can answer for it . "
73619	73627	73494	73495	The Cavaliere	255	" And what would be her motive ? "
73628	73646	73578	73578	he	255	" She would be forced . There would be circumstances .... I ca n't tell you more . "
73647	73667	73494	73495	The Cavaliere	255	" But this implies that the rejected suitor would also come back . He might grow tired of waiting . "
73668	73681	73682	73682	Rowland	281	" Oh , this one is good ! Look at him now . "
73724	73732	73734	73735	the Cavaliere	1279	" In this country , you know , "
73737	73758	73734	73735	the Cavaliere	1279	" a young lady never goes walking alone with a handsome young man . It seems to him very strange . "
73759	73780	73494	73495	The Cavaliere	255	" It must seem to him monstrous , and if he overlooks it he must be very much in love . "
73781	73794	73734	73735	the Cavaliere	1279	" Oh , he will overlook it . He is far gone . "
73795	73808	73494	73495	The Cavaliere	255	" Who is this exemplary lover , then ; what is he ? "
73809	74145	73734	73735	the Cavaliere	1279	" A Neapolitan ; one of the oldest houses in Italy . He is a prince in your English sense of the word , for he has a princely fortune . He is very young ; he is only just of age ; he saw the signorina last winter in Naples . He fell in love with her from the first , but his family interfered , and an old uncle , an ecclesiastic , Monsignor B - - , hurried up to Naples , seized him , and locked him up . Meantime he has passed his majority , and he can dispose of himself . His relations are moving heaven and earth to prevent his marrying Miss Light , and they have sent us word that he forfeits his property if he takes his wife out of a certain line . I have investigated the question minutely , and I find this is but a fiction to frighten us . He is perfectly free ; but the estates are such that it is no wonder they wish to keep them in their own hands . For Italy , it is an extraordinary case of unincumbered property . The prince has been an orphan from his third year ; he has therefore had a long minority and made no inroads upon his fortune . Besides , he is very prudent and orderly ; I am only afraid that some day he will pull the purse - strings too tight . All these years his affairs have been in the hands of Monsignor B - - , who has managed them to perfection - paid off mortagages , planted forests , opened up mines . It is now a magnificent fortune ; such a fortune as , with his name , would justify the young man in pretending to any alliance whatsoever . And he lays it all at the feet of that young girl who is wandering in yonder boschetto with a penniless artist . "
74146	74165	73494	73495	The Cavaliere	255	" He is certainly a phoenix of princes ! The signora must be in a state of bliss . "
74172	74183	74166	74167	The Cavaliere	1279	" The signora has a high esteem for his character . "
74184	74192	74194	74194	Rowland	281	" His character , by the way , "
74200	74209	74194	74194	Rowland	281	" what sort of a character is it ? "
74210	74368	74166	74167	The Cavaliere	1279	" Eh , Prince Casamassima is a veritable prince ! He is a very good young man . He is not brilliant , nor witty , but he 'll not let himself be made a fool of . He 's very grave and very devout - though he does propose to marry a Protestant . He will handle that point after marriage . He 's as you see him there : a young man without many ideas , but with a very firm grasp of a single one - the conviction that Prince Casamassima is a very great person , that he greatly honors any young lady by asking for her hand , and that things are going very strangely when the young lady turns her back upon him . The poor young man , I am sure , is profoundly perplexed . But I whisper to him every day , ' Pazienza , Signor Principe ! ' "
74369	74375	74377	74377	Rowland	281	" So you firmly believe , "
74382	74397	74377	74377	Rowland	281	" that Miss Light will accept him just in time not to lose him ! "
74398	74416	74166	74167	The Cavaliere	1279	" I count upon it . She would make too perfect a princess to miss her destiny . "
74417	74448	74377	74377	Rowland	281	" And you hold that nevertheless , in the mean while , in listening to , say , my friend Hudson , she will have been acting in good faith ? "
74463	74475	74452	74452	his	1279	" Eh , dear signore , the Christina is very romantic ! "
74476	74506	74166	74167	The Cavaliere	1279	" So much so , you intimate , that she will eventually retract , in consequence not of a change of sentiment , but of a mysterious outward pressure ? "
74507	74541	74452	74452	his	1279	" If everything else fails , there is that resource . But it is mysterious , as you say , and you need n't try to guess it . You will never know . "
74542	74552	74166	74167	The Cavaliere	1279	" The poor signorina , then , will suffer ! "
74553	74561	74452	74452	his	1279	" Not too much , I hope . "
74562	74590	74166	74167	The Cavaliere	1279	" And the poor young man ! You maintain that there is nothing but disappointment in store for the infatuated youth who loses his heart to her ! "
74595	74600	74601	74601	he	1279	" He had better , "
74607	74625	74601	74601	he	1279	" go and pursue his studies in Florence . There are very fine antiques in the Uffizi ! "
74642	74647	74648	74648	she	253	" That 's right , "
74703	74703	74698	74701	that unhappy young man	1678	"
74704	74707	74709	74709	Rowland	281	" Yes , "
74711	74716	74709	74709	Rowland	281	" he seems unhappy . "
74717	74753	74698	74701	that unhappy young man	1678	" He is just come of age , he bears one of the greatest names in Italy and owns one of the greatest properties , and he is pining away with love for my daughter . "
74754	74761	74709	74709	Rowland	281	" So the Cavaliere tells me . "
74762	74769	74771	74772	Mrs. Light	253	" The Cavaliere should n't gossip , "
74775	74813	74771	74772	Mrs. Light	253	" Such information should come from me . The prince is pining , as I say ; he 's consumed , he 's devoured . It 's a real Italian passion ; I know what that means ! "
74832	74859	74815	74816	the lady	845	" Meanwhile , if you please , my daughter is hiding in the woods with your dear friend Mr. Hudson . I could cry with rage . "
74860	74869	74871	74871	Rowland	281	" If things are so bad as that , "
74873	74897	74871	74871	Rowland	281	" it seems to me that you ought to find nothing easier than to dispatch the Cavaliere to bring the guilty couple back . "
74898	75000	74815	74816	the lady	845	" Never in the world ! My hands are tied . Do you know what Christina would do ? She would tell the Cavaliere to go about his business - Heaven forgive her ! - and send me word that , if she had a mind to , she would walk in the woods till midnight . Fancy the Cavaliere coming back and delivering such a message as that before the prince ! Think of a girl wantonly making light of such a chance as hers ! He would marry her to - morrow , at six o'clock in the morning ! "
75001	75008	75010	75010	Rowland	281	" It is certainly very sad , "
75012	75044	74815	74816	the lady	845	" That costs you little to say . If you had left your precious young meddler to vegetate in his native village you would have saved me a world of distress ! "
75045	75056	75058	75058	Rowland	281	" Nay , you marched into the jaws of danger , "
75060	75073	75058	75058	Rowland	281	" You came and disinterred poor Hudson in his own secluded studio . "
75074	75090	74815	74816	the lady	845	" In an evil hour ! I wish to Heaven you would talk with him . "
75091	75098	75058	75058	Rowland	281	" I have done my best . "
75099	75144	75145	75146	Mrs. Light	253	" I wish , then , you would take him away . You have plenty of money . Do me a favor . Take him to travel . Go to the East - go to Timbuctoo . Then , when Christina is Princess Casamassima , "
75152	75161	75145	75146	Mrs. Light	253	" he may come back if he chooses . "
75162	75170	75171	75171	Rowland	281	" Does she really care for him ? "
75176	75289	75290	75291	Mrs. Light	253	" She thinks she does , possibly . She is a living riddle . She must needs follow out every idea that comes into her head . Fortunately , most of them do n't last long ; but this one may last long enough to give the prince a chill . If that were to happen , I do n't know what I should do ! I should be the most miserable of women . It would be too cruel , after all I ' ve suffered to make her what she is , to see the labor of years blighted by a caprice . For I can assure you , sir , "
75295	75315	75290	75291	Mrs. Light	253	" that if my daughter is the greatest beauty in the world , some of the credit is mine . "
75661	75672	75674	75675	Mrs. Light	253	" I do n't know whether you believe in presentiments , "
75677	77062	75674	75675	Mrs. Light	253	" and I do n't care ! I have had one for the last fifteen years . People have laughed at it , but they have n't laughed me out of it . It has been everything to me . I could n't have lived without it . One must believe in something ! It came to me in a flash , when Christina was five years old . I remember the day and the place , as if it were yesterday . She was a very ugly baby ; for the first two years I could hardly bear to look at her , and I used to spoil my own looks with crying about her . She had an Italian nurse who was very fond of her and insisted that she would grow up pretty . I could n't believe her ; I used to contradict her , and we were forever squabbling . I was just a little silly in those days - surely I may say it now - and I was very fond of being amused . If my daughter was ugly , it was not that she resembled her mamma ; I had no lack of amusement . People accused me , I believe , of neglecting my little girl ; if it was so , I ' ve made up for it since . One day I went to drive on the Pincio in very low spirits . A trusted friend had greatly disappointed me . While I was there he passed me in a carriage , driving with a horrible woman who had made trouble between us . I got out of my carriage to walk about , and at last sat down on a bench . I can show you the spot at this hour . While I sat there a child came wandering along the path - a little girl of four or five , very fantastically dressed in crimson and orange . She stopped in front of me and stared at me , and I stared at her queer little dress , which was a cheap imitation of the costume of one of these contadine . At last I looked up at her face , and said to myself , ' Bless me , what a beautiful child ! what a splendid pair of eyes , what a magnificent head of hair ! If my poor Christina were only like that ! ' The child turned away slowly , but looking back with its eyes fixed on me . All of a sudden I gave a cry , pounced on it , pressed it in my arms , and covered it with kisses . It was Christina , my own precious child , so disguised by the ridiculous dress which the nurse had amused herself in making for her , that her own mother had not recognized her . She knew me , but she said afterwards that she had not spoken to me because I looked so angry . Of course my face was sad . I rushed with my child to the carriage , drove home post - haste , pulled off her rags , and , as I may say , wrapped her in cotton . I had been blind , I had been insane ; she was a creature in ten millions , she was to be a beauty of beauties , a priceless treasure ! Every day , after that , the certainty grew . From that time I lived only for my daughter . I watched her , I caressed her from morning till night , I worshipped her . I went to see doctors about her , I took every sort of advice . I was determined she should be perfection . The things that have been done for that girl , sir - you would n't believe them ; they would make you smile ! Nothing was spared ; if I had been told that she must have a bath every morning of molten pearls , I would have found means to give it to her . She never raised a finger for herself , she breathed nothing but perfumes , she walked upon velvet . She never was out of my sight , and from that day to this I have never said a sharp word to her . By the time she was ten years old she was beautiful as an angel , and so noticed wherever we went that I had to make her wear a veil , like a woman of twenty . Her hair reached down to her feet ; her hands were the hands of a princess . Then I saw that she was as clever as she was beautiful , and that she had only to play her cards . She had masters , professors , every educational advantage . They told me she was a little prodigy . She speaks French , Italian , German , better than most natives . She has a wonderful genius for music , and might make her fortune as a pianist , if it was not made for her otherwise ! I traveled all over Europe ; every one told me she was a marvel . The director of the opera in Paris saw her dance at a child 's party at Spa , and offered me an enormous sum if I would give her up to him and let him have her educated for the ballet . I said , ' No , I thank you , sir ; she is meant to be something finer than a princesse de theatre . ' I had a passionate belief that she might marry absolutely whom she chose , that she might be a princess out and out . It has never left me till this hour , and I can assure you that it has sustained me in many embarrassments . Financial , some of them ; I do n't mind confessing it ! I have raised money on that girl 's face ! I ' ve taken her to the Jews and bade her put up her veil , and asked if the mother of that young lady was not safe ! She , of course , was too young to understand me . And yet , as a child , you would have said she knew what was in store for her ; before she could read , she had the manners , the tastes , the instincts of a little princess . She would have nothing to do with shabby things or shabby people ; if she stained one of her frocks , she was seized with a kind of frenzy and tore it to pieces . At Nice , at Baden , at Brighton , wherever we stayed , she used to be sent for by all the great people to play with their children . She has played at kissing - games with people who now stand on the steps of thrones ! I have gone so far as to think at times that those childish kisses were a sign - a symbol - a portent . You may laugh at me if you like , but have n't such things happened again and again without half as good a cause , and does n't history notoriously repeat itself ? There was a little Spanish girl at a second - rate English boarding - school thirty years ago ! ... The Empress certainly is a pretty woman ; but what is my Christina , pray ? I ' ve dreamt of it , sometimes every night for a month . I wo n't tell you I have been to consult those old women who advertise in the newspapers ; you 'll call me an old imbecile . Imbecile if you please ! I have refused magnificent offers because I believed that somehow or other - if wars and revolutions were needed to bring it about - we should have nothing less than that . There might be another coup d'etat somewhere , and another brilliant young sovereign looking out for a wife ! At last , however , "
77218	77218	77206	77206	his	1695	"
77278	77287	77288	77288	he	1700	" I certainly hope you 'll keep him , "
77294	77328	77288	77288	he	1700	" You have played a dangerous game with your daughter ; it would be a pity not to win . But there is hope for you yet ; here she comes at last ! "
77393	77406	77407	77407	she	192	" Bless my soul , how they are all looking at us ! "
77414	77425	77427	77427	she	192	" One would think we were prisoners of the Inquisition ! "
77459	77494	77449	77449	her	192	" What is it , pray ? Have I been very improper ? Am I ruined forever ? Dear prince , you are looking at me as if I had committed the unpardonable sin ! "
77495	77499	77501	77502	the prince	3484	" I myself , "
77504	77524	77501	77502	the prince	3484	" would never have ventured to ask you to walk with me alone in the country for an hour ! "
77525	77560	77449	77449	her	192	" The more fool you , dear prince , as the vulgar say ! Our walk has been charming . I hope you , on your side , have enjoyed each other 's society . "
77561	77566	77568	77569	Mrs. Light	253	" My dear daughter , "
77583	77606	77568	77569	Mrs. Light	253	" I shall have something serious to say to you when we reach home . We will go back to the carriage . "
77607	77655	77656	77656	Christina	192	" Something serious ! Decidedly , it is the Inquisition . Mr. Hudson , stand firm , and let us agree to make no confessions without conferring previously with each other ! They may put us on the rack first . Mr. Mallet , I see also , "
77659	77668	77656	77656	Christina	192	" has something serious to say to me ! "
77688	77691	77692	77692	he	1710	" Possibly , "
77695	77705	77692	77692	he	1710	" But it must be for some other time . "
77706	77781	77805	77805	Roderick	186	" I am at your service . I see our good - humor is gone . And I only wanted to be amiable ! It is very discouraging . Cavaliere , you , only , look as if you had a little of the milk of human kindness left ; from your venerable visage , at least ; there is no telling what you think . Give me your arm and take me away ! "
77882	77887	77888	77888	he	3484	" I am off , "
77891	77914	77888	77888	he	3484	" I am back to work . I have an idea . I must strike while the iron 's hot ! Farewell ! "
78619	78627	78629	78629	Christina	192	" If what you say is true , "
78650	78671	78632	78632	her	192	" you are simply weak . I am sorry ! I hoped - I really believed - you were not . "
78672	78680	78682	78682	Roderick	186	" No , I am not weak , "
78687	78717	78682	78682	Roderick	186	" I maintain that I am not weak ! I am incomplete , perhaps ; but I ca n't help that . Weakness is a man 's own fault ! "
78718	78723	78725	78725	Christina	192	" Incomplete , then ! "
78731	78768	78725	78725	Christina	192	" It 's the same thing , so long as it keeps you from splendid achievement . Is it written , then , that I shall really never know what I have so often dreamed of ? "
78769	78776	78682	78682	Roderick	186	" What have you dreamed of ? "
78777	78786	78788	78790	the young girl	659	" A man whom I can perfectly respect ! "
78797	78933	78788	78790	the young girl	659	" A man , at least , whom I can unrestrictedly admire . I meet one , as I have met more than one before , whom I fondly believe to be cast in a larger mould than most of the vile human breed , to be large in character , great in talent , strong in will ! In such a man as that , I say , one 's weary imagination at last may rest ; or it may wander if it will , yet never need to wander far from the deeps where one 's heart is anchored . When I first knew you , I gave no sign , but you had struck me . I observed you , as women observe , and I fancied you had the sacred fire . "
78934	78943	78945	78945	Roderick	186	" Before heaven , I believe I have ! "
78947	78994	78788	78790	the young girl	659	" Ah , but so little ! It flickers and trembles and sputters ; it goes out , you tell me , for whole weeks together . From your own account , it 's ten to one that in the long run you 're a failure . "
78995	79031	78788	78790	the young girl	659	" I say those things sometimes myself , but when I hear you say them they make me feel as if I could work twenty years at a sitting , on purpose to refute you ! "
79032	79046	79047	79047	Christina	192	" Ah , the man who is strong with what I call strength , "
79050	79302	79047	79047	Christina	192	" would neither rise nor fall by anything I could say ! I am a poor , weak woman ; I have no strength myself , and I can give no strength . I am a miserable medley of vanity and folly . I am silly , I am ignorant , I am affected , I am false . I am the fruit of a horrible education , sown on a worthless soil . I am all that , and yet I believe I have one merit ! I should know a great character when I saw it , and I should delight in it with a generosity which would do something toward the remission of my sins . For a man who should really give me a certain feeling - which I have never had , but which I should know when it came - I would send Prince Casamassima and his millions to perdition . I do n't know what you think of me for saying all this ; I suppose we have not climbed up here under the skies to play propriety . Why have you been at such pains to assure me , after all , that you are a little man and not a great one , a weak one and not a strong ? I innocently imagined that your eyes declared you were strong . But your voice condemns you ; I always wondered at it ; it 's not the voice of a conqueror ! "
79303	79310	79312	79312	Roderick	186	" Give me something to conquer , "
79314	79341	79312	79312	Roderick	186	" and when I say that I thank you from my soul , my voice , whatever you think of it , shall speak the truth ! "
79358	79365	79366	79366	she	281	" You pretend to such devotion , "
79370	79389	79366	79366	she	281	" and yet I am sure you have never really chosen between me and that person in America . "
79390	79401	79403	79403	Roderick	186	" Do me the favor not to speak of her , "
79407	79447	79366	79366	she	281	" Why not ? I say no ill of her , and I think all kinds of good . I am certain she is a far better girl than I , and far more likely to make you happy . "
79448	79459	79461	79461	Roderick	186	" This is happiness , this present , palpable moment , "
79463	79478	79461	79461	Roderick	186	" though you have such a genius for saying the things that torture me ! "
79479	79640	79641	79641	Roderick	186	" It 's greater happiness than you deserve , then ! You have never chosen , I say ; you have been afraid to choose . You have never really faced the fact that you are false , that you have broken your faith . You have never looked at it and seen that it was hideous , and yet said , ' No matter , I 'll brave the penalty , I 'll bear the shame ! ' You have closed your eyes ; you have tried to stifle remembrance , to persuade yourself that you were not behaving as badly as you seemed to be , and there would be some way , after all , of compassing bliss and yet escaping trouble . You have faltered and drifted , you have gone on from accident to accident , and I am sure that at this present moment you ca n't tell what it is you really desire ! "
79682	79976	79672	79672	Christina	192	" I believe that , really , you do n't greatly care for your friend in America any more than you do for me . You are one of the men who care only for themselves and for what they can make of themselves . That 's very well when they can make something great , and I could interest myself in a man of extraordinary power who should wish to turn all his passions to account . But if the power should turn out to be , after all , rather ordinary ? Fancy feeling one 's self ground in the mill of a third - rate talent ! If you have doubts about yourself , I ca n't reassure you ; I have too many doubts myself , about everything in this weary world . You have gone up like a rocket , in your profession , they tell me ; are you going to come down like the stick ? I do n't pretend to know ; I repeat frankly what I have said before - that all modern sculpture seems to me weak , and that the only things I care for are some of the most battered of the antiques of the Vatican . No , no , I ca n't reassure you ; and when you tell me - with a confidence in my discretion of which , certainly , I am duly sensible - that at times you feel terribly small , why , I can only answer , ' Ah , then , my poor friend , I am afraid you are small . ' The language I should like to hear , from a certain person , would be the language of absolute decision . "
80060	80073	80074	80074	she	281	" Is that little flower we see outlined against that dark niche , "
80077	80088	80089	80089	She	281	" as intensely blue as it looks through my veil ? "
80163	80169	80170	80170	he	186	" Put up your veil ! "
80176	80184	80185	80185	he	186	" Does it look as blue now ? "
80188	80196	80197	80197	she	192	" Ah , what a lovely color ! "
80207	80215	80197	80197	she	192	" Would you like to have it ? "
80228	80236	80237	80237	he	186	" Would you like to have it ? "
80244	80256	80257	80257	she	192	" Do n't look as if you would eat me up , "
80260	80269	80257	80257	she	192	" It 's harmless if I say yes ! "
80331	80338	80339	80339	he	186	" I will bring it you , "
80347	80359	80342	80342	She	192	" Are you crazy ? Do you mean to kill yourself ? "
80360	80370	80342	80342	She	192	" I shall not kill myself . Sit down ! "
80371	80380	80382	80382	she	192	" Excuse me . Not till you do ! "
80405	80409	80410	80410	he	186	" Go there ! "
80414	80421	80422	80422	she	192	" You can never , never ! "
80430	80435	80422	80422	she	192	" I implore you ! "
80475	80479	80472	80472	he	186	" Sit down ! "
80775	80780	80782	80782	Rowland	281	" My dear Roderick , "
80784	80811	80782	80782	Rowland	281	" I am only preventing you from doing a very foolish thing . That 's an exploit for spiders , not for young sculptors of promise . "
80839	80846	80847	80847	he	186	" I wo n't resist you , "
80850	80858	80859	80859	he	186	" But I have made you obey , "
80866	80872	80859	80859	he	186	" Am I weak now ? "
80888	80904	80879	80879	she	192	" Be so good as to show me the way out of this horrible place ! "
81244	81252	81253	81253	Roderick	186	" Of course it seems to you , "
81256	81265	81253	81253	Roderick	186	" a proof that I am utterly infatuated . "
81266	81282	81283	81283	Rowland	281	" Miss Light seemed to me to know very well how far she could go , "
81286	81332	81283	81283	Rowland	281	" She was twisting you round her finger . I do n't think she exactly meant to defy you ; but your crazy pursuit of that flower was a proof that she could go all lengths in the way of making a fool of you . "
81333	81336	81338	81338	Roderick	186	" Yes , "
81351	81351	81343	81343	she	1771	"
81352	81363	81283	81283	Rowland	281	" And what do you expect to come of it ? "
81364	81368	81370	81370	Roderick	186	" Nothing good ! "
81392	81411	81381	81381	he	186	" And in the light of your late interview , what do you make of your young lady ? "
81412	81437	81381	81381	he	186	" If I could tell you that , it would be plain sailing . But she 'll not tell me again I am weak ! "
81438	81448	81381	81381	he	186	" Are you very sure you are not weak ? "
81449	81461	81381	81381	he	186	" I may be , but she shall never know it . "
81499	81552	81493	81493	his	186	" Oh no , I ca n't settle down to work after such a scene as that . I was not afraid of breaking my neck then , but I feel all in a tremor now . I will go - I will go and sit in the sun on the Pincio ! "
81553	81560	81562	81562	Rowland	281	" Promise me this , first , "
81567	81589	81562	81562	Rowland	281	" that the next time you meet Miss Light , it shall be on the earth and not in the air . "
81789	81794	81767	81767	he	186	" Pearl of Perugia , "
82449	82466	82467	82467	he	186	" I like to talk to a man whose ancestor has walled up his wife alive , "
82471	82561	82467	82467	he	186	" You may not see the fun of it , and think poor P - - is a very dull fellow . It 's very possible ; I do n't ask you to admire him . But , for reasons of my own , I like to have him about . The old fellow left her for three days with her face uncovered , and placed a long mirror opposite to her , so that she could see , as he said , if her gown was a fit ! "
82905	82911	82912	82912	Roderick	186	" It was awfully low , "
82915	83231	82912	82912	Roderick	186	" all of a sudden I perceived it , and bolted . Nothing of that kind ever amuses me to the end : before it 's half over it bores me to death ; it makes me sick . Hang it , why ca n't a poor fellow enjoy things in peace ? My illusions are all broken - winded ; they wo n't carry me twenty paces ! I ca n't laugh and forget ; my laugh dies away before it begins . Your friend Stendhal writes on his book - covers I never got farther that he has seen too early in life la beaute parfaite . I do n't know how early he saw it ; I saw it before I was born - in another state of being ! I ca n't describe it positively ; I can only say I do n't find it anywhere now . Not at the bottom of champagne glasses ; not , strange as it may seem , in that extra half - yard or so of shoulder that some women have their ball - dresses cut to expose . I do n't find it at merry supper - tables , where half a dozen ugly men with pomatumed heads are rapidly growing uglier still with heat and wine ; not when I come away and walk through these squalid black streets , and go out into the Forum and see a few old battered stone posts standing there like gnawed bones stuck into the earth . Everything is mean and dusky and shabby , and the men and women who make up this so - called brilliant society are the meanest and shabbiest of all . They have no real spontaneity ; they are all cowards and popinjays . They have no more dignity than so many grasshoppers . Nothing is good but one ! "
83256	83263	83265	83265	Rowland	281	" Yes , do tell us , "
83267	83274	83265	83265	Rowland	281	" what to hold on by ! "
83275	83284	83285	83285	he	1830	" Those things of mine were tolerably good , "
83288	83302	83285	83285	he	1830	" But my idea was better - and that 's what I mean ! "
83351	83361	83362	83363	the latter	652	" You think I ' m an impudent humbug , "
83368	83408	83362	83363	the latter	652	" coming up to moralize at this hour of the night . You think I want to throw dust into your eyes , to put you off the scent . That 's your eminently rational view of the case . "
83409	83419	83421	83421	Rowland	281	" Excuse me from taking any view at all , "
83423	83432	83362	83363	the latter	652	" You have given me up , then ? "
83433	83446	83362	83363	the latter	652	" No , I have merely suspended judgment . I am waiting . "
83447	83458	83362	83363	the latter	652	" You have ceased then positively to believe in me ? "
83465	83509	83459	83459	Rowland	281	" Oh , cruel boy ! When you have hit your mark and made people care for you , you should n't twist your weapon about at that rate in their vitals . Allow me to say I am sleepy . Good night ! "
83898	83917	83895	83895	Christina	192	" Are you looking for Mr. Hudson ? He is not here , I am happy to say . "
83918	83922	83923	83923	he	1851	" But you ? "
83926	83936	83923	83923	he	1851	" This is a strange place to find you . "
83937	84093	83895	83895	Christina	192	" Not at all ! People call me a strange girl , and I might as well have the comfort of it . I came to take a walk ; that , by the way , is part of my strangeness . I ca n't loll all the morning on a sofa , and all the afternoon in a carriage . I get horribly restless . I must move ; I must do something and see something . Mamma suggests a cup of tea . Meanwhile I put on an old dress and half a dozen veils , I take Assunta under my arm , and we start on a pedestrian tour . It 's a bore that I ca n't take the poodle , but he attracts attention . We trudge about everywhere ; there is nothing I like so much . I hope you will congratulate me on the simplicity of my tastes . "
84094	84135	84178	84178	he	1862	" I congratulate you on your wisdom . To live in Rome and not to walk would , I think , be poor pleasure . But you are terribly far from home , and I am afraid you are tired . "
84136	84147	83895	83895	Christina	192	" A little - enough to sit here a while . "
84148	84159	84178	84178	he	1862	" Might I offer you my company while you rest ? "
84160	84175	83895	83895	Christina	192	" If you will promise to amuse me . I am in dismal spirits . "
84337	84354	84355	84355	she	192	" No , no ; while you are about it , say a few dozen more ! "
84358	84363	84364	84364	she	192	" Pray for me , "
84369	84391	84364	84364	she	192	" Pray , I say nothing silly . She has been at it half an hour ; I envy her capacity ! "
84392	84401	84402	84402	Rowland	281	" Have you never felt in any degree , "
84405	84411	84402	84402	Rowland	281	" the fascination of Catholicism ? "
84412	84539	84364	84364	she	192	" Yes , I have been through that , too ! There was a time when I wanted immensely to be a nun ; it was not a laughing matter . It was when I was about sixteen years old . I read the Imitation and the Life of Saint Catherine . I fully believed in the miracles of the saints , and I was dying to have one of my own . The least little accident that could have been twisted into a miracle would have carried me straight into the bosom of the church . I had the real religious passion . It has passed away , and , as I sat here just now , I was wondering what had become of it ! "
84727	84736	84737	84737	he	1869	" I am afraid I am sadly prosaic , "
84740	84790	84737	84737	he	1869	" for in these many months now that I have been in Rome , I have never ceased for a moment to look at Catholicism simply from the outside . I do n't see an opening as big as your finger - nail where I could creep into it ! "
84791	84797	84799	84799	Christina	192	" What do you believe ? "
84805	84810	84799	84799	Christina	192	" Are you religious ? "
84811	84817	84818	84818	Christina	192	" I believe in God . "
84834	84842	84820	84820	her	192	" You are much to be envied ! "
84843	84858	84799	84799	Christina	192	" You , I imagine , in that line have nothing to envy me . "
84859	84867	84820	84820	her	192	" Yes , I have . Rest ! "
84868	84877	84799	84799	Christina	192	" You are too young to say that . "
84878	84907	84820	84820	her	192	" I am not young ; I have never been young ! My mother took care of that . I was a little wrinkled old woman at ten . "
84908	84913	84915	84915	Rowland	281	" I am afraid , "
84921	84933	84915	84915	Rowland	281	" that you are fond of painting yourself in dark colors . "
84943	84948	84949	84949	she	192	" Do you wish , "
84954	84972	84949	84949	she	192	" to win my eternal gratitude ? Prove to me that I am better than I suppose . "
84973	84985	84988	84988	her	192	" I should have first to know what you really suppose . "
84991	85024	84988	84988	her	192	" It would n't do . You would be horrified to learn even the things I imagine about myself , and shocked at the knowledge of evil displayed in my very mistakes . "
85025	85030	85032	85032	Rowland	281	" Well , then , "
85034	85064	85032	85032	Rowland	281	" I will ask no questions . But , at a venture , I promise you to catch you some day in the act of doing something very good . "
85065	85074	85075	85075	she	192	" Can it be , can it be , "
85078	85108	85075	85075	she	192	" that you too are trying to flatter me ? I thought you and I had fallen , from the first , into rather a truth - speaking vein . "
85109	85118	85120	85120	Rowland	281	" Oh , I have not abandoned it ! "
85173	85181	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" Please tell me about your religion . "
85182	85192	85194	85194	Rowland	281	" Tell you about it ? I ca n't ! "
85208	85230	85203	85203	She	659	" Is it such a mighty mystery it can not be put into words , nor communicated to my base ears ? "
85231	85258	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" It is simply a sentiment that makes part of my life , and I ca n't detach myself from it sufficiently to talk about it . "
85259	85290	85203	85203	She	659	" Religion , it seems to me , should be eloquent and aggressive . It should wish to make converts , to persuade and illumine , to sway all hearts ! "
85291	85316	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" One 's religion takes the color of one 's general disposition . I am not aggressive , and certainly I am not eloquent . "
85317	85427	85203	85203	She	659	" Beware , then , of finding yourself confronted with doubt and despair ! I am sure that doubt , at times , and the bitterness that comes of it , can be terribly eloquent . To tell the truth , my lonely musings , before you came in , were eloquent enough , in their way . What do you know of anything but this strange , terrible world that surrounds you ? How do you know that your faith is not a mere crazy castle in the air ; one of those castles that we are called fools for building when we lodge them in this life ? "
85428	85456	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" I do n't know it , any more than any one knows the contrary . But one 's religion is extremely ingenious in doing without knowledge . "
85457	85470	85203	85203	She	659	" In such a world as this it certainly needs to be ! "
85474	85484	85471	85471	Rowland	281	" What is your particular quarrel with this world ? "
85485	85698	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" It 's a general quarrel . Nothing is true , or fixed , or permanent . We all seem to be playing with shadows more or less grotesque . It all comes over me here so dismally ! The very atmosphere of this cold , deserted church seems to mock at one 's longing to believe in something . Who cares for it now ? who comes to it ? who takes it seriously ? Poor stupid Assunta there gives in her adhesion in a jargon she does n't understand , and you and I , proper , passionless tourists , come lounging in to rest from a walk . And yet the Catholic church was once the proudest institution in the world , and had quite its own way with men 's souls . When such a mighty structure as that turns out to have a flaw , what faith is one to put in one 's poor little views and philosophies ? What is right and what is wrong ? What is one really to care for ? What is the proper rule of life ? I am tired of trying to discover , and I suspect it 's not worth the trouble . Live as most amuses you ! "
85699	85707	85709	85709	Rowland	281	" Your perplexities are so terribly comprehensive , "
85713	85724	85709	85709	Rowland	281	" that one hardly knows where to meet them first . "
85725	85757	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" I do n't care much for anything you can say , because it 's sure to be half - hearted . You are not in the least contented , yourself . "
85758	85765	85709	85709	Rowland	281	" How do you know that ? "
85766	85774	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" Oh , I am an observer ! "
85775	85794	85709	85709	Rowland	281	" No one is absolutely contented , I suppose , but I assure you I complain of nothing . "
85795	85813	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" So much the worse for your honesty . To begin with , you are in love . "
85814	85824	85709	85709	Rowland	281	" You would not have me complain of that ! "
85825	85871	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" And it does n't go well . There are grievous obstacles . So much I know ! You need n't protest ; I ask no questions . You will tell no one - me least of all . Why does one never see you ? "
85872	85882	85884	85884	Rowland	281	" Why , if I came to see you , "
85888	85955	85884	85884	Rowland	281	" it would n't be , it could n't be , for a trivial reason - because I had not been in a month , because I was passing , because I admire you . It would be because I should have something very particular to say . I have not come , because I have been slow in making up my mind to say it . "
85956	85977	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" You are simply cruel . Something particular , in this ocean of inanities ? In common charity , speak ! "
85978	85987	85884	85884	Rowland	281	" I doubt whether you will like it . "
85988	86001	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" Oh , I hope to heaven it 's not a compliment ! "
86002	86030	85884	85884	Rowland	281	" It may be called a compliment to your reasonableness . You perhaps remember that I gave you a hint of it the other day at Frascati . "
86031	86051	85158	85160	the young girl	659	" Has it been hanging fire all this time ? Explode ! I promise not to stop my ears . "
86052	86060	85884	85884	Rowland	281	" It relates to my friend Hudson . "
86078	86101	86102	86102	He	1875	" I am rather disturbed in mind about him . He seems to me at times to be in an unpromising way . "
86111	86118	86119	86119	he	1875	" The case is simply this , "
86123	86236	86119	86119	he	1875	" It was by my advice he renounced his career at home and embraced his present one . I made him burn his ships . I brought him to Rome , I launched him in the world , and I stand surety , in a measure , to - to his mother , for his prosperity . It is not such smooth sailing as it might be , and I am inclined to put up prayers for fair winds . If he is to succeed , he must work - quietly , devotedly . It is not news to you , I imagine , that Hudson is a great admirer of yours . "
86402	86411	86412	86412	she	192	" Mr. Hudson is in love with me ! "
86422	86426	86427	86427	he	1876	" Am I , "
86430	86445	86427	86427	he	1876	" from this point of view of mine , to be glad or sorry ? "
86446	86453	86467	86467	She	192	" I do n't understand you . "
86454	86466	86427	86427	he	1876	" Why , is Hudson to be happy , or unhappy ? "
86472	86497	86467	86467	She	192	" You wish him to be great in his profession ? And for that you consider that he must be happy in his life ? "
86498	86521	86427	86427	he	1876	" Decidedly . I do n't say it 's a general rule , but I think it is a rule for him . "
86522	86537	86467	86467	She	192	" So that if he were very happy , he would become very great ? "
86538	86547	86427	86427	he	1876	" He would at least do himself justice . "
86548	86558	86467	86467	She	192	" And by that you mean a great deal ? "
86559	86564	86427	86427	he	1876	" A great deal . "
86591	86608	86467	86467	She	192	" You have not forgotten , I suppose , that you told me he was engaged ? "
86609	86614	86467	86467	She	192	" By no means . "
86615	86623	86467	86467	She	192	" He is still engaged , then ? "
86624	86632	86467	86467	She	192	" To the best of my belief . "
86633	86657	86467	86467	She	192	" And yet you desire that , as you say , he should be made happy by something I can do for him ? "
86658	86758	86467	86467	She	192	" What I desire is this . That your great influence with him should be exerted for his good , that it should help him and not retard him . Understand me . You probably know that your lovers have rather a restless time of it . I can answer for two of them . You do n't know your own mind very well , I imagine , and you like being admired , rather at the expense of the admirer . Since we are really being frank , I wonder whether I might not say the great word . "
86759	86774	86467	86467	She	192	" You need n't ; I know it . I am a horrible coquette . "
86775	86806	86467	86467	She	192	" No , not a horrible one , since I am making an appeal to your generosity . I am pretty sure you can not imagine yourself marrying my friend . "
86807	86821	86467	86467	She	192	" There 's nothing I can not imagine ! That is my trouble . "
86828	86837	86838	86838	he	1881	" I can not imagine it , then ! "
86850	86860	86861	86861	she	192	" I am not so bad as you think , "
86864	86889	86467	86467	She	192	" It is not a question of badness ; it is a question of whether circumstances do n't make the thing an extreme improbability . "
86890	86905	86467	86467	She	192	" Worse and worse . I can be bullied , then , or bribed ! "
86906	86913	86915	86915	Rowland	281	" You are not so candid , "
86917	87057	86915	86915	Rowland	281	" as you pretend to be . My feeling is this . Hudson , as I understand him , does not need , as an artist , the stimulus of strong emotion , of passion . He 's better without it ; he 's emotional and passionate enough when he 's left to himself . The sooner passion is at rest , therefore , the sooner he will settle down to work , and the fewer emotions he has that are mere emotions and nothing more , the better for him . If you cared for him enough to marry him , I should have nothing to say ; I would never venture to interfere . But I strongly suspect you do n't , and therefore I would suggest , most respectfully , that you should let him alone . "
87058	87080	87197	87197	Christina	192	" And if I let him alone , as you say , all will be well with him for ever more ? "
87081	87103	86915	86915	Rowland	281	" Not immediately and not absolutely , but things will be easier . He will be better able to concentrate himself . "
87104	87117	87197	87197	Christina	192	" What is he doing now ? Wherein does he dissatisfy you ? "
87118	87146	86915	86915	Rowland	281	" I can hardly say . He 's like a watch that 's running down . He is moody , desultory , idle , irregular , fantastic . "
87147	87161	87197	87197	Christina	192	" Heavens , what a list ! And it 's all poor me ? "
87162	87196	86915	86915	Rowland	281	" No , not all . But you are a part of it , and I turn to you because you are a more tangible , sensible , responsible cause than the others . "
87236	87244	87245	87245	she	192	" If I were to marry him , "
87248	87257	87245	87245	she	192	" what would have become of his fiancee ? "
87258	87271	87272	87272	Christina	192	" I am bound to suppose that she would be extremely unhappy . "
87351	87357	87358	87358	she	192	" What do you think , "
87365	87372	87358	87358	she	192	" of your friend 's infidelity ? "
87373	87380	87349	87349	Christina	192	" I do n't like it . "
87381	87391	87358	87358	she	192	" Was he very much in love with her ? "
87392	87404	87349	87349	Christina	192	" He asked her to marry him . You may judge . "
87405	87410	87358	87358	she	192	" Is she rich ? "
87411	87418	87349	87349	Christina	192	" No , she is poor . "
87419	87429	87358	87358	she	192	" Is she very much in love with him ? "
87430	87439	87349	87349	Christina	192	" I know her too little to say . "
87448	87467	87440	87440	She	192	" You have settled in your mind , then , that I will never seriously listen to him ? "
87468	87480	87358	87358	she	192	" I think it unlikely , until the contrary is proved . "
87481	87497	87440	87440	She	192	" How shall it be proved ? How do you know what passes between us ? "
87498	87532	87358	87358	she	192	" I can judge , of course , but from appearance ; but , like you , I am an observer . Hudson has not at all the air of a prosperous suitor . "
87533	87568	87569	87569	she	192	" If he is depressed , there is a reason . He has a bad conscience . One must hope so , at least . On the other hand , simply as a friend , "
87573	87583	87569	87569	she	192	" you think I can do him no good ? "
87618	87635	87636	87636	he	1884	" There are doubtless many good things you might do , if you had proper opportunity , "
87639	87684	87636	87636	he	1884	" But you seem to be sailing with a current which leaves you little leisure for quiet benevolence . You live in the whirl and hurry of a world into which a poor artist can hardly find it to his advantage to follow you . "
87685	87701	87587	87587	her	192	" In plain English , I am hopelessly frivolous . You put it very generously . "
87702	87713	87715	87715	Rowland	281	" I wo n't hesitate to say all my thought , "
87717	87767	87715	87715	Rowland	281	" For better or worse , you seem to me to belong , both by character and by circumstance , to what is called the world , the great world . You are made to ornament it magnificently . You are not made to be an artist 's wife . "
87768	87799	87587	87587	her	192	" I see . But even from your point of view , that would depend upon the artist . Extraordinary talent might make him a member of the great world ! "
87803	87809	87800	87800	Rowland	281	" That is very true . "
87810	87817	87818	87818	Christina	192	" If , as it is , "
87824	87852	87818	87818	Christina	192	" you take a low view of me - no , you need n't protest - I wonder what you would think if you knew certain things . "
87853	87860	87800	87800	Rowland	281	" What things do you mean ? "
87861	87903	87818	87818	Christina	192	" Well , for example , how I was brought up . I have had a horrible education . There must be some good in me , since I have perceived it , since I have turned and judged my circumstances . "
87904	87910	87911	87911	Rowland	281	" My dear Miss Light ! "
87922	87941	87914	87914	She	192	" You do n't want to hear ? you do n't want to have to think about that ? "
87942	87955	87818	87818	Christina	192	" Have I a right to ? You need n't justify yourself . "
87976	87986	87987	87987	she	192	" Is there not some novel or some play , "
87992	88020	87987	87987	she	192	" in which some beautiful , wicked woman who has ensnared a young man sees his father come to her and beg her to let him go ? "
88021	88025	88027	88027	Rowland	281	" Very likely , "
88029	88035	88027	88027	Rowland	281	" I hope she consents . "
88036	88044	88045	88045	she	192	" I forget . But tell me , "
88092	88092	88075	88075	I	0	"
88142	88151	88152	88152	he	1885	" You do something I shall greatly respect , "
88173	88183	88184	88184	she	192	" What have I to do to - day ? "
88190	88210	88211	88211	she	192	" Eh , it 's a very busy day ! Fortunately I have a better memory than the signorina , "
88226	88328	88218	88218	She	192	" We have to go to the Pie di Marmo to see about those laces that were sent to be washed . You said also that you wished to say three sharp words to the Buonvicini about your pink dress . You want some moss - rosebuds for to - night , and you wo n't get them for nothing ! You dine at the Austrian Embassy , and that Frenchman is to powder your hair . You 're to come home in time to receive , for the signora gives a dance . And so away , away till morning ! "
88329	88339	88340	88340	Christina	192	" Ah , yes , the moss - roses ! "
88345	88416	88418	88418	she	192	" I must have a quantity - at least a hundred . Nothing but buds , eh ? You must sew them in a kind of immense apron , down the front of my dress . Packed tight together , eh ? It will be delightfully barbarous . And then twenty more or so for my hair . They go very well with powder ; do n't you think so ? "
88423	88430	88418	88418	she	192	" I am going en Pompadour . "
88431	88435	88504	88504	she	192	" Going where ? "
88436	88447	88418	88418	she	192	" To the Spanish Embassy , or whatever it is . "
88448	88465	88466	88466	Assunta	282	" All down the front , signorina ? Dio buono ! You must give me time ! "
88469	88476	88478	88478	she	192	" Yes , we 'll go ! "
88631	88634	88623	88623	she	192	" reasonableness . "
88635	88685	88623	88623	she	192	" It 's really very comfortable to be asked , to be expected , to do something good , after all the horrid things one has been used to doing - instructed , commanded , forced to do ! I 'll think over what you have said to me . "
88749	88754	88755	88755	she	192	" So , decidedly , "
88759	88766	88755	88755	she	192	" I can only harm him ? "
88767	88775	88777	88777	Rowland	281	" You make me feel very brutal , "
88779	88798	88755	88755	she	192	" And he is such a fine fellow that it would be really a great pity , eh ? "
88799	88807	88808	88808	Rowland	281	" I shall praise him no more , "
88821	88852	88811	88811	She	192	" Do you remember promising me , soon after we first met , that at the end of six months you would tell me definitely what you thought of me ? "
88853	88860	88808	88808	Rowland	281	" It was a foolish promise . "
88861	88884	88885	88885	She	192	" You gave it . Bear it in mind . I will think of what you have said to me . Farewell . "
88945	88955	88994	88998	the old serving - woman	1901	" I have done it . Begin and respect me !
88956	88960	88933	88933	He	1900	" - C. L. "
89038	91011	91020	91020	Rowland	281	" So much for myself ; yet I tell you but a tithe of my own story unless I let you know how matters stand with poor Hudson , for he gives me more to think about just now than anything else in the world . I need a good deal of courage to begin this chapter . You warned me , you know , and I made rather light of your warning . I have had all kinds of hopes and fears , but hitherto , in writing to you , I have resolutely put the hopes foremost . Now , however , my pride has forsaken me , and I should like hugely to give expression to a little comfortable despair . I should like to say , ' My dear wise woman , you were right and I was wrong ; you were a shrewd observer and I was a meddlesome donkey ! ' When I think of a little talk we had about the ' salubrity of genius , ' I feel my ears tingle . If this is salubrity , give me raging disease ! I ' m pestered to death ; I go about with a chronic heartache ; there are moments when I could shed salt tears . There 's a pretty portrait of the most placid of men ! I wish I could make you understand ; or rather , I wish you could make me ! I do n't understand a jot ; it 's a hideous , mocking mystery ; I give it up ! I do n't in the least give it up , you know ; I ' m incapable of giving it up . I sit holding my head by the hour , racking my brain , wondering what under heaven is to be done . You told me at Northampton that I took the thing too easily ; you would tell me now , perhaps , that I take it too hard . I do , altogether ; but it ca n't be helped . Without flattering myself , I may say I ' m sympathetic . Many another man before this would have cast his perplexities to the winds and declared that Mr. Hudson must lie on his bed as he had made it . Some men , perhaps , would even say that I am making a mighty ado about nothing ; that I have only to give him rope , and he will tire himself out . But he tugs at his rope altogether too hard for me to hold it comfortably . I certainly never pretended the thing was anything else than an experiment ; I promised nothing , I answered for nothing ; I only said the case was hopeful , and that it would be a shame to neglect it . I have done my best , and if the machine is running down I have a right to stand aside and let it scuttle . Amen , amen ! No , I can write that , but I ca n't feel it . I ca n't be just ; I can only be generous . I love the poor fellow and I ca n't give him up . As for understanding him , that 's another matter ; nowadays I do n't believe even you would . One 's wits are sadly pestered over here , I assure you , and I ' m in the way of seeing more than one puzzling specimen of human nature . Roderick and Miss Light , between them ! ... Have n't I already told you about Miss Light ? Last winter everything was perfection . Roderick struck out bravely , did really great things , and proved himself , as I supposed , thoroughly solid . He was strong , he was first - rate ; I felt perfectly secure and sang private paeans of joy . We had passed at a bound into the open sea , and left danger behind . But in the summer I began to be puzzled , though I succeeded in not being alarmed . When we came back to Rome , however , I saw that the tide had turned and that we were close upon the rocks . It is , in fact , another case of Ulysses alongside of the Sirens ; only Roderick refuses to be tied to the mast . He is the most extraordinary being , the strangest mixture of qualities . I do n't understand so much force going with so much weakness - such a brilliant gift being subject to such lapses . The poor fellow is incomplete , and it is really not his own fault ; Nature has given him the faculty out of hand and bidden him be hanged with it . I never knew a man harder to advise or assist , if he is not in the mood for listening . I suppose there is some key or other to his character , but I try in vain to find it ; and yet I ca n't believe that Providence is so cruel as to have turned the lock and thrown the key away . He perplexes me , as I say , to death , and though he tires out my patience , he still fascinates me . Sometimes I think he has n't a grain of conscience , and sometimes I think that , in a way , he has an excess . He takes things at once too easily and too hard ; he is both too lax and too tense , too reckless and too ambitious , too cold and too passionate . He has developed faster even than you prophesied , and for good and evil alike he takes up a formidable space . There 's too much of him for me , at any rate . Yes , he is hard ; there is no mistake about that . He 's inflexible , he 's brittle ; and though he has plenty of spirit , plenty of soul , he has n't what I call a heart . He has something that Miss Garland took for one , and I ' m pretty sure she 's a judge . But she judged on scanty evidence . He has something that Christina Light , here , makes believe at times that she takes for one , but she is no judge at all ! I think it is established that , in the long run , egotism makes a failure in conduct : is it also true that it makes a failure in the arts ? ... Roderick 's standard is immensely high ; I must do him that justice . He will do nothing beneath it , and while he is waiting for inspiration , his imagination , his nerves , his senses must have something to amuse them . This is a highly philosophical way of saying that he has taken to dissipation , and that he has just been spending a month at Naples - a city where ' pleasure ' is actively cultivated - in very bad company . Are they all like that , all the men of genius ? There are a great many artists here who hammer away at their trade with exemplary industry ; in fact I am surprised at their success in reducing the matter to a steady , daily grind : but I really do n't think that one of them has his exquisite quality of talent . It is in the matter of quantity that he has broken down . The bottle wo n't pour ; he turns it upside down ; it 's no use ! Sometimes he declares it 's empty - that he has done all he was made to do . This I consider great nonsense ; but I would nevertheless take him on his own terms if it was only I that was concerned . But I keep thinking of those two praying , trusting neighbors of yours , and I feel wretchedly like a swindler . If his working mood came but once in five years I would willingly wait for it and maintain him in leisure , if need be , in the intervals ; but that would be a sorry account to present to them . Five years of this sort of thing , moreover , would effectually settle the question . I wish he were less of a genius and more of a charlatan ! He 's too confoundedly all of one piece ; he wo n't throw overboard a grain of the cargo to save the rest . Fancy him thus with all his brilliant personal charm , his handsome head , his careless step , his look as of a nervous nineteenth - century Apollo , and you will understand that there is mighty little comfort in seeing him in a bad way . He was tolerably foolish last summer at Baden Baden , but he got on his feet , and for a while he was steady . Then he began to waver again , and at last toppled over . Now , literally , he 's lying prone . He came into my room last night , miserably tipsy . I assure you , it did n't amuse me ..... About Miss Light it 's a long story . She is one of the great beauties of all time , and worth coming barefoot to Rome , like the pilgrims of old , to see . Her complexion , her glance , her step , her dusky tresses , may have been seen before in a goddess , but never in a woman . And you may take this for truth , because I ' m not in love with her . On the contrary ! Her education has been simply infernal . She is corrupt , perverse , as proud as the queen of Sheba , and an appalling coquette ; but she is generous , and with patience and skill you may enlist her imagination in a good cause as well as in a bad one . The other day I tried to manipulate it a little . Chance offered me an interview to which it was possible to give a serious turn , and I boldly broke ground and begged her to suffer my poor friend to go in peace . After a good deal of finessing she consented , and the next day , with a single word , packed him off to Naples to drown his sorrow in debauchery . I have come to the conclusion that she is more dangerous in her virtuous moods than in her vicious ones , and that she probably has a way of turning her back which is the most provoking thing in the world . She 's an actress , she could n't forego doing the thing dramatically , and it was the dramatic touch that made it fatal . I wished her , of course , to let him down easily ; but she desired to have the curtain drop on an attitude , and her attitudes deprive inflammable young artists of their reason ..... Roderick made an admirable bust of her at the beginning of the winter , and a dozen women came rushing to him to be done , mutatis mutandis , in the same style . They were all great ladies and ready to take him by the hand , but he told them all their faces did n't interest him , and sent them away vowing his destruction . "
91126	91367	91119	91119	he	1904	" I unburdened myself the other day of this monstrous load of perplexity ; I think it did me good , and I let it stand . I was in a melancholy muddle , and I was trying to work myself free . You know I like discussion , in a quiet way , and there is no one with whom I can have it as quietly as with you , most sagacious of cousins ! There is an excellent old lady with whom I often chat , and who talks very much to the point . But Madame Grandoni has disliked Roderick from the first , and if I were to take her advice I would wash my hands of him . You will laugh at me for my long face , but you would do that in any circumstances . I am half ashamed of my letter , for I have a faith in my friend that is deeper than my doubts . He was here last evening , talking about the Naples Museum , the Aristides , the bronzes , the Pompeian frescoes , with such a beautiful intelligence that doubt of the ultimate future seemed blasphemy . I walked back to his lodging with him , and he was as mild as midsummer moonlight . He has the ineffable something that charms and convinces ; my last word about him shall not be a harsh one . "
91490	91500	91501	91501	he	186	" Something in the style of the Dying Gladiator ? "
91505	91509	91511	91511	Roderick	186	" Oh no , "
91514	91525	91511	91511	Roderick	186	" he 's not dying , he 's only drunk ! "
91526	91535	91536	91537	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" Ah , but intoxication , you know , "
91540	91557	91536	91537	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" is not a proper subject for sculpture . Sculpture should not deal with transitory attitudes . "
91558	91579	91511	91511	Roderick	186	" Lying dead drunk is not a transitory attitude ! Nothing is more permanent , more sculpturesque , more monumental ! "
91580	91585	91587	91588	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" An entertaining paradox , "
91590	91670	91587	91588	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" if we had time to exercise our wits upon it . I remember at Florence an intoxicated figure by Michael Angelo which seemed to me a deplorable aberration of a great mind . I myself touch liquor in no shape whatever . I have traveled through Europe on cold water . The most varied and attractive lists of wines are offered me , but I brush them aside . No cork has ever been drawn at my command ! "
91671	91688	91690	91690	Roderick	186	" The movement of drawing a cork calls into play a very pretty set of muscles , "
91692	91704	91690	91690	Roderick	186	" I think I will make a figure in that position . "
91705	91733	91735	91736	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" A Bacchus , realistically treated ! My dear young friend , never trifle with your lofty mission . Spotless marble should represent virtue , not vice ! "
91772	91780	91781	91781	he	269	" An ideal head , I presume , "
91785	91823	91781	91781	he	269	" a fanciful representation of one of the pagan goddesses - a Diana , a Flora , a naiad or dryad ? I often regret that our American artists should not boldly cast off that extinct nomenclature . "
91824	91834	91836	91836	Roderick	186	" She is neither a naiad nor a dryad , "
91838	91850	91836	91836	Roderick	186	" and her name is as good as yours or mine . "
91851	91855	91857	91858	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" You call her "
91862	91866	91867	91867	Rowland	281	" Miss Light , "
91873	92056	91836	91836	Roderick	186	" Ah , our great American beauty ! Not a pagan goddess - an American , Christian lady ! Yes , I have had the pleasure of conversing with Miss Light . Her conversational powers are not remarkable , but her beauty is of a high order . I observed her the other evening at a large party , where some of the proudest members of the European aristocracy were present - duchesses , princesses , countesses , and others distinguished by similar titles . But for beauty , grace , and elegance my fair countrywoman left them all nowhere . What women can compare with a truly refined American lady ? The duchesses the other night had no attractions for my eyes ; they looked coarse and sensual ! It seemed to me that the tyranny of class distinctions must indeed be terrible when such countenances could inspire admiration . You see more beautiful girls in an hour on Broadway than in the whole tour of Europe . Miss Light , now , on Broadway , would excite no particular remark . "
92057	92064	92066	92066	Roderick	186	" She has never been there ! "
92070	92091	91836	91836	Roderick	186	" I ' m afraid she never will be there . I suppose you have heard the news about her . "
92092	92096	92097	92097	Roderick	186	" What news ? "
92123	92435	92118	92118	he	186	" It 's the news of the hour , I believe . Miss Light is admired by the highest people here . They tacitly recognize her superiority . She has had offers of marriage from various great lords . I was extremely happy to learn this circumstance , and to know that they all had been left sighing . She has not been dazzled by their titles and their gilded coronets . She has judged them simply as men , and found them wanting . One of them , however , a young Neapolitan prince , I believe , has after a long probation succeeded in making himself acceptable . Miss Light has at last said yes , and the engagement has just been announced . I am not generally a retailer of gossip of this description , but the fact was alluded to an hour ago by a lady with whom I was conversing , and here , in Europe , these conversational trifles usurp the lion 's share of one 's attention . I therefore retained the circumstance . Yes , I regret that Miss Light should marry one of these used - up foreigners . Americans should stand by each other . If she wanted a brilliant match we could have fixed it for her . If she wanted a fine fellow - a fine , sharp , enterprising modern man - I would have undertaken to find him for her without going out of the city of New York . And if she wanted a big fortune , I would have found her twenty that she would have had hard work to spend : money down - not tied up in fever - stricken lands and worm - eaten villas ! What is the name of the young man ? Prince Castaway , or some such thing ! "
92472	92476	92477	92479	The young man	347	" conversational trifle . "
92492	92498	92499	92500	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" The position of woman , "
92504	92565	92499	92500	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" is certainly a very degraded one in these countries . I doubt whether a European princess can command the respect which in our country is exhibited toward the obscurest females . The civilization of a country should be measured by the deference shown to the weaker sex . Judged by that standard , where are they , over here ? "
92636	92643	92644	92644	he	269	" And now for our Culture ! "
92717	92730	92731	92731	he	269	" I can conscientiously express myself as gratified with the general conception , "
92734	92796	92731	92731	he	269	" The figure has considerable majesty , and the countenance wears a fine , open expression . The forehead , however , strikes me as not sufficiently intellectual . In a statue of Culture , you know , that should be the great point . The eye should instinctively seek the forehead . Could n't you heighten it up a little ? "
92811	92817	92818	92818	he	186	" Oblige me , sir , "
92821	92831	92818	92818	he	186	" oblige me ! Never mention that thing again . "
92832	92841	92731	92731	he	269	" Never mention it ? Why my dear sir "
92843	92853	92818	92818	he	186	" Never mention it . It 's an abomination ! "
92854	92861	92731	92731	he	269	" An abomination ! My Culture ! "
92862	92866	92868	92868	Roderick	186	" Yours indeed ! "
92870	92881	92868	92868	Roderick	186	" It 's none of mine . I disown it . "
92882	92890	92892	92893	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" Disown it , if you please , "
92896	92902	92892	92893	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" but finish it first ! "
92903	92910	92912	92912	Roderick	186	" I 'd rather smash it ! "
92914	92927	92892	92893	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" This is folly , sir . You must keep your engagements . "
92928	92964	92892	92893	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" I made no engagement . A sculptor is n't a tailor . Did you ever hear of inspiration ? Mine is dead ! And it 's no laughing matter . You yourself killed it . "
92965	92974	92976	92977	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" I - I - killed your inspiration ? "
92986	93016	92976	92977	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" You 're a very ungrateful boy ! If ever I encouraged and cheered and sustained any one , I ' m sure I have done so to you . "
93017	93047	92892	92893	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" I appreciate your good intentions , and I do n't wish to be uncivil . But your encouragement is - superfluous . I ca n't work for you ! "
93048	93059	93061	93062	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" I call this ill - humor , young man ! "
93073	93084	93085	93085	Roderick	186	" Oh , I ' m in an infernal humor ! "
93088	93104	92892	92893	Mr. Leavenworth	269	" Pray , sir , is it my infelicitous allusion to Miss Light 's marriage ? "
93105	93142	93165	93165	his	269	" It 's your infelicitous everything ! I do n't say that to offend you ; I beg your pardon if it does . I say it by way of making our rupture complete , irretrievable ! "
93155	93160	93161	93161	he	269	" Listen to me , "
93172	93254	93161	93161	he	269	" You are standing on the edge of a gulf . If you suffer anything that has passed to interrupt your work on that figure , you take your plunge . It 's no matter that you do n't like it ; you will do the wisest thing you ever did if you make that effort of will necessary for finishing it . Destroy the statue then , if you like , but make the effort . I speak the truth ! "
93268	93272	93273	93273	he	186	" You too ! "
93358	93368	93352	93352	Rowland	281	" You decline to think of what I urge ? "
93369	93372	93336	93336	Roderick	186	" Absolutely . "
93373	93395	93352	93352	Rowland	281	" There 's one more point - that you should n't , for a month , go to Mrs. Light 's . "
93396	93403	93336	93336	Roderick	186	" I go there this evening . "
93404	93412	93352	93352	Rowland	281	" That too is an utter folly . "
93413	93422	93336	93336	Roderick	186	" There are such things as necessary follies . "
93423	93435	93352	93352	Rowland	281	" You are not reflecting ; you are speaking in passion . "
93436	93445	93336	93336	Roderick	186	" Why then do you make me speak ? "
93451	93466	93446	93446	Rowland	281	" Is it also necessary that you should lose the best friend you have ? "
93471	93479	93467	93467	Roderick	186	" That 's for you to settle ! "
93721	93729	93730	93730	she	217	" They told me you were here , "
93740	93752	93754	93754	Rowland	281	" And yet you came in ? It is very brave , "
93756	93774	93817	93817	she	217	" You are the brave one , when one thinks of it ! Where is the padrona ? "
93775	93786	93848	93848	She	217	" Occupied for the moment . But she is coming . "
93787	93791	93817	93817	she	217	" How soon ? "
93792	93808	93848	93848	She	217	" I have already waited ten minutes ; I expect her from moment to moment . "
93809	93815	93817	93817	she	217	" Meanwhile we are alone ? "
93827	93832	93834	93834	Rowland	281	" Unless Stenterello counts , "
93836	93847	93848	93848	She	217	" Oh , he knows my secrets - unfortunate brute ! "
93866	93873	93874	93874	she	217	" Come ! say something pleasant ! "
93877	93889	93848	93848	She	217	" I have been very happy to hear of your engagement . "
93890	93939	93848	93848	She	217	" No , I do n't mean that . I have heard that so often , only since breakfast , that it has lost all sense . I mean some of those unexpected , charming things that you said to me a month ago at Saint Cecilia 's . "
93940	93947	93949	93949	Rowland	281	" I offended you , then , "
93951	93958	93949	93949	Rowland	281	" I was afraid I had . "
93959	93975	93848	93848	She	217	" Ah , it occurred to you ? Why have n't I seen you since ? "
93976	93984	93986	93986	he	1930	" Really , I do n't know . "
93994	94007	93986	93986	he	1930	" I have called , but you have never been at home . "
94008	94399	93848	93848	She	217	" You were careful to choose the wrong times . You have a way with a poor girl ! You sit down and inform her that she is a person with whom a respectable young man can not associate without contamination ; your friend is a very nice fellow , you are very careful of his morals , you wish him to know none but nice people , and you beg me therefore to desist . You request me to take these suggestions to heart and to act upon them as promptly as possible . They are not particularly flattering to my vanity . Vanity , however , is a sin , and I listen submissively , with an immense desire to be just . If I have many faults I know it , in a general way , and I try on the whole to do my best . ' Voyons , ' I say to myself , ' it is n't particularly charming to hear one 's self made out such a low person , but it is worth thinking over ; there 's probably a good deal of truth in it , and at any rate we must be as good a girl as we can . That 's the great point ! And then here 's a magnificent chance for humility . If there 's doubt in the matter , let the doubt count against one 's self . That is what Saint Catherine did , and Saint Theresa , and all the others , and they are said to have had in consequence the most ineffable joys . Let us go in for a little ineffable joy ! ' I tried it ; I swallowed my rising sobs , I made you my courtesy , I determined I would not be spiteful , nor passionate , nor vengeful , nor anything that is supposed to be particularly feminine . I was a better girl than you made out - better at least than you thought ; but I would let the difference go and do magnificently right , lest I should not do right enough . I thought of it a deal for six hours when I know I did n't seem to be , and then at last I did it ! Santo Dio ! "
94400	94411	94413	94413	Rowland	281	" My dear Miss Light , my dear Miss Light ! "
94417	94421	94422	94424	the young girl	659	" Since then , "
94428	94445	94422	94424	the young girl	659	" I have been waiting for the ineffable joys . They have n't yet turned up ! "
94446	94452	94453	94453	Rowland	281	" Pray listen to me ! "
94456	94477	94422	94424	the young girl	659	" Nothing , nothing , nothing has come of it . I have passed the dreariest month of my life ! "
94478	94492	94494	94494	Rowland	281	" My dear Miss Light , you are a very terrible young lady ! "
94496	94504	94422	94424	the young girl	659	" What do you mean by that ? "
94505	94528	94422	94424	the young girl	659	" A good many things . We 'll talk them over . But first , forgive me if I have offended you ! "
94547	94567	94541	94541	her	659	" That means nothing . Forgiveness is between equals , and you do n't regard me as your equal . "
94568	94576	94541	94541	her	659	" Really , I do n't understand ! "
94592	94600	94601	94601	she	192	" You do n't believe in me ! "
94604	94626	94601	94601	she	192	" not a grain ! I do n't know what I would not give to force you to believe in me ! "
94660	94669	94671	94671	Christina	192	" But you shall believe in me yet , "
94687	94716	94680	94681	Madame Grandoni	217	" I must give you a very solemn kiss , my dear ; you are the heroine of the hour . You have really accepted him , eh ? "
94717	94722	94680	94681	Madame Grandoni	217	" So they say ! "
94723	94731	94680	94681	Madame Grandoni	217	" But you ought to know best . "
94732	94743	94744	94744	She	192	" I do n't know - I do n't care ! "
94760	94769	94771	94773	the old lady	1935	" That 's a pretty state of mind , "
94775	94788	94771	94773	the old lady	1935	" for a young person who is going to become a princess . "
94794	94826	94789	94789	Christina	192	" Every one expects me to go into ecstacies over that ! Could anything be more vulgar ? They may chuckle by themselves ! Will you let me stay to dinner ? "
94827	94845	94891	94891	Christina	192	" If you can dine on a risotto . But I imagine you are expected at home . "
94846	94870	94789	94789	Christina	192	" You are right . Prince Casamassima dines there , en famille . But I ' m not in his family , yet ! "
94871	94890	94891	94891	Christina	192	" Do you know you are very wicked ? I have half a mind not to keep you . "
94898	94907	94908	94908	she	192	" I beg you will let me stay , "
94911	94945	94908	94908	she	192	" If you wish to cure me of my wickedness you must be very patient and kind with me . It will be worth the trouble . You must show confidence in me . "
94962	94973	94974	94974	she	192	" I do n't know what I ' m saying ! "
94977	94995	94974	94974	she	192	" I am weary , I am more lonely than ever , I wish I were dead ! "

96828	96833	96834	96834	Rowland	281	" He was here , "
96838	96867	96834	96834	Rowland	281	" here in this lovely garden , as he was once in Paradise , half an hour ago . But have no fear ; I drove him out . "
96896	96905	96907	96908	the friar	2006	" You have been tempted , my brother ? "
96912	96915	96821	96821	himself	2003	" Hideously ! "
96916	96925	96971	96972	The frate	2003	" And you have resisted - and conquered ! "
96926	96933	96821	96821	himself	2003	" I believe I have conquered . "
96934	96959	96971	96972	The frate	2003	" The blessed Saint Francis be praised ! It is well done . If you like , we will offer a mass for you . "
96960	96967	96969	96969	Rowland	281	" I am not a Catholic , "
96977	96985	96971	96972	The frate	2003	" That is a reason the more . "
96986	97003	97004	97004	Rowland	281	" But it 's for you , then , to choose . Shake hands with me , "
97007	97031	97004	97004	Rowland	281	" that will do as well ; and suffer me , as I go out , to stop a moment in your chapel . "
97162	97168	97169	97169	Rowland	281	" I went to Florence , "
97172	97203	97169	97169	Rowland	281	" and I thought of going farther ; but I came back on purpose to give you another piece of advice . Once more , you refuse to leave Rome ? "
97204	97207	97209	97209	Roderick	186	" Never ! "
97211	97250	97169	97169	Rowland	281	" The only chance that I see , then , of your reviving your sense of responsibility to - to those various sacred things you have forgotten , is in sending for your mother to join you here . "
97254	97259	97251	97251	Roderick	186	" For my mother ? "
97260	97270	97169	97169	Rowland	281	" For your mother - and for Miss Garland . "
97286	97295	97296	97296	he	186	" For Mary Garland - for my mother ? "
97299	97304	97296	97296	he	186	" Send for them ? "
97305	97332	97169	97169	Rowland	281	" Tell me this ; I have often wondered , but till now I have forborne to ask . You are still engaged to Miss Garland ? "
97340	97353	97169	97169	Rowland	281	" It would give you pleasure , then , to see her ? "
97364	97367	97368	97368	he	186	" Pleasure ! "
97375	97380	97368	97368	he	186	" Call it pain . "
97381	97390	97391	97391	Rowland	281	" I regard you as a sick man , "
97394	97411	97391	97391	Rowland	281	" In such a case Miss Garland would say that her place was at your side . "
97422	97431	97432	97432	he	186	" Is this a deep - laid snare ? "
97456	97461	97462	97462	he	186	" Heaven forgive you ! "
97466	97540	97462	97462	he	186	" My idea has been simply this . Try , in decency , to understand it . I have tried to befriend you , to help you , to inspire you with confidence , and I have failed . I took you from the hands of your mother and your betrothed , and it seemed to me my duty to restore you to their hands . That 's all I have to say . "
97622	97629	97630	97630	he	186	" I beg you to wait , "
97633	97646	97630	97630	he	186	" to forgive that shabby speech , and to let me reflect . "
97683	97689	97690	97690	he	186	" How strange it is , "
97693	97706	97690	97690	he	186	" that the simplest devices are the last that occur to one ! "
97715	97738	97708	97708	he	186	" To see Mary Garland is just what I want . And my mother - my mother ca n't hurt me now . "
97739	97746	97708	97708	he	186	" You will write , then ? "
97747	97768	97708	97708	he	186	" I will telegraph . They must come , at whatever cost . Striker can arrange it all for them . "
99591	99594	99587	99587	Rowland	281	" gifted , "
99896	99906	99907	99907	he	2073	" It behooves you to appreciate your good fortune , "
99912	99986	99907	99907	he	2073	" To be young and elastic , and yet old enough and wise enough to discriminate and reflect , and to come to Italy for the first time - that is one of the greatest pleasures that life offers us . It is but right to remind you of it , so that you make the most of opportunity and do not accuse yourself , later , of having wasted the precious season . "
100003	100010	100011	100011	she	182	" I expect to enjoy it , "
100014	100025	100011	100011	she	182	" Do n't be afraid ; I am not wasteful . "
100026	100038	100040	100041	Mrs. Hudson	191	" I am afraid we are not qualified , you know , "
100043	100211	100040	100041	Mrs. Hudson	191	" We are told that you must know so much , that you must have read so many books . Our taste has not been cultivated . When I was a young lady at school , I remember I had a medal , with a pink ribbon , for ' proficiency in Ancient History ' - the seven kings , or is it the seven hills ? and Quintus Curtius and Julius Caesar and - and that period , you know . I believe I have my medal somewhere in a drawer , now , but I have forgotten all about the kings . But after Roderick came to Italy we tried to learn something about it . Last winter Mary used to read ' Corinne ' to me in the evenings , and in the mornings she used to read another book , to herself . What was it , Mary , that book that was so long , you know , - in fifteen volumes ? "
100212	100220	100222	100222	Mary	193	" It was Sismondi 's Italian Republics , "
100236	100242	100243	100243	he	2075	" Did you finish it ? "
100246	100263	100040	100041	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Yes , and began another - a shorter one - Roscoe 's Leo the Tenth . "
100264	100271	100040	100041	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Did you find them interesting ? "
100272	100276	100040	100041	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Oh yes . "
100277	100283	100040	100041	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Do you like history ? "
100284	100289	100040	100041	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Some of it . "
100290	100304	100040	100041	Mrs. Hudson	191	" That 's a woman 's answer ! And do you like art ? "
100310	100317	100305	100305	She	193	" I have never seen it ! "
100318	100335	100337	100338	Mrs. Hudson	191	" You have great advantages , now , my dear , with Roderick and Mr. Mallet , "
100340	100406	100337	100338	Mrs. Hudson	191	" I am sure no young lady ever had such advantages . You come straight to the highest authorities . Roderick , I suppose , will show you the practice of art , and Mr. Mallet , perhaps , if he will be so good , will show you the theory . As an artist 's wife , you ought to know something about it . "
100407	100422	100424	100424	Rowland	281	" One learns a good deal about it , here , by simply living , "
100426	100437	100424	100424	Rowland	281	" by going and coming about one 's daily avocations . "
100438	100456	100458	100459	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Dear , dear , how wonderful that we should be here in the midst of it ! "
100461	100515	100458	100459	Mrs. Hudson	191	" To think of art being out there in the streets ! We did n't see much of it last evening , as we drove from the depot . But the streets were so dark and we were so frightened ! But we are very easy now ; are n't we , Mary ? "
100516	100522	100524	100524	Mary	193	" I am very happy , "
100586	100595	100596	100596	she	281	" I wish to tell you , sir , "
100599	100675	100596	100596	she	281	" how very grateful - how very thankful - what a happy mother I am ! I feel as if I owed it all to you , sir . To find my poor boy so handsome , so prosperous , so elegant , so famous - and ever to have doubted of you ! What must you think of me ? You 're our guardian angel , sir . I often say so to Mary . "
100849	100853	100855	100855	Rowland	281	" Strange enough , "
100857	100868	100855	100855	Rowland	281	" he may seem to her , if he will ! "
100902	100906	100907	100907	Rowland	281	" Good heavens ! "
100912	100920	100907	100907	Rowland	281	" is he already tired of them ? "
100921	100939	100940	100940	Roderick	186	" To - morrow , of course , we must begin to put you through the mill , "
100946	100964	100940	100940	Roderick	186	" And be it hereby known to Mallet that we count upon him to turn the wheel . "
100965	100976	100978	100979	Mrs. Hudson	191	" I will do as you please , my son , "
100981	101011	100978	100979	Mrs. Hudson	191	" So long as I have you with me I do n't care where I go . We must not take up too much of Mr. Mallet 's time . "
101012	101066	100940	100940	Roderick	186	" His time is inexhaustible ; he has nothing under the sun to do . Have you , Rowland ? If you had seen the big hole I have been making in it ! Where will you go first ? You have your choice - from the Scala Santa to the Cloaca Maxima . "
101067	101075	101077	101077	Rowland	281	" Let us take things in order , "
101079	101103	101077	101077	Rowland	281	" We will go first to Saint Peter 's . Miss Garland , I hope you are impatient to see Saint Peter 's . "
101104	101116	101118	101119	Miss Garland	182	" I would like to go first to Roderick 's studio , "
101121	101129	101131	101131	Roderick	186	" It 's a very nasty place , "
101133	101138	101131	101131	Roderick	186	" At your pleasure ! "
101139	101157	101159	101160	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Yes , we must see your beautiful things before we can look contentedly at anything else , "
101162	101169	101171	101171	Roderick	186	" I have no beautiful things , "
101173	101188	101171	101171	Roderick	186	" You may see what there is ! What makes you look so odd ? "
101217	101225	101227	101227	Roderick	186	" No , it 's your face , "
101229	101245	101227	101227	Roderick	186	" What has happened to it these two years ? It has changed its expression . "
101246	101255	101257	101258	Miss Garland	182	" Your mother has prayed a great deal , "
101262	101307	101309	101309	Rowland	281	" I did n't suppose , of course , it was from doing anything bad ! It makes you a very good face - very interesting , very solemn . It has very fine lines in it ; something might be done with it . "
101328	101335	101336	101336	she	651	" My son , my son , "
101341	101348	101336	101336	she	651	" I do n't understand you . "
101361	101372	101373	101373	he	186	" I suppose a man may admire his own mother ! "
101376	101414	101373	101373	he	186	" If you please , madame , you 'll sit to me for that head . I see it , I see it ! I will make something that a queen ca n't get done for her . "
101876	101886	101887	101887	he	2094	" Well , what do you think of Europe ? "
101892	101899	101900	101900	she	182	" I think it 's horrible ! "
101904	101907	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" Horrible ? "
101908	101919	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" I feel so strangely - I could almost cry . "
101920	101928	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" How is it that you feel ? "
101929	101952	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" So sorry for the poor past , that seems to have died here , in my heart , in an hour ! "
101953	101966	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" But , surely , you 're pleased - you 're interested . "
101967	102029	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" I am overwhelmed . Here in a single hour , everything is changed . It is as if a wall in my mind had been knocked down at a stroke . Before me lies an immense new world , and it makes the old one , the poor little narrow , familiar one I have always known , seem pitiful . "
102030	102063	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" But you did n't come to Rome to keep your eyes fastened on that narrow little world . Forget it , turn your back on it , and enjoy all this . "
102064	102137	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" I want to enjoy it ; but as I sat here just now , looking up at that golden mist in the dome , I seemed to see in it the vague shapes of certain people and things at home . To enjoy , as you say , as these things demand of one to enjoy them , is to break with one 's past . And breaking is a pain ! "
102138	102165	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" Do n't mind the pain , and it will cease to trouble you . Enjoy , enjoy ; it is your duty . Yours especially ! "
102166	102171	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" Why mine especially ? "
102172	102201	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" Because I am very sure that you have a mind capable of doing the most liberal justice to everything interesting and beautiful . You are extremely intelligent . "
102202	102208	102210	102211	Miss Garland	182	" You do n't know , "
102215	102266	101868	101869	Miss Garland	182	" In that matter one feels . I really think that I know better than you . I do n't want to seem patronizing , but I suspect that your mind is susceptible of a great development . Give it the best company , trust it , let it go ! "
102285	102291	102292	102292	she	182	" But what you say , "
102297	102301	102292	102292	she	182	" means change ! "
102302	102308	102310	102310	Rowland	281	" Change for the better ! "
102312	102336	102337	102337	she	182	" How can one tell ? As one stands , one knows the worst . It seems to me very frightful to develop , "
102345	102390	102341	102341	her	182	" One is in for it in one way or another , and one might as well do it with a good grace as with a bad ! Since one ca n't escape life , it is better to take it by the hand . "
102391	102399	102400	102400	she	182	" Is this what you call life ? "
102403	102413	102341	102341	her	182	" What do you mean by ' this ' ? "
102414	102436	102341	102341	her	182	" Saint Peter 's - all this splendor , all Rome - pictures , ruins , statues , beggars , monks . "
102437	102473	102341	102341	her	182	" It is not all of it , but it is a large part of it . All these things are impregnated with life ; they are the fruits of an old and complex civilization . "
102474	102490	102341	102341	her	182	" An old and complex civilization : I am afraid I do n't like that . "
102491	102565	102341	102341	her	182	" Do n't conclude on that point just yet . Wait till you have tested it . While you wait , you will see an immense number of very beautiful things - things that you are made to understand . They wo n't leave you as they found you ; then you can judge . Do n't tell me I know nothing about your understanding . I have a right to assume it . "
102575	102584	102585	102585	she	182	" I am not sure I understand that , "
102588	102604	102606	102606	Rowland	281	" I hope , at least , that at a cursory glance it pleases you , "
102608	102631	102606	102606	Rowland	281	" You need n't be afraid to tell the truth . What strikes some people is that it is so remarkably small . "
102632	102653	102654	102654	she	182	" Oh , it 's large enough ; it 's very wonderful . There are things in Rome , then , "
102666	102674	102654	102654	she	182	" that are very , very beautiful ? "
102675	102680	102606	102606	Rowland	281	" Lots of them . "
102681	102692	102654	102654	she	182	" Some of the most beautiful things in the world ? "
102693	102696	102606	102606	Rowland	281	" Unquestionably . "
102697	102708	102654	102654	she	182	" What are they ? which things have most beauty ? "
102709	102722	102606	102606	Rowland	281	" That is according to taste . I should say the statues . "
102723	102744	102654	102654	she	182	" How long will it take to see them all ? to know , at least , something about them ? "
102745	102790	102606	102606	Rowland	281	" You can see them all , as far as mere seeing goes , in a fortnight . But to know them is a thing for one 's leisure . The more time you spend among them , the more you care for them . "
102800	102824	102796	102796	he	2112	" Why should you grudge time ? It 's all in your way , since you are to be an artist 's wife . "
102825	102832	102833	102833	she	182	" I have thought of that , "
102836	102856	102833	102833	she	182	" It may be that I shall always live here , among the most beautiful things in the world ! "
102857	102871	102654	102654	she	182	" Very possibly ! I should like to see you ten years hence . "
102872	102890	102833	102833	she	182	" I dare say I shall seem greatly altered . But I am sure of one thing . "
102891	102895	102654	102654	she	182	" Of what ? "
102896	102972	102833	102833	she	182	" That for the most part I shall be quite the same . I ask nothing better than to believe the fine things you say about my understanding , but even if they are true , it wo n't matter . I shall be what I was made , what I am now - a young woman from the country ! The fruit of a civilization not old and complex , but new and simple . "
102973	102987	102654	102654	she	182	" I am delighted to hear it : that 's an excellent foundation . "
102988	103013	102833	102833	she	182	" Perhaps , if you show me anything more , you will not always think so kindly of it . Therefore I warn you . "
103014	103050	102654	102654	she	182	" I am not frightened . I should like vastly to say something to you : Be what you are , be what you choose ; but do , sometimes , as I tell you . "
103109	103114	103115	103115	she	191	" Mary , dear , "
103164	103164	103156	103156	Roderick	186	"
103173	103187	103188	103188	he	186	" It 's sublimer than anything that your religion asks you to do ! "
103191	103202	103204	103205	Miss Garland	182	" Surely our religion sometimes gives us very difficult duties , "
103207	103276	103277	103277	he	186	" The duty of sitting in a whitewashed meeting - house and listening to a nasal Puritan ! I admit that 's difficult . But it 's not sublime . I am speaking of ceremonies , of forms . It is in my line , you know , to make much of forms . I think this is a very beautiful one . Could n't you do it ? "
103297	103302	103285	103285	She	343	" I think not ! "
103303	103307	103294	103294	her	343	" Why not ? "
103308	103318	103285	103285	She	343	" I do n't know ; I could n't ! "
103380	103384	103385	103385	she	191	" After that , "
103388	103413	103385	103385	she	191	" I suppose he thinks he is as good as any one ! And here is another . Oh , what a beautiful person ! "
103548	103553	103554	103554	she	193	" You told me , "
103561	103582	103554	103554	she	193	" that Rome contained some of the most beautiful things in the world . This surely is one of them ! "
103708	103715	103717	103718	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Why , Roderick knows her ! "
103727	103736	103717	103718	Mrs. Hudson	191	" I supposed she was some great princess . "
103737	103743	103745	103745	Rowland	281	" She is - almost ! "
103747	103764	103745	103745	Rowland	281	" She is the most beautiful girl in Europe , and Roderick has made her bust . "
103765	103773	103775	103776	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Her bust ? Dear , dear ! "
103781	103787	103775	103776	Mrs. Hudson	191	" What a strange bonnet ! "
103788	103795	103797	103797	Mary	193	" She has very strange eyes , "
103854	103861	103863	103864	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Think of it , Mary ! "
103866	103881	103863	103864	Mrs. Hudson	191	" What splendid people he must know ! No wonder he found Northampton dull ! "
103882	103891	103893	103893	Mary	193	" I like the poor little old gentleman , "
103895	103903	103904	103904	Rowland	281	" Why do you call him poor ? "
103912	103917	103918	103918	she	281	" He seems so ! "
103945	103953	103955	103956	his mother	448	" So you are acquainted with princesses ! "
103966	103974	103976	103976	Roderick	186	" Miss Light is not a princess ! "
103980	103987	103989	103990	Mrs. Hudson	191	" But Mr. Mallet says so , "
103995	104005	104007	104007	Rowland	281	" I meant that she was going to be ! "
104009	104024	104025	104025	Roderick	186	" It 's by no means certain that she is even going to be ! "
104028	104031	104033	104033	Rowland	281	" Ah , "
104035	104041	104033	104033	Rowland	281	" I give it up ! "
104895	104897	104906	104906	Rowland	281	" nature "
105121	105128	105130	105130	Rowland	281	" Oh exquisite virtue of circumstance ! "
105134	105167	105132	105132	himself	281	" that takes us by the hand and leads us forth out of corners where , perforce , our attitudes are a trifle contracted , and beguiles us into testing mistrusted faculties ! "
105220	105224	105185	105185	he	2173	" A superior woman "
105679	105685	105686	105686	she	193	" I am so glad , "
105689	105700	105686	105686	she	193	" that Roderick is a sculptor and not a painter . "
105726	105736	105737	105737	she	193	" It 's not that painting is not fine , "
105740	105752	105737	105737	she	193	" but that sculpture is finer . It is more manly . "
105824	105830	105831	105831	she	193	" It appears , then , "
105834	105846	105831	105831	she	193	" that , after all , one can grow at home ! "
105847	105874	105814	105814	He	2195	" Unquestionably , if one has a motive . Your growth , then , was unconscious ? You did not watch yourself and water your roots ? "
105883	105890	105891	105891	she	193	" I am willing to grant , "
105894	105931	105891	105891	she	193	" that Europe is more delightful than I supposed ; and I do n't think that , mentally , I had been stingy . But you must admit that America is better than you have supposed . "
105932	105947	105948	105948	Rowland	281	" I have not a fault to find with the country which produced you ! "
105957	105977	105948	105948	Rowland	281	" And yet you want me to change - to assimilate Europe , I suppose you would call it . "
105978	106042	105948	105948	Rowland	281	" I have felt that desire only on general principles . Shall I tell you what I feel now ? America has made you thus far ; let America finish you ! I should like to ship you back without delay and see what becomes of you . That sounds unkind , and I admit there is a cold intellectual curiosity in it . "
106048	106065	106043	106043	She	281	" The charm is broken ; the thread is snapped ! I prefer to remain here . "
106118	106195	106109	106109	he	2197	" At this she colored a little , and he said that in default of any larger confidence it would at least be a satisfaction to make her confess to that charge . But even this satisfaction she denied him , and his only revenge was in making , two or three times afterward , a softly ironical allusion to her slyness . He told her that she was what is called in French a sournoise . "
106199	106206	106109	106109	he	2197	" she answered , almost indifferently , "
106228	106228	106220	106220	you	2197	"
106284	106292	106293	106293	he	2197	" You are always snatching at information , "
106296	106307	106293	106293	he	2197	" you will never consent to have any disinterested conversation . "
106343	106353	106354	106354	she	281	" One must make hay while the sun shines , "
106357	106387	106354	106354	she	281	" I must lay up a store of learning against dark days . Somehow , my imagination refuses to compass the idea that I may be in Rome indefinitely . "
106444	106456	106428	106428	she	281	" Say then that I am laying up resources for solitude ! "
106613	106622	106623	106623	she	281	" You are singularly inconsistent , Mr. Mallet , "
106626	106629	106585	106585	she	281	" How ? "
106630	106698	106585	106585	she	281	" That first day that we were in Saint Peter 's you said things that inspired me . You bade me plunge into all this . I was all ready ; I only wanted a little push ; yours was a great one ; here I am in mid - ocean ! And now , as a reward for my bravery , you have repeatedly snubbed me . "
106699	106704	106706	106706	Rowland	281	" Distinctly , then , "
106708	106715	106706	106706	Rowland	281	" I strike you as inconsistent ? "
106716	106722	106585	106585	she	281	" That is the word . "
106723	106733	106706	106706	Rowland	281	" Then I have played my part very ill . "
106734	106747	106585	106585	she	281	" Your part ? What is your part supposed to have been ? "
106753	106762	106748	106748	He	2202	" That of usefulness , pure and simple . "
106763	106770	106771	106771	she	2203	" I do n't understand you ! "
106810	106815	106816	106816	he	2202	" Do you remember , "
106819	106844	106816	106816	he	2202	" my begging you , the other day , to do occasionally as I told you ? It seemed to me you tacitly consented . "
106845	106849	106789	106789	he	2202	" Very tacitly . "
106850	106906	106816	106816	he	2202	" I have never yet really presumed on your consent . But now I would like you to do this : whenever you catch me in the act of what you call inconsistency , ask me the meaning of some architectural term . I will know what you mean ; a word to the wise ! "
107130	107133	107134	107134	she	281	" Everything , "
107223	107223	107209	107209	they	2224	"
107224	107228	107469	107469	Rowland	281	" What work ? "
107229	107255	107209	107209	they	2224	" I would open a school for those beautiful little beggars ; though I am sadly afraid I should never bring myself to scold them . "
107256	107261	107263	107263	Rowland	281	" I am idle , "
107265	107276	107263	107263	Rowland	281	" and yet I have kept up a certain spirit . "
107277	107285	107286	107286	she	281	" I do n't call you idle , "
107291	107309	107209	107209	they	2224	" It is very good of you . Do you remember our talking about that in Northampton ? "
107310	107332	107209	107209	they	2224	" During that picnic ? Perfectly . Has your coming abroad succeeded , for yourself , as well as you hoped ? "
107333	107350	107209	107209	they	2224	" I think I may say that it has turned out as well as I expected . "
107351	107356	107209	107209	they	2224	" Are you happy ? "
107357	107364	107209	107209	they	2224	" Do n't I look so ? "
107365	107373	107376	107376	she	281	" So it seems to me . But "
107381	107394	107376	107376	she	281	" I imagine you look happy whether you are so or not . "
107395	107420	107209	107209	they	2224	" I ' m like that ancient comic mask that we saw just now in yonder excavated fresco : I am made to grin . "
107421	107430	107376	107376	she	281	" Shall you come back here next winter ? "
107431	107435	107209	107209	they	2224	" Very probably . "
107436	107443	107376	107376	she	281	" Are you settled here forever ? "
107444	107461	107209	107209	they	2224	" ' Forever ' is a long time . I live only from year to year . "
107462	107468	107376	107376	she	281	" Shall you never marry ? "
107474	107497	107469	107469	Rowland	281	" ' Forever ' - ' never ! ' You handle large ideas . I have not taken a vow of celibacy . "
107498	107506	107209	107209	they	2224	" Would n't you like to marry ? "
107507	107514	107469	107469	Rowland	281	" I should like it immensely . "
107527	107536	107524	107524	she	281	" Why do n't you write a book ? "
107545	107555	107537	107537	Rowland	281	" A book ! What book should I write ? "
107556	107566	107537	107537	Rowland	281	" A history ; something about art or antiquities . "
107567	107577	107537	107537	Rowland	281	" I have neither the learning nor the talent . "
107594	107602	107603	107603	she	281	" You ought , at any rate , "
107609	107616	107603	107603	she	281	" to do something for yourself . "
107617	107635	107537	107537	Rowland	281	" For myself ? I should have supposed that if ever a man seemed to live for himself "
107637	107646	107647	107647	she	281	" I do n't know how it seems , "
107650	107673	107647	107647	she	281	" to careless observers . But we know - we know that you have lived - a great deal - for us . "
107691	107701	107703	107703	Rowland	281	" She has had that speech on her conscience , "
107735	107735	107736	107736	She	281	"
107752	107803	107736	107736	She	281	" You ought to be made to know very well what we all feel . Mrs. Hudson tells me that she has told you what she feels . Of course Roderick has expressed himself . I have been wanting to thank you too ; I do , from my heart . "
108395	108401	108402	108402	he	2226	" And it 's magnificent ! "
108405	108417	108402	108402	he	2226	" It 's one of the best things I have done . "
108418	108423	108425	108425	Rowland	281	" I believe it , "
108427	108439	108425	108425	Rowland	281	" Never again talk to me about your inspiration being dead . "
108440	108490	108491	108491	He	2226	" Why not ? This may be its last kick ! I feel very tired . But it 's a masterpiece , though I do say it . They tell us we owe so much to our parents . Well , I ' ve paid the filial debt handsomely ! "
108512	108523	108524	108524	he	2226	" There 's one thing more I want to say , "
108528	108539	108540	108540	He	2226	" I feel as if I ought to tell you ! "
108554	108561	108540	108540	He	2226	" Your invention is a failure ! "
108562	108566	108567	108567	Rowland	281	" My invention ? "
108570	108578	108540	108540	He	2226	" Bringing out my mother and Mary . "
108579	108583	108540	108540	He	2226	" A failure ? "
108584	108596	108540	108540	He	2226	" It 's no use ! They do n't help me . "
108621	108626	108627	108627	Roderick	186	" They bore me ! "
108631	108636	108638	108638	Rowland	281	" Oh , oh ! "
108640	108645	108647	108647	Roderick	186	" Listen , listen ! "
108652	108679	108647	108647	Roderick	186	" I am not complaining of them ; I am simply stating a fact . I am very sorry for them ; I am greatly disappointed . "
108680	108689	108627	108627	Roderick	186	" Have you given them a fair trial ? "
108690	108706	108647	108647	Roderick	186	" Should n't you say so ? It seems to me I have behaved beautifully . "
108707	108723	108627	108627	Roderick	186	" You have done very well ; I have been building great hopes on it . "
108724	108796	108647	108647	Roderick	186	" I have done too well , then . After the first forty - eight hours my own hopes collapsed . But I determined to fight it out ; to stand within the temple ; to let the spirit of the Lord descend ! Do you want to know the result ? Another week of it , and I shall begin to hate them . I shall want to poison them . "
108797	108801	108803	108803	Rowland	281	" Miserable boy ! "
108805	108813	108803	108803	Rowland	281	" They are the loveliest of women ! "
108814	108833	108647	108647	Roderick	186	" Very likely ! But they mean no more to me than a Bible text to an atheist ! "
108834	108839	108841	108841	Rowland	281	" I utterly fail , "
108847	108856	108841	108841	Rowland	281	" to understand your relation to Miss Garland . "
108870	108880	108863	108863	his	186	" She adores me ! That 's my relation . "
108886	108893	108918	108918	Roderick	186	" Have you broken your engagement ? "
108894	108907	108918	108918	Roderick	186	" Broken it ? You ca n't break a ray of moonshine . "
108908	108917	108918	108918	Roderick	186	" Have you absolutely no affection for her ? "
108932	108939	108940	108940	he	186	" Dead - dead - dead ! "
108945	108949	108950	108950	Rowland	281	" I wonder , "
108954	108977	108950	108950	Rowland	281	" if you begin to comprehend the beauty of Miss Garland 's character . She is a person of the highest merit . "
108978	108990	108918	108918	Roderick	186	" Evidently - or I would not have cared for her ! "
108991	109000	108950	108950	Rowland	281	" Has that no charm for you now ? "
109001	109014	108918	108918	Roderick	186	" Oh , do n't force a fellow to say rude things ! "
109015	109033	108950	108950	Rowland	281	" Well , I can only say that you do n't know what you are giving up . "
109040	109048	109034	109034	Roderick	186	" Do you know , so well ? "
109049	109055	108918	108918	Roderick	186	" I admire her immeasurably . "
109065	109072	109056	109056	Roderick	186	" You have not wasted time . "
109162	109171	109348	109348	Rowland	281	" For her sake - for her sake , "
109182	109193	109194	109194	he	186	" I do n't know what I would n't do , "
109197	109206	109194	109194	he	186	" rather than that Miss Garland should suffer . "
109207	109216	109217	109217	Roderick	186	" There is one thing to be said , "
109221	109227	109217	109217	Roderick	186	" She is very strong . "
109228	109256	109194	109194	he	186	" Well , then , if she 's strong , believe that with a longer chance , a better chance , she will still regain your affection . "
109257	109265	109267	109267	Roderick	186	" Do you know what you ask ? "
109269	109278	109267	109267	Roderick	186	" Make love to a girl I hate ? "
109279	109283	109194	109194	he	186	" You hate ? "
109284	109294	109267	109267	Roderick	186	" As her lover , I should hate her ! "
109295	109300	109302	109302	Rowland	281	" Listen to me ! "
109306	109347	109267	109267	Roderick	186	" No , listen you to me ! Do you really urge my marrying a woman who would bore me to death ? I would let her know it in very good season , and then where would she be ? "
109364	109381	109348	109348	Rowland	281	" Go your way , then ! Say all this to her , not to me ! "
109382	109399	109348	109348	Rowland	281	" To her ? I am afraid of her ; I want you to help me . "
109400	109405	109407	109407	Rowland	281	" My dear Roderick , "
109413	109421	109407	109407	Rowland	281	" I can help you no more ! "
109435	109440	109441	109441	he	186	" Oh , well , "
109444	109456	109441	109441	he	186	" I am not so afraid of her as all that ! "
109466	109469	109471	109471	Rowland	281	" Stop ! "
109493	109593	109489	109489	his	186	" Come back ; sit down there and listen to me . Of anything you were to say in your present state of mind you would live most bitterly to repent . You do n't know what you really think ; you do n't know what you really feel . You do n't know your own mind ; you do n't do justice to Miss Garland . All this is impossible here , under these circumstances . You 're blind , you 're deaf , you 're under a spell . To break it , you must leave Rome . "
109594	109606	109717	109717	he	606	" Leave Rome ! Rome was never so dear to me . "
109607	109620	109489	109489	his	186	" That 's not of the smallest consequence . Leave it instantly . "
109621	109628	109717	109717	he	606	" And where shall I go ? "
109629	109646	109489	109489	his	186	" Go to some place where you may be alone with your mother and Miss Garland . "
109647	109655	109717	109717	he	606	" Alone ? You will not come ? "
109656	109668	109489	109489	his	186	" Oh , if you desire it , I will come . "
109682	109689	109690	109690	he	186	" I do n't understand you , "
109693	109710	109690	109690	he	186	" I wish you liked Miss Garland either a little less , or a little more . "
109726	109734	109735	109735	he	606	" You ask me to help you , "
109739	109804	109735	109735	he	606	" On these present conditions I can do nothing . But if you will postpone all decision as to the continuance of your engagement a couple of months longer , and meanwhile leave Rome , leave Italy , I will do what I can to ' help you , ' as you say , in the event of your still wishing to break it . "
109805	109864	109717	109717	he	606	" I must do without your help then ! Your conditions are impossible . I will leave Rome at the time I have always intended - at the end of June . My rooms and my mother 's are taken till then ; all my arrangements are made accordingly . Then , I will depart ; not before . "
109865	109871	109873	109873	Rowland	281	" You are not frank , "
109875	109889	109873	109873	Rowland	281	" Your real reason for staying has nothing to do with your rooms . "
109899	109936	109937	109937	he	186	" If I ' m not frank , it 's for the first time in my life . Since you know so much about my real reason , let me hear it ! No , stop ! "
109941	109992	109937	109937	he	186	" I wo n't trouble you . You are right , I have a motive . On the twenty - fourth of June Miss Light is to be married . I take an immense interest in all that concerns her , and I wish to be present at her wedding . "
109993	110017	109873	109873	Rowland	281	" But you said the other day at Saint Peter 's that it was by no means certain her marriage would take place . "
110018	110035	109937	109937	he	186	" Apparently I was wrong : the invitations , I am told , are going out . "
110062	110078	110079	110079	he	186	" If I offer no further opposition to your waiting for Miss Light 's marriage , "
110082	110116	110079	110079	he	186	" will you promise , meanwhile and afterwards , for a certain period , to defer to my judgment - to say nothing that may be a cause of suffering to Miss Garland ? "
110117	110126	110127	110127	Roderick	186	" For a certain period ? What period ? "
110130	110175	110079	110079	he	186	" Ah , do n't drive so close a bargain ! Do n't you understand that I have taken you away from her , that I suffer in every nerve in consequence , and that I must do what I can to restore you ? "
110176	110184	110186	110186	Roderick	186	" Do what you can , then , "
110194	110200	110201	110201	His	186	" Do what you can ! "
110276	110289	110290	110290	he	186	" I am told our high - flying friend has come down , "
110293	110304	110290	110290	he	186	" He has been doing a queer little old woman . "
110305	110312	110313	110313	Rowland	281	" A queer little old woman ! "
110316	110327	110313	110313	Rowland	281	" My dear sir , she is Hudson 's mother . "
110328	110349	110313	110313	Rowland	281	" All the more reason for her being queer ! It is a bust for terra - cotta , eh ? "
110350	110360	110313	110313	Rowland	281	" By no means ; it is for marble . "
110361	110410	110313	110313	Rowland	281	" That 's a pity . It was described to me as a charming piece of quaintness : a little demure , thin - lipped old lady , with her head on one side , and the prettiest wrinkles in the world - a sort of fairy godmother . "
110411	110422	110424	110424	Rowland	281	" Go and see it , and judge for yourself , "
110426	110466	110313	110313	Rowland	281	" No , I see I shall be disappointed . It 's quite the other thing , the sort of thing they put into the campo - santos . I wish that boy would listen to me an hour ! "
110653	110659	110661	110662	the sculptor	524	" I give it up ! "
110666	110673	110661	110662	the sculptor	524	" I do n't understand it . "
110674	110680	110682	110682	Rowland	281	" But you like it ? "
110684	110699	110700	110700	he	186	" Like it ? It 's a pearl of pearls . Tell me this , "
110703	110719	110721	110721	he	186	" is he very fond of his mother ; is he a very good son ? "
110728	110735	110737	110737	Rowland	281	" Why , she adores him , "
110741	110829	110830	110830	he	186	" That 's not an answer ! But it 's none of my business . Only if I , in his place , being suspected of having - what shall I call it ? - a cold heart , managed to do that piece of work , oh , oh ! I should be called a pretty lot of names . Charlatan , poseur , arrangeur ! But he can do as he chooses ! My dear young man , I know you do n't like me , "
110839	110862	110830	110830	he	186	" It 's a pity ; you are strong enough not to care about me at all . You are very strong . "
110863	110868	110870	110870	Roderick	186	" Not at all , "
110873	110879	110870	110870	Roderick	186	" I am very weak ! "
110880	110903	110830	110830	he	186	" I told you last year that you would n't keep it up . I was a great ass . You will ! "
110904	110914	110916	110916	Roderick	186	" I beg your pardon - I wo n't ! "
110918	110974	110830	110830	he	186	" Though I ' m a great ass , all the same , eh ? Well , call me what you will , so long as you turn out this sort of thing ! I do n't suppose it makes any particular difference , but I should like to say now I believe in you . "
111085	111093	111094	111094	he	318	" What 's the matter with him ? "
111110	111116	111099	111099	Rowland	281	" Genius , I suppose . "
111131	111150	111151	111151	he	318	" Well , it 's deuced perfect , it 's deuced simple ; I do believe in him ! "
111154	111170	111171	111171	he	318	" But I ' m glad I ' m not a genius . It makes , "
111196	111204	111171	111171	he	318	" it makes a more sociable studio . "
111404	111416	111417	111417	she	217	" At one moment you tell me the girl is plain , "
111420	111456	111417	111417	she	217	" the next you tell me she 's pretty . I will invite them , and I shall see for myself . But one thing is very clear : you are in love with her . "
111473	111478	111479	111479	she	217	" More than that , "
111482	111551	111479	111479	she	217	" you have been in love with her these two years . There was that certain something about you ! ... I knew you were a mild , sweet fellow , but you had a touch of it more than was natural . Why did n't you tell me at once ? You would have saved me a great deal of trouble . And poor Augusta Blanchard too ! "
111625	111634	111636	111637	his hostess	372	" But you did not find it so ! "
111639	111729	111636	111637	his hostess	372	" It was a matter of course , perhaps , that Mr. Leavenworth , who seems to be going about Europe with the sole view of picking up furniture for his ' home , ' as he calls it , should think Miss Blanchard a very handsome piece ; but it was not a matter of course - or it need n't have been - that she should be willing to become a sort of superior table - ornament . She would have accepted you if you had tried . "
111730	111737	111739	111739	Rowland	281	" You are supposing the insupposable , "
111741	111751	111739	111739	Rowland	281	" She never gave me a particle of encouragement . "
111752	111783	111636	111637	his hostess	372	" What would you have had her do ? The poor girl did her best , and I am sure that when she accepted Mr. Leavenworth she thought of you . "
111784	111796	111739	111739	Rowland	281	" She thought of the pleasure her marriage would give me . "
111797	111887	111636	111637	his hostess	372	" Ay , pleasure indeed ! She is a thoroughly good girl , but she has her little grain of feminine spite , like the rest . Well , he 's richer than you , and she will have what she wants ; but before I forgive you I must wait and see this new arrival - what do you call her ? - Miss Garland . If I like her , I will forgive you ; if I do n't , I shall always bear you a grudge . "
111933	111938	111940	111941	Madame Grandoni	217	" Well , then , "
111943	112004	111940	111941	Madame Grandoni	217	" if I like her , we 'll have it that you ought to be in love with her . If you fail in this , it will be a double misdemeanor . The man she 's engaged to does n't care a straw for her . Leave me alone and I 'll tell her what I think of you . "
112098	112109	112110	112110	she	2272	" It is what they call a marriage of reason , "
112114	112126	112110	112110	she	2272	" That means , you know , a marriage of madness ! "
112127	112138	112139	112139	Rowland	281	" What have you said in the way of advice ? "
112142	112405	112110	112110	she	2272	" Very little , but that little has favored the prince . I know nothing of the mysteries of the young lady 's heart . It may be a gold - mine , but at any rate it 's a mine , and it 's a long journey down into it . But the marriage in itself is an excellent marriage . It 's not only brilliant , but it 's safe . I think Christina is quite capable of making it a means of misery ; but there is no position that would be sacred to her . Casamassima is an irreproachable young man ; there is nothing against him but that he is a prince . It is not often , I fancy , that a prince has been put through his paces at this rate . No one knows the wedding - day ; the cards of invitation have been printed half a dozen times over , with a different date ; each time Christina has destroyed them . There are people in Rome who are furious at the delay ; they want to get away ; they are in a dreadful fright about the fever , but they are dying to see the wedding , and if the day were fixed , they would make their arrangements to wait for it . I think it very possible that after having kept them a month and produced a dozen cases of malaria , Christina will be married at midnight by an old friar , with simply the legal witnesses . "
112406	112420	112560	112560	Rowland	281	" It is true , then , that she has become a Catholic ? "
112421	112559	112110	112110	she	2272	" So she tells me . One day she got up in the depths of despair ; at her wit 's end , I suppose , in other words , for a new sensation . Suddenly it occurred to her that the Catholic church might after all hold the key , might give her what she wanted ! She sent for a priest ; he happened to be a clever man , and he contrived to interest her . She put on a black dress and a black lace veil , and looking handsomer than ever she rustled into the Catholic church . The prince , who is very devout , and who had her heresy sorely on his conscience , was thrown into an ecstasy . May she never have a caprice that pleases him less ! "
112595	112603	112604	112604	he	2274	" The girl is so deucedly dramatic , "
112607	112683	112604	112604	he	2274	" that I do n't know what coup de theatre she may have in store for us . Such a stroke was her turning Catholic ; such a stroke would be her some day making her courtesy to a disappointed world as Princess Casamassima , married at midnight , in her bonnet . She might do - she may do - something that would make even more starers ! I ' m prepared for anything . "
112684	112697	112560	112560	Rowland	281	" You mean that she might elope with your sculptor , eh ? "
112698	112706	112604	112604	he	2274	" I ' m prepared for anything ! "
112707	112716	112560	112560	Rowland	281	" Do you mean that he 's ready ? "
112717	112725	112604	112604	he	2274	" Do you think that she is ? "
112726	112912	112560	112560	Rowland	281	" They 're a precious pair ! I think this . You by no means exhaust the subject when you say that Christina is dramatic . It 's my belief that in the course of her life she will do a certain number of things from pure disinterested passion . She 's immeasurably proud , and if that is often a fault in a virtuous person , it may be a merit in a vicious one . She needs to think well of herself ; she knows a fine character , easily , when she meets one ; she hates to suffer by comparison , even though the comparison is made by herself alone ; and when the estimate she may have made of herself grows vague , she needs to do something to give it definite , impressive form . What she will do in such a case will be better or worse , according to her opportunity ; but I imagine it will generally be something that will drive her mother to despair ; something of the sort usually termed ' unworldly . ' "
112940	112949	112950	112950	he	2275	" She has bothered me half to death , "
112953	112988	112950	112950	he	2275	" but somehow I ca n't manage , as I ought , to hate her . I admire her , half the time , and a good part of the rest I pity her . "
112989	112997	112999	113000	Madame Grandoni	217	" I think I most pity her ! "
113074	113083	113084	113084	she	2276	" To think of her being a foreigner ! "
113103	113110	113084	113084	she	2276	" Then in a little while , "
113142	113145	113146	113146	She	2276	" Or , "
113164	113167	113169	113169	you	2278	" Or , "
113200	113203	113194	113194	I	0	" Or , "
113231	113824	113221	113221	she	2276	" Rowland also received a summons to Madame Grandoni 's tea - drinking , and went betimes , as he had been requested . He was eagerly desirous to lend his mute applause to Mary Garland 's debut in the Roman social world . The two ladies had arrived , with Roderick , silent and careless , in attendance . Miss Blanchard was also present , escorted by Mr. Leavenworth , and the party was completed by a dozen artists of both sexes and various nationalities . It was a friendly and easy assembly , like all Madame Grandoni 's parties , and in the course of the evening there was some excellent music . People played and sang for Madame Grandoni , on easy terms , who , elsewhere , were not to be heard for the asking . She was herself a superior musician , and singers found it a privilege to perform to her accompaniment . Rowland talked to various persons , but for the first time in his life his attention visibly wandered ; he could not keep his eyes off Mary Garland . Madame Grandoni had said that he sometimes spoke of her as pretty and sometimes as plain ; to - night , if he had had occasion to describe her appearance , he would have called her beautiful . She was dressed more than he had ever seen her ; it was becoming , and gave her a deeper color and an ampler presence . Two or three persons were introduced to her who were apparently witty people , for she sat listening to them with her brilliant natural smile . Rowland , from an opposite corner , reflected that he had never varied in his appreciation of Miss Blanchard 's classic contour , but that somehow , to - night , it impressed him hardly more than an effigy stamped upon a coin of low value . Roderick could not be accused of rancor , for he had approached Mr. Leavenworth with unstudied familiarity , and , lounging against the wall , with hands in pockets , was discoursing to him with candid serenity . Now that he had done him an impertinence , he evidently found him less intolerable . Mr. Leavenworth stood stirring his tea and silently opening and shutting his mouth , without looking at the young sculptor , like a large , drowsy dog snapping at flies . Rowland had found it disagreeable to be told Miss Blanchard would have married him for the asking , and he would have felt some embarrassment in going to speak to her if his modesty had not found incredulity so easy . The facile side of a union with Miss Blanchard had never been present to his mind ; it had struck him as a thing , in all ways , to be compassed with a great effort . He had half an hour 's talk with her ; a farewell talk , as it seemed to him - a farewell not to a real illusion , but to the idea that for him , in that matter , there could ever be an acceptable pis - aller . He congratulated Miss Blanchard upon her engagement , and she received his compliment with a touch of primness . But she was always a trifle prim , even when she was quoting Mrs. Browning and George Sand , and this harmless defect did not prevent her responding on this occasion that Mr. Leavenworth had a "
113828	113911	113221	113221	she	2276	" Rowland wished to manifest an extreme regard , but toward the end of the talk his zeal relaxed , and he fell a - thinking that a certain natural ease in a woman was the most delightful thing in the world . There was Christina Light , who had too much , and here was Miss Blanchard , who had too little , and there was Mary Garland in whom the quality was wholly uncultivated , who had just the right amount .
113929	113938	113939	113939	she	217	" I will make you an excellent cup , "
113942	113949	113939	113939	she	217	" because I have forgiven you . "
114008	114015	114017	114018	Madame Grandoni	217	" She is a lovely girl , "
114020	114048	114017	114018	Madame Grandoni	217	" There is a great deal there . I have taken a great fancy to her , and she must let me make a friend of her . "
114049	114055	114057	114057	Rowland	281	" She is very plain , "
114061	114068	114057	114057	Rowland	281	" very simple , very ignorant . "
114069	114100	114017	114018	Madame Grandoni	217	" Which , being interpreted , means , ' She is very handsome , very subtle , and has read hundreds of volumes on winter evenings in the country . ' "
114101	114108	114110	114110	Rowland	281	" You are a veritable sorceress , "
114112	114118	114110	114110	Rowland	281	" you frighten me away ! "
114158	114164	114166	114167	Madame Grandoni	217	" There is the sorceress ! "
114169	114177	114179	114179	she	217	" The sorceress and her necromantic poodle ! "
114261	114267	114269	114269	Christina	192	" I had no idea , "
114275	114504	114269	114269	Christina	192	" that you had such a lot of grand people , or I would not have come in . The servant said nothing ; he took me for an invitee . I came to spend a neighborly half - hour ; you know I have n't many left ! It was too dismally dreary at home . I hoped I should find you alone , and I brought Stenterello to play with the cat . I do n't know that if I had known about all this I would have dared to come in ; but since I ' ve stumbled into the midst of it , I beg you 'll let me stay . I am not dressed , but am I very hideous ? I will sit in a corner and no one will notice me . My dear , sweet lady , do let me stay . Pray , why did n't you ask me ? I never have been to a little party like this . They must be very charming . No dancing - tea and conversation ? No tea , thank you ; but if you could spare a biscuit for Stenterello ; a sweet biscuit , please . Really , why did n't you ask me ? Do you have these things often ? Madame Grandoni , it 's very unkind ! "
114541	114545	114546	114546	she	659	" I see , "
114550	114591	114546	114546	she	659	" I do very well for balls and great banquets , but when people wish to have a cosy , friendly , comfortable evening , they leave me out , with the big flower - pots and the gilt candlesticks . "
114592	114606	114608	114609	Madame Grandoni	217	" I ' m sure you 're welcome to stay , my dear , "
114611	114688	114608	114609	Madame Grandoni	217	" and at the risk of displeasing you I must confess that if I did n't invite you , it was because you 're too grand . Your dress will do very well , with its fifty flounces , and there is no need of your going into a corner . Indeed , since you 're here , I propose to have the glory of it . You must remain where my people can see you . "
114689	114723	114734	114734	her	2292	" They are evidently determined to do that by the way they stare . Do they think I intend to dance a tarantella ? Who are they all ; do I know them ? "
114914	114921	114922	114922	she	2292	" Tell me about these people , "
114927	115032	114922	114922	she	2292	" I had no idea there were so many people in Rome I had not seen . What are they all talking about ? It 's all beyond me , I suppose . There is Miss Blanchard , sitting as usual in profile against a dark object . She is like a head on a postage - stamp . And there is that nice little old lady in black , Mrs. Hudson . What a dear little woman for a mother ! Comme elle est proprette ! And the other , the fiancee , of course she 's here . Ah , I see ! "
115059	115069	115070	115070	she	2292	" I should like so much to know her ! "
115078	115130	115070	115070	she	2292	" She has a charming face ; I am sure she 's an angel . I wish very much you would introduce me . No , on second thoughts , I had rather you did n't . I will speak to her bravely myself , as a friend of her cousin . "
115607	115613	115614	115614	he	186	" How many more metamorphoses , "
115618	115630	115614	115614	he	186	" am I to be treated to before we have done ? "
115631	115638	115640	115640	Christina	192	" I want to tell you , "
115642	115658	115640	115640	Christina	192	" I have taken an immense fancy to Miss Garland . Are n't you glad ? "
115659	115662	115665	115665	Rowland	281	" Delighted ! "
115667	115676	115677	115677	she	192	" Ah , you do n't believe it , "
115683	115691	115640	115640	Christina	192	" Is it so hard to believe ? "
115692	115860	115640	115640	Christina	192	" Not that people in general should admire her , but that I should . But I want to tell you ; I want to tell some one , and I ca n't tell Miss Garland herself . She thinks me already a horrid false creature , and if I were to express to her frankly what I think of her , I should simply disgust her . She would be quite right ; she has repose , and from that point of view I and my doings must seem monstrous . Unfortunately , I have n't repose . I am trembling now ; if I could ask you to feel my arm , you would see ! But I want to tell you that I admire Miss Garland more than any of the people who call themselves her friends - except of course you . Oh , I know that ! To begin with , she is extremely handsome , and she does n't know it . "
115861	115869	115871	115871	Rowland	281	" She is not generally thought handsome , "
115873	115996	115640	115640	Christina	192	" Evidently ! That 's the vulgarity of the human mind . Her head has great character , great natural style . If a woman is not to be a supreme beauty in the regular way , she will choose , if she 's wise , to look like that . She 'll not be thought pretty by people in general , and desecrated , as she passes , by the stare of every vile wretch who chooses to thrust his nose under her bonnet ; but a certain number of superior people will find it one of the delightful things of life to look at her . That lot is as good as another ! Then she has a beautiful character ! "
115997	116004	116006	116006	Rowland	281	" You found that out soon ! "
116010	116061	115640	115640	Christina	192	" How long did it take you ? I found it out before I ever spoke to her . I met her the other day in Saint Peter 's ; I knew it then . I knew it - do you want to know how long I have known it ? "
116062	116065	116067	116067	Rowland	281	" Really , "
116069	116080	116067	116067	Rowland	281	" I did n't mean to cross - examine you . "
116081	116139	115640	115640	Christina	192	" Do you remember mamma 's ball in December ? We had some talk and you then mentioned her - not by name . You said but three words , but I saw you admired her , and I knew that if you admired her she must have a beautiful character . That 's what you require ! "
116140	116145	116147	116147	Rowland	281	" Upon my word , "
116149	116158	116147	116147	Rowland	281	" you make three words go very far ! "
116159	116170	115640	115640	Christina	192	" Oh , Mr. Hudson has also spoken of her . "
116171	116178	116180	116180	Rowland	281	" Ah , that 's better ! "
116182	116194	115640	115640	Christina	192	" I do n't know ; he does n't like her . "
116195	116202	115640	115640	Christina	192	" Did he tell you so ? "
116232	116235	116236	116236	she	192	" No ! "
116241	116295	116236	116236	she	192	" That would have been dishonorable , would n't it ? But I know it from my knowledge of him . He does n't like perfection ; he is not bent upon being safe , in his likings ; he 's willing to risk something ! Poor fellow , he risks too much ! "
116374	116386	116387	116387	she	192	" I do her justice . I do her full justice , "
116395	116450	116387	116387	she	192	" I like to say that , I like to be able to say it . She 's full of intelligence and courage and devotion . She does n't do me a grain of justice ; but that is no harm . There is something so fine in the aversions of a good woman ! "
116451	116461	116463	116463	Rowland	281	" If you would give Miss Garland a chance , "
116465	116478	116463	116463	Rowland	281	" I am sure she would be glad to be your friend . "
116479	116522	116523	116523	Christina	192	" What do you mean by a chance ? She has only to take it . I told her I liked her immensely , and she frowned as if I had said something disgusting . She looks very handsome when she frowns . "
116539	116547	116548	116548	she	192	" I do n't often like women , "
116552	116724	116725	116725	She	2314	" In fact I generally detest them . But I should like to know Miss Garland well . I should like to have a friendship with her ; I have never had one ; they must be very delightful . But I sha n't have one now , either - not if she can help it ! Ask her what she thinks of me ; see what she will say . I do n't want to know ; keep it to yourself . It 's too sad . So we go through life . It 's fatality - that 's what they call it , is n't it ? We please the people we do n't care for , we displease those we do ! But I appreciate her , I do her justice ; that 's the more important thing . It 's because I have imagination . She has none . Never mind ; it 's her only fault . I do her justice ; I understand very well . "
116783	116791	116792	116792	she	2314	" Yes , I do her justice , "
116795	116811	116792	116792	she	2314	" And you do her more ; you would lay down your life for her . "
116855	116862	116864	116865	Madame Grandoni	217	" That was a happy accident ! "
116867	116882	116864	116865	Madame Grandoni	217	" She never looked so beautiful , and she made my little party brilliant . "
116883	116888	116889	116889	Rowland	281	" Beautiful , verily ! "
116892	116899	116889	116889	Rowland	281	" But it was no accident . "
116900	116907	116889	116889	Rowland	281	" What was it , then ? "
116908	116929	116889	116889	Rowland	281	" It was a plan . She wished to see Miss Garland . She knew she was to be here . "
116930	116934	116889	116889	Rowland	281	" How so ? "
116935	116941	116889	116889	Rowland	281	" By Roderick , evidently . "
116942	116953	116889	116889	Rowland	281	" And why did she wish to see Miss Garland ? "
116954	116963	116889	116889	Rowland	281	" Heaven knows ! I give it up ! "
116964	116971	116973	116974	Madame Grandoni	217	" Ah , the wicked girl ! "
116976	116979	116981	116981	Rowland	281	" No , "
116983	116995	116981	116981	Rowland	281	" do n't say that now . She 's too beautiful . "
116996	117007	116889	116889	Rowland	281	" Oh , you men ! The best of you ! "
117008	117013	117015	117015	Rowland	281	" Well , then , "
117023	117023	116889	116889	Rowland	281	"
117284	117291	117292	117292	she	182	" I do n't like her ! "
117297	117305	117277	117277	she	182	" What do you think of her ? "
117306	117313	117277	117277	she	182	" I think she 's false . "
117329	117340	117341	117341	Rowland	281	" But she wished to please you ; she tried , "
117348	117359	117341	117341	Rowland	281	" I think not . She wished to please herself ! "
117636	117643	117644	117644	she	193	" A propos of Miss Light , "
117647	117654	117644	117644	she	193	" do you know her well ? "
117655	117669	117703	117703	she	193	" I can hardly say that . But I have seen her repeatedly . "
117670	117676	117644	117644	she	193	" Do you like her ? "
117677	117690	117703	117703	she	193	" Yes and no . I think I am sorry for her . "
117707	117714	117703	117703	she	193	" Sorry for her ? Why ? "
117715	117722	117644	117644	she	193	" Well - she is unhappy . "
117723	117729	117703	117703	she	193	" What are her misfortunes ? "
117730	117748	117644	117644	she	193	" Well - she has a horrible mother , and she has had a most injurious education . "
117759	117766	117767	117767	she	182	" Is n't she very beautiful ? "
117770	117777	117703	117703	she	193	" Do n't you think so ? "
117778	117794	117703	117703	she	193	" That 's measured by what men think ! She is extremely clever , too . "
117795	117800	117703	117703	she	193	" Oh , incontestably . "
117801	117807	117703	117703	she	193	" She has beautiful dresses . "
117808	117816	117703	117703	she	193	" Yes , any number of them . "
117817	117822	117703	117703	she	193	" And beautiful manners . "
117823	117828	117703	117703	she	193	" Yes - sometimes . "
117829	117835	117703	117703	she	193	" And plenty of money . "
117836	117842	117703	117703	she	193	" Money enough , apparently . "
117843	117850	117703	117703	she	193	" And she receives great admiration . "
117851	117855	117703	117703	she	193	" Very true . "
117856	117865	117703	117703	she	193	" And she is to marry a prince . "
117866	117871	117703	117703	she	193	" So they say . "
117890	117895	117896	117896	she	182	" Poor Miss Light ! "
118046	118064	118065	118065	he	1279	" You have more than once done me the honor to invite me to call upon you , "
118068	118098	118065	118065	he	1279	" I am ashamed of my long delay , and I can only say to you , frankly , that my time this winter has not been my own . "
118111	118117	118099	118099	Rowland	281	" Better late than never , "
118233	118238	118239	118242	the little old man	3487	" I must confess , "
118245	118294	118239	118242	the little old man	3487	" that even now I come on business not of my own - or my own , at least , only in a secondary sense . I have been dispatched as an ambassador , an envoy extraordinary , I may say , by my dear friend Mrs. Light . "
118295	118314	118315	118315	Rowland	281	" If I can in any way be of service to Mrs. Light , I shall be happy , "
118318	118341	118369	118370	the Cavaliere	1279	" Well then , dear sir , Casa Light is in commotion . The signora is in trouble - in terrible trouble . "
118373	118394	118369	118370	the Cavaliere	1279	" Miss Light has committed a great crime ; she has plunged a dagger into the heart of her mother . "
118395	118399	118401	118401	Rowland	281	" A dagger ! "
118416	118428	118411	118411	his	1279	" I speak figuratively . She has broken off her marriage . "
118429	118434	118411	118411	his	1279	" Broken it off ? "
118435	118447	118453	118453	he	1279	" Short ! She has turned the prince from the door . "
118651	118654	118656	118656	she	192	" dangerous , "
118711	118718	118719	118719	he	1279	" But I am not surprised , "
118722	118728	118703	118703	Giacosa	255	" You are not surprised ? "
118729	118742	118703	118703	Giacosa	255	" With Miss Light everything is possible . Is n't that true ? "
118766	118773	118774	118774	he	1279	" It was a magnificent marriage , "
118779	118793	118774	118774	he	1279	" I do not respect many people , but I respect Prince Casamassima . "
118794	118808	118810	118810	Rowland	281	" I should judge him indeed to be a very honorable young man , "
118812	118864	118774	118774	he	1279	" Eh , young as he is , he 's made of the old stuff . And now , perhaps he 's blowing his brains out . He is the last of his house ; it 's a great house . But Miss Light will have put an end to it ! "
118865	118875	118876	118876	Rowland	281	" Is that the view she takes of it ? "
118904	118913	118914	118914	he	1279	" You have observed Miss Light with attention , "
118917	118953	118914	118914	he	1279	" and this brings me to my errand . Mrs. Light has a high opinion of your wisdom , of your kindness , and she has reason to believe you have influence with her daughter . "
118954	118965	118876	118876	Rowland	281	" I - with her daughter ? Not a grain ! "
118966	119005	118914	118914	he	1279	" That is possibly your modesty . Mrs. Light believes that something may yet be done , and that Christina will listen to you . She begs you to come and see her before it is too late . "
119006	119021	119022	119022	Rowland	281	" But all this , my dear Cavaliere , is none of my business , "
119025	119044	119022	119022	Rowland	281	" I ca n't possibly , in such a matter , take the responsibility of advising Miss Light . "
119067	119070	119071	119071	he	255	" Unfortunately , "
119090	119090	119071	119071	he	255	"
119091	119098	119099	119099	Rowland	281	" And a fatally foolish mother ! "
119133	119165	119113	119113	he	255	" Eh , signore , such as she is , the mother appeals to you . A very handsome woman - disheveled , in tears , in despair , in dishabille ! "
119207	119212	119214	119215	the Cavaliere	1279	" I must add , "
119217	119234	119214	119215	the Cavaliere	1279	" that Mrs. Light desires also to speak to you on the subject of Mr. Hudson . "
119235	119252	119290	119291	The Cavaliere	255	" She considers Mr. Hudson , then , connected with this step of her daughter 's ? "
119253	119264	119214	119215	the Cavaliere	1279	" Intimately . He must be got out of Rome . "
119265	119289	119290	119291	The Cavaliere	255	" Mrs. Light , then , must get an order from the Pope to remove him . It 's not in my power . "
119296	119334	119290	119291	The Cavaliere	255	" Mrs. Light is equally helpless . She would leave Rome to - morrow , but Christina will not budge . An order from the Pope would do nothing . A bull in council would do nothing . "
119335	119343	119345	119345	Rowland	281	" She 's a remarkable young lady , "
119358	119365	119351	119352	the Cavaliere	1279	" She has a great spirit . "
119412	119437	119409	119409	Giacosa	255	" But if the marriage can be saved , it must be saved . It 's a beautiful marriage . It will be saved . "
119438	119449	119409	119409	Giacosa	255	" Notwithstanding Miss Light 's great spirit to the contrary ? "
119450	119465	119409	119409	Giacosa	255	" Miss Light , notwithstanding her great spirit , will call Prince Casamassima back . "
119466	119471	119473	119473	Rowland	281	" Heaven grant it ! "
119475	119481	119483	119484	the Cavaliere	1279	" I do n't know , "
119488	119499	119483	119484	the Cavaliere	1279	" that heaven will have much to do with it . "
119668	119674	119675	119675	she	191	" In pity 's name , "
119678	119701	119675	119675	she	191	" what is the matter with my boy ? If he is ill , I entreat you to take me to him ! "
119702	119712	119714	119714	Rowland	281	" He is not ill , to my knowledge , "
119716	119722	119714	119714	Rowland	281	" What have you there ? "
119723	119762	119675	119675	she	191	" A note - a dreadful note . He tells us we are not to see him for a week . If I could only go to his room ! But I am afraid , I am afraid ! "
119763	119789	119714	119714	Rowland	281	" I imagine there is no need of going to his room . What is the occasion , may I ask , of his note ? "
119790	119859	119675	119675	she	191	" He was to have gone with us on this drive to - what is the place ? - to Cervara . You know it was arranged yesterday morning . In the evening he was to have dined with us . But he never came , and this morning arrives this awful thing . Oh dear , I ' m so excited ! Would you mind reading it ? "
119873	119881	119882	119882	they	2364	" I can not go to Cervara , "
119885	119922	119882	119882	they	2364	" I have something else to do . This will occupy me perhaps for a week , and you 'll not see me . Do n't miss me - learn not to miss me . R. H. "
119923	119929	119930	119930	Rowland	281	" Why , it means , "
119933	119958	119930	119930	Rowland	281	" that he has taken up a piece of work , and that it is all - absorbing . That 's very good news . "
120007	120016	120018	120019	Mrs. Hudson	191	" He does not work in the evening , "
120021	120069	120018	120019	Mrs. Hudson	191	" Ca n't he come for five minutes ? Why does he write such a cruel , cold note to his poor mother - to poor Mary ? What have we done that he acts so strangely ? It 's this wicked , infectious , heathenish place ! "
120085	120092	120093	120093	she	182	" Oh , dear Mr. Mallet , "
120097	120111	120093	120093	she	182	" I am sure he has the fever and he 's already delirious ! "
120112	120122	120124	120125	Miss Garland	182	" I am very sure it 's not that , "
120204	120217	120187	120187	he	2367	" Dearest friends , I abdicate : I ca n't help you ! "
120240	120248	120249	120249	he	2367	" I will see what it is ! "
120430	120440	120441	120441	he	2367	" Your mother was greatly alarmed at your note , "
120444	120462	120441	120441	he	2367	" and I came to satisfy myself that , as I believed , you are not ill . "
120547	120556	120557	120557	he	186	" Oh , I ' m not ill , "
120562	120569	120557	120557	he	186	" I have never been better . "
120570	120580	120581	120581	Rowland	281	" Your note , nevertheless , and your absence , "
120584	120604	120581	120581	Rowland	281	" have very naturally alarmed your mother . I advise you to go to her directly and reassure her . "
120605	120628	120630	120630	he	186	" Go to her ? Going to her would be worse than staying away . Staying away at present is a kindness . "
120644	120655	120630	120630	he	186	" My presence , in fact , would be indecent . "
120656	120662	120557	120557	he	186	" Indecent ? Pray explain . "
120663	120712	120630	120630	he	186	" Why , you see , as regards Mary Garland . I am divinely happy ! Does n't it strike you ? You ought to agree with me . You wish me to spare her feelings ; I spare them by staying away . Last night I heard something "
120714	120721	120723	120723	Rowland	281	" I heard it , too , "
120727	120749	120723	120723	Rowland	281	" And it 's in honor of this piece of news that you have taken to your bed in this fashion ? "
120750	120762	120557	120557	he	186	" Extremes meet ! I ca n't get up for joy . "
120763	120780	120723	120723	Rowland	281	" May I inquire how you heard your joyous news ? - from Miss Light herself ? "
120781	120802	120557	120557	he	186	" By no means . It was brought me by her maid , who is in my service as well . "
120803	120817	120723	120723	Rowland	281	" Casamassima 's loss , then , is to a certainty your gain ? "
120818	120871	120557	120557	he	186	" I do n't talk about certainties . I do n't want to be arrogant , I do n't want to offend the immortal gods . I ' m keeping very quiet , but I ca n't help being happy . I shall wait a while ; I shall bide my time . "
120872	120876	120723	120723	Rowland	281	" And then ? "
120877	120901	120557	120557	he	186	" And then that transcendent girl will confess to me that when she threw overboard her prince she remembered that I adored her ! "
120902	120910	120918	120918	Rowland	281	" I feel bound to tell you , "
120925	120938	120918	120918	Rowland	281	" that I am now on my way to Mrs. Light 's . "
120939	120948	120949	120949	Roderick	186	" I congratulate you , I envy you ! "
120954	121005	120557	120557	he	186	" Mrs. Light has sent for me to remonstrate with her daughter , with whom she has taken it into her head that I have influence . I do n't know to what extent I shall remonstrate , but I give you notice I shall not speak in your interest . "
121020	121025	121026	121026	he	186	" Pray do n't ! "
121030	121044	120918	120918	Rowland	281	" You deserve I should tell her you are a very shabby fellow . "
121045	121069	120918	120918	Rowland	281	" My dear Rowland , the comfort with you is that I can trust you . You 're incapable of doing anything disloyal . "
121070	121100	120918	120918	Rowland	281	" You mean to lie here , then , smelling your roses and nursing your visions , and leaving your mother and Miss Garland to fall ill with anxiety ? "
121101	121193	120918	120918	Rowland	281	" Can I go and flaunt my felicity in their faces ? Wait till I get used to it a trifle . I have done them a palpable wrong , but I can at least forbear to add insult to injury . I may be an arrant fool , but , for the moment , I have taken it into my head to be prodigiously pleased . I should n't be able to conceal it ; my pleasure would offend them ; so I lock myself up as a dangerous character . "
121194	121216	121217	121217	Roderick	186	" Well , I can only say , ' May your pleasure never grow less , or your danger greater ! ' "
121229	121236	121217	121217	Roderick	186	" God 's will be done ! "
121353	121365	121366	121366	she	2376	" Speak to her , plead with her , command her ! "
121375	121408	121366	121366	she	2376	" She 'll not heed us , no more than if we were a pair of clocks a - ticking . Perhaps she will listen to you ; she always liked you . "
121409	121415	121417	121417	Rowland	281	" She always disliked me , "
121419	121452	121417	121417	Rowland	281	" But that does n't matter now . I have come here simply because you sent for me , not because I can help you . I can not advise your daughter . "
121453	121478	121479	121481	the poor woman	3820	" Oh , cruel , deadly man ! You must advise her ; you sha n't leave this house till you have advised her ! "
121485	121884	121479	121481	the poor woman	3820	" Look at me in my misery and refuse to help me ! Oh , you need n't be afraid , I know I ' m a fright , I have n't an idea what I have on . If this goes on , we may both as well turn scarecrows . If ever a woman was desperate , frantic , heart - broken , I am that woman . I ca n't begin to tell you . To have nourished a serpent , sir , all these years ! to have lavished one 's self upon a viper that turns and stings her own poor mother ! To have toiled and prayed , to have pushed and struggled , to have eaten the bread of bitterness , and all the rest of it , sir - and at the end of all things to find myself at this pass . It ca n't be , it 's too cruel , such things do n't happen , the Lord do n't allow it . I ' m a religious woman , sir , and the Lord knows all about me . With his own hand he had given me his reward ! I would have lain down in the dust and let her walk over me ; I would have given her the eyes out of my head , if she had taken a fancy to them . No , she 's a cruel , wicked , heartless , unnatural girl ! I speak to you , Mr. Mallet , in my dire distress , as to my only friend . There is n't a creature here that I can look to - not one of them all that I have faith in . But I always admired you . I said to Christina the first time I saw you that there at last was a real gentleman . Come , do n't disappoint me now ! I feel so terribly alone , you see ; I feel what a nasty , hard , heartless world it is that has come and devoured my dinners and danced to my fiddles , and yet that has n't a word to throw to me in my agony ! Oh , the money , alone , that I have put into this thing , would melt the heart of a Turk ! "
121928	121938	121939	121939	Rowland	281	" I have it at heart to tell you , "
121942	121950	121939	121939	Rowland	281	" that if you consider my friend Hudson "
121963	122041	121958	121958	her	253	" Oh , it 's not that . She told me last night to bother her no longer with Hudson , Hudson ! She did n't care a button for Hudson . I almost wish she did ; then perhaps one might understand it . But she does n't care for anything in the wide world , except to do her own hard , wicked will , and to crush me and shame me with her cruelty . "
122042	122047	122049	122049	Rowland	281	" Ah , then , "
122051	122104	122049	122049	Rowland	281	" I am as much at sea as you , and my presence here is an impertinence . I should like to say three words to Miss Light on my own account . But I must absolutely and inexorably decline to urge the cause of Prince Casamassima . This is simply impossible . "
122112	122611	122105	122106	Mrs. Light	253	" Because the poor boy is a prince , eh ? because he 's of a great family , and has an income of millions , eh ? That 's why you grudge him and hate him . I knew there were vulgar people of that way of feeling , but I did n't expect it of you . Make an effort , Mr. Mallet ; rise to the occasion ; forgive the poor fellow his splendor . Be just , be reasonable ! It 's not his fault , and it 's not mine . He 's the best , the kindest young man in the world , and the most correct and moral and virtuous ! If he were standing here in rags , I would say it all the same . The man first - the money afterwards : that was always my motto , and always will be . What do you take me for ? Do you suppose I would give Christina to a vicious person ? do you suppose I would sacrifice my precious child , little comfort as I have in her , to a man against whose character one word could be breathed ? Casamassima is only too good , he 's a saint of saints , he 's stupidly good ! There is n't such another in the length and breadth of Europe . What he has been through in this house , not a common peasant would endure . Christina has treated him as you would n't treat a dog . He has been insulted , outraged , persecuted ! He has been driven hither and thither till he did n't know where he was . He has stood there where you stand - there , with his name and his millions and his devotion - as white as your handkerchief , with hot tears in his eyes , and me ready to go down on my knees to him and say , ' My own sweet prince , I could kiss the ground you tread on , but it is n't decent that I should allow you to enter my house and expose yourself to these horrors again . ' And he would come back , and he would come back , and go through it all again , and take all that was given him , and only want the girl the more ! I was his confidant ; I know everything . He used to beg my forgiveness for Christina . What do you say to that ? I seized him once and kissed him , I did ! To find that and to find all the rest with it , and to believe it was a gift straight from the pitying angels of heaven , and then to see it dashed away before your eyes and to stand here helpless - oh , it 's a fate I hope you may ever be spared ! "
122612	122634	122636	122636	Rowland	281	" It would seem , then , that in the interest of Prince Casamassima himself I ought to refuse to interfere , "
122681	122687	122688	122688	she	253	" Very good , sir , "
122691	122769	122688	122688	she	253	" I ' m sorry your heart is not so tender as your conscience . My compliments to your conscience ! It must give you great happiness . Heaven help me ! Since you fail us , we are indeed driven to the wall . But I have fought my own battles before , and I have never lost courage , and I do n't see why I should break down now . Cavaliere , come here ! "
122791	122800	122801	122802	Mrs. Light	253	" Mr. Mallet refuses to say a word , "
122806	122854	122801	122802	Mrs. Light	253	" Time presses , every moment is precious . Heaven knows what that poor boy may be doing . If at this moment a clever woman should get hold of him she might be as ugly as she pleased ! It 's horrible to think of it . "
122972	122979	122980	122981	the Cavaliere	1279	" If you could bring yourself , "
122993	123054	122980	122981	the Cavaliere	1279	" to address a few words of solemn remonstrance to Miss Light , you would , perhaps , do more for us than you know . You would save several persons a great pain . The dear signora , first , and then Christina herself . Christina in particular . Me too , I might take the liberty to add ! "
123177	123196	123164	123165	The Cavaliere	1279	" Do you wish to know the truth ? You are the only man whose words she remembers . "
123205	123213	123214	123214	he	347	" I will say what I can ! "
123249	123254	123255	123255	she	253	" If you fail , "
123259	123272	123255	123255	she	253	" we have something else ! But please to lose no time . "
123367	123380	123381	123382	her mother	369	" You will be so good as to listen to Mr. Mallet , "
123390	123421	123381	123382	her mother	369	" and to reflect carefully upon what he says . I suppose you will admit that he is disinterested . In half an hour you shall hear from me again ! "
123540	123550	123551	123551	she	192	" Why have you come here at this time ? "
123554	123578	123643	123643	she	192	" Your mother sent for me in pressing terms , and I was very glad to have an opportunity to speak to you . "
123579	123592	123643	123643	she	192	" Have you come to help me , or to persecute me ? "
123593	123629	123643	123643	she	192	" I have as little power to do one as I have desire to do the other . I came in great part to ask you a question . First , your decision is irrevocable ? "
123655	123669	123643	123643	she	192	" Would you have done this if you had not seen Miss Garland ? "
123681	123686	123687	123687	she	192	" This is interesting ! "
123690	123697	123687	123687	she	192	" Let us have it out . "
123710	123718	123719	123719	Rowland	281	" You do n't answer my question , "
123722	123759	123670	123670	She	192	" You have no right , that I know of , to ask it . But it 's a very clever one ; so clever that it deserves an answer . Very likely I would not . "
123760	123776	123777	123777	Rowland	281	" Last night , when I said that to myself , I was extremely angry , "
123780	123792	123777	123777	Rowland	281	" Oh , dear , and you are not angry now ? "
123793	123799	123670	123670	She	192	" I am less angry . "
123800	123813	123777	123777	Rowland	281	" How very stupid ! But you can say something at least . "
123814	123846	123670	123670	She	192	" If I were to say what is uppermost in my mind , I would say that , face to face with you , it is never possible to condemn you . "
123847	123850	123777	123777	Rowland	281	" Perche ? "
123851	123892	123670	123670	She	192	" You know , yourself ! But I can at least say now what I felt last night . It seemed to me that you had consciously , cruelly dealt a blow at that poor girl . Do you understand ? "
123893	123898	123907	123907	she	2403	" Wait a moment ! "
123935	123973	123928	123928	she	2403	" I see your train of reasoning , but it 's quite wrong . I meant no harm to Miss Garland ; I should be extremely sorry to make her suffer . Tell me you believe that . "
123986	123991	123983	123983	himself	281	" I believe it ! "
123992	124005	124006	124006	Christina	192	" And yet , in a sense , your supposition was true , "
124009	124151	124006	124006	Christina	192	" I conceived , as I told you , a great admiration for Miss Garland , and I frankly confess I was jealous of her . What I envied her was simply her character ! I said to myself , ' She , in my place , would n't marry Casamassima . ' I could not help saying it , and I said it so often that I found a kind of inspiration in it . I hated the idea of being worse than she - of doing something that she would n't do . I might be bad by nature , but I need n't be by volition . The end of it all was that I found it impossible not to tell the prince that I was his very humble servant , but that I could not marry him . "
124152	124174	123983	123983	himself	281	" Are you sure it was only of Miss Garland 's character that you were jealous , not of - not of "
124176	124189	124006	124006	Christina	192	" Speak out , I beg you . We are talking philosophy ! "
124190	124199	123983	123983	himself	281	" Not of her affection for her cousin ? "
124200	124252	124006	124006	Christina	192	" Sure is a good deal to ask . Still , I think I may say it ! There are two reasons ; one , at least , I can tell you : her affection has not a shadow 's weight with Mr. Hudson ! Why then should one fear it ? "
124253	124261	123983	123983	himself	281	" And what is the other reason ? "
124262	124272	124006	124006	Christina	192	" Excuse me ; that is my own affair . "
124289	124296	124297	124297	he	2405	" I have promised your mother , "
124301	124311	124297	124297	he	2405	" to say something in favor of Prince Casamassima . "
124318	124341	124312	124312	She	2406	" Prince Casamassima needs nothing that you can say for him . He is a magnificent parti . I know it perfectly . "
124342	124354	124273	124273	Rowland	281	" You know also of the extreme affliction of your mother ? "
124355	124383	124312	124312	She	2406	" Her affliction is demonstrative . She has been abusing me for the last twenty - four hours as if I were the vilest of the vile . "
124413	124439	124440	124440	she	192	" I have failed of respect to her at other times , but I have not done so now . Since we are talking philosophy , "
124447	124515	124516	124516	she	192	" I may say it 's a simple matter ! I do n't love him . Or rather , perhaps , since we are talking philosophy , I may say it 's not a simple matter . I spoke just now of inspiration . The inspiration has been great , but - I frankly confess it - the choice has been hard . Shall I tell you ? "
124523	124691	124516	124516	she	192	" will you understand me ? It was on the one side the world , the splendid , beautiful , powerful , interesting world . I know what that is ; I have tasted of the cup , I know its sweetness . Ah , if I chose , if I let myself go , if I flung everything to the winds , the world and I would be famous friends ! I know its merits , and I think , without vanity , it would see mine . You would see some fine things ! I should like to be a princess , and I think I should be a very good one ; I would play my part well . I am fond of luxury , I am fond of a great society , I am fond of being looked at . I am corrupt , corruptible , corruption ! Ah , what a pity that could n't be , too ! Mercy of Heaven ! "
124775	124786	124787	124787	she	2408	" But you need n't think I ' m afraid ! "
124790	124811	124813	124813	she	2408	" I have chosen , and I shall hold to it . I have something here , here , here ! "
124818	124857	124813	124813	she	2408	" It 's my own . I sha n't part with it . Is it what you call an ideal ? I do n't know ; I do n't care ! It is brighter than the Casamassima diamonds ! "
124858	124869	124870	124870	Rowland	281	" You say that certain things are your own affair , "
124874	124904	124870	124870	Rowland	281	" but I must nevertheless make an attempt to learn what all this means - what it promises for my friend Hudson . Is there any hope for him ? "
124905	124924	124813	124813	she	2408	" This is a point I ca n't discuss with you minutely . I like him very much . "
124925	124937	124870	124870	Rowland	281	" Would you marry him if he were to ask you ? "
124938	124944	124813	124813	she	2408	" He has asked me . "
124945	124952	124870	124870	Rowland	281	" And if he asks again ? "
124953	124962	124813	124813	she	2408	" I shall marry no one just now . "
124963	124966	124968	124968	Rowland	281	" Roderick , "
124970	124975	124968	124968	Rowland	281	" has great hopes . "
124976	124987	124813	124813	she	2408	" Does he know of my rupture with the prince ? "
124988	124998	124999	124999	Christina	192	" He is making a great holiday of it . "
125013	125020	125021	125021	she	192	" I like him very much , "
125024	125085	125021	125021	she	192	" much more than I used to . Since you told me all that about him at Saint Cecilia 's , I have felt a great friendship for him . There 's something very fine about him ; he 's not afraid of anything . He is not afraid of failure ; he is not afraid of ruin or death . "
125086	125090	125092	125092	Rowland	281	" Poor fellow ! "
125096	125102	125092	125092	Rowland	281	" he is fatally picturesque . "
125103	125121	124999	124999	Christina	192	" Picturesque , yes ; that 's what he is . I am very sorry for him . "
125122	125143	125092	125092	Rowland	281	" Your mother told me just now that you had said that you did n't care a straw for him . "
125144	125270	124999	124999	Christina	192	" Very likely ! I meant as a lover . One does n't want a lover one pities , and one does n't want - of all things in the world - a picturesque husband ! I should like Mr. Hudson as something else . I wish he were my brother , so that he could never talk to me of marriage . Then I could adore him . I would nurse him , I would wait on him and save him all disagreeable rubs and shocks . I am much stronger than he , and I would stand between him and the world . Indeed , with Mr. Hudson for my brother , I should be willing to live and die an old maid ! "
125271	125280	125092	125092	Rowland	281	" Have you ever told him all this ? "
125281	125307	124999	124999	Christina	192	" I suppose so ; I ' ve told him five hundred things ! If it would please you , I will tell him again . "
125308	125314	125316	125317	poor Rowland	281	" Oh , Heaven forbid ! "
125491	125505	125506	125506	he	2411	" You asked a while ago if I had come to help you , "
125509	125525	125506	125506	he	2411	" If I knew how I might help you , I should be particularly glad . "
125541	125545	125546	125546	she	253	" You remember , "
125549	125575	125546	125546	she	253	" your promising me six months ago to tell me what you finally thought of me ? I should like you to tell me now . "
125666	125673	125674	125674	he	2411	" You are an excellent girl ! "
125744	125749	125750	125750	she	2421	" Well , well ? "
125757	125769	125750	125750	she	2421	" Has she listened to you - have you moved her ? "
125770	125779	125780	125780	Rowland	281	" In Heaven 's name , dear madame , "
125783	125796	125780	125780	Rowland	281	" leave the poor girl alone ! She is behaving very well ! "
125797	125831	125750	125750	she	2421	" Behaving very well ? Is that all you have to tell me ? I do n't believe you said a proper word to her . You are conspiring together to kill me ! "
125992	126002	126004	126004	Rowland	281	" But her mother is determined to force matters , "
126006	126014	126044	126045	The Cavaliere	255	" It seems that it must be ! "
126015	126024	126044	126045	The Cavaliere	255	" Do you consider that it must be ? "
126025	126034	126044	126045	The Cavaliere	255	" I do n't differ with Mrs. Light ! "
126035	126043	126044	126045	The Cavaliere	255	" It will be a great cruelty ! "
126051	126061	126044	126045	The Cavaliere	255	" Eh ! it is n't an easy world . "
126062	126074	126044	126045	The Cavaliere	255	" You should do nothing to make it harder , then . "
126075	126087	126044	126045	The Cavaliere	255	" What will you have ? It 's a magnificent marriage . "
126088	126095	126097	126097	Rowland	281	" You disappoint me , Cavaliere , "
126101	126133	126097	126097	Rowland	281	" I imagined you appreciated the great elevation of Miss Light 's attitude . She does n't love the prince ; she has let the matter stand or fall by that . "
126163	126169	126170	126170	he	3489	" I have two hearts , "
126173	126203	126170	126170	he	3489	" one for myself , one for the world . This one opposes Miss Light , the other adores her ! One suffers horribly at what the other does . "
126204	126214	126215	126215	Rowland	281	" I do n't understand double people , Cavaliere , "
126218	126242	126215	126215	Rowland	281	" and I do n't pretend to understand you . But I have guessed that you are going to play some secret card . "
126243	126254	126256	126257	the Cavaliere	255	" The card is Mrs. Light 's , not mine , "
126259	126269	126215	126215	Rowland	281	" It 's a menace , at any rate ? "
126270	126323	126215	126215	Rowland	281	" The sword of Damocles ! It hangs by a hair . Christina is to be given ten minutes to recant , under penalty of having it fall . On the blade there is something written in strange characters . Do n't scratch your head ; you will not make it out . "
126324	126332	126333	126333	Rowland	281	" I think I have guessed it , "
126354	126368	126351	126351	Rowland	281	" Though there are some signs , indeed , I do n't understand . "
126369	126377	126379	126380	the Cavaliere	255	" Puzzle them out at your leisure , "
126386	126430	126379	126380	the Cavaliere	255	" I hear Mrs. Light ; I must go to my post . I wish you were a Catholic ; I would beg you to step into the first church you come to , and pray for us the next half - hour . "
126431	126440	126479	126479	he	1279	" For ' us ' ? For whom ? "
126441	126458	126379	126380	the Cavaliere	255	" For all of us . At any rate remember this : I worship the Christina ! "
127064	127073	127074	127074	Rowland	281	" So you expect to live at Buffalo ? "
127078	127096	127097	127097	Singleton	214	" Well , it will depend upon the views - upon the attitude - of my family , "
127100	127201	127097	127097	Singleton	214	" Oh , I think I shall get on ; I think it can be done . If I find it can be done , I shall really be quite proud of it ; as an artist of course I mean , you know . Do you know I have some nine hundred sketches ? I shall live in my portfolio . And so long as one is not in Rome , pray what does it matter where one is ? But how I shall envy all you Romans - you and Mr. Gloriani , and Mr. Hudson , especially ! "
127202	127214	127303	127303	himself	281	" Do n't envy Hudson ; he has nothing to envy . "
127225	127263	127215	127215	Singleton	214	" Yes , he 's going to be the great man of our time ! And I say , Mr. Mallet , is n't it a mighty comfort that it 's we who have turned him out ? "
127264	127268	127270	127270	Rowland	281	" Between ourselves , "
127272	127278	127270	127270	Rowland	281	" he has disappointed me . "
127286	127295	127279	127279	Singleton	214	" Dear me , what did you expect ? "
127296	127299	127301	127301	Rowland	281	" Truly , "
127305	127311	127301	127301	Rowland	281	" what did I expect ? "
127312	127316	127318	127318	Singleton	214	" I confess , "
127320	127345	127318	127318	Singleton	214	" I ca n't judge him rationally . He fascinates me ; he 's the sort of man one makes one 's hero of . "
127346	127356	127358	127358	Rowland	281	" Strictly speaking , he is not a hero , "
127372	127387	127388	127388	he	214	" Is there anything amiss - anything out of the way , about him ? "
127404	127470	127400	127400	he	214	" Please , if there is , do n't tell me ! I want to know no evil of him , and I think I should hardly believe it . In my memories of this Roman artist - life , he will be the central figure . He will stand there in radiant relief , as beautiful and unspotted as one of his own statues ! "
127471	127474	127476	127476	Rowland	281	" Amen ! "
127668	127675	127676	127676	she	217	" Do n't shout very loud , "
127679	127713	127676	127676	she	217	" remember that we are in church ; there 's a limit to the noise one may make even in Saint Peter 's . Christina Light was married this morning to Prince Casamassima . "
127729	127735	127721	127721	he	214	" Married - this morning ? "
127736	127766	127721	127721	he	214	" Married this morning , at seven o'clock , le plus tranquillement du monde , before three or four persons . The young couple left Rome an hour afterwards . "
127900	127903	127905	127905	Rowland	281	" Listen , "
127909	127917	127905	127905	Rowland	281	" and I will tell you something . "
127946	127949	127950	127950	she	217	" Good , "
127953	127973	127950	127950	she	217	" it 's all very curious . But it 's a riddle , and I only half guess it . "
127974	127977	127979	127979	Rowland	281	" Well , "
127981	128007	127979	127979	Rowland	281	" I desire to harm no one ; but certain suppositions have taken shape in my mind which serve as a solvent to several ambiguities . "
128008	128014	128015	128016	Madame Grandoni	217	" It is very true , "
128019	128035	128015	128016	Madame Grandoni	217	" that the Cavaliere , as he stands , has always needed to be explained . "
128036	128062	127950	127950	she	217	" He is explained by the hypothesis that , three - and - twenty years ago , at Ancona , Mrs. Light had a lover . "
128063	128108	128015	128016	Madame Grandoni	217	" I see . Ancona was dull , Mrs. Light was lively , and - three - and - twenty years ago - perhaps , the Cavaliere was fascinating . Doubtless it would be fairer to say that he was fascinated . Poor Giacosa ! "
128109	128116	128117	128117	Rowland	281	" He has had his compensation , "
128120	128129	128117	128117	Rowland	281	" He has been passionately fond of Christina . "
128130	128140	128015	128016	Madame Grandoni	217	" Naturally . But has Christina never wondered why ? "
128141	128239	128117	128117	Rowland	281	" If she had been near guessing , her mother 's shabby treatment of him would have put her off the scent . Mrs. Light 's conscience has apparently told her that she could expiate an hour 's too great kindness by twenty years ' contempt . So she kept her secret . But what is the profit of having a secret unless you can make some use of it ? The day at last came when she could turn hers to account ; she could let the skeleton out of the closet and create a panic . "
128240	128246	128015	128016	Madame Grandoni	217	" I do n't understand . "
128247	128253	128255	128255	Rowland	281	" Neither do I morally , "
128257	128377	128255	128255	Rowland	281	" I only conceive that there was a horrible , fabulous scene . The poor Cavaliere stood outside , at the door , white as a corpse and as dumb . The mother and daughter had it out together . Mrs. Light burnt her ships . When she came out she had three lines of writing in her daughter 's hand , which the Cavaliere was dispatched with to the prince . They overtook the young man in time , and , when he reappeared , he was delighted to dispense with further waiting . I do n't know what he thought of the look in his bride 's face ; but that is how I roughly reconstruct history . "
128378	128398	128015	128016	Madame Grandoni	217	" Christina was forced to decide , then , that she could not afford not to be a princess ? "
128399	128477	128255	128255	Rowland	281	" She was reduced by humiliation . She was assured that it was not for her to make conditions , but to thank her stars that there were none made for her . If she persisted , she might find it coming to pass that there would be conditions , and the formal rupture - the rupture that the world would hear of and pry into - would then proceed from the prince and not from her . "
128478	128484	128486	128487	Madame Grandoni	217	" That 's all nonsense ! "
128491	128564	128255	128255	Rowland	281	" To us , yes ; but not to the proudest girl in the world , deeply wounded in her pride , and not stopping to calculate probabilities , but muffling her shame , with an almost sensuous relief , in a splendor that stood within her grasp and asked no questions . Is it not possible that the late Mr. Light had made an outbreak before witnesses who are still living ? "
128565	128571	128573	128574	Madame Grandoni	217	" Certainly her marriage now , "
128579	128593	128573	128574	Madame Grandoni	217	" has the advantage that it takes her away from her - parents ! "
128781	128790	128791	128791	she	325	" Oh , we have such blessed news ! "
128794	128802	128791	128791	she	325	" Roderick is ready to leave Rome . "
128803	128816	128818	128818	Roderick	325	" It 's not blessed news ; it 's most damnable news ! "
128820	128885	128886	128886	Roderick	325	" Oh , but we are very glad , my son , and I am sure you will be when you get away . You 're looking most dreadfully thin ; is n't he , Mr. Mallet ? It 's plain enough you need a change . I ' m sure we will go wherever you like . Where would you like to go ? "
128922	128926	128927	128927	he	2476	" Poor mother ! "
128937	128943	128945	128946	Mrs. Hudson	325	" My own dear son ! "
128955	128975	128945	128946	Mrs. Hudson	325	" I do n't care a straw where you go ! I do n't care a straw for anything ! "
128976	129001	128952	128952	her	325	" Oh , my dear boy , you must not say that before all of us here - before Mary , before Mr. Mallet ! "
129002	129008	129009	129009	Roderick	325	" Mary - Mr. Mallet ? "
129059	129072	129073	129073	Roderick	325	" Why should I stand on ceremony with Mary and Mr. Mallet ? "
129077	129127	129073	129073	Roderick	325	" Mary pretends to believe I ' m a fine fellow , and if she believes it as she ought to , nothing I can say will alter her opinion . Mallet knows I ' m a hopeless humbug ; so I need n't mince my words with him . "
129128	129141	129143	129144	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Ah , my dear , do n't use such dreadful language ! "
129146	129176	129143	129144	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Are n't we all devoted to you , and proud of you , and waiting only to hear what you want , so that we may do it ? "
129268	129274	129275	129275	Roderick	325	" In God 's name , "
129278	129330	129275	129275	Roderick	325	" do n't remind me of my obligations ! It 's intolerable to me , and I do n't believe it 's pleasant to Mallet . I know they 're tremendous - I know I shall never repay them . I ' m bankrupt ! Do you know what that means ? "
129344	129354	129355	129355	he	2481	" Do n't talk such stuff to your mother ! "
129358	129368	129355	129355	he	2481	" Do n't you see you 're frightening her ? "
129369	129390	129391	129391	Roderick	325	" Frightening her ? she may as well be frightened first as last . Do I frighten you , mother ? "
129394	129404	129406	129408	the poor lady	651	" Oh , Roderick , what do you mean ? "
129410	129419	129406	129408	the poor lady	651	" Mr. Mallet , what does he mean ? "
129420	129437	129438	129438	Roderick	325	" I mean that I ' m an angry , savage , disappointed , miserable man ! "
129442	129669	129438	129438	Roderick	325	" I mean that I ca n't do a stroke of work nor think a profitable thought ! I mean that I ' m in a state of helpless rage and grief and shame ! Helpless , helpless - that 's what it is . You ca n't help me , poor mother - not with kisses , nor tears , nor prayers ! Mary ca n't help me - not for all the honor she does me , nor all the big books on art that she pores over . Mallet ca n't help me - not with all his money , nor all his good example , nor all his friendship , which I ' m so profoundly well aware of : not with it all multiplied a thousand times and repeated to all eternity ! I thought you would help me , you and Mary ; that 's why I sent for you . But you ca n't , do n't think it ! The sooner you give up the idea the better for you . Give up being proud of me , too ; there 's nothing left of me to be proud of ! A year ago I was a mighty fine fellow ; but do you know what has become of me now ? I have gone to the devil ! "
129889	129898	129899	129899	he	2483	" I really do n't see , Roderick , "
129902	129929	129899	129899	he	2483	" the profit of your talking in just this way at just this time . Do n't you see how you are making your mother suffer ? "
129930	129937	129939	129939	Roderick	325	" Do I enjoy it myself ? "
129941	130027	129939	129939	Roderick	325	" Is the suffering all on your side and theirs ? Do I look as if I were happy , and were stirring you up with a stick for my amusement ? Here we all are in the same boat ; we might as well understand each other ! These women must know that I ' m not to be counted on . That sounds remarkably cool , no doubt , and I certainly do n't deny your right to be utterly disgusted with me . "
130028	130042	130044	130044	Mary	193	" Will you keep what you have got to say till another time , "
130046	130054	130044	130044	Mary	193	" and let me hear it alone ? "
130055	130141	129939	129939	Roderick	325	" Oh , I 'll let you hear it as often as you please ; but what 's the use of keeping it ? I ' m in the humor ; it wo n't keep ! It 's a very simple matter . I ' m a failure , that 's all ; I ' m not a first - rate man . I ' m second - rate , tenth - rate , anything you please . After that , it 's all one ! "
130184	130201	130202	130202	he	2487	" It 's hardly worth while we should have any private talk about this , Mary , "
130205	130257	130202	130202	he	2487	" The thing would be comfortable for neither of us . It 's better , after all , that it be said once for all and dismissed . There are things I ca n't talk to you about . Can I , at least ? You are such a queer creature ! "
130258	130271	130273	130273	Mary	193	" I can imagine nothing you should n't talk to me about , "
130275	130281	130282	130282	he	2487	" You are not afraid ? "
130304	130316	130317	130317	she	193	" Anything you think I should hear , I will hear , "
130336	130344	130346	130346	Roderick	325	" I have had a great blow , "
130348	130367	130346	130346	Roderick	325	" I was a great ass , but it does n't make the blow any easier to bear . "
130368	130378	130380	130381	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Mr. Mallet , tell me what Roderick means ! "
130402	130411	130413	130413	Roderick	325	" He ought to have told you before , "
130415	130504	130413	130413	Roderick	325	" Really , Rowland , if you will allow me to say so , you ought ! You could have given a much better account of all this than I myself ; better , especially , in that it would have been more lenient to me . You ought to have let them down gently ; it would have saved them a great deal of pain . But you always want to keep things so smooth ! Allow me to say that it 's very weak of you . "
130505	130512	130514	130514	Rowland	281	" I hereby renounce such weakness ! "
130516	130529	130531	130532	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh , what is it , sir ; what is it ? "
130536	130548	130413	130413	Roderick	325	" It 's what Roderick says : he 's a failure ! "
130588	130596	130597	130597	she	325	" This from you , Mr. Mallet ! "
130684	130689	130690	130690	Roderick	325	" My dear mother , "
130693	130730	130690	130690	Roderick	325	" if you had had eyes that were not blinded by this sad maternal vanity , you would have seen all this for yourself ; you would have seen that I ' m anything but prosperous . "
130731	130738	130740	130741	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Is it anything about money ? "
130743	130752	130740	130741	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh , do write to Mr. Striker ! "
130753	130756	130758	130758	Roderick	325	" Money ? "
130760	130774	130758	130758	Roderick	325	" I have n't a cent of money ; I ' m bankrupt ! "
130775	130787	130789	130790	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh , Mr. Mallet , how could you let him ? "
130794	130803	130805	130805	Rowland	281	" Everything I have is at his service , "
130810	130822	130824	130826	the poor lady	651	" Of course Mr. Mallet will help you , my son ! "
130830	130838	130840	130840	Roderick	325	" Oh , leave Mr. Mallet alone ! "
130842	130863	130840	130840	Roderick	325	" I have squeezed him dry ; it 's not my fault , at least , if I have n't ! "
130864	130876	130877	130878	his mother	448	" Roderick , what have you done with all your money ? "
130881	130900	130840	130840	Roderick	325	" Thrown it away ! It was no such great amount . I have done nothing this winter . "
130901	130907	130840	130840	Roderick	325	" You have done nothing ? "
130908	130942	130840	130840	Roderick	325	" I have done no work ! Why in the world did n't you guess it and spare me all this ? Could n't you see I was idle , distracted , dissipated ? "
130943	130950	130951	130952	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Dissipated , my dear son ? "
130955	130983	130951	130952	Mrs. Hudson	325	" That 's over for the present ! But could n't you see - could n't Mary see - that I was in a damnably bad way ? "
130984	130993	130995	130995	Rowland	281	" I have no doubt Miss Garland saw , "
130997	131003	131005	131006	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Mary has said nothing ! "
131008	131017	131018	131018	Rowland	281	" Oh , she 's a fine girl ! "
131021	131032	131033	131034	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Have you done anything that will hurt poor Mary ? "
131037	131050	131033	131034	Mrs. Hudson	325	" I have only been thinking night and day of another woman ! "
131060	131073	131051	131052	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh dear , dear , had n't we better go home ? "
131074	131083	131084	131084	Roderick	325	" Not to get out of her way ! "
131087	131314	131084	131084	Roderick	325	" She has started on a career of her own , and she does n't care a straw for me . My head was filled with her ; I could think of nothing else ; I would have sacrificed everything to her - you , Mary , Mallet , my work , my fortune , my future , my honor ! I was in a fine state , eh ? I do n't pretend to be giving you good news ; but I ' m telling the simple , literal truth , so that you may know why I have gone to the dogs . She pretended to care greatly for all this , and to be willing to make any sacrifice in return ; she had a magnificent chance , for she was being forced into a mercenary marriage with a man she detested . She led me to believe that she would give this up , and break short off , and keep herself free and sacred and pure for me . This was a great honor , and you may believe that I valued it . It turned my head , and I lived only to see my happiness come to pass . She did everything to encourage me to hope it would ; everything that her infernal coquetry and falsity could suggest . "
131315	131326	131327	131327	Rowland	281	" Oh , I say , this is too much ! "
131331	131337	131338	131338	Roderick	325	" Do you defend her ? "
131348	131361	131362	131362	He	2495	" Do you pretend to say that she gave me no hopes ? "
131633	131640	131641	131641	he	2495	" Do you pretend to say , "
131645	131839	131641	131641	he	2495	" that she did n't lead me along to the very edge of fulfillment and stupefy me with all that she suffered me to believe , all that she sacredly promised ? It amused her to do it , and she knew perfectly well what she really meant . She never meant to be sincere ; she never dreamed she could be . She 's a ravenous flirt , and why a flirt is a flirt is more than I can tell you . I ca n't understand playing with those matters ; for me they 're serious , whether I take them up or lay them down . I do n't see what 's in your head , Rowland , to attempt to defend Miss Light ; you were the first to cry out against her ! You told me she was dangerous , and I pooh - poohed you . You were right ; you 're always right . She 's as cold and false and heartless as she 's beautiful , and she has sold her heartless beauty to the highest bidder . I hope he knows what he gets ! "
131840	131846	131848	131849	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh , my son , "
131853	131865	131848	131849	Mrs. Hudson	325	" how could you ever care for such a dreadful creature ? "
131866	131878	131641	131641	he	2495	" It would take long to tell you , dear mother ! "
131914	131924	131925	131925	he	2501	" You believed in her too much at first , "
131928	131938	131925	131925	he	2501	" and you believe in her too little now . "
131952	131972	131973	131973	he	2501	" She is an angel , then , after all ? - that 's what you want to prove ! "
131976	132009	131973	131973	he	2501	" That 's consoling for me , who have lost her ! You 're always right , I say ; but , dear friend , in mercy , be wrong for once ! "
132010	132020	132022	132023	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh yes , Mr. Mallet , be merciful ! "
132230	132242	132243	132244	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Had n't you better forget all this , my dear ? "
132247	132259	132243	132244	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Had n't you better just quietly attend to your work ? "
132260	132265	132267	132267	Roderick	325	" Work , madame ? "
132269	132325	132327	132327	he	3562	" My work 's over . I ca n't work - I have n't worked all winter . If I were fit for anything , this sentimental collapse would have been just the thing to cure me of my apathy and break the spell of my idleness . But there 's a perfect vacuum here ! "
132332	132345	132327	132327	he	3562	" It 's bigger than ever ; it grows bigger every hour ! "
132346	132363	132365	132366	Mrs. Hudson	325	" I ' m sure you have made a beautiful likeness of your poor little mother , "
132370	132409	132327	132327	he	3562	" I had done nothing before , and I have done nothing since ! I quarreled with an excellent man , the other day , from mere exasperation of my nerves , and threw away five thousand dollars ! "
132410	132418	132419	132419	Roderick	325	" Threw away - five thousand dollars ! "
132896	132909	132910	132911	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Roderick says he does n't know , he does n't care , "
132914	132922	132910	132911	Mrs. Hudson	325	" he leaves it entirely to you . "
133222	133233	133234	133234	she	325	" You know we have very little money to spend , "
133242	133333	133234	133234	she	325	" Roderick tells me that he has debts and nothing at all to pay them with . He says I must write to Mr. Striker to sell my house for what it will bring , and send me out the money . When the money comes I must give it to him . I ' m sure I do n't know ; I never heard of anything so dreadful ! My house is all I have . But that is all Roderick will say . We must be very economical . "
133384	133400	133372	133372	Rowland	281	" Come away from those statues , and sit down here and listen to me ! "
133412	133423	133424	133424	Rowland	281	" What do you propose to your mother to do ? "
133427	133430	133432	133432	Roderick	325	" Propose ? "
133436	133443	133432	133432	Roderick	325	" Oh , I propose nothing . "
133497	133503	133504	133504	he	2524	" You must do something , "
133507	133514	133504	133504	he	2524	" Choose , select , decide ! "
133515	133524	133525	133525	Roderick	325	" My dear Rowland , how you talk ! "
133528	133591	133525	133525	Roderick	325	" The very point of the matter is that I ca n't do anything . I will do as I ' m told , but I do n't call that doing . We must leave Rome , I suppose , though I do n't see why . We have got no money , and you have to pay money on the railroads . "
133599	133606	133607	133607	she	325	" Listen to him , please ! "
133610	133640	133607	133607	she	325	" Not leave Rome , when we have staid here later than any Christians ever did before ! It 's this dreadful place that has made us so unhappy . "
133641	133647	133649	133649	Roderick	325	" That 's very true , "
133653	133681	133649	133649	Roderick	325	" If I had not come to Rome , I would n't have risen , and if I had not risen , I should n't have fallen . "
133682	133687	133689	133690	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Fallen - fallen ! "
133692	133697	133689	133690	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Just hear him ! "
133698	133708	133709	133709	Roderick	325	" I will do anything you say , Rowland , "
133712	133804	133709	133709	Roderick	325	" I will do anything you want . I have not been unkind to my mother - have I , mother ? I was unkind yesterday , without meaning it ; for after all , all that had to be said . Murder will out , and my low spirits ca n't be hidden . But we talked it over and made it up , did n't we ? It seemed to me we did . Let Rowland decide it , mother ; whatever he suggests will be the right thing . "
134439	134448	134449	134449	he	2542	" A Florentine villa is a good thing ! "
134452	134459	134449	134449	he	2542	" I am at your service . "
134460	134473	134479	134479	her	448	" I ' m sure I hope you 'll get better there , "
134500	134513	134514	134514	he	2542	" Better or worse , remember this : I did those things ! "
134528	134533	134525	134525	Rowland	281	" Remember it yourself ! "
134534	134540	134542	134542	Roderick	325	" They are horribly good ! "
134592	134605	134606	134606	he	2542	" You 'll find the Villa Pandolfini very delightful , very comfortable , "
134609	134644	134606	134606	he	2542	" You ought to be very contented there . Whether you work or whether you loaf , it 's a place for an artist to be happy in . I hope you will work . "
134645	134651	134653	134653	Roderick	325	" I hope I may ! "
134659	134671	134606	134606	he	2542	" When we meet again , have something to show me . "
134672	134685	134686	134686	Roderick	325	" When we meet again ? Where the deuce are you going ? "
134689	134700	134606	134606	he	2542	" Oh , I hardly know ; over the Alps . "
134701	134713	134714	134714	Roderick	325	" Over the Alps ! You 're going to leave me ? "
134809	134818	134819	134819	he	2557	" You desire me to go with you ? "
134822	134850	134784	134784	Roderick	325	" If you do n't go , I wo n't - that 's all ! How in the world shall I get through the summer without you ? "
134851	134866	134907	134907	Rowland	281	" How will you get through it with me ? That 's the question . "
134867	134896	134784	134784	Roderick	325	" I do n't pretend to say ; the future is a dead blank . But without you it 's not a blank - it 's certain damnation ! "
134897	134902	134904	134905	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Mercy , mercy ! "
134921	134934	134907	134907	Rowland	281	" If I go with you , will you try to work ? "
134984	134989	134990	134990	he	2557	" Try to work ! "
134993	135060	134990	134990	he	2557	" Try - try ! work - work ! In God 's name do n't talk that way , or you 'll drive me mad ! Do you suppose I ' m trying not to work ? Do you suppose I stand rotting here for the fun of it ? Do n't you suppose I would try to work for myself before I tried for you ? "
135061	135065	135067	135068	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Mr. Mallet , "
135072	135081	135067	135068	Mrs. Hudson	325	" will you leave me alone with this ? "
136526	136529	136507	136507	him	2584	" dangerous . "
137126	137129	137107	137107	Roderick	325	" tremendous talk "
137825	137828	137852	137852	her	182	" genius , "
138512	138518	138519	138519	she	182	" I am not well , "
138523	138541	138519	138519	she	182	" but it 's a moral malady , and in such cases I consider your company beneficial . "
138542	138552	138554	138554	Rowland	281	" But if I am to be your doctor , "
138556	138566	138519	138519	she	182	" you must tell me how your illness began . "
138567	138600	138601	138601	I	0	" I can tell you very little . It began with Mrs. Hudson being unjust to me , for the first time in her life . And now I am already better ! "
139435	139449	139450	139451	Miss Garland	182	" It 's a night to remember on one 's death - bed ! "
139454	139463	139465	139466	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh , Mary , how can you ! "
139717	139728	139730	139730	Rowland	281	" It seems to you very strange , I suppose , "
139732	139746	139730	139730	Rowland	281	" that there should be any trouble in such a world as this . "
139747	139753	139754	139754	she	182	" I used to think , "
139757	139893	139754	139754	she	182	" that if any trouble came to me I would bear it like a stoic . But that was at home , where things do n't speak to us of enjoyment as they do here . Here it is such a mixture ; one does n't know what to choose , what to believe . Beauty stands there - beauty such as this night and this place , and all this sad , strange summer , have been so full of - and it penetrates to one 's soul and lodges there , and keeps saying that man was not made to suffer , but to enjoy . This place has undermined my stoicism , but - shall I tell you ? I feel as if I were saying something sinful - I love it ! "
139894	139904	139906	139906	Rowland	281	" If it is sinful , I absolve you , "
139908	139960	139906	139906	Rowland	281	" in so far as I have power . We are made , I suppose , both to suffer and to enjoy . As you say , it 's a mixture . Just now and here , it seems a peculiarly strange one . But we must take things in turn . "
139999	140010	140012	140013	his mother	448	" It 's a very beautiful night , my son , "
140043	140046	140047	140047	he	2701	" Beautiful ? "
140050	140084	140047	140047	he	2701	" of course it 's beautiful ! Everything is beautiful ; everything is insolent , defiant , atrocious with beauty . Nothing is ugly but me - me and my poor dead brain ! "
140085	140092	140094	140096	poor Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh , my dearest son , "
140098	140106	140094	140096	poor Mrs. Hudson	325	" do n't you feel any better ? "
140123	140225	140116	140116	he	2701	" I came expressly to tell you that you need n't trouble yourselves any longer to wait for something to turn up . Nothing will turn up ! It 's all over ! I said when I came here I would give it a chance . I have given it a chance . Have n't I , eh ? Have n't I , Rowland ? It 's no use ; the thing 's a failure ! Do with me now what you please . I recommend you to set me up there at the end of the garden and shoot me . "
140226	140232	140234	140234	Rowland	281	" I feel strongly inclined , "
140237	140245	140234	140234	Rowland	281	" to go and get my revolver . "
140246	140256	140258	140259	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh , mercy on us , what language ! "
140261	140265	140266	140266	Roderick	325	" Why not ? "
140270	140309	140266	140266	Roderick	325	" This would be a lovely night for it , and I should be a lucky fellow to be buried in this garden . But bury me alive , if you prefer . Take me back to Northampton . "
140310	140318	140320	140321	his mother	448	" Roderick , will you really come ? "
140323	140385	140266	140266	Roderick	325	" Oh yes , I 'll go ! I might as well be there as anywhere - reverting to idiocy and living upon alms . I can do nothing with all this ; perhaps I should really like Northampton . If I ' m to vegetate for the rest of my days , I can do it there better than here . "
140386	140395	140396	140397	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh , come home , come home , "
140400	140423	140396	140397	Mrs. Hudson	325	" and we shall all be safe and quiet and happy . My dearest son , come home with your poor mother ! "
140424	140435	140396	140397	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Let us go , then , and go quickly ! "
140446	140454	140455	140455	she	325	" We 'll go to - morrow ! "
140458	140467	140455	140455	she	325	" The Lord is very good to me ! "
140512	140519	140520	140520	he	2706	" Are you serious , Roderick ? "
140523	140568	140476	140476	she	193	" Serious ? of course not ! How can a man with a crack in his brain be serious ? how can a muddlehead reason ? But I ' m not jesting , either ; I can no more make jokes than utter oracles ! "
140569	140577	140650	140650	Roderick	325	" Are you willing to go home ? "
140578	140614	140476	140476	she	193	" Willing ? God forbid ! I am simply amenable to force ; if my mother chooses to take me , I wo n't resist . I ca n't ! I have come to that ! "
140615	140622	140624	140624	Rowland	281	" Let me resist , then , "
140626	140643	140624	140624	Rowland	281	" Go home as you are now ? I ca n't stand by and see it . "
140674	140690	140659	140659	he	2706	" You are a queer fellow ! I should think I would disgust you horribly . "
140691	140696	140697	140697	Rowland	281	" Stay another year , "
140701	140705	140697	140697	Rowland	281	" Doing nothing ? "
140706	140720	140659	140659	he	2706	" You shall do something . I am responsible for your doing something . "
140721	140728	140697	140697	Rowland	281	" To whom are you responsible ? "
140747	140752	140743	140743	her	281	" Not to me ! "
140753	140761	140762	140762	Rowland	281	" I ' m responsible to myself , "
140765	140772	140774	140774	Roderick	325	" My poor , dear fellow ! "
140776	140787	140789	140790	Mrs. Hudson	325	" Oh , Mr. Mallet , are n't you satisfied ? "
140815	140854	140806	140806	she	332	" It 's out of all nature keeping him here . When we 're in a poor way , surely our own dear native land is the place for us . Do leave us to ourselves , sir ! "
140893	140904	140905	140905	he	2709	" Take me at least out of this terrible Italy , "
140908	140969	140905	140905	he	2709	" where everything mocks and reproaches and torments and eludes me ! Take me out of this land of impossible beauty and put me in the midst of ugliness . Set me down where nature is coarse and flat , and men and manners are vulgar . There must be something awfully ugly in Germany . Pack me off there ! "
141160	141168	141169	141169	she	281	" Cousin Sarah , the other evening , "
141172	141199	141169	141169	she	281	" asked you to please leave us . I think she hardly knew what she was saying , and I hope you have not taken offense . "
141200	141249	141296	141299	The Princess Casamassima Rowland	281	" By no means ; but I honestly believe that my leaving you would contribute greatly to Mrs. Hudson 's comfort . I can be your hidden providence , you know ; I can watch you at a distance , and come upon the scene at critical moments . "
141267	141276	141277	141277	she	182	" I beg you to come with us ! "
142330	142335	142336	142336	he	2757	" This suits me , "
142339	142355	142336	142336	he	2757	" I could be happy here and forget everything . Why not stay here forever ? "
142499	142508	142509	142509	he	2757	" Pity me , sir ; pity me ! "
142513	142532	142509	142509	he	2757	" Look at this lovely world , and think what it must be to be dead to it ! "
142533	142536	142538	142538	Rowland	281	" Dead ? "
142540	142587	142509	142509	he	2757	" Dead , dead ; dead and buried ! Buried in an open grave , where you lie staring up at the sailing clouds , smelling the waving flowers , and hearing all nature live and grow above you ! That 's the way I feel ! "
142588	142596	142598	142598	Rowland	281	" I am glad to hear it , "
142600	142611	142598	142598	Rowland	281	" Death of that sort is very near to resurrection . "
142612	142618	142619	142619	Roderick	325	" It 's too horrible , "
142623	142665	142619	142619	Roderick	325	" it has all come over me here tremendously ! If I were not ashamed , I could shed a bushel of tears . For one hour of what I have been , I would give up anything I may be ! "
142666	142678	142619	142619	Roderick	325	" Never mind what you have been ; be something better ! "
142679	142861	142619	142619	Roderick	325	" I shall never be anything again : it 's no use talking ! But I do n't know what secret spring has been touched since I have lain here . Something in my heart seemed suddenly to open and let in a flood of beauty and desire . I know what I have lost , and I think it horrible ! Mind you , I know it , I feel it ! Remember that hereafter . Do n't say that he was stupefied and senseless ; that his perception was dulled and his aspiration dead . Say that he trembled in every nerve with a sense of the beauty and sweetness of life ; that he rebelled and protested and shrieked ; that he was buried alive , with his eyes open , and his heart beating to madness ; that he clung to every blade of grass and every way - side thorn as he passed ; that it was the most horrible spectacle you ever witnessed ; that it was an outrage , a murder , a massacre ! "
142862	142872	142873	142873	Rowland	281	" Good heavens , man , are you insane ? "
142876	142971	142619	142619	Roderick	325	" I never have been saner . I do n't want to be bad company , and in this beautiful spot , at this delightful hour , it seems an outrage to break the charm . But I am bidding farewell to Italy , to beauty , to honor , to life ! I only want to assure you that I know what I lose . I know it in every pulse of my heart ! Here , where these things are all loveliest , I take leave of them . Farewell , farewell ! "
143472	143479	143480	143480	he	2765	" I can get the flower , "
143485	143491	143480	143480	he	2765	" Will you trust me ? "
143492	143506	143507	143507	she	182	" I do n't want it ; I would rather not have it ! "
143510	143516	143517	143517	he	2765	" Will you trust me ? "
143549	143557	143558	143558	she	182	" I wish it were something better ! "
143753	143760	143761	143761	she	182	" Why did you do that ? "
143779	143785	143796	143796	his	2765	" Because I love you ! "
143803	143813	143794	143794	He	2765	" Because I wanted to do something for you . "
143814	143820	143822	143823	Miss Garland	182	" Suppose you had fallen , "
143825	143841	143794	143794	He	2765	" I believed I would not fall . And you believed it , I think . "
143842	143857	143794	143794	He	2765	" I believed nothing . I simply trusted you , as you asked me . "
143858	143863	143865	143865	Rowland	281	" Quod erat demonstrandum ! "
143867	143874	143865	143865	Rowland	281	" I think you know Latin . "
144031	144034	144039	144046	angular young women of the country - side	2795	" help , "
144714	144720	144721	144721	Roderick	325	" I do n't know , "
144724	144732	144721	144721	Roderick	325	" I do n't heed the sense . "
144755	144761	144762	144762	Roderick	325	" I listen to Mary , "
144765	144778	144762	144762	Roderick	325	" for the sake of her voice . It 's distractingly sweet ! "
145531	145535	145536	145536	he	2800	" I imagine , "
145541	145567	145536	145536	he	2800	" that you are not sorry , at present , to have allowed yourself to be dissuaded from making a final rupture with Miss Garland . "
145588	145591	145568	145568	Roderick	325	" Dissuaded ? "
145592	145652	145568	145568	Roderick	325	" Do n't you remember that , in Rome , you wished to break your engagement , and that I urged you to respect it , though it seemed to hang by so slender a thread ? I wished you to see what would come of it ? If I am not mistaken , you are reconciled to it . "
145653	145657	145659	145659	Roderick	325	" Oh yes , "
145661	145728	145659	145659	Roderick	325	" I remember what you said ; you made it a kind of personal favor to yourself that I should remain faithful . I consented , but afterwards , when I thought of it , your attitude greatly amused me . Had it ever been seen before ? - a man asking another man to gratify him by not suspending his attentions to a pretty girl ! "
145729	145738	145740	145740	Rowland	281	" It was as selfish as anything else , "
145742	145772	145740	145740	Rowland	281	" One man puts his selfishness into one thing , and one into another . It would have utterly marred my comfort to see Miss Garland in low spirits . "
145773	145789	145568	145568	Roderick	325	" But you liked her - you admired her , eh ? So you intimated . "
145790	145796	145740	145740	Rowland	281	" I admire her profoundly . "
145797	145865	145568	145568	Roderick	325	" It was your originality then - to do you justice you have a great deal , of a certain sort - to wish her happiness secured in just that fashion . Many a man would have liked better himself to make the woman he admired happy , and would have welcomed her low spirits as an opening for sympathy . You were awfully queer about it . "
145866	145871	145873	145873	Rowland	281	" So be it ! "
145875	145907	145873	145873	Rowland	281	" The question is , Are you not glad I was queer ? Are you not finding that your affection for Miss Garland has a permanent quality which you rather underestimated ? "
145908	146086	145568	145568	Roderick	325	" I do n't pretend to say . When she arrived in Rome , I found I did n't care for her , and I honestly proposed that we should have no humbug about it . If you , on the contrary , thought there was something to be gained by having a little humbug , I was willing to try it ! I do n't see that the situation is really changed . Mary Garland is all that she ever was - more than all . But I do n't care for her ! I do n't care for anything , and I do n't find myself inspired to make an exception in her favor . The only difference is that I do n't care now , whether I care for her or not . Of course , marrying such a useless lout as I am is out of the question for any woman , and I should pay Miss Garland a poor compliment to assume that she is in a hurry to celebrate our nuptials . "
146087	146095	146097	146097	Rowland	281	" Oh , you 're in love ! "
146151	146165	146148	146148	his	2826	" Call it what you please ! I am past caring for names . "
146771	146783	146784	146784	she	659	" Why , we are delighted that you are with us ! "
146826	146848	146812	146812	He	2826	" That evening on the terrace , late , after Mrs. Hudson had gone to bed , and Roderick being absent . "
146861	146875	146876	146876	she	659	" I am afraid your kindness has been a great charge upon you , "
146879	146889	146876	146876	she	659	" You wanted very much to do something else . "
146890	146937	146938	146938	She	659	" I wanted above all things to oblige you , and I made no sacrifice . But if I had made an immense one , it would be more than made up to me by any assurance that I have helped Roderick into a better mood . "
146947	146954	146955	146955	she	659	" Why do you ask me ? "
146958	146969	146955	146955	she	659	" You are able to judge quite as well as I. "
146984	146989	146990	146990	he	2835	" The truth is , "
146993	147025	146990	146990	he	2835	" that I am afraid I care only in the second place for Roderick 's holding up his head . What I care for in the first place is your happiness . "
147026	147036	147037	147037	she	659	" I do n't know why that should be , "
147040	147097	147037	147037	she	659	" I have certainly done nothing to make you so much my friend . If you were to tell me you intended to leave us to - morrow , I am afraid that I should not venture to ask you to stay . But whether you go or stay , let us not talk of Roderick ! "
147098	147102	147104	147104	Rowland	281	" But that , "
147106	147117	147104	147104	Rowland	281	" does n't answer my question . Is he better ? "
147118	147121	147122	147122	she	659	" No ! "
147190	147197	147198	147198	he	2836	" I wonder where she is , "
147201	147214	147198	147198	he	2836	" and what sort of a life she is leading her prince . "
147264	147268	147269	147269	Roderick	325	" Christina Light ? "
147282	147295	147269	147269	Roderick	325	" Where she is ? It 's extraordinary how little I care ! "
147296	147307	147355	147355	Roderick	325	" Have you , then , completely got over it ? "
147322	147328	147329	147329	he	2836	" She 's a humbug ! "
147333	147336	147338	147338	Rowland	281	" Possibly ! "
147340	147348	147338	147338	Rowland	281	" But I have known worse ones . "
147349	147354	147355	147355	Roderick	325	" She disappointed me ! "
147362	147373	147355	147355	Roderick	325	" Had she , then , really given you hopes ? "
147374	147382	147383	147383	Roderick	325	" Oh , do n't recall it ! "
147386	147410	147383	147383	Roderick	325	" Why the devil should I think of it ? It was only three months ago , but it seems like ten years . "
147429	147463	147421	147421	he	2836	" I believed there was a future in it all ! She pleased me - pleased me ; and when an artist - such as I was - is pleased , you know ! "
147469	147671	147673	147673	he	2846	" You never saw her as I did ; you never heard her in her great moments . But there is no use talking about that ! At first she would n't regard me seriously ; she chaffed me and made light of me . But at last I forced her to admit I was a great man . Think of that , sir ! Christina Light called me a great man . A great man was what she was looking for , and we agreed to find our happiness for life in each other . To please me she promised not to marry till I gave her leave . I was not in a marrying way myself , but it was damnation to think of another man possessing her . To spare my sensibilities , she promised to turn off her prince , and the idea of her doing so made me as happy as to see a perfect statue shaping itself in the block . You have seen how she kept her promise ! When I learned it , it was as if the statue had suddenly cracked and turned hideous . She died for me , like that ! "
147678	147706	147673	147673	he	2846	" Was it wounded vanity , disappointed desire , betrayed confidence ? I am sure I do n't know ; you certainly have some name for it . "
147707	147717	147719	147719	Rowland	281	" The poor girl did the best she could , "
147721	147752	147673	147673	he	2846	" If that was her best , so much the worse for her ! I have hardly thought of her these two months , but I have not forgiven her . "
147753	147773	147673	147673	he	2846	" Well , you may believe that you are avenged . I ca n't think of her as happy . "
147774	147781	147783	147783	Roderick	325	" I do n't pity her ! "
147813	147820	147822	147822	Roderick	325	" Who is this mighty man , "
147826	147854	147822	147822	Roderick	325	" and what is he coming down upon us for ? We are small people here , and we ca n't undertake to keep company with giants . "
147855	147866	147868	147868	Rowland	281	" Wait till we meet him on our own level , "
147870	147879	147868	147868	Rowland	281	" and perhaps he will not overtop us . "
147880	147888	147889	147889	Roderick	325	" For ten minutes , at least , "
147892	147901	147889	147889	Roderick	325	" he will have been a great man ! "
147924	147940	147921	147921	Roderick	325	" I would like to see her once more - simply to look at her . "
147941	147948	147950	147950	Rowland	281	" I would not advise it , "
147952	147961	147962	147962	Roderick	325	" It was her beauty that did it ! "
147966	148055	147962	147962	Roderick	325	" It was all her beauty ; in comparison , the rest was nothing . What befooled me was to think of it as my property ! And I had made it mine - no one else had studied it as I had , no one else understood it . What does that stick of a Casamassima know about it at this hour ? I should like to see it just once more ; it 's the only thing in the world of which I can say so . "
148056	148063	148064	148064	Rowland	281	" I would not advise it , "
148067	148075	148077	148077	Roderick	325	" That 's right , dear Rowland , "
148079	148090	148077	148077	Roderick	325	" do n't advise ! That 's no use now . "
148608	148615	148617	148617	Roderick	325	" Are you always like this ? "
148624	148628	148630	148630	Singleton	214	" Like this ? "
148640	148669	148709	148709	Singleton	214	" You remind me of a watch that never runs down . If one listens hard one hears you always - tic - tic , tic - tic . "
148670	148676	148678	148678	Singleton	214	" Oh , I see , "
148683	148689	148678	148678	Singleton	214	" I am very equable . "
148690	148708	148709	148709	Singleton	214	" You are very equable , yes . And do you find it pleasant to be equable ? "
148748	148753	148754	148754	he	214	" Oh , delightful ! "
148765	148768	148769	148769	he	214	" Damnation ! "
149426	149435	149436	149436	she	192	" Do let us leave this hideous edifice , "
149439	149452	149436	149436	she	192	" there are things here that set one 's teeth on edge . "
149481	149490	149474	149474	she	192	" I am extremely glad to see you . "
149533	149540	149541	149541	she	192	" I wish to sit here , "
149544	149553	149541	149541	she	192	" and speak to Mr. Mallet - alone . "
149554	149562	149564	149565	the prince	3484	" At your pleasure , dear friend , "
149657	149663	149664	149664	he	273	" Shall I come back ? "
149671	149677	149679	149679	Christina	192	" In half an hour , "
149741	149747	149748	149748	she	192	" How came you here ? "
149751	149759	149748	149748	she	192	" Are you staying in this place ? "
149760	149776	149717	149717	Rowland	281	" I am staying at Engelthal , some ten miles away ; I walked over . "
149777	149782	149748	149748	she	192	" Are you alone ? "
149783	149790	149717	149717	Rowland	281	" I am with Mr. Hudson . "
149791	149798	149748	149748	she	192	" Is he here with you ? "
149799	149814	149717	149717	Rowland	281	" He went half an hour ago to climb a rock for a view . "
149815	149828	149748	149748	she	192	" And his mother and that young girl , where are they ? "
149829	149836	149717	149717	Rowland	281	" They also are at Engelthal . "
149837	149844	149748	149748	she	192	" What do you do there ? "
149845	149852	149854	149854	Rowland	281	" What do you do here ? "
149858	149887	149748	149748	she	192	" I count the minutes till my week is up . I hate mountains ; they depress me to death . I am sure Miss Garland likes them . "
149888	149899	149748	149748	she	192	" She is very fond of them , I believe . "
149900	149920	149922	149922	Christina	192	" You believe - do n't you know ? But I have given up trying to imitate Miss Garland , "
149924	149932	149748	149748	she	192	" You surely need imitate no one . "
149933	149939	149940	149940	she	192	" Do n't say that , "
149944	149962	149940	149940	she	192	" So you have walked ten miles this morning ? And you are to walk back again ? "
149963	149969	149748	149748	she	192	" Back again to supper . "
149970	149976	149940	149940	she	192	" And Mr. Hudson too ? "
149977	149988	149748	149748	she	192	" Mr. Hudson especially . He is a great walker . "
149989	149995	149996	149996	Christina	192	" You men are happy ! "
149999	150048	149996	149996	Christina	192	" I believe I should enjoy the mountains if I could do such things . It is sitting still and having them scowl down at you ! Prince Casamassina never rides . He only goes on a mule . He was carried up the Faulhorn on a litter . "
150049	150054	150056	150056	Rowland	281	" On a litter ? "
150058	150074	149748	149748	she	192	" In one of those machines - a chaise a porteurs - like a woman . "
150094	150108	150109	150109	Christina	192	" Is Mr. Hudson to join you again ? Will he come here ? "
150112	150121	149996	149996	Christina	192	" I shall soon begin to expect him . "
150122	150132	150133	150133	Christina	192	" What shall you do when you leave Switzerland ? "
150136	150144	150133	150133	Christina	192	" Shall you go back to Rome ? "
150145	150157	149996	149996	Christina	192	" I rather doubt it . My plans are very uncertain . "
150158	150167	150133	150133	Christina	192	" They depend upon Mr. Hudson , eh ? "
150168	150174	149996	149996	Christina	192	" In a great measure . "
150175	150200	150133	150133	Christina	192	" I want you to tell me about him . Is he still in that perverse state of mind that afflicted you so much ? "
150243	150255	150256	150256	she	192	" I see no reason why we should not be frank , "
150259	150322	150256	150256	she	192	" I should think we were excellently placed for that sort of thing . You remember that formerly I cared very little what I said , do n't you ? Well , I care absolutely not at all now . I say what I please , I do what I please ! How did Mr. Hudson receive the news of my marriage ? "
150323	150327	150329	150329	Rowland	281	" Very badly , "
150331	150337	150340	150340	Rowland	281	" With rage and reproaches ? "
150344	150349	150340	150340	Rowland	281	" With silent contempt ? "
150350	150385	150256	150256	she	192	" I can tell you but little . He spoke to me on the subject , but I stopped him . I told him it was none of his business , or of mine . "
150386	150393	150395	150395	Christina	192	" That was an excellent answer ! "
150399	150427	150395	150395	Christina	192	" Yet it was a little your business , after those sublime protestations I treated you to . I was really very fine that morning , eh ? "
150428	150434	150436	150436	Rowland	281	" You do yourself injustice , "
150438	150451	150436	150436	Rowland	281	" I should be at liberty now to believe you were insincere . "
150452	150484	150395	150395	Christina	192	" What does it matter now whether I was insincere or not ? I ca n't conceive of anything mattering less . I was very fine - is n't it true ? "
150485	150494	150496	150496	Rowland	281	" You know what I think of you , "
150522	150532	150395	150395	Christina	192	" Your mother , I hope , is well . "
150533	150579	150614	150614	Christina	192	" My mother is in the enjoyment of superb health , and may be seen every evening at the Casino , at the Baths of Lucca , confiding to every new - comer that she has married her daughter to a pearl of a prince . "
150602	150610	150611	150611	he	2912	" And the Cavaliere Giacosa is well ? "
150624	150656	150618	150618	she	192	" The Cavaliere has retired to his native city of Ancona , upon a pension , for the rest of his natural life . He is a very good old man ! "
150657	150666	150668	150668	Rowland	281	" I have a great regard for him , "
150706	150713	150714	150714	Rowland	281	" And what do you do , "
150717	150723	150714	150714	Rowland	281	" on leaving this place ? "
150724	150735	150736	150736	She	2917	" We go to Italy - we go to Naples . "
150939	150948	150949	150949	she	2917	" I hope we may never meet again ! "
150961	150988	150989	150989	she	2917	" You have seen me at my best . I wish to tell you solemnly , I was sincere ! I know appearances are against me , "
150994	151051	150989	150989	she	2917	" There is a great deal I ca n't tell you . Perhaps you have guessed it ; I care very little . You know , at any rate , I did my best . It would n't serve ; I was beaten and broken ; they were stronger than I. Now it 's another affair ! "
151052	151066	151068	151068	Rowland	281	" It seems to me you have a large chance for happiness yet , "
151072	151127	150989	150989	she	2917	" Happiness ? I mean to cultivate rapture ; I mean to go in for bliss ineffable ! You remember I told you that I was , in part , the world 's and the devil 's . Now they have taken me all . It was their choice ; may they never repent ! "
151128	151135	151137	151137	Rowland	281	" I shall hear of you , "
151139	151159	150989	150989	she	2917	" You will hear of me . And whatever you do hear , remember this : I was sincere ! "
151182	151184	151160	151161	Prince Casamassima	273	" world "
151343	151350	151351	151351	Rowland	281	" You are going to Naples ? "
151361	151368	151369	151369	Christina	192	" We are going to Paris , "
151376	151396	151369	151369	Christina	192	" We are going to London . We are going to Vienna . We are going to St. Petersburg . "
151520	151527	151528	151528	Christina	192	" You do n't look well ! "
151551	151558	151559	151559	he	2927	" You are no less beautiful ! "
151594	151597	151598	151598	she	192	" Farewell , "
151601	151617	151598	151598	she	192	" If you are near me in future , do n't try to see me ! "
151630	151635	151636	151636	She	192	" I was sincere ! "
151712	151721	151722	151722	she	192	" I wo n't say farewell to you , "
151725	151731	151722	151722	she	192	" we shall meet again ! "
151897	151906	151907	151907	she	182	" I wish to ask you a question , "
151910	151919	151907	151907	she	182	" What happened to Roderick yesterday at Engelberg ? "
151920	151928	151929	151929	Rowland	281	" You have discovered that something happened ? "
151932	151944	151929	151929	Rowland	281	" I am sure of it . Was it something painful ? "
151945	151967	151907	151907	she	182	" I do n't know how , at the present moment , he judges it . He met the Princess Casamassima . "
151968	151972	151974	151975	Miss Garland	182	" Thank you ! "
152657	152663	152664	152664	he	214	" What is it now ? "
152701	152712	152713	152713	he	214	" I would like you to do me a favor , "
152718	152724	152713	152713	he	214	" Lend me some money . "
152725	152732	152733	152733	Rowland	281	" How much do you wish ? "
152736	152742	152713	152713	he	214	" Say a thousand francs . "
152748	152771	152743	152743	Rowland	281	" I do n't wish to be indiscreet , but may I ask what you propose to do with a thousand francs ? "
152772	152778	152713	152713	he	214	" To go to Interlaken . "
152779	152788	152743	152743	Rowland	281	" And why are you going to Interlaken ? "
152797	152806	152789	152789	Roderick	325	" Because that woman is to be there . "
152818	152826	152828	152828	Rowland	281	" You have forgiven her , then ? "
152830	152837	152713	152713	he	214	" Not a bit of it ! "
152838	152844	152713	152713	he	214	" I do n't understand . "
152845	152875	152713	152713	he	214	" Neither do I. I only know that she is incomparably beautiful , and that she has waked me up amazingly . Besides , she asked me to come . "
152876	152881	152713	152713	he	214	" She asked you ? "
152882	152890	152713	152713	he	214	" Yesterday , in so many words . "
152891	152897	152713	152713	he	214	" Ah , the jade ! "
152898	152910	152713	152713	he	214	" Exactly . I am willing to take her for that . "
152911	152926	152713	152713	he	214	" Why in the name of common sense did you go back to her ? "
152927	152966	152713	152713	he	214	" Why did I find her standing there like a goddess who had just stepped out of her cloud ? Why did I look at her ? Before I knew where I was , the harm was done . "
152998	153004	153005	153005	he	2952	" Are you perfectly serious ? "
153008	153012	152713	152713	he	214	" Deadly serious . "
153013	153024	152996	152996	himself	281	" Your idea is to remain at Interlaken some time ? "
153025	153028	153030	153030	Roderick	325	" Indefinitely ! "
153053	153078	153043	153043	he	2952	" And your mother and cousin , meanwhile , are to remain here ? It will soon be getting very cold , you know . "
153079	153091	152996	152996	himself	281	" It does n't seem much like it to - day . "
153092	153106	153043	153043	he	2952	" Very true ; but to - day is a day by itself . "
153107	153128	152996	152996	himself	281	" There is nothing to prevent their going back to Lucerne . I depend upon your taking charge of them . "
153149	153155	153156	153156	he	2952	" How would you express , "
153159	153174	153156	153156	he	2952	" the character of the profit that you expect to derive from your excursion ? "
153175	153265	153267	153267	he	2952	" I see no need of expressing it . The proof of the pudding is in the eating ! The case is simply this . I desire immensely to be near Christina Light , and it is such a huge refreshment to find myself again desiring something , that I propose to drift with the current . As I say , she has waked me up , and it is possible something may come of it . She makes me feel as if I were alive again . This , "
153274	153279	153267	153267	he	2952	" I call death ! "
153280	153299	153408	153408	Roderick	325	" That I am very grateful to hear . You really feel as if you might do something ? "
153300	153322	153267	153267	he	2952	" Do n't ask too much . I only know that she makes my heart beat , makes me see visions . "
153323	153328	153408	153408	Roderick	325	" You feel encouraged ? "
153329	153334	153267	153267	he	2952	" I feel excited . "
153335	153342	153408	153408	Roderick	325	" You are really looking better . "
153343	153366	153267	153267	he	2952	" I am glad to hear it . Now that I have answered your questions , please to give me the money . "
153372	153381	153367	153367	Rowland	281	" For that purpose , I ca n't ! "
153382	153387	153408	153408	Roderick	325	" You ca n't ? "
153388	153407	153367	153367	Rowland	281	" It 's impossible . Your plan is rank folly . I ca n't help you in it . "
153418	153432	153414	153414	his	2952	" I will borrow what money I can , then , from Mary ! "
153471	153482	153483	153483	he	2952	" The little brass one opens my dressing - case , "
153486	153494	153483	153483	he	2952	" You will find money in it . "
153515	153521	153508	153508	he	2952	" You are awfully gallant ! "
153522	153534	153508	153508	he	2952	" You certainly are not . Your proposal is an outrage . "
153535	153549	153508	153508	he	2952	" Very likely . It 's a proof the more of my desire . "
153550	153658	153508	153508	he	2952	" If you have so much steam on , then , use it for something else . You say you are awake again . I am delighted ; only be so in the best sense . Is n't it very plain ? If you have the energy to desire , you have also the energy to reason and to judge . If you can care to go , you can also care to stay , and staying being the more profitable course , the inspiration , on that side , for a man who has his self - confidence to win back again , should be greater . "
153682	153688	153689	153689	he	2952	" Oh , the devil ! "
153696	153750	153692	153692	Rowland	281	" Do you believe that hanging about Christina Light will do you any good ? Do you believe it wo n't ? In either case you should keep away from her . If it wo n't , it 's your duty ; and if it will , you can get on without it . "
153751	153756	153758	153758	Roderick	325	" Do me good ? "
153760	153824	153758	153758	Roderick	325	" What do I want of ' good ' - what should I do with ' good ' ? I want what she gives me , call it by what name you will . I want to ask no questions , but to take what comes and let it fill the impossible hours ! But I did n't come to discuss the matter . "
153825	153836	153838	153838	Rowland	281	" I have not the least desire to discuss it , "
153840	153845	153838	153838	Rowland	281	" I simply protest . "
153851	153865	153866	153866	he	2957	" I have never yet thought twice of accepting a favor of you , "
153871	153880	153866	153866	he	2957	" but this one sticks in my throat . "
153881	153897	153924	153924	His	2957	" It is not a favor ; I lend you the money only under compulsion . "
153898	153911	153912	153912	Roderick	325	" Well , then , I will take it only under compulsion ! "
153984	153991	153992	153992	he	2957	" I have done my best ! "
153995	154048	153992	153992	he	2957	" My mother is out of money ; she is expecting next week some circular notes from London . She had only ten francs in her pocket . Mary Garland gave me every sou she possessed in the world . It makes exactly thirty - four francs . That 's not enough . "
154049	154055	154057	154057	Rowland	281	" You asked Miss Garland ? "
154059	154064	153992	153992	he	2957	" I asked her . "
154065	154072	153992	153992	he	2957	" And told her your purpose ? "
154073	154083	153992	153992	he	2957	" I named no names . But she knew ! "
154084	154090	153992	153992	he	2957	" What did she say ? "
154091	154102	153992	153992	he	2957	" Not a syllable . She simply emptied her purse . "
154184	154196	154198	154198	Roderick	325	" I do n't know what is the matter with me , "
154200	154212	154198	154198	Roderick	325	" but I have an insurmountable aversion to taking your money . "
154213	154230	154273	154273	His	2959	" The matter , I suppose , is that you have a grain of wisdom left . "
154231	154253	154254	154254	He	2959	" No , it 's not that . It 's a kind of brute instinct . I find it extremely provoking ! "
154293	154304	154305	154305	he	2959	" You have succeeded in making this thing excessively unpleasant ! "
154308	154313	154315	154315	Rowland	281	" I am sorry , "
154317	154329	154315	154315	Rowland	281	" but I ca n't see it in any other way . "
154330	154379	154380	154380	Roderick	325	" That I believe , and I resent the range of your vision pretending to be the limit of my action . You ca n't feel for me nor judge for me , and there are certain things you know nothing about . I have suffered , sir ! "
154387	154481	154380	154380	Roderick	325	" I have suffered damnable torments . Have I been such a placid , contented , comfortable man this last six months , that when I find a chance to forget my misery , I should take such pains not to profit by it ? You ask too much , for a man who himself has no occasion to play the hero . I do n't say that invidiously ; it 's your disposition , and you ca n't help it . But decidedly , there are certain things you know nothing about . "
154514	154522	154523	154523	Rowland	281	" These things - what are they ? "
154526	154561	154380	154380	Roderick	325	" They are women , principally , and what relates to women . Women for you , by what I can make out , mean nothing . You have no imagination - no sensibility ! "
154562	154569	154571	154571	Rowland	281	" That 's a serious charge , "
154575	154584	154380	154380	Roderick	325	" I do n't make it without proof ! "
154585	154592	154380	154380	Roderick	325	" And what is your proof ? "
154598	154612	154593	154593	Roderick	325	" The way you treated Christina Light . I call that grossly obtuse . "
154613	154616	154617	154617	Rowland	281	" Obtuse ? "
154622	154632	154593	154593	Roderick	325	" Thick - skinned , beneath your good fortune . "
154633	154638	154380	154380	Roderick	325	" My good fortune ? "
154639	154676	154593	154593	Roderick	325	" There it is - it 's all news to you ! You had pleased her . I do n't say she was dying of love for you , but she took a fancy to you . "
154677	154684	154686	154686	Rowland	281	" We will let this pass ! "
154692	154709	154593	154593	Roderick	325	" Oh , I do n't insist . I have only her own word for it . "
154710	154716	154593	154593	Roderick	325	" She told you this ? "
154717	154764	154593	154593	Roderick	325	" You noticed , at least , I suppose , that she was not afraid to speak . I never repeated it , not because I was jealous , but because I was curious to see how long your ignorance would last if left to itself . "
154765	154787	154593	154593	Roderick	325	" I frankly confess it would have lasted forever . And yet I do n't consider that my insensibility is proved . "
154788	154796	154798	154798	Roderick	325	" Oh , do n't say that , "
154800	154919	154798	154798	Roderick	325	" or I shall begin to suspect - what I must do you the justice to say that I never have suspected - that you are a trifle conceited . Upon my word , when I think of all this , your protest , as you call it , against my following Christina Light seems to me thoroughly offensive . There is something monstrous in a man 's pretending to lay down the law to a sort of emotion with which he is quite unacquainted - in his asking a fellow to give up a lovely woman for conscience ' sake , when he has never had the impulse to strike a blow for one for passion 's ! "
154920	154925	154927	154927	Rowland	281	" Oh , oh ! "
154929	154938	154939	154939	Roderick	325	" All that 's very easy to say , "
154943	155023	154939	154939	Roderick	325	" but you must remember that there are such things as nerves , and senses , and imagination , and a restless demon within that may sleep sometimes for a day , or for six months , but that sooner or later wakes up and thumps at your ribs till you listen to him ! If you ca n't understand it , take it on trust , and let a poor imaginative devil live his life as he can ! "
155151	155157	155158	155158	he	2961	" You are incredibly ungrateful , "
155161	155319	155158	155158	he	2961	" You are talking arrogant nonsense . What do you know about my sensibilities and my imagination ? How do you know whether I have loved or suffered ? If I have held my tongue and not troubled you with my complaints , you find it the most natural thing in the world to put an ignoble construction on my silence . I loved quite as well as you ; indeed , I think I may say rather better . I have been constant . I have been willing to give more than I received . I have not forsaken one mistress because I thought another more beautiful , nor given up the other and believed all manner of evil about her because I had not my way with her . I have been a good friend to Christina Light , and it seems to me my friendship does her quite as much honor as your love ! "
155320	155333	155335	155335	Roderick	325	" Your love - your suffering - your silence - your friendship ! "
155337	155345	155335	155335	Roderick	325	" I declare I do n't understand ! "
155346	155432	155158	155158	he	2961	" I dare say not . You are not used to understanding such things - you are not used to hearing me talk of my feelings . You are altogether too much taken up with your own . Be as much so as you please ; I have always respected your right . Only when I have kept myself in durance on purpose to leave you an open field , do n't , by way of thanking me , come and call me an idiot . "
155433	155445	155335	155335	Roderick	325	" Oh , you claim then that you have made sacrifices ? "
155446	155455	155158	155158	he	2961	" Several ! You have never suspected it ? "
155456	155470	155472	155472	Roderick	325	" If I had , do you suppose I would have allowed it ? "
155474	155500	155158	155158	he	2961	" They were the sacrifices of friendship and they were easily made ; only I do n't enjoy having them thrown back in my teeth . "
155525	155532	155533	155533	he	2962	" Come , be more definite , "
155536	155548	155533	155533	he	2962	" Let me know where it is the shoe has pinched . "
155565	155572	155573	155573	he	2962	" It 's a perpetual sacrifice , "
155576	155584	155573	155573	he	2962	" to live with a perfect egotist . "
155585	155591	155593	155593	Roderick	325	" I am an egotist ? "
155595	155603	155573	155573	he	2962	" Did it never occur to you ? "
155604	155615	155616	155616	He	2962	" An egotist to whom you have made perpetual sacrifices ? "
155650	155655	155657	155657	Rowland	281	" You are selfish , "
155659	155761	155657	155657	Rowland	281	" you think only of yourself and believe only in yourself . You regard other people only as they play into your own hands . You have always been very frank about it , and the thing seemed so mixed up with the temper of your genius and the very structure of your mind , that often one was willing to take the evil with the good and to be thankful that , considering your great talent , you were no worse . But if one believed in you , as I have done , one paid a tax upon it . "
155801	155810	155811	155811	he	2963	" So I have made you very uncomfortable ? "
155815	155819	155811	155811	he	2963	" Extremely so . "
155820	155838	155811	155811	he	2963	" I have been eager , grasping , obstinate , vain , ungrateful , indifferent , cruel ? "
155839	155858	155811	155811	he	2963	" I have accused you , mentally , of all these things , with the exception of vanity . "
155859	155866	155811	155811	he	2963	" You have often hated me ? "
155867	155882	155811	155811	he	2963	" Never . I should have parted company with you before coming to that . "
155883	155902	155811	155811	he	2963	" But you have wanted to part company , to bid me go my way and be hanged ! "
155903	155915	155811	155811	he	2963	" Repeatedly . Then I have had patience and forgiven you . "
155916	155927	155811	155811	he	2963	" Forgiven me , eh ? Suffering all the while ? "
155928	155937	155811	155811	he	2963	" Yes , you may call it suffering . "
155938	155949	155811	155811	he	2963	" Why did you never tell me all this before ? "
155950	156012	155811	155811	he	2963	" Because my affection was always stronger than my resentment ; because I preferred to err on the side of kindness ; because I had , myself , in a measure , launched you in the world and thrown you into temptations ; and because nothing short of your unwarrantable aggression just now could have made me say these painful things . "
156050	156057	156058	156058	Roderick	325	" I must have been hideous , "
156062	156071	156073	156073	Rowland	281	" I am not talking for your entertainment , "
156075	156084	156086	156086	Roderick	325	" Of course not . For my edification ! "
156102	156111	156112	156112	Rowland	281	" I have spoken for my own relief , "
156116	156135	156112	156112	Rowland	281	" and so that you need never again go so utterly astray as you have done this morning . "
156136	156146	156148	156148	his	2965	" It has been a terrible mistake , then ? "
156172	156178	156179	156179	Roderick	325	" And all this time , "
156182	156194	156179	156179	Roderick	325	" you have been in love ? Tell me the woman . "
156209	156216	156217	156217	he	2965	" Her name is Mary Garland , "
156237	156245	156232	156232	he	2965	" Mary Garland ? Heaven forgive us ! "
156249	156252	156246	156246	Rowland	281	" us ; "
156299	156307	156308	156308	Roderick	325	" For how long has this been ? "
156311	156318	156281	156281	Rowland	281	" Since I first knew her . "
156319	156330	156281	156281	Rowland	281	" Two years ! And you have never told her ? "
156331	156334	156281	156281	Rowland	281	" Never . "
156335	156342	156281	156281	Rowland	281	" You have told no one ? "
156343	156350	156281	156281	Rowland	281	" You are the first person . "
156351	156358	156281	156281	Rowland	281	" Why have you been silent ? "
156359	156365	156281	156281	Rowland	281	" Because of your engagement . "
156366	156378	156281	156281	Rowland	281	" But you have done your best to keep that up . "
156379	156385	156281	156281	Rowland	281	" That 's another matter ! "
156386	156392	156394	156394	Roderick	325	" It 's very strange ! "
156398	156407	156394	156394	Roderick	325	" It 's like something in a novel . "
156408	156416	156418	156418	Rowland	281	" We need n't expatiate on it , "
156420	156438	156418	156418	Rowland	281	" All I wished to do was to rebut your charge that I am an abnormal being . "
156444	156462	156441	156441	Roderick	325	" All these months , while I was going on ! I wish you had mentioned it . "
156463	156478	156394	156394	Roderick	325	" I acted as was necessary , and that 's the end of it . "
156479	156489	156441	156441	Roderick	325	" You have a very high opinion of her ? "
156490	156494	156394	156394	Roderick	325	" The highest . "
156495	156532	156441	156441	Roderick	325	" I remember now your occasionally expressing it and my being struck with it . But I never dreamed you were in love with her . It 's a pity she does n't care for you ! "
156564	156577	156394	156394	Roderick	325	" You hope , I suppose , that some day she may ? "
156578	156597	156441	156441	Roderick	325	" I should n't have offered to say so ; but since you ask me , I do . "
156598	156624	156394	156394	Roderick	325	" I do n't believe it . She idolizes me , and if she never were to see me again she would idolize my memory . "
156650	156675	156441	156441	Roderick	325	" My indifference , my neglect of her , must have seemed to you horrible . Altogether , I must have appeared simply hideous . "
156676	156682	156683	156683	Rowland	281	" Do you really care , "
156686	156691	156683	156683	Rowland	281	" what you appeared ? "
156692	156718	156441	156441	Roderick	325	" Certainly . I have been damnably stupid . Is n't an artist supposed to be a man of perceptions ? I am hugely disgusted . "
156719	156732	156683	156683	Rowland	281	" Well , you understand now , and we can start afresh . "
156733	156737	156739	156739	Roderick	325	" And yet , "
156741	156768	156739	156739	Roderick	325	" though you have suffered , in a degree , I do n't believe you have suffered so much as some other men would have done . "
156769	156782	156683	156683	Rowland	281	" Very likely not . In such matters quantitative analysis is difficult . "
156795	156804	156805	156805	he	2970	" Nevertheless , I must have seemed hideous , "
156808	156811	156812	156812	He	2970	" hideous . "
156846	156852	156853	156853	Rowland	281	" Where are you going ? "
156857	156877	156835	156835	Roderick	325	" Oh , I do n't care ! To walk ; you have given me something to think of . "
156892	156904	156905	156905	Roderick	325	" To have been so stupid damns me more than anything ! "
156909	156919	156905	156905	Roderick	325	" Certainly , I can shut up shop now . "
157029	157038	157040	157040	Rowland	281	" I should like to go with you , "
157042	157055	157022	157022	He	170	" I am fit only to be alone . I am damned ! "
157056	157067	157068	157068	Rowland	281	" You had better not think of it at all , "
157071	157078	157068	157068	Rowland	281	" than think in that way . "
157079	157091	157093	157093	he	2970	" There is only one way . I have been hideous ! "
157324	157330	157331	157331	she	182	" I have a headache , "
157348	157355	157331	157331	she	182	" It 's this horrible day ! "
157390	157417	157380	157380	he	2977	" I believe there is such a thing as being too reasonable . But when once the habit is formed , what is one to do ? "
157724	157735	157736	157738	the little painter	1190	" We are going to have a most interesting storm , "
157742	157751	157736	157738	the little painter	1190	" I should like awfully to do it . "
157867	157879	157880	157880	she	325	" My boy , my boy , where is my boy ? "
157883	157899	157880	157880	she	325	" Mr. Mallet , why are you here without him ? Bring him to me ! "
157900	157908	157909	157909	Rowland	281	" Has no one seen Mr. Hudson ? "
157915	157921	157909	157909	Rowland	281	" Has he not returned ? "
157951	157962	157963	157963	she	325	" Go and find him , go and find him ! "
157968	157981	157963	157963	she	325	" Do n't stand there and talk , or I shall die ! "
158007	158013	157998	157998	Singleton	214	" And where is Mary ? "
158019	158041	158014	158015	Mrs. Hudson	325	" what in mercy 's name has become of her ? Mr. Mallet , why did you ever bring us here ? "
158148	158157	158158	158158	she	325	" Did you see nothing , - nothing ? "
158161	158195	158158	158158	she	325	" Tell Mr. Mallet he must go and find him , with some men , some lights , some wrappings . Go , go , go , sir ! In mercy , go ! "
158284	158290	158291	158291	she	182	" Could you find him ? "
158295	158302	158291	158291	she	182	" Would it be of use ? "
158628	158636	158637	158637	she	182	" I think you make her worse , "
158891	158898	158899	158899	he	2997	" This also have I guaranteed ! "
158920	158932	158933	158933	she	182	" What made him start on a long walk so suddenly ? "
158936	158956	158933	158933	she	182	" I saw him at eleven o'clock , and then he meant to go to Engelberg , and sleep . "
158957	158964	158965	158965	Rowland	281	" On his way to Interlaken ? "
158968	158971	158972	158972	she	182	" Yes , "
158981	158987	158989	158989	Rowland	281	" We had some talk , "
158991	159006	158989	158989	Rowland	281	" and he seemed , for the day , to have given up Interlaken . "
159007	159013	158965	158965	Rowland	281	" Did you dissuade him ? "
159014	159033	158989	158989	Rowland	281	" Not exactly . We discussed another question , which , for the time , superseded his plan . "
159041	159051	159052	159052	she	182	" May I ask whether your discussion was violent ? "
159055	159067	158989	158989	Rowland	281	" I am afraid it was agreeable to neither of us . "
159068	159078	158965	158965	Rowland	281	" And Roderick left you in - in irritation ? "
159079	159093	158989	158989	Rowland	281	" I offered him my company on his walk . He declined it . "
159109	159117	159118	159118	she	182	" If he had gone to Engelberg , "
159121	159133	159118	159118	she	182	" he would have reached the hotel before the storm began . "
159142	159149	159150	159150	he	3026	" Oh , if you like , "
159153	159166	159150	159150	he	3026	" he can start for Interlaken as soon as he comes back ! "
159176	159183	159184	159184	she	182	" Will he come back early ? "
159188	159194	159168	159168	she	182	" We may suppose so . "
159195	159213	159168	159168	she	182	" He will know how anxious we are , and he will start with the first light ! "
159247	159254	159239	159239	he	3026	" I expect him at sunrise . "
160062	160069	160071	160072	the painter	3057	" Come down - come down ! "
160139	160145	160147	160147	Rowland	281	" What do you see ? "
160163	160170	160171	160171	he	214	" Come down - come down ! "
160465	160472	160474	160474	Singleton	214	" He was a beautiful man ! "
160543	160552	160553	160553	Rowland	281	" There must be three or four men , "
160556	160575	160553	160553	Rowland	281	" and they must be brought here quickly . I have not the least idea where we are . "
160576	160588	160590	160590	Singleton	214	" We are at about three hours ' walk from home , "
160592	160605	160590	160590	Singleton	214	" I will go for help ; I can find my way . "
160606	160609	160611	160611	Rowland	281	" Remember , "
160613	160621	160611	160611	Rowland	281	" whom you will have to face . "
160622	160626	160627	160629	the excellent fellow	3069	" I remember , "
160632	160653	160627	160629	the excellent fellow	3069	" There was nothing I could ever do for him in life ; I will do what I can now . "
161296	161308	161288	161288	he	214	" No , I assure you I am the most patient ! "
